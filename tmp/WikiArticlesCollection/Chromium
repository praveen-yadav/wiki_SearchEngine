'''Chromium''' is a [[chemical element]] which has the symbol '''Cr''' and [[atomic number]] 24.  It is the first element in [[Group 6 element|Group 6]]. It is a steely-gray, [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustrous]], [[hardness|hard]] and brittle [[metal]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brandes |first1=E. A. |last2=Greenaway |first2=H. T. |last3=Stone |first3=H.

The name of the element is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word "chrōma" (χρώμα), meaning [[colour]],<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dxrw%3Dma χρώμα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> because many of its compounds are intensely coloured.

Chromium oxide was used by the Chinese in the [[Qin dynasty]] over 2,000 years ago to coat metal weapons found with the [[Terracotta Army]]. Chromium was discovered as an element after it came to the attention of the western world in the red crystalline [[mineral]] [[crocoite]] ([[lead(II) chromate]]), discovered in 1761 and initially used as a [[pigment]]. [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin]] first isolated chromium metal from this mineral in 1797. Since Vauquelin's first production of metallic chromium, small amounts of native (free) chromium metal have been discovered in rare minerals, but these are not used commercially. Instead, nearly all chromium is commercially extracted from the single commercially viable ore [[chromite]], which is iron chromium oxide (FeCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Chromite is also now the chief source of chromium for chromium pigments.

Chromium metal and [[ferrochromium]] alloy are commercially produced from chromite by [[silicothermic]] or [[aluminothermic reaction]]s, or by [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] and [[Leaching (metallurgy)|leaching]] processes. Chromium metal has proven of high value due to its high [[corrosion]] resistance and [[hardness]]. A major development was the discovery that steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form [[stainless steel]]. This application, along with [[chrome plating]] ([[electroplating]] with chromium) currently comprise 85% of the commercial use for the element, with applications for chromium compounds forming the remainder.

[[Trivalent]] chromium (Cr(III)) [[ion]] is possibly required in trace amounts for [[sugar]] and [[lipid]] [[metabolism]], although the issue remains in debate.<ref name="Cronin"/> In larger amounts and in different forms, chromium can be toxic and [[carcinogenic]]. The most prominent example of toxic chromium is [[hexavalent chromium]] (Cr(VI)). Abandoned chromium production sites often require [[Environmental remediation|environmental cleanup]].

==Characteristics==

===Physical===
Chromium is remarkable for its magnetic properties: it is the only elemental solid which shows [[antiferromagnetic]] ordering at room temperature (and below). Above 38 °C, it transforms into a [[paramagnetic]] state.<ref name="fawcett"/>

====Passivation====
Chromium metal left standing in air is [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivated]] by [[oxygen]], forming a thin protective oxide surface layer. This layer is a [[spinel]] structure only a few atoms thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying material. This barrier is in contrast to iron or plain carbon steels, where the oxygen migrates into the underlying material and causes [[rust]]ing.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The oxidation of alloys|last = Wallwork|first = G. R.|year = 1976|journal = Reports on the Progress Physics|volume = 39|pages = 401–485|doi = 10.1088/0034-4885/39/5/001|issue = 5|bibcode = 1976RPPh...39..401W }}</ref> The passivation can be enhanced by short contact with [[oxidizing acid]]s like [[nitric acid]]. [[Passivation (chemistry)|Passivated]] chromium is stable against acids. The opposite effect can be achieved by treatment with a strong [[reducing agent]] that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.<ref name = "HollemanAF"/>

Chromium, unlike metals such as iron and nickel, does not suffer from [[hydrogen embrittlement]]. However, it does suffer from nitrogen [[embrittlement]], reacting with nitrogen from air and forming brittle nitrides at the high temperatures necessary to work the metal parts.<ref>{{Cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=CGMrAAAAYAAJ|title = High-temperature oxidation-resistant coatings: coatings for protection from oxidation of superalloys, refractory metals, and graphite|author = National Research Council (U.S.).

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of chromium}}
Naturally occurring chromium is composed of three stable [[isotope]]s; <sup>52</sup>Cr, <sup>53</sup>Cr and <sup>54</sup>Cr with <sup>52</sup>Cr being the most abundant (83.789% [[natural abundance]]). 19 [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized with the most stable being <sup>50</sup>Cr with a [[half-life]] of (more than) 1.8{{e|17}} years, and <sup>51</sup>Cr with a half-life of 27.7 days. All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than 24 hours and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 1 minute. This element also has 2 [[meta state]]s.<ref name="NUBASE">{{Cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| year = 2003| doi = 10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.H.}}</ref>

<sup>53</sup>Cr is the [[radiogenic]] decay product of <sup>53</sup>[[manganese|Mn]]. Chromium [[isotope|isotopic]] contents are typically combined with [[manganese]] isotopic contents and have found application in [[isotope geology]]. [[manganese|Mn]]-Cr isotope ratios reinforce the evidence from <sup>26</sup>[[Aluminium|Al]] and <sup>107</sup>[[Palladium|Pd]] for the early history of the [[solar system]]. Variations in <sup>53</sup>Cr/<sup>52</sup>Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites indicate an initial <sup>53</sup>Mn/<sup>55</sup>Mn ratio that suggests Mn-Cr isotopic composition must result from in-situ decay of <sup>53</sup>Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence <sup>53</sup>Cr provides additional evidence for [[nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthetic]] processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system.<ref name="53Mn53Cr">{{Cite journal|journal = Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume = 63|issue = 23–24|year = 1999|pages = 4111–4117|doi = 10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00312-9|title = <sup>53</sup>Mn-<sup>53</sup>Cr evolution of the early solar system|first = J.

Chromium is a member of the [[transition metal]]s, in [[Group 6 element|group 6]]. Chromium(0) has an electronic configuration of 4s<sup>1</sup>3d<sup>5</sup>, owing to the lower energy of the [[Spin states (d electrons)|high spin configuration]]. Chromium exhibits a wide range of possible [[oxidation state]]s, where the +3 state is most stable energetically; the +3 and +6 states are most commonly observed in chromium compounds, whereas the +1, +4 and +5 states are rare.<ref name=Greenwood/>

===Chromium(III)===
[[File:Chlorid chromitý.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Chromium(III) chloride hexahydrate ([CrCl<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>]Cl·2H<sub>2</sub>O)]]
[[File:Chromium(III)-chloride-purple-anhydrous-sunlight.jpg|thumb|upright|Anhydrous chromium(III) chloride (CrCl<sub>3</sub>)]]

A large number of chromium(III) compounds are known. Chromium(III) can be obtained by dissolving elemental chromium in acids like [[hydrochloric acid]] or [[sulfuric acid]]. The {{chem|Cr|3+}} ion has a similar radius (63&nbsp;[[picometre|pm]]) to the {{chem|Al|3+}} ion (radius 50&nbsp;pm), so they can replace each other in some compounds, such as in [[chrome alum]] and [[alum]]. When a trace amount of {{chem|Cr|3+}} replaces {{chem|Al|3+}} in [[corundum]] (aluminium oxide, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), the red-colored [[ruby]] is formed.

Chromium(III) ions tend to form [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] complexes.  The colors of these complexes is determined by the ligands attached to the Cr centre.  The commercially available [[chromium(III) chloride]] hydrate is the dark green complex [CrCl<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>]Cl.  Closely related compounds have different colours: pale green [CrCl(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> and the violet [Cr(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]Cl<sub>3</sub>. If water-free green [[chromium(III) chloride]] is dissolved in water then the green solution turns violet after some time, due to the substitution of water by chloride in the inner [[coordination sphere]]. This kind of reaction is also observed with solutions of [[chrome alum]] and other water-soluble chromium(III) salts.

[[Chromium(III) hydroxide]] (Cr(OH)<sub>3</sub>) is [[Amphoterism|amphoteric]], dissolving in acidic solutions to form [Cr(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>, and in basic solutions to form {{chem|[Cr(OH)|6|]|3-}}. It is dehydrated by heating to form the green [[chromium(III) oxide]] (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), which is the stable oxide with a crystal structure identical to that of [[corundum]].<ref name="HollemanAF"/>

===Chromium(VI)===
[[File:Chrom(VI)-oxid.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Chromium(VI) oxide]]
[[Hexavalent chromium|Chromium(VI) compounds]] are powerful oxidants at low or neutral pH.  Most important are [[chromate]] anion ({{chem|CrO|4|2-}}) and [[dichromate]] (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2-</sup>) anions, which exist in equilibrium:
:2 [CrO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>  +  2 H<sup>+</sup>  <math>\overrightarrow{\leftarrow}</math> [Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>  +  H<sub>2</sub>O
Chromium(VI) halides are known also and include the [[hexafluoride]] [[chromium hexafluoride|CrF<sub>6</sub>]] and [[chromyl chloride]] ({{chem|CrO|2|Cl|2}}).<ref name="HollemanAF">{{Cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 1081–1095|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman|coauthors = Wiberg, Egon; Wiberg, Nils;|chapter = Chromium| language = German}}</ref>

[[Sodium chromate]] is produced industrially by the oxidative roasting of [[chromite]] ore with [[calcium carbonate|calcium]] or [[sodium carbonate]]. The dominant species is therefore, by the [[law of mass action]], determined by the pH of the solution. The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (chromate) to orange ([[dichromate]]), such as when an acid is added to a neutral solution of [[potassium chromate]]. At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex [[oxyanion]]s of chromium is possible.

Both the chromate and dichromate anions are strong oxidizing reagents at low pH:<ref name="HollemanAF"/>

They are, however, only moderately oxidizing at high pH:<ref name="HollemanAF"/>

Chromium(VI) compounds in solution can be detected by adding an acidic [[hydrogen peroxide]] solution. The unstable dark blue [[chromium(VI) peroxide]] (CrO<sub>5</sub>) is formed, which can be stabilized as an ether adduct {{chem|CrO|5|·OR|2}}.<ref name="HollemanAF"/>

[[Chromic acid]] has the hypothetical formula {{chem|H|2|CrO|4}}. It is a vaguely described chemical, despite many well-defined chromates and dichromates being known. The dark red [[chromium(VI) oxide]] {{chem|CrO|3}}, the acid [[anhydride]] of chromic acid, is sold industrially as "chromic acid".<ref name="HollemanAF"/> It can be produced by mixing sulfuric acid with dichromate, and is a strong oxidizing agent.

===Chromium(V) and chromium(IV)===
The oxidation state +5 is only realized in few compounds but are intermediates in many reactions involving oxidations by chromate. The only binary compound is the volatile chromium(V) fluoride (CrF<sub>5</sub>). This red solid has a melting point of 30 °C and a boiling point of 117 °C. It can be synthesized by treating chromium metal with fluorine at 400 °C and 200 bar pressure. The peroxochromate(V) is another example of the +5 oxidation state. [[Potassium tetraperoxochromate(V)|Potassium peroxochromate]] (K<sub>3</sub>[Cr(O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]) is made by reacting potassium chromate with hydrogen peroxide at low temperatures. This red brown compound is stable at room temperature but decomposes spontaneously at 150–170&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://dokumentix.ub.uni-siegen.de/opus/volltexte/2006/52/|title = Preparation, Structure and Vibrational Spectroscopy of Tetraperoxo Complexes of Cr<sup>V+</sup>, V<sup>V+</sup>, Nb<sup>V+</sup> and Ta<sup>V+</sup>|year= 2003|first = Gentiana|last = Haxhillazi|publisher= PhD thesis, University of Siegen}}</ref>

Compounds of chromium(IV) (in the +4 oxidation state) are slightly more common than those of chromium(V). The tetrahalides, CrF<sub>4</sub>, CrCl<sub>4</sub>, and CrBr<sub>4</sub>, can be produced by treating the trihalides ({{chem|CrX|3}}) with the corresponding halogen at elevated temperatures. Such compounds are susceptible to disproportionation reactions and are not stable in water.

===Chromium(II)===
Many chromium(II) compounds are known, including the water-stable [[chromium(II) chloride]], {{chem|CrCl|2}}, which can be made by reduction of chromium(III) chloride with zinc. The resulting bright blue solution is only stable at neutral [[pH]].<ref name="HollemanAF"/> Many chromous carboxylates are also known, most famously, the red [[chromous acetate]] (Cr<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>CCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>), which features a quadruple bond.

===Chromium(I)===
Most Cr(I) compounds are obtained by oxidation of electron-rich, octahedral Cr(0) complexes. Other Cr(I) complexes contain [[cyclopentadienyl]] ligands.  As verified by [[X-ray diffraction]], a Cr-Cr [[quintuple bond]] (length 183.51(4) &nbsp;pm) has also been described.<ref>{{Cite journal|author = Nguyen, T.|title = Synthesis of a Stable Compound with Fivefold Bonding Between Two Chromium(I) Centers|year = 2005|journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume = 310|issue = 5749|pages = 844–847|doi =10.1126/science.1116789|pmid = 16179432|display-authors = 1|last2 = Sutton|first2 = AD|last3 = Brynda|first3 = M|last4 = Fettinger|first4 = JC|last5 = Long|first5 = GJ|last6 = Power|first6 = PP|bibcode = 2005Sci...310..844N }}</ref> Extremely bulky monodentate ligands stabilize this compound by shielding the quintuple bond from further reactions.

{{Main|Organochromium chemistry}}
Many chromium(0) compounds are known. Most are derivatives of [[chromium hexacarbonyl]] or [[bis(benzene)chromium]].

==History==
Weapons found in burial pits dating from the late 3rd century B.C. [[Qin Dynasty]] of the [[Terracotta Army]] near [[Xi'an]], [[China]] have been analyzed by archaeologists. Although buried more than 2,000 years ago, the ancient [[bronze]] tips of [[crossbow]] bolts and swords found at the site showed unexpectedly little corrosion, possibly because the bronze was deliberately coated with a thin layer of chromium oxide.<ref>Cotterell, Maurice. (2004). ''The Terracotta Warriors: The Secret Codes of the Emperor's Army''. Rochester: Bear and Company. ISBN 1-59143-033-X. Page 102.</ref> {{dubious|date=October 2012}}<!--this has been discussed in many places. These swords are not chromium coated as we know elemental chromium, but this passage implied that before fixing. [http://www.chinahistoryforum.com/index.php?/topic/17605-qin-bronze-swords%3B-chromium-chroming/ see this]--> However, this oxide layer was not chromium metal or chrome plating as we know it.

Chromium minerals as pigments came to the attention of the west in the 18th century. On 26 July 1761, [[Johann Gottlob Lehmann (scientist)|Johann Gottlob Lehmann]] found an orange-red mineral in the [[Beryozovskoye deposit|Beryozovskoye mines]] in the [[Ural Mountains]] which he named ''Siberian red lead''. Though misidentified as a [[lead]] compound with [[selenium]] and [[iron]] components, the mineral was in fact [[crocoite]] (''[[lead chromate]]'') with a formula of PbCrO<sub>4</sub>.<ref name="ChromiumVI">{{Cite book|title = Chromium (VI) Handbook|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-56670-608-7|pages = 7–11|author = Guertin, Jacques; Jacobs, James Alan and Avakian, Cynthia P. }}</ref>

In 1770, [[Peter Simon Pallas]] visited the same site as Lehmann and found a red lead mineral that had useful properties as a [[pigment]] in [[paint]]s. The use of Siberian red lead as a paint pigment then developed rapidly. A bright [[yellow]] pigment made from crocoite also became fashionable.<ref name="ChromiumVI"/>

[[File:Cut Ruby.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The red colour of rubies is from a small amount of chromium.]]

In 1797, [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin]] received samples of crocoite [[ore]]. He produced [[chromium(VI) oxide|chromium trioxide]] (CrO<sub>3</sub>) by mixing crocoite with [[hydrochloric acid]]. In 1798, Vauquelin discovered that he could isolate metallic chromium by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven, making him the discoverer of the element.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://books.google.com/?id=6dgPAAAAQAAJ|journal =Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Art|year = 1798|page = 146|volume =3|title = Memoir on a New Metallic Acid which exists in the Red Lead of Sibiria|first = Louis Nicolas|last = Vauquelin}}</ref> Vauquelin was also able to detect traces of chromium in precious [[gemstone]]s, such as [[ruby]] or [[emerald]].<ref name="ChromiumVI"/><ref>{{cite web|last = van der Krogt|first = Peter|title = Chromium|url = http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=Cr|accessdate = 2008-08-24}}</ref>

During the 1800s, chromium was primarily used as a component of paints and in [[tanning]] salts. At first, crocoite from [[Russia]] was the main source, but in 1827, a larger chromite deposit was discovered near [[Baltimore]], [[United States]]. This made the United States the largest producer of chromium products till 1848 when large deposits of chromite were found near [[Bursa]], [[Turkey]].<ref name="NRC"/>

Chromium is also known for its luster when polished. It is used as a protective and decorative coating on car parts, plumbing fixtures, furniture parts and many other items, usually applied by [[electroplating]]. Chromium was used for electroplating as early as 1848, but this use only became widespread with the development of an improved process in 1924.<ref name="Crplating">{{Cite book|title = Nickel and Chromium Plating| publisher = Woodhead Publishing|year = 1993| isbn = 978-1-85573-081-6| pages = 9–12|chapter = History of Chromium Plating|author = Dennis, J.

For the production of pure chromium, the iron has to be separated from the chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated with a mixture of [[calcium carbonate]] and [[sodium carbonate]] in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the [[chromate]]s and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The chromate is converted by sulfuric acid into the dichromate.<ref name="IndMin"/>

{{Main|Chrome plating}}

The strengthening effect of forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries and the strong increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The [[high speed steel|high-speed tool steels]] contain between 3 and 5% chromium. [[Stainless steel]], the main corrosion-proof metal alloy, is formed when chromium is added to [[iron]] in sufficient concentrations, usually above 11%. For its formation, ferrochromium is added to the molten iron. Also nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For example, [[Inconel]] 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel [[superalloy]]s, they are used in [[jet engine]]s and [[gas turbine]]s in lieu of common structural materials.<ref name="superal">{{cite web|title = Nickel-Based Superalloys|first = H.

The relative high hardness and corrosion resistance of unalloyed chromium makes it a good surface coating, being still the most "popular" metal coating with unparalleled combined durability. A thin layer of chromium is deposited on pretreated metallic surfaces by [[electroplating]] techniques. There are two deposition methods: Thin, below 1&nbsp;µm thickness, layers are deposited by [[chrome plating]], and are used for decorative surfaces. If wear-resistant surfaces are needed then thicker chromium layers are deposited. Both methods normally use acidic chromate or [[dichromate]] solutions. To prevent the energy-consuming change in oxidation state, the use of chromium(III) sulfate is under development, but for most applications, the established process is used.<ref name="Crplating"/>

In the [[chromate conversion coating]] process, the strong oxidative properties of chromates are used to deposit a protective oxide layer on metals like aluminium, zinc and cadmium. This [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] and the self-healing properties by the chromate stored in the chromate conversion coating, which is able to migrate to local defects, are the benefits of this coating method.<ref name="Edwards">{{cite book |last = Edwards |first = Joseph |title = Coating and Surface Treatment Systems for Metals |publisher = Finishing Publications Ltd. and ASMy International |year = 1997|pages = 66–71 |isbn = 0-904477-16-9}}</ref> Because of environmental and health regulations on chromates, alternative coating method are under development.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal = Surface and Coatings Technology|volume = 140|issue = 1| year = 2001|doi = 10.1016/S0257-8972(01)01003-9|title = Effects of chromate and chromate conversion coatings on corrosion of aluminum alloy 2024-T3|first = J.|last = Zhao|url = http://web.archive.org/web/20110720032734/https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/36519/55_FrankelG_EffectsChromateChromateConversion_2001_p51-57.pdf;jsessionid=79F700B63A8774ACE6A18AEFE4D9C4D1?sequence=1|pages = 51–57|last2 = Xia|first2 = L.|last3 = Sehgal|first3 = A.|last4 = Lu|first4 = D.|last5 = McCreery|first5 = R.L.|last6 = Frankel|first6 = G.S.}}</ref>

[[Anodizing]] of aluminium is another electrochemical process, which does not lead to the deposition of chromium, but uses [[chromic acid]] as electrolyte in the solution. During anodization, an oxide layer is formed on the aluminium. The use of chromic acid, instead of the normally used sulfuric acid, leads to a slight difference of these oxide layers.<ref name="surface">{{Cite book| title = ASM Handbook: Surface Engineering|first = J.

The high toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds, used in the established chromium electroplating process, and the strengthening of safety and environmental regulations demand a search for substitutes for chromium or at least a change to less toxic chromium(III) compounds.<ref name="Crplating"/>

The mineral [[crocoite]] ([[lead chromate]] PbCrO<sub>4</sub>) was used as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, [[chrome yellow]] was, together with [[cadmium yellow]], one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example [[Deutsche Post]]) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO<sub>4</sub>·Pb(OH)<sub>2</sub>). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of [[polyvinyl butyral]]. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15&nbsp;µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of [[Prussian blue]] and [[chrome yellow]], while the chrome oxide green is [[chromium(III) oxide]].<ref name="Cryel">{{Cite journal|url = http://books.google.com/?id=bdQVgKWl3f4C&pg=PA106|title = Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia|first = Rutherford John|last = Gettens|publisher = Courier Dover Publications|year = 1966|isbn = 978-0-486-21597-6|pages = 105–106|chapter =Chrome yellow}}</ref>

Aggressive dialysis can improve the situation.<ref name="Dayan">{{cite journal |title = Mechanisms of chromium toxicity, carcinogenicity and allergenicity: Review of the literature from 1985 to 2000 |first = A.

The [[carcinogenity]] of chromate dust is known for a long time, and in 1890 the first publication described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a chromate dye company.<ref>{{cite journal |title = A case of adeno-carcinoma of the left inferior turbinated body, and perforation of thenasal septum, in the person of a worker in chrome pigments |first = D.|last = Newman |journal = Glasgow Medical Journal |volume = 33|pages = 469–470 |year = 1890}}</ref><ref name="Langard">{{cite journal |title = One Hundred Years of Chromium and Cancer: A Review of Epidemiological Evidence and Selected Case Reports |first = Sverre |last = Langard |journal = American Journal of Industrial Medicine |volume = 17 |issue = 2|pages = 189–214 |year = 1990 |doi = 10.1002/ajim.4700170205 |pmid = 2405656}}</ref> Three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the [[genotoxicity]] of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly reactive [[hydroxyl radical]]s and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the [[DNA]]. The last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of the end product of the chromium(III) reduction.<ref name="Cohen">{{cite journal |title = Mechanisms of chromium carcinogenicity and toxicity |first = M.

Chromium salts (chromates) are also the cause of [[allergic reaction]]s in some people. Chromates are often used to manufacture, amongst other things, leather products, paints, cement, mortar and anti-corrosives. Contact with products containing chromates can lead to allergic [[contact dermatitis]] and irritant dermatitis, resulting in ulceration of the skin, sometimes referred to as "chrome ulcers". This condition is often found in workers that have been exposed to strong chromate solutions in electroplating, tanning and chrome-producing manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web|publisher = DermNet NZ|title = Chrome Contact Allergy|url = http://dermnetnz.org/dermatitis/chrome-allergy.html}}</ref><ref name=" ">{{cite journal |title = Investigation of the threshold for allergic reactivity to chromium |first = David |last = Basketter |journal = Contact Dermatitis |volume = 44 |issue = 2 |pages = 70–74 |year = 2000 |doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0536.2001.440202.x |last2 = Horev |first2 = L. |last3 = Slodovnik |first3 = D.|last4 = Merimes |first4 = S. |last5 = Trattner |first5 = A.|last6 = Ingber |first6 = A. |pmid = 11205406 }}</ref>

===Environmental issues===
As chromium compounds were used in [[dye]]s and [[paint]]s and the [[tanning]] of [[leather]], these compounds are often found in soil and [[groundwater]] at abandoned industrial sites, now needing [[environmental cleanup]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] per the treatment of [[brownfield land]]. [[Primer (paint)|Primer paint]] containing hexavalent chromium is still widely used for [[aerospace]] and [[automobile]] refinishing applications.<ref>{{Cite book|first = Randall C.|last = Baselt|title = Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man|edition = 8th|publisher = Biomedical Publications|year = 2008 |pages = 305–307|isbn = 978-0-9626523-7-0|place = Foster City}}</ref>

In 2010, the [[Environmental Working Group]] studied the drinking water in 35 American cities. The study was the first nationwide analysis measuring the presence of the chemical in U.S. water systems. The study found measurable hexavalent chromium in the tap water of 31 of the cities sampled, with [[Norman, Oklahoma]], at the top of list; 25 cities had levels that exceeded California's proposed limit.<ref>{{cite news

Note: Concentrations of Cr(VI) in US municipal drinking water supplies reported by EWG are within likely, natural background levels for the areas tested and not necessarily indicative of industrial pollution [http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/lahontan/water_issues/projects/pge/docs/pge_background_study_faq2.pdf (CalEPA Fact Sheet)], as asserted by EWG. This factor was not taken into consideration in their report.
