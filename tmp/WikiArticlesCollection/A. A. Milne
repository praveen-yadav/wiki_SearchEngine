'''Alan Alexander Milne''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɪ|l|n}} (18 January 1882 – 31 January 1956) was an English author, best known for his books about the [[teddy bear]] [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] and for various children's poems. Milne was a noted writer, primarily as a playwright, before the huge success of Pooh overshadowed all his previous work.

==Biography==
A. A.

Milne's work came to the attention of the leading British humour magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', where Milne was to become a contributor and later an assistant editor.

Milne joined the [[British Army]] in World War I and served as an officer in the [[Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers|Royal Warwickshire Regiment]] and later, after a debilitating illness, the [[Royal Corps of Signals]]. He was recruited into Military Intelligence to write propaganda articles for MI 7b between 1916 and 1918. He was discharged on 14 February 1919,<ref>{{cite book| last = Finch| first = Christopher| title = Disney's Winnie the Pooh: A Celebration of the Silly Old Bear| url = http://books.google.com/?id=aJt8beaKgb8C&pg=PA18| year = 2000| publisher = Disney Editions| isbn = 978-0-7868-6352-5| page = 18 }}</ref> and settled in Mallord Street, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite news|title=For sale: Winnie-the-Pooh creator A A Milne's home|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/buyingsellingandmoving/9957606/For-sale-Winnie-the-Pooh-creator-A-A-Milnes-home.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph}}</ref> 

After the war, he wrote a denunciation of war titled ''Peace with Honour'' (1934), which he retracted somewhat with 1940's ''War with Honour''.<ref name="ODNBthwaite" /><ref>Capitalization as in the [[British Library]] Catalogue</ref> During World War II, Milne was one of the most prominent critics of English  writer [[P. G. Wodehouse]], who was captured at his country home in France by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and imprisoned for a year. Wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment, which were broadcast from Berlin. Although the light-hearted broadcasts made fun of the Germans, Milne accused Wodehouse of committing an act of near [[treason]] by cooperating with his country's enemy. Wodehouse got some revenge on his former friend (e.g. in [[The Mating Season (novel)|The Mating Season]]) by creating fatuous parodies of the Christopher Robin poems in some of his later stories, and claiming that Milne "was probably jealous of all other writers.... But I loved his stuff."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.theparisreview.com/media/3773_WODEHOUSE.pdf |title=The Art of Fiction – P.G.

Milne married Dorothy "Daphne" de Sélincourt in 1913, and their only son, [[Christopher Robin Milne]], was born in 1920. In 1925, A. A. Milne bought a country home, Cotchford Farm, in [[Hartfield]], East Sussex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pastscape.english-heritage.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=618520#|title=Cotchford Farm|work=National Monument Records|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=2008-09-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081012054412/http://pastscape.english-heritage.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=618520| archivedate= 12 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
During World War II, A. A. Milne was Captain of the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] in Hartfield & Forest Row, insisting on being plain 'Mr. Milne' to the members of his platoon. He retired to the farm after a stroke and brain surgery in 1952 left him an invalid, and by August 1953 "he seemed very old and disenchanted".<ref>{{cite web | title=Letter La Z 5 July 1917 – John Middleton Murry to Beatrice Elvery |date=1953-08-12 |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/lss/services/mss/collections/online-mss-catalogues/cats/laz4-5cat.html#laz57 |publisher=George Lazarus Collection |accessdate=2008-06-09 }}</ref> Milne died in January 1956, aged 74.

==Literary career==

===1903 to 1925===
After graduating from Cambridge in 1903, A. A. Milne contributed humorous verse and whimsical essays to ''Punch'',<ref>{{cite journal | last = Milne | first = A. A. | year = 1904 | month = August | title = Lillian's Loves | journal=[[Punch (magazine)|Punch, or the London Charivari]] | volume = 127 | issue = 24 August 1904 | pages = 142 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Milne | first = A.

During this period he published 18 plays and 3 novels, including the murder mystery ''[[The Red House Mystery]]'' (1922).  His son was born in August 1920 and in 1924 Milne produced a collection of children's poems ''[[When We Were Very Young]]'', which were illustrated by ''Punch'' staff cartoonist [[E. H. Shepard]].  A collection of short stories for children ''Gallery of Children'', and other stories that became part of the Winnie-the-Pooh books, were first published in 1925.

Milne was an early screenwriter for the nascent British film industry, writing four stories filmed in 1920 for the company Minerva Films (founded in 1920 by the actor [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] and his friend and story editor [[Adrian Brunel]]).  These were ''The Bump'', starring [[Aubrey Smith]]; ''Twice Two''; ''Five Pound Reward''; and ''Bookworms''<ref>{{cite book| last = Eforgan| first = E.| title = Leslie Howard: The Lost Actor| year = 2010| isbn = 978-0-85303-971-6 }}</ref> Some of these films survive in the archives of the [[British Film Institute]]. Milne had met Howard when the actor starred in Milne’s play ''Mr Pim Passes By'' in London.<ref>{{cite book| author = Thomas Burnett Swann| title = A. A. Milne| url = http://books.google.com/?id=JwlbAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA41| year = 1971| publisher = Twayne Publishers| page = 41 }}</ref>

Looking back on this period (in 1926), Milne observed that when he told his agent that he was going to write a detective story, he was told that what the country wanted from a "''Punch'' humorist" was a humorous story; when two years later he said he was writing nursery rhymes, his agent and publisher were convinced he should write another detective story; and after another two years, he was being told that writing a detective story would be in the worst of taste given the demand for children's books. He concluded that "the only excuse which I have yet discovered for writing anything is that I want to write it; and I should be as proud to be delivered of a Telephone Directory ''con amore'' as I should be ashamed to create a Blank Verse Tragedy at the bidding of others."<ref name="RedHouseMystery_Intro">{{cite book |last=Milne |first=Alan Alexander |title=[[The Red House Mystery]] |origyear=1922 |year=1926 |publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] |location=London  |pages=ix–xii |chapter=Introduction (dated April 1926) |accessdate=2008-05-21 }}</ref>

===1926 to 1928===
[[File:The original Winnie the Pooh toys.jpg|thumb|right|The real stuffed toys owned by Christopher Robin Milne and featured in the ''Winnie-the-Pooh'' stories. They are on display in the [[Stephen A. Schwarzman Building]] (formerly the [[New York Public Library Main Branch]]) in New York.]]
Milne is most famous for his two ''Pooh'' books about a boy named [[Christopher Robin]] after his son, [[Christopher Robin Milne]], and various characters inspired by his son's stuffed animals, most notably the bear named [[Winnie-the-Pooh]]. Christopher Robin Milne's stuffed bear, originally named "Edward",<ref>[http://nypl.org/locations/tid/36/node/5557 Winnie-the-Pooh] at the [[New York Public Library]]</ref> was renamed "Winnie-the-Pooh" after a Canadian [[American Black Bear|black bear]] named [[Winnipeg bear|Winnie]] (after Winnipeg), which was used as a military mascot in World War I, and left to [[London Zoo]] during the war. "The pooh" comes from a swan called "Pooh". [[E. H. Shepard]] illustrated the original Pooh books, using his own son's teddy, Growler ("a magnificent bear"), as the model. The rest of Christopher Robin Milne's toys, [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]], [[Eeyore]], Kanga, Roo and [[Tigger]], were incorporated into A. A. Milne's stories,<ref name="Express"/><ref name = "birthday"/> two more characters - Rabbit and Owl - were created by Milne's imagination. Christopher Robin Milne's own toys are now under glass in New York.

The fictional [[Hundred Acre Wood]] of the Pooh stories derives from Five Hundred Acre Wood in [[Ashdown Forest]] in East Sussex, South East England, where the Pooh stories were set. Milne lived on the northern edge of the Forest and took his son walking there. E. H. Shepard drew on the landscapes of Ashdown Forest as inspiration for many of the illustrations he provided for the Pooh books. The adult Christopher Robin commented: "Pooh's Forest and Ashdown Forest are identical".<ref name="Express"/> The wooden Pooh Bridge in Ashdown Forest, where Pooh and Piglet invented [[Poohsticks]], is a tourist attraction.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-11380115 Plans to improve access to Pooh Bridge unveiled] BBC. Retrieved 15 October 2011</ref>

Not yet known as Pooh, he made his first appearance in a poem, "Teddy Bear", published in the British magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in February, 1924. Pooh first appeared in the ''[[London Evening News]]'' on Christmas Eve, 1925, in a story called "The Wrong Sort Of Bees".<ref name = "birthday">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4552940.stm "Pooh celebrates his 80th birthday"]. BBC. Retrieved 11 November 2012</ref> ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh (book)|Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' was published in 1926, followed by ''[[The House at Pooh Corner]]'' in 1928. A second collection of nursery rhymes, ''[[Now We Are Six]]'', was published in 1927. All three books were illustrated by E. H. Shepard. Milne also published four plays in this period. He also "gallantly stepped forward" to contribute a quarter of the costs of dramatising P. G. Wodehouse's ''A Damsel in Distress''.<ref>{{cite book| author = David A Jasen| title = P.G. Wodehouse: A Portrait of a Master| url = http://books.google.com/?id=9L2kjKQ8CvYC&pg=PA114| year = 2002| publisher = Music Sales Group| isbn = 978-0-85712-754-9| page = 114 }}</ref>  His book ''The World of Pooh'' won the [[Lewis Carroll Shelf Award]] in 1958.

===1929 onwards===
The success of his children's books was to become a source of considerable annoyance to Milne, whose self-avowed aim was to write whatever he pleased and who had, until then, found a ready audience for each change of direction: he had freed pre-war ''Punch'' from its ponderous facetiousness; he had made a considerable reputation as a playwright (like his idol [[J. M. Barrie]]) on both sides of the Atlantic; he had produced a witty piece of detective writing in [[The Red House Mystery]] (although this was severely criticised by [[Raymond Chandler]] for the implausibility of its plot). But once Milne had, in his own words, "said goodbye to all that in 70,000 words" (the approximate length of his four principal children's books), he had no intention of producing any reworkings lacking in originality, given that one of the sources of inspiration, his son, was growing older.

His reception remained warmer in America than Britain, and he continued to publish novels and short stories, but by the late 1930s, the audience for Milne's grown-up writing had largely vanished: he observed bitterly in his autobiography that a critic had said that the hero of his latest play (''God help it'') was simply "Christopher Robin grown up...what an obsession with me children are become!".

Even his old literary home, ''Punch'', where the ''When We Were Very Young'' verses had first appeared, was ultimately to reject him, as Christopher Milne details in his autobiography ''The Enchanted Places'', although Methuen continued to publish whatever Milne wrote, including the long poem 'The Norman Church' and an assembly of articles entitled ''Year In, Year Out'' (which Milne likened to a benefit night for the author).

He also adapted [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' for the stage as ''[[Toad of Toad Hall]]''. The title was an implicit admission that such chapters as Chapter 7, "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn", could not survive translation to the theatre. A special introduction written by Milne is included in some editions of Grahame's novel.

The rights to A. A. Milne's Pooh books were left to four beneficiaries: his family, the [[Royal Literary Fund]], [[Westminster School]] and the [[Garrick Club]].<ref name = "rights">{{cite news| title= A bit of a stink at the Garrick over Winnie the Pooh's pot of money| first= Ann |last= Treneman |newspaper= The Independent |date=4 August 1998 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/a-bit-of-a-stink-at-the-garrick-over-winnie-the-poohs-pot-of-money-1169463.html |accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref> After Milne's death in 1956, his widow sold her rights to the Pooh characters to Stephen Slesinger, whose widow sold the rights after Slesinger's death to [[the Walt Disney Company]], which has made many Pooh cartoon movies, a [[Disney Channel]] television show, as well as Pooh-related merchandise. In 2001, the other beneficiaries sold their interest in the estate to the Disney Corporation for $350m. Previously Disney had been paying twice-yearly royalties to these beneficiaries. The estate of [[E. H. Shepard]] also received a sum in the deal.

Several of Milne's children's poems were set to music by the composer [[Harold Fraser-Simson]]. 

His poems have been parodied many times, including with the books ''When We Were Rather Older'' and ''Now We Are Sixty''.

==Religious views==
Milne did not speak out much on the subject of religion, although he used religious terms to explain his decision, while remaining a pacifist, to join the army:  "In fighting Hitler", he wrote, "we are truly fighting the Devil, the Anti-Christ ... Hitler was a crusader against God."<ref>{{cite book

His best known comment on the subject was recalled on his death:
