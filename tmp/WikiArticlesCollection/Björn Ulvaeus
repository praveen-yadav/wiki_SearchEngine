===Career===
[[File:Hootenanny Singers.jpg|thumb|left|Björn Ulvaeus with The Hootenanny Singers.]]
Prior to gaining international recognition with ABBA, Ulvaeus was a member of the Swedish folk-[[schlager]] band [[Hootenanny Singers]], who had an enormous following in Scandinavia. While on the road in southern Sweden in 1966, they encountered the [[Hep Stars]], and Ulvaeus quickly became friends with the group’s keyboard player, [[Benny Andersson]]. The two musicians shared a passion for songwriting, and each found a composing partner in the other. On meeting again that summer, they composed their first song together: "Isn't It Easy To Say", a song soon to be recorded by Andersson's group. The two continued teaming up for music, helping out each other's bands in the recording studio, and adding guitar or keyboards respectively to the recordings. In 1968, they composed two songs together: "A Flower In My Garden", recorded by Hep Stars, and their first 'real' hit "Ljuva Sextiotal", for which [[Stig Anderson]] wrote lyrics.  The latter – a cabarét-style ironic song about the 1960s – was submitted for the 1969 Swedish heats for [[Eurovision|Eurovision Song Contest]], but was rejected; it was later recorded by diva [[Brita Borg]]. Another hit came in 1969 with "Speleman", also recorded by Hep Stars.

While filming a nostalgic schlager special for television in March 1969, Björn met eighteen-year-old singer-songwriter [[Agnetha Fältskog]]. Benny had himself met his future spouse, 23-year-old jazz and schlager vocalist [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], only weeks before.

Björn Ulvaeus continued recording and touring with Hootenanny Singers to great acclaim while working as in-house producer at [[Polar Record Company]] (headed by future manager [[Stig Anderson]]), with Benny as his new partner. The twosome produced records by other artists and continued writing songs together. Polar artist Arne Lamberts Swedish version of "A Flower In My Garden" – "Fröken Blåklint" – was one of Björn & Benny's first in-house productions. In December 1969, they recorded the new song "She's My Kind Of Girl", which became their first single as a duo.  It was released in March 1970, giving them a minor hit in Sweden (and by chance a top-ten hit in Japan two years later).

The Hootenanny Singers entered [[Svensktoppen]], the Swedish radio charts, in 1970 with "Omkring Tiggarn Från Luossa", a cover of an old folk-schlager song.  It remained on the charts for 52 consecutive weeks, a record which endured until 1990; the song was produced by Björn and Benny, and had Ulvaeus's solo vocal and Benny's piano.

After ABBA, Ulvaeus, together with Andersson, created the musicals ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', ''[[Kristina från Duvemåla]]'' (based on ''[[The Emigrants (novels)|The Emigrants]]'' novels by Swedish writer [[Vilhelm Moberg]]), and ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' (based on ABBA songs).

Together with Andersson, Ulvaeus was nominated for the [[Drama Desk Award]] in the category "Outstanding Music" (for the musical ''Chess''), and for a [[Tony Award]] in a category "Best Orchestrations" (for musical ''Mamma Mia!''). Original cast recordings of both musicals were nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].

For the 2004 semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], staged in Istanbul thirty years after [[ABBA]] had won the contest in Brighton, Ulvaeus appeared briefly in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled "Our Last Video". Each of the four members of the group appeared briefly in cameo roles, as did others such as [[Cher]] and [[Rik Mayall]]. The video was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release. It was billed as the first time the four had worked together since the group split. In fact, they each filmed their appearances separately.

Ulvaeus also shared with Andersson "The Special International [[Ivor Novello]] Award" from 'The British Academy of Composers and Songwriters', "The Music Export Prize" from the Swedish Ministry of Industry and Trade (2008),<ref>[http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/11367/a/118215 "The Government's Music Export Prize for 2008 goes to..."]. Sweden.gov.se (7 January 2009). Retrieved on 2013-07-22.</ref> and "Lifetime Achievement Award" from the Swedish Music Publishers Association (SMFF).

On 15 April 2013, it was officially announced by the [[EBU]] and the [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] that Björn  along with the ex-[[ABBA]] member, [[Benny Andersson]] and the [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[DJ]] and [[record producer]], [[Avicii]], have composed the anthem for the [[2013 Eurovision Song Contest]]. The song will be performed for the first time in the Final on 18 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=abbas_benny_bjoern_and_aviccii_to_write_eurovision_anthem|title=ABBA's Benny, Björn and Avicii to write 'Eurovision anthem'|work=[[EBU]]|accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref>

===Personal life===
On 6 July 1971, Ulvaeus married [[Agnetha Fältskog]]; the marriage resulted in two children: [[Linda Ulvaeus|Linda Elin Ulvaeus]] (born 23 February 1973), and Peter Christian Ulvaeus (born 4 December 1977). In July 1980, Björn and Agnetha divorced, although they both agreed to remain in ABBA. Ulvaeus then married music journalist Lena Kallersjö on 6 January 1981. This marriage produced another two daughters: Emma (born in 1982) and Anna (born in 1986).

Ulvaeus and Kallersjö currently live in [[Stockholm]]. From 1984 to 1990 they resided in the UK, where Ulvaeus founded an IT-business together with his brother.

He is also one of four people (also including [[Per Gessle]]) who own NoteHeads, a Swedish company which publishes the [[Scorewriter|music notation program]] [[Igor Engraver]].<ref>{{cite web

Ulvaeus is a member of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]'s Swedish member organisation  [[Humanisterna]], and was awarded their annual prize, ''Hedenius-priset'', in 2006.  Ulvaeus describes himself as a "freethinker," rather than an atheist.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20120207141100/http://www.iheu.org/node/2298 Björn Ulvaeus speaks on Humanism]. ''International Humanist'' interview (14 July 2006 )</ref>

In 2008, Ulvaeus revealed that he suffered from severe long-term memory loss and now no longer remembers many important events in his life.  He now has little memory of some of the critical events in his professional history and has resorted to images of his past and even hypnotism to try to bring back his memory.<ref>{{cite news

===Tax vindication===

The Swedish Tax Board accused Björn Ulvaeus of failing to pay 90 million kronor (US$12.8 million) in back taxes for eight years ending in 2005. They claimed that he "laundered" his music royalty income through institutions in several foreign countries. Ulvaeus paid the taxes as a precautionary measure during the 2½-year dispute. In October 2008, the county administrative court decided the case in Ulvaeus’ favour, ruling that he never owed any of the 90 million kronor.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/music/abba-star-bjorn-wins-17m-tax-case/2008/10/15/1223750070878.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=ABBA's Bjorn wins $17m tax case | date=15 October 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b54103_swedens_taxman_after_abbas_ulvaeus_again.html Sweden's Taxman After ABBA's Ulvaeus Again – E!
