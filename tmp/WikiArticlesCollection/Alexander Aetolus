'''Alexander Aetolus''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Αἰτωλός}}) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] poet and grammarian, the only known representative of Aetolian poetry.<ref name="DGRBM">{{cite encyclopedia  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard | authorlink =  | title = Alexander | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]  | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 111  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | location = Boston  | year = 1867  | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0120.html }}</ref>  He was the son of Satyrus and Stratocleia, and was a native of [[Pleuron, Aetolia|Pleuron]] in [[Aetolia]], although he spent the greater part of his life at [[Alexandria]], where he was reckoned one of the seven tragic poets who constituted the [[Tragic Pleiad]].<ref>[[Suda]], ''s. v.''</ref><ref>Eudoc. p. 62</ref><ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' ii. 22. § 7</ref><ref>[[Scholiast]], ''ad [[Homer|Hom]] ''[[Iliad|Il.]] xvi. 233</ref>  He flourished about 280 BC, in the reign of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]].

He had an office in the [[Library of Alexandria]], and was commissioned by Ptolemy to make a collection of all the tragedies and satyric dramas that were extant.  He spent some time, together with [[Antagoras]] and [[Aratus]], at the court of [[Antigonus II Gonatas]].<ref>[[Aratus]], ''Phaenomena et Diosem.'' ii. pp. 431, 443, &c. 446, ed. Buhle</ref>  Notwithstanding the distinction he enjoyed as a tragic poet, he appears to have had greater merit as a writer of epic poems, [[elegy|elegies]], [[epigram]]s, and cynaedi.  Among his [[epic poem]]s, we possess the titles and some fragments of three pieces: the ''Fisherman'',<ref>{{lang|grc|ἁλιεὺς}}, [[Athenaeus]], vii. p. 296</ref> ''Kirka'' or ''Krika'',<ref>[[Athenaeus]], vii. p. 283</ref> which, however, is designated by [[Athenaeus]] as doubtful, and ''Helena'',<ref>[[August Immanuel Bekker]], ''Anecdota Graeca'' p. 96</ref>  Of his elegies, some beautiful fragments are still extant.<ref>[[Athenaeus]], iv. p. 170, xi. p. 496, xv. p. 899</ref><ref>[[Strabo]], xii. p. 556, xiv. p. 681</ref><ref>Parthen. ''Erot.'' 4</ref><ref>[[John Tzetzes]], ''ad. Lycophron'' 266.</ref><ref>[[Scholiast]] and [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]], ''ad [[Iliad|Il.]] iii. 314</ref>  His Cynaedi, or ''Ionic poems'' ({{lang|grc|Ἰωνικὰ ποιήματα}}), are mentioned by [[Strabo]]<ref>[[Strabo]], xiv. p. 648</ref> and [[Athenaeus]].<ref>[[Athenaeus]], xiv. p. 620</ref>  Some [[anapaest]]ic verses in praise of [[Euripides]] are preserved in [[Aulus Gellius|Gellius]].<ref>[[Aulus Gellius]], xv. 20</ref>
