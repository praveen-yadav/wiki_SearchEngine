==Geography==

===Area 51===
[[File:Wfm area51 map en.png|thumb|Map showing Area&nbsp;51, [[Nellis Air Force Range|NAFR]], and the [[Nevada Test Site|NTS]] ]]
The original rectangular base of {{convert|6|by|10|mi|km}} is now part of the so-called "Groom box", a rectangular area measuring {{convert|23|by|25|mi|km}}, of restricted airspace. The area is connected to the internal [[Nevada Test Site]] (NTS) road network, with paved roads leading south to [[Mercury, Nevada|Mercury]] and west to Yucca Flat. Leading northeast from the lake, the wide and well-maintained Groom Lake Road runs through a pass in the Jumbled Hills. The road formerly led to mines in the Groom basin, but has been improved since their closure. Its winding course runs past a security checkpoint, but the restricted area around the base extends further east. After leaving the restricted area, Groom Lake Road descends eastward to the floor of the Tikaboo Valley, passing the dirt-road entrances to several small ranches, before converging with [[Nevada State Route 375|State Route 375, the "Extraterrestrial Highway"]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/04/13/travel/escapes/13extraterrestrial.html|title=Lonesome Highway to Another World?|accessdate=8 July 2007|author=Regenold, Stephen|date=13 April 2007|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> south of [[Rachel, Nevada|Rachel]].

Area 51 shares a border with the [[Yucca Flat]] region of the Nevada Test Site, the location of 739 of the 928 nuclear tests conducted by the [[United States Department of Energy]] at NTS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf|title=US Department of Energy.

==History==
The origin of the Area 51 name is unclear.  The most accepted comes from a grid numbering system of the area by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC); while Area 51 isn't part of this system it is adjacent to Area 15.  Another explanation is that 51 was used because it was unlikely that the AEC would use the number.<ref>{{cite news|last=Strickland|first=Jonathan|title=How Area 51 Works|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/space/aliens-ufos/area-51.htm#mkcpgn=fb6|newspaper=How Stuff Work}}</ref>

===U-2 program===
{{Main|Lockheed U-2}}

The Groom Lake test facility was established by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) for ''Project Aquatone'', the development of the [[Lockheed U-2]] strategic reconnaissance aircraft in April 1955.

As part of the project, the director, [[Richard M. Bissell, Jr.]], understood that, given the extreme secrecy enveloping the project, the flight test and pilot training programs could not be conducted at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] or Lockheed's Palmdale facility. A search for a suitable testing site for the U-2 was conducted under the same extreme security as the rest of the project.<ref name="Peebles">{{cite book|title=Dark Eagles, Revised Edition|publisher=Presidio Press|author=Peebles, Curtis|year=1999|location=Novato, CA|isbn=0-89141-696-X}}</ref>

He notified Lockheed, who sent an inspection team out to Groom Lake. According to Lockheed's U-2 designer [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]]:<ref name="Peebles"/> {{quote|1=...&nbsp;We flew over it and within thirty seconds, you knew that was the place&nbsp;... it was right by a [[dry lake]]. Man alive, we looked at that lake, and we all looked at each other. It was another Edwards, so we wheeled around, landed on that lake, taxied up to one end of it. It was a perfect natural landing field&nbsp;... as smooth as a billiard table without anything being done to it". Johnson used a compass to lay out the direction of the first runway. The place was called "Groom Lake".}}

The lakebed made an ideal strip from which they could test aircraft, and the Emigrant Valley's mountain ranges and the NTS perimeter, about 100 miles north of Las Vegas, protected the test site from visitors.<ref name="shadow">{{cite book|title=Shadow Flights: America's Secret Air War Against the Soviet Union|publisher=Presidio Press|author=Peebles, Curtis|year=2000|location=Novato, CA|pages=141â€“144|isbn=978-0-89141-700-2|quote=I gave it a ten plus [score]&nbsp;... a dry lake bed around three and a half miles around", and describes [[Tony LeVier]] showing the lake to Johnson and Bissell, and Johnson deciding to locate the runway "at south end of lake}}</ref> The CIA asked the AEC to acquire the land, designated "Area 51" on the map, and add it to the Nevada Test Site.<ref name="cia1992">{{cite book|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB434/|title=The Central Intelligence Agency and Overhead Reconnaissance: The U-2 and OXCART Programs, 1954-1974|publisher=History Staff, Central Intelligence Agency|author=Pedlow, Gregory W.; Welzenbach, Donald E.|year=1992|location=Washington DC}}</ref>{{rp|56â€“57}}

Johnson named the area "Paradise Ranch" to encourage workers to move to a place that the CIA's official history of the U-2 project would later describe as "the new facility in the middle of nowhere"; the name became shortened to "the Ranch".{{r|cia1992}}{{rp|57}} On 4 May 1955, a survey team arrived at Groom Lake and laid out a {{convert|5000|ft|m|adj=on}}, north-south runway on the southwest corner of the lakebed and designated a site for a base support facility. "The Ranch", also known as Site II, initially consisted of little more than a few shelters, workshops and trailer homes in which to house its small team.<ref name="shadow" /> In a little over three months, the base consisted of a single, paved runway, three hangars, a control tower, and rudimentary accommodations for test personnel. The base's few amenities included a movie theatre and volleyball court. Additionally, there was a mess hall, several water wells, and fuel storage tanks. By July 1955, CIA, Air Force, and Lockheed personnel began arriving. The Ranch received its first U-2 delivery on 24 July 1955 from Burbank on a [[C-124 Globemaster II]] cargo plane, accompanied by Lockheed technicians on a [[Douglas DC-3]].<ref name="shadow" /> Regular [[Military Air Transport Service]] flights were set up between Area 51 and Lockheed's [[Burbank, California]] offices. To preserve secrecy, personnel flew to Nevada on Monday mornings and returned to California on Friday evenings.{{r|cia1992}}{{rp|72}}

Four years of "Project 51" construction began on 1 October 1960 by Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company (REECo) with double-shift construction schedules.  The contractor upgraded base facilities and built a new {{Convert|10000|ft|abbr=on}} runway (14/32) diagonally across the southwest corner of the lakebed. An Archimedes curve approximately two miles across was marked on the dry lake so that an A-12 pilot approaching the end of the overrun could abort to the [[dry lake|playa]] instead of plunging the aircraft into the [[sagebrush]]. Area 51 pilots called it "The Hook". For crosswind landings two unpaved airstrips (runways 9/27 and 03/21) were marked on the dry lakebed.<ref name="TheOxcartStory">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol15no1/html/v15i1a01p_0001.htm |title=The Oxcart Story|publisher=Cia.gov|date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}</ref>

By August 1961, construction of the essential facilities was completed (3 surplus [[United States Navy|Navy]] hangars were erected on the base's north sideâ€”hangars 4, 5, and 6.)  A fourth, Hangar 7, was new construction. The original U-2 hangars were converted to maintenance and machine shops. Facilities in the main cantonment area included workshops and buildings for storage and administration, a commissary, control tower, fire station, and housing. The Navy also contributed more than 130 surplus Babbitt duplex housing units for long-term occupancy facilities. Older buildings were repaired, and additional facilities were constructed as necessary. A reservoir pond, surrounded by trees, served as a recreational area one mile north of the base. Other recreational facilities included a gymnasium, movie theatre, and a baseball diamond.<ref name="TheOxcartStory"/> A permanent aircraft fuel tank farm was constructed by early 1962 for the special [[JP-7]] fuel required by the A-12. Seven tanks were constructed, with a total capacity of 1,320,000 gallons.

For the arrival of OXCART; security was enhanced and the small civilian mine{{Specify|reason=name? coordinates?|date=October 2013}} in the Groom basin was closed. In January 1962, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) expanded the restricted airspace in the vicinity of Groom Lake. The lakebed became the center of a 600-square-mile addition to restricted area R-4808N.<ref name="TheOxcartStory"/>

The CIA facility received eight USAF [[F-101 Voodoo]]s for training, two [[T-33 Shooting Star]] trainers for proficiency flying, a [[C-130 Hercules]] for cargo transport, a U-3A for administrative purposes, a helicopter for search and rescue, and a [[Cessna 180]] for liaison use; and Lockheed provided an [[F-104 Starfighter]] for use as a [[chase plane]].<ref name="TheOxcartStory"/>

Although it was decided{{Who|date=October 2013}} on 10 January 1967 to phase out the CIA A-12 program, A-12s at Groom Lake occasionally deployed to [[Kadena AB]], Okinawa, for [[Project Black Shield]] in 1967{{r|Timeline}} (the 9 A-12s were stored at Palmdale in June 1968 and the 1129th SAS was inactivated.)<ref name="1129CIA"/>

===D-21 Tagboard===
{{Main|Lockheed D-21}}
[[File:M21Ship2-cropped.jpg|thumb|The D-21 mounted on the back of the M-21. Note the intake cover on the drone, which was used on early flights.]]

Following the loss of [[Gary Powers]]' [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] over the Soviet Union, there were several discussions about using the A-12 OXCART as an unpiloted drone aircraft. Although Kelly Johnson had come to support the idea of drone reconnaissance, he opposed the development of an A-12 drone, contending that the aircraft was too large and complex for such a conversion. However, the Air Force agreed to fund the study of a high-speed, high-altitude drone aircraft in October 1962. The air force interest seems to have moved the CIA to take action, the project designated "Q-12". By October 1963, the drone's design had been finalized. At the same time, the Q-12 underwent a name change. To separate it from the other A-12-based projects, it was renamed the "D-21". (The "12" was reversed to "21"). "Tagboard" was the project's code name.<ref name="Peebles"/>

The first D-21 was completed in the spring of 1964 by Lockheed. After four more months of checkouts and static tests, the aircraft was shipped to Groom Lake and reassembled. It was to be carried by a two-seat derivative of the A-12, designated the "M-21". When the D-21/M-21 reached the launch point, the first step would be to blow off the D-21's inlet and exhaust covers. With the D-21/M-21 at the correct speed and altitude, the LCO would start the ramjet and the other systems of the D-21. With the D-21's systems activated and running, and the launch aircraft at the correct point, the M-21 would begin a slight pushover, the LCO would push a final button, and the D-21 would come off the pylon".<ref name="Peebles"/>

Difficulties were addressed throughout 1964 and 1965 at Groom Lake with various technical issues. Captive flights showed unforeseen aerodynamic difficulties. By late January 1966, more than a year after the first captive flight, everything seemed ready. The first D-21 launch was made on 5 March 1966 with a successful flight, with the D-21 flying 120 miles with limited fuel. A second D-12 flight was successful in April 1966 with the drone flying 1,200 miles, reaching Mach 3.3 and 90,000 feet. An accident on 30 July 1966 with a fully fueled D-21, on a planned checkout flight suffered from a non-start of the drone after its separation, causing it to collide with the M-21 launch aircraft. The two crewmen ejected and landed in the ocean 150 miles offshore. One crew member was picked up by a helicopter, but the other, having survived the aircraft breakup and ejection, drowned when sea water entered his pressure suit. Kelly Johnson personally cancelled the entire program, having had serious doubts from the start of the feasibility. A number of D-21s had already been produced, and rather than scrapping the whole effort, Johnson again proposed to the Air Force that they be launched from a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H]] bomber.<ref name="Peebles"/>

By late summer of 1967, the modification work to both the D-21 (now designated D-21B) and the B-52Hs were complete. The test program could now resume. The test missions were flown out of Groom Lake, with the actual launches over the Pacific. The first D-21B to be flown was Article 501, the prototype. The first attempt was made on 28 September 1967, and ended in complete failure. As the B-52 was flying toward the launch point, the D-21B fell off the pylon. The B-52H gave a sharp lurch as the drone fell free. The booster fired and was "quite a sight from the ground". The failure was traced to a stripped nut on the forward right attachment point on the pylon. Several more tests were made, none of which met with success. However, the fact is that the resumptions of D-21 tests took place against a changing reconnaissance background. The A-12 had finally been allowed to deploy, and the [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71]] was soon to replace it. At the same time, new developments in reconnaissance satellite technology were nearing operation. Up to this point, the limited number of satellites available restricted coverage to the Soviet Union. A new generation of reconnaissance satellites could soon cover targets anywhere in the world. The satellites' resolution would be comparable to that of aircraft, but without the slightest political risk. Time was running out for the Tagboard.<ref name="Peebles"/>

Several more test flights, including two over [[China]], were made from [[Beale AFB]], California, in 1969 and 1970, to varying degrees of success. On 15 July 1971, Kelly Johnson received a wire canceling the D-21B program. The remaining drones were transferred by a C-5A and placed in dead storage. The tooling used to build the D-21Bs was ordered destroyed. Like the A-12 Oxcart, the D-21B Tagboard drones remained a Black airplane, even in retirement. Their existence was not suspected until August 1976, when the first group was placed in storage at the [[Davis-Monthan AFB]] [[Military Storage and Disposition Center]]. A second group arrived in 1977. They were labeled "GTD-21Bs" (GT stood for ground training).<ref name="Peebles"/>

Davis-Monthan is an open base, with public tours of the storage area at the time, so the odd-looking drones were soon spotted and photos began appearing in magazines. Speculation about the D-21Bs circulated within aviation circles for years, and it was not until 1982 that details of the Tagboard program were released. However, it was not until 1993 that the B-52/D-21B program was made public. That same year, the surviving D-21Bs were released to museums.<ref name="Peebles"/>

During the [[Cold War]], one of the missions carried out by the United States was the test and evaluation of captured [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] fighter aircraft. Beginning in the late 1960s, and for several decades, Area 51 played host to an assortment of Soviet-built aircraft. Under the ''HAVE DOUGHNUT'', ''HAVE DRILL'' and ''HAVE FERRY'' programs, the first MiGs flown in the United States were used to evaluate the aircraft in performance, technical, and operational capabilities, pitting the types against U.S. fighters.<ref name="Red Eagles">Steve Davies: "Red Eagles. America's Secret MiGs", Osprey Publishing, 2008</ref>

This was not a new mission, as testing of foreign technology by the USAF began during World War II. After the war, testing of acquired foreign technology was performed by the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC, which became very influential during the Korean War), under the direct command of the Air Materiel Control Department. In 1961 ATIC became the Foreign Technology Division (FTD), and was reassigned to [[Air Force Systems Command]]. ATIC personnel were sent anywhere where foreign aircraft could be found.

The focus of [[Air Force Systems Command]] limited the use of the fighter as a tool with which to train the [[front line]] tactical fighter pilots.<ref name="Red Eagles"/> Air Force Systems Command recruited its pilots from the [[Air Force Flight Test Center]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California, who were usually graduates from various test pilot schools. [[Tactical Air Command]] selected its pilots primarily from the ranks of the [[United States Air Force Weapons School|Weapons School]] graduates.<ref name="Red Eagles"/>

In August 1966, [[Iraqi Air Force]] fighter pilot Captain [[Munir Redfa]] [[List of Cold War pilot defections#Iraq|defected]], flying his [[MiG-21]] to [[Israel]] after being ordered to attack Iraqi Kurd villages with napalm. His aircraft was transferred to the Groom Lake within a month to study. In 1968 the US Air Force and Navy jointly formed a project known as ''Have Doughnut'' in which Air Force Systems Command, Tactical Air Command, and the U.S. Navy's Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Four (VX-4) flew this acquired Soviet made aircraft in simulated air combat training.<ref name="Red Eagles"/> Because U.S. possession of the Soviet MiG-21 was, itself, secret, it was tested at Groom Lake. A joint air force-navy team was assembled for a series of dogfight tests.<ref name="Peebles"/>

Comparisons between the F-4 and the MiG-21 indicated that, on the surface, they were evenly matched. But air combat was not just about technology. In the final analysis, it was the skill of the man in the cockpit. The Have Doughnut tests showed this most strongly. When the Navy or Air Force pilots flew the MiG-21, the results were a draw; the F-4 would win some fights, the MiG-21 would win others. There were no clear advantages. The problem was not with the planes, but with the pilots flying them. The pilots would not fly either plane to its limits. One of the Navy pilots was Marland W. "Doc" Townsend, then commander of VF-121, the F-4 training squadron at NAS Miramar. He was an engineer and a Korean War veteran and had flown almost every navy aircraft. When he flew against the MiG-21, he would outmaneuver it every time. The Air Force pilots would not go vertical in the MiG-21. The Have Doughnut project officer was Tom Cassidy, a pilot with VX-4, the Navy's Air Development Squadron at Point Mugu. He had been watching as Townsend "waxed" the air force MiG-21 pilots. Cassidy climbed into the MiG-21 and went up against Townsend's F-4. This time the result was far different. Cassidy was willing to fight in the vertical, flying the plane to the point where it was buffeting, just above the stall. Cassidy was able to get on the F-4's tail. After the flight, they realized the MiG-21 turned better than the F-4 at lower speeds. The key was for the F-4 to keep its speed up. What had happened in the sky above Groom Lake was remarkable. An F-4 had defeated the MiG-21; the weakness of the Soviet plane had been found. Further test flights confirmed what was learned. It was also clear that the MiG-21 was a formidable enemy. United States pilots would have to fly much better than they had been to beat it. This would require a special school to teach advanced air combat techniques.<ref name="Peebles"/>

On 12 August 1968, two Syrian air force lieutenants, Walid Adham and Radfan Rifai, took off in a pair of [[MiG-17]]Fs on a training mission. They lost their way and, believing they were over Lebanon, landed at the Beset Landing Field in northern Israel. (One version has it that they were led astray by an Arabic-speaking Israeli).<ref name="Peebles"/> Prior to the end of 1968 these MiG-17s were transferred from Israeli stocks and added to the Area 51 test fleet. The aircraft were given USAF designations and fake serial numbers so that they could be identified in DOD standard flight logs. As in the earlier program, a small group of Air Force and Navy pilots conducted mock dogfights with the MiG-17s. Selected instructors from the Navy's Top Gun school at [[NAS Miramar]], California, were chosen to fly against the MiGs for familiarization purposes. Very soon, the MiG-17's shortcomings became clear. It had an extremely simple, even crude, control system which lacked the power-boosted controls of American aircraft. The F-4's twin engines were so powerful it could accelerate out of range of the MiG-17's guns in thirty seconds. It was important for the F-4 to keep its distance from the MiG-17. As long as the F-4 was one and a half miles from the MiG-17, it was outside the reach of the Soviet fighter's guns, but the MiG was within reach of the F-4's missiles.<ref name="Peebles"/>

The data from the Have Doughnut and Have Drill tests were provided to the newly formed [[United States Navy Fighter Weapons School|Top Gun]] school at [[NAS Miramar]]. By 1970, the Have Drill program was expanded; a few selected fleet F-4 crews were given the chance to fight the MiGs. The most important result of Project Have Drill is that no Navy pilot who flew in the project defeated the MiG-17 Fresco in the first engagement. The Have Drill dogfights were by invitation only. The other pilots based at Nellis Air Force Base were not to know about the U.S.-operated MiGs. To prevent any sightings, the airspace above the Groom Lake range was closed. On aeronautical maps, the exercise area was marked in red ink. The forbidden zone became known as "Red Square".<ref name="Peebles"/>

During the remainder of the Vietnam War, the Navy kill ratio climbed to 8.33 to 1. In contrast, the Air Force rate improved only slightly to 2.83 to 1. The reason for this difference was Top Gun. The Navy had revitalized its air combat training, while the Air Force had stayed stagnant. Most of the Navy MiG kills were by Top Gun graduates.

In May 1973, Project ''Have Idea'' was formed which took over from the older Have Doughnut, Have Ferry and Have Drill projects and the project was transferred to the [[Tonopah Test Range Airport]]. At Tonopah testing of foreign technology aircraft continued and expanded throughout the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name="Red Eagles"/>

Area 51 also hosted another foreign materiel evaluation program called HAVE GLIB. This involved testing Soviet tracking and missile control radar systems. A complex of actual and replica Soviet-type threat systems began to grow around "Slater Lake", a mile northwest of the main base, along with an acquired Soviet "Barlock" search radar placed at [[Tonopah Air Force Station]]. They were arranged to simulate a Soviet-style air defense complex.

The Air Force began funding improvements to Area 51 in 1977 under project SCORE EVENT. In 1979, the CIA transferred jurisdiction of the Area 51 site to the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, California. Mr. Sam Mitchell, the last CIA commander of Area 51, relinquished command to USAF Lt. Col. Larry D. McClain.

===Have Blue/F-117 program===

[[File:Have Blue bottom view.jpg|thumb|right|Underside view of ''Have Blue'']]
[[File:F-117 Nighthawk Front.jpg|thumb|right|F-117 flying over mountains]]
The [[Lockheed Have Blue]] prototype stealth fighter (a smaller proof-of-concept model of the [[F-117 Nighthawk]]) first flew at Groom in December 1977.<ref name="rich_haveblue">Rich, pp. 56â€“60</ref>

In 1978, the Air Force awarded a full-scale development contract for the F-117 to Lockheed Corporation's Advanced Development Projects. On 17 January 1981 the Lockheed test team at Area 51 accepted delivery of the first full Scale Development (FSD) prototype ''79â€“780'', designated YF-117A. At 6:05&nbsp;am on 18 June 1981 Lockheed Skunk Works test pilot Hal Farley lifted the nose of YF-117A ''79â€“780''' off the runway of Area 51.<ref name="F117hist">http://www.usafpatches.com/pubs/stealth.pdf</ref>

Meanwhile, [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC) decided to set up a group-level organization to guide the F-117A to an initial operating capability. That organization became the 4450th Tactical Group (Initially designated "A Unit"), which officially activated on 15 October 1979 at [[Nellis AFB]], Nevada, although the group was physically located at Area 51. The 4450th TG also operated the A-7D Corsair II as a surrogate trainer for the F-117A, and these operations continued until 15 October 1982 under the guise of an avionics test mission.<ref name="F117hist"/>

Flying squadrons of the 4450th TG were the 4450th Tactical Squadron (Initially designated "I Unit") activated on 11 June 1981, and 4451st Tactical Squadron (Initially designated "P Unit") on 15 January 1983. The 4450th TS, stationed at Area 51, was the first F-117A squadron, while the 4451st TS was stationed at Nellis AFB and was equipped with [[A-7D Corsair II]]s painted in a dark motif, tail coded "LV". Lockheed test pilots put the YF-117 through its early paces. A-7Ds was used for pilot training before any F-117A's had been delivered by Lockheed to Area 51, later the A-7D's were used for F-117A chase testing and other weapon tests at the Nellis Range.

15 October 1982 is important to the program because on that date Major Alton C. Whitley, Jr. became the first USAF 4450th TG pilot to fly the F-117A.<ref name="F117hist"/>

Although ideal for testing, Area 51 was not a suitable location for an operational group, so a new covert base had to be established for F-117 operations.<ref name="F117Area51">{{cite web|url=http://www.f-117a.com/Area51.html|title=Area 51 Test Site|publisher=F-117A|date=July 14, 2003|accessdate=2013-06-10}}</ref>
[[Tonopah Test Range Airport]] was selected for operations of the first USAF F-117 unit, the [[4450th Tactical Group]] (TG).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f-117a.com/4450th.html|title=4450th TG|publisher=F-117A|date=April 1, 2002|accessdate=2013-06-10}}</ref> From October 1979, the Tonopah Airport base was reconstructed and expanded. The 6,000&nbsp;ft runway was lengthened to 10,000&nbsp;ft. Taxiways, a concrete apron, a large maintenance hangar, and a propane storage tank were added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f-117a.com/Tonopah.html|title=Tonopah Test Range (TTR)|publisher=F-117A|date=July 14, 2003|accessdate=2013-06-10}}</ref>

By early 1982, four more YF-117A airplanes were operating out of the southern end of the base, known as the "Southend" or "Baja Groom Lake". After finding a large scorpion in their offices, the testing team (Designated "R Unit") adopted it as their mascot and dubbed themselves the "Baja Scorpions". Testing of a series of ultra-secret prototypes continued at Area 51 until mid-1981, when testing transitioned to the initial production of F-117 stealth fighters. The F-117s were moved to and from Area 51 by C-5 under the cloak of darkness, in order to maintain program security. This meant that the aircraft had to be defueled, disassembled, cradled, and then loaded aboard the C-5 at night, flown to Lockheed, and unloaded at night before the real work could begin. Of course, this meant that the reverse actions had to occur at the end of the depot work before the aircraft could be reassembled, flight-tested, and redelivered, again under the cover of darkness. In addition to flight-testing, Groom performed radar profiling, F-117 weapons testing, and was the location for training of the first group of frontline USAF F-117 pilots.

Production FSD airframes from Lockheed were shipped to Area 51 for acceptance testing. As the Baja Scorpions tested the aircraft with functional check flights and L.O. verification, the operational airplanes were then transferred to the 4450th TG.<ref name="BScorpions">{{cite web|url=http://www.f-117a.com/Baja.html|title=JTF "Baja Scorpions" of Groom Lake|publisher=F-117A|date=July 14, 2003|accessdate=2013-06-10}}</ref>

On 17 May 1982, the move of the 4450th TG from Groom Lake to Tonopah was initiated, with the final components of the move completed in early 1983. Production FSD airframes from Lockheed were shipped to Area 51 for acceptance testing. As the Baja Scorpions tested the aircraft with functional check flights and L.O. verification, the operational airplanes were then transferred to the 4450th TG at Tonopah.
<ref name="BScorpions"/>

The R-Unit was inactivated on 30 May 1989. Upon inactivation, the unit was reformed as Detachment 1, [[57th Fighter Weapons Wing]] (FWW). In 1990 the last F-117A (''843'') was delivered from Lockheed. After completion of acceptance flights at Area 51 of this last new F-117A aircraft, the flight test squadron continued flight test duties of refurbished aircraft after modifications by Lockheed. In February/March 1992 the test unit moved from Area 51 to the USAF Palmdale [[Plant 42]] and was integrated with the [[Air Force Systems Command]] [[6510th Test Squadron]]. Some testing, especially RCS verification and other classified activity was still conducted at Area 51 throughout the operational lifetime of the F-117. The recently inactivated (2008) [[410th Flight Test Squadron]] traces its roots, if not its formal lineage to the 4450th TG R-unit.

The amount of information the United States government has been willing to provide regarding Area 51 has generally been minimal.

Although federal property within the base is exempt from state and local taxes, facilities owned by private contractors are not.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

When documents that mention the [[Nevada Test Site]] (NTS) and operations at Groom are declassified, mentions of Area 51 and Groom Lake are routinely redacted.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} One exception is a 1967 memo from CIA director [[Richard Helms]] regarding the deployment of three [[Lockheed A-12|OXCART]] aircraft from Groom to [[Kadena Air Base]] to perform reconnaissance over [[North Vietnam]]. Although most mentions of OXCART's home base are redacted in this document, as is a map showing the aircraft's route from there to Okinawa, the redactor appears to have missed one mention: page 15 (page 17 in the PDF), section No. 2 ends "Three OXCART aircraft and the necessary task force personnel will be deployed from Area 51 to Kadena."<ref name="cia_oxcart_kadena" />

In July 2013, CIA released an official history of the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] and OXCART projects that officially acknowledged the existence of Area 51. The release was in response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted in 2005 by Jeffrey T.

In 1994, five unnamed civilian contractors and the widows of contractors Walter Kasza and Robert Frost sued the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]. Their suit, in which they were represented by [[George Washington University]] law professor [[Jonathan Turley]], alleged they had been present when large quantities of unknown chemicals had been burned in open pits and trenches at Groom. [[biopsy|Biopsies]] taken from the complainants were analyzed by [[Rutgers University]] [[biochemistry|biochemists]], who found high levels of [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]], [[dibenzofuran]], and [[trichloroethylene]] in their body fat. The complainants alleged they had sustained skin, liver, and respiratory injuries due to their work at Groom, and that this had contributed to the deaths of Frost and Kasza. The suit sought compensation for the injuries they had sustained, claiming the USAF had illegally handled toxic materials, and that the EPA had failed in its duty to enforce the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (which governs handling of dangerous materials.) They also sought detailed information about the chemicals to which they were allegedly exposed, hoping this would facilitate the medical treatment of survivors. Congressman [[Lee H. Hamilton]], former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told ''[[60 Minutes]]'' reporter [[Leslie Stahl]], "The Air Force is classifying all information about Area 51 in order to protect themselves from a lawsuit."

Citing the [[State Secrets Privilege]], the government petitioned trial judge U.S. District Judge Philip Pro (of the [[United States District Court for the District of Nevada]] in Las Vegas) to disallow disclosure of classified documents or examination of secret witnesses, alleging this would expose classified information and threaten national security.<ref name=lvrj_jun2002>{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/Jun-04-Tue-2002/news/18894771.html|title=Search &#124; Las Vegas Review-Journal|publisher=Reviewjournal.com|date=June 4, 2002|accessdate=2013-06-10}}</ref> When Judge Pro rejected the government's argument, [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] issued a [[Presidential Determination]], exempting what it called, "The Air Force's Operating Location Near Groom Lake, Nevada" from environmental disclosure laws. Consequently, Pro dismissed the suit due to lack of evidence. Turley appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], on the grounds that the government was abusing its power to classify material. [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]] [[Sheila E. Widnall]] filed a brief that stated that disclosures of the materials present in the air and water near Groom "can reveal military operational capabilities or the nature and scope of classified operations." The Ninth Circuit rejected Turley's appeal,<ref>http://archive.ca9.uscourts.gov/coa/newopinions.nsf/77F9FB6C3552927E88256D05007AE266/$file/0016378.pdf?openelement</ref> and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear it, putting an end to the complainants' case.

==1974 Skylab photography==

In January 2006, space historian [[Dwayne A. Day]] published an article in online aerospace magazine ''[[The Space Review]]'' titled "Astronauts and Area 51: the Skylab Incident". The article was based on a memo written in 1974 to [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] director [[William Colby]] by an unknown CIA official. The memo reported that astronauts on board [[Skylab 4]] had, as part of a larger program, inadvertently photographed a location of which the memo said:
{{quote|There were specific instructions not to do this. <redacted> was the only location which had such an instruction.}}
Although the name of the location was obscured, the context led Day to believe that the subject was Groom Lake. As Day noted:
{{quote|[I]n other words, the CIA considered no other spot on Earth to be as sensitive as Groom Lake.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/531/1|last=Day|first=Dwayne A.|title=Astronauts and Area 51: the Skylab Incident|authorlink=Dwayne A.

The memo details debate between federal agencies regarding whether the images should be classified, with [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] agencies arguing that it should, and [[NASA]] and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] arguing against classification. The memo itself questions the legality of unclassified images to be retroactively classified.

Remarks on the memo,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/archive/531.pdf|title=CIA memo to DCI Colby|publisher=Hosted by The Space Review|accessdate =2 April 2006|format=PDF|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060326030802/http://www.thespacereview.com/archive/531.pdf|archivedate=26 March 2006 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> handwritten apparently by DCI ([[Director of Central Intelligence]]) Colby himself, read:

# If exposed, don't we just say classified USAF work is done there?}}

The declassified documents do not disclose the outcome of discussions regarding the Skylab imagery. The behind-the-scenes debate proved moot as the photograph appeared in the [[Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science|Federal Government's Archive of Satellite Imagery]] along with the remaining Skylab 4 photographs, with no record of anyone noticing until Day identified it in 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1010/1|last=Day|first=Dwayne A.|title=Secret Apollo|authorlink=Dwayne A.

===Other satellite imagery===
Other satellite imagery is also available, including images that show what appears to be [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] aircraft stationed on the base.<ref>http://wikimapia.org/#lang=el&lat=37.244866&lon=-115.816364&z=19&m=b</ref>

==UFO and other conspiracy theories==
Its secretive nature and undoubted connection to classified aircraft research, together with reports of unusual phenomena, have led Area 51 to become a focus of modern [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]. Some of the activities mentioned in such theories at Area 51 include:
* The storage, examination, and [[reverse engineering]] of crashed [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] spacecraft (including material supposedly recovered at [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]]), the study of their occupants (living and dead), and the manufacture of aircraft based on alien technology.
* Meetings or joint undertakings with extraterrestrials.
* The development of exotic [[energy weapons]] for the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) or other weapons programs.
* The development of means of [[weather control]].
* The development of [[time travel]] and [[teleportation]] technology.
* The development of unusual and exotic propulsion systems related to the [[Aurora (aircraft)|Aurora Program]].
* Activities related to a supposed shadowy [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Alien invasion|one world government]] or the [[Majestic 12]] organization.
Many of the hypotheses concern underground facilities at Groom or at [[Papoose Lake]] (also known as "S-4 location"), {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} south, and include claims of a transcontinental underground railroad system, a disappearing airstrip (nicknamed the "Cheshire Airstrip", after [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Cheshire cat]]) which briefly appears when water is sprayed onto its camouflaged asphalt,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serve.com/mahood/nellis/area19/cheshire.htm|title=The Cheshire Airstrip|first=Tom|last=Mahood|month=October|year=1996|accessdate=2 April 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060316110233/http://www.serve.com/mahood/nellis/area19/cheshire.htm|archivedate=16 March 2006}}</ref> and engineering based on alien technology. Publicly available satellite imagery, however, reveals clearly visible landing strips at Groom Dry Lake, but not at Papoose Lake.

In the mid-1950s, civilian aircraft flew under 20,000 feet while military aircraft flew under 40,000 feet. Once the U-2 began flying at above 60,000 feet, an unexpected side effect was an increasing number of UFO sighting reports. Sightings occurred most often during early evenings hours, when airline pilots flying west saw the U-2's silver wings reflect the setting sun, giving the aircraft a "fiery" appearance. Many sighting reports came to the Air Force's [[Project Blue Book]], which investigated UFO sightings, through air-traffic controllers and letters to the government. The project checked U-2 and later OXCART flight records to eliminate the majority of UFO reports it received during the late 1950s and 1960s, although it could not reveal to the letter writers the truth behind what they saw.{{r|cia1992}}{{rp|72â€“73}} Similarly, veterans of experimental projects such as OXCART and [[NERVA]] at Area 51 agree that their work (including 2,850 OXCART test flights alone) inadvertently prompted many of the UFO sightings and other rumors:<ref name="jacobsen"/>
{{quote|The shape of OXCART was unprecedented, with its wide, disk-like fuselage designed to carry vast quantities of fuel. Commercial pilots cruising over Nevada at dusk would look up and see the bottom of OXCART whiz by at 2,000-plus mph. The aircraft's titanium body, moving as fast as a bullet, would reflect the sun's rays in a way that could make anyone think, ''UFO''.<ref name="jacobsen">{{cite web|last=Jacobsen|first=Annie|url=http://www.latimes.com/la-mag-april052009-backstory,0,786384.story|title=The Road to Area 51|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 5, 2009|accessdate=2013-06-10}}</ref>}}
They believe that the rumors helped maintain secrecy over Area 51's actual operations.<ref name="lacitis20100327"/> While the veterans deny the existence of a vast underground railroad system, many of Area 51's operations did (and presumably still do) occur underground.<ref name="jacobsen"/>
* Bob Lazar
:: ''See: [[S-4 (facility)]] for further information''
: Several people have claimed knowledge of events supporting Area 51 conspiracy theories. These have included [[Bob Lazar]], who claimed in 1989 that he had worked at Area 51's "Sector Four (S-4)", said to be located underground inside the [[Papoose Range]] near [[Papoose Lake]]. Lazar has stated he was contracted to work with alien spacecraft that the U.S. government had in its possession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zamandayolculuk.com/cetinbal/s4sportmodel.htm|title=S4 Sport Model â€“ Cetin BAL â€“ GSM:+90 05366063183 â€“ Turkey / Denizli|publisher=Zamandayolculuk.com|accessdate=10 June 2010}}</ref>
* Bruce Burgess
: Similarly, the 1996 documentary ''Dreamland'' directed by [[Bruce Burgess]] included an interview with a 71-year-old mechanical engineer who claimed to be a former employee at Area 51 during the 1950s. His claims included that he had worked on a "flying disc simulator" which had been based on a disc originating from a crashed extraterrestrial craft and was used to train US Pilots. He also claimed to have worked with an extraterrestrial being named "J-Rod" and described as a "telepathic translator".<ref>''Dreamland'', Transmedia and Dandelion Production for Sky Television (1996).</ref>
* Dan Burisch
: In 2004, Dan Burisch (pseudonym of Dan Crain) claimed to have worked on cloning alien viruses at Area 51, also alongside the alien named "J-Rod". Burisch's scholarly credentials are the subject of much debate, as he was apparently working as a Las Vegas parole officer in 1989 while also earning a PhD at [[State University of New York|SUNY]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/2004-11/|publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|work=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=28|issue=6|month=November/December|year=2004|first=Robert|last=Sheaffer|title=Tunguska 1, Roswell 0|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090313001822/http://www.csicop.org/si/2004-11/|archivedate = 29 March 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
<!--Please don't list every single TV show/movie Area 51 is mentioned on or appears in. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list! Unless you have an example that is much, much, much better than those already here, don't insert it. We could use a novel or two, but Area 51 should be an important part of the story, not just a casual mention. (GTA: San Andreas' "Area 69" is a casual mention, for example.)-->

Novels, films, television programs, and other fictional portrayals of Area 51 describe itâ€”or a fictional counterpartâ€”as a haven for [[extraterrestrials]], [[time travel]], and [[Conspiracy theory|sinister conspiracies]], often linking it with the [[Roswell UFO incident]]. In the 1996 action film ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', the United States military uses alien technology captured at Roswell to attack the invading alien fleet from Area&nbsp;51. The "Hangar&nbsp;51"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rinzler|first1=J.W.|last2=Bouzereau|first2=Laurent

The television series ''[[Seven Days (TV series)|Seven Days]]'' takes place inside Area&nbsp;51, with the base containing a covert [[National Security Agency|NSA]] [[time travel]] operation using alien technology recovered from Roswell. The 2005 video game ''[[Area 51 (2005 video game)|Area 51]]'' is set in the base, and mentions the Roswell and [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|moon landing hoax]] conspiracy theories.

The [[Las Vegas 51s]] are a AAA minor league professional baseball team.<!--
