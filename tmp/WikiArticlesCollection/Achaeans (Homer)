The '''Achaeans''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|iː|ən|z}}; {{lang-grc|Ἀχαιοί}} ''Akhaioí'') constitute one of the [[Names of the Greeks|collective names]] for the [[Greeks]] in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' (used 598 times) and ''[[Odyssey]]''. The other common names are '''Danaans''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|æ|n|eɪ|.|ən|z}}; {{lang|grc|Δαναοί}} ''Danaoi'' used 138 times in the ''Iliad'') and '''Argives''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|ɡ|aɪ|v|z}}; {{lang|grc|Ἀργεῖοι ''Argeioi''}} used 182 times in the ''Iliad''), while '''Hellenes''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ɛ|ˈ|l|iː|n|z}}; {{lang|grc|Ἕλληνες}} ''Hellenes'') was used only once.<ref>Homer. ''Iliad'', II.2.653.</ref> In the historical period, the '''Achaeans''' were the inhabitants of the region of [[Achaea (ancient region)#Name|Achaea]], a region in the north central part of the [[Peloponnese]]. The city-states of this region later formed a confederation known as the [[Achaean League]] which was influential during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE.

==Homeric versus later use==
The Homeric "long-haired Achaeans" would have been a part of the [[Mycenaean civilization]] that dominated Greece from circa 1600 BCE until 1100 BCE. However, by the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods, the term "Achaeans" referred to inhabitants of the much smaller region of [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaea]]. [[Herodotus]] identified the [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaeans]] of the northern [[Peloponnese]] as descendants of the earlier, Homeric Achaeans. According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], writing in the 2nd century CE, the term "Achaean" was originally given to those Greeks inhabiting the [[Argolis]] and [[Laconia]].<ref>Pausanias. ''Description of Greece'', VII.1.</ref> However, this clearly is not the manner in which Homer uses the term.

Pausanias and Herodotus both recount the legend that the Achaeans were forced from their homelands by the [[Dorians]], during the legendary [[Dorian invasion]] of the Peloponnese. They then moved into the region that later bore the name of Achaea.

A scholarly consensus has not yet been reached on the origin of the historic Achaeans relative to the Homeric Achaeans and is still hotly debated. Former emphasis on presumed race, such as John A. Scott's article about the blond locks of the Achaeans as compared to the dark locks of "Mediterranean" [[Poseidon]],<ref>{{harvnb|Scott|1925|pp=366–367}}.</ref> on the basis of hints in Homer, has been rejected. The contrasting belief that "Achaeans", as understood through Homer, is "a name without a country", an ''ethnos'' created in the [[Epic Cycle|Epic tradition]],<ref>As William K. Prentice expressed this long-standing skepticism of a genuine Achaean ethnicity in the distant past, at the outset of his article "The Achaeans" (see {{harvnb|Prentice|1929|p=206}}).</ref> has modern supporters among those who conclude that "Achaeans" were redefined in the 5th century BCE, as contemporary speakers of [[Aeolic Greek]].

[[Karl Beloch]] has suggested that there was no Dorian invasion, but rather that the Peloponnesian Dorians were the Achaeans.<ref>{{harvnb|Beloch|1893|loc=Volume I, pp. 88 (Note #1) and 92}}.</ref> [[Eduard Meyer]], disagreeing with Beloch, has instead put forth the suggestion that the real-life Achaeans were mainland pre-Dorian Greeks.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|1884–1902|loc=Volume II, Part 1: Die Zeit der ägyptischen Großmacht –  [http://www.zeno.org/Geschichte/M/Meyer,+Eduard/Geschichte+des+Altertums/Zweiter+Band.+Erste+Abteilung%3A+Die+Zeit+der+%C3%A4gyptischen+Gro%C3%9Fmacht/V.+Das+griechische+Festland+und+die+mykenische+Kultur V. Das griechische Festland und die mykenische Kultur]}}.</ref> His conclusion is based on his research on the similarity between the languages of the Achaeans and pre-historic Arcadians. William Prentice disagrees with both, noting that archeological evidence suggests that the Achaeans instead migrated from "southern [[Asia Minor]] to Greece, probably settling first in lower [[Ancient Thessaly|Thessaly]]" probably prior to 2000 BCE.<ref>{{harvnb|Prentice|1929|pp=206–218}}.</ref>

[[Emil Forrer]], a [[Swiss]] Hittitologist who worked on the Boghazköy tablets in [[Berlin]], stated that the Achaeans of pre-Homeric Greece were directly associated with the term "Land of Ahhiyawa" mentioned in the Hittite texts.<ref name="Güterbock">{{harvnb|Güterbock|1984|p=114}}.</ref> However, his conclusions at the time were challenged by other Hittitologists (i.e. Johannes Friedrich in 1927 and Albrecht Götze in 1930), as well as by Ferdinand Sommer who published his monumental ''Die Ahhijava-Urkunden'' ("The Ahhiyawa Documents") in 1932.<ref name="Güterbock"/>

==Hittite documents==
[[File:Map Hittite rule en.svg|thumb|175px|left|Map showing the Hittite Empire, Ahhiyawa (Achaeans) and Wilusa (Troy) in ca. 1300 BCE.]]

Some [[Hittite language|Hittite]] texts mention a nation lying to the west called '''''Ahhiyawa'''''.<ref>{{harvnb|Huxley|1960|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Güterbock|1983|pp=133–138}}; {{harvnb|Mellink|1983|pp=138–141}}.</ref> In the earliest reference to this land, a letter outlining the treaty violations of the Hittite vassal [[Madduwatta]],<ref>[http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations/historical%2fCTH147_Madduwatta.html Translation of the Sins of Madduwatta]</ref> it is called ''Ahhiya''. Another important example is the ''[[Tawagalawa Letter]]'' written by an unnamed [[Hittites|Hittite]] king (most probably [[Hattusili III]]) of the empire period (14th-13th century BCE) to the king of ''Ahhiyawa'', treating him as an equal and suggesting that [[Miletus]] (''Millawanda'') was under his control.<ref>[http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations/historical%2fPiyama-radu+Letter.html Translation of the Tawagalawa Letter]</ref> It also refers to an earlier "''Wilusa'' episode" involving hostility on the part of ''Ahhiyawa''. Ahhiya(wa) has been identified with the Achaeans of the [[Trojan War]] and the city of [[Wilusa]] with the legendary city of [[Troy]] (note the similarity with early Greek {{lang|grc|Ϝιλιον}} ''Wilion'', later {{lang|grc|Ίλιον}} ''Ilion'', the name of the [[acropolis]] of Troy). The exact relationship of the term ''Ahhiyawa'' to the Achaeans beyond a similarity in pronunciation was hotly debated by scholars, even following the discovery that Mycenaean [[Linear B]] is an early form of Greek; the earlier debate was summed up in 1984 by [[Hans G. Güterbock]] of the [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute]].<ref>{{harvnb|Güterbock|1984|pp=114–122}}.</ref> More recent research based on new readings and interpretations of the Hittite texts, as well as of the material evidence for Mycenaean contacts with the Anatolian mainland, came to the conclusion that ''Ahhiyawa'' referred to the Mycenaean world, or at least to a part of it.<ref>{{harvnb|Windle|2004|pp=121–122}}; {{harvnb|Bryce|1999|loc=p. 60}}</ref>

During the 5th year of Pharaoh [[Merneptah]], a confederation of [[Libya]]n and northern peoples is supposed to have attacked the western delta. Included amongst the ethnic names of the repulsed invaders is the [[Ekwesh]] or Eqwesh, whom some have seen as Achaeans, although Egyptian texts specifically mention these Ekwesh to be circumcised (which does not seem to have been a general practice in the Aegean at the time). Homer mentions an Achaean attack upon the delta, and [[Menelaus]] speaks of the same in Book 4 of the ''Odyssey'' to [[Telemachus]] when he recounts his own return home from the [[Trojan War]]. Later Greek myths also say that Helen had spent the time of the Trojan War in [[Egypt]], and not at [[Troy]], and that after Troy the [[Greeks]] went there to recover her.

==Greek mythology==
In [[Greek mythology]], the perceived cultural divisions among the Hellenes were represented as legendary lines of descent that identified kinship groups, with each line being derived from an [[eponymy|eponymous]] ancestor. Each of the Greek ''[[Ethnic group|ethne]]'' were said to be named in honor of their respective ancestors: [[Achaeus (son of Xuthus)|Achaeus]] of the Achaeans, [[Danaus]] of the [[Danaans]], [[Cadmus]] of the Cadmeans ([[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|the Thebans]]), [[Hellen]] of the Hellenes (not to be confused with [[Helen of Troy]]), [[Aeolus]] of the [[Aeolians]], [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]] of the [[Ionians]], and [[Dorus]] of the [[Dorians]].

Kadmos from [[Phoenicia]], Danaus from [[Egypt]], and Pelops from [[Anatolia]] each gained a foothold in mainland Greece and were assimilated and Hellenized. Hellen, Graikos, Magnes, and Macedon were sons of [[Deucalion]] and [[Pyrrha]], the only people who survived the [[Great Flood]];<ref>Hesiod. ''Catalogue of Women'', Fragments.</ref> the ''ethne'' were said to have originally been named ''Graikoi'' after the elder son but later renamed ''Hellenes'' after Hellen who was proved to be the strongest.<ref>Aristotle. ''Meteorologica'', I.14.</ref> Sons of Hellen and the nymph [[Orseis]] were Dorus, Xuthos, and Aeolus.<ref name="Pseudo-Apollodorus">Pseudo-Apollodorus. ''Bibliotheca'', [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html I.7.3].</ref> Sons of Xuthos and Kreousa, daughter of Erechthea, were Ion and Achaeus.<ref name="Pseudo-Apollodorus"/>

According to [[Hyginus]], 22 Achaeans killed 362 Trojans during their ten years at [[Troy]].<ref>[[Hyginus]]. ''[[Fabulae]]'',  [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae3.html#114 114].</ref><ref>In particular: Achilles 72, Antilochus 2, Protesilaus 4, Peneleos 2, Eurypylus 1, Ajax 14, Thoas 2, Leitus 20, Thrasymedes 2, Agamemnon 16, Diomedes 18, Menelaus 8, Philoctetes 3, Meriones 7, Odysseus 12, Idomeneus 13, Leonteus 5, Ajax 28, Patroclus 54, Polypoetes 1, Teucer 30, Neoptolemus 6; a total of 362 Trojans.</ref>
