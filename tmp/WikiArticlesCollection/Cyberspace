'''Cyberspace''' is a word that began in science fiction literature in the 1980s, was quickly and widely adopted by computer professionals as well as hobbyists, and became a household term in the 1990s. During this period, the uses of the internet, networking, and digital communication were all growing dramatically and the term "cyberspace" was able to represent the many new ideas and phenomena that were emerging.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Strate|first=Lance|title=The varieties of cyberspace: Problems in definition and delimitation|journal=Western Journal of Communication|year=1999|volume=63|issue=3|pages=382–3}}</ref>

The parent term of cyberspace is "[[cybernetics]]", derived from the Ancient Greek κυβερνήτης (kybernētēs, steersman, governor, pilot, or rudder), a word introduced by [[Norbert Wiener]] for his pioneering work in electronic communication and control science.

As a social experience, individuals can interact, exchange ideas, share information, provide social support, conduct business, direct actions, create artistic media, play games, engage in political discussion, and so on, using this global network. They are sometimes referred to as ''cybernauts''. The term ''cyberspace'' has become a conventional means to describe anything associated with the [[Internet]] and the diverse [[Cyberculture|Internet culture]]. The United States government recognizes the interconnected information technology and the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures operating across this medium as part of the US national [[critical infrastructure]]. Amongst individuals on cyberspace, there is believed to be a code of shared rules and ethics mutually beneficial for all to follow, referred to as [[cyberethics]]. Many view the right to privacy as most important to a functional code of [[cyberethics]].<ref name="cyberethics">Richard A. Spinello, [http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=mE8NEL5JdmAC&oi=fnd&pg=PP2&dq=cyberethics&ots=N0hnxToCjZ&sig=zOZQBEADTaLt6efQBfOxXsWjsEY ''"Cyberethics: Morality and Law in Cyberspace"'']</ref>  Such moral responsibilities go hand in hand when working online with global networks, specifically, when opinions are involved with online social experiences.<ref name="georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov">White House, [http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/pcipb/ ''"The National Strategy To Secure Cyberspace"'']</ref>

According to [[Chip Morningstar]] and [[F. Randall Farmer]], cyberspace is defined more by the social interactions involved rather than its technical implementation.<ref>Morningstar, Chip and F. Randall Farmer. The Lessons of Lucasfilm's Habitat. ''The New Media Reader''. Ed. Wardrip-Fruin and Nick Montfort: The MIT Press, 2003. 664-667. Print</ref> In their view, the computational medium in cyberspace is an augmentation of the communication channel between real people; the core characteristic of cyberspace is that it offers an environment that consists of many participants with the ability to affect and influence each other. They derive this concept from the observation that people seek richness, complexity, and depth within a virtual world.

==Origins of the term==
The term "cyberspace" began appearing in fiction in the 1980s (for example, the 1980 [[Vernor Vinge]] novella "[[True Names]]", and the 1980 [[John M. Ford]] novel ''Web of Angels.'')  Yet it was through the work of [[cyberpunk]] science fiction author [[William Gibson]],<ref name=wired>{{cite news |work=WIRED |title=March 17, 1948: William Gibson, Father of Cyberspace | author=Scott Thil | date=03.17.09 | url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2009/03/dayintech_0317}}</ref> that the word became prominently identified with online computer networks, beginning with the 1982 story "[[Burning Chrome]]" and popularized by his 1984 novel ''[[Neuromancer]].''<ref>''Po-Mo SF'' [http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/technoculture/pomosf.html "William Gibson's Neuromancer and Post-Modern Science Fiction"]</ref><ref name="Worldwidewebamc">{{cite journal|doi=10.1145/234173.234177|title=The client's side of the World-Wide Web|year=1996|last1=Berghel|first1=Hal|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=39|pages=30}}</ref> The portion of ''Neuromancer'' cited in this respect is usually the following:<ref>{{cite book | last = Gibson | first = William | title = Neuromancer | publisher = Ace Books | location = New York | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-441-56956-0 | page = 69 }}</ref>

{{quote|Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts... A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding.}}

Now widely used, the term has since been criticized by Gibson, who commented on the origin of the term in the 2000 documentary ''[[No Maps for These Territories]]'':

{{quote|All I knew about the word "cyberspace" when I coined it, was that it seemed like an effective buzzword. It seemed evocative and essentially meaningless. It was suggestive of something, but had no real semantic meaning, even for me, as I saw it emerge on the page.}}

===Metaphorical===
Don Slater uses a metaphor to define cyberspace, describing the "sense of a social setting that exists purely within a space of representation and communication . . . it exists entirely within a computer space, distributed across increasingly complex and fluid networks."
The term "Cyberspace" started to become a de facto synonym for the [[internet]], and later the [[World Wide Web]], during the 1990s, especially in academic circles<ref>Vanderbilt University, [http://www.vanderbilt.edu/ans/english/clayton/sch295.htm ''"Postmodernism and the Culture of Cyberspace"''], Fall 1996 course syllabus</ref> and activist communities. Author [[Bruce Sterling]], who popularized this meaning,<ref>''Principia Cybernetica'' [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/CYBSPACE.html "Cyberspace"]</ref> credits [[John Perry Barlow]] as the first to use it to refer to "the present-day nexus of computer and telecommunications networks." Barlow describes it thus in his essay to announce the formation of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (note the spatial metaphor) in June, 1990:<ref>John Perry Barlow, [http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html "Crime and Puzzlement,"] June 8, 1990</ref>

{{quote|In this silent world, all conversation is typed. To enter it, one forsakes both body and place and becomes a thing of words alone. You can see what your neighbors are saying (or recently said), but not what either they or their physical surroundings look like. Town meetings are continuous and discussions rage on everything from sexual kinks to depreciation schedules.

Whether by one telephonic tendril or millions, they are all connected to one another. Collectively, they form what their inhabitants call the Net. It extends across that immense region of electron states, microwaves, magnetic fields, light pulses and thought which sci-fi writer William Gibson named Cyberspace.|John Perry Barlow|"Crime and Puzzlement," 1990-06-08}}

As Barlow, and the EFF, continued public education efforts to promote the idea of "[[digital rights]]", the term was increasingly used during the internet boom of the late 1990s.

===Virtual environments===
Although the present-day, loose use of the term "cyberspace" no longer implies or suggests immersion in a virtual reality, current technology allows the integration of a number of capabilities (sensors, signals, connections, transmissions, processors, and controllers) sufficient to generate a [[Virtuality|virtual]] interactive experience that is accessible regardless of a geographic location.

In 1989, [[Autodesk]], an American multinational corporation that focuses on 2D and 3D design software, developed a virtual design system called Cyberspace.<ref>Andrew Pollack, New York Times, [http://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/10/business/for-artificial-reality-wear-a-computer.html "For Artificial Reality, Wear A Computer,"] April 10, 1989</ref>

==Cyberspace as an internet metaphor==
While cyberspace should not be confused with the [[Internet]], the term is often used to refer to objects and identities that exist largely within the communication network itself, so that a [[Website]], for example, might be metaphorically said to "exist in cyberspace".<ref>M. Graham [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2166874 “Geography/Internet: Ethereal Alternate Dimensions of Cyberspace or Grounded Augmented Realities?”] ''The Geographical Journal'', vol. 179, no. 2., pp. 177-188.</ref> According to this interpretation, events taking place on the internet are not happening in the locations where participants or servers are physically located, but "in cyberspace".

Firstly, cyberspace describes the flow of digital data through the network of interconnected computers: it is at once not "real", since one could not spatially locate it as a tangible object, and clearly "real" in its effects. Secondly, cyberspace is the site of computer-mediated communication (CMC), in which online relationships and alternative forms of online identity were enacted, raising important questions about the social psychology of internet use, the relationship between "online" and "offline" forms of life and interaction, and the relationship between the "real" and the virtual. Cyberspace draws attention to remediation of culture through [[new media]] technologies: it is not just a communication tool but a social destination, and is culturally significant in its own right. Finally, cyberspace can be seen as providing new opportunities to reshape society and culture through "hidden" identities, or it can be seen as borderless communication and culture.<ref>New Media, an Introduction: Flew, Terry</ref>
{{quotation|Cyberspace is the "place" where a telephone conversation appears to occur. Not inside your actual phone, the plastic device on your desk. Not inside the other person's phone, in some other city. '''The place between''' the phones. [...] in the past twenty years, this electrical "space," which was once thin and dark and one-dimensional—little more than a narrow speaking-tube, stretching from phone to phone—has flung itself open like a gigantic jack-in-the-box. Light has flooded upon it, the eerie light of the glowing computer screen. This dark electric netherworld has become a vast flowering electronic landscape. Since the 1960s, the world of the telephone has cross-bred itself with computers and television, and though there is still no substance to cyberspace, nothing you can handle, it has a strange kind of physicality now. It makes good sense today to talk of cyberspace as a place all its own.|Bruce Sterling|Introduction to '''[[The Hacker Crackdown]]'''}}

The "space" in cyberspace has more in common with the abstract, mathematical meanings of the term (see [[space]]) than physical space. It does not have the duality of positive and negative volume (while in physical space for example a room has the negative volume of usable space delineated by positive volume of walls, internet users cannot enter the screen and explore the unknown part of the internet as an extension of the space they are in), but spatial meaning can be attributed to the relationship between different [[Web page|page]]s (of books as well as [[webserver]]s), considering the unturned pages to be somewhere "out there." The concept of cyberspace therefore refers not to the content being presented to the surfer, but rather to the possibility of surfing among different [[Website|site]]s, with [[feedback|feedback loops]] between the user and the rest of the system creating the potential to always encounter something unknown or unexpected.

[[Videogame]]s differ from text-based communication in that on-screen images are meant to be figures that actually occupy a space and the animation shows the movement of those figures. Images are supposed to form the positive volume that delineates the empty space. A game adopts the cyberspace metaphor by engaging more players in the game, and then figuratively representing them on the screen as [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]]s. Games do not have to stop at the avatar-player level, but current implementations aiming for more [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]] playing space (i.e. [[Laser tag]]) take the form of [[augmented reality]] rather than cyberspace, fully immersive virtual realities remaining impractical.

Although the more radical consequences of the global communication network predicted by some cyberspace proponents (i.e. the diminishing of state influence envisioned by [[John Perry Barlow]]<ref>John Perry Barlow, [http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html ''"A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace,"''] February 8, 1996</ref>) failed to materialize and the word lost some of its novelty appeal, it remains current as of 2006.<ref name="georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov"/><ref>[http://news.findlaw.com/legalnews/scitech/cyber/ ''FindLaw Legal News'' site], Tech and IP: Cyberspace section, retrieved November 14, 2006.</ref>

Some [[virtual communities]] explicitly refer to the concept of cyberspace, for example [[Linden Lab]] calling their customers "[[Resident (Second Life)|Residents]]" of [[Second Life]], while all such communities can be positioned "in cyberspace" for explanatory and comparative purposes (as did Sterling in ''The Hacker Crackdown'', followed by many journalists), integrating the metaphor into a wider [[cyberculture|cyber-culture]].

The metaphor has been useful in helping a new generation of thought leaders to reason through new military strategies around the world, led largely by the US Department of Defense (DoD).<ref>Cyber Conflict Studies Association, [http://www.cyberconflict.org CCSA]</ref> The use of cyberspace as a metaphor has had its limits, however, especially in areas where the metaphor becomes confused with physical infrastructure. It has also been critiqued as being unhelpful for falsely employing a spatial metaphor to describe what is inherently a network.<ref>M. Graham “Geography/Internet: Ethereal Alternate Dimensions of Cyberspace or Grounded Augmented Realities?” The Geographical Journal, vol. 179, no. 2., pp. 177-188.</ref>

==Alternate realities in philosophy and art==

===Predating computers===
A forerunner of the modern ideas of cyberspace is the [[Descartes|Cartesian]] notion that people might be deceived by an evil demon that feeds them a false reality. This argument is the direct predecessor of modern ideas of a [[brain in a vat]] and many popular conceptions of cyberspace take Descartes's ideas as their starting point.

[[Visual arts]] have a tradition, stretching [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius|back to antiquity]], of artifacts meant to [[Trompe-l'œil|fool the eye]] and be mistaken for reality. This questioning of reality occasionally led some philosophers and especially theologians{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} to distrust art as deceiving people into entering a world which was not real (see [[Aniconism]]). The artistic challenge was resurrected with increasing ambition as art became more and more realistic with the invention of photography, film (see ''[[L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat|Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat]]''), and immersive computer simulations.

===Influenced by computers===

====Philosophy====
American [[counterculture]] exponents like [[William S. Burroughs]] (whose literary influence on Gibson and cyberpunk in general is widely acknowledged<ref>[[Alexander Laurence]], [http://www.altx.com/int2/john.shirley.html An Interview with [[John Shirley]]], 1994</ref><ref>[http://www.streettech.com/bcp/BCPgraf/CyberCulture/bgtg.htm "Burroughs/Gysin/Throbbing Gristle"], retrieved December 31, 2006</ref>) and [[Timothy Leary]]<ref>"Internet will be the LSD of the 90s", quoted by [http://www.timothyleary.us/timothyleary.html an on-line biography]</ref> were among the first to extoll the potential of computers and computer networks for individual empowerment.<ref>[[Douglas Rushkoff]], [http://www.deepleafproductions.com/utopialibrary/text/rushkoff-godfathers.html "Godfathers of Cyberspace"]</ref>

Some contemporary philosophers and scientists (e.g. [[David Deutsch]] in ''The Fabric of Reality'') employ virtual reality in various [[thought experiment]]s. For example [[Philip Zhai]] in ''Get Real: A Philosophical Adventure in Virtual Reality'' connects cyberspace to the platonic tradition:

{{quote|Let us imagine a nation in which everyone is hooked up to a network of VR infrastructure. They have been so hooked up since they left their mother's wombs. Immersed in cyberspace and maintaining their life by teleoperation, they have never imagined that life could be any different from that. The first person that thinks of the possibility of an alternative world like ours would be ridiculed by the majority of these citizens, just like the few enlightened ones in Plato's allegory of the cave.}}

Note that this [[brain-in-a-vat]] argument conflates cyberspace with [[reality]], while the more common descriptions of cyberspace contrast it with the "real world".

====Art====
{{main|New media art}}

Having originated among writers, the concept of cyberspace remains most popular in literature and film. Although artists working with other media have expressed interest in the concept, such as [[Roy Ascott]], "cyberspace" in [[digital art]] is mostly used as a synonym for [[immersive virtual reality]] and remains more discussed than enacted.<ref>Eduardo Kac, [http://www.ekac.org/Telepresence.art._94.html ''"Telepresence Art"'']</ref>
Indian epic Mahabaratha written by sage Vyasar talks about concepts what is called today Virtual reality, Transportation in to matrix and web conferencing.

====Computer crime====
{{main|Computer crime}}

Cyberspace also brings together every service and facility imaginable to expedite money laundering. One can purchase anonymous credit cards, bank accounts, encrypted global mobile telephones, and false passports. From there one can pay professional advisors to set up IBCs (International Business Corporations, or corporations with anonymous ownership) or similar structures in OFCs (Offshore Financial Centers). Such advisors are loath to ask any penetrating questions about the wealth and activities of their clients, since the average fees criminals pay them to launder their money can be as much as 20 percent.<ref>Johanna Granville [http://www.scribd.com/doc/14361572/Dotcon-Dangers-of-Cybercrime-by-Johanna-Granville “Dot.Con: The Dangers of Cyber Crime and a Call for Proactive Solutions,”] ''Australian Journal of Politics and History'', vol. 49, no. 1. (Winter 2003), pp. 102-109.</ref>

====5-level model====
In 2010, a [http://www.alliancegeostrategique.org/2010/10/04/une-ebauche-apocryphe-et-anthropocentrique-du-cyberespace/ 5-level model] was designed in France. According to this model, cyberspace is composed of 5 layers based on information discoveries: language, writing, printing, Internet, etc. This original model links the world of information to telecommunication technologies.

==Popular culture examples==
* In October 1966, Doctor Who aired ''The Tenth Planet''. An wandering planet enters the solar system. This planet, Mondas, is the home of the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]].
* The anime ''[[Digimon]]'' is set in a variant of the cyberspace concept called the "Digital World". The Digital World is a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] made up of data from the internet. Similar to cyberspace, except that people could physically enter this world instead of merely using a computer.
* The anime ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' is set in the future where cyberization of humanity happens in cyberspace.
* The CGI series, ''[[ReBoot]]'', takes place entirely inside cyberspace, which is composed of two worlds: the Net and the Web.
* In the film ''[[Tron]]'', a programmer was physically transferred to the program world, where programs were personalities, resembling the forms of their creators.
* In the film ''[[Virtuosity]]'' a program encapsulating a super-criminal within a virtual world simulation escapes into the "real world".
* In the novel ''[[Simulacron-3]]'' the author Daniel F. Galouye explores multiple levels of "reality" represented by the multiple levels of computer simulation involved.
* The idea of "the matrix" in the film ''[[The Matrix]]'' resembles a complex form of cyberspace where people are "jacked in" from birth and do not know that the reality they experience is virtual.
* In the televised remote controlled robot competition series ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'', the ''[[Megahurtz]]'' and subsequently ''[[Terrorhurtz]]'' team and their robot were introduced as being 'from Cyberspace', a nod to their online collaborative formation.
