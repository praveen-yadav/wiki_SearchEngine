The '''alphorn''' or '''alpenhorn''' or '''alpine horn''' is a [[Brass instrument|labrophone]], consisting of a wooden [[natural horn]] of [[bore (wind instruments)|conical bore]], having a wooden cup-shaped [[mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]], used by mountain dwellers in [[Swiss Alps|Switzerland]] and elsewhere. Similar wooden horns were used for [[communication]] in most mountainous regions of [[Europe]], from the [[French Alps]] to the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]].

For a long time, scholars believed that the alphorn had been derived from the Roman-Etruscan [[lituus]], because of their resemblance in shape, and because of the word ''liti'', meaning Alphorn in the dialect of [[Obwalden]]. There is no documented evidence for this theory, however, and, the word ''liti'' was probably borrowed from 16th-18th century writings in Latin, where the word ''lituus'' could describe various wind instruments, such as the [[natural horn|horn]], the [[crumhorn]], or the [[cornett]]. Swiss naturalist [[Conrad Gesner]] used the words ''lituum alpinum'' for the first known detailed description of the alphorn in his ''De raris et admirandis herbis'' in 1555. The oldest known document using the German word ''Alphorn'' is a page from a 1527 account book from the former [[Cistercian]] abbey St. Urban near [[Pfaffnau]] mentioning the payment of two [[Batzen]] for an itinerant alphorn player from the [[Valais]].

17th-19th century collections of alpine myths and legends suggest that alphorn-like instruments had frequently been used as signal instruments in village communities since medieval times or earlier, sometimes substituting for the lack of [[church bells]]. Surviving artifacts, dating back to as far as ca. AD 1400, include wooden [[Brass instrument|labrophones]] in their stretched form, like the alphorn, or coiled versions, such as the '"Büchel" and the "Allgäuisches Waldhorn" or "Ackerhorn". The alphorn's exact origins remain indeterminate, and the ubiquity of horn-like signal instruments in valleys throughout Europe may indicate a long history of cross influences regarding their construction and usage.

==Construction and qualities==
[[Image:Alphorn player in Wallis.jpg|thumb|right|A Swiss playing alphorn]]

The alphorn is carved from solid softwood, generally spruce but sometimes pine. In former times the alphorn maker would find a tree bent at the base in the shape of an alphorn, but modern makers piece the wood together at the base.   A cup-shaped mouthpiece carved out of a block of hard wood is added and the instrument is complete.

The alphorn has no lateral openings and therefore gives the pure [[Harmonic series (music)|natural harmonic series]] of the open pipe. The harmonics are the more readily obtained by reason of the small diameter of the bore in relation to the length.  An alphorn made at Rigi-Kulm, Schwyz, and now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], measures 8&nbsp;ft. in length and has a straight tube.  The Swiss alphorn varies in shape according to the locality, being curved near the bell in the Bernese Oberland.  [[Michael Praetorius]] mentions an alphorn-like instrument under the name of Hölzern Trummet (wooden trumpet) in ''Syntagma Musicum'' (Wittenberg, 1615–1619; Pl. VIII).

The notes of the natural harmonic series overlap, but do not exactly correspond, to notes found in the familiar chromatic scale in standard Western [[equal temperament]]. Most prominently within the alphorn's range, the 7th and 11th harmonics are particularly noticeable, because they fall between adjacent notes in the chromatic scale.

In the hands of a skilled composer or arranger, the natural harmonics can be used to haunting melancholy effect or, by contrast, to create a charming pastoral flavor, as in the lilting "Ranz des Vaches" and works by Brahms, Rossini, and Britten cited below.  Similar to the view of  [[Leopold Kronecker]] that "God made the integers; all else is the work of man," musicians drawn to the alphorn and other instruments that sound the natural harmonics, such as the [[natural horn]], consider the notes of the natural harmonic series&nbsp;&mdash; particularly the 7th and 11th harmonics&nbsp;&mdash; to be God's Notes, the remainder of the chromatic scale enabled by keys, valves, slides and other methods of changing the qualities of the simple open pipe being an artifact of mere mortals.<br clear=all>

The well-known "Ranz des Vaches" [http://www.lyoba.ch/culture/desalpe/ranz.htm#PARTITION (score] [http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swissinfo.html?sid=7020216&cKey=1183635931000&ty=st&rubricId=25004&siteSect=25001  ;  audio)] is a traditional Swiss melody often heard on the alphorn. The song describes the time of bringing the cows to the high country at cheese making time. [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] introduced the "Ranz des Vaches" into his masterpiece ''William Tell,'' along with many other delightful melodies scattered throughout the opera in vocal and instrumental parts that are well-suited to the alphorn. [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] wrote to [[Clara Schumann]] that the inspiration for the dramatic entry of the horn in the introduction to the last movement of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)|First Symphony]] was an alphorn melody he heard while vacationing in the Rigi area of Switzerland.  Finally, the prologue to [[Benjamin Britten|Britten's]] ''[[Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings]]'', played on horn without the use of valves but equally suited to the alphorn, is a beautiful, inspired example of the lyric possibilities of natural harmonics.
