'''Arthur Asher Miller''' (October 17, 1915&nbsp;– February 10, 2005)<ref name="Observer_obit"/><ref name="UMICH_Early" /> was an American playwright and essayist. He was a prominent figure in [[Theater in the United States|American theatre]], writing dramas that include plays such as ''[[All My Sons]]'' (1947), ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' (1949), ''[[The Crucible]]'' (1953) and ''[[A View from the Bridge]]'' (one-act, 1955; revised two-act, 1956), as well as the film ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961).

Miller was often in the public eye, particularly during the late 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s, a period during which he testified before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]], and was married to [[Marilyn Monroe]]. In 2002 he received the [[Prince of Asturias Award]] and in 2003 the [[Jerusalem Prize]].

In his book ''Trinity of Passion'', author Alan M.

In 1946 Miller's play ''[[All My Sons]]'', the writing of which had commenced in 1941, was a success on Broadway (earning him his first [[Tony Award]], [[Tony Award for Best Author|for Best Author]]) and his reputation as a playwright was established.<ref>{{Cite book | year=2005 | title=Arthur Miller: A Critical Study | author=Bigsby, C.

Though widely considered only somewhat successful at the time of its initial release, today ''[[The Crucible]]'' is Miller's most frequently produced work throughout the world<ref name="Observer_obit" /> and was adapted into an [[The Crucible (opera)|opera]] by [[Robert Ward (composer)|Robert Ward]], which won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1962. Miller and Kazan were close friends throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, but after Kazan's testimony to the HUAC, the pair's friendship ended, and they did not speak to each other for the next ten years.<ref name="AmMasters" /> The HUAC took an interest in Miller himself not long after ''The Crucible'' opened, denying him a passport to attend the play's London opening in 1954.<ref name="chronology" /> Kazan defended his own actions through his film ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', in which a dockworker heroically testifies against a corrupt union boss.

Miller's experience with the HUAC affected him throughout his life. In the late 1970s he became very interested in the highly publicized Barbara Gibbons murder case, in which Gibbons' son Peter Reilly was convicted of his mother's murder based on what many felt was a coerced confession and little other evidence. ''[[City Confidential]]'', an [[A&E Network]] series, produced an episode about the murder, postulating that part of the reason Miller took such an active interest (including supporting Reilly's defense and using his own celebrity to bring attention to Reilly's plight) was because he had felt similarly persecuted in his run-ins with the HUAC. He sympathized with Reilly, whom he firmly believed to be innocent and to have been railroaded by the Connecticut State Police and the Attorney General who had initially prosecuted the case.<ref>

===1956–1964===
In 1956, a [[One-act play|one-act version]] of Miller's [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse drama]] ''[[A View from the Bridge]]'' opened on Broadway in a joint bill with one of Miller's lesser-known plays, ''[[A Memory of Two Mondays]]''. The following year, Miller revised ''A View from the Bridge'' as a two-act [[prose]] drama, which [[Peter Brook]] directed in London.<ref>Miller, Arthur (1988) Introduction to ''Plays: One'', London: Methuen, p. 51, ISBN 0413175502.</ref>

In June 1956, Miller left his first wife Mary Slattery and on June 25 he married [[Marilyn Monroe]].<ref name="Observer_obit"/> Miller and Monroe had met in April 23, 1951, when they had a brief affair, and had remained in contact since then.<ref name="Observer_obit"/><ref name="Times_obit" />

When Miller applied in 1956 for a routine renewal of his passport, the HUAC used this opportunity to [[subpoena]] him to appear before the committee. Before appearing, Miller asked the committee not to ask him to name names, to which the chairman agreed.<ref name="BBCOnThisDay">{{cite news

When Miller attended the hearing, to which Monroe accompanied him, risking her own career,<ref name="Observer_obit" /> he gave the committee a detailed account of his political activities. Reneging on the chairman's promise, the committee demanded the names of friends and colleagues who had participated in similar activities.<ref name="BBCOnThisDay"/> Miller refused to comply, saying "I could not use the name of another person and bring trouble on him."<ref name="BBCOnThisDay" /> As a result, a judge found Miller guilty of [[contempt of Congress]] in May 1957. Miller was sentenced to a $500 fine or thirty days in prison, blacklisted, and disallowed a US passport.<ref name="UMICH_Early"/> In 1958, his conviction was overturned by the court of appeals, which ruled that Miller had been misled by the chairman of the HUAC.<ref name="UMICH_Early"/>

Miller began work on ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]'', starring his wife. Miller later said that the filming was one of the lowest points in his life; shortly before the film's premiere in 1961, the pair divorced.<ref name="Observer_obit"/><ref name="chronology"/> 19 months later, Monroe died of a possible drug overdose. Miller's future wife [[Inge Morath]] worked as a photographer documenting the film's production. The film proved to be the last appearances for both Monroe and [[Clark Gable]], and one of the last for [[Montgomery Clift]].

Miller married photographer [[Inge Morath]] on February 17, 1962 and the first of their two children, [[Rebecca Miller|Rebecca]], was born September 15, 1962. Their son Daniel was born with [[Down syndrome]] in November 1966; he was institutionalized and excluded from the Millers' personal life at Arthur's insistence.<ref name="VanityFair">{{cite news|work=Vanity Fair |title=Arthur Miller's Missing Act|author=Andrews, Suzanna |date=September 2007|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/fame/features/2007/09/miller200709?printable=true&currentPage=all|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref> The couple remained together until Inge's death in 2002.

===Later career===
[[File:Arthur Miller 1966.jpg|thumb|Miller in 1966]]
In 1964 Miller's next play was produced. ''[[After the Fall (play)|After the Fall]]'' is a deeply personal view of Miller's experiences during his marriage to Monroe. The play reunited Miller with his former friend Kazan: they collaborated on both the script and the direction. ''[[After the Fall (play)|After the Fall]]'' opened on January 23, 1964 at the ANTA Theatre in [[Washington Square Park]] amid a flurry of publicity and outrage at putting a Monroe-like character, called Maggie, on stage.<ref name="Observer_obit" /> Robert Brustein, in a review in the New Republic, called ''After the Fall'' "a three and one half hour breach of taste, a confessional autobiography of embarrassing explicitness . . . there is a misogynistic strain in the play which the author does not seem to recognize. . . . He has created a shameless piece of tabloid gossip, an act of exhibitionism which makes us all voyeurs, . . . a wretched piece of dramatic writing."<ref>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/258bqlwx.asp?page=2 The Moral of Arthur Miller].

In 1969, Miller's works were banned in the [[Soviet Union]] after he campaigned for the freedom of dissident writers.<ref name="chronology" /> Throughout the 1970s, Miller spent much of his time experimenting with the theatre, producing one-act plays such as ''Fame'' and ''The Reason Why'', and traveling with his wife, producing ''In The Country'' and ''Chinese Encounters'' with her. Both his 1972 comedy ''[[The Creation of the World and Other Business]]'' and its musical adaptation, ''[[Up from Paradise]]'', were critical and commercial failures.<ref>

Miller was an unusually articulate commentator on his own work.  In 1978 he published a collection of his ''Theater Essays'', edited by Robert A. Martin and with a foreword by Miller.  Highlights of the collection included Miller's introduction to his ''Collected Plays'', his reflections on the theory of tragedy, comments on the McCarthy Era, and pieces arguing for a publicly supported theater.  Reviewing this collection in the ''Chicago Tribune,'' Studs Terkel remarked, "in reading [the ''Theater Essays'']...you are exhilaratingly aware of a social critic, as well as a playwright, who knows what he's talking about."<ref>Martin, Robert A. (1978) ed., ''The Theater Essays of Arthur Miller.''  Viking, ISBN 0670698016.</ref>

In 1983, Miller traveled to China to produce and direct ''Death of a Salesman'' at the People's Art Theatre in Beijing. The play was a success in China<ref name="UMICH_60s70s80s" /> and in 1984, ''Salesman in Beijing,'' a book about Miller's experiences in Beijing, was published. Around the same time, ''Death of a Salesman'' was made into a TV movie starring [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Willy Loman. Shown on CBS, it attracted 25 million viewers.<ref name="chronology" /><ref>''The Cambridge History of American Theatre: Post-World War II to the 1990s'', page 296 ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2006).</ref> In late 1987, Miller's autobiographical work,
''Timebends'', was published. Before it was published, it was well known that Miller would not talk about Monroe in interviews; in ''Timebends'' Miller talks about his experiences with Monroe in detail.<ref name="Observer_obit" /> During the early 1990s Miller wrote three new plays, ''[[The Ride Down Mt. Morgan]]'' (1991), ''[[The Last Yankee]]'' (1992), and ''[[Broken Glass (play)|Broken Glass]]'' (1994). In 1996, a film of ''The Crucible'' starring [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] and [[Winona Ryder]] opened. Miller spent much of 1996 working on the screenplay to the film.<ref name="chronology" />
''[[Mr. Peters' Connections]]'' was staged [[Off-Broadway]] in 1998, and ''Death of a Salesman'' was revived on Broadway in 1999 to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary. The play, once again, was a large critical success, winning a Tony Award for best revival of a play.<ref>{{cite web

*''Chinese Encounters'' (1979) is a travel journal with photographs by Morath. It depicts the Chinese society in the state of flux which followed the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Miller discusses the hardships of many writers, professors, and artists as they try to regain the sense of freedom and place they lost during [[Mao Zedong]]'s regime.
