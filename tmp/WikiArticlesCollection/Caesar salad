==History==
<!-- PLEASE DO NOT' add the claim that this salad is attributed to Julius Caesar. Reliable sources do not exist for this claim, so if it is added, it will just be deleted again. -->
The salad's creation is generally attributed to restaurateur [[Caesar Cardini]], an [[Italy|Italian]] immigrant who operated restaurants in Mexico and the United States.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Cesar Cardini, Creator of Salad, Dies at 60 |url= |quote=Caesar Cardini, 60, credited with the invention of the Caesar salad, died [...] |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 5, 1956 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}
</ref> Cardini was living in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] but also working in [[Tijuana]] where he avoided the restrictions of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].<ref name=Rosa1>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Rosa Cardini |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1442086/Rosa-Cardini.html |quote=Rosa Cardini, who has died in California aged 75, turned the salad dressing created by her father, Caesar, into a staple of modern dining and a million-dollar business. Although the origin of the Caesar Salad is a topic hotly debated by epicures, the generally accepted version is that it was first popularised in the United States in the late 1920s by an Italian immigrant, born Cesare Cardini. He and his brother Alessandro moved to [[San Diego]] from [[Milan]] after the Great War and then decided to open a restaurant just across the border in Tijuana, Mexico, to attract Americans frustrated by Prohibition. |publisher=''Telegraph'' |date=September 21, 2003 |accessdate=2012-02-10 }}
</ref> His daughter Rosa (1928–2003) recounted that her father invented the dish when a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] 1924 rush depleted the kitchen's supplies.

Caesar's brother ''Alex'' had claimed to have developed the salad (he too allegedly called it "aviator's salad"). ''Livio Santini'' claimed he made the salad from a recipe of his mother, in the kitchen of Caesar's restaurant when he was 18 years old, in 1925, and that Caesar took the recipe from him.''</ref>

==Recipe==
The original Caesar salad recipe (unlike his brother Alex's ''Aviator's salad'')<ref name="grant"/> did not contain pieces of [[Anchovy (food)|anchovy]]; the slight anchovy flavor comes from the [[Worcestershire sauce]]. Cardini was opposed to using anchovies in his salad.<ref>"My father always used [[Lea and Perrins]] Worcestershire sauce, and anchovies are one of its ingredients. [...] He meant this to be a subtle salad, and anchovies can be overwhelming." (Above quoted 1987 interview with Rosa Cardini)</ref>

In the 1970s, Cardini's daughter said that the original recipe included whole lettuce leaves, which were meant to be lifted by the stem and eaten with the fingers; [[coddled egg]]s; and Italian olive oil.<ref name='child'/> 

Bottled Caesar dressings are now sold by many companies.

The trademark brands, "Cardini's", "Caesar Cardini's" and "The Original Caesar Dressing" are all claimed to date to February 1950, though they were only registered decades later,<ref>United States Patent and Trademark Office, serial numbers 73426710 "Cardini's", registered 1983 by Caesar Cardini Foods, 73782270 "The Original Caesar Dressing" and "Caesar Cardini's", registered 1989 by Dolefam Corporation, which later merged with T. Marzetti, Search at http://tess2.uspto.gov</ref> and more than a dozen varieties of bottled ''Cardini's'' dressing are available today. Some recipes include mustard, avocado, tomato, bacon bits, garlic cloves or anchovies. ''Cardini's Brand original Caesar dressing'' is somewhat different from Rosa's version.<ref>[http://www.grumpygourmetusa.com/culinary_beat2.html Review on Caesar Salad, by "The Grumpy Gourmet," Doral Chenoweth, quote:]<br />"Today the nearest to Cardini's recipe is a commercial Caesar dressing prepared and marketed by the Marzetti Co."</ref><ref>Marzetti's "Cardini's Original Caesar dressing" is made with soy oil and anchovies, and [[gluten]] free, by now— [http://www.marzetti.com/_admin/_includes/_NUTRITION/Cardini_Ceasar_Dressing.pdf Information on ingredients given by manufacturer]</ref>

Many variations of the salad exist; for example, by topping a Caesar salad with grilled chicken, steak, or seafood. Certain Mexican restaurants may improvise on items such as substituting tortilla strips for croutons or [[Cotija cheese]] for the Parmesan. <ref>[http://www.grumpygourmetusa.com/culinary_beat2.html Doral Chenoweth] on this:<br />"In my reviewing career I have found alleged Caesar salads in this country prepared with [...] [editor's note: almost anything]. It was there that I decided to take up the cause."<br/>"I walked from the border to Caesar's Bar & Grill, 5th and Main streets. The second floor ballroom was the salad restaurant. Two chefs were treating tourists to technique. They still use Cardini's preferred wooden bowls. My conversation with one of the chefs went like this:<br />
* Q - Where does the Romaine come from?<br />A - Da states.
* Q - Where does the grated Parmesan come from?<br />A - Da states.
* Q - Where do you get the eggs?<br />A - From da chickens.<br/>Those answers were satisfying. I recrossed the border vowing to defend Caesar Cardini."</ref>

** [[romaine lettuce|romaine or cos lettuce]]
** [[olive oil]]
** fresh crushed garlic – often in [[olive oil]]
** salt to taste
** fresh-ground [[black pepper]]
** wine vinegar<ref>The Rosa Cardini recipe does not call for this. As there hardly will be found an Italian salad recipe of that time without any vinegar at all, this might be just an omission.</ref>
** lemon juice or lime juice - fresh squeezed
** [[Worcestershire sauce]]
** raw or [[coddled egg]] yolks
** freshly grated [[Parmesan cheese]]
** freshly prepared [[crouton]]s

===Variations===
There are limitless variations. However, some of the more common are:

:* grilled poultry (most often chicken), meat, shellfish, or fish
:* [[capers]]

==Health concerns==

There is inherent risk of infection by [[salmonella]] bacteria occasionally found in raw egg from cracked or improperly washed eggshells.<ref>[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/egg-products-preparation/egg-products-and-food-safety/ct_index/!ut/p/a1/jZFdb8IgFIZ_DZeU4-qM7q5psqib7YzZrL0x2FJKUoEA2m2_fuhu6tcmXADnfQ-c80BykpFc0r3g1AklaXM454M1zGHQG8UwTUe9Z5gkH_P0JY5huHj0htUfhiS8M__GiOC__OkdDzyYWTzjJNfU1VjISpGMM4eptC0zlmSVUiW2tGLuC1e0cNjWjDkvMM6xNqrcFc76DdPUHMGcKVSWuHMHyQq3FrJkn2RJ8tP6oOfnJAkX_fE0CSHtnxuuAPw13CbkEfBGbY6_tYrkJhz6Xg2rmGEm2Bkfrp3TTwgQtG0bVFbYYGdLGnC19yFtEWhlHG0QHDQETmlR-LXLhflWj70j6LA79XTYIbjF7lS5VnKtrCPZRalEb9-z79doDOJtuxza6AdKMIk9/ U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service ''Egg Products and Food Safety'']</ref> This is a concern with many similar dressings that are [[emulsion|emulsified]] with eggs, though generally the [[pH]] level is thought to be [[acidic]] enough to kill those bacteria. Nevertheless, later versions of the recipe call at least for briefly cooked [[coddled egg]]s or [[pasteurized]] eggs. Recipes may omit the egg and produce a "Caesar [[vinaigrette]]". Many variations of this salad exist; in fact, [[Yogurt]] is sometimes substituted for the eggs to maintain a creamy texture and others call for using mayonnaise, oil and vinegar.
