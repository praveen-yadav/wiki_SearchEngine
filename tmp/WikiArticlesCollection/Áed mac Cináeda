'''Áed mac Cináeda''' (died 878) was a son of [[Cináed mac Ailpín]] ("Kenneth MacAlpin"). He became king of the [[Picts]] in 877 when he succeeded his brother [[Constantín mac Cináeda|Constantine I]]. He was nicknamed '''Áed of the White Flowers''', '''the Wing-footed''' ({{lang-la|alipes}}) or '''the white-foot''' ({{lang-la|albipes}}).

The ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]'' says of Áed: "Edus [Áed] held the same [i.e. the kingdom] for one year. The shortness of his reign has bequeathed nothing memorable to history. He was slain in the civitas of Nrurim." Nrurim is unidentified.

The [[Annals of Ulster]] say that in 878: "Áed mac Cináeda, king of the Picts, was killed by his associates." Tradition, reported by [[George Chalmers (antiquarian)|George Chalmers]] in his ''Caledonia'' (1807), and by the [[Statistical Accounts of Scotland|New Statistical Account]] (1834&ndash;1845), has it that the early-historic mound of the Cunninghillock by [[Inverurie]] is the burial place of Áed. This is based on reading Nrurim as ''Inruriu''.

A longer account is interpolated in [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland''. This says that Áed reigned one year and was killed by his successor [[Giric]] in [[Strathallan]] and other king lists have the same report.

It is uncertain which, if any, of the ''[[Prophecy of Berchán]]'''s kings should be taken to be Áed. [[William Forbes Skene]] presumed that the following verses referred to Áed:<blockquote>129. Another king will take [sovereignty]; small is the profit that he does not divide. Alas for Scotland thenceforward. His name will be the Furious.<br>130. He will be but a short time over Scotland. The will be no [word uncertain] unplundered. Alas for Scotland, through the youth; alas for their books, alas for their bequests.<br>131. He will be nine years in the kingdom. I shall tell you&mdash;it will be a tale of truth&mdash;he dies without bell, with communion, at evening, in a fatal pass.</blockquote>

Áed's son, [[Constantín mac Áeda]], became king in 900. The idea that [[Domnall II of Strathclyde]] was a son of Áed, based on a confusing entry in the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, is contested.
