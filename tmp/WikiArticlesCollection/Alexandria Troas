'''Alexandria Troas''' ("Alexandria of the [[Troad]]", {{lang-el|Αλεξάνδρεια Τρωάς}};{{lang-tr|Eski Stambul}}) is the site of an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city situated on the [[Aegean Sea]] near the northern tip of [[Turkey]]'s western coast, a little south of [[Tenedos]] (modern [[Bozcaada]]). It is located southeast of modern Dalyan, a village in the [[Ezine, Çanakkale|Ezine]] district of [[Çanakkale Province]]. The site sprawls over an estimated {{convert|400|ha}}; among the few structures remaining today are a ruined [[Thermae|bath]], an [[Odeon (building)|odeon]], a [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatre]], [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] complex<ref name="Freely">[[John Freely]] (2003). ''The Aegean Coast of Turkey''. Redhouse Press, Istanbul, pp.3-8.</ref> and a recently uncovered [[Stadion (running race)|stadion]].<ref name="Jacobs"/>  The circuit of the old walls can still be traced.

==History==

===Hellenistic===
According to [[Strabo]], this site was first called Sigeia;<ref name="Freely"/> around 306&nbsp;BC [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]] refounded the city as the much-expanded Antigonia Troas by settling the people of five other towns in Sigeia,<ref name="Lendering">Jona Lendering (2006). [http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexandria/alexandria_troas.html Alexandria in Troas] (from Livius.org). Retrieved 2010-4-15.</ref> including the once influential city of [[Neandreia]].<ref name="Jewett">Robert Jewett (2005). [http://www.philipharland.com/travel/TravelJewettTroas.pdf The Troas Project: Investigating Maritime and Land Routes to Clarify the Role of Alexandria Troas in Commerce and Religion.] Retrieved 2010-4-15.</ref> Its name was changed by [[Lysimachus]] to Alexandria Troas, in memory of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander III]] [[Macedon|of Macedon]] ([[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] merely states that the name changed from Antigonia to Alexandria<ref>[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Naturalis Historia'' 5:124.</ref>). As the chief port of north-west Asia Minor, the place prospered greatly in Roman times, becoming a "free and autonomous city" as early as 188&nbsp;BC,<ref name="Lendering"/> and the existing remains sufficiently attest its former importance. In its heyday the city may have had a population of about 100,000.<ref name="Jewett"/> [[Strabo]] mentions that a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] was created at the location in the reign of [[Augustus]], named Colonia Alexandria Augusta Troas (called simply Troas during this period). Augustus, [[Hadrian]] and the rich grammarian [[Herodes Atticus]] contributed greatly to its embellishment; the aqueduct still preserved is due to the latter. [[Constantine I|Constantine]] considered making Troas the capital of the [[Roman Empire]].

===Roman===
In Roman times, it was a significant port for travelling between [[Anatolia]] and Europe. [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] [[Tarsus (city)|of Tarsus]] sailed for Europe for the first time from Alexandria Troas<ref>[[Paul the Apostle|Paul of Tarsus]]. ''[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]'' 16:8-11.</ref> and returned there from Europe (it was there that the episode of the raising of [[Eutychus]] later occurred<ref>''[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]'' 20:5-12.</ref>). [[Ignatius of Antioch]] also paused at this city before continuing to his martyrdom at Rome.<ref>[[Ignatius of Antioch]]. ''Ad Philad''. 11:2; ''Ad Smyrn''. 12:1.</ref>

===Byzantine===
Several of its later [[bishop]]s are known: Marinus in 325; Niconius in 344; Sylvanus at the beginning of the 5th century; Pionius in 451; Leo in 787; Peter, friend of the [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople|Patriarch Ignatius]], and adversary to Michael, in the ninth century. In the 10th century Troas is given as a suffragan of [[Cyzicus]] and distinct from the famous [[Troy]] ([[Heinrich Gelzer]], ''Ungedruckte ... Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum'', 552; ''[[Georgii Cyprii descriptio orbis romani]]'', 64); it is not known when the city was destroyed and the diocese disappeared. The city remains a [[titular see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], ''Troadensis''; the seat is vacant following the resignation of the last bishop in 1971.<ref>David M. Cheney (1996–2010). [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d3t88.html Troas (Titular See), Catholic-Hierarchy.] Retrieved 2010-4-15.</ref>

Troas is also a titular see of the [[Orthodox Church]] under the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]]. Bishop Savas (Zembillas) of Troas<ref>Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America (2002-1-28). [http://www.goarch.org/news/goa.news92 Ordination of Bishop-Elect Savas Zembillas on Saturday, February 2, 2002 at Holy Trinity Cathedral.] Retrieved 2010-4-15.</ref> served as hierarch from 2002 to 2011, and then became [[Metropolitan Savas (Zembillas) of Pittsburgh]] in the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]].<ref>Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America (2011-11-3). [http://www.goarch.org/news/metsavaselection-11032011 Bishop Savas of Troas Elected Metropolitan of Pittsburgh]. Retrieved 2011-11-17.</ref>

===Ottoman===
[[Karasids|Karasid]] [[Oghuz Turks|Turkomans]] settled in the area of the Troad in the 14th century. Their ''[[Anatolian Turkish Beyliks|beylik]]'' was conquered by the Ottomans in 1336. The ruins of Alexandria Troas came to be known among the Turks as ''Eski Stambul'', the "Old City".<ref name="Freely"/> The site's stones were much plundered for building material (for example [[Mehmed IV]] took columns to adorn his [[Yeni Valide Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]]). As of the mid-18th century the site served as "a lurking place for bandetti".<ref>Richard Chandler. ''Travels in Asia Minor, 1764-65.'' Quoted in Freely, ''op. cit.''</ref>

===Modern===
By 1911 the site had been overgrown with [[List of Quercus species|vallonea oaks]] and much plundered, but the circuit of the old walls could still be traced, and in several places they were fairly well preserved. They had a circumference of about ten kilometres, and were fortified with towers at regular intervals. Remains of an ancient bath and gymnasium complex can be found within this area; this building is locally known as ''Bal Saray'' (Honey Palace) and was originally endowed by Herodes Atticus in the year 135.<ref name="Freely"/> [[Trajan]] built an aqueduct which can still be traced. The harbour had two large basins, now almost choked with sand. It is the subject of an early twentyfirst century study by German archaeologists digging and surveying at the site. Their excavation uncovered the remains of a large stadium dating to about 100&nbsp;BC.<ref name="Jacobs">Gina Jacobs (2010).
