{{Anime and manga}}

{{Nihongo|'''Akira Toriyama'''|鳥山 明|Toriyama Akira|born April 5, 1955|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[mangaka|manga artist]] and [[game artist]]. He is best known for his manga series ''[[Dr. Slump]]'' (1980–1984) and ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' (1984–1995), as well as for being the character designer for the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series of video games. Toriyama is regarded as one of the artists that changed the history of manga, as his works are highly influential and popular, particularly ''Dragon Ball,'' which many manga artists cite as a source of inspiration.

He earned the 1981 [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for best ''[[shōnen manga|shōnen]]'' or ''[[shōjo manga|shōjo]]'' manga with ''Dr. Slump'', and it went on to sell over 35 million copies in Japan. It was adapted into a successful [[anime]] series, with a second anime created in 1997, 13 years after the manga ended. His next series, ''Dragon Ball'', would become one of the most popular and successful manga in the world. Having sold more than 230 million copies worldwide, it is the second best-selling manga of all time and is considered to be one of the main reasons for the "Golden Age of ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump|Jump]]''," the period between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s when manga circulation was at its highest. Overseas, ''Dragon Ball'''s anime adaptations have been more successful than the manga and are credited with boosting Japanese animation's popularity in the Western world.

== Early life==
Akira Toriyama recalls that when he was in elementary school all of his classmates drew, imitating anime and manga, as a result of not having many forms of entertainment.<ref name="MoviesSpecials">{{cite book |title=DRAGON　BALL　大全集　6: MOVIES & TV SPECIALS |language=Japanese |year=1995 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |pages=212–216 |isbn=4-08-782756-9}}</ref> He believes that he began to advance above everyone else when he started drawing pictures of his friends, and after winning a prize at the local art studio for a picture of ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', began to think "art was fun."<ref name="MoviesSpecials"/> Toriyama has a love of cars and motorcycles, something he inherited from his father who used to race motorbikes and operated an auto repair business for a brief time.<ref>{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dr. Slump, Volume 14 |year=2008 |publisher=[[Viz Media]]|page=145|isbn=978-1-4215-1058-3}}</ref>

==Career==
===Early work and success 1978–2000===
Before becoming a manga artist, he worked at an [[advertising agency]] in Nagoya designing posters for three years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dr. Slump, Volume 11 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=978-1-4215-0635-7|page=48}}</ref> After quitting his previous job, Toriyama entered the manga industry by submitting a work to an amateur contest in a ''[[Jump (magazine line)|Jump]]'' magazine in order to win the prize money.<ref name="Special"/> While it did not win, [[Kazuhiko Torishima]], who would later become his editor, contacted him and gave him encouragement.<ref name="SJ interview">{{cite journal |title= |journal=[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]] |issue=1 |pages= |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |date=November 26, 2002}}</ref> His debut came later in 1978 with the story ''[[Wonder Island]]'', which was published in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]''. However, he did not rise to popularity until the comedy series ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', which was serialized in ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'' from 1980 to 1984. It follows the adventures of a perverted professor and his small but super-strong robot [[Arale Norimaki|Arale]].<ref name="ANNJT">{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Jason|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2011-03-10|title=Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga – Dragon Ball|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=March 10, 2011|accessdate=2013-03-24}}</ref> He began the series at age 25 while living at home with his parents, but when the series ended in 1984 he was a "manga superstar".<ref name="ANNJT"/> In 1981, ''Dr. Slump'' earned him the [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for best ''[[shōnen manga|shōnen]]'' or ''[[shōjo manga]]'' series of the year.<ref name="ShogakukanAward">{{cite web | url=http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html | title=小学館漫画賞: 歴代受賞者 | language=Japanese | publisher=[[Shogakukan]] | accessdate=2007-08-19}}</ref> A very successful anime adaptation aired on TV from 1981 to 1986, with a remake series airing from 1997 to 1999.

In 1984, ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'' began serializing Toriyama's ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', which became an instant hit. To date it has sold over 156 million copies in Japan, making it [[Shueisha]]'s second best-selling manga of all time.<ref name="Shueishabest">{{cite web |title=Top 10 Shonen Jump Manga by All-Time Volume Sales|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-10-23/top-10-shonen-jump-manga-by-all-time-volume-sales |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=October 23, 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref> It began as an adventure/gag manga but later turned into a martial arts fighting series, considered by many to be the "most influential shōnen manga".<ref name="ANNJT"/> ''Dragon Ball'' was one of the main reasons for the "Golden Age of ''Jump''," when the magazine's circulation was at a record high of 6.53 million copies (1995).<ref name="IbarakiInterview">{{cite web |url=http://comipress.com/article/2008/03/31/3452 |title=The Reminiscence of My 25 Years with Shonen Jump |last=Ibaraki |first=Masahiko |coauthors=Ohara, T.

At the series' end, Toriyama said that he asked everyone involved to let him end the manga, so he could "take some new steps in life".<ref>{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 42 |year=1995 |publisher=[[Shueisha]]|isbn=978-4-08-851090-3}}</ref> During that 11-year period, he produced 519 chapters that were collected into 42 volumes. Moreover, the success of the manga led to three anime adaptations, [[List of Dragon Ball films|several animated movies]], [[List of Dragon Ball video games|numerous video games]], and mega-merchandising. The third anime adaptation, ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'', was not based on his manga; however, Toriyama was still involved in coming up with the name and designing the main cast.<ref name="GTDragonBox">{{cite book |title=Dragon Ball GT Dragon Box: Dragon Book |publisher=[[Pony Canyon]]|year=2005|page=1|language=Japanese}}</ref> Aside from its popularity in Japan, ''Dragon Ball'' was successful internationally as well, including in Europe and North America, with a total of 230 million copies of the manga sold worldwide.<ref name="230mil">{{cite web|title= 2013's Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods Film Story Outlined|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2012-12-03/2013-dragon-ball-z/battle-of-gods-film-story-outlined|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=December 3, 2012|accessdate=2012-12-06}}</ref>

Toriyama's design sense led to a position designing characters for the popular ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series of [[role-playing video game]]s (formerly called ''Dragon Warrior'' in North America). He has also served as the character designer for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] RPG ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' and for the [[fighting game]]s ''[[Tobal No. 1]]'' and ''[[Tobal 2]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].

Toriyama's own studio is called Bird Studio, which is a play on his name; {{nihongo|"tori"|鳥}} meaning "bird". Toriyama does nearly all of the work at Bird Studio himself, and even when he employed an assistant (until 1995, and only one at a time, which is itself rare for manga artists), the assistant did mostly backgrounds. The studio has produced occasional one-shots, or stand-alone manga that are not serialized, and some other design work. Toriyama's manga after ''Dragon Ball'' tend to be short (100–200-page) stories, including ''[[Cowa!]]'', ''[[Kajika]]'', and ''[[Sand Land]]''.

===2002–present===
On December 6, 2002, Toriyama made his first and only promotional appearance in the United States at the launch of ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'''s North American counterpart, ''[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]'', in New York City.<ref>{{cite web |title=Akira Toriyama To Appear at Shonen Jump Launch Party |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-12-02/akira-toriyama-to-appear-at-shonen-jump-launch-party |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=December 2, 2002 |accessdate=2013-03-24}}</ref> Toriyama's ''Dragon Ball'' and ''Sand Land'' were published in the magazine in the first issue, which also included an in-depth interview with him.<ref>{{cite web |title=Shonen Jump No. 1 Contents |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-10-03/shonen-jump-no.1-contents |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=October 3, 2002 |accessdate=2013-03-24}}</ref>

On March 27, 2005, CQ Motors began selling an [[electric car]] designed by Toriyama.<ref name="car">{{cite web |title=Akira Toriyama Car |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-01-31/akira-toriyama-car |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=January 31, 2005 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref> The one-person QVOLT is part of the company's [[Choro-Q]] series of small electric cars, with only 9 being produced.

Toriyama stated that the car took over a year to design, "but due to my genius mini-model construction skills, I finally arrived at the end of what was a very emotional journey."<ref name="car"/>

He worked on a 2006 [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] called ''[[Cross Epoch (manga)|Cross Epoch]]'', in cooperation with ''[[One Piece]]'' creator [[Eiichiro Oda]]. The story is a short [[Intercompany crossover|crossover]] that presents characters from both ''Dragon Ball'' and ''One Piece''. Toriyama was the character designer and artist for the 2006 [[Mistwalker]] [[Xbox 360]] exclusive RPG ''[[Blue Dragon]]'', working with [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] and [[Nobuo Uematsu]], both of whom he had previously worked with on ''Chrono Trigger''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Toriyama to work on Xbox 360 game |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-05-17/toriyama-to-work-on-xbox-360-game |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=May 17, 2005 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref> He announced that his help with the making of the [[Blue Dragon#Anime|''Blue Dragon'' anime]] might very well be his final work in anime. In his own words, he said:
{{quote|The offer to direct an animated version of ''Blue Dragon'' came in February of last year [2006]. [[Studio Pierrot]] approached me regarding it. I knew that Sakaguchi had been working on assembling staff to produce a game, although at the time ''Blue Dragon'' hadn't yet been formally announced. According to the materials, it was to be a fantasy world like ''[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]'', with a detailed world view and story. This may be my final anime, I'm a little worried (about it). There's incredible pressure, but at the same time, there's a sense of accomplishment – that it's worth doing. ''Blue Dragon'' will be a masterpiece, not simply because I'm working hard on it, but because the staff is expecting nothing less.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/blue-dragon/blue-dragon-toriyamas-final-anime-247955.php|title=Blue Dragon, Toriyama's Final Anime?|author=Brian Ashcraft|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110713170411/http://kotaku.com/gaming/blue-dragon/blue-dragon-toriyamas-final-anime-247955.php|archivedate=July 13, 2011|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=March 27, 2007}}</ref>}}

[[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]] declared Toriyama's art influential, saying that his "extremely personal and recognizable style" was a reason for ''Dragon Ball'''s popularity.<ref name="ANNJT"/> He points out that the popular shōnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had "[[Masculinity|manly]]" heroes, such as ''[[City Hunter]]'' and ''[[Fist of the North Star]]'', whereas ''Dragon Ball'' starred the cartoonish and small [[Goku]], thus starting a trend that Thompson says continues to this day.<ref name="ANNJT"/> Toriyama himself said he went against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, designing many of the series' most powerful characters with small statures.<ref name="SJ interview 2">{{cite journal |title=Interview with the Majin!

Yadao, author of ''The Rough Guide to Manga'', points out that an art shift does occur in the series, as the characters gradually "lose the rounded, innocent look that [Toriyama] established in ''Dr. Slump'' and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity."<ref>Yadao, James S.
