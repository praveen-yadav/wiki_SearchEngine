The '''Bay of Quinte''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɪ|n|t|i}} is a long, narrow bay shaped like the letter "Z" on the northern shore of [[Lake Ontario]] in the province of [[Ontario]], Canada. It is just west of the head of the [[Saint Lawrence River]] that drains the [[Great Lakes]] into the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. It is located about {{convert|200|km|mi|spell=us}} east of [[Toronto]] and {{convert|400|km|mi|spell=us}} west of [[Montreal]].

The name "Quinte" is derived from "''Kente''", which was the name of an early French Catholic [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] located on the south shore of what is now [[Prince Edward County, Ontario|Prince Edward County]].<ref>[http://www.greatcanadianlakes.com/ontario/lake_ontario/cul_page3.htm Great Canadian Lakes, Lake Ontario - Saving Souls in Kente] Retrieved: 2010-04-15</ref> Officially, in the [[Mohawk language]], the community is called '''"Kenhtè:ke"''' which means "the place of the bay".  The [[Cayuga language|Cayuga]] name is ''Tayęda:ne:gęˀ or Detgayę:da:negęˀ'', "land of two logs."<ref name="cayugalanguage.ca">{{Cite web

The Bay, as it is known locally, provides some of the best trophy [[Walleye]] angling in North America as well as most sport fish common to the great lakes.  The bay is subject to [[algae bloom]]s in late summer which are a naturally occurring phenomenon and do not indicate pollution other than from agricultural runoff.  [[Zebra mussel]]s as well as the other invasive species found in the great lakes are present.

The Quinte area played a vital role in bootlegging during [[Prohibition in the United States]], with large volumes of booze being produced in the area, and shipped via boat on the Bay to [[Lake Ontario]] finally arriving in New York State where it was distributed.  Illegal sales of liquor accounted for many fortunes in and around [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]].

Tourism in the area is significant, especially in the summer months due to the Bay of Quinte and its fishing, local golf courses, provincial parks, and wineries.

==Geography==
[[File:BayofQuinteMap-1108.JPG|thumb|left|240px|Map of the Bay of Quinte Area]]
The northern side of the bay is defined by Ontario's mainland, while the southern side follows the shore of the Prince Edward County headland. Beginning in the east with the outlet to Lake Ontario, the bay runs west-southwest for {{convert|25|km|mi|sp=us}} to [[Picton, Ontario|Picton]] (although this section is also called Adolphus Reach), where it turns north-northwest for another {{convert|20|km|mi|sp=us}} as far as [[Deseronto, Ontario|Deseronto]]. From there it turns south-southwest again for another {{convert|40|km|mi|sp=us}}, running past [[Big Island (Bay of Quinte)|Big Island]] on the south and [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]] on the north. The width of the bay rarely exceeds two kilometers. The bay ends at [[Trenton, Ontario|Trenton]] ([[Quinte West, Ontario|Quinte West]]) and the [[Trent River (Ontario)|Trent River]], both also on the north side. The [[Murray Canal]] has been cut through the "Carrying Place", the few miles separating the end of the bay and Lake Ontario on the west side. The Trent River is part of the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]], a canal connecting Lake Ontario to [[Lake Simcoe]] and then [[Georgian Bay]] on [[Lake Huron]].

There are several sub-bays off the Bay of Quinte, including Hay Bay, Big Bay, and Muscote Bay.

==Quinte Region==
'''Quinte''' is also a region comprising several communities situated along the Bay of Quinte, including [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]] which is the largest city in the Quinte Region, and represents a midpoint between [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], and [[Toronto]].

The Greater Bay of Quinte area includes the municipalities of Brighton, Quinte West, Belleville, Prince Edward County, and Greater Napanee as well as the Native [[Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory]].  Overall population of the area exceeds 200,000.<ref>[http://www.quintedevelopment.com/v2/assets/File/Population%202006.pdf Demographics of the greater Bay of Quinte region] Retrieved: 2010-04-19</ref>

===Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte===
The [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk First Nations]] of the Bay of Quinte (Kenhtè:ke Kanyen'kehá:ka) <ref name="JohansenMann2000" /> on traditional [[Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory]].  Their  [[Indian reserve|reserve]] Band number 244, their current land base, is a 73&nbsp;km² (18000-[[acre]]) on the Bay of Quinte in southeastern [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], east of [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]] and immediately to the west of [[Deseronto, Ontario|Deseronto]].<ref name="JohansenMann2000"/> 

The community takes its name from a variant spelling of Mohawk leader [[Joseph Brant]]'s traditional Mohawk name, Thayendanegea (standardized spelling Thayentiné:ken), which means 'two pieces of fire wood beside each other'.<ref name="Tyendinaga">Isaac, Ruth et al. ''A Spelling Worldist of Six Nations Mohawk''. Brantford: The Woodland Indian Cultural-Educational Centre, 1986. Print</ref> Officially, in the [[Mohawk language]], the community is called '''"Kenhtè:ke"''' (Tyendinaga) which means "on the bay" the birthplace of Tekanawí:ta.  The [[Cayuga language|Cayuga]] name is Tyendinaga, ''Tayęda:ne:gęˀ or Detgayę:da:negęˀ'', "land of two logs."<ref name="cayugalanguage.ca"/>)
