'''Cannibalism''' (from ''Caníbales'', the Spanish name for the [[Carib people]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cannibalism?r=66 |title=Cannibalism Definition |publisher=Dictionary.com}}</ref> a West Indies tribe formerly well known for practicing cannibalism)<ref name="britannica cannibalism">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/92701/cannibalism |title=cannibalism (human behaviour) |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}</ref> is the act or practice of humans eating the flesh or internal organs of other human beings. It is also called '''anthropophagy'''. A person who practices cannibalism is called a cannibal. The expression "cannibalism" has been extended into [[zoology]] to mean one individual of a species [[cannibalism (zoology)|consuming all or part]] of another individual of the same species as food, including [[sexual cannibalism]].

The [[Carib people|Carib]] tribe in the [[Lesser Antilles]], from whom the word cannibalism derives, acquired a long-standing reputation as cannibals following the recording of their legends in the 17th century.<ref name="brief history"/> Some controversy exists over the accuracy of these legends and the prevalence of actual cannibalism in the culture.  Cannibalism was widespread in the past among humans in many parts of the world, continuing into the 19th century in some isolated [[Australasia|South Pacific]] cultures, and to the present day in parts of tropical Africa. In a few cases in insular [[Melanesia]], indigenous flesh-markets existed.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=YM18gG16Z7YC&pg=PA104&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false From primitive to post-colonial in Melanesia and anthropology]''.

Cannibalism has been occasionally practiced as a last resort by people suffering from [[famine]], including in modern times. A famous example is the ill-fated Westward expedition of the [[Donner Party]], and more recently the crash of [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]], after which some survivors ate the bodies of dead passengers. Also, some mentally ill people obsess about eating others and actually do so, such as [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] and [[Albert Fish]]. There is resistance to formally labeling cannibalism as a [[mental disorder]].<ref name="strightdope">[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2515/eat-or-be-eaten Eat or be eaten: Is cannibalism a pathology as listed in the DSM-IV?] [[The Straight Dope]] by Cecil Adams.

In some societies, especially tribal societies, cannibalism is a [[cultural norm]]. Consumption of a person from within the same community is called [[endocannibalism]]; ritual cannibalism of the recently deceased can be part of the grieving process,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Woznicki |first=Andrew N. |year=1998 |title=Endocannibalism of the Yanomami |url=http://users.rcn.com/salski/No18-19Folder/Endocannibalism.htm |journal=The Summit Times |volume=6 |issue=18-19}}</ref> or a way of guiding the souls of the dead into the bodies of living descendants.<ref name=DowEncyc>{{cite book |last=Dow |first=James W. |editor-last=Tenenbaum |editor-first=Barbara A. |url=https://files.oakland.edu/users/dow/web/personal/papers/cannibal/cannibal.html |chapter=Cannibalism |title=Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture – Volume 1 |pages=535–537 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |location=New York}}</ref> [[Exocannibalism]] is the consumption of a person from outside the community, usually as a celebration of victory against a rival tribe.<ref name=DowEncyc/> Both types of cannibalism can also be fueled by the belief that eating a person's flesh or internal organs will endow the cannibal with some of the characteristics of the deceased.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Goldman |editor-first=Laurence |year=1999 |title=The Anthropology of Cannibalism |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QyiDClqjwSUC&pg=PA16 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |page=16 |isbn=0-89789-596-7}}</ref>

In most parts of the world, cannibalism is not a societal norm, but is sometimes resorted to in situations of extreme necessity. The survivors of the shipwrecks of the ''[[Essex (whaleship)|Essex]]'' and ''[[French frigate Méduse (1810)|Méduse]]'' in the 19th century are said to have engaged in cannibalism, as are the members of [[Franklin's lost expedition]] and the [[Donner Party]]. Such cases generally involve necro-cannibalism (eating the corpse of someone who is already dead) as opposed to homicidal cannibalism (killing someone for food). In English law, the latter is always considered a crime, even in the most trying circumstances. The case of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', in which two men were found guilty of murder for killing and eating a cabin boy while adrift at sea in a lifeboat, set the precedent that [[Necessity in English law|necessity]] is no defence to a charge of murder.

There are numerous examples of murderers consuming their victims, often deriving some degree of sexual satisfaction from the act of cannibalism. Notable examples include [[Albert Fish]], [[Issei Sagawa]] and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]]. These individuals are usually considered to be [[mentally ill]], although the compulsion to eat human flesh is not formally listed as a mental disorder in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM).<ref name="strightdope"/> Cases of [[autophagia]], or self-cannibalism, have also been reported.

In pre-modern medicine, the explanation given by the now-discredited theory of [[humorism]] for cannibalism was that it came about within a black acrimonious [[four humours|humour]], which, being lodged in the linings of the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]], produced the voracity for human flesh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0147&q1=anthropophagy |publisher="1728 Cyclopaedia"|title=Anthropophagy}}</ref>

== Medical aspects ==

A well known case of mortuary cannibalism is that of the [[Fore (people)|Fore]] tribe in [[New Guinea]] which resulted in the spread of the [[prion]] disease [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Lindenbaum S |title=Understanding kuru: the contribution of anthropology and medicine |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond., B, Biol. Sci. |volume=363 |issue=1510 |pages=3715–20 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18849287 |pmc=2735506 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0072|ref=harv}}</ref> Although the Fore's mortuary cannibalism was well documented, the practice had ceased before the cause of the disease was recognized. However, some scholars argue that although post-mortem dismemberment was the practice during funeral rites, cannibalism was not. [[Marvin Harris]] theorizes that it happened during a famine period coincident with the arrival of Europeans and was rationalized as a religious rite.

In 2003 a publication in ''Science'' received a large amount of press attention when it suggested that early humans may have practiced extensive cannibalism.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Mead S, Stumpf MP, Whitfield J, ''et al.'' |title=Balancing selection at the prion protein gene consistent with prehistoric kurulike epidemics |journal=Science |volume=300 |issue=5619 |pages=640–3 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12690204 |doi=10.1126/science.1083320 |url=http://www.gs.washington.edu/news/article.pdf|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/11/us/gene-study-finds-cannibal-pattern.html |title=Gene Study Finds Cannibal Pattern |work=New York Times |author=Nicholas Wade |date=April 11, 2003}}</ref> According to this research, genetic markers commonly found in modern humans worldwide suggest that today many people carry a gene that evolved as protection against the [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|brain diseases]] that can be spread by consuming human brain tissue.<ref name="Cannibalism Normal in the Past">{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/04/0410_030410_cannibal.html|publisher="National Geographic"|title=Cannibalism Normal?}}</ref> A 2006 reanalysis of the data questioned this hypothesis,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Soldevila M, Andrés AM, Ramírez-Soriano A, ''et al.'' |title=The prion protein gene in humans revisited: Lessons from a worldwide resequencing study |journal=Genome Res. |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=231–9 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16369046 |pmc=1361719 |doi=10.1101/gr.4345506|ref=harv }}</ref> as it claimed to have found a data collection bias, which led to an erroneous conclusion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/22927/|publisher="New Scientist"|title=No cannibalism signature in human gene}}</ref> This claimed bias came from incidents of cannibalism used in the analysis not being due to local cultures, but having been carried out by explorers, stranded seafarers or escaped convicts.<ref>See [http://www.warriors.egympie.com.au/cannibalism.html ''Cannibalism – Some Hidden Truths''] for an example documenting escaped convicts in Australia who initially blamed natives, but later confessed to conducting the practice themselves out of desperate hunger.</ref> The original authors published a subsequent paper in 2008 defending their conclusions.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Mead S, Whitfield J, Poulter M, ''et al.'' |title=Genetic susceptibility, evolution and the kuru epidemic |journal=Philos.

==Myths, legends and folklore==
[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham.jpg|thumb|180px|''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'', illustrated by [[Arthur Rackham]].]]
[[File:Francisco de Goya, Saturno devorando a su hijo (1819-1823).jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of a ghoulish, naked man holding a bloody, naked body and devouring the arm.|''[[Saturn Devouring His Son]]'', from the [[Black Paintings]] series by [[Francisco de Goya]], 1819]]
Cannibalism features in the folklore and legends of many cultures and is most often attributed to evil characters or as extreme retribution for some wrong. Examples include
the [[witch]] in "[[Hansel and Gretel]]", [[Lamia (mythology)|Lamia]] of [[Greek mythology]] and [[Baba Yaga]] of [[Slavic folklore]].

A number of stories in [[Greek mythology]] involve cannibalism, in particular cannibalism of close family members, for example the stories of [[Thyestes]], [[Tereus]] and especially [[Cronus]], who was [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] in the Roman pantheon. The story of [[Tantalus]] also parallels this. 

The [[wendigo]] is a creature appearing in the [[Native American mythology|legends]] of the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] people. It is thought of variously as a malevolent cannibalistic spirit that could [[spiritual possession|possess]] humans or a monster that humans could physically transform into. Those who indulged in cannibalism were at particular risk,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brightman |first=Robert A. |year=1988 |title=The Windigo in the Material World |journal=Ethnohistory |volume=35 |issue=4 |doi=10.2307/482140 |pages=337–379 |jstor=482140 |ref=harv}}</ref> and the legend appears to have reinforced this practice as [[taboo]].

==As used to demonize colonized or other groups==
{{See also|Blood libel}}
Unsubstantiated reports of cannibalism disproportionately relate cases of cannibalism among cultures that are already otherwise despised, feared, or are little known. In antiquity, Greek reports of cannibalism, (often called ''anthropophagy'' in this context) were related to distant non-Hellenic [[barbarians]], or else relegated in [[Greek mythology]] to the 'primitive' [[chthonic]] world that preceded the coming of the Olympian gods: see the explicit rejection of human sacrifice in the cannibal feast prepared for the Olympians by [[Tantalus]] of his son [[Pelops]]. All South Sea Islanders were cannibals so far as their enemies were concerned. When the [[whaleship Essex]] was rammed and sunk by a whale in 1820, the captain opted to sail 3000 miles upwind to [[Chile]] rather than 1400 miles downwind to the [[Marquesas]] because he had heard the Marquesans were cannibals. Ironically many of the survivors of the shipwreck resorted to cannibalism to survive.

However, Herman Melville happily lived with the Marquesan Typees for a time after the other two tribes on the island told him they were cannibals. In his semi-autobiographical novel ''[[Typee]]'', he reports seeing [[shrunken heads]] and having strong evidence that the tribal leaders ceremonially consumed the bodies of killed warriors of the neighboring tribe after a skirmish.

[[William Arens]], author of ''[[The Man-Eating Myth|The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology and Anthropophagy]]'',<ref>(New York: Oxford University Press, 1979; ISBN 0-19-502793-0)</ref> questions the credibility of reports of cannibalism and argues that the description by one group of people of another people as cannibals is a consistent and demonstrable ideological and rhetorical device to establish perceived [[Cultural imperialism|cultural superiority]]. Arens bases his thesis on a detailed analysis of numerous "classic" cases of cultural cannibalism cited by explorers, missionaries, and anthropologists. He asserted that many were steeped in racism, unsubstantiated, or based on second-hand or hearsay evidence.<ref>{{Cite book

Arens' findings are controversial, and have been cited as an example of [[postcolonial]] [[historical revisionism|revisionism]].<ref>Timothy Taylor, ''The Buried Soul: How Humans Invented Death'', Pages 58–60, Fourth Estate 2002</ref> 

Conversely, [[Michel de Montaigne]]'s essay "Of cannibals" introduced a new multicultural note in European civilization. Montaigne wrote that "one calls 'barbarism' whatever he is not accustomed to".<ref>de Montaigne, Michel.

===Pre-history===
Some anthropologists, such as [[Tim White (anthropologist)|Tim White]], suggest that ritual cannibalism was common in human societies prior to the beginning of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period. This theory is based on the large amount of "butchered human" bones found in [[Neanderthal]] and other Lower/Middle Paleolithic sites.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=-TVHr_XtDJcC&pg=PA338&lpg=PA338&dq=paleolithic+cannibalism|title= Once were Cannibals |work=Evolution: A Scientific American Reader|author=Tim D white |accessdate=February 14, 2008 |isbn=978-0-226-74269-4 |date=September 15, 2006}}</ref> Cannibalism in the Lower and Middle Paleolithic may have occurred because of food shortages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/12/061205-cannibals.html|title=Neandertals Turned to Cannibalism, Bone Cave Suggests |work=National Geographic News |author=James Owen |accessdate=February 3, 2008}}</ref> 
It has been also suggested that removing dead bodies through ritual cannibalism might been a means of predator control, aiming to eliminate predators' and scavengers' access to hominid (and early human) bodies.<ref>Jordania, Joseph (2011). ''[[Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution]]''. Logos. pp. 119–121.</ref> [[Jim Corbett (hunter)|Jim Corbett]] proposed that after major epidemics, when human corpses are easily accessible to predators, there are more cases of man-eating leopards,<ref>Corbett, Jim (2003).

Oxford University Press, 26th impression. pp. xv-xvi.</ref> so removing dead bodies through ritual cannibalism (before the cultural traditions of burying and burning bodies appeared in human history) might have had practical reasons for hominids and early humans to control predation.

In [[Gough's Cave]], England, remains of human bones and skulls, around 15,000 years old, suggest that cannibalism took place amongst the people living in or visiting the cave,<ref>{{cite news|last=McKie|first=Robin|title=Bones from a Cheddar Gorge cave show that cannibalism helped Britain's earliest settlers survive the ice age|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/jun/20/ice-age-cannibals-britain-earliest-settlers|accessdate=June 20, 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=June 20, 2010|location=London}}</ref> and that they may have used human skulls as [[Skull cup|drinking vessels]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bello, Silvia M.

According to one historical account, aboriginal tribes of Australia were "most certainly cannibals", and would willingly eat anyone who was killed in a fight; they would also eat men famed for their fighting ability who had died natural deaths "...&nbsp;out of pity and consideration for the body".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seqhistory.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=99%3Apart1chpt3&catid=42%3Atom-petrie&Itemid=67&limitstart=2|title=Tom Petrie's Reminiscences of Early Queensland |author=Petrie, C.C. |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110716041513/http://www.seqhistory.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=99:part1chpt3&catid=42:tom-petrie&Itemid=67&limitstart=2|archivedate=July 16, 2011}}</ref>

===Early history===
Cannibalism is mentioned many times in early history and literature. It is reported in the Bible during the siege of [[Samaria]] (2 Kings 6:25–30). Two women made a pact to eat their children; after the first mother cooked her child the second mother ate it but refused to reciprocate by cooking her own child. A similar story is reported by [[Flavius Josephus]] during the siege of Jerusalem by Rome in 70 AD (see [[Mary of Bethezuba]]), and the population of Numantia during the Roman [[Siege of Numantia]] in the 2nd century BC was reduced to cannibalism and suicide.

[[St. Jerome]], in his letter ''[[Against Jovinianus]]'', discusses how people come to their present condition as a result of their heritage, and then lists several examples of peoples and their customs. In the list, he mentions that he has heard that [[Attacotti|Atticoti]] eat human flesh and that [[Massagetae]] and ''Derbices'' (a people on the borders of India) kill and eat old people. <!--(The [[Tibareni]] crucify those whom they have loved before when they have grown old.)--><ref>{{Cite book

Researchers have found physical evidence of cannibalism in ancient times. In 2001, archaeologists at the University of Bristol found evidence of [[Iron Age]] cannibalism in Gloucestershire.<ref>[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2001/cannibal.htm Cannibalistic Celts discovered in South Gloucestershire] March 7, 2001</ref> Cannibalism was practiced as recently as 2000 years ago in Great Britain.<ref>"[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/03/090320-druids-sacrifice-cannibalism_2.html Druids Committed Human Sacrifice, Cannibalism?]".

[[Ugolino della Gherardesca]] was an Italian [[nobility|nobleman]] who, together with his sons Gaddo and Uguccione and his grandsons Nino and Anselmuccio were detained in the [[Torre dei Gualandi|Muda]], in March 1289. The keys were thrown into the [[Arno]] river and the prisoners left to starve. According to [[Dante]], the prisoners were slowly starved to death and before dying Ugolino's children begged him to eat their bodies.]]
Reports of cannibalism were recorded during the [[First Crusade]], as Crusaders were alleged to have fed on the bodies of their dead opponents following the [[Siege of Ma'arrat al-Numan]]. [[Amin Maalouf]] also alleges further cannibalism incidents on the march to [[Jerusalem]], and to the efforts made to delete mention of these from western history.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Maalouf, Amin |title=The Crusades Through Arab Eyes |publisher= [[Schocken Books]] |location=New York |year=1984 |pages=37–40 |isbn=0-8052-0898-4 }}</ref> During Europe's [[Great Famine of 1315–1317]] there were many reports of cannibalism among the starving populations. In North Africa, as in Europe, there are references to cannibalism as a last resort in times of [[famine]].<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/196038 Cannibalism in Early Modern North Africa], British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies</ref>

The Moroccan Muslim explorer [[Ibn Batutta]] reported that one African king advised him that nearby people were cannibals (though this may have been a prank played on Ibn Batutta by the king to fluster his guest). However Batutta reported that Arabs and Christians were safe, as their flesh was "unripe" and would cause the eater to fall ill.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

For a brief time in Europe, an unusual form of cannibalism occurred when thousands of [[Mummy#Egyptian mummies as a commodity|Egyptian mummies]] preserved in [[bitumen]] were ground up and sold as medicine.<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=December 3, 2007}}</ref> The practice developed into a wide-scale business which flourished until the late 16th century. This "fad" ended because the mummies were revealed actually to be recently killed slaves. Two centuries ago, mummies were still believed to have medicinal properties against bleeding, and were sold as [[pharmaceutical]]s in powdered form (see [[Mellified Man|human mummy confection]] and [[mummia]]).<ref name="Daly flesh">Quotes from [[John Sanderson (merchant)|John Sanderson]]'s ''Travels'' (1586) in ''[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0029-5132(199423)28%3A1%3C24%3ATOOODV%3E2.0.CO%3B2-8 That Obscure Object of Desire: Victorian Commodity Culture and Fictions of the Mummy]'', [[Nicholas Daly]], NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction, Vol. 28, No. 1 (Autumn, 1994), pp. 24–51. {{doi|10.2307/1345912}}</ref>

In China during the [[Tang Dynasty]], cannibalism was supposedly resorted to by rebel forces early in the period (who were said to raid neighboring areas for victims to eat), as well as both soldiers and civilians besieged during the rebellion of [[An Lushan Rebellion|An Lushan]]. Eating an enemy's heart and liver was also claimed to be a feature of both official punishments and private vengeance.<ref>{{cite book |last=Benn |first=Charles |title=China's Golden Age: Everyday Life in the Tang Dynasty |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-517665-0 |pages=123–124}}</ref> References to cannibalizing the enemy has also been seen in poetry written in the [[Song Dynasty]], (for example, in ''[[Man Jiang Hong]]'') although the cannibalizing is perhaps poetic symbolism, expressing hatred towards the enemy.

While there is universal agreement that some [[Mesoamerican]] people practiced [[human sacrifice]], there is a lack of scholarly consensus as to whether [[cannibalism in pre-Columbian America]] was widespread. At one extreme, anthropologist Marvin Harris, author of ''[[Cannibals and Kings]]'', has suggested that the flesh of the victims was a part of an aristocratic diet as a reward, since the [[Aztec]] diet was lacking in [[protein]]s. While most pre-Columbian historians believe that there was ritual cannibalism related to human sacrifices, they do not support Harris's thesis that human flesh was ever a significant portion of the Aztec diet.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DE1F3DF935A35752C0A961948260 To Aztecs, Cannibalism Was a Status Symbol], New York Times</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/aztecs/montellano.htm |title=Aztec Cannibalism: An Ecological Necessity? |publisher=Latinamericanstudies.org |accessdate=August 30, 2009}}</ref><ref>Bernard R.

===Early modern era===
[[File:Cannibalism.jpg|thumb|260px|The spread of human cannibalism (anthropophagy) in the late 19th century.]]
European explorers and colonizers brought home many stories of cannibalism practiced by the native peoples they encountered. The friar [[Diego de Landa]] reported about [[Yucatán]] instances,<ref>{{Cite book|last=De Landa|first=Diego|title=Yucatán before and after the Conquest|year=1978|publisher=Dover|page=4}}</ref> and there have been similar reports by Purchas from Popayán, [[Colombia]], and from the [[Marquesas Islands]] of [[Polynesia]], where human flesh was called ''long pig''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Robert Louis Stevenson in the South Seas|year=1987|publisher=Luzac Paragon House|pages=45–50|editor=Alanna King}}</ref> According to [[Hans Egede]], the [[Inuit]]s, when they killed a woman accused of witchcraft, ate a portion of her heart.<ref>"[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Cannibalism Cannibalism]". The Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition.</ref> It is recorded about the natives of the captaincy of [[Sergipe]] in Brazil: "They eat human flesh when they can get it, and if a woman miscarries devour the abortive immediately. If she goes her time out, she herself cuts the [[umbilical cord|navel-string]] with a [[seashell|shell]], which she boils along with the [[placenta|secondine]], and eats them both."<ref>E. Bowen, 1747: 532</ref>

The 1913 ''Handbook of Indians of Canada'' (reprinting 1907 material from the Bureau of American Ethnology), claims that North American natives practicing cannibalism included "...&nbsp;the [[Innu|Montagnais]], and some of the tribes of [[Maine]]; the [[Algonquin people|Algonkin]], [[Armouchiquois]], [[Iroquois]], and [[Mi'kmaq people|Micmac]]; farther west the [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]], [[Cree]], [[Fox (tribe)|Foxes]], [[Chippewa]], [[Miami (tribe)|Miami]], [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Illinois (tribe)|Illinois]], [[Sioux]], and [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]]; in the South the people who built the mounds in Florida, and the [[Tonkawa]], [[Attacapa]], [[Karankawa]], [[Caddo]], and [[Comanche]] (?); in the Northwest and West, portions of the continent, the [[Thlingchadinneh]] and other [[Athapascan]] tribes, the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Heiltsuk people|Heiltsuk]], [[Kwakiutl]], [[Tsimshian]], [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]], [[Siksika]], some of the Californian tribes, and the [[Ute Tribe|Ute]]. There is also a tradition of the practice among the [[Hopi]], and mentions of the custom among other tribes of [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]]. The [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], and the [[Attacapa]], [[Tonkawa]], and other Texas tribes were known to their neighbours as 'man-eaters.'"<ref>[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/QuebecHistory/encyclopedia/cannibalism.htm cannibalism], James WHITE, ed., Handbook of Indians of Canada, Published as an Appendix to the Tenth Report of the Geographic Board of Canada, Ottawa, 1913, 632p., pp. 77–78.</ref> The forms of cannibalism described included both resorting to human flesh during famines and ritual cannibalism, the latter usually consisting of eating a small portion of an enemy warrior.

As with most lurid tales of native cannibalism, these stories are treated with a great deal of scrutiny, as accusations of cannibalism were often used as justifications for the subjugation or destruction of "savages".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} However, there were several well-documented cultures that engaged in regular eating of the dead, such as New Zealand's [[Māori people|Māori]]. In an 1809 incident known as the [[Boyd massacre]], about 66 passengers and crew of the ''Boyd'' were killed and eaten by Māori on the Whangaroa peninsula, Northland. Cannibalism was already a regular practice in Māori wars.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10462390">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=252&objectid=10462390 |title='Battle rage' fed Maori cannibalism |author=Masters, Catherine |date=September 8, 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=September 23, 2011}}</ref> In another instance, on July 11, 1821 warriors from the Ngapuhi tribe killed 2,000 enemies and remained on the battlefield "eating the vanquished until they were driven off by the smell of decaying bodies".<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/H/HongiHika/HongiHika/en HONGI HIKA (c. 1780–1828) Ngapuhi war chief], the Encyclopedia of New Zealand.</ref> Māori warriors fighting the New Zealand government in [[Titokowaru's War]] in New Zealand's North Island in 1868–69 revived ancient rites of cannibalism as part of the radical [[Hauhau movement]] of the [[Pai Marire]] religion.<ref>[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow02NewZ-c20.html James Cowan, The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Volume II, 1922.]</ref>

Other islands in the Pacific were home to cultures that allowed cannibalism to some degree. In parts of [[Melanesia]], cannibalism was still practiced in the early 20th century, for a variety of reasons&nbsp;— including retaliation, to insult an enemy people, or to absorb the dead person's qualities.<ref>"Melanesia Historical and Geographical: the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides". ''Southern Cross'' (1). Church Army Press.

The dense population of [[Marquesas Islands]], [[Polynesia]], was concentrated in the narrow valleys, and consisted of warring tribes, who sometimes practiced cannibalism on their enemies. W. D. Rubinstein wrote:

{{quote|It was considered a great triumph among the Marquesans to eat the body of a dead man. They treated their captives with great cruelty. They broke their legs to prevent them from attempting to escape before being eaten, but kept them alive so that they could brood over their impending fate.&nbsp;... With this tribe, as with many others, the bodies of women were in great demand.<ref name="history"/>}}

This period of time was also rife with instances of explorers and seafarers resorting to cannibalism for survival. The survivors of the sinking of the French ship ''[[French frigate Méduse (1810)|Méduse]]'' in 1816 resorted to cannibalism after four days adrift on a raft and their plight was made famous by [[Théodore Géricault]]'s painting [[Raft of the Medusa]]. After the sinking of the ''[[Essex (whaleship)|Essex]]'' of [[Nantucket]] by a whale, on November 20, 1820, (an important source event for [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'') the survivors, in three small boats, resorted, by common consent, to cannibalism in order for some to survive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A671492 |title=The Wreck of the Whaleship Essex |publisher=BBC |accessdate=August 30, 2009}}</ref>  Sir [[John Franklin]]'s lost polar expedition is another example of cannibalism out of desperation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Keenleyside |first=Anne |title=The final days of the Franklin expedition: new skeletal evidence Arctic 50(1) 36-36 1997 |url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic50-1-36.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=January 26, 2008}}</ref> On land, the [[Donner Party]] found itself stranded by snow in [[Donner Pass|a high mountain pass]] in California without adequate supplies during the [[Mexican-American War]], leading to several instances of cannibalism.<ref name="Johnson, Kristin 1996">Johnson, Kristin (ed.)(1996).

The case of ''[[R v. Dudley and Stephens]]'' (1884) 14 QBD 273 (QB) is an English case which dealt with four crew members of an English yacht, the ''Mignonette'', who were cast away in a storm some {{convert|1600|mi|km}} from the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. After several days, one of the crew, a seventeen-year-old cabin boy, fell unconscious due to a combination of the famine and drinking seawater. The others (one possibly objecting) decided then to kill him and eat him. They were picked up four days later. Two of the three survivors were found guilty of murder. A significant outcome of this case was that [[necessity]] was determined to be no defence against a charge of murder.

American consul [[James W. Davidson]] described in his 1903 book, ''The Island of Formosa'', how the Chinese in Taiwan ate and traded in the flesh of [[Taiwanese aboriginals]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Davidson | first = James Wheeler | title = The Island of Formosa, Past and Present | publisher = Macmillan & Co. | year = 1903 | page = 255 | url = | isbn = }}</ref>

[[Roger Casement]], writing to a consular colleague in Lisbon on August 3, 1903 from Lake Mantumba in the Congo Free State, said: "The people round here are all cannibals. You never saw such a weird looking lot in your life. There are also dwarfs (called Batwas) in the forest who are even worse cannibals than the taller human environment. They eat man flesh raw! It's a fact." Casement then added how assailants would "bring down a dwarf on the way home, for the marital cooking pot&nbsp;... The Dwarfs, as I say, dispense with cooking pots and eat and drink their human prey fresh cut on the battlefield while the blood is still warm and running. These are not fairy tales my dear Cowper but actual gruesome reality in the heart of this poor, benighted savage land."<ref>National Library of Ireland, MS 36,201/3</ref>

===Modern era===

==== World War II ====

Many instances of cannibalism by necessity were recorded during World War II. For example, during the 872-day [[Siege of Leningrad]], reports of cannibalism began to appear in the winter of 1941–1942, after all birds, rats and pets were eaten by survivors. Leningrad police even formed a special division to combat cannibalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://it.stlawu.edu/~rkreuzer/pcavallerano/leningradweb.htm |title=900-Day Siege of Leningrad |publisher=It.stlawu.edu |accessdate=August 30, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?id=7014&action=tdihArticleCategory |title=This Day in History 1941: Siege of Leningrad begins |publisher=History.com |accessdate=August 30, 2009}}</ref> Following the Soviet victory at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] it was found that some German soldiers in the besieged city, cut off from supplies, resorted to cannibalism.<ref>{{Cite book

Later, following the German surrender in January 1943, roughly 100,000 German soldiers were taken [[prisoner of war]] (POW). Almost all of them were sent to POW camps in [[Siberia]] or Central Asia where, due to being chronically underfed by their Soviet captors, many resorted to cannibalism. Fewer than 5,000 of the prisoners taken at Stalingrad survived captivity. The majority, however, died early in their imprisonment due to exposure or sickness brought on by conditions in the surrounded army before the surrender.<ref>Beevor, Antony. ''Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege.'' Penguin Books, 1999.</ref>

The Australian War Crimes Section of the [[Tokyo tribunal]], led by prosecutor [[William Webb (judge)|William Webb]] (the future Judge-in-Chief), collected numerous written reports and testimonies that documented Japanese soldiers' acts of cannibalism among their own troops, on enemy dead, and on Allied prisoners of war in many parts of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. In September 1942, Japanese daily rations on New Guinea consisted of 800&nbsp;grams of rice and tinned meat. However, by December, this had fallen to 50&nbsp;grams.<ref name="happell">{{Cite book|last=Happell|first=Charles|title=The Bone Man of Kokoda|year=2008| publisher=Macmillan| location=Sydney| isbn=978-1-4050-3836-2}}</ref>{{rp|78–80}} According to historian Yuki Tanaka, "cannibalism was often a systematic activity conducted by whole squads and under the command of officers".<ref>Tanaka, Yuki. ''Hidden horrors: Japanese War Crimes in World War II'', Westview Press, 1996, p.127.</ref>

In some cases, flesh was cut from living people. An Indian POW, [[Lance Naik]] Hatam Ali (later a citizen of Pakistan), testified that in New Guinea: "the Japanese started selecting prisoners and every day one prisoner was taken out and killed and eaten by the soldiers. I personally saw this happen and about 100 prisoners were eaten at this place by the Japanese. The remainder of us were taken to another spot {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=off}} away where 10 prisoners died of sickness. At this place, the Japanese again started selecting prisoners to eat. Those selected were taken to a hut where their flesh was cut from their bodies while they were alive and they were thrown into a ditch where they later died."<ref>[[Lord Russell of Liverpool]] (Edward Russell), ''The Knights of Bushido, a short history of Japanese War Crimes'', Greenhill Books, 2002, p.121</ref>

Another well-documented case occurred in [[Chichijima]] in February 1945, when Japanese soldiers killed and consumed five American airmen. This case was investigated in 1947 in a war crimes trial, and of 30 Japanese soldiers prosecuted, five (Maj. Matoba, Gen. Tachibana, Adm. Mori, Capt. Yoshii, and Dr. Teraki) were found guilty and hanged.<ref>{{Cite journal| format = PDF | url = http://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/welch_naval_MCs.pdf | title = Without a Hangman, Without a Rope: Navy War Crimes Trials After World War II | chapter = Cannibalism | last = Welch | first = JM | journal = International Journal of Naval History | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | month = April | year = 2002 | accessdate =December 3, 2007 | ref = harv}}</ref>  In his book ''[[Flyboys: A True Story of Courage]]'', [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] details several instances of cannibalism of World War II Allied prisoners by their Japanese captors.<ref name=Bradley>{{Cite book

In April 1892, 10,000 of the Batetela, under the command of [[Gongo Lutete]], joined forces with Dhanis in a campaign against the [[Swahili people|Swahili]]-[[Arab]] leaders Sefu and Mohara.<ref name="Pakenham, 439"/>  After one early skirmish in the campaign, Hinde "noticed that the bodies of both the killed and wounded had vanished."

In the 1980s, [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], the international medical charity, supplied photographic and other documentary evidence of ritualized cannibal feasts among the participants in [[Liberia]]'s internecine strife to representatives of [[Amnesty International]] who were on a fact-finding mission to the neighboring state of [[Guinea]]. However, Amnesty International declined to publicize this material; the Secretary-General of the organization, [[Pierre Sane]], said at the time in an internal communication that "what they do with the bodies after human rights violations are committed is not part of our mandate or concern".

Cannibalism has been reported in several recent African conflicts, including the [[Second Congo War]], and the civil wars in [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. A UN human rights expert reported in July 2007 that sexual atrocities against Congolese women go "far beyond rape" and include [[sexual slavery]], forced [[incest]], and cannibalism.<ref name="farbeyond">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/30/AR2007073001849.html Congo's Sexual Violence Goes 'Far Beyond Rape'], July 31, 2007.

In West Africa, the [[Leopard Society]] was a secret society active into the mid-1900s and one that practiced cannibalism. Centred in [[Sierra Leone]], Liberia and [[Côte d'Ivoire]], the ''[[Leopard men]]'' would dress in [[leopard]] skins, waylaying travelers with sharp claw-like weapons in the form of leopards' claws and teeth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unexplainedstuff.com/Secret-Societies/The-Leopard-Men.html |title=The Leopard Men |publisher=Unexplainedstuff.com |date=January 10, 1948 |accessdate=August 30, 2009}}</ref> The victims' flesh would be cut from their bodies and distributed to members of the society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberiapastandpresent.org/RitualKillings1900_1950b.htm|title=The Leopard Society&nbsp;— Africa in the mid 1900s|accessdate=April 3, 2008}}</ref>

As in some other Papuan societies, the [[Urapmin people]] engaged in cannibalism in war. Notably, the Urapmin also had a system of [[food taboo]] wherein dogs could not be eaten and had to be kept from breathing on food, unlike humans who could be eaten and with whom food could be shared.<ref>{{cite book

[[File:Cannibalism during Russian famine 1921.jpg|thumb|160px|Cannibalism during the [[Russian famine of 1921]].]]
During the 1930s, multiple acts of cannibalism were reported from [[Ukraine]] and Russia's Volga, South Siberian and Kuban regions during the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3229000.stm|title=Ukraine marks great famine anniversary|date=November 22, 2003|accessdate=July 27, 2007 |work=BBC News | first=Yaroslav | last=Lukov}}</ref>

<blockquote>Survival was a moral as well as a physical struggle. A woman doctor wrote to a friend in June 1933 that she had not yet become a cannibal, but was "not sure that I shall not be one by the time my letter reaches you." The good people died first. Those who refused to steal or to prostitute themselves died. Those who gave food to others died. Those who refused to eat corpses died. Those who refused to kill their fellow man died.&nbsp;... At least 2,505 people were sentenced for cannibalism in the years 1932 and 1933 in Ukraine, though the actual number of cases was certainly much higher.<ref>Timothy Snyder.

Prior to 1931, ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[William Buehler Seabrook]], allegedly in the interests of research, obtained from a hospital intern at the [[Sorbonne (building)|Sorbonne]] a chunk of human meat from the body of a healthy human killed in an accident, then cooked and ate it. He reported, "It was like good, fully developed [[veal]], not young, but not yet beef. It was very definitely like that, and it was not like any other meat I had ever tasted. It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal. It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible. The roast, from which I cut and ate a central slice, was tender, and in color, texture, smell as well as taste, strengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know, veal is the one meat to which this meat is accurately comparable."<ref>William Bueller Seabrook.

In his book, ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'', Soviet writer [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] described cases of cannibalism in 20th-century [[USSR]]. Of the [[Russian famine of 1921|famine in Povolzhie]] (1921–1922) he wrote: "That horrible famine was up to cannibalism, up to consuming children by their own parents&nbsp;— the famine, which Russia had never known even in [[Time of Troubles]] [in 1601–1603]&nbsp;..."<ref>A. Solzhenitsyn, ''The Gulag Archipelago'' Part I, Chapter 9</ref>

He said of the [[Siege of Leningrad]] (1941–1944): "Those who consumed human flesh, or dealt with the human liver trading from dissecting rooms&nbsp;... were accounted as the political criminals&nbsp;..."<ref>A. Solzhenitsyn, ''The Gulag Archipelago'', Part I, comments to Chapter 5</ref> And of the building of Northern Railway Prisoners Camp ("SevZhelDorLag") Solzhenitsyn reports, "An ordinary hard working political prisoner almost could not survive at that penal camp. In the camp SevZhelDorLag (chief: colonel Klyuchkin) in 1946–47 there were many cases of cannibalism: they cut human bodies, cooked and ate."<ref>A.Solzhenitsyn ''The Gulag Archipelago'', Part III, Chapter 15</ref>

The Soviet journalist [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]] was a former long-term political prisoner who spent time in the Soviet prisons, [[Gulag]] camps and settlements from 1938 to 1955. She described in her memoir, ''Harsh Route'' (or ''Steep Route''), of a case which she was directly involved in during the late 1940s, after she had been moved to the prisoners' hospital.<ref>Yevgenia Ginzburg, ''Harsh Route'', Part 2, Chapter 23 "The Paradise On A Microscope View"</ref>
<blockquote>...The chief warder shows me the black smoked pot, filled with some food: 'I need your medical expertise regarding this meat.' I look into the pot, and hardly hold vomiting. The fibres of that meat are very small, and don't resemble me anything I have seen before. The skin on some pieces bristles with black hair (...) A former smith from Poltava, Kulesh worked together with Centurashvili. At this time, Centurashvili was only one month away from being discharged from the camp (...) And suddenly he surprisingly disappeared. The wardens looked around the hills, stated Kulesh's evidence, that last time Kulesh had seen his workmate near the fireplace, Kulesh went out to work and Centurashvili left to warm himself more; but when Kulesh returned to the fireplace, Centurashvili had vanished; who knows, maybe he got frozen somewhere in snow, he was a weak guy (...) The wardens searched for two more days, and then assumed that it was an escape case, though they wondered why, since his imprisonment period was almost over (...) The crime was there. Approaching the fireplace, Kulesh killed Centurashvili with an axe, burned his clothes, then dismembered him and hid the pieces in snow, in different places, putting specific marks on each burial place. ... Just yesterday, one body part was found under two crossed logs.</blockquote>

When [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]] crashed into the [[Andes]] on October 13, 1972, the survivors resorted to eating the deceased during their 72 days in the mountains. Their story was later recounted in the books ''[[Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors]]'' and ''[[Miracle in the Andes: 72 Days on the Mountain and My Long Trek Home|Miracle in the Andes]]'' as well as the film ''[[Alive (1993 film)|Alive]]'', by [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], and the documentaries ''[[Alive: 20 Years Later]]'' (1993) and ''[[Stranded: I've Come from a Plane that Crashed in the Mountains]]'' (2008).

Cannibalism was reported by the journalist [[Neil Davis (cameraman)|Neil Davis]] during the South East Asian wars of the 1960s and 1970s. Davis reported that [[Cambodia]]n troops ritually ate portions of the slain enemy, typically the [[liver]]. However he, and many refugees, also report that cannibalism was practiced non-ritually when there was no food to be found. This usually occurred when towns and villages were under [[Khmer Rouge]] control, and food was strictly rationed, leading to widespread starvation. Any civilian caught participating in cannibalism would have been immediately executed.

On July 23, 1988, [[Rick Gibson]] ate the flesh of another person in public. Because England does not have a specific law against cannibalism, he legally ate a [[canapé]] of donated human [[tonsils]] in Walthamstow High Street, London.<ref>{{citation | title = Hard to stomach, but Rick eats human parts | newspaper= Waltham Forest Guardian | pages= 6 | location= London, United Kingdom | date= 29 July 1988 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Young | first = Andrew | title = Rick eats his mate's tonsils on a cracker! | newspaper= The Sun | pages= 3 | location= Plymouth, United Kingdom | date= 4 August 1988 }}</ref> A year later, on April 15, 1989, he publicly ate a slice of human testicle in Lewisham High Street, London.<ref>{{citation | last = White | first = Kim | title = Now Rick's really gone nuts! | newspaper= Guardian & Gazette Newspapers | pages= 8 | location= London, United Kingdom | date= 14 April 1989 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | title = Rick's food for thought | newspaper= The Mercury | pages= 5 | location= London, United Kingdom | date= 20 April 1989 }}</ref> When he tried to eat another slice of human testicle at the Pitt International Galleries in Vancouver on July 14, 1989, the Vancouver police confiscated the testicle [[hors d'œuvre]].<ref>{{citation | last = Stueck | first = Wendy | title = Would-be cannibal's appetizer confiscated | newspaper= Vancouver Sun | pages= A7 | location= Vancouver, Canada | date= 15 July 1989 }}</ref> However, the charge of publicly exhibiting a disgusting object was dropped and he finally ate the piece of human testicle on the steps of the Vancouver court house on September 22, 1989.<ref>{{citation | title = No charges laid over artist's testicle claim | newspaper= Vancouver Sun | pages= B1 | location= Vancouver, Canada | date= 22 August 1988 }}</ref>
