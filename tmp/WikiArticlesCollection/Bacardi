Bacardi Limited is headquartered in [[Hamilton, Bermuda]] and has a 16-member board of directors led by the original founder's great-great grandson, Facundo L. Bacardí.

==Early history==
[[Facundo Bacardí|Facundo Bacardí Massó]], a [[Catalan people|Catalan]] wine merchant, was born in [[Sitges]], Catalonia, Spain in 1814, and emigrated to [[Cuba]] in 1830. During this period, rum was cheaply made and not considered a refined drink, one rarely sold in upscale taverns. Don Facundo began attempting to "tame" rum by isolating a proprietary strain of yeast still used in Bacardi production today.  This yeast gives Bacardi rum its unique flavor profile. After experimenting with several techniques he hit upon filtering the rum through charcoal, which removed impurities. In addition to this, Facundo aged the rum in white oak barrels, which had the effect "of mellowing" the drink. The final product was the first clear, or "white" rum in the world.

Moving from the experimental stage to a more commercial endeavor, he and his brother José set up shop in a [[Santiago de Cuba]] distillery they bought in 1862; that distillery housed a [[still]] made of copper and [[cast iron]]. In the rafters of this building lived [[Leaf-nosed bat|fruit bats]]&nbsp;– the inspiration for the Bacardi bat logo.<ref>[http://www.bacardilimited.com/our-heritage/the-early-years Our heritage: the early years] from the company's corporate website</ref>

The 1880s and 90s were turbulent times for Cuba and the company. [[Emilio Bacardí]], Don Facundo's eldest son, was repeatedly imprisoned and was exiled from Cuba for having fought in the rebel army against Spain in the [[Cuban War of Independence]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gjelten|first=Tom|title=Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba|publisher=Viking|location=New York|year=2008|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EeTwCWqOmcUC&printsec=frontcover|author-link=Tom Gjelten|isbn = 9780670019786.}}</ref>

Emilio's brothers, Facundo and José, and his brother-in-law Henri (Don Enrique) Schueg, remained in Cuba with the difficult task of sustaining the company during a period of war. The women in the family were exiled in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. After the [[Cuban War of Independence]] and the US occupation of Cuba, "The Original [[Cuba Libre]]" and the [[Daiquiri]] were both born with Bacardi rum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strawberry-daiquiri-recipe.com/strawberry-daiquiri-invention.php|title=Daiquiri}}</ref> In 1899 US General [[Leonard Wood]] appointed Emilio Bacardí Mayor of [[Santiago de Cuba]].
[[File:Bacardi Building.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Bacardi Building (Havana)|Bacardi Building in Havana, Cuba]]]]

In 1912 Emilio Bacardí travelled to [[Egypt]] where he purchased a mummy (still on display) for the future Emilio Bacardí Moreau Municipal Museum in Santiago de Cuba.<ref name=Coulombe>{{cite book|publisher=Citadel Press|title=Rum|author=Charles A. Coulombe}}</ref> In Santiago, his brother Facundo M. Bacardí continued to manage the company along with Schueg, who began the company's international expansion by opening new bottling plants in [[Barcelona]] (1910) and New York City (1915).<ref>[http://www.bacardilimited.com/our-heritage/the-early-years#havana_beyond Bacardi Limited: Our Heritage – Havana and Beyond.] Retrieved 10 May 2011.</ref> The New York plant was soon shut down due to [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], yet during this time Cuba became a hotspot for US tourists.

In 1922 Emilio opened a new distillery in Santiago. In 1930 Schueg opened the [[art deco]] [[Bacardi Building (Havana)|Bacardi building in Havana]] and the third generation of the Bacardí family was entering the business. Facundito Bacardí was known to have invited Americans (still subject to Prohibition) to "Come to Cuba and bathe in Bacardi rum."<ref name=Coulombe /> A new product was introduced: [[Hatuey beer]].
[[File:PR BacardiCathedralOfRum.jpg|thumb|The "Cathedral of Rum" at the Bacardi distillery in [[Cataño, Puerto Rico|Cataño]], [[Puerto Rico]], near [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]].]]

Bacardi's transition into an international brand was due mostly to Schueg's "business genius"; Schueg "branded Cuba as the home of rum, and Bacardi as the king of rums" and expanded overseas, first to Mexico (1931), then to Puerto Rico (1936), under the brand name Ron Bacardi. (Ron is the Spanish word for rum). Post-Prohibition production in Puerto Rico enabled rum to be sold tariff-free in the US after Prohibition.<ref name="washpost">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/21/AR2008082102222.html Rum and Revolution] an August 2008 review of ''Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba'' (ISBN 978-0-670-01978-6) from ''The Washington Post''</ref> He then expanded to the United States (1944).<ref name="bacardilimited.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.bacardilimited.com/our-heritage/the-early-years#prohibition_innovaction|title=Bacardi Limited: Our Heritage – Prohibition and Innovation|publisher=Bacardi|date=|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref> 

During the World War II years the company was led by Schueg's son-in-law José "Pepin" Bosch. Pepin founded Bacardi Imports in New York City, and was named Cuba's Minister of the Treasury in 1949.

==Cuban Revolution==
Portuondo and other Bacardí family members initially supported the [[Cuban Revolution|Cuban revolutionaries]], including [[Fidel Castro]] and the broader [[26th of July Movement|M-26-7 movement]]: Bosch personally donated tens of thousands of dollars to the movement, and acted as an intermediary between the revolutionaries and the CIA to assuage the latter's concerns.<ref name="washpost"/> Family members, employees, and facilities were put to use by the movement and the company supported the revolution publicly with advertisements and parties.<ref name="washpost"/> But their support turned to opposition as the pro-Soviet [[Che Guevara]] wing{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} of the movement began to dominate and as Castro turned against their interests.

The Bacardí family (and hence the company) maintained a fierce [[opposition to Fidel Castro|opposition to Fidel Castro's]] revolution in Cuba in the 1960s. In his book, ''Bacardi, The Hidden War'' (ISBN 978-0745318738), [[Hernando Calvo Ospina]] outlines the political element to the family's money. Ospina describes how the Bacardi family and Company left Cuba after the Castro regime confiscated the Company’s Cuban assets on 15 October 1960; in particular, in nationalizing and banning all private property on the island as well as all bank accounts. However, due to concerns over the previous Cuban leader [[Fulgencio Batista]] the company had started foreign branches a few years prior to the revolution; the Company moved the ownership of the Company's trademarks, assets and proprietary formulas out of the country to the Bahamas prior to the revolution as well as constructing plants in [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Mexico]] after the prohibition era to save in import taxes for rum being imported to the US. This helped the company survive after the communist government confiscated without compensation all Bacardi assets in the country.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bacardi: The Hidden War|author=Hernando Calvo Ospina|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2002}}</ref>

Ospina also explains the close ties Bacardí family members had to the US political elite as well as organizations of state such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. The family funded various [[Cuban exile]] organizations such as [[CANF]].

More recently, Bacardi lawyers were influential in the drafting of the 1996 [[Helms-Burton Act]] which sought to extend the scope of the [[United States embargo against Cuba]].<ref>[http://library.thinkquest.org/18355/the_helms-burton_act.html The Helms-Burton Act] from thinkquest.org</ref> In 1999 [[Otto Reich]], a lobbyist in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] on behalf of Bacardi, drafted section 211 of the [[Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Appropriations Act, FY1999]] ({{USPL|105|277}}), a bill that became known as the Bacardi Act. Section 211 denied trademark protection to Cuban businesses products expropriated after the Cuban revolution, a provision keenly sought by Bacardi. The act was aimed primarily at the [[Havana Club]] brand in the US. The brand was created by the José Arechabala company and confiscated without compensation in the Cuban revolution. The Havana Club trademark had been registered by the Cuban government in the United States without permission of the rightful owners.<ref>Ann Louise Bardach: Cuba Confidential. Penguin books 2002. p.131</ref> The new law invalidated the trademark registration. Section 211 has been challenged unsuccessfully by the Cuban government and the European Union in US courts; however, the act has been ruled illegal by the [[WTO]] (August 2001). The US Congress has yet to re-examine the matter.

==Bacardi and Cuba today==
Bacardi drinks are not found in Cuba today. The main brand of rum in Cuba is [[Havana Club]], the company that was confiscated and nationalized by the government during the revolution. Bacardi later bought the brand from the original owners, the Arechabala family. The Cuban government, in partnership with French company [[Pernod Ricard]], sells its Havana Club products internationally, except for the United States and its territories. Bacardi created Havana Club rum based on the original recipe from the Arechabala family, manufactures it in Puerto Rico, and sells it in [[Florida]]. Bacardi continues to fight a war in the courts attempting to legalize their own [[Havana Club (Bacardi)|Havana Club]] trademark outside of the United States.<ref>[http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news03.php?nt_id=55761&ct_id=1 Caribbean Business: Bacardi wins round in Havana Club fight] Retrieved 30 May 2011.</ref> Drinks now made in the former Cuban Bacardi distillery are sold in Cuba under the name Caney.

Despite having no production facilities in Cuba today, Bacardi in the UK has recently decided to re-emphasize its Cuban heritage, primarily for commercial reasons. Facing increased competition in the rum market from the now international brand Havana Club, the company concluded that it was important for sales to associate its rum with Cuba. TV advertisements with slogans of 'Welcome to the Latin Quarter' are but one example of this. In 1998, under the distinctive bat logo, the phrase "company founded in Santiago de Cuba in 1862" was added.

Bacardi has faced criticism and legal problems for supposedly attempting to falsely convince consumers they were purchasing rum made in Cuba rather than just marking its heritage. Bacardi adverts in Spain, since 1966, had described a popular combination of rum and Coke as "rum and coke". However, after 1998, it began to describe the drink as [[Cuba Libre]]&nbsp;– literally translated as "Free Cuba", which is the original name of the drink and how it is mostly called in Latin America. In this instance, Bacardi faced a legal ruling from the Spanish Association of Advertising Users which forced the company to stop the advert. They concluded that it could "''mislead the viewer as to the true nature of the product''" as the advert contained so many pieces of Caribbean imagery, one might conclude it came from Cuba.<ref>Ospina p.&nbsp;79</ref>{{Clarify|date=January 2013|reason=Who is the Spanish Association of Advertising Users, and how do they have the power of law? Bacardi manufacturers in PR, which is in the Caribbean also, just 500 mi south of Cuba.}}

The Bacardi legacy lives on in Santiago and Havana through its grand buildings and its historic significance. The [[Bacardi Building (Havana)|Bacardi Building]] in [[Old Havana]] is regarded as one of the finest [[art deco]] buildings in Latin America.<ref>[http://www.ecured.cu/index.php/Edificio_Bacard%C3%AD_(Ciudad_de_la_Habana) "Edificio Bacardí (Ciudad de la Habana)", ''EcuRed''] (Cuban state-filtered wiki)</ref>

==Brands==
Bacardi Limited has made several acquisitions to diversify away from the eponymous Bacardi rum brand. In 1993 Bacardi merged with [[Martini & Rossi S.p.A.]], the Italian producer of [[Martini (vermouth)|Martini vermouth]] and sparkling wines, creating the Bacardi-Martini group. In 1998 the company acquired [[Dewar's scotch]], including [[Royal Brackla]] and [[Bombay Sapphire]] gin from [[Diageo]] for $2&nbsp;billion. Bacardi acquired the Cazadores blue agave tequila brand in 2002 and in 2004 purchased [[Grey Goose (vodka)|Grey Goose]], a French made [[vodka]], from [[Sidney Frank]] for $2&nbsp;billion. In 2006 Bacardi Limited purchased New Zealand vodka brand [[42 Below]]. Other associated brands include the [[Havana Club (Bacardi)|US version of Havana Club]], [[Drambuie]] Scotch whisky liqueur, DiSaronno [[Amaretto]], [[Eristoff]] vodka, [[Duo and trio cocktails#B and B|B&B]] and [[Bénédictine]] liqueurs.

Bacardi is one of only two liquor brands to feature the [[Mexican free-tailed bat]] as its icon or logo, the other brand being Freetail Brewing company, out of San Antonio, TX.

==Awards==
In its 150 year history, Bacardi rum has more than 550 awards for quality and product profile, making it the world’s most awarded rum. Emblems of gold medals and the Spanish Coat of Arms awarded during the formative years of the business appear on every bottle of Bacardi Rum. 

Despite the fact that many of Bacardi's offerings are aimed at the lower and middle part of the price spectrum, Bacardi rums have been entered in a number of international [[spirit ratings]] competitions. Several Bacardi spirits have performed notably well. Bacardi 8, for example, received two gold medals and a silver medal from the [[San Francisco World Spirits Competition]] between 2008 and 2010. In addition, it received the International High Quality Trophy at [[Monde Selection]]'s World Quality Selections in 2010, and a Grand Gold Medal in 2011. Bacardi Gold, Bacardi 8, and Bacardi Reserva Limitada were also awarded International High Quality Trophy awards at the 2010 Monde Selection’s World Quality Selections.<ref>{{cite web|title=The International High Quality Trophy - 2010, Spirits & Liqueurs Selection|url=http://www.monde-selection.com/en/7.4.4.1_AL_Selection_Results_2010.asp|publisher=Monde Selection|accessdate=23 April 2012}}</ref>

==Hemingway connection==
[[Ernest Hemingway]] lived in Cuba from 1939 until shortly after the Cuban revolution. He lived at [[Finca Vigía]], in the small town of San Francisco de Paula, located very close to Bacardi’s [[Modelo Brewery]] for Hatuey Beer in [[Cotorro, Havana]]. 

In 1954, Compañía Ron Bacardi S.A. threw Hemingway a party when he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] – soon after the publication of his novel [[The Old Man and the Sea]] (1952) – in which he honored the company by mentioning its Hatuey beer. Hemingway also mentioned Bacardi and Hatuey in his novels [[To Have and Have Not]] (1937) and [[For Whom the Bell Tolls]] (1940). [[Guillermo Cabrera Infante]] wrote an account of the festivities for the periodical Ciclón, titled ''El Viejo y la marca'' (''The Old Man and the Brand''). In his account he described how "on one side there was a wooden stage with two streamers&nbsp;– Hatuey beer and Bacardi rum&nbsp;– on each end and a Cuban flag in the middle. Next to the stage was a bar, at which people crowded, ordering daiquiris and beer, all free.”<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cabrera Infante|first=Guillermo|title=El viejo y la marca|journal=Ciclón|year=1956}}</ref> A sign at the event read "Bacardi rum welcomes the author of ''The Old Man and the Sea''".

In his article ''The Old Man and the Daiquiri'', Wayne Curtis writes about how Hemingway’s "home bar also held a bottle of Bacardi rum." Hemingway wrote in ''Islands in the Stream'' "...this frozen daiquirí, so well beaten as it is, looks like the sea where the wave falls away from the bow of a ship when she is doing thirty knots."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Wayne|title=The Old Man and the Daiquiri|journal=The Atlantic|year=2005|month=October|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/10/the-old-man-and-the-daiquiri/4257/2/?single_page=true}}</ref>

==Chalk's Ocean Airways Flight 101==
On 19 December 2005 [[Chalk's Ocean Airways Flight 101]] from [[Fort Lauderdale]], Florida to [[Bimini]], [[Bahamas]], with an unscheduled stop at [[Watson Island]], [[Miami]], Florida, crashed off [[Miami Beach]], Florida. Sergio Danguillecourt, a member of the board of directors of Bacardi Ltd and a great-great-grandson of the rum company's founder Don Facundo Bacardí i Massó, and his wife Jacqueline Kriz Danguillecourt were on board. There were no survivors.

==United States headquarters==
{{Main|Bacardi Building (Miami)}}
[[File:Bacardi building Miami.jpg|thumb|right|The Bacardi building in [[Midtown Miami]] on [[Biscayne Boulevard]] served as the USA headquarters of Bacardi.]]

In 1964 Bacardi opened its new US headquarters in Miami, Florida. Cuban-exiled architect Enrique Gutierrez created a building that was hurricane-proof, using a system of steel cables and pulleys which allow the building to move slightly in the event of a strong shock. The steel cables are anchored into the bedrock and extend through marble-covered shafts up to the top floor, where they are led over large pulleys. Outside, on both sides of the eight-story building, more than 28,000 tiles painted and fired by Brazilian artist Francisco Brennard, depicting abstract blue flowers, were placed on the walls according to the artist's exact specifications.

In 1972, the Company commissioned the square building in the plaza. Architect Ignacio Carrera-Justiz used cantilevered construction, a style invented by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Wright observed how well trees with taproots withstood hurricane force winds. The building, raised 47 feet off the ground around a central core, features four massive walls, made of sections of inch-thick hammered glass mural tapestries, designed and manufactured in France. The design came from a painting by German artist Johannes M. Dietz. 

In 2006, Bacardi USA leased a 15-story headquarters complex in [[Coral Gables, Florida]]. Bacardi had employees in seven buildings across [[Miami-Dade County]] at the time.<ref name="Bacardi">"[http://southflorida.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2007/05/07/daily8.html# Bacardi USA to take over BK's planned Coral Gables headquarters]." ''[[South Florida Business Journal]]''. Tuesday 8 May 2007. Retrieved on 2 October 2009.</ref>

Bacardi vacated its former headquarter buildings on [[Biscayne Boulevard]] in [[Midtown Miami]]. Miami citizens began a campaign to label the buildings as "historic". [[University of Miami]] professor of architecture Allan Schulman said "Miami's brand is it's{{sic}} identity as a tropical city. The Bacardi buildings are exactly the sort that resonate with our consciousness of what Miami is about".<ref>"[http://www.nydailynews.com/latino/2009/04/08/2009-04-08_miami_weighs_preserving_iconic_bacardi_b.html Miami weighs preserving iconic Bacardi buildings]."
