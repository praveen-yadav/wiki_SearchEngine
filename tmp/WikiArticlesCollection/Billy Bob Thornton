In the mid-1980s, Thornton settled in Los Angeles, to pursue his career as an actor, with future writing partner Tom Epperson.<ref name="actors" /> Thornton initially had a difficult time succeeding as an actor, and worked in [[telemarketing]], [[offshore construction|offshore]] [[wind farm]]ing,<ref name="driving" /> and [[fast food]] management between auditioning for acting jobs. He also played drums and sang with South African rock band Jack Hammer. While Thornton worked as a waiter for an industry event, he served film director and screenwriter [[Billy Wilder]], who is famous for films such as ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''. Thornton struck up a conversation with Wilder, who advised Thornton to consider a career as a screenwriter.<ref name="actors" />

== Career ==

===Film===
Billy Bob's first screen role was in 1980s ''South of Reno'', where he played a small role as a counter man in a restaurant. Billy Bob also made an appearance in a 1987 episode of Andy Griffith's popular show ''Matlock'' titled "The Photographer" as a pawn store clerk.
Another one of Thornton's early screen roles was as a cast member on the CBS sitcom ''[[Hearts Afire]]'' with [[John Ritter]] and [[Markie Post]]. His role as the villain in 1992's ''[[One False Move]]'', which he also co-wrote, brought him to the attention of critics.<ref name="actors" /> He also had small roles in the early 1990s films ''[[Indecent Proposal]]'', ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'', ''[[Bound by Honor]]'', ''Grey Knight'', and ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]''. Thornton put Wilder's advice to good use, and went on to write, direct and star in the [[independent film]] ''[[Sling Blade]]'', which was released in 1996.<ref name="actors" /> The film, an expansion of a short film titled ''[[Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade]]'', introduced the story of Karl Childers, a mentally handicapped man imprisoned for a gruesome and seemingly inexplicable murder. ''Sling Blade'' garnered international acclaim.<ref name="actors" /> Thornton's screenplay earned him an [[Academy Award]] for Best Adapted Screenplay, a [[Writers Guild of America Award]], and an [[Edgar Award]], while his performance received Oscar and [[Screen Actors Guild]] nominations for Best Actor.<ref name="actors" />

In 1998, he portrayed the [[James Carville|James-Carville]]-like Richard Jemmons in ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]''. Thornton adapted the book ''[[All the Pretty Horses (novel)|All the Pretty Horses]]'' into a 2000 [[All the Pretty Horses (film)|film with the same name]], starring [[Matt Damon]] and [[Penélope Cruz]]. The negative experience (he was forced to cut more than an hour) led to his decision to never direct another film (a subsequent release, ''[[Daddy and Them]]'', had been filmed earlier). Also in 2000, an early script which he and Tom Epperson wrote together was made into ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]'' which starred [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Hilary Swank]], [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Katie Holmes]], [[Greg Kinnear]], and [[Giovanni Ribisi]]. In 2000, he also appeared in [[Travis Tritt]]'s music video for the song "[[Modern Day Bonnie and Clyde]]".

Thornton has stated that, following ''Bad Santa'''s success, audiences "like to watch [him] play that kind of guy,"<ref name="jamshowbiz" /> and "they [casting directors] call [him] up when they need an asshole. It's kinda that simple... you know how narrow the imagination in this business can be."<ref name="dailynews">{{cite web |work=Daily News |title=School is in session |url=http://www.dailynews.com/entertainment/ci_4386629 |accessdate=September 24, 2006}}</ref> In 2004 he played [[David Crockett]] in ''[[The Alamo (2004 film)|The Alamo]]''.
