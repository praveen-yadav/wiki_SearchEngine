{{Agriculture}}

'''Agriculture''', also called '''farming''' or '''husbandry''', is the cultivation of [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]], and other life forms for [[food]], [[fiber]], [[biofuel]], [[drug]]s and other products used to sustain and enhance human life.<ref name="Office1999">{{cite book |author= |title=Safety and health in agriculture |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GtBa6XIW_aQC&pg=PA77 |year=1999 |publisher=International Labour Organization |isbn=978-92-2-111517-5 |pages=77– |accessdate=13 September 2010}}</ref> Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of [[domestication|domesticated]] species created food [[economic surplus|surpluses]] that nurtured the development of [[civilization]]. The study of agriculture is known as [[agricultural science]]. The [[history of agriculture]] dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different [[climate]]s, cultures, and technologies. However, all farming generally relies on techniques to expand and maintain the lands that are suitable for raising domesticated species. For plants, this usually requires some form of [[irrigation]], although there are methods of [[dryland farming]]. [[Livestock]] are raised in a combination of grassland-based and landless systems, in an industry that covers almost one-third of the world's ice- and water-free area. In the developed world, [[industrial agriculture]] based on large-scale [[monoculture]] has become the dominant system of modern farming, although there is growing support for [[sustainable agriculture]], including [[permaculture]] and [[organic farming|organic agriculture]].

Until the [[Industrial Revolution]], the vast majority of the human population labored in agriculture. Pre-industrial agriculture was typically [[subsistence agriculture]]/ [[Self-sufficiency]] in which farmers raised most of their crops for their own consumption instead of [[cash crop]]s for trade. A remarkable shift in agricultural practices has occurred over the past century in response to new technologies, and the development of world markets. This also has led to technological improvements in agricultural techniques, such as the [[Haber-Bosch]] method for synthesizing [[ammonium nitrate]] which made the traditional practice of recycling [[nutrient]]s with [[crop rotation]] and animal [[manure]] less important.

Modern [[agronomy]], [[plant breeding]], [[agrochemical]]s such as [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizers]], and technological improvements have sharply increased yields from cultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and negative human health effects. [[Selective breeding]] and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about [[animal welfare]] and the health effects of the [[antibiotics]], [[growth hormones]], and other chemicals commonly used in industrial meat production. [[Genetically Modified Organisms]] are an increasing component of agriculture today, although they are banned in several countries. Agricultural food production and water management are targeted as an increasingly global issue that is fostering debate on a number of issues. Significant degradation of land and water resources, including the depletion of [[aquifer]]s, has been observed in recent decades, and the effects of global warming on agriculture and of agriculture on global warming are still not fully understood.

The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, [[fuel]]s, and [[raw material]]s. Specific foods include [[cereal]]s (grains), [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[cooking oil|oils]], [[meat]] and [[spice]]s. Fibers include [[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], [[silk]] and [[flax]]. Raw materials include [[lumber]] and [[bamboo]]. Other useful materials are produced by plants, such as [[resin]]s, [[natural dye|dyes]], [[drug]]s, [[perfume]], [[biofuel]]s and ornamental products such as [[Floriculture|cut flowers]] and [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery plants]]. Over one third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the services sector, although the percentages of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the past several centuries.

==Etymology and terminology==

The word ''agriculture'' is a late [[Middle English]] adaptation of Latin ''agricultūra'', from ''ager'', "field", and ''cultūra'', "[[Tillage|cultivation]]" or "growing".<ref>{{cite book|page=14|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Word Histories|editor=Chantrell, Glynnis|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-863121-9}}</ref> Agriculture usually refers to human activities, although it is also observed in certain species of [[ant]], [[termite]] and [[ambrosia beetle]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626|title=The Evolution of Agriculture in Insects|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=36|pages=563–595|date=December 2005|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626|author=Ulrich G.

Agricultural practices such as [[irrigation]], [[crop rotation]], [[fertilizers]], [[pesticides]] and the [[domestication]] of livestock were developed long ago, but have made great progress in the past century. The [[history of agriculture]] has played a major role in [[history of the world|human history]], as agricultural progress has been a crucial factor in worldwide [[social change|socio-economic change]]. [[Division of labour]] in agricultural societies made commonplace specializations rarely seen in [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures, which allowed the growth of towns and cities, and the complex societies we call [[civilization]]s.  When farmers became capable of producing food beyond the needs of their own families, others in their society were freed to devote themselves to projects other than food acquisition. Historians and anthropologists have long argued that the development of agriculture made civilization possible. The total [[world population]] probably never exceeded 15 million inhabitants before the development of agriculture.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tellier, Luc-Normand|year=2009|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&pg=&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false|title=Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective|publisher=PUQ|page=26|isbn=2-7605-1588-5}}</ref> According to [[Jared Diamond]], the costs of agriculture were: "the average daily number of work hours increased, nutrition deteriorated, infectious disease and body wear increased, and lifespan shortened."<ref>{{cite book|title=The World Until Yesterday|author=Jared Diamond|page=353|isbn=978-0-670-02481-0|publisher=Viking|year=2012}}</ref>

=== Prehistoric origins ===
[[Forest gardening]], a plant-based food production system, is thought to be the world's oldest [[agroecosystem]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forest Farms of Kandy: And Other Gardens of Complete Design|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=2003|page=1|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QYBSfUJPQXcC&lpg=PP1&dq=the%20forest%20farms%20of%20kandy%20and%20other%20gardens%20of%20complete%20design&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=978-0-7546-0958-2}}</ref> Forest gardens originated in [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of [[monsoon]] regions.

{{Further|Neolithic Revolution}}
[[File:Trilla del trigo en el Antiguo Egipto.jpg|thumb|Threshing of grain in ancient Egypt]]
The [[Fertile Crescent]] of the [[West Asia]] first saw the domestication of animals, starting the Neolithic Revolution. Between 10,000 and 13,000 years ago, the ancestors of modern cattle, sheep, goats and pigs were domesticated in this area. The gradual transition from wild harvesting to deliberate cultivation happened independently in several areas around the globe.<ref name=NatGeo/> Agriculture allowed for the support of an increased population, leading to larger societies and eventually the development of cities. It also created the need for greater organization of political power (and the creation of [[social stratification]]), as decisions had to be made regarding labor and harvest allocation and access rights to water and land. Agriculture bred immobility, as populations settled down for long periods of time, which led to the accumulation of material goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/neolithic/Neo3-LivRev.html|title= Living the Revolution|author=DK Jordan|date=24 November 2012|work=The Neolithic|publisher=University of California – San Diego|accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>

Early [[Neolithic]] villages show evidence of the ability to process grain, and the Near East is the ancient home of the ancestors of [[wheat]], [[barley]] and [[pea]]s. There is evidence of the cultivation of [[Common fig|fig]]s in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] as long as 11,300 years ago, and [[cereal]] (grain) production in Syria approximately 9,000 years ago. During the same period, farmers in China began to farm [[rice]] and [[millet]], using man-made floods and fires as part of their cultivation regimen.<ref name=NatGeo>{{cite web|url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/|title=The Development of Agriculture|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>

[[Squash (plant)|Squash]] was grown in Mexico nearly 10,000 years ago, while [[maize]]-like plants, derived from the wild [[teosinte]], began to be seen at around 9,000 years ago. The derivation of teosinte into modern corn was slow, however, and it took until 5,500<ref name=NatGeo/> to 6,000 years ago to turn into what we know today as maize. It then gradually spread across North America and was the major crop of Native Americans at the time of European exploration.<ref>{{cite book|editor=S. Johannessen and C. A.

Agriculture advanced to Europe slightly later, reaching the northeast of the continent from the east around 4000 BC. The idea that agriculture spread to Europe, rather than independently developing there, has led to two main hypotheses. The first is a "wave of advance", which holds that agriculture traveled slowly and steadily across the continent, while the second, "population pulse" theory, holds that it moved in jumps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/neolithic/Neo1-AgRev.html|title= The "Agricultural Revolution"|author=DK Jordan|date=24 November 2012|work=The Neolithic|publisher=University of California – San Diego|accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref> Also around 6000 years ago, horses first began to be domesticated in the Eurasian [[steppe]]s.

===Bronze and Iron Ages===
Between 2500 and 2000 BC, the simplest form of the [[plough]], called the [[ard (plough)|ard]], spread throughout Europe, replacing the [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]. This change in equipment significantly increased cultivation ability, and affected the demand for land, as well as ideas about property, inheritance and family rights.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cHRvtwTLcMAC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=ard+plough+3500+BC#v=onepage&q=ard%20plough%203500%20BC&f=false|page=28|title=Cambridge Economic History of Europe: Vol. 2: Trade and Industry in the Middle Ages|editor=Michael Moïssey Postan, H.

These tools would have also been easier to transport, which was a benefit as people only stayed until the soil's nutrients were depleted. However, as the continuous cultivating of smaller pieces of land became a sustaining practice throughout the world, ards were much more efficient than digging sticks.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Seventy Great Inventions of the Ancient World|author=Brian M.

In the ancient world, fresh products, such as meats, dairy products and fresh fruits and vegetables, were likely consumed relatively close to where they were produced. Less perishable products, such as grains, preserved foods, olive oil and wine, were often traded over an extensive network of land and sea routes. The ancient trade in agricultural goods was well established, with wine traded in the Mediterranean region in the 6th century BC and Rome receiving extensive shipments of grain as tax payments by the 2nd century BC. Huge amounts of grain were transported, mainly by sea, and it was during this period that the subsidization of grain farming began, for the prevention of famine. Ancient Rome was a major center for agricultural trade. Trade routes stretched from Britain and Scandinavia in the west to India and China in the east, and included major crops, such as grain, wine and olive oil (also a fuel for [[oil lamp]]s), as well as additional products, including spices, fabrics and drugs.<ref>{{cite book|pages=194–196|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|url=http://books.google.com/?id=9JJdqJ8YGH8C&pg=PA195&lpg=PA195&dq=ancient+grain+trade#v=onepage&q=ancient%20grain%20trade&f=false|author=Lesley Adkins, Roy A.

In [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], many scholars documented farming techniques, including the use of fertilizers.<ref name=FertMan>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qPkoOU4BvEsC&pg=PA44&dq=history+of+fertilizer#v=onepage&q=history%20of%20fertilizer&f=false|page=46|author=UN Industrial Development Organization, International Fertilizer Development Center|title=The Fertilizer Manual|publisher=Springer|year=1998|edition=3rd|isbn=0792350324}}</ref> Much of what was believed about farming and plant nutrition at this time was later found to be incorrect, but their theories provided the scientific foundation for the development of agricultural theories through the [[Middle Ages]]. Ideas about soil fertility and fertilization remained much the same from the time of Greco-Roman scholars until the 19th century, with correspondingly low crop yields.<ref name=FertMan/> By the time of [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests (330–323 BC), the role of horses had developed, and they played a huge role in warfare and agriculture. Innovations continued to be developed which allowed them to work longer, harder and more efficiently. By medieval times they became the primary source of power for agriculture, transport and warfare, a position they held until the development of the [[steam engine|steam]] and [[internal combustion]] engines.<ref name=Horse/> The [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] culture developed several innovations in agriculture during its peak, which ranged from 400 BC to 900 AD and was heavily dependent upon agriculture to support its population. The Mayans used extensive canal and raised field systems to farm the large portions of swampland on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101105/full/news.2010.587.html|title=Mayans converted wetlands to farmland|author=Mascarelli, Amanda|journal=Nature|date=5 November 2010|doi=10.1038/news.2010.587}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.soils.org/publications/sh/articles/53/6/3|title=Invisible Artifacts: Uncovering Secrets of Ancient Maya Agriculture with Modern Soil Science|journal=Soil Horizons|author=Morgan, John|date=6 November 2013|doi=10.2136/sh2012-53-6-lf|volume=53|issue=6|pages=3}}</ref>

===Middle Ages===
European agriculture underwent a number of significant changes during the Middle Ages. Tools including the scythe and plow were improved from classical versions, a [[three field system]] of crop rotation was invented, and the [[moldboard plow]] and wheeled plow were increasingly used. [[Draft horse]]s were bred and increasingly used as a [[working animal]] in many parts of Europe, while [[oxen]] continued to be used for this purpose. Metal horseshoes were widely adopted. Much of Europe had low population densities during this period, to which [[extensive farming]] was well-suited. In parts of Southern Europe, more intensive farming combined techniques continued from classical Roman agriculture and those transferred from Islamic regions. In the late Middle Ages, the use of [[manure]] as fertilizer increased, which in turn decreased the necessity of regular fallowing of fields.

===Columbian exchange===
The history of agriculture in the [[Age of Discovery]] and [[Early modern era]] was closely tied to the processes of European exploration and colonization. After 1492 the world's agricultural patterns were shuffled in the widespread exchange of plants and animals known as the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Crops and animals that were previously only known in the Old World were now transplanted to the New and vice versa. Perhaps most notably, the [[tomato]] became a favorite in European cuisine, and [[maize]] and [[potato]]es were widely adopted. Other transplanted crops include [[pineapple]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], and [[tobacco]]. In the other direction, several wheat strains quickly took to western hemisphere soils and became a dietary staple even for native North, Central and South Americans. Agriculture was a key element in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], [[triangular trade]], and the expansion by European powers into the Americas. In the expanding [[plantation economy]], large plantations producing crops including sugar, cotton, and [[indigo dye|indigo]], were heavily dependent upon [[slave labor]].

===Modern era===
{{Main|British Agricultural Revolution}}
{{See also|List of agricultural machinery|Industrial agriculture|Mechanized agriculture}}
Use of primitive agricultural techniques was the historical standard. The vast majority of the world population engaged in [[subsistence agriculture]] and yields remained low. Between the 16th century and the mid-19th century, [[Great Britain]] saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and net output, changes that subsequently affected agriculture around the world. New agricultural practices like [[enclosure]], [[mechanization]], [[four-field crop rotation]] and [[selective breeding]] enabled an unprecedented population growth, freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce, and thereby helped drive the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/handle/2381/1407|title=Zooarchaeology, improvement and the British agricultural revolution|author=Thomas, Richard M.|journal=International Journal of Historical Archaeology|date= June 2005|volume=9|issue=2|pages=71–88}}</ref> By the early 19th century, agricultural practices, particularly careful selection of hardy strains and cultivars, had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the Middle Ages and before. It is estimated that the productivity of wheat went up from about 19 bushels per acre in 1720 to 21–22 bushels by the middle of the century and finally stabilised at around 30 bushels by 1840.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snell|first=K.D.M|title=Annals of the Labouring Poor, Social Change and Agrarian England 1660–1900|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Presslocation=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-24548-6}} Chapter 4</ref>

The Agricultural Revolution was a major turning point in history. The population of England in 1750 reached the level of 5.7 million, just as it had done in the past in around 1350 and again in 1650. This time, instead of a [[Malthusian catastrophe]] occurring from plague or famine, the population growth [[Malthusian trap|remained sustained]].

[[File:Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt (2).jpg|thumb|left|200x200px|[[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles 'Turnip' Townshend]], agriculturalist who introduced four-filed [[crop rotation]] and the cultivation of turnips.]]
One of the keys to the British Agricultural Revolution was the development of ways of keeping and improving the arable land in Great Britain to counteract the loss of the [[soil]]'s [[plant nutrition|plant nutrients]] in cropping a given area. Higher yielding land was added to higher yielding crops with more yield/acre. Farm workers using more productive tools and machinery produced more crops with fewer workers. The Agricultural Revolution picked up speed as the Industrial Revolution and the advances in chemistry produced the scientific knowledge, wealth and technology for a more systematic development of commercial fertilizers and new and more productive agricultural machinery.

Advice on more productive techniques for farming began to appear in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as [[Samuel Hartlib]], [[Walter Blith]] and others.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Thirsk|first=Joan|title='Blith, Walter (bap. 1605, d. 1654)'|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008| url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2655|accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places [[crop rotation]] was used. A four-field rotation was popularised by the [[United Kingdom|British]] agriculturist [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]] in the 18th century. The system ([[wheat]], [[turnip]]s, [[barley]] and [[clover]]), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing [[livestock]] to be bred year-round. The use of turnip was especially important as the legume roots were an important source of nutrients for the soil.

Another catalyst for improvement came from the [[Enclosure movement]]. Prior to the 18th century, agriculture across [[Europe]] used the [[feudal]] [[open field system]] with subsistence farmers cropping strips of land in fields held in common and splitting up the produce; this was very inefficient and reduced incentive to improve the productivity. Many farms began to be enclosed by [[Yeomen]] who improved the use of their land. This process accelerated in the 15th and 16th centuries with special acts of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to expedite the legal process. This culminated in the [[Enclosure Act|General Enclosure Act]] of 1801, which sanctioned large-scale [[land reform]].

[[File:ShireDraftHorse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shire horse|Shires]] [[selective breeding|selectively bred]] for size, in the 18th century.]]
The mechanisation and rationalisation of agriculture was another important factor. [[Robert Bakewell (farmer)|Robert Bakewell]] and [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester of Holkham|Thomas Coke]] introduced [[selective breeding]], and initiated a process of inbreeding to maximise desirable traits from the mid 18th century, such as the [[New Leicester]] sheep.

Machines were invented to improve the efficiency of various agricultural operation, such as [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]]'s [[seed drill]] of 1701 that mechanised seeding at the correct depth and spacing and [[Andrew Meikle]]'s [[threshing machine]] of 1784. Ploughs were steadily improved, from Joseph Foljambe's [[Plough#Heavy Ploughs|Rotherham iron plough]] in 1730<ref>[http://www.rotherhamweb.co.uk/h/plough.htm The Rotherham Plough]</ref> to [[James Small (inventor)|James Small]]'s improved "Scots Plough" metal in 1763. In 1789 [[Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies]] was producing 86 plough models for different soils.<ref>Barlow, Robert Stockes; "300 Years of Farm Implements and Machinery 1630–1930"; Krause Publications (2003); p.33; ISBN 978-0873496322</ref> [[Tractor|Traction machine]]s also began to replace [[horsepower]] on the farms in the 19th century.

The scientific investigation of fertilization began at the [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] in 1843 by [[John Bennet Lawes]]. He investigated the impact of inorganic and organic fertilizers on crop yield and founded one of the first artificial fertilizer manufacturing factories in 1842. Fertilizer, in the shape of [[sodium nitrate]] deposits in [[Chile]], was imported to Britain by [[John Thomas North]] as well as [[guano]] (birds droppings). The first commercial process for fertilizer production was the obtaining of ''[[super phosphate|phosphate]]'' from the dissolution of [[coprolite]]s in [[sulphuric acid]].<ref>Coprolite Fertilizer Industry in Britain [http://www.pdmhs.com/PDFs/ScannedBulletinArticles/Bulletin%2014-5%20-%20The%20Origins%20and%20Development%20of%20the%20British%20.pdf] Accessed 3 Apr 2012</ref>

The repeal of the [[Corn Law]]s in 1846 that removed [[tariff]]s on food imports, and the development of [[steamship]]s and [[railway]]s, which revolutionised the transportation of food, allowed a truly global market for food to emerge. This reduced volatility in food prices as scarcity in one area could be offset by cheap imports from another area.

The work of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Gregor Mendel]] created the scientific foundation for plant breeding that led to its explosive impact over the past 150 years.<ref name="Kingsbury">{{cite book|author=Noel Kingsbury|year=2009|title=Hybrid: The History and Science of Plant Breeding|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}</ref> Firms, such as [[Gartons Agricultural Plant Breeders]] began to market hybrid crops in the 1890s.

===20th century===
[[File:Agriculture (Plowing) CNE-v1-p58-H.jpg|thumb|Early 20th century image of a [[tractor]] ploughing an [[alfalfa]] field.]]
[[Dan Albone]] constructed the first commercially successful gasoline-powered general purpose tractor in 1901, and the 1923 [[International Harvester]] [[Farmall]] tractor marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with machines. Since that time, self-propelled mechanical harvesters ([[combine harvester|combines]]), planters, transplanters and other equipment have been developed, further revolutionizing agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/hort_306/text/lec32.pdf|title=Agricultural Scientific Revolution: Mechanical|author=Janick, Jules|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=2013-05-24}}</ref> These inventions allowed farming tasks to be done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/52548/52645.aspx|title=The Impact of Mechanization on Agriculture|journal=The Bridge on Agriculture and Information Technology|date=Fall 2011|volume=41|number=3|author=Reid, John F.}}</ref>

The [[Haber process|Haber-Bosch method]] for synthesizing [[ammonium nitrate]] represented a major breakthrough and allowed [[crop yields]] to overcome previous constraints. It was first patented by German chemist [[Fritz Haber]]. In 1910 [[Carl Bosch]], while working for German chemical company [[BASF]], successfully commercialized the process and secured further patents. In the years after [[World War II]], the use of synthetic fertilizer increased rapidly, in sync with the increasing world population. [[Norman Borlaug]] and other scientists began developing crops for increased yields in the 1940s in Mexico. Their work lead to the [[Green Revolution]], which applied western advances in fertilizer and pesticide use to farms worldwide, with varying success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/HomePage/SUSTAINABILITY/Climate-change/A-historical-perspective.html|title=A Historical Perspective|publisher=International Fertilizer Industry Association|accessdate=2013-05-07}}</ref>

In the past century agriculture has been characterized by increased productivity, the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor, [[water pollution]], and [[farm subsidies]]. In recent years there has been a backlash against the [[externalities|external]] environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the [[organic movement]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2013/04/history-nitrogen-fertilizer-ammonium-nitrate|author=Philpott, Tom|title=A Brief History of Our Deadly Addiction to Nitrogen Fertilizer|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=2013-05-07|publisher=Mother Jones}}</ref> Famines continued to sweep the globe through the 20th century. Through the effects of climactic events, government policy, war and crop failure, millions of people died in each of at least ten famines between the 1920s and the 1990s.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/ten-worst-famines-of-the-20th-century-20110815-1iu2w.html|title=Ten worst famines of the 20th century|journal=Sydney Morning Herald|date=15 August 2011}}</ref>

Other applications of scientific research since 1950 in agriculture include [[gene manipulation]], [[Hydroponics]], and the development of economically viable [[biofuel]]s such as [[Ethanol fuel|Ethanol]].

In the past century agriculture has been characterized by enhanced [[productivity]], the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, [[selective breeding]], mechanization, [[water contamination]], and [[farm subsidies]]. Proponents of [[organic farming]] such as [[Sir Albert Howard]] argued in the early 20th century that the overuse of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers damages the long-term fertility of the soil. While this feeling lay dormant for decades, as [[environmental awareness]] has increased in the 21st century there has been a movement towards [[sustainable agriculture]] by some farmers, consumers, and policymakers.

Since the 1990s, there has been a backlash against perceived [[externalities|external]] environmental effects of mainstream agriculture, particularly regarding water pollution,<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The World Bank|year=1995|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&theSitePK=469372&piPK=64165421&menuPK=64166093&entityID=000009265_3970311122936|title=Overcoming agricultural pollution of water : the challenge of integrating agricultural and environmental policies in the European Union, Volume 1|accessdate=2013-04-15|author=Scheierling, Susanne M.}}</ref> resulting in the organic movement. One of the major forces behind this movement has been the [[European Union]], which first certified [[organic food]] in 1991 and began reform of its [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) in 2005 to phase out commodity-linked farm subsidies,<ref>{{cite web|publisher=European Commission|year=2003|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/capreform/index_en.htm|title=CAP Reform|accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref> also known as [[Decouple#Economics|decoupling]]. The growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as [[integrated pest management]] and selective breeding. Recent mainstream technological developments include [[genetically modified food]].

In late 2007, several factors pushed up the price of grains consumed by humans as well as used to feed poultry and dairy cows and other cattle, causing higher prices of wheat (up 58%), soybean (up 32%), and maize (up 11%) over the year. Contributing factors included  increased demand for grain-fed animal products from the growing middle classes of countries such as China and India and the diversion of food grain to biofuel production.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/06/business/06tyson.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/W/Wheat |title=At Tyson and Kraft, Grain Costs Limit Profit|date=6 September 2007 |agency=Bloomberg |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=213343|title=Forget oil, the new global crisis is food |last=McMullen |first=Alia

==Workforce==

As of 2011, the [[International Labour Organization]] states that approximately one billion people, or over 1/3 of the available work force, are employed in the global agricultural sector. Agriculture constitutes approximately 70 percent of the global employment of children, and in many countries employs the largest percentage of women of any industry.<ref name=ILO/>  The [[service sector]] only overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in 2007. Between 1997 and 2007, the percentage of people employed in agriculture fell by over four percentage points, a trend that is expected to continue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/story/191279|title=Services sector overtakes farming as world's biggest employer: ILO|author=AP|date=26 January 2007|accessdate=2013-04-24|publisher=The Financial Express}}</ref> The number of people employed in agriculture varies widely on a per-country basis, ranging from less than 2 percent in countries like the US and Canada to over 80 percent in many African nations.<ref name=LaborForce>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2048.html|title=Labor Force – By Occupation|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|work=The World Factbook|accessdate=2013-05-04}}</ref> In developed countries, these figures are significantly lower than in previous centuries. During the 16th century in Europe, for example, between 55 and 75 percent of the population was engaged in agriculture, depending on the country. By the 19th century in Europe, this had dropped to between 35 and 65 percent.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://economics.ouls.ox.ac.uk/13621/1/uuid9ef3c3c6-512f-44b6-b74e-53266cc42ae2-ATTACHMENT01.pdf|format=PDF|title=Economic structure and agricultural productivity in Europe, 1300–1800|journal=European Review of Economic History|volume=3|pages=1–25|author=Allen, Robert C.}}</ref> In the same countries today, the figure is less than 10 percent.<ref name=LaborForce/>

=== Safety ===
[[Image:Ford Tractor with ROPS bar fitted.JPG|right|thumb|[[Rollover protection system|Rollover protection bar]] on a [[Fordson tractor|Fordson]] tractor.]]

Agriculture remains a hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. On [[industrial agriculture|industrialized farms]], injuries frequently involve the use of [[agricultural machinery]], and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers.<ref name="aginjury">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aginjury/ |title=NIOSH Workplace Safety & Health Topic: Agricultural Injuries|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref> Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illnesses or birth defects.<ref name=NIOSH_pest>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-108/ |title=NIOSH Pesticide Poisoning Monitoring Program Protects Farmworkers|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref> As an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself, entire families can be at risk for injuries, illness, and death.<ref name="NIOSH Agri">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/agriculture/ |title=NIOSH Workplace Safety & Health Topic: Agriculture|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref> Common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning, machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents.<ref name="NIOSH Agri" />

== Agricultural production systems ==

=== Crop cultivation systems ===
[[File:Paddy fields in India.jpg|thumb|Rice cultivation at a paddy field in [[Bihar]] state of India]]
[[File:Rice terraces.png|thumb|The [[Banaue Rice Terraces]] in [[Ifugao]], Philippines.]]
Cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and climate of the farm; government policy; economic, social and political pressures; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.<ref name="FAO FS">{{cite web|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|url=http://www.fao.org/farmingsystems/description_en.htm|title=Analysis of farming systems|accessdate=2013-05-22}}</ref><ref name="PCP APS">Acquaah, G. 2002. Agricultural Production Systems. pp. 283–317 in "Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology". Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.</ref>

[[Shifting cultivation]] (or [[slash and burn]]) is a system in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then [[perennial plant|perennial]] crops for a period of several years.<ref name="CS">Chrispeels, M.J.; Sadava, D.E. 1994. "Farming Systems: Development, Productivity, and Sustainability". pp. 25–57 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''. Jones and Bartlett, Boston, MA.</ref> Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or [[manure]]) and some manual [[pest control]]. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.

Further industrialization lead to the use of [[monoculture]]s, when one [[cultivar]] is planted on a large acreage. Because of the low [[biodiversity]], nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of [[pesticide]]s and fertilizers.<ref name="PCP APS"/> Multiple cropping, in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and [[intercropping]], when several crops are grown at the same time are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as [[polyculture]]s.<ref name="CS" />

In [[subtropics|subtropical]] and [[arid]] environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring [[irrigation]]. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as [[agroforestry]]. In [[Temperateness|temperate]] environments, where ecosystems were predominantly [[grassland]] or [[prairie]], highly productive annual cropping is the dominant farming system.<ref name="CS"/>

=== Livestock production systems ===
{{Main|Livestock}}
{{See also|List of domesticated animals}}

[[File:KerbauJawa.jpg|thumb|right|Ploughing rice paddies with [[water buffalo]], in Indonesia.]]
Animals, including horses, [[mule]]s, [[ox]]en, [[water buffalo]], [[camel]]s, [[llama]]s, [[alpaca]]s, [[donkey]]s, and dogs, are often used to help [[Tillage|cultivate]] fields, [[harvest]] crops, wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers. [[Animal husbandry]] not only refers to the breeding and raising of animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like milk, [[egg (food)|eggs]], or [[wool]]) on a continual basis, but also to the breeding and care of species for work and companionship.
Livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as [[grassland]]-based, mixed, and landless.<ref name="FAO lps">{{cite web|author=Sere, C.; Steinfeld, H.; Groeneweld, J.|year=1995|url=http://www.fao.org/WAIRDOCS/LEAD/X6101E/x6101e00.htm#Contents|title=Description of Systems in World Livestock Systems – Current status issues and trends|publisher=U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref> As of 2010, 30 percent of Earth's ice- and water-free area was used for producing livestock, with the sector employing approximately 1.3 billion people. Between the 1960s and the 2000s, there was a significant increase in livestock production, both by numbers and by carcass weight, especially among beef, pigs and chickens, the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10. Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, also showed significant production increases. Global cattle, sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050.<ref name=LP>{{cite journal|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2853.full|title=Livestock production: recent trends, future prospects|author=Thornton, Philip K.|doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0134|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|date=27 September 2010|volume=365|number= 1554}}</ref> [[Aquaculture]] or fish farming, the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations, is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production, growing at an average of 9 percent a year between 1975 and 2007.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1663604,00.html|title=Fish Farming's Growing Dangers|journal=Time|author=Stier, Ken|date=September 19, 2007}}</ref>

During the second half of the 20th century, producers using [[selective breeding]] focused on creating livestock [[breed]]s and [[crossbreed]]s that increased production, while mostly disregarding the need to preserve [[genetic diversity]]. This trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02036.x/full|title=A global view of livestock biodiversity and conservation – GLOBALDIV|author=P.

Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as [[shrubland]], [[rangeland]], and [[managed intensive rotational grazing|pastures]] for feeding [[ruminant]] animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30–40 million pastoralists.<ref name="CS"/> Mixed production systems use grassland, [[fodder]] crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastic (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.<ref name="FAO lps"/>

Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in [[OECD]] member countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution.<ref name="FAO lps"/> Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75 percent of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in [[confined animal feeding operations]], sometimes called [[factory farming]]. Much of this growth is happening in developing countries in Asia, with much smaller amounts of growth in Africa.<ref name=LP/> Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of [[growth hormone]]s, are controversial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-02-604_en.pdf |title=Growth Promoting Hormones Pose Health Risk to Consumers, Confirms EU Scientific Committee|date=23 April 2002|accessdate=2013-04-06|publisher=European Union}}</ref>

== Production practices ==
[[File:Mt Uluguru and Sisal plantations.jpg|thumb|300px|Road leading across the farm allows machinery access to the farm for production practices.]]
[[Tillage]] is the practice of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to [[no-till farming|no-till]]. It may improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO<sub>2</sub>, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.<ref name="Soil">Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils. Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.</ref><ref name="PCP Tillage">Acquaah, G. 2002. "Land Preparation and Farm Energy" pp.318–338 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.</ref>

[[Pest control]] includes the management of weeds, [[insect|insects/mites]], and diseases. Chemical ([[pesticide]]s), biological ([[biocontrol]]), mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include [[crop rotation]], [[culling]], [[cover crop]]s, [[intercropping]], [[composting]], avoidance, and [[Disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|resistance]]. [[Integrated pest management]] attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.<ref name="PCP Pest">Acquaah, G. 2002. "Pesticide Use in U.S. Crop Production" pp.240–282 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.</ref>

[[Nutrient management]] includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of utilization of [[manure]] produced by livestock. Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, [[manure]], [[green manure]], [[compost]] and mined [[minerals]].<ref name="PCP Soil">Acquaah, G. 2002.

== Crop alteration and biotechnology ==
{{Main|Plant breeding}}
[[File:Ueberladewagen (jha).jpg|thumb|[[Tractor]] and [[Chaser bin]]]]

Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist [[Gregor Mendel]]. His work on [[dominant allele|dominant]] and [[recessive allele]]s, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, [[self-pollination]] and [[cross-pollination]], and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/history.html |title=History of Plant Breeding|date=29 January 2004|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=2013-05-11}}</ref>

Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved [[disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|disease resistance]] and [[drought tolerance]], eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in [[New Zealand]]. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Stadler |first= L.

The [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] to increase yield many folds by creating "high-yielding varieties". For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical [[pest control]], growth control to avoid lodging).<ref>{{cite journal |last= Ruttan |first= Vernon W. |title= Biotechnology and Agriculture: A Skeptical Perspective |journal= AgBioForum |volume= 2 |issue= 1 |pages= 54–60 |month= December |year= 1999 |url= http://www.agbioforum.org/v2n1/v2n1a10-ruttan.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last= Cassman |first= K.

[[Genetically Modified Organism]]s (GMO) are [[organism]]s whose [[Genetics|genetic]] material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as [[recombinant DNA technology]]. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/index.html|title=20 Questions on Genetically Modified Foods|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref> For some, GMO crops cause [[food safety]] and [[food labeling regulations|food labeling]] concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import and/or use of GMO foods and crops, which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues, declining agricultural diversity and contamination of non-GMO crops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://current.com/groups/news-blog/93975745_peru-bans-genetically-modified-foods-as-us-lags.htm|title=Peru bans genetically modified foods as US lags|date=28 November 2012|publisher=Current TV|accessdate=2013-05-07|author=Whiteside, Stephanie}}</ref> Currently a global treaty, the [[Biosafety Protocol]], regulates the trade of GMOs.

Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including [[glyphosate]]s. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5031e/y5031e0i.htm|title=Benefits and risks of the use of herbicide-resistant crops|author=Kathrine Hauge Madsen and Jens Carl Streibig|publisher=FAO|accessdate=2013-05-04|work=Weed Management for Developing Countries}}</ref> With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays.

Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops protect plants from damage by insects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aces.uiuc.edu/vista/html_pubs/biotech/insect.htm|title=Insect-resistant Crops Through Genetic Engineering|publisher=University of Illinois|accessdate=2013-05-04}}</ref> Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species.

Agriculture imposes [[externalities|external costs]] upon society through pesticides, nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, loss of natural environment and assorted other problems. A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare.<ref name=Pretty2000>{{cite journal |last1= Pretty |year= 2000 |title= An assessment of the total external costs of UK agriculture |journal= Agricultural Systems |volume= 65 |issue= 2 |pages= 113–136 |doi= 10.1016/S0308-521X(00)00031-7|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X00000317 |first1= J |display-authors= 1 |last2= Brett |first2= C. |last3= Gee |first3= D. |last4= Hine |first4= R.E. |last5= Mason |first5= C.F. |last6= Morison |first6= J.I.L. |last7= Raven |first7= H. |last8= Rayment |first8= M.D. |last9= Van Der Bijl |first9= G.}}</ref> A 2005 analysis of these costs in the USA concluded that cropland imposes approximately $5 to 16 billion ($30 to $96 per hectare), while livestock production imposes $714 million.<ref name=Tegtmeier2005>{{cite journal |last1= Tegtmeier |first1= E.M. |last2= Duffy |first2= M. |year= 2005 |title= External Costs of Agricultural Production in the United States |journal= The Earthscan Reader in Sustainable Agriculture |url= http://www.organicvalley.coop/fileadmin/pdf/ag_costs_IJAS2004.pdf}}</ref> Both studies, which focused solely on the fiscal impacts, concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs.

[[Climate change]] has the potential to affect agriculture through changes in temperature, rainfall (timing and quantity), [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]], [[solar radiation]] and the interaction of these elements.<ref name="CS"/> Extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Harvey, Fiona|date=18 November 2011|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/18/extreme-weather-climate-change-ipcc|title=Extreme weather will strike as climate change takes hold, IPCC warns|journal=The Guardian}}</ref> Agriculture is among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; water supply for example, will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide the increase in food output required to sustain the world's growing population. Fluctuations in the flow of rivers are likely to increase in the twenty first century.

Agriculture can both mitigate or worsen [[global warming]]. Some of the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] comes from the [[decomposition]] of [[organic matter]] in the soil, and much of the methane emitted into the atmosphere is caused by the decomposition of organic matter in wet soils such as [[rice paddy|rice paddies]],<ref name="Soils OM">Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. "Soil Organic Matter" pp. 353–385 in ''Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils''.

Some major organisations are hailing farming within [[agroecosystems]] as the way forward for mainstream agriculture.

The report suggested assigning value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests. Inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for
more productive farmland, or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.<ref>{{cite web|author=Molden, D.|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/news_room/pdf/The-scientist_com-Opinion_The%20Water_Deficit.pdf |title=Opinion: The Water Deficit|format=PDF|publisher=The Scientist|accessdate=2011-08-23}}</ref>

Between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, several international agreements were put into place that limited agricultural tariffs, subsidies and other trade restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/8699/wps3901.pdf?sequence=1|title=Do Global Trade Distortions Still Harm Developing Country Farmers?|author=Kym Anderson and Ernesto Valenzuela|work=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3901|date=April 2006|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=2013-04-16|pages=1–2}}</ref>

However, as of 2009, there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the [[oilseed]]s, sesame had the greatest amount of taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4101/WPS4864.pdf?sequence=1|title=How Do Agricultural Policy Restrictions to Global Trade and Welfare Differ Across Commodities|author=Peter J.

== Energy and agriculture ==
Since the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides. The vast majority of this energy input comes from [[fossil fuel]] sources.<ref>"[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/world-oil-supplies-are-set-to-run-out-faster-than-expected-warn-scientists-453068.html World oil supplies are set to run out faster than expected, warn scientists]". ''The Independent''. 14 June 2007.</ref> Between the 1960–65 measuring cycle and the cycle from 1986 to 1990, the [[Green Revolution]] transformed agriculture around the globe, with world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat and 60% to 150% for rice, depending on geographic area)<ref>{{cite web|title=The Future of the Green Revolution: Implications for International Grain Markets|author=Robert W.

Modern or industrialized agriculture is dependent on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways: 1) direct consumption on the farm and 2) indirect consumption to manufacture inputs used on the farm. Direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery; and use of gasoline, liquid [[propane]], and electricity to power dryers, pumps, lights, heaters, and coolers. American farms directly consumed about 1.2 exajoules (1.1 quadrillion BTU) in 2002, or just over 1 percent of the nation's total energy.<ref name="ncseonline.org">{{cite web|author=Schnepf, Randy|date=19 November 2004|title=Energy use in Agriculture: Background and Issues|work=CRS Report for Congress|url=http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/RL32677.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|accessdate=2013-09-26}}</ref>

Indirect consumption is mainly oil and [[natural gas]] used to manufacture fertilizers and pesticides, which accounted for 0.6 exajoules (0.6 quadrillion BTU) in 2002.<ref name="ncseonline.org"/> The natural gas and coal consumed by the production of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] can account for over half of the agricultural energy usage. China utilizes mostly coal in the production of nitrogen fertilizer, while most of Europe uses large amounts of natural gas and small amounts of coal. According to a 2010 report published by [[The Royal Society]], agriculture is increasingly dependent on the direct and indirect input of fossil fuels. Overall, the fuels used in agriculture vary based on several factors, including crop, production system and location.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2991.full|title=Energy and the food system|author=Jeremy Woods, Adrian Williams, John K.

Together, direct and indirect consumption by US farms accounts for about 2 percent of the nation's energy use. Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S. farms peaked in 1979, and has gradually declined over the past 30 years.<ref name="ncseonline.org"/> [[Food systems]] encompass not just agricultural production, but also off-farm processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the US.<ref name="css.snre.umich.edu"/><ref name="ers.usda.gov"/>

=== Mitigation of effects of petroleum shortages ===

[[Image:Hubbert peak oil plot.svg|right|thumb|250px|[[M. King Hubbert]]'s prediction of world petroleum production rates.

In the event of a petroleum shortage (see [[peak oil]] for global concerns), organic agriculture can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum-based pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Some studies using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields as high as those available from conventional farming.<ref name=UMinnSustainable>{{cite web|url=http://www.misa.umn.edu/Search_and_Ask/FAQ/FeedtheWorld/index.htm|title=Can Sustainable Agriculture Really Feed the World?|date=August 2010|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref> In the aftermath of the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], with shortages of conventional petroleum-based inputs, Cuba made use of mostly organic practices, including [[biopesticides]], plant-based pesticides and sustainable cropping practices, to feed its populace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chge.med.harvard.edu/resource/cuban-organic-farming-experiment|title=Cuban Organic Farming Experiment|publisher=Harvard School of Public Health|accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref> However, organic farming may be more [[labour (economics)|labor]]-intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas.<ref>{{cite web|author=Strochlic, R.; Sierra, L.|year=2007|url=http://ccwiki.pbworks.com/f/CAStudy-Barriers-Organic-CIRS-2007.pdf|title= Conventional, Mixed, and "Deregistered" Organic Farmers: Entry Barriers and Reasons for Exiting Organic Production in California|publisher=California Institute for Rural Studies|accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref> The [[soil conditioner|reconditioning of soil]] to restore nutrients lost during the use of [[monoculture]] agriculture techniques also takes time.<ref name=UMinnSustainable/>

It has been suggested that rural communities might obtain fuel from the [[biochar]] and [[synfuel]] process, which uses agricultural ''waste'' to provide charcoal fertilizer, some fuel ''and'' food, instead of the normal [[food vs fuel]] debate. As the synfuel would be used on-site, the process would be more efficient and might just provide enough fuel for a new organic-agriculture fusion.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU05/11082/EGU05-J-11082-2.pdf|author=P.

== Policy ==
{{Main|Agricultural policy}}
[[Agricultural policy]] is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, [[food safety]] and natural disasters), [[economic stability]] (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and [[environmental sustainability]] (especially [[water resource management|water policy]]), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries).<ref>{{cite journal|page=13|title=Agricultural and food policy choices in Australia|journal=Sustainable agriculture and food policy in the 21st century: challenges and solutions|publisher=Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics – Bureau of Rural Sciences|date=October 2010|accessdate=2013-04-22|author=Lindsay Hogan and Paul Morris|url=http://adl.brs.gov.au/data/warehouse/pe_abarebrs99001749/CP10.15_Agric_food_policy_CONFERENCE_PAPER.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Agricultural policy can also touch on [[food quality]], ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, [[food security]], ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and [[Conservation biology|conservation]]. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/pol/agr/|title=Agriculture: Not Just Farming...|publisher=European Union|accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>

There are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy, including consumers, agribusiness, trade lobbies and other groups. [[Agribusiness]] interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making, in the form of [[lobbying]] and [[campaign contribution]]s. Political action groups, including those interested in environmental issues and [[labor union]]s, also provide influence, as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-Corporatization%20of%20Fm%20Pol%20%289-10%29.htm|title=Corporatization of Agricultural Policy|author=Ikerd, John|journal=Small Farm Today Magazine|year=2010}}</ref> The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. Dr. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's animal production and health division, states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/sep/22/food-firms-lobbying-samuel-jutzi |title=Corporate Lobbying Is Blocking Food Reforms, Senior UN Official Warns: Farming Summit Told of Delaying Tactics by Large Agribusiness and Food Producers on Decisions that Would Improve Human Health and the Environment |location=London |first=Juliette |last=Jowit |date= 22 September 2010 |newspaper= The Guardian}}</ref>
