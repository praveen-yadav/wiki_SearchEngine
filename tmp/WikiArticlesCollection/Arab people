The word "Arab" has had several different, but overlapping, meanings over the centuries (and sometimes even today). In addition to including all ethnically Arab and Arabized people of the world (with language tending to be the acid test), it has also at times been used exclusively for [[bedouin]] (Arab nomads [although a related word, "`a-RAB," with the Arabic letter "alif" in the second syllable, once was sometimes used when this specific meaning was intended] and their now almost entirely settled descendants). It is sometimes used that way colloquially even today in some places. Townspeople once were sometimes called "sons of the Arabs." As in the case of other ethnicities or nations, people identify themselves (or are identified by others) as "Arabs" to varying degrees. This may not be one's primary identity (it tends to compete with country, religion, sect, etc.), and whether it is emphasized may depend upon one's audience. If the diverse Arab pan-ethnicity is regarded as a single ethnic group, then it constitutes one of the world's largest after [[Han Chinese]].

==Etymology==
{{Further2|[[Arab (etymology)]]}}
The earliest documented use of the word "Arab" to refer to a [[people]] appears in the [[Monolith Inscription]], an [[Akkadian language]] record of the 9th century BC [[Assyrian Conquest of Syria]]. (Arabs had formed part of a coalition of forces opposed to Assyria.)<ref name=Retsop105>Jan Retsö [http://books.google.com/books?id=pUepRuQO8ZkC&pg=PA105 The Arabs in antiquity: their history from the Assyrians to the Umayyads], Routledge, 2003, ISBN 0-7007-1679-3, p. 105, 119, 125-127.</ref> Listed among the booty captured by the army of king [[Shalmaneser III]] of [[Assyria]] in the [[Battle of Qarqar]] are 1000 camels of "Gi-in-di-bu'u the ar-ba-a-a" or  "[the man] [[Gindibu]] belonging to the ''ʕarab''" (''ar-ba-a-a'' being an adjectival [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|nisba]] of the noun ''ʕarab'').<ref name=Retsop105/>

The most popular Arab account holds that the word 'Arab' came from an [[eponymous]] father called [[Yarab]], who was supposedly the first to speak Arabic. [[Abū Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdānī|Al-Hamdani]] had another view; he states that Arabs were called '''Gharab''' (West in Semitic) by [[Mesopotamians]] because Arabs resided to the west of Mesopotamia; the term was then corrupted into Arab. Yet another view is held by [[Al-Masudi]] that the word Arabs was initially applied to the [[Ishmaelites]] of the "Arabah" valley.

In Biblical etymology, "Arab" (in Hebrew ''Arvi'' {{he:ערבי}}) comes both from the desert origin of the people (''Arava'' means wilderness) and/or from the concept of mixed people. (''Arev-rav'' - a large group of mixed people.) The root ''a-r-b'' has several additional meanings in [[Semitic languages]]—including "west/sunset," "desert," "mingle," "merchant," and "raven"—and are "comprehensible" with all of these having varying degrees of relevance to the emergence of the name. It is also possible that some forms were [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathetical]] from {{transl|sem|ʿ-B-R}} "moving around" (Arabic {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ-B-R}} "traverse"), and hence, it is alleged, "nomadic."

==Identity==
Arab identity is defined independently of [[religion|religious]] identity, and pre-dates the rise of [[Islam]], with historically attested [[Arab Christian]] kingdoms and [[Jewish tribes of Arabia|Arab Jewish tribes]]. Today, however, most Arabs are Muslim, with a minority adhering to other faiths, largely [[Christianity in the Middle East|Christianity]]. Arabs are generally [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], [[Shia Islam|Shia]] or [[Sufi]] Muslims, but currently, 7.1 percent to 10 percent of Arabs are [[Arab Christians and Arabic-speaking Christians|Arab Christians]].<ref name=Pacini>{{Cite book|authorlink=Philippe Fargues |title=Christian Communities in the Middle East|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-19-829388-7 |editor= Andrea Pacini}}</ref> This figure does not include Christian ethnic groups such as [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], and [[Syriacs]].

The people of Arabia belong to two distinct and apparently quite different races. The common idea of Arab type -- tall, bearded men with clean-cut hawk like faces are found in North Arabia. The Arabs of South Arabia are smaller, darker, coarser featured, and nearly beardless. All authorities agree that the Southern Arabs are nearly related to the Abyssinians. Yet strange to say, it is the Egypto-African race ([[Qahtanite|Qahtani]]) who are the pure Arabs, while the stately Semitics of the north are Musta'rab ([[Adnanites|Adnani]]).... Arab by adoption, mixing and residence rather than by pure descent.<ref>Betram Thomas: Arabia Felix- Across the Empty Quarter 1932 p.23</ref> Although since early days other people became Arabs through an Arabization process that could mean intermarriage with Arabs, adopting the Arabic language and culture, or both. For example, the [[Ghassanids]] and the Lakhmids which originated from Southern Semitic speaking Yemen made a major contribution in the creation of the Arabic language. The same process happened all over the Arab world after the spread of Islam by the mixing of Arabs with several other peoples. The Arab cultures went through a mixing process. Therefore every Arab country has cultural specificities which constitute a cultural mix which also originate in local novelties achieved after the arabization took place. However, all Arab countries do also share a common culture in most Aspects: Arts (music, literature, poetry, calligraphy...), Cultural products (Handicrafts, carpets, henne, bronze carving...), Social behaviour and relations (Hospitality, codes of conduct among friends and family...), Customs and superstitions, Some dishes (Shorba, Mloukhia), Traditional clothing, Architecture...

[[File:Arabic Dialects.svg|thumb|An overview of the different [[Arabic dialects]]]]
Non-Arab Muslims, who are about 80 percent of the world's [[Muslim population]], do not form part of the [[Arab world]], but instead comprise what is the geographically larger, and more diverse, [[Muslim World]].

In the USA, Arabs have historically been [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|racially classified as white/Caucasian]]<ref>The Races of Europe by [[Carleton S. Coon|Carlton Stevens Coon]]. From Chapter XI: The Mediterranean World - Introduction: "This third racial zone stretches from Spain across the Straits of Gibraltar to Morocco, and thence along the southern Mediterranean shores into Arabia, East Africa, Mesopotamia, and the Persian highlands; and across Afghanistan into India."</ref><ref name=EncycloAmer>Grolier Incorporated, Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 6, (Grolier Incorporated, 2001), p.85</ref> and, since 1997, by the U.S. Census as well.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/population/race/about/ US Census, "About Race"]</ref><ref>[http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf US Census, "Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin 2010"]</ref>

[[Arabic]], the main unifying feature among Arabs, is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]] originating in [[Arabia]]. From there it spread to a variety of distinct peoples across most of [[West Asia]] and [[North Africa]],<ref name=Dictionary>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Arab |title=Arab |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date=1945-03-22 |accessdate=2010-04-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100420163736/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/arab| archivedate= 20 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> resulting in their [[acculturation]] and eventual denomination as Arabs. [[Arabization]], a culturo-linguistic shift, was often, though not always, in conjunction with [[Islamization]], a religious shift.

With the rise of Islam in the 7th century, and as the language of the [[Qur'an]], Arabic became the [[lingua franca]] of the Islamic world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chegne|first=Anwar G.|title=Arabic: Its Significance and Place in Arab-Muslim Society|journal=Middle East Journal|issue=19|date=Autumn 1965|pages=447–470}}</ref> It was in this period that Arabic language and culture was widely disseminated with the early [[Spread of Islam|Islamic expansion]], both [[Muslim conquests|through conquest]] and [[Acculturation|cultural contact]].<ref name=IslamAr>{{cite web|url=http://islam.about.com/library/weekly/aa032300a.htm |title=Islam and the Arabic language |publisher=Islam.about.com |date=2009-11-03 |accessdate=2010-04-13}}</ref>

[[Arabic culture]] and language, however, began a more limited diffusion before the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic age]], first spreading in West Asia beginning in the 2nd century, as [[Arab Christians]] such as the [[Ghassanids]], [[Lakhmids]] and [[Banu Judham]] began migrating north from Arabia into the [[Syrian Desert]], south western [[Iraq]] and the [[Levant]].<ref name=BanuJ>{{cite web|url=http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch1s1.html |title=Banu Judham migration |publisher=Witness-pioneer.org |date=2002-09-16 |accessdate=2010-04-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100504125806/http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch1s1.html| archivedate= 4 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name=Ghassan>{{cite web|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~andyf/hist_arab.html#Linguistic%20Situation%20in%20Pre-Islamic%20Middle%20East |title=Ghassanids Arabic linguistic influence in Syria |publisher=Personal.umich.edu |accessdate=2010-04-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100527110812/http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Eandyf/hist_arab.html| archivedate= 27 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In the modern era, defining who is an Arab is done on the grounds of one or more of the following two criteria:
[[File:Arabic speaking world.svg|thumb|Distribution of Arabic as sole official language (green) and one of several official or national languages (blue).]]
* [[Genealogy|Genealogical]]: someone who can trace his or her ancestry to the [[tribes of Arabia]] – the original inhabitants of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] – and the [[Syrian Desert]]. This was the definition used in [[medieval]] times, for example by [[Ibn Khaldun]], but has decreased in importance over time, as a portion of those of Arab ancestry lost their links with their ancestors' motherland. In the modern era, however, DNA tests have at times proved reliable in identifying those of Arab genealogical descent. For example, it has been found that the frequency of the "Arab marker" Haplogroup J1 collapses suddenly at the borders of Arabic speaking countries.<ref>(Regueiro et al.) 2006; found agreement by (Battaglia et al.) 2008</ref>
* [[Language|Linguistic]]: someone whose [[first language]], and by extension cultural expression, is [[Arabic language|Arabic]], including any of [[Varieties of Arabic|its varieties]]. This definition covers more than 450 million people. Certain groups that fulfill this criterion reject this definition on the basis of non-Arab ancestry; such an example may be seen in the way that [[Egyptian identity|Egyptians identified themselves in the early 20th century]].<ref name=Jankowskip244>Jankowski, James. "Egypt and Early Arab Nationalism" in Rashid Kakhlidi, ed., Origins of Arab Nationalism, pp. 244–245</ref><ref name=Dawishp99>Quoted in Dawisha, Adeed. [http://books.google.com/books?id=PjhqEusGs0UC&pg=PA99 Arab Nationalism in the Twentieth Century. Princeton University Press. 2003, ISBN 0-691-12272-5, p. 99]</ref>

The relative importance of these factors is estimated differently by different groups and frequently disputed. Some combine aspects of each definition, as done by Palestinian [[Habib Hassan Touma]],<ref name=Toumapxviii>1996, p.xviii</ref> who defines an ''Arab'' "in the modern sense of the word", as "one who is a national of an Arab state, has command of the Arabic language, and possesses a fundamental knowledge of Arab tradition, that is, of the manners, customs, and political and social systems of the culture." Most people who consider themselves Arab do so based on the overlap of the political and linguistic definitions.

The [[Arab League]], a regional organization of [[countries]] intended to encompass the Arab world, defines an Arab as:
{{quote|An Arab is a person whose language is Arabic, who lives in an Arabic-speaking country, and who is in sympathy with the aspirations of the Arabic-speaking peoples.<ref>Dwight Fletcher Reynolds, ''Arab folklore'': a handbook, (Greenwood Press: 2007), p.1.</ref>}}

[[File:Girls lining up for class - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|Schoolgirls in [[Gaza]] lining up for class, 2009]]
According to Sadek Jawad Sulaimanis the former Ambassador of Oman to the United States:{{quote|The Arabs are defined by their culture, not by race; and their culture is defined by its essential twin constituents of Arabism and Islam. To most of the Arabs, Islam is their indigenous religion; to all of the Arabs, Islam is their indigenous civilization. The Arab identity, as such, is a culturally defined identity, which means being Arab is being someone whose mother culture, or dominant culture, is Arabism. Beyond that, he or she might be of any ancestry, of any religion or philosophical persuasion, and a citizen of any country in the world. Being Arab does not contradict with being non-Muslim or non-Semitic or not being a citizen of an Arab state.<ref>Sadek Jawad Sulaiman, ''The Arab Identity''. Sadek Jawad Sulaiman. Al-Hewar/The Arab-American Dialogue Winter 2007. Chairman of Al-Hewar Center's Advisory Board.</ref>}}

The relation of ''{{transl|ar|ʿarab}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ʾaʿrāb}}'' is complicated further by the notion of "lost Arabs" ''{{transl|ar|al-ʿArab al-ba'ida}}'' mentioned in the Qur'an as punished for their disbelief. All contemporary Arabs were considered as descended from two ancestors, [[Qahtan]] and [[Adnan]].

Versteegh (1997) is uncertain whether to ascribe this distinction to the memory of a real difference of origin of the two groups, but it is certain that the difference was strongly felt in early Islamic times. Even in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] there was enmity between the Qays of the northern and the Kalb of the southern group. The so-called [[Sabaean language|Sabaean]] or Himyarite language described by [[Abū Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdānī]] (died 946) appears to be a special case of language contact between the two groups, an originally north Arabic dialect spoken in the south, and influenced by [[Old South Arabian]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}{{dubious|date=September 2011}}

During the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Arabs forged an [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] (under the [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]]s, and later the [[Abbasid]]s) whose borders touched southern [[France]] in the west, [[China]] in the east, [[Asia Minor]] in the north, and the [[Sudan]] in the south. This was one of the [[List of empires|largest land empires in history]]. In much of this area, the Arabs spread [[Islam]] and the Arabic culture, science, and language (the language of the [[Qur'an]]) through [[religious conversion|conversion]] and [[cultural assimilation]].

Two references valuable for understanding the political significance of Arab identity: Michael C. Hudson, Arab Politics: The Search for Legitimacy (Yale University Press, 1977), especially Chs. 2 and 3; and Michael N. Barnett, Dialogues in Arab Politics: Negotiations in Regional Order (Columbia University Press, 1998

==Arab population==
The table below shows the number of Arab people, including expatriates and some groups that may not be identified as Arabs.

The total number of Arabs living in the Arab nations is 366,117,749. The total number lining in non-Arab majority states is 17,474,000.  The worldwide total is 383,591,749.

From the time of the Arab conquest of the [[Caucasus]], continuous small-scale Arab migration from various parts of the Arab world was observed in [[Dagestan]] influencing and shaping the culture of the local peoples. Up until the mid-20th century, there were still individuals in Dagestan who claimed Arabic to be their native language, with the majority of them living in the village of Darvag to the north-west of [[Derbent]].

==History==
===Pre-Islamic===
{{Main|Pre-Islamic Arabia}}
[[File:NabateensRoutes.png|thumb|220px|Nabataean trade routes in Pre-Islamic Arabia]]
Pre-Islamic Arabia refers to the Arabic civilization which existed in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] before the rise of [[Islam]] in the 630s. The study of Pre-Islamic Arabia is important to [[Islamic studies]] as it provides the context for the development of Islam.

====Semitic origin====
[[File:Assyrian horsemen arabs.png|thumb|[[Assyria]]n horsemen pursue defeated Arabs]]
There is a consensus that the [[Semitic]] peoples originated from [[Arabian peninsula]].<ref>A history of the Babylonians and Assyrians, George Stephen Goodspeed‏. p.54</ref><ref name=Craggp13>Cragg, 1991, p. 13.</ref> It should be pointed out that these settlers were not Arabs or Arabic speakers. Early non Arab [[Semitic]] peoples from the [[Ancient Near East]], such as the [[Arameans]], [[Akkadians]] ([[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonians]]), [[Amorites]], [[Israelites]], [[Ebla]]ites, [[Ugarit]]es and [[Canaanites]], built civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Levant]]; genetically, they often interlapped and mixed.<ref name=Semitic>{{cite web|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/12/6769 |title=Journal of Semitic Studies Volume 52, Number 1 |publisher=Pnas.org |date=2000-06-06 |accessdate=2010-04-13}}</ref> Slowly, however, they lost their political domination of the [[Near East]] due to internal turmoil and attacks by non-Semitic peoples. Although the Semites eventually lost political control of Western Asia to the [[Persian Empire]], the [[Aramaic language]] remained the [[lingua franca]] of [[Assyria]], [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Levant]]. Aramaic itself was replaced by Greek as Western Asia's prestige language following the conquest of [[Alexander III of Macedon]], though it survives to this day among [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] (aka [[Chaldo-Assyrian]]) [[Christians]] and [[Mandeans]] in [[Iraq]], northeast [[Syria]], southeast [[Turkey]] and northwest [[Iran]].

====Early history====
The first written attestation of the ethnonym "Arab" occurs in an [[Assyria]]n inscription of 853 BCE, where [[Shalmaneser III]] lists a King [[Gindibu]] of ''mâtu arbâi'' (Arab land) as among the people he defeated at the [[Battle of Karkar]]. Some of the names given in these texts are [[Aramaic]], while others are the first attestations of [[Ancient North Arabian]] dialects. In fact several different ethnonyms are found in Assyrian texts that are conventionally translated "Arab": ''Arabi, Arubu, Aribi'' and ''Urbi''. Many of the [[Qedarite]] queens were also described as queens of the ''aribi''. The [[Hebrew Bible]] occasionally refers to ''Aravi'' peoples (or variants thereof), translated as "Arab" or "Arabian." The scope of the term at that early stage is unclear, but it seems to have referred to various desert-dwelling [[Semitic]] tribes in the [[Syrian Desert]] and [[Arabia]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Arab tribes came into conflict with the [[Assyria]]ns during the reign of the Assyrian king [[Ashurbanipal]], and he records military victories against the powerful [[Qedar]] tribe among others.

Medieval Arab [[genealogist]]s divided Arabs into three groups:
* "Ancient Arabs", tribes that had vanished or been destroyed, such as [[ʿĀd]] and [[Thamud]], often mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] as examples of God's power to destroy those who did not believe and follow their prophets and messengers.
* "Pure Arabs" of South Arabia, descending from [[Qahtan]]. The [[Qahtanite]]s (Qahtanis) are said to have migrated from the land of [[Yemen]] following the destruction of the [[Ma'rib Dam]] (''sadd Ma'rib'').
* The "Arabized Arabs" (''musta`ribah'') of center and North Arabia, descending from [[Ishmael]] the elder son of [[Abraham]]. The [[Book of Genesis]] narrates that [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] promised [[Hagar]] to beget from Ishmael twelve princes and turn him to a great nation.<sup>({{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:20|HE}})</sup> The [[Book of Jubilees]], in the other hand, claims that the sons of [[Ishmael]] intermingled with the 6 sons of [[Keturah]], from [[Abraham]], and their descendants were called Arabs and [[Ishmaelites]]: <blockquote>Book of [[Jubilees]] 20:13 ''And Ishmael and his sons, and the sons of [[Keturah]] and their sons, went together and dwelt from [[Desert of Paran|Paran]] to the entering in of [[Babylon]] in all the land which is towards the East facing the desert. And these mingled with each other, and their name was called Arabs, and [[Ishmaelites]].''</blockquote>

[[Ibn Khaldun]]'s ''[[Muqaddima]]'' distinguishes between sedentary Muslims who used to be [[nomad]]ic Arabs and the Bedouin nomadic Arabs of the desert. He used the term "formerly nomadic" Arabs and refers to sedentary Muslims by the region or city they lived in, as in [[Egyptians]], [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] and [[Yemen]]is.<ref name=Levity>{{cite web|url=http://www.levity.com/alchemy/islam20.html |title=Levity.com, Islam |publisher=Levity.com |accessdate=2010-04-13}}</ref> The Christians of Italy and the Crusaders preferred the term [[Saracens]] for all the Arabs and Muslims of that time.<ref name=Lionheart>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/lionheart.htm |title=www.eyewitnesstohistory.com |publisher=www.eyewitnesstohistory.com |accessdate=2010-04-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100402073536/http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/lionheart.htm| archivedate= 2 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The Christians of Iberia used the term [[Moors|Moor]] to describe all the Arabs and Muslims of that time.
Muslims of [[Medina]] referred to the [[nomadic]] tribes of the deserts as the A'raab, and considered themselves sedentary, but were aware of their close racial bonds. The term "A'raab' mirrors the term Assyrians used to describe the closely related nomads they defeated in Syria.

The [[Qur'an]] does not use the word ''{{transl|ar|ʿarab}}'', only the [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|nisba]] adjective ''{{transl|ar|ʿarabiy}}''. The Qur'an calls itself ''{{transl|ar|ʿarabiy}}'', "Arabic", and ''{{transl|ar|Mubin}}'', "clear". The two qualities are connected for example in ayat [[Az-Zukhruf|43]].2–3, "By the ''clear'' Book: We have made it an ''Arabic'' recitation in order that you may understand". The Qur'an became regarded as the prime example of the ''{{transl|ar|al-ʿarabiyya}}'', the language of the Arabs. The term ''[[I`rab|{{transl|ar|ʾiʿrāb}}]]'' has the same root and refers to a particularly clear and correct mode of speech. The plural noun ''{{transl|ar|ʾaʿrāb}}'' refers to the [[Bedouin]] tribes of the desert who resisted Muhammad, for example in ayat [[At-Tawba|9]].97, ''{{transl|ar|alʾaʿrābu ʾašaddu kufrān wa nifāqān}}'' "the Bedouin are the worst in [[kufr|disbelief]] and hypocrisy".

Based on this, in early Islamic terminology, ''{{transl|ar|ʿarabiy}}'' referred to the language, and ''{{transl|ar|ʾaʿrāb}}'' to the Arab Bedouins, carrying a negative connotation due to the Qur'anic verdict just cited. But after the [[Islamic conquest]] of the 8th century, the language of the nomadic Arabs became regarded as the most pure by the grammarians following [[Abi Ishaq]], and the term {{transl|ar|kalam al-ʿArab}}, "language of the Arabs", denoted the uncontaminated language of the Bedouins.

Proto-Arabic, or [[Ancient North Arabian]], texts give a clearer picture of the Arabs' emergence. The earliest are written in variants of [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraphic]] south Arabian ''[[South Arabian alphabet|musnad]]'' script, including the 8th century BCE [[Al-Hasa|Hasaean]] inscriptions of eastern Saudi Arabia, the 6th century BCE [[Lihyanite]] texts of southeastern Saudi Arabia and the [[Thamudic]] texts found throughout Arabia and the [[Sinai]] (not in reality connected with [[Thamud]]).

The [[Nabataeans]] were nomadic newcomers<ref name=Biblical>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblicalisraeltours.com/Arch/ArchaeologyJordan.htm |title=Biblical Israel Tours |publisher=Biblical Israel Tours |accessdate=2010-04-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100411062048/http://www.biblicalisraeltours.com/Arch/ArchaeologyJordan.htm| archivedate= 11 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>{{Dubious|date=August 2009}} who moved into territory vacated by the [[Edomites]] – Semites who settled the region centuries before them. Their early inscriptions were in [[Aramaic]], but gradually switched to Arabic, and since they had writing, it was they who made the first inscriptions in Arabic. The [[Nabataean Alphabet]] was adopted by Arabs to the south, and evolved into modern Arabic script around the 4th century. This is attested by [[Safaitic]] inscriptions (beginning in the 1st century BCE) and the many Arabic personal names in [[Nabataean]] inscriptions. From about the 2nd century BCE, a few inscriptions from Qaryat al-Faw (near [[Sulayyil]]) reveal a dialect which is no longer considered "proto-Arabic", but pre-classical Arabic. Five [[Syriac language|Syriac]] inscriptions mentioning Arabs have been found at [[Sumatar Harabesi]], one of which has been dated to the 2nd century CE.

====Late kingdoms====
{{Further|Lakhmids|Ghassanids|Kindites}}
The [[Ghassanids]], [[Lakhmids]] and [[Kindites]] were the last major migration of non-Muslims out of Yemen to the north.
* The [[Ghassanids]] increased the Semitic presence in the then Hellenized [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], the majority of Semites were [[Aramaic]] peoples. They mainly settled in the [[Hauran]] region and spread to modern [[Lebanon]], Palestine and East Jordan.

Greeks and Romans referred to all the nomadic population of the desert in the Near East as Arabi. The Romans called Yemen "[[Arabia Felix]]".<ref name=Diony>[http://www.cartographic-images.net/Cartographic_Images/117_Dionysius_Periegetes.html Dionysius Periegetes’ World Maps]</ref> The Romans called the vassal nomadic states within the [[Roman Empire]] "[[Arabia Petraea]]" after the city of [[Petra]], and called unconquered deserts bordering the empire to the south and east [[Arabia Magna]].
* The [[Lakhmids]] as a dynasty inherited their power from the [[Tanukh]]ids, the mid Tigris region around their capital [[Al-Hira]] they ended up allying with the [[Sassanid]] against the [[Ghassanids]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Lakhmids contested control of the Central Arabian tribes with the [[Kindites]] with the Lakhmids eventually destroying [[Kindah|Kinda]] in 540 after the fall of their main ally [[Himyar]]. The [[Persian people|Persians]] Sassanids dissolved the Lakhmid dynasty in 602, being under puppet kings, then under their direct control.<ref>Harold Bailey [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ko_RafMSGLkC&pg=PR59 The Cambridge history of Iran : The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods], Volume 1'', Cambridge University Press, 1983, ISBN 0-521-20092-X p. 59</ref>
* The [[Kindites]] migrated from Yemen along with the Ghassanids and Lakhmids, but were turned back in Bahrain by the Abdul Qais Rabi'a tribe. They returned to Yemen and allied themselves with the Himyarites who installed them as a vassal kingdom that ruled Central Arbia from "Qaryah Dhat Kahl" (the present-day called Qaryat al-Faw) in Central Arabia. They ruled much of the Northern/Central Arabian peninsula, till they were destroyed by the Lakhmid king [[Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man|Al-Mundhir]], and his son [['Amr III ibn al-Mundhir|'Amr]]

'''Rashidun Era''' (632-661)
{{main|Rashidun Caliphate}}
After the death of [[Muhammad]] in 632,  [[Rashidun army|Rashidun armies]] launched [[Muslim conquests|campaigns of conquest]], establishing the [[Caliphate]], or [[Rashidun Caliphate|Islamic Empire]], one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]]. It was larger and lasted longer than the previous Arab empires of [[Mavia (queen)|Queen Mawia]] or the [[Palmyrene Empire]] which was predominantly [[Syriac]] rather than Arab. The Rashidun state was a completely new state and not a mere imitation of the earlier Arab kingdoms such as the [[Himyarite]], Lakhmids or Ghassanids, although it benefited greatly from their art, administration and architecture.

'''Umayyad Era''' (661-750)

In 661 [[Caliphate]] turned to the hands of the [[Umayyad]] dynasty, [[Damascus]] was established as the [[Muslim]] capital. They were proud of their Arab ancestry and sponsored the poetry and culture of pre-Islamic Arabia. They established garrison towns at [[Ramla]], [[ar-Raqqah]], [[Basra]], [[Kufa]], [[Mosul]] and [[Samarra]], all of which developed into major cities.<ref name="Lunde">{{Cite book|last=Lunde |first=Paul |title=Islam |year=2002 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Publishing |pages= 50–52 |location=New York |isbn=0-7894-8797-7 }}</ref>

Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] established Arabic as the Caliphate's official language in 686.<ref>John Joseph Saunders, ''A history of medieval Islam'', Routledge, 1965, page 13</ref> This reform greatly influenced the conquered non-Arab peoples and fueled the [[Arabization]] of the region. However, the Arabs' higher status among non-Arab Muslim converts and the latter's obligation to pay heavy taxes caused resentment. Caliph [[Umar II]] strove to resolve the conflict when he came to power in 717. He rectified the situation, demanding that all Muslims be treated as equals, but his intended reforms did not take effect as he died after only three years of rule. By now, discontent with the Umayyads swept the region and an uprising occurred in which the [[Abbasid]]s came to power and moved the capital to [[Baghdad]].

Umayyads expanded their Empire westwards capturing North Africa from the Byzantines. Prior to the Arab conquest, North Africa was inhibited by various people including [[Punics]], Vandals and Greeks. It was not until the 11th century that the [[Maghreb]] saw a large influx of ethnic Arabs. Starting with the 11th century, the Arab bedouin [[Banu Hilal]] tribes migrated to the West. Having been sent by the [[Fatimids]] to punish the Berber [[Zirids]] for abandoning [[Shia Islam|Shiism]], they travelled westwards. The Banu Hilal quickly defeated the Zirids and deeply weakened the neighboring [[Hammadid]]s. Their influx was a major factor in the Arabization of the Maghreb, Although Berbers would rule the region until the 16th century (under such powerful dynasties as the [[Almoravids]], the [[Almohads]], [[Hafsids]], etc.), the arrival of these tribes would eventually help to Arabize much of it ethnically in addition to the linguistic and political impact on the none-Arabs there. With the collapse of the Umayyad state in 1031 AD, [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] was divided into small kingdoms.

{{main|Abbasid Caliphate}}

Abbasids let a revolt against the Umayyads and defeated them in the [[Battle of the Zab]] effectively ending their rule in all part of the Empire except [[Al-Andalus]]. The Abbasids descendants of Muhammad's uncle [[‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|Abbas]], but unlike the Umayyads, they had the support of non-Arab subjects of the Umayyads.<ref name="Lunde"/> where Umayyads treated non-Arabs in contempt. Abbasids ruled for 200 years before they lost their central control when [[Wilayah|Wilayas]] began to fracture, afterwards in the 1190s there was a revival for their power which was put to end by the Mongols who conquered Baghdad and killed the Caliph, members of the Abbasid royal family escaped the massacre and resorted to Cairo, which fractured from the Abbasid rule two years earlier, the Mamluk generals were taking the political side of the kingdom while Abbasid Caliphs were engaged in civil activities and continued patronizing science, arts and literature.

====Ottoman Caliphate====
[[File:Peasant Family of Ramallah 1900-1910.jpg|thumb|Arab family of [[Ramallah]], [[Palestine]] in early 1900s]]
Arabs were ruled by Ottoman sultans from 1513 to 1918. Ottomans defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in Cairo, and ended the Abbasid Caliphate when they choose to bear the title of [[Caliph]]. Arabs did not feel the change of administration because Ottomans modeled their rule after the previous Arab administration systems. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} After [[World War I]] when the [[Ottoman Empire]] was overthrown by the [[British Empire]], former Ottoman colonies were divided up between the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]] as Mandates.

===Modern===
Arabs in modern times live in the Arab world, which comprises 22 countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of the Horn of Africa. They are all modern states and became significant as distinct political entities after the fall and [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] (1908–1918).

The [[Jewish tribes of Arabia]] were Arabian tribes professing the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] that inhabited the [[Arabian Peninsula]] before and during the advent of [[Islam]]. It is not always clear whether they were originally [[Israelite]] in ancestry, genealogically Arab tribes that converted to Judaism, or a mixture of both. In Islamic tradition the Jewish tribes of the [[Hejaz]] were seen as the offspring of the ancient [[Israelites]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gil|first=Moshe|title=The origin of the Jews of Yathrib|year=1997|pages=4–5|url=http://books.google.co.il/books?id=8vTTCwG0nKIC&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=The+Origin+of+the+Jews+of+Yathrib&source=bl&ots=GCKVGi8VCr&sig=mGflTUOITYVGs7_4HAOxZkDlm5A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gluqUaPCAaml0AXGzIDADg&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> According to Muslim sources, they spoke a language other than Arabic, which [[Al-Tabari]] claims was Persian. This implies they were connected to the major Jewish center in [[Babylon]].<ref>Ibid,5</ref> Certain Jewish traditions records the existence of nomadic tribes such as the [[Rechabite]]s that converted to Judaism in antiquity. The tribes collapsed with the rise of Islam, with many either converting or fleeing the Arab peninsula. Some of those tribes are thought to have merged into [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite Jewish community]], while others, like the residents of [[Yatta, Hebron|Yatta]] consider themselves Islamized descendants of [[Khaybar]], a Jewish tribe of Arabia.

Prior to the massive Sephardic emigrations to the Middle East in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Jewish communities of what are today Syria, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Egypt and Yemen were known by other Jewish communities as [[Musta'arabi Jews]] or "like Arabs". Also, prior to the emergence of the term ''Mizrahi'', the term "[[Arab Jews]]" was sometimes used to describe Jews living in the Arab world.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} From the late 1940s to the early 1960s, following the creation of the state of Israel, most of descendants of these Jews [[Jewish exodus from Arab countries|fled or were expelled]] from their countries of birth and now live in Israel, [[France]] or elsewhere. The few remaining Jews in the Arab countries reside mostly in [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]].

Modern [[Jew]]s from Arab countries – mainly [[Mizrahi Jews]], [[Yemenite Jews]] and [[Maghrebi Jews]] – are today usually not categorized as Arab, though there is still some debate on whether or not the term "Arabs" can be applied to them. Sociologist Sammy Smooha stated "This ("Arab Jews") term does not hold water. It is absolutely not a parallel to 'Arab Christian'".<ref>Lee, Vered.

The [[Islamic Golden Age]] was inaugurated by the middle of the 8th century by the ascension of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and the transfer of the capital from [[Damascus]] to the newly founded city [[Baghdad]]. The Abbassids were influenced by the [[Qur'an]]ic injunctions and [[hadith]] such as "The ink of the scholar is more holy than the blood of martyrs" stressing the value of knowledge. During this period the [[Muslim world]] became an intellectual centre for science, philosophy, medicine and education as the Abbasids championed the cause of knowledge and established the "[[House of Wisdom]]" (Arabic: بيت الحكمة) in Baghdad. Rival Muslim dynasties such as the [[Fatimid]]s of [[Egypt]] and the [[Umayyad]]s of [[al-Andalus]] were also major intellectual centres with cities such as [[Cairo]] and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] rivaling [[Baghdad]].<ref name="Vartan">Vartan Gregorian, "Islam: A Mosaic, Not a Monolith", Brookings Institution Press, 2003, pg 26–38 ISBN 0-8157-3283-X</ref>

==Culture==

[[Arab culture]] is a term that draws together the common themes and overtones found in the Arab countries, especially those of the [[Middle-Eastern]] countries. This region's distinct religion, art, and food are some of the fundamental features that define Arab culture.

===Art===
[[Arabic Art]] includes a wide range or artistic components, it can be [[Arabic miniature]], calligraphy or [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]].

===Architecture===
[[Arab Architecture]] has a deep diverse history, it dates to the dawn of the history in pre-Islamic Arabia. Each of it phases largely an extension of the earlier phase, it left also heavy impact on the architecture of other nations.

===Music===
[[File:Mohammed Abdu.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Mohammed Abdu]], the Fnan al-arab, ''Artist of the Arabs'']]
[[Arabic music]] is the music of Arab people or countries, especially those centered on the Arabian Peninsula. The world of Arab music has long been dominated by [[Cairo]], a cultural center, though musical innovation and regional styles abound from Morocco to [[Saudi Arabia]]. [[Beirut]] has, in recent years, also become a major center of Arabic music. [[Classical Arab music]] is extremely popular across the population, especially a small number of superstars known throughout the Arab world. [[File:Bmane2002-1-114,1.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Qataban]]ian era musical scene, 1st century AD]] Regional styles of popular music include [[Algeria]]n [[raï]], [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[gnawa]], [[Kuwait]]i [[Sawt (music)|sawt]], [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian]] [[el gil]] and Arabesque-pop music in [[Turkey]].
Most historians agree that there existed distinct forms of music in the Arabian peninsula in the pre-Islamic period between the 5th and 7th century AD. Arab poets of that time—called shu`ara' al-Jahiliyah (شعراء الجاهلية) or "Jahili poets", meaning "the poets of the period of ignorance"—used to recite poems with a high note.
It was believed that Jinns revealed poems to poets and music to musicians. The choir at the time served as a pedagogic facility where the educated poets would recite their poems. Singing was not thought to be the work of these intellectuals and was instead entrusted to women with beautiful voices who would learn how to play some instruments used at that time such as the drum, the oud or the rebab, and perform the songs while respecting the poetic metre.

===Literature===
[[File:Khalil Gibran - Autorretrato con musa, c. 1911.jpg|thumb|120px|Self portrait of renown Lebanese poet/writer [[Khalil Gibran]]]]
[[Arabic literature]] emerged in the 5th century with only fragments of the written language appearing before then.  The [[Qur'an]], widely regarded as the finest piece of literature work in the [[Arabic language]],<ref>Jones, p. ix.</ref> would have the greatest lasting effect on [[Arabic culture]] and its literature. Arabic literature flourished during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], but has remained vibrant to the present day, with poets and prose-writers across the Arab world achieving increasing success.

Arabic literature spans for over two millennium, it has three phases, the pre-Islamic, Islamic and modern. Arabic literature had contributions by thousands of figures, many of them are not only poets but are celebrates in other fields such as politicians, scientists and scholars among others.

==Genetics==

===Y-Chromosome===
[[Haplogroup]] [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] is the most frequent haplogroup in Western Arabs ([[Maghrebis]]) while haplogroup [[Haplogroup J-M267|J]] is the most frequent haplogroup in Eastern Arabs ([[Mashriq]]).<ref>Bekada A, Fregel R, Cabrera VM, Larruga JM, Pestano J, et al.

The Paternal Ancestry found across all Arabic countries is Haplogroup J1 especially its major subclade J-P58 the haplogroup that spread with Arabic conquest in the 7th century. It was found that Haplogroup J1 occur at high frequencies among the Arabic-speaking populations of the Middle East and is the prevalent Y-chromosome lineage within the Near East. Haplogroup J1e (J-P58) is also associated with a Semitic linguistic common denominator, with the YCAII 22-22 allele state is closely associated with J1e.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Chiaroni et Al|title=The emergence of Y-chromosome haplogroup J1e among Arabic-speaking populations|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=14 October 2009|volume=18|issue=3|pages=348–353|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2009.166 }}</ref>

The Arab conquest appears to have had a dramatic influence on the East and South Mediterranean coasts. The presence of Arab Y chromosome lineages in the Middle East suggests that most have experienced substantial gene flow from the Arabian peninsula.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Capelli|first=C.|coauthors=Redhead, N.; Romano, V.; Cali, F.; Lefranc, G.; Delague, V.; Megarbane, A.; Felice, A.

===Maternal Chromosome===

The Maternal ancestral lineages of Arabic countries are very diverse. The original Historical Maternal ancestral Haplogroups of the Near East were Mt (Maternal) L3 Haplogroup and Mt HV1 haplogroup that are still high in Yemen, while in Greater Syria there is a European Maternal gene flow. In the Arabic West the dominant Maternal lineage is the rare Scandinavian Europpean U8 haplogroup probably came with the Vandals when escaped from Spain from the Visigoths.<ref name="Al-Zahery 288">{{cite journal|last=Al-Zahery|first=N|coauthors=Pala, M; Battaglia, V; Grugni, V; Hamod, MA; Hooshiar Kashani, B; Olivieri, A; Torroni, A; Santachiara-Benerecetti, AS; Semino, O|title=In search of the genetic footprints of Sumerians: a survey of Y-chromosome and mtDNA variation in the Marsh Arabs of Iraq.|journal=BMC evolutionary biology|date=2011 Oct 4|volume=11|pages=288|pmid=21970613}}</ref><ref name="Yanni 408–13">{{cite journal|last=Yanni|first=EA|coauthors=Copeland, G; Olney, RS|title=Birth defects and genetic disorders among Arab Americans--Michigan, 1992-2003.|journal=Journal of immigrant and minority health / Center for Minority Public Health|date=2010 Jun|volume=12|issue=3|pages=408–13|pmid=18972209}}</ref><ref name="Hassan 316–23">{{cite journal|last=Hassan|first=HY|coauthors=Underhill, PA; Cavalli-Sforza, LL; Ibrahim, ME|title=Y-chromosome variation among Sudanese: restricted gene flow, concordance with language, geography, and history.|journal=American journal of physical anthropology|date=2008 Nov|volume=137|issue=3|pages=316–23|pmid=18618658}}</ref>

===Other Chromosomes===

Many of the pronounced genetic deficiencies in Arabs (causing genetic disorders specific to Arabs) are located on HLA segment on chromosome 6. This same segment mutations are also markers of Arabs in Genealogical and forensic profiling tests and studies. Such studies as:
