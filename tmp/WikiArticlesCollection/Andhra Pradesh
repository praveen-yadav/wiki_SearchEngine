'''Andhra Pradesh''' ({{IPAc-en|,|ah|n|d|r|@|_|p|r|@|'|d|E|sh}}; {{lang-te|ఆంధ్ర ప్రదేశ్}}), abbreviated '''A.P.''', is one of the 28 [[States and territories of India|states]] of [[India]], situated on the country's southeastern coast. It is India's [[List of states and territories of India by area|fourth largest state by area]] and [[List of states and union territories of India by population|fifth largest by population]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]. Andhra Pradesh is bordered by [[Maharashtra]], [[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Orissa]] in the north, the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the east, [[Tamil Nadu]] to the south and [[Karnataka]] to the west. <!-- (Note: The Congress Party has approved the creation of a 29th state, Telangana, to be cut out of Andhra Pradesh. However, the state has not yet officially been approved by Parliament, so it cannot yet be put in this article.) -->

On 30 July 2013, the Congress Working Committee adopted a resolution on the bifurcation of the state subject to Parliamentary approval[http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/AndhraPradesh/Telangana-formation-cleared-Hyderabad-joint-capital-for-10-yrs/Article1-1100744.aspx]. Once approved by parliament, the state of [[Telangana]] will come in existence with 10 districts, while the rest of the state will still be called the state of Andhra Pradesh and will have 13 districts. Hyderabad (Part of Telangana) will be the common capital for both of the states for 10 years.

According to the Planning Commission of India, in the financial year 2011-12 the state was second in nominal GDP, and in GDP per capital it ranks fourth.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Planning Commission Government Of India|url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/data/datatable/0904/tab_104.pdf}}</ref> Andhra Pradesh GDP in financial year 2011 was {{INRConvert|567636|c}}.<ref name=unidow>{{cite web|url=http://unidow.com/in-en/statewise_gdp.html |title=State Domestic Product of India 2010-11 &#124; State-Wise GDP 2010 &#124; District GDP of India &#124; State-wise Population 2011 &#124; VMW Analytic Services |publisher=Unidow.com |date= |accessdate=11 October 2012}}</ref> It is historically called the "Rice Bowl of India".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/2011/08/22234611/The-rice-bowl-of-India-may-see.html |title=The rice bowl of India may see a crop holiday on bumper harvest - Economy and Politics |publisher=livemint.com |date=22 August 2011 |accessdate=8 July 2012}}</ref> More than 77% of its crop is rice; Andhra Pradesh produced {{convert|17,796,000|tonne|ST|0}} of rice in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title= Rough rice production (000 t) in India, by state, 1961–2006|url= http://www.irri.org/science/ricestat/data/may2008/WRS2008-Table07.pdf |date= May 2008|publisher=International Rice Research Institute |accessdate=25 August 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Two of the mega cities of the state - [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Visakhapatnam]] - were listed among the top 15 cities contributing to [[India]]'s overall [[Gross domestic product]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Sat 3 Nov, 2012, 8:24 PM IST - India Markets closed |url=http://in.finance.yahoo.com/photos/the-top-15-indian-cities-by-gdp-1348807591-slideshow/the-top-15-indian-cities-by-gdp-photo-1348807049.html |title=India’s top 15 cities with the highest GDP Photos &#124; Pictures - Yahoo!

===Early history===

[[Megasthenes]], a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] traveller and geographer who visited the Court of [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (322–297 BCE), mentioned that the region had three fortified towns and an army of 100,000 infantry, 200 cavalry, and 1,000 elephants. [[Buddhist]] books reveal that Andhras established their huts or tents near the [[Godavari River]] at that time.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The natural history of Pliny, volume 3|url=http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+6.21|year=1855|publisher=London, H.

Inscriptions shows that there was an early kingdom in [[coastal Andhra]] (Guntur District) ruled first by Kuberaka and then by his son Varun, with Pratipalapura ([[Bhattiprolu]]) as the capital. Around the same time, Dhanyakatakam/[[Dharanikota]] (present day [[Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh|Amaravati]]) appears to have been an important place, which was visited by [[Gautama Buddha]]. According to the ancient [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] scholar [[Taranatha]]: "On the full moon of the month [[Chaitra]] in the year following his enlightenment, at the great [[stupa]] of Dhanyakataka, the Buddha emanated the [[mandala]] of 'The Glorious Lunar Mansions' ([[Kalachakra]])".<ref>Helmutt Hoffmann, "Buddha's Preaching of the Kalachakra [[Tantra]] at the Stupa of Dhanyakataka," ''German Scholars on India'', Vol. I.

The [[Maurya Empire|Mauryans]] extended their rule over Andhra in the 4th century BCE. With the fall of the Maurya Empire in the 3rd century BCE, the [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]] became independent. After the decline of the Satavahanas in 220 CE, the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]], [[Pallava]]s, [[Ananda Gotrika]]s, [[Rashtrakuta]]s, [[Vishnukundina]]s, [[Eastern Chalukyas]], and [[Chola Dynasty|Cholas]] ruled the land.<ref>G.

During this period,{{Clarify|date=August 2012}} Telugu emerged as a popular language, supplanting [[Prakrit]] and [[Sanskrit]].<ref>Epigraphica Indica, 27: 220–228</ref> Telugu was made the official language by the [[Vishnukundina]] kings (5th and 6th centuries), who ruled from their capital city of [[Vengi]]. Eastern [[Chalukyas]] ruled for a long period after the decline of Vishnukundinas; their capital was also Vengi. As early as the 1st century CE, Chalukyas were mentioned as being vassals and chieftains under the Satavahanas and later under the Ikshvakus.

The battle of [[Palnadu]] (1182) resulted in the weakening of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty and led to the emergence of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] in the 12th and 13th centuries CE. The Kakatiyas were at first vassals of the Rashtrakutas, and ruled over a small territory near Warangal. Eventually all the Telugu lands were united by the Kakatiyas. In 1323 CE, [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultan]] [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] sent a large army under Ulugh Khan to conquer the Telugu country and captured Warangal. King Prataparudra was taken prisoner. [[Musunuri Nayaks]] recaptured Warangal from the Delhi Sultanate in 1326 CE and ruled for fifty years

===Modern history===
Inspired by their success, the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], one of the greatest empires in the history of Andhra Pradesh and India, was founded by [[Harihara]] and [[Bukka]], who served as treasury officers of the Kakatiyas of Warangal.<ref>Robert Sewell, ''A Forgotten Empire (Vijayanagar): A contribution to the history of India'', Chapter 2 [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/fevch10.txt Gutenberg.org]</ref> In 1347 CE, an independent Muslim state, the [[Bahmani Sultanate]], was established in [[south India]] by [[Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah]] in a revolt against the Delhi Sultanate. The [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] held sway over the Andhra country for about two hundred years from the early part of the 16th century to the end of the 17th century.<ref name="Richards">{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=J.

Although Hyderabad was founded less than 500 years ago, archaeologists have unearthed Iron Age sites near the city that could date back to 500 BCE. Approximately over 1000 years ago this region was ruled by Kakatiyas until 1310 CE, and fell under Delhi sultanate from (1310–1345), when the central sultanate became weak the Bahmani Sultan revolted against the Sultan of Delhi Muhammad bin Tughluq and established an independent state in Deccan within the Delhi Sultanates southern provinces and ruled until 1518 CE. Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk, governor of Golconda, declared independence from the Bahmani Dynasty and proclaimed himself Sultan of Golcanda in that year, and he founded the Qutb Shahi dynasty.<ref name="Bansal_2005">{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of India |last=Bansal |first=SP |page=61 |year=2007 |publisher=Smriti |isbn=81-87967-71-4 }}</ref>

Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, a fifth Sultan of the Qutb Shahi dynasty (the ruling family of the Golconda Sultanate, previously a feudatory of Bahmani sultanate that declared independence in 1512) founded the city of Hyderabad on the banks of the Musi River in 1591[20] to relieve a water shortage the dynasty had experienced at its old headquarters at Golconda city (11 kilometres west of Hyderabad city on the other side of Musi). He also ordered the construction of the Charminar. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb captured kingdom of Golconda including the city of Hyderabad in 1687 and, during this short Mughal rule, Mughal-appointed governors of the city soon gained autonomy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourmch.com/hyd/hydhistory.asp |title=History - Hyderabad |publisher=Ourmch.com |date=1 November 1956 |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref>

In 1724, Asaf Jah I, who was granted the title Nizam-ul-Mulk ("Governor of the country") by the Mughal emperor, defeated a rival official to establish control over kingdom of Golconda renamed it as Hyderabad state. Thus began the Asaf Jahi dynasty that ruled Hyderabad State until a year after India's independence from Britain. Asaf Jah's successors ruled as the Nizams of Hyderabad. The rule of the seven Nizams saw the growth of Hyderabad city both culturally and economically. Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the kingdom (Hyderabad state) and Golkonda city was almost abandoned. Huge reservoirs, like the Nizam Sagar, Tungabhadra, Osman Sagar, and Himayat Sagar, were built. Survey work on Nagarjuna Sagar had also begun during this time; the actual work was completed by the Government of India in 1969. The wealth and grandeur of the Nizams is demonstrated by the fabled Jewels of The Nizams, which is a tourist attraction. The state was the richest and the largest among the princely states of India. The land area of the state was 90,543&nbsp;mi²; its population in 1901 was 50,073,759. It enjoyed an estimated revenue of £90,029,000.<ref>name="Golcondathroughtime"</ref><ref>name="TheNocturnalCourt"</ref>

In [[Colonial India]], [[Northern Circars]] became part of the British [[Madras Presidency]]. Eventually this region emerged as the [[Coastal Andhra]] region. Later the [[Nizam]] rulers of Hyderabad ceded five territories to the British which eventually emerged as [[Rayalaseema]] region. The Nizams retained control of the interior provinces as the [[princely state]] of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], acknowledging British rule in return for local autonomy. However, [[Komaram Bheem]], a tribal leader, started his fight against the erstwhile [[Asaf Jahi Dynasty]] for the liberation of [[Hyderabad State]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/09/18/stories/2005091816590500.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Tributes paid to Telangana martyrs | date=18 September 2005}}</ref> Meanwhile, the [[French colonial empire|French]] occupied [[Yanam (India)|Yanam]], in the Godavari delta, and (save for periods of British control) would hold it until 1954.

[[Indian independence movement|India became independent]] from the United Kingdom in 1947. The Nizam wanted to retain the independence of the Princely Hyderabad State from India, but the people of the region launched a movement to join the Indian Union. The state of Hyderabad was forcibly joined to the Republic of India with [[Operation Polo]] in 1948.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,799076-2,00.html | work=Time | title=HYDERABAD: The Holdout | date=30 August 1948 | accessdate=20 May 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100522212635/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,799076-2,00.html| archivedate= 22 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
===State reorganisation===
In an effort to gain an independent state based on the linguistic and protect the interests of the Andhra (Telugu-speaking) people of [[Madras State]], [[Potti Sreeramulu]] fasted until death in 1952. After 1949 JVP committee report which stated " Andhra Province could be formed provided the Andhras gave up their claim to the city of Madras (now Chennai)", Madras city became bone of contention. But after Potti Sreeramulu's death, [[Andhra state]] was carved out of Telugu speaking areas of [[Madras State]] on 1 November 1953, with [[Kurnool]] as its capital city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2626/stories/20100101262602100.htm |title=Reorganisation, then and now |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aponline.gov.in/quick%20links/hist-cult/history_post.html#Emergence |title= Home > AP Fact File > History and Culture > History > Post-Independence Era, then and now |publisher=aponline.gov.in |date= |accessdate=3 August 2013}}</ref>

The city of [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], the former capital of the Hyderabad State, was made the capital of the new state.

There were several movements to invalidate the merger to form two states viz. [[Andhra State|Andhra]] and [[Telangana]] in 1969, 1972 and now. 1969 movement was in Telangana region where 369 people died in police firings and 1972 movement was in Andhra region. In 1972 to invalidate the Supreme Court ruling that the Mulki Rules for Telanagana people protection in jobs and education which were part of Gentlemen Agreement are valid, Jai Andhra Movement took place and Six Point formula implemented to give legal sanctity to the jobs and educational facilities to Andhra people in Telanagana region. A Current movement, which started in 1996, is in Telangana region and is an ongoing political issue in the state. In 2004 Congress party and in 2009 TDP party have fought elections with alliance with Telangana Rashtra Samithi party (which was born for Telangana state formation in 2001).

On 9 December 2009, Government of India announced process of formation of Telangana state. It was announced that a separation proposal for Telangana would be introduced to the state assembly.<ref name="Financial Times">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7bb4f9e8-e5ae-11de-b5d7-00144feab49a.html |title=/ India / Politics & Society&nbsp;– Protests as India carves up Andhra Pradesh |work=Financial Times |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref> Controversy arose as to the future status of [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad City]], part of one of the ten districts of Telangana region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/news/india/home_secretary_to_retract_hyderabad_statement.php |title=Home Secretary retracts Hyderabad statement|publisher=Ndtv.com |date= |accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref> This move was opposed by protesters from Kosta and Rayalaseema regions; however, the protests in the state capital Hyderabad were rocked only by pro-bifurcation protests.

On July 30, 2013 the ruling Congress party announced its intention to carve Telangana out of Andhra Pradesh as the 29th state of [[India|Republic of India]].

This triggered the rise of [[Samaikyandhra Movement]] (United Andhra movement) in the coastal and rayalaseema districts of the state. The agitation led by Non Gazetteed officer employee unions of the state government with support from students and all sections of people crossed 63 days upsetting the  public life across the region.

Geographically, Andhra Pradesh is composed of most of the eastern half of the [[Deccan plateau]] and the plains to the east of the [[Eastern Ghats]]. Andhra Pradesh is divided into three regions. The northern part of the plateau is the [[Telangana]] region and the southern part is known as [[Rayalaseema]]. These two regions are separated by the [[River Krishna]]. The third region is [[Coastal Andhra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maharashtraweb.com/AndhraPradesh/AndhraPradeshgeography.htm |title=Andhra Pradesh Geography |publisher=Maharashtraweb.com |date=|accessdate=15 August 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100929081617/http://maharashtraweb.com/AndhraPradesh/AndhraPradeshgeography.htm| archivedate= 29 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The plains to the east of Eastern Ghats form the [[Eastern coastal plains]]. The Eastern Ghats are discontinuous and individual sections have local names. The Kadapa Basin<ref>[http://www.dae.gov.in/amd/regions/scr_cud.htm]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> formed by two arching branches of the Eastern Ghats is a mineral-rich area. The coastal plains are for the most part delta regions formed by the [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[River Krishna|Krishna]], and [[Penner River|Penner]] rivers. The Eastern Ghats are a major dividing line in the state's geography. The Ghats become more pronounced towards the south and extreme north of the coast. The Eastern Ghat region is home to dense tropical forests, while the vegetation becomes sparse as the Ghats give way to the Deccan Plateau, where shrub vegetation is more common. Most of the coastal plains are put to intense agricultural use. The west and southwest parts of Andhra Pradesh have semi-arid conditions.

[[Indian Space Research Organisation]]'s [[Satish Dhawan Space Centre]] is located at the [[barrier island]] of [[Sriharikota]], in [[Nellore]] district of Andhra Pradesh.

The climate of Andhra Pradesh varies considerably, depending on the geographical region. Monsoons play a major role in determining the climate of the state. Summers last from March to June. In the coastal plain, the summer temperatures are generally higher than the rest of the state, with temperature ranging between 20 °C and 41 °C.<ref name="tourisminap.com">{{cite web|author=Aptdc, Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation|url=http://www.tourisminap.com/know_ap/index.php |title=APTDC – Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation|publisher=Tourisminap.com|date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100806000215/http://www.tourisminap.com/know_ap/index.php| archivedate= 6 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

July to September is the seasons for tropical rains in Andhra Pradesh. The state receives heavy rainfall from Southwest Monsoon during these months. About one third of the total rainfall in Andhra Pradesh is brought by the [[Northeast Monsoon]]. October and November see low-pressure systems and tropical cyclones form in the Bay of Bengal which, along with the Northeast Monsoon, bring rains to the southern and coastal regions of the state. November, December, January, and February are the winter months in Andhra Pradesh. Since the state has a long coastal belt the winters are not very cold. The range of winter temperature is generally 12 °C to 30 °C.<ref name="tourisminap.com"/>

[[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] is the capital and, along with the adjoining twin city [[Secunderabad]], is the largest city in the state.[[Visakhapatnam]], Andhra Pradesh's main seaport, is the second largest city and is home to the [[Indian Navy]]'s Eastern Naval Command. Due to its location and proximity to major rail and road routes, [[Vijayawada]] is a major trading centre and is the third largest city of the state, [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupati]] is the fourth largest city of the state, followed by  [[Rajamundry]], [[Guntur]], [[Nellore]],  [[Warangal]], and [[Kakinada]]. Other important places of the state are [[Kadapa]], [[Srikakulam]], and [[Kurnool]].

Andhra Pradesh had a series of governments headed by Indian National Congress (INC) Party until 1982.[[Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao]] is the founder of Telugu Desam party and served as the first chief minister from the party. [[Nara Chandrababu Naidu|N. Chandrababu Naidu]] held the record for the longest serving chief minister (1995 to 2004). [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]] served as the chief minister of the state from 1971 to 1973, and went on to become the Prime Minister of India in 1991. The first Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh was [[Neelam Sanjiva Reddy]] who later served as President of India. The Congress chief ministers of the state are [[Damodaram Sanjivayya]], [[Kasu Brahmananda Reddy]], [[P. V.

Until 1962, the CPI, along with socialist parties, played an important role as opposition parties. Parties namely Praja Socialist Party and Krishi Lok Party played important role in 1950's. In the 1967 state assembly elections all socialist parties were eliminated and CPI lost opposition party status. N.G. Ranga's Swatantra Party became the Opposition Party. They also failed to hold control later and became defunct. In 1978 Jalagam Vengal Rao and Kasu Brahmananda Reddy formed the Reddy Congress and contested against INC but lost.

In 1983 the [[Telugu Desam Party]] (TDP) won the state elections and [[N.T. Rama Rao]] (NTR) became the chief minister of the state for the first time. This broke the long time single party monopoly enjoyed by the INC from 1956 until 1982. A few months after the election, [[Nadendla Bhaskara Rao]] usurped power when NTR was away in the United States for medical treatment. After coming back, NTR campaigned for a comeback by demonstrating the support of the majority of the elected MLAs. The governor [[Thakur Ram Lal]] was ousted by [[Indira Gandhi]] and in his place she appointed [[Shankar Dayal Sharma]]. NTR was reinstated as chief minister. Within a month NTR recommended the dissolution of the assembly and called for fresh elections. Indira Gandhi was [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|assassinated]] on 31 October 1984 by her Sikh bodyguard and [[Rajiv Gandhi]] was made Prime Minister by President Giani [[Zail Singh]]. In the ensuing elections for Lok Sabha and the AP Assembly, the Telugu Desam Party won in Andhra Pradesh and NTR came back to power.

The 1989 elections ended the rule of NTR, with the INC party returning to power with [[Marri Chenna Reddy]] at the helm. He was replaced by [[Nedurumalli Janardhana Reddy|Janardhan Reddy]] in 1990, who was replaced by [[Kotla Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy]] in 1992. In 1994, Andhra Pradesh gave a mandate to the Telugu Desam Party again, and NTR became the chief minister again. [[Nara Chandrababu Naidu]], the son-in-law of NTR, came to power with the backing of a majority of the MLAs. The Telugu Desam Party won both the assembly and Lok Sabha election in 1999 under the leadership of [[Nara Chandrababu Naidu|Chandrababu Naidu]]. There was an assassination attempt on Naidu in 2003 in Tirupathi; he survived the attack. In the ensuing elections the party lost power to a resurgent INC and its allies. [[Y. S. Rajasekhar Reddy]] became the Chief Minister.

[[Y. S. Rajasekhar Reddy]] became the CM again by fending off the [[Praja Rajyam Party]] and a major alliance of TDP, TRS, CPI and CPM. He died on 2 September 2009 in a helicopter crash. [[Konijeti Rosaiah]], a senior statesman and former state finance minister, became the Chief Minister on 3 September 2009. On 24 November 2010, Rosaiah submitted his resignation on the grounds of increased work pressure. [[Nallari Kiran Kumar Reddy]] was sworn in as the new Chief Minister on the following day.<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article91229.ece?homepage=true thehindu.com]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref>

There are one thousand pillars in the building and the temple, but no pillar obstructs a person in any point of the temple to see the god in the other temple. The present day engineers have taken out all the pillars from the building. After they lifted all the pillars they encountered a huge mass of sand. It took nearly two weeks for them to take away all the sand. It was wet sand, because of a pipe connection from the nearby water body named Bhadrakali Cheruvu.
