An '''analgesic''', or '''painkiller''', is any member of the group of [[Pharmaceutical drug|drugs]] used to achieve [[wiktionary:analgesia|analgesia]] — relief from [[pain]]. The word ''analgesic'' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''αν –'' ("without") and ''άλγος –'' ("pain").<ref>{{cite web |last=Harper,D.|title=Online Etymology Dictionary: Analgesia|year=2001|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=analgesia|accessdate=December 3, 2012}}</ref> 

Analgesic drugs act in various ways on the [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] and [[central nervous system|central]] nervous systems.  They are distinct from [[anesthetic]]s, which reversibly eliminate [[sense|sensation]], and include [[paracetamol]] (known in the US as [[acetaminophen]] or simply APAP), the [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) such as the [[salicylate]]s, and [[opioid]] drugs such as [[morphine]] and [[opium]].

In choosing analgesics, the severity and response to other medication determines the choice of agent; the World Health Organization (WHO) [[pain ladder]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Anonymous |title=Cancer pain relief and palliative care; report of a WHO expert committee |series=World Health Organization Technical Report Series, 804 |year=1990 |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva, Switzerland  |isbn=92-4-120804-X |pages=1–75}}</ref> specifies mild analgesics as its first step.

Analgesic choice is also determined by the type of pain: for [[neuropathic pain]], traditional analgesics are less effective, and there is often benefit from classes of drugs that are not normally considered analgesics, such as [[tricyclic antidepressants]] and [[anticonvulsant]]s.<ref name="pmid14623723">{{cite journal |author=Dworkin RH, Backonja M, Rowbotham MC, ''et al.'' |title=Advances in neuropathic pain: diagnosis, mechanisms, and treatment recommendations |journal=Arch.

==Major classes==

===Paracetamol and NSAIDs===
{{Main|Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}}

The exact mechanism of action of [[paracetamol|paracetamol/acetaminophen]] is uncertain but appears to act centrally in the brain rather than peripherally in nerve endings. [[Aspirin]] and the other [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) inhibit [[cyclooxygenase]]s, leading to a decrease in [[prostaglandin]] production.  In contrast to paracetamol and the opioids, this not only reduces pain but [[inflammation]] as well.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Paracetamol has few side effects and is regarded as generally safe, although excess or sustained use can lead to  potentially life-threatening [[paracetamol toxicity|liver damage]] and occasionally [[analgesic nephropathy|kidney damage]]. While paracetamol is usually taken orally or rectally, an intravenous preparation introduced in 2002 has been shown to improve pain relief and reduce opioid consumption in the perioperative setting.

NSAIDs predispose to [[peptic ulcer]]s, [[renal failure]], [[allergy|allergic reactions]], and occasionally [[hearing loss]], and they can increase the risk of [[hemorrhage]] by affecting [[platelet]] function. The use of aspirin in children under 16 suffering from viral illness has been linked to [[Reye's syndrome]], a rare but severe liver disorder.

===COX-2 inhibitors===
{{Main|COX-2 inhibitor}}
These drugs have been derived from NSAIDs.  The [[cyclooxygenase]] enzyme inhibited by NSAIDs was discovered to have at least 2 different versions: COX1 and COX2.  Research suggested that most of the adverse effects of NSAIDs were mediated by blocking the COX1 ([[Constitutive enzyme|constitutive]]) enzyme, with the analgesic effects being mediated by the COX2 ([[Adaptive enzyme|inducible]]) enzyme.  The COX2 inhibitors were thus developed to inhibit only the COX2 enzyme (traditional NSAIDs block both versions in general).  These drugs (such as [[rofecoxib]], [[celecoxib]] and [[etoricoxib]]) are equally effective analgesics when compared with NSAIDs, but cause less gastrointestinal hemorrhage in particular.<ref name=Conaghan2012>{{cite journal |author=Conaghan PG |title=A turbulent decade for NSAIDs: update on current concepts of classification, epidemiology, comparative efficacy, and toxicity |journal=Rheumatol. Int. |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=1491–502 |year=2012 |month=June |pmid=22193214 |pmc=3364420 |doi=10.1007/s00296-011-2263-6 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/851u341753405ukn/fulltext.html}}</ref>

After widespread adoption of the COX-2 inhibitors, it was discovered that most of the drugs in this class increased the risk of cardiovascular events by 40% on average. This led to the withdrawal of rofecoxib and valdecoxib, and warnings on others. Etoricoxib seems relatively safe, with the risk of thrombotic events similar to that of non-coxib NSAID diclofenac.<ref name=Conaghan2012/>

===Opiates and morphinomimetics===
{{Main|Opioid|Opiate}}
[[Morphine]], the [[archetypal]] [[opioid]], and various other substances (e.g. [[codeine]], [[oxycodone]], [[hydrocodone]], [[dihydromorphine]], [[pethidine]]) all exert a similar influence on the [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] [[opioid receptor]] system. [[Buprenorphine]] is thought to be a [[partial agonist]] of the opioid receptor, and [[tramadol]] is an opiate agonist with SNRI properties.{{Citation needed|reason=tramadol|date=February 2009}}  [[Tramadol]] is structurally closer to [[venlafaxine]] than to [[codeine]] and delivers analgesia by not only delivering "opiate-like" effects (through mild agonism of the [[mu receptor]]) but also by acting as a weak but fast-acting [[serotonin releasing agent]] and [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]].<ref name="pmid1596676">{{cite journal | author = Driessen B, Reimann W | title = Interaction of the central analgesic, tramadol, with the uptake and release of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the rat brain in vitro | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 105 | issue = 1 | pages = 147–51 | year = 1992 | month = January | pmid = 1596676 | pmc = 1908625 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1992.tb14226.x| url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid9389855">{{cite journal | author = Bamigbade TA, Davidson C, Langford RM, Stamford JA | title = Actions of tramadol, its enantiomers and principal metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol, on serotonin (5-HT) efflux and uptake in the rat dorsal raphe nucleus | journal = British Journal of Anaesthesia | volume = 79 | issue = 3 | pages = 352–6 | year = 1997 | month = September | pmid = 9389855 | doi = 10.1093/bja/79.3.352| url = http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9389855}}</ref><ref name="pmid9671098">{{cite journal |author=Reimann W, Schneider F |title=Induction of 5-hydroxytryptamine release by tramadol, fenfluramine and reserpine |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |volume=349 |issue=2–3 |pages=199–203 |year=1998 |month=May |pmid=9671098 |doi=10.1016/S0014-2999(98)00195-2}}</ref><ref name="pmid12354291">{{cite journal |author=Gobbi M, Moia M, Pirona L, ''et al.'' |title=p-Methylthioamphetamine and 1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine, two non-neurotoxic 5-HT releasers in vivo, differ from neurotoxic amphetamine derivatives in their mode of action at 5-HT nerve endings in vitro |journal=Journal of Neurochemistry |volume=82 |issue=6 |pages=1435–43 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12354291 |doi=10.1046/j.1471-4159.2002.01073.x}}</ref>  Tapentadol, with some structural similarities to tramadol, presents what is believed to be a novel drug working through two (and possibly three) different modes of action in the fashion of both a traditional opioid and as a SNRI. The effects of serotonin and [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|norepinephrine]] on pain, while not completely understood, have had causal links established and drugs in the SNRI class are commonly used in conjunction with opioids (especially tapentadol and tramadol) with greater success in pain relief. Dosing of all opioids may be limited by opioid toxicity (confusion, respiratory depression, [[myoclonus|myoclonic jerks]] and pinpoint pupils), seizures ([[tramadol]]), but opioid-tolerant individuals usually have higher dose ceilings than patients without tolerance. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Opioids, while very effective analgesics, may have some unpleasant side-effects.  Patients starting morphine may experience [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] (generally relieved by a short course of [[antiemetic]]s such as [[phenergan]]). [[Pruritus]] (itching) may require switching to a different opioid.  [[Constipation]] occurs in almost all patients on opioids, and [[laxative]]s ([[lactulose]], [[macrogol]]-containing or co-danthramer) are typically co-prescribed.<ref name="oxford">Oxford Textbook of Palliative Medicine, 3rd ed. (Doyle D, Hanks G, Cherney I and Calman K, eds. Oxford University Press, 2004).</ref>

When used appropriately, opioids and similar [[narcotic]] analgesics are otherwise safe and effective, however risks such as addiction and the body becoming used to the drug (tolerance) can occur. The effect of tolerance means that frequent use of the drug may result in its diminished effect so, when safe to do so, the dosage may need to be increased to maintain effectiveness. This may be of particular concern regarding patients suffering with chronic pain.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Flupirtine===
[[Flupirtine]] is a centrally acting K+ channel opener with weak NMDA antagonist properties.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 10599868 | volume=106 | issue=9-10 | title=Flupirtine shows functional NMDA receptor antagonism by enhancing Mg2+ block via activation of voltage independent potassium channels.

It has no anticholinergic properties and is believed to be devoid of any activity on dopamine, serotonin or histamine receptors.

Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry | pages=1120–1}}</ref>

===Specific agents===
In patients with chronic or neuropathic pain, various other substances may have analgesic properties.  [[Tricyclic antidepressant]]s, especially [[amitriptyline]], have been shown to improve pain in what appears to be a central manner.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Nefopam is used in Europe for pain relief with concurrent opioids. The exact mechanism of [[carbamazepine]], [[gabapentin]] and [[pregabalin]] is similarly unclear, but these [[anticonvulsant]]s are used to treat neuropathic pain with differing degrees of success. Anticonvulsants are most commonly used for neuropathic pain as their mechanism of action tends to inhibit pain sensation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Drug Treatment in Urology|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, 2008|author=Ian Eardley, Peter Whelan, Roger Kirby, Anthony Schaeffer|page=65|chapter=Drugs Used In The Treatment Of Interstitial Cystitis}}</ref>

==Specific forms and uses==

===Combinations===
Analgesics are frequently used in combination, such as the [[paracetamol]] and [[codeine]] preparations found in many non-prescription pain relievers.  They can also be found in combination with vasoconstrictor drugs such as [[pseudoephedrine]] for [[Paranasal sinus|sinus]]-related preparations, or with [[antihistamine]] drugs for allergy sufferers.

While the use of paracetamol, aspirin, [[ibuprofen]], [[naproxen]] and other [[NSAIDS]] concurrently with weak to mid-range opiates (up to about the hydrocodone level) has been said to show beneficial synergistic effects by combatting pain at multiple sites of action,<ref name="pmid12148679">{{cite journal |author=Mehlisch DR |title=The efficacy of combination analgesic therapy in relieving dental pain |journal=J Am Dent Assoc |volume=133 |issue=7 |pages=861–71 |year=2002 |pmid=12148679 |url=http://jada.ada.org/cgi/content/full/133/7/861 |doi= }}</ref> several combination analgesic products have been shown to have few efficacy benefits when compared to similar doses of their individual components. Moreover, these combination analgesics can often result in significant adverse events, including accidental overdoses, most often due to confusion which arises from the multiple (and often non-acting) components of these combinations.<ref name=nps01>{{cite journal |author=Murnion B |title=Combination analgesics in adults |journal=Australian Prescriber |issue=33 |pages=113–5 |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/4/113/5 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref>

===Topical or systemic===
Topical analgesia is generally recommended to avoid systemic side-effects.  Painful joints, for example, may be treated with an [[ibuprofen]]- or [[diclofenac]]-containing gel; [[capsaicin]] also is used [[topical cream|topical]]ly.  [[Lidocaine]], an [[anesthetic]], and [[glucocorticoid|steroids]] may be injected into painful joints for longer-term pain relief.  [[Lidocaine]] is also used for painful [[mouth sore]]s and to numb areas for [[dentistry|dental]] work and minor medical procedures.

===Psychotropic agents===
[[Tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) and some other [[cannabinoids]], either from the ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' plant or synthetic, have analgesic properties, although the use of cannabis derivatives is currently illegal in many countries. A recent study finds that inhaled cannabis is effective in alleviating neuropathy and pain resulting from e.g. spinal injury and multiple sclerosis.<ref>CMCR: ''CMCR Report February 17th'', California, 2010. http://www.cmcr.ucsd.edu/CMCR_REPORT_FEB17.pdf</ref> 
Other psychotropic analgesic agents include [[ketamine]] (an NMDA receptor antagonist), [[clonidine]] and other α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptor agonists, and [[mexiletine]] and other local anaesthetic analogues.

===Atypical, adjuvant analgesics & potentiators===
Drugs which have been introduced for uses other than analgesics are also used in pain management.  Both first-generation (such as [[amitriptyline]]) and newer anti-depressants (such as [[duloxetine]]) are used alongside NSAIDs and opioids for pain involving nerve damage and similar problems.  Other agents directly potentiate the effects of analgesics, such as using [[hydroxyzine]], [[promethazine]], [[carisoprodol]] or [[tripelennamine]] to increase the pain-killing ability of a given dose of opioid analgesic.

Adjuvant analgesics, also called atypical analgesics, include [[nefopam]], [[orphenadrine]], [[pregabalin]], [[gabapentin]], [[cyclobenzaprine]], [[scopolamine]], and other drugs possessing anticonvulsant, anticholinergic and/or antispasmodic properties, as well as many other drugs with CNS actions. These drugs are used along with analgesics to modulate and/or modify the action of opioids when used against pain, especially of neuropathic origin.

[[Dextromethorphan]] has been noted to slow the development of tolerance to opioids and exert additional analgesia by acting upon the [[NMDA]] receptors; some analgesics such as [[methadone]] and [[ketobemidone]] and perhaps [[piritramide]] have intrinsic NMDA action. 

High-alcohol [[liquor]], two forms of which were in the US Pharmacopoeia up until 1916 and in common use by physicians well into the 1930s, has been used in the past as an agent for dulling pain, due to the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] depressant effects of [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]], a notable example being the [[American Civil War]]. However, the ability of alcohol to relieve severe pain is likely inferior to many analgesics used today (e.g. morphine, codeine). As such, the idea of alcohol for analgesia is generally considered a primitive practice in virtually all industrialized countries today.

The use of [[adjuvant]] analgesics is an important and growing part of the pain-control field and new discoveries are made practically every year.  Many of these drugs combat the side effects of opioid analgesics, an added bonus.  For example, [[antihistamines]] including orphenadrine combat the release of histamine caused by many opioids. Stimulants such as [[methylphenidate]], [[caffeine]], [[ephedrine]], [[dextroamphetamine]], [[methamphetamine]] and [[cocaine]] work against heavy sedation and may elevate mood in distressed patients as do the antidepressants. The use of medicinal [[cannabis]] remains a debated issue.
