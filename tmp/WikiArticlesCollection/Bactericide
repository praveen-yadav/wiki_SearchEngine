A '''bactericide''' or '''bacteriocide''', sometimes abbreviated '''Bcidal''', is a substance that kills [[bacteria]]. Bactericides are [[disinfectant]]s, [[antiseptic]]s, or [[antibiotic]]s.<ref>Klaus Grünewald: ''Theorie der medizinischen Fußbehandlung 1: Ein Fachbuch für Podologie''. 3. Auflage.

==Bactericidal disinfectants==
The most used  [[disinfectant]]s are those applying
*active [[chlorine]] (i.e., [[hypochlorite]]s, [[chloramine]]s, [[sodium dichloroisocyanurate|dichloroisocyanurate]] and [[trichloroisocyanurate]], wet chlorine, [[chlorine dioxide]], etc.),
*active [[oxygen]] ([[peroxide]]s, such as [[peracetic acid]], potassium persulfate, sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate, and urea perhydrate),
*[[iodine]] ([[iodpovidone]] (povidone-iodine, Betadine), [[Lugol's solution]], iodine tincture, iodinated nonionic surfactants),
*concentrated [[alcohols]] (mainly [[ethanol]], [[1-propanol]], called also [[n-propanol]] and [[2-propanol]], called [[isopropanol]] and mixtures thereof; further, [[2-phenoxyethanol]] and 1- and [[2-phenoxypropanol]]s are used),
*[[phenols|phenolic substances]] (such as [[phenol]] (also called "carbolic acid"), [[cresol]]s (called "Lysole" in combination with liquid potassium soaps), halogenated (chlorinated, brominated) phenols, such as [[hexachlorophene]], [[triclosan]], [[trichlorophenol]], [[tribromophenol]], [[pentachlorophenol]], Dibromol and salts thereof),
*[[cationic surfactants]], such as some [[quaternary ammonium cations]] (such as [[benzalkonium chloride]], [[cetyl trimethylammonium bromide]] or chloride, [[didecyldimethylammonium chloride]], [[cetylpyridinium chloride]], [[benzethonium chloride]]) and others, non-quaternary compounds, such as [[chlorhexidine]], [[glucoprotamine]], [[octenidine]] dihydrochloride etc.),
*strong [[oxidizer]]s, such as [[ozone]] and [[permanganate]] solutions;
*[[heavy metals]] and their salts, such as colloidal [[silver]], [[silver nitrate]], [[mercury chloride]]{{dn|date=October 2013}}, [[organomercury|phenylmercury]] salts, [[copper sulfate]], [[copper oxide-chloride]] etc. Heavy metals and their salts are the most toxic and environment-hazardous bactericides and therefore their use is strongly discouraged or prohibited
*properly concentrated strong [[acid]]s (phosphoric, nitric, sulfuric, amidosulfuric, toluenesulfonic acids) and
*[[alkali]]s (sodium, potassium, calcium hydroxides), such as of pH < 1 or > 13, particularly under elevated temperature (above 60°C), kills bacteria.

==Bactericidal antiseptics==
As [[antiseptic]]s (i.e., germicide agents that can be used on human or animal body, skin, mucoses, wounds and the like), few of the above mentioned disinfectants can be used, under proper conditions (mainly concentration, pH, temperature and toxicity toward humans and animals). Among them, some important are
*properly diluted [[chlorine]] preparations (f.e. [[Daquin's solution]], 0.5% sodium or potassium hypochlorite solution, pH-adjusted to pH 7 – 8, or 0.5 – 1% solution of sodium benzenesulfochloramide ([[chloramine]] B)), some
*[[iodine]] preparations, such as [[iodophor|iodopovidone]] in various [[Galenic formulation|galenic]]s (ointment, solutions, wound plasters), in the past also [[Lugol's solution]],
*[[peroxides]] such as urea perhydrate solutions and pH-[[Buffer solution|buffered]] 0.1 – 0.25% peracetic acid solutions,
*[[alcohol]]s with or without antiseptic additives, used mainly for skin antisepsis,
* weak [[organic acids]] such as [[sorbic acid]], [[benzoic acid]], [[lactic acid]] and [[salicylic acid]]
*some [[phenol]]ic compounds, such as [[hexachlorophene]], [[triclosan]] and Dibromol, and
*[[cation-active compounds]], such as 0.05 – 0.5% benzalkonium, 0.5 – 4% [[chlorhexidine]], 0.1 – 2% octenidine solutions.
Others are generally not applicable as safe antiseptics, either because of their [[corrosive]] or [[toxic]] nature.

==Bactericidal antibiotics==
Bactericidal [[antibiotic]]s kill bacteria; [[bacteriostatic]] antibiotics slow their growth or reproduction.

Antibiotics that inhibit cell wall synthesis: the [[Beta-lactam antibiotics]] ([[penicillin]] derivatives ([[penam]]s), [[cephalosporin]]s ([[cephem]]s), [[monobactam]]s, and [[carbapenem]]s) and [[vancomycin]].

Also bactericidal are [[daptomycin]], [[fluoroquinolone]]s, [[metronidazole]], [[nitrofurantoin]], [[co-trimoxazole]], telithromycin.

[[Aminoglycoside|Aminoglycosidic antibiotics]]  are usually considered bactericidal, although they may be bacteriostatic with some organisms
