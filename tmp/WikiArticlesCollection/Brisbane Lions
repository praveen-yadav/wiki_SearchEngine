The '''Brisbane Lions''' is an [[Australian rules football]] club which plays in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL). The club is based in [[Brisbane]], Queensland. The club was formed in 1996 from the merger of the [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy Lions]] and the [[Brisbane Bears]]. Along with {{AFL Gee}}, it is the equal-most successful AFL club of the 21st century, having appeared in four consecutive [[AFL Grand Final]]s from [[2001 AFL season|2001]] to [[2004 AFL season|2004]] and winning three premierships (2001, 2002 and 2003).

The club is based at [[The Gabba]]. The team is captained by [[Jonathan Brown (Australian rules footballer)|Jonathan Brown]] and [[Jed Adcock]] and is currently coached by [[Justin Leppitsch]].

==History: Start of a New Era==
In 1996, the ten-year-old [[Brisbane Bears]] had enjoyed their best season to date, losing a preliminary final to the eventual premiers, [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]].  However, the club was on extremely shaky financial ground and did not have many opportunities to generate revenue.

In contrast, the [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy Lions]], a foundation club of the VFL/AFL, had been among the bottom teams of the league for the better part of the last four decades.  They had finished in last place for two successive seasons, although they contained a number of promising young players.  The club was in serious trouble off the field as well.  It had not had a permanent home since 1966 and had been on the verge of folding as early as 1986.

By the start of the 1996 season, Fitzroy was almost at the end of its financial tether.  The club's directors agreed in principle to merge with [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] as the "North-Fitzroy Kangaroos".  However, that proposal was rejected 15–1 by the AFL Commission, reportedly out of concern that a merged all-Victorian club would be too powerful.  Instead, Fitzroy was placed into administration, and its administrator accepted an offer to merge with Brisbane.  The merged team would be based in Brisbane, and Bears coach [[John Northey]] would become coach of the merged club.  However, it adopted a logo and guernsey based largely on those of Fitzroy.

The Brisbane Lions were officially launched on 1 November 1996, joining the national competition in 1997.

===The Beginning: 1997–2000===
[[File:2006 AFL Brisbane Lions.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Brisbane Lions logo from 2001–2009]]
In their first year as a combined club the Lions made the finals, finishing in eighth position after being defeated by the [[St Kilda Football Club]] in a qualifying final. The following year, however, they finished in last position, despite boasting a talented playing list. Accordingly, Northey was sacked as coach with eight rounds remaining in the season. During the off-season the club hired [[Leigh Matthews]], who in 1990 had delivered Collingwood its first premiership since 1958.

Matthews, who was voted "Player of the Century" in 2000, played his entire career with [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and brought many of the Hawthorn disciplines to the Lions. Within a season the Lions rose from the bottom of the ladder to fourth, before losing to the eventual premiers, the Kangaroos, in a preliminary final.

===Triple premiership success: 2001–2003===
As the Brisbane Lions, the club won its first AFL premiership in the [[2001 AFL Grand Final]], defeating [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] 15.18 (108) to 12.10 (82).<ref>{{cite web| title=AFL Clubs| publisher=AFL| url=http://cms.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/AFL_Clubs.pdf| accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref> Lions utility player [[Shaun Hart]] won the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as best on ground in the [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]].<ref name=GF>{{Cite book| last=Lovett| first=Michael (Chief editor)| title=AFL Record Season Guide| publisher=Geoff Slattery Media Group| year=2010| isbn=978-0-9806274-5-9}}</ref>{{rp|521}} On the morning after winning the flag, the club took the premiership cup to the [[Brunswick Street Oval]] in Fitzroy, the original home of the [[Fitzroy Football Club]]. It was an important way of connecting with Melbourne-based Lions fans, many of whom had previously supported Fitzroy, and of winning over disaffected Fitzroy fans who had not started supporting the Brisbane Lions post-merger by honouring the history of the club. The premiership cup then made its historic first trip to Brisbane, a traditionally [[rugby league]]-focused city.

In the same year, Brisbane Lion (and former Bear) midfielder [[Jason Akermanis]] won the league's highest individual honour, the [[Brownlow Medal]].<ref name=GF/>{{rp|508}}<ref>{{Cite news| last=Mottram| first=Linda| title=Akermanis wins Brownlow medal| publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]| date=25 January 2001| url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s374998.htm| accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref>

In 2002, the Lions won back-to-back premierships when they again defeated Collingwood 9.12 (66) to 10.15 (75) in the [[2002 AFL Grand Final]] in cold and wet conditions at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Early in the contest the Lions lost both ruckman Beau McDonald and utility player Martin Pike (who had already had nine possessions in the first quarter) to injury and had to complete the match with a limited bench. Despite not scoring a goal in the first quarter, the undermanned Lions overcame a spirited Collingwood in the closest grand final in 15 years. Controversy surrounded the awarding of the Norm Smith medal for best player in the grand final to Collingwood captain Nathan Buckley. The voting panel cast its votes 20 minutes before the conclusion of the match. However, Lions captain Michael Voss was dominant in the final quarter to lead his team to victory and many speculated that, had voting taken place at the final siren, Voss may have won the award over Buckley.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/09/29/1033283388725.html|title=AFL needs fine-tuning on medals|first=Rohan |last=Connolly|date=30 September 2002}}</ref> The voting procedure was changed for subsequent grand finals.

In the same year, Brisbane Lions midfielder [[Simon Black]] won the Brownlow Medal for best and fairest player of the 2002 season.<ref name=GF/>{{rp|508}}

In 2002 former Brisbane lawyer Michael Bowers became chief executive officer as part of a move to turn around the club's problematic finances.<ref name=GF/>{{rp|51}}

In 2003, the Brisbane Lions became the first grand finalist in VFL/AFL history to have three Brownlow Medallists in its line-up, the three being 1996 winner Michael Voss,<ref name=GF/>{{rp|508}} 2001 winner Jason Akermanis and 2002 winner Simon Black.

With a number of players under an injury cloud – and having lost to Collingwood in a qualifying final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground three weeks previously – the Lions went into the game as underdogs. However, they sealed their place in history as an AFL dynasty by thrashing the Magpies in cool but sunny conditions. At one stage in the final quarter the Lions led by almost 80 points before relaxing when the match was well and truly won, allowing Collingwood to score the last four goals. The final score of 20.14 (134) to 12.12 (84)<ref name=GF/>{{rp|860}} saw the club become only the fourth in VFL/AFL history to win three consecutive premierships and the first since the creation of the AFL. Simon Black claimed the Norm Smith Medal with a dominant 39 possession match, the most possessions ever gathered by a player in a grand final.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Blake| first=Martin| title=Black right on the ball|work=The Age |location=Australia| date=28 September 2003| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/27/1064083247266.html| accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref>

===Rebuild of the Lions 2nd Generation: 2005–2008===
The Lions had an inconsistent season in 2005 and fell away badly towards the end, losing many games by very large margins. This culminated in a record 139-point defeat at the hands of the [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], whom they previously defeated in Round 1 in a controversial encounter.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} They finished a disappointing eleventh – out of the Finals for only the second time in the club's history. When able to field its strongest line-up, the Lions produced some strong performance reminiscent of its triple Premiership days. However, injuries to [[Justin Leppitsch]], [[Jonathan Brown (Australian rules footballer)|Jonathan Brown]], [[Nigel Lappin]], and the retirements of Premiership players such as [[Marcus Ashcroft]], [[Alastair Lynch]], [[Martin Pike]], [[Shaun Hart]] and [[Craig McRae]] had taken its toll and the club played more first year players than any other side in the competition.

The Lions began the [[2006 AFL Season|2006 season]] optimistically, but injuries again plagued the club, whose players recorded an AFL record total of 200 matches lost to injury for the season.

[[Justin Leppitsch]] was forced to retire through injury and with season ending injuries to prominent players [[Nigel Lappin]], [[Chris M. Scott|Chris Scott]], [[Ashley McGrath]], [[Richard Hadley]], [[Anthony Corrie]] and key ruckman [[Jamie Charman]]. Coach Leigh Matthews was forced to debut an unprecedented number of youngsters and rookies and due to this, the club experienced inconsistent results. While many of the new youngsters displayed great promise, and continued to attack the ball and tackle opponents in typical Brisbane Lions spirit, it became evident during the final few matches that the young Lions were clearly into rebuilding mode. With [[AFL Rising Star]] nominations to [[Michael Rischitelli]], [[Cheynee Stiller]] and [[Matthew Moody]], and the emergence of rookie [[Jason Roe (footballer)|Jason Roe]] among others, the future looks promising, but the realists also know that the rebuilding phase will take a few years.

Despite the young team losing more home games than ever before, and reducing the Gabba's status as a fortress that intimidated opposition teams, the Lions still produced average crowds the equal of the [[National Rugby League|NRL]] Premiership team [[Brisbane Broncos]].

Justin Leppitsch and [[Brad Scott (Australian rules footballer)|Brad Scott]] announced their retirements during the season. A controversial and high-profile feud between the club and [[Jason Akermanis]] divided supporters of the club and received massive publicity, resulting in Akermanis being stood down for the last seven matches of the season by his senior playing peer group, who felt that his loyalty to the club and playing group was compromised.

After the 2006 home and away season it was revealed that major sponsor [[AAPT Limited|AAPT]] would not be renewing their [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]]. It was announced shortly after that [[Vodafone]] had signed a sponsorship deal with the club worth A$5.4&nbsp;million over three years.

The Brisbane Lions team of the decade fullback [[Mal Michael]] announced his retirement from football on 5 October 2006 due to lack of motivation and desire to pursue other non-football related activities. While at the Lions he was one of the premier fullbacks in the AFL and was somewhat unlucky not to receive an [[All-Australian]] honour and was a pivotal figure at the Brisbane Lions, playing a significant role in each of the grand finals contested. In highly controversial circumstances, a contract loophole enabled Michael to sign with the Essendon Bombers and continue his career there.

The captain, [[Michael Voss]], also announced his retirement from football on 6 October 2006 due to the stress placed on his body from years of football and a chronic knee injury. He was the co-captain of the team from 1997 to 2000 with [[Alastair Lynch]] before leading the side for the remainder of his career, including the historic three straight premierships. In his final season of football, Voss still played 21 out of a possible 22 games, missing one game through knee soreness which turned out to be the same knee which led to his retirement.

At the completion of the 2006 season [[Chris L. Johnson|Chris Johnson]] remained as the last ever representative of the Fitzroy Football Club to be playing senior AFL football.

The Brisbane Lions finished runner up in the 2007 [[Australian Football League pre-season competition|NAB Cup]] and then went on to create history by being the first team in the history of the AFL to have five co-captains. They started the season with a convincing 25-point win over [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]], 9.15.(69) to 6.8.(44) and a massive win, after tributes to former captain, [[Michael Voss]], against the [[St Kilda Football Club]], with a 52-point margin.

On 12 May 2007, the Lions marked Leigh Matthews' 200th game in charge of the team against the [[Adelaide Football Club|Crows]].

One week later, on 19 May 2007, against Mal Michael's new team, the Essendon Bombers, the Lions began confidently but eventually succumbed to their biggest loss in season 2007 by a margin of 64 points. The Lions lost to [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] by 33 points at the Gabba in [[2007 AFL season#Round 9 (Indigenous Round)|Round 9]] and drew with [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] at [[Docklands Stadium]] with the final scores 10.13 (73) apiece.

On 7 June 2007 Lions co-captain [[Simon Black]] and former Lions captain [[Michael Voss]] were charged for an assault that allegedly took place on the eve of the 2006 AFL Grand Final.<ref>[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/afl/voss-black-and-gehrig-face-court/2007/06/06/1181089187691.html Voss, Black and Gehrig face court – AFL – Sport – brisbanetimes.com.au<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Against [[Jason Akermanis]]'s new side, the [[Western Bulldogs]], in Round 11, the Lions yet again began confidently, kicking the first two goals of the game before being overrun. The Lions failed to score a goal in the second quarter but came back in the last to reduce the margin to 23 points, holding the Bulldogs goalless in the final term. Akermanis kicked two consecutive goals in the first quarter to take the margin out to 15 and 21 points respectively.

At a rainy [[Kardinia Park (Stadium)|Kardinia Park]] two weeks later, the Lions failed to score a goal in the first half and never looked like coming back, going down to their second biggest loss of the season so far. On 30 June 2007, Brisbane faced [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] and led by seven points at quarter time before being overrun in the second, the Power kicking seven goals to two to led by 19 points at half-time. At three-quarter time, the Lions were down by 28 points and 40 points a few minutes early into the final term before they fought back to level the scores at 105-all courtesy of a [[Jonathan Brown (Australian rules footballer)|Jonathan Brown]] goal from a free kick. A minute later a [[50-metre penalty]] gifted Port Adelaide's Brett Ebert a goal and managed to hold on for a seven-point win.

On 22 July 2007 the Lions faced a struggling [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton Blues]] side who were on the back of a 62-point thrashing to [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]] the previous week. Brisbane kicked 8.5–0.3 in the last quarter, the final margin being 117 points, Brisbane's biggest ever win over Carlton, bettering their 103-point loss to Carlton in Round 10, 1987. Also, gun forward [[Jonathan Brown (Australian rules footballer)|Jonathan Brown]] became the first player in Brisbane Lions/[[Brisbane Bears]] history to kick 10 goals in a match, beating [[Brad Hardie]] ([[1989 VFL season|1989]]) and [[Daniel Bradshaw]] ([[2005 AFL season|2005]]) who both kicked nine goals. This resulted in the sacking of the [[Denis Pagan|opposition coach]] after a run of poor results.In Round 17, the Lions celebrated their return to the Melbourne Cricket Ground with a 93-point defeat of [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]. Jared Brennan played one of the best games in his 54 game career, scoring seven goals and five behinds.

[[Rhan Hooper]] received a three match ban for striking Hawthorn's [[Rick Ladson]], [[Joel Macdonald]] and [[Troy Selwood]] missed the must-win clash against [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]]. Brisbane started off well with [[Richard Hadley]] booting the first goal of the game but poor kicking and too many turnovers saw them trail by 10 points at quarter-time before Jonathan Brown evened the scores at 24-all at half-time. The Lions failed to score a goal in the third time-scoring 0.3 to the Swans' 3.5. However, they jumped straight out of the blocks in the first 3 minutes, with Jonathan Brown putting the Lions in front with his second for the night. But with less than four minutes remaining, [[Brett Kirk]] thought he'd won the game for Sydney only for Jonathan Brown to kick a 55-metre goal just before the full-time siren to secure a 9.9 (63) to 8.15 (63) draw.

The Lions failed to make the finals for a third successive year and lost [[Chris L. Johnson|Chris Johnson]] and [[Chris M. Scott|Chris Scott]] to retirement. Youngster [[Cameron Wood]] was traded to [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] in exchange for Pick 14, which the Lions gave to [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] for [[Travis Johnstone]]. On the last day of the [[2007 AFL Draft#Trades|2007 trade week]], [[Richard Hadley]] was traded to Carlton for pick No. 52.

The Lions began the [[2008 NAB Cup]] shakily, losing to Essendon by 27 points. The 2008 home and away campaign started with a game against the [[West Coast Eagles]] at [[Subiaco Oval]], in which the Lions lost by 16 points. In their second match at home at the Gabba, the Lions wrestled with an in form Collingwood and eventually triumphed by two points. Jed Adcock scored the winning goal for the Lions. After a 17-point loss to the [[Sydney Swans]] the next week (Rivalry Round), the Lions managed a record breaking comeback against [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] after turning around a 47-point deficit half way through the third quarter, to come out winners by 20 points by the final siren. The Lions were then defeated by Hawthorn by 12 points followed by a sound victory over Melbourne by 52 points. They suffered another defeat to Geelong by 27 points followed by the Lions' first consecutive wins for the season with wins over Carlton by 33 points and St Kilda by 46 points. This was followed up by wins over North by 31 points and Fremantle by 22 points. The winning streak would eventually be snapped by a defeat from the Bulldogs by 63 points. The team struggled for the rest of the season and missed out on the finals with a 10–12 record, losing 3 games despite having at least 5 more scoring shots in each of those games. Coach Leigh Matthews resigned at the end of the season after 10 seasons and 3 premierships with the club.

===Voss arrival: 2009–2012===
{{main|2009 Brisbane Lions season|2010 Brisbane Lions season}}

{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}
The Lions made a good start in the [[2009 NAB Cup]] under new senior coach Michael Voss by registering a 9-point win over [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]]. However this was followed by a series of losses in the pre-season to [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]], [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] and [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]]. The Lions then began the Premiership season well with wins against recent premiers the [[West Coast Eagles]] and hoodoo rivals, the [[Sydney Swans]]. However, the Lions lost their strong form against [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] with a loss of 19 points. The Lions went on to make the finals for the first time since 2004; in their elimination final against Carlton at the Gabba they trailed by as much as five goals midway through the final quarter but came back and won by seven points. Their season ended abruptly with a 51-point loss to the [[Western Bulldogs]] the following week at the MCG.

The 2009/2010 off-season was dominated by the arrival of [[Brendan Fevola]] from Carlton, and the hype was focused on Fevola and Jonathan Brown in the sense that the Lions could capitalise on their strong 2009 season. Indeed, the Lions won their first four matches of the 2010 season to be top of the ladder after four rounds, but they would only win three more games after that to crash to a lowly finish by seasons end. One of those wins however, was against eventual premiers {{AFL Col}}.

The Lions' 2010/2011 off-season was disrupted by the sacking of Fevola after just one season at the Lions, following repeated off-field indiscretions which included getting drunk in the Brisbane streets during New Year's Eve celebrations. On the field, the Lions won only four games for the year, but only one against any Victorian team, and that was {{AFL Nor}}, in Round 9. Despite their worst season since 1998, coach [[Michael Voss]] was granted a contract extension after the board recommended that Voss was the best man to take the club forward into the future. Leading into season 2012, only two players from the triple-premiership winning team of 2001–2003 will remain: [[Simon Black]] and [[Jonathan Brown (Australian rules footballer)|Jonathan Brown]].

[[File:FevolaBrisbane.JPG|thumb|[[Brendan Fevola]] became the 1st [[Coleman Medal]]list to win the medal at a club and be traded to another the following year. He originally came from [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]]]]

In the first round, Brisbane defeated [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] by 45 points at the MCG. It showed promising signs for the future, with good performances from [[Jared Polec]], [[Niall McKeever]], [[Matthew Leuenberger]], [[Todd Banfield]], [[Rohan Bewick]] and [[2012 AFL Rising Star|Rising Star]] nominee [[Claye Beams]]. Older players, such as [[Simon Black]], [[Daniel Merrett]], [[Ashley McGrath]], [[Jed Adcock]] and new recruit [[Ben Hudson]] also performed well. Only one change was made for round two, [[Jesse O'Brien (footballer)|Jesse O'Brien]] was included for [[Sam Sheldon]].
The Lions suffered their greatest ever loss at the Gabba in Round 2, losing to [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] by 91 points, with Black breaking his wrist. The following week, the Lions were beaten at the hands of Fremantle by 29 points, with the Lions recording a record low 20 inside 50's for the match since Champion Data began recording these statistics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schmock|first=Nathan|title=Freo up, Lions' record low |url=http://www.afl.com.au/tabid/208/default.aspx?newsid=133066 |accessdate= 23 April 2012}}</ref> Round 4 then saw the Lions claim their second QClash trophy in QClash3 by a monstrous 65 points, which saw [[Jonathan Brown (Australian rules footballer)|Jonathan Brown]] boot his 500th goal for his career. [[Tom Rockliff]] was awarded the Marcus Ashcroft Medal for his 37 possession performance. The Lions then lost against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] in round 5 in [[Simon Black|Black's]] 300th game. The Lions didn't kick a goal in the match until the 20-minute mark of the third quarter.

===Hopes of finals: 2013===
The 2013 season started well for Brisbane, defeating [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in the final of the [[NAB Cup]], with [[Daniel Rich]] winning the Michael Tuck Medal for best on ground and [[Aaron Cornelius]] showing some good form. However, things began to decline from then, with losses to the [[Western Bulldogs]] and [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]]. However, in the 5th [[QClash]] match against [[Gold Coast Suns|Gold Coast]], the Lions won by two points, with [[Jonathan Brown (Australian rules footballer)|Jonathan Brown]] winning the Marcus Ashcroft Medal. Injuries were beginning to take a toll, with young players [[Claye Beams]] and [[Jared Polec]] suffering severe injuries. In Round 13, Brisbane defeated second-placed [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], coming from 52 points down late in the third quarter to win by 5 points due to an [[Ash McGrath]] [[After the siren kicks in Australian rules football|goal after the siren]] in his 200th match.

On 13 August 2013, coach Michael Voss was told that his contract would not be renewed.<ref>http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/brisbane-lions-coach-michael-voss-will-not-be-given-a-new-contract/story-fni5f4q3-1226696515172</ref><ref>http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/afl/afl-news/lions-sack-coach-michael-voss-20130813-2ru9b.html</ref><ref>http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/lions-sack-coach-michael-voss-20130813-2ru9b.html</ref><ref>http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/lions-sack-coach-michael-voss-20130813-2ru9b.html</ref>

On 25 August 2013, former premiership player of the lions Justin Leppitsch was confirmed to be the senior coach of the Lions for the next 3 seasons starting in 2014

On 18 October 2013, Brisbane Lions legend Simon Black announced his retirement.

===Membership base and sponsorship===
Crowds and memberships for the Brisbane Lions grew dramatically during the four seasons in which they made the AFL Grand Final. Since then, with the team being less successful, attendances have declined, but have remained stable over the past three seasons. In 2009 the Lions found it so difficult to sell corporate boxes that they resorted to doing so on a game-by-game basis.<ref>[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/lions-hit-by-fall-in-sales/story-e6frf9jf-1225697726606 Lions hit by fall in corporate box sales] heraldson.com.au.
