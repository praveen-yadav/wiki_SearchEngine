'''Anaxarchus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|ə|ɡ|ˈ|z|ɑr|k|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Ἀνάξαρχος}}; c. 380 – c. 320 BC) was a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[philosopher]] of the school of [[Democritus]]. Together with [[Pyrrho]], he accompanied [[Alexander the Great]] into Asia. The reports of his philosophical views suggest that he was a forerunner of the [[Pyrrhonism|Greek skeptics]].

==Life==
Anaxarchus was born at [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] in [[Thrace]]. He was the companion and friend of [[Alexander the Great]] in his Asiatic campaigns. According to [[Diogenes Laertius]], in response to Alexander's claim to have been the son of Zeus-Ammon, Anaxarchus pointed to his bleeding wound and remarked, "See the blood of a mortal, not [[ichor]], such as flows from the veins of the immortal gods."<ref name="laertius60">Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', ix. 60</ref> Diogenes Laertius also says that [[Nicocreon]], the tyrant of [[Cyprus]], commanded him to be pounded to death in a mortar, and that he endured this torture with fortitude and [[Cicero]] relates the same story.<ref name="laertius58">Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', ix. 58</ref>

[[Plutarch]] tells a story that at [[Bactra]], in 327 BC in a debate with [[Callisthenes]], he advised all to worship Alexander as a god even during his lifetime, is with greater probability attributed to the Sicilian [[Cleon]].

When Alexander was trying to show that he is divine so that the Greeks and Macedonians would perform proskynesis to him, Anaxarchus said that Alexander could "more justly be considered a god than Dionysus or Heracles" (Arrian, 104)

==Philosophy==
Very little is known about his philosophical views. It is thought that he represents a link between the [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]], and the [[Pyrrhonism|skepticism]] of [[Pyrrho]].

Anaxarchus is said to have studied under [[Diogenes of Smyrna]], who in turn studied under [[Metrodorus of Chios]], who used to declare that he knew nothing, not even the fact that he knew nothing.<ref name="laertius58"/> According to [[Sextus Empiricus]], Anaxarchus "compared existing things to a scene-painting and supposed them to resemble the impressions experienced in sleep or madness."<ref>Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Logicians'', 7.88.</ref> It was under the influence of Anaxarchus that Pyrrho is said to have adopted "a most noble philosophy,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. taking the form of agnosticism and suspension of judgement."<ref>Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', ix. 61</ref> Anaxarchus is said to have praised Pyrrho's "indifference and sang-froid."<ref>Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', ix. 63</ref> Anaxarchus is said to have possessed "fortitude and contentment in life," which earned him the epithet ''eudaimonikos'' ("fortunate"),<ref name="laertius60"/> which may imply that he held the end of life to be ''[[eudaimonia]].''
