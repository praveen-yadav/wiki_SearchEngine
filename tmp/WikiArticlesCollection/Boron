'''Boron''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&nbsp;'''B''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;5. Because boron is produced entirely by [[cosmic ray spallation]] and not by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]],<ref>{{cite web| url = http://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=17594|title = Q & A: Where does the element Boron come from?| work=physics.illinois.edu|accessdate = 2011-12-04}}</ref> it is a low-abundance element in both the solar system and the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the [[borate mineral]]s. These are mined industrially as [[evaporite]]s, such as [[borax]] and [[kernite]].

Chemically uncombined boron, which is classed as a [[metalloid]], is not found naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure boron is produced with difficulty, as boron tends to form refractory materials containing small amounts of carbon or other elements. Several [[allotropes of boron]] exist: [[amorphous]] boron is a brown powder and crystalline boron is black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the [[Mohs scale]]), and a poor [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] at room temperature. Elemental boron is used as a [[dopant]] in the [[semiconductor industry]].

The major industrial-scale uses of boron compounds are in [[sodium perborate]] [[bleach]]es, and the borax component of [[fiberglass]] insulation. Boron [[polymers]] and [[ceramic]]s play specialized roles as high-strength lightweight structural and refractory materials. Boron compounds are used in silica-based glasses and ceramics to give them resistance to [[thermal shock]]. Boron-containing [[reagents]] are used as intermediates in the [[organic synthesis|synthesis of organic fine chemicals]]. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used, or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which ([[boron-10]]) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.

In biology, [[borate]]s have low [[toxicity]] in [[mammals]] (similar to [[table salt]]), but are more toxic to [[arthropod]]s and are used as [[insecticides]]. [[Boric acid]] is mildly antimicrobial, and a natural boron-containing organic antibiotic is known.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/antibiotics1968/48/1/48_1_26/_article|title = The tartrolons, new boron-containing antibiotics from a myxobacterium, Sorangium cellulosum.|accessdate = 2013-01-24}}</ref> Boron is essential to life. Small amounts of boron compounds play a strengthening role in the [[cell walls]] of all [[plants]], making boron necessary in soils. Experiments indicate a role for boron as an [[ultratrace element]] in animals, but its role in animal physiology is unknown.

==History and etymology==
The name boron originates from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''{{unicode|بورق }}'' ''buraq'' or the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''{{unicode|بوره}}'' ''burah'';<ref>{{Cite book|title =The Origins of English Words: A Discursive Dictionary of Indo-European Roots|first = Joseph T.|last = Shipley|publisher = JHU Press|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-8018-6784-2|url = http://books.google.com/?id=m1UKpE4YEkEC&pg=PA83}}</ref> which are names for the mineral [[borax]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://web.archive.org/web/20090922221916/http://www.innvista.com/science/chemistry/elements/etymolo.htm|title = Etymology of Elements|publisher = Innvista|accessdate = 2009-06-06}}</ref>

Boron compounds were known thousands of years ago. Borax was known from the deserts of western Tibet, where it received the name of ''tincal'', derived from the [[Sanskrit]]. Borax glazes were used in [[China]] from AD300, and some tincal even reached the West, where the Persian alchemist [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] seems to mention it in AD700. [[Marco Polo]] brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Agricola, around 1600, reports the use of borax as a flux in [[metallurgy]]. In 1777, [[boric acid]] was recognized in the hot springs ([[soffioni]]) near [[Florence]], Italy, and became known as ''sal sedativum'', with mainly medical uses. The rare mineral is called [[sassolite]], which is found at Sasso, [[Italy]]. Sasso was the main source of [[Europe]]an borax from 1827 to 1872, at which date [[United States|American]] sources replaced it.<ref name=borates/><ref name=boron/> Boron compounds were relatively rarely used chemicals until the late 1800s when [[Francis Marion Smith]]'s [[Pacific Coast Borax Company]] first popularized these compounds and made them in volume and hence cheap.<ref>Hildebrand, G. H. (1982) "Borax Pioneer: Francis Marion Smith." San Diego: Howell-North Books. p. 267 ISBN 0-8310-7148-6</ref>

Boron was not recognized as an element until it was isolated by Sir [[Humphry Davy]]<ref name="Davy">{{cite journal|author = Davy H|year = 1809|title = An account of some new analytical researches on the nature of certain bodies, particularly the alkalies, phosphorus, sulphur, carbonaceous matter, and the acids hitherto undecomposed: with some general observations on chemical theory|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA140#v=onepage&q&f=false|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume = 99|pages = 33–104|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1809.0005}}</ref> and by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and [[Louis Jacques Thénard]].<ref name="Lussac">Gay Lussac, J.L. and Thenard, L.J.

Boron is similar to [[carbon]] in its capability to form stable [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] molecular networks.

===Chemistry of the element===
{{Category see also|Boron compounds}}
Elemental boron is rare and poorly studied because the material is extremely difficult to prepare. Most studies on "boron" involve samples that contain small amounts of carbon. Chemically, boron behaves more similarly to [[silicon]] than to [[aluminium]]. Crystalline boron is chemically inert and resistant to attack by boiling [[hydrofluoric acid|hydrofluoric]] or [[hydrochloric acid]]. When finely divided, it is attacked slowly by hot concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide]], hot concentrated [[nitric acid]], hot [[sulfuric acid]] or hot mixture of sulfuric and [[chromic acid]]s.<ref name="Laubengayer">{{Cite journal|title = Boron.

L.|issue = 10}}</ref>

The rate of oxidation of boron depends upon the crystallinity, particle size, purity and temperature. Boron does not react with air at room temperature, but at higher temperatures it burns to form [[boron trioxide]]:<ref name="HollemanAF">{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 814–864|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman|coauthors = Wiberg, Egon; Wiberg, Nils;|chapter = Bor| language = German}}</ref>

Boron atoms are pink, with bridging oxygens in red, and four hydroxyl hydrogens in white. Note two borons are trigonally bonded sp<sup>2</sup> with no formal charge, while the other two borons are tetrahedrally bonded sp<sup>3</sup>, each carrying a formal charge of −1. The oxidation state of all borons is III. This mixture of boron coordination numbers and formal charges is characteristic of natural boron minerals.]]

Boron undergoes halogenation to give trihalides, for example,
:2 B + 3 Br<sub>2</sub> → 2 BBr<sub>3</sub>
The trichloride in practice is usually made from the oxide.<ref name="HollemanAF"/>

====Chemical compounds====
[[File:Boron-trifluoride-pi-bonding-2D.png|100px|thumb|[[Boron trifluoride|Boron (III) trifluoride]] structure, showing "empty" boron p orbital in pi-type [[coordinate covalent bond]]s]]
In its most familiar compounds, boron has the formal oxidation state III. These include oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and halides.<ref name="HollemanAF"/>

The trihalides adopt a planar trigonal structure. These compounds are [[Lewis acid]]s in that they readily form [[adduct]]s with electron-pair donors, which are called [[Lewis base]]s. For example, fluoride (F<sup>−</sup>) and [[boron trifluoride]] (BF<sub>3</sub>) combined to give the [[tetrafluoroborate]] anion, BF<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>. Boron trifluoride is used in the petrochemical industry as a catalyst. The halides react with water to form [[boric acid]].<ref name="HollemanAF"/>

Boron is found in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often associated with other elements. More than one hundred [[borate mineral]]s contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral [[borax]], shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate centers is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) in borax.<ref name="HollemanAF"/>

{{Main|Boranes}}

Boranes are chemical compounds of boron and hydrogen, with the generic formula of B<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y</sub>. These compounds do not occur in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, some violently. The parent member BH<sub>3</sub> is called borane, but it is known only in the gaseous state, and dimerises to form diborane, B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral, some of which exist as isomers. For example, isomers of B<sub>20</sub>H<sub>26</sub> are based on the fusion of two 10-atom clusters.

The most important boranes are diborane B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and two of its pyrolysis products, pentaborane B<sub>5</sub>H<sub>9</sub> and decaborane B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>. A large number of anionic boron hydrides are known, e.g. [B<sub>12</sub>H<sub>12</sub>]<sup>2−</sup>.

The formal [[oxidation number]] in boranes is positive, and is based on the assumption that hydrogen is counted as −1 as in active metal hydrides. The mean oxidation number for the borons is then simply the ratio of hydrogen to boron in the molecule. For example, in diborane B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, the boron oxidation state is +3, but in decaborane B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>, it is <sup>7</sup>/<sub>5</sub> or +1.4. In these compounds the oxidation state of boron is often not a whole number.

{{main|Boron nitride}}

The [[boron nitride]]s are notable for the variety of structures that they adopt. They adopt structures analogous to various [[allotropes of carbon]], including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the diamond-like structure called cubic boron nitride (tradename [[Borazon]]), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds can be viewed as a [[coordinate covalent bond]], wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the [[Lewis base]] to a bond to the [[Lewis acid]]ic boron(III) centre. Cubic boron nitride, among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogue of graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the positively-charged boron and negatively-charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane. Consequently graphite and h-BN have very different properties, although both are lubricants, as these planes slip past each other easily. However, h-BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions.<ref name=dkg>{{cite journal| title = Hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) – Applications from Metallurgy to Cosmetics| url = http://www.esk.com/uploads/tx_userjspresseveroeff/PR_0712_CFI_12-2007_Hexagonales-BN_e_01.pdf| author =Engler, M. | journal = Cfi/Ber.

=====Organoboron chemistry=====
{{Main|Organoboron chemistry}}
A large number of organoboron compounds are known and many are useful in [[organic synthesis]]. Many are produced from [[hydroboration–oxidation reaction|hydroboration]], which employs [[diborane]],  B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, a simple [[borane]] chemical. Organoboron(III) compounds are usually tetrahedral or trigonal planar, for example, [[tetraphenylborate]], [B(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>-</sup> vs [[triphenylborane]], B(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>. However, multiple boron atoms reacting with each other have a tendency to form novel dodecahedral (12-sided) and icosahedral (20-sided) structures composed completely of boron atoms, or with varying numbers of carbon heteroatoms.

Organoboron chemicals have been employed in uses as diverse as [[boron carbide]] (see below), a complex very hard ceramic composed of boron-carbon cluster anions and cations, to [[carborane]]s, carbon-boron [[cluster chemistry]] compounds that can be halogenated to form reactive structures including [[carborane acid]], a [[superacid]]. As one example, carboranes form useful molecular moieties that add considerable amounts of boron to other biochemicals in order to synthesize boron-containing compounds for [[boron neutron capture therapy]] of cancer.

=====Compounds of B(I) and B(II)=====
Although these are not found on Earth naturally, boron forms a variety of stable compounds with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in [[borane|boron hydrides]] and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N<sub>2</sub>, is not isolable in condensed form, but [[diboron tetrafluoride|B<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>]] and B<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub> are well characterized.<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd}}</ref>
[[File:Magnesium-diboride-3D-balls.png|thumb|Ball-and-stick model of superconductor magnesium diboride. Boron atoms lie in hexagonal aromatic graphite-like layers, with a charge of −1 on each boron atom. Magnesium (II) ions lie between layers]]
Binary metal-boron compounds, the metal borides, contain boron in oxidation state less than III. Illustrative is [[magnesium diboride]] (MgB<sub>2</sub>). Each boron atom has a formal −1 charge and magnesium is assigned a formal charge of 2+.
In this material, the boron centers are trigonal planar, with an extra double bond for each boron, with the boron atoms forming sheets akin to the carbon in [[graphite]]. However, unlike the case with hexagonal boron nitride which by comparison lacks electrons in the plane of the covalent atoms, the delocalized electrons in the plane of magnesium diboride allow it to conduct electricity similar to isoelectronic graphite.

From the structural perspective, the most distinctive chemical compounds of boron are the hydrides. Included in this series are the cluster compounds [[dodecaborate]] (B<sub>12</sub>H<sub>12</sub><sup>2-</sup>), [[decaborane]] (B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>), and the [[carborane]]s such as C<sub>2</sub>B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>12</sub>. Characteristically such compounds contain boron with coordination numbers greater than four.<ref name="HollemanAF"/>

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of boron}}
Boron has two naturally occurring and stable [[isotope]]s, <sup>11</sup>B (80.1%) and <sup>10</sup>B (19.9%). The mass difference results in a wide range of δ<sup>11</sup>B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the <sup>11</sup>B and <sup>10</sup>B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is <sup>7</sup>B which decays through [[proton emission]] and [[alpha decay]]. It has a [[half-life]] of 3.5×10<sup>−22</sup> [[second|s]]. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH)<sub>3</sub> and [[tetrahydroxyborate|[B(OH)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>−</sup>]]. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H<sub>2</sub>O phase changes in [[hydrothermal]] systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of [[rock (geology)|rock]]. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the [<sup>10</sup>B(OH)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>−</sup> [[ion]] onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in <sup>11</sup>B(OH)<sub>3</sub> and therefore may be responsible for the large <sup>11</sup>B enrichment in seawater relative to both [[ocean]]ic crust and [[continent]]al crust; this difference may act as an [[isotopic signature]].<ref>{{Cite journal| first = S.|last = Barth| title = Boron isotopic analysis of natural fresh and saline waters by negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry| journal = Chemical Geology| volume = 143|year = 1997|pages = 255–261|doi = 10.1016/S0009-2541(97)00107-1| issue = 3–4}}</ref> The exotic <sup>17</sup>B exhibits a [[nuclear halo]], i.e. its radius is appreciably larger than that predicted by the [[semi-empirical mass formula|liquid drop model]].<ref>{{Cite journal| title = Two-body and three-body halo nuclei| first = Z.|last = Liu|journal = Science China Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy| volume = 46| year= 2003| page = 441|doi = 10.1360/03yw0027| issue = 4|bibcode = 2003ScChG..46..441L}}</ref>

The <sup>10</sup>B isotope is good at capturing [[thermal neutron]]s (see [[neutron cross section#Typical cross sections]]). Natural boron is about 20% <sup>10</sup>B and 80% <sup>11</sup>B. The [[nuclear power|nuclear industry]] enriches natural boron to nearly pure <sup>10</sup>B. The less-valuable by-product, depleted boron, is nearly pure <sup>11</sup>B.

====Commercial isotope enrichment====
Because of its high neutron cross-section, boron-10 is often used to control fission in nuclear reactors as a neutron-capturing substance.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://web.archive.org/web/20110719031833/http://bibliothek.fzk.de/zb/berichte/FZKA6746.pdf|title = Results of the B4C Control Rod Test QUENCH-07|work=Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe in der Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft|year= 2004|author=Steinbrück, Martin }}</ref> Several industrial-scale enrichment processes have been developed, however only the fractionated vacuum distillation of the [[dimethyl ether]] adduct of [[boron trifluoride]] (DME-BF<sub>3</sub>) and column chromatography of borates are being used.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://library.igcar.gov.in/html/Contents/IGCNewsletter/nl48/A2.htm|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20081208114410/http://library.igcar.gov.in/html/Contents/IGCNewsletter/nl48/A2.htm|archivedate = 8 December 2008|title = Commissioning of Boron Enrichment Plant|publisher = Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research|accessdate = 2008-09-21}}</ref><ref>see {{cite journal|doi = 10.1080/01496398608056140|title = Chromatographic Enrichment of 10B by Using Weak-Base Anion-Exchange Resin|year = 1986|last1 = Aida|first1 = Masao|last2 = Fujii|first2 = Yasuhiko|last3 = Okamoto|first3 = Makoto|journal = Separation Science and Technology|volume = 21|issue = 6|pages = 643–654}} showing an enrichment from 18% to above 94%.</ref>

Enriched boron or <sup>10</sup>B is used in both radiation shielding and is the primary nuclide used in [[neutron capture therapy of cancer]]. In the latter ("boron neutron capture therapy" or BNCT), a compound containing <sup>10</sup>B is incorporated into a pharmaceutical which is selectively taken up by a malignant tumor and tissues near it. The patient is then treated with a beam of low energy neutrons at a relatively low neutron radiation dose. The neutrons, however, trigger energetic and short-range secondary [[alpha particle]] and lithium-7 heavy ion radiation that are products of the boron + neutron [[nuclear reaction]], and this ion radiation additionally bombards the tumor, especially from inside the tumor cells.<ref>{{Cite journal|title =A Critical Assessment of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy: An Overview|journal = Journal of Neuro-Oncology|volume = 62|issue = 1|year = 2003|doi = 10.1023/A:1023262817500|pages = 1–5|first = Rolf F.|last = Barth}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|journal = Radiation Research|pages = 1–18|volume =151| issue =1|year = 1999|title =The Radiation Biology of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy|first = Jeffrey A.|last = Coderre|doi = 10.2307/3579742|pmid = 9973079|last2 = Morris|first2 = GM|jstor = 3579742}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Boron Neutron Capture Therapy of Cancer|first =Rolf F.|last =Barth|journal = Cancer Research|volume = 50|pages = 1061–1070|date=15 February 1990|pmid = 2404588|issue = 4|author2 = S|author3 = F}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmainfo.net/reviews/boron-neutron-capture-therapy-overview |title=Boron Neutron Capture Therapy – An Overview |publisher=Pharmainfo.net |date=22 August 2006 |accessdate=2011-11-07}}</ref>

In nuclear reactors, <sup>10</sup>B is used for reactivity control and in [[scram|emergency shutdown systems]]. It can serve either function in the form of [[borosilicate]] [[control rods]] or as [[boric acid]]. In [[pressurized water reactor]]s, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as [[fissile]] material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.<ref name=reactor>{{Cite book|last = Duderstadt|first = James J.|coauthors = Hamilton, Louis J.| title = Nuclear Reactor Analysis|publisher = Wiley-Interscience|year = 1976|isbn = 0-471-22363-8|page= 245}}</ref>

In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, <sup>10</sup>B has a theoretical role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN [[inorganic nanotube|nanotube]] material) which would also serve a special role in the radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with [[cosmic rays]], which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy [[spallation]] neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as [[polyethylene]], but the moderated neutrons continue to be a radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, <sup>6</sup>Li and <sup>10</sup>B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.<ref>{{cite journal|author= J. Yu| title = Isotopically Enriched 10BN Nanotubes| journal=Advanced Materials| volume =18|year =2006| url =http://www.rsphysse.anu.edu.au/nanotube/pdf/B10Nnanotubes.pdf | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20080803192520/http://www.rsphysse.anu.edu.au/nanotube/pdf/B10Nnanotubes.pdf | archivedate =3 August 2008 |doi =10.1002/adma.200600231|page= 2157|last2= Chen|first2= Y.|last3= Elliman|first3= R. G.|last4= Petravic|first4= M.|issue= 16}}</ref>

====Depleted boron (boron-11)====
[[Cosmic radiation]] will produce secondary neutrons if it hits spacecraft structures. Those neutrons will be captured in <sup>10</sup>B, if it is present in the spacecraft's [[semiconductor]]s, producing a [[gamma ray]], an [[alpha particle]], and a [[lithium]] ion. These resultant decay products may then irradiate nearby semiconductor 'chip' structures, causing data loss (bit flipping, or [[single event upset]]). In [[radiation hardened]] semiconductor designs, one countermeasure is to use '''depleted boron''' which is greatly enriched in <sup>11</sup>B and contains almost no <sup>10</sup>B. <sup>11</sup>B is largely immune to radiation damage. Depleted boron is a by-product of the [[nuclear power|nuclear industry]].<ref name=reactor/>

<sup>11</sup>B is also a candidate as a fuel for [[aneutronic fusion]]. When struck by a proton with energy of about 500&nbsp;k[[electronvolt|eV]], it produces three alpha particles and 8.7&nbsp;MeV of energy. Most other fusion reactions involving hydrogen and helium produce penetrating neutron radiation, which weakens reactor structures and induces long term radioactivity thereby endangering operating personnel. Whereas, the [[alpha particles]] from <sup>11</sup>B fusion can be turned directly into electric power, and all radiation stops as soon as the reactor is turned off.<ref>{{Cite journal|first = W. M.|last = Nevins|title = A Review of Confinement Requirements for Advanced Fuels|journal = Journal of Fusion Energy|volume = 17|issue = 1|year = 1998|doi = 10.1023/A:1022513215080|pages = 25–32|bibcode = 1998JFuE...17...25N }}</ref>

====NMR spectroscopy====
Both <sup>10</sup>B and <sup>11</sup>B possess [[nuclear spin]]. The nuclear spin of <sup>10</sup>B is 3 and that of <sup>11</sup>B is 3/2. These isotopes are, therefore, of use in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscopy; and spectrometers specially adapted to detecting the boron-11 nuclei are available commercially. The <sup>10</sup>B and <sup>11</sup>B nuclei also cause splitting in the [[resonances]] of attached nuclei.<ref>{{cite web| title = Boron NMR| url = http://rmn.iqfr.csic.es/guide/eNMR/chem/B.html| accessdate= 2009-05-05|publisher = BRUKER Biospin| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090502140944/http://rmn.iqfr.csic.es/guide/eNMR/chem/B.html <!--Added by H3llBot-->| archivedate = 2 May 2009}}</ref>

==Production==<!--about making elemental boron (purely an academic endeavor) -->
The production of boron compounds does not involve formation of elemental boron, but exploits the convenient availability of borates.

The earliest routes to elemental boron involved reduction of [[boric oxide]] with metals such as [[magnesium]] or [[aluminium]]. However the product is almost always contaminated with metal [[boride]]s. Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with [[hydrogen]] at high temperatures. Ultrapure boron for use in the semiconductor industry is produced by the decomposition of [[diborane]] at high temperatures and then further purified with the [[zone melting]] or [[Czochralski process]]es.<ref name=berger>{{Cite book| title = Semiconductor materials| author = Berger, L. I.|publisher = CRC Press| year = 1996| isbn = 0-8493-8912-7| pages = 37–43}}</ref>

===Market trend===
Estimated global consumption of boron rose to a record 1.8&nbsp;million tonnes of B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in 2005, following a period of strong growth in demand from Asia, Europe and North America. Boron mining and refining capacities are considered to be adequate to meet expected levels of growth through the next decade.

The form in which boron is consumed has changed in recent years. The use of ores like [[colemanite]] has declined following concerns over [[arsenic]] content. Consumers have moved towards the use of refined borates and boric acid that have a lower pollutant content. The average cost of crystalline boron is $5/g.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.rareearth.org/boron_properties.htm |publisher = Los Alamos National Laboratory|title = Boron Properties|accessdate = 2008-09-18}}</ref>

Increasing demand for boric acid has led a number of producers to invest in additional capacity. Eti Mine Company of Turkey opened a new boric acid plant with the production capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year at [[Emet]] in 2003. [[Rio Tinto Group]] increased the capacity of its boron plant from 260,000 tonnes per year in 2003 to 310,000 tonnes per year by May 2005, with plans to grow this to 366,000 tonnes per year in 2006. Chinese boron producers have been unable to meet rapidly growing demand for high quality borates. This has led to imports of sodium tetraborate ([[borax]]) growing by a hundredfold between 2000 and 2005 and boric acid imports increasing by 28% per year over the same period.<ref name=roskill>{{Cite book| title = The Economics of Boron, 11th edition| year = 2006| isbn = 0-86214-516-3| publisher = Roskill Information Services, Ltd.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ceramicindustry.com/Articles/Cover_Story/4b0b7a6ed1cb8010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0____| accessdate = 2009-05-05| title = Raw and Manufactured Materials 2006 Overview}}</ref>

The rise in global demand has been driven by high growth rates in [[glass (fiber)|fiberglass]] and [[borosilicate]] production. A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Asia with a consequent increase in demand for borates has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.<ref name=roskill/><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.roskill.com/reports/boron| title = Roskill reports: boron|publisher = Roskill|accessdate = 2009-05-05}}</ref>

===Magnets===
Boron is a component of [[neodymium magnet]]s (Nd<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>14</sub>B), which are among the strongest type of permanent magnet. These magnets are found in a variety of electromechanical and electronic devices, such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) medical imaging systems, in compact and relatively small motors and [[actuator]]s.  As examples, computer HDDs (hard disk drives), CD (compact disk) and DVD (digital video disk) players rely on neodymium magnet motors to deliver intense rotary power in a remarkably compact package.   In mobile phones 'Neo' magnets provide the magnetic field which allows tiny speakers to deliver appreciable audio power.<ref name=magnet>{{Cite book|page=45|title=Permanent magnet materials and their application| first = Peter|last = Campbell| publisher =Cambridge University Press| year= 1996| isbn=0-521-56688-6}}</ref>

===High-hardness and abrasive compounds===
{{Main|Superhard materials}}
[[File:Bodyarmor.jpg|thumb|upright|Boron carbide is used for inner plates of [[ballistic vest]]s]]
Several boron compounds are known for their extreme hardness and toughness.

Boron carbide and cubic boron nitride powders are widely used as abrasives. Metal [[boride]]s are used for coating tools through [[chemical vapor deposition]] or [[physical vapor deposition]]. Implantation of boron ions into metals and alloys, through [[ion implantation]] or [[ion beam deposition]], results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and microhardness. Laser alloying has also been successfully used for the same purpose. These borides are an alternative to diamond coated tools, and their (treated) surfaces have similar properties to those of the bulk boride.<ref>{{Cite book| title = Materials Science of Carbides, Nitrides and Borides| author = Gogotsi, Y.

====Boron carbide====
{{main|boron carbide}}
[[Boron carbide]] is a ceramic material which is obtained by decomposing B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with carbon in the electric furnace:
:2 B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 7 C → B<sub>4</sub>C + 6 CO

Boron carbide's structure is only approximately B<sub>4</sub>C, and it shows a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with [[empirical formula]] B<sub>12</sub>C<sub>3</sub> (i.e., with B<sub>12</sub> dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon as the suggested C<sub>3</sub> units are replaced with B-C chains, and there are smaller (B<sub>6</sub>) octahedra present as well. (See the article for structural analysis).

The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in [[vehicle armour|tank armor]], [[bulletproof vest]]s, and numerous other structural applications.

Boron carbide's ability to absorb neutrons without forming long-lived [[radionuclide]]s (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, to increase its surface area.<ref>{{Cite book| first = Alan W.|last = Weimer| title = Carbide, Nitride and Boride Materials Synthesis and Processing| isbn = 0-412-54060-6| year = 1997| publisher = Chapman & Hall (London, New York)}}</ref>

As usual, it is not an element that is intrinsically poisonous, but toxicity depends on structure.<ref name=borates>{{Cite book|pages=102; 385–386|title=Borates: handbook of deposits, processing, properties, and use| author = Garrett, Donald E.| publisher =Academic Press| year= 1998| isbn=0-12-276060-3}}</ref><ref name=boron>{{cite web| accessdate= 2009-05-05| url = http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/boron.htm| title = Boron|work=University of Denver|author=Calvert, J.

The boranes are toxic as well as highly [[flammable]] and require special care when handling. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard due to its reducing nature, and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc204.htm|title = Environmental Health Criteria 204: Boron|year = 1998| publisher = the [[International Programme on Chemical Safety|IPCS]]| accessdate= 2009-05-05}}</ref>
