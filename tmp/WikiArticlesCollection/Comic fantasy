{{Fantasy}}
'''Comic fantasy''' is a subgenre of [[fantasy]] that is primarily humorous in intent and tone. Usually set in imaginary worlds, comic fantasy often includes puns on and parodies of other works of fantasy. It is sometimes known as [[low fantasy]] in contrast to [[high fantasy]], which is primarily serious in intent and tone.  The term "low fantasy" is used to represent other types of fantasy, however, so while comic fantasies may also correctly be classified as low fantasy, many examples of low fantasy are not comic in nature.

==History==
The subgenre rose in the nineteenth century. Elements of comic fantasy can be found in such nineteenth century works
as some of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s fairy tales, [[Charles Dickens]]' "Christmas Books", and [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] books.<ref name="pringle">"Humourous Fantasy" in [[David Pringle]],ed, ''The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', (pp.31-33). London, Carlton,2006. ISBN 1-84442-110-4</ref> The first writer to specialize in the sub-genre was "[[Thomas Anstey Guthrie|F. Anstey]]" in novels such as ''[[Vice Versa (novel)|Vice Versa]]'' (1882), where magic disrupts Victorian society with humorous results.<ref name="pringle" /> Anstey's work was popular enough to inspire several imitations, including [[E. Nesbit|E. Nesbit's]] light-hearted children's fantasies, ''[[The Phoenix and the Carpet]]'' (1904) and ''[[The Story of the Amulet]]'' (1906).<ref name="pringle" /> The United States had several writers of comic fantasy, including [[James Branch Cabell]], whose satirical fantasy ''[[Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice]]'' (1919) was the subject of an unsuccessful prosecution for obscenity.<ref>Edgar MacDonald, "James Branch Cabell" in [[E. F. Bleiler]], ed.''Supernatural Fiction Writers'' (pp. .789-796).New York: Scribner's, 1985.  ISBN 0-684-17808-7</ref> 
Another American writer in a similar vein was [[Thorne Smith]],whose works (such as ''[[Topper (novel series)|Topper]]'' and ''The Night Life of the Gods'') were popular and influential, and often adapted for film and television.<ref>Keith Neilson, "Thorne Smith" in Bleiler, ed.''Supernatural Fiction Writers''. (pp. 805-812),1985.</ref>
Humourous fantasies narrated in a "gentleman's club" setting are common; they include [[John Kendrick Bangs]]' ''A Houseboat on the Styx'' (1895), [[Lord Dunsany|Lord Dunsany's]] "[[Joseph Jorkens|Jorkens]]" stories, and [[Maurice Richardson|Maurice Richardson's]] 
''The Exploits of Englebrecht'' (1950). <ref>[[David Langford]], "Humor", in

According to [[Lin Carter]], [[T. H. White]]'s works exemplify comic fantasy,<ref>Lin Carter, ed. ''Kingdoms of Sorcery'', p 121–2. Doubleday and Company Garden City, NY, 1976.</ref>  [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Fletcher Pratt]]'s [[Harold Shea]] stories are early exemplars.  The overwhelming bulk of de Camp's fantasy was comic.<ref>Carter. ''Kingdoms of Sorcery''.</ref> Pratt and de Camp were among several contributors to ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown Worlds]]'', a [[pulp magazine]] which emphasized fantasy with a comedic element. The work of [[Fritz Leiber]] also appeared in ''Unknown Worlds'', including his [[Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser]] stories, a jocose take on the [[sword and sorcery]] subgenre.<ref name="pringle" />

In more modern times, [[Piers Anthony]]'s ''[[Xanth]]'' books, [[Robert Asprin]]'s ''[[MythAdventures]]'' of Skeeve and Aahz books, [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'', and [[Tom Holt]]'s books provide good examples,<ref name="pringle" /> as do many of the works by [[Christopher Moore (author)|Christopher Moore]]. There are also comic-strips/graphic novels in the humorous fantasy genre, including [[Chuck Whelon]]'s Pewfell series and the webcomics ''[[8-Bit Theater]]'' and ''[[The Order of the Stick]]''. Other recent authors in the genre include Toby Frost, Stuart Sharp, Nicholas Andrews, and DC Farmer, and the writing team of John P. Logsdon and Christopher P. Young.
==Television==
The subgenre has also been represented in [[Fantasy television|television]], such as in the television series ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', ''[[Kröd Mändoon]]''.
==Radio== 
Examples on radio are the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Hordes of the Things (radio series)|Hordes of the Things]]'' and ''[[ElvenQuest]]''.
==Film==
Comic fantasy films can either be parodies ([[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]), comedies with fantastical elements ([[Being John Malkovitch]]) or animated ([[Shrek]]).
