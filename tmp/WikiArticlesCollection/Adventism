{{Adventism}}

'''Adventism''' is a [[Christianity|Christian]] movement which began in the 19th century, in the context of the [[Second Great Awakening]] revival in the [[United States]]. The name refers to belief in the imminent [[Second Coming of Christ|Second Coming (or "Second Advent") of Jesus Christ]]. It was started by [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]], whose followers became known as [[Millerism|Millerites]]. Today, the largest church within the movement is the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].

The Adventist family of churches are regarded today as conservative [[Protestant]]s.<ref name="Handbook">"Adventist and Sabbatarian (Hebraic) Churches" section (p. 256–276) in Frank S. Mead, Samuel S. Hill and Craig D. Atwood, ''Handbook of Denominations in the United States'', 12th edn. Nashville: Abingdon Press</ref> Although they hold much in common, their [[Christian theology|theology]] differs on whether the [[intermediate state]] is [[Soul sleep|unconscious sleep]] or consciousness, whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is [[annihilationism|annihilation]] or eternal torment, the nature of immortality, whether or not the wicked are resurrected after the millennium, and whether the sanctuary of {{bibleverse||Daniel|8|NKJV}} refers to the one in [[heavenly sanctuary|heaven]] or one on earth.<ref name="Handbook"/> The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole [[Bible]], leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the [[Sabbath in Seventh-day Adventism|Sabbath]].

==History==
{{See also|Millerites|Great Disappointment}}

Adventism began as an inter-denominational movement. Its most vocal leader was William Miller. Between 50,000 and 100,000 people in the United States supported Miller's predictions of Christ's return. After the "[[Great Disappointment]]" of October 22, 1844 many people in the movement gave up on Adventism.  Of those remaining Adventist, the majority gave up believing in any prophetic (biblical) significance for the October 22 date, yet they remained expectant of the near Advent ([[second coming]] of Jesus).<ref name="Handbook"/><ref>George Knight, ''A Brief History of Seventh-day Adventists</ref>

Of those who retained the October 22 date, many maintained that Jesus had come not literally but "spiritually", and consequently were known as "spiritualizers". A small minority held that something concrete had indeed happened on October 22, but this event had been misinterpreted. This viewpoint later emerged and crystallized with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the largest remaining body today.<ref name="Handbook"/><ref>George Knight, ''A Brief History of Seventh-day Adventists</ref><!-- did any continue setting dates? A small minority only? -->

===Albany Conference (1845)===
The Albany Conference in 1845, attended by 61 delegates, was called to attempt to determine the future course and meaning of the Millerite movement. Following this meeting, the "Millerites" then became known as "Adventists" or "Second Adventists". However, the delegates disagreed on several theological points.  Four groups emerged from the conference: The Evangelical Adventists, The Life and Advent Union, the [[Advent Christian Church]], and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].

The largest group was organized as the American Millennial Association, a portion of which was later known as the Evangelical Adventist Church.<ref name="Handbook"/> Unique among the Adventists, they believed in an eternal hell and consciousness in death. They declined in numbers, and by 1916 their name did not appear in the United States Census of Religious Bodies. It has diminished to almost non-existence today. Their main publication was the ''Advent Herald'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adventistarchives.org/documents.asp?CatID=146&SortBy=1&ShowDateOrder=True |title=partial archives |publisher=Adventistarchives.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref> of which [[Sylvester Bliss]] was the editor until his death in 1863. It was later called the ''Messiah’s Herald''. 

The Life and Advent Union was founded by [[George Storrs]] in 1863. He had established ''The Bible Examiner'' in 1842. It merged with the Adventist Christian Church in 1964. 

The [[Advent Christian Church]] officially formed in 1861, and grew rapidly at first. It declined a little during the 20th century.  The Advent Christians publish the four magazines ''The Advent Christian Witness'', ''Advent Christian News'', ''Advent Christian Missions'' and ''Maranatha''. They also operate a liberal arts college at Aurora, Illinois; and a one year Bible College in Lenox, Massachusetts called Berkshire Institute for Christian Studies.<ref>[http://www.berkshireinstitute.org/ berkshireinstitute.org]</ref>  The Primitive Advent Christian Church later separated from a few congregations in West Virginia.

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] officially formed in 1863.  It believes in the sanctity of the seventh-day Sabbath as a holy day for worship.  It published the ''Adventist Review and Sabbath Herald''.  It has grown to a large worldwide denomination and has a significant network of medical and educational institutions.

Miller did not join any of the movements, and he spent the last few years of his life working for unity, before dying in 1849.

==Denominations==

===Advent Christian Church===
{{Main|Advent Christian Church}} 
The '''Advent Christian Church''' was founded in 1860 and had 25,277 members in 302 churches in 2002 in America.

====Primitive Advent Christian Church====
{{Main|Primitive Advent Christian Church}}
The '''Primitive Advent Christian Church''' is a small group which separated from the Advent Christian Church. It differs from the parent body mainly on two points. Its members observe foot washing as a rite of the church, and they teach that reclaimed backsliders should be baptized (even though they had formerly been baptized). This is sometimes referred to as rebaptism.

===Seventh-day Adventist===
{{Main|Seventh-day Adventist Church}}
The '''Seventh-day Adventist Church''', founded in 1863, had over 17,210,000 baptized members (not counting children of members) worldwide as of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|author=Seventh-day Adventist World Church Statistics |url=http://www.adventist.org/world-church/facts-and-figures/index.html |title=The Official Site of the Seventh-day Adventist world church |publisher=Adventist.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref> It is best known for its teaching that Saturday, the seventh day of the week, is the [[Sabbath in Seventh-day Adventism|Sabbath]] and is the appropriate day for worship. However, it is the second coming of Jesus Christ along with the Judgement day, based on the three angels message in Revelation 14: 6-13, that is the main doctrine of SDA. 

====Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement====
{{Main|Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement}}
The '''Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement''' is a small offshoot with an unknown number of members from the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] caused by disagreement over military service on the Sabbath day during [[World War I]].

{{Main|Shepherd's Rod}}
The '''Davidians''' (originally named '''Shepherd's Rod''') is a small offshoot with an unknown number of members made up primarily of voluntarily disfellowshipped members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. They were originally known as the Shepherd's Rod and are still sometimes referred to as such.  The group derives its name from two books on Bible doctrine written by its founder, [[Victor Houteff]], in 1929.

Its founding members separated in 1858 from those Adventists associated with [[Ellen G. White]] who later organized themselves as Seventh-day Adventists in 1863. The Church of God (Seventh Day) split in 1933, creating two bodies: one headquartered in Salem, West Virginia, and known as the [[Church of God (7th day) - Salem Conference]] and the other one headquartered in Denver, Colorado and known as the [[General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh-Day)]]. <!-- However, I think some CoG church members claim otherwise.

* At least two denominations and numerous individual churches with a [[Charismatic movement|charismatic]] or [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]]-type bent have been influenced by or were offshoots from Seventh-day Adventists – see '''[[charismatic Adventism]]''' generally

* '''[[United Sabbath-Day Adventist Church]]''', an [[African-American]] offshoot of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in [[New York City]]

* '''Celestia''', a Christian communal town near [[Laporte, Pennsylvania|Laporte]] in [[Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Sullivan County]], [[Pennsylvania]], founded by Millerite Peter E. Armstrong. It disintegrated before the end of the 19th century<ref>"[http://h0bbes.wordpress.com/2006/10/13/celestia/ Celestia]" blog by Jeff Crocombe, October 13, 2006</ref>

===Other relationships===
The [[Bible Student movement|Bible Students movement]] founded by [[Charles Taze Russell]] had in its early development close connections with the Millerite movement and stalwarts of the Adventist faith, including George Storrs and [[Joseph Seiss]]. The various groupings of Bible Students currently have a cumulative membership of less than 20,000 worldwide.  Although  Jehovah's Witnesses and Bible Students do not categorize themselves as part of the Millerite Adventist movement (or other denominations, in general), some theologians do categorize the group and schisms as Millerite Adventist because of its teachings regarding an imminent Second Coming and use of specific dates.  As of December 2008 there were approximately 7 million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide.
