The '''Behistun Inscription''' (also '''Bistun''' or '''Bisutun''', [[Modern Persian]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]: بیستون < [[Old Persian]]: '''Bagastana''', meaning "the place of god") is a multi-lingual inscription located on [[Mount Behistun]] in the [[Kermanshah Province]] of [[Iran]], near the city of [[Kermanshah]] in western Iran.

Authored by [[Darius the Great]] sometime between his coronation as king of the [[Persian Empire]] in the summer of 522 BC and his death in autumn of 486 BC, the inscription begins with a brief autobiography of Darius, including his ancestry and lineage. Later in the inscription, Darius provides a lengthy sequence of events following the deaths of [[Cyrus the Great]] and [[Cambyses II]] in which he fought nineteen battles in a period of one year (ending in December 521 BC) to put down multiple rebellions throughout the Persian Empire.  The inscription states in detail that the rebellions, which had resulted from the deaths of Cyrus the Great and his son Cambyses II, were orchestrated by several impostors and their co-conspirators in various cities throughout the empire, each of whom falsely proclaimed kinghood during the upheaval following Cyrus's death.

Darius the Great proclaimed himself victorious in all battles during the period of upheaval, attributing his success to the "grace of [[Ahuramazda|Ahura Mazda]]".

The inscription includes three versions of the same text, written in three different [[cuneiform script]] languages: Old Persian, [[Elamite language|Elamite]], and [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]] (a later form of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]). In effect, then, the inscription is to [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] what the [[Rosetta Stone]] is to [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s: the document most crucial in the [[decipherment]] of a previously lost [[writing system|script]].

The inscription is approximately 15&nbsp;metres high by 25&nbsp;metres wide and 100&nbsp;metres up a [[limestone]] cliff from an ancient road connecting the capitals of [[Babylonia]] and [[Medes|Media]] ([[Babylon]] and [[Ecbatana]], respectively). The Old Persian text contains 414 lines in five columns; the Elamite text includes 593 lines in eight columns, and the Babylonian text is in 112 lines. The inscription was illustrated by a life-sized bas-relief of [[Darius the Great|Darius I, the Great]], holding a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] as a sign of kingship, with his left foot on the chest of a figure lying on his back before him.  The supine figure is reputed to be the pretender [[Gaumata]].  Darius is attended to the left by two servants, and nine one-metre figures stand to the right, with hands tied and rope around their necks, representing conquered peoples.  [[Faravahar]] floats above, giving his blessing to the king. One figure appears to have been added after the others were completed, as was Darius's beard, which is a separate block of stone attached with [[iron]] pins and [[lead]].

==History==
After the fall of the Persian Empire's [[Achaemenid Dynasty]] and its successors, and the lapse of Old Persian cuneiform writing into disuse, the nature of the inscription was forgotten, and fanciful explanations became the norm. For centuries, instead of being attributed to Darius I, the Great, it was believed to be from the reign of [[Khosrau II]] of [[Persia]] — one of the last [[Sassanid]] kings, who lived over 1000 years after the time of Darius I.

The inscription is mentioned by [[Ctesias|Ctesias of Cnidus]], who noted its existence some time around 400 BC and mentioned a well and a garden beneath the inscription. He incorrectly concluded that the inscription had been dedicated "by Queen [[Semiramis of Babylon]] to [[Zeus]]". [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] also mentions it and includes a description of some of the long-lost ancillary monuments at the base of the cliff, including an altar to "[[Herakles]]". What has been recovered of them, including a statue dedicated in 148 BC, is consistent with Tacitus's description. [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] also writes of "Bagistanon" and claims it was inscribed by Semiramis.

A legend began around [[Mount Behistun]] (Bisutun), as written about by the [[Persian literature|Persian poet and writer]] [[Ferdowsi]] in his ''[[Shahnameh]]'' (''Book of Kings'') {{c.|1000}}, about a man named [[Farhad]], who was a lover of King  Khosrow's wife, [[Shirin]]. The legend states that, exiled for his transgression, Farhad was given the task of cutting away the mountain to find water; if he succeeded, he would be given permission to marry Shirin. After many years and the removal of half the mountain, he did find water, but was informed by Khosrow that Shirin had died. He went mad, threw his axe down the hill, kissed the ground and died. It is told in the book of [[Khosrow and Shirin]] that his axe was made out of a pomegranate tree, and, where he threw the axe, a pomegranate tree grew with fruit that would cure the ill. Shirin was not dead, according to the story, and mourned upon hearing the news.

In 1598, the [[England|Englishman]] [[Robert Sherley]] saw the inscription during a diplomatic mission to [[Iran|Persia]] on behalf of [[Austria]], and brought it to the attention of Western European scholars. His party incorrectly came to the conclusion that it was Christian in origin.<ref>E. Denison Ross, The Broadway Travellers: Sir Anthony Sherley and his Persian Adventure, Routledge, 2004, ISBN 0-415-34486-7</ref>
French General Gardanne thought it showed "Christ and his [[twelve apostles]]", and [[Robert Ker Porter|Sir Robert Ker Porter]] thought it represented the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]] and [[Shalmaneser I|Shalmaneser of Assyria]].<ref>[http://www.archive.org/download/travelsingeorgia02port/travelsingeorgia02port.pdf] Robert Ker Porter, Travels in Georgia, Persia, Armenia, ancient Babylonia, &c. &c. : during the years 1817, 1818, 1819, and 1820, volume 2, Longman, 1821</ref> 
Italian explorer [[Pietro della Valle]] visited the inscription in the course of a pilgrimage in around 1621CE.

[[File:Behistun DB1 1-15.jpg|thumb|330px|Column 1 (DB I 1-15), sketch by [[Friedrich von Spiegel]] (1881)]]
German surveyor [[Carsten Niebuhr]] visited in around 1764 for [[Frederick V of Denmark]], publishing a copy of the inscription in the account of his journeys in 1778.<ref>Carsten Niebuhr, Reisebeschreibung von Arabien und anderen umliegenden Ländern, 2 volumes, 1774 and 1778</ref>
Niebuhr's transcriptions were used by [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]] and others in their efforts to decipher the [[Old Persian cuneiform]] script. Grotefend had deciphered ten of the 37 symbols of Old Persian by 1802, after realizing that unlike the Semitic cuneiform scripts, Old Persian text is alphabetic and each word is separated by a vertical slanted symbol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientscripts.com/oldpersian.html |title=Old Persian |publisher=Ancient Scripts |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100418053701/http://www.ancientscripts.com/oldpersian.html| archivedate= 18 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The Old Persian text was copied and deciphered before the recovery and copying of the Elamite and Babylonian inscriptions had even been attempted, which proved to be a good deciphering strategy, since Old Persian script was easier to study due to its alphabetic nature and the fact that the language it represents had naturally evolved into [[Middle Persian]], and in turn, to the living modern [[Persian language]] dialects as well as the [[Avestan]] language, used in the [[Zoroastrian]] book the ''[[Avesta]]''.

In 1835, [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Rawlinson]], an officer of the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] army assigned to the forces of the [[Shah]] of Iran, began studying the inscription in earnest. As the town of Bisutun's name was anglicized as "Behistun" at this time, the monument became known as the "Behistun Inscription". Despite its relative inaccessibility, Rawlinson was able to scale the cliff and copy the Old Persian inscription. The Elamite was across a chasm, and the Babylonian four meters above; both were beyond easy reach and were left for later.

With the Persian text, and with about a third of the [[syllabary]] made available to him by the work of [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]], Rawlinson set to work on deciphering the text. Fortunately, the first section of this text contained a list of the same Persian kings found in [[Herodotus]] in their original Persian forms as opposed to Herodotus's Greek [[transliteration]]s; for example Darius is given as the original ''Dâryavuš'' instead of the Hellenized ''Δαρειος''. By matching the names and the characters, Rawlinson was able to decipher the type of cuneiform used for Old Persian by 1838 and presented his results to the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] in [[London]] and the [[Société Asiatique]] in [[Paris]].

In the interim, Rawlinson spent a brief tour of duty in [[Afghanistan]], returning to the site in 1843. He first crossed a chasm between the Persian and Elamite scripts by bridging the gap with planks, subsequently copying the Elamite inscription. He was then able to find an enterprising local boy to climb up a crack in the cliff and suspend ropes across the Babylonian writing, so that [[papier-mâché]] casts of the inscriptions could be taken. Rawlinson, along with several other scholars, most notably [[Edward Hincks]], [[Julius Oppert]], [[William Henry Fox Talbot]], and [[Edwin Norris]], either working separately or in collaboration, eventually deciphered these inscriptions, leading eventually to the ability to read them completely.

The translation of the Old Persian sections of the Behistun Inscription paved the way to the subsequent ability to decipher the Elamite and Babylonian parts of the text, which greatly promoted the development of modern [[Assyriology]].

==Later research and activity==
The site was visited by A. V. Williams Jackson in 1903.<ref>A. V. Williams Jackson, The Great Behistun Rock and Some Results of a Re-Examination of the Old Persian Inscriptions on It, Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. 24, pp. 77-95, 1903</ref>
Later expeditions, in 1904 sponsored by the [[British Museum]] and led by [[Leonard William King]] and [[Reginald Campbell Thompson]] and in 1948 by George G. Cameron of the [[University of Michigan]], obtained photographs, casts and more accurate transcriptions of the texts, including passages that were not copied by Rawlinson.<ref>[http://www.archive.org/download/sculpturesinscri00brituoft/sculpturesinscri00brituoft.pdf] W. King and R. C.

It also became apparent that rainwater had dissolved some areas of the limestone in which the text was inscribed, while leaving new deposits of limestone over other areas, covering the text.

In 1938, the inscription became of interest to the [[Nazi German]] [[think tank]] [[Ahnenerbe]], although research plans were cancelled due to the onset of World War II.

[[File:BehistunInscriptiondetail.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Close-up of the inscription showing damage]]
The monument later suffered some damage from [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers using it for target practice in [[World War II]], during the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]].<ref>http://ancientstandard.com/2011/03/30/the-behistun-inscription-the-iranian-rosetta-stone/</ref><ref>http://atlantisonline.smfforfree2.com/index.php?topic=2799.5;wap2</ref>

In 1999, Iranian archeologists began the documentation and assessment of damages to the site incurred during the 20th century. Malieh Mehdiabadi, who was [[project manager]] for the effort, described a [[Photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] process by which two-dimensional photos were taken of the inscriptions using two cameras and later transmuted into 3-D images.<ref name="chnpress1">{{cite web|url=http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&id=2589 |title=Documentation of Behistun Inscription Nearly Complete |publisher=Chnpress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref>

In recent years, Iranian archaeologists have been undertaking conservation works.  The site became a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/06/jul/1130.html |title=Iran's Bisotoon Historical Site Registered in World Heritage List |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2006-07-13 |accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref>

In 2012, the Bisotun Cultural Heritage Center organized an international effort to re-examine the inscription.<ref>[http://www.tehrantimes.com/arts-and-culture/98233-intl-experts-to-reread-bisotun-inscriptions] Intl. experts to reread Bisotun inscriptions, Tehran Times, May 27, 2012</ref>

==Other historical monuments in the Behistun complex==

The site covers an area of 116 hectares. Archeological evidence indicates that this region became a human shelter 40,000 years ago. There are 18 historical monuments other than the inscription of Darius the Great in the Behistun complex that have been registered in the Iranian national list of historical sites. Some of them are:

</gallery>
In the first image, [[Herakles]] with curly hair and a beard rests on the lion skin. Beside him, an olive tree is seen carved on the wall, while a quiver full of arrows is hanging from it, and a club resting close by. Behind the head of Herakles, an inscription of seven lines in old Greek is written on a smooth space with a frame similar to Greek temples. According to this inscription, the statue was carved in 139&nbsp;BC on the occasion of a conquest for Seleucid Greeks (under [[Demetrius II Nicator]]) against the Parthians (under [[Mithridates I of Parthia]]), though the Seleucids were later defeated and driven from the region.

The second image is a [[bas relief]] of Mithridates II of Parthia: this was carved in 123–110&nbsp;BC and represents Parthian king Mithridates and four of his satraps who are respecting the king. ''Bas relief of Gotarzes II of Parthia'' shows the conquest of that king over Meherdates, an [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] prince who lived in [[Rome]]. An inscription in Greek is seen on the left side of the top outer frame of the relief. ''Sheikh Ali khan Zangeneh text endowment'': According to this text, written in Sloth calligraphy, Sheikh Ali khan Zangeneh, a local ruler of the 17th century, dedicates four shares (out of six) of his properties in Ghareh-vali and Chambatan (local villages) for Sadaats (descendants of the prophet Mohammad), and two remaining shares for the Bisotoun Safavid caravansarai.
