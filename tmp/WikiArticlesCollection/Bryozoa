The '''Bryozoa''', also known as '''Polyzoa''', '''Ectoprocta''' or commonly as '''moss animals''',<ref name=Brusaca>{{Cite book|author=Brusca|author2=Brusca|title=The Invertebrates|chapter=21: The Lophophorate Phyla}}</ref> are a [[phylum]] of [[aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[invertebrate]] [[animal]]s. Typically about {{convert|0.5|mm|in}} long, they are [[filter feeder]]s that sieve food particles out of the water using a retractable [[lophophore]], a "crown" of [[tentacle]]s lined with [[cilia]]. Most [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] species live in tropical waters, but a few occur in [[oceanic trench]]es, and others are found in [[Geographical pole|polar]] waters. One [[class (biology)|class]] lives only in a variety of [[freshwater]] environments, and a few members of a mostly marine class prefer brackish water. Over 4,000&nbsp;living species are known. One [[genus]] is solitary and the rest [[Colony (biology)|colonial]].

The phylum was originally called "Polyzoa", but this term was superseded by "Bryozoa" in 1831. Another group of animals discovered subsequently, whose filtering mechanism looked similar, was also included in "Bryozoa" until 1869, when the two groups were noted to be very different internally. The more recently discovered group were given the name [[Entoprocta]], while the original "Bryozoa" were called "Ectoprocta". However, "Bryozoa" has remained the more widely used term for the latter group.

Individuals in bryozoan (ectoproct) colonies are called [[zooid]]s, since they are not fully independent animals. All colonies contain autozooids, which are responsible for feeding and [[excretion]]. Colonies of some [[class (biology)|classes]] have various types of non-feeding specialist zooids, some of which are hatcheries for fertilized eggs, and some classes also have special zooids for defense of the colony. The class [[Cheilostomata]] have the largest number of species, possibly because they have the widest range of specialist zooids. A few species can creep very slowly by using spiny defensive zooids as legs. Autozooids supply nutrients to non-feeding zooids by channels that vary between classes. All zooids, including those of the solitary species, consist of a ''cystid'' that provides the body wall and produces the [[exoskeleton]] and a ''polypide'' that contains the internal organs and the lophophore or other specialist extensions. Zooids have no special excretory organs, and the polypides of autozooids are scrapped when the polypides become overloaded by waste products; usually the body wall then grows a replacement polypide. In autozooids the gut is U-shaped, with the mouth inside the "crown" of tentacles and the anus outside it. Colonies take a variety of forms, including fans, bushes and sheets. The Cheilostomata produce [[biomineralization|mineralized]] exoskeletons and form single-layered sheets that encrust over surfaces.

Zooids of all the freshwater species are simultaneous [[hermaphrodite]]s. Although those of many marine species function first as males and then as females, their colonies always contain a combination of zooids that are in their male and female stages. All species emit [[sperm]] into the water. Some also release [[ovum|ova]] into the water, while others capture sperm via their tentacles to fertilize their ova internally. In some species the [[larva]]e have large yolks, go to feed, and quickly settle on a surface. Others produce larvae that have little yolk but swim and feed for a few days before settling. After settling, all larvae undergo a radical [[metamorphosis]] that destroys and rebuilds almost all the internal tissues. Freshwater species also produce [[statoblast]]s that lie dormant until conditions are favorable, which enables a colony's lineage to survive even if severe conditions kill the mother colony.

Predators of marine bryozoans include [[nudibranch]]s (sea slugs), fish, [[sea urchin]]s, [[pycnogonid]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[mite]]s and [[starfish]]. Freshwater bryozoans are preyed on by snails, insects, and fish. In [[Thailand]], many populations of one freshwater species have been wiped out by an [[introduced species]] of snail. A fast-growing invasive bryozoan off the northeast and northwest coasts of the USA has reduced [[kelp]] forests so much that it has affected local fish and invertebrate populations. Bryozoans have spread diseases to [[fish farm]]s and fishermen. Chemicals extracted from a marine bryozoan species have been investigated for treatment of [[cancer]] and [[Alzheimer's Disease]], but analyses have not been encouraging.

Mineralized skeletons of bryozoans first appear in rocks from Early [[Ordovician]] [[Period (geology)|period]],<ref name="Taylor2013"/> making it the last major phylum to appear in the fossil record. This has led researchers to suspect that bryozoans had arisen earlier but were initially unmineralized, and may have differed significantly from fossilized and modern forms. Early fossils are mainly of erect forms, but encrusting forms gradually became dominant. It is uncertain whether the phylum is [[monophyletic]]. Bryozoans' evolutionary relationships to other phyla are also unclear, partly because scientists' view of the family tree of animals is mainly influenced by better-known phyla. Both [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[molecular phylogeny]] analyses disagree over bryozoans' relationships with entoprocts, about whether bryozoans should be grouped with [[brachiopod]]s and [[phoronid]]s in [[Lophophorata]], and whether bryozoans should be considered [[protostome]]s or [[deuterostome]]s.

==Description==

===Distinguishing features===

Bryozoans, [[Phoronida|phoronids]] and [[Brachiopoda|brachiopods]] [[Filter feeding|strain food out of the water]] by means of a [[lophophore]], a "crown" of hollow tentacles. Bryozoans form colonies consisting of [[Cloning|clone]]s called zooids that are typically about {{convert|0.5|mm|in}} long.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> Phoronids resemble bryozoan zooids but are {{convert|2|to|20|cm|in}} long and, although they often grow in clumps, do not form colonies consisting of clones.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesPhoronida" /> Brachiopods, generally thought to be closely related to bryozoans and phoronids, are distinguished by having shells rather like those of [[bivalve]]s.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBrachiopoda" /> All three of these [[phylum|phyla]] have a [[coelom]], an internal cavity lined by [[mesothelium]].<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /><ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesPhoronida" /><ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBrachiopoda" /> 
Some encrusting bryozoan colonies with [[biomineralization|mineralized]] [[exoskeleton]]s look very like small corals. However, bryozoan colonies are founded by an ancestrula, which is round rather than shaped like a normal zooid of that species. On the other hand the founding polyp of a coral has a shape like that of its daughter polyps, and coral zooids have no coelom or lophophore.<ref name="RichFenton1997Bryozoans" />

[[Entoprocta|Entoprocts]], another phylum of filter-feeders, look rather like bryozoans but their lophophore-like feeding structure has solid tentacles, their [[anus]] lies inside rather than outside the base of the "crown" and they have no [[coelom]].<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesEntoprocta" />

The bodies of all types have two main parts. The ''cystid'' consists of the body wall and whatever type of [[exoskeleton]] is [[secretion|secreted]] by the [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]]. The exoskeleton may be organic ([[chitin]], [[polysaccharide]] or [[protein]]) or made of the mineral [[calcium carbonate]]. The body wall consists of the epidermis, [[basal lamina]] (a mat of non-cellular material), [[connective tissue]], muscles, and the [[mesothelium]] which lines the [[coelom]] (main body cavity)<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" />&nbsp;– except that in one [[class (biology)|class]], the mesothelium is split into two separate layers, the inner one forming a membranous sac that floats freely and contains the coelom, and the outer one attached to the body wall and enclosing the membranous sac in a [[pseudocoelom]].<ref name="Nielsen2001InEncOfLifeSci">{{Cite book

The most common type of zooid is the feeding autozooid, in which the polypide bears a "crown" of hollow tentacles called a [[lophophore]], which captures food particles from the water.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> In all colonies a large percentage of zooids are autozooids, and some consist entirely of autozooids, some of which also engage in reproduction.<ref name="McKinneyJackson">{{cite book|last=McKinney|first=F.K.|coauthors=Jackson, J.B.C.|title=Bryozoan evolution|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1991|pages=1–13|chapter=Bryozoans as modular machines|isbn=978-0-226-56047-2 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=TMnsG36wHoIC&pg=PA7&dq=Avicularia+bryozoa|accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref>

The basic shape of the "crown" is a full circle. In the [[class (biology)|class]] [[Phylactolaemata]] the crown appears U-shaped, but this impression is created by a deep dent in the rim of the crown, which has no gap in the fringe of tentacles.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> The sides of the tentacles bear fine hairs called [[cilia]], whose beating drives a water current from the tips of the tentacles to their bases, where it exits. Food particles that collide with the tentacles are trapped by [[mucus]], and further cilia on the inner surfaces of the tentacles convey the particles towards the mouth, which lies in the center of the base of the "crown".<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesLophoporata">{{cite book 
| author=Ruppert, E.E., Fox, R.S., and Barnes, R.D. | title=Invertebrate Zoology | chapter=Lophoporata
| publisher=Brooks / Cole | edition=7 | isbn=0-03-025982-7 | year=2004 | pages=817
}}</ref> The method used by ectoprocts is known as "upstream collecting", as food particles are captured before they pass through the field of cilia that creates the feeding current. This method is also used by [[phoronid]]s, [[brachiopod]]s and [[pterobranch]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Riisgård|first=H.U.|year=2000|title=Downstream collecting in ciliary suspension feeders: the catch-up principle|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=207|pages=33–51|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/207/m207p033.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=12 September 2009|doi=10.3354/meps207033|last2=Nielsen|first2=C|last3=Larsen|first3=PS}}</ref>

The lophophore and mouth are mounted on a flexible tube, called the "invert" because it can be turned inside-out and withdrawn into the polypide,<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> rather like the finger of a rubber glove; in this position the lophophore lies inside the invert and is folded like the spokes of an umbrella. The invert is withdrawn, sometimes within 60&nbsp;[[millisecond]]s, by a pair of retractor muscles that are anchored at the far end of the cystid. Sensors at the tips of the tentacles may check for signs of danger before the invert and lophophore are fully extended. Extension is driven by an increase in internal fluid pressure, which species with flexible exoskeletons produce by contracting circular muscles that lie just inside the body wall,<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> while species with a membranous sac use circular muscles to squeeze this.<ref name="Nielsen2001InEncOfLifeSci" /> Some species with rigid exoskeletons have a flexible membrane that replaces part of the exoskeleton, and transverse muscles anchored on the far side of the exoskeleton increase the fluid pressure by pulling the membrane inwards.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa"/> In others there is no gap in the protective skeleton, and the transverse muscles pull on a flexible sac which is connected to the water outside by a small pore; the expansion of the sac increases the pressure inside the body and pushes the invert and lophophore out.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> In some species the retracted invert and lophophore are protected by an operculum ("lid"), which is closed by muscles and opened by fluid pressure. In one [[class (biology)|class]], a hollow lobe called the "epistome" overhands the mouth.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" />

The gut is U-shaped, running from the mouth, in the center of the lophophore, down into the animal's interior and then back to the [[anus]], which is located on the invert, outside and usually below the lophophore.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> A network of strands of [[mesothelium]] called "funiculi" ("little ropes"<ref name="RanHouDictFuniculus">{{cite book|title=Random House Dictionary|publisher=Random House |chapter=funiculus|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/funiculus|accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref>) connects the mesothelium covering the gut with that lining the body wall. The wall of each strand is made of mesothelium, and surrounds a space filled with fluid, thought to be blood.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> A colony's zooids are connected, enabling autozooids to share food with each other and with any non-feeding heterozooids.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> The method of connection varies between the different classes of bryozoans, ranging from quite large gaps in the body walls to small pores through which nutrients are passed by funiculi.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /><ref name="Nielsen2001InEncOfLifeSci" />

There is a nerve ring round the pharynx (throat) and a [[ganglion]] that serves as a brain to one side of this. Nerves run from the ring and ganglion to the tentacles and to the rest of the body.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> Bryozoans have no specialized sense organs, but [[cilia]] on the tentacles act as sensors. Members of the [[genus]] ''[[Bugula]]'' [[phototropism|grow towards the sun]], and therefore must be able to detect light.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> In colonies of some species, signals are transmitted between zooids through nerves that pass through pores in the body walls, and coordinate activities such as feeding and the retraction of lophophores.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" />

The solitary individuals of ''Monobryozoon'' are autozooids with pear-shaped bodies. The wider ends have up to 15&nbsp;short, muscular projections by which the animals anchor themselves to sand or gravel<ref>{{cite book|last=Hayward|first=P.J.|title=Ctenostome Bryozoans|publisher=Linnean Society of London|year=1985|series=Synopses of the British fauna|pages=106–107|chapter=Systematic part|isbn=90-04-07583-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=HgwVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA106&dq=monobryozoon&q=monobryozoon|accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref> and pull themselves through the sediments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Giere|first=O.|title=Meiobenthology  |publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2009|edition=2|pages=227|chapter=Tentaculata|isbn=978-3-540-68657-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=an9ncYOxkUoC&pg=PA227&dq=monobryozoon&q=monobryozoon|accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref>

====Avicularia and vibracula====
Some authorities use the term ''avicularia'' to refer to any type of zooid in which the lophophore is replaced by an extension that serves some protective function,<ref name="McKinneyJackson" /> while others restrict the term to those that defend the colony by snapping at invaders and small predators, killing some and biting the [[appendage]]s of others.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> In some species the snapping zooids are mounted on a peduncle (stalk), their bird-like appearance responsible for the term&nbsp;– [[Charles Darwin]] described these as like "the head and beak of a vulture in miniature, seated on a neck and capable of movement".<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /><ref name="McKinneyJackson" /> Stalked avicularia are placed upside-down on their stalks.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> The "lower jaws" are modified versions of the opercula that protect the retracted lophophores in autozooids of some species, and are snapped shut "like a mousetrap" by similar muscles,<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> while the beak-shaped upper jaw is the inverted body wall.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> In other species the avicularia are stationary box-like zooids laid the normal way up, so that the modified operculum snaps down against the body wall.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> In both types the modified operculum is opened by other muscles that attach to it,<ref name="McKinneyJackson" /> or by internal muscles that raise the fluid pressure by pulling on a flexible membrane.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> The actions of these snapping zooids are controlled by small, highly modified polypides that are located inside the "mouth" and bear tufts of short sensory [[cilia]].<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /><ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> These zooids appear in various positions: some take the place of autozooids, some fit into small gaps between autozooids, and small avicularia may occur on the surfaces of other zooids.<ref name="McKinneyJackson" />

In vibracula, regarded by some as a type of avicularia, the operculum is modified to form a long bristle that has a wide range of motion. They may function as defenses against predators and invaders, or as cleaners. In some species that form mobile colonies, vibracula around the edges are used as legs for burrowing and walking.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /><ref name="McKinneyJackson" />

====Other types of colonial zooid====
Kenozooids (from Greek κενος meaning "empty"<ref>{{cite book|last=Liddell|first=H.G.|coauthors=Scott|others=R.|title=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1940|chapter=kenos|isbn=0-19-864226-1|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2356587|accessdate=2009-08-01}}</ref>) consist only of the body wall and funicular strands crossing the interior,<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> and no polypide.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> In some species they form the stems of branching structures, while in others they act as spacers that enable colonies to grow quickly in a new direction.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /><ref name="McKinneyJackson" />

Spinozooids form defensive spines, and sometimes appear on top of autozooids. Gonozooids act as brood chambers for fertilized eggs.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> Some species have miniature nanozooids with small single-tentacled polypides, and these may grow on other zooids or within the body walls of autozooids that have degenerated.<ref name="McKinneyJackson" />

The most common marine form, however, is encrusting, in which a one-layer sheet of zooids spreads over a hard surface or over seaweed. Some encrusting colonies may grow to over {{convert|50|cm|ft|sp=us}} and contain about 2,000,000&nbsp;zooids.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> These species generally have exoskeletons reinforced with [[calcium carbonate]], and the openings through which the lophophores protrude are on the top or outer surface.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> The moss-like appearance of encrusting colonies is responsible for the phylum's alternative name Bryozoa ([[Ancient Greek]] words βρυος ''bryos'' meaning "moss" and ζωον ''zoon'' meaning "animal").<ref name="SOED1959Bryozoa">{{cite book|last=Little|first=W.|coauthors=Fowler, H.W., Coulson, J. and Onions, C.T.|title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University|year=1959|chapter=Bryozoa|isbn=0-19-860613-3}}</ref> Large colonies of encrusting species often have "[[chimney]]s", gaps in the canopy of lophophores, through which they swiftly expel water that has been sieved, and thus avoid re-filtering water that is already exhausted.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eckman|first=J.E.|month=December | year=1998|title=A Model of Particle Capture by Bryozoans in Turbulent Flow: Significance of Colony Form|volume=152|pages=861–880 | doi=10.1086/286214|journal=The American Naturalist|pmid=18811433|last2=Okamura|first2=B|issue=6}}</ref> They are formed by patches of non-feeding heterozooids.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=S.|title=Life in moving fluids|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1996|edition=2|pages=191|chapter=Life in velocity gradients|isbn=978-0-691-02616-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XBqncfXFsOIC&pg=PA191&lpg=PA191&dq=bryozoan+chimney&q=|accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> New chimneys appear near the edges of expanding colonies, at points where the speed of the outflow is already high, and do not change position if the water flow changes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=von Dassow|first=M.|title=Function-Dependent Development in a Colonial Animal |journal=Biological Bulletin|volume=211|pages=76–82|url=http://www.biolbull.org/cgi/content/full/211/1/76|accessdate=2009-08-05|doi=10.2307/4134580|issn=0006-3185|date= August 1, 2006 | issue=1|pmid=16946244|jstor=4134580}}</ref>

Some freshwater species secrete a mass of gelatinous material, up to {{convert|1|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter, to which the zooids stick. Other freshwater species have plant-like shapes with "trunks" and "branches", which may stand erect or spread over the surface. A few species can creep at about {{convert|2|cm|in|sp=us}} per day.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" />

Each colony grows by [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] [[budding]] from a single zooid known as the ancestrula,<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> which is round rather than shaped like a normal zooid.<ref name="RichFenton1997Bryozoans" /> This occurs at the tips of "trunks" or "branches" in forms that have this structure. Encrusting colonies grow round their edges. In species with [[calcareous]] exoskeletons, these do not mineralize until the zooids are fully grown. Colony lifespans range from one to about 12&nbsp;years, and the short-lived species pass though several generations in one season.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" />

Species that produce defensive zooids do so only when threats have already appeared, and may do so within 48&nbsp;hours.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> The theory of "induced defenses" suggests that production of defenses is expensive and that colonies which defend themselves too early or too heavily will have reduced growth rates and lifespans. This "last minute" approach to defense is feasible because the loss of zooids to a single attack is unlikely to be significant.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> Colonies of some encrusting species also produce special heterozooids to limit the expansion of other encrusting organisms, especially other bryozoans. In some cases this response is more belligerent if the opposition is smaller, which suggests that zooids on the edge of a colony can somehow sense the size of the opponent. Some species consistently prevail against certain others, but most [[turf war]]s are indecisive and the combatants soon turn to growing in uncontested areas.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> Bryozoans competing for territory do not use the sophisticated techniques employed by [[sponge]]s or [[coral]]s, possibly because the shortness of bryozoan lifespans makes heavy investment in turf wars unprofitable.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" />

===Evolutionary family tree===
Scientists are divided about whether the Bryozoa (Ectoprocta) are a [[monophyletic]] group (whether they include all and only a single ancestor species and all its descendants), about what are the phylum's closest relatives in the family tree of animals, and even about whether they should be regarded as members of the [[protostome]]s or [[deuterostome]]s, the two major groups that account for all moderately complex animals.

The traditional view is that the Bryozoa are a monophyletic group, in which the [[class (biology)|class]] [[Phylactolaemata]] is most closely related to [[Stenolaemata]] and [[Ctenostomata]], the classes that appear earliest in the fossil record.<ref name="WoodLore2005PhylactolaemateMolPhylo" /> However, in 2005 a [[molecular phylogeny]] study that focused on phylactolaemates concluded that these are more closely related to the phylum [[Phoronid]]a, and especially to the only phoronid species that is colonial, than they are to the other ectoproct classes.

The analysis also concluded that the [[class (biology)|classes]] [[Phylactolaemata]], [[Stenolaemata]] and [[Gymnolaemata]] are also monophyletic, but could not determine whether [[Stenolaemata]] are more closely related to Phylactolaemata or [[Gymnolaemata]]. The Gymnolaemata are traditionally divided into the soft-bodied [[Ctenostomata]] and [[biomineralization|mineralized]] Cheilostomata, but the 2009 analysis considered it more likely that neither of these [[order (biology)|orders]] is monophyletic and that mineralized [[skeleton]]s probably evolved more than once within the early Gymnolaemata.<ref name="FuchsObstSundberg2009ComprMolPhyloOfBryozoa">{{cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=J.|month=July | year=2009|title=The first comprehensive molecular phylogeny of Bryozoa (Ectoprocta) based on combined analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial genes|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=52|issue=1|pages=225–233|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2009.01.021|pmid=19475710|last2=Obst|first2=M|last3=Sundberg|first3=P}}</ref>

Bryozoans' relationships with other phyla are uncertain and controversial. Traditional phylogeny, based on [[anatomy]] and on the development of the adult forms from [[embryo]]s, has produced no enduring consensus about the position of ectoprocts.<ref name="Nielsen2002PhyloPosOfEntoproctaEctoproctaPhoronidaBrachiopoda" /> Attempts to reconstruct the family tree of animals have largely ignored ectoprocts and other "minor phyla", which have received little scientific study because they are generally tiny, have relatively simple body plans, and have little impact on human economies&nbsp;&ndash; despite the fact that the "minor phyla" include most of the variety in the evolutionary history of animals.<ref>{{cite journal

In most bilaterian embryos the blastopore, a dent in the outer wall, deepens to become the larva's gut, but in ectoprocts the blastopore disappears and a new dent becomes the point from which the gut grows. The ectoproct coelom is formed by neither of the processes used by other bilaterians, [[enterocoely]], in which pouches that form on the wall of the gut become separate cavities, nor [[schizocoely]], in which the tissue between the gut and the body wall splits, forming paired cavities.<ref name="DewelWinstonMcKinney2001Deconstructing">{{cite book|last=Dewel|first=R.A.|coauthors=Winston, J.E., and McKinney, F.J.|others=M.E.|title=Bryozoan studies 2001: proceedings of the Twelfth International Bryozoology Conference|editor=Wyse Jacksdon, P.E., Buttler, C.E. and Spencer Jones, M.E.|publisher=Swets and Zeitlinger|location=Lisse|year=2002|pages=93–96|chapter=Deconstructing byozoans: origin and consequences of a unique body plan|isbn=90-5809-388-3|url=http://books.google.com/?id=4-jlUfCMlQkC&pg=PA93&dq=ectoprocta+bryozoa+phylogeny&q=ectoprocta%20bryozoa%20phylogeny|accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref>

When entoprocts were discovered in the 19th century, they and bryozoans (ectoprocts) were regarded as classes within the phylum Bryozoa, because both groups were [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] animals that [[filter feeder|filter-fed]] by means of a crown of tentacles that bore [[cilia]]. However, from 1869 onwards increasing awareness of differences, including the position of the entoproct [[anus]] inside the feeding structure and the difference in the early [[Cleavage (embryo)|pattern of division]] of cells in their [[embryo]]s, caused scientists to regard the two groups as separate phyla,<ref name="HausdorfHelmkampfMeyer2007Spiralian Phylogenomics" /> and "Bryozoa" became just an alternative name for ectoprocts, in which the anus is outside the feeding organ.<ref name="Halanych2004AnimalPhylogeny" /> A series of molecular phylogeny studies from 1996 to 2006 have also concluded that bryozoans (ectoprocts) and entoprocts are not sister groups.<ref name="HausdorfHelmkampfMeyer2007Spiralian Phylogenomics" /> However, two well-known zoologists, Claus Nielsen and [[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]], maintain on anatomical and developmental grounds that bryozoans and entoprocts are member of the same phylum, Bryozoa. A molecular phylogeny study in 2007 also supported this old idea, while its conclusions about other phyla agreed with those of several other analyses.<ref name="HausdorfHelmkampfMeyer2007Spiralian Phylogenomics" />

By 1891 bryozoans (ectoprocts) were grouped with [[phoronid]]s in a super-phylum called "Tentaculata". In the 1970s comparisons between phoronid larvae and the [[cyphonautes]] larva of some gymnolaete bryozoans produced suggestions that the bryozoans, most of which are colonial, evolved from a semi-colonial species of phoronid.<ref name="Nielsen2001AnimalEvoPhylumEctoprocta">{{cite book|last=Nielsen|first=C.|title=Animal evolution: interrelationships of the living phyla|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|edition=2|pages=244–264|chapter=Phylum Ectoprocta|isbn=0-19-850681-3|url=http://books.google.com/?id=UmCg6c0HkqMC&pg=PA257&lpg=PA257&dq=ectoprocta+bryozoa+phylogeny&q=ectoprocta%20bryozoa%20phylogeny|accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref> [[Brachiopod]]s were also assigned to the "Tentaculata", which were renamed [[Lophophorata]] as they all use a [[lophophore]] for filter feeding.<ref name="Halanych2004AnimalPhylogeny" /> Although the majority of scientists accept this,<ref name="Halanych2004AnimalPhylogeny" /> Claus Nielsen thinks these similarities are superficial.<ref name="Nielsen2002PhyloPosOfEntoproctaEctoproctaPhoronidaBrachiopoda">{{cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=C.|year=2002|title=The Phylogenetic Position of Entoprocta, Ectoprocta, Phoronida, and Brachiopoda|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|volume=42|issue=3|pages=685–691|doi=10.1093/icb/42.3.685|pmid=21708765}}</ref> The Lophophorata are usually defined as animals with a lophophore, a three-part coelom and a U-shaped gut.<ref name="Nielsen2001AnimalEvoPhylumEctoprocta" /> In Nielsen's opinion, phoronids' and brachiopods' lophophores are more like those of [[pterobranch]]s,<ref name="Nielsen2002PhyloPosOfEntoproctaEctoproctaPhoronidaBrachiopoda" /> which are members of the phylum [[Hemichordata]].<ref>{{cite web

If the grouping of bryozoans with phoronids and brachiopods into Lophophorata is correct, the next issue is whether the Lophophorata are [[protostome]]s, along with most invertebrate phyla, or [[deuterostome]]s, along with [[chordate]]s, [[hemichordate]]s and [[echinoderm]]s. The traditional view was that lophophorates were a mix of protostome and deuterostome features. Research from the 1970s onwards suggested they were deuterostomes, because of some features that were thought characteristic of deuterostomes: a three-part coelom; radial rather than spiral cleavage in the development of the embryo;<ref name="Halanych2004AnimalPhylogeny" /> and formation of the coelom by [[enterocoely]].<ref name="Nielsen2002PhyloPosOfEntoproctaEctoproctaPhoronidaBrachiopoda" /> However the coelom of ectoproct larvae shows no sign of division into three sections,<ref name="Nielsen2001AnimalEvoPhylumEctoprocta" /> and that of adult ectoprocts is different from that of other [[coelomate]] phyla as it is built anew from epidermis and mesoderm after metamorphosis has destroyed the larval coelom.<ref name="DewelWinstonMcKinney2001Deconstructing" />

Molecular phylogeny analyses from 1995 onwards, using a variety of biochemical evidence and analytical techniques, placed the lophophorates as protostomes and closely related to [[annelid]]s and [[mollusc]]s in a super-phylum called [[Lophotrochozoa]].<ref name="Halanych2004AnimalPhylogeny" /><ref name="HelmkampfBruchhausHausdorf2008PhylogenOfLophophorates">{{cite journal|last=Helmkampf|first=M.|year=2008|title=Phylogenomic analyses of lophophorates (brachiopods, phoronids and bryozoans) confirm the Lophotrochozoa concept|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological|volume=275|pages=1927–1933|doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0372|last2=Bruchhaus|first2=Iris|last3=Hausdorf|first3=Bernhard|pmid=18495619|issue=1645|pmc=2593926}}</ref> "Total evidence" analyses, which used both morphological features and a relatively small set of genes, came to various conclusions, mostly favoring a close relationship between lophophorates and Lophotrochozoa.<ref name="HelmkampfBruchhausHausdorf2008PhylogenOfLophophorates" /> A study in 2008, using a larger set of genes, concluded that the lophophorates were closer to the Lophotrochozoa than to deuterostomes, but also that the lophophorates were not monophyletic. Instead, it concluded that brachiopods and phoronids formed a monophyletic group, but bryozoans (ectoprocts) were closest to entoprocts, supporting the original definition of "Bryozoa".<ref name="HelmkampfBruchhausHausdorf2008PhylogenOfLophophorates" />

==Physiology==

===Feeding and excretion===
Most species are [[filter feeder]]s that sieve small particles, mainly [[phytoplankton]] (microscopic floating plants), out of the water.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> The freshwater species ''[[Plumatella emarginata]]'' feeds on [[diatom]]s, [[green algae]], [[cyanobacteria]], non-[[photosynthetic]] [[bacteria]], [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[rotifer]]s, [[protozoa]], small [[nematode]]s, and microscopic [[crustacean]]s.<ref name="CallaghanKarlson2002SummerDormancy" /> While the currents that bryozoans generate to draw food towards the mouth are well understood, the exact method of capture is still debated. All species also flick larger particles towards the mouth with a tentacle, and a few capture [[zooplankton]] (planktonic animals) by using their tentacles as cages. In addition the tentacles, whose surface area is increased by [[microvilli]] (small hairs and pleats), absorb [[organic compound]]s dissolved in the water.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> Unwanted particles may be flicked away by tentacles or shut out by closing the mouth.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> A study in 2008 showed that both encrusting and erect colonies fed more quickly and grew faster in gentle than in strong currents.<ref name="Pratt2008WhereFlowRight">{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=M.C.|year=2008|title=Living where the flow is right: How flow affects feeding in bryozoans|journal= Integrative and Comparative Biology|publisher=The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology|volume=48|issue=6|pages=808–822|doi=10.1093/icb/icn052|pmid=21669834  }}</ref>

In some species the first part of the stomach forms a muscular [[gizzard]] lined with [[chitin]]ous teeth that crush armored prey such as [[diatom]]s. Wave-like [[peristalsis|peristaltic]] contractions move the food through the stomach for digestion. The final section of the stomach is lined with [[cilia]] (minute hairs) that compress undigested solids, which then pass through the [[intestine]] and out through the [[anus]].<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" />

There are no [[nephridia]] ("little kidneys") or other [[excretory system|excretory]] organs in bryzoa,<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> and it is thought that [[ammonia]] [[molecular diffusion|diffuses]] out through the body wall and lophophore.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> More complex waste products are not excreted but accumulate in the [[polypide]], which degenerates after a few weeks. Some of the old polypide is recycled, but much of it remains as a large mass of dying cells containing accumulated wastes, and this is compressed into a "brown body". When the degeneration is complete, the cystid (outer part of the animal) produces a new polypide, and the brown body remains in the [[coelom]], or in the stomach of the new polypide and is expelled next time the animal [[defecate]]s.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" />

===Respiration and circulation===
There are no respiratory organs, [[heart]] or [[blood vessel]]s. Instead zooids absorb [[oxygen]] and eliminate [[carbon dioxide]] through the body wall and especially the lophophore.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> The fluid in the coelom transports gases and nutrients and its circulation is passive, except that some relatively large species use cilia to boost its speed.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> The different bryozoan groups use various methods to share nutrients and oxygen between zooids: some have quite large gaps in the body walls, allowing the coelomic fluid to circulate freely; in others the funiculi (internal "little ropes"<ref name="RanHouDictFuniculus" />) of adjacent zooids connect via small pores in the body wall.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /><ref name="Nielsen2001InEncOfLifeSci" />

===Reproduction and life cycles===
[[Image:ThecideanZalas.jpg|thumb|Encrusting cyclostome bryozoans (B), the one on the right showing swollen gonozooids; T = [[Thecideida|thecideide]] brachiopod and S = [[sabellida|sabellid]] worm tube; [[Jurassic]] of [[Poland]].]]
Zooids of all phylactolaemate species are simultaneous [[hermaphrodite]]s. Although those of many marine species are protandric, in other words function first as males and then as females, their colonies contain a combination of zooids that are in their male and female stages. In all species the [[ovary|ovaries]] develop on the inside of the body wall, and the [[testes]] on the funiculus connecting the stomach to the body wall.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> Eggs and sperm are released into the coelom, and sperm exit into the water through pores in the tips of some of the tentacles, and then are captured by the feeding currents of zooids that are producing eggs.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> Some species' eggs are fertilized externally after being released through a pore between two tentacles, which in some cases is at the tip of a small projection called the "intertentacular organ" in the base of a pair of tentacles. Others' are fertilized internally, in the intertentacular organ or in the coelom.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> In ctenostomes the mother provides a brood chamber for the fertilized eggs, and her polypide disintegrates, providing nourishment to the [[embryo]]. Stenolaemates produce specialized zooids to serve as brood chambers, and their eggs divide within this to produce up to 100&nbsp;identical embryos.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" />

The [[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] of bryozoan eggs is biradial, in other words the early stages are bilaterally symmetrical. It is unknown how the coleom forms, since the [[metamorphosis]] from [[larva]] to adult destroys all of the larva's internal tissues. In many animals the [[blastopore]], an opening in the surface of the early embryo, tunnels through to form the gut. However, in bryozoans the blastopore closes, and a new opening develops to create the mouth.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" />

Bryozoan larvae vary in form, but all have a band of cilia round the body which enables them to swim, a tuft of cilia at the top, and an adhesive sac that everts and anchors them when they settle on a surface.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> Some gymnolaemate species produce cyphonautes larvae which have little yolk but a well-developed mouth and gut, and live as [[plankton]] for a considerable time before settling. These larvae have triangular shells of chitin, with one corner at the top and the base open, forming a hood round the downward-facing mouth.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> In 2006 it was reported that the cilia of cyphonautes larvae use the same range of techniques as those of adults to capture food.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Strathmann|first=R.R.|month=March | year=2006|title=Versatile ciliary behaviour in capture of particles by the bryozoan cyphonautes larva|journal=Acta Zoologica|publisher=The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences|volume=87|issue=1|pages=83–89|doi=10.1111/j.1463-6395.2006.00224.x}}</ref> Species that brood their embryos form larvae that are nourished by large [[yolk]]s, have no gut and do not feed, and such larvae quickly settle on a surface.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> In all marine species the larvae produce cocoons in which they [[metamorphosis|metamorphose]] completely after settling: the larva's [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] becomes the lining of the [[coelom]], and the internal tissues are converted to a food reserve that nourishes the developing zooid until it is ready to feed.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> The larvae of phylactolaemates produce multiple polypides, so that each new colony starts with several zooids.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> In all species the founder zooids then grow the new colonies by [[budding]] [[Cloning|clone]]s of themselves. In phylactolaemates, zooids die after producing several clones, so that living zooids are found only round the edges of a colony.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" />

Phylactolaemates also reproduce asexually by a method that enables a colony's lineage to survive the variable and uncertain conditions of freshwater environments.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> Throughout summer and autumn they produce disc-shaped statoblasts, masses of cells that function as "survival pods" rather like the [[Sponge#Asexual|gemmules of sponges]].<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> Statoblasts form on the funiculus connected to the parent's gut, which nourishes them.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> As they grow, statoblasts develop protective [[Bivalve shell|bivalve-like]] shells made of [[chitin]]. When they mature, some statoblasts stick to the parent colony, some fall to the bottom ("sessoblasts"), some contain air spaces that enable them to float ("floatoblasts"),<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> and some remain in the parent's cystid to re-build the colony if it dies.<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> Statoblasts can remain dormant for considerable periods, and while dormant can survive harsh conditions such as freezing and [[desiccation]]. They can be transported across long distances by animals, floating vegetation, currents<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> and winds,<ref name="Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson" /> and even in the guts of larger animals.<ref name="WoodOkamura1999Asajirella">{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=T.S.|year=1999|title=''Asajirella gelatinosa'' in Panama: a bryozoan range extension in the Western Hemisphere|journal=[[Hydrobiologia]]|publisher=Kluwer Academic|volume=390|issue=1–3|pages=19–23|doi=10.1023/A:1003502814572|last2=Okamura|first2=Beth}}</ref> When conditions improve, the valves of the shell separate and the cells inside develop into a zooid that tries to form a new colony. ''[[Plumatella emarginata]]'' produces both "sessoblasts", which enable the lineage to control a good territory even if hard times decimate the parent colonies, and "floatoblasts", which spread to new sites. New colonies of ''[[Plumatella repens]]'' produce mainly "sessoblasts" while mature ones switch to "floatoblasts".<ref name="CallaghanKarlson2002SummerDormancy" /> A study estimated that one group of colonies in a patch measuring {{convert|1|m2|sqft|sp=US}} produced 800,000&nbsp;statoblasts.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa" /> 
<!--
Some freshwater bryozoans also avoid difficult conditions by producing statoblasts that lie dormant until conditions improve. For example, although conditions are favorable throughout the summer, most ''[[Plumatella emarginata]]'' statoblasts germinate in spring, very few in summer, and a significant numbers in autumn. Colonies that germinate in summer die quickly if [[crayfish]] are present, but survive about as well as spring and autumn colonies if there are no crayfish.<ref name="CallaghanKarlson2002SummerDormancy" />

==Anatomy==
[[Image:Costazia costazi.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[Costazia costazi]]'', a [[coralline]] bryozoan]]
Bryozoan skeletons grow in a variety of shapes and patterns: mound-shaped, lacy fans, branching twigs, and even corkscrew-shaped. Their [[skeleton]]s have numerous tiny openings, each of which is the home of a minute animal called a '''zooid'''. They also have a [[body cavity|coelomate]] body with a looped alimentary canal or gut, opening at the [[mouth]] and terminating at the [[anus]]. They feed with a specialized, [[cilia]]ted structure called a [[lophophore]], which is a crown of [[tentacle]]s surrounding the mouth. Their diet consists of small microorganisms, including [[diatom]]s and other unicellular [[algae]]. In turn, bryozoans are preyed on by grazing organisms such as [[sea urchin]]s and [[fish]]. Bryozoans do not have any defined respiratory, or circulatory systems due to their small size. However, they do have a simple nervous system and a hydrostatic skeletal system. Several studies have been undertaken on the crystallography of bryozoan skeletons, revealing a complex fabric suite of oriented [[calcite]] or [[aragonite]] crystallites within an organic matrix - see for example Hall ''et al.'' (2002).

[[Image:Lophophores bryozoan.jpg|thumb|right240px|bryozoan lophophores]]
The tentacles of the bryozoans are ciliated, and the beating of the [[cilia]] creates a powerful current of water which drives water together with entrained food particles (mainly phytoplankton) towards the mouth. The gut is U-shaped, and consists of a [[pharynx]] which passes into the [[esophagus]], followed by the [[stomach]], which has three parts: the [[cardia]], the [[caecum]], and the [[pylorus]]. The pylorus leads to an intestine and a short [[rectum]] terminating at the anus, which opens outside the [[lophophore]]. In some groups, notably some ctenostomes, a specialized [[gizzard]] may be formed from the proximal part of the cardia. Gut and lophophore are the principal components of the [[polypide]]. Cyclical degeneration and regeneration of the polypide is characteristic of marine bryozoans. After the final polypide degeneration, the skeletal aperture of the feeding zooid may become sealed by the secretion of a terminal [[Septum (marine biology)|diaphragm]]. In many bryozoans only the zooids within a few generations of the growing edge are in an actively feeding state; older, more proximal zooids (e.g. in the interiors of bushy colonies) are usually dormant.

[[File:Freshwater Bryozoan234.JPG|thumb|left|240px|Freshwater bryozoan]]
Because of their small size, bryozoans have no need of a [[blood]] system. Gaseous exchange occurs across the entire surface of the body, but particularly through the tentacles of the lophophore.

Bryozoans can reproduce both sexually and asexually. All bryozoans, as far as is known, are [[hermaphroditic]] (meaning they are both male and female). [[Asexual reproduction]] occurs by budding off new zooids as the colony grows, and is the main way by which a colony expands in size. If a piece of a bryozoan colony breaks off, the piece can continue to grow and will form a new colony. A colony formed this way is composed entirely of [[Cloning|clones]] (genetically identical individuals) of the first animal, which is called the '''ancestrula'''.

One species of bryozoan, ''Bugula neritina'', is of current interest as a source of [[cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] chemicals, [[bryostatin]]s, under clinical investigation as anti-cancer agents.

==Fossils==

[[Fossil]] bryozoans are found in rocks beginning in the [[Early Ordovician]] as part of the [[Ordovician radiation]]. They were often major components of Ordovician seabed communities and, like modern-day bryozoans, played an important role in [[sediment]] stabilization and binding, as well as providing sources of food for other [[benthic]] organisms. During the [[Mississippian]] (354 to 323 million years ago) bryozoans were so common that their broken skeletons form entire [[limestone]] beds. Bryozoan fossil record comprises more than 1,000 described species. It is plausible that the Bryozoa existed in the [[Cambrian]] but were soft-bodied or not preserved for some other reason; perhaps they evolved from a [[phoronid]]-like ancestor at about this time.

Bryozoans are important members of sclerobiont (organisms which dwell on hard substrates such as shells and rocks) communities in the fossil record and in the Recent. For a review of sclerobiont evolution, history and ecology, see Taylor & Wilson (2003).

Most fossil bryozoans have mineralized skeletons. The skeletons of individual zooids vary from tubular to box-shaped and contain a terminal aperture from which the [[lophophore]] is protruded to feed. No pores are present in the great majority of Ordovician bryozoans, but skeletal evidence shows that [[epithelia]] were continuous from one zooid to the next.

With regard to the bryozoan groups lacking mineralized skeletons, the [[statoblasts]] of freshwater [[phylactolaemates]] have been recorded as far back as the [[Permian]], and the [[ctenostome]] fossils date from the [[Triassic]].

One of the most important events during bryozoan evolution was the acquisition of a calcareous skeleton and the related change in the mechanism of tentacle protrusion. The rigidity of the outer body walls allowed a greater degree of zooid contiguity and the evolution of massive, multiserial colony forms.

==Classification==
The bryozoans were formerly considered to contain two subgroups: the ''ectoprocta'' and the [[Entoprocta|''entoprocta'']], based on the similar bodyplans and mode of life of these two groups. (Some researchers also included the [[Cycliophora]], which are thought to be closely related to the entoprocta.) However, the ectoprocta are ''coelomate'' (possessing a [[body cavity]]) and their embryos undergo [[radial cleavage]], while the entoprocta are ''acoelemate'' and undergo [[spiral cleavage]]. Molecular studies are ambiguous about the exact position of the entoprocta, but do not support a close relationship with the ectoprocta. For these reasons, the entoprocta are now considered a phylum of their own.<ref>{{cite book|author = James W. Valentine|title = On the origins of phyla |year = 2004|publisher = University of Chicago Press}}</ref> The removal of the 150 species of entoprocta leaves ''bryozoa'' synonymous with ''ectoprocta''; some authors have adopted the latter name for the group, but the majority continue to use the former.

The closest relations of the bryozoans appear to be the [[brachiopod]]s. The sister group to this clade is still unclear but this seems most likely to be the [[phoronid]]s.
