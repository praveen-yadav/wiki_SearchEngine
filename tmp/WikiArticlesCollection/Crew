A '''crew''' is a body or a class of people who work at a common activity, generally in a structured or [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] organization. A location in which a crew works is called a '''crewyard''' or a '''workyard'''. The word has nautical resonances: the tasks involved in operating a ship, particularly a sailing ship, providing numerous specialities within a ship's crew, often organised with a [[chain of command]]. Traditional nautical usage strongly distinguishes [[Commissioned officer|officer]]s from crew, though the two groups combined form the ship's company. Members of a crew are often referred to by the title "[[Crewman]]".

"Crew" also refers to the sport of [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], where teams row competitively in racing shells.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.speedrower.com/index.htm |title=Speed Rower, Competive Rowing |accessdate=2009-02-05 }}</ref>

"Crew" is used colloquially to refer to a small, tight-knit group of friends or associates engaged in criminal activity.  Also used in reference to the traditional "unit" of criminals under the supervision of a [[caporegime]] in the American Mafia.  However, the term is not specific to (Mafia-affiliated) [[organized crime]].

Crew can refer simply to a group of friends, unrelated to crime or violence.
