'''County Fermanagh''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ər|ˈ|m|æ|n|ə}} {{respell|fər|MA|nə}}; {{Irish derived place name|Fir Manach ''or'' Fear Manach|men of Manach}}) is one of the six [[Counties of Northern Ireland|counties]] of [[Northern Ireland]]. The county covers an area of 1,691&nbsp;km² (653 sq; mi), with a population of approximately 61,170, with [[Enniskillen]] its county town. It is also one of the thirty-two traditional [[counties of Ireland]], lying within the historical [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]].

Fermanagh is one of four counties of Northern Ireland presently to have a majority of the population from a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] background, according to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]].

==Geography==
Fermanagh borders [[County Tyrone]] to the north-east, [[County Monaghan]] to the south-east, [[County Cavan]] to the south-west, [[County Leitrim]] to the west and [[County Donegal]] to the north-west. The county town, Enniskillen, is the largest settlement in Fermanagh, situated in the middle of the county.

It is mainly rural and is situated largely in the basin of the [[River Erne]]. It is dominated by two connected lakes: Upper and Lower [[Lough Erne]], and including water spans an area of 1,851&nbsp;km² (715&nbsp;sq;&nbsp;mi).<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/County+Fermanagh] County Fermanagh, Land Area</ref> It is approximately {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Belfast]] and {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Dublin]].

==History==
The [[Annals of Ulster]] which cover medieval Ireland between AD 431 to AD 1540 were written at Belle Isle on [[Lough Erne]] near [[Lisbellaw]].

Fermanagh was a stronghold of the [[Maguire of Fermanagh|Maguire clan]] and Donn Carrach Maguire (died 1302) was the first of the chiefs of the Maguire dynasty. However on the confiscation of lands relating to [[Hugh Maguire (Lord of Fermanagh)|Hugh Maguire]], Fermanagh was divided in similar manner to the other five escheated counties among Scottish and English undertakers and native Irish. The baronies of Knockinny and Maghenaboy were allotted to Scottish undertakers, those of Clankelly, Magherastephana and Lurg to English undertakers and those of Clanawley, Coole, and Tyrkennedy, to servitors and natives. The chief families to benefit under the new settlement were the families of Cole, Blennerhasset, Butler, Hume, and Dunbar.

Fermanagh was made into a county by statute of Elizabeth I, but it was not until the time of the [[Plantation of Ulster]] that it was finally brought under civil government.

[[Fermanagh District Council]] is the only one of the 26 district councils in Northern Ireland that contains all of the county it is named after. The district council also contains a small section of [[County Tyrone]] in the [[Dromore, County Tyrone|Dromore]] and [[Kilskeery]] road areas.

Fermanagh is part of the [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone Parliamentary Constituency]], renowned for high levels of voting and for electing [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] [[hunger strike|hunger-striker]] [[Bobby Sands]] as a member of parliament in the [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election, April 1981]], shortly before his death.

==Industry and tourism==
Agriculture and tourism are two of the most important industries in Fermanagh. The main types of farming in the area are beef, dairy, sheep, pigs and some poultry. Most of the agricultural land is used as grassland for grazing and silage or hay rather than for other crops.

The waterways are extensively used by cabin cruisers, other small pleasure craft and anglers. The main town of Fermanagh is [[Enniskillen]] ({{lang|ga|''Inis Ceithleann''}}, 'Ceithleann's island'). The island town hosts a range of attractions including the [[Castle Coole]] Estate and [[Enniskillen Castle]], which is home to the museum of The [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]] and the [[5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards]].
