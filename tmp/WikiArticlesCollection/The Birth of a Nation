'''''The Birth of a Nation''''' (originally called ''The Clansman'') is a 1915 American [[Silent film|silent]] [[drama film]] directed by [[D. W. Griffith]] and based on the novel and play ''[[The Clansman]]'', both by [[Thomas Dixon, Jr.]] Griffith co-wrote the screenplay (with [[Frank E. Woods]]), and co-produced the film (with Harry Aitken). It was released on February 8, 1915. The film was originally presented in two parts, separated by an intermission.

The film chronicles the relationship of two families in [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]-era America: the pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[Northern United States|Northern]] Stonemans and the pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] [[Southern United States|Southern]] Camerons over the course of several years. The [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] by [[John Wilkes Booth]] is dramatized.

The film was a commercial success, but was highly controversial owing to its portrayal of African-American men (played by [[White people|white]] actors in [[blackface]]) as unintelligent and sexually aggressive towards white women, and the portrayal of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (whose original founding is dramatized) as a heroic force.<ref>[http://www.moviejustice.com/vault/index.php?p=getitem&db_id=4&item_id=27 MJ Movie Reviews – Birth of a Nation, The (1915) by Dan DeVore] {{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://themovingarts.com/revered-and-reviled-d-w-griffiths-the-birth-of-a-nation/|first=Eric M.|last=Armstrong|title=Revered and Reviled: D.W.

The film is also credited as one of the events that inspired the formation of the "second era" Ku Klux Klan at [[Stone Mountain]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in the same year. ''The Birth of a Nation'' was used as a recruiting tool for the KKK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megaessays.com/viewpaper/72334.html |title=A Birth of a Nation essays |publisher=Megaessays.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref> Under Democratic President [[Woodrow Wilson]], it was the first motion picture to be shown at the [[White House]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=fGJFpiTjbKwC&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=%22operators+wearing+full+evening+dress+utilized%22&source=bl&ots=AOFjf60Rc_&sig=GJ-f9FVH8MfOtgnzIJLQV_3l-DU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_m5hUMf9JI-whAfz6oCQAg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22operators%20wearing%20full%20evening%20dress%20utilized%22&f=false |title=Stokes p111 |publisher=Books.google.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref>

Despite the film's controversial content, Griffith's innovative film techniques make it one of the most important and influential films in the commercial film industry.

==Plot==

===Part 1: Civil War America===
The film follows two juxtaposed families: the Northern Stonemans, consisting of the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] Congressman Austin Stoneman, based on the Reconstruction-era Congressman [[Thaddeus Stevens]],<ref>...(the) portrayal of "Austin Stoneman" (bald, clubfoot; mulatta mistress, etc.) made no mistaking that, of course, Stoneman was Thaddeus Stevens..."

The Stoneman brothers visit the Camerons at their [[South Carolina]] estate, representing the [[Old South]]. The elder of the two Stoneman sons falls in love with Margaret Cameron, while Ben Cameron idolizes a picture of Elsie Stoneman. When the Civil War begins, all the young men join their respective armies.

A black [[militia]] (with a white leader) ransacks the Cameron house. The Cameron women are rescued when Confederate soldiers rout the militia. Meanwhile, the younger Stoneman and two of the Cameron brothers are killed in the war.  Ben Cameron is wounded after a heroic charge at the [[Siege of Petersburg]], in which he gains the nickname "the Little Colonel". He is taken to a Northern hospital where he  meets Elsie Stoneman, who is working there as a nurse. While recovering, Cameron is told that he will be hanged for being a guerrilla. Elsie takes Cameron's mother, who has traveled to Washington to tend her son, to see [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Mrs. Cameron persuades Lincoln to issue a pardon.

When [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln is assassinated]] at [[Ford's Theater]], his conciliatory postwar policy expires with him. Austin Stoneman and other [[Radical Republicans|radical congressmen]] are determined to punish the South, using harsh measures that Griffith depicts as typical of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]].<ref>Griffith followed the then-dominant [[Dunning School]] or "Tragic Era" view of Reconstruction presented by early 20th-century historians such as [[William Archibald Dunning]] and [[Claude G. Bowers]]. Stokes 2007, pp. 190–191.</ref>

===Part 2: Reconstruction===
[[File:The Birth of a Nation war scene.jpg|thumb|left|Battle scene from ''The Birth of a Nation'']]
Stoneman and his [[mulatto]] protégé, Silas Lynch, go to South Carolina in 1871 to observe the situation first hand. Black soldiers parade through the streets. During the election, whites are turned away while blacks stuff the ballot boxes. Lynch is elected Lieutenant Governor. The newly elected mostly-black legislature is shown at their desks, with one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up, and others drinking liquor and feasting. They pass laws requiring white civilians to salute black officers and allowing mixed-race marriages.

Meanwhile, inspired by observing white children pretending to be ghosts to scare off black children, Ben fights back by forming the Ku Klux Klan. As a result, Elsie breaks off their relationship out of loyalty to her father. Gus, a freedman and soldier who is now a Captain, follows Flora Cameron as she goes alone to fetch water. He tells her he is looking to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer. When he does, she leaps to her death. Ben finds his sister, having run through the forest looking for her and seen her jump, and holds her as she lies dying. The Klan hunts Gus down, tries him, and finds him guilty. The clansmen leave his corpse on Lynch's doorstep.

Lynch orders a crackdown on the Klan. Dr. Cameron, Ben's father, is arrested for having Ben's Klan costume, a crime punishable by death. Ben and their faithful servants rescue him, and the Camerons flee. When their wagon breaks down, they make their way to a small hut, home to two former Union soldiers, who agree to hide them.  As an intertitle states, "The former enemies of North and South are united again in defense of their [[Aryan]] birthright."

Austin Stoneman leaves to avoid being connected with Lynch's crackdown. Elsie, learning of Dr. Cameron's arrest, goes to Lynch to plead for his release. Lynch tries to force Elsie to marry him and she finally faints. Stoneman returns, causing Elsie to be placed in another room, and is happy at first when Lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but is angered when Lynch tells him which one. Disguised Klansmen spies discover Elsie's plight when she breaks a window and cries for help and leave to get help. She falls unconscious again, and revives gagged and being bound. The Klan, gathered together at full strength and with Ben leading them, rides in to regain control of the town. When news reaches Ben about Elsie, he and others go to her rescue. Elsie frees her mouth and screams for help. Lynch is captured. Victorious, the clansmen celebrate in the streets. Meanwhile, Lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the Camerons are hiding. The clansmen, with Ben at their head, race to save them just in time.

The next election day, blacks find a line of mounted and armed Klansmen just outside their homes, and are intimidated into not voting. The film concludes with a double honeymoon of Phil Stoneman with Margaret Cameron and Ben Cameron with Elsie Stoneman. The masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away. The scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of Christ. The penultimate title rhetorically asks: "Dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial War shall rule no more? But instead-the gentle Prince in the Hall of Brotherly Love in the City of Peace."

''The Birth of a Nation'' began [[Principal photography|filming]] in 1914 and pioneered such camera techniques as the use of panoramic long shots, the iris effects, still-shots, [[night photography]], [[Panning (camera)|panning]] camera shots, and a carefully staged battle sequence with hundreds of extras made to look like thousands. It also contains many new artistic techniques, such as color tinting for dramatic purposes, building up the plot to an exciting climax, dramatizing history alongside fiction, and featuring its own musical score written for an orchestra.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

When the film was released, it shattered both box office and film-length records, running three hours and ten minutes. In 1998, it was voted one of the "[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|Top 100 American Films]]" (#44) by the American Film Institute.

The film was based on [[Thomas Dixon, Jr.]]'s novels ''[[The Clansman]]'' and ''[[The Leopard's Spots]]''. It was originally to have been shot in [[Kinemacolor]] but [[D. W. Griffith]] took over the Hollywood studio of Kinemacolor and Kinemacolor's plans to film Dixon's novel. Griffith, whose father served as a colonel in the [[Confederate Army]], agreed to pay Thomas Dixon $10,000 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1914}}}} today) for the rights to his play ''The Clansman''. Since he ran out of money and could afford only $2,500 of the original option, Griffith offered Dixon 25 percent interest in the picture. Dixon reluctantly agreed, and the unprecedented success of the film made him rich. Dixon's proceeds were the largest sum any author had received for a motion picture story and amounted to several million dollars.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Griffith's budget started at US$40,000 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40000|1914}}}} today), but the film finally cost $112,000<ref name="budget">William K. Everson, ''American Silent Film''. New York: Da Capo Press, 1978, p. 78</ref> (the equivalent of $2.41 million in 2010).<ref name=CPIndex>[http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/data/us/calc/ Consumer Price Index calculator] at Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis website</ref> As a result, Griffith had to seek new sources of capital for his film. A ticket to the film cost a record $2 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2|1915|r=2}}}} today).<ref name=CPIndex />

[[United States Military Academy|West Point]] engineers provided technical advice on the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battle scenes. They provided Griffith with the artillery used in the film.<ref>Seelye, Katharine Q. "When Hollywood's Big Guns Come Right From the Source", ''The New York Times'', June 10, 2002.</ref>

The [[film premiere]]d on February 8, 1915, at [[Clune's Auditorium]] in downtown Los Angeles. At its premiere the film was entitled ''The Clansman,'' but the title was later changed to ''The Birth of a Nation'' to reflect Griffith's belief that the United States emerged from the [[American Civil War]] and Reconstruction as a unified nation.<ref>[http://www.filmsite.org/birt.html  Dirks, Tim, ''The Birth of a Nation'', filmsite.org] Retrieved May 27, 2010.</ref>

==Responses==
[[File:George Beranger in The Birth of a Nation.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Beranger]] in an actual Confederate uniform; the film used Confederate Army surplus uniforms since the Civil War was still recent enough in 1915 for them to be readily available.]]
The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), founded in 1909, protested premieres of the film in numerous cities. It also conducted a public education campaign, publishing articles protesting the film's fabrications and inaccuracies, organizing petitions against it, and conducting education on the facts of the war and Reconstruction.<ref>[http://www.naacp.org/about/history/timeline/ NAACP – Timeline]  {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5mYNygoDO|date =January 5, 2010}}</ref>

When the film was shown, riots broke out in Boston, Philadelphia and other major cities. The cities of Chicago; Denver; Kansas City, Missouri; Minneapolis; Pittsburgh; and St. Louis, Missouri, refused to allow the film to open. The film's inflammatory character was a catalyst for gangs of whites to attack blacks. In {{USCity|Lafayette|Indiana}}, after seeing the film, a white man murdered a black teenager.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_birth.html "The Birth of a Nation"], ''The Rise and Fall of Jim Crow'': Jim Crow Stories, PBS</ref>

[[Thomas Dixon, Jr.]], author of the source play ''[[The Clansman]]'', was a former classmate of [[Woodrow Wilson]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Dixon arranged a screening at the [[White House]], for then-President Wilson, members of his cabinet, and their families. Wilson was reported to have said about the film, "It is like writing history with lightning. And my only regret is that it is all so terribly true". In ''Wilson: The New Freedom'', the historian Arthur Link quotes Wilson's aide, Joseph Tumulty, who denied Wilson said this and also claims that "the President was entirely unaware of the nature of the play before it was presented and at no time has expressed his approbation of it."<ref>Letter from J. M. Tumulty, secretary to President Wilson, to the Boston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, quoted in Link, ''Wilson''.</ref> Historians believe the quote attributed to Wilson originated with Dixon, who was relentless in publicizing the film. It has been repeated so often in print that it has taken on a life of its own. Dixon went so far as to promote the film as "Federally endorsed". After controversy over the film had grown, Wilson wrote that he disapproved of the "unfortunate production."<ref>Woodrow Wilson to Joseph P. Tumulty, April 28, 1915 in Wilson, ''Papers'', 33:86.</ref>

Griffith responded to the film's negative critical reception with his next film, ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]''.

Soon after World War I, in 1918, Emmett J. Scott helped produce and [[John W. Noble]] directed ''[[The Birth of a Race]],'' hoping to capitalize on the success of Griffith's film by presenting a film set during the war. It featured a German-American family divided by the war, with sons fighting on either side, and the one loyal to the United States surviving to be part of the victory.<ref>''New York Times''. Retrieved September 29, 2011.</ref>

In 1919, the director/producer/writer [[Oscar Micheaux]] released ''[[Within Our Gates]]'', a response from the African-American community.  Notably, he reversed a key scene of Griffith's film by depicting a white man assaulting a black woman.

The film was remixed as [http://www.rebirthofanation.com/ Rebirth of a Nation], a "live" cinema experience by [[DJ Spooky]] at Lincoln Center, and has toured at many venues around the world including [[The Acropolis]] as a live cinema "remix". The remix version was also presented at Paula Cooper Gallery in New York<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/395 |title=Rebirth of a Nation at Paula Cooper Gallery |publisher=Paulacoopergallery.com |date=2004-06-18 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref>

==Ideology and accuracy==
[[File:Wilson-quote-in-birth-of-a-nation.jpg|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson]]'s ''History of the American People'' is quoted in ''The Birth of a Nation''.]]
The film is controversial due to its interpretation of history. [[University of Houston]] historian Steven Mintz summarizes its message as follows: [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was a disaster, blacks could never be [[racial integration|integrated]] into white society as equals, and the violent actions of the Ku Klux Klan were justified to reestablish honest government.<ref>[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/slaveryfilm.cfm UG.edu], Digital History.</ref> The film suggested that the Ku Klux Klan restored order to the post-war South, which was depicted as endangered by abolitionists, freedmen, and [[carpetbagger|carpetbagging]] [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] politicians from the North. This reflects the so-called [[Dunning School]] of historiography.<ref>Stokes 2007, pp. 190–91.</ref> The film also portrays beloved President [[Abraham Lincoln]] as friend of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and hero to the racist White South. He is referred to as "the Great Heart".

Some historians, such as [[E. Merton Coulter]] in his ''The South Under Reconstruction'' (1947), maintained the Dunning School view after World War II.  Today, the Dunning School position is largely seen as a product of anti-black racism of the early 20th century, by which many Americans held that black Americans were unequal as citizens.

Veteran film reviewer [[Roger Ebert]] wrote,
{{quote|... stung by criticisms that the second half of his masterpiece was racist in its glorification of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and its brutal images of blacks, Griffith tried to make amends in ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916), which criticized prejudice. And in ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' he told perhaps the first [[miscegenation|interracial love]] story in the movies—even though, to be sure, it's an idealized love with no touching.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000123/REVIEWS08/1230301/1023 |title=SunTimes.com |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref>}}

Despite some similarities between the Congressman Stoneman character and  Rep. [[Thaddeus Stevens]] of [[Pennsylvania]], Rep. Stevens did not have the family members described and did not move to South Carolina during Reconstruction.  He died in Washington, DC in 1868. However, Stevens was widely rumored to keep [[Lydia Hamilton Smith|a biracial mistress-housekeeper]], who was generously provided for in his will.<ref>Marc Egnal, ''Clash of Extremes'', 2009.</ref>

The depictions of mass Klan paramilitary actions do not seem to have historical equivalents, although there were incidents in 1871 where Klan groups traveled from other areas in fairly large numbers to aid localities in disarming local companies of the all-black portion of the state militia under various justifications, prior to the eventual Federal troop intervention, and the organized Klan's continued activities as small groups of "night riders".<ref>West, Jerry Lee. ''The Reconstruction Ku Klux Klan in York County, South Carolina, 1865–1877'' (2002) p. 67</ref>

The [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights movement]] and other social movements created a new generation of historians, such as scholar [[Eric Foner]], who led a reassessment of Reconstruction. Building on Du Bois' work but also adding new sources, they focused on achievements of the African-American and white Republican coalitions, such as establishment of universal public education and charitable institutions in the South and extension of [[suffrage]] to black men. In response, the Southern-dominated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and its affiliated white militias used extensive terrorism, intimidation and outright assassinations to suppress African-American leaders and voting in the 1870s and to regain power.<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War''.

==Significance==
[[File:Nation walsh.jpg|thumb|[[Raoul Walsh]] as [[John Wilkes Booth]]]]

Released in 1915, ''The Birth of a Nation'' has been credited as groundbreaking among its contemporaries for its innovative application of the medium of film. According to the film historian [[Kevin Brownlow]], the film was "astounding in its time" and initiated "so many advances in film-making technique that it was rendered obsolete within a few years."<ref>Brownlow, Kevin (1968). ''The Parade's Gone By...''. University of California Press. p. 78. ISBN 0520030680.</ref> The content of the work, however, has received widespread criticism for its blatantly racist and fantastical depictions of scenes that are presented onscreen as if in documentary form. Film critic Roger Ebert writes, "Certainly ''The Birth of a Nation'' (1915) presents a challenge for modern audiences. Unaccustomed to silent films and uninterested in film history, they find it quaint and not to their taste. Those evolved enough to understand what they are looking at find the early and wartime scenes brilliant, but cringe during the postwar and Reconstruction scenes, which are racist in the ham-handed way of an old minstrel show or a vile comic pamphlet."<ref name=Ebert>{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=The Birth of a Nation (1915)|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030330/REVIEWS08/303300301/1023|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=February 21, 2011}}</ref>

In 1992, the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. Despite its controversial story, the film has been praised by film critics such as [[Roger Ebert]], who said: "''The Birth of a Nation'' is not a bad film because it argues for evil. Like Riefenstahl’s ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'', it is a great film that argues for evil. To understand how it does so is to learn a great deal about film, and even something about evil."<ref name=Ebert/> The website ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'', which compiles reviews from various sources, indicates the film has a 100% "fresh" (positive) rating.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/birth_of_a_nation/ | title=The Birth of a Nation Movie Reviews | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc | accessdate=July 19, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110629011751/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/birth_of_a_nation/ |archivedate = June 29, 2011|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

==Sequel==
A sequel called ''[[The Fall of a Nation]]'' was released in 1916. The film was directed by [[Thomas Dixon, Jr.]], who adapted it from his own novel ''[[The Fall of a Nation (novel)|The Fall of a Nation]]''. The film has three acts and a prologue.<ref>{{IMDb title|0006664|The Fall of a Nation (1916)}}</ref>  Despite its success in the foreign market, the film was not a success among the American audiences.<ref>{{cite book |title=American Racist: The Life and Films of Thomas Dixon |first=Anthony |last=Slide |year=2004 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |page=102 |isbn=978-0-8131-2328-8 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ng_fyVJVMz4C }}</ref>  It is believed that it is now a [[lost film]].

==New opening titles on re-release==
One famous part of the film was added by Griffith only on the second run of the film<ref>Richard Schickel, D. W. Griffith: An American Life (New York: Limelight Editions, 1984), p. 282</ref> and is missing from most online versions of the film (presumably taken from first run prints.)<ref>This includes the one at the Internet Movie Archive [http://www.archive.org/details/dw_griffith_birth_of_a_nation] and the Google video copy [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5639233838609252948#] and Veoh [http://www.veoh.com/browse/videos/category/entertainment/watch/v1640308YD8z9qcp Watch Videos Online | The Birth of a Nation | Veoh.com]. However, of multiple YouTube copies one which has the full opening titles is [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPxRIF1c2fI DW GRIFFITH THE BIRTH OF A NATION PART 1 1915 – YouTube]</ref>
<br />These are the second and third of three opening title cards which defend the film. The added titles read:
<blockquote>
A PLEA FOR THE ART OF THE MOTION PICTURE:
We do not fear censorship, for we have no wish to offend with improprieties or obscenities, but we do demand, as a right, the liberty to show the dark side of wrong, that we may illuminate the bright side of virtue – the same liberty that is conceded to the art of the written word – that art to which we owe the Bible and the works of Shakespeare
</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>
If in this work we have conveyed to the mind the ravages of war to the end that war may be held in abhorrence, this effort will not have been in vain.
</blockquote>

Various film historians have expressed a range of views about these titles. To Nicholas Andrew Miller, this shows that "Griffith's greatest achievement in ''The Birth of a Nation'' was that he brought the cinema's capacity for spectacle... under the rein of an outdated by comfortably literary form of historical narrative. Griffith's models... are not the pioneers of film spectacle... but the giants of literary narrative."<ref>{{cite book |title=Modernism, Ireland and the erotics of memory |last=Miller |first= Nicholas Andrew |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-81583-5|page=226  |url= }}</ref> On the other hand, S. Kittrell Rushing complains about Griffith's "didactic" title-cards,<ref>{{cite book |title=Memory and myth: the Civil War in fiction and film from Uncle Tom's cabin to Cold mountain  |last=Rushing |first=S. Kittrell |year=2007 |publisher=Purdue University Press |isbn=1-55753-440-3|page=307 |url= }}</ref> while Stanley Corkin complains that Griffith "masks his idea of fact in the rhetoric of high art and free expression" and creates film which "erodes the very ideal" of "liberty" which he asserts.<ref>{{cite book |title=Realism and the birth of the modern United States:cinema, literature, and culture |last=Corkin |first=Stanley |year=1996  |publisher=University of Georgia Press |isbn=0-8203-1730-6|pages=144–145 }}</ref>
