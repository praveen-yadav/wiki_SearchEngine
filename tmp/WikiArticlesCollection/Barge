A '''barge''' is a flat-bottomed [[boat]], built mainly for [[river]] and [[canal]] transport of heavy goods. Some barges are not self-propelled and need to be towed or pushed by [[towboats]]. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on an adjacent [[towpath]], contended with the [[railway]] in the early [[industrial revolution]], but [[history of the British canal system|were outcompeted]] in the carriage of high-value items due to the higher speed, falling costs, and route flexibility of [[Rail transport|rail]].

==Etymology==

''Barge'' is attested from 1300, from [[Old French]] ''barge'', from [[Vulgar Latin]] ''barga''. The word originally could refer to any small boat; the modern meaning arose around 1480. ''[[barque|Bark]]'' "small ship" is attested from 1420, from Old French ''barque'', from Vulgar Latin ''barca'' (400 AD). The more precise meaning "three-masted ship" arose in the 17th century, and often takes the French spelling for disambiguation. Both are probably derived from the [[Latin]] ''barica'', from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''baris'' "Egyptian boat", from [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''bari'' "small boat", [[hieroglyphic]] Egyptian <small><hiero>D58-G29-M17-M17-D21-P1</hiero></small> and similar ''ba-y-r'' for "basket-shaped boat".<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=8cMWickoS6oC&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=egyptian+word+for+boat+Bairi+&source=web&ots=HyFttihvZr&sig=x11WDJZ-M-mACFmJCF-KKanlHvg&hl=en ''An Egyptian hieroglyphic dictionary: with an index of English words''] by Sir Ernest Alfred Wallis Budge from [[Google Books]]</ref> By extension, the term "embark" literally means to board the kind of boat called a "barque".

On the [[Canals of Great Britain|Great British canal system]], the term 'barge' is used to describe a boat wider than a [[narrowboat]], and the people who move barges are often known as [[lightermen]]. In the United States, deckhands perform the labor and are supervised by a leadman or the mate. The captain and pilot steer the towboat, which pushes one or more barges held together with rigging, collectively called 'the tow'. The crew live aboard the towboat as it travels along the inland river system or the intracoastal waterways. These towboats travel between ports and are also called line-haul boats.

Poles are used on barges to fend off the barge as it nears other vessels or a wharf. These are often called 'pike poles'. On shallow canals in the United Kingdom, long [[punt (boat)|punt poles]] are used to manoeuvre or propel the barge.

Barges are used today for low-value bulk items, as the cost of hauling goods by barge is very low.  Barges are also used for very heavy or bulky items; a typical barge measures 195 by 35 feet (59.4&nbsp;m&nbsp;× 10.6&nbsp;m), and can carry up to about 1500 tons of cargo.  

As an example, on June 26, 2006, a 565-ton<!-- which long, metric or short? --> [[Cracking (chemistry)|catalytic cracking]] unit reactor was shipped by barge from the [[Tulsa Port of Catoosa]] in [[Oklahoma]] to a refinery in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]].  Extremely large objects are normally shipped in sections and assembled onsite, but shipping an assembled unit reduced costs and avoided reliance on construction labor at the delivery site (which in this case was still recovering from [[Hurricane Katrina]]).  Of the reactor's {{convert|700|mi|adj=on}} journey, only about 40&nbsp;miles were traveled overland, from the final port to the refinery.

Self-propelled barges may be used as such when traveling downstream or upstream in placid waters; they are operated as an unpowered barge, with the assistance of a tugboat, when traveling upstream in faster waters.  Canal barges are usually made for the particular canal in which they will operate.

Many barges, primarily [[Dutch barge|Dutch Barges]], which were originally designed for carrying cargo along the canals of Europe, are no longer large enough to compete in this industry with larger newer vessels. Many of these barges have been renovated and are now used as luxury [[Hotel barge|Hotel Barges]] carrying holiday makers along the same canals they once carried grain or coal.

In primitive regions today and in all pre-development (lacking highways or railways) regions worldwide in times before industrial development and highways, barges were the predominant and most efficient means of inland transportation in many regions. This holds true today, for many areas of the world. 

In such pre-industrialized, or poorly developed infrastructure regions, many barges are purpose-designed to be powered on waterways by long slender poles &mdash; thereby becoming known on American waterways as '''poleboats''' as the extensive west of North America was settled using the vast tributary river systems of the [[Mississippi]] [[drainage basin]]. Poleboats use muscle power of "walkers" along the sides of the craft pushing against a pole against the streambed, canal, or lake bottom to move the vessel where desired. In settling the American west it was generally faster to navigate downriver from [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania]], to the [[Ohio River]] confluence with the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and then pole upriver against the current to St. Louis than to travel overland on the rare primitive dirt roads for many decades after the [[American revolution]].

Once the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads reached Chicago, that time dynamic changed, and American poleboats became less common, relegated to smaller rivers and more remote streams. On the Mississippi riverine system today, including that of other sheltered waterways, industrial barge trafficking in bulk raw materials such as coal, coke, timber, iron ore and other minerals is extremely common; in the developed world using huge '''cargo barges''' that connect in groups and trains-of-barges in ways that allow cargo volumes and weights considerably greater than those used by pioneers of modern barge systems and methods in the [[Victorian era]].

Such barges need to be towed by [[tugboat]]s or pushed by [[towboat]]s. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on a waterway adjacent [[towpath]] were of fundamental importance in the early industrial revolution, whose major early engineering projects were efforts to build [[viaduct]]s, [[navigable aqueduct|aqueduct]]s and especially [[canal]]s to fuel and feed raw materials to nascent factories in the early industrial takeoff and take their goods to ports and cities for distribution.

The barge and canal system contended favorably with the [[railway]]s in the early [[industrial revolution]] before around the 1850s&ndash;1960s — for example, the [[Erie Canal]] in [[New York]] State is credited by economic historians with giving the growth boost needed for [[New York City]] to eclipse [[Philadelphia]] as America's largest port and city — but such canal systems with their locks, need for maintenance and dredging, pumps and sanitary issues [[history of the British canal system|were eventually outcompeted]] in the carriage of high-value items by the railways due to the higher speed, falling costs, and route flexibility of [[rail transport]]. Barge and canal systems were nonetheless of great, perhaps even primary, economic importance until after World War I in Europe, particularly in the more developed nations of the [[Low Countries]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], and especially [[Great Britain]] which more or less made the system characteristically its own.
