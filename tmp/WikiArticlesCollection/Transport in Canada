[[Transport Canada]] oversees and regulates most aspects of transportation within Canadian jurisdiction. Transport Canada is under the direction of the federal government's [[Minister of Transport (Canada)|Minister of Transport]]. The [[Transportation Safety Board of Canada]] is responsible for maintaining transportation safety in Canada by investigating accidents and making safety recommendations.

Nation-wide passenger services are provided by the [[Crown corporations of Canada|federal crown corporation]] [[Via Rail]]. Three Canadian cities have [[commuter rail]] services: in the [[Montreal]] area by [[Agence métropolitaine de transport|AMT]], in the [[Toronto]] area by [[GO Transit]], and in the [[Vancouver]] area by [[West Coast Express]]. Smaller railways such as [[Ontario Northland Railway|Ontario Northland]], [[Rocky Mountaineer]], and [[Algoma Central Railway|Algoma Central]] also run passenger trains to remote rural areas.

In Canada railways are served by [[standard gauge]], {{RailGauge|ussg}}, rails. See also [[track gauge in Canada]].

===Merchant marine===
{{Further|Canadian Merchant Navy}}
<!--see the 1934 to 1935 Canada Yearbook-->
Canada's merchant marine comprised a ''total'' of 173 ships ({{GRT|1000|metric|first=yes}} or over) {{GRT|2,129,243|metric}} or {{DWT|716,340|metric|first=yes}} at the end of 2007.<ref name="CIA Factbook"/>

==Pipelines==
[[Image:TransCanada pipeline.png|thumb|300px|The TransCanada pipeline route]]{{See also|Category:Natural gas pipelines in Canada|Lakehead Pipeline|TransCanada pipeline}}
Pipelines are part of the energy [[Petroleum production in Canada|extraction]] and transportation network of Canada and are used to transport [[natural gas]], [[Natural gas processing|natural gas liquids]], [[Petroleum|crude oil]], [[synthetic crude]] and other [[Petroleum product|petroleum based products]]. Canada has {{convert|23564|km|abbr=on}} of pipeline for transportation of crude and refined oil, and {{convert|74980|km|abbr=on}} for [[liquefied petroleum gas]].<ref name="CIA Factbook"/>

==Urban transport==
[[Image:NorthAmericanPublicTransport.png|thumb|300px|Some North American cities arranged by size along the horizontal axis and public transportation use on the vertical axis. Some American cities use less public transportation than some Canadian cities. Other cities in United States and Mexico, such as New York City and Mexico City, actually use more public transportation than the ones in Canada.]]
[[File:McGillMetro-RushHour.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Montreal Metro]]'s McGill station during rush hour.]]
Most Canadian cities have [[public transport]]ation, if only a [[bus]] system. Six Canadian cities have [[rapid transit]] systems and three have [[commuter rail]] systems (see below). In 2006, 11% of Canadians used public transportation to get to work. This compares to 80.0% that got to work using a car (72.3% by driving, 7.7% as a passenger), 6.4% that walked and 1.3% that rode a bike.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://livework.kingstoncanada.com/en/lifestyle/resources/CommutingPatternsandPlacesofWorkofCanadians-2006-StatsCanada.pdf |title=Commuting Patterns and Places of Work of Canadians, 2006 Census |publisher= Statistics Canada |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>

===Rapid transit systems===
{{Main|Rapid transit in Canada}}
There are six urban rapid transit systems operating in Canada: The [[Montreal Metro]], the [[Toronto subway and RT|Toronto Subway]], the Vancouver [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]], the Calgary [[C-Train]], the [[Edmonton Light Rail Transit]] and the [[Ottawa O-Train|O-Train]] in Ottawa.

There is also an Airport Circulator, the [[LINK Train]] at [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]]. It operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and is wheelchair-accessible. It is free of cost.

===Commuter train systems===

==History==
===European contact===
[[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]], relied on [[canoe]]s, [[kayak]]s, [[umiak]]s and [[Bull Boat]]s, in addition to the [[snowshoe]], [[toboggan]] and [[sled]] in winter for transportation prior to European contact. Europeans adopted these technologies as they pushed deeper into the continent's interior, and were thus able to travel via the waterways that fed from the [[St. Lawrence River]] and [[Hudson Bay]].<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/ Virtual Vault], an online exhibition of Canadian historical art at Library and Archives Canada</ref>

In the 19th century and early 20th century transportation relied on harnessing oxen to ''[[Red River ox cart]]s'' or horse to waggon. Maritime transportation was via manual labour such as canoe or wind on sail. Water or land travel speeds was approximately {{convert|8|to|15|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="GeoOfTrans">{{cite web | last =Rodrigue | first = Dr. Jean-Paul | title = Historical Geography of Transportation - Part I | work = Dept. of Economics & Geography | publisher = Hofstra University | date = 1998-2008 | url =http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch1en/conc1en/ch1c3_1en.html | accessdate = 2008-01-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080112113050/http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch1en/conc1en/ch1c3_1en.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-12}}</ref>

Settlement was along river routes. Agricultural commodities were perishable, and trade centres were within {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}. Rural areas centred around villages, and they were approximately {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} apart. The advent of [[Steam locomotive|steam railways]] and [[Steamboat|steamships]] connected resources and markets of vast distances in the late 19th century.<ref name="GeoOfTrans"/> Railways also connected city centres, in such a way that the traveller went by sleeper, railway hotel, to the cities. Crossing the country by train took four or five days, as it still does by car. People generally lived within {{convert|5|mi|0|abbr=on}} of the [[downtown]] core thus the train could be used for inter-city travel and the [[tram]] for commuting.

The advent of the interstate or Trans-Canada Highway in Canada in 1963 established ribbon development, truck stops, and industrial corridors along throughways.

The Federal Department of Transport established November 2, 1936, supervised railways, canals, harbours, marine and shipping, civil aviation, radio and meteorology. The Transportation Act of 1938 and the amended Railway Act, placed control and regulation of carriers in the hands of the Board of Transport commissioners for Canada. The Royal Commission on Transportation was formed December 29, 1948, to examine transportation services to all areas of Canada to eliminate economic or geographic disadvantages. The Commission also reviewed the Railway Act to provide uniform yet competitive freight-rates.<ref name="Year"/>
