'''''Inedia''''' (Latin: "[[fasting]]") is the alleged ability to live without [[food]].   The word was first used to describe a fast-based lifestyle within Catholic tradition, which holds that certain [[saint]]s were able to survive for extended periods of time without food or drink other than the [[Eucharist]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

'''Breatharianism''' is a related concept, in which believers claim food and possibly [[water]] are not necessary, and that humans can be sustained solely by [[prana]] (the vital life force in [[Hinduism]]), or, according to some, by the energy in [[sunlight]] (according to [[Ayurveda]], sunlight is one of the main sources of [[prana]]). The terms ''breatharianism'' or ''inedia'' may also refer to this philosophy practiced as a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] in place of the usual [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].

"Breatharianism" is a potentially lethal [[pseudoscience]], and several adherents of these practices have died from starvation.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news

==Scientific basis==
[[Nutrition]]al science indicates that fasting for extended periods leads to [[starvation]], [[dehydration]], and eventual death. In the absence of calorie intake, the body normally burns its own reserves of glycogen, body fat, and muscle.  Breatharians claim that their bodies do not consume these reserves while fasting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/breatharian1.htm |title=What happens to your body as a breatharian?

===Ram Bahadur Bomjon===
[[Ram Bahadur Bomjon]] is a young Nepalese Buddhist monk who lives as an ascetic in a remote area of Nepal.

===Jasmuheen===
[[Jasmuheen]] (born Ellen Greve) was a prominent advocate of breatharianism in the 1990s. She claimed "I can go for months and months without having anything at all other than a cup of tea. My body runs on a different kind of nourishment."{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Interviewers found her house stocked with food; Jasmuheen claimed the food was for her husband. In 1999, she volunteered to be monitored closely by the [[Australia]]n television program ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' for one week without eating to demonstrate her methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/60/stories/1999_10_24/story_57.asp|title=Living on air: Breatharian put to the test|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051102085047/http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/60/stories/1999_10_24/story_57.asp|archivedate=2 November 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/jasmuheen.htm |title = Jasmuheen |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/jc2J |archivedate=2012-05-30 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Jasmuheen stated that she failed on the first day of the test because the hotel room in which she was confined was located near a busy road, causing [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and [[pollution]] that prevented absorption of required nutrients from the air. "I asked for fresh air. Seventy percent of my nutrients come from fresh air. I couldn’t even breathe," she said. The third day the test was moved to a mountainside retreat. After Jasmuheen had fasted for four days, Dr. Berris Wink, president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association, urged her to stop the test.

According to Dr. Wink, Jasmuheen’s pupils were dilated, her speech was slow, and she was "quite dehydrated, probably over 10%, getting up to 11%". Towards the end of the test, she said, "Her pulse is about double what it was when she started. The risks if she goes any further are kidney failure. ''60 Minutes'' would be culpable if they encouraged her to continue. She should stop now". The test was stopped. Dr. Wink said, "Unfortunately there are a few people who may believe what she says, and I'm sure it's only a few, but I think it's quite irresponsible for somebody to be trying to encourage others to do something that is so detrimental to their health".<ref>{{cite news | date = 25 October 1999 |title = Fresh-air dietician fails TV show's challenge |work = Yahoo News}}</ref> Jasmuheen challenged the results of the program, saying, "Look, 6,000 people have done this around the world without any problem."{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Though she claims thousands of followers,<ref>{{cite web |last = Harris | first = Gillian | date = 6 April 2000 | title = Starvation guru given hostile reception | work = The Times }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://liberatapublishers.com/mysticism.htm |title = Mysticism |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/Wxr5 |archivedate=2012-05-30 |deadurl=no}}</ref> mostly in Germany,<ref>{{cite web | last = Steiner | first = Susie | date = 21 September 1999

Jasmuheen was awarded the [[Bent Spoon Award]] by [[Australian Skeptics]] in 2000 ("presented to the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudoscientific piffle").<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.skeptics.com.au/spoon/2000winners.htm |title = Bent Spoon 2000 – Winner (Jasmuheen) |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050616014356/http://skeptics.com.au/spoon/2000winners.htm |archivedate= 2005-06-16}}</ref>  She also won the 2000 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for Literature for ''Living on Light''.

When offered $30,000 to prove her claim with a blood test, she said that she didn't understand the relevance.<ref>{{cite web | year = 1997 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/correx/archives/jasmuheen.htm |title = Correx Archives&nbsp;— Jasmuheen | work = Corex | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate =7 June 2008  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/SVCe |archivedate=2012-05-24 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

In the documentary [[No Way to Heaven]] the Swiss chemist Michael Werner claims to have followed the directions appearing on Jasmuheen's books and to be living for several years without food. The documentary also describes two attempts of scientific verification of his claims.

====Deaths of Jasmuheen's followers====
The deaths of 49-year-old Australian-born Scotland resident Verity Linn, 31-year-old Munich preschool teacher Timo Degen, and 53-year-old Melbourne resident Lani Marcia Roslyn Morris while attempting the breatharian "diet" advocated by Jasmuheen have elicited criticism.<ref name="BBC" /><ref name="SundayTimes" /> Jim Vadim Pesnak, 63, and his wife Eugenia, 60, went to jail for six and two years, respectively, on charges of manslaughter for their involvement in the death of Morris, when Pesnak delayed seeking medical attention.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sands|first=Judy|title=Prison for air cult disciples|newspaper=Courier-Mail|date=27 November 1999}}</ref> Jasmuheen claimed that Linn's death had a psycho-spiritual, rather than physiological, source.  (Linn was nominated for a [[Darwin Award]], but did not win.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin1999-58.html |title=1999 Darwin Award: Breatharianism |archiveurl=http://archive.is/c93eE |archivedate=2013-01-21 |deadurl=no}}  The Darwin Awards.  Accessed 3:34 A.M. Eastern Standard Time, 8 July 2012 C.E.</ref>)

Jasmuheen has denied any involvement with the three deaths and claims she cannot be held responsible for the actions of her followers. In reference to the death of Lani Morris, she said that perhaps Morris was "not coming from a place of integrity and did not have the right motivation".<ref name="SundayTimes" />

In 2007, a pregnant woman in Hungary died of malnutrition while following a "lighteater" fast forced on the family by her husband, who was later remanded to a mental institution. The couple's two young children were also in dire straits when they were found.

In 2012 it was reported that a Swiss woman died of starvation after having attempted to survive on light alone, based on one of Jasmuheen's books.<ref>{{cite news |title=Swiss woman starves to death on daylight diet |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/swiss-woman-starved-to-death-on-daylight-diet/story-e6frf7lf-1226339082591 |newspaper=[[Herald Sun]] |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2012 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/fvxI |archivedate=2012-09-08 |deadurl=no}} "This was the fourth known death linked to breatharianism and Jasmuheen's books since the practice emerged in the early 90s."</ref>

On his website, Brooks states that his potential followers must first prepare by combining the junk food diet with the meditative incantation of five magic "fifth-dimensional" words which appear on his website, some of which are words from Kundalini yoga.<ref name="five_magical_words-download">[http://www.breatharian.com/images/The_five_magical_words-download_2.doc Five magic words download] (MS Word document)</ref><ref name="Five magic words">{{cite web|url=http://www.breatharian.com/fivemagicwords.html |title=Wiley Brooks website: Five magic words |publisher=Breatharian.com |date= |accessdate=30 July 2009 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/EnHeI |archivedate=2013-05-06 |deadurl=no}}</ref> In the "5D Q&A" section of his website Brooks claims that cows are fifth-dimensional (or higher) beings that help mankind achieve fifth-dimensional status by converting three-dimensional food to five-dimensional food (beef).<ref>[http://www.breatharian.com/qa5magicwords.html Q and A five magic words]<br>{{cite web |url=http://www.breatharian.com/5wordsqa/holycows.html |title=Holy cows section |archiveurl=http://archive.is/6wM8 |archivedate=2012-09-12 |deadurl=no}}</ref> In the "Question and Answer" section of his website, Brooks explains that the "Double Quarter-Pounder with Cheese" meal from [[McDonald's]] possesses a special "base frequency" and that he thus recommends it as occasional food for beginning breatharians.<ref name="Q&A">{{cite web|url=http://www.breatharian.com/5wordsqa.html |title=5 magic words Q&A |publisher=Breatharian.com |date= |accessdate=30 July 2009 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/7Adx8 |archivedate=2013-05-06 |deadurl=no}}</ref> He then goes on to reveal that [[Diet Coke]] is "liquid light".<ref name="Q&A"/> Prospective disciples are asked after some time following the junk food/magic word preparation to revisit his website in order to test if they can feel the magic.<ref name="Five magic words"/>

===Hira Ratan Manek===
Hira Ratan Manek (born 12 September 1937) claims that since 18 June 1995, he has lived on water, and, occasionally, [[tea]], [[coffee]], and [[buttermilk]]. Manek states that [[Sungazing]] is the key to his health,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://solarhealing.com |title = Solar Healing Center |accessdate =6 February 2012 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/muRs |archivedate=2012-06-30 |deadurl=no}}</ref> citing the [[Jainism|Jainist]] [[Tirthankara]] [[Mahavira]], ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] as his inspiration.

According to his website, three extended periods of his fasting have been observed under control of scientific and medical teams, the first lasting 211 days in 1995–96, in [[Kozhikode|Calicut, India]], under the direction of Dr C. K. Ramachandran. During that period he is reported to have lost 41&nbsp;kg.<ref name="niejedzenie1">{{cite web |url = http://niejedzenie.info/english/hiraratanmanek.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050301181035/http://niejedzenie.info/english/hiraratanmanek.htm |archivedate=1 March 2005 |title = Hira Ratan Manek |accessdate =7 June 2008}}</ref>

The second study lasted 411 days in 2000–2001, in [[Ahmedabad|Ahmedabad, India]], under the direction of a 21 member team of medical doctors and scientists led by doctors Sudhir Shah and K. K. Shah, a past President of the [[Indian Medical Association]] and current Chairman of the [http://www.jaindoctorsfederation.org/ Jainist Doctors' Federation] (the latter group aims to "Promote scientific research and medical education based on principles of Jainism").<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.jaindoctorsfederation.org/aimsandobjectives.html |title = ::: Aims &amp; Objectives Of Jdf ::: |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110726201118/http://www.jaindoctorsfederation.org/aimsandobjectives.html |archivedate= 2011-07-26}}</ref> Dr K. K. Shah said "Fasting is a method of curing the meditation of mind and body which has been proved by great jain monks, sanyasis and munis of ancient times. There is a need to propagate these methods during this age of increasing diseases of the body and mind due to over consumptions and increasing with fasting would help maintain perfection.".<ref name="niejedzenie1"/> Dr Sudhir Shah was also involved in the study of Prahlad Jani.<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl = http://www.amazingabilities.com/amaze5a.html |title =Unexplained Mysteries Prahlad Jani - No Food 65 Years |accessdate =7 June 2008|author=Vincent J.

The paper<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.amazingabilities.com/amaze5c.html |title = Prolonged Fasting - How Is It Possible - A Hypothesis |accessdate =7 June 2008|author=Dr. Sudhir V. Shah |archiveurl=http://archive.is/1wuk |archivedate=2012-07-29 |deadurl=no}}</ref> published by Dr Sudhir Shah makes it clear that dozens of people had access to Hira Ratan Manek during the study and he went on at least one excursion: "Most surprisingly, he had himself climbed the famous Shatrunjay mountain (Palitana hill) on 4.4.01, on 401st day of his legendary fasting along with 500 fellowmen without anybody’s help, within 1.5 Hrs. only". The paper reports that the subject lost 19&nbsp;kg of weight during the study period. Neither the experiment, as described in the paper, nor the paper itself have been validated by any other reputable, peer-reviewed scientific or medical journal.

A third study allegedly lasted for 130 days in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], at [[Thomas Jefferson University]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] under the direction of Dr. Andrew Newberg and  Dr. George C. Brainard. Dr Sudhir Shah, who led the previous study, acted as an advisor and consultant to the USA team. However, Dr. Andrew Newberg said that Hira stayed at the University of Pennsylvania only for brain scans on studies of meditation, not his ability to fast indefinitely.

In the documentary "Eat the Sun" (2011-Peter Sorcher), he was caught on camera eating a big meal in a restaurant on 500 Haight Street, San Francisco, U.S.A.<ref>{{YouTube|ds9Y9DScCK8}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref>

===Hinduism===
Hindu religious texts contain account of saints and hermits practicing what would be called inedia, breatharianism or Sustenance through Light in modern terms. In Valmiki's [[Ramayana]], Book III, Canto VI, an account of anchorites and holy men is given, who flocked around [[Rama]] when he came to [[Śarabhanga]]'s hermitage. These included, among others, the "...saints who live on rays which moon and daystar give" and "those ... whose food the wave of air supplies". In Canto XI of the same book a hermit named [[Māṇḍakarṇi]] is mentioned: "For he, great votarist, intent -- On strictest rule his stern life spent -- ... -- Ten thousand years on air he fed..."  (English quotations are from Ralph T. H. Griffith's translation).

[[Paramahansa Yogananda]]'s ''Autobiography of a Yogi'' details two alleged historical examples of breatharianism, [[Giri Bala]] and [[Therese Neumann]].

There are claims that [[Devraha Baba]] lived without food.

===Taoism===
* Chi Song Zi ([[:zh:赤松子|赤松子]])

===Shamanism===
* Henri Monfort

==In popular culture==
*In 1977, [[Jay Kinney]] drew an [[underground comics]] strip{{which|date=October 2013}} in which the breatharians take over.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Also in the comic, [[McDonald’s]] and all other restaurants all have [[scratch and sniff]] menus, with no actual food.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

*In a television documentary produced by the Israeli television [[Investigative journalism|investigative show]] ''The Real Face'' (פנים אמיתיות) hosted by [[Amnon Levy]], [[Israel]]i practitioner of Inedia, Ray Maor (ריי מאור), appeared to survive without food or water for eight days and eight nights. According to the documentary, he was restricted to a small villa and placed under constant video surveillance, with medical supervision that included daily blood testing. The documentary claimed Maor was in good spirits throughout the experiment, lost 17 lb after eight days, blood tests showed no change before, during or after the experiment, and [[Cardiologist]] Ilan Kitsis from [[Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center]] was "baffled."<ref>http://panim.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=1012415</ref><ref>http://panim.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=1013939&sid=267</ref><ref>http://glz.co.il/1363-28288-HE/Galatz.aspx</ref>

*In [[NetHack]] and derivatives, one conduct the game tracks involves not using food or water items, instead having to rely on divine intervention and other means to stay alive.
