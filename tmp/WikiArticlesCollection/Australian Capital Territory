'''Australian Capital Territory''' (abbreviated '''ACT''') (formerly, "The Territory for the Seat of Government" and, later, the "Federal Capital Territory") is a [[Capital districts and territories|territory]] in the south east of [[Australia]], [[enclave and exclave|enclaved]] within [[New South Wales]]. It is the smallest [[States and territories of Australia|self-governing internal territory]] in [[Australia]]. The only city and by far the most populous community is [[Canberra]], the capital city of Australia.

The need for a National Territory was flagged by colonial delegates during the [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] conventions of the late 19th century. Section 125 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] provided that following Federation in 1901, land would be ceded freely to the new [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]]. The territory was transferred to the Commonwealth by the state of [[New South Wales]] in 1911, two years prior to the naming of Canberra as the National Capital in 1913. The [[List of Australian floral emblems|floral emblem]] of the ACT is the [[Wahlenbergia gloriosa|Royal Bluebell]] and the [[List of Australian bird emblems|bird emblem]] is the [[Gang-gang Cockatoo]].<ref name="bluebell">

==Geography==
[[Image:ACT-Jervis Bay-Sydney-MJC.png|left|thumb|125px|Location of the ACT and Jervis Bay]]
The ACT is bounded by the [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]]-[[Cooma, New South Wales|Cooma]] railway line in the east, the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] of [[Naas (valley)|Naas Creek]] in the south, the watershed of the [[Cotter River]] in the west, and the watershed of the [[Molonglo River]] in the north-east. The ACT also has a small strip of territory around the southern end of the [[Beecroft Peninsula]], which is the northern headland of [[Jervis Bay Territory|Jervis Bay]].<ref name=Beecroft>While the bulk of this land was established as a separate [[Jervis Bay Territory]] when the Australian Capital Territory was granted self-government, it is not widely known that the portion on the [[Beecroft Peninsula]] remains part of the ACT. This is probably because the area has no permanent residents, being reserved as a live firing range for the Royal Australian Navy. However, retention of this strip of coastline ensures ongoing compliance with the legal requirement, as set out in section 4 of the Seat of Government Act 1908, that the ACT "shall ... have access to the sea".</ref><ref>The area of ACT land on the Beecroft Peninsula is clearly shown in the ''New South Wales Roads Directory'' (Map 177, grid ref. S 2), which is published by the National Roads and Motoring Association and is based on NSW Department of Lands maps. A good online GIS map showing the Beecroft Peninsula, and those areas which are part of the ACT, can be found at the website of the [http://maps2.shoalhaven.nsw.gov.au/imaps City of Shoalhaven], the adjacent NSW municipality.</ref>

Apart from the city of Canberra, the Australian Capital Territory also contains agricultural land ([[domestic sheep|sheep]], [[dairy cattle]], [[vineyard]]s and small amounts of crops) and a large area of national park ([[Namadgi National Park]]), much of it mountainous and forested. Small townships and communities located within the ACT include [[Williamsdale, Australian Capital Territory|Williamsdale]], [[Naas (valley)|Naas]], [[Uriarra, Australian Capital Territory|Uriarra]], [[Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory|Tharwa]] and [[Hall, Australian Capital Territory|Hall]].

Tidbinbilla is a locality to the south-west of Canberra that features the [[Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve]] and the [[Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex]], operated by the United States' [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) as part of its [[Deep Space Network]].

There are a large range of mountains, rivers and creeks in the Namadgi National Park. These include the Naas and Murrumbidgee Rivers.

===Climate===
Because of its elevation  {{convert|650|m|ft}} and distance from the coast, the Australian Capital Territory experiences four distinct seasons, unlike many other Australian cities whose climates are moderated by the sea. Canberra is notorious for hot, dry summers, and cold winters with occasional [[fog]] and frequent [[frost]]s. Many of the higher mountains in the territory's south-west are snow-covered for at least part of the winter. [[Thunderstorm]]s can occur between October and March, and annual rainfall is 623&nbsp;millimetres (24.5&nbsp;in), with rainfall highest in spring and summer and lowest in winter.

The highest maximum temperature recorded in the ACT was 42.8&nbsp;°C (109.0&nbsp;°F) at [[Acton, Australian Capital Territory|Acton]] on 11 January 1939. The lowest minimum temperature was −14.6&nbsp;°C (5.7&nbsp;°F) at [[Gudgenby, Australian Capital Territory|Gudgenby]] on 11 July 1971.<ref>[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], [http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/b5186097bad6b76cca256b3400819cd1 2002 Yearbook of Australia], retrieved 22 July 2007</ref>

===Geology===
{{main|Geology of the Australian Capital Territory}}
Notable geological formations in the Australian Capital Territory include the ''Canberra Formation'', the ''Pittman Formation'', ''Black Mountain Sandstone'' and ''State Circle Shale''.

In the 1840s [[fossil]]s of [[brachiopod]]s and [[trilobite]]s from the [[Silurian]] period were discovered at Woolshed Creek near [[Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory|Duntroon]]. At the time, these were the oldest fossils discovered in Australia, though this record has now been far surpassed.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.environment.act.gov.au/Files/heritageregister20010.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051022162853/http://www.environment.act.gov.au/Files/heritageregister20010.pdf|archivedate=22 October 2005|publisher=ACT Heritage Council|title=Entry to the ACT Heritage Register – 20010. Woolshed Creek Fossil Site}}</ref> Other specific geological places of interest include the State Circle cutting and the Deakin anticline.<ref>{{cite AHD|105733|State Circle Cutting}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.act.nationaltrust.org.au/places/deak-anti.html|title=National Trust of Australia – Deakin Anticline|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040706073745/http://www.act.nationaltrust.org.au/places/deak-anti.html|archivedate=6 July 2004}}</ref>

The oldest rocks in the ACT date from the [[Ordovician]] around 480 million years ago. During this period the region along with most of Eastern Australia was part of the ocean floor; formations from this period include the ''Black Mountain Sandstone'' formation and the ''Pittman Formation'' consisting largely of [[quartz]]-rich [[sandstone]], [[siltstone]] and [[shale]]. These formations became exposed when the ocean floor was raised by a major [[orogeny|volcanic activity]] in the [[Devonian]] forming much of the east coast of Australia.

[[File:Canberra at twilight from mt ainslie.jpg|thumb|Canberra, located in the northern end of the territory, is an entirely planned city.]]
[[File:Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly.jpg|thumb|The ACT Legislative Assembly building]]

The ACT has internal self-government, but [[Constitution of Australia|Australia's Constitution]] does not afford the territory government the full legislative independence provided to Australian states. Laws are made in a 17-member [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] that combines both state and local government functions.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.peo.gov.au/students/fact_sheets/three_levels_law-making.html|title=Three Levels of Law-Making|publisher=Parliamentary Education Office|archivedate=16 May 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130516042422/http://www.peo.gov.au/students/fact_sheets/three_levels_law-making.html}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.parliament.act.gov.au/members|title=Members|publisher=ACT Legislative Assembly|accessdate=16 October 2013}}</ref>

Members of the Legislative Assembly are elected via the [[Single transferable vote|Hare Clarke]] system.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.elections.act.gov.au/publications/act_electoral_commission_fact_sheets/elections_act_factsheet_hare-clark_electoral_system|title=Factsheet - Hare-Clark electoral system|date=5 July 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130606055358/http://www.elections.act.gov.au/publications/act_electoral_commission_fact_sheets/elections_act_factsheet_hare-clark_electoral_system|archivedate=6 June 2013|publisher=ACT Electoral Commission}}</ref> The ACT Chief Minister (currently [[Katy Gallagher]], [[Australian Labor Party]]) is elected by members of the ACT Assembly.

Unlike other self-governing Australian territories (for example, the [[Northern Territory]]), the ACT does not have an Administrator.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1301.0~2012~Main%20Features~Territory%20government~89|title=Territory Government|work=1301.0 - Year Book Australia, 2012 |date=24 May 2012|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref> The Crown is represented by the Australian [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] in the government of the ACT. Until 4 December 2011, the decisions of the assembly could be overruled by the Governor-General (effectively by the national government) under section 35 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, although the federal parliament voted in 2011 to abolish this veto power, instead requiring a majority of both houses of the federal parliament to override an enactment of the ACT.<ref name=vetopower>{{cite web|title=Disallowance powers removed from ACT self-government legislation|url=http://www.parliament.act.gov.au/index.asp?ID=7487|work=News, Events and Conferences|publisher=ACT Legislative Assembly|accessdate=5 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Territories Self-Government Legislation Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment of Laws) Act 2011 (Cth)|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011A00166|work=[[ComLaw]]|accessdate=14 September 2013}}</ref>  The Chief Minister performs many of the roles that a state governor normally holds in the context of a state; however, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly gazettes the laws and summons meetings of the Assembly.

In Australia's [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]], the ACT is represented by four federal members: two members of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]; the [[Division of Fraser]] and the [[Division of Canberra]] and is one of only two territories to be represented in the Senate, with two [[Australian Senate|Senators]] (the other being the Northern Territory). The Member for Fraser and the ACT Senators also represent the constituents of the [[Jervis Bay Territory]].

In 1915 the ''[[Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915]]'' created the [[Jervis Bay Territory]] as an annexe to the Australian Capital Territory. In 1988, when the ACT gained self-government, Jervis Bay became a separate territory administered by the Australian Government Minister responsible for Territories, presently the [[Minister for Home Affairs (Australia)]].

The ACT retains a small area of territory on the coast on the [[Beecroft Peninsula]], consisting of a strip of coastline around the northern headland of Jervis Bay (not to be confused with the Jervis Bay Territory, which is on the southern headland of the Bay). The ACT's land on the Beecroft Peninsula is an [[Exclave|"exclave"]], that is, an area of territory not physically connected to the main part of the ACT. Interestingly, this ACT exclave surrounds a small exclave of NSW territory, namely the [[Point Perpendicular]] lighthouse which is at the southern tip of the Beecroft Peninsula. The lighthouse and its grounds are New South Wales territory, but cut off from the rest of the state by the strip of ACT land. This is a geographic curiosity: an exclave of NSW land enclosed by an exclave of ACT land.<ref name=Beecroft></ref>

In the 2011 census the population of the ACT was 357,222 of which most lived in Canberra.<ref name=Census2011Y>{{Census 2011 AUS|id=8|name=2011 Census QuickStats - Australian Capital Territory|accessdate=16 October 2013|quick=on}}</ref> The ACT median weekly income for people aged over 15 was in the range $600–$699 while the population living outside Canberra was at the national average of $400–$499. The average level of degree qualification in the ACT is higher than the national average. Within the ACT 4.5% of the population have a postgraduate degree compared to 1.8% across the whole of Australia.

[[File:Canberra SPOT 1088.jpg|thumb|right|Canberra seen from Spot Satellite]]

Canberra is a [[New town|planned city]] that was originally designed by [[Walter Burley Griffin]], a major 20th century American architect.{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|pp=60-63}} Major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid.{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=67}} The city centre is laid out on two perpendicular axes: a water axis stretching along [[Lake Burley Griffin]], and a ceremonial land axis stretching from Parliament House on [[Capital Hill, Australian Capital Territory|Capital Hill]] north-eastward along [[ANZAC Parade, Canberra|ANZAC Parade]] to the [[Australian War Memorial]] at the foot of [[Mount Ainslie]].{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=64}}

The area known as the [[Parliamentary Triangle, Canberra|Parliamentary Triangle]] is formed by three of Burley Griffin's axes, stretching from Capital Hill along [[Commonwealth Avenue, Canberra|Commonwealth Avenue]] to the Civic Centre around City Hill, along Constitution Avenue to the Defence precinct on Russell Hill, and along Kings Avenue back to Capital Hill.{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=64}}

The larger scheme of Canberra's layout is based on the three peaks surrounding the city, Mount Ainslie, [[Black Mountain (Australian Capital Territory)|Black Mountain]], and [[Red Hill, Australian Capital Territory|Red Hill]]. The main symmetrical axis of the city is along [[ANZAC Parade, Canberra|ANZAC Parade]] and roughly<ref>Google Earth</ref> on the line{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=64-67}} between Mount Ainslie and [[Bimberi Peak]]. Bimberi Peak being the highest mountain in the ACT approximately {{convert|52|km|0|abbr=on}} south west of Canberra . The precise alignment of ANZAC parade is between Mount Ainslie and [[Capital Hill, Australian Capital Territory|Capital Hill]] (formally Kurrajong Hill).

The [[Walter Burley Griffin|Griffins]] assigned spiritual values to Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, and Red Hill and originally planned to cover each of these in flowers. That way each hill would be covered with a single, primary color which represented its spiritual value. This part of their plan never came to fruition. In fact, WWI interrupted the construction and some conflicts after the war made it a difficult process for the Griffins. Nevertheless, Canberra stands as an exemplary city design and is located halfway between the ski slopes and the beach. It enjoys a natural cooling from geophysical factors.

The urban areas of Canberra are organised into a hierarchy of districts, town centres, group centres, local suburbs as well as other industrial areas and villages. There are seven districts (with an eighth currently under construction), each of which is divided into smaller suburbs, and most of which have a town centre which is the focus of commercial and social activities. The districts were settled in the following chronological order:
* [[North Canberra]], mostly settled in the 1920s and '30s, with expansion up to the 1960s, now 14 suburbs
* [[South Canberra]], settled from the 1920s to '60s, 13 suburbs
* [[Woden Valley]], first settled in 1963, 12 suburbs
* [[Belconnen]], first settled in 1967, 25 suburbs
* [[Weston Creek]], settled in 1969, 8 suburbs
* [[Tuggeranong]], settled in 1974, 19 suburbs
* [[Gungahlin]], settled in the early 1990s, 18 suburbs although only 12 are developed or under development
* [[Molonglo Valley]], first suburbs currently under construction

The North and South Canberra districts are substantially based on Walter Burley Griffin's designs.{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=64}} In 1967 the then [[National Capital Development Commission]] adopted the "Y Plan" which laid out future urban development in Canberra around a series of central shopping and commercial area known as the 'town centres' linked by freeways, the layout of which roughly resembled the shape of the letter Y,{{sfn|Sparke|1988|pp=154-155}} with Tuggeranong at the base of the Y and Belconnen and Gungahlin located at the ends of the arms of the Y.{{sfn|Sparke|1988|pp=154-155}}

Development in Canberra has been closely regulated by government, both through the town planning process, but also through the use of crown lease terms that have tightly limited the use of parcels of land. All land in the ACT is held on 99 year leases from the national government, although most leases are now administered by the Territory government.

Most suburbs have their own local shops, and are located close to a larger shopping centre serving a group of suburbs. Community facilities and schools are often also located near local shops or group shopping centres. Many of Canberra's [[List of Canberra suburbs|suburbs]] are named after former Prime Ministers, famous Australians, early settlers, or use Aboriginal words for their title.

[[Street name]]s typically follow a particular theme; for example, the streets of [[Duffy, Australian Capital Territory|Duffy]] are named after Australian dams and reservoirs, the streets of [[Dunlop, Australian Capital Territory|Dunlop]] are named after Australian inventions, inventors and artists and the streets of [[Page, Australian Capital Territory|Page]] are named after biologists and naturalists. Most [[diplomatic mission]]s are located in the suburbs of [[Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory|Yarralumla]], [[Deakin, Australian Capital Territory|Deakin]] and [[O'Malley, Australian Capital Territory|O'Malley]]. There are three light industrial areas: the suburbs of [[Fyshwick, Australian Capital Territory|Fyshwick]], [[Mitchell, Australian Capital Territory|Mitchell]] and [[Hume, Australian Capital Territory|Hume]].

==Education==
{{main|Education in the Australian Capital Territory}}
Almost all educational institutions in the Australian Capital Territory are located within [[Canberra]]. The ACT public education system schooling is normally split up into [[Pre-School]], Primary School (K-6), High School (7–10) and [[College#Australia|College]] (11–12) followed by studies at university or CIT (Canberra Institute of Technology). Many private high schools include years 11 and 12 and are referred to as colleges. Children are required to attend school until they turn 17 under the ACT Government's "Learn or Earn" policy.<ref>[http://www.det.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/113726/Flyer_-_Learn_or_Earn.pdf Dept of Education & Training. 2011]</ref>

In February 2004 there were 140 [[List of schools in the Australian Capital Territory|public and non-governmental schools]] in Canberra; 96 were operated by the Government and 44 are non-Government.<ref>Australian Bureau of Statistics. 2005.

As of May 2004, 30% of people in the ACT aged 15–64 had a level of educational attainment equal to at least a [[bachelor's degree]], significantly higher than the national average of 19%.<ref>Australian Bureau of Statistics. 2005. [http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/94713ad445ff1425ca25682000192af2/71bcf1841bfa37f9ca256f84007c28f5!OpenDocument Education in the ACT]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref> The two main tertiary institutions are the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) in [[Acton, Australian Capital Territory|Acton]] and the [[University of Canberra]] (UC) in [[Bruce, Australian Capital Territory|Bruce]]. There are also two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou is a campus of the [[Australian Catholic University]] and St Mark's Theological College is a campus of [[Charles Sturt University]]. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus [[Canberra Institute of Technology]].

The [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] (ADFA) and the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] (RMC) are in the suburb of [[Campbell, Australian Capital Territory|Campbell]] in Canberra's inner northeast. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and [[Quaternary education|postgraduates]] and is officially a campus of the [[University of New South Wales]] while Duntroon provides [[Australian Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|Officer]] [[training]].

The [[Academy of Interactive Entertainment]] (AIE) offers courses in computer game development and 3D animation.
