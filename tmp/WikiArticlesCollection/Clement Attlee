'''Clement Richard Attlee, 1st Earl Attlee''', [[Order of the Garter|KG]], [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]], [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]<ref name="frs">{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1968.0002}}</ref> (3 January 1883 – 8 October 1967) was a British [[politician]] who served as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945]] to [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951]], and as the [[Labour Party (UK)#Leaders of the Labour Party since 1906|Leader of the]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1935|1935]] to [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1955|1955]].

Attlee was the first person ever to hold the office of [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], serving under [[Winston Churchill]] in the [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition government]], before going on to lead the Labour Party to a landslide election victory in [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945]] and a narrow victory in [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950]]. He became the first Labour Prime Minister ever to serve a full term, as well as the first to command a Labour majority in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], and remains to date the longest ever serving Leader of the Labour party.

First elected to Parliament in [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922]] as the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] for [[Limehouse (UK Parliament constituency)|Limehouse]], he rose quickly to become a minister in the [[Ramsay MacDonald|minority government]] led by [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in 1924.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/> In [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931]], after the Labour Party had suffered a disastrous election defeat, he was elected [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]].<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/> Four years later, he became the [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] after the resignation of [[George Lansbury]]. After reversing Labour's previous policy of [[pacificism]] and [[appeasement]], he became a strong critic of [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s attempts to appease [[Adolf Hitler]]. He took Labour into the [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition government, 1940–45]] formed by [[Winston Churchill]]. Initially serving as the [[Lord Privy Seal]], he was appointed [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] two years later.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/> With victory assured in the [[Second World War]] in 1945, the coalition government was dissolved and Attlee led Labour to win a huge majority in the ensuing [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|general election]].

The government he led built the [[post-war consensus]], based upon the assumption that [[full employment]] would be maintained by [[Keynesian|Keynesian policies]] and that a greatly enlarged system of social services would be created – aspirations that had been outlined in the wartime [[Beveridge Report]]. Within this context, his government undertook the [[nationalisation]] of [[Public utility|public utilities]] and [[Industries|major industries]], as well as the creation of the [[National Health Service]]. After initial [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] opposition to Keynesian fiscal policy, this settlement was [[Post-war consensus|broadly accepted by all parties]] for over three decades until [[Margaret Thatcher]] became Prime Minister in [[UK general election, 1979|1979]].<ref>[http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=party.history.page Conservative Party website – the postwar consensus]</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=kstOuQ0qJoEC&pg=PA17&dq=Paul+Addison+consensus+of+social+democracy#v=onepage&q=Paul%20Addison%20consensus%20of%20social%20democracy&f=false|title=The IMF Crisis of 1976 and British Politics: Keynesian Social Democracy ... - Kevin Hickson - Google Books|publisher=Books.google.co.uk|date=13 May 2005|accessdate=2013-03-20|isbn=9781850437253}}</ref> His government also presided over the [[Decolonization|decolonisation]] of a large part of the [[British Empire]], granting [[British India]], [[Burma]], and [[Ceylon]] independence, as well as ending the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] and the [[British Mandate of Jordan]]. When the budget crisis forced Britain out of Greece in 1947 he encouraged the United States to counter the Soviets with the [[Truman Doctrine]]. He avidly supported the [[Marshall Plan]] to rebuild Western Europe with American money, and the [[NATO]] military alliance against the Soviet bloc. After leading Labour to a narrow victory in [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950]], he was narrowly defeated by Churchill in [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951]]; he retired from politics in 1955.

In public, Attlee appeared modest and unassuming; he was ineffective at public relations and lacked charisma. His strengths emerged behind the scenes, especially in committees where his depth of knowledge, quiet demeanour, objectivity and pragmatism proved decisive. He saw himself as spokesman on behalf of the entire party, and successfully kept its multiple factions in harness. His reputation among scholars in recent decades has been much higher than during his years as Prime Minister, thanks to his role in forging the [[welfare state]] and opposing the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]].<ref>Nicklaus Thomas-Symonds, ''Attlee: a Life in Politics'' (2010), pp 2–4, 127</ref> In 2004 [[Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|he was voted]] the greatest British Prime Minister of the 20th Century by a poll of 139 academics organised by [[MORI|Ipsos MORI]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=661|title=Rating British Prime Ministers|publisher=Ipsos MORI|date=29 November 2004|accessdate=2011-10-02}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Attlee was born in [[Putney]], [[Surrey]] (now part of [[London]]), the seventh of eight children. His father was Henry Attlee (1841–1908), a solicitor, and his mother was Ellen Bravery Watson (1847–1920). He was educated at Northaw School, a boys' preparatory school near [[Pluckley]] in [[Kent]]. He then attended [[Haileybury College]], and [[University College, Oxford]], where he graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|Second Class Honours]] BA in [[Modern History]] in 1904. During this time Attlee also played football for [[Fleet Town F.C.]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fleethants.com/allhistory/fleetfc/fleetfc.htm|title=fleethants-HISTORY of FLEET TOWN FOOTBALL CLUB|publisher=Fleethants.com|accessdate=2012-07-21}}</ref> Attlee then trained as a lawyer, and was called to the Bar at Inner Temple in 1906.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/>

==Early career==
From 1906 to 1909, Attlee worked as manager of Haileybury House, a charitable club for [[working class]] boys in [[Stepney]] in the [[East End of London]] run by his old school. Prior to this, his political views had largely been [[conservative]]. However, after his shock at the poverty and deprivation he saw while working with the [[slum]] children, he came to the view that private [[Charitable organization|charity]] would never be sufficient to alleviate poverty, and that only direct action and [[income redistribution]] by the [[Sovereign state|state]] would have any serious effect. This sparked a process of political evolution that saw him develop into a full-fledged supporter of [[socialism]].<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/> He subsequently joined the [[Independent Labour Party]] in 1908, and became active in local politics.

In 1909, he worked briefly as a secretary for [[Beatrice Webb]], before becoming a secretary for [[Toynbee Hall]].<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/> In 1911, he was employed by the [[UK Government]] as an "official explainer", touring the country to explain [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[David Lloyd George]]'s [[National Insurance Act]]. He spent the summer of that year touring [[Essex]] and [[Somerset]] on a bicycle, explaining the Act at public meetings.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/> A year later, he became a lecturer at the [[London School of Economics]], remaining there until he applied for an army officer commission following the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in August 1914.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/>

==Service during the First World War==
During the [[First World War]], Attlee was commissioned<ref>''London Gazette'' issue 28985, published 24 November 1914. Page 5</ref> and served with the [[South Lancashire Regiment]] in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in [[Turkey]]. His decision to fight caused a rift between him and his older brother Tom, who, as a [[conscientious objector]], spent much of the war in prison.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett">Beckett, Francis. (1997) ''Clem Attlee: A Biography By Francis Beckett'', Richard Cohen Books, ISBN 1-86066-101-7</ref> After a period fighting in Gallipoli, he became ill with [[dysentery]] and was sent to a hospital in [[Malta]] to recover. His hospitalisation coincided with the [[Battle of Sari Bair]], which saw a large number of his comrades killed. Upon returning to action, he was informed that his regiment had been chosen to hold the final lines during the [[Gallipoli Campaign#Evacuation|evacuation of Suvla]]. As such, he was the penultimate man to be evacuated from [[Landing at Suvla Bay|Suvla Bay]], the last being General [[Frederick Stanley Maude]].<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/>

The Gallipoli Campaign had been proposed by the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Winston Churchill]]. Attlee believed that it was a bold strategy, which could have been successful if it had been better implemented on the ground. This gave him an admiration for Churchill as a military strategist, which would make their working relationship in later years productive.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/>

He later served in the [[Mesopotamian Campaign]] where he was badly wounded at the [[Battle of Hanna]], being hit in the leg by [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] while storming an enemy trench. He was sent back to Britain to recover, and spent most of 1917 training soldiers. That year, he was promoted to the rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]],<ref>London Gazette Issue 30425 published on the 11 December 1917</ref> leading him to be known as "Major Attlee" for the [[Interwar period|inter-war period]]. After recovering from his injuries, he was sent to France in June 1918 to serve on [[Western Front (World War I)|the Western Front]] for the final months of the war.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/>

After the war he returned to lecturing at the [[London School of Economics]], where he would remain until 1923.

==Marriage and children==
Attlee met [[Violet Attlee|Violet Millar]] on a trip to Italy in 1921. They were engaged a few weeks after their return, and were later married at [[Christ Church, Hampstead]] on 10 January 1922.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/> It would come to be a devoted marriage, until her death in 1964. They had four children:
* Lady Janet Helen (b. 1923); she married Harold Shipton at [[Ellesborough]] Parish church in 1947 <ref>{{cite web|title=Janet Attlee's wedding 1947|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/janet-attlees-wedding|publisher=British Pathe}}</ref> and later settled in the United States.
* Lady Felicity Ann (1925–2007), married John Harwood at [[Little Hampden]] in 1955 <ref>{{cite web|title=Felicity Attlee weds 1955|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/news-flashes-felicity-attlee-weds/query/Attlee|publisher=British Pathe}}</ref>
* [[Martin Attlee, 2nd Earl Attlee|Martin Richard, Viscount Prestwood, later 2nd Earl Attlee]] (1927–91) and
* Lady Alison Elizabeth (b. 1930), married Richard Davis at [[Great Missenden]] in 1952.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mr. Attlee's Daughter Weds – Alison Attlee… 1952|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/mr-attlees-daughter-weds-alison-attlee-to-r-davis|publisher=British Pathe}}</ref>

==Early political career==
===Local politics===
Attlee returned to [[Local government|local politics]] in the immediate post-war period, becoming mayor of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney]], one of London's poorest inner-city boroughs, in 1919. During his time as mayor, the council undertook action to tackle [[slum]] [[landlord]]s who charged high rents but refused to spend money on keeping their property in habitable condition. The council served and enforced legal orders on house-owners to repair their property. It also appointed health visitors and sanitary inspectors, and reduced the infant mortality rate.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/>

In 1920, while mayor, he wrote his first book, ''The Social Worker'', which set out many of the principles that informed his political philosophy and that were to underpin the actions of his government in later years.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/> The book attacked the idea that looking after the poor could be left to voluntary action. He wrote:

<blockquote>Charity is a cold grey loveless thing. If a rich man wants to help the poor, he should pay his taxes gladly, not dole out money at a whim.</blockquote>

He went on to write: <blockquote>In a civilised community, although it may be composed of self-reliant individuals, there will be some persons who will be unable at some period of their lives to look after themselves, and the question of what is to happen to them may be solved in three ways – they may be neglected, they may be cared for by the organised community as of right, or they may be left to the goodwill of individuals in the community. The first way is intolerable, and as for the third: Charity is only possible without loss of dignity between equals. A right established by law, such as that to an old age pension, is less galling than an allowance made by a rich man to a poor one, dependent on his view of the recipient's character, and terminable at his caprice.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/></blockquote>

He strongly supported the [[Poplar Rates Rebellion]] led by [[George Lansbury]] in 1921. This put him into conflict with many of the leaders of the London Labour Party, including [[Herbert Morrison]].<ref name="Attlee">Howell, David. (2006) ''Attlee (20 British Prime Ministers of the 20th Century)'', Haus Publishing, ISBN 1-904950-64-7</ref>

===Member of Parliament===
At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922 general election]], Attlee became the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[constituency]] of [[Limehouse (UK Parliament constituency)|Limehouse]] in [[Stepney]]. At the time, he admired [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and helped MacDonald get elected as Labour Party leader at the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1922|1922 Labour leadership election]]. He later regretted this decision.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/> He served as Ramsay MacDonald's [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|parliamentary private secretary]] for the brief 1922 parliament. His first taste of ministerial office came in 1924, when he served as Under-Secretary of State for War in the short-lived [[First Labour Government (UK)|first Labour government]], led by MacDonald.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/>

Attlee opposed the [[UK General Strike 1926|1926 General Strike]], believing that strike action should not be used as a political weapon. However, when it happened, he did not attempt to undermine it. At the time of the strike he was chairman of the Stepney Borough Electricity Committee. He negotiated a deal with the Electrical Trade Union so that they would continue to supply power to hospitals, but would end supplies to factories. One firm, Scammell and Nephew Ltd, took a civil action against Attlee and the other Labour members of the committee (although not against the Conservative members who had also supported this). The court found against Attlee and his fellow councillors and they were ordered to pay £300 damages. The decision was later reversed on appeal, but the financial problems caused by the episode almost forced Attlee out of politics.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/>

In 1927 he was appointed a member of the multi-party [[Simon Commission]], a [[Royal Commission]] set up to examine the possibility of granting [[Self-governance|self-rule]] to [[British Raj|India]]. Due to the time he needed to devote to the commission, and contrary to a promise MacDonald made to Attlee to induce him to serve on the commission, he was not initially offered a ministerial post in the [[Second Labour Government]].<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/>Attlee's unsought service on the Commission equipped him with a thorough exposure to India and many of its political leaders. He was later to decide the future of India as Prime Minister.

In 1930, Labour MP [[Oswald Mosley]] left the party after its rejection of his proposals for solving the unemployment problem. Attlee was given Mosley's post of [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]. He was [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster-General]] at the time of the [[History of the British Labour Party#Great Depression and the split under MacDonald|1931 crisis]], during which most of the party's leaders lost their seats. During the course of the second Labour government, Attlee had become increasingly disillusioned with Ramsay MacDonald, whom he came to regard as vain and incompetent, and of whom he later wrote scathingly in his autobiography.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/><ref>[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRmacdonald.htm Spartacus Schoolnet] – Contains excerpt from Attlee's biography towards the bottom of the page.</ref>

==Opposition==
===Deputy Leader===
After [[Ramsay MacDonald]] formed a [[National Government 1931-1935|National Government]] to combat the [[Great Depression]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931]], the ensuing election was a disaster for the Labour Party, which lost over 200 seats. The vast majority of the party's senior figures lost their seats, including the Leader [[Arthur Henderson]]. [[George Lansbury]] and Attlee were two of the very few surviving Labour MPs who had experience of government, and accordingly Lansbury was elected Leader with Attlee as his deputy.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/>

Attlee would effectively serve as acting leader for nine months from December 1933, after Lansbury fractured his thigh in an accident, which raised Attlee's public profile considerably. It was during this period, however, that personal financial problems almost forced Attlee to quit politics altogether. His wife had become ill, and at that time there was no separate salary for the [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]]. On the verge of resigning from Parliament, he was persuaded to stay by [[Stafford Cripps]], a wealthy socialist, who agreed to pay him an additional salary until his wife recovered.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/>

===Leader of the Opposition===
[[George Lansbury]], a committed [[pacifist]], resigned as the Leader of the Labour Party at the 1935 Party Conference after delegates voted in favour of sanctions against [[Italy]] for its aggression against [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]. Lansbury had strongly opposed the policy, and felt unable to continue leading the party. With a general election looming, the Parliamentary Labour Party appointed Attlee as [[interim leader]], on the understanding that a leadership election would be held after the general election.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/> Attlee therefore led Labour through the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935 election]], which saw the party stage a partial recovery from its disastrous 1931 performance, gaining over one hundred seats.

Attlee stood in the subsequent [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1935|leadership election]], held in October 1935, where he was opposed by [[Herbert Morrison]] and [[Arthur Greenwood]]. Morrison was seen as the favourite by many, but was distrusted by many sections of the party, especially the left-wing. Arthur Greenwood's leadership bid, meanwhile, was severely hampered by his [[alcoholism|alcohol problem]]. Attlee was able to come across as a competent and unifying figure, particularly having already led the party through a general election. He went on to come first in both the first and second ballots, formally being elected Leader of the Labour Party on 25 October 1935.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/>

Throughout the 1920s and most of the 1930s, the Labour Party's official policy had been to oppose rearmament, instead supporting internationalism and [[collective security]] under the [[League of Nations]]. At the 1934 Labour Party Conference in [[Southport]], Attlee declared that "We have absolutely abandoned any idea of nationalist loyalty. We are deliberately putting a world order before our loyalty to our own country. We say we want to see put on the statute book something which will make our people citizens of the world before they are citizens of this country".<ref>Talus, ''Your Alternative Government'' (London: Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1945), p. 17.</ref> During a debate on defence in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] a year later, Attlee said "We are told (in the White Paper) that there is danger against which we have to guard ourselves. We do not think you can do it by national defence. We think you can only do it by moving forward to a new world. A world of law, the abolition of national armaments with a world force and a world economic system. I shall be told that that is quite impossible".<ref>{{cite document|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1935/mar/11/defence|title=Defence|volume=299 cc35-174|publisher=Commons and Lords Hansard|date=11 March 1935|accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> Shortly after those comments, [[Adolf Hitler]] would give a speech in which he proclaimed that German rearmament offered no threat to world peace. Attlee responded the next day noting that Hitler's speech, although containing unfavourable references to the [[Soviet Union]], created "A chance to call a halt in the armaments race...We do not think that our answer to Herr Hitler should be just rearmament. We are in an age of rearmaments, but we on this side cannot accept that position".<ref>{{cite document|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1935/may/22/defence-policy |title=Defence Policy|date=22 May 1935|volume=302 cc359-486|publisher=Commons and Lords Hansard|accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref>

In April 1936, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Neville Chamberlain]], introduced a Budget which increased the amount spent on the armed forces. Attlee made a radio broadcast in opposition to it, saying the budget "was the natural expression of the character of the present Government. There was hardly any increase allowed for the services which went to build up the life of the people, education and health. Everything was devoted to piling up the instruments of death. The Chancellor expressed great regret that he should have to spend so much on armaments, but said that it was absolutely necessary and was due only to the actions of other nations. One would think to listen to him that the Government had no responsibility for the state of world affairs...The Government has now resolved to enter upon an arms race, and the people will have to pay for their mistake in believing that it could be trusted to carry out a policy of peace. ... This is a War Budget. We can look in the future for no advance in Social Legislation. All available resources are to be devoted to armaments."<ref>"Mr. Attlee on a war budget", ''The Times'', 23 April 1936, p. 16.</ref>

However, with the rising threat from [[Nazi Germany]], and the ineffectiveness of the League of Nations, this policy eventually lost credibility. By 1937, Labour had jettisoned its pacifist position and came to support rearmament and oppose Neville Chamberlain's policy of [[appeasement]].<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/> In 1938, Attlee opposed the [[Munich Agreement]] in which Chamberlain negotiated with Hitler to give Germany the German-speaking parts of [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Sudetenland]]: <blockquote>We all feel relief that war has not come this time. Every one of us has been passing through days of anxiety; we cannot, however, feel that peace has been established, but that we have nothing but an armistice in a state of war. We have been unable to go in for care-free rejoicing. We have felt that we are in the midst of a tragedy. We have felt humiliation. This has not been a victory for reason and humanity. It has been a victory for brute force. At every stage of the proceedings there have been time limits laid down by the owner and ruler of armed force. The terms have not been terms negotiated; they have been terms laid down as ultimata. We have seen to-day a gallant, civilised and democratic people betrayed and handed over to a ruthless despotism. We have seen something more. We have seen the cause of democracy, which is, in our view, the cause of civilisation and humanity, receive a terrible defeat. ... The events of these last few days constitute one of the greatest diplomatic defeats that this country and France have ever sustained. There can be no doubt that it is a tremendous victory for Herr Hitler. Without firing a shot, by the mere display of military force, he has achieved a dominating position in Europe which Germany failed to win after four years of war. He has overturned the balance of power in Europe. He has destroyed the last fortress of democracy in Eastern Europe which stood in the way of his ambition. He has opened his way to the food, the oil and the resources which he requires in order to consolidate his military power, and he has successfully defeated and reduced to impotence the forces that might have stood against the rule of violence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1938/oct/03/prime-ministers-statement|title=Prime Minister's Statement|volume=339 cc40-162|publisher=Commons and Lords Hansard|date=03 October 1938|accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1937, Attlee visited Spain and visited the [[British Battalion]] of the [[International Brigades]] fighting in the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/> One of the companies was named the 'Major Attlee Company' in his honour.

==Deputy Prime Minister==
[[File:Attlee 1941 P 75.jpg|thumb|Attlee as Lord Privy Seal, visiting a munitions factory in 1941]]
Attlee remained as Leader of the Opposition when the [[Second World War]] broke out in September 1939. The ensuing disastrous [[Norwegian campaign]] would result in a [[Norway debate|motion of no confidence]] in Neville Chamberlain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/norway_campaign_06.shtml|title=BBC – History – The Norway Campaign in World War Two|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|date=30 March 2011|accessdate=2011-10-02}}</ref> Although Chamberlain survived this, the reputation of his administration was so badly and publicly damaged, that it became clear a [[coalition government]] would be necessary. Even if Attlee had personally been prepared to serve under Chamberlain in an emergency coalition government, he would never have been able to carry Labour with him. Consequently, Chamberlain tendered his resignation, and Labour and the Conservatives entered a coalition government led by [[Winston Churchill]].<ref name="Attlee"/>

In the [[Churchill war ministry|coalition government]], three inter-connected committees effectively ran the country. Churchill chaired the first two, the [[War Cabinet]] and the [[Defence Committee]], with Attlee deputising for him in these, and answering for the government in Parliament when Churchill was absent. Attlee himself chaired the third and final body, the [[Lord President's Committee]], which was responsible for domestic affairs. As Churchill was most concerned with overseeing the war effort, this arrangement suited both men.<ref name="Attlee"/> Only Attlee and Churchill would remain in the War Cabinet from the formation of the Government of National Unity in May 1940 through to the election in May 1945. Attlee was initially the [[Lord Privy Seal]], before becoming Britain's first ever [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] in 1942, as well as becoming the [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs|Dominions Secretary]] and the [[Lord President of the Council]]. Attlee supported Churchill in his continuation of Britain's resistance after the French capitulation in 1940, and proved a loyal ally to Churchill throughout the conflict;<ref name="Attlee"/> when the War Cabinet had voted on whether to negotiate peace terms, Attlee—along with fellow Labour minister [[Arthur Greenwood]]—voted in favour of fighting, giving Churchill the majority he needed to continue the war.<ref>Marr, Andrew: ''A History of Modern Britain'' (2009 paperback), p.&nbsp;xv to xvii</ref>

===1945 election===
{{main|United Kingdom general election, 1945}}

Following the defeat of Nazi Germany and the end of the [[European Theatre of World War II|War in Europe]] in May 1945, Attlee and Churchill favoured the coalition government remaining in place until [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] had been defeated. However, [[Herbert Morrison]] made it clear that the Labour Party would not be willing to accept this, and Churchill was forced to tender his resignation as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and call an immediate election.<ref name="Attlee"/> The war had set in motion profound social changes within Britain, and had ultimately led to a widespread popular desire for [[Reform movement|social reform]]. This mood was epitomised in the [[Beveridge Report]] of 1942, by the Liberal economist [[William Beveridge]]. The ''Report'' assumed that the maintenance of full employment would be the aim of post-war governments, and that this would provide the basis for the [[welfare state]]. Immediately on its release, it sold hundreds of thousands of copies. All major parties committed themselves to fulfilling this aim, but most historians say that Attlee's Labour Party were seen by the electorate as the most likely to follow it through.

Labour campaigned on the theme of "Let Us Face the Future", positioning themselves as the party best placed to rebuild Britain after the war, while the Conservative campaign focused entirely around Churchill.<ref group="note">[http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/man/lab45.htm British Labour Party election manifesto, 1945 [Archive&#93;<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> With Churchill's status as a "war hero", many predicted a Conservative victory. Churchill made some costly errors during the campaign. In particular, his suggestion during one radio broadcast that a future Labour Government would require "some form of a [[gestapo]]" to implement their policies was widely regarded as being in very bad taste, and massively backfired.<ref name="Attlee"/> Despite this, the results of the election came as a surprise to most, including Attlee himself, when they were announced on 26 July. Labour had won power by a huge landslide, winning 47.7% of the vote to the Conservatives' 36%. This gave them 393 seats in the House of Commons, a working majority of 146. This was the first time in history that the Labour Party had won a majority in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1945_over.stm BBC NEWS | VOTE2001 | THE ELECTION BATTLES 1945-1997<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> When Attlee went to see [[George VI|King George VI]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] to be appointed Prime Minister, the notoriously laconic Attlee and the famously tongue-tied King stood in silence; Attlee finally volunteered the remark, "I've won the election."

I heard it on the Six O'Clock News."<ref>{{cite book|author=David Kynaston|title=Austerity Britain, 1945-1951|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q7zQx0VRTkgC&pg=PT52|year=2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|page=75|isbn=9780802779588}}</ref>

As [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], Attlee appointed [[Hugh Dalton]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Ernest Bevin]] as [[Foreign Secretary]], and [[Herbert Morrison]] as [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]], with overall responsibility for nationalisation. Additionally, [[Stafford Cripps]] was made [[President of the Board of Trade]], [[Aneurin Bevan]] became [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]], and [[Ellen Wilkinson]], the only woman to serve in Attlee's government, was appointed [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Minister of Education]]. The [[Attlee ministry|Attlee Government]] proved itself to be a radical, reforming government. From 1945 to 1948, over 200 public [[Acts of Parliament]] were passed, with eight major pieces of legislation placed on the statute book in 1946 alone.<ref>''To Build a New Jerusalem: The British Labour Movement from the 1880s to the 1990s'' by A.J. Davies</ref>

===Domestic policy===
Francis (1995) argues there was consensus both in the Labour's national executive committee and at party conferences on a definition of socialism that stressed moral improvement as well as material improvement. The Attlee government was committed to rebuilding British society as an ethical commonwealth, using public ownership and controls to abolish extremes of wealth and poverty. Labour's ideology contrasted sharply with the contemporary Conservative Party's defence of individualism, inherited privileges, and income inequality.<ref>Martin Francis, "Economics and Ethics: The Nature of Labour's Socialism, 1945–1951," ''Twentieth Century British History'' (1995) 6#2 pp 220–243.</ref>

====Health====
[[File:Trafford General Hospital - geograph.org.uk - 21987.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Trafford General Hospital, known as the birthplace of the NHS.]]

Attlee's [[Secretary of State for Health|Health Minister]], [[Aneurin Bevan]], fought hard against the general disapproval of the medical establishment, including the [[British Medical Association]], by creating the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). This was a [[publicly funded health care|publicly funded healthcare system]], which offered treatment free of charge for all at the point of use. Reflecting pent-up demand that had long existed for medical services, the NHS treated some 8.5 million dental patients and dispensed more than 5 million pairs of spectacles during its first year of operation.<ref name="ReferenceA">''The Attlee Governments, 1945–1951'' by Kevin Jefferys</ref> Consultants also benefited from the new system by being paid salaries that provided an acceptable standard of living without the need for them to resort to private practice.<ref>''The Five Giants: A Biography of the Welfare State'' by Nicholas Timmins</ref> The NHS brought major improvements in the health of working-class people, with deaths from diphtheria, pneumonia, and TB significantly reduced.<ref name="autogenerated3">''Mastering Modern World History'' by Norman Lowe, second edition</ref> Although there are often disputes about its organisation and funding, British parties to this day must still voice their general support for the NHS in order to remain electable.<ref>http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/8/4/52.pdf</ref>

In the field of health care, funds were allocated towards modernisation and extension schemes aimed at improving administrative efficiency. Improvements were made in nursing accommodation in order to recruit more nurses and reduce labour shortages which were keeping 60,000 beds out of use, and efforts were made to reduce the imbalance "between an excess of fever and tuberculosis (TB) beds and a shortage of maternity beds."<ref>''Industrial Policy in Britain 1945–1951: Economic Planning, Nationalisation and the Labour Governments'' by Martin Chick</ref> In addition, BCG vaccinations were introduced for the protection of medical students, midwives, nurses, and contacts of patients with TB,<ref>Poverty, inequality and health in Britain, 1800–2000: a reader edited by George Davey Smith, Daniel Dorling, and Mary Shaw</ref> while a pension scheme was set up for employees of the newly established NHS.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=mbv_YPJTKy8C&pg=PA179&dq=NHS+pension+scheme+1948#v=onepage&q=NHS%20pension%20scheme%201948&f=false|title=Issues in Healthcare Risk Management|editors=Stuart Emslie and Charles Hancock|publisher=Healthcare Governance Limited|location=Oxford, UK|date=30 July 2008|accessdate=2012-07-21|isbn=9780955852602|page=179}}</ref> Numerous lesser reforms were also introduced, some of which were of great benefit to certain segments of British society, such as the mentally deficient and the blind.<ref name="autogenerated1964">''British Economic and Social History, 1700–1964'' by C.P.

====Welfare====
The government set about implementing [[William Beveridge]]'s plans for the creation of a 'cradle to grave' [[welfare state]], and set in place an entirely new system of [[social security]]. Among the most important pieces of legislation was the [[National Insurance Act 1946]], in which people in work paid a flat rate of [[national insurance]]. In return, they (and the wives of male contributors) were eligible for flat-rate pensions, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, and funeral benefit. Various other pieces of legislation provided for [[child benefit]] and support for people with no other source of income.<ref name="A History of the British Labour Party"/> The New Towns Act of 1946 set up development corporations to construct new towns, while the Town and Country Planning Act of 1947 instructed county councils to prepare development plans and also provided compulsory purchase powers.<ref name="autogenerated1900"/> The Attlee Government also extended the powers of local authorities to requisition houses and parts of houses, and made the acquisition of land less difficult than before.<ref name="autogenerated1945">The Labour Government 1945–51 by Denis Nowell Pritt</ref> In 1949, local authorities were empowered to provide people suffering from poor health with public housing at subsidised rents.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=eVUXALnSc1cC&pg=PA172&dq=locala+uthorities+granted+powers+provide+those+in+poor+health+subsidised+Rent+1949#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=On Fairness and Efficiency: The Privatisation of the Public Income Over the Past Millennium|author=George Miller|publisher=The Policy Press|location=Bristol, UK|date=2000-01-01||page=172|accessdate=2012-07-21|isbn=9781861342218}}</ref> That same year, unemployment, sickness and maternity benefits were exempted from tax.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/101481|title=HC S [Budget Resolution and Economic Situation&#93;|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date=5 May 1966|accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref>

Development rights were also nationalised while the government attempted to take all development profits for the State. Strong planning authorities were set up to control land use, and issued manuals of guidance which stressed the importance of safeguarding agricultural land. A strong chain of regional offices was set up within its planning ministry to provide a strong lead in regional development policies.<ref>''Labour and Inequality: Sixteen Fabian Essays'' edited by Peter Townsend and Nicholas Bosanquet</ref> Comprehensive Development Areas (CDAs), a designation under the Town and Country Planning Act of 1947, allowed local authorities to acquire property in the designated areas using powers of compulsory purchase in order to re-plan and develop urban areas suffering from urban blight or war damage.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/?id=s0bfRDxf00YC&pg=PA194&dq=UK+Comprehensive+Development+Areas+1947#v=onepage&q=UK%20Comprehensive%20Development%20Areas%201947&f=false|title=Urban and Environmental Economics: An Introduction|isbn=9781136791000|author1=Squires|first1=Graham|date=2012-08-21}}</ref>

A block grant introduced in 1948 helped the social services provided by local authorities.<ref name="ReferenceC">''Labour in Power, 1945–51'' by Kenneth Morgan</ref> Personal Social Services or welfare services were developed in 1948 for individual and families in general, particularly special groups such as the mentally disordered, deprived children, the elderly, and the handicapped.<ref>''Social Services: Made Simple'' by Tony Byrne, BA, BSc(Econ.), and Colin F. Padfield, LLB, DPA(Lond)</ref> The Attlee Government also significantly increased pensions and other benefits, with pensions raised to become more of a living income than they had been. War pensions and allowances (for both world wars) were increased by an Act of 1946 which gave the wounded man with an allowance for his wife and children if he married after he had been wounded, thereby removing a grievance of more than twenty years standing.<ref name="SocialismThe">''Socialism: The British Way'' edited by Donald Munro</ref>

A large house-building programme was carried out with the intention of providing millions of people with high-quality homes.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> A housing bill passed in 1946 increased Treasury subsidies for the construction of local authority housing in England and Wales.<ref name="autogenerated1900">The Longman Companion to The Labour Party 1900–1998 by Harry Harmer</ref> Four out of five houses constructed under Labour were council properties built to more generous specifications than before the Second World War, and subsidies kept down council rents. Altogether, these policies provided public-sector housing with its biggest ever boost up until that point, while low-wage earners particularly benefited from these developments. Although the Attlee Government failed to meet its targets, primarily due to economic constraints, over a million new homes were built between 1945 and 1951 (a significant achievement under the circumstances) which ensured that decent, affordable housing was available to many low-income families for the first time ever.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

A more extensive system of social welfare benefits was established by the Attlee Government, which did much to reduce acute social deprivation. The cumulative impact of the Attlee's Government's health and welfare policies was such that all the indices of health (such as statistics of school medical or dental officers, or of medical officers of health) showed signs of improvement, with continual improvements in survival rates for infants and increased life expectancy for the elderly.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> The success of the Attlee Government's welfare legislation in reducing poverty was such that, in the general election of 1950, according to Kevin Jefferys, "Labour propaganda could make much of the claim that social security had eradicated the most abject destitution of the 1930s".<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

====Women and children====
A number of reforms were embarked upon to improve conditions for women and children. In 1946, universal family allowances were introduced to provide financial support to households for raising children.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11467577|work=BBC News|title=Who, What, Why: Why do the rich get child benefit?|date=4 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:YdHEFfT32noJ:campbeltowngrammar.org.uk/downloads/history/5_year/british_higher/labour-reforms/i-assessment/1945-1951_labour_government.doc+Labour+government+1946+family+allowances&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgaOtfB49c9TMEFcKCx0vUvwvLMyzSWQ9JMXlhiobC4Nc_-tDp2dZDqxDPSU6ylDlCONx_3vjFQ7Fc3VaJMijATeUPQ9lRI_EbAVSjjKj4Wb-s5sWyh0gIQ-oyKgx9L9VZIEDfB&sig=AHIEtbTtOCE2eC5FNXAq-FZF9jaF9PJUvg|title=An Assessment of the Attlee Government|publisher=Docs.google.com|date=|accessdate=2012-07-21}}</ref> These benefits had been legislated for the previous year by Churchill's [[Family Allowances Act 1945]], and was the first measure pushed through parliament by Attlee's government.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=mQBkiNPupvsC&pg=PA199&dq=The+case+for+the+living+wage+by+Jerold+L.+Waltman+1945+Labour+government+family+allowances#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Case for the Living Wage|author=Jerold L.

A Married Women (Restraint Upon Anticipation) Act was passed in 1949 "to equalise, to render inoperative any restrictions upon anticipation or alienation attached to the enjoyment of property by a woman," while the Married Women (Maintenance) Act of 1949 was enacted with the intention of improving the adequacy and duration of financial benefits for married women.<ref>{{cite doi|10.2307/1089590}}</ref> The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 1950 amended an Act of 1885 to bring prostitutes within the law and safeguard them from abduction and abuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://learningeye.net/Mulberry/default.asp?WebPage_ID=492|title=Mulberry|publisher=Learningeye.net|date=9 October 2004|accessdate=2012-07-21}}</ref> The Criminal Justice Act of 1948 restricted imprisonment for juveniles and brought improvements to the probation and remand centres systems, while the passage of the Justices of the Peace Act of 1949 led to extensive reforms of magistrates courts.<ref>''The Longman Companion to the Labour Party, 1900–1998'' by H.J.P. Harmer</ref>

In 1946, the government set up a National Institute of Houseworkers as a means of providing a social democratic variety of domestic service.<ref name="autogenerated5">''Ideas and Policies Under Labour, 1945–1951'' by Martin Francis</ref> The institute aimed to promote domestic service as a skilled craft, by means of training and by examination of those who already had the necessary qualifications. By the autumn of 1946, agreed standards of training were established, which was followed by the opening of a training headquarters and the opening of an additional 9 training centres in Wales, Scotland, and then throughout Great Britain. The National Health Service Act of 1946 indicated that domestic help should be provided for households where that help is required "owing to the presence of any person who is ill, lying-in, an expectant mother, mentally defective, aged or a child not over compulsory school age". 'Home help' therefore included the provision of home-helps for nursing and expectant mothers and for mothers with children under the age of five, and by 1952 some 20,000 women were engaged in this service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calmarchive.londonmet.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Persons&dsqSearch=Code=='NA787'&dsqCmd=Show.tcl|title=The Women's Library Special Collections Catalogue|publisher=Calmarchive.londonmet.ac.uk|date=9 July 1952|accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref>

====Workers' rights====
Various measures were carried out to improve conditions in the workplace. Entitlement to sick leave was greatly extended, and sick pay schemes were introduced for local authority administrative, professional and technical workers in 1946 and for various categories of manual workers in 1948.<ref>''Poverty in the United Kingdom: A Survey of Household Resources and Standards of Living'' by Peter Townsend</ref> Worker's compensation was also significantly improved.<ref>''Social Democracy & Welfare Capitalism: A Century of Income Security Politics'' by Alexander M.

The London dock strike of July 1949, led by Communists, was suppressed when the Attlee government sent in 13,000 Army troops and passed special legislation to promptly end the strike. His response reveals Attlee's growing concern that Soviet expansionism, supported by the British Communist Party, was a genuine threat to national security, and that the docks were highly vulnerable to sabotage ordered by Moscow. He noted that the strike was caused not by local grievances but in order to help Communist unions who were on strike in Canada. Attlee agreed with MI5 that he faced, "a very present menace."<ref>Phillip Deery, "'A Very Present Menace'? Attlee, Communism and the Cold War," '' Australian Journal of Politics and History'' (1998) 44#1 pp 69–93.</ref>

====Nationalisation====
[[File:The first emblem of British Railways (6870888583).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Britain's railways and other industries were nationalised under the Attlee government.]]
Attlee's government also carried out their manifesto commitment for [[nationalisation]] of basic industries and public utilities. The [[Bank of England]] and civil aviation were nationalised in 1946. [[National Coal Board|Coal mining]], the [[British Railways|railways]], road haulage, canals and [[Cable & Wireless Worldwide|Cable and Wireless]] were nationalised in 1947, electricity and gas followed in 1948. The [[Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain|steel industry]] was nationalised in 1951. By 1951 about 20% of the British economy had been taken into [[public ownership]].<ref name="A History of the British Labour Party"/>

In spite of the hopes of many on the left, nationalisation failed to provide workers with a greater say in the running of the industries in which they worked. It did, however, bring about significant material gains for workers in the form of higher wages, reduced working hours,<ref>''The Labour Governments, 1945–51'' by Henry Pelling</ref> and improvements in working conditions, especially in regards to safety.<ref>''Britain in the Twentieth Century'' by Ian Cawood</ref> As historian [[Eric Shaw]] noted of the years following nationalisation, the electricity and gas supply companies became "impressive models of public enterprise" in terms of efficiency, and the [[National Coal Board]] was not only profitable, but working conditions for miners had significantly improved as well.<ref name="ReferenceB">''The Labour Party since 1945'' by Eric Shaw</ref> Within a few years of nationalisation, a number of progressive measures had been carried out which did much to improve conditions in the mines, including better pay, a five-day working week, a national safety scheme (with proper standards at all the collieries), a ban on boys under the age of 16 going underground, the introduction of training for newcomers before going down to the coalface, and the making of pithead baths into a standard facility.<ref>Austerity Britain 1945–1951 by David Kynaston</ref> In addition, the newly established [[National Coal Board]] offered sick pay and holiday pay to miners.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/intermediate2/history/cradle_to_the_grave/welfare_state/revision/11/ BBC - Intermediate 2 Bitesize History - The Labour Government 1945 -51 - The Welfare State : Revision, Page 11<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> As noted by Martin Francis

<blockquote>"Union leaders saw nationalisation as a means to pursue a more advantageous position within a framework of continued conflict, rather than as an opportunity to replace the old adversarial form of industrial relations. Moreover, most workers in nationalised industries exhibited an essentially instrumentalist attitude, favouring public ownership because it secured job security and improved wages rather than because it promised the creation of a new set of socialists relationships in the workplace."<ref name="autogenerated5"/></blockquote>

====Agriculture====
The Attlee Government placed strong emphasis on improving the quality of life in rural areas, benefiting both farmers and other consumers. Security of tenure for farmers was introduced, while consumers were protected by food subsidies and the redistributive effects of deficiency payments. Between 1945 and 1951, the quality of rural life was improved by improvements in gas, electricity, and water services, as well as in leisure and public amenities. In addition, the 1947 Transport Act improved provision of rural bus services, while the [[Agriculture Act 1947]] established a more generous subsidy system for farmers.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Legislation was also passed in 1947 and 1948 which established a permanent Agricultural Wages Board to fix minimum wages for agricultural workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/farming-agriculture-acts.htm|title=The Cabinet Papers &#124; Farming and the Agriculture Acts|publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate=2011-10-02}}</ref><ref>The State and the Farmer by Peter Self and Herbert J. Storing</ref> The Attlee Government also made it possible for farm workers to borrow up to 90% of the cost of building their own houses, and received a subsidy of £15 a year for 40 years towards that cost.<ref name="autogenerated5"/>

At a time of world food shortages, it was vital that farmers produced the maximum possible quantities. The government encouraged farmers via subsidies for modernisation, while the National Agricultural Advisory Service provided expertise and price guarantees. As a result of the Attlee Government's initiatives in agriculture, there was a 20% increase in output between 1947 and 1952, while Britain adopted one of the most mechanised and efficient farming industries in the world.<ref name="autogenerated3"/>

====Education====
The Attlee Government ensured provisions of the [[Education Act 1944]] were fully implemented, with free secondary education becoming a right for the first time. Fees in state grammar schools were eliminated, while new, modern secondary schools were constructed.<ref>''Industrialisation and Society: A Social History, 1830–1951'' by Eric Hopkins</ref> The school leaving age was raised to 15 in 1947, an accomplishment helped brought into fruition by initiatives such as the H.O.R.S.A. ("Huts Operation for Raising the School-leaving Age") scheme and the S.F.O.R.S.A. (furniture) scheme.<ref name="lib-161.lse.ac.uk">http://lib-161.lse.ac.uk/archives/fabian_tracts/274.pdf</ref> Increased Treasury funds were made available for education, particularly for upgrading school buildings suffering from years of neglect and war damage.<ref name="autogenerated2">''The Labour Party since 1945'' by Kevin Jefferys</ref> Prefabricated classrooms were also built and 928 new primary schools were constructed between 1945 and 1950.

A Ministry of Education was established, and free County Colleges were set up for the compulsory part-time instruction of teenagers between the ages of 15 and 18 who were not in full-time education.<ref>Higher School Certificate History by B. Hodge, B.A. (Hons.) and W.L.

This reform was eventually carried out by [[Harold Wilson's]] government. During its time in office, the Attlee Government increased spending on education by over 50%, from £6.5 billion to £10 billion.<ref name="autogenerated4"/>

====Economy====
The most significant problem facing Attlee and his ministers remained the economy, as the [[war effort]] had left Britain nearly bankrupt. The war had cost Britain about a quarter of her national wealth. Overseas investments had been used up to pay for the war. The transition to a peacetime economy, and the maintaining of strategic military commitments abroad led to continuous and severe problems with the [[balance of trade]]. This resulted in strict [[rationing]] of food and other essential goods continuing in the post war period to force a reduction in consumption in an effort to limit [[imports]], boost [[export]]s, and stabilise the Pound Sterling so that Britain could trade its way out of its financial state.

The abrupt end of the American [[Lend-Lease]] program in August 1945 almost caused a crisis. Some relief was provided by the [[Anglo-American loan]], negotiated in December 1945. The conditions attached to the loan included making the [[pound sterling|pound]] fully [[convertibility|convertible]] to the [[American dollar|dollar]]. When this was introduced in July 1947, it led to a [[currency crisis]] and convertibility had to be suspended after just five weeks.<ref name="A History of the British Labour Party"/> Britain also benefited from the American [[Marshall Aid]] program in 1948, and the economic situation improved significantly. Another balance of payments crisis in 1949 forced Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Stafford Cripps]], into devaluation of the pound.<ref name="A History of the British Labour Party"/>

Despite these problems, one of the main achievements of Attlee's government was the maintenance of near [[full employment]]. The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and [[unemployment]] rarely rose above 500,000, or 3% of the total workforce.<ref name="A History of the British Labour Party"/> Labour shortages proved to be a more frequent problem. The inflation rate was also kept low during his term.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The rate of unemployment rarely rose above 2% during Attlee's time in office, whilst there was no hard-core of long-term unemployed. Both production and productivity rose as a result of new equipment, while the average working week was shortened.<ref>''England in the Twentieth Century (1914–63)'' by David Thompson</ref>

The government was less successful in housing, which was the responsibility of Aneurin Bevan. The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built. Nevertheless, millions of people were rehoused as a result of the Attlee government's housing policies. Between August 1945 and December 1951, 1,016,349 new homes were completed in England, Scotland, and Wales.<ref>''Labour in power, 1945–1951'' by Kenneth Morgan</ref>

When the Attlee Government was voted out of office in 1951, the economy had been improved compared to 1945. The period from 1946 to 1951 saw continuous full employment and steadily rising living standards, which increased by about 10% each year. During that same period, the economy grew by 3% a year, and by 1951 the United Kingdom had "the best economic performance in Europe, while output per person was increasing faster than in the United States."<ref>''Ten Years of New Labour'', edited by Matt Beech and Simon Lee</ref> Careful planning after 1945 also ensured that demobilisation was carried out without having a negative impact upon economic recovery, and that unemployment stayed at very low levels.<ref name="autogenerated2"/> In addition, the number of motor cars on the roads rose from 3 million to 5 million from 1945 to 1951, and seaside holidays were taken by far more people than ever before.<ref name="autogenerated1964"/>

====Energy====
1947 proved to be a particularly difficult year for the government; an [[Winter of 1946–1947 in the United Kingdom|exceptionally cold winter]] that year caused coal mines to freeze and cease production, creating widespread [[power cuts]] and food shortages. The [[Ministry of Fuel and Power|Minister of Fuel and Power]], [[Emanuel Shinwell]], became a scapegoat for the crisis and was widely blamed for failing to ensure adequate coal stocks, and soon resigned from his post. The Conservatives capitalised on the crisis with the slogan 'Starve with Strachey and shiver with Shinwell' (referring to the Minister of Food [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Dominic Sandbrook|url=http://www.jubileeriver.co.uk/100110%20-%20winter%20of%201947.htm|title=Winter of 1947|publisher=Jubileeriver.co.uk|date=9 January 2010|accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref>

The crisis led to an unsuccessful plot by [[Hugh Dalton]] to replace Attlee as Prime Minister with [[Ernest Bevin]]. Later that year Stafford Cripps tried to persuade Attlee to stand aside for Bevin. These plots petered out after Bevin refused to cooperate.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/> Later that year, [[Hugh Dalton]] resigned as Chancellor after inadvertently leaking details of the budget to a journalist. He was replaced by Cripps.

===Foreign policy===
[[File:Potsdam big three.jpg|thumb|Attlee with [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] at the 1945 [[Potsdam Conference]].]]

====Europe and the Cold War====
In foreign affairs, the Attlee Government was concerned with four main issues; post-war [[Europe]], the onset of the [[Cold War]], the establishment of the [[United Nations]], and decolonisation. The first two were closely related, and Attlee was assisted by [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Ernest Bevin]]. Attlee also attended the later stages of the [[Potsdam Conference]], where he negotiated with President [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Joseph Stalin]].

In the immediate aftermath of the war, the Government faced the challenge of managing relations with Britain's former war-time ally, Stalin and the [[Soviet Union]]. Ernest Bevin was a passionate [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], based largely on his experience of fighting communist influence in the trade union movement. Bevin's initial approach to the USSR as Foreign Secretary was "wary and suspicious, but not automatically hostile".<ref>Morgan, ''Labour in Power''.</ref> Attlee himself sought warm relations with Stalin. He put his trust in the United Nations, rejected notions that the Soviet Union was bent on world conquest, and warned that treating Moscow as an enemy would turn it into one. This put Attlee at sword's point with his foreign minister, the Foreign Office, and the military who all saw the Soviets as a growing threat to Britain's role in the Middle East. Suddenly in January 1947, Attlee reversed his position and agreed with Bevin on a hard-line anti-Soviet policy.<ref>Raymond Smith and John Zametica, "The Cold Warrior: Clement Attlee reconsidered, 1945–7," ''International Affairs'' (1985) 61#2 pp 237–52</ref>

In an early "good-will" gesture that was later heavily criticised, the Attlee Government allowed the Soviets access, under the terms of a 1946 UK-USSR [[Trade pact|Trade Agreement]], to several [[Rolls-Royce Nene]] [[jet engine]]s. The Soviets, who at the time were well behind the West in jet technology, [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] the Nene and installed their own version in the [[Mikoyan–Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] interceptor, used to good effect against US-UK forces in the subsequent [[Korean War]], as well as in several later MiG models.<ref>Yefim Gordon, ''Mikoyan–Gurevich MIG-15: The Soviet Union's Long-Lived Korean War Fighter'', Midland Press (2001)</ref>

After Stalin took political control of most of [[Eastern Europe]], and began to subvert other governments in the Balkans, Attlee's and Bevin's worst fears of Soviet intentions were realized. The Attlee Government then became instrumental in the creation of the successful [[NATO]] defence alliance to protect [[Western Europe]] against any Soviet aggression.<ref>See, e.g., Kenneth O. Morgan, ''Labour in Power'' (Oxford, 1984), especially Chapter 6.</ref> In a crucial contribution to the economic stability of post-war Europe, Attlee's Cabinet was instrumental in promoting the American [[Marshall Plan]] for the economic recovery of Europe.

A group of Labour MPs, organised under the banner of "[[Keep Left (pamphlet)|Keep Left]]", urged the government to steer a middle way between the two emerging superpowers, and advocated the creation of a "third force" of European powers to stand between the US and USSR. However, deteriorating relations between Britain and the USSR, as well as Britain's economic reliance on America following the Marshall Plan, steered policy towards supporting the US.<ref name="A History of the British Labour Party"/> In January 1947, fear of Soviet and American nuclear intentions led to a secret meeting of the Cabinet, where the decision was made to press ahead with the development of Britain's independent [[nuclear deterrent]], an issue which later caused a split in the Labour Party. Britain's first successful nuclear test, however, did not occur until 1952, one year after Attlee had left office.<ref name="A History of the British Labour Party"/>

[[File:Bevin Attlee H 42138.jpg|thumb|Foreign Secretary [[Ernest Bevin]] (left) with Clement Attlee in 1945.]]

====Decolonisation====
The Attlee Government was responsible for beginning the process of [[decolonisation]] of the [[British Empire]], starting by [[History of India|granting independence to India]]. Attlee appointed [[Lord Louis Mountbatten]] to be the [[Viceroy of India]] when he first became Prime Minister, and agreed to Mountbatten's request for [[plenipotentiary]] powers for negotiating Indian independence. In view of implacable demands by the political leadership of, in particular, the Islamic community in British India for a separate Muslim homeland, Mountbatten conceded the notion of two nations consisting of a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan (which incorporated [[East Pakistan]], now [[Bangladesh]]).

The drawing of borders was accomplished at the cost of large-scale population movements and heavy communal bloodshed on both sides. The independence of [[Burma]] and [[Ceylon]] was also negotiated around this time. Some of the new countries became [[Dominion|British Dominions]], the genesis of the modern [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name="A History of the British Labour Party"/>

One of the most urgent problems concerned the future of the [[Palestine Mandate]]. British policies there were perceived by the [[Zionist]] movement and the Truman Administration as pro-Arab and anti-Jewish. In the face of an armed revolt of Jewish militant groups and increasing violence of the local Arab population, Britain had found itself unable to control events. This was a very unpopular commitment, and the evacuation of [[British Army|British troops]] and subsequent handing over of the issue to the [[United Nations]] was widely supported by the public.<ref name="A History of the British Labour Party"/>

The government's policies with regard to the other colonies, particularly those in [[Africa]], were very different. A major [[military base]] was built in [[Kenya]], and the African colonies came under an unprecedented degree of direct control from London. Development schemes were implemented to help solve Britain's desperate post-war [[balance of payments]] crisis and raise African [[Standard of living|living standards]]. This "new colonialism" was generally a failure, at times even spectacularly so, such as the [[Tanganyika groundnut scheme]].<ref name="A History of the British Labour Party"/>

===Final days===
Attlee's record for settling internal differences in the Labour Party fell in April 1951, when [[Aneurin Bevan]] and [[Harold Wilson]] resigned in a policy dispute. A decade of turmoil ensued in the Party, much to the advantage of the Conservatives who won again and again by ever larger majorities.

The [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950 election]] gave Labour a greatly reduced parliamentary majority, a mere five seats compared to the triple-digit majority of five years previous. The mediocre result was blamed on post-war austerity denting Labour's appeal to middle class voters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393273.stm|work=BBC News|title=1950: Labour majority slashed|date=5 April 2005}}</ref> Attlee's second term was tame compared to his first. Some reforms were passed regarding industry in development areas and pollution.<ref>Kenneth O. Morgan, ''Labour in Power 1945–1951'' (1985) pp 409–61</ref>

By 1951, the Attlee Government was exhausted, with several of its most important ministers ailing, ageing or gone, and no one representing new ideas.<ref>Morgan, ''Labour in Power 1945-1951'' (1985) p 460</ref> The party fatally split in 1951 over an austerity Budget brought in by the Chancellor, [[Hugh Gaitskell]], to pay for the cost of Britain's participation in the [[Korean War]]. [[Aneurin Bevan]] resigned to protest against the new charges for "teeth and spectacles" introduced by that Budget, and was joined in this action by several ministers, including the future Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]].<ref name="A History of the British Labour Party"/>

Finding it impossible to govern, Attlee called a [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|general election in 1951]], attempting to achieve a more workable majority. However, Labour went on to lose the election to Churchill's renewed Conservatives. Attlee's short list of [[1951 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Resignation Honours]], announced in November 1951, included an Earldom for [[William Jowitt]], Lord Chancellor.<ref>''The Times'', 30 November 1951; p. 6; Issue 52172; col G: "The Resignation Honours: Earldom For Lord Jowitt".</ref>

His term as Prime Minister of six years and 92 days was the longest unbroken time spent by any Labour Leader as Prime Minister until [[Tony Blair]] more than 50 years later. Although [[Harold Wilson]] did manage a total of almost eight years as Prime Minister, that took place across two different spells between 1964 and 1976.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3107623.stm|work=BBC News|title=Labour's PMs of the past|date=30 July 2003}}</ref>

==Retirement==
Following the defeat in 1951, Attlee continued to lead the party as Leader of the Opposition. His last four years as leader were, however, widely seen as one of the Labour Party's weaker periods.<ref name="A History of the British Labour Party">Thorpe, Andrew. (2001) ''A History of the British Labour Party'', Palgrave, ISBN 0-333-92908-X</ref> The party split between its right wing, led by [[Hugh Gaitskell]], and its left, led by [[Aneurin Bevan]]. Many Labour MPs felt that Attlee should have retired after the 1951 election and allowed a younger man to lead the party. Bevan openly called for him to stand down in the summer of 1954.<ref>Williams, Charles ''Harold Macmillan'' (2009) p. 221</ref> One of his main reasons for staying on as leader was to frustrate the leadership ambitions of [[Herbert Morrison]], whom Attlee disliked for political and personal reasons.<ref name="A History of the British Labour Party"/> At one time, Attlee had favoured Aneurin Bevan to succeed him as leader, but this became problematic after Bevan almost irrevocably split the party.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/>

In an interview with the ''[[News Chronicle]]'' columnist [[Percy Cudlipp]] in mid-September 1955, Attlee made clear his own thinking together with his preference for the leadership succession, stating: "Labour has nothing to gain by dwelling in the past. Nor do I think we can impress the nation by adopting a futile left-wingism. I regard myself as Left of Centre which is where a Party Leader ought to be. It is no use asking, 'What would [[Keir Hardie]] have done?' We must have at the top men brought up in the present age, not, as I was, in the Victorian Age."<ref>Leading The Left by Peter Shore</ref>

Attlee, now 72 years of age, contested the [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1955 general election]] against [[Anthony Eden]], which saw the Conservative majority increase from seventeen to sixty. He retired as Leader of the Labour Party on 25 November 1955, having led Labour for twenty years, and was succeeded by [[Hugh Gaitskell]].<ref name="Attlee"/>

[[File:Earl Attlee COA.svg|thumb|[[Coat of arms]] of the [[Earl Attlee|Earls Attlee]]]]
He subsequently retired from the Commons and was elevated to the peerage to take his seat in the [[House of Lords]] as '''[[Earl Attlee]]''' and '''Viscount Prestwood''' on 16 December 1955. In 1958 he was, along with [[Bertrand Russell]], one of a group of notables to establish the [[Homosexual Law Reform Society]]. The society campaigned for the decriminalisation of homosexual acts in private by consenting adults, a reform which was voted through parliament nine years later.

He attended Churchill's funeral in January 1965. He was elderly and frail by that time. and had to remain seated in the freezing cold as the coffin was carried, having tired himself out by standing at the rehearsal the previous day. After the service, Attlee had to be helped down the steps of St Paul's Cathedral by Sir [[Anthony Eden]] and a Guards officer.

A heavy pipe and cigarette smoker from an early age, Attlee had breathing problems in his later years. He lived to see Labour return to power under [[Harold Wilson]] in 1964, but also to see his old constituency of [[Walthamstow West (UK Parliament constituency)|Walthamstow West]] fall to the Conservatives in a by-election in September 1967. He died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 84 at [[Westminster Hospital]] on 8 October 1967.<ref name="Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett"/>

On his death, the title passed to his son [[Martin Richard Attlee, 2nd Earl Attlee]] (1927–91). It is now held by Clement Attlee's grandson [[John Richard Attlee, 3rd Earl Attlee]]. The third earl (a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]) retained his seat in the Lords as one of the [[hereditary peer]]s to remain under an amendment to Labour's 1999 [[House of Lords Act]].

When Attlee died, his estate was sworn for probate purposes at a value of £7,295, a relatively modest sum for so prominent a figure. He was cremated and his ashes buried in the nave of [[Westminster Abbey]], close to those of [[Sidney James Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Lord Passfield]] and [[Ernest Bevin]].

==Legacy==
"A modest man, but then he has so much to be modest about", is a quote about Attlee that is very commonly ascribed to Churchill (although Churchill in fact denied saying it, and respected Attlee's service in the War Cabinet).<ref>Walter L. Arnstein, ''Britain Yesterday and Today: 1830 to the Present'', Chapter 19, p. 363</ref> Attlee's modesty and quiet manner hid a great deal that has only come to light with historical reappraisal. In terms of the [[machinery of government]], he was one of the most businesslike and effective of all the [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|British prime ministers]]. Indeed he is widely praised by his successors, both Labour and Conservative.

His leadership style of consensual government, acting as a chairman rather than a president, won him much praise from historians and politicians alike. [[Christopher Soames]], Britain's Ambassador to France during the government of [[Edward Heath]] and cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher, remarked that "Mrs. Thatcher was not really running a team. Every time you have a Prime Minister who wants to make all the decisions, it mainly leads to bad results. Attlee didn't. That's why he was so damn good."<ref>Peter Hennessy, ''The Prime Minister: The Office and its Holders since 1945'', Chapter 7, p. 150</ref> Even Thatcher herself wrote in her 1995 memoirs, which charted her beginnings in [[Grantham]] to her victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 General Election]], that she admired Attlee, writing: "Of Clement Attlee, however, I was an admirer. He was a serious man and a patriot. Quite contrary to the general tendency of politicians in the 1990s, he was all substance and no show".

Attlee's administration presided over the successful transition from a [[war economy|wartime economy]] to peacetime, tackling problems of demobilisation, shortages of [[Currency|foreign currency]], and adverse deficits in trade balances and [[Government spending|government expenditure]]. Further domestic policies that he brought about included the establishment of the [[National Health Service]] and post-war [[Welfare State]], which became key to the reconstruction of post-war Britain. Attlee and his ministers did much to transform Britain into a more prosperous and egalitarian society during their time in office with reductions in poverty and a rise in the general economic security of the population.<ref>''Labour's First Century'' by Duncan Tanner, Pat Thane, and Nick Tiratsoo</ref>

In foreign affairs, he did much to assist with the post-war economic recovery of Europe. He proved a loyal ally of America at the onset of the cold war. Because of his style of leadership it was not he but Ernest Bevin who masterminded foreign policy. It was Attlee's government that decided Britain should have an independent atomic weapons programme, and work began on it in 1947. Bevin, Attlee's Foreign Secretary, famously stated that "We've got to have it and it's got to have a bloody [[Union Flag|Union Jack]] on it." The first operational [[Operation Hurricane|British A Bomb]] was not detonated until October 1952, about one year after Attlee had left office.

Though a socialist, Attlee still believed in the British Empire of his youth. He thought of it as an institution that was a power for good in the world. Nevertheless, he saw that a large part of it needed to be self-governing. Using the Dominions of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand as a model, he began the transformation of the Empire into the Commonwealth.

His greatest achievement, surpassing many of these, was, perhaps, the establishment of a political and economic consensus about the governance of Britain that all parties, whether [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] or [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] subscribed to for three decades, fixing the arena of political discourse until the later 1970s.

Several years after his death, a street on a new housing development in [[Tividale]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], was named Attlee Close in his memory. The Birks Holt social housing estate in [[Maltby, South Yorkshire]] has its streets named after Labour politicians, including Attlee, [[Sir Stafford Cripps]], [[Hugh Gaitskell]] and [[George Lansbury]].

On 30 November 1988, a bronze statue of Clement Attlee was unveiled by [[Harold Wilson]] (the next Labour prime minister after Attlee) outside Limehouse Library in his former constituency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.is/nAS2|title=December03|publisher=Btinternet.com|date=30 November 1988|accessdate=2011-10-02}}</ref> By then Wilson was the last surviving member of Attlee's cabinet<ref>[http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/UEL/TH051.htm ]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref> and the unveiling of the statue would be the last public appearance by Wilson, who was by then in the first stages of [[Alzheimer's Disease]] and who died in May 1995 after a decade of ill health.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/harold-wilson-2/|title=Harold Wilson|publisher=Number 10|date=|accessdate=2011-10-02}}</ref> In April 2011, Limehouse Library having closed in 2003, the Attlee statue was unveiled in its new home at [[Queen Mary University of London]].<ref name=statue2qmul>{{cite web|title=Lord Mandelson joins Lord Hennessy to unveil Clement Attlee statue|url=http://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/items/hss/46923.html|publisher=[[Queen Mary University of London]]|accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref> Attlee was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of Queen Mary College on 15 December 1948.<ref>''The Times'', 16 December 1948, page 3</ref> A [[blue plaque]] unveiled in 1979 commemorates Attlee at 17 Monkhams Avenue, in Woodford Green in the London borough of Redbridge.<ref name='EngHet'>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/attlee-richard-clement-1883-1976|title=ATTLEE, RICHARD CLEMENT (1883–1976)|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref>

===Public image===
In 1956 he was painted by the famous Scottish portrait artist, [[Cowan Dobson]], who also later painted [[Harold Wilson]].

Although possessed of a genial personality, Clement Attlee was notably taciturn in his relations with the press, sometimes offering only monosyllabic answers to reporters' questions. He was seldom referred to by his forename; usually he was referred to as "C. R. Attlee" or "Mr. Attlee".

==Religious views==
Although one of his brothers became a clergyman and one of his sisters a [[missionary]], Attlee himself is usually regarded as an [[agnostic]]. In an interview he described himself as "incapable of religious feeling", saying that he believed in "the ethics of Christianity" but not "the mumbo-jumbo". When asked whether he was an agnostic, Attlee replied "I don't know".<ref>{{cite book|title=Clement Attlee|first=Jerry Hardman|last=Brookshire|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=New York|year=1995|isbn=0-7190-3244-X|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Tn27AAAAIAAJ|page=15}}</ref>

==Appearance in popular culture==
===Literature===
Attlee composed this limerick about himself to demonstrate how he was often underestimated:<ref>Jones, B., Barry Jones' ''Dictionary of World Biography'', 1998</ref>
<blockquote><poem>Few thought he was even a starter.
There were many who thought themselves smarter.
But he finished PM,
CH and OM,
An earl and a Knight of the Garter.</poem></blockquote>

An alternative version also exists, which may reflect Attlee's use of English more closely:<ref>Source: Kenneth Harris, "Attlee" (Weidenfeld and Nicholson, London, 1982)</ref>
<blockquote><poem>There were few who thought him a starter,
Many who thought themselves smarter.
But he ended PM,
CH and OM,
an Earl and a Knight of the Garter.</poem></blockquote>

===Music===
* [[Lord Beginner]]'s song "General Election" was inspired by Attlee's victory in the 1950 British general election.
