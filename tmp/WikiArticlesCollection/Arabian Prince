'''Mik Lezan''' (born June 17, 1965<ref>http://westcoastpioneers.com/artists/arabian-prince.html</ref>), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Arabian Prince''', is an American [[rapping|rapper]] and [[hip hop production|hip hop producer]], best known for being an original member of the rap group, [[N.W.A]].

==Biography==
He started working with [[Bobby Jimmy & the Critters]] in 1984. He also produced the hit single and album for [[JJ Fad]], "Supersonic."

He was a founding member of N.W.A. but when fellow member Ice Cube came back from the Phoenix Institute of Technology in 1988 he found himself to be surplus to the band — [[Eazy-E]], [[Ice Cube]] and [[MC Ren]] were the main performers, [[DJ Yella]] was the [[turntablist]] and [[Dr. Dre]] was the main producer.

After leaving N.W.A., Arabian Prince began his solo career. His first solo album ''Brother Arab'' was released in 1989, although it sold poorly.

Arabian Prince continued his solo career and released his fourth album ''Where's My Bytches'' in 1993, which was his last album of the 1990s.

He recently{{When|date=January 2012}} started releasing music again with his Professor X project on the Dutch label Clone records. In 2007, he performed as a DJ on the 2K Sports Holiday Bounce Tour with artists from the [[Stones Throw]] label.  In 2008, Stones Throw released a compilation of his electro-rap material from the 1980s.<ref>[http://stonesthrow.com/arabianprince/ Arabian Prince | Stones Throw Records<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> One of his songs was included on the 2007 video game ''[[College Hoops 2K8]]''.
