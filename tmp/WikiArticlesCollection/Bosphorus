The '''Bosphorus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɒ|s|f|ər|ə|s}}) or '''Bosporus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɒ|s|p|ər|ə|s}}, {{lang-tr|Boğaziçi}}, {{lang-el|[[wikt:Βόσπορος|Βόσπορος]]}}, ''Vosporos''), also referred to sometimes as the '''[[Istanbul]] Strait''' ({{lang-tr|İstanbul Boğazı}}), is a [[strait]] that forms part of the boundary between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. The Bosphorus, the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Dardanelles]] strait to the southwest together form the [[Turkish Straits]]. The world's narrowest strait used for [[International waterway|international navigation]], the Bosphorus connects the [[Black Sea]] with the [[Sea of Marmara]] (which is connected by the Dardanelles to the [[Aegean Sea]], and thereby to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]).

The limits of the Bosphorus are defined as the connecting line between the lighthouses [[Rumeli Feneri]] and [[Anadolu Feneri]] in the north and between the [[Ahırkapı Feneri]] and the [[Kadıköy İnciburnu Feneri]] in the south. Between the limits, the strait is {{convert|31|km|nmi|abbr=on}} long, with a width of {{convert|3329|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the northern entrance and {{convert|2826|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the southern entrance. Its maximum width is {{convert|3420|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between Umuryeri and Büyükdere Limanı, and minimum width {{convert|700|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between [[Kandilli, Üsküdar|Kandilli Point]] and [[Aşiyan]]. This part of the strait is a dangerous point for maritime traffic: a 45-degree course alteration is required, and the current can reach {{convert|7|to|8|kn|m/s|abbr=out}}. To the south, at [[Yeniköy, Istanbul|Yeniköy]], the necessary course alteration is 80 degrees. All the dangers and obstacles characteristic of narrow waterways are present and acute in this critical sea lane. At the above mentioned turns ([[Kandilli, Üsküdar|Kandilli]] and [[Yeniköy, Istanbul|Yeniköy]]) where significant course alterations have to be made, the rear and forward sights are totally blocked prior to and during the course alteration. Ships approaching from the opposite direction cannot be seen round these bends. The risks posed by geography are increased dramatically by the heavy ferry traffic across the strait, linking the European and Asian sides of the city.<ref name="d">{{cite web |url=http://www.denizcilik.gov.tr/tr/egitim/dugm/bogazlar.doc  |publisher=Denizcilik |title=Türk Boğazları ve Marmara Denizi'nin Coğrafi Konumu-İstanbul Boğazı|language=Turkish|accessdate=2010-09-18 }} {{dead link|date=December 2013}}</ref>

The depth of Bosphorus varies from {{convert|13|to|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} in midstream with an average of {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The deepest location is between Kandilli and [[Bebek, Istanbul|Bebek]] with {{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The most shallow locations are off Kadıköy İnciburnu on the northward route with {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and off Aşiyan Point on the southward route with {{convert|13|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="d"/>

The shores of the strait are heavily populated, straddled as it is by the city of [[Istanbul]] (with a [[metropolitan area]] [[population]] in excess of 12 million inhabitants) which extends inland from both coasts.

The name comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Bosporos'' (Βόσπορος),<ref name="Bosporos">Entry: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2320416 '''{{lang|grc|Βόσπορος}}'''] at Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, 1940, ''A Greek-English Lexicon''.</ref> which the ancient Greeks analysed as ''bous'' {{lang|grc|[[wikt:βοῦς|βοῦς]]}} 'ox' + ''poros'' {{lang|grc|[[wikt:πόρος|πόρος]]}} 'means of passing a river, ford, ferry', thus meaning '[[ox]]-[[Ford (crossing)|ford]]', which is a reference to [[Io (mythology)|Io]] from Greek mythology who was transformed into a cow and condemned to wander the earth until she crossed the Bosphorus where she met [[Prometheus]]. Although it has been known for a while that the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara flow into each other in an example of a density flow, findings of a study by the University of Leeds in August 2010 reveal that there is in fact an underwater channel of high-density water flowing across the floor of the Bosphorus (caused by the difference in density of the two seas), which would be the sixth largest river on Earth if it were to be on land.<ref name="leeds.ac.uk">http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/866/leeds_researchers_study_undersea_rivers_with_a_yellow_submarine</ref>

== Formation ==
{{Main|Black Sea deluge theory}}
[[File:Turkish Strait disambig.svg|thumb|A map depicting the location of the Bosphorus (red) relative to the [[Dardanelles]] (yellow) and the [[Sea of Marmara]], which together form the [[Turkish Straits]].]]

The exact cause for the formation of the Bosphorus remains the subject of debate among geologists. Thousands of years ago, the [[Black Sea]] became disconnected from the [[Aegean Sea]].  The [[Black Sea deluge theory]] (published in 1997 by William Ryan and [[Walter C. Pitman, III|Walter Pitman]] from [[Columbia University]]) contends that the Bosphorus was formed about 5600 BC when the rising waters of the Mediterranean/[[Sea of Marmara]] breached through to the Black Sea, which at the time (according to the theory) was a low-lying body of fresh water.

It is also said in myth that floating rocks known as the [[Symplegades]] or Clashing Rocks once crushed any ship that attempted passage of the Bosphorus until the hero [[Jason]] obtained passage, whereupon the rocks became fixed, and Greek access to the Black Sea was opened.

As part of the only passage between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, the Bosphorus has always been of great commercial and strategic importance. The Greek city-state of [[Athens]] in the 5th century BC, which was dependent on grain imports from [[Scythia]], maintained critical alliances with cities which controlled the straits, such as the [[Megara|Megarian]] colony [[Byzantium]].

Persian King [[Darius I]] the Great, in an attempt to subdue the [[Scythia]]n horsemen who roamed across the north of the [[Black Sea]], crossed through the Bosphorus, then marched towards the [[Danube|Danube River]]. His army crossed the Bosphorus over an enormous bridge made by connecting [[Achaemenid]] boats.<ref>Polybios, Historiae IV, 39, 16; [[Özhan Öztürk]].

Ankara, 2011 pp. 28–32</ref>

The strategic significance of the strait was one of the factors in the decision of the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] the Great to found there in AD 330 his new capital, [[Constantinople]], which came to be known as the capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. On 29 May 1453 it was [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered]] by the emerging [[Ottoman Empire]]. In fact, as the Ottoman Turks closed in on Constantinople, they constructed a fortification on each side of the strait, [[Anadoluhisarı]] (1393) and [[Rumelihisarı]] (1451).

== Strategic importance ==
[[File:Istanbulbosphorusfrombridge.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A view of the Bosphorus strait, with the [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]] seen in the background.]]

The Bosphorus remains strategically important. It is a major sea access route for Russia and the Ukraine. Control over it has been an objective of a number of hostilities in modern history, notably the [[Russo–Turkish War, 1877–1878]], as well as of the attack of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] on the [[Dardanelles]] during the 1915 [[Battle of Gallipoli]] in the course of [[World War I]].

At its peak in the 16th through the 18th centuries, the Ottoman Empire had wrested control of the entire [[Black Sea]] area, which was for the time an "Ottoman lake", on which Russian warships were prohibited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://workmall.com/wfb2001/turkey/turkey_history_koprulu_era.html |title=Turkey - Köprülü Era |publisher=Workmall.com |date=2007-03-24 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}</ref>

Subsequently, several international treaties have governed vessels using the waters. Under the Treaty of Hünkar Iskelesi of 1833, the Bosphorus and [[Dardanelles]] straits were to be closed on Russian demand to naval vessels of other powers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://workmall.com/wfb2001/turkey/turkey_history_external_threats_and_internal_transformations.html |title=Turkey - External Threats and Internal Transformations |publisher=Workmall.com |date=2007-03-24 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}</ref> Following World War I, the 1920 [[Treaty of Sèvres]] demilitarized the strait and made it an international territory under the control of the [[League of Nations]]. This was amended under the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]], which restored the straits to Turkish territory—but allowed all foreign warships and commercial shipping to traverse the straits freely. Turkey eventually rejected the terms of that treaty, and subsequently Turkey remilitarized the straits area. The reversion to this old regime was formalized under the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits]] of July 1936. That convention, which is still in practical force {{as of|2011|lc=on}}, treats the straits as an international shipping lane, but Turkey retains the right to restrict the naval traffic of non-Black Sea nations (such as [[Greece]], a traditional enemy, or [[Algeria]]).

During [[World War II]], through February 1945, when Turkey was neutral for most of the length of the conflict, the Dardanelles were closed to the ships of the belligerent nations. In the conferences during World War II, Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] openly requested the concession of Soviet military bases on the [[Straits]], even though Turkey was not involved in the war. This incident, coupled with Stalin's demands for the restitution of the Turkish provinces of [[Kars Province|Kars]], [[Artvin]] and [[Ardahan]] to the [[Soviet Union]] (which were lost by Turkey with the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878, but were regained with the [[Treaty of Kars]] in 1921) was one of the main reasons why Turkey decided to give up its general principle of neutrality in foreign affairs. Turkey did declare war against Germany in February 1945, but did not engage in offensive actions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fpri.org/enotes/20030110.balkansturkey.torbakov.turkeypostsovietspace.html |title=Foreign Policy Research Institute: The Turkish Factor in the Geopolitics of the Post-Soviet Space (Igor Torbakov) |publisher=Fpri.org |date=2003-01-10 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertcutler.org/ch91dc.htm |title=Turkish-Soviet Relations |publisher=Robert Cutler |date=1999-03-28 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/relations-with-turkey |title=Russia's relations with Turkey |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/yazarDetay.do;jsessionid=DC0C8B5C41104733FE75243EF5E99B20.node1?haberno=36433 |title=Today's Zaman: Against who and where are we going to stand?

In more recent years, the Turkish Straits have become particularly important for the oil industry. Russian oil, from ports such as [[Novorossyisk]], is exported by tankers to western Europe and the U.S. via the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles straits.

The waters of the strait are traversed by numerous ferries. Two [[suspension bridge]]s cross the Bosphorus. The first of these, the [[Bosphorus Bridge]], is {{convert|1074|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long and was completed in 1973. The second, named [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge|Fatih Sultan Mehmet (Bosphorus II) Bridge]], is {{convert|1090|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, and was completed in 1988 about {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of the first bridge. The Bosphorus Bridge forms part of the [[Otoyol 1|O1 Motorway]], while the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge forms part of the [[Trans-European Motorway]].

== Submarine channel ==

In 2010, a team of scientists led by the [[University of Leeds]] used a robotic "yellow submarine" to observe detailed flows within an "undersea river" for the first time. Submarine channels are similar to land rivers, but they are formed by density currents—underwater flow mixtures of sand, mud and water that are denser than sea water and so sink and flow along the bottom. These channels are the main transport pathway for sediments to the deep sea where they form sedimentary deposits. These deposits ultimately hold not only untapped reserves of gas and oil, they also house important secrets—from clues on past climate change to the ways in which mountains were formed.

The team, led by Dr. Dan Parsons and Dr. Jeff Peakall from the University of Leeds, has been able to study the detailed flow within these channels. According to Dr. Parsons: "The channel complex and the density flow provide the ideal natural laboratory for investigating and detailing the structure of the flow field through the channel. Our initial findings show that the flow in these channels is quite different to the flow in river channels on land. Specifically, as flow moves around a bend it spirals in the opposite direction in the deep sea compared to the spiral to that found in river channels on land. This is important in understanding the sedimentology and layers of sediment deposited by these systems."<ref>[http://www.futurity.org/earth-environment/robotic-sub-records-flow-of-undersea-river/ Futurity.org: "Robotic sub records flow of undersea river" (August 2, 2010.)]</ref>

[[File:Istanbul Levent skyline.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Skyline of [[Levent]] as seen from the [[Khedive Palace]] gardens on the Asian coast of the Bosphorus. [[Istanbul Sapphire]] is the first skyscraper at right.]]

It is thought by some that the channels in the Black Sea were formed around 6,000 years ago when sea levels were approaching their current point. The Mediterranean swelled and breached through into the Black Sea—once an isolated freshwater lake—via the Bosphorus Strait. As the waters surged, they carried a dense, salty fluid which formed a network of sea-floor channels that are almost constantly active, even today.

Some people even believe that this was the biblical event of [[Noah's Ark|Noah's flood]], but despite their historical significance, the first spectacular images of these submarine channels were obtained in 1999 (Di Iorio, et al., 1999<ref>Di Iorio, D., and Yüce, H. (1999). Observations of Mediterranean flow into the Black Sea. Journal of Geophysical Research 104(C2), 3091-3108.</ref>) in the frame of a [[NATO]] SACLANT Undersea Research project using jointly the NATO RV ''Alliance'', and the [[Turkish Navy]] survey ship ''Çubuklu''. In 2002, a new survey was carried out on board the Ifremer RV ''Le Suroit'' for BlaSON project (Lericolais, et al., 2003<ref>Lericolais, G., Le Drezen, E., Nouzé, H., Gillet, H., Ergun, M., Cifci, G., Avci, M., Dondurur, D., and Okay, S. (2002). Recent canyon heads evidenced at the Bosphorus outlet. EOS transactions, AGU Fall Meet. Suppl. 83(47), Abstract PP71B-0409.</ref>) completed the multibeam mapping of this underwater channel fan-delta. A complete map was published in 2009 (Flood, et al., 2009<ref>Flood, R. D., Hiscott, R. N., and Aksu, A. E. (2009). Morphology and evolution of an anastomosed channel network where saline underflow enters the Black Sea. Sedimentology 56(3), 807-839.</ref>) using these previous results with high quality mapping obtained in 2006 (by researchers at Memorial University, Newfoundland, Canada who are project partners in this study.)

The team will use the data obtained to create innovative computer simulations that can be used to model how sediment flows through these channels. The models the team will produce will have broad applications, including inputting into the design of seafloor engineering by oil and gas companies.

The project was led by Dr. Jeff Peakall and Dr. Daniel Parsons at the University of Leeds, in collaboration with the University of Southampton, Memorial University (Newfoundland, Canada), and the Institute of Marine Sciences (Izmir, Turkey). The survey was run and coordinated from the Institute of Marine Sciences research ship, the [[RV K. Piri Reis|R/V ''Koca Piri Reis'']].

The researchers estimate that the river—known as a submarine channel—would be the sixth largest river in the world if it were on land based on the amount of water flowing through it.<ref name="leeds.ac.uk"/>

The Bosphorus is particularly famous for the 620 historic [[yalı|waterfront houses (''yalı'')]] built during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, which stretch along the strait's European and Asian shorelines. Ottoman palaces such as the [[Topkapı Palace]], [[Dolmabahçe Palace]], [[Yıldız Palace]], [[Çırağan Palace]], [[Feriye Palaces]], [[Beylerbeyi Palace]], [[Küçüksu Palace]], [[Ihlamur Palace]], [[Hatice Sultan Palace]], [[Adile Sultan Palace]] and [[Khedive Palace]] also adorn the shores and hills of the strait; together with other landmark monuments and buildings such as the [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Hagia Irene]], [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]], [[New Mosque (Istanbul)|Yeni Mosque]], [[Kılıç Ali Pasha Complex|Kılıç Ali Pasha Mosque]], [[Nusretiye Mosque]], [[Dolmabahçe Mosque]], [[Ortaköy Mosque]], [[Mihrimah Sultan Mosque (Üsküdar)|Üsküdar Mihrimah Sultan Mosque]], [[Yeni Valide Mosque]], [[Maiden's Tower]], [[Galata Tower]], [[Rumelihisarı|Rumelian Castle]], [[Anadoluhisarı|Anatolian Castle]], [[Yoros Castle]], [[Selimiye Barracks]], [[Sakıp Sabancı Museum]], [[Sadberk Hanım Museum]], [[İstanbul Modern|Istanbul Museum of Modern Art]], [[Perili Köşk|Borusan Museum of Contemporary Art]], [[Tophane|Tophane-i Amire Museum]], [[Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University]], [[Galatasaray University]], [[Boğaziçi University]], [[Robert College]], [[Kabataş High School]], [[Kuleli Military High School]], among numerous others.

A cheap way to explore the Bosphorus is offered by the [[ferries in Istanbul|public ferries]] that traverse the strait from [[Eminönü]] (ferries dock at the ''Boğaz İskelesi'' pier) on the [[Constantinople|historic peninsula]] of Istanbul to [[Yoros Castle#Anadolu Kavağı|Anadolu Kavağı]] near the [[Black Sea]], zigzagging between the [[Rumelia]]n and [[Anatolia]]n sides of the city. It is also possible to experience the Bosphorus by taking a shorter, regular ride in one of the public ferries that travel between the European and Asian sides; or by one of the privately owned ferries that operate between [[Üsküdar]] and [[Beşiktaş]] or [[Kabataş, Istanbul|Kabataş]].

The catamaran [[İDO|seabuses]] offer high-speed commuter services between the European and Asian shores of the Bosphorus, but they stop at fewer [[port]]s and [[pier]]s in comparison to the public ferries. Both the public ferries and the seabuses also provide commuter services between the Bosphorus and the [[Prince Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]].

There are also tourist rides available in various places along the coasts of the Bosphorus. The prices vary according to the type of the ride, and some feature loud popular music for the duration of the trip.
