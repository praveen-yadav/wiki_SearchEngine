'''Ammonius Hermiae''' ({{lang-el|Ἀμμώνιος ὁ Ἑρμείου}}; c. 440–c. 520) was a [[Byzantine Empire|Greek]] [[philosopher]], and the son of the [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers [[Hermias (philosopher)|Hermias]] and [[Aedesia]]. He was a pupil of [[Proclus]] in [[Athens]], and taught at [[Alexandria]] for most of his life, writing commentaries on [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and other philosophers.

==Life==
Ammonius' father, [[Hermias (philosopher)|Hermias]], died when he was a child, and his mother, Aedesia, raised him and his brother, [[Heliodorus of Alexandria|Heliodorus]], in [[Alexandria]]. When they reached adulthood, Aedesia accompanied her sons to [[Athens]] where they studied under [[Proclus]]. Eventually, they returned to Alexandria, where Ammonius, as head of the Neoplatonist school in Alexandria, lectured on [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] for the rest of his life. According to [[Damascius]], during the persecution of the [[paganism|pagans]] at Alexandria in the late 480's, Ammonius made concessions to the [[Christian]] authorities so that he could continue his lectures.<ref>Damascius, ''Philosophos Historia'', 118B, Athanassiadi</ref> Damascius, who scolds Ammonius for the agreement that he made, does not say what the concessions were, but it may have involved limitations on the doctrines he could teach or promote. He was still teaching in 515, since [[Olympiodorus the Younger|Olympiodorus]] heard him lecture on [[Plato]]'s ''Gorgias'' in that year.<ref>Olympiodorus, ''in Gorgias'', 199, 8–10</ref> He also taught [[Asclepius of Tralles]], [[John Philoponus]], [[Damascius]] and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]].
He was also an accomplished [[astronomer]]; he lectured on [[Ptolemy]] and is known to have written a treatise on the [[astrolabe]].

==Writings==

Of his reputedly numerous writings, only his commentary on Aristotle's ''De Interpretatione'' survives intact. A commentary on [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''[[Isagoge]]'' may also be his, but it is somewhat corrupt and contains later interpolations.

In ''De Interpretatione,'' Ammonius contends that divine foreknowledge makes void the contingent. Like
[[Boethius]] in his second ''Commentary'' and ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]],'' this argument maintains the effectiveness of prayer. Ammonius cites [[Iamblichus]] who said ''knowledge is intermediate between the knower and the known, since it is the activity of the knower concerning the known.''<ref>
