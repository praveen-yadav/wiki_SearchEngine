The '''Crete Senesi''' refers to an area of the [[Italy|Italian]] region of [[Tuscany]] to the south of [[Siena]]. It consists of a range of hills and woods among villages and includes  the ''[[comuni]]'' of 
[[Asciano]], 
[[Buonconvento]],
[[Monteroni d'Arbia]],
[[Rapolano Terme]] and
[[San Giovanni d'Asso]], all within the [[province of Siena]].

''Crete senesi'' are literally ‘[[Siena|Senese]] [[clay]]s’, and the distinctive grey colouration of the soil gives the landscape an appearance often described as lunar. This characteristic clay, known as ''mattaione'', represents the sediments of the [[Pliocene]] sea which covered the area between 2.5 and 4.5 million years ago. Nearby is also the semi-arid area known as the [[Accona Desert]].

Perhaps the most notable edifice of this area is the monastery of [[Monte Oliveto Maggiore]].

The region is known for its production of [[white truffles]], and hosts a festival and a museum dedicated to the rare fungus (genus Tuber).
