[[File:Origins of acid rain.svg|thumb|350px|Processes involved in acid deposition (note that only SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> play a significant role in acid rain).]]
'''Acid rain''' is a [[rain]] or any other form of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] that is unusually [[acid]]ic, meaning that it possesses elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low [[pH]]). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. Acid rain is caused by emissions of [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxide]], which react with the [[water]] molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids. Governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide into the [[atmosphere]] with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by [[lightning]] strikes and sulfur dioxide is produced by [[volcanic]] eruptions.  The chemicals in acid rain can cause paint to peel, [[corrosion]] of steel structures such as bridges, and erosion of stone statues.

==Definition==
"Acid rain" is a popular term referring to the deposition of wet (rain, snow, sleet, fog,  cloudwater, and dew) and dry (acidifying particles and gases) acidic components. [[Distilled water]], once [[carbon dioxide]] is removed, has a neutral pH of 7. Liquids with a pH less than 7 are acidic, and those with a pH greater than 7 are alkaline. "Clean" or unpolluted rain has an acidic pH, but usually no lower than 5.7, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form [[carbonic acid]], a weak acid according to the following reaction:

:{{Chemical formula|H|2|O}} (1) + {{Chemical formula |C||O|2}} (g) {{eqm}} {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}} (aq)

Carbonic acid then can ionize in water forming low concentrations of [[hydronium]] and [[carbonate]] ions:

:{{Chemical formula|H|2|O}} (l) + {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}} (aq) {{eqm}} {{Chemical formula|H||C||O|3}}<sup>−</sup> (aq) + {{Chemical formula|H|3|O}}<sup>+</sup> (aq)

However, unpolluted rain can also contain other chemicals which affect its pH (acidity level). A common example is [[nitric acid]] produced by [[electric discharge]] in the atmosphere such as [[lightning]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/JD092iD11p13299|author= Likens, Gene E.; Keene, William C.; Miller, John M.; Galloway, James N.|title=Chemistry of precipitation from a remote, terrestrial site in Australia|year=1987|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=92|pages=13299}}</ref> Acid deposition as an [[environmental issue]] (discussed later in the article) would include additional acids to {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}}.

The problem of acid rain has not only increased with population and industrial growth, but has become more widespread. The use of tall smokestacks to reduce local [[pollution]] has contributed to the spread of acid rain by releasing gases into regional atmospheric circulation.<ref name="Likens, G.

===History of acid rain in the United States===
[[File:Bixi stele (wrapped), Harvard University, Cambridge, MA - IMG 4607.JPG|thumb|Since 1998, [[Harvard University]] wraps some of the bronze and marble statues on its campus, such as this "[[Harvard Bixi|Chinese stele]]", with waterproof covers every winter, in order to protect them from erosion caused by acid rain (or, actually, acid snow)<ref>"[http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/03/art-under-wraps.html Art Under Wraps]", Harvard Magazine, March–April 2000</ref>]]
In 1980, the U.S. Congress passed an Acid Deposition Act.<ref name=Lackey>{{cite journal|url=http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/staff/lackey/pubs/ACID-RAIN-SCIENCE-POLICY-LACKEY-BLAIR-JOURNAL-REPRINT-1997.pdf |author=Lackey, R.T. |year=1997|title= Science, policy, and acid rain: lessons learned|journal= Renewable Resources Journal|volume= 15|issue=1|pages= 9–13}}</ref> This Act established a 18-year assessment and research program under the direction of the National Acidic Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP). NAPAP looked at the entire problem from a scientific perspective. It enlarged a network of monitoring sites to determine how acidic the precipitation actually was, and to determine long term trends, and established a network for dry deposition. It looked at the effects of acid rain and funded research on the effects of acid precipitation on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, historical buildings, monuments, and building materials. It also funded extensive studies on atmospheric processes and potential control programs.

From the start, policy advocates from all sides attempted to influence NAPAP activities to support their particular policy advocacy efforts, or to disparage those of their opponents.<ref name=Lackey/>  For the U.S. Government's scientific enterprise, a significant impact of NAPAP were lessons learned in the assessment process and in environmental research management to a relatively large group of scientists, program managers and the public.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1462-9011(98)00006-9|title=Acid rain: Science and policy making|year=1998|last1=Winstanley|first1=Derek|last2=Lackey|first2=Robert T.|last3=Warnick|first3=Walter L.|last4=Malanchuk|first4=John|journal=Environmental Science & Policy|volume=1|pages=51}}</ref>

In 1991, DENR provided its first assessment of acid rain in the United States. It reported that 5% of New England Lakes were acidic, with sulfates being the most common problem. They noted that 2% of the lakes could no longer support Brook Trout, and 6% of the lakes were unsuitable for the survival of many species of minnow. Subsequent Reports to Congress have documented chemical changes in soil and freshwater ecosystems, nitrogen saturation, decreases in amounts of nutrients in soil, episodic acidification, regional haze, and damage to historical monuments.

Meanwhile, in 1989, the U.S. Congress passed a series of amendments to the Clean Air Act. Title IV of these amendments established the [[Acid Rain Program]], a [[cap and trade]] system designed to control emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Title IV called for a total reduction of about 10 million tons of SO<sub>2</sub> emissions from power plants. It was implemented in two phases. Phase I began in 1995, and limited sulfur dioxide emissions from 110 of the largest power plants to a combined total of 8.7 million tons of sulfur dioxide. One power plant in New England (Merrimack) was in Phase I. Four other plants (Newington, Mount Tom, Brayton Point, and Salem Harbor) were added under other provisions of the program. Phase II began in 2000, and affects most of the power plants in the country.

During the 1990s, research continued. On March 10, 2005, EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). This rule provides states with a solution to the problem of power plant pollution that drifts from one state to another. CAIR will permanently cap emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> in the eastern United States. When fully implemented, CAIR will reduce SO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia by over 70% and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions by over 60% from 2003 levels.<ref name="US Environmental Protection Agency">{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/NE/eco/acidrain/history.html |title=US EPA: A Brief History of Acid Rain |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref>

Overall, the program's cap and trade program has been successful in achieving its goals. Since the 1990s, SO<sub>2</sub> emissions have dropped 40%, and according to the [[Pacific Research Institute]], acid rain levels have dropped 65% since 1976.<ref name="sfgate.com">[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/03/MNMMTJUS1.DTL&hw=Cap+trade+Acid+Rain&sn=001&sc=1000 'Cap-and-trade' model eyed for cutting greenhouse gases], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], December 3, 2007.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2facts.com/RecordUrl.asp?article=/icof/search/i0702840.asp |title=Facts On File News Services Databases |publisher=2facts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref> Conventional regulation was utilized in the European Union, which saw a decrease of over 70% in SO<sub>2</sub> emissions during the same time period.<ref>Gilberston, T. and Reyes, O. 2009.

In 2007, total SO<sub>2</sub> emissions were 8.9 million tons, achieving the program's long term goal ahead of the 2010 statutory deadline.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progress/arp07.html Acid Rain Program 2007 Progress Report], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], January 2009.</ref>

The EPA estimates that by 2010, the overall costs of complying with the program for businesses and consumers will be $1 billion to $2 billion a year, only one fourth of what was originally predicted.<ref name="sfgate.com"/>

==Emissions of chemicals leading to acidification==
The most important gas which leads to acidification is sulfur dioxide. Emissions of nitrogen oxides which are oxidized to form [[nitric acid]] are of increasing importance due to stricter controls on emissions of sulfur containing compounds. 70 Tg(S) per year in the form of SO<sub>2</sub> comes from [[fossil fuel]] combustion and industry, 2.8 Tg(S) from [[wildfires]] and 7–8 Tg(S) per year from [[volcanoes]].<ref name="Berresheim 1995">Berresheim, H.; Wine, P.H. and Davies D.D. (1995). "Sulfur in the Atmosphere". In ''Composition, Chemistry and Climate of the Atmophere'', ed. H.B. Singh. Van Nostrand Rheingold ISBN 0-442-01264-0</ref>

===Natural phenomena===
The principal natural [[phenomena]] that contribute acid-producing gases to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] are emissions from volcanoes. Thus, for example, [[fumarole]]s from the Laguna Caliente crater of [[Poás Volcano]] create extremely high amounts of acid rain and fog, with acidity as high as a pH of 2, clearing an area of any vegetation and frequently causing irritation to the eyes and lungs of inhabitants in nearby settlements.<ref name="wond">{{Cite journal |title =  Poás Volcano and Laguna Caliente |publisher = Wondermondo |date =  24 October 2010 |url = http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/NA/CostaRica/Alajuela/PoasCaliente.htm |postscript =.}}</ref>
Acid-producing gasses are also created by [[biology|biological]] processes that occur on the land, in [[wetland]]s, and in the [[ocean]]s. The major biological source of sulfur containing compounds is [[dimethyl sulfide]].

Nitric acid in [[rainwater]] is an important source of fixed [[nitrogen]] for plant life, and is also produced by electrical activity in the atmosphere such as [[lightning]].

Acidic deposits have been detected in [[glacier|glacial ice]] thousands of years old in remote parts of the globe.<ref name="Likens, G. E. 1979"/>

Soils of coniferous forests are naturally very acidic due to the shedding of needles, and the results of this phenomenon should not be confused with acid rain.

===Human activity===
[[File:Gavin Plant.JPG|thumb|The coal-fired [[Gavin Power Plant]] in [[Cheshire, Ohio]]]]
The principal cause of acid rain is sulfur and nitrogen compounds from human sources, such as [[electricity generation]], factories, and [[motor vehicle]]s. Electrical power complexes utilising coal are among the greatest contributors to gaseous pollutions that are responsible for acidic rain. The gases can be carried hundreds of kilometers in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited. In the past, factories had short funnels to let out smoke but this caused many problems locally; thus, factories now have taller smoke funnels. However, dispersal from these taller stacks causes pollutants to be carried farther, causing widespread ecological damage.

==Chemical processes==
Combustion of fuels produces sulfur dioxide and nitric oxides. They are converted into sulfuric acid and nitric acid.<ref name="CAA01">[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/09/980928072644.htm Clean Air Act Reduces Acid Rain In Eastern United States], ''ScienceDaily'', September 28, 1998</ref>

===Gas phase chemistry===
In the [[gas phase]] sulfur dioxide is oxidized by reaction with the [[hydroxyl]] radical via an [[intermolecular]] reaction:<ref name="Seinfeld 1998"/>
:SO<sub>2</sub> + OH· → HOSO<sub>2</sub>·
which is followed by:
:HOSO<sub>2</sub>· + O<sub>2</sub> → HO<sub>2</sub>· + SO<sub>3</sub>
In the presence of water, [[sulfur trioxide]] (SO<sub>3</sub>) is converted rapidly to [[sulfuric acid]]:
:SO<sub>3</sub> (g) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) → H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (aq)

[[Nitrogen dioxide]] reacts with OH to form nitric acid:
:NO<sub>2</sub> + OH· → HNO<sub>3</sub>

===Chemistry in cloud droplets===
When clouds are present, the loss rate of SO<sub>2</sub> is faster than can be explained by gas phase chemistry alone. This is due to reactions in the liquid water droplets.

;Hydrolysis

Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water and then, like carbon dioxide, [[hydrolysis|hydrolyses]] in a series of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] reactions:

:SO<sub>2</sub> (g) + H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} SO<sub>2</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O
:SO<sub>2</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup> + HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>
:HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup> + SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>

;Oxidation

There are a large number of aqueous reactions that [[redox|oxidize]] sulfur from S([[oxidation state|IV]]) to S(VI), leading to the formation of sulfuric acid. The most important oxidation reactions are with [[ozone]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[oxygen]] (reactions with oxygen are catalyzed by [[iron]] and [[manganese]] in the cloud droplets).<ref name="Seinfeld 1998"/>

==Acid deposition==

===Wet deposition===
Wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation (rain, snow, and so on.) removes acids from the atmosphere and delivers it to the Earth's surface. This can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops (see aqueous phase chemistry above) or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds. Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition.

===Dry deposition===
Acid deposition also occurs via dry deposition in the absence of precipitation. This can be responsible for as much as 20 to 60% of total acid deposition.<ref name="archive glossary">{{cite web|url=http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/glossary.php |title=UK National Air Quality Archive: Air Pollution Glossary |publisher=Airquality.co.uk |date=2002-04-01 |accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref> This occurs when particles and gases stick to the ground, plants or other surfaces.

==Adverse effects==
[[File:Waterspecies.gif|thumb|300px|This chart shows that not all fish, shellfish, or the insects that they eat can tolerate the same amount of acid; for example, frogs can tolerate water that is more acidic (i.e., has a lower pH) than trout.]]
Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms as well as causing damage to buildings and having impacts on human health.

===Surface waters and aquatic animals===
Both the lower pH and higher aluminium concentrations in surface water that occur as a result of acid rain can cause damage to fish and other aquatic animals. At pHs lower than 5 most fish eggs will not hatch and lower pHs can kill adult fish. As lakes and rivers become more acidic biodiversity is reduced. Acid rain has eliminated insect life and some fish species, including the [[brook trout]] in some lakes, streams, and creeks in geographically sensitive areas, such as the Adirondack Mountains of the United States.<ref name="EPA">US EPA: [http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/surface_water.html Effects of Acid Rain – Surface Waters and Aquatic Animals]</ref> However, the extent to which acid rain contributes directly or indirectly via runoff from the catchment to lake and river acidity (i.e., depending on characteristics of the surrounding watershed) is variable. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) website states: "Of the lakes and streams surveyed, acid rain caused acidity in 75% of the acidic lakes and about 50% of the acidic streams".<ref name="EPA"/>

===Soils===
Soil biology and chemistry can be seriously damaged by acid rain. Some microbes are unable to tolerate changes to low pH and are killed.<ref>Rodhe, H., et al. The global distribution of acidifying wet deposition. Environmental Science and TEchnology. vlo. 36, no. 20 (October) p.&nbsp;4382–8</ref> The [[enzyme]]s of these microbes are [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] (changed in shape so they no longer function) by the acid. The hydronium ions of acid rain also mobilize [[toxin]]s such as aluminium, and leach away essential nutrients and minerals such as [[magnesium]].<ref name="EPA: Forests">US EPA: [http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/forests.html Effects of Acid Rain – Forests]</ref>

Soil chemistry can be dramatically changed when base cations, such as calcium and magnesium, are leached by acid rain thereby affecting sensitive species, such as [[sugar maple]] ([[Acer saccharum]]).<ref>{{cite journal|title=The biogeochemistry of sulfur at Hubbard Brook|url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/mitchell/Class%20Readings/BioGeo60.235.316.pdf|doi=10.1023/A:1020972100496|year=2002|last1=Likens|first1=G.E.|last2=Driscoll|first2=C.T.|last3=Buso|first3=D.C.|last4=Mitchell|first4=M.J.|last5=Lovett|first5=G.M.|last6=Bailey|first6=S.W.|last7=Siccama|first7=T.G.|last8=Reiners|first8=W.A.|last9=Alewell|first9=C.|displayauthors=15|journal=Biogeochemistry|volume=60|issue=3|pages=235 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.272.5259.244|url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/mitchell/Class%20Readings/Sci.272.244.246.pdf|title=Long-Term Effects of Acid Rain: Response and Recovery of a Forest Ecosystem|year=1996|last1=Likens|first1=G.

===Forests and other vegetation===
[[File:Acid rain woods1.JPG|Effect of acid rain on a forest, Jizera Mountains, Czech Republic|thumb|right]]
Adverse effects may be indirectly related to acid rain, like the acid's effects on soil (see above) or high concentration of gaseous precursors to acid rain. High altitude forests are especially vulnerable as they are often surrounded by clouds and fog which are more acidic than rain.

Other plants can also be damaged by acid rain, but the effect on food crops is minimized by the application of lime and fertilizers to replace lost nutrients. In cultivated areas, limestone may also be added to increase the ability of the soil to keep the pH stable, but this tactic is largely unusable in the case of wilderness lands. When calcium is leached from the needles of red spruce, these trees become less cold tolerant and exhibit winter injury and even death.<ref>DeHayes, D.H., Schaberg, P.G. and G.R. Strimbeck. (2001).

===Ocean acidification===
{{main|Ocean acidification}}
{{expand section|date=July 2013}}	
Coral's limestone skeletal is sensitive to pH drop, because the [[calcium carbonate]], core component of the limestone dissolves in acidic (low pH) solutions.

===Human health effects===
Acid rain does not directly affect human health. The acid in the rainwater is too dilute to have direct adverse effects. However, the particulates responsible for acid rain (sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) do have an adverse effect. Increased amounts of fine particulate matter in the air do contribute to heart and lung problems including asthma and bronchitis.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/health.html Effects of Acid Rain – Human Health]. Epa.gov (2006-06-02). Retrieved on 2013-02-09.</ref>

===Other adverse effects===
[[File:Pollution - Damaged by acid rain.jpg|Effect of acid rain on statues|thumb|right]]
Acid rain can damage buildings, historic monuments, and statues, especially those made of rocks, such as [[limestone]] and [[marble]], that contain large amounts of calcium carbonate. Acids in the rain react with the calcium compounds in the stones to create gypsum, which then flakes off.

The effects of this are commonly seen on old gravestones, where acid rain can cause the inscriptions to become completely illegible. Acid rain also increases the [[corrosion]] rate of metals, in particular [[iron]], [[steel]], [[copper]] and [[bronze]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m0441x12l06k5n23/ |title=ICP on effects on materials |publisher=Springerlink.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/WP-89-104.pdf |title=Approaches in modeling the impact of air pollution-induced material degradation |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref>

==Prevention methods==

===Technical solutions===
Many coal-firing [[power station]]s use [[flue-gas desulfurization]] (FGD) to remove sulfur-containing gases from their stack gases. For a typical coal-fired power station, FGD will remove 95% or more of the SO<sub>2</sub> in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the wet scrubber which is commonly used. A wet scrubber is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulfur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral [[calcium sulfate]] that is physically removed from the scrubber. That is, the scrubber turns sulfur pollution into industrial sulfates.

In some areas the sulfates are sold to chemical companies as [[gypsum]] when the purity of calcium sulfate is high. In others, they are placed in [[landfill]]. However, the effects of acid rain can last for generations, as the effects of pH level change can stimulate the continued leaching of undesirable chemicals into otherwise pristine water sources, killing off vulnerable insect and fish species and blocking efforts to [[Restoration ecology|restore]] native life.

[[Fluidized bed combustion]] also reduces the amount of sulfur emitted by power production.

[[Vehicle emissions control]] reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides from motor vehicles.

===International treaties===
A number of international treaties on the long range transport of atmospheric pollutants have been agreed for example, [[1985 Helsinki Protocol on the Reduction of Sulphur Emissions|Sulphur Emissions Reduction Protocol]] under the [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]]. Canada and the US signed the [[Air Quality Agreement]] in 1991.  Most European countries and Canada have signed the treaties.

===Emissions trading===
{{main|Emissions trading}}
{{See also|Acid Rain Program}}
In this regulatory scheme, every current polluting facility is given or may purchase on an open market an emissions allowance for each unit of a designated pollutant it emits. Operators can then install pollution control equipment, and sell portions of their emissions allowances they no longer need for their own operations, thereby recovering some of the capital cost of their investment in such equipment. The intention is to give operators economic incentives to install pollution controls.

The first emissions trading market was established in the United States by enactment of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990]]. The overall goal of the Acid Rain Program established by the Act<ref>Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 42 ''U.S. Code'' 7651</ref> is to achieve significant environmental and public health benefits through reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), the primary causes of acid rain. To achieve this goal at the lowest cost to society, the program employs both regulatory and market based approaches for controlling air pollution.
