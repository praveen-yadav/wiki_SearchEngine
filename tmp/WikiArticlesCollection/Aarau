'''Aarau''' ({{IPA-de|ˈaːraʊ}}, [[Swiss German|locally]] [ˈɑːrɑʊ]) is the [[capital (political)|capital]] of the northern [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Aargau]]. The city is also the capital of the district of [[Aarau (district)|Aarau]].  It is German-speaking and predominantly [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. Aarau is situated on the [[Swiss plateau]], in the valley of the [[Aar]], on the river's right bank, and at the southern foot of the [[Jura mountains]],<ref name=CVDE>Bridgwater, W. & Beatrice Aldrich. (1968)</ref> and is west of [[Zürich]],<ref name=EB/> and {{convert|65|km|miles}} northeast of [[Bern]].<ref name=Colliers>Van Valkenburg, Samuel; Haefner, Harold(1997)</ref> The municipality borders directly on the [[Canton of Solothurn]] to the west.  It is the second-largest city in Aargau after [[Wettingen]].  At the beginning of 2010 [[Rohr, Aargau|Rohr]] became a suburb of Aarau.<ref name=Fusion>Oberholzer, Ernst (2013)</ref>

==Geography and geology==
[[File:Aarau from top.jpg|thumb|left|Aarau and the Jura Mountains]]
The old city of Aarau is situated on a rocky outcrop at a narrowing of the Aar river valley, at the southern foot of the Jura mountains.<ref name=Cohen/> Newer districts of the city lie to the south and east of the outcrop, as well as higher up the mountain, and in the valley on both sides of the Aar.
The neighboring municipalities are [[Küttigen]] to the north, [[Rohr, Aargau|Rohr]] and [[Buchs, Aargau|Buchs]] to the east, [[Suhr, Aargau|Suhr]] to the south-east, [[Unterentfelden]] to the south, and [[Eppenberg-Wöschnau]] and [[Erlinsbach, Aargau|Erlinsbach]] to the west.
Aarau and the nearby neighboring municipalities have grown together and now form an interconnected [[agglomeration]].  The only exception is Unterentfelden  whose settlements are divided from Aarau by the extensive forests of Gönhard and Zelgli.
Approximately nine-tenths of the city is south of the Aar, and one tenth is to the north.  It has an area, {{as of|2006|lc=on}}, of {{convert|8.9|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Of this area, 6.3% is used for agricultural purposes, while 34% is forested.  Of the rest of the land, 55.2% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (4.5%) is non-productive (rivers or lakes).<ref name=SFSO/>  The lowest elevation, {{convert|365|m|ft|sp=us}}, is found at the banks of the Aar, and the highest elevation, at {{convert|471|m|ft|sp=us}}, is the Hungerberg on the border with Küttigen.

==History==

===Prehistory===
[[File:Aarau schloessli.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Schlössli]]
[[File:Aarau rathaus.jpg|thumb|right|150px|City Hall]]
[[File:Aarau stadtkirche.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Town Church Tower]]
[[File:Aarau oberer turm.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Upper [[Gate Tower]]]]
A few artifacts from the [[Neolithic]] period were found in Aarau. Near the location of the present train station, the ruins of a settlement from the [[Bronze Age]] (about 1000 BC) have been excavated.  The Roman road between Salodurum ([[Solothurn]]) and [[Vindonissa]] passed through the area, along the route now covered by the Bahnhofstrasse.  In 1976 divers in the Aar found part of a seven-meter wide wooden bridge from the late Roman times.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Aarau rore-turm.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Rore Tower]]
Aarau was founded around AD 1240 by the counts of [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]].<ref name=EB/>  Aarau is first mentioned in 1248 as ''Arowe''.  Around 1250 it was mentioned as ''Arowa''.  However the first mention of a city sized settlement was in 1256.<ref name=HDS/> The town was ruled from the "Rore" tower, which has been incorporated into the modern city hall.

In 1273 the counts of Kyburg died out.  Agnes of Kyburg, who had no male relations, sold the family's lands to King [[Rudolf I]] von [[Habsburg]].  He granted Aarau its city rights in 1283.<ref name=Colliers/>  In the 14th century the city was expanded in two stages, and a second defensive wall was constructed. A deep ditch separated the city from its "suburb;" its location is today marked by a wide street named "Graben" (meaning Ditch).

In 1415 Bern invaded lower Aargau with the help of Solothurn.  Aarau capitulated after a short resistance, and was forced to swear allegiance to the new rulers.<ref name=Colliers/>  In the 16th century, the rights of the lower classes were abolished.
In March 1528 the citizens of Aarau allowed the introduction of Protestantism at the urging of the Bernese.  A growth in population during the 16th Century led to taller buildings and denser construction methods.  Early forms of industry developed at this time; however, unlike in other cities, no guilds were formed in Aarau.

On the 11th of August, 1712, the [[Peace of Aarau]] was signed into effect. This granted each [[ort]] the right to choose their own religion thereby ending [[Catholicism]]'s control.<ref>Luck, J. Murray (1985)</ref> Starting in the early 18th century, the textile industry was established in Aarau.  German immigration contributed to the city's favorable conditions, in that they introduced the cotton and silk factories.  These highly educated immigrants were also responsible for educational reform and the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]], revolutionary spirit that developed in Aarau.

===1798: Capital of the Helvetic Republic===
On 27 December 1797, the last [[Tagsatzung]] of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] was held in Aarau.  Two weeks later a French envoy continued to foment the revolutionary opinions of the city.  The contrast between a high level of education and a low level of political rights was particularly great in Aarau, and the city refused to send troops to defend the Bernese border.  By Mid-March 1798 Aarau was occupied by French troops.

On 22 March 1798 Aarau was declared the capital of the [[Helvetic Republic]].<ref name=Cohen/>  It is therefore the first capital of a unified Switzerland.  Parliament met in the city hall.  On 20 September, the capital was moved to [[Lucerne]].

===Aarau as canton capital===
In 1803, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] ordered the fusion of the cantons of Aargau, Baden and Fricktal.  Aarau was declared the capital of the new, enlarged canton of Aargau.  In 1820 the city wall was torn down, with the exception of the individual towers and gates, and the defensive ditches were filled in.

The wooden bridge, dating from the Middle Ages, across the Aar was destroyed by floods three times in thirty years, and was replaced with a steel suspension bridge in 1851.  This was replaced by a concrete bridge in 1952.  The city was linked up  to the [[Swiss Central Railway]] in 1856.

The textile industry in Aarau broke down in about 1850 because of the protectionist tariff policies of neighboring states.  Other industries had developed by that time to replace it, including the production of [[mathematical instrument]]s, shoes and cement.  Beginning in 1900, numerous electrical enterprises developed.  By the 1960s, more citizens worked in service industries or for the canton-level government than in manufacturing.  During the 1980s many of the industries left Aarau completely.

In 1802 the Canton School was established; it was the first non-parochial high school in Switzerland. It developed a good reputation, and was home to [[Nobel Prize]] winners [[Albert Einstein]], [[Paul Karrer]], and [[Werner Arber]], as well as several Swiss politicians and authors.

The purchase of a manuscript collection in 1803 laid the foundation for what would become the Cantonal Library, which contains a [[Bible]] annotated by [[Huldrych Zwingli]],<ref name=Ogr/> along with the manuscripts and incunabula.<ref name=Colliers/> More newspapers developed in the city, maintaining the revolutionary atmosphere of Aarau.  Beginning in 1820, Aarau has been a refuge for political refugees.

The urban educational and cultural opportunities of Aarau were extended through numerous new institutions.  A Theatre and Concert Hall was constructed in 1883, which was renovated and expanded in 1995–96.  The Aargau Nature Museum opened in 1922.  A former cloth warehouse was converted into a small theatre in 1974, and the alternative culture center KIFF (Culture in the fodder factory) was established in a former animal fodder factory.

==Origin of the name==
The earliest use of the place name was in 1248 (in the form Arowe), and probably referred to the settlement in the area before the founding of the city.  It comes, along with the name of the River Aar (which was called Arula, Arola, and Araris in early times), from the German Au, meaning [[floodplain]].

===Old town===
[[File:Aarauer Giebel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Painted Gable]]
The historic old town forms an irregular square, consisting of four parts (called ''Stöcke''). To the south lies the [[Laurenzenvorstadt]], that is, the part of the town formerly outside the city wall.  One characteristic of the city is its painted [[gable]]s, for which Aarau is sometimes called the "City of beautiful Gables". The old town, Laurenzenvorstadt, government building, cantonal library, state archive and art museum are all listed as [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage sites of national significance]].<ref name = SWS>Swiss Confederation (2009); p. 33</ref>

The buildings in the old city originate, on the whole, from building projects during the 16th century, when nearly all the Middle Age period buildings were replaced or expanded.  The architectural development of the city ended in the 18th century, when the city began to expand beyond its (still existing) wall.  Most of the buildings in the "suburb" date from this time.

The "Schlössli" (small Castle), Rore Tower and the upper gate tower have remained nearly unchanged since the 13th century.  The "Schlössli" is the oldest building in the city.  It was already founded at the time of the establishment of the city shortly after 1200; the exact date is not known.  City hall was built around Rore Tower in 1515.

[[File:Aarau1612.jpg|thumb|right|View of Aarau from 1612]]
The upper gate tower stands beside the southern gate in the city wall, along the road to Lucerne and Bern.  The jail has been housed in it since the Middle Ages.  A [[Carillon]] was installed in the tower in the middle of the 20th century, the bells for which were provided by the centuries-old bell manufacturers of Aarau.

The town church was built between 1471 and 1478.  During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], in 1528, its twelve altars and accompanying pictures were destroyed.  The "Justice fountain" (Gerechtskeitbrunnen) was built in 1634, and is made of French [[limestone]]; it includes a statue of Lady Justice made of [[sandstone]], hence the name.  It was originally in the street in front of city hall, but was moved to its present location in front of the town church in 1905 due to increased traffic.


==Economy==
[[File:Kunsthaus Aarau.jpg|thumb|right|Kunsthaus Museum]]
{{as of|2007|In 2007}}, Aarau had an unemployment rate of 2.35%.  {{as of|2005}}, there were 48 people employed in the [[Primary sector of the economy|primary economic sector]] and about 9 businesses involved in this sector.  4,181 people are employed in the [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] and there are 164 businesses in this sector.  20,186 people are employed in the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]], with 1,461 businesses in this sector.<ref name=SFSO/>  This is a total of over 24,000 jobs, since Aarau's population is about 16,000 it draws workers from many surrounding communities.  {{as of|2000}} there were 8,050 total workers who lived in the municipality.  Of these, 4,308 or about 53.5% of the residents worked outside Aarau while 17,419 people commuted into the municipality for work.  There were a total of 21,161 jobs (of at least 6 hours per week) in the municipality.<ref name=agch>Department of Finance and Resources
(2013)</ref>{{broken citation|date=November 2013}}

The largest employer in Aarau is the Canton government, the offices of which are distributed across the entire city at numerous locations.  One of the two head offices of the ''[[Aargauer Zeitung]]'', Switzerland's fifth largest newspaper, is located in Aarau, as are the Tele M1 television channel studios, and several radio stations.

[[Kern & Co.]], founded in 1819, was an internationally known [[Geodesy|geodetic]] instrument manufacturer based in Aarau.  However, it was taken over by Wild Leitz in 1988, and was closed in 1991.

More than half of the workers in Aarau live in the city's suburbs, or farther away in the surrounding area.  This leads to a busy rush hour, and regular traffic jams.  Statistically, Aarau has the most jobs per capita of any Swiss city.

The small scale of Aarau causes it to continually expand the borders of its growth.  The urban center lies in the middle of the "Golden Triangle" between [[Zürich]], [[Bern]], and [[Basel]], and Aarau is having increasing difficulty in maintaining the independence of its economic base from the neighboring large cities.  The idea of merging Aarau with its neighboring suburbs has been recently discussed in the hope of arresting the slowly progressing losses.

Manufacture include bells, mathematical instruments, electrical goods, cotton textiles, cutlery, chemicals, shoes, and other products, of which they are famous for their bells, cutlery, and instruments of mathematics.<ref name=Colliers/><ref name=Cohen/> Aarau is famous for the quality of their instruments and their bells.<ref name=Ogr>Ogrizek, Doré; Rufenacht, J. G. (1949)</ref>

===Markets and fairs===
Every Saturday morning there is a vegetable market in the ''Graben'' at the edge of the Old City.  It is supplied with regional products.  In the last week of September the MAG (Market of Aarauer Tradesmen) takes place there, with regional companies selling their products.  The "Rüeblimärt" is held in the same place on the first Wednesday in November, which is a Carrot fair.  The Aarau fair is held at the ice skating rink during the Spring.

==Transportation==
[[Aarau railway station]] is a terminus of the [[S-Bahn Zürich]] on the line [[S3 (ZVV)|S3]].

The town is also served with public transportation provided by [[Busbetrieb Aarau AG]].

==Population==
The population of Aarau grew continuously from 1800 until about 1960, when the city reached a peak population of  17,045, more than five times its population in 1800.  However, since 1960 the population has fallen by 8%.  There are three reasons for this population loss: firstly, since the completion of Telli (a large apartment complex), the city has not had any more considerable land developments.  Secondly, the number of people per household has fallen; thus, the existing dwellings do not hold as many people.  Thirdly, population growth was absorbed by neighboring municipalities in the regional urban area, and numerous citizens of Aarau moved into the countryside.  This trend might have stopped since the turn of the 21st century.  Existing industrial developments are being used for new purposes instead of standing empty.

Aarau has a population (as of {{Swiss populations date|CH-AG}}) of {{Swiss populations|CH-AG|4001}}.{{Swiss populations ref|CH-AG}}  {{as of|2008}}, 19.8% of the population was made up of foreign nationals.<ref name=AG_pop>Department of Finance and Resources (2013(a))</ref>  Over the last 10 years the population has grown at a rate of 1%.  Most of the population ({{as of|2000|lc=on}}) speaks German (84.5%), with Italian being second most common ( 3.3%) and Serbo-Croatian being third ( 2.9%).<ref name=SFSO>Swiss Federal Statistics Office (2013)</ref>

{{as of|2000}}, there were 1,365 homes with 1 or 2 persons in the household, 3,845 homes with 3 or 4 persons in the household, and 2,119 homes with 5 or more persons in the household.  The average number of people per household was 1.99 individuals.<ref name=zahlen/>  {{as of|2008|alt=In 2008}} there were 1,594 single family homes (or 18.4% of the total) out of a total of 8,661 homes and apartments.<ref name=AG_data>Department of Finance and Resources (2013(d))</ref>{{broken citation|date=November 2013}}

In Aarau about 74.2% of the population (between age 25–64) have completed either non-mandatory [[Education in Switzerland#Secondary|upper secondary education]] or additional higher education (either university or a ''[[Fachhochschule]]'').<ref name=SFSO/>  Of the school age population ({{as of|2009|alt=in the 2008/2009 school year}}), there are 861 students attending [[Education in Switzerland#Primary|primary school]], there are 280 students attending secondary school, there are 455 students attending [[Education in Switzerland#Tertiary|tertiary or university level schooling]], there are 35 students who are seeking a job after school in the municipality.<ref name=zahlen/>

At the district level, some elements of the government remain a direct democracy.  There are optional and obligatory referendums, and the population retains the right to establish an initiative.

===Executive===
The executive authority is the town council (''Stadtrat'').  The term of office is four years, and its members are elected by a [[plurality voting system]].  It leads and represents the municipality.  It carries out the resolutions of the assembly, and those requested by the canton and national level governments.

The seven members (and their party) for the period 2006–2009 are:
* Dr. Marcel Guignard (FDP) (City President)
* Beat Blattner (SP) (City Vice President)
* Jolanda Urech (SP)
* Rudolf Zinniker (FDP)
* Lukas Pfisterer (FDP)
* Carlo Mettauer (CVP)
* Michael Ganz (Pro Aarau)

===National elections===
In the 2007 [[Swiss federal election, 2007|federal election]] the most popular party was the SP which received 27.9% of the vote.  The next three most popular parties were the SVP (22.1%), the [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland|FDP]] (17.5%) and the Green Party (11.8%).<ref name=SFSO/>
