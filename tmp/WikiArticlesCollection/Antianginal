An '''antianginal''' is any [[Medication|drug]] used in the treatment of ''[[angina pectoris]]'', a symptom of [[coronary heart disease|ischaemic heart disease]].

==Types==

===Stable Angina===
Pain onset with strenuous activity or emotional strain. Alleviated with the removal of stress.

===Unstable Angina===
pain at unknown conditions due to low supply of Oxygen, also called vaso spasmatic angina.

==Examples==
Drugs used are [[nitrate]]s, [[beta blocker]]s, or [[calcium channel blocker]]s.

===Nitrates===
[[Nitrate]]s cause [[vasodilation]]<ref name="pmid9875113">{{cite journal |author=Pfister M, Seiler C, Fleisch M, Göbel H, Lüscher T, Meier B |title=Nitrate induced coronary vasodilatation: differential effects of sublingual application by capsule or spray |journal=Heart |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=365–9 |year=1998 |month=October |pmid=9875113 |pmc=1728824 |doi= |url=http://heart.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9875113}}</ref> of the venous capacitance vessels by stimulating the [[endothelium-derived relaxing factor]] (EDRF). Used to relieve both exertional and vasospastic angina by allowing venous pooling, reducing the pressure in the ventricles and so reducing wall tension and oxygen requirements in the heart. Short-acting nitrates are used to abort angina attacks that have occurred, while longer-acting nitrates are used in the prophylactic management of the condition.

Agents include [[nitroglycerin]] ([[glyceryl trinitrate]]) or [[pentaerythritol tetranitrate]].[[isosorbide dinitrate]] and [[isosorbide mononitrate]]

===Beta blockers===
[[Beta blocker]]s are used in the prophylaxis<ref name="pmid17998992">{{cite journal |author=O'Rourke ST |title=Antianginal actions of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists |journal=Am J Pharm Educ |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=95 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17998992 |pmc=2064893 |doi= 10.5688/aj710595|url=}}</ref> of exertional angina by reducing the work the heart is allowed to perform below the level that would provoke an angina attack.

They cannot be used in [[vasospastic angina]] and can precipitate [[heart failure]].

Agents include either cardioselectives such as [[acebutolol]] or [[metoprolol]], or non-cardioselectives such as [[oxprenolol]] or [[sotalol]].

===Calcium channel blockers===
[[Calcium]] [[ion]] (Ca<sup>++</sup>) antagonists ([[Calcium channel blocker]]s) are used in the treatment of chronic stable angina. They are not used in the treatment of unstable angina . In vitro, they dilate the coronary and peripheral arteries and have negative inotropic and chronotropic effects - decreasing [[afterload]], improving myocardial efficiency, reducing [[heart rate]] and improving coronary blood flow.
''In vivo'', the vasodilation and [[hypotension]] trigger the [[baroreceptor]] reflex. Therefore the net effect is the interplay of direct and reflex actions.

* Class I agents have the most potent negative inotropic effect and may cause heart failure.
* Class II agents do not depress conduction or contractility.
* Class III agent has negligible inotropic effect and causes almost no reflex [[tachycardia]].

Examples include Class I agents (''e.g.'', [[verapamil]]), Class II agents (''e.g.'', [[amlodipine]], [[nifedipine]]), or the Class III agent [[diltiazem]].
[[nifedipine]] :it is more potent vasodialater and more effective in angina. It in class of [[dihydropyridine]] and not effect on refrectory period on SA node counduction.
