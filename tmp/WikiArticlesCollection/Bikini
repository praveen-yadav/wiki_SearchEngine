A '''bikini''' is a women's two-piece [[swimsuit]] with a [[brassiere|bra]] for the chest and [[panties]] cut below the navel.<ref name=MMOA/> The design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's [[breast]]s and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover the [[groin]] in front and the [[buttocks]] in back.<ref name=MMOA/> What distinguishes the bikini from other swimsuits is its brevity.<ref name=MMOA/> The size of the panty can range from full coverage to a revealing [[thong (clothing)|thong]] or [[g-string]] design. It is often worn in hot weather and while swimming or sunbathing.

Illustrations of Roman women wearing bikini-like garments during competitive athletic events have been found in several locations. Swimsuits grew increasingly smaller until during the mid-1940s the design halted just short of revealing the woman's navel. These were worn in the 1940s by film stars like Ava Gardner, Rita Hayworth, and Lana Turner and were also common on American beaches. A French engineer introduced a new minimalist swimsuit design in 1946 that for the first time revealed the woman's navel. Mechanical engineer [[Louis Réard]] borrowed the name for his ''bikini'' design from the [[Bikini Atoll]], where post-war testing on the [[atomic bomb]] had begun on July 1, 1946, and his name stuck in the public consciousness.

French women welcomed the design but the Catholic church, some media, and a majority of the public initially thought the design was risqué or even scandalous. Contestants in the first Miss World contest wore them in 1951, but the design was then banned from the competition. Actress [[Bridget Bardot]] drew attention when she was photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the Cannes Film Festival in 1953. Other actresses like [[Rita Hayworth]] and [[Ava Gardner]] also gathered press attention when they wore bikinis that exposed their navel. During the early 1960s, the design appeared on the cover of ''Playboy'' and ''Sports Illustrated'', giving it additional legitimacy. [[Ursula Andress]] made a huge impact when she emerged from the surf wearing what is now an iconic [[White bikini of Ursula Andress|white bikini]] in the James Bond movie ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962). Raquel Welch wore a deer-skin bikini in ''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'' (1966) that turned her into a sex-symbol. In ''[[An Evening in Paris]]'' (1967), Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore was the first Indian actress to wear a bikini in a film.

The bikini gradually grew to gain wide acceptance in [[Western world|Western society]], though it is still unacceptable in many conservative Muslim countries. In 2010, a British woman was arrested in Dubai after she wore a bikini through a fashionable shopping mall. The swimsuit has been designated as the official uniform for women's Olympic beach volleyball, sparking some controversy. And after a number of Muslim countries objected, officials of the Miss World contest decided not to include bikinis in its 2013 contest.

According to French fashion historian Olivier Saillard, the bikini is perhaps the most popular type of female beachwear around the globe because of "the power of women, and not the power of fashion". As he explains, "The emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women."<ref name=BBCW/> The bikini has boosted spin-off services like [[bikini wax]]ing and the suntanning industries.<ref name=AgeL>Lorna Edwards, "[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/06/02/1148956539436.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 You've still got it, babe], ''[[The Age]]'', June 3, 2006</ref>

=== Bikini precursors ===
[[File:AKellermanUnitard1909.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Annette Kellerman]] reclines on diving board wearing her self-designed swimwear, 1909]]

In the 1920s, swimsuits were made from burlap. During the 1920s and 1930s people shifted from "taking the waters" at spas along the Riviera and in Florida to  "taking the sun" and swimsuit designs accommodated them. [[Rayon]] was used in the 1920s to manufacture tight-fitting swimsuits<ref name=sydelle>{{cite web|last=Sydelle|first=John|title=The Swimsuit Industry|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/swimsuit-industry-18779.html|publisher=Chron|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}</ref> but its durability and appearance retention is low, especially when wet.

Hollywood endorsed the new glamor in films like ''[[Neptune's Daughter (1949 film)|Neptune's Daughter]]'' in which [[Esther Williams]] wore provocatively named costumes such as "Double Entendre" and "Honey Child".<ref name=notting>{{cite web |first=David |last=Sandhu |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/sunandsea/728059/Nottingham-Bathed-in-nostalgia.html |title=Nottingham: Bathed in nostalgia |publisher=The Telegraph |date=August 4, 2003}}</ref>

With new materials like [[latex]] and nylon, by 1934 the swimsuit started hugging the body and had shoulder straps that the wearer could lower to allow more tanning.<ref name=carnival>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/bikini/#In%20Brazil  |title=History of the Bikini |publisher=Carnival}}</ref> By the early 1940s two-piece swimsuits were frequent on American beaches. During World War II, war production required vast amounts of cotton, silk, nylon, wool, leather, and rubber. The [[War Production Board]] issued Regulation L-85 in 1942 that rationed the use of natural fibers,<ref>{{cite web|title=World War II|url=http://amhistory.si.edu/militaryhistory/printable/section.asp?id=9&sub=3|work=The Price of Freedom: Americans at War|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}</ref> including reducing the amount of fabric in women's beachwear by 10 percent. To meet the regulations, swimsuit manufacturers produced two-piece women's suits with bare midriffs.<ref name=fashionencyc>{{cite web|title=Bikini|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/Modern-World-1946-1960/Bikini.html|publisher=Fashion Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}</ref>

The modern bikini design was first introduced in May 1946 by fashion designer [[Jacques Heim]], who owned a beach shop in the [[French Riviera]] resort town of [[Cannes]]. Heim began advertising a two-piece swimsuit that he named the “[[Atom]]e,”  the world's "smallest bathing suit".<ref>{{cite web |first=Thomas G. II|last=Cole|url=http://www.genders.org/g53/g53_cole.html |title=(The) Bikini: EmBodying the Bomb |publisher=Genders Journal }}</ref> The bottom of his design was just large enough to cover the wearer's navel.

Heim's design was the first to be worn on the beach, but the name given  by Réard is the one that stuck.<ref name=BBCW/> Despite significant social resistance,  Réard received more than 50,000 letters from fans.

Sales did not pick up around the world as women stuck to traditional two-piece swimsuits.

===Materials===

Modern bikinis were first made of cotton and jersey. When [[DuPont]] introduced Lycra ([[spandex]]), it completely changed how suits were designed and who could wear them. "The advent of Lycra allowed more women to wear a bikini," said Kelly Killoren Bensimon, a former model and author of ''The Bikini Book''. "It didn't sag, it didn't bag, and it concealed and revealed. It wasn't so much like lingerie anymore."<ref name=sfgate/>

The fabrics and other materials used to make bikinis are an essential element of their style and crucial modifiers of swimsuit design.<ref name=materials>{{cite web|last=Rosebush|first=Judson|title=Materials|url=http://bikiniscience.com/costumes/bikiniology_SS/materials_S/materials.html|publisher=Bikini Science|accessdate=August 15, 2013}}</ref>  Bikinis have been made out of just about every material known.<ref name=materials/> The use of cotton made the swimsuit more practical, and the increased reliance on stretch fabric after 1960 simplified construction; alternative swimwear fabrics such as velvet, leather, and crocheted squares surfaced in the early '70s.<ref name=MMOA/>

==Bikini underwear==

Types of underwear worn by both men and women are identified as bikini underwear, similar in size and revealing nature to the bottom half of a bikini bathing suit. For women, bikini underwear can refer to virtually any tight, skimpy, or revealing undergarment that provides less coverage to the midsection than traditional underwear, [[panties]] or knickers. For men, a bikini is a type of undergarment that is smaller and more revealing than men's briefs. Bikini briefs can be low or high-side bikini briefs but are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs. String bikini briefs, another style have front and rear sections meet in the crotch but not at the waistband, with no fabric on the side of the legs.<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of Underwear|url=http://www.boxerbriefs.com/history_of_underwear.htm|publisher=Boxerbriefs.com|accessdate=August 15, 2013}}</ref>

==Bikini waxing==
{{main|Bikini waxing}}

'''Bikini waxing''' is the [[hair removal|epilation]] of [[pubic hair]] in and around the [[pubic region]] (also known as '''bikini line'''), commonly by women, by the use of [[waxing|wax]]. With certain styles of women's swimwear, pubic hair may become visible around the [[crotch]] area of a [[swimsuit]].<ref name=Embod1>Heinz Tschachler, Maureen Devine, Michael Draxlbauer; ''The EmBodyment of American Culture''; pp 61–62; LIT Verlag, Berlin-Hamburg-Münster; 2003; ISBN 3-8258-6762-5.</ref> The bikini line delineates the part of a woman's pubic area which would normally be covered by the bottom part of a swimsuit. In the context of waxing, it is generally understood to describe any pubic hair visible beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit.<ref name=Embod1/> Visible pubic hair is widely culturally disapproved of and considered to be [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]], and so is at times removed.<ref name=Embod1/>

With the reduction in the size of swimsuits, especially since the coming into fashion and popularity of the bikini after 1945, the practice of bikini waxing has also come into vogue.<ref name=Embod1/> People who [[bikini waxing|wax or shave their bikini areas]] also face the risk of [[folliculitis]], an infection around the hair follicle.<ref>Barbara Hackley, Jan M. Kriebs & Mary Ellen Rousseau, ''Primary Care of Women: A Guide for Midwives and Women's Health Providers'', page 833, Jones & Bartlett Publishers, 2006, ISBN 0-7637-1650-2</ref> Some of these infections can develop into more serious abscesses that require incision with a scalpel, drainage of the abscess, and antibiotics.  ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' is the most common cause of folliculitis. Family physician Emily Gibson, M.D. expresses the view that shaving pubic hair "removes a cushion against friction, leaves microscopic open wounds and exposes you to infections".<ref>Emily Gibson.

===Other sports===
String bikinis and other skimpy clothes are also common in [[surfing]]. During the Ocean Pacific Pro Surfing Championships in 1983 and in 1986 at Huntington Beach, a disturbance broke out when men tried to pull the bikinis off of women on the beach and at a [[bikini competition]].<ref>Matt Krantz, "[http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2001-08-03-surf.htm Sponsors get gnarly idea: Surf sells, dude]", ''USA Today'', August 6, 2001</ref> In 2001, [[Vicky Botwright]], then 16th seeded in women's squash circuit and dubbed as the 'Lancashire Hot Bot', was prohibited by [[Women's International Squash Players Association]] (WISPA) to wear her trademark outfit, a thong and a sports bra, in the British Open Championships.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/other_sports/1408489.stm All thong wrong], BBC Sports Online</ref> In 2004, Alexander Putnam competed in the [[London Marathon]] in a green thong and painted as a tropical tree to protest against logging in Congo.<ref>[http://www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/s-%93Mara-thong%94%20Man%20runs%20from%20Congo%20loggers "Mara-thong" Man runs from Congo loggers], Rainforest Foundation</ref>

== Men's bikini ==

[[File:Bikini bottom (7453609698).jpg|thumbnail|right|Men's bikini worn by [[bodybuilding]] competitor]]

The term ''men's bikini'' is used to describe types of [[Swim briefs|men's swimsuits]], men's underwear, or similar garments. Men's bikinis can have both high or low side panels, string sides or tie sides, and most lack a button or flap front. Unlike [[swim briefs]], bikinis are not designed specifically for drag reduction and many do not have a visible waistband like swim briefs. Suits less than 1.5&nbsp;inches wide at the hips are less common for sporting purposes and are most often worn for recreation, fashion, and [[sun tanning]]. An example of this style, known as the posing brief, is the standard for competitions in the sport of [[bodybuilding]]. Male [[punk rock]] musicians have performed on the stage wearing women's bikini briefs.<ref>A. W. Richard Sipe, ''A Secret World'', page 25, Psychology Press, 1990, ISBN 0-87630-585-0</ref> The 2000 [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Hera Pheri (2000 film)|Hera Pheri]]'' shows men sunbathing in bikinis, who were mistakenly believed to be girls from a distance by the protagonist.<ref>Ruth Vanita, ''Queering India'', page 207, Routledge, 2002, ISBN 0-415-92950-4</ref>

Swimsuits shown in men's wear collections by [[Giorgio Armani]], [[Dolce & Gabbana]] or [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]] have tended to be black and snug fitting, throwbacks to the designs of the 1930s and '40s, while [[Gianni Versace]]'s ads with their heroic depictions of Miami bathers in contrast to popular, sports-inspired beach wear—bright and baggy Bermudas or boxer shorts. The Greek designer Nikos Apostolopoulos put a different spin on his bathing suits (for both sexes, but with the focus on the male), making them anatomical creations, cut and stitched to outline the body and its sexual characteristics.<ref name=menkes>{{cite web |first=Suzy |last=Menkes|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D81430F93BA25754C0A965958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 |title=Runways: Remembrance of Thongs Past|publisher=The New York Times |date=July 18, 1993}}</ref> Bikini tops for men are seen as an amusement factor.<ref>Sarah Karnasiewicz, [http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2006/01/19/mr_saugus/ Here she comes, "Mr. Saugus High School"], Salon.com</ref>

A '''mankini''' is not a form of a bikini, despite its name. It is a type of [[sling swimsuit]] worn by men. It was popularized by [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] when he donned one in the film ''[[Borat]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fricker|first=Martin|title=Mankini-wearing charity walkers stoned in Birmingham and rescued by police|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mankini-wearing-charity-walkers-stoned-birmingham-2132043|work=The Daily Mirror|publisher=MGN Ltd, part of Trinity Mirror plc|accessdate=August 15, 2013|date=August 6, 2013|quote=Steven and Jason, wearing the revealing costume made famous by comedy creation Borat...}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Willmott|first=Chris|title=Pelted with stones as charity bid turns sour|url=http://www.solihullobserver.co.uk/2013/08/15/news-dogs-home-charity-mankini-ellis-hendry-edl-muslim-pelted-stones-sparkbrook-80624.html|work=Solihull Observer|accessdate=August 15, 2013|date=August 9, 2013|quote=Two animal lovers who went on a sponsored walk wearing comedy mankinis...the skimpy outfit made famous in the 2006 film Borat...}}</ref>

== Bikini issues ==

=== Age appropriateness ===

There is some controversy over what age is appropriate to both begin and stop wearing a bikini. A 2011 survey, conducted by Diet Chef in the United Kingdom,  asked 2000 women when women should stop wearing certain kinds of fashion, including bikinis. The respondents surveyed felt that women should stop wearing a bikini at age 47.<ref name=dailymail2011>{{cite news|title=We're too old to wear bikinis on the beach at 47, and 35 is the cut-off age for a miniskirt, say women|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1385908/Women-old-wear-bikinis-beach-47-survey-shows.html#ixzz1M6X0ZLrK|accessdate=August 20, 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail UK|date=May 11, 2011}}</ref> The [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]] posted a similar online survey on May 13, 2011 asking if women over the age of 47 should stop wearing bikinis. Sixty-seven percent of respondents voted for "No. Rock it if you've got it."<ref>{{cite web|title=Stop wearing bikinis after 47?

In June 2013, actress [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], who also is interested in fashion, produced a bikini for her clothing line that is designed to be worn by girls 4 to 8 years old. She was criticized for sexualizing young children by Claude Knight of Kidscape, a British foundation that strives to prevent child abuse. He commented, “We remain very opposed to the sexualisation of children and of childhood.... is a great pity that such trends continue and that they carry celebrity endorsement.”<ref>{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=Ashli|title=Tag Archives: bikini Gwyneth Paltrow’s Kid Bikinis Cause Uproar|url=http://fashionlawsociety.com/tag/bikini/|publisher=fashionlawsociety.com|date= June 2013 |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}</ref>

===The body ideal===
As early as in 1950, American swimsuit mogul Fred Cole, owner of [[Cole of California]], told ''[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]'' bikinis were designed for "diminutive Gallic women", because "French girls have short legs" and  "swimsuits have to be hiked up at the sides to make their legs look longer." <ref name=heritage>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20060705-bikini-swimming-suit-louis-reard-micheline-bernardini-paris-brigitte-bardot.shtml|accessdate=November 13, 2007|publisher=American Heritage Inc.|title=60 Years of Bikinis|author=Hoover, Elizabeth D.|date=July 5, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070909195749/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20060705-bikini-swimming-suit-louis-reard-micheline-bernardini-paris-brigitte-bardot.shtml |archivedate=September 9, 2007}}</ref> ''[[New York Times]]'' reported the opinion that the bikini is permissible for people are not "too fat or too thin."<ref>Claudia Mitchell, Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, ''Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide'', page 183, ABC-CLIO, 2008, ISBN 9780313339097</ref> In the 1960s Emily Post decreed, "(A bikini) is for perfect figures only, and for the very young."<ref name=Slate>{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Julia|title=A Brief History of the Bikini: How the tiny swimsuit conquered America|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/fashion/2006/07/a_brief_history_of_the_bikini.html|publisher=Slate|accessdate=August 15, 2013|date=May 31, 2011}}</ref> In ''The Bikini Book'' by [[Kelly Killoren Bensimon]], responding to a question on who should not wear a bikini, swimwear designer [[Norma Kamali]] says, "Anyone with a tummy."<ref name=Slate/> Since then, a number of bikini designers including Malia Mills have encouraged women of all ages and body types to take up the style. The 1970s saw the rise of the [[The Thin Ideal|lean ideal]] of female body and figures like [[Cheryl Tiegs]], who possessed the figure that remains in vogue today.

The fitness boom of the 1980s led to one of the biggest leaps in the evolution of the bikini. According to Mills, "The leg line became superhigh, the front was superlow, and the straps were superthin."<ref>[http://www.lilith-ezine.com/articles/2006/The-Bikini.html The Bikini turns 60! from the Lilith Gallery of Toronto].

She wrote:

{{quote|So exposure has become an issue. It is as if the sexy stretch outfits, the bras, corsets and carelessly revealed flesh of the 1980's reached a flood tide that is now on the ebb. Faced with the sexpot supermodels and the cult of body consciousness, women have begun to stage a silent revolt, offering passive resistance to the concept that if you've got it, you have to flaunt it. Significantly, on the beaches as on the streets, some of the youngest and prettiest women (who were once the only ones who dared to bare) seem to have decided that exposure is over.<ref name="menkes"/>}}

Nevertheless, professional beach volleyball player [[Gabrielle Reece]], who competes in a bikini, claims that "confidence" alone can make a bikini sexy.<ref name=ArtCent>James Kitchling, "[http://www.articles-central.info/Art/22681/48/Short-History-of-Bikinis-and-Swimsuits.html Short History of Bikinis and Swimsuits]", Articles Central, August 2, 2008</ref><ref name=Slate />
