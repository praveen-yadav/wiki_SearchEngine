==NASA career==
[[File:AAA Iss026e015923 2.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Catherine Coleman in the ISS, 2011.]]
Coleman was selected by NASA in 1992 to join the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]]. In 1995 she was a member of the [[STS-73]] crew on the scientific mission USML-1 with experiments including [[biotechnology]], combustion science and the [[physics]] of [[fluids]]. During the flight, she reported to [[Johnson Space Center|Houston Mission Control]] that she had spotted an [[UFO|unidentified flying object]]. She also trained for the mission [[STS-83]] to be the backup for [[Donald A. Thomas]]; however, as he recovered on time, she did not fly that mission. [[STS-93]] was Coleman's second space flight in 1999. She was mission specialist in charge of deploying the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and its [[Inertial Upper Stage]] out of the shuttle's cargo bay.<ref>[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/coleman.html Lyndon B.

Coleman served as Chief of Robotics for the Astronaut Office, to include [[Mobile Servicing System|robotic arm]] operations and training for all Space Shuttle and [[International Space Station]] missions.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition26/coleman_interview.html Preflight Interview: Catherine Coleman; August 2010 (second half of the text]</ref>  In October 2004, Coleman served as an [[aquanaut]] during the [[NEEMO#NEEMO 7: October 11–21, 2004|NEEMO 7]] mission aboard the [[Aquarius (laboratory)|Aquarius]] [[Underwater habitat|underwater laboratory]], living and working underwater for eleven days.<ref name="seven">{{Cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/support/training/neemo/neemo7/|title=NEEMO 7|accessdate=September 23, 2011|publisher=NASA|date=October 13, 2004|author=NASA|authorlink=National Aeronautics and Space Administration}}</ref><ref name="seven2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/missions/neemo7/backgrounder_0809.asp|title=CSA – Neemo 7 Mission|accessdate=September 23, 2011|publisher=Canadian Space Agency|date=August 9, 2004|author=Canadian Space Agency|authorlink=Canadian Space Agency}}</ref>

Coleman was assigned as a backup U.S. crew member for Expeditions [[Expedition 19|19]], [[Expedition 20|20]] and [[Expedition 21|21]] and served as a backup crew member for Expeditions [[Expedition 24|24]] and [[Expedition 25|25]] as part of her training for [[Expedition 26]].

Coleman launched on December 15, 2010 (December 16 [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonur]] time), aboard [[Soyuz TMA-20]] to join the [[Expedition 26]] mission aboard the [[International Space Station]].<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/nov/HQ_M10-164A_Soyuz_Update.html NASA Television Will Air Next Soyuz Landing And Launch] – Media Advisory : M10-164A – November 18, 2010.</ref>

===Spaceflight experience===
[[STS-73]] on Space Shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' (October 20 to November 5, 1995) was the second United States Microgravity Laboratory mission. The mission focused on materials science, [[biotechnology]], combustion science, the physics of [[fluids]], and numerous scientific experiments housed in the pressurized [[Spacelab]] module. In completing her first space flight, Coleman orbited the [[Earth]] 256 times, traveled over 6 million miles, and logged a total of 15 days, 21 hours, 52 minutes and 21 seconds in space.

[[STS-93]] on ''Columbia'' (July 22 to 27, 1999) was a five-day mission during which Coleman was the lead mission specialist for the deployment of the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]]. Designed to conduct comprehensive studies of the [[universe]], the [[telescope]] will enable scientists to study exotic [[phenomena]] such as exploding [[stars]], [[quasars]], and [[black holes]]. Mission duration was 118 hours and 50 minutes.

[[Soyuz TMA-20]] / Expedition 26/[[Expedition 27|27]] (December 15, 2010, to May 23, 2011) was an extended duration mission to the [[International Space Station]].<ref>[http://spaceports.blogspot.com/2011/01/blog-post.html ISS Astronaut Cady Coleman on "The Talk"]</ref>

==Personal==
Coleman is married to [[glass art]]ist Josh Simpson who lives in Massachusetts.<ref>http://joshsimpson.com/site/ Josh Simpson  – Contemporary Glass</ref> They have one son. She is part of the band Bandella, which also includes fellow NASA astronaut [[Stephen Robinson|Steven Robinson]], Canadian astronaut [[Chris Hadfield]], and Micki Pettit (astronaut [[Don Pettit]]'s wife). Coleman is a [[flute]] player and has taken several flutes with her to the ISS, including a [[pennywhistle]] from [[Paddy Moloney]] of the [[The Chieftains|Chieftains]], an old [[Irish flute]] from [[Matt Molloy]] of the Chieftains, and a flute from [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]. On February 15, 2011, she played one of the instruments live from orbit on [[National Public Radio]].<ref name=NPR20110217>{{cite web|title=Flutes in Space: Astronaut Plays Aboard Space Station|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/02/15/133780067/flutes-in-space-astronaut-plays-aboard-space-station|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref> On April 12, 2011, she played live through video link for the audience of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]'s show in Russia in honour of the 50th anniversary of [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s flight. She played the duet from orbit while Anderson played on the ground in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Space flutes salute Yuri Gagarin|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/12/space_flutes/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web
