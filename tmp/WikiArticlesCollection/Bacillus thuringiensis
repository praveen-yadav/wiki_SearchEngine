'''''Bacillus thuringiensis''''' (or '''Bt''') is a [[Gram-positive]], soil-dwelling [[bacterium]], commonly used as a [[biological pesticide]]; alternatively, the Cry toxin may be extracted and used as a pesticide. ''B. thuringiensis'' also occurs naturally in the gut of [[caterpillar]]s of various types of [[moth]]s and [[butterfly|butterflies]], as well on leaf surfaces, aquatic environments, animal feces, insect rich environments, flour mills and grain  storage facilities.<ref name=Brock>{{cite book |editor1-last=Madigan |editor1-first=Michael T. |editor2-last=Martinko |editor2-first=John M. |title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms |edition=11th |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-13-144329-7}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Nicolette |last=du Rand |title=Isolation of Entomopathogenic Gram Positive Spore Forming Bacteria Effective Against Coleoptera |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=University of KwaZulu-Natal |location=Pietermaritzburg, South Africa |month=July |year=2009 |id={{hdl|10413/1235}}}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}</ref>

During [[sporulation]], many Bt strains produce crystal proteins (proteinaceous inclusions), called [[δ-endotoxins]], that have [[Insecticide]] action. This has led to their use as insecticides, and more recently to [[genetically modified crops]] using Bt genes. Many crystal-producing Bt [[strain (biology)|strains]], though, do not have insecticidal properties.<ref name="Roh">{{cite journal |pmid=18051264 |year=2007 |last1=Roh |first1=JY |last2=Choi |first2=JY |last3=Li |first3=MS |last4=Jin |first4=BR |last5=Je |first5=YH |title=Bacillus thuringiensis as a specific, safe, and effective tool for insect pest control |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=547–59 |journal=Journal of microbiology and biotechnology}}</ref>

==Discovery and mechanism of insecticidal action==

''B. thuringiensis'' was first discovered in 1901 by Japanese [[biologist]] Ishiwata Shigetane.<ref name="Roh" />  In 1911, ''B. thuringiensis'' was rediscovered in Germany by Ernst Berliner, who isolated it as the cause of a disease called ''Schlaffsucht'' in flour moth caterpillars. In 1976, Robert A. Zakharyan reported the presence of a plasmid in a strain of ''B. thuringiensis'' and suggested the plasmid's involvement in endospore and crystal formation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zakharyan R.A ''et. el.'' |year=1979 |title=Plasmid DNA from Bacillus thuringiensis |journal=Microbiologiya |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=226–9 |issn=0026-3656}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=Thomas Clement |editor1-last=Cheng |year=1984 |title=Pathogens of invertebrates: application in biological control and transmission mechanisms |isbn=978-0-306-41700-9 |page=159}}</ref> ''B. thuringiensis'' is closely related to ''[[Bacillus cereus|B.cereus]]'', a soil bacterium, and ''[[Bacillus anthracis|B.anthracis]]'', the cause of [[Anthrax disease|anthrax]]: the three organisms differ mainly in their [[plasmid]]s.<ref name=Økstad>Ole Andreas Økstad and Anne-Brit Kolstø [http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-7686-4_2#page-1 Chapter 2: Genomics of Bacillus Species] in M.

Cry toxins have specific activities against insect species of the orders [[Lepidoptera]] (moths and butterflies), [[Diptera]] (flies and mosquitoes), [[Coleoptera]] (beetles), [[Hymenoptera]] ([[wasp]]s, [[bee]]s, [[ant]]s and [[sawfly|sawflies]]) and [[nematode]]s. Thus, ''B. thuringiensis'' serves as an important reservoir of Cry toxins for production of biological insecticides and insect-resistant [[Genetically modified food|genetically modified crops]]. When insects ingest toxin crystals, the alkaline pH of their digestive tract denatures the insoluble crystals, making them soluble and thus  amenable to being cut with [[proteases]] found in the insect gut, which liberate the cry toxin from the crystal.<ref name="Stahly"/> The Cry toxin is then inserted into the insect gut cell membrane, paralyzing the digestive tract and forming a pore.<ref name=ColoSt>W.S.

In China, the main problem has been with [[mirids]],<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=20466880 |year=2010 |last1=Lu |first1=Y |last2=Wu |first2=K |last3=Jiang |first3=Y |last4=Xia |first4=B |last5=Li |first5=P |last6=Feng |first6=H |last7=Wyckhuys |first7=KA |last8=Guo |first8=Y |title=Mirid bug outbreaks in multiple crops correlated with wide-scale adoption of Bt cotton in China |volume=328 |issue=5982 |pages=1151–4 |doi=10.1126/science.1187881 |journal=Science|bibcode = 2010Sci...328.1151L }}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |first1=David R. |last1=Just |first2=Shenghui |last2=Wang |first3=Per |last3=Pinstrup-Andersen |year=2006 |title=Tarnishing Silver Bullets: Bt Technology Adoption, Bounded Rationality and the Outbreak of Secondary Pest Infestations in China |conference=American Agricultural Economics Association Annual Meeting |location=Long Beach, CA |url=http://purl.umn.edu/21230 |laysource=Cornell Chronicle |laysummary=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July06/Bt.cotton.China.ssl.html |laydate=July 25, 2006}}</ref> which have in some cases "completely eroded all benefits from Bt cotton cultivation”.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1504/IJBT.2008.018348 |title=Bt-cotton and secondary pests |year=2008 |last1=Wang |first1=Shenghui |last2=Just |first2=David R. |last3=Pinstrup-Andersen |first3=Per |journal=International Journal of Biotechnology |volume=10 |issue=2/3 |pages=113–21}}</ref> A 2009 study in China concluded that the increase in sucking pests depended on local temperature and rainfall conditions and increased in half the villages studied.

===Controversies===
{{Main|Genetically modified food controversies}}
There are controversies around GMOs on several levels, including whether making them is ethical, whether food produced with them is safe, whether such food should be labeled and if so how, whether agricultural biotech is needed to address world hunger now or in the future, and more specifically to GM crops—intellectual property and market dynamics; environmental effects of GM crops; and GM crops' role in industrial agricultural more generally.<ref>Staff, Frontline. [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/harvest/viewpoints/ Harvest of Fear: Viewpoints]</ref>

There are also issues specific to Bt transgenic crops.

====Lepidopteran toxicity====
The most publicised problem associated with Bt crops is the claim that pollen from Bt maize could kill the [[monarch butterfly]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/20338 |year=1999 |last1=Losey |first1=John E. |last2=Rayor |first2=Linda S. |last3=Carter |first3=Maureen E. |journal=Nature |volume=399 |issue=6733 |page=214 |pmid=10353241 |title=Transgenic pollen harms monarch larvae|bibcode = 1999Natur.399..214L }}</ref> The paper produced a public uproar and demonstrations against Bt maize; however by 2001 several follow-up studies coordinated by the USDA had proven that "the most common types of Bt maize pollen are not toxic to monarch larvae in concentrations the insects would encounter in the fields."<ref name=Waltz>Emily Waltz for Nature News.

====Wild maize genetic mixing====
A study published in ''Nature'' in 2001 reported that Bt-containing maize genes were found in maize in its center of origin, Oaxaca, Mexico.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11734853 |year=2001 |last1=Quist |first1=D |last2=Chapela |first2=IH |title=Transgenic DNA introgressed into traditional maize landraces in Oaxaca, Mexico |volume=414 |issue=6863 |pages=541–3 |doi=10.1038/35107068 |journal=Nature}}</ref>  In 2002 ''Nature'' "concluded that the evidence available is not sufficient to justify the publication of the original paper."<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11935145 |year=2002 |last1=Kaplinsky |first1=N |last2=Braun |first2=D |last3=Lisch |first3=D |last4=Hay |first4=A |last5=Hake |first5=S |last6=Freeling |first6=M |title=Biodiversity (Communications arising): Maize transgene results in Mexico are artefacts |volume=416 |issue=6881 |pages=601–2; discussion 600, 602 |doi=10.1038/nature739 |journal=Nature|bibcode = 2002Natur.416..601K }}</ref> A significant controversy happened over the paper and ''Nature''{{'}}s unprecedented notice.<ref name="pbs.org">http://www.pbs.org/now/science/genenature.html{{full|date=February 2013}}</ref><ref>http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_17133.cfm{{full|date=February 2013}}</ref>

A subsequent large-scale study, in 2005, failed to find any evidence of genetic mixing in Oaxaca.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16093316 |year=2005 |last1=Ortiz-García |first1=S |last2=Ezcurra |first2=E |last3=Schoel |first3=B |last4=Acevedo |first4=F |last5=Soberón |first5=J |last6=Snow |first6=AA |title=Absence of detectable transgenes in local landraces of maize in Oaxaca, Mexico (2003-2004) |volume=102 |issue=35 |pages=12338–43 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0503356102 |pmc=1184035 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |jstor=3376579 |bibcode=2005PNAS..10212338O}}</ref>  A 2007 study found that "transgenic proteins expressed in maize were found in two (0.96%) of 208 samples from farmers' fields, located in two (8%) of 25 sampled communities.

====Disproven link to colony collapse disorder====
As of 2007, a new phenomenon called [[colony collapse disorder]] (CCD) began affecting [[Honey bee|bee]] hives all over North America.

==Beta-exotoxins==

Some isolates of ''B. thuringiensis'' produce a class of insecticidal small molecules called beta-exotoxin, the common name for which is thuringiensin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/pesticides/f?p=CHEMICALSEARCH:3:0::NO:1,3,31,7,12,25:P3_XCHEMICAL_ID:4063 |title=EPA pesticide database |publisher=Ofmpub.epa.gov |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2013-07-09}}</ref> A consensus document produced by the OECD says: "Beta-exotoxin and the other Bacillus toxins may contribute to the insecticidal toxicity of the bacterium to lepidopteran, dipteran, and coleopteran insects. Beta-exotoxin is known to be toxic to humans and almost all other forms of life and its presence is prohibited in B. thuringiensis microbial products. Engineering of plants to contain and express only the genes for δ-endotoxins avoids the problem of assessing the risks posed by these other toxins that may be produced in microbial preparations."<ref>Staff Environment Directorate, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
