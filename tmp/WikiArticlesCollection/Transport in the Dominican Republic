'''Transportation in the [[Dominican Republic]]''' is composed of a system of roads, airports, ports, harbours and an urban railway:

== Roadways ==
{{main|Highways and Routes in the Dominican Republic}}

There are five main highways ([[DR-1]], [[DR-2]], [[DR-3]], [[DR-4]], [[DR-5]]) they are in good condition in the Dominican Republic connecting its biggest cities and tourist centers. There are nearly {{Convert|19705|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of highways and roads, 9,872 being paved and {{Convert|9833|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} (2002 est.) unpaved. Like any underdeveloped nation, the Dominican Republic suffers from lack of good paved roads to connect smaller towns and less populated areas, major town roads however are in good condition.

== Public transport ==

=== Mass transit ===
{{main|Santo Domingo Metro}}
The [[Santo Domingo Metro]] is the first mass transit system in the country, and second in the Caribbean & Central American nations after the [[Tren Urbano]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].  On Feb 27th 2008 the incumbent president [[Leonel Fernández]] test rode the system for the first time and free service was offered thereafter several times.  Commercial service started on January 30, 2009. Several additional lines are currently being planned. 

The [[Santiago light rail]] system is a planned light rail system in the Dominican Republic's second largest city, still in developing stages it was said to start on mid-2008 but right now is currently on hold due to lack of approval and of central government funds.

===Buses===
The Dominican Republic has a bus system that is rather reliable, and most of these public transportation vehicles are fairly comfortable. The fare is generally inexpensive, and there are bus terminals and stops in most of the island's major cities.

===Public Cars (''Carros Públicos'')===
The Public Cars (''[[Share taxi|Carros Públicos]]–Conchos'') are privately owned passenger cars that transit a specific route daily and passengers pay a certain fee with the convenience of stopping anywhere.  This comprises one of the main ways of transportation inside the capital city of Santo Domingo, as well as other major cities.
This system though is not very reliable and lacks discipline, the high number of public cars that transit the roads, and the fact that they do not lend itself to regulation or central control, which causes frequent transit problems among city roads. They may also be somewhat uncomfortable, since they try to fit as much people as possible inside them. As a standard, a 4 person sedan (driver included) usually caries 6 passengers, twice the amount for which they were designed.
