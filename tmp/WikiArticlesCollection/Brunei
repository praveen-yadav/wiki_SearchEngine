'''Brunei''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Brunei.ogg|b|r|uː|ˈ|n|aɪ}}, officially the '''Nation<!--full translation of the name is usually accompanied with "nation", not "state"--> of Brunei, the<!--inclusion of "the" is more common--> Abode of Peace'''<ref>Peter Haggett (ed). ''Encyclopedia of World Geography, Volume 1'', Marshall Cavendish, 2001, [http://books.google.com/books?id=u6LJ65K9DisC&lpg=PA2913&dq=brunei%20abode%20of%20peace&pg=PA2913 p. 2913].</ref> ({{lang-ms|Negara Brunei Darussalam}}, [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: {{lang|ms-Arab|نڬارا بروني دارالسلام}}), is a [[sovereign state]] located on the north coast of the island of [[Borneo]], in Southeast Asia. Apart from its coastline with the [[South China Sea]], it is completely surrounded by the [[federated state|state]] of [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]]; and it is separated into two parts by the Sarawak district of [[Limbang Division|Limbang]]. It is the only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo. The remainder of the island's territory is divided between the nations of [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]. [[Bruneians|Brunei's population]] was 408,786 in July 2012.<ref name="U.S. DOS" />

The official national history claims that Brunei can trace its beginnings to the 7th century, when it was a subject state named P'o-li, in the [[Sumatra]]-centric [[Srivijaya]] empire.  It later became a [[vassal state]] of the [[Java]]-centric [[Majapahit]] empire. Brunei became a [[sultan]]ate in the 14th century, under a newly converted [[Islam]]ic sultan—[[Muhammad Shah of Brunei|Muhammad Shah]].

At the peak of [[Bruneian Empire]], [[Bolkiah|Sultan Bolkiah]] (reigned 1485–1528) had control over the northern regions of Borneo, including modern-day Sarawak and [[Sabah]], as well as the [[Sulu archipelago]] off the northeast tip of Borneo, [[Seludong]] (modern-day [[Manila]]), and the islands off the northwest tip of Borneo. The [[thalassocracy|maritime state]] was visited by Spain's [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan Expedition]] in 1521 and fought against Spain in 1578's [[Castille War]].

The Bruneian Empire began to decline; during the 19th century, the Sultanate ceded Sarawak to [[James Brooke]] as a reward for his aid in putting down a rebellion and named him as rajah; and it ceded Sabah to the British [[North Borneo Chartered Company]]. In 1888 Brunei became a British [[protectorate]] and was assigned a [[Resident (title)|British Resident]] as colonial manager in 1906. After the Japanese occupation during [[World War II]], in 1959 a new constitution was written. In 1962 a small [[Brunei Revolt|armed rebellion]] against the monarchy was ended with the help of the British.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pocock |first=Tom |title=Fighting General – The Public &Private Campaigns of General Sir Walter Walker |year=1973 |edition=First |publisher=Collins |location=London |isbn=0-00-211295-7}}</ref>

Brunei regained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984. Economic growth during the 1970s and 1990s, averaging 56% from 1999 to 2008, has transformed Brunei into a newly industrialised country. It has developed wealth from extensive petroleum and natural gas fields. Brunei has the second-highest [[Human Development Index]] among the [[South East Asia]] nations after Singapore, and is classified as a [[developed country]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Human Development Reports |publisher=United Nations |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/ |accessdate=5 October 2009}}</ref> According to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), Brunei is ranked fifth in the world by gross domestic product per capita at [[purchasing power parity]]. The IMF estimated in 2011 that Brunei was one of two countries (the other being [[Libya]]) with a public debt at 0% of the national GDP. ''[[Forbes]]'' also ranks Brunei as the fifth-richest nation out of 182, based on its petroleum and natural gas fields.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/25/forbes-ranks-brunei-fifth-richest-nation.html |title=Forbes ranks Brunei fifth richest nation |date=25 February 2012}}</ref>

==Etymology==
According to legend, Brunei was founded by ''Awang Alak Betatar''. He moved from Garang, a place in the [[Temburong]] District<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|p= 26}}</ref> to the Brunei river estuary, discovering Brunei. According to legend, upon landing he exclaimed, ''Baru nah!'' (loosely translated as "that's it!" or "there"), from which the name "Brunei" was derived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2007/03/08/treasuring-bruneis-past/ |title=Treasuring Brunei's past |publisher=Southeast Asian Archaeology |date=8 March 2007 |accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref>

It was renamed ''Barunai'' in the 14th century, possibly influenced by the [[Sanskrit]] word "{{transl|sa|varuṇ}}" ({{lang|sa|वरुण}}), meaning either "ocean" or the mythological "regent of the ocean". The word "borneo" is of the same origin. In the country's full name, ''{{lang|ms|Negara Brunei Darussalam}}'', ''{{lang|ms|darussalam}}'' ({{lang-ar|دار السلام}}) means "abode of peace", while ''{{lang|ms|negara}}'' means "country" in [[Malay language|Malay]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Brunei}}

===Early history===
[[File:The Tomb of the King of Boni (Brunei) Nanjing.JPG|thumb|left|The tomb of [[Abdul Majid Hassan]], ruler of Poli, in [[Nanjing]]]]
In the absence of other evidence, scholars have developed an early history of Brunei based on interpretations of Chinese texts. Chinese records from the sixth century mention a state called P’o-li on the northwest coast of Borneo.<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 41">{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=41}}</ref> In the seventh century, Chinese and Arab accounts refer to a place called ''Vijayapura'', which was thought to have been founded by members of the royal family of [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Saunders|2002|p=20}}</ref> They were believed to have landed on the northwest coast of Borneo with some of their followers. After capturing P’o-li, they renamed the territory 'Vijayapura' (meaning 'victory' in [[Sanskrit]]). In 977, Chinese records began to use the term ''Po-ni'' instead of Vijayapura to refer to Brunei.<ref>{{Harvnb|Saunders|2002|p=21}}</ref>
In 1225 a Chinese official, Chua Ju-Kua, reported that Brunei has 100 warships to protect its trade, and that there was a lot of gold in the kingdom.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=43}}</ref> A 1280 report described Po-ni as controlling large parts of [[Borneo]] Island (modern day [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]], [[Sulu]] and some parts of the [[Philippines]]).

In the fourteenth century, Po-ni became a [[vassal state]] of Majapahit, and had to pay an annual payment of 40 [[catty|katis]] of [[camphor]]. In 1369 the Sulus attacked Po-ni, looting it of treasure and gold. A fleet from Majapahit succeeded in driving away the Sulus, but Po-ni was left weaker after the attack.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=44}}</ref> A Chinese report of 1371 described Po-ni as poor and totally controlled by Majapahit.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=45}}</ref>

The power of the [[Sultanate]] of Brunei was at its peak between the 15th and 17th centuries, with its power extending from northern Borneo to the southern Philippines.<ref name=cia>{{cite journal | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bx.html | title=Brunei | publisher=[[CIA World Factbook]] | year=2011 | accessdate=13 January 2011 | ref=harv}}</ref> By the 16th century, Islam was firmly rooted in Brunei, and the country had built one of its biggest mosques. In 1578, Alonso Beltrán, a Spanish traveler, described it as being five stories tall and built on the water.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholl|2002|pp=47–51}}</ref>

====War with Spain and decline====
[[Colonialism|European influence]] gradually brought an end to the [[regional power]], as Brunei entered a period of decline compounded by internal strife over royal succession. Piracy was also detrimental to the kingdom.<ref name=cia/> Spain [[Castille War|declared war]] in 1578, attacking and capturing Brunei's capital at the time, [[Kota Batu, Brunei-Muara|Kota Batu]]. This was achieved as a result in part of the assistance rendered to them by two Bruneian [[Pengiran#Brunei|noblemen]], Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The former had travelled to [[Manila]], then the centre of the Spanish colony, to offer Brunei as a [[tributary state|tributary]] to Spain for help to recover the throne usurped by his brother, Saiful Rijal.<ref>{{harvnb|Melo Alip|1964|p=201,317}}</ref> The Spanish agreed that if they succeeded in conquering Brunei, Pengiran Seri Lela would be appointed as the Sultan, while Pengiran Seri Ratna would be the new [[Bendahara]].

In March 1578, the Spanish fleet, led by [[Francisco de Sande|De Sande]], acting as [[Capitán-General]], started from Manila for Brunei. The expedition consisted of 400 Spaniards, 1,500 [[Filipino people|Filipino]] natives and 300 Borneans.<ref>{{Harvnb|United States War Dept|1903|p=379}}</ref> The campaign was one of many, which also included action in [[Mindanao]] and [[Sulu Archipelago|Sulu]].<ref>{{Harvnb|McAmis|2002|p=33}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filipiniana.net/publication/letter-from-francisco-de-sande-to-felipe-ii/12791881675822|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327133109/http://www.filipiniana.net/publication/letter-from-francisco-de-sande-to-felipe-ii/12791881675822|archivedate=27 March 2012|title=Letter from Francisco de Sande to Felipe II, 1578|accessdate=17 October 2009|work=filipiniana.net}}</ref>

The Spanish invaded the capital on 16 April 1578, with the help of Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The Sultan Saiful Rijal and Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Abdul Kahar were forced to flee to Meragang then to [[Jerudong]]. In Jerudong, they made plans to chase the conquering army away from Brunei. Suffering high fatalities due to a [[cholera]] or [[dysentery]] outbreak.<ref>{{Harvnb|Frankham|2008|p=278}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Atiyah|2,02|p=71}}</ref> the Spanish decided to abandon Brunei and returned to Manila on 26 June 1578, after 72 days. Before doing so, they burned the mosque, a high structure with a five-tier roof.<ref>{{Harvnb|Saunders|2002|pp=54–60}}</ref>

Pengiran Seri Lela died in August–September 1578, probably from the same illness suffered by his Spanish allies. There was suspicion he could have been poisoned by the ruling Sultan. Seri Lela's daughter had left with the Spanish. She married a Christian [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], named Agustín de Legazpi de Tondo.<ref>{{Harvnb|Saunders|2002|p=57}}</ref>

The local Brunei accounts<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 41"/> differ greatly from the generally accepted view of events. What was called the Castilian War was seen as a heroic episode, with the Spaniards being driven out by Bendahara Sakam, purportedly a brother of the ruling Sultan, and a thousand native warriors. Most historians consider this to be a [[folk-hero]] account, which probably developed decades or centuries after.<ref>{{Harvnb|Saunders|2002|pp=57–58}}</ref> The country suffered a [[Brunei Civil War|civil war]] from 1660 to 1673.

===British intervention===
[[File:Control of the island of Borneo.png|thumb|right|Boundaries of Brunei (green) since 1890]]
The British have intervened in the affairs of Brunei on several occasions. Britain attacked Brunei in July 1846 due to internal conflicts over who was the rightful Sultan.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|p=52}}</ref>

In the 1880s, the decline of the [[Bruneian Empire]] continued. The Sultan granted land (now Sarawak) to [[James Brooke]], who had helped him quell a rebellion and allowed him to establish the [[Kingdom of Sarawak]]. Over time, Brooke and his nephews (who succeeded him) leased or annexed more land. Brunei lost much of its territory to him and his dynasty, known as the [[White Rajahs]].

Sultan [[Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin]] appealed to the British to stop further encroachment by the Brookes.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=3}}</ref> The "Treaty of Protection" was negotiated by [[Sir Hugh Low]] and signed into effect on 17 September 1888. The treaty said that the Sultan "could not cede or lease any territory to foreign powers without British consent"; it provided [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] effective control over Brunei's external affairs, making it a British [[protectorate]] (which continued until 1984).<ref name=cia/> But, when the Kingdom of Sarawak annexed Brunei's [[Limbang Division|Pandaruan district]] in 1890, the British did not take any action to stop it. They did not regard either Brunei or the Kingdom of Sarawak as 'foreign' (per the Treaty of Protection). This final annexation by Sarawak left Brunei with its current small land mass and separation into two parts.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=58}}</ref>

[[British Resident]]s were introduced in Brunei under the Supplementary Protectorate Agreement in 1906.<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 59">{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=59}}</ref> The Residents were to advise the Sultan on all matters of administration. Over time, the Resident assumed more executive control than the Sultan. The Residential system ended in 1959.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=67}}</ref>

===Discovery of oil===
Petroleum was discovered in 1929 after several fruitless attempts.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=12}}</ref> Two men, F.F. Marriot and T.G. Cochrane, smelled oil near the [[Seria]] river in late 1926.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=13}}</ref> They informed a [[geophysicist]], who conducted a survey there. In 1927, gas seepages were reported in the area. Seria Well Number One (S-1) was drilled on 12 July 1928. Oil was struck at {{convert|297|m}} on 5 April 1929. Seria Well Number 2 was drilled on 19 August 1929, and, as of 2009, continues to produce oil.<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 14">{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=14}}</ref> Oil production was increased considerably in the 1930s with the development of more oil fields. In 1940, oil production was at more than six million barrels.<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 14"/> The British Malayan Petroleum Company (now [[Brunei Shell Petroleum]] Company) was formed on 22 July 1922.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=15}}</ref> The first offshore well was drilled in 1957.<ref>{{cite book|title=Macmillan Atlas|isbn=1420209957|page=15}}</ref> Oil and natural gas have been the basis of Brunei's development and wealth since the late 20th century.

===Japanese occupation===
{{Main|Japanese occupation of British Borneo}}
{{Image|File:Yamato at Brunei.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Japanese battleships at Brunei in October 1944}}
The Japanese invaded Brunei on 16 December 1941, eight days after their [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the United States Navy. They landed 10,000 troops of the [[Kawaguchi Detachment]] from [[Cam Ranh Bay]] at [[Kuala Belait]]. After six days fighting, they occupied the entire country. The only Allied troops in the area were the 2nd Battalion of the [[15th Punjab Regiment]] based at [[Kuching]], Sarawak.<ref>"Brunei under the Japanese occupation", Rozan Yunos, ''Brunei Times'', Bandar Seri Begawan, 29 June 2008</ref>

Once the Japanese occupied Brunei, they made an agreement with [[Ahmad Tajuddin|Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin]] over governing the country. Inche Ibrahim (known later as Pehin Datu Perdana Menteri Dato Laila Utama Awang Haji Ibrahim), a former Secretary to the British Resident, Ernest Edgar Pengilly, was appointed Chief Administrative Officer under the Japanese Governor. The Japanese had proposed that Pengilly retain his position under their administration, but he declined. Both he and other British nationals still in Brunei were interned by the Japanese at [[Batu Lintang camp]] in Sarawak. While the British officials were under Japanese guard, Ibrahim made a point of personally shaking each one by the hand and wishing him well.<ref>"The Japanese Interregnum...," Graham Saunders, ''A history of Brunei'', Edition 2, illustrated, reprint, Routledge, 2002, page 129, ISBN 070071698X, 9780700716982</ref>

The Sultan retained his throne and was given a pension and honours by the Japanese. During the later part of the occupation, he resided at Tantuya, [[Limbang]] and had little to do with the Japanese. Most of the Malay government officers were retained by the Japanese. Brunei's administration was reorganised into five prefectures, which included British [[North Borneo]]. The Prefectures included [[Miri Division|Baram]], [[Labuan]], [[Lawas]], and [[Limbang]]. Ibrahim hid numerous significant government documents from the Japanese during the occupation. Pengiran Yusuf (later YAM Pengiran Setia Negara Pengiran [[Haji Mohd Yusuf]]), along with other Bruneians, was sent to Japan for training. Although in the area the day of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], Yusuf survived.

The British had anticipated a Japanese attack, but lacked the resources to defend the area because of their engagement in the war in Europe. The troops from the Punjab Regiment filled in the [[Seria]] oilfield oilwells with concrete in September 1941 to deny the Japanese their use. The remaining equipment and installations were destroyed when the [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|Japanese invaded Malaya]]. By the end of the war, 16 wells at [[Miri]] and Seria had been restarted, with production reaching about half the pre-war level. Coal production at [[Muara, Brunei|Muara]] was also recommenced, but with little success.
{{Image|File:MasaoBaba Labuan03.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[George Wootten|Major-General Wootten]] of the Australian 9th Division with [[Baba Masao|Lieutenant-General Masao Baba]] of the Japanese 37th Division at the surrender ceremony at Labuan on 10 September 1945}}

During the occupation, the Japanese had their language taught in schools, and Government officers were required to learn Japanese. The local currency was replaced by what was to become known as [[Banana money|''duit pisang''(banana money)]]. From 1943 hyper-inflation destroyed the currency's value and, at the end of the war, this currency was worthless. Allied attacks on shipping eventually caused trade to cease. Food and medicine fell into short supply, and the population suffered famine and disease.

The [[Brunei International Airport|airport]] runway was constructed by the Japanese during the occupation, and in 1943 Japanese naval units were based in [[Brunei Bay]] and Labuan. The naval base was destroyed by Allied bombing, but the airport runway survived. The facility was developed as a public airport. In 1944 the Allies began a bombing campaign against the occupying Japanese, which destroyed much of the town and Kuala Belait, but missed [[Kampong Ayer]].<ref>"Japanese occupation", ''Historical Dictionary of Brunei Darussalam'', Jatswan S. Sidhu, Edition 2, illustrated, Scarecrow Press, 2009, page 115, ISBN 0810870789, 9780810870789</ref>

On 10 June 1945 the [[Australian 9th Division]] landed at Muara under [[Battle of North Borneo|Operation Oboe Six]] to recapture Borneo from the Japanese. They were supported by American air and naval units. Brunei town was bombed extensively and recaptured after three days of heavy fighting. Many buildings were destroyed, including the Mosque. The Japanese forces in Brunei, Borneo, and Sarawak, under Lieutenant-General Masao Baba, formally surrendered at Labuan on 10 September 1945. The British Military Administration took over from the Japanese and remained until July 1946.

===Post-World War II===
After [[World War II]], a new government was formed in Brunei under the [[British Military Administration (Malaya)|British Military Administration]] (BMA).

Before 1941, the Governor of the Straits Settlements, based in Singapore, was responsible for the duties of British High Commissioner for Brunei, [[Sarawak]], and [[North Borneo]] (now [[Sabah]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=81}}</ref> The first [[British High Commissioner]] for Brunei was the Governor of Sarawak, Sir Charles Ardon Clarke.
The Barisan Pemuda ("Youth Movement") (abbreviated as BARIP) was the first political party to be formed in Brunei, on 12 April 1946. The party intended to "preserve the sovereignty of the Sultan and the country, and to defend the rights of the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]]".<ref name="History131">{{cite book|last=A History of Brunei|title=A History of Brunei|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7007-1698-X|page=131|url=http://books.google.com/?id=SQ4t_OJgSjAC&printsec=frontcover|accessdate=14 October 2013|accessdate=14 October 2013}}</ref> BARIP also contributed to the composition of the country’s National Anthem. The party was dissolved in 1948 due to inactivity.

In 1959, a new constitution was written declaring Brunei a self-governing state, while its foreign affairs, security, and defense remained the responsibility of the United Kingdom.<ref name="U.S. DOS" /> A small [[rebellion]] erupted against the monarchy in 1962, which was suppressed with help of the UK. Known as the [[Brunei Revolt]], it contributed to the failure to create the [[North Borneo Federation]]. The rebellion partially affected Brunei's decision to opt out of the Malaysian Federation.<ref name="U.S. DOS" />

Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984.<ref name="U.S. DOS" /> The official National Day, which celebrates the country's independence, is held by tradition on 23 February.

===Writing of the Constitution===
In July 1953, Sultan [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]] formed a seven-member committee named ''Tujuh Serangkai'', to find out the citizens’ views regarding a written constitution for Brunei. In May 1954, the Sultan, Resident and High Commissioner met to discuss the findings of the committee. They agreed to authorise the drafting of a constitution. In March 1959 Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III led a delegation to London to discuss the proposed Constitution.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=98}}</ref> The British delegation was led by Sir [[Alan Lennox-Boyd]], Secretary of State for the Colonies. The British Government later accepted the draft constitution.

On 29 September 1959, the Constitution Agreement was signed in [[Bandar Seri Begawan]]. The agreement was signed by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III and Sir Robert Scott, the Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia.
It included the following provisions:<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 59"/>
* The Sultan was made the Supreme Head of State.
* Brunei was responsible for its internal administration.
* The British Government was responsible for foreign and defence affairs only.
* The post of Resident was abolished and replaced by a British High Commissioner.

Five councils were set up:<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=100}}</ref>
* The Executive Council
* [[Legislative Council of Brunei|The Legislative Council of Brunei]]
* The Privy Council
* The Council of Succession
* The State Religious Council

===National development plans===
A series of National Development Plans were initiated by the 28th Sultan of Brunei, [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]].

The first was introduced in 1953.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=92}}</ref> A total sum of B$100 million was approved by the Brunei State Council for the plan. E.R. Bevington, from the Colonial Office in [[Fiji]], was appointed to implement it.<ref name="History Page 129">{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=129}}</ref> A $US14 million Gas Plant was built under the plan. In 1954, survey and exploration work were undertaken by the Brunei Shell Petroleum on both offshore and onshore fields. By 1956, production reached 114,700 [[barrels per day|bpd]].

The plan also aided the development of public education. By 1958, expenditure on education totaled at $4 million.<ref name="History Page 129" /> Communications were improved, as new roads were built and reconstruction at Berakas Airport was completed in 1954.<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 21">{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=21}}</ref>

The second National Development Plan was launched in 1962.<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 21"/> A major oil and gas field was discovered in 1963, with this discovery, [[Liquefied Natural Gas]] became important. Developments in the oil and gas sector have continued, and oil production has steadily increased since then.<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 96">{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=96}}</ref> The plan also promoted the production of meat and eggs for consumption by citizens. The fishing industry increased its output by 25% throughout the course of the plan. The [[List of Panamax ports|deepwater port]] at [[Muara, Brunei|Muara]] was also constructed during this period. Power requirements were met, and studies were made to provide electricity to rural areas.<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 96"/> Efforts were made to eradicate [[malaria]], an endemic disease in the region, with the help of the [[World Health Organisation]]. The number of malaria cases were reduced from 300 cases in 1953 to only 66 cases in 1959.<ref name="History129">{{cite book|last=A History of Brunei|title=A History of Brunei|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7007-1698-X|page=130|url=http://books.google.com/?id=SQ4t_OJgSjAC&printsec=frontcover|accessdate=14 October 2013|accessdate=14 October 2013}}</ref> The death rate was reduced from 20 per thousand in 1947 to 11.3 per thousand in 1953.<ref name="History129"/> Infectious disease has been prevented by public sanitation and improvement of drainage, and the provision of piped pure water to the population.<ref name="History129"/>

=== Independence ===

==== 1971 Agreement ====
On 14 November 1971, His Royal Highness Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, which then used the title due to it being a protectorate of the UK, left for London to discuss matters regarding the amendments to the 1959 Constitution. A new agreement was signed on 23 November 1971 with the British representative being Anthony Henry Fanshawe Royle.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ministry of Education, Brunei|first=|title=History for Brunei Darussalam|year=2008|publisher=EBP Pan Pacific|isbn=9991725458|page=101|chapter=The Nation Building Years 150-1984}}</ref>

Under this agreement, the following terms were agreed upon - 
* Brunei was granted full internal self - government
* The UK would still be responsible for external affairs and defence.
* Brunei and the UK agreed to share the responsibility for security and defence.

This agreement also caused [[British Military Garrison Brunei|Gurkha units]] to be deployed in Brunei, where they remain up to this day.

==== Anglo-Brunei Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation (1979) ====
On 7 January 1979, another treaty was signed between Brunei and the UK. It was signed with Lord Goronwy-Roberts being the representative of the UK. This agreement granted Brunei to take over international responsibilities as an independent nation. Britain agreed to assist Brunei in diplomatical matters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ministry of Education, Brunei|first=|title=History for Brunei Darussalam|year=2008|publisher=EBP Pan Pacific|isbn=9991725458|page=102|chapter=The Nation Building Years 150-1984}}</ref>

==== Full Independence ====
In May 1983, it was announced by the UK that the date of independence of Brunei would be 1 January 1984.

In 31 December 1983, a mass gathering was held on main mosques on all four of the districts of the country.

At midnight, on 1 January 1984, the Proclamation of Independence was read by His Majesty Hassanal Bolkiah, which is now addressed in this manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/home_news/2009/01/01/reminiscing_bruneis_independence_proclamation|title=Reminiscing Brunei's independence proclamation|publisher=Brunei Times|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>

The national [[flag carrier|air carrier]], [[Royal Brunei Airlines]], is trying to develop Brunei as a modest hub for international travel between Europe and Australia/New Zealand. Central to this strategy is the position that the airline maintains at London Heathrow Airport. It holds a daily slot at the highly capacity-controlled airport, which it serves from Bandar Seri Begawan via Dubai. The airline also has services to major Asian destinations including Shanghai, Bangkok, Singapore and Manila.

Brunei depends heavily on imports such as agricultural products (e.g. rice, [[convenience food|food products]], livestock, etc.),<ref name="agriculture brunei">{{cite web|title=Department of Agriculture, Brunei Darussalam|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.bn/|accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref> [[automobile|motorcars]] and [[consumer electronics|electrical products]] from other countries.<ref>{{cite book|title=Brunei Statistical Year Book|year=2010|publisher=Brunei Government|page=5|url=http://www.depd.gov.bn/SI/BDSYB2010/BDSYB%202010.pdf}}</ref> Brunei imports 60% of its food requirements, of that amount, around 75% come from the ASEAN countries.<ref name="agriculture brunei" />

Brunei's leaders are very concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine internal [[social cohesion]]. But, it has become a more prominent player by serving as chairman for the 2000 [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) forum. Leaders plan to upgrade the [[labour (economics)|labour]] force, reduce unemployment, which currently stands at 6%;<ref name=Hand18>{{cite book|title=Brunei Handbook|page=18|url=http://books.google.com/?id=9q0_LcWREVMC&printsec=frontcover|isbn=9781433004445|author1=Usa|first1=Ibp|last2=Publications|first2=U.S.A.

==Laws and human rights==
===Women===
The government has made efforts to protect women's rights.<ref name="state.gov">[http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eap/154379.htm 2010 Human Rights Report: Brunei Darussalam]. US Department of State</ref> The law prohibits sexual harassment and stipulates that whoever assaults or uses criminal force, intending thereby to outrage or knowing it is likely to outrage the modesty of a person, shall be punished with imprisonment for as much as five years and caning. The law stipulates imprisonment of up to 30 years, and caning with not fewer than 12 strokes for rape. The law does not criminalise spousal rape; it explicitly states that sexual intercourse by a man with his wife, as long as she is not under 13 years of age, is not rape. Protections against sexual assault by a spouse are provided under the amended Islamic Family Law Order 2010 and Married Women Act Order 2010. The penalty for breaching a protection order is a fine not exceeding BN$2,000 ($1,538) or imprisonment not exceeding six months. During the year 23 rape cases were reported; at year's end police were investigating 11 and had forwarded 10 to the Attorney General Chambers.

There is no specific domestic violence law, but arrests have been made in domestic violence cases under the Women and Girls Protection Act. The police investigate domestic violence only in response to a report by a victim. The police were generally responsive in the investigation of such cases. During the year <!--which?--> a total of 62 cases of spousal dispute abuse reported; at year's end, 55 cases were under investigation, and eight had been forwarded to the Attorney General Chambers. The criminal penalty for a minor domestic assault is one to two weeks in gaol and a fine. An assault resulting in serious injury is punishable by caning and a longer prison sentence.

A special unit staffed by female officers has been established within the police department to investigate domestic abuse and child abuse complaints. A hotline was available for persons to report domestic violence. The Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sport's Department of Community Development provides counseling for women and their spouses. Based on individual circumstances, some female and minor victims were placed in protective custody while waiting for their cases to be brought to court. Islamic courts staffed by male and female officials offered counseling to married couples in domestic violence cases. Officials did not encourage wives to reconcile with flagrantly abusive spouses. Islamic courts recognise assault as grounds for divorce.

Couples and individuals have the right to decide the number, spacing, and timing of their children, and have access to contraceptive devices and methods through the government and private clinics. According to information gathered by the UN, in 2008 the maternal mortality rate was an estimated 21 deaths per 100,000 live births. Citizens enjoy free medical and health care, including skilled attendance during childbirth, prenatal care, and essential obstetric and postpartum care. Women had equal access to diagnostic and treatment facilities for [[sexually transmitted diseases]]. Women had equal access to [[HIV]] treatment and counseling, as well as follow-up treatment.

In accordance with the government's interpretation of Qur'anic precepts, Muslim women have rights similar to those of Muslim men in areas such as divorce and child custody. Islamic law requires that males receive twice the inheritance of women. Civil law permits female citizens to pass their nationality on to their children and to own property and other assets, including business properties. Women with permanent positions in the government can now apply for travel allowances for their children. They cannot do so for husbands working in the private sector. With this exception, they receive the same allowance privileges as their college-educated male counterparts. According to government statistics, women made up 57 percent of the civil service force and held 28 percent of senior management posts. Women are not discriminated against in access to employment and business.

===Children===
Citizenship is derived through one's parents rather than through birth within the country's territory. Parents with stateless status are required to apply for a special pass for a child born in the country; failure to register a child may make it difficult to enroll the child in school. By law sexual intercourse with a female under 14 years of age constitutes rape and is punishable by imprisonment for not less than eight years and not more than thirty years and not less than twelve strokes of the cane. The intent of the law is to protect girls from exploitation through prostitution and "other immoral purposes" including pornography.<ref name="state.gov"/>

===Homosexuality===
Male [[homosexuality]] is [[LGBT rights in Brunei|illegal in Brunei]] and can be punished with up to 10 years imprisonment or a fine of $30,000<!--Brunei dollars-->. There are no prohibitions on female homosexuality.<ref name="ILGA 2012">[http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2012.pdf State-sponsored Homophobia A world survey of laws prohibiting same sex activity between consenting adults]</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Brunei}}
[[File:Royal Regalie (1).JPG|thumb|right|Royal Regalia Museum]]
The culture of Brunei is predominantly [[Malay people|Malay]] (reflecting its ethnicity), with heavy influences from [[Islam]], but is seen as much more conservative than [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]].<ref>For a discussion of religious freedom, see [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71334.htm Brunei]. International Religious Freedom Report 2006, United States Department of State.</ref> Influences to Bruneian culture come from the Malay cultures of the [[Malay Archipelago]]. Four periods of cultural influence have occurred, animist, Hindu, Islamic, and Western. Islam had a very strong influence, and was adopted as Brunei's ideology and philosophy.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110511082403/http://www.jpm.gov.bn/pmo1/index.php?view=article&id=185%3Alanguage-and-culture&format=pdf&option=com_content&Itemid=209 Language and Culture]. jpm.gov.bn (28 May 2009)</ref>

==Media==
Media in Brunei are said to be pro-government.
The country has been given "Not Free" status by [[Freedom House]]; press criticism of the government and monarchy is rare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/inc/content/pubs/pfs/inc_country_detail.cfm?country=6929&year=2007&pf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511080900/http://www.freedomhouse.org/inc/content/pubs/pfs/inc_country_detail.cfm?country=6929&year=2007&pf|archivedate=11 May 2008|title=Freedom of the Press – Brunei (2006) |publisher=Freedomhouse.org|accessdate=30 December 2009}}</ref> Nonetheless, the press is not overtly hostile toward alternative viewpoints and is not restricted to publishing only articles regarding the government. The government allowed a printing and publishing company, Brunei Press PLC, to form in 1953. The company continues to print the English daily ''[[Borneo Bulletin]]''. This paper began as a weekly community paper and became a daily in 1990<ref name="bruneipress.com.bn">{{cite web|url=http://www.bruneipress.com.bn/brunei/brunei.html |title=About Brunei |publisher=Bruneipress.com.bn |date=30 July 1998 |accessdate=23 March 2012}}</ref> Apart from The ''Borneo Bulletin'', there is also the ''[[Media Permata]]'' and Pelita Brunei, the local Malay newspapers which are circulated daily.

A private company has made cable television available (Astro-Kristal) as well as one private radio station, Kristal FM.<ref name="bruneipress.com.bn"/>
It also has an online campus radio station, ''[[UBD FM]]'' that streams from its first university, ''[[Universiti Brunei Darussalam]]'<ref>{{cite web|last=UBD Radio Website|title=UBD Radio|url=http://www.ubdfm.blogspot.com/|accessdate=23 December 2011}}</ref>
