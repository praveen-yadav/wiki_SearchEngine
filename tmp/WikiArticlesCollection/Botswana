'''Botswana''' {{IPAc-en|b|ɒ|t|s|w|ɑː|n||ə}}, officially the '''Republic of Botswana''' ({{lang-tn|Lefatshe la Botswana}}), is a [[landlocked country]] located in Southern Africa. The citizens refer to themselves as "Batswana" (singular: Motswana). Formerly the British [[protectorate]] of [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]], Botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] on 30 September 1966. It has held uninterrupted democratic [[Elections in Botswana|elections]] since independence.

Botswana is flat, and up to 70% is covered by the [[Kalahari Desert]]. It is bordered by [[South Africa]] to the south and southeast, [[Namibia]] to the west and north, and [[Zimbabwe]] to the northeast. Its border with [[Zambia]] to the north near [[Kazungula, Zambia]] is poorly defined but at most is a few hundred metres long.<ref>

A mid-sized country of just over two million people, Botswana is one of the [[List of countries by population density|most sparsely populated]] countries in the world. Botswana was one of the poorest countries in Africa when it gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1966, with a GDP per capita of about US$70. Botswana has since transformed itself, becoming one of the fastest-growing economies in the world to a GDP (purchasing power parity) per capita of about $14,000,<ref name=cia/> and a high [[gross national income]], possibly the fourth-largest in Africa, giving the country a modest standard of living.<ref>http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/GNI_PPP_of_countries.htm</ref> The country, being a member of the [[African Union]], also has a strong tradition as a [[representative democracy]] and has the second highest [[Human Development Index]] of continental [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n countries.<ref>http://www.bedia.co.bw/article.php?id_mnu=50</ref>

==History==

{{Main|History of Botswana}}
In the 19th century, hostilities broke out between [[Tswana people|Tswana]] inhabitants of Botswana and [[Ndebele people|Ndebele]] tribes who were making incursions into the territory from the north-east. Tensions also escalated with the Dutch [[Boer]] settlers from the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] to the east. After appeals by the Batswana leaders [[Khama III]], Bathoen and Sebele for assistance, the British Government put "Bechuanaland" under its protection on 31 March 1885.<ref>{{cite web|title=Botswana History|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/botswana/history|publisher=Lonely Planet|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> The northern territory remained under direct administration as the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] and is modern-day Botswana, while the southern territory became part of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] and is now part of the northwest province of South Africa. The majority of [[Setswana]]-speaking people today live in South Africa.

When the [[Union of South Africa]] was formed in 1910 out of the main British colonies in the region, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, [[Basutoland]] (now [[Lesotho]]) and [[Swaziland]] (the "High Commission Territories") were not included, but provision was made for their later incorporation. However, their inhabitants began to be consulted by the UK, and although successive South African governments sought to have the territories transferred, the UK kept delaying; consequently, it never occurred. The election of the [[National Party (South Africa)|Nationalist]] government in 1948, which instituted [[apartheid]], and South Africa's withdrawal from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1961, ended any prospect of incorporation of the territories into South Africa. An expansion of British central authority and the evolution of tribal government resulted in the 1920 establishment of two advisory councils to represent both Africans and Europeans. Proclamations in 1934 regulated tribal rule and powers. A European-African advisory council was formed in 1951, and the 1961 constitution established a consultative legislative council.

In June 1964, the UK accepted proposals for a democratic self-government in Botswana. The seat of government was moved in 1965 from [[Mafeking|Mafikeng]] in South Africa, to the newly established [[Gaborone]], which sits near its border. The 1965 constitution led to the first general elections and to independence on 30 September 1966. [[Seretse Khama]], a leader in the independence movement and the legitimate claimant to the [[Bamangwato|Ngwato]] chiefship, was elected as the first President, going on to be re-elected twice.

The presidency passed to the sitting Vice-President, [[Quett Masire]], who was elected in his own right in 1984 and re-elected in 1989 and 1994. Masire retired from office in 1998, and was succeeded by [[Festus Mogae]], who was elected in his own right in 1999 and re-elected in 2004. The presidency passed in 2008 to [[Ian Khama]] (son of the first President), who had been serving as Mogae's Vice-President since resigning his position in 1998 as Commander of the [[Botswana Defence Force]] to take up this civilian role.

A long-running dispute over the northern border with [[Namibia]]'s [[Caprivi Strip]] was the subject of a ruling by the [[International Court of Justice]] in December 1999, which ruled that [[Kasikili Island]] belongs to Botswana.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southern-eagle.com/namibia/namgeninfo.html |title=Namibia General Information |publisher=Southern-eagle.com |date=21 March 1990 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}</ref>

==Geography==

{{Main|Geography of Botswana|Climate of Botswana}}
[[File:Flying-female-Lechwe.jpg|thumb|left|A [[lechwe]] in the [[Okavango Delta]]]]
At {{convert|581730|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} Botswana is the world's 48th-largest country. It is comparable in size to [[Madagascar]], and is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of [[Texas]] and the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]]. It lies between latitudes [[17th parallel south|17°]] and [[27th parallel south|27°S]], and longitudes [[20th meridian east|20°]] and [[30th meridian east|30°E]].

The country is predominantly flat, tending toward gently rolling [[plateau|tableland]]. Botswana is dominated by the [[Kalahari Desert]], which covers up to 70% of its land surface. The [[Okavango Delta]], one of the world's largest inland [[River deltas|delta]]s, is in the northwest. The [[Makgadikgadi Pan]], a large [[salt pan (geology)|salt pan]], lies in the north.

The [[Limpopo River]] Basin, the major landform of all of southern Africa, lies partly in Botswana, with the basins of its tributaries, the [[Notwane River|Notwane]], [[Bonwapitse River|Bonwapitse]], [[Mahalapswe River|Mahalapswe]], [[Lotsane River|Lotsane]], [[Motloutse River|Motloutse]] and the [[Shashe River|Shashe]], located in the eastern part of the country. The Notwane provides water to the capital through the [[Gaborone Dam]]. The [[Cuando River|Chobe River]] lies to the north, providing a boundary between Botswana and Namibia's [[Zambezi Region]]. The Chobe River meets with the [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]] at a place called [[Kazungula]] (meaning a small [[sausage tree]], a point where [[Sebitwane]] and his [[Makololo|Makololo tribe]] crossed the Zambezi into Zambia).

===Ecology===

Botswana has diverse areas of wildlife habitat. In addition to the delta and desert areas, there are [[grassland]]s and [[savanna]]s, where [[Blue Wildebeest]], [[antelope]]s, and other mammals and birds are found. Northern Botswana has one of the few remaining large populations of the endangered [[African Wild Dog]]. [[Chobe National Park]], found in the [[Chobe District]], has the world's largest concentration of [[African elephant]]s. The park covers about {{convert|11000|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and supports about 350 species of birds.

The Chobe National Park and [[Moremi Game Reserve]] (in the Okavango Delta) are major tourist destinations. Other reserves include the [[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]] located in the Kalahari desert in [[Ghanzi District]]; [[Makgadikgadi Pans National Park]] and [[Nxai Pan National Park]] are in [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]] in the [[Makgadikgadi Pan]]. Mashatu Game Reserve is privately owned: located where the [[Shashe River]] and Limpopo River meet in eastern Botswana. The other privately owned reserve is [[Mokolodi Nature Reserve]] near Gaborone. There are also specialised sanctuaries like the  Khama Rhino Sanctuary (for Rhinoceros) and Makgadikgadi Sanctuary (for Flamingos). They are both located in Central District.

===Environmental problems===

[[File:Baobob tree.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[baobab tree]] (''Adansonia digitata'')]]
Botswana faces two major [[Natural environment|environment]]al problems: drought and [[desertification]]. The desertification problems predominantly stem from the severe times of drought in the country. Three quarters of the country's human and animal populations depend on groundwater due to drought. [[Groundwater]] use through deep borehole drilling has somewhat eased the effects of drought. Surface water is scarce in Botswana and less than 5% of the agriculture in the country is sustainable by rainfall. Due to this 95% of the country raises cattle and livestock as a means for an income. Approximately 71% of the country's land is used for communal [[grazing]], which has been a major cause of the desertification and the accelerating soil erosion of the country.<ref name="rala.is">{{cite web | publisher = Rala | location = IS | url = http://www.rala.is/rade/ralareport/darkoh.pdf | title = Darkoh | format = PDF}}</ref>

Since raising livestock has proven to be profitable for the people of Botswana, the land continues to be exploited. The animal populations have continued to dramatically increase. From 1966 to 1991 the livestock population has increased from 1.7 million to 5.5 million<ref name = "rala.is" />{{rp |64}}. Similarly, the human population has increased from 574,000 in 1971 to 1.5 million in 1995, nearly a 200% increase. “Over 50% of all households in Botswana own cattle, which is currently the largest single source of rural income”. “Rangeland degradation or desertification is regarded as the reduction in land productivity as a result of overstocking and overgrazing or as a result of veld product gathering for commercial use. Degradation is exacerbated by the effects of drought and climate change”.<ref name = "rala.is" /> Environmentalists report that the [[Okavango Delta]] is drying up due to the increased grazing of livestock.<ref name="afrol.com">{{cite web|url= http://www.afrol.com/articles/21794 |title= Botswana, US sign 'Debt-for-Nature' agreement |publisher=Afrol |accessdate = 2010-07-04}}</ref> The Okavango Delta is one of the major semi-forested wetlands in Botswana and one of the largest inland deltas in the world; it is a crucial ecosystem to the survival of many animals.<ref name="afrol.com"/>

The Department of Forestry and Range Resources has already begun to implement a project to reintroduce indigenous vegetation into communities in Kgalagadi South, Kweneng North and Boteti.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = UNCCD | url = http://www.unccd.int/iydd/documents/NOTCDIB.pdf | title = NOTCDIB | format = PDF}}</ref> Reintroduction of indigenous vegetation will help with the degradation of the land. The [[United States Government]] has also entered into an agreement with Botswana, giving them $7 million US dollars to reduce Botswana's debt by $8.3 million US dollars. The stipulation of the US reducing Botswana's debt is that Botswana will focus on more extensive [[Conservation biology|conservation]] of the land.<ref name="afrol.com"/>

The [[United Nations Development Programme]] claims that poverty is a major problem behind the overexploitation of resources, including land, in Botswana. To help change this the UNDP joined in with a project started in the southern community of Struizendam in Botswana. The purpose of the project is to draw from "indigenous knowledge and traditional land management systems". The leaders of this movement are supposed to be the people in the community, to draw them in, in turn increasing their possibilities to earn an income and thus decreasing poverty. The UNDP also stated that the government has to effectively implement policies to allow people to manage their own local resources and are giving the government information to help with policy development<ref name = "afrol1">{{cite web | url = http://www.afrol.com/articles/13090 | title = Botswana villages fighting desertification |publisher=Afrol |accessdate=2010-07-04}}</ref>

==Politics and government==

{{Main|Politics of Botswana|Human rights in Botswana}}
{{See also|Foreign relations of Botswana}}
[[File:BotswanaParliament.jpg|thumb|House of the Parliament of Botswana in [[Gaborone]]]]
The [http://www.botswanaembassy.org/files/constitution_of_botswana.pdf Constitution of Botswana] is the [[rule of law]] which protects the citizens of Botswana and represents their rights to freedom, life, and liberty. The politics of Botswana take place in a framework of a [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[President of Botswana]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Parliament of Botswana]]. [[Botswana general election, 2009|The most recent election]], its tenth, was held on 16 October 2009.

Since independence was declared, the party system has been dominated by the [[Botswana Democratic Party]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. According to [[Transparency International]], Botswana is the least corrupt country in Africa and ranks similarly close to Portugal and South Korea.<ref>Transparency International [http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table 2008 Corruption Perception Index 2008].

===Foreign relations and military===

{{Main|Botswana Defence Force}}
At the time of independence, Botswana had no armed forces. It was only after the [[Rhodesia]]n and [[South African Army|South African]] militaries struck respectively against [[ZIPRA]] and [[Umkhonto we Sizwe|MK]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-20/news/mn-6620_1_african-national-congress | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Michael | last=Parks | title=S.

The BDF has approximately 12,000 members.

Following political changes in South Africa and the region, the BDF's missions have increasingly focused on prevention of [[poaching]], [[Emergency management|preparing for disasters]], and foreign [[peacekeeping]]. The United States has been the largest single foreign contributor to the development of the BDF, and a large segment of its officer corps have received U.S. training. It is considered an apolitical and professional institution.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The Botswana government gave the United States the green light to explore the possibility of establishing an Africa Command (Africom) base in the country.

==Administrative divisions==

The [http://www.mti.gov.bw/ Ministry of Trade and Industry of Botswana] is responsible for promoting [[business development]] throughout the country. According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], economic growth averaged over 9% per year from 1966 to 1999. Botswana has a [[List of countries by economic freedom|high level of economic freedom]] compared to other African countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.botswanaifsc.com/news/botswana_ranked_africas_leader.html |title=Botswana ranked Africa's leader in economic freedom }}</ref> The government has maintained a sound [[fiscal policy]], despite consecutive [[Government budget deficit|budget deficits]] in 2002 and 2003, and a negligible level of [[External debt|foreign debt]]. It earned the highest sovereign [[credit rating]] in Africa and has stockpiled foreign exchange reserves (over $7 billion in 2005/2006) amounting to almost two and a half years of current imports.

An array of financial institutions populates the country's financial system, with pension funds and commercial banks being the two most important segments by asset size. Banks remain profitable, well-capitalized, and liquid, as a result of growing national resources and high interest rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/botswana/botswana-financial-sector-profile.html |title=MFW4A Botswana Financial Sector Profile |publisher=Mfw4a.org |accessdate=2011-08-21}}</ref>

[[File:Botswana trade.png|thumb|left|Botswana's trading partners in 2004.<ref name=cia/>]]
The constitution prohibits the nationalization of private property and provides for an independent judiciary, and the government respects this in practice. The legal system is sufficient to conduct secure commercial dealings, although a serious and growing backlog of cases prevents timely trials. The protection of intellectual property rights has improved significantly. Botswana is ranked second only to South Africa among sub-Saharan Africa countries in the 2009 International Property Rights Index.

While generally open to foreign participation in its economy, Botswana reserves some sectors for citizens. Increased foreign investment plays a significant role in the privatization of state-owned enterprises. Investment regulations are transparent, and bureaucratic procedures are streamlined and open, although somewhat slow. Investment returns such as profits and dividends, debt service, capital gains, returns on intellectual property, royalties, franchise's fees, and service fees can be repatriated without limits.

Botswana imports refined petroleum products and electricity from South Africa. There is some domestic production of electricity from coal. In spite of one the highest insolation levels in the world, Botswana has no significant solar energy capacity.

===Gemstones and precious metals===

In Botswana, the [http://www.mines.gov.bw/ Department of Mines] and [http://www.gov.bw/ Ministry of Minerals, Energy and Water Resources], led by Hon Onkokame Kitso Mokaila in Gabrone, maintain data regarding mining throughout the country.

Government announced in early 2009 that they would try to shift their economic dependence on diamonds, over serious concern that diamonds are predicted to dry out in Botswana over the next twenty years.

Botswana’s Orapa mine is the largest diamond mine in the world in terms of value produced annually.

==Demographics==

{{Main|Demographics of Botswana}}
[[File:Gathering food in the Okavango.jpg|thumb|A girl in the [[Okavango Delta]].]]

The [[Tswana people|Tswana]] are the majority ethnic group in Botswana, making up 79% of the population. The largest minority ethnic groups are the [[BaKalanga]], [[Bushmen]] or [[AbaThwa]] also known as Basarwa. Other tribes are [[Bayei]], Bambukushu, [[Basubia]], Baherero and Bakgalagadi. In addition, there are small numbers of whites and Indians, both groups being roughly equally small in number. [[Indians in Botswana|Botswana's Indian]] population is made up of many Indian-Africans of several generations, from Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, South Africa, and so on, as well as first generation Indian immigrants. The white population speaks English and [[Afrikaans]] and makes up roughly 3% of the population.

===Language===

{{Main|Languages of Botswana|Setswana}}
The official language of Botswana is English although [[Tswana language|Setswana]] is widely spoken across the country.

These prefixes include "Bo", which refers to the country, "Ba", which refers to the people, "Mo", which is one person, and "Se" which is the language. For example, the main tribe of Botswana is the Tswana people, hence the name Botswana for its country. The people as a whole are Batswana, one person is a Motswana, and the language they speak is Setswana.
Other languages spoken in Botswana include [[Kalanga language|Kalanga]] (sekalanga), [[Tshwa language|Sarwa]] (sesarwa), [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]] and in some parts [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]].

Besides referring to the language of the dominant people groups in Botswana, Setswana is the adjective used to describe the rich cultural traditions of the Batswana-whether construed as members of the Tswana ethnic groups or of all citizens of Botswana.
The Scottish writer Alexander McCall Smith has written popular novels ([[No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency]] series) about Botswana that entertain as well as inform the reader about the culture and customs of Botswana.

===Music===

{{Main|Music of Botswana}}
Botswana music is mostly vocal and performed sometimes without drums depending on the occasion; it also makes heavy use of string instruments. Botswana folk music has instruments such as Setinkane (a Botswana version of miniature piano), Segankure/Segaba (a Botswana version of the Chinese instrument Ehru), Moropa (Meropa -plural) (a Botswana version of drums; they have a variety of drums), phala (a Botswana version of a whistle used mostly during celebrations. It comes in variety of forms too). Botswana cultural musical instruments are not confined only to the strings or drums. the hands are used as musical instruments too, by either clapping them together or against phathisi( goat skin turned inside out wrapped around the calf area; it is only used by men) to create music and rhythm. For the last few decades, the guitar has been celebrated as a versatile music instrument for Tswana music as it offers a variety in string which the Segaba instrument does not have. It is the outsider that found a home within the culture. The highlight of any celebration or event that shows especially happiness is the dancing. This differs by regime, age, gender and status in the group or if its a tribal activity, your status in the community. The national anthem is [[Fatshe leno la rona]]. Written and composed by Kgalemang Tumediso Motsete, it was adopted upon independence in 1966. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Visual arts===

{{Main|Art of Botswana}}
In the northern part of Botswana, women in the villages of [[Etsha]] and [[Gumare]] are noted for their skill at crafting [[basket]]s from [[Mokola Palm]] and local [[dye]]s. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage, large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. The artistry of these baskets is being steadily enhanced through color use and improved designs as they are increasingly produced for commercial use.

Other notable artistic communities include [[Thamaga Pottery]] and [[Oodi Weavers]], both located in the southeastern part of Botswana.

The oldest paintings from both Botswana and South Africa depict hunting, animal and human figures, and were made by the Khoisan (!Kung San/[[Bushmen]]) over twenty thousand years ago within the [[Kalahari]] desert.

===Food===

==Education==

[[File:University of Botswana dorms.jpg|thumb|Residential hall of the [[University of Botswana]] in Gaborone, Botswana]]
{{Main|Education in Botswana}}

Botswana has made great strides in educational development since independence in 1966. At that time there were very few graduates in the country and only a very small percentage of the population attended secondary school. Botswana increased its adult literacy rate from 69% in 1991 to 83% in 2008.<ref name="ref">{{cite web|url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org |title=UNESCO Institute for Statistics |publisher=Stats.uis.unesco.org |accessdate=2011-08-21}}</ref>

With the discovery of diamonds and the increase in government revenue that this brought, there was a huge increase in educational provision in the country. All students were guaranteed ten years of basic education, leading to a Junior Certificate qualification. Approximately half of the school population attends a further two years of secondary schooling leading to the award of the [[Botswana General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (BGCSE). Secondary education in Botswana is neither free nor compulsory.

After leaving school, students can attend one of the six technical colleges in the country, or take vocational training courses in [[teaching]] or [[nursing]]. The best students enter the [[University of Botswana]], [[Botswana College of Agriculture]], and the [[Botswana Accountancy College]] in Gaborone. Many other students end up in the numerous private tertiary education colleges around the country. Notable amongst these is [http://www.bothocollege.ac.bw/ Botho University], the country's first private university which offers undergraduate programmes in Accounting, Business and Computing. Another international university is the [[Limkokwing University of Creative Technology]] which offers various Associate Degrees in Creative Arts.<ref>http://www.limkokwing.net/botswana/</ref>  Other tertiary institutions include [http://www.baisago.co.bw/ Ba Isago], ABM University College, [http://www.neweracollege.ac.bw/ New Era], [http://www.gips.ac.bw/gips.php Gaborone Institute of Professional Studies] etc. Tremendous strides in providing quality education have been made by private education providers such that a large number of the best students in the country are now applying to them as well.A vast majority of these students are government sponsored. A larger influx of tertiary students is expected when construction of the nation's second international university, The [[Botswana International University of Science and Technology]], is completed in [[Palapye]].

The quantitative gains have not always been matched by qualitative ones. Primary schools in particular still lack resources, and the teachers are less well paid than their secondary school colleagues. The [[Botswana Ministry of Education]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.bw/index.php?id=10 |title=Ministry of Education and Skills Development: Home |publisher=Moe.gov.bw |date=27 July 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}</ref> is working to establish libraries in primary schools in partnership with the [[African Library Project]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africanlibraryproject.org/about-us/our-partners/139-library-partner-botswana-ministry-of-education |title=Library Partner – Botswana Ministry of Education |publisher=Africanlibraryproject.org |accessdate=2011-08-21}}</ref> The [[Government of Botswana]] hopes that by investing a large part of national income in education, the country will become less dependent on diamonds for its economic survival, and less dependent on expatriates for its skilled workers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Botswana invests 21% of its government spending in education.<ref name="ref" />

In January 2006, Botswana announced the reintroduction of school fees after two decades of free state education<ref>BBC News website, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4601360.stm Botswana brings back school fees]. Retrieved 2009-23-7.</ref> though the government still provides full scholarships with living expenses to any Botswana citizen in university, either at the University of Botswana or if the student wishes to pursue an education in any field not offered locally, such as medicine, they are provided with a full scholarship to study abroad.

==Health==

{{Main|Health in Botswana}}
The [http://www.moh.gov.bw/ Ministry of Health] in Botswana is responsible for overseeing the quality and distribution of [[healthcare]] throughout the country. [[Life expectancy]] at birth was 55 in 2009 according to the World Bank, having previously fallen from a peak of 64.1 in 1990 to a low of 49 in 2002.<ref>{{cite web | title=World Bank Botswana Data |url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/botswana | accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>

The [[Cancer Association of Botswana]] is a voluntary non-governmental organization. The association is a member of the Union for International Cancer Control. The Association supplements existing services through provision of cancer prevention and health awareness programmes, facilitating access to health services for cancer patients and offering support and counseling to those affected.<ref name="UICC Cancer Association of Botswana">{{cite web|publisher=Union for International Cancer Control |url=http://www.uicc.org/membership/cancer-association-botswana |title=Cancer Association of Botswana |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>

===HIV/AIDS Epidemic===

{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Botswana}}
[[File:Life expectancy in some Southern African countries 1958 to 2003.png|thumb|Life expectancy in several African countries from 1958 to 2003. Botswana had the highest life expectancy until [[HIV/AIDS]] began to reduce it in the late 1980s.]]

Like elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, the [[economic impact of AIDS]] is considerable. Economic development spending was cut by 10% in 2002–3 as a result of recurring budget deficits and rising expenditure on healthcare services. [[HIV/AIDS in Botswana|Botswana has been hit]] very hard by the [[AIDS pandemic]]; in 2006 it was estimated that life expectancy at birth had dropped from 65 to 35 years.<ref name=Kallings>{{Cite journal|journal=J Intern Med| year = 2008 | volume = 263 | issue = 3 | pages = 218–43| title=The first postmodern pandemic: 25 years of HIV/AIDS|author=Kallings LO|doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2007.01910.x |pmid=18205765|url= http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2007.01910.x}}</ref>

The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Botswana was estimated at 24% for adults in 2006.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = UNAIDS | url = http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/HIVData/GlobalReport/2006/ | title = Global Report | year = 2006}}</ref> In 2003, the government began a comprehensive program involving free or cheap generic anti-retroviral drugs as well as an information campaign designed to stop the spread of the virus. Under the leadership of [[Festus Mogae]], the Government of Botswana solicited outside help in fighting HIV/AIDS and received early support from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], the Merck Foundation, and together formed the African Comprehensive HIV AIDS Partnership (ACHAP). Other early partners include the [[Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute]], of the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] and the [[Botswana-UPenn Partnership]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report, universal access to treatment – as defined as 80% coverage or greater – has been achieved in Botswana.<ref>[http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/unaidspublication/2011/JC2216_WorldAIDSday_report_2011_en.pdf UNAIDS World AIDS Day Report 2011]. unaids.org</ref>

Potential reasons for Botswana's high HIV prevalence include concurrent sexual partnerships, transactional sex, cross-generational sex, and a significant number of people who travel outside of their local communities in pursuit of work. The promiscuous nature of many sexual relationships further impacts the health situation{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, to the extent that it has given rise to a Love Vocabulary<ref>{{cite web | title=Exposing Botswana's Love Vocabulary | url=http://drshem.com/2011/06/16/exposing-botswana-love-vocabulary/ | work=Exposing Botswana's Love Vocabulary | accessdate=2011-06-22}}</ref> that is unique to the region.

Approximately one in six [[Tswana people|Batswana]] has HIV, giving Botswana the second highest infection rate in the world after nearby [[Swaziland]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.avert.org/aidsbotswana.htm |title=HIV and Aids in Botswana | publisher = Avert (International Aids Charity) | accessdate = 2009-23-7}}</ref> The government recognizes that AIDS will affect the economy and is trying to combat the epidemic, including free [[Antiretroviral drug|anti-retroviral drug]] treatment and a nation-wide Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission program. Botswana has reduced HIV transmission from infected mothers to their children from about 40% to just 4%.
