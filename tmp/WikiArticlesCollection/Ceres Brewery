'''Ceres Brewery''' was a [[brewery]] located in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]]. it was part of [[Royal Unibrew]]. The factory was closed in 2008.

==History==
Ceres Brewery was founded by a [[grocer]] named Malthe Conrad Lottrup, with help from the [[chemist]]s A. S. Aagard and Knud Redelien, as the city's seventh brewery. It was named after the [[Rome|Roman]] goddess [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], and its opening was announced in the local newspaper, ''Stiftstidende'', in 1856.

The brewery was successful, and Lottrup became one of the most prominent people of Aarhus. After ten years, he extended the brewery, adding a grand building as his own private residence, where he entertained other local figures.

Lottrup's son-in-law, Laurits Christian Meulengracht, took over the running of the brewery after that, and was in charge for nearly thirty years, expanding it further. He then sold it to another brewery, [[Østjyske Bryggerier A/S]].

The brewery gained more esteem in 1914 when it was made "Purveyor to the Royal Danish Court".

In 2008 the factory closed because of the brewery could not live up to expectations from Royal Unibrew.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tv2oj.dk/artikel/16464 | title = Nu er det officielt: Ceres lukker | publisher = Tv2oj (Danish) | accessdate = 2008-01-07 }}</ref>
