{{Tanakh OT}}
The superscription of the '''Book of Zephaniah''' attributes its authorship to “Zephaniah son of Cushi son of Gedaliah son of Amariah son of [[Hezekiah]], in the days of King [[Josiah]] son of [[Amon of Judah|Amon]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]” (1:1, [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]]). All that is known of [[Zephaniah]] comes from the text. The superscription of the book is lengthier than most and contains two features. The name Cushi, Zephaniah’s father, means ‘[[Ethiopia]]n’. In a society where genealogy was considered extremely important because of [[Tetragrammaton|God's]] covenant with [[Abraham]] and his descendants, the author may have felt compelled to establish his [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] lineage.  

The author of Zephaniah does not shrink from condemning the Cushites or Ethiopians. Chapter 2:12 contains a succinct but unequivocal message: “You also, O Ethiopians, / Shall be killed by my sword.”{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Some question whether the translation "You, also, O Ethiopians / Shall be killed by my sword" is a good translation, given the fact that Ethiopia is a long way away from Jerusalem.

As with many of the other prophets, there is no external evidence to directly associate composition of the book with a prophet by the name of Zephaniah. Some scholars believe that much of the material does not date from the days of King [[Josiah]] (ca. 640–609 BC), but is actually post-monarchic. Three general possibilities are that a person, possibly named Zephaniah, prophesied the words of the book of Zephaniah; the general message of a Josianic prophet is conveyed through the book of Zephaniah; or the name could have been employed, either during the monarchic or post-monarchic period, as a ‘speaking voice’, possibly for rhetorical purposes. Although it is possible that a post-monarchic author assumed the persona of a monarchic prophet to add credibility to his message, there is no evidence to support such a claim.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The prophetic book of the Bible attributed to Zephaniah occurs ninth among the twelve [[minor prophet]]s, preceded by [[Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk]] and followed by [[Book of Haggai|Haggai]]. Zephaniah (or Tzfanya, Sophonias, צפניה, Ẓəfanya, Ṣəp̄anyāh) means 'the Lord conceals',or 'the Lord protects'.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Date==
If the superscription of the book of Zephaniah is a reliable indicator of the time that the bulk of the book was composed, then Zephaniah was a contemporary of the prophet [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] (or Jeremias). King [[Josiah]] ruled over [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] from approximately 640–609 BC. Some scholars believe that the picture of [[Jerusalem]] which Zephaniah gives indicates that he was active prior to the religious reforms of King Josiah which are described in 2 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 23. These reforms took place in 622 BC.  Scholars{{Who|date=May 2011}} also cite the reference to “the officials and the king’s sons . . .” in 1:8 as evidence that the kingdom was still ruled by a regent for Josiah. The portrait of foreign nations in chapter 2 also indicates the late seventh century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Probably the first prophet following the prophecies of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] and the violent reign of [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]]. Both Zephaniah and [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] urged King [[Josiah]] to enact religious reforms, which he eventually did.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Other scholars{{Who|date=September 2007}} have presented evidence pointing to a post-monarchic date (as late as 200 BC) based on language and theme, although the book might still have been based on an earlier composition.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Purpose==
There are two possible reasons for the creation of the book of Zephaniah. Either way, the primary purpose of the book’s composition was to alter the behaviour (particularly religious behaviour) of the author’s contemporary Jerusalemites.{{OR|date=May 2011}}

If the book of Zephaniah was largely composed during the monarchic period, the author of the book of Zephaniah attempts to accomplish this change in behaviour through the threat of future calamity for “those who have turned back from following the Lord, / who have not sought the Lord or inquired of him” (1:6). The author conceives of a date in the future – the ‘great day of the Lord’ – when [[Tetragrammaton|the Lord]] will judge all the people of the earth. This coming judgment will affect all of the nations, including the author’s own nation of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] where God is understood to reside. The threats made against [[Jerusalem]], however, are much more specific than the oracles concerning foreign nations. This strengthened the belief that the Israelites, who understood themselves to be God’s chosen people, were even more culpable than other peoples for not living up to God’s statutes because they were to be a ‘light unto the nations’. The book concludes by extending a promise of deliverance to the remnant of [[Israel]] which remains. The fulfilment of this prophecy is commonly understood to have taken place when Judah was captured by the nation of [[Babylon]] and many of its inhabitants were exiled in an event known as the [[Babylonian captivity]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}<!--Citation needed for the whole paragraph --> 

If the book gained most of its present form in post-monarchic period, then the author likely intended to draw upon an understanding of the [[Babylonian captivity]] as a punishment from the Lord, urging his own contemporaries not to repeat the mistakes of the past. It is not known whether the religious syncretism, alluded to in chapter one (as in verse 5), was a significant issue in post-exilic [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}<!--Citation needed for the whole paragraph -->

The book of Zephaniah consists of three chapters in the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Masoretic Text]]. In English versions, the book is also divided into three chapters. The [[New Revised Standard Version]] of the Bible supplies headings for the book as follows:{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

It is important to note that there are a number of different sub-divisions in use for the text with no clear consensus.{{OR||date=May 2011}}

Despite its relatively short length, the book of Zephaniah incorporates a number of common prophetic themes. Zephaniah includes one of the most vivid descriptions in the prophetic literature of God’s wrath. Yet, it is also unequivocal in its proclamation of a restoration for those who survive the ‘[[Last Judgement|Great Day of the Lord']].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The book of Zephaniah incorporates a good deal of phrases and terminology which are found in other books of the Bible. This suggests that the author of Zephaniah was familiar with and drew upon earlier Israelite religious tradition and also that later biblical writers regarded the book of Zephaniah as an authoritative (or at least respectable) work in the prophetic corpus.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The book of Zephaniah draws upon several themes from the [[Book of Genesis]] and reverses them. The opening verses of the book of Zephaniah are reminiscent both of the creation and of [[Noah]]’s flood. Chapter 1:2–3 declare that “I will sweep away everything / from the face of the earth says the Lord. / I will sweep away humans and animals; I will sweep away the birds of the air / and the fish of the sea.” The order of the creatures to be destroyed in Zephaniah is the opposite of the order in which they are created in Genesis 1:20–27. It is also worth noting that in both Noah’s flood and Zephaniah’s [[Last Judgement|Day of the Lord]], a ‘remnant’ survives God’s wrath.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

It is also not surprising that the book of Zephaniah bears marked similarities to the book of [[Deuteronomy]] and the Deuteronomistic history. Similarities might be expected to each of these works because the Deuteronomistic history covers an overlapping period of time and because the issues which are dealt with in the book of Zephaniah go straight to the heart of the covenant which is reaffirmed in the book of Deuteronomy before Israel enters into the [[Promised Land]] of [[Canaan]]. The first 3–4 of the [[Ten Commandments]] (or Ten Words, Decalogue) contained in Exodus 20:1–17 and Deuteronomy 5:1–22 directly concern Israel’s relationship with [[Yahweh]]. It is this integral component of the covenant between [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] and [[Israel]] which is threatened by the practices to which the author of the book of Zephaniah refers in 1:4–6. In this manner, Zephaniah invokes one of the most common themes, not only in prophetic literature, but in the whole of the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Scriptures]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Zephaniah also draws upon the emerging idea that [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] is quite different from the regional or tribal gods of the surrounding nations. Rather, [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] is beginning to be understood as the only God and the God who rules over all nations. It was an apparently unique belief in the ancient [[Middle East]] that a god could send a foreign nation to execute that god’s judgment (as the Israelites believed [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] did with [[Babylon]]). In the book of Zephaniah, all nations are portrayed as being subject to [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]]’s divine judgment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The book of Zephaniah also interacts with the prophetic tradition – both borrowing from and contributing to the corpus in terms of language and images.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
