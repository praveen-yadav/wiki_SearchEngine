'''Ara''' is a southern [[constellation]] situated between [[Scorpius]] and [[Triangulum Australe]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for "[[altar]]". Ara was one of the 48 Greek constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the [[International Astronomical Union]].

{{see also|List of stars in Ara}}

Ara contains part of the Milky Way to the south of [[Scorpius]] and thus has rich star fields.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}

* '''[[Alpha Arae|α Ara]]''' is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 2.8, 242 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}
* '''[[Beta Arae|β Ara]]''' is an orange-hued supergiant of magnitude 2.8, 600 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}
* '''[[Gamma Arae|γ Ara]]''' is a blue-hued supergiant of magnitude 3.3, 1140 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}
* '''[[Delta Arae|δ Ara]]''' is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 3.6, 187 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}
* '''[[Zeta Arae|ζ Ara]]''' is an orange-hued giant of magnitude 3.1, 574 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}

The constellation's stars have no names in [[Western culture]], but the [[Culture of China|Chinese]] call [[Alpha Arae|α Arae]] "Choo" ("club" or "staff"), and [[Epsilon Arae|ε Arae]] "Tso Kang", meaning 'left guard'.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

=== Deep-sky objects ===

The northwest corner of Ara is crossed by the [[Milky Way]] and contains several [[open cluster]]s (notably [[NGC 6200]]) and [[diffuse nebula]]e (including the bright cluster/nebula pair [[NGC 6188]] and [[NGC 6193]]). The brightest of the [[globular cluster]]s, sixth magnitude [[NGC 6397]], lies at a distance of just {{convert|6500|ly|km}}, making it one of the closest globular cluster to the [[solar system]].{{sfn|Dunlop|2005}}

Although Ara lies close to the heart of the Milky Way, two [[spiral galaxies]] (NGC 6215 and NGC 6221) are visible near star [[Eta Arae|η Arae]].{{sfn|Dunlop|2005}}

==== Open clusters ====

* [[NGC 6193]] is an [[open cluster]] containing approximately 30 stars with an overall magnitude of 5.0 and a size of 0.25 square degrees, about half the size of the [[full Moon]]. It is approximately 4200 light-years from Earth. It has one bright member, a double star with a blue-white hued primary of magnitude 5.6 and a secondary of magnitude 6.9. NGC 6193 is surrounded by [[NGC 6188]], a faint [[nebula]] only normally visible in [[astrophotography|long-exposure photographs]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}

* [[NGC 6200]]
* NGC 6204
* NGC 6208
* NGC 6250
* NGC 6253
* IC 4651

==== Globular clusters ====

* NGC 6352
* [[NGC 6362]]
* [[NGC 6397]] is a [[globular cluster]] with an overall magnitude of 6.0; it is visible to the naked eye under exceptionally dark skies and is normally visible in binoculars. It is a fairly close globular cluster, at a distance of 10,500 light-years.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}

The [[Stingray Nebula]] (Hen 3-1357), the youngest known planetary nebula as of 2010, formed in Ara; the light from its formation was first observable around 1987.

== Illustrations ==

[[File:Ara Bode.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johann Elert Bode]]'s illustration of Ara, from his ''Uranographia'' (1801)]]
In illustrations, Ara is usually depicted as an [[altar]] with its smoke 'rising' southward.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Ara}} However, depictions of Ara often vary in their details. In the early days of printing, a 1482 [[woodcut]] of [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]]'s classic ''Poeticon Astronomicon'' depicts the altar as surrounded by demons.<ref name=Kanas>{{cite book|last=Kanas|first=Nick|title=History, Artistry, and Cartography (Second Edition)|year=2012|publisher=Praxis Publishing|location=Chichester, U.K.|isbn=978-1-4614-0916-8|page=136|url=http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-0917-5}}</ref>  [[Johann Bayer]] in 1603 depicted Ara as an altar with burning incense; the flames rise southward as in most atlases. [[Hyginus]] also depicted Ara as an altar with burning incense, though his Ara featured devils on either side of the flames. However, [[Willem Blaeu]], a Dutch uranographer active in the 16th and 17th centuries, drew Ara as an altar designed for sacrifice, with a burning animal offering. Unlike most depictions, the smoke from Blaeu's Ara rises northward, represented by [[Alpha Arae]]. A more unusual depiction of Ara comes from [[Aratus]], a Greek uranographer, in 270 BCE. He drew Ara as a lighthouse, where Alpha. [[Beta Arae|Beta]], [[Epsilon Arae|Epsilon]], and [[Zeta Arae]] represent the base, and [[Eta Arae]] represents the flames at the lighthouse's light.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=230}}

== Mythology ==

In ancient [[Greek mythology]], Ara was identified as the altar where the gods first made offerings and formed an alliance before defeating the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}} The nearby [[Milky Way]] represents the smoke rising from the offerings on the altar.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=229}}

== Equivalents ==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of the constellation Ara lie within ''[[Azure Dragon|The Azure Dragon of the East]]'' (東方青龍, ''Dōng Fāng Qīng Lóng'').{{sfn|AEEA|2006}}

== Namesakes ==

[[USS Ara (AK-136)]] was a [[United States Navy]] [[Crater class cargo ship]] named after the constellation.
