{{affix}}
An '''affix''' is a [[morpheme]] that is attached to a word [[stem (linguistics)|stem]] to form a new word. Affixes may be [[derivation (linguistics)|derivational]], like English ''-ness'' and ''pre-'', or [[inflection]]al, like English plural ''-s'' and past tense ''-ed''. They are [[bound morpheme]]s by definition; prefixes and suffixes may be [[separable affix]]es. Affixation is, thus, the linguistic process speakers use to form different words by adding morphemes (affixes) at the beginning (prefixation), the middle (infixation) or the end (suffixation) of words.

==Positional categories of affixes==
Affixes are divided into plenty of categories, depending on their position with reference to the stem. ''Prefix'' and ''suffix'' are extremely common terms. ''Infix'' and ''circumfix'' are less so, as they are not important in European languages. The other terms are uncommon.

''Prefix'' and ''suffix'' may be subsumed under the term ''adfix'' in contrast to ''infix.''

When marking text for [[interlinear gloss]]ing, as in the third column in the chart above, simple affixes such as prefixes and suffixes are separated from the stem with hyphens. Affixes which disrupt the stem, or which themselves are discontinuous, are often marked off with angle brackets. Reduplication is often shown with a tilde. Affixes which cannot be segmented are marked with a back slash.

==Lexical affixes==
''Lexical affixes'' (or ''semantic affixes'') are bound elements that appear as affixes, but function as [[incorporated noun]]s within verbs and as elements of [[compound noun]]s. In other words, they are similar to word roots/stems in function but similar to affixes in form. Although similar to incorporated nouns, lexical affixes differ in that they never occur as freestanding nouns, i.e. they always appear as affixes.

Lexical affixes are relatively rare. The [[Wakashan languages|Wakashan]], [[Salishan languages|Salishan]], and [[Chimakuan languages]] all have lexical suffixes — the presence of these is an [[areal feature]] of the Pacific Northwest of the [[North America]].

The lexical suffixes of these languages often show little to no resemblance to free nouns with similar meanings. Compare the lexical suffixes and free nouns of [[Saanich language|Northern Straits Saanich]] written in the Saanich orthography and in [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist notation]]:

|}

Lexical suffixes when compared with free nouns often have a more generic or general meaning. For instance, one of these languages may have a lexical suffix that means water in a general sense, but it may not have any noun equivalent referring to water in general and instead have several nouns with a more specific meaning (such "saltwater", "whitewater", etc.). In other cases, the lexical suffixes have become [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to various degrees. 

Some linguists have claimed that these lexical suffixes provide only adverbial or adjectival notions to verbs. Other linguists disagree arguing that they may additionally be syntactic [[Verb argument|arguments]] just as free nouns are and thus equating lexical suffixes with incorporated nouns. Gerdts (2003) gives examples of lexical suffixes in the [[Halkomelem language]] (the [[word order]] here is [[verb–subject–object]]):

| łə słeniʔ
|
|-
|
| colspan="3" | "the woman <span style="color:#d30000"><u>baby</u></span>-washed"
|}

In sentence (1), the verb "wash" is {{unicode|'''šak’ʷətəs'''}} where {{unicode|'''šak’ʷ-'''}} is the root and {{unicode|'''-ət'''}} and {{unicode|'''-əs'''}} are inflectional suffixes. The subject "the woman" is {{unicode|'''łə słeniʔ'''}} and the object <span style="color:#008000">"the baby"</span> is <span style="color:#008000">{{unicode|'''łə qeq'''}}</span>. In this sentence, "the baby" is a free noun. (The {{unicode|'''niʔ'''}} here is an [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]], which can be ignored for explanatory purposes.)

In sentence (2), <span style="color:#d30000">"baby"</span> does not appear as a free noun. Instead it appears as the lexical suffix <span style="color:#d30000">{{unicode|'''-əyəł'''}}</span> which is affixed to the verb root {{unicode|'''šk’ʷ-'''}} (which has changed slightly in pronunciation, but this can also be ignored here). Note how the lexical suffix is neither "the baby" ([[definiteness|definite]]) nor "a baby" (indefinite); such referential changes are routine with incorporated nouns.

==Orthographic affixes==
In [[orthography]], the terms for affixes may be used for the smaller elements of conjunct characters. For example, [[Maya script|Maya glyphs]] are generally compounds of a ''main sign'' and smaller ''affixes'' joined at its margins. These are called ''prefixes, superfixes, postfixes,'' and ''subfixes'' according to their position to the left, on top, to the right, or at the bottom of the main glyph. A small glyph placed inside another is called an ''infix.''<ref>Robert Sharer & Loa Traxler, 2006, ''The Ancient Maya,'' Stanford University Press. ISBN 0-8047-4817-9</ref> Similar terminology is found with the conjunct consonants of the [[Indic alphabets]]. For example, the [[Tibetan alphabet]] utilizes prefix, suffix, superfix, and subfix consonant letters.<ref>[[Andrew West]], [http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2006/09/precomposed-tibetan-part-1-brdarten.html "Precomposed Tibetan Part 1 : BrdaRten"] ''BabelStone,'' September 14, 2006</ref>
