'''Boogie Down Productions''' was a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group that was originally composed of [[KRS-One]], [[D-Nice]], and DJ [[Scott La Rock]]. DJ Scott La Rock was murdered on August 27, 1987, months after the release of BDP's debut album, ''Criminal Minded''. The name of the group, Boogie Down, derives from a nickname for the [[South Bronx]] section of [[The Bronx]], one of the five boroughs of [[New York City]]. The group pioneered the fusion of [[dancehall]] reggae and [[hip hop music]] and their debut LP ''Criminal Minded'' contained frank descriptions of life in the South Bronx of the late 1980s thus setting the stage for what would eventually become [[gangsta rap]].

==History== 
The origins of hip-hop are believed to be from [[the Bronx]], rival [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] group [[Juice Crew]]'s lyrics were misunderstood to contain a claim in the song "The Bridge" that hip hop was directly a result of artists originating from [[Queensbridge, Queens|Queensbridge]]. Boogie Down and KRS retorted angrily with songs like ''The Bridge is Over'' and ''South Bronx,'' which started one of the first notable hip hop wars as [[MC Shan]], [[Marley Marl]], [[Roxanne Shanté]] and [[Blaq Poet]] all released songs featuring verses personally attacking KRS and Scott La Rock. The Bridge Wars, however, were only short-lived and after the death of Scott La Rock prior to the group's second album, KRS began to concentrate on consciously focused music. 

While ''Criminal Minded'' contained vivid descriptions of South Bronx street life, BDP changed after Scott's death. Producer Lee Smith was dropped and KRS-One adopted the Teacha moniker and made a deliberate attempt at creating politically and socially conscious Hip-Hop. BDP were hugely influential in provoking political and social consciousness in Hip-Hop however they were sometimes overshadowed by the political hip hop group [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]].

The Jamaican influence present in ''Criminal Minded'' is well illustrated by the use of the "Mad Mad" or "Diseases" [[riddim]] started in 1981 with reggae star [[Yellowman|Yellowman's]] song "Zunguzung." BDP used this riff in the song "Remix for P is Free,"<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoJeThDfdzk YouTube: Remix For P Is Free—Boogie Down Productions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and it was later resampled by artists such as [[Black Star (group)|Black Star]] and [[dead prez]]. As an album regarded by many as the start of the [[gangsta rap]] movement, ''Criminal Minded'' played an important role in reaffirming the social acceptance of having Jamaican roots. BDP referenced reggae in a way that helped to solidify Jamaica's place in modern hip-hop culture.<ref>Marshall, Wayne.

The group was on the verge of signing with [[Warner Bros. Records]] at the time of La Rock's murder. KRS-One ultimately signed with [[Jive Records]].

==BDP Crew==
The membership of BDP changed continuously throughout its existence, the only constant being [[KRS-One]]. BDP members and collaborators included Lee Smith, [[Scott La Rock]], [[D-Nice]], Kenny Parker, [[Mad Lion]], DJ Premier, [[Channel Live]], McBoo, [[Ms. Melodie]], [[Heather B.]], Scottie Morris, Tony Rahsan, Willie D., RoboCop, Harmony, [[DJ Red Alert]], Jay Kramer, D-Square, Rebekah Foster, Scott Whitehill, Scott King, Chris Tait and Sidney Mills. BDP as a group essentially ended because KRS-One began recording and performing under his own name rather than the group name.

Original member Lee Smith, who has co-producer credit on the original 12” "South Bronx" single, was the last to be inexplicably jettisoned by KRS-One and the future new label after Scott’s death.

In the liner notes on BDP's 1992 album ''Sex and Violence'', KRS-One writes: "BDP in 1992 is KRS-One, Willie D, and Kenny Parker! BDP is not D-Nice, Jamal-ski, Harmony, Ms. Melodie, and Scottie Morris. They are not down with BDP so stop frontin'." Steve "Flash" Juon of RapReviews.com claimed that this initiated the ultimate breakup of the group.<ref>Juon, Steve.
