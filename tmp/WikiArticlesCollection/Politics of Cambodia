{{Politics of Cambodia}}
The '''politics of Cambodia''' takes place in a framework of a [[constitutional monarchy]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of Cambodia|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]] and a [[monarchy|Monarch]] is [[head of state]]. The kingdom formally operates according to the nation's [[constitution]] (enacted in 1993) in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the two chambers of parliament, the [[National Assembly of Cambodia|National Assembly]] and the [[Senate of Cambodia|Senate]].

The [[Prime Minister of Cambodia]] is a representative from the ruling party of the National Assembly. He or she is appointed by the King on the recommendation of the President and Vice Presidents of the National Assembly.  In order for a person to become Prime Minister, he or she must first be given a vote of confidence by the National Assembly.

The Prime Minister is officially the [[Head of Government]] in Cambodia. Upon entry into office, he or she appoints a Council of Ministers who are responsible to the Prime Minister.  Officially, the Prime Minister's duties include chairing meetings of the Council of Ministers (Cambodia's version of a [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]) and appointing and leading a government. The Prime Minister and his government make up Cambodia's [[executive (government)|executive branch]] of government.

The current Prime Minister is [[Cambodian People's Party]] (CPP) member [[Hun Sen]]. He has held this position since the criticized 1998 election, one year after the CPP staged a bloody [[coup d'état|coup]] in Phnom Penh<ref>http://cambodia.ohchr.org/Documents/Statements%20and%20Speeches/English/40.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.hri.org/docs/statedep/1997/97-07-08.std.html</ref> to overthrow elected Prime Minister Prince [[Norodom Ranariddh]], president of the [[FUNCINPEC]] party. Hun Sen, has vowed to rule until he is 74. Hun Sen is a former Khmer Rouge member who defected and oversaw Cambodia's rise from the ashes of war, his government is regularly accused of ignoring human rights and suppressing political dissent. After the 2013 election results, disputed by Hun Sens opposition, demonstrators were injured and killed in Cambodia in protests in the capital where a reported 20,000 protesters gathered some clashing with riot police.<ref>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/cambodia-protest-clashes/814406.html Retrieved September-16-2013</ref>From a humble farming background, Hun Sen was just 33 when he took power in 1985, and is now in the unenviable company of enduring [[dictator]]s such as Zimbabwe's [[Robert Mugabe]] and Kazakhstan's [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]]'.<ref>http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/18/us-cambodia-hunsen-analysis-idUSBRE98H04K20130918 Retrieved September-19-2013</ref>

==Legislative branch==
The [[legislature|legislative branch]] of the Cambodian government is made up of a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]].
[[File:5th Cambodian National Assembly composition, 2013.svg|right|thumb|200px|Structure of the 5th legislature (2013-2018) of the National Assembly.]]
*The '''[[National Assembly of Cambodia|National Assembly]]''' (''Radhsaphea'') has 123 members, elected for a five-year term by [[proportional representation]].
*The '''[[Senate of Cambodia|Senate]]''' (''Protsaphea'') has 61 members.  Two of these members are appointed by the King, two are elected by the lower house of the government, and the remaining fifty-seven are elected popularly by "functional constituencies."  Members in this house serve a six-year term.

The official duty of the Parliament is to legislate and make laws.  Bills passed by the Parliament are given to the King who gives the proposed bills [[Royal Assent]].  The King does not have [[veto]] power over bills passed by the National Assembly and thus, cannot withhold Royal Assent.  The National Assembly also has the power to dismiss the Prime Minister and his government by a two-thirds [[vote of no confidence]].

===Senate===

The upper house of the Cambodian legislature is called the ''Senate''. It consists of sixty-one members.  Two of these members are appointed by the King, two are elected by the lower house of the government, and the remaining fifty-seven are elected popularly by electors from provincial and local governments, in a similar fashion to the [[Senate of France]]. Members in this house serve six-year terms.

Prior to 2006, elections had last been held for the Senate in 1999. New elections were supposed to have occurred in 2004, but these elections were initially postponed. On January 22, 2006, 11,352 possible voters went to the poll and chose their candidates. This election was criticized by local monitoring non-governmental organizations as being undemocratic [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4638406.stm].

{{As of|2006}}, the [[Cambodian People's Party]] holds forty-three seats in the Senate, constituting a significant majority. The two other major parties holding seats in the Senate are the [[Funcinpec]] party (holding twelve seats) and the [[Sam Rainsy Party]] (holding two seats).

===National Assembly===

The lower house of the legislature is called the ''National Assembly''.  It is made up of 123 members, elected by popular vote to serve a five-year term.  Elections were last held for the National Assembly in July 2008.

In order to vote in legislative elections, one must be at least eighteen years of age. However, in order to be elected to the Legislature, one must be at least twenty-five years of age.

The National Assembly is led by a President and two Vice Presidents who are selected by Assembly members prior to each session.

{{As of|2009}}, the [[Cambodian People's Party]] holds a majority of the seats in the National Assembly, controlling 90 out of the 123 seats. The [[Sam Rainsy Party]] holds 26 seats and other parties hold the other 7 seats.

*In addition to the general election, the [[King of Cambodia|King]] and [[National Assembly of Cambodia|National Assembly]] each choose two Senators, bringing the total to 61 members.

==Judicial branch==

The [[judiciary|judicial branch]] is independent from the rest of the government, as specified by the Cambodian [[Constitution]]. The highest court of judicial branch is the [[Supreme Council of the Magistracy]]. Other, lower courts also exist. Until 1997, Cambodia did not have a judicial branch of government despite the nation's Constitution requiring one.

The main duties of the judiciary are to prosecute criminals, settle lawsuits, and, most importantly, protect the freedoms and rights of Cambodian citizens. However, in reality, the judicial branch in Cambodia is highly corrupt and often serves as a tool of the executive branch to silence civil society and its leaders [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/cambod12269.htm]. There are currently 17 justices on the Supreme Council.

==Monarchy==
[[File:Norodom king of Cambodia.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[King]] [[Norodom Sihamoni]]]]
Cambodia is a [[constitutional monarchy]], i.e. the King reigns but does not rule, in similar fashion to Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]]. The King is officially the [[Head of State]] and is the symbol of unity and "eternity" of the nation, as defined by Cambodia's constitution.

From September 24, 1993 through October 7, 2004, [[Norodom Sihanouk]] reigned as King, after having previously served in a number of offices (including King) since 1941. Under the Constitution, the King has no political power, but as Norodom Sihanouk was revered in the country, his word often carried much influence in the government. For example, in February 2004, he issued a proclamation stating that since Cambodia is a "liberal democracy," the Kingdom ought to allow [[gay marriage]].  While such views aren't prevalent in Cambodia, his word was respected by his subjects. The King, often irritated over the conflicts in his government, several times threatened to abdicate unless the political factions in the government got along. This put pressure on the government to solve their differences.  This influence of the King was often used to help mediate differences in government.

After the abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk in 2004, he was succeeded by his son [[Norodom Sihamoni]]. While the retired King was highly revered in his country for dedicating his lifetime to Cambodia, the current King has spent most of his life abroad in [[France]]. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the new King's views will be as highly respected as his father's.

Although in the [[Khmer language]] there are many words meaning "king", the word officially used in Khmer (as found in the 1993 Cambodian Constitution) is ''preahmâhaksat'' (Khmer regular script:[[Image:Seihamuni11.png|80px]]), which literally means: ''preah''- ("sacred", cognate of the Indian word [[Brahmin]]) -''mâha''- (from [[Sanskrit]], meaning "great", cognate with "maha-" in [[maharaja]]) -''ksat'' ("warrior, ruler", cognate of the Indian word [[Kshatriya]]).

On the occasion of HM King Norodom Sihanouk's retirement in September 2004, the Cambodian National Assembly coined a new word for the retired king: ''preahmâhaviraksat'' (Khmer regular script:[[Image:Sihanouk6.png|90px]]), where ''vira'' comes from Sanskrit ''vīra'', meaning "brave or eminent man, hero, chief", cognate of [[Latin]] ''vir'', ''viris'', [[English language|English]] ''virile''. ''Preahmâhaviraksat'' is translated in English as "King-Father" ({{lang-fr|Roi-Père}}), although the word "father" does not appear in the Khmer noun.

As ''preahmâhaviraksat'', Norodom Sihanouk retained many of the prerogatives he formerly held as ''preahmâhaksat'' and was a highly respected and listened-to figure. Thus, in effect, Cambodia could be described as a country with two Kings during Sihanouk's lifetime: the one who was the Head of State, the ''preahmâhaksat'' Norodom Sihamoni, and the one who was not the Head of State, the ''preahmâhaviraksat'' Norodom Sihanouk.

Sihanouk died of a pulmonary infarction on October 15, 2012.

===Succession to the throne===
Unlike most monarchies, Cambodia's monarchy is not necessarily [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary]] and the King is not allowed to select his own heir.  Instead, a new King is chosen by a Royal Council of the Throne, consisting of the president of the National Assembly, the Prime Minister, the Chiefs of the orders of [[Buddhism in Cambodia#Cambodian adaptations|Mohanikay and Thammayut]], and the First and Second Vice-President of the Assembly.  The Royal Council meets within a week of the King's death or abdication and selects a new King from a pool of candidates with royal blood.

It has been suggested that Cambodia's ability to peacefully appoint a new King shows that Cambodia's government has stabilized incredibly from the situation the country was in during the 1970s (see [[History of Cambodia]]).

The administrations are a part of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Cambodia)|Ministry of the Interior]] and their members are appointed by the central government.<ref name=wb/> Provincial and municipal administrations participate in the creation of nation budget; they also issue land titles and license businesses.<ref name=wb/>  

Since 2002, commune-level governments ([[commune council]]s) have been composed of members directly elected by commune residents every five years.<ref>[http://www.embassyofcambodia.org.nz/March2007/March2007-3.htm Untitled Document<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In practice, the allocation of responsibilities between various levels of government is uncertain.<ref name=wb/>  This uncertainty has created additional opportunities for corruption and increased costs for investors.<ref name=wb/>
