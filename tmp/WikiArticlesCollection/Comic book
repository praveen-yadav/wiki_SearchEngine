A '''comic book''' or '''comicbook''',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.eagleawards.co.uk/category/previous-winners/ | title=Previous Winners | work=The [[Eagle Awards]] | accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref> also called '''comic magazine''' or simply '''comic''', is a publication, first popularized in the [[United States]], of [[comics]] art in the form of sequential juxtaposed [[panel (comics)|panels]] that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in [[word balloon]]s emblematic of the comics art form. The first comic book appeared in the United States in 1933{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper [[comic strip]]s which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term ''comic book'' arose because the first book sold as a comic book reprinted humor comic strips.<ref>http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/033comic.html</ref> Despite their name, comic books are not necessarily humorous in tone, and feature stories in all genres.

Since the introduction of the comic book format in 1933 with the publication of ''[[Famous Funnies]]'', the United States has produced the most titles, along with [[British comic]]s and Japanese [[manga]], in terms of quantity of titles.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Cultural historians divide the career of the comic book in the U.S. into several ages or [[List of time periods|historical eras]]:{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Comic book historians continue to debate the exact boundaries of these eras, but they have come to an agreement, the terms for which originated in the [[fandom|fan]] [[publishing|press]]. Comics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of ''[[Histoire de M. Vieux Bois|The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck]]'' in 1842 in hardcover, making it the first known American prototype comic book. The introduction of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s [[Superman]] in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry,<ref>{{cite book | last=Goulart | first=Ron | authorlink=Ron Goulart | title=Comic Book Culture: An Illustrated History | date=—1 June 2000 | publisher=Collectors Press | page=43 | isbn=978-1-888054-38-5}}</ref> and is the start of the Golden Age of comics. Historians have proposed several names for the Age before Superman, most commonly dubbing it the Platinum Age.<ref name="HoCB-Platinum">{{cite web | last = Coville | first = Jamie | url = http://www.thecomicbooks.com/old/Platinum.html | title = The History of Comic Books: Introduction and "The Platinum Age 1897–1938" | publisher = TheComicBooks.com, n.d.}} [http://web.archive.org/web/20030415153354/www.collectortimes.com/~comichistory/Platinum.html Archive of original page] published at defunct site [http://www.collectortimes.com CollectorTimes.com]</ref>

During that time, the G. W. Dillingham Company published the first known proto-comic-book magazine in the U.S., ''The Yellow Kid in McFadden's Flats'', in 1897. It reprinted material &ndash; primarily the October 18, 1896 to January 10, 1897 sequence titled "McFadden's Row of Flats" &ndash; from [[cartoonist]] [[Richard F. Outcault]]'s [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]] ''[[Hogan's Alley (comic strip)|Hogan's Alley]]'', starring the [[Yellow Kid]], the lead character.  The 196-page, square-bound, black-and-white publication, which also includes introductory text by [[E. W. Townsend]], measured 5×7 inches and sold for 50 cents. The neologism "comic book" appears on the back cover. Despite the publication of a series of related Hearst comics soon afterward,<ref name="HoCB-Platinum" /> the first monthly comic book, Embee Distributing Company's ''Comic Monthly'', did not appear until 1922. Produced in an 8½-by-9-inch format, it reprinted black-and-white newspaper comic strips and lasted a year.<ref name="HoCB-Platinum" /><ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/35704/ ''Comic Monthly''] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>

It was not until the Golden Age that the [[archetype]] of the superhero would originate.

The Silver Age of comic books is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the dormant superhero form—the debut of [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[Carmine Infantino]]'s [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]''  #4 (Oct. 1956).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=10649 | title=DC Flashback: The Flash | accessdate=27 June 2008 | last=CBR News Team | date=2 July 2007 | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706  | title=Breaking the Border – Rants and Ramblings | accessdate=5 January 2010 | last=Zicari | first=Anthony | date=3 August 2007 | publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070826092448/http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706 |archivedate = 26 August 2007}}</ref> The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time [[Marvel Comics]] revolutionized the medium with such [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] superheroes as [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Fantastic Four]] and Stan Lee and [[Steve Ditko]]'s [[Spider-Man]].

The precise beginnings of the Bronze and Copper Ages remain less well-defined. Suggested starting points for the Bronze Age of comics include [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]]'' No. 1 (October 1970), [[Denny O'Neil]] and [[Neal Adams]]' ''[[Green Lantern]]/[[Green Arrow]]'' No. 76 (April 1970), or Stan Lee and [[Gil Kane]]'s ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' No. 96 (May 1971; the non-[[Comics Code]] issue). 
The start of the Copper Age (apprx. 1984–2000) has even more potential starting points, but is generally agreed to be the publication of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[Watchmen]]'' by [[DC Comics]] in 1986, as well as the publication of DC's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', written by [[Marv Wolfman]] with pencils by [[George Pérez]].

A notable event in the history of the American comic book came with the psychiatrist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s criticisms of the medium in his book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' (1954), which prompted the American [[Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency]] to investigate comic books. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the U.S. comic book industry set up the [[Comics Code Authority]] in 1954 and drafted the "Comics Code" in the same year.

===   Underground comic books   ===
{{Main|Underground comix}}

In the early 1970s a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as [[Underground comix|underground comics]]. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth [[counterculture]] and [[drug culture]] of the time. Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure "[[Tijuana bibles]]". Underground comics were almost never sold at news stands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as [[head shops]] and record stores, as well as by [[mail order]].

[[Frank Stack]]'s ''The Adventures of Jesus'', published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon,<ref name="Shelton">{{Cite book | last1=Stack | first1=Frank | authorlink1=Frank Stack | last2=Shelton | first2=Gilbert | authorlink2=Gilbert Shelton | title=The New Adventures of Jesus | date=25 December 2006 | publisher=[[Fantagraphics Books]] | page=9 | chapter=Introduction | isbn=978-1-56097-780-3}}</ref><ref name="Skinn-34"/> has been credited as the first underground comic.<ref name="Shelton"/><ref name="Skinn-34">{{Cite book | last=Skinn | first=Dez | authorlink=Dez Skinn | title=Comix: The Underground Revolution | date=20 May 2004 | publisher=[[Thunder's Mouth Press]] | page=34 | chapter=Heroes of the Revolution | isbn=978-1-56025-572-7}}</ref>

===Alternative comics===
{{Main|Alternative comics}}

The rise of comic book [[specialty store]]s in the late 1970s created/paralleled a dedicated market for "independent" or "[[alternative comics]]" in the U.S. The first such comics included the anthology series ''[[Star Reach]]'', published by comic-book writer [[Mike Friedrich]] from 1974 to 1979, and [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]'', which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which [[Shari Springer Berman]] and [[Robert Pulcini]] adapted into a [[American Splendor (film)|2003 film]]. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics, though their content generally remained less explicit; others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].

During the 1970s the "[[small press]]" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers - such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] - had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats—from color-superhero, [[detective]], and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].

A number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The "[[minicomic]]s" form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.

Small publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], Raytoons, and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].

===Graphic novels===
{{Main|Graphic novel}}
In 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term "graphic novel" to distinguish newly translated European works from genre-driven subject matter common in American comics. Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition by Belgian [[Frans Masereel]],<ref>Sabin, Roger. ''Adult Comics: An Introduction''(Routledge New Accents Library Collection, 2005), p. 291 ISBN 978-0-415-29139-2, ISBN 978-0-415-29139-2</ref> American [[Lynd Ward]] and others. 
In 1950, [[St. John Publications]] produced the [[digest-sized]], adult-oriented "picture novel" ''[[It Rhymes with Lust]]'', a 128-page digest by [[pseudonym]]ous writer "Drake Waller" ([[Arnold Drake]] and [[Leslie Waller]]), penciler [[Matt Baker (artist)|Matt Baker]] and inker [[Ray Osrin]], touted as "an original full-length novel" on its cover. In 1971, writer-artist [[Gil Kane]] and collaborators devised the paperback "comics novel" ''[[Blackmark]]''. [[Will Eisner]] popularized the term "graphic novel" when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work ''[[A Contract with God|A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories]]'' in 1978.

===Franco-Belgian comics===

{{Main|Franco-Belgian comics}}
[[File:René Goscinny.jpg||thumb|right|200px|[[René Goscinny]] (1926 – 1977), writer of the ''[[Astérix]]'' comic book series.]] 
France and [[Belgium]] have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called ''[[Franco-Belgian comics|BDs]]'' (an abbreviation of ''bande dessinées'') in French and ''strips'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone "Franco-Belgian" comics, but have their own distinct style.

The name ''la bande dessinée'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as "the drawn strip"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word "bande" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms "comics" and "funnies", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvième art'' (literally, "the ninth art") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.

In France, authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.

===British comics===
{{Main|British comics}}

[[File:2000AD168.jpg|thumb| [[Judge Dredd]] is a British-American-made comic about "Dredd" who is an American law enforcement officer in a violent city of the future where uniformed Judges combine the powers of police, judge, jury and executioner.]]
Originally the same size as a usual comic book in the U.S. (although lacking the glossy cover), the British comic has adopted a magazine size, with ''[[The Beano]]'' and ''[[The Dandy]]'' the last to adopt this size (in the 1980s). Although the British generally speak of "a comic" or of "a comic magazine", and they also historically spoke of "a comic paper".{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Some comics, such as ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' and other ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' titles, have been published in a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] form.

Although ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]'' (1884), the first comic published in Britain, was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger market, which has led to most publications being for children and created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile.

Popular titles within the UK have included ''The Beano'', ''The Dandy'', ''[[Eagle (comic)|The Eagle]]'', ''2000 AD'', and ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]''. Underground comics and "[[British small press comics|small press]]" titles have also been published within the UK, notably ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' and ''[[Escape Magazine]]''.

The content of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the U.S., such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long.

The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the U.S. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies were involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe & Porter.

Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and [[Dark Horse Comics]] also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[Asterix]]'' serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books.

At Christmas time, publishers repackage and commission material for comic [[Annual publication|annuals]], printed and bound as hardcover [[ISO_216#A series|A4]]-size books; [[Rupert Bear|Rupert]] supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. [[DC Thomson]] also repackages ''[[The Broons]]'' and ''[[Oor Wullie]]'' strips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.

On 19 March 2012, the British postal service, the [[Royal Mail]], released a set of stamps depicting British comic-book characters and series.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17421394 |title=Beano's Dennis the Menace on Royal Mail comic stamps |publisher=BBC News |date= 19 March 2012|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> The collection featured [[The Beano]], [[The Dandy]], [[Eagle (comics)|Eagle]], [[The Topper (comics)|The Topper]], [[Roy of the Rovers (comic)|Roy of the Rovers]], [[Bunty]], [[Buster (comics)|Buster]], [[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]], [[Twinkle (comics)|Twinkle]] and [[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]].

[[File:Hugo Pratt (1989) by Erling Mandelmann - 2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Hugo Pratt]] (1927 – 1995), author of the ''[[Corto Maltese]]'' comic book series.]]
In [[Italy]], comics (known in Italian as ''fumetti'') made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like [[Hugo Pratt]] and [[Guido Crepax]] exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as ''[[Diabolik]]'' or the ''[[Sergio Bonelli Editore|Bonelli]]'' line—namely ''[[Tex Willer]]'' or ''[[Dylan Dog]]''—remain best-sellers.

Mainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white [[digest size]] format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's ''[[Corto Maltese]]''.

Italian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and [[Argentina]]. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of [[Walt Disney]] comic stories outside the U.S. [[Donald Duck]]'s superhero alter ego, [[Paperinik]], known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.

==Japanese comics (manga)==
{{bad summary|sdate=September 2011}}
{{Main|Manga}}

The first comic books in Japan appeared during the 18th century in the form of woodblock-printed booklets containing short stories drawn from folk tales, legends, and historical accounts, told in a simple visual-verbal idiom. Known as {{Nihongo|"red books"|赤本|akahon}}, {{Nihongo|"black books"|黒本|kurobon}}, and {{Nihongo|"blue books"|青本|aohon}}, these were written primarily for less literate readers. However, with the publication in 1775 of Koikawa Harumachi's comic book {{Nihongo|''Master Flashgold's Splendiferous Dream''|金々先生栄花の夢|Kinkin sensei eiga no yume}}, an adult form of comic book originated, which required greater literacy and cultural sophistication. This was known as the {{nihongo3|lit. ''yellow cover''|黄表紙|[[kibyōshi]]}}. Published in thousands of copies, the ''kibyōshi'' may have been the earliest fully realized comic book for adults in world literary history. Approximately 2,000 titles remain [[Extant literature|extant]].

Modern comic books in Japan developed from a mixture of these earlier comic books and of woodblock prints {{Nihongo|''[[ukiyo-e]]''|浮世絵|}} with Western styles of drawing. They took their current form shortly after World War II. They are usually published in black-and-white, except for the covers, which are usually printed in four colors, although occasionally, the first few pages may also be printed in full color. The term ''manga'' means "random (or whimsical) pictures", and first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as [[Santō Kyōden]]'s picturebook {{Nihongo|''Shiji no yukikai''|四時交加|}} (1798) and Aikawa Minwa's ''Comic Sketches of a Hundred Women'' (1798). During the [[Meiji period]], the term ''[[Akahon]]'' was also common.

Western artists were brought over to teach their students such concepts as line, form, and color; things which had not been regarded as conceptually important in ''ukiyo-e'', as the idea behind the picture was of paramount importance. Manga at this time was referred to as ''Ponchi-e'' (Punch-picture) and, like its British counterpart ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, mainly depicted humor and political satire in short one- or [[Yonkoma|four-picture format]].

Dr. [[Osamu Tezuka]] (1928–1989) further developed this form. Seeing an animated war propaganda film titled {{Nihongo|''[[Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors]]''|桃太郎 海の神兵|''Momotarō Umi no Shinpei''}} inspired Tezuka to become a comic artist. He introduced episodic storytelling and character development in comic format, in which each story is part of larger story arc. The only text in Tezuka's comics was the characters' dialogue and this further lent his comics a cinematic quality. Inspired by the work of Walt Disney, Tezuka also adopted a style of drawing facial features in which a character's [[human eye|eye]]s, [[human nose|nose]], and mouth are drawn in an extremely exaggerated manner. This style created immediately recognizable expressions using very few lines, and the simplicity of this style allowed Tezuka to be prolific. Tezuka's work generated new interest in the ''ukiyo-e'' tradition, in which the image is a representation of an idea, rather than a depiction of reality.

Though a close equivalent to the American comic book, manga has historically held a more important place in Japanese culture than comics have in American culture. Japanese society shows a wide respect for manga, both as an art form and as a form of popular literature. Many manga become television shows or short films. As with its American counterpart, some manga has been criticized for its sexuality and violence, although in the absence of official or even industry restrictions on content, artists have freely created manga for every age group and for every topic.

Manga magazines—also known as "anthologies"—often run several series concurrently, with approximately 20 to 40 pages allocated to each series per issue. These magazines range from 200 to more than 850 pages each. Manga magazines also contain [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comics and a variety of four-panel yonkoma (equivalent to comic strips). Manga series may continue for [[List of manga series by volume count|many years]] if they are successful, with stories often collected and reprinted in book-sized volumes called {{nihongo3|lit. ''stand-alone book''|単行本|[[tankōbon]]}}, the equivalent of the American [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]]. These volumes use higher-quality paper and are useful to readers who want to be brought up to date with a series, or to readers who find the cost of the weekly or monthly publications to be prohibitive. Deluxe versions are printed as commemorative or collectible editions. Conversely, old manga titles are also reprinted using lower-quality paper and sold for 120 [[yen|¥]] (approximately $1 [[US$|USD]]) each.

===Doujinshi===
{{Main|Doujinshi}}

{{nihongo3|lit. ''fan magazine''|同人誌|Doujinshi}}, [[fan-made]] Japanese comics operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American "underground comics" market; the largest doujinshi fair, [[Comiket]], attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.

==Distribution==
Distribution has historically been a problem for the comic book industry with many mainstream retailers declining to carry extensive stocks of the most interesting and popular comics. The [[smart phone]] and the [[tablet computer]], however, have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.<ref name=NYT72113>{{cite news|title=Embracing Tablets, Comic Book Publishers Cash In on a Digital Revolution|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/media/comic-books-cash-in-on-a-digital-revolution.html|accessdate=July 24, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 21, 2013|author=Gregory Schmidt}}</ref> 

===Digital distribution===
[[Marvel Comics]] launched [[Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited]], a subscription service allowing readers to read many comics from Marvel's history online, on November 13, 2007. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of ''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16781/avenging_spider-man_1_makes_digital_history|title=Avenging Spider-Man #1 Makes Digital History|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref>

With growing the popularity of smart phones and tablet computers, particularly [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]], many major publishers have begun releasing titles in digital form. Some of the most popular platforms for such release are [[Graphicly]] and [[comiXology]].
