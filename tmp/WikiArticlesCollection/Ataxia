'''Ataxia''' (from [[Greek (language)|Greek]] ''α-'' [a negative prefix] + ''-τάξις'' [order] = "lack of order"), is a [[neurological sign]] consisting of lack of voluntary [[Motor coordination|coordination of muscle movements]].  Ataxia is a non-specific clinical manifestation implying dysfunction of the parts of the [[nervous system]] that coordinate movement, such as the [[cerebellum]]. Several possible causes exist for these patterns of neurological dysfunction. The term "dystaxia" is a rarely used synonym.

==Types==

===Cerebellar===
The term [[cerebellar ataxia]] is used to indicate ataxia that is due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is responsible for integrating a significant amount of neural information that is used to coordinate smoothly ongoing movements and to participate in motor planning. Although ataxia is not present with all cerebellar lesions, many conditions affecting the [[cerebellum]] do produce ataxia.<ref name="Schmahmann">{{cite journal | author = Schmahmann JD | title = Disorders of the cerebellum: ataxia, dysmetria of thought, and the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–78 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15377747 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.16.3.367 }}</ref>  People with cerebellar ataxia may have trouble regulating the force, range, direction, velocity and rhythm of muscle contractions.<ref name="isbn0-8036-0093-3">{{cite book | author = Fredericks CM | chapter = Disorders of the Cerebellum and Its Connections | editor = Saladin LK, Fredericks CM | title = Pathophysiology of the motor systems: principles and clinical presentations | publisher = F.A.

People with cerebellar ataxia may initially present with poor balance, which could be demonstrated as an inability to stand on one leg or perform [[tandem gait]]. As the condition progresses, walking is characterized by a widened base and high stepping, as well as staggering and lurching from side to side.<ref name ="Schmahmann" /> Turning is also problematic and could result in falls. As cerebellar ataxia becomes severe, great assistance and effort are needed in order to stand and walk.<ref name ="Schmahmann" /> [[Dysarthria]], an impairment with articulation, may also be present and is characterized by "scanning" speech that consists of slower rate, irregular rhythm and variable volume.<ref name ="Schmahmann" /> There may also be slurring of speech, tremor of the voice and [[ataxic respiration]]. Cerebellar ataxia could result with incoordination of movement, particularly in the extremities. There is overshooting with finger to nose testing, and heel to shin testing; thus, [[dysmetria]] is evident.<ref name ="Schmahmann" /> Impairments with alternating movements ([[dysdiadochokinesia]]),  as well as [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]], may also be displayed. There may also be tremor of the head and trunk ([[titubation]]) in individuals with cerebellar ataxia.<ref name ="Schmahmann" />

It is thought that [[dysmetria]] is caused by a deficit in the control of interaction [[torque]]s in multijoint motion.<ref name="pmid10805697">{{cite journal | author = Bastian AJ, Zackowski KM, Thach WT | title = Cerebellar ataxia: torque deficiency or torque mismatch between joints? | journal = J. Neurophysiol. | volume = 83 | issue = 5 | pages = 3019–30 | year = 2000 | month = May | pmid = 10805697 | doi = }}</ref> Interaction torques are created at an associated joint when the primary joint is moved. For example, if a movement required reaching to touch a target in front of the body, [[flexion]] at the [[shoulder]] would create a torque at the [[elbow]], while [[extension (kinesiology)|extension]] of the elbow would create a torque at the [[wrist]]. These torques increase as the speed of movement increases and must be compensated and adjusted for to create coordinated movement. This may, therefore, explain decreased coordination at higher movement [[velocity|velocities]] and [[acceleration]]s.

* '''[[Vestibulocerebellar syndrome|Dysfunction of the vestibulocerebellum]]''' ([[flocculonodular lobe]]) impairs the balance and the control of eye movements. This presents itself with [[postural instability]], in which the person tends to separate his/her feet upon standing, in order to gain a wider base and to avoid [[titubation]] (bodily oscillations tending to be forward-backward ones). The instability is therefore worsened when standing with the feet together, regardless of whether the eyes are open or closed. This is a negative [[Romberg's test]], or more accurately, it denotes the individual's inability to carry out the test, because the individual feels unstable even with open eyes. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* '''Dysfunction of the [[Anatomy of the cerebellum#Phylogenetic and functional divisions|spinocerebellum]]'''  ([[vermis]] and associated areas near the midline) presents itself with a wide-based "drunken sailor" [[gait]] (called truncal ataxia),<ref name="Blumenfeld">{{cite book | author = Blumenfeld H | title = Neuroanatomy through clinical cases | publisher = Sinauer | location = Sunderland, Mass | year = 2002 | pages = 670–671 | isbn = 0-87893-060-4 }}</ref> characterised by uncertain starts and stops, lateral deviations, and unequal steps. As a result of this gait impairment, [[falling (accident)|falling]] is a concern in patients with ataxia. Studies examining falls in this population show that 74-93% of patients have fallen at least once in the past year and up to 60% admit to fear of falling.<ref name="pmid20157791">{{cite journal | author = Fonteyn EM, Schmitz-Hübsch T, Verstappen CC, Baliko L, Bloem BR, Boesch S, Bunn L, Charles P, Dürr A, Filla A, Giunti P, Globas C, Klockgether T, Melegh B, Pandolfo M, De Rosa A, Schöls L, Timmann D, Munneke M, Kremer BP, van de Warrenburg BP | title = Falls in spinocerebellar ataxias: Results of the EuroSCA Fall Study | journal = Cerebellum | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 232–9 | year = 2010 | month = June | pmid = 20157791 | doi = 10.1007/s12311-010-0155-z }}</ref><ref name="pmid15645525">{{cite journal | author = van de Warrenburg BP, Steijns JA, Munneke M, Kremer BP, Bloem BR | title = Falls in degenerative cerebellar ataxias | journal = Mov.

* '''Dysfunction of the [[Anatomy of the cerebellum#Phylogenetic and functional divisions|cerebrocerebellum]]''' (lateral hemispheres) presents as disturbances in carrying out voluntary, planned movements by the extremities (called appendicular ataxia).<ref name=Blumenfeld/> These include:
**[[intention tremor]] (coarse trembling, accentuated over the execution of voluntary movements, possibly involving the head and eyes as well as the limbs and torso);
**peculiar writing abnormalities (large, unequal letters, irregular underlining);
**a peculiar pattern of [[dysarthria]] (slurred speech, sometimes characterised by explosive variations in voice intensity despite a regular rhythm).
**inability to perform rapidly alternating movements, known as [[dysdiadochokinesia]]. This could involve rapidly switching from [[pronation]] to [[supination]] of the forearm. Movements become more irregular with increases of speed.<ref name=Schmitz>{{cite book | chapter = Examination of Coordination | author = Schmitz TJ, O'Sullivan SB | title = Physical rehabilitation | publisher = F.A. Davis | location = Philadelphia | year = 2007 | pages = 193–225 | isbn = 0-8036-1247-8  }}</ref>
**inability to judge distances or ranges of movement. This is known as [[dysmetria]] and is often seen as undershooting, [[hypometria]], or overshooting, [[hypermetria]], the required distance or range to reach a target. This is sometimes seen when a patient is asked to reach out and touch someone's finger or touch his or her own nose.<ref name=Schmitz />
**the rebound phenomenon, also known as the loss of the check reflex is also sometimes seen in patients with cerebellar ataxia. For example, when a patient is flexing his or her elbow isometrically against a resistance. When the resistance is suddenly removed without warning, the patient's arm may swing up and even strike themselves. With an intact check reflex, the patient will check and activate the opposing triceps to slow and stop the movement.<ref name=Schmitz />

===Sensory===
The term [[sensory ataxia]] is employed to indicate ataxia due to loss of [[proprioception]], the loss of sensitivity to the positions of joint and body parts. This is generally caused by dysfunction of the [[dorsal columns]] of the spinal cord, because they carry proprioceptive information up to the brain. In some cases, the cause of sensory ataxia may instead be dysfunction of the various parts of the brain which receive positional information, including the cerebellum, [[thalamus]], and [[parietal lobe]]s.

Sensory ataxia presents itself with an unsteady "stomping" gait with heavy [[heel]] strikes, as well as a postural instability that is usually worsened when the lack of proprioceptive input cannot be compensated for by [[visual perception|visual input]], such as in poorly lit environments.

[[Physician]]s can find evidence of sensory ataxia during [[physical examination]] by having the patient stand with his/her feet together and [[Human eye|eye]]s shut. In affected patients, this will cause the instability to worsen markedly, producing wide oscillations and possibly a fall. This is called a positive [[Romberg's test]]. Worsening of the finger-pointing test with the eyes closed is another feature of sensory ataxia. Also, when the patient is standing with arms and hands extended toward the physician, if the eyes are closed, the patient's finger will tend to "fall down" and then be restored to the horizontal extended position by sudden muscular contractions (the "ataxic hand").

===Vestibular===
The term ''vestibular ataxia'' is employed to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the [[vestibular system]], which in acute and unilateral cases is associated with prominent [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]]. In slow-onset, chronic bilateral cases of vestibular dysfunction, these characteristic manifestations may be absent, and [[dysequilibrium]] may be the sole presentation.

==Causes==
The three types of ataxia have overlapping causes, and therefore can either coexist or occur in isolation.

===Focal lesions===
Any type of focal lesion of the [[central nervous system]] (such as [[stroke]], [[brain tumour]], [[multiple sclerosis]]) will cause the type of ataxia corresponding to the site of the lesion: cerebellar if in the cerebellum, sensory if in the dorsal spinal cord (and rarely in the [[thalamus]] or [[parietal lobe]]), vestibular if in the vestibular system (including the vestibular areas of the [[cerebral cortex]]).

===Exogenous substances===
Exogenous substances that cause ataxia mainly do so because they have a depressant effect on central nervous system function. The most common example is [[ethanol]], which is capable of causing reversible cerebellar and vestibular ataxia. Other examples include various prescription drugs (e.g. most [[antiepileptic drugs]] have cerebellar ataxia as a possible [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effect]]), Lithium level over 1.5mEq/L, [[cannabis]] ingestion<ref name="Inadvertent Ingestion of Marijuana --- Los Angeles, California, 2009">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5834a2.htm?s_cid=mm5834a2 |title= Inadvertent Ingestion of Marijuana --- Los Angeles, California, 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-03 |format= |work=}}</ref> and various other recreational drugs (e.g. [[ketamine]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] or [[dextromethorphan]], all of which are [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]s that produce a dissociative state at high doses). A further class of pharmaceuticals which can cause short term ataxia, especially in high doses are the [[benzodiazepine]]s.<ref name="pmid817697">{{cite journal | author = Browne TR | title = Clonazepam.

===Radiation poisoning===
Ataxia can be induced as a result of severe [[Acute radiation syndrome|acute radiation poisoning]] with an absorbed dose of more than 30 [[Gray (unit)|Grays]].

===Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency===
[[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] [[Vitamin B12 deficiency|deficiency]] may cause, among several neurological abnormalities, overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia.

===Hypothyroidism===
Symptoms of neurological dysfunction may be the presenting feature in some patients with [[hypothyroidism]].  These include reversible [[cerebellar ataxia]], [[dementia]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[psychosis]] and [[coma]]. Most of the neurological complications improve completely after [[thyroid hormone]] replacement therapy.<ref name="isbn0-07-149992-X">{{cite book | author = Victor M, Ropper AH, Adams RD, Samuels M | title = Adams and Victor's Principles of Neurology | edition = Ninth  | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = | year = 2009 | origyear = | pages = 78–88 | isbn = 0-07-149992-X }}</ref><ref name="Pavan_2012">{{cite journal | author = Pavan MR, Deepak M, Basavaprabhu A, Gupta A | year = 2012 | title= Doctor i am swaying – An interesting case of ataxia | journal =  Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research | volume = | issue = | pages = | doi = | url= http://www.jcdr.net/article_fulltext.asp?issn=0973-709x&year=2012&volume=6&issue=4&page=702&issn=0973-709x&id=2120 | accessdate = 2 May 2013}}</ref>

===Causes of isolated sensory ataxia===
[[Peripheral neuropathy|Peripheral neuropathies]] may cause generalised or localised sensory ataxia (e.g. a limb only) depending on the extent of the neuropathic involvement. Spinal disorders of various types may cause sensory ataxia from the lesioned level below, when they involve the dorsal columns<ref>{{cite journal |author=Spinazzi M, Angelini C, Patrini C |title=Subacute sensory ataxia and optic neuropathy with thiamine deficiency |journal=Nature Reviews Neurology  |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=288–93 |year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20308997 |doi=10.1038/nrneurol.2010.16 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sghirlanzoni A, Pareyson D, Lauria G |title=Sensory neuron diseases |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=349–61 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15907739 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70096-X |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Moeller JJ, Macaulay RJ, Valdmanis PN, Weston LE, Rouleau GA, Dupré N |title=Autosomal dominant sensory ataxia: a neuroaxonal dystrophy |journal=Acta Neuropathol. |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=331–6 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18347805 |doi=10.1007/s00401-008-0362-6 |url=}}</ref>

===Non-hereditary cerebellar degeneration===
Non-hereditary causes of cerebellar degeneration include chronic [[ethanol abuse]], [[head injury]], [[paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration]], [[high altitude cerebral oedema]], [[coeliac disease]], [[normal pressure hydrocephalus]] and [[Post viral cerebellar ataxia|cerebellitis]].

===Hereditary ataxias===
Ataxia may depend on [[hereditary]] disorders consisting of degeneration of the cerebellum and/or of the spine; most cases feature both to some extent, and therefore present with overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia, even though one is often more evident than the other. Hereditary disorders causing ataxia include [[autosomal dominant]] ones such as [[spinocerebellar ataxia]], [[episodic ataxia]], and [[dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy]], as well as [[autosomal recessive]] disorders such as [[Friedreich's ataxia]] (sensory and cerebellar, with the former predominating) and [[Niemann Pick disease]], [[ataxia-telangiectasia]] (sensory and cerebellar, with the latter predominating), and [[abetalipoproteinaemia]]. An example of X-linked ataxic condition is the rare [[fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome]].

===Arnold-Chiari malformation===
[[Arnold-Chiari malformation]] is a malformation of the [[Human brain|brain]]. It consists of a downward displacement of the [[cerebellar tonsils]] and the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]] through the [[foramen magnum]], sometimes causing [[hydrocephalus]] as a result of obstruction of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] outflow.

===Wilson's disease===

=== Gluten ataxia ===

Gluten ataxia may be a form of [[gluten sensitivity]], a wide spectrum of disorders marked by an abnormal immunological response to gluten. With gluten ataxia, damage takes place in the cerebellum, the balance center of the brain that controls coordination and complex movements like walking, speaking and swallowing.<ref name="Boyd_2011">{{cite journal | author = Boyd C | title = Gluten Attack: Ataxia A Controversial Call | journal = Living Without | year = 2011 | month = Feb/Mar | url = http://www.livingwithout.com/issues/4_12/ataxia-2366-1.html?pg=2 }}</ref> Gluten ataxia is the single most common cause of sporadic idiopathic ataxia.<ref name="pmid12566288">{{cite journal | author = Hadjivassiliou M, Grünewald R, Sharrack B, Sanders D, Lobo A, Williamson C, Woodroofe N, Wood N, Davies-Jones A | title = Gluten ataxia in perspective: epidemiology, genetic susceptibility and clinical characteristics | journal = Brain | volume = 126 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 685–91 | year = 2003 | month = March | pmid = 12566288 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awg050 }}</ref>

Gluten ataxia is an immune-mediated disease triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all patients with idiopathic sporadic ataxia. Early diagnosis and treatment with a gluten free diet can improve ataxia and prevent its progression. Readily available and sensitive markers of gluten ataxia include anti-[[gliadin]] antibodies. [[Immunoglobulin A]] (IgA) deposits against [[tissue transglutaminase|transglutaminase 2]] (TG2) in the small bowel and at extraintestinal sites are proving to be additional reliable and perhaps more specific markers of the whole spectrum of gluten sensitivity. They may also hold the key to its [[pathogenesis]].<ref name="pmid18787912">{{cite journal | author = Hadjivassiliou M, Sanders DS, Woodroofe N, Williamson C, Grünewald RA | title = Gluten ataxia | journal = Cerebellum | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 494–8 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18787912 | doi = 10.1007/s12311-008-0052-x }}</ref>

Gluten ataxia is defined as sporadic cerebellar ataxia associated with the presence circulating antigliadin antibodies and in the absence of an alternative [[etiology]] for ataxia.<ref name="pmid16476935">{{cite journal | author = Hadjivassiliou M, Mäki M, Sanders DS, Williamson CA, Grünewald RA, Woodroofe NM, Korponay-Szabó IR | title = Autoantibody targeting of brain and intestinal transglutaminase in gluten ataxia | journal = Neurology | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 373–7 | year = 2006 | month = February | pmid = 16476935 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000196480.55601.3a }}</ref>

==Treatment==
The treatment of ataxia and its effectiveness depend on the underlying cause. Treatment may limit or reduce the effects of ataxia, but it is unlikely to eliminate them entirely. Recovery tends to be better in individuals with a single focal injury (such as [[stroke]] or a [[benign tumour]]), compared to those who have a neurological degenerative condition.<ref name="can rehabilitation help">{{cite journal | author = Morton SM, Bastian AJ | title = Can rehabilitation help ataxia? | journal = Neurology | volume = 73 | issue = 22 | pages = 1818–9 | year = 2009 | month = December | pmid = 19864635 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181c33b21 | url = }}</ref> A review of the management of degenerative ataxia was published in 2009.<ref name="systematic review">{{cite journal | author = Trujillo-Martín MM, Serrano-Aguilar P, Monton-Alvarez F, Carrillo-Fumero R | title = Effectiveness and safety of treatments for degenerative ataxias: a systematic review | journal = Mov.

[[Physical therapy]] requires a focus on adapting activity and facilitating [[motor learning]] for retraining specific functional motor patterns.<ref name="Intensive coordinative training improves motor performance in degenerative cerebellar disease">{{cite journal | author = Ilg W, Synofzik M, Brötz D, Burkard S, Giese MA, Schöls L | title = Intensive coordinative training improves motor performance in degenerative cerebellar disease | journal = Neurology | volume = 73 | issue = 22 | pages = 1823–30 | year = 2009 | month = December | pmid = 19864636 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181c33adf  }}</ref> A recent systematic review suggested that physical therapy is effective, but there is only moderate evidence to support this conclusion.<ref name="pmid19114434">{{cite journal | author = Martin CL, Tan D, Bragge P, Bialocerkowski A | title = Effectiveness of physiotherapy for adults with cerebellar dysfunction: a systematic review | journal = Clin Rehabil | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–26 | year = 2009 | month = January | pmid = 19114434 | doi = 10.1177/0269215508097853 }}</ref> The most commonly used physical therapy interventions for cerebellar ataxia are vestibular habituation, [[Frenkel Exercises]], [[proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation]] (PNF), and balance training; however, therapy is often highly individualized and gait and coordination training are large components of therapy.

Current research suggests that, if a person is able to walk with or without a [[mobility aid]], physical therapy should include an exercise program addressing five components: static balance, dynamic balance, trunk-limb coordination, stairs, and [[contracture]] prevention.  Once the physical therapist determines that the individual is able to safely perform parts of the program independently, it is important that the individual be prescribed and regularly engage in a supplementary home exercise program that incorporates these components to further improve long term outcomes.  These outcomes include balance tasks, gait, and individual activities of daily living.  While the improvements are attributed primarily to changes in the brain and not just the hip and/or ankle joints, it is still unknown whether the improvements are due to adaptations in the cerebellum or compensation by other areas of the brain.<ref name="Intensive coordinative training improves motor performance in degenerative cerebellar disease"/>

Decomposition, simplification, or slowing of multijoint movement may also be an effective strategy that therapists may use to improve function in patients with ataxia.<ref name="pmid9184691">{{cite journal | author = Bastian AJ | title = Mechanisms of ataxia | journal = Phys Ther | volume = 77 | issue = 6 | pages = 672–5 | year = 1997 | month = June | pmid = 9184691 | doi = }}</ref> Training likely needs to be intense and focused—as indicated by one study performed with stroke patients experiencing limb ataxia who underwent intensive upper limb retraining.<ref name="stroke ataxia">{{cite journal | author = Richards L, Senesac C, McGuirk T, Woodbury M, Howland D, Davis S, Patterson T | title = Response to intensive upper extremity therapy by individuals with ataxia from stroke | journal = Top Stroke Rehabil | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 262–71 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18647730 | doi = 10.1310/tsr1503-262 }}</ref> Their therapy consisted of [[constraint-induced movement therapy]] which resulted in improvements of their arm function.<ref name ="stroke ataxia" /> Treatment should likely include strategies to manage difficulties with everyday activities such as walking. Gait aids (such as a cane or walker) can be provided to decrease the risk of falls associated with impairment of [[Balance (ability)|balance]] or poor [[Motor coordination|coordination]]. Severe ataxia may eventually lead to the need for a [[wheelchair]]. In order to obtain better results, possible coexisting motor deficits need to be addressed in addition to those induced by ataxia. For example, muscle weakness and decreased endurance could lead to increasing fatigue and poorer movement patterns.

There are several assessment tools available to therapists and health care professionals working with patients with ataxia.  The [[International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale]] (ICARS) is one of the most widely used and has been proven to have very high reliability and validity.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Schmitz-Hübsch T, Tezenas du Montcel S, Baliko L, Boesch S, Bonato S, Fancellu R, Giunti P, Globas C, Kang JS, Kremer B, Mariotti C, Melegh B, Rakowicz M, Rola R, Romano S, Schöls L, Szymanski S, van de Warrenburg BP, Zdzienicka E, Dürr A, Klockgether T | title = Reliability and validity of the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale: a study in 156 spinocerebellar ataxia patients | journal = Mov.

==Other uses==
The term "ataxia" is sometimes used in a broader sense to indicate lack of coordination in some physiological process. Examples include '''optic ataxia''' (lack of coordination between visual inputs and hand movements, resulting in inability to reach and grab objects) and '''ataxic respiration''' (lack of coordination in respiratory movements, usually due to dysfunction of the respiratory centres in the [[medulla oblongata]]). Optic ataxia may be caused by lesions to the posterior parietal cortex, which is responsible for combining and expressing positional information and relating it to movement. Outputs of the posterior parietal cortex include the spinal cord, brain stem motor pathways, pre-motor and pre-frontal cortex, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Some neurons in the posterior parietal cortex are modulated by intention.  Optic ataxia is usually part of [[Balint's syndrome]], but can be seen in isolation with injuries to the superior parietal lobule, as it represents a disconnection between visual-association cortex and the frontal premotor and motor cortex.<ref name="pmid17603404">{{cite journal | author = Vallar G | title = Spatial neglect, Balint-Homes' and Gerstmann's syndrome, and other spatial disorders | journal = CNS Spectr | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 527–36 | year = 2007 | month = July | pmid = 17603404 | doi = }}</ref>
