The '''cornet''' is a [[brass instrument]] very similar to the [[trumpet]], distinguished by its conical [[Bore (wind instruments)|bore]], compact shape, and mellower tone quality.  The most common cornet is a [[transposing instrument]] in B{{music|flat}}. It is not related to the renaissance and early baroque [[cornett]].

==History==
The cornet was initially derived from the [[post horn]] around 1820 in France. Among the first manufacturers of modern cornets was Parisian Jean Asté in 1828.{{dubious|Jean_Aste|date=March 2011}} Cornets first appeared as separate instrumental parts in 19th century French compositions.<ref name="EB2">''Encyclopedia Britannica'', Micropedia, Volume III, William Benton, Chicago Illinois, 1974, p. 156</ref> 

This instrument could not have been developed without the improvement of [[piston valve]]s by [[Heinrich Stölzel]] and [[Friedrich Blühmel]]. In the early 19th century these two instrument makers almost simultaneously invented the valves still used today. They jointly applied for a patent and were granted this for a period of ten years. The first notable virtuoso player was [[Jean-Baptiste Arban]], who studied the cornet extensively and published ''La grande méthode complète de cornet à piston et de saxhorn'', commonly referred to as the ''[[Arban method]]'', in 1864.<ref>''Method for Trumpet'', Jean-Baptiste Arban, Carl Fisher & Co, NY, NY 1982</ref> Up until the early 20th century, the trumpet and cornet coexisted in musical ensembles. Symphonic repertoire often involves separate parts for trumpet and cornet. As several instrument builders made improvements to both instruments, they started to look and sound more alike. The modern day cornet is used in [[Brass band (British style)|brass band]]s, [[concert band]]s, and in specific [[orchestra]]l repertoire that requires a more mellow sound.<ref name="American">''The American History and Encyclopedia of Music'', W.C. Hubbard (ed.), "Musical Instruments", George W. Andrews, Irving Square, NY, NY, 1924</ref>

The name cornet derives from [[wikt:corne|corne]], meaning ''horn'', itself from Latin cornus. While not musically related, instruments of the Zink family (which includes [[Serpent (musical instrument)|serpents]]) are named "cornetto-   " with a tonal or pitch related Latin word following the hyphen to describe the particular variant. The 11th edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' referred to serpents as "old wooden cornets".<ref name="EB1">''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', Hugh Chisolm (ed.),  NY, NY, 1911, p. 675</ref> The Roman/Etruscan [[cornu (horn)|cornu]] (or simply "horn") is the lingual ancestor of these. It is a predecessor of the [[post horn]] from which the cornet evolved and was used like a bugle to signal orders on the battlefield.<ref name="American"/>

The instrument was once sometimes referred to as a cornopean, referencing the earliest cornets with the [[Stölzel valve system]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Relationship to trumpet==
The cornet was invented by adding valves to the [[post horn]] in 1814. The valves allowed for melodic playing throughout the register of the cornet. Trumpets were slower to adopt the new valve technology, so for the next 100 years or more, composers often wrote separate parts for trumpet and cornet. The trumpet would play [[fanfare]]-like passages, while the cornet played more melodic passages. The modern trumpet has valves that allow it to play the same notes and fingerings as the cornet.<ref>''The Technique of Orchestration'', Kent Wheeler Kennan, Prentice Hall, NY, NY 1952</ref>

Cornets and trumpets made in a given [[Key (music)|key]] (usually the key of B{{music|flat}}) play at the same pitch, and the technique for playing the instruments is nearly identical.  However, cornets and trumpets are not entirely interchangeable, as they differ in [[timbre]]. Also available, but usually seen only in the brass band, is an E{{music|flat}} soprano model, pitched a fourth above the standard B{{music|flat}}.

Unlike the trumpet, which has a cylindrical bore up until the bell section, the tubing of the cornet has a mostly conical bore, starting very narrow at the [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] and gradually widening towards the bell. Cornets following the 1913 patent of [[E.A. Couturier]] can have a continuously conical bore. The conical bore of the cornet is primarily responsible for its characteristic warm, mellow tone, which can be distinguished from the more penetrating sound of the trumpet. The conical bore of the cornet also makes it more agile than the trumpet when playing fast passages, but correct pitching is often less assured.<ref name="American"/> The cornet is often preferred for young beginners as it is easier to hold, with its centre of gravity much closer to the player. 

The cornet mouthpiece has a shorter and narrower shank than that of a trumpet so it can fit the cornet's smaller mouthpiece receiver. The cup size is  often deeper than that of a trumpet mouthpiece.<ref name="EB1"/>

[[File:Cornet2.png|thumb|250px|Short model traditional cornet, also known as a ''"Shepherd's Crook"'' shaped model (Webster's Dictionary 1911).]]

One variety is the short model traditional cornet, also known as a ''"Shepherd's Crook"'' shaped model. These are most often large–bore instruments with a rich mellow sound. There is also a long-model cornet, usually with a smaller bore and a brighter sound, which is closer to a trumpet in appearance. The Shepherd's Crook model is preferred by cornet traditionalists. The long-model cornet is generally used in concert bands in the United States, but has found little following in British-style brass and concert bands.<ref>Advertisement for the "King" Long Model Cornet, [[H.N. White Company]], Cleveland, Ohio, 1911</ref><ref>Advertisement for the "King" Large Bore Model Cornet, [[H.N. White Company]], Cleveland, Ohio, 1911</ref>

==Playing technique==
[[File:Connie Jones Silver Cornet.jpg|thumb|right|[[Connie Jones]] playing a long-model cornet.]]
Like the trumpet and all other modern brass wind instruments, the cornet makes a sound when the player vibrates ("buzzes") the lips in the mouthpiece, creating a vibrating column of air in the tubing. The [[frequency]] of the air column's vibration can be modified by changing the lip aperture or "[[embouchure]]". In addition, the column of air can be lengthened by engaging one or more valves, thus lowering the pitch.

Without valves, the player could only produce a [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] of notes like those played by the [[Bugle (instrument)|bugle]] and other "natural" brass instruments. These notes are far apart for most of the instrument's range, making [[diatonic and chromatic]] playing impossible except in the extreme high register. The valves change the length of the vibrating column and provide the cornet with the ability to play chromatically.<ref name="EB1"/>

==Ensembles with cornets==

===Brass band===
[[Brass band (British style)|British style brass band]] ensembles consist completely of brass instruments (except for the [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] section). The cornet is the leading melodic instrument in this ensemble and trumpets are never used. The ensemble consists of about thirty musicians, including nine B{{music|flat}} cornets and one E{{music|flat}} cornet ([[soprano cornet]]) in the higher registers. In England, companies such as [[Besson (company)|Besson]] and [[Boosey and Hawkes]] specialized in these instruments. In America, 19th century manufacturers such as Graves and Company, Hall and Quinby, E.G. Wright and the [[Boston Musical Instrument Company|Boston Musical Instrument Manufactury]] built lines of instruments for this format of ensemble.

===Concert band===
The cornet also features in the British-style [[concert band]], unlike the American concert band or wind band, where it is replaced by the [[trumpet]]. This slight difference in instrumentation derives from the British concert band's heritage in [[military band]]s, where the highest brass instrument is always the cornet. There are usually four to six B{{music|flat}} cornets present in a concert band, but no E{{music|flat}} instrument, as this role is taken by the [[E-flat clarinet|E{{music|flat}} clarinet]].

===Fanfare orkest===
Fanfare orkesten ("[[fanfare orchestra]]s"), only found in the Netherlands, Belgium, Northern France and Lithuania use the complete [[saxhorn]] family of instruments. The standard instrumentation includes both the cornet and the trumpet; however, in recent decades, the cornet has largely been replaced by the trumpet.

===Jazz ensemble===
In old style [[jazz band]]s the cornet was preferred to the trumpet, but from the swing era onwards it has been largely replaced by the louder, more piercing trumpet.  Likewise the cornet has been largely phased out of [[big bands]]  by a growing taste for louder and more aggressive instruments, especially since the advent of [[bebop]] in the post [[World War II]] era.

Legendary jazz pioneer [[Buddy Bolden]] played the cornet, and [[Louis Armstrong]] started off on the cornet but later switched to the trumpet. Cornetists such as [[Bubber Miley]] and [[Rex Stewart]] contributed substantially to the [[Duke Ellington Orchestra]]'s early sound. Other influential jazz cornetists include [[King Oliver]], [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Ruby Braff]] and [[Nat Adderley]]. Notable performances on cornet by players generally associated with the trumpet include [[Freddie Hubbard]]'s on ''[[Empyrean Isles]]'' by [[Herbie Hancock]] and [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]]'s on ''[[The Shape of Jazz to Come]]'' by [[Ornette Coleman]].
