Nanotubes are members of the [[fullerene]] structural family. Their name is derived from their long, hollow structure with the walls formed by one-atom-thick sheets of carbon, called [[graphene]]. These sheets are rolled at specific and discrete ("[[chirality|chiral]]") angles, and the combination of the rolling angle and radius decides the nanotube properties; for example, whether the individual nanotube shell is a [[metal]] or [[semiconductor]]. Nanotubes are categorized as [[#Single-walled|single-walled nanotubes]] (SWNTs) and [[#Multi-walled|multi-walled nanotubes]] (MWNTs). Individual nanotubes naturally align themselves into "ropes" held together by [[van der Waals force]]s, more specifically, pi-stacking.

Applied [[quantum chemistry]], specifically, [[orbital hybridization]] best describes chemical bonding in nanotubes. The [[chemical bonding]] of nanotubes is composed entirely of [[Sp2 bond|''sp''<sup>2</sup> bonds]], similar to those of [[graphite]]. These bonds, which are stronger than the [[Sp3 bond|''sp''<sup>3</sub> bonds]] found in [[alkane]]s and [[diamond]], provide nanotubes with their unique strength.

==Types of carbon nanotubes and related structures==

===Terminology===
There is no consensus on some terms describing carbon nanotubes in scientific literature: both "-wall" and "-walled" are being used in combination with "single", "double", "triple" or "multi", and the letter C is often omitted in the abbreviation; for example, multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT).

Most single-walled nanotubes (SWNT) have a diameter of close to 1&nbsp;nanometer, with a tube length that can be many millions of times longer. The structure of a SWNT can be conceptualized by wrapping a one-atom-thick layer of graphite called graphene into a seamless cylinder. The way the graphene sheet is wrapped is represented by a pair of indices (''n'',''m''). The integers ''n'' and ''m'' denote the number of unit [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] along two directions in the honeycomb [[crystal lattice]] of graphene. If ''m'' = 0, the nanotubes are called zigzag nanotubes, and if ''n'' = ''m'', the nanotubes are called armchair nanotubes. Otherwise, they are called chiral. The diameter of an ideal nanotube can be calculated from its (n,m) indices as follows

: <math> d = \frac{a}{\pi} \sqrt{(n^2 + nm + m^2)}=78.3 \sqrt{((n+m)^2-nm)}   \rm pm.</math>

where ''a'' = 0.246&nbsp;nm.

SWNTs are an important variety of carbon nanotube because most of their properties change significantly with the (''n'',''m'') values, and this dependence is non-monotonic (see [[Optical properties of carbon nanotubes#Kataura plot|Kataura plot]]). In particular, their [[band gap]] can vary from zero to about 2 eV and their electrical conductivity can show metallic or semiconducting behavior. Single-walled nanotubes are likely candidates for miniaturizing electronics. The most basic building block of these systems is the electric wire, and SWNTs with diameters of an order of a nanometer can be excellent conductors.<ref>

This results in a single SWNT that acts as a NOT logic gate with both p and n-type FETs within the same molecule.

Single-walled nanotubes are dropping precipitously in price, from around $1500 per gram as of 2000 to retail prices of around $50 per gram of as-produced 40–60% by weight SWNTs as of March 2010.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Multi-walled===
[[File:CNTSEM.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[scanning electron microscopy]] image of carbon nanotubes bundles]]
[[File:Multi-walled Carbon Nanotube.png|thumb|upright|Triple-walled armchair carbon nanotube]]
Multi-walled nanotubes (MWNT) consist of multiple rolled layers (concentric tubes) of graphene. There are two models that can be used to describe the structures of multi-walled nanotubes. In the ''[[Matryoshka doll|Russian Doll]]'' model, sheets of graphite are arranged in concentric cylinders, e.g., a (0,8) single-walled nanotube (SWNT) within a larger (0,17) single-walled nanotube. In the ''[[Scroll (parchment)|Parchment]]'' model, a single sheet of graphite is rolled in around itself, resembling a scroll of parchment or a rolled newspaper. The interlayer distance in multi-walled nanotubes is close to the distance between graphene layers in graphite, approximately 3.4 Å. The Russian Doll structure is observed more commonly. Its individual shells can be described as SWNTs, which can be metallic or semiconducting. Because of statistical probability and restrictions on the relative diameters of the individual tubes, one of the shells, and thus the whole MWNT, is usually a zero-gap metal.

Double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNT) form a special class of nanotubes because their morphology and properties are similar to those of SWNT but their resistance to chemicals is significantly improved. This is especially important when [[Surface functionalization|functionalization]] is required (this means grafting of chemical functions at the surface of the nanotubes) to add new properties to the CNT. In the case of SWNT, covalent functionalization will break some C=C [[double bond]]s, leaving "holes" in the structure on the nanotube and, thus, modifying both its mechanical and electrical properties. In the case of DWNT, only the outer wall is modified. DWNT synthesis on the gram-scale was first proposed in 2003<ref>

===Nanobud===
[[Carbon nanobud]]s are a newly created material combining two previously discovered allotropes of carbon: carbon nanotubes and [[fullerene]]s. In this new material, fullerene-like "buds" are covalently bonded to the outer sidewalls of the underlying carbon nanotube. This hybrid material has useful properties of both fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. In particular, they have been found to be exceptionally good field emitters. In composite materials, the attached fullerene molecules may function as molecular anchors preventing slipping of the nanotubes, thus improving the composite’s mechanical properties.

The fundamental advantage of an integrated [[graphene]]-CNT structure is the high surface area three-dimensional framework of the CNTs coupled with the high edge density of graphene. [[Graphene]] edges provide significantly higher charge density and reactivity than the basal plane, but they are difficult to arrange in a three-dimensional, high volume-density geometry. CNTs are readily aligned in a high density geometry (i.e., a vertically aligned forest)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cui|first=Hong-tao|coauthors=O. Zhou, and B. R.

N-CNTs can also be prepared by a CVD method of pyrolysizing [[melamine]] under Ar at elevated temperatures of 800<sup>o</sup>C - 980<sup>o</sup>C. However synthesis via CVD and melamine results in the formation of bamboo structured CNTs. XPS spectra of grown N-CNT's reveals nitrogen in five main components, pyridinic nitrogen, pyrrolic nitrogen, quaternary nitrogen, and nitrogen oxides. Furthermore synthesis temperature affects the type of nitrogen configuration.<ref>Y. Zhong et al. / Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids 71 (2010) 134–139</ref>

[[Nitrogen]] doping plays a pivotal role in [[Lithium]] storage. N-doping provides defects in the walls of CNT's allowing for Li ions to diffuse into interwall space. It also increases capacity by providing more favorable bind of N-doped sites. N-CNT's are also much more reactive to [[metal oxide]] nanoparticle deposition which can further enhance storage capacity, especially in anode materials for [[Lithium-ion battery|Li-ion batteries]].<ref>Nitrogen-Doped Multiwall Carbon Nanotubes for Lithium Storage with Extremely High Capacity

The ''highest density'' of CNTs was achieved in 2013, grown on a conductive titanium-coated copper surface that was coated with co-catalysts cobalt and molybdenum at lower than typical temperatures of 450 °C. The tubes averaged a height of 0.38 μm and a mass density of 1.6 g cm−3. The material showed ohmic conductivity (lowest resistance ∼22 kΩ).<ref name=kurz>{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/densest-array-of-carbon-nanotubes-grown-to-date |title=Densest array of carbon nanotubes grown to date |publisher=KurzweilAI |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1063/1.4818619}}</ref>

===Strength===
{{See also|Mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes}}

Carbon nanotubes are the strongest and stiffest materials yet discovered in terms of [[tensile strength]] and [[elastic modulus]] respectively. This strength results from the covalent sp<sup>2</sup> bonds formed between the individual carbon atoms. In 2000, a multi-walled carbon nanotube was tested to have a tensile strength of 63&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|gigapascals]] (GPa).<ref name="Strength and Breaking">

Under excessive tensile strain, the tubes will undergo [[plastic deformation]], which means the deformation is permanent. This deformation begins at strains of approximately 5% and can increase the maximum strain the tubes undergo before fracture by releasing strain energy.

Although the strength of individual CNT shells is extremely high, weak shear interactions between adjacent shells and tubes leads to significant reductions in the effective strength of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube bundles down to only a few GPa’s.<ref name="T.

<sup>E</sup>Experimental observation; <sup>T</sup>Theoretical prediction

The above discussion referred to axial properties of the nanotube, whereas simple geometrical considerations suggest that carbon nanotubes should be much softer in the radial direction than along the tube axis. Indeed, [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] observation of radial elasticity suggested that even the van der Waals forces can deform two adjacent nanotubes.<ref>

===Hardness===
Standard single-walled carbon nanotubes can withstand a pressure up to 25 GPa without deformation. They then undergo a transformation to superhard phase nanotubes. Maximum pressures measured using current experimental techniques are around 55 GPa. However, these new superhard phase nanotubes collapse at an even higher, albeit unknown, pressure.

The [[bulk modulus]] of superhard phase nanotubes is 462 to 546 GPa, even higher than that of diamond (420 GPa for single diamond crystal).<ref>

===Kinetic properties===
Multi-walled nanotubes are multiple concentric nanotubes precisely nested within one another. These exhibit a striking telescoping property whereby an inner nanotube core may slide, almost without friction, within its outer nanotube shell, thus creating an atomically perfect linear or rotational bearing.
This is one of the first true examples of [[molecular nanotechnology]], the precise positioning of atoms to create useful machines. Already, this property has been utilized to create the world's smallest rotational [[Synthetic molecular motors|motor]].<ref>

===Electrical properties===
[[File:Carbon nanotube bands.gif|thumb|Band structures computed using tight binding approximation for (6,0) CNT (zigzag, metallic) (10,2) CNT (semiconducting) and (10,10) CNT (armchair, metallic).]]
Because of the symmetry and unique electronic structure of graphene, the structure of a nanotube strongly affects its electrical properties. For a given (''n'',''m'') nanotube, if ''n'' = ''m'', the nanotube is metallic; if ''n'' − ''m'' is a multiple of 3, then the nanotube is semiconducting with a very small band gap, otherwise the nanotube is a moderate [[semiconductor]]. Thus all armchair (''n'' = ''m'') nanotubes are metallic, and nanotubes (6,4), (9,1), etc. are semiconducting.<ref name="Curvature">{{cite journal|first=X.|last=Lu|first2=Z.|title=Curved Pi-Conjugation, Aromaticity, and the Related Chemistry of Small Fullerenes (C<sub>60</sub>) and Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes|journal=[[Chemical Reviews]]|volume=105|pages=3643–3696|year=2005|doi=10.1021/cr030093d|issue=10|last2=Chen|pmid=16218563}}</ref>

However, this rule has exceptions, because curvature effects in small diameter carbon nanotubes can strongly influence electrical properties. Thus, a (5,0) SWCNT that should be semiconducting in fact is metallic according to the calculations. Likewise, ''vice versa''—zigzag and chiral SWCNTs with small diameters that should be metallic have finite gap (armchair nanotubes remain metallic).<ref name="Curvature"/> In theory, metallic nanotubes can carry an electric current density of 4 × 10<sup>9</sup> A/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is more than 1,000 times greater than those of metals such as [[copper]],<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Seunghun|last=Hong|year=2007|title=Nanotube Electronics: A flexible approach to mobility|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|volume=2|pages=207–208|doi=10.1038/nnano.2007.89|pmid=18654263|last2=Myung|first2=S|issue=4|bibcode = 2007NatNa...2..207H }}</ref> where for copper interconnects current densities are limited by [[electromigration]].

Because of their nanoscale cross-section, electrons propagate only along the tube's axis and electron transport involves quantum effects. As a result, carbon nanotubes are frequently referred to as one-dimensional conductors. The maximum [[electrical conductance]] of a single-walled carbon nanotube is 2''G''<sub>0</sub>, where ''G''<sub>0</sub> = 2''e''<sup>2</sup>/''h'' is the [[Conductance quantum|conductance of a single ballistic quantum channel]].<ref>J.-C.

===Defects===
As with any material, the existence of a [[crystallographic defect]] affects the material properties. Defects can occur in the form of atomic [[Vacancy defect|vacancies]]. High levels of such defects can lower the tensile strength by up to 85%. An important example is the [[Stone Wales defect]], which creates a pentagon and heptagon pair by rearrangement of the bonds. Because of the very small structure of CNTs, the tensile strength of the tube is dependent on its weakest segment in a similar manner to a chain, where the strength of the weakest link becomes the maximum strength of the chain.

Crystallographic defects also affect the tube's electrical properties. A common result is lowered conductivity through the defective region of the tube. A defect in armchair-type tubes (which can conduct electricity) can cause the surrounding region to become semiconducting, and single monatomic vacancies induce magnetic properties.<ref>''Carbon-Based Magnetism: An Overview of the Magnetism of Metal Free Carbon-based Compounds and Materials'', Tatiana Makarova and Fernando Palacio (eds.), Elsevier, 2006</ref>

Crystallographic defects strongly affect the tube's thermal properties. Such defects lead to [[phonon]] scattering, which in turn increases the relaxation rate of the phonons. This reduces the [[mean free path]] and reduces the thermal conductivity of nanotube structures. Phonon transport simulations indicate that substitutional defects such as nitrogen or boron will primarily lead to scattering of high-frequency optical phonons. However, larger-scale defects such as [[Stone Wales defect]]s cause phonon scattering over a wide range of frequencies, leading to a greater reduction in thermal conductivity.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=N.|last=Mingo|year=2008|title=Phonon transmission through defects in carbon nanotubes from first principles|journal=Phys.

===Toxicity===
{{see also|Fullerene#Safety and toxicity}}
The toxicity of carbon nanotubes has been an important question in nanotechnology. As of 2007, such research has just begun. The data are still fragmentary and subject to criticism. Preliminary results highlight the difficulties in evaluating the toxicity of this heterogeneous material. Parameters such as structure, size [[Frequency distribution|distribution]], [[surface area]], surface chemistry, [[surface charge]], and [[agglomeration]] state as well as purity of the samples, have considerable impact on the [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] of carbon nanotubes.

==Synthesis==
[[File:Mutr-nanotubes1.jpg|thumb|Powder of carbon nanotubes]]
Techniques have been developed to produce nanotubes in sizeable quantities, including [[Electric arc|arc discharge]], [[laser ablation]], high-pressure carbon monoxide disproportionation ([[HiPco]]), and [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD). Most of these processes take place in vacuum or with process gases. CVD growth of CNTs can occur in vacuum or at atmospheric pressure. Large quantities of nanotubes can be synthesized by these methods; advances in catalysis and continuous growth are making CNTs more commercially viable.

===Arc discharge===
Nanotubes were observed in 1991 in the carbon soot of graphite [[electrode]]s during an arc discharge, by using a current of 100 [[ampere|amps]], that was intended to produce fullerenes.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sumio|last=Iijima|year=1991|title=Helical microtubules of graphitic carbon|journal=Nature|volume=354|pages=56–58|doi=10.1038/354056a0|issue=6348|bibcode = 1991Natur.354...56I }}</ref> However the first [[macroscopic]] production of carbon nanotubes was made in 1992 by two researchers at [[NEC]]'s Fundamental Research Laboratory.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=T. W.|last=Ebbesen|year=1992|title=Large-scale synthesis of carbon nanotubes|journal=Nature|volume=358|pages=220–222|doi=10.1038/358220a0|last2=Ajayan|first2=P. M.|issue=6383|bibcode = 1992Natur.358..220E }}</ref> The method used was the same as in 1991. During this process, the carbon contained in the negative electrode sublimates because of the high-discharge temperatures. Because nanotubes were initially discovered using this technique, it has been the most widely used method of nanotube synthesis.

The yield for this method is up to 30% by weight and it produces both single- and multi-walled nanotubes with lengths of up to 50 micrometers with few structural defects.<ref name="nanotubes for electronics" />

===Laser ablation===
In laser ablation, a [[pulsed laser]] vaporizes a graphite target in a high-temperature reactor while an [[inert gas]] is bled into the chamber. Nanotubes develop on the cooler surfaces of the reactor as the vaporized carbon condenses. A water-cooled surface may be included in the system to collect the nanotubes.

This process was developed by Dr. [[Richard Smalley]] and co-workers at [[Rice University]], who at the time of the discovery of carbon nanotubes, were blasting metals with a laser to produce various metal molecules. When they heard of the existence of nanotubes they replaced the metals with graphite to create multi-walled carbon nanotubes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=Ting|title=Self-Assembly of Tubular Fullerenes|url=http://www.pa.msu.edu/cmp/csc/eprint/DT085.pdf|year=1995|journal=J.

The laser ablation method yields around 70% and produces primarily single-walled carbon nanotubes with a controllable diameter determined by the reaction [[temperature]]. However, it is more expensive than either arc discharge or chemical vapor deposition.<ref name="nanotubes for electronics" />

===Plasma torch===
Single-walled carbon nanotubes can be synthesized by the induction thermal plasma method, discovered in 2005 by groups from the University of Sherbrooke and the National Research Council of Canada.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=K.S.|title=Large-scale production of single-wall carbon nanotubes by induction thermal plasma|year=2007|journal= Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics|volume=40|page=2375|last2=Cota-Sanchez|first2=German|last3=Kingston|first3=Chris|last4=Imris|first4=M.|last5=Simard|first5=Benoît|last6=Soucy|first6=Gervais|bibcode = 2007JPhD...40.2375K |doi = 10.1088/0022-3727/40/8/S17 }}</ref> The method is similar to arc-discharge in that both use ionized gas to reach the high temperature necessary to vaporize carbon-containing substances and the metal catalysts necessary for the ensuing nanotube growth. The thermal plasma is induced by high frequency oscillating currents in a coil, and is maintained in flowing inert gas. Typically, a feedstock of carbon black and metal catalyst particles is fed into the plasma, and then cooled down to form single-walled carbon nanotubes. Different single-wall carbon nanotube diameter distributions can be synthesized.

The induction thermal plasma method can produce up to 2 grams of nanotube material per minute, which is higher than the arc-discharge or the laser ablation methods.

The diameters of the nanotubes that are to be grown are related to the size of the metal particles. This can be controlled by patterned (or masked) deposition of the metal, annealing, or by plasma etching of a metal layer. The substrate is heated to approximately 700°C. To initiate the growth of nanotubes, two gases are bled into the reactor: a process gas (such as [[ammonia]], [[nitrogen]] or [[hydrogen]]) and a carbon-containing gas (such as [[acetylene]], [[ethylene]], [[ethanol]] or [[methane]]). Nanotubes grow at the sites of the metal catalyst; the carbon-containing gas is broken apart at the surface of the catalyst particle, and the carbon is transported to the edges of the particle, where it forms the nanotubes.

CVD is a common method for the commercial production of carbon nanotubes. For this purpose, the metal nanoparticles are mixed with a catalyst support such as MgO or Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to increase the surface area for higher yield of the catalytic reaction of the carbon feedstock with the metal particles. One issue in this synthesis route is the removal of the catalyst support via an acid treatment, which sometimes could destroy the original structure of the carbon nanotubes. However, alternative catalyst supports that are soluble in water have proven effective for nanotube growth.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=A.|last=Eftekhari|title=High-yield synthesis of carbon nanotubes using a water-soluble catalyst support in catalytic chemical vapor deposition|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2005.12.006|journal=Carbon|volume=44|page=1343|year=2006|last2=Jafarkhani|first2=P|last3=Moztarzadeh|first3=F|issue=7}}</ref>

Of the various means for nanotube synthesis, CVD shows the most promise for industrial-scale deposition, because of its price/unit ratio, and because CVD is capable of growing nanotubes directly on a desired substrate, whereas the nanotubes must be collected in the other growth techniques.

Those SWNT forests can be easily separated from the catalyst, yielding clean SWNT material (purity >99.98%) without further purification.

The vertically aligned nanotube forests originate from a "zipping effect" when they are immersed in a solvent and dried. The zipping effect is caused by the surface tension of the solvent and the van der Waals forces between the carbon nanotubes. It aligns the nanotubes into a dense material, which can be formed in various shapes, such as sheets and bars, by applying weak compression during the process. Densification increases the [[Vickers hardness]] by about 70 times and density is 0.55 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The packed carbon nanotubes are more than 1&nbsp;mm long and have a carbon purity of 99.9% or higher; they also retain the desirable alignment properties of the nanotubes forest.<ref>

Many electronic applications of carbon nanotubes crucially rely on techniques of selectively producing either semiconducting or metallic CNTs, preferably of a certain chirality. Several methods of separating semiconducting and metallic CNTs are known, but most of them are not yet suitable for large-scale technological processes. The most efficient method relies on density-gradient ultracentrifugation, which separates surfactant-wrapped nanotubes by the minute difference in their density. This density difference often translates into difference in the nanotube diameter and (semi)conducting properties.<ref name=grad/> Another method of separation uses a sequence of freezing, thawing, and compression of SWNTs embedded in [[agarose]] gel. This process results in a solution containing 70% metallic SWNTs and leaves a gel containing 95% semiconducting SWNTs. The diluted solutions separated by this method show various colors.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Simple and Scalable Gel-Based Separation of Metallic and Semiconducting Carbon Nanotubes|journal=[[Nano Letters]]|volume=9|pages=1497–1500|year=2009|doi=10.1021/nl8034866 |pmid=19243112 |issue=4 |last1=Tanaka |first1=Takeshi |last2=Jin |first2=Hehua |last3=Miyata |first3=Yasumitsu |last4=Fujii |first4=Shunjiro |last5=Suga |first5=Hiroshi |last6=Naitoh |first6=Yasuhisa |last7=Minari |first7=Takeo |last8=Miyadera |first8=Tetsuhiko |last9=Tsukagoshi |first9=Kazuhito|bibcode = 2009NanoL...9.1497T }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=T.Tanaka|title=New, Simple Method for Separation of Metallic and Semiconducting Carbon Nanotubes|url=http://www.aist.go.jp/aist_e/latest_research/2009/20090406/20090406.html}}</ref> The separated carbon nanotubes using this method have been applied to electrodes, e.g. electric double-layer capacitor. <ref name="yamada">{{cite doi|10.1016/j.carbon.2011.09.062}}</ref> Moreover, SWNTs can be separated by the [[column chromatography]] method.

In addition to separation of semiconducting and metallic SWNTs, it is possible to sort SWNTs by length, diameter, and chirality. The highest resolution length sorting, with length variation of <10%, has thus far been achieved by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of DNA-dispersed carbon nanotubes (DNA-SWNT).<ref>{{cite journal | title=High-Resolution Length Sorting and Purification of DNA-Wrapped Carbon Nanotubes by Size-Exclusion Chromatography|journal=[[Anal.

An alternative to separation is development of a selective growth of semiconducting or metallic CNTs. Recently, a new CVD recipe that involves a combination of ethanol and methanol gases and quartz substrates resulting in horizontally aligned arrays of 95–98% semiconducting nanotubes was announced.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/nl803496s|title=Selective Growth of Well-Aligned Semiconducting Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes|year=2009| journal=Nano Letters|volume=9|pages=800–5|pmid=19159186|issue=2|last1=Ding|first1=Lei|last2=Tselev|first2=Alexander|last3=Wang|first3=Jinyong|last4=Yuan|first4=Dongning|last5=Chu|first5=Haibin|last6=McNicholas|first6=Thomas P.|last7=Li|first7=Yan|last8=Liu|first8=Jie|bibcode = 2009NanoL...9..800D }}</ref>

==Current applications==
Current use and application of nanotubes has mostly been limited to the use of bulk nanotubes, which is a mass of rather unorganized fragments of nanotubes. Bulk nanotube materials may never achieve a tensile strength similar to that of individual tubes, but such composites may, nevertheless, yield strengths sufficient for many applications. Bulk carbon nanotubes have already been used as composite fibers in [[polymers]] to improve the mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of the bulk product.

==Potential applications==
{{Main|Potential applications of carbon nanotubes}}

The strength and flexibility of carbon nanotubes makes them of potential use in controlling other nanoscale structures, which suggests they will have an important role in [[nanotechnology]] engineering. The highest tensile strength of an individual multi-walled carbon nanotube has been tested to be is 63&nbsp;[[GPa]].<ref name="Strength and Breaking"/> Carbon nanotubes were found in [[Damascus steel]] from the 17th century, possibly helping to account for the legendary strength of the swords made of it.<ref>{{cite journal| author=K.

===Structural===
Because of the carbon nanotube's superior mechanical properties, many structures have been proposed ranging from everyday items like clothes and sports gear to combat jackets and [[space elevator]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Space Elevator|first=Brad C.|last=Edwards|publisher=BC Edwards|year=2003|isbn=0-9746517-1-0}}</ref> However, the space elevator will require further efforts in refining carbon nanotube technology, as the practical tensile strength of carbon nanotubes can still be greatly improved.<ref name="nanotubes for electronics" />

For perspective, outstanding breakthroughs have already been made. Pioneering work led by Ray H. Baughman at the NanoTech Institute has shown that single and multi-walled nanotubes can produce materials with toughness unmatched in the man-made and natural worlds.<ref>{{Cite journal| title=Strong, Transparent, Multifunctional, Carbon Nanotube Sheets|journal=Science|year=2005|volume=309|pages=1215–1219|doi=10.1126/science.1115311|pmid=16109875|issue=5738| last1=Zhang| first1=M.| last2=Fang| first2=S| last3=Zakhidov| first3=AA| last4=Lee| first4=SB| last5=Aliev| first5=AE| last6=Williams| first6=CD| last7=Atkinson| first7=KR| last8=Baughman| first8=RH|bibcode = 2005Sci...309.1215Z }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| title=Super-tough carbon-nanotube fibres|doi=10.1038/423703a|journal=Nature|year=2003|volume=423|page=703 |last1=Dalton| first1=Alan B.| last2=Collins| first2=Steve| last3=Muñoz| first3=Edgar| last4=Razal| first4=Joselito M.| last5=Ebron| first5=Von Howard| last6=Ferraris| first6=John P.| last7=Coleman| first7=Jonathan N.| last8=Kim| first8=Bog G.| last9=Baughman| first9=Ray H.|bibcode = 2003Natur.423..703D }}</ref>

Carbon nanotubes are also a promising material as building blocks in bio-mimetic hierarchical composite materials given their exceptional mechanical properties (~1 TPa in modulus, and ~100 GPa in strength). Initial attempts to incorporate CNTs into hierarchical structures led to mechanical properties that were significantly lower than these achievable limits. Windle ''et al.'' have used an ''in situ'' chemical vapor deposition (CVD) spinning method to produce continuous CNT yarns from CVD grown CNT aerogels.<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1021/nl051419w|title=Hot-Drawing of Single and Multiwall Carbon Nanotube Fibers for High Toughness and Alignment|year=2005|journal=Nano Letters|volume=5|issue=11|pages=2212–2215|pmid=16277455| last1=Miaudet| first1=P.| last2=Badaire| first2=S.| last3=Maugey| first3=M.| last4=Derré| first4=A.| last5=Pichot| first5=V.| last6=Launois| first6=P.| last7=Poulin| first7=P.| last8=Zakri| first8=C.|bibcode = 2005NanoL...5.2212M }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1094982|title=Direct Spinning of Carbon Nanotube Fibers from Chemical Vapor Deposition Synthesis|year=2004|journal=Science|volume=304|issue=5668|pages=276–278|pmid=15016960|last1=Li|first1=Y.-L.|last2=Kinloch|first2=IA|last3=Windle|first3=AH|bibcode = 2004Sci...304..276L }}</ref> With this technology, they fabricated CNT yarns with strengths as high as ~9 GPa at small gage lengths of ~1&nbsp;mm, however, defects resulted in a reduction of specific strength to ~1 GPa at 20&nbsp;mm gage length.<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1002/adma.200700516|title=High Performance Fibres from 'Dog Bone' Carbon Nanotubes|year=2007|journal=Advanced Materials|volume=19|issue=21|pages=3721–3726| last1=Motta| first1=M.| last2=Moisala| first2=A.| last3=Kinloch| first3=I. A.| last4=Windle| first4=Alan H.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1126/science.1147635|title=High-Performance Carbon Nanotube Fiber|year=2007|journal=Science|volume=318|issue=5858|pages=1892–1895|pmid=18006708| last1=Koziol| first1=K.| last2=Vilatela| first2=J.| last3=Moisala| first3=A.| last4=Motta| first4=M.| last5=Cunniff| first5=P.| last6=Sennett| first6=M.| last7=Windle| first7=A.|bibcode = 2007Sci...318.1892K }}</ref> Espinosa ''et al.'' developed high performance DWNT-polymer composite yarns by twisting and stretching ribbons of randomly oriented bundles of DWNTs thinly coated with polymeric organic compounds.

In 2001 IBM researchers demonstrated how metallic nanotubes can be destroyed, leaving semiconducting ones behind for use as transistors. Their process is called "constructive destruction," which includes the automatic destruction of defective nanotubes on the [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]].<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Philip G.|last=Collins|title=Engineering Carbon Nanotubes and Nanotube Circuits Using Electrical Breakdown|journal=Science|volume=292|year=2001|pages=706–709|doi=10.1126/science.1058782|pmid=11326094|last2=Arnold|first2=MS|last3=Avouris|first3=P|issue=5517|bibcode = 2001Sci...292..706C }}</ref> This process, however, only gives control over the electrical properties on a statistical scale.

The potential of carbon nanotubes was demonstrated in 2003 when room-temperature ballistic transistors with ohmic metal contacts and [[High-k dielectric|high-k gate]] dielectric were reported, showing 20–30x higher ON current than state-of-the-art Si [[MOSFET]]s. This presented an important advance in the field as CNT was shown to potentially outperform Si. At the time, a major challenge was ohmic metal contact formation.

The first nanotube integrated memory circuit was made in 2004. One of the main challenges has been regulating the conductivity of nanotubes. Depending on subtle surface features a nanotube may act as a plain [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] or as a semiconductor. A fully automated method has however been developed to remove non-semiconductor tubes.<ref>{{Cite journal| title=Monolithic Integration of Carbon Nanotube Devices with Silicon MOS Technology|journal=Nano Letters|volume=4|year=2004|pages=123–127|doi=10.1021/nl0349707| last1=Tseng| first1=Yu-Chih| last2=Xuan| first2=Peiqi| last3=Javey| first3=Ali| last4=Malloy| first4=Ryan| last5=Wang| first5=Qian| last6=Bokor| first6=Jeffrey| last7=Dai| first7=Hongjie|bibcode = 2004NanoL...4..123T }}</ref>

===Electrical cables and wires===
Wires for carrying electrical current may be fabricated from pure nanotubes and nanotube-polymer composites. Recently small wires have been fabricated with specific conductivity exceeding copper and aluminum;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJw6JmZmdqE|title=Nanocables light way to the future|publisher=YouTube|date =September 9, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Iodine doped carbon nanotube cables exceeding specific electrical conductivity of metals|date =September 6, 2011|doi=10.1038/srep00083 |last1=Zhao |first1=Yao |last2=Wei |first2=Jinquan |last3=Vajtai |first3=Robert |last4=Ajayan |first4=Pulickel M. |last5=Barrera |first5=Enrique V. |journal=Scientific Reports (Nature)|volume=1|bibcode = 2011NatSR...1E..83Z }}</ref> these cables are the highest conductivity carbon nanotube and also highest conductivity non-metal cables.

===Carbon nanotube actuators===
The exceptional electrical and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes have made them alternatives to the traditional electrical actuators for both microscopic and macroscopic applications. Carbon nanotubes are very good conductors of both electricity and heat, and they are also very strong and elastic molecules in certain directions.<ref>http://nanofluid.ir</ref>

===Paper batteries===
A [[paper battery]] is a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] engineered to use a paper-thin sheet of [[cellulose]] (which is the major constituent of regular paper, among other things) infused with aligned carbon nanotubes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-08/rpi-bbs080907.php|title=Beyond Batteries: Storing Power in a Sheet of Paper|publisher=Eurekalert.org|date =August 13, 2007|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> The nanotubes act as [[electrodes]]; allowing the storage devices to conduct electricity. The battery, which functions as both a lithium-ion battery and a [[supercapacitor]], can provide a long, steady power output comparable to a conventional battery, as well as a supercapacitor’s quick burst of high power—and while a conventional battery contains a number of separate components, the paper battery integrates all of the battery components in a single structure, making it more energy efficient.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Solar cells===
One of the promising applications of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is their use in solar panels, due to their strong UV/Vis-NIR absorption characteristics. Research has shown that they can provide a sizeable increase in efficiency, even at their current unoptimized state. Solar cells developed at the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] use a carbon nanotube complex, formed by a mixture of carbon nanotubes and carbon [[buckyball]]s (known as [[fullerene]]s) to form snake-like structures. Buckyballs trap electrons, but they can't make electrons flow. Add sunlight to excite the polymers, and the buckyballs will grab the electrons. Nanotubes, behaving like copper wires, will then be able to make the electrons or current flow.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070719011151.htm|title=New Flexible Plastic Solar Panels Are Inexpensive And Easy To Make|publisher=ScienceDaily|date=July 19, 2007}}</ref>

Additional research has been conducted on creating SWNT hybrid solar panels to increase the efficiency further. These hybrids are created by combining SWNT's with photexcitable electron donors to increase the number of electrons generated. It has been found that the interaction between the photoexcited porphrin and SWNT generates electro-hole pairs at the SWNT surfaces. This phenomenon has been observed experimentally, and contributes practically to an increase in efficiency up to 8.5%.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Guldi, Dirk M., G.M.A. Rahman, Maurizio Prato, Norbert Jux, Shubui Qin, and Warren Ford|title=Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes as Integrative Building Blocks for Solar-Energy Conversion|journal=Angewandte Chemie|pmid=15724261|volume= 117 |year=2005|pages=2051–2054|doi=10.1002/ange.200462416|issue=13}}</ref>

===Hydrogen storage===
In addition to being able to store electrical energy, there has been some research in using carbon nanotubes to store hydrogen to be used as a fuel source. By taking advantage of the capillary effects of the small carbon nanotubes, it is possible to condense gases in high density inside single-walled nanotubes. This allows for gases, most notably hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), to be stored at high densities without being condensed into a liquid. Potentially, this storage method could be used on vehicles in place of gas fuel tanks for a hydrogen-powered car. A current issue regarding hydrogen-powered vehicles is the onboard storage of the fuel. Current storage methods involve cooling and condensing the H<sub>2</sub> gas to a liquid state for storage which causes a loss of potential energy (25–45%) when compared to the energy associated with the gaseous state. Storage using SWNTs would allow one to keep the H2 in its gaseous state, thereby increasing the storage effciency. This method allows for a volume to energy ratio slightly smaller to that of current gas powered vehicles, allowing for a slightly lower but comparable range.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Dillon, A. C., K. M. Jones, T. A. Bekkedahl, C. H. Klang, D. S. Bethune, and M. J. Heben|title=Storage of hydrogen in single-walled carbon nanotubes|journal=Nature|volume= 386|year=1997|doi=10.1038/386377a0|pages=377–379|issue=6623|bibcode = 1997Natur.386..377D }}</ref>

An area of controversy and frequent experimentation regarding the storage of hydrogen by adsorption in carbon nanotubes is the efficiency by which this process occurs. The effectiveness of hydrogen storage is integral to its use as a primary fuel source since hydrogen only contains about one fourth the energy per unit volume as gasoline.

====Experimental capacity====
One experiment<ref>{{cite journal|author=Safa, S., Mojtahedzadeh Larijani, M., Fathollahi, V., Kakuee, O. R.|title=Investigating Hydrogen Storage Behavior of Carbon Nanotubes at Ambient Temperature and Above by Ion Beam Analysis|journal=NANO|doi=10.1142/S1793292010002256|volume= 5|issue=6|year=2010|pages=341–347}}</ref> sought to determine the amount of hydrogen stored in CNTs by utilizing [[elastic recoil detection analysis]] (ERDA). CNTs (primarily SWNTs) were synthesized via [[chemical vapor disposition]] (CVD) and subjected to a two-stage purification process including air oxidation and acid treatment, then formed into flat, uniform discs and exposed to pure, pressurized hydrogen at various temperatures. When the data was analyzed, it was found that the ability of CNTs to store hydrogen decreased as temperature increased. Moreover, the highest hydrogen concentration measured was ~0.18%; significantly lower than commercially viable hydrogen storage needs to be.

In another experiment,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Yuca, N., Karatepe, N.|title=Hydrogen Storage in Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Purified by Microwave Digestion Method|journal=World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology|volume= 79|year=2011|pages=605–610}}</ref> CNTs were synthesized via CVD and their structure was characterized using [[Raman spectroscopy]]. Utilizing [[microwave digestion]], the samples were exposed to different acid concentrations and different temperatures for various amounts of time in an attempt to find the optimum purification method for SWNTs of the diameter determined earlier. The purified samples were then exposed to hydrogen gas at various high pressures, and their [[adsorption]] by weight percent was plotted. The data showed that hydrogen adsorption levels of up to 3.7% are possible with a very pure sample and under the proper conditions. It is thought that microwave digestion helps improve the hydrogen adsorption capacity of the CNTs by opening up the ends, allowing access to the inner cavities of the nanotubes.

====Limitations on efficient hydrogen adsorption====
The biggest obstacle to efficient hydrogen storage using CNTs is the purity of the nanotubes. To achieve maximum hydrogen adsorption, there must be minimum [[graphene]], amorphous carbon, and metallic deposits in the nanotube sample. Current methods of CNT synthesis require a purification step. However, even with pure nanotubes, the adsorption capacity is only maximized under high pressures, which are undesirable in commercial fuel tanks.

===Ultracapacitors===
MIT Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems uses nanotubes to improve [[ultracapacitors]]. The activated charcoal used in conventional ultracapacitors has many small hollow spaces of various size, which create together a large surface to store electric charge. But as charge is quantized into elementary charges, i.e. electrons, and each such elementary charge needs a minimum space, a significant fraction of the electrode surface is not available for storage because the hollow spaces are not compatible with the charge's requirements. With a nanotube electrode the spaces may be tailored to size—few too large or too small—and consequently the capacity should be increased considerably.<ref name="MIT">Halber, Deborah.

===Radar absorption===
Radars work in the microwave frequency range, which can be absorbed by MWNTs. Applying the MWNTs to the aircraft would cause the radar to be absorbed and therefore seem to have a smaller signature. One such application could be to paint the nanotubes onto the plane. Recently there has been some work done at the [[University of Michigan]] regarding carbon nanotubes usefulness as stealth technology on aircraft. It has been found that in addition to the radar absorbing properties, the nanotubes neither reflect nor scatter visible light, making it essentially invisible at night, much like painting current stealth aircraft black except much more effective. Current limitations in manufacturing, however, mean that current production of nanotube-coated aircraft is not possible. One theory to overcome these current limitations is to cover small particles with the nanotubes and suspend the nanotube-covered particles in a medium such as paint, which can then be applied to a surface, like a stealth aircraft.<ref>Bourzac, Katherine.

===Optical power detectors===

A spray-on mixture of carbon nanotubes and ceramic demonstrates unprecedented ability to resist damage while absorbing laser light. Such coatings that absorb as the energy of high-powered lasers without breaking down are essential for optical power detectors that measure the output of such lasers. These are used, for example, in military equipment for defusing unexploded mines. The composite consists of multiwall carbon nanotubes and a ceramic made of silicon, carbon and nitrogen. Including boron boosts the breakdown temperature. The nanotubes and graphene-like carbon transmit heat well, while the oxidation-resistant ceramic boosts damage resistance.
Creating the coating involves dispersing he nanotubes in [[toluene]], to which a clear liquid polymer containing boron was added. The mixture was heated to {{convert|1100| C|F}}. The result is crushed into a fine powder, dispersed again in toluene and sprayed in a thin coat on a copper surface.
The coating absorbed 97.5 percent of the light from a far-infrared laser and tolerated 15 kilowatts per square centimeter for 10 seconds. Damage tolerance is about 50 percent higher than for similar coatings, e.g., nanotubes alone and carbon paint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/super-nanotubes-remarkable-spray-on-coating-combines-carbon-nanotubes-with-ceramic?utm_source=KurzweilAI+Daily+Newsletter&utm_campaign=055a5d11ed-UA-946742-1&utm_medium=email |title=Super-nanotubes: ‘remarkable’ spray-on coating combines carbon nanotubes with ceramic |publisher=KurzweilAI |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1021/am302755x}}</ref>


===Loud speaker and earphone===
Carbon nanotubes have also been applied in the acoustics(such as loudspeaker and earphone).

===Other applications===
Carbon nanotubes have been implemented in nanoelectromechanical systems, including mechanical memory elements ([[Nano-RAM|NRAM]] being developed by [[Nantero|Nantero Inc.]]) and nanoscale electric motors (see [[Nanomotor]] or [[Nanotube nanomotor]]).

In May 2005, Nanomix Inc. placed on the market a hydrogen sensor that integrated carbon nanotubes on a silicon platform. Since then, Nanomix has been patenting many such sensor applications, such as in the field of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, glucose, DNA detection, etc.

[[Eikos|Eikos Inc]] of [[Franklin, Massachusetts|Franklin]], [[Massachusetts]] and Unidym Inc. of [[Silicon Valley]], California are developing transparent, electrically conductive films of carbon nanotubes to replace [[indium tin oxide]] (ITO).

A [[nanoradio]], a radio receiver consisting of a single nanotube, was demonstrated in 2007. 

A [[flywheel]] made of carbon nanotubes could be spun at extremely high velocity on a floating magnetic axis in a vacuum, and potentially store energy at a [[Energy density|density]] approaching that of conventional fossil fuels. Since energy can be added to and removed from flywheels very efficiently in the form of electricity, this might offer a way of [[Grid energy storage|storing electricity]], making the electrical grid more efficient and variable power suppliers (like wind turbines) more useful in meeting energy needs. The practicality of this depends heavily upon the cost of making massive, unbroken nanotube structures, and their failure rate under stress.

[[Carbon nanotube springs]] have the potential to indefinitely store elastic potential energy at ten times the density of lithium-ion batteries with flexible charge and discharge rates and extremely high cycling durability.

Ultra-short SWNTs (US-tubes) have been used as nanoscaled capsules for delivering MRI contrast agents in vivo.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nanotechnology and MRI contrast enhancement|doi=10.4155/fmc.10.3|journal= Future Medicinal Chemistry|year= 2010|volume= 2|issue= 3|pages =491–502|last1=Matson|first1=Michael L|last2=Wilson|first2=Lon J|pmid=21426177}}</ref>

Carbon nanotubes provide a certain potential for [[carbocatalysis|metal-free catalysis]] of inorganic and organic reactions. For instance, oxygen groups attached to the surface of carbon nanotubes have the potential to catalyze oxidative [[dehydrogenation]]s<ref name=zhang>{{cite journal|last1 = Zhang|first1 = J.|last2 = Liu|first2 = X.|last3 = Blume|first3 = R.|last4 = Zhang|first4 = A.|last5 = Schlögl|first5 = R.|last6 = Su|first6 = D.

[[Wake Forest University]] engineers are using multiwalled carbon nanotubes to enhance the brightness of [[field-induced polymer electroluminescent]] technology, potentially offering a step forward in the search for safe, pleasing, high-efficiency lighting. In this technology, moldable polymer matrix emits light when exposed to an electrical current. It could eventually yield high-efficiency lights without the mercury vapor of [[compact fluorescent lamps]] or the bluish tint of some fluorescents and LEDs, which has been linked with circadian rhythm disruption. <ref> {{cite journal |last=Dooley |first= Erin E.|last2= |first2= |date=2013-02 |title= The Beat, A New Lighting Alternative?|url= http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/121-a47/|journal= Environmental Health Perspectives|publisher=National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)  |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages= A47|doi= |accessdate=2013-12-01}}</ref>

==Discovery==
{{See also|Timeline of carbon nanotubes}}
A 2006 editorial written by Marc Monthioux and Vladimir Kuznetsov in the journal ''Carbon'' described the interesting and often-misstated origin of the carbon nanotube. A large percentage of academic and popular literature attributes the discovery of hollow, nanometer-size tubes composed of graphitic carbon to [[Sumio Iijima]] of [[NEC]] in 1991.<ref name="carbon">{{Cite journal|title=Who should be given the credit for the discovery of carbon nanotubes?|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2006.03.019|first=Marc|last=Monthioux|journal=Carbon|volume=44|year=2006|url=http://www.cemes.fr/fichpdf/GuestEditorial.pdf |format=PDF|page=1621|last2=Kuznetsov|first2=V|issue=9}}</ref>

In 1952 L. V. Radushkevich and V. M. Lukyanovich published clear images of 50 nanometer diameter tubes made of carbon in the Soviet ''Journal of Physical Chemistry''.<ref name="CVD"/> This discovery was largely unnoticed, as the article was published in the Russian language, and Western scientists' access to Soviet press was limited during the [[Cold War]]. It is likely that carbon nanotubes were produced before this date, but the invention of the [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM) allowed direct visualization of these structures.

Carbon nanotubes have been produced and observed under a variety of conditions prior to 1991. A paper by Oberlin, Endo, and Koyama published in 1976 clearly showed hollow carbon fibers with nanometer-scale diameters using a vapor-growth technique.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Filamentous growth of carbon through benzene decomposition|doi=10.1016/0022-0248(76)90115-9|first=A.|last=Oberlin|year=1976|volume=32|pages=335–349|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|issue=3|last2=Endo|first2=M.|last3=Koyama|first3=T.|bibcode = 1976JCrGr..32..335O }}</ref> Additionally, the authors show a TEM image of a nanotube consisting of a single wall of graphene. Later, Endo has referred to this image as a single-walled nanotube.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carbon Fibers and Carbon Nanotubes (Interview, Nagano, Japan)| last=Endo|first=Morinobu|last2=Dresselhaus|first2=M. S.|date=October 26, 2002|url=http://web.mit.edu/tinytech/Nanostructures/Spring2003/MDresselhaus/i789.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

In 1979, John Abrahamson presented evidence of carbon nanotubes at the 14th Biennial Conference of Carbon at [[Pennsylvania State University]]. The conference paper described carbon nanotubes as carbon fibers that were produced on carbon anodes during arc discharge. A characterization of these fibers was given as well as hypotheses for their growth in a nitrogen atmosphere at low pressures.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Structure of Carbon Fibers Found on Carbon Arc Anodes|journal=Carbon|volume=37|year=1999|page=1873|last=Abrahamson|first=John|last2=Wiles|first2=Peter G.|last3=Rhoades|first3=Brian L.|doi=10.1016/S0008-6223(99)00199-2|issue=11}}</ref>

In 1981, a group of Soviet scientists published the results of chemical and structural characterization of carbon nanoparticles produced by a thermocatalytical disproportionation of carbon monoxide. Using TEM images and [[X-ray scattering techniques|XRD]] patterns, the authors suggested that their “carbon multi-layer tubular crystals” were formed by rolling graphene layers into cylinders. They speculated that by rolling graphene layers into a cylinder, many different arrangements of graphene hexagonal nets are possible. They suggested two possibilities of such arrangements: circular arrangement (armchair nanotube) and a spiral, helical arrangement (chiral tube).<ref>Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR, Metals. 1982, #3, pp.12–17 (in Russian)</ref>

In 1987, Howard G. Tennett of Hyperion Catalysis was issued a U.S. patent for the production of "cylindrical discrete carbon fibrils" with a "constant diameter between about 3.5 and about 70&nbsp;nanometers..., length 10<sup>2</sup> times the diameter, and an outer region of multiple essentially continuous layers of ordered carbon atoms and a distinct inner core...."<ref>{{Ref patent|country=US|number=4663230|title=Carbon fibrils, method for producing same and compositions containing same|gdate=1987-05-05|fdate=1984-12-06|invent1=Tennent, Howard G.}}</ref>

Iijima's discovery of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the insoluble material of arc-burned graphite rods in 1991<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sumio|last=Iijima|title=Helical microtubules of graphitic carbon|journal=Nature|volume=354|pages=56–58|date=7 November 1991|doi=10.1038/354056a0|issue=6348|bibcode = 1991Natur.354...56I }}</ref> and Mintmire, Dunlap, and White's independent prediction that if single-walled carbon nanotubes could be made, then they would exhibit remarkable conducting properties<ref>{{cite journal|first=J.W.|last=Mintmire|title=Are Fullerene Tubules Metallic?|journal=Phys.

The discovery of nanotubes remains a contentious issue. Many believe that Iijima's report in 1991 is of particular importance because it brought carbon nanotubes into the awareness of the scientific community as a whole.<ref name="carbon"/>
