==Life==
He was born at [[Warrington, England|Warrington]], [[Lancashire]] into a distinguished literary family of prominent [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]. The best known of these was his paternal aunt, [[Anna Letitia Barbauld]], a [[man of letters|woman of letters]] who wrote poetry and essays as well as early [[children's literature]]. His father, [[Physician|Dr]] [[John Aikin]], was a medical doctor, historian, and author. His grandfather, also called [[John Aikin (Unitarian)|John Aikin]] (1713–1780), was a Unitarian scholar and theological tutor, closely associated with [[Warrington Academy]]. His sister [[Lucy Aikin|Lucy]] (1781–1864) was a historical writer. Their brother [[Charles Rochemont Aikin|Charles]] was adopted by their famous aunt and brought up as their cousin.

Arthur Aikin studied chemistry under [[Joseph Priestley]] in the [[New College at Hackney]], and gave attention to the practical applications of the science. In early life he was a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister for a short time. Aikin lectured on chemistry at [[Guy's Hospital]] for thirty-two years.  From 1803 to 1808 he was editor of the ''[[Annual Review (19th century)|Annual Review]]''. He was one of the founders of the [[Geological Society of London]] in 1807 and was its [[honorary secretary]] in 1812–1817. He contributed papers on the [[Telford and Wrekin|Wrekin]] and the [[Shropshire]] coalfield, among others, to the transactions of that society. Later he became Secretary of the [[Royal Society of Arts]].  He was founder of the [[Chemical Society|Chemical Society of London]] in 1841, being its first Treasurer and second President.

He was highly esteemed as a man of sound judgment and wide knowledge, he was also elected as [[FRSA]], having served as its Secretary. Aikin died at [[Hoxton]] in [[London]].
