The '''Agra Canal''' is an important [[India]]n [[irrigation]] work which starts from [[Okhla]] in [[Delhi]]. The Agra canal originates from [[Okhla]] barrage, downstream of Nizamuddin bridge.<ref>[http://irrigation.up.nic.in/achievements.htm Agra Canal Modernization Project]</ref> It opened in 1874.

In the beginning, it was available for navigation, in [[Delhi]], erstwhile [[Gurgaon]], [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] and [[Agra District|Agra]] Districts, and [[Bharatpur State]]. Later, navigation was stopped in 1904 and the canal has since then, been exclusively used for irrigation purposes only. At present the canal does not flow in district Gurgaon, but only in [[Faridabad]], which was earlier a part of Gurgaon.

The [[Canal]] receives its water from the [[Yamuna River]] at [[Okhla]], about 10 KM to the south of [[New Delhi]]. The weir across the [[Yamuna]] was the first attempted in [[Upper India]] upon a foundation of fine sand; it is about 800-yard long, and rises seven-feet above the summer level of the river.

From [[Okhla]] the canal follows the high land between the Khari-Nadi and the [[Yamuna]] and finally joins the Banganga river about {{nowrap|20 miles}} below Agra. Navigable branches connect the canal with [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] and [[Agra]].<ref>[[s:1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica/Agra Canal|Agra Canal]] {{1911}}.</ref>
the canal irrigates about 1.5 lakh hectares in [[Agra]], and [[Mathura]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Faridabad]] in [[Haryana]], [[Bharatpur district|Bharatpur]] in [[Rajasthan]] and also some parts of [[Delhi]]
