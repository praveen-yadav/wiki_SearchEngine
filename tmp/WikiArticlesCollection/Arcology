These largely hypothetical structures would contain a variety of residential, commercial, and agricultural facilities and minimize individual human environmental impact. They are often portrayed as self-contained or [[Autarky|economically self-sufficient]].

The concept has been primarily popularized, and the term itself coined, by architect [[Paolo Soleri]], and appears commonly in [[science fiction]].<ref>Peter Hamilton uses arcologies in his books such as Neutronium Alchemist</ref>

==Development==
An arcology is distinguished from a merely large building in that it is supposed to sustainably supply all or most of the resources for a comfortable life: power, climate control, food production, air and water purification, sewage treatment, etc.. It is supposed to supply these items for a large population. An arcology would need no connections to municipal or urban infrastructure in order to operate.

Arcologies were proposed to reduce human impacts on natural resources. Arcology designs often apply conventional building and civil engineering techniques in very large, but practical projects in order to achieve economies that are difficult to achieve in other ways. 
Frank Lloyd Wright proposed an early version<ref>Wright, Frank Lloyd, "An Organic Architecture"</ref> called [[Broadacre City]] although, in contrast to an arcology, it is two-dimensional and depends on a road network. His plan described transportation, agriculture, and commerce systems that would support an economy. Critics said that Wright's solution failed to account for population growth, and assumed a more rigid democracy than the U.S. actually has.

Paolo Soleri proposed later solutions, and coined the term 'arcology'.<ref>Soleri, Paolo, "Arcology: The City in the Image of Man"</ref> Soleri describes ways of compacting city structures in three dimensions to combat two-dimensional urban sprawl, and economize on transportation and other energy uses. Like Wright, Soleri proposed changes in transportation, agriculture, and commerce. Soleri explored reductions in resource consumption and duplication, land reclamation, and proposed to eliminate most private transportation. He favored greater use of shared social resources like public libraries.

==Similar real-world projects==
The largest arcology project under current development is [[Masdar City]] near [[Abu Dhabi]], in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. It is projected to house between 45,000 and 50,000 inhabitants on 6 square kilometers, and to have a [[sustainable]], [[zero-carbon city|zero-waste]], ecology.

[[Arcosanti]] is an experimental town under construction in central [[Arizona]]. Designed by Paolo Soleri, its primary purpose is to demonstrate principles of arcology.

Many cities in the world have proposed projects adhering to the design principles of the arcology concept, like [[Tokyo]], and  [[Dongtan]] near [[Shanghai]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,1635188,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=British to help China build 'eco-cities' | first=Frank | last=Kane | date=November 6, 2005 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref> The Dongtan project may have collapsed, and it failed to open for the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai World Expo]] in 2010.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/apr/23/greenwash-dongtan-ecocity Series: GreenwashPrevious | Next|Index Greenwash: The dream of the first eco-city was built on a fiction|Environment|The Guardian]</ref>

Certain urban projects reflect arcological principles. Pedestrian connection systems often provide a wide range of goods and services in a single structure. Some examples include the [[+15]] system in downtown [[Calgary]], Montréal’s [[RÉSO]] or the [[Minneapolis Skyway System]] and The Windscreen in [[Fermont|Fermont, Quebec]]. They include supermarkets, malls and entertainment complexes. The +15 is the world's most extensive skywalk, at {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} in total length. Minneapolis has the longest single path, at {{convert|8|mi|disp=flip|abbr=on}}. [[Seward's Success, Alaska]] was never built, but would have been a small city just outside of [[Anchorage]]. [[Chicago]] has a sizable tunnel system known as the [[Chicago Pedway]] connecting a portion of the buildings in the [[Chicago Loop]].

The [[Las Vegas Strip]] has many arcological features to protect people from the {{convert|45|C}} heat. Many major casinos are connected by tunnels, footbridges, and monorails. It is possible to travel from [[Mandalay Bay]] at the south end of the Strip to the [[Las Vegas Convention Center]], three miles (5&nbsp;km) to the north, without using streets. In many cases, it is possible to travel between several different casinos without ever going outdoors. It is possible to live in this complex without need to venture outside, except the Strip has not generally been considered self-sustainable.

The [[Toronto]] downtown area features an underground pedestrian network, [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]]. Multiple high-rises are connected by a series of underground tunnels. It is possible to live in this complex without need to venture outside, except the PATH network is not self-sustainable. The total network spans 28-kilometres (17&nbsp;mi).

[[McMurdo Station]] of the [[United States Antarctic Program]] and other scientific research stations on the [[continent]] of [[Antarctica]] resemble the popular conception of an arcology as a technologically advanced, self-sufficient human community. The base provides living and entertainment amenities for roughly 3,000 staff that visit each year. Its remoteness and the measures needed to protect its population from the harsh environment give it an insular character. While the station is not self-sufficient &mdash; the U.S. military delivers {{convert|8|e6USgal|m3|disp=flip}} of fuel and {{convert|11|e6lb|disp=flip|abbr=off|sigfig=1}} of supplies and equipment yearly through its [[Operation Deep Freeze]] resupply effort<ref>''Modern Marvels: Sub-Zero''. The History Channel.</ref> &mdash; it is isolated from conventional support networks. The base generates electricity with its own power plant, and grows fruits and vegetables in a hydroponic green <!--<ref>[http://www.antarctichydroponics.com/ Antarctic Hydroponics web site]</ref>-->  house, when resupply is nonexistent. Under [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty|international treaty]], it must avoid damage to the surrounding ecosystem.

[[Crystal Island]] is a proposed arcology in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. As of 2009, construction has been postponed indefinitely due to the [[Global financial crisis of 2008–2009|global economic crisis]].

==In popular culture==
'''Novels and comics'''
*[[H.G. Wells]]'s 1899 tale "[[When the Sleeper Wakes]]" describes a rudimentary version of pre-Soleri arcology, having developed from the evolution of transportation. They are hotel-like and dominate the surrounding landscape, having replaced all towns and cities, albeit preserving their names.<ref>[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=764 Town In One Building by H.G. Wells from When the Sleeper Wakes]</ref>
*[[William Hope Hodgson]]'s 1912 story "The Last Redoubt" from ''[[The Night Land]]'' features the first example of what we now would call an arcology, complete with a full artificial ecology, agriculture, and public transport by mobile roadways. The future Earthlings depicted &ndash; millions of years into the future &ndash; have different reasons for building their metallic pyramid.<ref>{{Citation |surname=Hodgson |given=William Hope |year=1912 |title=The Night Land |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10662}}</ref>
*In [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]]'s collaboration ''[[Oath of Fealty (novel)|Oath of Fealty]]'' (1982), much of the action is set in and around Todos Santos, an arcology built in a burnt-out section of [[Los Angeles]] that has evolved a separate culture from the city around it. A failed arcology is also the setting for Niven and [[Steven Barnes]]'s ''[[The California Voodoo Game]]''. Niven also occasionally refers to arcologies in his [[Known Space]] series, particularly in the stories involving Gil Hamilton, or the [[Pierson's Puppeteer]]s, whose arcologies are enormous (The smallest were cubes a mile in height, length and width. Their homeworld, Hearth, is a city-planet similar to Asimov's [[Trantor]], albeit populated by tripodal aliens.)
*In the [[Joe Haldeman]] novel ''[[The Forever War]]'' much of the action between William Mandella's first and second deployments occurs in an arcology.
*In the novel ''[[The World Inside]]'' by [[Robert Silverberg]], everyone lives in 'Urban Monads': self-contained three-kilometer-high hyperstructures of 1000-storeys each, providing everything necessary to the society. 
*In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]], Earth's population lives in large hyperstructures simply called Cities. In Asimov's ''[[Galactic Empire (series)|Empire]]'' and ''[[Foundation series|Foundation]]'' series, the capital planet [[Trantor]] of the galactic empire is a completely built-up planet, covered in its entirety with tall buildings and subterranean structures.
*All the remaining cities of the Earth are hyperstructures in [[Peter F. Hamilton]]'s ''[[The Night's Dawn Trilogy]]''. Arcology structures are located on worlds in  [[Peter F. Hamilton]]'s [[The Dreaming Void]] ([[Void Trilogy]]).
*In the [[Judge Dredd]] comic stories, originally published in ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'', the [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] of [[Mega-City One]] consists of many hundreds, if not thousands, of [[City Block (Judge Dredd)|City Block]]s, in which a citizen can be born, grow, live, and die without ever leaving.
*[[William Gibson]]'s [[Sprawl trilogy]] features various arcologies, namely the "projects", which is a megastructure constructed with electricity, heat, oxygen, and food that it produced. They are also featured in the [[Bridge Trilogy]].
*[[David Wingrove]]'s [[Chung Kuo (novel series)|Chung Kuo]] series depicts a dystopian future Earth in which almost the entire population lives within several hyperstructures that are thousands of feet tall and span entire continents.
* [[J. G. Ballard]]'s 1975 novel ''High Rise'' featured a luxury arcology in which disparity between social classes among the residents eventually led to widespread anarchy and a reversion to primitive archetypes.
* In [[Samuel Youd|John Christopher]]'s 1967-68 trilogy of novels ''[[The Tripods]]'', an alien race known as "the Masters" live in three huge, domed arcologies built on Earth to use as a base from which to colonise the planet. The structures are made from a golden material, and are capped with a crystal that replicates the atmospheric conditions of the Masters' home planet.
* In [[Lois McMaster Bujold]]'s [[Vorkosigan Saga]] novels, the inhabitants of the planet [[Komarr (fictional planet)|Komarr]] live in arcologies, because the surface of the planet is inhospitable.
* The [[James Blish]] and Normal L. Knight collaboration ''A Torrent of Faces'', set in the future where a trillion people inhabit the Earth, features several semi-enclosed 'cities'&mdash;massive buildings big enough to house, entertain and feed hundreds of millions of people. The city/building of London apparently extends as far as the Cornish coast.
* In the manga and anime world of ''[[BLAME!]]'' the plot takes place only in a gigantic megastructure/arcology simply called the City, which is still being expanded by its automatic systems.
* [[Frank Herbert]]'s novel ''[[The Dosadi Experiment]]'' focuses on the creation of a super race through the control of another race, that forces them to live in an arcological situation.
* In [[Gregory Benford]]'s ''[[Galactic Center Saga]]'', several thousand years in the future descendants of humanity have migrated deep towards the galactic core, to directly compete with the machine based civilizations. To survive, humanity is forced to transform itself, adding biological and cybernetic enhancements, to compete with the machines. Over 5000 years, as humanity falls further behind, culture decays from the Chandelier Age where humanity lived in great citadels between the stars, to the High Arcology Era and finally the Citadel Age.
 
'''Films and television'''
*Arcologies are common elements in futuristic [[anime]] and [[manga]] titles. An example is the [[post-apocalyptic]]/[[cyberpunk]] series ''[[Appleseed (manga)|Appleseed]]'' by [[Masamune Shirow]], in which hyperstructures dominate the skyline of the city Olympus.
*In the 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' by [[Ridley Scott]], the main offices of the fictional Tyrell Corporation (a [[Megacorp]]) resemble a hyperstructure.
*Bespin's Cloud City in Star Wars' ''[[Empire Strikes Back]]'' can be considered one.
*The Genom Tower arcologies (among other things) in the [[anime]] ''[[Bubblegum Crisis]]'' were partially inspired by the Tyrell hyperstructure. The series also features an underground "Geo City".
*The city in the 1976 film ''[[Logan's Run (film)|Logan's Run]]'' is entirely self-contained for all resources, except power, which is said to be supplied by water moved by the tides.
*In the film ''[[Equilibrium (film)|Equilibrium]]'', an arcology named Libria is the last human civilization, a society in which peace is kept by the forced administration of an injected liquid drug designed to completely suppress emotions.
*In the science fiction movie series ''[[The Matrix]]'', the last human city, known as [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]], is a hyperstructure. Due to nuclear scarring of the Earth's surface and atmosphere, the hyperstructure is buried deep underground. While ecologically sparse, the habitat's climate is controlled by complex machinery in the lower levels. The population is in the realm of 200,000. Due to the nature of the aggression from the machines, Zion is an example of a heavily fortified hyperstructure.
*In the fourth-season finale of the science fiction show ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'', a large battle takes place in space around an antiquated space hyperstructure known simply as 'Arcology'.
*In the episode "[[11:59 (Star Trek: Voyager)|11:59]]" of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'s'' fifth season (original air date: May 5, 1999), Earth's first self-contained ecosystem known as "The Millennium Gate" is referenced and described as one kilometer tall and having begun construction in 2001.
*In the ''Star Wars'' prequels, the galactic capital planet [[Coruscant]] has buildings many miles tall, and approaches the completely built-over condition of [[Trantor]] in Isaac Asimov's classic ''[[Foundation series|Foundation]]'' trilogy (Note: due to this, Coruscant was originally to be named ''Jhantor'' but was eventually renamed ''Coruscant'').
*In the film ''[[Æon Flux (film)|Æon Flux]]'', Earth's surviving humans live in Bregna, an enclosed and self-sufficient city-state.
*In the film and book ''[[City of Ember]]'', the principal city is either the last or one of several underground cities used to escape a devastating war. However, the scale of the city is far below a typical Arcology, having fewer than a thousand residents.
*In the anime ''[[Wolf's Rain]]'', ancient decaying domed cities from the times of the scientific breakthroughs shelter the remainder of humanity.
* The anime ''[[Get Backers]]'' has overarching plots involving a semi-constructed megabuilding called the Limitless Fortress. However, because its construction was abandoned, it has few inhabitants, and those it has may not all be (entirely) real.
*In the anime ''[[Code Geass]]'', the Holy Britannian Empire constructs an arcology over the ruins of Tokyo called the Tokyo Settlement.
*In the anime of ''[[Shangri-La (novel)|Shangri-La]]'', the arcology called Atlas stands behind a Tokyo abandoned after a devastating earthquake in the 2060s. It was intended to hold about three million people, and only those with either with connections or those who were chosen by lottery are allowed to live there.
*The structure "Fiddler's Green" from [[George A. Romero|George A. Romero's]] 2005 film ''[[Land of the Dead]]'' might also be considered an arcology.

'''Video games'''
* [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright's]] computer game ''[[SimCity 2000]]'' allows the construction of four different types of arcologies. More primitive models hold quite a few people in exchange for producing considerable pollution, but later models are denser and cleaner. When 301 of the most advanced model, the "Launch Arco," are built, an "exodus sequence" starts in which all Launch Arcos blast into space. This parallels parts of Soleri's book, in which hyperstructures were shown as being appropriate for environments in space, under the sea, in polar lands, etc.
* Another Wright game, ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'', features bubbled cities that serve the same function. In Wright's 1990 ''[[SimEarth]]'', "Nanotech Age" cities eventually advance to an exodus of the entire sentient species of the planet.
* Two levels of the video game ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]'' posits (circa 2072) a futuristic arcology, simply called the Arcology, on the edge of an ancient [[Medina quarter|medina]] in [[Cairo]].
* The Domes seen in 1999 and in the 24th century in ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' could be considered arcologies. The structure known as the Black Omen that appears across timelines after Queen Zeal summons Lavos to the Ocean Palace is defined as an arcology. The city of Chronopolis seen in ''[[Chrono Cross]]'' can also be considered as an arcology.
* In the computer game ''[[Afterlife (computer game)|Afterlife]]'', the player controlling [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]] can eventually purchase ''Love Domes'' or ''Omnibulges''. Functioning similarly to arcologies, these structures are the remnants of [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcended]]/destroyed Heaven/Hells that are able to hold billions of souls.
* In the computer game ''[[Civilization: Call to Power]]'', the "Arcology Advance," found in a near future part of the technology list, grants access to the Arcology building, which reduces overcrowding effects in its host city. This is also available in ''[[Call to Power II]]''.
* The tutorial in the computer game ''[[Dystopia (computer game)|Dystopia]]'' takes place in Yggdrasil's first arcology.
* The wholly self-sustained utopian society 'Rapture' in the computer and Xbox 360 game ''[[BioShock]]'' is an underwater example of an arcology.
* The game ''[[Shadowrun (2007 video game)]]'' mentions, as one of its important world events, the construction of RNA's Santos Corporate Arcology.
* The game ''[[Shadowrun (Mega-CD video game)]]'' includes Renraku Arcology as an in-game location.
* In ''[[Mass Effect]]'' the Codex (an in-game encyclopedia) explains that [[Earth]] is composed mainly of Arcology buildings.
* In ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' the city of ''[[Midgar]]'' and the military base of ''[[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Geography|Junon]]'' (both are built by the Shinra Company) are examples of arcology.
* In ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' the city of ''[[Esthar]]'' and the flying universities of Galbadia and Balamb are arcologies.
* In the "Next War" mod, included in [[Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword]], three levels of arcologies are available as city improvements.
* The ''[[Outpost (video game)|Outpost]]'' computer game and its sequel both focus on building arcologies (called 'colonies' in the game) on various planets to contain what remains of Humanity after Earth is obliterated by an asteroid.
* The game [[Brink (video game)|Brink]] is set on a futuristic arcology to preserve humanity after a natural flooding disaster.<ref>http://xbox.incgamers.com/Interviews/323/brink-qa-w-creative-director-richard-ham---part-1</ref>
* In ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'', Cocoon is an example of an arcology.
* In ''[[Xenogears]]'', the city of Kislev is the remains of a very ancient (4000 + years) military base that is a self-contained city.
* In the 2013 version of ''[[SimCity (2013 video game)|Sim City]]'', one of the great works in the game is an arcology.

'''Role-playing and table-top games'''
*In the table-top strategy game ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'', hyperstructures, called "hives," are extremely common and are the main method of housing large populations in the billions. Arcologies are so widespread that some planets, dubbed 'hive worlds', are constructed entirely of hyperstructures. ''[[Necromunda]]'', an off-shoot game set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, involves conflict between rival gangs on the hive world of Necromunda. Unlike the typical idea of an arcology - clean, healthy, and safe for the environment - "hives" are portrayed as dirty, diseased, overcrowded and the area around them as highly polluted.
*In the RPG ''[[Shadowrun]]'', a number of hyperstructures such as the "Renraku Arcology" exist by 2050, most of which are mega-corporate controlled. A major theme to these is the desire of a large corporation to control every aspect of its employees' lives. A major meta-plot element was the sealing off of the aforementioned Renraku Arcology in [[Seattle]] when the advanced computer control system ''awakened'' into a self-aware [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] named Deus.
*In the RPG ''[[Trinity (role-playing game)|Trinity]]'', a number of hyperstructures exist, with the largest being that of the New New York Arcology run by the Psi-Order Orgotek.
*In the ''[[Rifts (role-playing game)|Rifts]]'' RPG, the capital of the Coalition States is the city of Chi-Town. Along with some of the other major Coalition cities, Chi-Town is considered a "Mega-City" in that its entire population is housed inside one giant structure consisting of more than thirty levels, each of which are several stories high and contain a number of sub-levels.
*The tongue-in-cheek RPG ''[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]'' primarily takes place in the futuristic and mostly computer controlled arcology Alpha Complex.
*In R.Talsorian's follow up to ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'', ''Cybergeneration'', one of the player archetype Yo-Gangs was called the "Arcorunner". The character was a child who has grown up in the arcologies, knowing every aspect about them.
*In WildFire's ''[[CthulhuTech]]'' RPG, humanity has been forced to live in fortified arcologies due to attacks from the Old Ones and the Migou.
*In [[Mind Storm Labs]]'s ''Alpha Omega'' RPG, the world's populations have retreated into arcology city-states to protect themselves from the war-torn decimation of the Earth's surface
*Arcologies appear in the ''[[Buck Rogers XXVC]] ''RPG, particularly on ravaged Earth where they have replaced many former metropolitan centers.
*The [[Fallout (series)|''Fallout'' franchise]], created in 1997 by Interplay, contains several self-sustaining vaults that are cities. Each vault can hold around 1000 people, has its own self-sustaining power supply, water treatment center and built in food creators. Most vaults however, are known to have failed in less than 50 years or so in the series timeline, from attacks by enclave or mutants, destruction, or accidents. The only known vaults to be completely running 200 years after the bombs dropped are Vault 101, located in Washington DC, and Vault 21, Located in Las Vegas, Nevada.
