'''''Sid Meier's Civilization''''' is a [[turn-based strategy]] "[[4X]]"-type [[strategy video game]] created by [[Sid Meier]] and [[Bruce Shelley]] for [[Microprose Software|MicroProse]] in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civfanatics.com/civ1/index.php |title=Civilization 1 Fanatics' Site |publisher=Civfanatics.com |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civfanatics.com/interviews/CivChronicles_Bruce_Shelley.php |title=Interview with Bruce Shelley |publisher=Civfanatics.com |date=2006-10-24 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> The game's objective is to "Build an empire to stand the test of time": it begins in [[4th millennium BC|4000 BC]] and the players attempt to expand and develop their empires through the ages from the ancient era until modern and near-future times. It is also known simply as ''Civilization'', or abbreviated to ''Civ'' or ''Civ I''.

''Civilization'' was originally developed for [[DOS]] running on a [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]. It has undergone numerous revisions for various platforms (including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Macintosh]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]]) and now exists in several versions. A multiplayer [[Video game remake|remake]], '''''Sid Meier's CivNet''''' was released for the PC in 1995. The N-Gage version was the [[List of last games released on video game consoles#Released in North America|last game]] released for the system in [[North America]].

==Gameplay==

''Civilization'' is a turn-based single- or multiplayer strategy game. The player takes on the role of the ruler of a [[civilization]], starting with only one settler unit and one warrior, and attempts to build an [[empire]] in competition with one to eleven other civilizations. The game requires a fair amount of [[micromanagement (gameplay)|micromanagement]] (although less than any of the [[simulation game]]s).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civfanatics.com/civ1/manual/civ1_man.htm#2a |title=Civilization manual at Civ Fanatics |publisher=Civfanatics.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> Along with the larger tasks of [[exploration]], [[warfare]] and [[diplomacy]], the player has to make decisions about where to build new cities, which improvements or units to build in each city, which advances in knowledge should be sought (and at what rate), and how to transform the land surrounding the cities for maximum benefit. From time to time the player's towns may be harassed by [[barbarian]]s, units with no specific nationality and no named leader. These threats only come from unclaimed land or sea, so that over time there are fewer and fewer places from which barbarians will emanate.

Before the game begins, the player chooses which historical or current civilization to play. In contrast to later games in the ''Civilization'' series, this is largely a cosmetic choice, affecting titles, city names, musical heralds, and color. The choice does affect their starting position on the "Play on Earth" map, and thus different resources in one's initial cities, but has no effect on starting position when starting a random world game or a customized world game. The player's choice of civilization also prevents the computer from being able to play as that civilization or the other civilization of the same color, and since computer-controlled opponents display certain traits of their civilizations this affects gameplay as well. The [[Aztec]]s are both fiercely expansionist and generally extremely wealthy, for example. Other civilizations include the [[United States|Americans]], the [[Mongols]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Each civilization is led by a famous historical figure, such as [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] for [[India]].

The scope of ''Civilization'' is larger than most other games. The game begins in [[4th millennium BC|4000 BC]], before the [[Bronze Age]], and can last through to AD 2050 (on the easiest setting) with [[Space Age]] and "future technologies". At the start of the game there are no cities anywhere in the world: the player controls one or two settler units, which can be used to found new cities in appropriate sites (and those cities may build other settler units, which can go out and found new cities, thus expanding the empire). Settlers can also alter terrain, build improvements such as mines and [[irrigation]], build roads to connect cities, and later in the game they can construct railroads which offer unlimited movement.

As time advances, new technologies are developed; these technologies are the primary way in which the game changes and grows. At the start, players choose from advances such as [[pottery]], the [[wheel]], and the [[alphabet]] to, near the end of the game, [[nuclear fission]] and [[spaceflight]]. Players can gain a large advantage if their civilization is the first to learn a particular technology (the secrets of flight, for example) and put it to use in a military or other context. Most advances give access to new units, city improvements or derivative technologies: for example, the [[chariot]] unit becomes available after the wheel is developed, and the [[granary]] building becomes available to build after pottery is developed. The whole system of advancements from beginning to end is called the [[technology tree]], or simply the Tech tree; this concept has been adopted in many other strategy games. Since only one tech may be "researched" at any given time, the order in which technologies are chosen makes a considerable difference in the outcome of the game and generally reflects the player's preferred style of gameplay.

Players can also build ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' in each of the epochs of the game, subject only to obtaining the prerequisite knowledge. These wonders are important achievements of society, science, culture and defense, ranging from the [[Egyptian pyramids|Pyramid]]s and the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] in the Ancient age, to [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus' Observatory]] and [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan's Expedition]] in the middle period, up to the [[Apollo program]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[Manhattan Project]] in the modern era. Each wonder can only be built once in the world, and requires a lot of resources to build, far more than most other city buildings or units. Wonders provide unique benefits to the controlling civilization. For example, Magellan's Expedition increases the movement rate of naval units. Wonders typically affect either the city in which they are built (for example, the [[Colossus of Rhodes|Colossus]]), every city on the continent (for example, the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon|Hanging Gardens]]), or the civilization as a whole (for example, [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|Darwin's Voyage]]). Some wonders are made obsolete by new technologies.

The game can be won by conquering all other civilizations or by winning the [[space colonization|space race]] by reaching the star system of [[Alpha Centauri]].

==Development==
Meier admits to "borrowing" many of the technology tree ideas from a [[board game]] also called ''[[Civilization (board game)|Civilization]]'', published in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1980 by Hartland Trefoil (later by Gibson Games), and in the United States in 1981 by [[Avalon Hill]]. The early versions of the game even included a flier of information and ordering materials for the board game. There is  a [[Civilization: The Boardgame|board game]] based on the computer game version of ''Civilization'' that was published in 2002.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3633/sid-meiers-civilization-the-boardgame | title=Sid Meier's Civilization: The Boardgame}}</ref>

Meier was the third major designer to plan a computer version of ''Civilization'', but the first to actually carry out that plan. [[Danielle Bunten Berry]] planned to start work on the game after completing ''[[M.U.L.E.]]'' in 1983, and again in 1985, after completing ''[[The Seven Cities of Gold (video game)|The Seven Cities of Gold]]'' at [[Electronic Arts]]. In 1983 Bunten and producer [[Joe Ybarra]] opted to first do ''Seven Cities of Gold''. The success of ''Seven Cities'' in 1985 in turn led to a sequel, ''[[Heart of Africa]]''. Bunten never returned to the idea of ''Civilization''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/sid-meiers-civilization/trivia |title=Game Trivia for Sid Meier's Civilization |publisher=Mobygames.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> Meier's designs of ''[[Sid Meier's Pirates!|Pirates!]]'' and ''[[Sid Meier's Colonization|Colonization]]'' both contain elements of Bunten's ''The Seven Cities of Gold''. [[Don Daglow]], designer of ''[[Utopia (video game)|Utopia]]'', the first [[simulation game]], began work programming a version of ''Civilization'' in 1987. He dropped the project, however, when he was offered an executive position at [[Brøderbund]], and never returned to the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11228|title=Column: 'Playing Catch Up: Stormfront Studios' Don Daglow'|author=Alistair Wallis|publisher=Gamasutra}}</ref>

''Civilization'' originally started off as a real-time game, however Meier found it too similar to other [[real-time strategy]] games such as ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'', and instead opted for a system where each turn takes a predetermined amount of time, and will automatically execute. This plan was abandoned after wide dislike over the mechanic.<ref>{{cite book|title=Civilization Chronicles|publisher=2K Games|location=p33}}</ref>

When the first version of ''Civilization'' was being developed, it was designed to run on a PC, which at the time was transitioning from 16 color [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] to [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]], which could use 256 different colors. The decision to limit the number of different civilizations to 16 was made to make ''Civilization'' compatible with both display standards: 16 civilizations for the 16 colors available to EGA.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1523/the_history_of_civilization.php?page=6 | title= The History of Civilization | accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref>

The game (by means of all its versions and updates) has endured for more than two decades, with product being offered for sale the entire time in retail stores. This high level of interest has spawned a number of [[free and open source software|free and open source]] versions and inspired similar games by other commercial developers.

''Civilization'' won the [[Origins Award]] in the category Best Military or Strategy Computer Game of 1991.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.originsgames.com/awards/1991 | title=Origin Awards 1991 | accessdate=2007-06-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070528183529/http://www.originsgames.com/awards/1991 |archivedate = May 28, 2007}}</ref> A 1992 ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' survey of wargames with modern settings gave the game five stars out of five, describing it as "more addictive than [[crack cocaine|crack]] ... so rich and textured that the documentation is incomplete".<ref name="brooks199206">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=95 | title=The Modern Games: 1950 - 2000 | work=Computer Gaming World | date=1992-06 | accessdate=24 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.

{{quote|While some games might be equally addictive, none have sustained quite the level of rich, satisfying gameplay quite like Sid Meier's magnum opus. The blend of exploration, economics, conquest and diplomacy is augmented by the quintessential research and development model, as you struggle to erect the Pyramids, discover gunpowder, and launch a colonization spacecraft to ''Alpha Centauri''. For its day, ''Civilization'' had the toughest computer opponents around - even taking into account the "cheats", that in most instances added rather than detracted from the game. Just when you think the game might bog down, you discover a new land, a new technology, another tough foe - and you tell yourself, "just one more turn", even as the first rays of the new sun creep into your room... the most acute case of game-lock we've ever felt.<ref>''Computer Gaming World'' November 1996.</ref>}}

==''Sid Meier's CivNet''==
''Sid Meier's CivNet'' is a remake of the original game with added multiplayer, improved graphics and sound, and [[Windows 3.1]]/[[Windows 95|95]] support. Gameplay is almost identical to the original game. There are several methods of multiplayer, including [[Local area network|LAN]], primitive Internet play, [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseat]], modem, and direct serial link.

==Legacy==
{{see also|Civilization (series)}}

There have been several sequels to ''Civilization'', including ''[[Civilization II]]'' (1996), ''[[Civilization III]]'' (2001), ''[[Civilization IV]]'' (2005), ''[[Civilization Revolution]]'' (2008), and ''[[Civilization V]]'' (2010). In 1994, Meier produced a similar game titled ''[[Sid Meier's Colonization|Colonization]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameology.org/alien_other/colonization |title=Sid Meier’s Colonization |publisher=Gameology |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> The 1999 game ''[[Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri]]'' was also created by Meier and is in the same genre, but with a futuristic/space theme; many of the interface and gameplay innovations in this game eventually made their way into ''Civilization III'' and ''IV''. ''Alpha Centauri'' is not actually a sequel to ''Civilization'', despite beginning with the same event that ends ''Civilization'' and ''Civilization II'': a manned spacecraft from Earth arrives in the [[Alpha Centauri]] star system.

In 1994, MicroProse published ''[[Master of Magic]]'', a similar game but embedded in a medieval-fantasy setting where instead of technologies the player (a powerful wizard) develops spells, among other things. The game also shared many things with the popular fantasy card-trading game ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''. In 1999, [[Activision]] released ''[[Civilization: Call to Power]]'', a sequel of sorts to ''[[Civilization II]]'' but created by a completely different design team. ''Call to Power'' spawned a sequel in 2000, but by then Activision had has lost the rights to the ''Civilization'' name and could only call it ''[[Call to Power II]]''.

An open source clone of ''Civilization'' has been developed under the name of ''[[Freeciv]]'', with the slogan "'Cause civilization should be free" (currently it can be configured to match the rules of either ''Civilization'' or ''Civilization II''). Another game that partially clones it is a [[public domain]] game called ''[[C-evo]]''.
