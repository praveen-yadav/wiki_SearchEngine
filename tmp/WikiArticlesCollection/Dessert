'''Dessert''' is a typically sweet course that concludes a meal. The course usually consists of sweet foods, but may include other items.

There is a wide variety of desserts in [[western culture]]s including [[cake]]s, [[cookie]]s, [[biscuit]]s, [[gelatin]]s, [[pastry|pastries]], [[ice cream]]s, [[pie]]s, [[pudding]]s, and [[candy|candies]]. [[Fruit]] is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its natural sweetness. Many different cultures have their own variations of similar desserts around the world, such as in Russia, where many breakfast foods such as blint, oladi, and [[syrniki]] can be served with [[honey]] and [[jam]] to make them popular as desserts. The loosely defined course called dessert can apply to many foods.<ref name="History of Desserts">{{cite web|last=Delp|first=Valorie|title=History of Desserts|url=http://gourmet.lovetoknow.com/History_of_Desserts|work=Love to Know Gourmet|publisher=Love to Know Corp.|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word dessert originated from the French word desservir “to clean the table” and the negative of the Latin word servire.<ref name=Merriam-Webster>{{cite web|title=Dessert|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dessert|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster Incorporated|accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref>

==Usage==
The word dessert is most commonly used for this course in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], while "sweets" or "afters" or, informally, "pudding" are alternative terms that may also be used in the [[United Kingdom]] and some other Commonwealth countries, including [[Hong Kong]], and [[India]].<ref name=Etymology>{{cite web|title=Dessert|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=dessert&searchmode=none|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:The First Step - War on the White Slave Trade.jpg|thumb|alt=This shows a young couple at an ice cream parlor in 1910.|This is an ice cream parlor in 1910.]]
Desserts were first made using natural ingredients that were locally available.<ref name="History of Desserts" />  In ancient civilizations people enjoyed dried fruits, [[honeycomb]], or [[nut (fruit)|nuts]].<ref name="History of Desserts"/>  These were considered the first [[candies]].  When [[sugar]] began to be manufactured in the [[Middle Ages]] more sweet desserts became available.  Even then sugar was so expensive usually only the wealthy could indulge on special occasions.  [[Ice cream]] can be dated back to 3000BC{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and may be considered to be the “dessert” in the modern sense of the word.  The first [[apple pie]] recipe was printed in 1381.  Also in 1740 the first [[cupcake]] recipes were recorded.  Ice cream was a Chinese invention although [[Marco Polo]] expanded the technique to Europe in his travels.  By the 1800s recipes for how to make ice cream were very popular.  [[Vanilla]] also plays a large role many desserts including ice cream.  Vanilla was mostly grown in Mexico where they discovered if the vanilla pod was picked and dried then [[vanillin]] was produced which can be sweetened into a dessert on its own<ref name="History of Desserts"/>

Desserts are constantly changing with the new techniques and ingredients available at the time or in the area.  They have changed from natural [[candies]] and [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] to complex [[souffles]] and multi-layered [[cakes]].  The ingredients available affect the range of desserts that can be made in each region. The first desserts required minimal effort or preparation since ancient cultures were more focused on the nutrition in foods in order to survive.  Now, however, modern day cultures have more options in the desserts available.  [[Ice Cream]] went from being a shaved ice substance with flavoring to the dairy based, sweet treat modern children crave.<ref name="Desserts Last">{{cite news|last=Maxwell|first=Alexander|title=Desserts Shouldn't Have to Come Last|url=http://www.iowastatedaily.com/opinion/article_b72e764a-f2bf-11e1-b81d-001a4bcf887a.html|accessdate=18 October 2012|newspaper=Iowa State Daily|date=31 August 2012}}</ref>  Desserts also went through a major change in manufacturing.  The [[Industrial Revolution]] in [[United States|America]] and [[Europe]] changed desserts (and food in general) because they began to be mass-produced, processed, preserved, canned, and packaged.  The iconic foods soon became a staple in many households because of their availability.  Frozen foods became very popular starting in the 1920s when freezing emerged.  Also around the 1920s [[lunch counters]] and [[fast food restaurants]] were established with increasing popularity.  These processed foods became a huge part of diets in many industrialized nations.  Food has always varied with each culture and area, and, despite the boom in mass-produced processed desserts, they have still represented regional and ethnic cultures. Many countries have desserts and foods distinctive to their nations or region.<ref name="Food in America">{{cite web|last=Mintz|first=Steven|title=Food in America|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/food.cfm|publisher=Digital History|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>  One example of this is the [[churro]] historically from Spain.  These sticks of dough are now deep fried and normally filled.  They are available all throughout North and South America along with many other areas.  They started with Spanish shepherds as a substitute for bread.  Now they have been passed through generations and cultures and changed to a sweet confection different for each culture.<ref name=Churros>{{cite web|last=Cronk|first=Laura|title=Churros: A Secret History|url=http://www.theprisma.co.uk/2011/07/17/churros-a-secret-history/|publisher=The Prisma|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>

==Ingredients==
[[File:McCormick Spices.jpg|thumb|alt=McCormick Spices are popular in commercial American stores.|Spices can vary the taste of desserts and add flavor.]]
Desserts usually contain [[sugar]] or a sweetening agent. Desserts contain a range of ingredients which makes the end product differ.  Some of the more common ingredients in desserts are [[flour]], [[dairy]], [[egg (food)|eggs]], and [[spice]]s.  Sugar gives many desserts their “addictive sweetness” and contributes to their moisture and tenderness. The flour or starch component in most desserts serves as a protein and gives the dessert structure.  Different flours such as All-Purpose Flour or Pastry Flour provide a less rigid [[gluten]] network and therefore a different texture. Flour desserts may also contain dairy products. Different desserts use flour to various degrees.  Desserts like ice cream and puddings have some form of dairy as their main ingredient, whereas desserts like cakes and cookies have relatively small amounts.  The dairy products in baked goods keep the desserts moist. Many desserts also contain eggs, in order to form custard or to aid in the rising and thickening of a cake-like substance. Egg yolks specifically contribute to the richness of desserts.  Egg whites can act as a leavening agent when the proteins uncoil and expand.<ref name="Flour Facts">{{cite web|title=Baking Flour Facts|url=http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/tools-and-techniques/baking-flour-facts.htm|work=TLC|publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>  Desserts can contain many different spices and extracts to add a variety of flavors. One example of this is salt.  Salt is added to desserts to balance sweet flavors and create a contrast in flavors.  All these ingredients contribute to desserts and make them different.<ref name=Flour>{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Kelly|title=The Science of Baking|url=http://www.culinate.com/articles/features/baking_chemistry|publisher=Culinate|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>

==Varieties==
Dessert can come in variations of flavors, textures, and looks.  Desserts can be defined as a usually sweeter course that concludes a meal.<ref name=Merriam-Webster />  This definition includes a range of courses anywhere from fruits or dried nuts to multi-ingredient cakes and pies.  With the many different varieties of desserts the many cultures have different variations. In modern times the variations of desserts have usually been passed down or come from geographical regions.  This is one cause for the variation of desserts.  These are some major categories in which desserts can be placed.<ref name="Book Review">{{cite web|last=Drzal|first=Dawn|title=How We Got to Dessert|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/how-we-got-to-dessert.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>

*'''Cakes'''- [[Cakes]] are sweet tender breads made with sugar and delicate flour.  Cakes can vary from light, airy sponge cakes to dense cakes with less flour.  In addition, small-sized cakes have become popular in the form of [[cupcakes]] and [[petits fours]].

*'''Chocolates and candies'''- Many [[candies]] involve the crystallization of sugar which varies the texture of sugar crystals.  Candies can be found in many different forms including [[caramel]], [[marshmallows]], and [[taffy]].

*'''Cookies'''- [[Cookies]] are similar to cakes (the word coming from the Dutch word “koekje” meaning little cake).  Historically cookies were small spoonfuls of cake batter placed in the oven to test the temperature.  Cookies can come in many different forms.  Examples include layered bars, crispy [[meringue]]s, and soft [[chocolate chip cookies]].

*'''Custards and puddings'''- These kinds of sweets usually include a thickened dairy base.  Custards are cooked and thickened with eggs.  Baked custards can include crème brulee and [[flan]].  [[Puddings]] are thickened with starches.

*'''Donuts'''-[[Donuts]] are a sweet that can be considered a breakfast or dessert. It is considered a deep fried dessert made from flour. It is the shape of a circle, and sometimes has a hole in the center. There are two-types of donuts: ring-shaped with the circle in the middle, and filled. A filled donut differs from a ring-shaped donut as it is often filled with fruit preserves, cream, custard or other sweet fillings.  Square-shaped donuts are commonly referred to as [[fritters]].Fritters are fried and consist of batter or breading that is often filled with fruit, or other ingredients. Fritters are made up of eggs, milk, batter, deep or pan-fried, wheat flour, cornmeal, or a mix of two can make the batter. Donuts can be homemade or found at bakeries, grocery stores, and speciality outlets. [[Krispy Kreme]] and [[Dunkin Donuts]] are two well-known donut companies that are known for their ring-shaped and filled donuts.  In May 2013, the [[cronut]] was introduced by Dominique Ansel at the Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York City. It is best described as a donut and croissant combined. Cronuts are shaped in a circle and sometimes have a hole in the center. It is dough that is sugared, filled and glazed. Donuts are not always in the shape of a circle; some other shapes of donuts include twists, rings, and balls. 

*'''Frozen desserts'''- [[ice cream]] and [[gelato]] both fit into this category.  Ice cream is a cream base that is churned as it is frozen to create a creamy consistency, while gelato uses a milk base and has less air than ice cream. Thirdly, [[sorbet]] is made from churned fruit and is not dairy based.

*'''Pastries'''- [[Pastries]] can either take the form of light and flaky bread with an airy texture or unleavened dough with a high fat content.  Pastries can be eaten with fruits, chocolates, or other sweeteners and are often eaten with tea. 

*'''Pies'''- [[Pies]] and [[cobblers]] are a crust with a filling.  The crust can be either made from either a pastry or crumbs.  The fillings can be anything from fruits to puddings.

*'''Miscellaneous desserts'''- Many desserts cannot be categorized such as [[cheesecake]].  Though cheesecake is a similar to a custard, it is named “cake”.  Many desserts can span the categories and several don’t fit in a category at all.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sweet Food and Desserts|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/thesaurus-category/british/Sweet-food-and-desserts|work=MacMillan Dictionary|publisher=MacMillan Publishers Limited|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>

==Market==
The market for desserts has increased over the last few decades, which was greatly increased by the commercialism of baking desserts and the rise of food productions. Desserts are present in most restaurants as the popularity has increased.  Also many commercial stores have been established as solely desserts stores.  [[Ice cream parlors]] have been around since before 1800.<ref name="ice cream">{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=History of Ice Cream|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/foodrelatedinventions/a/ice_cream.htm|publisher=About.com Inventors|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>  Many businesses started advertising campaigns focusing solely on desserts.  The tactics used to market desserts are very different depending on the audience for example desserts can be advertised with popular movie characters to target children.<ref>{{cite web|last=Story|first=Mary|title=Food Advertising and Marketing Directed at Children and Adolescents in the US|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC416565/|work=PMC|publisher=US National Library of Medicine|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>  The rise of companies like [[Food Network]] has marketed many shows which feature dessert and their creation. Shows like these have displayed extreme desserts and made a game show atmosphere which made desserts a more competitive field.<ref name="Food Network">{{cite web|title=About Food Network|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/home/about-foodnetworkcom/index.html|work=Food Network.com|publisher=Food Network|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>

==Nutrition==
Desserts are by definition a sweet course. This usually means high content of [[sugar]] or [[fat]]s. Desserts have historically been known as a smaller course to end a meal but in modern times they have become a more major part of people's diets. Although desserts are sweet a small amount of sugar is recommended in a daily diet.<ref name=Diet>{{cite web|title=Dietary Guidelines for Americans|url=http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/DietaryGuidelines.htm|work=USDA|publisher=USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>  Certain desserts such as [[dark chocolate]], that have a lower sugar content, are popularly considered healthier because of their other nutritional content.<ref name="Dark Chocolate">{{cite web|last=Matthews|first=Susan|title=Elderly Brains Get a Boost from Dark Chocolate|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/08/14/elderly-brains-get-boost-from-dark-chocolate/|publisher=Fox News Network|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> One example of a healthier dessert is fresh fruit cooked without sugars or extra fats.<ref name=Healt>{{cite web|last=Goff|first=Corinne|title=5 Easy To Make, Good for You Desserts|url=http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/fitness/5-easy-to-make-good-for-you-desserts-no-kidding.html#b|publisher=FitDay|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>

==Usage exceptions==

The word "dessert" is occasionally used euphemistically in some [[Wesleyan]] religious communities (esp. southern Indiana) to refer to an [[alcoholic beverage]] consumed during a social event with family or friends. The consumption of alcohol is generally discouraged in the Wesleyan tradition, as it is considered to be in conflict with the pursuit of [[Christian perfection]] articulated in the teachings of [[John Wesley]]. Thus the term "dessert" has emerged as a code word among more liberal Wesleyans not opposed to the moderate use of alcohol.
