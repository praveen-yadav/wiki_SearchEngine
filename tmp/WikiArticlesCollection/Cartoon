A '''cartoon''' is a form of two-dimensional [[illustration|illustrated]] [[Visual arts|visual art]]. While the specific definition has changed over time, modern usage refers to a typically non-[[realism (arts)|realistic]] or semi-realistic [[drawing]] or [[painting]] intended for [[satire]], [[caricature]], or [[humor]], or to the artistic style of such works. An artist who creates cartoons is called a [[cartoonist]].<ref>[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]]</ref>

The term originated in the [[Middle Ages]] and first described a preparatory drawing for a piece of art, such as a painting, [[fresco]], [[tapestry]], or [[stained glass]] window. In the 19th century, it came to refer to humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers, and in the early 20th century and onward it referred to [[comic strip]]s and [[Animated cartoon|animated]] films.<ref name=Becker>Becker, Stephen.

==Fine art==
{{Main|Modello}}
A cartoon (from the [[Italian language|Italian]] "cartone" and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word "karton", meaning strong, heavy paper or pasteboard) is a full-size drawing made on sturdy [[paper]] as a study or ''[[modello]]'' for a [[painting]], [[stained glass]] or [[tapestry]]. Cartoons were typically used in the production of [[fresco]]es, to accurately link the component parts of the composition when painted on damp [[plaster]] over a series of days (''giornate'').<ref name="Constable1954">{{cite book|author=William George Constable|title=The Painter's Workshop|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jz6xYIn0_oQC&pg=PA115|accessdate=20 January 2013|year=1954|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|page=115}}</ref>

Such cartoons often have pinpricks along the outlines of the design; a bag of soot was then patted or "pounced" over the cartoon, held against the wall to leave black dots on the plaster ("pouncing"). Cartoons by [[Painting|painter]]s, such as the [[Raphael Cartoons]] in London and examples by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], are highly prized in their own right. Tapestry cartoons, usually coloured, were followed by eye by the [[weaving|weavers]] on the [[loom]].<ref name=Becker/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Minneapolis Institute of Arts|author2=Candace Adelson|title=European tapestry in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qjPrAAAAMAAJ|year=1994|publisher=The Institute|page=330}}</ref>

[[File:SubstanceandShadow.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]]'s "Cartoon no.1: Substance and Shadow" (1843) satirized preparatory cartoons for frescoes in the Palace of Westminster, creating the modern meaning of "cartoon".]]

In modern print media, a cartoon is a piece of art, usually humorous in intent. This usage dates from 1843 when ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' magazine applied the term to satirical drawings in its pages,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Punch.co.uk|title=History of the Cartoon|url=http://punch.co.uk/cartoonhistory02.html}}</ref> particularly sketches by John Leech. The first of these parodied the preparatory cartoons for grand historical frescoes in the then-new [[Palace of Westminster]]. The original title for these drawings was ''Mr Punch's face is the letter Q'' and the new title "cartoon" was intended to be ironic, a reference to the self-aggrandizing posturing of Westminster politicians.

Modern single-panel gag cartoons, found in magazines, generally consist of a single drawing with a typeset caption positioned beneath or (much less often) a [[speech balloon]]. Newspaper syndicates have also distributed single-panel gag cartoons by [[Mel Calman]], [[Bill Holman (cartoonist)|Bill Holman]], [[Gary Larson]], [[George Lichty]], [[Fred Neher]] and others. Many consider ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' cartoonist [[Peter Arno]] the father of the modern gag cartoon (as did Arno himself). The roster of magazine gag cartoonists includes [[Charles Addams]], [[Charles Barsotti]] and [[Chon Day]]. 

[[Bill Hoest]], [[Jerry Marcus]] and [[Virgil Partch]] began as a magazine gag cartoonists and moved on to do syndicated [[comic strips]]. Noteworthy in the area of newspaper cartoon illustration is [[Richard Thompson (cartoonist)|Richard Thompson]], who illustrated numerous feature articles in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' before creating his ''[[Cul de Sac (comic strip)|Cul de Sac]]'' comic strip. Sports sections of newspapers usually featured cartoons, sometimes including syndicated features such as Chester "Chet" Brown's ''[[All in Sport]]''.

[[Editorial cartoons]] are found almost exclusively in news publications and news websites. Although they also employ humor, they are more serious in tone, commonly using [[irony]] or [[satire]]. The art usually acts as a visual metaphor to illustrate a point of view on current social and/or political topics. Editorial cartoons often include speech balloons and, sometimes, multiple panels. [[Editorial cartoonist]]s of note include [[Herblock]], [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]], [[Jeff MacNelly]], [[Mike Peters (cartoonist)|Mike Peters]] and [[Gerald Scarfe]].<ref name=Becker/>

Comic strips, also known as "cartoon strips" in the United Kingdom, are found daily in newspapers worldwide, and are usually a short series of cartoon illustrations in sequence. In the [[United States]] they are not as commonly called "cartoons" themselves, but rather "comics" or "[[Sunday comics|funnies]]". Nonetheless, the creators of comic strips—as well as [[comic book]]s and [[graphic novel]]s—are usually referred to as "[[cartoonist]]s". Although humor is the most prevalent subject matter, adventure and drama are also represented in this medium. Noteworthy cartoonists of humor strips include [[Scott Adams]], [[Steve Bell (cartoonist)|Steve Bell]], [[Charles Schulz]], [[E. C. Segar]], [[Mort Walker]] and [[Bill Watterson]].<ref name=Becker/>

==Political cartoons==

{{main|Editorial cartoon}}

By the mid 19th century, major political newspapers in many countries featured cartoons commenting on the politics of the day. [[Thomas Nast]] in New York City brought realistic German drawing techniques to enliven American cartooning.  his 160 cartoons relentlessly pursued the criminal characteristic of the Tweed machine in New York City, and help bring it down.  Indeed, Tweed was arrested in Spain, when police identified him from Nast's cartoons.<ref>{{cite book|author1=John Adler|author2=Draper Hill|title=Doomed by Cartoon: How Cartoonist Thomas Nast and the New York Times Brought Down Boss Tweed and His Ring of Thieves|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z6YjB5FnKgwC|year=2008|publisher=Morgan James Publishing}}</ref>  Sir [[John Tenniel]] was the toast of London.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Frankie Morris|author2=Sir John Tenniel|title=Artist Of Wonderland: The Life, Political Cartoons, And Illustrations Of Tenniel|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iO1l532dx_YC|year=2005|publisher=University of Virginia Press}}</ref>

Political cartoons can be humorous or satirical, sometimes with piercing effect. The target may complain, but he can seldom fight back.  Lawsuits have been very rare.  the first successful lawsuit against the cartoonist in over a century in Britain came in 1921 when 
J.H. Thomas, the leader of the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the British Communist Party. Thomas claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of "Black Friday"—when he allegedly betrayed the locked-out Miners' Federation. To Thomas, the framing of his image by the far left threatened to grievously degrade his character In the popular imagination. Soviet inspired Communism was a new element in European politics, and cartoonists unrestrained by tradition tested the boundaries of libel law. Thomas won his lawsuit, and restore his reputation.<ref>Samuel S.  Hyde, "'Please, Sir, he called me “Jimmy!' Political Cartooning before the Law: 'Black Friday,' J.H. Thomas, and the Communist Libel Trial of 1921," ''Contemporary British History'' (2011) 25#4 pp 521-550</ref>

==Books==
Books with cartoons are usually reprints of newspaper cartoons. On some occasions, new gag cartoons have been created for book publication, as was the case with ''[[Think Small]]'', a 1967 promotional book distributed as a giveaway by [[Volkswagen]] dealers. [[Bill Hoest]] and other cartoonists of that decade drew cartoons showing Volkswagens, and these were published along with humorous automotive essays by such humorists as [[H. Allen Smith]], [[Roger Price (comedy)|Roger Price]] and [[Jean Shepherd]]. The book's design juxtaposed each cartoon alongside a photograph of the cartoon's creator.

==Animation==

{{Main|Animated cartoon}}
Because of the stylistic similarities between comic strips and early animated movies, "cartoon" came to refer to [[animation]], and the word "cartoon" is currently used to refer to both animated cartoons and gag cartoons. While "animation" designates any style of illustrated images seen in rapid succession to give the impression of movement, the word "cartoon" is most often used in reference to TV programs and short films for children featuring [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] animals, [[superhero]]es, the adventures of child protagonists and related genres.

At the end of the 1980s, the word "cartoon" was shortened, and the word "[[toon]]" came into usage with the live action/animated feature ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988), followed two years later by the TV series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' (1990).
