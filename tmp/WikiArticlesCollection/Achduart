'''Achduart''' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]: '''''Achadh Dhubhaird'''''<ref name="Mac an Tàilleir"/>) is a small hamlet in [[Coigach]], in [[Wester Ross]] in northwestern [[Scotland]], now within the [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] council area.<ref>{{cite map|title=[[Google Maps]]|publisher=Google|accessdate=22 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite map|title=[[Bing Maps]]|publisher= [[Microsoft]] and [[Harris Corporation]] Earthstar Geographics LLC|accessdate=22 October 2010}}</ref> It is situated about 4&nbsp;km southeast of the village of [[Achiltibuie]], at the end of a minor road. A footpath continues on to the hamlet of Culnacraig, then along the coast past [[Ben More Coigach]] to [[Strathcanaird]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Culnacraig circular|url=http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/ullapool/culnacraig.shtml|work=Walk Highlands|accessdate=23 April 2011}}</ref> 
Achduart has accommodation facilities for tourists, who come for its proximity to the ocean as well as its seclusion and remoteness. There is a [[Scottish Youth Hostels Association]] hostel in Acheninver, a short distance to the north.

The name of Achduart comes from the Gaelic for "the field at the black headland".<ref name="Mac an Tàilleir">{{cite web |author=Iain Mac an Tàilleir |year=2003 |publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]] |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/language/gaelic/vl-trans.htm |title=Placenames collected by Iain Mac an Tailleir |accessdate=29 January 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101225005529/http://scottish.parliament.uk/vli/language/gaelic/vl-trans.htm| archivedate= 25 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Achduart was part of the Estate of Coigach, Lochbroom, belonging to the [[Earl of Cromartie|Countess of Cromartie]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ct0MAQAAIAAJ&q=Achduart&dq=Achduart|title=Papers by command, Volume 15|publisher=Great Britain.
