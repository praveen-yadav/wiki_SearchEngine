A '''codex''' ([[Latin]] ''caudex'' for "trunk of a tree" or ''block of wood'', ''[[book]]''; plural ''codices'') is a book made up of a number of sheets of [[paper]], [[vellum]], [[papyrus]], or similar, with hand-written content,<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed: Codex: "a manuscript volume"</ref> usually stacked and bound by fixing one edge and with covers thicker than the sheets, but sometimes continuous and folded [[concertina]]-style. The alternative to paged codex format for a long document is the continuous [[scroll]]. Examples of folded codices are the [[Maya codices]]. Sometimes the term is used for a book-style format, including modern printed books but excluding folded books.

Developed by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] from wooden [[Wax tablet|writing tablets]], its gradual replacement of the [[scroll]], the dominant form of book in the [[Classical antiquity|ancient world]], has been termed the most important advance in the history of the book prior to the invention of [[Printing press|printing]].<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=1}}</ref> The codex altogether transformed the shape of the book itself and offered a form that lasted for centuries.<ref> Lyons, M., (2011). ''Books: A Living History'', London: Thames & Hudson, p. 8</ref> The spread of the codex is often associated with the rise of [[Christianity]], which adopted the format for the [[Bible]] early on.<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=38−67}}</ref> First described by the 1st-century AD Roman poet [[Martial]], who praised its convenient use, the codex achieved numerical parity with the scroll around AD 300,<ref name=Oxf>"Codex" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York & Oxford, 1991, p. 473. ISBN 0195046528</ref> and had completely replaced it throughout the now Christianised [[Greco-Roman world]] by the 6th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=75}}</ref>

==Advantages==

The codex holds considerable practical advantages over other book formats, such as compactness, sturdiness, ease of reference (a codex allows [[random access]], as opposed to a scroll, which uses [[sequential access]]), and especially economy of materials; unlike the scroll, both [[recto and verso]] could be used for writing.<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=45−53}}</ref> Although the change from rolls to codices roughly coincides with the transition from [[papyrus]] to [[parchment]] as favourite writing material, the two developments are quite unconnected. In fact, any combination of codices and scrolls on the one hand with papyrus and parchment on the other is technically feasible and well attested from the historical record.<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=5}}</ref>

Although technically even modern [[paperback]]s are codices, the term is now used only for [[manuscript]] (hand-written) books which were produced from [[Late antiquity]] until the [[Middle Ages]]. The scholarly study of these manuscripts from the point of view of the [[bookbinding]] craft is called [[codicology]]; the study of ancient documents in general is called [[paleography]].

==History==
[[File:Wachstafel rem.jpg|thumb|Reproduced Roman-style [[wax tablet]], from which the codex evolved]]

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used precursors made of reusable [[Wax tablet|wax-covered tablets of wood]] for taking notes and other informal writings. Two ancient [[polyptych]]s, a ''pentatych'' and ''octotych'', excavated at [[Herculaneum]] employed a unique connecting system that presages later sewing on thongs or cords.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carratelli|first=Giovanni Pugliese|title= "L'instrvmentvm Scriptorivm Nei Monumenti Pompeiani Ed Ercolanesi." in Pompeiana.

According to T.C.

Brill |location= Leiden|isbn=90-04-13920-6|page=45}}</ref> In his discussion of one of the earliest parchment codices to survive from [[Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt, Eric Turner seems to challenge Skeat’s notion when stating “…its mere existence is evidence that this book form had a prehistory” and that “early experiments with this book form may well have taken place outside of Egypt.”<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Eric|title=The Typology of the Early Codex|year=1977|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-7696-1 |page=38}}</ref> Early codices of parchment or papyrus appear to have been widely used as personal notebooks, for instance in recording copies of letters sent (Cicero ''Fam.'' 9.26.1). The pages of [[parchment]] notebooks were commonly washed or scraped for re-use, called a [[palimpsest]]; and consequently writings in a codex were considered informal and impermanent.

As far back as the early 2nd century, there is evidence that the codex—usually of [[papyrus]]—was the preferred format among [[Christianity|Christians]]: in the library of the [[Villa of the Papyri]], [[Herculaneum]] (buried in AD 79), all the texts (Greek literature) are scrolls (see [[Herculaneum papyri]]); in the [[Nag Hammadi]] "library", secreted about AD 390, all the texts (Gnostic Christian) are codices. Despite this comparison, a fragment of a non-Christian parchment Codex of Demosthenes, ''De Falsa Legatione'' from Oxyrhynchus in Egypt demonstrates that the surviving evidence is insufficient to conclude whether Christians played a major, if not central, role in the development of early codices, or if they simply adopted the format to distinguish themselves from [[Jews]]. The earliest surviving fragments from codices come from Egypt and are variously dated (always tentatively) towards the end of the 1st century or in the first half of the 2nd. This group includes the [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], containing part of St John's Gospel, and perhaps dating from between 125 and 160.<ref>Turner ''The Typology of the Early Codex'', U Penn 1977, and Roberts & Skeat ''The Birth of the Codex'' (Oxford University 1983). From Robert A Kraft (see link): "A fragment of a Latin parchment codex of an otherwise unknown historical text dating to about 100 CE was also found at Oxyrhynchus ([[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 30|P. Oxy. 30]]; see Roberts & Skeat 28). Papyrus fragments of a "Treatise of the Empirical School" dated by its editor to the centuries 1–2 CE is also attested in the Berlin collection (inv. # 9015, Pack\2 # 2355)—Turner, Typology # 389, and Roberts & Skeat 71, call it a "medical manual.""</ref>

In [[Western culture#Foundations|Western culture]] the codex gradually replaced the scroll. From the 4th century, when the codex gained wide acceptance, to the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 8th century, many works that were not converted from scroll to codex were lost to posterity. The codex was an improvement over the scroll in several ways. It could be opened flat at any page, allowing easier reading; the pages could be written on both front and back ([[recto and verso]]); and the codex, protected within its durable covers, was more compact and easier to transport.

The codex also made it easier to organize documents in a [[library]] because it had a stable spine on which the title of the book could be written. The spine could be used for the [[incipit]], before the concept of a proper title was developed, during medieval times.

Although most early codices were made of [[papyrus]], papyrus was fragile and supplies from Egypt, the only place where papyrus grew and was made into paper, became scanty; the more durable [[parchment]] and [[vellum]] gained favor, despite the cost.

The codices of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]] had the same form as the European codex, but were instead made with long folded strips of either fig bark ([[amatl]]) or plant fibers, often with a layer of [[whitewash]] applied before writing. [[New World]] codices were written as late as the 16th century (see [[Maya codices]] and [[Aztec codices]]). Those written before the Spanish conquests seem all to have been single long sheets folded [[concertina]]-style, sometimes written on both sides of the local [[amatl]] paper.

In the [[Far East]], the scroll remained standard for far longer than in the West. There were intermediate stages, such as scrolls folded [[concertina]]-style and pasted together at the back and books that were printed only on one side of the paper.<ref>[http://idp.bl.uk/education/bookbinding/bookbinding.a4d [[International Dunhuang Project]]—Several intermediate Chinese bookbinding forms from the 10th century].</ref> [[Judaism]] still retains the [[Torah]] scroll, at least for ceremonial use.

==Bookbinding==
Among the experiments of earlier centuries, scrolls were sometimes unrolled horizontally, as a succession of columns. (The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] are a famous example of this format.) This made it possible to fold the scroll as an accordion. The next step was then to cut the [[Folio (printing)|folios]], sew and glue them at their centers, making it easier to use the [[papyrus]] or [[vellum]] [[Recto and verso|recto-verso]] as with a modern book. In traditional bookbinding, these assembled folios trimmed and curved were called "codex" in order to differentiate it from the "case" which we now know as "hard cover". Binding the codex was clearly a different procedure from binding the "case".
