The original date of the celebration in [[Eastern Christianity]] was January 6, in connection with [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], and that is still the date of the celebration for the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and in [[Armenia]], where it is a public holiday. As of {{currentyear}}, there is a difference of 13 days between the modern [[Gregorian calendar]] and the older [[Julian calendar]]. Those who continue to use the Julian calendar or its equivalents thus celebrate December 25 and January 6, which on the Gregorian calendar translate as January 7 and January 19. For this reason, [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Eriteria]], [[Russia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Serbia]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and the [[Republic of Moldova]] celebrate Christmas on what in the Gregorian calendar is January 7. [[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches in [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgaria]], [[Church of Greece|Greece]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romania]], [[Antiochian Orthodox Church|Antioch]], [[Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania|Albania]], [[Orthodox Church of Finland|Finland]], and the [[Orthodox Church in America]] celebrate Christmas on December 25 in the [[revised Julian calendar]], corresponding to December 25 also in the Gregorian calendar.

In addition, several closely related and often interchangeable figures, known as [[Santa Claus]], [[Father Christmas]], [[Saint Nicholas]], and [[Christkind]], are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16329025 "Poll: In a changing nation, Santa endures"], Associated Press, December 22, 2006. Retrieved 2009-11-18.</ref> Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity among both Christians and non-Christians, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. The economic impact of Christmas is a factor that has grown steadily over the past few centuries in many regions of the world.

[[File:Map of Countries that do not recognize Christmas as Public Holiday.png|thumbnail|right|300px|Map of countries where Christmas is not a formal public holiday either on December 24/25 or January 6/7.]]
Christmas Day is celebrated as a major festival and [[public holiday]] in countries around the world, including many whose populations are mostly non-Christian. In some non-Christian countries, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g. [[Hong Kong]]); in others, Christian minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday. Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the secular aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations, and Christmas trees.

Countries in which Christmas is not a formal public holiday include [[Afghanistan]], [[Algeria]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Bhutan]], [[Cambodia]], [[China]] (excepting [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macao]]), [[Comoros]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Laos]], [[Libya]], [[Maldives]], [[Mauritania]], [[Mongolia]], [[Morocco]], [[North Korea]], [[Oman]], [[Pakistan]], [[Qatar]], [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Somalia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Thailand]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkey]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Yemen]]. Christmas celebrations around the world can vary markedly in form, reflecting differing cultural and national traditions.

Among countries with a strong Christian tradition, a variety of Christmas celebrations have developed that incorporate regional and local cultures. For Christians, participating in a religious service plays an important part in the recognition of the season. Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance. In [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] countries, people hold religious processions or [[parade]]s in the days preceding Christmas. In other countries, secular processions or parades featuring Santa Claus and other seasonal figures are often held. Family reunions and the exchange of gifts are a widespread feature of the season. Gift giving takes place on Christmas Day in most countries. Others practice gift giving on December 6, Saint Nicholas Day, and January 6, [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].

According to these accounts, Jesus was born to Mary, assisted by her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], in the city of [[Bethlehem]].
[[File:RozdestvoHristovo RublevBlagSoborMK.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]] of the birth of Christ by [[Andrei Rublev|St. Andrei Rublev]], 15th century]]

According to popular tradition, the birth took place in a stable, surrounded by farm animals. A [[manger]] (that is, a feeding trough) is mentioned in {{Bibleverse||Luke|2:7|KJV}}, where it states Mary "wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn" ([[King James Version|KJV]]); and "She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them" ([[New International Version|NIV]]).

The Gospel of Matthew instead describes a visit by an unspecified number of [[Biblical magi|magi]], or astrologers, sometime after Jesus was born while the family was living in a house ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|2:11|KJV}}), who brought gifts of [[gold]], [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]] to the young child Jesus. The visitors were said to be following a mysterious star, commonly known as the [[Star of Bethlehem]], believing it to announce the birth of a king of the Jews.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|2:2|131}}.</ref> The commemoration of this visit, the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of Epiphany]] celebrated on January 6, is the formal end of the Christmas season in some churches.

Christians celebrate Christmas in various ways. In addition to this day being one of the most important and popular for the attendance of church services, there are other devotions and popular traditions. In some [[Christian denominations]], children re-enact the events of the Nativity with animals to portray the event with more realism or sing [[carols]] that reference the event. A long artistic tradition has grown of producing painted depictions of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|nativity in art]]. Nativity scenes are traditionally set in a stable with livestock and include Mary, Joseph, the infant Jesus in the manger, the three wise men, the shepherds and their sheep, the angels, and the Star of Bethlehem.<ref>{{cite web

Prior to Christmas Day, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] practices the 40-day [[Nativity Fast]] in anticipation of the birth of Jesus, while much of [[Western Christianity]] celebrates four weeks of [[Advent]]. The final preparations for Christmas are made on [[Christmas Eve]], and many families' major observation of Christmas actually falls in the evening of this day.

The practice of putting up special decorations at Christmas has a long history.

Nativity scenes are known from 10th-century Rome. They were popularised by Saint [[Francis of Asissi]] from 1223, quickly spreading across Europe.<ref name=Collins47>Collins, Ace, ''Stories Behind the Great Traditions of Christmas'', Zondervan, (2003), ISBN 0-310-24880-9 p.47.</ref> Different types of decorations developed across the Christian world, dependent on local tradition and available resources. The first commercially produced decorations appeared in Germany in the 1860s, inspired by paper chains made by children.<ref name=Collins83>Collins p. 83.</ref> In countries where a representation of the [[Nativity Scene]] is very popular, people are encouraged to compete and create the most original or realistic ones. Within some families, the pieces used to make the representation are considered a valuable family [[heirloom]].

The traditional colors of Christmas decorations are [[red]], [[green]], and [[gold (color)|gold]].

The [[Christmas tree]] is considered by some as [[Christianisation]] of [[pagan]] tradition and ritual surrounding the [[Winter Solstice]], which included the use of [[evergreen]] boughs, and an adaptation of pagan [[tree worship]];<ref name=Shaman/> according to eighth-century biographer [[Æddi Stephanus]], [[Saint Boniface]] (634–709), who was a missionary in Germany, took an axe to an oak tree dedicated to [[Thor]] and pointed out a [[fir tree]], which he stated was a more fitting object of reverence because it pointed to [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]] and it had a triangular shape, which he said was symbolic of the [[Trinity]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe|title=Christmas|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|year=2010|quote=His biographer, Eddius Stephanus, relates that while Boniface was serving as a missionary near Geismar, Germany, he had enough of the locals' reverence for the old gods. Taking an aze to an oak tree dedicated to Norse god Thor, Boniface chopped the tree down and dared Thor to zap him for it. When nothing happened, Boniface pointed out a young fir tree amid the roots of the oak and explained how this tree was a more fitting object of reverence as it pointed towards the Christian heaven and its triangular shape was reminiscent of the Christian trinity.}}</ref> The [[English language]] phrase "Christmas tree" is first recorded in 1835<ref name=Harper>Harper, Douglas, [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Christ Christ], ''Online Etymology Dictionary,'' 2001.</ref> and represents an importation from the [[German language]].

From Germany the custom was introduced to Britain, first via [[Queen Charlotte]], wife of [[George III]], and then more successfully by Prince Albert during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]]. By 1841 the Christmas tree had become even more widespread throughout Britain.<ref name="Lejeune, Marie Claire p.550">Lejeune, Marie Claire.

Since the 19th century, the [[poinsettia]], a native plant from [[Mexico]], has been associated with Christmas. Other popular holiday plants include holly, [[mistletoe]], red [[amaryllis]], and [[Christmas cactus]]. Along with a Christmas tree, the interior of a home may be decorated with these plants, along with [[Garland (decoration)|garlands]] and [[evergreen]] foliage. The display of [[Christmas village]]s has also become a tradition in many homes during this season. The outside of houses may be decorated with lights and sometimes with illuminated [[Sled|sleighs]], [[snowmen]], and other Christmas figures.

Other traditional decorations include [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], [[candles]], [[candy canes]], [[Christmas stocking|stockings]], [[wreath]]s, and [[angels]]. Both the displaying of wreaths and candles in each window are a more traditional Christmas display.

===Music and carols===
{{Main|Christmas music}}
[[File:Chant'tie d'Cantiques dé Noué Dézembre 2009 Jèrri a.jpg|thumb|Christmas carolers in [[Jersey]]]]
The earliest extant specifically Christmas hymns appear in 4th-century [[Rome]]. Latin hymns such as "[[Veni redemptor gentium]]", written by [[Ambrose]], Archbishop of Milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the Incarnation in opposition to [[Arianism]]. "Corde natus ex Parentis" ("Of the Father's love begotten") by the Spanish poet [[Prudentius]] (d. 413) is still sung in some churches today.<ref>Miles, Clement, ''Christmas customs and traditions'', Courier Dover Publications, 1976, ISBN 0-486-23354-5, p.32</ref>

In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Christmas "Sequence" or "Prose" was introduced in North European monasteries, developing under [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] into a sequence of rhymed [[stanza]]s. In the 12th century the Parisian monk Adam of St. Victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional [[Christmas carol]].

By the 13th century, in France, Germany, and particularly, Italy, under the influence of [[Francis of Asissi]], a strong tradition of popular Christmas songs in the native language developed.<ref>Miles, pp. 31–37</ref> Christmas carols in English first appear in a 1426 work of [[John Audelay|John Awdlay]], a [[Shropshire]] chaplain, who lists twenty-five "caroles of Cristemas", probably sung by groups of [[Wassailing|wassailers]], who went from house to house.<ref>Miles, pp. 47–48</ref>

The songs we know specifically as carols were originally communal folk songs sung during celebrations such as "harvest tide" as well as Christmas. It was only later that carols began to be sung in church. Traditionally, carols have often been based on [[medieval]] chord patterns, and it is this that gives them their uniquely characteristic musical sound. Some carols like "[[Personent hodie]]", "[[Good King Wenceslas]]", and "[[The Holly and the Ivy]]" can be traced directly back to the [[Middle Ages]]. They are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung. "[[Adeste Fideles]]" (O Come all ye faithful) appears in its current form in the mid-18th century, although the words may have originated in the 13th century.

[[File:Steaua, Bucharest, 1842 crop.jpg|thumb|Child singers in [[Bucharest]], 1841]]
Singing of carols initially suffered a decline in popularity after the [[Protestant Reformation]] in northern Europe, although some Reformers, like [[Martin Luther]], wrote carols and encouraged their use in worship. Carols largely survived in rural communities until the revival of interest in popular songs in the 19th century. The 18th-century English reformer [[Charles Wesley]] understood the importance of music to worship. In addition to setting many psalms to melodies, which were influential in the [[Great Awakening]] in the United States, he wrote texts for at least three Christmas carols. The best known was originally entitled "Hark! How All the Welkin Rings", later renamed "[[Hark! the Herald Angels Sing]]".<ref>{{cite book

[[Felix Mendelssohn]] wrote a melody adapted to fit Wesley's words. In Austria in 1818 Mohr and Gruber made a major addition to the genre when they composed "[[Silent Night]]" for the St. Nicholas Church, Oberndorf. [[William Sandys (antiquarian)|William Sandys]]' ''Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern'' (1833) contained the first appearance in print of many now-classic English carols, and contributed to the mid-Victorian revival of the festival.<ref>Richard Michael Kelly.

[[File:Jingle Bells.ogg|thumb|left|Jingle Bells, 19th century (instrumental)]]
Completely secular Christmas seasonal songs emerged in the late 18th century. "[[Deck the Halls|Deck The Halls]]" dates from 1784, and the American "[[Jingle Bells]]" was copyrighted in 1857. In the 19th and 20th century, African American spirituals and songs about Christmas, based in their tradition of spirituals, became more widely known. An increasing number of seasonal holidays songs were commercially produced in the 20th century, including jazz and blues variations. In addition, there was a revival of interest in early music, from groups singing folk music, such as The Revels, to performers of early medieval and classical music.

===Traditional cuisine===
{{Further|List of Christmas dishes|Christmas dinner}}
[[File:Christmas pudding.JPG|thumb|right|[[Christmas pudding]] cooked on [[Stir-up Sunday]], the Sunday before the beginning of the [[Advent]] season]]
A special [[Christmas dinner|Christmas family meal]] is traditionally an important part of the holiday's celebration, and the food that is served varies greatly from country to country. Some regions, such as [[Sicily]], have special meals for Christmas Eve, when 12 kinds of fish are served. In the United Kingdom and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey or goose, meat, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread and cider. Special desserts are also prepared, such as [[Christmas pudding]], [[mince pie]]s, and [[fruit cake]].<ref>Broomfield, Andrea (2007) [http://books.google.com/books?id=fJ_JDp9OgJEC&pg=PA149&dq=christmas+pudding+england&hl=en&ei=xzAVTc3WNoqWhQePsJW3Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=christmas%20pudding%20england&f=false Food and cooking in Victorian England: a history] pp.149–150. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007</ref><ref>Muir, Frank (1977) ''Christmas customs & traditions'' p.58. Taplinger Pub. Co., 1977</ref>

In Poland and other parts of eastern Europe and Scandinavia, fish often is used for the traditional main course, but richer meat such as lamb is increasingly served. In Germany, France, and Austria, goose and pork are favored. Beef, ham, and chicken in various recipes are popular throughout the world. The [[Maltese people|Maltese]] traditionally serve ''[[Imbuljuta tal-Qastan]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schoolnet.gov.mt/HelloEurope/activities/recepies/imbuljuta.html |title=Imbuljuta |publisher=Schoolnet.gov.mt |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}</ref> a chocolate and chestnuts beverage, after [[Midnight Mass]] and throughout the Christmas season. Slovaks prepare the traditional Christmas bread [[potica]], ''[[bûche de Noël]]'' in France, ''[[panettone]]'' in Italy, and elaborate tarts and cakes. The eating of sweets and chocolates has become popular worldwide, and sweeter Christmas delicacies include the German ''[[stollen]]'', [[marzipan]] cake or candy, and Jamaican rum fruit cake. As one of the few fruits traditionally available to northern countries in winter, oranges have been long associated with special Christmas foods.

===Cards===
{{Main|Christmas card}}

Christmas cards are illustrated messages of greeting exchanged between friends and family members during the weeks preceding Christmas Day. The traditional greeting reads "wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year", much like that of the first commercial [[Christmas card#History|Christmas card]], produced by [[Sir Henry Cole]] in London in 1843.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1679110.stm Christmas card sold for record price] BBC News. Retrieved 2011-10-28</ref> The custom of sending them has become popular among a wide cross-section of people with the emergence of the modern trend towards exchanging [[E-card]]s.

Christmas cards are purchased in considerable quantities, and feature artwork, commercially designed and relevant to the season. The content of the design might relate directly to the [[Nativity of Jesus|Christmas narrative]] with [[Nativity of Jesus in art|depictions of the Nativity of Jesus]], or [[Christian symbols]] such as the [[Star of Bethlehem]], or a white [[dove]] which can represent both the [[Holy Spirit]] and [[Peace]] on Earth. Other Christmas cards are more [[secular]] and can depict [[Christmas tradition]]s, mythical figures such as [[Santa Claus]], objects directly associated with Christmas such as candles, holly and baubles, or a variety of images associated with the season, such as Christmastide activities, snow scenes and the wildlife of the northern winter. There are even humorous cards and genres depicting nostalgic scenes of the past such as [[crinoline]]d shoppers in idealized 19th century streetscapes.

Some prefer cards with a poem, prayer, or [[Bible verse|Biblical verse]]; while others distance themselves from religion with an all-inclusive "Season's greetings".

===Commemorative stamps===
{{Main|Christmas stamp}}
A number of nations have issued [[commemorative stamp]]s at Christmastide. Postal customers will often use these stamps to mail [[Christmas card]]s, and they are popular with [[philately|philatelists]]. These stamps are regular [[postage stamps]], unlike [[Christmas seal]]s, and are valid for postage year-round. They usually go on sale some time between early October and early December, and are printed in considerable quantities.

In 1898 a Canadian stamp was issued to mark the inauguration of the Imperial Penny Postage rate. The stamp features a map of the globe and bears an inscription "XMAS 1898" at the bottom. In 1937, Austria issued two "Christmas greeting stamps" featuring a [[rose]] and the signs of the [[zodiac]]. In 1939, [[Brazil]] issued four [[semi-postal]] stamps with designs featuring the [[three kings]] and a [[star of Bethlehem]], an [[angel]] and child, the [[Southern Cross]] and a child, and a mother and child.

Both the [[US Postal Service]] and the [[Royal Mail]] regularly issue Christmas-themed stamps each year.

===Gift giving===
{{See also|Gift economy}}
The exchanging of [[gift]]s is one of the core aspects of the modern Christmas celebration, making it the most profitable time of year for [[retail]]ers and businesses throughout the world. Gift giving was common in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] celebration of [[Saturnalia]], an ancient festival which took place in late December and may have influenced Christmas customs.<ref name="OriginMyth">[http://web.archive.org/web/20110430004539/http://www.bsu.edu/web/01bkswartz/xmaspub.html The Origin of the American Christmas Myth and Customs] – ''Ball State University''.

====Gift-bearing figures====
{{Main|Santa Claus|Father Christmas}}
{{See also|Saint Nicholas|Basil of Caesarea}}
[[File:Sinterklaas 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Sinterklaas]] or [[Saint Nicholas]], considered by many to be the original Santa Claus]]
A number of figures are associated with Christmas and the seasonal giving of gifts. Among these are [[Father Christmas]], also known as [[Santa Claus]] (derived from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for Saint Nicholas), Père Noël, and the [[Weihnachtsmann]]; [[Saint Nicholas]] or [[Sinterklaas]]; the [[Christkind]]; Kris Kringle; [[Joulupukki]]; Babbo Natale; [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil]]; and [[Ded Moroz|Father Frost]].

The best known of these figures today is red-dressed Santa Claus, of diverse origins. The name Santa Claus can be traced back to the Dutch ''Sinterklaas'', which means simply Saint Nicholas. Nicholas was Bishop of Myra, in modern-day Turkey, during the 4th century. Among other saintly attributes, he was noted for the care of children, generosity, and the giving of gifts. His feast on December 6 came to be celebrated in many countries with the giving of gifts.<ref name=ADS>Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', University of California Press, 2007, ISBN 0-520-25104-0, pp. 68–79.</ref>

Saint Nicholas traditionally appeared in bishop's attire, accompanied by helpers, inquiring about the behaviour of children during the past year before deciding whether they deserved a gift or not. By the 13th century, Saint Nicholas was well known in the Netherlands, and the practice of gift-giving in his name spread to other parts of central and southern Europe. At the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th–17th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or ''Christkindl'', corrupted in English to Kris Kringle, and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.<ref name="ADS"/>

The modern popular image of Santa Claus, however, was created in the United States, and in particular in New York. The transformation was accomplished with the aid of notable contributors including [[Washington Irving]] and the [[German American|German-American]] cartoonist [[Thomas Nast]] (1840–1902). Following the [[American Revolutionary War]], some of the inhabitants of New York City sought out symbols of the city's non-English past. New York had originally been established as the Dutch colonial town of [[New Amsterdam]] and the Dutch Sinterklaas tradition was reinvented as Saint Nicholas.<ref>{{cite web

In 1809, the [[New-York Historical Society]] convened and retroactively named ''Sancte Claus'' the patron saint of [[New Amsterdam|Nieuw Amsterdam]], the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name for [[New York City]].<ref>John Steele Gordon, ''The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power: 1653–2000'' (Scribner) 1999.</ref> At his first American appearance in 1810, Santa Claus was drawn in bishops' robes. However as new artists took over, Santa Claus developed more secular attire.<ref>Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', pp. 80–81.</ref> Nast drew a new image of "Santa Claus" annually, beginning in 1863. By the 1880s, Nast's Santa had evolved into the robed, fur clad, form we now recognize, perhaps based on the English figure of Father Christmas. The image was standardized by advertisers in the 1920s<ref name="Mikkelson">Mikkelson, Barbara and David P., [http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/santa.asp "The Claus That Refreshes"], ''Snopes.com,'' 2006.</ref> and continues through the present day: indeed, some have made a career out of portraying [[Santa Claus]], particularly if they are slightly overweight middle aged men with beards and a jolly disposition.<ref name=tws2NovV111>{{cite news

Father Christmas, a jolly, well nourished, bearded man who typified the spirit of good cheer at Christmas, predates the Santa Claus character. He is first recorded in early 17th century England, but was associated with holiday merrymaking and [[drunkenness]] rather than the bringing of gifts.<ref name=Harper/> In [[Victorian Britain]], his image was remade to match that of Santa. The French [[Père Noël]] evolved along similar lines, eventually adopting the Santa image. In Italy, Babbo Natale acts as Santa Claus, while [[La Befana]] is the bringer of gifts and arrives on the eve of the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]]. It is said that La Befana set out to bring the baby Jesus gifts, but got lost along the way. Now, she brings gifts to all children. In some cultures Santa Claus is accompanied by [[Knecht Ruprecht]], or [[Black Peter]]. In other versions, [[elf|elves]] make the toys. His wife is referred to as [[Mrs. Claus]].

Current tradition in several [[Latin American]] countries (such as [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]]) holds that while Santa makes the toys, he then gives them to the Baby Jesus, who is the one who actually delivers them to the children's homes, a reconciliation between traditional [[Religion|religious beliefs]] and the [[iconography]] of Santa Claus imported from the United States.

In [[South Tyrol]] (Italy), Austria, Czech Republic, Southern Germany, Hungary, [[Liechtenstein]], [[Slovakia]], and Switzerland, the [[Christkind]] ([[Ježíšek]] in Czech, Jézuska in Hungarian and Ježiško in Slovak) brings the presents. Greek children get their presents from [[Saint Basil]] on New Year's Eve, the eve of that saint's liturgical feast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skiathosbooks.com/saints_basil.htm |title=St. Basil (330–379) |publisher=Skiathosbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}</ref> The German St. Nikolaus is not identical with the Weihnachtsmann (who is the German version of Santa Claus / Father Christmas). St. Nikolaus wears a [[bishop]]'s dress and still brings small gifts (usually candies, nuts, and fruits) on December 6 and is accompanied by [[Knecht Ruprecht]]. Although many parents around the world routinely teach their children about Santa Claus and other gift bringers, some have come to reject this practice, considering it deceptive.<ref>Matera, Mariane.

The message is clear: Christmas is not about marking the actual birth date of Jesus.

In the early 4th century, the church calendar in Rome contained Christmas on December 25 and other holidays placed on solar dates. According to Hijmans<ref name="Hijmans">Hijmans, S.E., ''[http://www.scribd.com/doc/33490806/Hijmans-Sol-The-Sun-in-the-Art-and-Religions-of-Rome Sol, the sun in the art and religions of Rome],'' 2009, p. 595. ISBN 978-90-367-3931-3</ref> "It is cosmic symbolism...which inspired the Church leadership in Rome to elect the [[southern solstice]], December 25, as the birthday of Christ, and the [[northern solstice]] as that of John the Baptist, supplemented by the equinoxes as their respective dates of conception." Usener<ref>Hermann Usener, ''Das Weihnachtsfest'' (Part 1 of ''Religionsgeschichtliche Untersuchungen'', Second edition 1911; Verlag von Max Cohen & Sohn, Bonn.  (Note that the first edition, 1889, doesn't have the discussion of Natalis Solis Invicti); also ''Sol Invictus'' (1905).)</ref> and others<ref name="Christmas"/> proposed that the Christians chose this day because it was the Roman feast celebrating the birthday of Sol Invictus.  Modern scholar S. E. Hijmans, however, states that "While they were aware that pagans called this day the 'birthday' of Sol Invictus, this did not concern them and it did not play any role in their choice of date for Christmas."<ref name="Hijmans" />

Around the year 386 [[John Chrysostom]] delivered a sermon in [[Antioch]] in favour of adopting the 25 December celebration also in the East, since, he said, the conception of Jesus ({{bibleverse||Luke|1:26|31}}) had been announced during the sixth month of Elisabeth's pregnancy with John the Baptist ({{bibleverse||Luke|1:10-13|31}}), which he dated from the duties Zacharias performed on the [[Day of Atonement]] during the seventh month of the [[Hebrew calendar]] Ethanim or Tishri ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:29|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Kings|8:2|31}}) which falls from late September to early October.<ref name="CathChrit"/> That shepherds watched the flocks by night in the fields in the winter time is supported by the phrase "frost by night" in {{bibleverse||Genesis|31:38-40|31}}. A special group known as the shepherds of [[Migdal Eder (biblical location)|Migdal Eder]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|35:19-21|31}}, {{bibleverse||Micah|4:8|31}}) watched the flocks by night year round pastured for Temple Sacrifice near Bethlehem.<ref name="Gibson">Gibson, David J.

In the early 18th century, some scholars proposed alternative explanations. [[Isaac Newton]] argued that the date of Christmas, celebrating the birth of him whom Christians consider to be the "Sun of righteousness" prophesied in {{bibleverse||Malachi|4:2|31}},<ref name="Newton"/> was selected to correspond with the southern solstice, which the Romans called ''bruma'', celebrated on December 25.<ref name="SolsticeDate">"[http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/SF/WinSol.html Bruma]", ''Seasonal Festivals of the Greeks and Romans''<br />[[Pliny the Elder]], [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137&query=head%3D%231117 18:59]</ref> In 1743, German Protestant Paul Ernst Jablonski argued Christmas was placed on December 25 to correspond with the Roman solar holiday ''[[Dies Natalis Solis Invicti]]'' and was therefore a "paganization" that debased the true church.<ref name="SolInvictus"/> It has been argued that, on the contrary, the Emperor [[Aurelian]], who in 274 instituted the holiday of the ''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti'', did so partly as an attempt to give a pagan significance to a date already important for Christians in Rome.<ref>[http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=16-10-012-v William J.

==History==
The [[Chronography of 354|Chronography of 354 AD]] contains early evidence of the celebration on December 25 of a Christian liturgical feast of the birth of Jesus. This was in Rome, while in [[Eastern Christianity]] the birth of Jesus was already celebrated in connection with the [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]] on January 6.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=Wainwright+%22epiphany+is+older%22&btnG= |title=Geoffrey Wainwright, Karen Beth Westerfield Tucker (editors), '&#39;The Oxford History of Christian Worship'&#39; (Oxford University Press 2005 ISBN 978-0-19-513886-3), p. 65 |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}</ref><ref name=Roy>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=Roy+%22older+than+Christmas%22&btnG= |title=Christian Roy, '&#39;Traditional Festivals: A Multicultural Encyclopedia'&#39; (ABC-CLIO 2005 ISBN 978-1-57607-089-5) p. 146 |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}</ref> The December 25 celebration was imported into the East later: in Antioch by [[John Chrysostom]] towards the end of the 4th century,<ref name=Roy/> probably in 388, and in Alexandria only in the following century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=Hastings+%22been+between+400+and+432%22&btnG= |title=James Hastings, John A.

Many popular customs associated with Christmas developed independently of the commemoration of Jesus' birth, with certain elements having origins in pre-Christian festivals that were celebrated around the winter solstice by pagan populations who were later [[Christianization|converted to Christianity]]. These elements, including the [[Yule log]] from Yule and gift giving from [[Saturnalia]],<ref name="OriginMyth" /> became [[syncretism|syncretized]] into Christmas over the centuries.

===Relation to concurrent celebrations===
{{See also|List of winter festivals}}
Prior to and through the [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] centuries, winter festivals—especially those centered on the [[winter solstice]]—were the most popular of the year in many European pagan cultures. Reasons included the fact that less agricultural work needs to be done during the winter, as well as an expectation of better weather as spring approached.<ref name=AncientHoliday>"[http://www.history.com/minisites/christmas/viewPage?pageId=1252 "Christmas – An Ancient Holiday"], ''The [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'', 2007.</ref> Many modern Christmas customs have been directly influenced by such festivals, including gift-giving and merrymaking from the Roman [[Saturnalia]], greenery, lights, and charity from the Roman New Year, and [[Yule log]]s and various foods from [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] feasts.<ref>Coffman, Elesha. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/newsletter/2000/dec08.html Why December 25?] ''Christian History & Biography'', ''[[Christianity Today]]'', 2000.</ref>

[[Norse paganism|Pagan Scandinavia]] celebrated a winter festival called [[Yule]], held in the late December to early January period.<ref name="SIMEK379">Simek (2007:379).</ref> As [[northern Europe]] was the last part to Christianize, its pagan traditions had a major influence on Christmas there, an example being the [[Koleda]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages%5CK%5CO%5CKoliadaIT.htm |title=Koliada |publisher=Encyclopediaofukraine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-19}}</ref> which was incorporated into the [[Christmas carol]]. Scandinavians still call Christmas ''Jul''. In English, the word Yule is synonymous with Christmas,<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Yule Yule]. ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,'' Fourth Edition. Retrieved 2006-12-03.</ref> a usage first recorded in 900.

====''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti''====
{{Main|Sol Invictus}}
''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti'' means "the birthday of the unconquered sun". Some early Christian writers connected the sun to Jesus, who they believed was prophesied in {{bibleverse||Malachi|4:2}} as the "Sun of Righteousness" (''Sol Iustitiae''). In his work ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'', [[Irenaeus]] (c. 130–202), who was a hearer of [[Polycarp]],<ref>Eusebius of Caesarea, ''Ecclesiastical History'' Book v. Chapter v.</ref> a disciple of [[John the Apostle]],<ref name="Polycarp">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12219b.htm Polycarp], [[The Catholic Encyclopedia]], 1913.</ref> viewed the conception of Jesus as March 25 in association with the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], with the birth of Jesus nine months after on December 25.<ref name="Anderson"/> The conception of Jesus, known as the [[Annunication]], became associated with the "spring equinox" while Christmas was thought to coincide with the "winter solstice".<ref name="Anderson"/>  A later work by an anonymous author known as ''De Pasha Computus'' (243) associated the idea that creation began on 25 March (the first day of the week, Sunday) with the conception or birth of Jesus on 28 March, the day of the creation of the sun (the fourth day of the week, Wednesday). One translation reads: "O the splendid and divine providence of the Lord, that on that day, the very day, on which the sun was made, the 28 March, a Wednesday, Christ should be born. For this reason Malachi the prophet, speaking about him to the people, fittingly said, 'Unto you shall the sun of righteousness arise, and healing is in his wings.'"<ref name="CathChrit"/><ref name="Roll">[http://books.google.com/books?id=6MXPEMbpjoAC&pg=PA82&dq=Roll+%22appropriate+that+Christ%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-S_LUJ3LFc22hAeluIGADg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Roll%20%22appropriate%20that%20Christ%22&f=false Susan K.

Pfeiffer, 1896).</ref>

In the fourth century, [[John Chrysostom]], who promoted the celebration on 25 December, commented on the connection: "But Our Lord, too, is born in the month of December ... the eight before the calends of January [25 December] ..., But they call it the 'Birthday of the Unconquered'. Who indeed is so unconquered as Our Lord ...? Or, if they say that it is the birthday of the Sun, He is the Sun of Justice."<ref name="CathChrit"/> With regard to a December religious feast of the sun as a god (Sol), as distinct from a solstice feast of the (re)birth of the astronomical sun, some scholars have commented that, "while the winter solstice on or around December 25 was well established in the Roman imperial calendar, there is no evidence that a religious celebration of Sol on that day antedated the celebration of Christmas".<ref>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/33490806/Hijmans-Sol-The-Sun-in-the-Art-and-Religions-of-Rome S.E.

Christmas was promoted in the Christian East as part of the revival of [[Catholicism]] following the death of the pro-[[Arianism|Arian]] Emperor [[Valens]] at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378. The feast was introduced to [[Constantinople]] in 379, and to [[Antioch]] in about 380. The feast disappeared after [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] resigned as [[bishop]] in 381, although it was reintroduced by [[John Chrysostom]] in about 400.<ref name="CathChrit" />

===Middle Ages===
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], Christmas Day was overshadowed by Epiphany, which in [[western Christianity]] focused on the visit of the [[Biblical Magi|magi]]. But the medieval calendar was dominated by Christmas-related holidays. The forty days before Christmas became the "forty days of St. Martin" (which began on November 11, the feast of [[St. Martin of Tours]]), now known as Advent.<ref name="Murray" /> In Italy, former [[Saturnalia]]n traditions were attached to Advent.<ref name="Murray"/> Around the 12th century, these traditions transferred again to the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] (December 25 – January 5); a time that appears in the liturgical calendars as Christmastide or [[Twelve Holy Days]].<ref name="Murray"/>

The prominence of Christmas Day increased gradually after [[Charlemagne]] was crowned Emperor on Christmas Day in 800. King [[Edmund the Martyr]] was anointed on Christmas in 855 and King [[William I of England]] was crowned on Christmas Day 1066.

By the [[High Middle Ages]], the holiday had become so prominent that chroniclers routinely noted where various [[magnate]]s celebrated Christmas. [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]] of England hosted a Christmas feast in 1377 at which twenty-eight oxen and three hundred sheep were eaten.<ref name="Murray"/> The Yule boar was a common feature of medieval Christmas feasts. [[Christmas carol|Caroling]] also became popular, and was originally a group of dancers who sang. The group was composed of a lead singer and a ring of dancers that provided the chorus. Various writers of the time condemned caroling as lewd, indicating that the unruly traditions of Saturnalia and Yule may have continued in this form.<ref name="Murray"/> "Misrule"—drunkenness, promiscuity, gambling—was also an important aspect of the festival. In England, gifts were exchanged on [[New Year's Day]], and there was special Christmas ale.<ref name="Murray"/>

Christmas during the Middle Ages was a public festival that incorporated [[ivy]], [[holly]], and other evergreens.<ref name=mcgreevy/> Christmas [[gift-giving]] during the Middle Ages was usually between people with legal relationships, such as tenant and landlord.<ref name=mcgreevy>McGreevy, Patrick. "Place in the American Christmas," ([http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0016-7428%28199001%2980%3A1%3C32%3APITAC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-2 JSTOR]), ''Geographical Review'', Vol. 80, No. 1. January 1990, pp. 32–42. Retrieved 2007-09-10.</ref> The annual indulgence in eating, dancing, singing, sporting, and card playing escalated in England, and by the 17th century the Christmas season featured lavish dinners, elaborate masques, and pageants. In 1607, [[James I of England|King James I]] insisted that a play be acted on Christmas night and that the court indulge in games.<ref name=BTR/> It was during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th–17th-century Europe that many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or ''[[Christkindl]]'', and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.<ref name=ADS/>

Following the [[Protestant Reformation]], groups such as the [[Puritan]]s strongly condemned the celebration of Christmas, considering it a Catholic invention and the "trappings of [[Papist|popery]]" or the "rags of [[The Beast (Bible)|the Beast]]".<ref name="Durston" />
The [[Catholic Church]] responded by promoting the festival in a more religiously oriented form. King [[Charles I of England]] directed his noblemen and gentry to return to their landed estates in midwinter to keep up their old style Christmas generosity.<ref name=BTR/> Following the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] victory over Charles I during the [[English Civil War]], England's [[Puritan]] rulers banned Christmas in 1647.<ref name="Durston"/>

Protests followed as pro-Christmas rioting broke out in several cities and for weeks [[Canterbury]] was controlled by the rioters, who decorated doorways with [[holly]] and shouted [[Royalism|royalist]] slogans.<ref name="Durston"/> The book, ''The Vindication of Christmas'' (London, 1652), argued against the Puritans, and makes note of Old English Christmas traditions, dinner, roast apples on the fire, card playing, dances with "plow-boys" and "maidservants", and carol singing.<ref>{{cite web

The [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1660 ended the ban, but many clergymen still disapproved of Christmas celebration.

In [[Colonial America]], the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Puritans]] of [[New England]] shared radical Protestant disapproval of Christmas. Celebration was outlawed in [[Boston]] from 1659 to 1681. The ban by the Pilgrims was revoked in 1681 by English governor [[Sir Edmund Andros]], however it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became fashionable in the Boston region.<ref name="Bostonban" />

At the same time, Christian residents of [[Virginia]] and [[NY|New York]] observed the holiday freely.

In Britain, the [[Christmas tree#18th and 19th centuries|Christmas tree]] was introduced in the early 19th century following the personal union with the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] by [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], wife of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]].

In 1822, [[Clement Clarke Moore]] wrote the poem ''[[A Visit From St. Nicholas]]'' (popularly known by its first line: ''Twas the Night Before Christmas'').<ref>Moore's poem transferred the genuine old Dutch traditions celebrated at New Year in New York, including the exchange of gifts, family feasting, and tales of "sinterklass" (a derivation in Dutch from "Saint Nicholas", from whence comes the modern "Santa Claus") to Christmas.[http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/ch/in_america.htm ''The history of Christmas: Christmas history in America''], 2006

This also started the cultural conflict of the holiday's spiritualism and its [[commercialism]] that some see as corrupting the holiday.

While the celebration of Christmas was not yet customary in some regions in the U.S., [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] detected "a transition state about Christmas here in New England" in 1856.

In most Western nations, Christmas Day is the least active day of the year for business and commerce; almost all retail, commercial and institutional businesses are closed, and almost all industries cease activity (more than any other day of the year), whether laws require such or not. In [[England and Wales]], the [[Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004]] prevents all large shops from trading on Christmas Day. [[Scotland]] is currently planning similar legislation. [[Film studio]]s release many high-budget movies during the holiday season, including Christmas films, [[fantasy]] movies or high-tone dramas with high production values to hopes of maximizing the chance of nominations for the [[Academy Awards]].

One [[economist]]'s analysis calculates that, despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a [[deadweight loss]] under orthodox [[microeconomic theory]], because of the effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item. It is estimated that in 2001, Christmas resulted in a $4 billion deadweight loss in the U.S. alone.<ref name="Deadweight">"The Deadweight Loss of Christmas", ''American Economic Review'', December 1993, '''83''' (5)</ref><ref name="econ">[http://www.economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=885748 "Is Santa a deadweight loss?"] ''The Economist'' December 20, 2001</ref> Because of complicating factors, this analysis is sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory.
