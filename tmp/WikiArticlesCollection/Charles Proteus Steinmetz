'''Charles Proteus Steinmetz''' (April 9, 1865 – October 26, 1923) was a [[mathematician]] and [[electrical engineer]]. He fostered the development of [[alternating current]] that made possible the expansion of the [[electric power industry]] in the United States, formulating mathematical theories for engineers. He made ground-breaking discoveries in the understanding of [[hysteresis]] that enabled engineers to design better [[electrical machine|electromagnetic apparatus equipment]] including especially [[induction motor|electric motor]]s for use in industry.<ref>{{cite conference|url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/139.html|website=Invent Now, Inc.

Steinmetz suffered from [[dwarfism]], [[Kyphosis|hunchback]], and [[Hip dysplasia (human)|hip dysplasia]], as did his father and grandfather. Steinmetz attended Johannes [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] and astonished his teachers with his proficiency in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]].

==Early socialist==
[[File:Steinmetz Cabin.jpg|thumb|250px|Steinmetz  maintained a small cabin overlooking the [[Mohawk River]] near [[Schenectady, New York]].]]
Following the Gymnasium Steinmetz went on to the [[University of Breslau]] to begin work on his undergraduate degree in 1883. He was on the verge of finishing his doctorate in 1888 when he came under investigation by the German police for activities on behalf of a [[socialist]] university group and articles he had written for a local socialist newspaper, then a popular ideological pursuit among secular German Jews.

As socialist meetings and press had been banned in Germany, Steinmetz fled to [[Zürich]] in 1888 to escape possible arrest.  Faced with an expiring visa, he emigrated to the [[USA|United States]] in 1889. He changed his first name to Charles in order to sound more American and chose the middle name Proteus after a childhood taunt given to him by classmates. Proteus was a wise hunchbacked character from the Odyssey who knew many secrets and he felt it suited him.

[[Cornell University]] Professor Ronald R. Kline, the author of ''Steinmetz: Engineer and Socialist'', contends that other factors were more directly involved in Steinmetz's decision to leave his homeland, such as the fact that he was in arrears with his tuition at the University of Breslau and that life at home with his father, stepmother, and their daughters was full of tension.

Despite his earlier efforts and interest in socialism, by  1922 Steinmetz concluded that socialism would never work in the U.S. because the country lacked a "powerful, centralized government of competent men, remaining continuously in office" and because "only a small percentage of Americans accept this viewpoint today." <ref name="UC Mag (1998)">{{cite journal|title=Charles Steinmetz: Union's Electrical Wizard|journal=Union College Magazine|date=November 1, 1998|url=http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=1512|accessdate=May 31, 2009}}</ref>

==Engineering wizard==

Steinmetz is known for his contribution in three major fields of [[alternating current|alternating current (AC)]] systems theory: [[magnetic hysteresis|hysteresis]], [[steady state (electronics)|steady-state]] analysis, and [[transient (oscillation)|transients]].

===AC hysteresis theory===
Shortly after arriving in the U.S., Steinmetz went to work for Rudolf Eickemeyer in [[Yonkers, New York]], and published in the field of magnetic hysteresis, which gave him world-wide professional recognition.<ref name="IEEEPER (1996)">{{cite journal|title=The Magnetic Force of Charles Proteus Steinmetz|journal=IEEE Power Engineering Review|year=1996|month=Feb.|volume=16|issue=9|pages=7|doi=10.1109/MPER.1996.535476|accessdate=7 February 2013|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535476&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&queryText%3DCharles+Proteus+Steinmetz+history}}</ref>  Eickemeyer's firm developed [[transformer]]s for use in the [[electric power transmission|transmission of electrical power]] among many other mechanical and electrical devices. In 1893 Eickemeyer's company, along with all of its patents and designs, was bought by the newly formed [[General Electric]] Company, where he quickly became known as the engineering wizard in GE's engineering community.<ref name="IEEEPER (1996)"/>

===AC steady state circuit theory===
Steinmetz's work revolutionized [[alternating current|AC]] [[circuit theory|circuit theory and analysis]], which had been carried out using complex, time-consuming calculus-based methods. By  1893, Steinmetz simplified these complicated methods to "a simple problem of algebra". He was the first to use [[complex number]] [[phasor]] representation, whereby the letter j is used to designate the 90 degree [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] operator in AC system analysis.<ref name="Alger (1976)"/> His seminal books and many [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] papers "taught a whole generation of engineers how to deal with AC phenomena.<ref name="Alger (1976)"/><ref name="ZSE (nodate)">{{cite web|title=Steinmetz, Putting it in Perspective - R, L, and C Elements and the Impedance Concept|url=http://zrno.fsb.hr/katedra/download/materijali/966.pdf|publisher=Zabreb School of Engineering|accessdate=21 December 2012}}</ref>

===AC transient theory===
Steinmetz also made greater strides to the understanding of [[lightning]] phenomena.  He undertook a systematic study of it, resulting in experiments of man-made lightning in the laboratory; this work was published. Steinmetz was called the "forger of [[thunderbolts]]," being the first to create artificial lightning in his GE football field-sized laboratory and high towers, using 120,000 [[voltage|volt]] generators. He erected a lightning tower to attract lightning and studied the patterns and effects of lightning resulting in several theories and ideas.

==Professional and personal aspects==
Steinmetz served as president of the [[Board of Education]] of Schenectady, and as president of the Schenectady [[City Council]]. He was president of the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (AIEE) from 1901 to 1902,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Charles_Proteus_Steinmetz |title=Charles Proteus Steinmetz |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref> as well as the first vice-president of the International Association of Municipal Electricians (IAME)—which later became the [[International Municipal Signal Association]] (IMSA)—from 1913 until his death. Steinmetz wrote 13 books and 60 articles, not all about engineering. He was an honorary member and advisor to the fraternity [[Phi Gamma Delta]] at Union (whose chapter house there was one of the first electrified houses ever). 

On Steinmetz's views on God, he was an agnostic.<ref name="Hammond (1924)">{{cite book|title=Charles Proteus Steinmetz: A biography|year=1924|publisher=The Century & Co.|first=John Winthrop |last=Hammond|accessdate=21 August 2012|page=447}}</ref>{{efn|Quoting from Hammond, "This has placed him before the public as an atheist.* The title he did not deny. The writer, however, would put him down as a confirmed agnostic, for an atheist is a person who knows there is no God, and Steinmetz was not of that..."<ref name="Hammond (1924)"/>}} 

Steinmetz died on October 26, 1923 and was buried in [[Vale Cemetery]], [[Schenectady]].

==Legacy==
[[File:Albert Einstein with other engineers and scientists at Marconi RCA radio station 1921.jpg|thumb|250px|Marconi Wireless Station in Somerset, New Jersey in 1921. Steinmetz is at centre; he died two years later.]]
His connection to Union College is celebrated with the annual Steinmetz Symposium,<ref name="UC SteinmetzSym">{{cite web|title=Union College Steinmetz Symposium|url=http://www.union.edu/academic/beyond/research/steinmetz/}}</ref>  a day-long event in which Union undergraduates give presentations on research they have done. Steinmetz Hall, which houses the [[Union College]] computer center, is named after him.

Steinmetz was portrayed in 1959 by the [[actor]] [[Rod Steiger]] in the [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] [[anthology series]], ''[[The Joseph Cotten Show]]''. The episode centered on his socialist activities in Germany.

A [[Charles P. Steinmetz Academic Centre|Chicago Public High School]] is named for him.

A public park in north Schenectady, New York was named for him in 1931.<ref name="Steinmetz Park Association (2006)">{{cite web|last=Steinmetz Park Association (2006)|title=Steinmetz Park Master Plan|url=http://www.cityofschenectady.com/pdf/development/Steinmetz_Park_Masterplan_2006_Final_Web.pdf|accessdate=January 22, 2013|location=Schenectady, N.Y.|page=3}}</ref>

Based on Steinmetz experiments, ''Steinmetz' formula'' defines the approximate heat energy due to magnetic hysteresis released per cycle per unit area of magnetic material.{{efn|<math>W_h=\eta\Beta^{k}_{max}</math>, where η is hysteresis coefficient, β<sub>max</sub> is maximum flux density and k is an empirical exponent.}}<ref name="Knowlton (1949)">{{cite book|last=Knowlton|first=A.
