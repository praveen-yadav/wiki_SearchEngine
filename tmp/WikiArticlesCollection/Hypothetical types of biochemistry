<!--Although they may be hypothetical, references (to scientific hypotheses) are always required.-->
'''Hypothetical types of biochemistry''' are forms of [[biochemistry]] speculated to be scientifically viable but not proven to exist at this time. While the kinds of [[life on Earth|living beings currently known on Earth]] commonly use [[carbon]] for basic structural and [[metabolism|metabolic]] functions, [[water]] as a [[solvent]] and [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] to define and control their form, it may be possible that undiscovered life-forms could exist that differ radically in their basic structures and biochemistry from that known to science.

The possibility of [[extraterrestrial life]] being based on these "alternative" biochemistries is a common subject in [[science fiction]], but is also discussed in a non-fiction scientific context.

==Earth as a possible habitat==
Apart from the prospect of finding different forms of life on other planets or moons,
Earth itself has been suggested as a place where a [[shadow biosphere]] of biochemically unfamiliar micro-organisms might have lived in the past, or may still exist today.<ref>Davies, P. C. W. , Benner, S.A., Cleland, C.E., Lineweaver,C.H., McKay,C.P. and Wolfe-Simon,F.

==Alternative-chirality biomolecules==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Perhaps the least unusual alternative biochemistry would be one with differing [[Left-handed protein|chirality]] of its biomolecules. In known Earth-based life, [[amino acid]]s are almost universally of the <small>L</small> form and [[sugar]]s are of the <small>D</small> form. Molecules of opposite chirality have identical chemical properties to their mirrored forms, so life that used <small>D</small> amino acids or <small>L</small> sugars may be possible; molecules of such a chirality, however, would be incompatible with organisms using the opposing chirality molecules. It is questionable, however, whether such a biochemistry would be truly alien; while it is certainly an alternative [[stereochemistry]], molecules that are overwhelmingly found in one [[enantiomer]] throughout the vast majority of organisms can nonetheless often be found in another enantiomer in different (often [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]]) organisms such as in comparisons between members of [[Archea]] and other [[Domain (biology)|domains]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} making it an open topic whether an alternative stereochemistry is truly novel.

==Non-carbon-based biochemistries==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
On Earth, all living things have a molecular machinery of carbon compounds. Scientists have speculated about the pros and cons of using [[atom]]s other than carbon to form the molecular structures necessary for life, but no one has proposed a theory employing such atoms to form all the necessary structures. However, as Carl Sagan argued, it is very difficult to be certain whether a statement that applies to all life on Earth will turn out to apply to all life throughout the universe.<ref>{{cite book| title=Carl Sagan's Cosmic Connection: an Extraterrestrial Perspective| first=Carl| last= Sagan|first2=Jerome|last2=Agel|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge U.P.| year=2000|isbn=0521783038, 9780521783033|page=41}}</ref> Sagan used the term "[[carbon chauvinism]]" for such an assumption.<ref name="Sagan 2000page=46 46">{{cite book| title=Carl Sagan's Cosmic Connection: an Extraterrestrial Perspective| first=Carl| last= Sagan|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge U.P.| year=2000 |page=46}}</ref> Carl Sagan regarded [[silicon]] and [[germanium]] as conceivable alternatives to carbon;<ref name="Sagan 2000page=46 46"/> but, on the other hand, he noted that carbon does seem more chemically versatile and is more abundant in the cosmos.<ref>{{cite book| title=Carl Sagan's Cosmic Connection: an Extraterrestrial Perspective| first=Carl| last= Sagan|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge U.P.| year=2000page=47}}</ref>

===Silicon biochemistry===
[[Image:Silane.png|thumb|right|250px|The structure of [[silane]], the silicon-based analogue of [[methane]].]]
{{see also|Organosilicon}}
The most commonly proposed basis for an alternative biochemical system is the silicon atom, because silicon has many [[chemical property|chemical properties]] similar to those of carbon and is in the same [[group (periodic table)|group of the periodic table]], the [[carbon group]]. Like carbon, silicon can create molecules that are sufficiently large to carry biological information.<ref name="Pace">{{cite journal|last1 = Pace|first1 = NR|title = The universal nature of biochemistry|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/98/3/805.full.pdf| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume = 98|issue = 3|pages = 805–8|year = 2001 |pmid = 11158550|pmc = 33372|doi = 10.1073/pnas.98.3.805|bibcode=2001PNAS...98..805P}}</ref>

However, silicon has several drawbacks as an alternative to carbon. Silicon, unlike carbon, lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms as is necessary for the chemical versatility required for metabolism. Elements creating organic functional groups with carbon include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and metals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. Silicon, on the other hand, interacts with very few other types of atoms.<ref name="Pace"/> Moreover, where it does interact with other atoms, silicon creates molecules that have been described as "monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules".<ref name="Pace"/> This is because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger [[mass]] and [[atomic radius]], and so have difficulty forming double bonds (the double bonded carbon is part of the [[carbonyl]] group, a fundamental motif of bio-organic chemistry).

[[Silanes]], which are [[chemical compound]]s of [[hydrogen]] and silicon that are analogous to the [[alkane]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, are highly reactive with [[water (molecule)|water]], and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Molecules incorporating [[polymer]]s of alternating silicon and [[oxygen]] atoms instead of direct bonds between silicon, known collectively as [[silicone]]s, are much more stable. It has been suggested that silicone-based chemicals would be more stable than equivalent hydrocarbons in a sulfuric-acid-rich environment, as is found in some extraterrestrial locations.<ref name="world-building">{{cite book|first=Stephen|last=Gillette| title=World-Building|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=0-89879-707-1}}</ref> Complex long-chain silicone molecules are still less stable than their carbon counterparts, though.

Another obstacle is that [[silicon dioxide]] (a common ingredient of many sands), the analog of [[carbon dioxide]], is an in[[soluble]] solid at the temperature range where water is liquid, making it difficult for silicon to be introduced into water-based biochemical systems even if the necessary range of biochemical molecules could be constructed out of it. Another problem with silicon dioxide is that it would be the product of aerobic respiration. If a silicon-based life form were to breathe using oxygen, as life on Earth does, it would possibly produce silicon dioxide as a [[by-product]] of this, assuming that the only difference between the two types of life is silicon in place of carbon. This implies that the exhaled product, silicon dioxide, would be a solid, thus filling the respiratory organs of the organism with sand. This however would be solved if the organism lives in temperatures of several hundred to thousand degrees, where the silicon dioxide becomes a liquid. Oxygen-breathing silicon life, if it exists, is therefore most likely to exist in environments with very high temperatures or pressure.

Finally, of the varieties of molecules identified in the [[interstellar medium]] {{As of|1998|lc=on}}, 84 are based on carbon while only 8 are based on silicon.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part6/section-16.html| title= F.10 Why do we assume that other beings must be based on carbon? Why couldn't organisms be based on other substances?| work=[sci.astro] ET Life (Astronomy Frequently Asked Questions)| accessdate=2006-07-21| first=Joseph| last=Lazio}}</ref> Moreover, of those 8 compounds, four also include carbon within them. The cosmic abundance of carbon to silicon is roughly 10 to 1. This may suggest a greater variety of complex carbon compounds throughout the cosmos, providing less of a foundation upon which to build silicon-based biologies, at least under the conditions prevalent on the surface of planets. Somewhat in support, in September 2012, [[NASA|NASA scientists]] reported that [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons|polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)]], subjected to interstellar-medium conditions, are transformed, through [[hydrogenation]], [[Oxygenate|oxygenation]] and [[hydroxylation]], to more complex [[Organic compound|organics]] - "a step along the path toward [[amino acids]] and [[nucleotides]], the raw materials of [[proteins]] and DNA, respectively".<ref name="Space-20120920">{{cite web |author=Staff |title=NASA Cooks Up Icy Organics to Mimic Life's Origins|url=http://www.space.com/17681-life-building-blocks-nasa-organic-molecules.html|date=September 20, 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=September 22, 2012 }}</ref><ref name="AJL-20120901">{{cite journal |last1=Gudipati |first1=Murthy S. |last2=Yang |first2=Rui|title=In-Situ Probing Of Radiation-Induced Processing Of Organics In Astrophysical Ice Analogs—Novel Laser Desorption Laser Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopic Studies|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/756/1/L24 |date=September 1, 2012 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |volume=756 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/756/1/L24|accessdate=September 22, 2012 |bibcode = 2012ApJ...756L..24G |issue=1 |pages=L24 }}</ref> (Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic signature]] which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in [[interstellar ice]] [[Cosmic_dust#Dust_grain_formation|grains]], particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of [[protoplanetary disks]]."<ref name="Space-20120920" /><ref name="AJL-20120901" />)

Also, even though [[Earth]] and other [[terrestrial planet]]s are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (the relative abundance of silicon to carbon in the Earth's crust is roughly 925:1<ref>{{cite web
 | url = http://www.webelements.com/webelements/properties/text/image-flash/abund-crust.html
 | title = Abundance in Earth's Crust
 | publisher = WebElements.com
 | accessdate = 2007-04-14}}</ref>), terrestrial life is carbon-based. The fact that carbon, though rare, has proven to be much more successful as a life base than the much more abundant silicon, may be evidence that silicon is poorly suited for biochemistry on Earth-like planets. For example: silicon is less versatile than carbon in forming compounds; the compounds formed by silicon are unstable and it blocks the flow of heat.<ref name=BC>{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 2011-01-17 | date = September 26, 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet}}</ref> Even so, [[biogenic silica]] is used by some Earth life, such as the silicate skeletal structure of [[diatom]]s. This suggests that extraterrestrial life forms may have silicon-based structure molecules and carbon-based proteins for metabolic purposes, therefore enabling the ability to feed on a common resource on a terrestrial planet like Earth for building up the silicon-based part of their body.

Silicon compounds may possibly be biologically useful under temperatures or pressures different from the surface of a terrestrial planet, either in conjunction with or in a role less directly analogous to carbon.

[[Graham Cairns-Smith|A. G. Cairns-Smith]] has proposed that the first living organisms to exist on Earth were clay minerals—which were probably based on silicon.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Cairns-Smith| first=A. Graham| title= Seven Clues to the Origin of Life| location= Cambridge| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1985| isbn=0-521-27522-9}}</ref>

In cinematic and literary science fiction, a moment when man-made machines cross from nonliving to living, it is often posited, this new form would be the first example of non-carbon-based life. Since the advent of the [[microprocessor]] in the late 1960s, these machines are often classed as [[computer]]s (or computer-guided [[robot]]s) and filed under "silicon-based life", even though the silicon backing matrix of these processors is not nearly as fundamental to their operation as carbon is for "wet life".

===Other exotic element-based biochemistries===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}

* [[Boron]]'s chemistry is possibly even more variable than that of carbon, since it has the ability to form polyhedral clusters and [[three-center two-electron bond]]s. [[Boranes]] are dangerously explosive in Earth's atmosphere, but would be more stable in a reducing environment. However, boron's low cosmic abundance makes it less likely as a base for life than carbon.
* Various metals, together with oxygen, can form very complex and thermally stable structures rivaling those of organic compounds; the [[heteropoly acid]]s are one such family. Some metal oxides are also similar to carbon in their ability to form both nanotube structures and diamond-like crystals (such as [[cubic zirconia]]). [[Titanium]], [[aluminium]], [[magnesium]], and [[iron]] are all more abundant in the Earth's crust than carbon. Metal-oxide-based life could therefore be a possibility under certain conditions, including those (such as high temperatures) at which carbon-based life would be unlikely.
* [[Sulfur]] is also able to form long-chain molecules, but suffers from the same high-reactivity problems as phosphorus and silanes. The biological use of sulfur as an alternative to carbon is purely theoretical, especially because sulfur usually forms only linear chains rather than branched ones. (The biological use of sulfur as an electron acceptor is widespread and can be traced back 3.5&nbsp;billion years on Earth, thus predating the use of molecular oxygen.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/317/5844/1534 Early Archaean Microorganisms Preferred Elemental Sulfur, Not Sulfate] Science AAAS, by Philippot, et al., (14 September 2007)</ref> [[Sulfur-reducing bacteria]] can utilize elemental sulfur instead of oxygen, reducing sulfur to [[hydrogen sulfide]].)

==Chlorine as an alternative to oxygen==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
A number of [[Anaerobic respiration|alternatives to molecular oxygen]] as a terminal electron acceptor are known from [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic life forms]] on Earth. However, it has been proposed that [[chlorine]] might serve as a more general biological alternative to oxygen,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} either in carbon-based biologies or hypothetical non-carbon-based ones. But chlorine is much less abundant than oxygen in the universe, and so planets with a sufficiently chlorine-rich atmosphere are likely to be rare, if they exist at all. Chlorine will, instead, likely be bound up as [[salt]]s and other inert compounds.

==Arsenic as an alternative to phosphorus==
{{further|GFAJ-1}}

[[Arsenic]], which is chemically similar to [[phosphorus]], while poisonous for most [[organism|life form]]s on Earth, is incorporated into the biochemistry of some organisms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://umbbd.msi.umn.edu/periodic/elements/as.html |title=Biochemical Periodic Table – Arsenic |publisher=Umbbd.msi.umn.edu |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2010-05-29}}</ref> Some [[marine algae]] incorporate arsenic into complex organic molecules such as [[arsenosugar]]s and [[arsenobetaine]]s.

==Selenium or tellurium as an alternative to protein sulfur==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
[[Selenoproteins]], in which sulfur is replaced by selenium, are found in all major forms of life, and are essential to many of them. All [[methionine]]s in bacterial cells can be replaced by selenomethionines - this technique is commonly used when analyzing protein structures via [[X-ray crystallography]]. Some fungi can substitute [[tellurium#Biological role|tellurium]] for sulfur and selenium in their amino acids.

==Non-water solvents==

In addition to carbon compounds, all currently known terrestrial life also requires water as a solvent. This has led to discussions about whether water is the only liquid capable of filling that role. The idea that an extraterrestrial life-form might be based on a solvent other than water has been taken seriously in recent scientific literature by the biochemist [[Steven Benner]],<ref>

Some of the properties of water that are important for life processes include a large temperature range over which it is [[liquid phase|liquid]], a high [[heat capacity]] (useful for temperature regulation), a large [[heat of vaporization]], and the ability to dissolve a wide variety of compounds. Water is also [[amphoteric]], meaning it can donate and accept an [[hydrogen ion|H<sup>+</sup> ion]], allowing it to act as an acid or a base. This property is crucial in many organic and biochemical reactions, where water serves as a solvent, a reactant, or a product. There are other chemicals with similar properties that have sometimes been proposed as alternatives. Additionally, water has the unusual property of being less dense as a solid (ice) than as a liquid. This is why bodies of water freeze over but do not freeze solid (from the bottom up). If ice were denser than liquid water (as is true for nearly all other compounds), then large bodies of liquid would slowly freeze solid, which would not be conducive to the formation of life.

Not all properties of water are necessarily advantageous for life, however.<ref name="barosswater">Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&page=70 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 70</ref> For instance, water ice has a high [[albedo]],<ref name="barosswater"/> meaning that it reflects a significant quantity of light and heat from the Sun. During [[ice age]]s, as reflective ice builds up over the surface of the water, the effects of global cooling are increased.<ref name="barosswater"/>

There are some properties that make certain compounds and elements much more favorable than others as solvents in a successful biosphere. The solvent must be able to exist in liquid equilibrium over a range of temperatures the planetary object would normally encounter. Because boiling points vary with the pressure, the question tends not to be ''does'' the prospective solvent remain liquid, but ''at what pressure''. For example, [[hydrogen cyanide]] has a narrow liquid phase temperature range at 1 atmosphere, but in an atmosphere with the pressure of [[Venus]], with {{convert|92|bar|MPa}} of pressure, it can indeed exist in liquid form over a wide temperature range.

===Ammonia===
[[File:Ammonia World.jpg|320px|thumb|right|Artist's conception of how a planet with ammonia-based life may look.]]
The ammonia molecule (NH<sub>3</sub>), like the water molecule, is abundant in the universe, being a compound of hydrogen (the simplest and most common element) with another very common element, nitrogen.<ref name="asimov"/> The possible role of liquid ammonia as an alternative solvent for life is an idea that goes back at least to 1954, when J.B.S. Haldane raised the topic at a symposium about life's origin.<ref name="haldane"/>

Numerous chemical reactions are possible in an ammonia solution, and liquid ammonia has chemical similarities with water.<ref name="asimov"/><ref name="ddammonia">{{cite web | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html | title = ammonia-based life | accessdate = 2012-10-01 | last = Darling | first = David}}</ref> Ammonia can dissolve most organic molecules at least as well as water does and, in addition, it is capable of dissolving many elemental metals. Haldane made the point that various common water-related organic compounds have ammonia-related analogs; for instance the ammonia-related [[amine]] group (-NH<sub>2</sub>) is analogous to the water-related [[alcohol]] group (-OH).<ref name="ddammonia"/>

Ammonia, like water, can either accept or donate an H<sup>+</sup> ion. When ammonia accepts an H<sup>+</sup>, it forms the [[ammonium]] cation (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), analogous to [[hydronium]] (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>). When it donates an H<sup>+</sup> ion, it forms the [[metal amides|amide]] anion (NH<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>), analogous to the [[hydroxide]] anion (OH<sup>−</sup>).<ref name="barossammonia"/> Compared to water, however, ammonia is more inclined to accept an H<sup>+</sup> ion, and less inclined to donate one; it is a stronger [[nucleophile]].<ref name="barossammonia"/> Ammonia added to water functions as [[Arrhenius base]]: it increases the concentration of the anion hydroxide. Conversely, using a [[Acid-base reaction#Solvent system definition|solvent system definition]] of acidity and basicity, water added to liquid ammonia functions as an acid, because it increases the concentration of the cation ammonium.<ref name="ddammonia"/> The carbonyl group (C=O), which is much used in terrestrial biochemistry, would not be stable in ammonia solution, but the analogous [[imine]] group (C=N) could be used instead.<ref name="barossammonia"/>

However, ammonia has some problems as a basis for life. The [[hydrogen bonds]] between ammonia molecules are weaker than those in water, causing ammonia's [[heat of vaporization]] to be half that of water, its [[surface tension]] to be a third, and reducing its ability to concentrate non-polar molecules through a [[hydrophobic]] effect. Gerald Feinberg and Robert Shapiro have questioned whether ammonia could hold prebiotic molecules together well enough to allow the emergence of a self-reproducing system.<ref>{{cite book| title=Life Beyond Earth| first=Gerald| last= Feinberg|coauthors=Robert Shapiro|publisher=Morrow| year=1980|isbn=0688036422, 9780688036423}} cited in {{cite web | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html/ | title = ammonia-based life | accessdate = 2012-10-01 | last = Darling | first = David}}</ref> Ammonia is also flammable in oxygen, and could not exist sustainably in an environment suitable for [[aerobic metabolism]].<ref name="dsmammonia">{{cite book| title=Life in the Universe: Expectations and Constraints| first=Dirk | last= Schulze-Makuch|first2=Louis Neal|last2=Irwin|publisher=Springer| edition=2| year=2008|isbn=3540768165, 9783540768166|page=119}}</ref>

[[File:Layers of titan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Titan's theorized internal structure, subsurface ocean shown blue.]]
A [[biosphere]] based on ammonia would likely exist at temperatures or air pressures that are extremely unusual in relation to life on Earth. Life on Earth usually exists within the melting point and [[boiling point]] of water at [[normal pressure]], between 0&nbsp;°C (273&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]) and 100&nbsp;°C (373&nbsp;K); at normal pressure ammonia's melting and boiling points are between −78&nbsp;°C (195&nbsp;K) and −33&nbsp;°C (240&nbsp;K). Chemical reactions generally proceed more slowly at a lower temperature, therefore liquid-ammonia life, if it exists, might metabolize more slowly and evolve more slowly than life on Earth.<ref name="dsmammonia"/> On the other hand, lower temperatures could also enable living systems to use chemical species which at Earth temperatures would be too unstable to be useful.<ref name="asimov"/>

Ammonia could be a liquid at Earth-like temperatures, but at much higher pressures; for example, at 60 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]], ammonia melts at −77&nbsp;°C (196&nbsp;K) and boils at 98&nbsp;°C (371&nbsp;K).<ref name="barossammonia"/>

Ammonia and ammonia–water mixtures remain liquid at temperatures far below the freezing point of pure water, so such biochemistries might be well suited to planets and moons orbiting outside the water-based [[habitability zone]]. Such conditions could exist, for example, under the surface of [[Saturn]]'s largest moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk/research/planetary/undergraduate/dom/titan/titan.htm|title=Exobiological Implications of a Possible Ammonia-Water Ocean Inside Titan|last=Fortes|first=A.

===Methane and other hydrocarbons===

Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) is a simple hydrocarbon: that is, a compound of two of the most common elements in the cosmos, hydrogen and carbon. It has a cosmic abundance comparable with ammonia.<ref name="asimov"/> Hydrocarbons could act as a solvent over a wide range of temperatures, but would lack [[chemical polarity|polarity]]. Isaac Asimov, the [[biochemist]] and science fiction writer, suggested in 1981 that poly-[[lipids]] could form a substitute for proteins in a non-polar solvent such as methane.<ref name="asimov"/> Lakes composed of a mixture of hydrocarbons, including methane and [[ethane]], have been detected on Titan by the [[Cassini mission|Cassini spacecraft]].

[[File:PIA10008 Seas and Lakes on Titan.jpg|thumb|Titan's surface lakes of liquid methane and ethane. False-color ''Cassini'' radar mosaic of Titan's north polar region. Blue coloring indicates low radar reflectivity, caused by the lakes.]]
There is debate about the effectiveness of methane and other hydrocarbons as a medium for life compared to water or ammonia.<ref name="methanesolvent">Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&page=74 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 74.</ref> Water is a stronger solvent than the hydrocarbons, enabling easier transport of substances in a cell.<ref name=methlife>{{cite web|title= What is Consuming Hydrogen and Acetylene on Titan?|publisher=NASA/JPL|year=2010 |accessdate=2010-06-06|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-190}}</ref> However, water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis.<ref name=methanesolvent/> A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the threat of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.<ref name=methanesolvent/> Also, the water molecule's tendency to form strong hydrogen bonds can interfere with internal hydrogen bonding in complex organic molecules.<ref name="barosswater"/> Life with a hydrocarbon solvent could make more use of hydrogen bonds within its biomolecules.<ref name="methanesolvent"/> Moreover, the strength of hydrogen bonds within biomolecules would be appropriate to a low temperature biochemistry.<ref name="methanesolvent"/>

Astrobiologist [[Christopher McKay (planetary scientist)|Chris McKay]] has argued, on thermodynamic grounds, that if life does exist on Titan's surface, using hydrocarbons as a solvent, it is likely also to use the more complex hydrocarbons as an energy source by reacting them with hydrogen, [[redox|reducing]] ethane and [[acetylene]] to methane.<ref name="mckay">{{cite journal| journal = Icarus|volume= 178| issue = 1|pages = 274–276|year= 2005|doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2005.05.018| title = Possibilities for methanogenic life in liquid methane on the surface of Titan|author = McKay, C.

===Hydrogen fluoride===

[[Hydrogen fluoride]] (HF), like water, is a polar molecule, and due to its polarity it can dissolve many ionic compounds. Its melting point is −84&nbsp;°C and its boiling point is 19.54&nbsp;°C (at [[atmospheric pressure]]); the difference between the two is a little more than 100 K. HF also makes hydrogen bonds with its neighbor molecules, as do water and ammonia. It has been considered as a possible solvent for life by scientists such as Peter Sneath<ref name="sneath"/> and Carl Sagan.<ref name="Sagan, Carl 2002 128"/>

The biota in an HF ocean could use the [[fluorine]] as an electron acceptor to photosynthesize energy. HF is dangerous to the systems of molecules that Earth-life is made of, but certain other organic compounds, such as [[paraffin wax]]es, are stable with it.<ref name="Sagan, Carl 2002 128"/> Like water and ammonia, liquid hydrogen fluoride supports an acid-base chemistry. Using a solvent system definition of acidity and basicity, [[nitric acid]] functions as a base when it is added to liquid HF.<ref>{{cite book| title=Chemistry in Nonaqueous Ionizing solvents: Inorganic Chemistry in Liquid Hydrogen Cyanide and Liquid hydrogen Fluoride| first=Gerhart| last= Jander| first2=Hans| last2= Spandau| first3=C.C.|last3=Addison|publisher=Pergamon Press| location=N.Y.| year=1971|volume=II}} cited in {{cite book| title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization| first=Robert A.| last= Freitas| publisher=Xenology Research Institute| location=Sacramento, CA| year=1979|chapter=8.2.2|url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/8.2.2.htm}}</ref>

==Other types of speculations==

===Non-green photosynthesizers===
Physicists have noted that, although photosynthesis on Earth generally involves green plants, a variety of other-colored plants could also support photosynthesis, essential for most life on Earth, and that other colors might be preferred in places that receive a different mix of stellar radiation than Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2007/spectrum_plants.html |title=NASA – NASA Predicts Non-Green Plants on Other Planets |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2008-02-23 |accessdate=2010-05-29}}</ref><ref name = "Kiang">{{Cite journal

These conclusions are, in part, based on the luminosity spectra of different types of stars, the transmission characteristics of hypothetical planetary atmospheres, and the absorption spectra of various [[photosynthetic pigment]]s from organisms on Earth.

===Alternative atmospheres===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
<!--References that that describe our atmosphere are not suficient and do not support the exposed "Alternative atmospheres".-->
The gases present in the atmosphere on Earth have varied greatly over its history. Traditional plant photosynthesis transformed the atmosphere by sequestering carbon from carbon dioxide, increasing the proportion of molecular oxygen, and by participating in the [[nitrogen cycle]]. Modern oxygen-breathing animals would have been biochemically impossible until earlier photosynthetic life transformed Earth's atmosphere. The first dramatic rise in atmospheric oxygen on Earth, to about a tenth of its present-day value, occurred approximately 2.5 billion years ago, and that level did not change significantly until the Cambrian era approximately 600 million years ago.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Jones| first=Barrie W.| title= The Search for Life Continued: Planets Around Other Stars| location= Chichester, UK| publisher=Praxis Publishing| year=2008| isbn= 978-0-387-76557-0| page=68}}</ref>

Changes in the gas mixture in the atmosphere, even in an atmosphere made up predominantly of the same molecules of Earth's atmosphere, impacts the biochemistry and morphology of life. For example, periods of high oxygen concentrations (determined from ice core samples) have been associated with larger fauna in the fossil record, whereas periods of low oxygen concentrations have been associated with smaller fauna in the fossil record.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/309/5744/2202 |title=The Rise of Oxygen over the Past 205 Million Years and the Evolution of Large Placental Mammals|date=30 September 2005 |doi=10.1126/science.1116047 |journal = Science |accessdate=2010-05-29 | volume = 309|issue=5744|pmid=16195457|last1=Falkowski|first1=P.

Also, although it is customary to think of plants on one side of the oxygen and nitrogen cycles as being [[sessility (zoology)|sessile]], and of animals on the other side as being [[Motility|motile]], this is not a biological imperative{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}. There are animals that are sessile for all or most of their lives (such as [[corals]]), and there are plants (such as [[tumbleweed]]s, and [[venus fly trap]]s) that exhibit more mobility than is customarily associated with plants. On a slowly rotating planet, for example, it might be adaptive for photosynthesis to be performed by "plants" that can move to remain in the light,{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} like Earth's [[sunflower]]s; whereas non-photosynthetic "animals", much like Earth's fungi, might have a lesser need to move from place to place on their own. This would be a mirror image of Earth's [[ecology]].

===Variable environments===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
Many Earth plants and animals undergo major biochemical changes during their life cycles as a response to changing environmental conditions, for example, by having a [[spore]] or [[hibernation]] state that can be sustained for years or even millennia between more active life stages. Thus, it would be biochemically possible to sustain life in environments that are only periodically consistent with life as we know it.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

For example, frogs in cold climates can survive for extended periods of time with most of their body water in a frozen state,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/yellowstone/hibernate.html |title=Christmas in Yellowstone |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}</ref> whereas desert frogs in Australia can become inactive and dehydrate in dry periods, losing up to 75% of their fluids, yet return to life by rapidly rehydrating in wet periods.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/1933854 Main and Bentley, Ecology, "Water Relations of Australian Burrowing Frogs and Tree Frogs" (1964)]</ref> Either type of frog would appear biochemically inactive (i.e. not living) during dormant periods to anyone lacking a sensitive means of detecting low levels of metabolism.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Nonplanetary life==

===Dust and plasma-based===
In 2007, [[V. N. Tsytovich]] and colleagues proposed that lifelike behaviors could be exhibited by dust particles suspended in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], under conditions that might exist in space.<ref name="dust1">{{cite news| url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070814150630.htm| date=2007-08-15| publisher=Science Daily| title=Physicists Discover Inorganic Dust With Lifelike Qualities}}</ref><ref name="dust2">{{cite journal| url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/1367-2630/9/8/263| title=From plasma crystals and helical structures towards inorganic living matter| journal= New J.

and evolving into more stable forms. Similar forms of life were described in [[Fred Hoyle]]'s classic novel ''[[The Black Cloud]]''.

==In fiction==
In the realm of science fiction, there have occasionally been forms of life proposed that, while often highly speculative and unsupported by rigorous theoretical examination, are nevertheless interesting and in some cases even plausible.

In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s short story "[[Technical Error]]", there is an example of differing [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]]. This is not a case of alien life, rather it is an accident. The concept of reversed chirality also figured prominently in the plot of [[James Blish]]'s ''Star Trek'' novel ''[[Spock Must Die!]]'', where a transporter experiment gone awry ends up creating a duplicate Spock who turns out to be a perfect mirror-image of the original all the way down to the atomic level.

An example of silicon based life forms takes place in the [[Alan Dean Foster]] novel ''[[Sentenced to Prism]]'' in which the protagonist, Evan Orgell, is trapped on a planet whose entire ecosystem is mostly silicon-based.

Perhaps the most extreme example in science fiction is [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''[[Sector General]]'': a series of novels and short stories about multienvironment hospital for the strangest life-forms imaginable, some of them breathing methane, chlorine, water and sometimes also oxygen. Some of the species directly ''metabolise'' hard radiation and their environment doesn't differ much from the atmosphere of a star, while others live in near absolute zero temperatures. All life forms are classified according to their metabolism, internal and external features, and more extreme abilities (telepathy, empathy, hive mind, etc.) with four letter codes.

One of the major sentient species in [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld (world)|Discworld]]'' universe are the "Earth"-based (ranging from Detritus to Diamond) [[Troll (Discworld)|Trolls]]. [[Fred Hoyle]]'s classic novel ''[[The Black Cloud]]'' features a life form consisting of a vast cloud of interstellar dust, the individual particles of which interact via electromagnetic signalling analogous to how the individual cells of multicellular terrestrial life interact.

Outside of science-fiction, life in interstellar dust has been proposed as part of the [[panspermia]] hypothesis. The low temperatures and densities of interstellar clouds would seem to imply that life processes would operate much more slowly there than on Earth. Inorganic dust-based life has been speculated upon based on recent computer simulations.<ref name="dust2"/> Similarly, Arthur C. Clarke's "[[Crusade (short story)|Crusade]]" revolves around a planetwide life-form based on silicon and superfluid helium located in deep intergalactic space, processing its thoughts slowly by human standards, that sends probes to look for similar life in nearby galaxies. It concludes that it needs to make planets more habitable for similar life-forms, and sends out other probes to foment [[supernova]]e to do so.

[[Robert L. Forward]]'s ''[[Camelot 30K]]'' describes an ecosystem on the surface of [[Kuiper belt object]]s that is based on a [[fluorocarbon]] chemistry with [[oxygen difluoride|OF<sub>2</sub>]] as the principal solvent instead of H<sub>2</sub>O. The organisms in this ecology keep warm by secreting a pellet of [[uranium-235]] inside themselves and then moderating its nuclear fission using a boron-rich carapace around it. Kuiper belt objects are known to be rich in organic compounds, such as [[tholin]]s, so some form of life existing on their surfaces is not entirely implausible–though perhaps not going so far as to develop natural internal nuclear reactors, as have Forward's. In Forward's ''[[Rocheworld]]'' series, an Earth-like biochemistry is proposed that uses a mixture of water and ammonia as its solvent. In ''[[Dragon's Egg]]'' and ''[[Starquake (book)|Starquake]]'', Forward proposes life on the surface of a [[neutron star]] utilizing "nuclear chemistry" in the [[degenerate matter]] crust. Since such life utilised [[strong nuclear force]]s instead of [[electromagnetic force|electromagnetic interactions]], it was posited that life might function millions of times faster than typical on Earth.

[[Gregory Benford]] and [[David Brin]]'s ''[[Heart of the Comet]]'' features a [[comet]] with a conventional carbon-and-water-based ecosystem that becomes active near the [[perihelion]] when the Sun warms it. Brin's own novel ''[[Sundiver]]'' is an example of science fiction proposing a form of life existing within the [[Plasma physics|plasma]] atmosphere of a [[star]] using complex self-sustaining [[magnetic field]]s. Gregory Benford had a form of plasma-based life exist in the [[accretion disk]] of a [[primordial black hole]] in his novel ''[[Eater (novel)|Eater]]''. The suggestion that life could even occur within the plasma of a star has been picked up by other science fiction writers, as in David Brin's [[uplift Universe|Uplift Saga]] or [[Frederik Pohl|Frederik Pohl's]] novel ''[[The World at the End of Time]]''. The idea is that places where reactions occur–even an incredible environment as a star–presents a possible medium for some chain of events that could produce a system able to replicate.

The [[Outsider (Known Space)|Outsiders]] in [[Larry Niven]]'s [[Known Space]] universe are [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] creatures based on [[liquid helium]]. They derive [[Thermoelectricity|thermoelectric energy]] from a temperature gradient by basking half their body in sunlight, keeping the other half in shadow and exposed to interstellar vacuum.

[[Stephen Baxter]] has, perhaps, imagined some of the most unusual exotic life-forms in his [[Xeelee]] series of novels and stories, including [[supersymmetric]] [[photino]]-based life that congregate in the gravity wells of stars, entities composed of [[quantum]] [[wave function]]s, and the Qax, who thrive in any form of [[convection cell]]s, from swamp gas to the atmospheres of [[gas giant]]s. In his book ''[[Manifold: Space]]'', he also proposes natural robots, life forms made of iron, called the Gaijin, evolving from creatures in oceans of [[iron carbonyl]].

The sentient ocean that covers much of the surface of Solaris in [[Stanislaw Lem]]'s [[Solaris (novel)|eponymous novel]] also seems, from much of the fictional research quoted and discussed in the book, to be based on some element other than carbon. 

In his novel ''[[Diaspora (novel)|Diaspora]]'', [[Greg Egan]] posits entire virtual universes implemented on [[Turing Machine]]s encoded by [[Wang tile|Wang Tiles]] in gargantuan [[polysaccharide]] 'carpets.' In the same novel, Egan describes lifeforms in the 6-D 'macrosphere' that use a collapsed atom chemistry with energetic processes of the same order as nuclear reactions, due to the peculiarities of higher dimensional physics.

In her novel ''[[Brain Plague (novel)|Brain Plague]]'', [[Joan Slonczewski]] describes a species of intelligent microrganisms with arsenic-based chemistries that live symbiotically with human hosts.

[[Schlock Mercenary characters#Sergeant Schlock|Sergeant Schlock]] is one of the lead characters in the webcomic ''[[Schlock Mercenary]]''. His species, [[Schlock Mercenary characters#Amorphs|Carbosilicate Amorphs]], evolved from self-repairing distributed [[data storage devices]] and, as such, redundantly distribute their 'brain' throughout their body. They are highly resistant to [[hard vacuum]], [[explosive decompression]], [[projectile weapons]], chemical-based explosives, and dismemberment. Their only specialty organ is their eyes, which they harvest as fruit from the Ghanj-Rho eye-tree on their home planet. While the Amorphs have the ability to move fast, quietly,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20060905.html |title=Schlock Mercenary archives – Tuesday, September 5, 2006 |publisher=Schlockmercenary.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}</ref> and sprout appendages at will, they excel at 'closer-than-melee-range combat, primarily "meme-toxins" against other Amorphs.

Alien warriors recruited by the god Klael in [[David Eddings]]' "[[The Tamuli|Tamuli]]" trilogy are noted by their human opponents to breathe marsh-gas (methane). Within Eddings' universe, this limits their capacity for exertion in an oxygen atmosphere, and also determines the tactics used to fight them and eventually to destroy them in their encampments.

The eponymous organism in [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'' is described as reproducing via the direct conversion of energy into matter.

===''Star Trek''===
[[Image:STDevil inTheDark.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A [[The Devil in the Dark|Horta]], a fictional silicon-based life-form in the [[Star Trek]] universe.]]
A well-known example of a non–carbon-based life-form in science fiction is the Horta in the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "[[The Devil in the Dark]]". A highly intelligent silicon-based creature made almost entirely of pure rock, it tunnels through rock as easily as humans move through air. The entire species dies out every 50,000&nbsp;years except for one who tends the eggs, which take the form of silicon nodules scattered throughout the caverns and tunnels of its home planet, [[List of Star Trek planets: G-L#J|Janus VI]]. The inadvertent destruction of many of these eggs by a human mining colony led the mother Horta to respond by killing the colonists and sabotaging their equipment; it was only through a [[Vulcan mind meld]] that the race's benevolence and intelligence were discovered and peaceful relations established.

''Star Trek'' would later offer other corporeal life-forms with an alternative biochemistry. The [[Tholian]]s of "[[The Tholian Web]]" are depicted and described, in that episode and later in the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode "[[In a Mirror, Darkly]]" as being primarily of mineral-based composition and thriving only in superheated conditions. Another episode from ''TOS'''s third season, "[[The Savage Curtain]]", depicted another rock creature called an Excalbian, which is believed in [[List of fan fiction terms#Fanon|fanon]] to also have been silicon-based.<ref>[http://www.scifi.com/startrek/episodes/77.html SciFi.com StarTrek] ''[[Syfy]]''{{dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref>

In ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', the [[Crystalline Entity]] appeared in two episodes, "[[Datalore]]" and "[[Silicon Avatar]]". This was an enormous spacefaring [[crystal structure|crystal lattice]] that had taken thousands of lives in its quest for energy. It may have been unaware of this, however, but it was destroyed before communications could be established at a level sufficient to ascertain it. In another episode, "[[Home Soil]]", intelligent crystals that formed a "microbrain" were discovered during a terraforming mission, and they described the humans they encountered as "ugly bags of mostly water."

"[[The Disease]]", an episode of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' featured some artificially engineered silicon-based parasites, and an ''Enterprise'' episode, "[[Observer Effect (Enterprise episode)|Observer Effect]]", also presented a lethal silicon-based virus.
In another Voyager episode, "[[Hope and Fear]]", a [[xenon]]-based life-form was mentioned. In the ''Enterprise'' episode "[[The Communicator (Star Trek: Enterprise)|The Communicator]]", an alien species is encountered whose blood chemistry, while not explicitly stated, is sufficiently different from terrestrial organisms that it is not red and iron is toxic to it. Various Star Trek series also had episodes featuring photonic lifeforms.

===''Star Wars''===
In the ''[[Star Wars]]'' movie ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', two life-forms were encountered by the characters that were non-carbon based entities. Although details of their physiology were not mentioned on screen, the [[space slug]], (a giant worm-like creature that lived on asteroids in the vacuum of space),<ref>{{Databank|category=creature|subject=spaceslug|text=Space Slug}}</ref><ref>{{Sww|Exogorth}}</ref> and the [[Mynock]], (pesky bat-like vermin that would attach to spaceship hulls and chew through power conduits to feed off the raw energy),<ref>{{Databank|category=creature|subject=mynock|text=Mynock}}</ref><ref>{{Sww|Mynock}}</ref> are said to be silicon-based organisms in [[Star Wars Expanded Universe]] sources. Also from ''The Empire Strikes Back'', the [[bounty hunter]] Zuckuss is a member of the [[List of Star Wars races (F-J)#Gand|Gand]] race, an ammonia-based life-form. However, it is worth noting that the Gand are divided into two subspecies, only one of which breathes at all, the other drawing all their required sustenance from food intake and producing speech by essentially modulated [[flatulence]].

Appearing only in the Star Wars Expanded Universe is the [[List of Star Wars creatures#Spice spider|spice spider]] of [[List of Star Wars planets (K-L)|Kessel]], a creature made of [[Spice (Star Wars)|glitterstim spice]] and silicon that spun crystalline webs harvested by miners as glitterstim spice, an illegal [[psychoactive]] [[narcotic]]. The spider used the webs to catch bogeys, tiny energy creatures that it consumed for energy.<ref>{{Sww|Energy spider}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cuswe.org/newdescr.asp?search=7930 |title=Energy Spider. The Completely Unofficial Star Wars Encyclopedia |publisher=Cuswe.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}</ref>

===Other film and television===
* In the movie ''[[The Monolith Monsters]]'' (1957), a silicon meteor reproduces, draining silicates from everything it touches. It needs water to start its cycle and contains molecular structures typical of many kinds of rocks, mixed together. A geologist says that its structure is nearly impossible. The meteor is killed by salt water, which can stop the cycle.
* On the ''[[Island of Terror]]'' (1966), silicon based life-forms are created accidentally by scientists while researching a cure for cancer. The "Silicates" are not pretty, they feed on bones (human or otherwise) and they can reproduce by mitosis. Not much to say about the scientific side though, since the survivors ignore how the creatures are exactly made of. They eventually use a very 60's way to defeat them.
* In [[Firewalker (The X-Files)|Firewalker]], a [[The X-Files (season 2)|second-season episode]] of ''[[The X-Files]]'', a silicon-based plant that infects humans [[parasite|parasitically]] through its spores are discovered living deep in a [[volcano]].
* Also from ''The X-Files'', the [[The X-Files (season 1)|first-season episode]] "[[Ice (The X-Files)|Ice]]" deals with an ammonia-based [[vermiform]] parasite.
* A key plot point in the [[comedy]] ''[[Evolution (film)|Evolution]]'' involves nitrogen-based life forms, and using [[selenium]]-based [[shampoo]] to poison them (with the bonus of a product placement for [[Head & Shoulders]]).
* In the ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' fourth season episode "[[Scorched Earth]]", a Human society known as the [[Enkarans]] are threatened on their new homeworld by an alien ship that is terraforming the planet to be suitable for the sulfur-based [[Gadmeer]] species.
* In the ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' fifth season episode "[[Remnants (Stargate Atlantis)|Remnants]]", a device is found whose purpose was to seed a planet with silicon-based life.
* In ''[[Ben 10]]'', both the Omnitrix alien [[List of Ben 10 aliens#Diamondhead|Diamondhead]] and the alien bounty hunter [[List of Ben 10 characters#Tetrax Shard|Tetrax Shard]] are members of the Petrosapien species, which are a form of silicon-based life. Other silicon-based lifeforms on the show include the Omnitrix aliens Chromostone (who is crystalline), and Echo Echo and Upgrade (who are both biomechanical). Other member's of Upgrade's species have appeared, including the shape-shifting "Ship," a pet of Ben's girlfriend, Julie.
* ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008) introduces thirteen "extra dimensional beings" with [[crystal skull|crystal skeletons]], who founded a city that became the basis of the [[El Dorado]] myth. Though their flesh has died and rotted away, their minds still live on within their skeletons, which communicate [[telepathic]]ally.
*The episode "The Stones of Blood", of the 16th season of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the Fourth Doctor encounters the Ogri, a silicon-based life form, and in the same sub-plot, the Megara, who are made entirely out of an unknown substance, possibly energy, and they uphold the word of the law, and execute all who break the law with a beam of energy.
* in Doctor Who's first series after its revival, episodes 4-5 and 11 featured the alien [[Slitheen]] family of the planet [[Raxicoricofallapatorius]], which were said to be calcium-based life forms, causing them to be blown up in contact with [[vinegar]]. The Slitheen family also reappeared in several episodes in [[The Sarah Jane Adventures]] series, as well as cameo appearances in later Doctor Who Episodes.
* In the anime movie [[Mobile Suit Gundam 00 the Movie: A Wakening of the Trailblazer]], there is a race of techno-organic sentient lifeform named ELS (Extraterrestrial Living-Metal Shape-Shifters).
* The Kaiju in [[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]] are silicon-based lifeforms whose blood is ammonia-based and highly toxic.

===Computer and video games===
In the ''[[Command & Conquer series|Command & Conquer]]'' [[real-time strategy]] games, both the gameplay and storyline revolve heavily around the introduction to Earth, via meteor, of the extraterrestrial mutagen [[Tiberium]], which displays strikingly lifelike behaviours, such as self-replication, evolution, and homeostasis, without undergoing anything like common carbon-based metabolic cycles, and which appears to be colonising the Earth, converting it into an environment unsuited to carbon-based biology. Earth creatures (such as animals, plants and even humans) exposed to Tiberium can either be killed because of the radiation or be transformed into Tiberium-based life-forms, to whom Tiberium radiation is curative rather than toxic. It is later revealed that Tiberium was introduced to Earth by the [[Scrin]], an extremely advanced race of Tiberium-based aliens bent on mining the planet after the Tiberium deposits have reached maturity.

In the [[Halo franchise]], the weak, low-ranking [[Covenant (Halo)#Grunts|Grunts]] of the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]] originate on a frozen [[exoplanet]] named Balaho, where methane is a primary constituent of the [[atmosphere]], prevents the planet becoming even more frigid than it already is due to its distance from its parent star, and thus, Grunts have [[evolved]] to utilize the gas for [[Breathing|respiration]]. Grunts are also shown to be able to use [[benzene]] as a [[recreational drug]].

In the ''[[Master of Orion]]'' series of space strategy games, there exists an extraterrestrial race called Silicoids, whose appearance (and presumably composition) is similar to crystalline mineral structures. The game posits that this grants them immunity to the effects of hostile environments and pollution and they require no sustenance, at the expense of impeding their reproductive rate and their ability to interact with other intelligent species.

In the ''[[Metroid Prime]]'' series, [[Metroid (series)#Phazon|Phazon]] is a highly radioactive, self-regenerating mineral with organic properties that is generated by the sentient planet Phaaze.

In ''[[Metroid Prime Hunters]]'', Spire is a rock-like, silicon-based alien. He is the last Diamont (presumably a play on the word [[diamond]], which is composed of carbon).

In the ''[[Submarine TITANS]]'' strategy game, the alien race in the game are called "the Silicons" because they are silicon-based life forms.

In the ''[[Star Control]]'' series, the [[Chenjesu]], are hyperintelligent, peaceful silicon-based life-forms that were the backbone of the Alliance of Free Stars. Their crystalline biology apparently gives them the ability to send and receive hyperwave transmissions. Also, there are the [[Slylandro]], who are gas beings residing in the upper atmosphere of a gas giant. As well, there are evidences of another silicon-based race, the [[Taalo]] who are described by the [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] [[Ur-Quan]] as the only race to have not awakened their territorial instincts. The Taalo were also immune to mind control.

In the game of ''[[Xenosaga]]'', artificial life forms known as Realians have been created using silicon-based chemistry. They resemble humans in every aspect, except they are considered to be lower than humans on the social [[ladder]].

In ''[[Mass Effect]]'' the alien [[List of races in the Mass Effect universe#Turians|Turians]] and [[List of races in the Mass Effect universe#Quarians|Quarians]], are both based on dextro-amino acids, as opposed to all the other sentient species of the galaxy based on levo-amino acids. There are also the [[List of races in the Mass Effect universe#Volus|Volus]], an ammonia based species that must wear pressure suits to survive in environments suited to the other races.

In ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'', the [[Grox (Spore)|Grox]] refer to the player and to other alien empires as "slow thinking carbon-based lifeforms" and "carbon wads", implying that the Grox (which are at least partly machine life) are not carbon-based. Also, the Grox can only exist on [[barren planet]]s which cannot support other life, and when a planet is terraformed the Grox inhabiting it die immediately. The Grox seem to gather sustenance from the radiation from the galactic core, as the Grox colonies are larger the closer they are to the galactic core.

In ''[[Muv Luv]]'', the [[BETA (Muv-Luv)|BETA]] which calls itself the "higher/superior existence" says they were created by a silicon-based being simply called "The Creator". As such, they don't consider any non-silicon-based creature to be alive, not even themselves. Its reasoning was that only silicon-based beings occur naturally and have the ability to reproduce and disperse. When the human main character, Takeru, argues that humans also have the ability to reproduce and disperse, the higher existence says carbon too easily mingles with other elements and therefore it would be impossible for a carbon-based existence to have evolved on its own. Thus, humans must be other biological machines created by a life form just as the BETA are.
