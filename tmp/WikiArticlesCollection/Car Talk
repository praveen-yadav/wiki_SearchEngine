'''''Car Talk'''''  is a [[Peabody Award]]-winning [[Talk radio|radio talk show]] broadcast weekly on [[NPR]] stations and elsewhere. Its subjects are automobiles and automotive repair, discussed often in a humorous way. It was hosted by brothers [[Tom and Ray Magliozzi]], known also as ''Click and Clack, the [[Tappet#Internal combustion engines|Tappet]] Brothers''.

The show was produced from 1977 to October 2012, until the retirement of the Magliozzi brothers.  Edited reruns continue to be available for airing on NPR affiliates.<ref name=Bauder>{{cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jOCGFHXdRDFYjEtqQss6Z1jiCmtg?docId=a86195c0202f48b7962a89b1807dbd4f |title=NPR 'Car Talk' duo retiring; reruns to continue |first=David |last=Bauder |date=8 June 2012 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=15 June 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68djZLtRU |archivedate=2012-06-23}}</ref>

==Show==
''Car Talk'' is presented in the form of a call-in radio show: listeners call in with questions related to motor vehicle maintenance and repair. Most of the advice sought is diagnostic, with callers describing symptoms and demonstrating sounds of an ailing vehicle while the Magliozzis make an attempt at identifying the malfunction. While the hosts pepper their call-in sessions with jokes directed at both the caller and at themselves, the Magliozzis were usually able to arrive at a diagnosis and give helpful advice.

Edited reruns are carried on [[Sirius XM Satellite Radio]] via both the NPR Now and NPR Talk channels.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sirius.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Sirius/Page&c=Channel&cid=1102975192871&s=sched | title=Sirius XM's NPR Talk Schedule | publisher=Sirius XM Radio}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sirius.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Sirius/Page&c=Channel&cid=1102975192867&s=sched | title=Sirius XM's NPR Now Schedule | publisher=Sirius XM Radio}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=NPR's Car Talk Listeners Pick Ugliest New Car|url=http://www.npr.org/about/press/050409.uglycar.html |quote=Car Talk is public radio's most popular entertainment program, airing on nearly 600 stations with more than 4.4 million listeners a week tuning in for an hour-long tune-up on car advice and humor.|work=[[National Public Radio]] |year=2005|accessdate=2010-12-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=NPR Programs Attract Record-Breaking Audiences Public Radio Listenership at All-Time High |url=http://www.npr.org/about/press/020319.recordbreak.html|quote=Growth in the NPR news/talk audience outpaced similar gains realized by commercial news/talk radio.

The ''Car Talk'' [[theme song]] is "Dawggy Mountain Breakdown" by [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] artist [[David Grisman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/music-show-4|title=Music on the Show}}</ref>

===Call-in procedure===
Throughout the program, listeners are encouraged to dial the [[toll-free telephone number]], 1-888-CAR-TALK (1-888-227-8255), which connects to a 24-hour answering service. Although the approximately 2,000 queries received each week are screened by the ''Car Talk'' staff, the questions are unknown to the Magliozzis in advance as "that would entail researching the right answer, which is what? ...Work."<ref name=faq>{{cite news | url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/faq/faq-straight.html | title=Car Talk Official FAQs | publisher=Car Talk | accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref>  Producers select and contact the callers several days ahead of the show's Wednesday taping to arrange the segment. The caller speaks briefly to a producer before being connected live with the hosts, and is given little coaching other than being told to be prepared to talk, not to use any written preparation and to "have fun". The show deliberately tapes more callers than it has time to air each week in order to be able to choose the best ones for broadcast.  Those segments that do make it to air are generally edited for time. For the last four years of the show, new shows included previously broadcast segments as much as 10 years old. The re-used segments, including re-used puzzlers, were not acknowledged as old material and sometimes new caller material was mixed in alongside the recycled calls.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mayer |first=Doug |title=Car Talk Forums:Old Callers|url=http://community.cartalk.com/discussion/2211396/old-callers}}</ref>

===Features===

The show originally consisted of two segments with a break in between.  Then the show was changed to three segments.  The hosts used to refer to content coming up in the second half of the program.  Ever since the shift to the three segment format, it has been a running joke to refer to the last segment as "the third half" of the program.

The show opens with a short comedy segment, typically jokes sent in by listeners, followed by eight call-in sessions. The hosts run a contest called the "Puzzler", in which a riddle, sometimes car-related, is presented. The answer to the previous week's "Puzzler" is given at the beginning of the "second half" of the show, and a new "Puzzler" is given at the start of the "third half". The hosts give instructions to listeners to write answers addressed to "Puzzler Tower" on some non-existent or expensive object, such as a 26-dollar bill or an advanced digital [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] camera. This gag initially started as suggestions that the answers be written "on the back of a twenty-dollar bill". A [[running gag]] concerns Tom's inability to remember the previous week's "Puzzler" without heavy prompting from Ray. For each puzzler, one correct answer is chosen at random, with the winner receiving a $26 gift certificate to the ''Car Talk'' store, referred to as the "Shameless Commerce Division".<ref>[http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzler/ "Puzzler"], ''Car Talk'' website</ref>  It was originally $25, but was increased for inflation after a few years. Originally, the winner received a specific item from the store, but it soon changed to a gift certificate to allow the winner to choose the item they want (though Tom often makes an item suggestion).

A recurring feature is "Stump the Chumps," in which the hosts revisit a caller from a previous show to determine the accuracy and the effect, if any, of their advice. A similar feature began in May 2001, "Where Are They Now, Tommy?"  It begins with a comical musical theme with a sputtering, backfiring car engine and a horn as a backdrop.  Tom then announces who the previous caller was, followed by a short replay of the essence of the previous caller is played, preceded and followed by harp music often used in other audiovisual media to indicate recalling and returning from a dream.  The hosts then greet the previous caller, asking them if there have been any influences on the answer they're about to relate, such as arcane bribes or the NPR staff.  The repair story is then discussed, followed by a fanfare and applause if the Tappet Brothers' diagnosis was correct, or a wah-wah-wah music piece mixed with a car starter operated by a weak battery (an engine which won't start) if the diagnosis was wrong.  The hosts then thank the caller for their return appearance.

The brothers also have an official Animal-Vehicle Biologist and Wildlife Guru named  Kieran Lindsey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.vt.edu/search/person.html?person=1376104 |title=Kieran Lindsey - People Search &#124; Virginia Tech |work=Search.vt.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09|quote=Kieran Jane Lindsey; Director, Natural Resources Distance Learning Corsortium, College of Natural Resources & Env.}}</ref> She answers questions like ''How do I remove a snake from my car?'' and offers advice on how those living in cities and suburbs can reconnect with wildlife.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://withgoodreasonradio.org/2011/10/girl-scouts-beyond-campfires-and-cookie/ |title=Girl Scouts: Beyond Campfires and Cookies |publisher=[[Virginia Foundation for the Humanities]] |date=October 29, 2011 |quote=Answering questions like how to remove a snake from your car, urban wildlife biologist Kieran Lindsey (Virginia Tech) is the new official Animal-Vehicle Biologist and Wildlife Guru for Car Talk on NPR.

{{anchor|famous_callers}} Celebrities have been callers as well. Examples include [[Geena Davis]], [[Morley Safer]], [[Ashley Judd]], [[Gordon Elliott]], former Major League pitcher [[Bill Lee (left-handed pitcher)|Bill Lee]], and astronaut [[John Grunsfeld]] calling from the [[Space Shuttle]].
There have been numerous appearances from NPR personalities, including [[Bob Edwards]], [[Susan Stamberg]], [[Scott Simon]], [[Ray Suarez]], [[Will Shortz]], [[Sylvia Poggioli]], and commentator and author [[Daniel Pinkwater]]. On one occasion, the show featured [[Martha Stewart]] as an in-studio guest, whom the Magliozzis twice during the segment referred to as "Margaret".

In addition to at least one on-orbit call, the Brothers once received a call asking advice on winterizing a couple of "kit cars". After much beating around the bush and increasing evasiveness by the caller, they asked him just how much these kit cars were worth. The answer: about $800 million. It was a joke call from the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] concerning the preparation of the [[Mars Rover]]s (''[[Spirit rover|Spirit]]'' and ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]'') for the oncoming Martian winter{{episode needed|date=March 2011}}. Click and Clack have also been featured in editorial cartoons, including one where a befuddled NASA engineer calls them to ask how to fix the [[Space Shuttle]]{{episode needed|date=March 2011}}.

===Humor===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
Humor and wisecracking pervade the program. Tom and Ray are known for their [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating humor]], often joking about the supposedly poor quality of their advice and the show in general. They also comment at the end of each show: "Well, it's happened again — you've squandered another perfectly good hour listening to ''Car Talk''."

At some point in almost every show, usually when giving the address for the Puzzler answers, Ray mentions [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]] (where the show originates), at which point Tom reverently interjects with a tone of civic pride, "Our fair city." Ray invariably mocks "Cambridge, MA" the US Postal Service's two letter abbreviation for "Massachusetts" by pronouncing it as a word.

Leading into each break in the show, one of the hosts leads up to the network identification with a humorous take on a disgusted reaction of some usually famous person to hearing that identification.  The full line goes along the pattern of, for example, "And even though [[Roger Clemens#SteroidUseControversy|Roger Clemens]] stabs his radio with a syringe whenever he hears ''us'' say it, this is NPR: National Public Radio (later just '...this is NPR')."

The ending credits of the show start with thanks to the colorfully nicknamed actual staffers: producer Doug "the subway fugitive, not a slave to fashion, bongo boy frogman" Berman;<ref>{{cite news| url=http://o.seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/editorials/2018445674_edit17talk.html| title=Tom and Ray, the Tappet Brothers, are exhausted| date=2012-06-16| publisher=[[Seattle Times]]| accessdate=2013-08-03}}</ref> "John 'Bugsy' Lawlor, just back from the..." every week a different eating event with rhyming foodstuff names; David "Calves of Belleville" Greene;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/music-show-0|title=Music on the Show |publisher=cartalk.com |accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref> Catherine "[[Young Frankenstein|Frau Blücher]]" Fenollosa, whose name causes a horse to neigh and gallop (an allusion to a running gag in the movie ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'');<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/help-us-help-henry-2010-1 |title= Help Us Help Henry 2010|publisher=cartalk.com|accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref> and Carly "High Voltage" Nix,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/whos-real-high-voltage-car-talk-plaza |title=Who's the real "High Voltage" at Car Talk Plaza?| last= Nix |first= Carly| publisher= cartalk.com |accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> among others.  Following the real staff is a lengthy list of pun-filled fictional staffers and sponsors such as statistician Marge Innovera ("[[margin of error]]"), customer care representative Haywood Jabuzoff ("Hey, would you buzz off"), meteorologist Claudio Vernight ("cloudy overnight"), optometric firm C.F. Eye Care ("see if I care"), Russian chauffeur Pikov Andropov ("pick up and drop off"), [[Leo Tolstoy]] biographer Warren Peace ("[[War and Peace]]"), hygiene officer and chief of the Tokyo office Otaka Shawa ("oh take a shower"), Swedish snow-board instructor Soren Derkeister ("sore in the keister"), and law firm [[Dewey, Cheatem & Howe|Dewey, Cheetham & Howe]] ("Do we cheat 'em? And how!"), among many, many others.<ref name= "credits">{{cite news | url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/about/credits/credits.html | title=Car Talk Credits | publisher=Car Talk | accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref>

At the end of the show, Ray warns the audience, "Don't drive like my brother," to which Tom replies, "And don't drive like ''my'' brother."  The original tag line was "Don't drive like a knucklehead."  There have been variations such as, "Don't drive like my brother..." "And don't drive like his brother," and "Don't drive like my sister..." "And don't drive like ''my'' sister." The tagline was heard in a cameo for the [[Pixar]] film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', in which Tom and Ray voiced [[anthropomorphized]] vehicles ([[List of Cars characters#Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze|Rusty and Dusty Rust-Eze]], respectively a 1963 [[Dodge Dart]] V1.0 and 1963 [[Dodge A100]] van, as [[Lightning McQueen]]'s racing [[sponsorship|sponsors]]) with personalities similar to their own on-air personae.<ref>{{IMDb title|0317219|Cars}}.

==History==
{{expand section|date=August 2013}}
''Car Talk'' was first broadcast on [[WBUR]] in [[Boston]] in 1977 and was picked up nationally by NPR ten years later.{{cn|date=August 2013}}

In 1992, ''Car Talk'' won a [[List of Peabody Award winners (1990–99)#1992|Peabody Award]], saying "Each week, master mechanics Tom and Ray Magliozzi provide useful information about preserving and protecting our cars. But the real core of this program is what it tells us about human mechanics....The insight and laughter provided by Messrs. Magliozzi, in conjunction with their producer Doug Berman, provide a weekly mental tune-up for a vast and ever-growing public radio audience."<ref>}{{cite web| url=http://peabodyawards.com/past-winners/award/?pbaward=999&pb_search=1&pb_title=&pb_year=&pb_porg=&pb_query=car%20talk | title= Car Talk| year=1992| publisher= George Foster Peabody Awards| accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref>

In May 2007, the program, which previously had been available only digitally as a paid subscription from [[Audible.com]], became a free [[podcast]] distributed by NPR, after a two-month test period where only a "call of the week" was available via podcast.{{citation needed|date = April 2012}}

As of 2012, it had 3.3 million listeners each week, on about 660 stations.<ref name=Bauder/> On June 8, 2012, the brothers announced that they would no longer broadcast new episodes as of October.  Executive producer Doug Berman said the best material from 25 years of past shows would be used to put together "repurposed" shows for NPR to broadcast. Berman estimated the archives contain enough for eight years' worth of material before anything would have to be repeated. The brothers will continue to write their syndicated newspaper column.<ref name=Bauder />

The show is continuing to air after their retirement, with shows built from material from the archive of past shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/06/08/154576808/car-talk-guys-are-retiring-but-their-best-stuff-will-be-rebroadcast|title=Car Talk Guys Are Retiring, But Their Best Stuff Will Be Rebroadcast}}</ref>

{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
[[Image:Car Talk Dewey, Cheetham & Howe.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The name of the DC&H corporate offices is visible on the third floor window above the corner of Brattle and JFK Streets, in [[Harvard Square]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].]]
The Magliozzis are long-time [[car mechanic]]s. Ray Magliozzi has a bachelor of science degree in humanities and science from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], while Tom has a bachelor of science degree in economics from MIT and an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] and [[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]] from the [[Boston University Graduate School of Management]].

The duo, usually led by Ray, are known for rants on the evils of the [[internal combustion engine]], people who talk on [[cell phones]] while driving, [[Peugeot]]s, women named Donna who always seem to drive [[Camaro]]s, lawyers, the clever use of the [[English language]], people who choose to live in Alaska (or similar snowy, icy climates), and practically anything else, including themselves. They have a relaxed and humorous approach to cars, car repair, [[cup holder]]s, pets, lawyers, car repair mechanics, [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s, and almost everything else. They often cast a critical, jaundiced insider's eye toward the auto industry. Tom and Ray are committed to the values of defensive driving and environmentalism.

The Magliozzis operate a garage. The show's offices are located nearby at the corner of JFK Street and Brattle Street in [[Harvard Square]], marked as "[[Dewey, Cheatem & Howe|Dewey, Cheetham & Howe]]", the imaginary law firm to which they refer on-air. DC&H doubles as the business name of Tappet Brothers Associates, the corporation established to manage the business end of ''Car Talk''.  Initially a joke, the company was incorporated after the show expanded from a single station to national syndication.

The two were [[commencement speaker]]s at MIT in 1999.

Executive producer Doug Berman said in 2012, "The guys are culturally right up there with [[Mark Twain]] and the [[Marx Brothers]]. They will stand the test of time. People will still be enjoying them years from now. They're that good."<ref name=Bauder/>

==Adaptations==
