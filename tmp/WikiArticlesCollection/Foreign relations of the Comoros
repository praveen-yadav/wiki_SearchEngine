{{Politics of Comoros}}
In November 1975, [[Comoros]] became the 143rd member of the [[United Nations]]. The new nation was defined as consisting of the entire [[archipelago]], despite the fact that [[France]] maintains control over [[Mayotte]].

== Overview ==
Comoros also is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[Arab League]], the [[European Development Fund]], the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[Indian Ocean Commission]], and the [[African Development Bank]]. 

The government fostered close relationships with the more conservative (and oil-rich) Arab states, such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]].<ref name=cs/> It frequently received aid from those countries and the regional financial institutions they influenced, such as the [[Arab Bank for Economic Development]] in Africa and the [[Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development]].<ref name=cs/> In October 1993, Comoros joined the [[League of Arab States]], after having been rejected when it applied for membership initially in 1977.<ref name=cs/>

Regional relations generally were good.<ref name=cs/> In 1985 [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], and [[Seychelles]] agreed to admit Comoros as the fourth member of the [[Indian Ocean Commission]] (IOC), an organization established in 1982 to encourage regional cooperation.<ref name=cs/> In 1993 Mauritius and Seychelles had two of the five [[Embassy|embassies]] in Moroni, and Mauritius and Madagascar were connected to the republic by regularly scheduled commercial flights.<ref name=cs/>

In November 1975, Comoros became the 143d member of the [[United Nations|UN]]. In the 1990s, the republic continued to represent Mahoré in the UN.<ref name=cs/> Comoros was also a member of the OAU, the EDF, the [[World Bank]], the IMF, the IOC, and the [[African Development Bank]].<ref name=cs/>

Comoros thus cultivated relations with various nations, both East and West, seeking to increase trade and obtain financial assistance.<ref name=cs/> In 1994, however, it was increasingly facing the need to control its expenditures and reorganize its economy so that it would be viewed as a sounder recipient of investment.<ref name=cs/> Comoros also confronted domestically the problem of the degree of [[democracy]] the government was prepared to grant to its citizens, a consideration that related to its standing in the world community.<ref name=cs/>

==Bilateral relations==

===People's Republic of China===
 {{main|People's Republic of China – Comoros relations}}
Comoros also hosted an embassy of [[People's Republic of China|China]], which established relations during the Soilih regime.<ref name=cs/> The Chinese had long been a source of aid and apparently wished to maintain contact with Comoros to counterbalance Indian and Soviet (later Russian) influence in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=cs/> 

In August 2008, a Comorian delegation visited China on a good-will visit. Together with the Chinese [[Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China|defense minister]] [[Liang Guanglie]], and Chief of Staff of the Comoros armed forces Salimou Mohamed Amiri, pledged to increase cooperation between the military of the two nations. Amiri stated that Comoros will continue to adhere to the [[One-China policy]].<ref>"[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/21/content_10227730.htm Chinese defense minister meets Comoros army chief]", ''China View''. 2008-10-21.</ref>

A comprehensive Chinese-assisted treatment campaign has apparently eliminated [[malaria]] from the Comorian island of [[Moheli]] (population 36,000). Administered by Li Guoqiao at the [[Tropical Medicine Institute]], the program relies on hybrid [[Artemisia annua]] of hybrid ancestry, which was used for a drug regimen by which all residents of the island, whether or not visibly ill, took two doses at a 40-day interval. This eliminated the human reservoir of the disease and reduced hospital admissions to 1% or less of January 2008 levels. Visitors to Moheli are now required to take antimalarial drugs, a mix of [[artemisinin]], [[primaquine]] and [[pyrimethamine]] that China provides for free. When asked about Artemisia exports, Li was quoted, "We want to grow them in China and whatever we export depends on bilateral relationships." Comoros has requested a similar program for [[Grande Comore]] and [[Anjouan]], total population 760,000, and Li said that Beijing has agreed in principle.<ref>Africa: Ending Malaria in Sight?

===France===
 {{main|France–Comoros relations}}
Comoros' most significant international relationship is that with France.<ref name=cs>Ercolano, Vincent. "Foreign Affairs". [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/kmtoc.html ''A country study: Comoros''] (Helen Chapin Metz, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (August 1994). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.''</ref> The three years of estrangement following the unilateral declaration of independence and the nationalistic [[Ali Soilih|Soilih]] regime were followed during the conservative [[Ahmed Abdallah|Abdallah]] and [[Said Mohamed Djohar|Djohar]] regimes by a period of growing trade, aid, cultural, and defense links between the former colony and France, punctuated by frequent visits to [[Paris]] by the head of state and occasional visits by the French president to [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]].<ref name=cs/> The leading military power in the region, France has detachments on [[Mahoré]] and [[Réunion]], and its [[Indian Ocean]] fleet sails the waters around the islands.<ref name=cs/> France and Comoros signed a mutual security treaty in 1978; following the mercenary [[coup]] against Abdallah in 1989, French troops restored order and took responsibility for reorganizing and training the Comorian army.<ref name=cs/> With Mahoré continuing to gravitate politically and economically toward France, and Comoros increasingly dependent on the French for help with its own considerable social, political, and economic problems, the issue of Mahoré diminished somewhat in urgency.<ref name=cs/>

Comoros claims [[France|French]]-administered [[Mayotte]] & the [[Glorioso Islands]].

===Georgia===

The Comoros and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] established full diplomatic relations on 26 March 2010.<ref>[http://georgiandaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=17921&Itemid=65 "Georgia and the Union of the Comoros established diplomatic relations"] ''georgiandaily.com'' 2010-03-26 Link retrieved 2010-03-27</ref>

===Japan===

Comorian relations with [[Japan]] were also significant because Japan was the second largest provider of aid, consisting of funding for [[fisheries]], food, and highway development.<ref name=cs/>

===South Africa===

The close relationship Comoros developed with [[South Africa]] in the 1980s was much less significant to both countries in the 1990s.<ref name=cs/> With the reform of its [[apartheid]] government, South Africa no longer needed Comoros as evidence of its ostensible ability to enjoy good relations with a black African state; the end of the [[Cold War]] had also diminished Comoros' strategic value to Pretoria.<ref name=cs/> Although South Africa continued to provide developmental aid, it closed its consulate in Moroni in 1992.<ref name=cs/> Since the 1989 coup and subsequent expulsion of South African-financed mercenaries, Comoros likewise turned away from South Africa and toward France for assistance with its security needs.<ref name=cs/>

===Turkey===

Embassy of Comoros in Egypt is accredited to Turkey. Embassy of Turkey in Kenya is accredited to Comoros.

===United States===
 {{main|Comoros – United States relations}}
The [[United States]] established diplomatic relations in 1977 but in September 1993 closed its embassy in Moroni. The two countries enjoy friendly relations.<ref name=cs/> The historic under-commitment by the US within France's sphere of interest in the Indian Ocean looks set to continue after a November 2009 meeting between heads of state.<ref>[http://www.prweb.com/releases/Comoros/Islands/prweb3169794.htm] The Comoros Islands and President Sambi – Could Change Finally have Arrived? November 7, 2010.</ref> Future friendly relations continue to look promising between the Comoros and America.

===Yemen===
{{main|Comoros – Yemen relations}}
In April 2008, the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation of [[Yemen]] and Comoros Ministry of Fishery and Environment signed a "Memo of Understanding" (MOU) concerning agricultural cooperation.<ref>[http://www.sabanews.net/en/news152712.htm Yemen, Comoros sign agricultural MOU].
