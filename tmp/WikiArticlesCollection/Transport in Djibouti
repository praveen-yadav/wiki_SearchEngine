In 2004, there were an estimated 13 airports, only 3 of which had paved runways as of 2005. [[Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport]], which is situated about 6&nbsp;km from the city of Djibouti, is the country's international air terminal.

The national carrier discontinued operations in 2002. [[Daallo Airlines]], a Somali-owned private carrier, has also offered air transportation since its foundation in 1991. With its hub at the Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport, the airline provides flights to a number of domestic and overseas destinations.
