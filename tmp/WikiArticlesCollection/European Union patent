During the European Council of 28–29 June 2012, agreement was reached on its provisions between 25 of the then 27 [[member states of the European Union]]. Italy and Spain had decided not to take part as a result of the proposed language scheme, which uses English, German and French at the exclusion of other languages. (Croatia subsequently [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|acceded to the EU]] in July 2013.)  The necessary EU legislation for enhanced co-operation was approved by the [[European Parliament]] on 11 December 2012, and entered into force in January 2013.<ref name=EUPARL>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/content/20121203FCS04313/3/html/Parliament-approves-EU-unitary-patent-rules|title=Parliament approves EU unitary patent rules|accessdate=11 December 2012|date=11 December 2012|work=European Parliament}}</ref> The provisions will apply once the related [[Agreement on a Unified Patent Court]], which was signed by all EU member states except Croatia, [[Poland]] and Spain, enters into force, on or after 1 January 2014.

The proposed EU patent is closely related, but different from the [[European Patent Organisation|European patent]], which is granted under the 38-state [[European Patent Convention]]. European patents, once granted, become a "bundle of nationally enforceable patents", in the states which are designated by the applicant. The EU patent would, once established, be designated after granting of the European patent, with validity in all participating countries. The system reduces translation requirements (by focusing on the three languages of the European patent: German, English and French), maintenance fees (with a single fee for the whole area) and provides for judicial procedures for a court with effect in all countries.

In December 2010, the use of the [[enhanced co-operation]] procedure, under which [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Title III: Enhanced Cooperation|Articles 326–334]] of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] provides that a group of member states of the European Union can choose to co-operate on a specific topic, was proposed by twelve Member States to set up a unitary patent applicable in all participating European Union Member States.<ref name="Tait">Nikki Tait, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fa9b799a-0799-11e0-8d80-00144feabdc0.html#axzz18DVrohfy "Brussels backs ‘single European patent’ plan"], FT.com, 14 December 2010.

In early 2011, the procedure leading to the enhanced co-operation was reported to be progressing. Twenty-five Member States had written to the European Commission requesting to participate, with just Spain and Italy remaining outside, primarily on the basis of ongoing concerns over translation issues. On 15 February, the European Parliament approved the use of the enhanced co-operation procedure for unitary patent protection by a vote of 471 to 160.<ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/en/pressroom/content/20110215IPR13680/html/EU-patent-Parliament-gives-go-ahead-for-enhanced-cooperation European patent: Parliament gives go ahead for enhanced cooperation], European Parliament, published: 15 February 2011.

A common patent court called "Unified Patent Court" (UPC) is planned to be constituted, serving as the single court having exclusive jurisdiction in [[patent infringement|infringement]] and revocation proceedings involving European patents in the 25 participating states (both if individual countries are designated and for the EU patent).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/889924E4E28C5D0CC12578D3003F5046/$File/st11533_en.pdf |date=14 June 2011|work=Council of the European Union |accessdate=30 June 2012 |title=Draft agreement on a Unified Patent Court and draft Statute – Presidency text |quote=(...) the Unified Patent Court will be a court common to the Contracting Member States, thus situated within the judicial system of the European Union, with exclusive competence on their territories for European patents with unitary effect and European patents designating one or more Member States party to this Agreement}}</ref> The court would have two divisions: a court of first instance and a court of appeal.

== Costs ==
Translation requirements as well as the requirement to pay yearly patent fees in all countries in which a European patent is designated, presently renders the European patent system costly in the European Union. In an impact assessment the European Commission estimated that the costs of obtaining a patent in all 27 EU countries would drop from over 32 000 euro (mainly due to translation costs) to 6 500 euro (for the combination of an EU, Spanish and Italian patent) due to introduction of the EU patent. Per capita costs of an EU patent were estimated at just 6 euro/million in the participating 25 countries (and 12 euro/million in the 27 EU countries for protection with an EU, Italian and Spanish patent).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/indprop/docs/patent/sec2011-482-final_en.pdf|title=IMPACT ASSESSMENT Accompanying document to the Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection and Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection with regard to the applicable translation arrangements|work=European Commission|page=36|date=13 April 2012}}</ref>

How the EU Commission has presented the expected cost savings has however been sharply criticized as exaggerated and based on unrealistic assumptions. The EU Commission has notably considered the costs for validating a European patent in 27 countries while in reality only about 1% of all granted European patents are currently validated in all 27 contracting states. Based on more realistic assumptions, the cost savings are expected to be much lower than actually claimed by the Commission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.platow.de/eu-patent--kostenreduzierungen-deutlich-uebertrieben/4444686.html |title=EU-Patent – Kostenreduzierungen deutlich übertrieben |last=Rox |first=Thomas |date=June 5, 2013 |website=platow.de |language=German |trans_title=EU Patent - Cost reductions clearly exaggerated |accessdate=July 3, 2013}} </ref>

==Earlier attempts==

===1970s and 1980s: proposed Community Patent Convention===
Work on a Community patent started in the 1970s, but the resulting Community Patent Convention (CPC) was a failure.

The "[[Luxembourg]] Conference on the Community Patent" took place in 1975 and the '''Convention for the European Patent for the common market''', or (Luxembourg) Community Patent Convention (CPC), was signed at Luxembourg on 15 December 1975, by the 9 member states of the [[European Economic Community]] at that time. However the CPC never entered into force. It was not ratified by enough countries.

Fourteen years later, the '''Agreement relating to Community patents''' was made at Luxembourg on 15 December 1989. It attempted to revive the CPC project, but also failed. This Agreement consisted of an amended version of the original Community Patent Convention. Twelve states signed the Agreement: [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], France, Germany, [[Greece]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], Italy, [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], Spain, and United Kingdom. All of those states would need to have ratified the Agreement to cause it to enter into force,<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:41989A0695(01):EN:NOT 89/695/EEC: Agreement relating to Community patents, Done at Luxembourg on 15 December 1989, Article 10]</ref> but only seven did so: [[Denmark]], France, Germany, [[Greece]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], and United Kingdom.<ref>[[Official Journal of the European Patent Office]] 4/2006 p. 328 [http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/pubs/oj006/04_06/04_3086.pdf (pdf)]</ref> 

Nevertheless, a majority of member states of the EEC at that time introduced some harmonisation into their national patent laws in anticipation of the entry in force of the CPC. A more substantive harmonisation took place at around the same time to take account of the European Patent Convention and the [[Convention on the Unification of Certain Points of Substantive Law on Patents for Invention|Strasbourg Convention]].

===2000 to 2004: EU Regulation proposal===
In 2000, renewed efforts from the European Union resulted in a Community Patent [[European Union regulation|Regulation]] proposal, sometimes abbreviated as '''CPR'''. It provides that the patent, once it has been granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) in one of its procedural languages (English, German or French) and published in that language, with a translation of the claims into the two other procedural languages, will be valid without any further translation. This proposal is aimed to achieve a considerable reduction in translation costs.

Nevertheless, additional translations could become necessary in legal proceedings against a suspected infringer. In such a situation, a suspected infringer who has been unable to consult the text of the patent in the official language of the Member State in which he is domiciled, is presumed, until proven otherwise, not to have knowingly infringed the patent. To protect a suspected infringer who, in such a situation, has not acted in a deliberate manner, it is provided that the proprietor of the patent will not be able to obtain damages in respect of the period prior to the translation of the patent being notified to the infringer.

The proposed Community Patent Regulation should also establish a court holding exclusive jurisdiction to invalidate issued patents; thus, a Community Patent's validity will be the same in all EU member states. This court will be attached to the present [[European Court of Justice]] and [[Court of First Instance]] through use of provisions in the [[Treaty of Nice]].

Discussion regarding the Community patent had made clear progress in 2003 when a political agreement was reached on 3 March 2003. However, one year later in March 2004 under the Irish [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency]], the [[Council of the European Union#Configurations|Competitiveness Council]] failed to agree on the details of the Regulation. In particular the time delays for translating the claims and the authentic text of the claims in case of an infringement remained problematic issues throughout discussions and in the end proved insoluble.

In view of the difficulties in reaching an agreement on the community patent,<ref>Axel H. Horns, [http://www.ipjur.com/blog2/index.php?/archives/138-A-Unified-European-Patent-System-The-Historical-Perspective.html#extended A Unified European Patent System – The Historical Perspective], IP::JUR blog, 18 February 2010. Consulted on 20 February 2010.</ref> other legal agreements have been proposed outside the European Union legal framework to reduce the cost of translation (of patents when granted) and [[lawsuit|litigation]], namely the [[London Agreement (2000)|London Agreement]], which entered into force on 1 May 2008—and which has reduced the number of countries requiring translation of European patents granted nowadays under the European Patent Convention, and the corresponding costs to obtain a European patent<ref>Bruno van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, Malwina Mejer, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/f861125075v61964/ "The London Agreement and the cost of patenting in Europe"], [[European Journal of Law and Economics]], Vol. 29, Number 2, April 2010, pages 211–237.</ref>— and the [[European Patent Litigation Agreement]] (EPLA), a proposal that has now lapsed.

====Reactions to the failure====
[[Image:ProdiBari.jpg|right|thumb|[[Romano Prodi]] (here on a picture taken in 2006) cited the failure to agree on a Europewide patent as a weak point of his five-year term as [[President of the European Commission]].]]
After the council in March 2004, [[European Commission|EU Commissioner]] [[Frits Bolkestein]] said that "The failure to agree on the Community Patent I am afraid undermines the credibility of the whole enterprise to make Europe the most competitive economy in the world by 2010." Adding:

{{quote|It is a mystery to me how Ministers at the so-called 'Competitiveness Council' can keep a straight face when they adopt conclusions for the Spring European Council on making Europe more competitive and yet in the next breath backtrack on the political agreement already reached on the main principles of the Community Patent in March of last year. I can only hope that one day the vested, [[protectionism|protectionist]] interests that stand in the way of agreement on this vital measure will be sidelined by the over-riding importance and interests of European manufacturing industry and Europe's competitiveness. That day has not yet come.<ref>[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/04/58 Commission Press Communique, 12th March 2004, "Results of the Competitiveness Council of Ministers, Brussels, 11th March 2004 Internal Market, Enterprise and Consumer Protection issues"]</ref>}}

Jonathan Todd, Commission's Internal Market spokesman, declared:
{{quote|Normally, after the common political approach, the text of the regulation is agreed very quickly. Instead, some Member States appear to have changed their positions. (...) It is extremely unfortunate that European industry's competitiveness, innovation and R&D are being sacrificed for the sake of preserving narrow vested interests.<ref>[http://cordis.europa.eu/itt/itt-en/04-3/policy03.htm cordis.europa.eu, ''Patently unclear'', May 26, 2004]</ref>}}

European Commission President [[Romano Prodi]], asked to evaluate his five-year term, cites as his weak point the failure of many EU governments to implement the "[[Lisbon Agenda]]", agreed in 2001. In particular, he cited the failure to agree on a Europewide patent, or even the languages to be used for such a patent, "because member states did not accept a change in the rules; they were not coherent".<ref>[[Wall Street Journal]], 25 October 2004</ref>

====Support for the Regulation====
There is support for the Community patent from various quarters. From the point of view of the European Commission the Community Patent is an essential step towards creating a level playing field for trade within the European Union. For smaller businesses, if the Community patent achieves its aim of providing a relatively inexpensive way of obtaining patent protection across a wide trading area, then there is also support. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

For larger businesses, however, other issues come into play, which have tended to dilute overall support. In general, these businesses recognise that the current European Patent system provides the best possible protection given the need to satisfy national sovereignty requirements such as regarding translation and enforcement. The Community Patent proposal was generally supported if it would do away with both of these issues, but there was some concern about the level of competence of the proposed European Patent Court. A business would be reluctant to obtain a Europe-wide patent if it ran the risk of being revoked by an inexperienced judge. Also, the question of translations would not go away – unless the users of the system could see significant change in the position of some of the countries holding out for more of a patent specification to be translated on grant or before enforcement, it was understood that larger businesses (the bulk of the users of the patent system) would be unlikely to move away from the tried and tested European Patent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Since 2005: stalemate and new debate===
[[Image:Charlie McCreevy portrait.jpg|thumb|left|In 2007, [[Charlie McCreevy]] was quoted as saying that the proposal for an EU-wide patent was stuck in the [[mud]].]]
Thus, in 2005, the Community patent looked unlikely to be implemented in the near future. However, on 16 January 2006 the [[European Commission]] "launched a public consultation on how future action in patent policy to create an EU-wide system of protection can best take account of stakeholders' needs." The Community patent was one of the issues the consultation focused on.<ref>[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/38&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en European Commission, Internal Market, ''Commission asks industry and other stakeholders for their views on future patent policy'', Brussels, 16 January 2006,]</ref> More than 2500 replies were received.<ref name="Stakeholders debate"/> According to the European Commission, the consultation showed that there is widespread support for the Community patent but not at any cost, and "in particular not on the basis of the Common Political Approach reached by EU Ministers in 2003".<ref name="Stakeholders debate"/>

In February 2007, [[European Commission|EU Commissioner]] [[Charlie McCreevy]] was quoted as saying:
{{quote|The proposal for an EU-wide patent is stuck in the mud. It is clear to me from discussions with member states that there is no consensus at present on how to improve the situation.<ref>Chris Jones, [http://www.eupolitix.com/EN/News/200702/7be97fa5-3cb6-403f-aadf-103ad99a9950.htm ''McCreevy backs plans for single EU-US market''], TheParliament.com, February 1, 2007.

In October 2007, the Portuguese [[presidency of the Council of the European Union]] proposed an EU patent jurisdiction, "borrowing heavily from the rejected draft European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA)".<ref>Huw Jones, [http://www.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUSL1128205820071011 ''EU president Portugal proposes new patent courts''], Reuters, 11 October 2007.</ref> In November 2007, EU ministers were reported to have made some progress towards a community patent legal system, with "some specific results" expected in 2008.<ref>Huw Jones, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/feedarticle?id=7097030 ''Ministers make progress along road to EU patent'']{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}, [[The Guardian]], 22 November 2007.
