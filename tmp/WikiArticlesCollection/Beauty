'''Beauty'''  is a characteristic of a person, animal, [[Location (geography)|place]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], or [[idea]] that provides a [[perception|perceptual]] experience of [[pleasure]] or [[Contentment|satisfaction]].<ref>"beauty, n.". OED Online. December 2011. Oxford University Press. Retrieved February 11, 2012</ref> Beauty is studied as part of [[aesthetics]], [[sociology]], [[social psychology]], and culture. An "ideal beauty" is an entity which is admired, or possesses features widely attributed to beauty in a particular culture, for perfection.

The experience of "beauty" often involves an interpretation of some entity as being in balance and [[harmony]] with [[nature]], which may lead to feelings of [[sexual attraction|attraction]] and emotional well-being. Because this can be a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] experience, it is often said that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder."<ref name="phrase">{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/59100.html|title=Beauty is in the eye of the beholder|accessdate=December 4, 2007|publisher=The Phrase Finder|year=2007|author=Gary Martin| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071130023507/http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/59100.html| archivedate= November 30, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

There is evidence that perceptions of beauty are evolutionarily determined, that things, aspects of people and landscapes considered beautiful are typically found in situations likely to give enhanced survival of the perceiving human's genes.<ref>The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics</ref><ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty.html Denis Dutton: A Darwinian theory of beauty | Video on TED.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Etymology ==
The classical Greek noun for "beauty" was κάλλος, ''kallos'', and the adjective for "beautiful" was καλός, ''kalos''. The [[Koine Greek]] word for beautiful was ὡραῖος, ''hōraios'',<ref>Matthew 23:27, Acts 3:10, Flavius Josephus, 12.65</ref> an adjective etymologically coming from the word ὥρα, ''hōra'', meaning "hour". In Koine Greek, beauty was thus associated with "being of one's hour".<ref name="Euripides, Alcestis 515">Euripides, ''Alcestis'' 515.</ref> Thus, a ripe fruit (of its time) was considered beautiful, whereas a young woman trying to appear older or an older woman trying to appear younger would not be considered beautiful. In Attic Greek, ''hōraios'' had many meanings, including "youthful" and "ripe old age".<ref name="Euripides, Alcestis 515"/>

== Historical view of beauty ==
[[File:Cupola di santa maria del fiore dal campanile di giotto, 02.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Florence Cathedral]] and dome. Since the [[Renaissance]] in Europe, harmony, symmetry and correct proportions are considered essential elements of universal beauty.]]
There is evidence that a preference for beautiful faces emerges early in child development, and that the standards of attractiveness are similar across different genders and cultures.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190208 | author = Rhodes, G. | year = 2006 | title = The evolutionary psychology of facial beauty | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 57 | pages = 199–226 | pmid = 16318594 }}</ref> A study published in 2008 suggests that [[Facial symmetry|symmetry]] is also important because it suggests the absence of genetic or acquired defects.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3341719/Why-beauty-is-an-advert-for-good-genes.html Highfield, Roger.

Although [[Style (visual arts)|style]] and fashion vary widely, cross-cultural research has found a variety of commonalities in people's perception of beauty. The earliest Western theory of beauty can be found in the works of early Greek philosophers from the [[pre-Socratic]] period, such as [[Pythagoras]]. The Pythagorean school saw a strong connection between [[mathematics]] and beauty. In particular, they noted that objects proportioned according to the [[golden ratio]] seemed more attractive.<ref>Seife, Charles (2000). ''Zéro: the biography of a dangerous idea''. Penguin. ISBN 0-14-029647-6. p. 32</ref> [[Ancient Greek architecture]] is based on this view of symmetry and [[ratio|proportion]].

Plato considered beauty to be the Idea (Form) above all other Ideas.<ref>Phaedrus</ref> Aristotle saw a relationship between the beautiful (''to kalon'') and virtue, arguing that "Virtue aims at the beautiful."<ref>Nicomachean Ethics</ref>

[[Classical philosophy]] and sculptures of men and women produced according to the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]]' tenets of ideal human beauty were rediscovered in [[Renaissance]] Europe, leading to a re-adoption of what became known as a "classical ideal". In terms of female human beauty, a woman whose [[human physical appearance|appearance]] conforms to these tenets is still called a "classical beauty" or said to possess a "classical beauty", whilst the foundations laid by Greek and Roman artists have also supplied the standard for male beauty in western civilization.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} During the Gothic era, the classical aesthetical canon of beauty was rejected as sinful. Later, the [[Renaissance]] and [[Humanism]] rejected this view, and considered beauty as a product of rational order and harmony of proportions. Renaissance artists and architect (such as [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his "lives of artists") criticised the Gothic period as irrational and barbarian. This point of view over [[Gothic art]] lasted until Romanticism, in the 19th century.

The Age of Reason saw a rise in an interest in beauty as a philosophical subject. For example, Scottish philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] argued that beauty is "unity in variety and variety in unity".<ref>An Inquiry Into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue; In Two Treatises</ref> The Romantic poets, too, became highly concerned with the [[nature (philosophy)|nature]] of beauty, with [[John Keats]] arguing in "Ode on a Grecian Urn" that

:  Beauty is truth, truth beauty ,—that is all.
:  Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

In the Romantic period, [[Edmund Burke]] postulated a difference between beauty in its classical meaning and the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. The concept of the sublime, as explicated by Burke and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], suggested viewing Gothic art and architecture, though not in accordance with the classical standard of beauty, as sublime.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The 20th century saw an increasing rejection of beauty by artists and philosophers alike, culminating in [[postmodernism]]'s anti-aesthietics.<ref>The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture by Hal Foster</ref> This is despite beauty being a central concern of one of postmodernism's main influences, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who argued that the Will to Power was the Will to Beauty.<ref>The Will to Power</ref>

In the aftermath of postmodernism's rejection of beauty, thinkers have returned to beauty as an important value. American analytic philosopher [[Guy Sircello]] proposed his New Theory of Beauty as an effort to reaffirm the status of beauty as an important philosophical concept.<ref>A New Theory of Beauty. Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975.</ref><ref>Love and Beauty. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989.</ref> Elaine Scarry also argues that beauty is related to justice.<ref>On Beauty and Being Just</ref>

{{Main|Physical attractiveness}}

The characterization of a person as “beautiful”, whether on an individual basis or by community consensus, is often based on some combination of ''inner beauty'', which includes psychological factors such as [[Personality type|personality]], [[intelligence]], [[wiktionary:Grace|grace]], [[politeness]], [[charisma]], [[integrity]], [[wikt:congruence|congruence]] and [[elegance]], and ''outer beauty'' (i.e. [[physical attractiveness]]) which includes physical attributes which are valued on an aesthetic basis.

Standards of beauty have changed over time, based on changing cultural values. Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty. However, humans who are relatively young, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and regular features, have traditionally been considered the most beautiful throughout history.

A strong indicator of physical beauty is "[[averageness]]", or "[[koinophilia]]".{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} When images of human faces are averaged together to form a composite image, they become progressively closer to the "ideal" image and are perceived as more attractive. This was first noticed in 1883, when [[Francis Galton]], cousin of [[Charles Darwin]], overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each. When doing this, he noticed that the composite images were more attractive compared to any of the individual images.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Researchers have replicated the result under more controlled conditions and found that the computer generated, mathematical average of a series of faces is rated more favorably than individual faces.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1994.tb00503.x | author = Langlois, J.

A feature of beautiful women that has been explored by researchers is a [[waist–hip ratio]] of approximately 0.70. Physiologists have shown that women with [[Female body shape|hourglass figures]] are more fertile than other women due to higher levels of certain female hormones, a fact that may subconsciously condition males choosing mates.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-300862/Born-mothers-curvy-hips.html |title=Born mothers have curvy hips &#124; Mail Online |work=Daily Mail |accessdate=2010-05-31 | location=London | first=Tim | last=Utton| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100626015506/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-300862/Born-mothers-curvy-hips.html| archivedate= June 26, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The concept of beauty in men is known as '[[bishōnen]]' in Japan. Bishōnen refers to males with distinctly [[Femininity|feminine]] features, physical characteristics establishing the standard of beauty in Japan and typically exhibited in their [[pop culture]] [[Japanese idol|idols]]. A multi-billion-dollar industry of [[Japanese Aesthetic Salons]] exists for this reason.

==Effects on society==

Beauty presents a standard of [[social comparison theory|comparison]], and it can cause resentment and dissatisfaction when not achieved. People who do not fit the "beauty ideal" may be ostracized within their communities. The television sitcom ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' portrays the life of a girl faced with hardships due to society's unwelcoming attitudes toward those they deem unattractive. However, a person may also be targeted for harassment because of their beauty. In ''[[Malèna]]'', a strikingly beautiful Italian woman is forced into poverty by the women of the community who refuse to give her work for fear that she may "woo" their husbands. The documentary ''[[Beauty in the Eyes of the Beheld]]'' explores both the societal blessings and curses of female beauty through interviews of women considered beautiful.

Researchers have found that good looking students get higher grades from their teachers than students with an ordinary appearance.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sharon Begley|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/206597 |title=The Link Between Beauty and Grades |work=Newsweek |date=14 July 2009 |accessdate=2010-05-31| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100529040414/http://www.newsweek.com/id/206597| archivedate= May 29, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Some studies using mock criminal trials have shown that physically attractive "defendants" are less likely to be convicted—and if convicted are likely to receive lighter sentences—than less attractive ones (although the opposite effect was observed when the alleged crime was swindling, perhaps because jurors perceived the defendant's attractiveness as facilitating the crime).<ref>Amina A Memon, Aldert Vrij, Ray Bull (2003).

How much money a person earns may also be influenced by physical beauty. One study found that people low in physical attractiveness earn 5 to 10 percent less than ordinary looking people, who in turn earn 3 to 8 percent less than those who are considered good looking.<ref>Lorenz, K.

[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] said of beauty "Beauty is indeed a good gift of God; but that the good may not think it a great good, God dispenses it even to the wicked."<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XV.22.html City of God Book 15 Chapter 22]</ref>

==Ugliness==
'''Ugliness''' is a property of a person or thing that is unpleasant to look upon and results in a highly unfavorable evaluation. To be ugly is to be aesthetically unattractive, repulsive, or offensive.<ref>''Webster's New World College Dictionary'', 3rd edition, 1995.</ref>

People who appear ugly to others suffer well-documented discrimination, earning 10 to 15 percent less per year than similar workers, and are less likely to be hired for almost any job, but lack legal recourse to fight discrimination.<ref name=times-ugly-1>{{cite news|last=Hamermesh|first=Daniel|title=Ugly?

For some people, ugliness is a central aspect of their persona. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] had a lazy eye and a bloated, asymmetrical face, and he attributed many of his philosophical ideas to his lifelong struggle to come to terms with his self-described ugliness.<ref name="nyt ugly">{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/the-phenomenology-of-ugly/|title=The Phenomenology of Ugly|last=Martin|first=Andy|date=August 10, 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 24, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100815234258/http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/the-phenomenology-of-ugly/?| archivedate= August 15, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Socrates]] also used his ugliness as a philosophical touch point, concluding that philosophy can save us from our outward ugliness.<ref name="nyt ugly" /> Famous in his own time for his perceived ugliness, [[Abraham Lincoln]] was described by a contemporary: "to say that he is ugly is nothing; to add that his figure is grotesque, is to convey no adequate impression." However, his looks proved to be an asset in his personal and political relationships, as his law partner [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]] wrote, "He was not a pretty man by any means, nor was he an ugly one; he was a homely man, careless of his looks, plain-looking and plain-acting. He had no pomp, display, or dignity, so-called. He appeared simple in his carriage and bearing. He was a sad-looking man; his melancholy dripped from him as he walked. His apparent gloom impressed his friends, and created sympathy for him—one means of his great success."<ref name="carpenter lincoln">{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=F.

In June 2013 the comedian [[Angela Barnes]] became noted for an article in [[The Guardian]], in it she  spoke about how she felt society treated people deemed [[Beauty#Ugliness|ugly]] and her feelings as someone who self-identified as such.<ref>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/28/ugly-proud-of-it</ref>
