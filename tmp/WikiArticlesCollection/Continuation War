{{Campaignbox Continuation War}}

The '''Continuation War''' ({{lang-fi|jatkosota}}; {{lang-sv|fortsättningskriget}}; 25 June 1941 – 19 September 1944) refers to  the hostilities between [[Finland]] and the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War&nbsp;II]], from 1941 to 1944.

At the time of the war, the Finns adopted this name to make clear this war's perceived relationship to the preceding [[Winter War]].<ref name=lavery>{{cite book|title=The history of Finland|page=126|first=Jason Edward|last=Lavery|publisher=Greenwood Press}}</ref> The Soviet Union saw the war as part of its struggle against [[Nazi Germany]] and [[The Axis|its allies]], as the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front of World War&nbsp;II]]. The war was known in the Soviet Union as the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]].<ref name="Great Soviet Encyclopedia">[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], ''Finland'', Moscow, 1974. ISBN 0-02-880010-9</ref> Germany regarded its operations in the region as part of its overall war efforts on the Eastern front, and it provided Finland with critical material support and military cooperation.

Acts of war between the two countries started on 22 June 1941, the day Germany launched its [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]]. Open warfare began with a Soviet air offensive on 25 June. Subsequent Finnish operations undid its post [[Winter War]] concessions to the Soviet Union on the [[Finnish reconquest of the Karelian Isthmus (1941)|Karelian Isthmus]] and [[Finnish reconquest of Ladoga Karelia (1941)|Ladoga Karelia]], and [[Finnish conquest of East Karelia (1941)|captured East Karelia]] by September 1941. On the [[Karelian Isthmus]], the Finns halted their offensive 30&nbsp;km from Leningrad, at the pre World War&nbsp;II border between the Soviet Union and Finland. Finnish forces did not participate in the [[siege of Leningrad]] directly, holding their pre World War&nbsp;II territory on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] for two and a half years instead.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Siege of Leningrad, Ballantines Illustrated History of WWII |last=Wykes |first=Alan |year=1972 |publisher= |location= |isbn=  |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The World War&nbsp;II Desk Reference |last=Brinkley |first=Douglas |editor-last=Haskey |editor-first=M. |year=2004 |publisher=Grand Central Press |location= |isbn= |page=210 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name=Baryshnikov>[[#Baryshnikov|Baryshnikov (2002)]]</ref> In 1944, Soviet air forces [[Bombing of Helsinki in World War II|conducted air raids on Helsinki]] and other major Finnish cities. Eventually, in summer 1944, the Soviet [[Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive|strategic offensive]] drove the Finns from most of the territories they had gained during the war, but the Finnish Army later fought the offensive to a standstill in July 1944. A ceasefire ended hostilities on 5 September and was followed by the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September. The [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|1947 Paris peace treaty]] concluded the war formally. Finland ceded [[Petsamo Province|Petsamo]] to the Soviets, leased [[Porkkala]] to them, and [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|paid $226 500 000 in reparations to the Soviet Union]], while ultimately retaining its independence.

==Background==

===Winter War===
{{Main|Background of the Winter War|Winter War}}

[[File:Finn ski troops.jpg|thumb|Finnish ski troops in Northern Finland on 12 January 1940]]

On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] whereby the parties divided the independent countries of Finland, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Polish Second Republic|Poland]], and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] into [[spheres of interest]], with Finland falling to the Soviet sphere of interest.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-30">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 30</ref> Shortly afterward, Germany [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded Poland]] so the [[United Kingdom]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] declared war against Germany. The Soviet Union [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded eastern Poland]] on 17 September.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-31">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 31</ref> Next, Moscow demanded that the [[Baltic states]] allow the establishment of Soviet military bases and the stationing of troops on their soil. The Baltic governments [[Background of the occupation and annexation of the Baltic states|accepted these ultimatums]], signing corresponding agreements in September and October 1939.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-33">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 33</ref>

In October 1939, the Soviet Union attempted to negotiate with Finland for the transfer of Finnish territories on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] and the islands of the [[Gulf of Finland]] to the Soviet Union and for the establishment of a Soviet military base near the Finnish capital [[Helsinki]].<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-39">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 39</ref> The Finnish government refused, and the [[Red Army]] attacked Finland on 30 November 1939.<ref name= "Vehvilainen2002-44">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 44</ref> Condemnation of the Soviets by the [[League of Nations]] and by countries all over the world had no effect on Soviet policy.<ref name= "Vehvilainen2002-49">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 49</ref> [[Foreign support in the Winter War|International help for Finland]] was planned, but very little actual help materialized, except from Sweden.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-65">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 65</ref> The [[Moscow Peace Treaty (1940)|Moscow Peace Treaty]], which was signed on 12 March 1940, ended the Winter War.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-69">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 69</ref> By the terms of the treaty, Finland lost one eleventh of its national territory and about 13% of its economic capacity.<ref name="Kirby2006-215">[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 215</ref> However, Finland had avoided having the Soviet Union annex the whole country.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-70">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 70</ref>

===Interim peace===
[[File:Finnish flag at half-mast interim pece helsinki 1940.jpg|thumb|Finnish flags are at [[half-mast]] after the publication of the peace terms]]
{{Main|Interim Peace}}

Finland's foreign policy had been based on [[multilateralism|multilateral]] guarantees for support from the [[League of Nations]] and [[Nordic countries]] and was considered a failure.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-74">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 74</ref> Finnish public opinion favored the reconquest of [[Finnish Karelia]]. Finland's government declared the country's defense to be its first priority, and military expenditures rose to nearly half of government spending. Finland purchased and received donations of war materiel during and immediately after the Winter War. On Finland's southern frontier the Soviet Union had acquired a military base in [[Hanko]] near the capital [[Helsinki]], which employed over 30,000 Soviet military personnel.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-75">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 75</ref>

Finland also had to resettle [[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|some 420,000 evacuees from the lost territories]]. To ensure the supply of food, it was necessary to clear new land for the evacuees to cultivate.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-75"/> This was facilitated by the [[Rapid Settlement Act]]. The Finnish leadership wanted to preserve the [[Spirit of the Winter War|spirit of unanimity]] that was commonly felt throughout the country during the Winter War. The divisive [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guard]] tradition of the [[Finnish Civil War|Civil War]] 16 May victory day celebration was therefore discontinued.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-76">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 76</ref> Relations between Finland and the Soviet Union remained strained despite the signing of the one-sided peace treaty, and there were disputes regarding the implementation of the conditions of the treaty. Finland sought security against further territorial depredations by the Soviet Union and proposed [[Mutual Defense Treaty|mutual defence agreements]] with [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], but these initiatives were quashed by Moscow.<ref name= "Vehvilainen2002-77">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 77</ref><ref name= "Kirby2006-216">[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 216</ref>

===German and Soviet expansion in Europe===
After the Winter War, Germany was not popular in Finland as it was considered an ally of the Soviet Union. However, the Finnish government began to restore diplomatic relations with Germany. Finland continued its Western-orientated policy and negotiated a war trade agreement with the [[United Kingdom]],<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-77"/> but the agreement was renounced after the [[Operation Weserübung|German invasion of Denmark and Norway]] on 9 April, when Britain cut all trade and traffic communications with [[Scandinavia]]. With the [[Battle of France|fall of France]], a policy of Western orientation was no longer considered an option in Finnish foreign policy.<ref name= "Vehvilainen2002-78">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 78</ref> On 15 and 16 June, the Soviet Union [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupied the Baltic states]] without resistance. Soviet [[Puppet state|Puppet regimes]] were installed; and within two months Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were incorporated as Soviet Republics within the Soviet Union.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-79">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 79</ref> By mid-1940, the two remaining northern democracies, Finland and [[Sweden]], were encircled by the totalitarian states of Germany and the Soviet Union.

On 23 June, a short time after the Soviet occupations of the Baltic states began, the Soviet foreign minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] contacted the Finns and demanded a mining licence for the Soviet Union at the [[nickel]] mines in [[Pechenga (urban-type settlement), Murmansk Oblast|Petsamo]] or alternately the establishing of a joint Soviet-Finnish company to operate there. The licence to mine the deposit had earlier been granted to a British-Canadian company, and the proposition was rejected. The next month, the Soviets demanded that Finland destroy the fortifications built in the Åland islands and give the Soviets the right to use Finnish railways to transport Soviet troops to the newly acquired Soviet base at Hanko. The Finns very reluctantly agreed to these demands.<ref name= "Vehvilainen2002-80">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 80</ref> On 24 July, Molotov accused the Finnish government of persecuting the so-called [[Finland – Soviet Union Peace and Friendship Society|Society for Peace and Friendship between Finland and USSR]], a pro-communist group; and soon afterwards, he publicly supported this group. The society organized demonstrations, some of which turned into riots.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-81">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 81</ref><ref name="Kirby2006-218">[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 218</ref>

===Finnish relations with Germany and the USSR===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-1206-523, Berlin, Verabschiedung Molotows.jpg|thumb|German [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] bidding farewell to Soviet [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] in Berlin on 14 November 1940.]]

On 31 July 1940, the German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] gave the order to start planning an assault on the Soviet Union. This meant that Germany had to reassess its positions regarding both Finland and [[Romania]]. Until then, Germany had rejected Finnish appeals to purchase arms, but in August the Germans allowed the secret sale of weapons to Finland. German and Finnish military authorities made an agreement on 12 September, and an official exchange of diplomatic notes was sent on 22 September. At the same time, German troops were [[Transit of German troops through Scandinavia (World War II)|allowed to transit]] through Sweden and Finland.<ref name="Kirby2006-220">[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 220</ref> In practice, this meant Germany had redrawn the border of German and Soviet spheres of influence.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-83">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 83</ref>

Due to the changed situation, Molotov made a visit to [[Berlin]] on 12–13 November.<ref name= "Kirby2006-219">[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 219</ref> He wanted Germany to withdraw its troops from Finland and stop enabling Finnish anti-Soviet sentiments. He also reminded the Germans of the 1939 Soviet–German non-aggression pact. Hitler asked how the Soviet Union planned to settle the "Finnish question". Molotov answered that it would happen in the same manner as in [[Bessarabia]] and the Baltic states. Hitler rejected this.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-84">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 84</ref> The following December, the Soviet Union, Germany, and the United Kingdom all voiced opinions concerning suitable Finnish presidential candidates. [[Risto Ryti]] was the only candidate none of these three meddling powers objected to. He was elected on 19 December.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-85">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 85</ref>

In January 1941, the Soviet Union demanded to take control of the Petsamo mining area. Finland rejected this, as it by then had a rebuilt defense force and was encouraged by Germany to reject the Soviet demand.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-85"/> On 18 December 1940, Hitler had officially approved [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the Soviet Union.<ref name="Kirby2006-221">[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 221</ref> He expected both Finland and Romania to join the German campaign.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-86">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 86</ref> Two days earlier, Finnish Major General [[Paavo Talvela]] had met German Colonel General [[Franz Halder]] and, a couple days later, [[Reichsmarschall]] [[Hermann Göring]], in Berlin. This was the first time the Germans advised the Finns, in carefully couched diplomatic terms, that they were preparing for a war with the Soviet Union. Outlines of the actual plan were revealed in January 1941 and regular contacts between Finnish and German military leaders started from February.<ref name= "Vehvilainen2002-86"/>

In late spring 1941, the Soviet Union made a number of goodwill gestures in order to prevent Finland from completely falling under German influence. Soviet ambassador [[Ivan Zotov]] was replaced with the more flexible [[Pavel Orlov (diplomat)|Pavel Orlov]]. Furthermore, the Soviet government announced that it no longer opposed a rapprochement between Finland and Sweden. However, these conciliatory measures did not have any effect on Finnish policy.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-87">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 87</ref>

==Path to war==

===Finnish-German agreement===
On 20 May, the Germans invited some Finnish officers to Germany to discuss the coordination of Operation Barbarossa. The participants met on 25–28 May in [[Salzburg]] and Berlin, and continued their meeting in [[Helsinki]] from 3 to 6 June. They agreed upon the arrival of German troops, Finnish mobilization, and general division of operations.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-87"/> They also agreed that the Finnish Army would start [[mobilization]] on 15 June, but the Germans did not reveal the final date for the assault. The Finnish decisions were made by a small group of political and military leaders, and the rest of the government was largely kept in the dark. The government was not informed until 9 June that the country would start mobilization of [[reservist]]s due to tensions between Germany and the Soviet Union.<ref name="Kirby2006-221"/>

===Deployments and pre-assaults===
[[File:Continuation War July 1941 English.jpg|thumb|Finnish, German, and Soviet troops at the start of the Continuation War in June/July 1941. The Germans began their assault on 29 June from [[Petsamo]] area, and the Finns attacked on 1 July from [[Suomussalmi]] and [[Kuusamo]] area.]]

The Germans took responsibility for the {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} stretch of the front in northern Finland consisting of [[Lapland (Finland)|Finnish Lapland]]. The Finnish army was now much stronger than it had been during the Winter War, now boasting 475,000 men. The [[artillery]], too, was relatively strong. However, there was only one [[tank]] battalion and a lack of motorized transportation.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-90">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 90</ref>

At the beginning of the war, the Soviet Union had eighteen divisions in the region, against fifteen Finnish and four German divisions. The Finns enjoyed [[air supremacy]]. Furthermore, the Soviet Union needed its best units and most up-to-date [[materiel]] on its western front.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-91">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 91</ref>

The German troops assaulted the Soviet Union on 22 June elsewhere but not from Finland. However, German minelayers hiding in the [[Archipelago Sea]] laid two large minefields across the [[Gulf of Finland]] in the late hours of 21 June.<ref name="Nordberg">{{fi icon}} Nordberg, Erkki, ''Arvio ja ennuste Venäjän sotilaspolitiikasta Suomen suunnalla'', 2003, ISBN 951-884-362-7</ref><ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica Premium, 2006, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/207424/Finland ''Finland'']</ref> Later the same night, German bombers flew along the [[Gulf of Finland]] to Leningrad and mined the harbour and the river [[Neva]]. On the return trip, these bombers landed for refueling on an airfield in [[Utti]]. In the early hours of 22 June, Finnish forces launched [[Operation Kilpapurjehdus]], which aimed to man the demilitarized [[Åland Islands]]. An international treaty on the status of the islands called for Finland to defend them in case of the threat of an attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/sopimukset/sopsteksti/1922/19220001 |title=Ahvenanmaansaarten linnoittamattomuutta ja puolueettomuutta koskeva sopimus. |date=28.01.1922 |publisher=Finlex – Finnish legislation|quote=7th Article, section II. If a surprise attack against Åland or against the Finnish mainland via Åland could place the neutrality of the zone in jeopardy, Finland must take necessary precautions in the zone to halt or ward off the attacker...|accessdate=3 August 2011}}</ref> However, the operation was coordinated with the Nazi invasion, and the Soviet consulate there was arrested. According to Finnish historian [[Mauno Jokipii]], Finland knew that it had violated international norms.<ref name=Jokipii-282>[[#Jokipii|Jokipii 1999]], p. 282</ref>

On 21 June, Finnish units began to concentrate at the Finnish-Soviet border, where they were arranged into defensive formations. Finland mobilised 16 infantry divisions, one cavalry brigade, and two [[Jäger (military)|jäger]] brigades, which were all standard infantry brigades, except for an armoured battalion in the 1st [[Jaeger Brigade|Jäger Brigade]]. Separate battalions were mostly formed from border guard units and were used mainly for reconnaissance. Soviet military plans estimated that Finland would be able to mobilise only ten infantry divisions, as it had done in the Winter War, but they failed to take into account the materiel Finland had purchased between the wars and its training of all available men. Two German mountain divisions were stationed at [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] and two infantry divisions at [[Salla]]. On the morning of 22 June, the German Mountain Corps Norway [[Operation Renntier|began its advance]] from northern Norway to Petsamo. Finland did not allow direct German attacks from its soil into the Soviet Union. On the same day, another German infantry division was moved from Oslo to face [[Ladoga Karelia]].

The Karelian Isthmus was covered by the [[23rd Army (Soviet Union)|23rd Army]]. Ladoga Karelia was defended by the [[7th Army (Soviet Union)|7th Army]]. In the [[Murmansk]]–[[Salla]] region, there was the [[14th Army (Soviet Union)|14th Army]] with  the 42nd Corps. The Red Army also had around 40 battalions of separate regiments and fortification units present. Leningrad was garrisoned by three infantry divisions and one mechanized corps. As the initial devastating German strike against the Soviet Air Force had not affected air units located near Finland, the Soviets deployed 700 planes as well as some aircraft from the [[Soviet Navy|Navy]] against 300 Finnish planes.<ref name=Jokipii-301>[[#Jokipii|Jokipii 1999]], p. 301</ref>

==1941: Finnish offensive==
[[File:Continuation War December 1941 English.jpg|thumb|The front in December 1941]]

On the morning of 25 June, the Soviet Union launched an air offensive of 460 fighters and bombers targeting 19 airfields in Finland; however, inaccurate intelligence and poor bombing accuracy caused several raids to hit Finnish cities or municipalities.<ref name="hazanov-db2">{{cite book |last1=Хазанов |first1=Дмитрий Борисович |title= 1941.

===Reconquest of the Karelian Isthmus===
[[File:Viipuri recaptured.jpg|thumb|right|Finnish military parade in Viborg on 31 August 1941, after its recapture]]

The Finnish II Corps (II&nbsp;AK) started its offensive in the region of the Karelian Isthmus on 31 July.<ref name="lunde-167">[[#Lunde|Lunde (2011)]] p. 167-172</ref><ref name="rajajoki">{{cite web |url=http://rajajoki.com/attack.htm |title=1941: Germany attacks, Finland follows |date=13 April 2005 |accessdate=28 October 2011 }}</ref> Finnish troops reached the shores of Lake Ladoga on 9 August, surrounding most of three defending Soviet divisions on the northwestern coast of the lake, from where the Soviet divisions were evacuated across the lake.

The badly mauled defending Soviet army was unable to halt the Finnish offensive, and by 2 September the Finns had reached the 1939 border along its whole length. On 31 August, Finnish headquarters ordered the offensive of the 2nd and 4th Army Corps, which had advanced the furthest, to halt their offensive after reaching a line just past the former border which ran from the mouth of the [[River Sestra]] via Retukylä, Aleksandrovka, and the eastern edge of the village of S.

===Conquest of East Karelia===
{{Main|Finnish conquest of East Karelia (1941)}}

The Finnish offensive in East Karelia started in early July in the northern section of the front. In early September, the attack in the northern section reached Rukajärvi (Ругозеро, Rugozero) village and Finnish headquarters halted the offensive there. On August 27, Finnish headquarters ordered the offensive in the south to reach the [[Svir River]]. Finnish troops cut the Kirov railroad on 7 September, crossed the Svir on 15 September, and then halted the offensive. Advance troops reached the shores of [[Lake Onega]] on 24 September. The town of [[Petrozavodsk]] was captured on 1&nbsp;October after the Soviets withdrew to avoid encirclement. On 6 November, the Finnish headquarters ordered their forces to capture [[Medvezhyegorsk|Karhumäki]] and then move to defense. The Finnish forces captured the area of [[Medvezhyegorsk|Karhumäki]] and [[Povenets]], and halted the offensive in early December.

Related to the Finnish advance to the Svir, the German Army Group North advanced from the south towards the Svir River and managed to capture [[Tikhvin]] before Soviet counterattacks forced the Germans to withdraw to the [[Volkhov River]]. Soviet forces also made several attempts to force the Finns out from their [[bridgehead]] south of the Svir during October and December 1941; however, the Soviet efforts to reduce the bridgehead were blocked by the Finns. Soviet forces also attacked the German [[163rd Infantry Division (Germany)|163rd Division]], which was operating under Finnish command, across the Svir in October 1941; but the Soviet forces that had crossed the river were pushed back soon after.<ref name="raunio_kilin_2">{{cite book |title= Jatkosodan torjuntataisteluja 1942–44 |trans_title=Defensive battles of Continuation War 1942–44|language=Finnish| last1=Raunio |first1=Ari |last2=Kilin |first2=Juri |year=2008 |publisher=Otavan Kirjapaino Oy |location=Keuruu |isbn=978-951-593-070-5 |pages=10–11}}</ref>

===Operation Silver Fox in the North===
{{Main|Operation Silver Fox}}

The German objective in northern Finland was to take [[Murmansk]] and seize control of the [[Murman Railway]]. Murmansk was the only year-round [[ice-free port]] in the north, and it was a threat to the nickel mine at Petsamo. [[Operation Silver Fox]] was run by the German [[Army Norway (Wehrmacht)|AOK Norwegen]] and had two Finnish divisions under its command. The German soldiers were from central Europe and they had difficulties moving over a roadless terrain of [[swamp]] and [[forest]]. Troops managed to advance some distance with heavy casualties, but the terrain offered good defensive positions for the Soviet resistance.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-95">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 95</ref>

The order for German–Finnish troops to move to defensive operations was given on 17 November, when attempts to reach the Murmansk Railway had failed.

===Naval campaign===
{{Further|Baltic Sea Campaigns (1939–1945)}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MN-2787-30, Baltikum, gesunkenes russisches Schiff.jpg|thumb|Soviet troop transporter nearly sunk by German mines on 3 December 1941 in the [[Gulf of Finland|Finnish Gulf]] during the Hanko evacuation]]

Although the Soviet [[Baltic Fleet|Red Banner Baltic fleet]] started the war in a strong position, German naval mine warfare and aerial supremacy, and the rapid advance by the German land forces forced the Soviet Navy to evacuate its bases to [[Kronstadt]] and [[Leningrad]]. The Soviets' evacuations from [[Soviet evacuation of Tallinn|Tallinn]] and [[Battle of Hanko (1941)|Hanko]] proved to be very costly operations for them. As the Soviet Navy withdrew to the eastern end of the [[Gulf of Finland]], it left nearly the whole [[Baltic Sea]] as well as many of the islands to the [[Kriegsmarine|Germans]] and [[Finnish Navy|Finns]]. Although Soviet submarines caused some threat to German traffic on the Baltic, the withdrawal of the Soviet Navy made the Baltic Sea a "German lake" until the second half of 1944. Although the Soviet Navy left in a hurry, the naval mines it had managed to lay before and during the evacuations caused casualties both to the Germans and the Finns, including the loss of one of the two Finnish coastal defence ships, the {{Ship|Finnish coastal defence ship|Ilmarinen||2}}.

===Political development===
Germany's main forces advanced rapidly deep into Soviet territory during the first weeks of the campaign. The Finns believed the Germans would defeat the Soviet Union quickly. President Ryti envisioned [[Greater Finland]], where the country and other [[Finnic people]] would live inside a "natural defence borderline" by incorporating the [[Kola Peninsula]], [[East Karelia]], and perhaps even northern [[Ingria]]. In public the proposed frontier was introduced by the slogan "A short border – a long peace".<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-92">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 92</ref> Some members of the Finnish parliament, such as the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]] and the [[Swedish People's Party of Finland|Swedish People's Party]], opposed the idea, arguing that maintaining the 1939 frontier would be enough.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-92"/> On July 10, Finnish Commander-in-Chief [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|C.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;E. Mannerheim]] gave an order of the day, the [[Sword scabbard declaration]], in which he pledged to liberate Karelia. The Finnish government assured the Americans that it was unaware of the order.<ref name="Kirby2006-224">[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 224</ref>

Finland had prepared for a short war, but in late autumn it was clear that there would be no decisive outcome in the short term. Finnish troops suffered losses during their advance; and, overall, German victory became uncertain as German troops were [[Battle of Moscow|halted near Moscow]]. The Finnish economy suffered from a lack of labour, food shortages, and increased prices. The Finnish government had to demobilize part of the army so that industrial and agricultural production would not collapse.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-96">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 96</ref> In October, Finland informed Germany that it would need {{convert|175000|ST|t|lk=on|abbr=on}} of [[grain]]s to manage until next year's harvest. The German authorities would have rejected the request, but Hitler himself agreed. Annual grain deliveries {{convert|200000|ST|t|abbr=on}} amounted to almost one-half of the Finnish domestic crop. In November, Finland decided to join the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]].<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-101">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 101</ref> The advance in East Karelia was halted on 6 December. The Finns had suffered 75,000 casualties, of whom 25,000 were Finnish deaths during the advance.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-96"/>

===Finland and Western allies===
Finland worked to maintain good relations with the Western powers. The Finnish government stressed that Finland was fighting as a co-belligerent with Germany against the Soviet Union only to protect itself.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-96"/> Furthermore, Finland stressed that it was still the same democratic country as it had been in the Winter War. However, on 12 July 1941, the United Kingdom had signed an agreement of joint action with the Soviet Union. Furthermore, under German pressure, Finland had to close the British [[legation]] in Helsinki. As a result, diplomatic relations between Finland and the United Kingdom were broken on 1&nbsp;August.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-97">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 97</ref> On 28 November, Britain presented Finland an ultimatum, in which it demanded that Finland cease military operations by 3 December.<ref name= "Vehvilainen2002-99"/> Unofficially, Finland informed the Western powers that troops would halt their advance in the next few days. The reply did not satisfy the United Kingdom, which declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941. The [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth member states]] of [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[India]], and [[New Zealand]] followed.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-100">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 100</ref>{{#tag:ref|See also the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]].|group="Notes"}}

Relations between Finland and the [[United States]] were more complex; the American public was sympathetic to the "brave little democracy", and there were anti-communist feelings. At first, the United States empathised with the Finnish cause; however, the situation became problematic after Finnish troops crossed the 1939 border. Finnish and German troops were a threat to the [[Murmansk Railway]] and northern communication supply line between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-98">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 98</ref> On 25 October 1941, the United States demanded that Finland cease all hostilities against the Soviet Union and withdraw behind the 1939 border. In public, President Ryti rejected the demands, but in private he wrote to Mannerheim on 5 November 1941 asking him to halt the offensive. Mannerheim agreed and secretly instructed General [[Hjalmar Siilasvuo]] to break off the assault against the Murmansk Railway.<ref name ="Vehvilainen2002-99">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 99</ref>

==1942–43: Trench warfare==
[[File:Continuation War 1942 and Soviet assaults English.jpg|thumb|Trench warfare of the Continuation War in 1942; the Soviets made four major assaults, which all were repelled.]]

===Military operations===
{{See also|Baltic Sea Campaigns (1939–1945)|Siege of Leningrad}}

Although military operations during 1942 and 1943 were limited, the front did see some action. In early 1942, Soviet Karelian Front forces attempted to retake [[Medvezhyegorsk]], which had been lost to the Finns in late 1941. As spring came, the Soviet forces also went on the offensive on the [[Svir River|Svir]] front as well as in Kiestinki region. All Soviet offensives started promisingly, but due either to the Soviets overextending their lines or stubborn defensive resistance, the Soviet offensives were stopped and repulsed. After Finnish and German counterattacks in Kiestinki, the eventual front lines had moved very little. In September 1942, the Soviets tried again at [[Kriv]] near [[Medvezhyegorsk]], but despite five days of fighting, the Soviets managed to push the Finnish lines back only {{convert|500|m|yd|abbr=on}} on a roughly {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}}-long stretch of the front.<ref>{{cite book |title= Jatkosodan torjuntataisteluja 1942–44 |trans_title=Defensive battles of Continuation War 1942–44|language=Finnish| last1=Raunio |first1=Ari |last2=Kilin |first2=Juri |year=2008 |publisher=Otavan Kirjapaino Oy |location=Keuruu |isbn=978-951-593-070-5 |pages=76–81}}</ref>

Unconventional warfare was fought in both the Finnish and Soviet wilderness. Finnish [[LRRP]]s organized both by Finnish HQ—4th Separate Battalion (Er.P 4)—and by local units patrolled beyond Soviet lines. In summer 1942, the Soviet Union had formed the 1st Partisan Brigade. The unit was only 'partisan' in name, as it was essentially more than 600 men and women on long range patrol. The 1st Partisan Brigade was able to infiltrate beyond Finnish patrol lines but was found out and largely destroyed.<ref name="tikkanen">{{cite book |last1=Tikkanen |first1=Pentti, H. |title=Sissiprikaatin tuho |trans_title=Destruction of Partisan Brigade |language=Finnish |year=1973 |publisher=Arvi A. Karisto Osakeyhtiö |isbn=951-23-0754-5}}</ref>

On the naval front, the Soviet [[Baltic Fleet]] still operated from the besieged city of [[Leningrad]]. In early 1942, Soviet forces recaptured the island of [[Gogland]] but lost both Gogland and [[Bolshoy Tyuters]] to the Finns later in spring 1942. During the winter of 1941/1942, the Soviet Baltic Fleet made the decision to use the large Soviet submarine fleet to carry the fight to the enemy. Though initial submarine operations in the summer of 1942 were successful, the German [[Kriegsmarine]] and [[Finnish Navy]] soon stepped up their anti-submarine efforts, making the Soviet submarine operations later in 1942 very costly. The underwater offensive carried out by the Soviets convinced the Germans to lay [[anti-submarine net]]s as well as supporting minefields between [[Porkkala]] and [[Naissaar]] which proved to be an insurmountable obstacle for the Soviet submarines.<ref name=kijanen>{{cite book|last=Kijanen|first=Kalervo|title= Suomen Laivasto 1918–1968,&nbsp;II |trans_title=Finnish Navy 1918–1967, Part&nbsp;II|language=Finnish|year=1968|publisher =Meriupseeriyhdistys/Otava|location=Helsinki|page=123}}</ref>

===Diplomatic manoeuvers===
[[File:Hitler Mannerheim Ryti.jpg|thumb|Hitler, Marshal Mannerheim (Finnish Army chief) and Finnish President [[Risto Ryti|Ryti]] meet, [[Imatra]] — June 1942]]

[[Operation Barbarossa]] was planned as a ''[[blitzkrieg]]'' intended to last a few weeks. British and U.S. observers believed that the invasion would be concluded before August.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In the autumn of 1941, this turned out to be wrong, and leading Finnish military officers started to doubt Germany's capability to finish the war quickly. German troops in northern Finland faced circumstances they were not properly prepared for, and failed to reach their targets, most importantly [[Murmansk]]. As the lines stabilized, Finland sent out peace feelers to the Soviet Union several times.<ref name= "EinoJutikkala1988">[[#EinoJutikkala1988|Jutikkala 1988]], p.248</ref> Germany was alarmed by this, and reacted by drawing down shipments of desperately needed materials each time. The idea that Finland had to continue the war while putting its own forces in the least possible danger gained increasing support, perhaps in the hope that the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' and the Red Army would wear each other down enough for negotiations to begin, or to at least get them out of the way of Finland's independent decisions. Nationalist elements, including the IKL, may also have continued to hope for an eventual victory by Germany.

Finland's participation in the war brought major benefits to Germany. The Soviet fleet was [[blockade]]d in the [[Gulf of Finland]], so that the Baltic was freed for the training of German submarine crews as well as for German shipping, especially for the transport of vital [[Swedish iron ore|iron ore from northern Sweden]] and [[Nickel deposits of Finland|nickel]] and [[rare metals]] (needed in [[steel]] processing) from the Petsamo area. The Finnish front secured the northern flank of the German [[Army Group North]] in the Baltic states. The sixteen Finnish divisions tied down numerous Soviet troops, put pressure on [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] (although Mannerheim refused to attack it directly), and threatened the Murmansk railway. Additionally, Sweden was further isolated and was increasingly pressured to comply with German and Finnish wishes, though with limited success.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Despite Finland's contributions to the German cause, the Western Allies had ambivalent feelings, torn between residual goodwill for Finland and the need to accommodate their vital ally, the Soviet Union. As a result, Britain declared war against Finland, but the United States did not. With few exceptions, there was no combat between these countries and Finland, but Finnish sailors were interned overseas. In the United States, Finland was denounced for naval attacks made on American [[Lend-Lease]] shipments, but received approval for continuing to make payments on its World War&nbsp;I debt throughout the [[interbellum|inter-war period]].

Because Finland joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] and signed other agreements with Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Allies characterized Finland as one of the [[Axis Powers]], although the term used in Finland is "[[co-belligerence]] with Germany", emphasizing the lack of a formal military alliance.

===International volunteers and support===
[[File:Estonian volunteers in finland in the continuation war.jpg|thumb|right|Estonian volunteers in Finland during the Continuation War]]
As in the [[Winter War]], Swedish volunteers were recruited. Until December 1941, they were tasked with guarding the Soviet naval base at [[Hanko]]. When it was evacuated by sea in December 1941, the Swedish unit was officially disbanded. During the Continuation War, the volunteers signed up for three to six months of service. In all, over 1,600 Swedish volunteers fought for Finland, although only about 60 remained by the summer of 1944. About a third of the volunteers had previously participated in the Winter War. Another significant group—about a quarter of the men—were Swedish officers on leave.

From 1942 to 1944 there was also a ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) battalion of volunteers on the northern Finnish front recruited from Norway, then under German occupation, and similarly, [[Frikorps Danmark|some Danes]]. About 3,400 [[Finnish Infantry Regiment 200|Estonian volunteers]] took part. On other occasions, the Finns received a total of about 2,100 Soviet prisoners of war in return for those Soviet POWs they turned over to the Germans. These POWs were mainly [[Estonians]] and [[Karelians]] who were willing to join the Finnish army. These, as well as some volunteers from occupied Eastern Karelia, formed the ''Kinship Battalion'' ([[Finnish language]]: ''Heimopataljoona''). At the end of the war, the USSR requested members of the Kinship Battalion to be handed over. Some managed to escape before or during transport, but most of them were either sent to the labor camps or executed.

===Finnish occupation policy===
{{Main|Finnish military administration in Eastern Karelia|East Karelian concentration camps}}

On 19 July 1941, the Finns set up the [[Finnish military administration in Eastern Karelia, 1941–1944|military administration]] in occupied [[East Karelia]]. The goal of the administration was to prepare the region for eventual incorporation into Finland. In the early stage, the Finns aimed at [[ethnic cleansing]] where the Russian population would be moved out of the area once the war was over.<ref name="vehviläinen105">Vehviläinen (2002), p. 105</ref> They would be replaced with [[Finnic peoples]] such as [[Karelians]], [[Finns]], [[Estonians]], [[Ingrian Finns|Ingrians]], and [[Vepsians]]. The Russian population was deemed "non-national".<ref name="Kirby2006-225"/> Most of the East Karelian population had been evacuated before the Finnish forces arrived. About 85,000 people—mostly the elderly, women, and children—were left behind, and less than half of them were [[Karelians]]. A significant number of civilians—almost 30% of the remaining Russians—were interned in [[East Karelian concentration camps|concentration camps]].<ref name="Kirby2006-225">[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 225</ref>

The winter of 1941–42 was an ordeal for the Finnish urban population, due to poor harvests and a shortage of agricultural laborers.<ref name="Kirby2006-225"/> However, for the interned it was disastrous; more than 3,500 people died, mostly from [[starvation]]. This figure amounted to 13.8% of the inmates, while the corresponding figure for the free population of the occupied territories was 2.6% and for Finland proper 1.4%.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-107">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 107</ref> Conditions gradually improved, ethnic discrimination in wage levels and food rations were terminated the following year, and new schools were established for the [[Russian language|Russian]]-speaking population.<ref name="Kirby2006-226">[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 226</ref> By the end of the occupation, mortality rates dropped to the same levels as in Finland proper.<ref name= "Vehvilainen2002-107"/>

===Soviet partisans===
{{Main|Soviet partisans#Finland and Karelia}}
[[File:DeadFinnishcivilians1942.jpg|thumb|200px|Two Finnish boys executed by Soviet partisans at [[Seitajärvi]], July 1942]]

Soviet partisans conducted a number of operations in Finland and in [[Eastern Karelia]] from 1941 to 1944. The major one failed when the 1st Partisan Brigade was destroyed in the beginning of August 1942 at Lake [[Seesjärvi]]. Partisans distributed propaganda newspapers, ''[[Pravda]]'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and ''Lenin's Banner'' in [[Russian language|Russian]]. One of the leaders of the partisan movement in Finland and Karelia was [[Yuri Andropov]].<ref>{{ru icon}}''[http://www.hrono.ru/biograf/andropov.html Andropov Yuri Vladimirovich]''. Biography.</ref>

Finnish sources state that partisan activity in East Karelia focused mainly on Finnish military supply and communication targets, but almost two thirds of the attacks on the Finnish side of the border targeted civilians,<ref name="Viheriävaara">{{fi icon}} Eino Viheriävaara, ''Partisaanien jäljet 1941–1944''.

===Jews in Finland===
{{Main|Jews in Finland}}

Finland had a small (approx. 2,300) [[Jewish]] population. They had full civil rights and fought with other Finns in the ranks of the Finnish Army. The Germans had mentioned the Finnish Jews at the [[Wannsee Conference]] in January 1942, wishing to transport them to [[Majdanek]] in [[General Government]]. SS leader [[Heinrich Himmler]] mentioned the Finnish Jews during his visit in Finland in the summer of 1942. Finnish Prime Minister [[Jukka Rangell]] replied that Finland had no "[[Jewish question]]".<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-102">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 102</ref> However, there were differences for Jewish refugees in Finland. In November 1942, the Finns handed eight Jewish refugees over to the [[Gestapo]]. This raised protests among the Finnish Social Democrat ministers, and after this event no more refugees were handed over.<ref name="Vehvilainen2002-103">[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 103</ref> Over 500 Jewish refugees were granted [[right of asylum|asylum]].<ref name="yadvashem">{{Cite web|title=Finland|publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|url=http://yad-vashem.org.il/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205852.pdf|accessdate=2010-10-29}}</ref>

The field [[synagogue]] in [[Eastern Karelia]] was one of the very few functioning synagogues on the Axis side during the war. There were even several cases of Jewish officers of Finland's army being awarded the German [[Iron Cross]], which they declined. German soldiers were treated by Jewish medical officers who sometimes saved the soldiers' lives.<ref name="Rautkallio">{{fi icon}} Rautkallio, Hannu, ''Suomen juutalaisten aseveljeys'' (Finnish Jews as German Brothers in Arms), Tammi, 1989</ref><ref>Tuulikki Vuonokari (2003), ''Jews in Finland During the Second World War'', Finnish Institutions Student Paper: FAST Area Studies Program Department of Translation Studies, University of Tampere, Autumn 2003 [http://www.uta.fi/FAST/FIN/HIST/tv-jews.html].

===Finland and the Western allies===
The Continuation War represents the only case of a genuinely democratic state participating in World War&nbsp;II on the side of the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]], albeit without being a signatory of the [[Tripartite Pact]]. The United Kingdom declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941 (Finnish Independence Day), with Canada and New Zealand declaring war on Finland on 7 December and Australia and South Africa declaring war the next day. U.S. Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] congratulated the Finnish envoy on 3 October 1941 for the liberation of Karelia but warned Finland not to enter Soviet territory; furthermore, the United States did not declare war on Finland when it went to war with the Axis countries and, together with the UK, approached Soviet Premier [[Josef Stalin]] at the [[Tehran Conference]] about acknowledging Finnish independence. However, the U.S. government seized Finnish [[merchant vessel|merchant ships]] in American ports, and in the summer of 1944 shut down Finnish diplomatic and commercial offices in the United States as a result of President Ryti's treaty with Germany. The U.S. government later warned Finland about the consequences of continued adherence to the Axis.<ref>World War&nbsp;II: [http://worldwar2database.com/html/finland.htm Finland]</ref>

The best-known British action on Finnish soil was an aircraft carrier [[Raid on Kirkenes and Petsamo|strike on German and Finnish ships]] in the Finnish harbour of [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] on 31 July 1941.<ref name="pvfkvi">FAA archive: [http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/RollofHonour/Battlehonour_crewlists/Petsamo_Kirkenes_1941.html Raid on Petsamo]</ref> This attack achieved little except the loss of three British aircraft, but it was intended as a demonstration of British support for its Soviet ally. Later in 1941, [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] of [[No.&nbsp;151 Wing RAF]], based at Murmansk, provided local air cover for Soviet troops and fighter escorts for Soviet bombers.<ref>The [[Royal Air Force]] in Russia :[http://ww2airfronts.org/Theaters/eto/rinr/pages/rinr-1.html Hurricanes at Murmansk]</ref> The British contribution to the war was occasional but significant.

[[Finnish radio intelligence]] is said to have participated effectively in German actions against British convoys to [[Murmansk]].<ref>Ahtokari, Reijo and Pale, Erkki: ''Suomen Radiotiedustelu 1927–1944'' (Finnish radio intelligence 1927–1944), Helsinki, Hakapaino Oy, pp. 191–198, ISBN 952-90-9437-X</ref> Throughout the war, German aircraft operating from airfields in northern Finland attacked British air and naval units based in Murmansk and [[Archangelsk]].

===Overtures for peace===
{{Main|Bombing of Helsinki in World War II|Battle of Narva (1944)}}

Finland began to actively seek a way out of the war after the disastrous German defeat at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in February 1943. [[Edwin Linkomies]] formed a new cabinet with peace as the top priority. Negotiations were conducted intermittently in 1943–44 between Finland and its representative, [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi]], on one side, and the Western Allies and the Soviet Union on the other, but no agreement was reached. Stalin decided to force Finland to surrender; a [[Bombing of Helsinki in World War II|bombing campaign on Helsinki]] followed. The air campaign in February 1944 included three major air attacks involving a total of over 6,000 [[sortie]]s. Finnish anti-aircraft defences managed to repel the raids as only five percent of the dropped [[Aerial bomb|bomb]]s hit their planned targets. Helsinki's air defense included the strategic placing of searchlights and fires as decoys outside the city to lure the Soviet bombers to drop their payloads in what were actually unpopulated areas. Major air attacks also hit [[Oulu]] and [[Kotka]], but because of radio intelligence and effective [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defence]]s, the number of casualties was small.<ref name="Mäkelä_67">{{Cite book|last1=Mäkelä|first1=Jukka|title=Helsinki liekeissä|publisher=Werner Söderström osakeyhtiö|year=1967|location=Helsinki|page=20|url=|doi=|id=| isbn=}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the lengthy and ferocious [[Battle of Narva (1944)|German defence in Narva]] aided by the [[20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)|Estonians]] eliminated Soviet-occupied Estonia as a favorable base for Soviet amphibious invasions and air attacks against Helsinki and other Finnish cities. The tactical success of the army detachment "Narwa" from mid-February to April diminished the hopes of the Stavka to assault Finland and force it into [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] from Estonia.<ref name=paulman>{{cite book|language=Russian|first=F.

===Soviet strategic offensive===
On 9 June 1944, the Soviet Union opened [[Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive|a major offensive]] against Finnish positions on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] and in the area of [[Lake Ladoga]] (it was timed to accompany [[D-Day]]<ref>[[s:Tehran Conference|Declaration of the Three Powers, December 1, 1943, Tehran Conference]]</ref>). On the {{convert|21.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}-wide breakthrough segment the Red Army had concentrated 3,000 guns and mortars. In some places, the concentration of artillery pieces exceeded 200 guns for every kilometer of the front (one every {{convert|5|m|yd|abbr=on}}). On that day, Soviet artillery fired over 80,000 rounds along the front on the Karelian Isthmus. On the second day of the offensive, the Soviet forces broke through the Finnish front lines. The Soviets penetrated the [[VT-line|second line of defence]] by the sixth day. The Soviet pressure on the Karelian Isthmus forced the Finns to reinforce the area. This allowed the second Soviet offensive in Eastern Karelia to meet less resistance and to capture [[Petrozavodsk]] by 28 June 1944. According to Erickson (1991), James Gebhardt (1989), and Glantz (1998), the main objective of the Soviet offensives was to force Finland from the war.<ref name="Erickson-197">[[#Erickson|Erickson 1993]], p. 197</ref><ref name="Gebhardt-2">[[#Gebhardt|Gebhardt 1989]], p. 2</ref><ref name="Glantz2-202">[[#Glantz2|Glantz 1998]], p. 202</ref>

Finland especially lacked modern antitank weaponry which could stop Soviet heavy tanks, and German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] offered these in exchange for a guarantee that Finland would not seek a separate peace again. On 26 June, President [[Risto Ryti]] gave [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement|this guarantee as a personal undertaking]], which he intended to last only for the remainder of his presidency. In addition to delivering thousands of hand-held ''[[Panzerfaust]]'' and ''[[Panzerschreck]]'' antitank weapons, Hitler sent the 122nd Infantry Division, the half-strength 303rd Assault Gun Brigade, and ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' ''[[Detachment Kuhlmey]]'' to provide temporary support in the most threatened defense sectors.

With new supplies from Germany, the Finnish army halted the Soviet advance in early July 1944. At this point, the Finnish forces had retreated about one hundred kilometres, which brought them to approximately the same line of defence they had held at the end of the Winter War. This line was known as the [[VKT-line]] (short for "''Viipuri–[[Kuparsaari]]–Taipale''"; it ran from Viborg to the [[River Vuoksi]] to Lake Ladoga at [[Solovyovo, Priozersky District, Leningrad Oblast|Taipale]]), where the Finnish Army stopped the Soviet offensive in the [[Battle of Tali-Ihantala]] in spite of Soviet numerical and materiel superiority.<ref name="books.google.com">[http://books.google.com/books?id=Bg8drRyDGhEC&pg=PA184&dq=%22Battle+of+Tali-Ihantala%22&cd=2#v=onepage&q=%22Battle%20of%20Tali-Ihantala%22&f=false 500 Days: The War in Eastern Europe ... – Google Books]</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">[http://books.google.com/books?id=p58vtOKyVy8C&pg=PA14&dq=%22Tali-Ihantala%22&as_brr=3&cd=2#v=onepage&q=%22Tali-Ihantala%22&f=false Finland at War 1939–45 – Google Books]</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">[http://books.google.com/books?id=Dh6jydKXikoC&pg=PA467&dq=Ihantala+battle&as_brr=3&cd=3#v=onepage&q=Ihantala%20battle&f=false Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: F-O – Google Books]</ref> The front stabilized once again.<ref name="books.google.com"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="ReferenceB"/> A few battles were fought in the latter stages of the war.

==Prisoners of war==

===Soviet prisoners of war in Finland===
{{Main|Soviet prisoners of war in Finland}}

The number of Soviet prisoners of war was estimated to be around 64,000 persons. Of these, 56,000 were captured in 1941.<ref>Juutilainen & Leskinen (ed.); Kujansuu, Juha (2005), p. 1036</ref> About 2,600 to 2,800 Soviet prisoners of war were handed over to the Germans in exchange for roughly 2,200 [[Finnic peoples|Finnic]] prisoners of war.<ref>''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'': [http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20031118IE7  "Wartime refugees made pawns in cruel diplomatic game."] 8 November 2003</ref> Food was especially scarce in 1942 in Finland due to a bad harvest, and this was the primary reason for the number of deaths. Out of 64,188 Soviet POWs, 18,318 died in Finnish [[prisoner of war camp]]s.<ref name="Ylikangas">{{fi icon}} Ylikangas, Heikki, ''[http://www2.vnk.fi/julkaisukansio/2004/j05-heikki-ylikankaan/pdf/fi.pdf Heikki Ylikankaan selvitys Valtioneuvoston kanslialle]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}'', Government of Finland</ref>

===Finnish prisoners of war in the Soviet Union===
{{Main|Finnish prisoners of war in the Soviet Union}}

There are two views of the number of Finnish prisoners of war. The Soviet and Russian view is that of 2,377 Finnish prisoners of war who reached the prison camps 1,954 were returned after the [[Moscow Armistice]]. The Finnish view is that of the original approximately 3,500 Finnish prisoners of war, only about 2,000 were returned (more than 40% perished). The difference can be at least partially explained by the Soviet practice of counting only the prisoners who survived to reach a prison camp.

{{Main|Moscow Armistice|Lapland War}}

Mannerheim had repeatedly reminded the Germans that in case [[Battle of Narva (1944)|their troops in Estonia]] retreated, Finland would be forced to make peace even on extremely unfavourable terms.<ref>Howard D. Grier. ''Hitler, Dönitz, and the Baltic Sea'', Naval Institute Press, 2007, ISBN 1-59114-345-4. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=u4IbqxEQeBMC&sig=ACfU3U1y5qvHJPiPkpX74WKLzPbPX7KK5g&pg=PA121#PPA121,M1 p. 121]</ref> The territory of Estonia would have provided the Soviet army a favourable base for amphibious invasions and air attacks against Finland's capital, [[Helsinki]], and other strategic targets in Finland, and would have severed Finnish access to the sea. The initial German reaction to Finland's announcement of ambitions for a separate peace was limited to only verbal opposition. However, the Germans then arrested hundreds of sailors on Finnish merchant ships in Germany, Denmark, and Norway.

Previously, in return for critically needed food and defense materiel from the Germans, President Ryti had personally committed, in writing, that no separate peace with the Soviets would be attempted. Accordingly, it became clear that he must resign, paving the way for a separate peace. Finland's military leader [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Mannerheim]] appointed president in an extraordinary procedure by the Finnish parliament. In agreeing to take office, he accepted responsibility for ending the war.

On 4 September, the cease-fire ended military actions on the Finnish side. The Soviet Union ended hostilities exactly 24 hours after the Finns. An [[Moscow armistice|armistice]] between the Soviet Union and Finland was signed in Moscow on 19 September. Finland had to make many concessions: the Soviet Union regained the borders of 1940, with the addition of the Petsamo area (now [[Pechengsky District]], Russia); the [[Porkkala]] peninsula (adjacent to Helsinki) was leased to the USSR as a naval base for fifty years; and transit rights were granted.  Finland's army was to be demobilized with haste, but Finland was first required to expel all German troops from its territory within 14 days. As the Germans did not leave Finland by the given deadline, the Finns fought their former co-belligerents in the [[Lapland War]]. Finland was also required to clear the [[Land mine|minefields]] in Karelia (including East Karelia) and in the Gulf of Finland. Retreating German forces had also mined northern Finland heavily. The [[demining]] was a long operation, especially in the sea areas, lasting until 1952. One-hundred Finnish army personnel were killed and over 200 wounded during this process, most of them in Lapland.

As sizable numbers of civilians who had been relocated into Finland from Karelia in 1939-40 had moved back into Karelia during the war and they had to be [[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|evacuated again]]; of the 260 000 civilians who had moved back into the Karelia only 19 chose to remain and become Soviet subjects.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hietanen |first=Silvo |encyclopedia=Kansakunta sodassa. 3. osa.

Nevertheless, in contrast to the rest of the Eastern front countries, where the war was fought to the end, a Soviet occupation of Finland did not occur and the country retained sovereignty. Neither did the Communists rise to power as they had in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. A policy called the ''[[Paasikivi–Kekkonen line]]'' formed the basis of Finnish foreign policy towards the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union's [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|dissolution in 1991]].

===Finnish reasons for entering the war and nature of Finnish-German relations===
Finland re-entered World War&nbsp;II mainly because of the Soviet invasion of Finland during the [[Winter War]], which had taken place after Finnish intentions of relying on the League of Nations and Nordic neutrality to avoid conflicts had failed from lack of outside support.<ref name=Lunde-9>[[#Lunde|Lunde 2011]], p.&nbsp;9</ref> During the Continuation War, Finland primarily aimed to reverse its territorial losses under the March 1940 [[Moscow Peace Treaty (1940)|Moscow Peace Treaty]] and, depending on the success of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, to possibly expand, especially into [[East Karelia]] ([[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic]]).<ref name=Jokipii-145>[[#Jokipii|Jokipii 1999]], p. 145-6</ref> Some [[Academic Karelia Society|right-wing groups]] also supported a [[Greater Finland]] ideology. Henrik Lunde notes that, unlike many of Germany's allies, Finland survived World War&nbsp;II without losing its independence,<ref name=Lunde-379>[[#Lunde|Lunde 2011]], p. 379</ref> although the price for war was high in war casualties, reparation payments, territorial loss, a bruised international reputation according to Olli Vehviläinen, and according to some, subsequent [[Finlandization|Soviet influence on Finland's foreign policy]] during the [[Cold War]]. According to Tuulikki Vuonokari, the Finnish–German alliance was different from most of the other Axis relationships, an example of which was the participation of Finnish Jews in the fight against the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uta.fi/~tuulikki.vuonokari/fin-1.html|title=Jews in Finland During the Second World War|accessdate=2010-10-29|first=Tuulikki|last=Vuonokari|date=2003-11-21|work=|publisher=University of Tampere

The Finns, and Mannerheim in particular, clearly stated they would fight against the Soviets only to the extent necessary to redress the balance of the 1940 treaty (which would ultimately have dire consequences for Germany, when Finland refused to advance beyond its 1939 borders to complete the German encirclement of Leningrad.) However, for Hitler the matter was irrelevant; and he saw Finland as an ally.<ref name= "Vehvilainen2002-102"/>

Finland adopted the concept of a "parallel war" whereby it sought to pursue its own objectives in concert with, but separate from, Nazi Germany, as "co-belligerents".

===Tides of war===
Major events of World War&nbsp;II and the tides of war in general had a significant impact on the course of the Continuation War:
*Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union ([[Operation Barbarossa]]) is closely connected to the Continuation War's beginning.
*The [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasion of France ([[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]]) was coordinated with the [[Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive|Soviet major offensive]] against Finland (9 June–15 July 1944).<ref name= "EinoJutikkala1988"/>
*The subsequent Soviet and Allied advances towards Germany drew away the interest in military operations from [[Northern Europe]], hastening the end of the Continuation War.

===Soviet "buffer zones" across Europe===
Soviet sources maintain that Soviet policies up to the Continuation War were best explained as defensive measures by offensive means: The Soviet division of occupied Poland with Germany, the Soviet occupations of [[Lithuanian SSR|Lithuania]], [[Soviet occupations of Latvia|Latvia]] and [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]], and the Soviet invasion of Finland in the Winter War are described as elements in the Soviets' construction of a security zone or buffer region between the perceived threat from the [[capitalism|capitalist]] powers of Western Europe and the [[Communism|Communist]] Soviet Union.  These Soviet sources see the post-war establishment of Soviet [[satellite state]]s in the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries and the [[Finno–Soviet Treaty of 1948|Finnish-Soviet Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance]] as the conclusion of this Soviet defense plan.<ref>{{ru icon}}[http://www.aroundspb.ru/finnish/baryshnikov/pvp1932.php The problem of ensuring the security of Leningrad from the north in light of Soviet war planning of 1932–1941] by V.&nbsp;N. Baryshnikov: ''The actual war with Finland began first of all due to unresolved issues in Leningrad's security from the north and Moscow's concerns for the perspective of Finland's politics. At the same time, a desire to claim better strategic positions in case of a war with Germany had surfaced within the Soviet leadership.''</ref><ref>{{ru icon}}[http://www.aroundspb.ru/finnish/kozlov/part_01.php Финская война. Взгляд "с той стороны"] ("The Finnish war. A look from the 'other side'") by A.&nbsp;I. Kozlov: "After the rise of National Socialism to power in Germany, the geopolitical importance of the former 'buffer states' had drastically changed. Both the Soviet Union and Germany vied for the inclusion of these states into their spheres of influence. Soviet politicians and military considered it likely, that in case of an aggression against the USSR, German armed forces will use the territory of the Baltic states and Finland as staging areas for invasion—by either conquering or coercing these countries. None of the states of the Baltic region, excluding Poland, had sufficient military power to resist a German invasion".</ref><ref>{{ru icon}} ''[[Stalin's Missed Chance]]'', by [[Mikhail Meltyukhov]]: "The English–French influence in the Baltics, characteristic for the '20s–early '30s was increasingly limited by the growth of German influence. Due to the strategic importance of the region, the Soviet leadership also aimed to increase its influence there, using both diplomatic means as well as active social [[propaganda]]. By the end of the '30s, the main contenders for influence in the Baltics were Germany and the Soviet Union. Being a buffer zone between Germany and the USSR, the Baltic states were bound to them by a system of economic and non-aggression treaties of 1926, 1932 and 1939".</ref> Western historians such as [[Norman Davies]] and [[John Lukacs]] dispute this view and describe the prewar Soviet policy as an attempt to stay out of the war and regaining land lost after the fall of the [[Russian Empire]].<ref>Norman Davies, ''No Simple Victory'', 2007, ISBN 978-0-670-01832-1</ref>

===Assessment of Soviet designs for Finland and their outcome===
Several Western historians, while noting the Soviets' assertion of their alleged need for a Soviet security buffer, contend the Soviet designs on Finland were no different from the other Baltic countries. American [[Dan Reiter]] (1990) notes, “[Finland recognized] that the Soviet Union was unlikely to be satisfied with territorial concessions as a means to increase its security. [T]he Soviets viewed the control of small buffer states as critical to their security...This was the motivation", he asserts, "behind the de facto 1940 Soviet annexation of the Baltic States, and Moscow saw the control of Finland also as ultimately being necessary."  Reiter and British historian Victor Rothwell quote Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov as telling his Lithuanian counterpart at the time Lithuania was effectively absorbed into the USSR, “[S]mall states will disappear...Baltic states, including Finland, will be included within the honourable family of Soviet peoples.<ref>Dan Reiter, ''How Wars End'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey USA (2009), p. 131.</ref><ref name="Rothwell2006">{{cite book |last=Rothwell|first=Victor|title= War Aims in the Second World War: The War Aims of the Key Belligerents 1939-1945= 2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-1503-2|pages=143, 145}}</ref> However, contends Reiter, "[T]he fear of rising costs of fighting pushed Stalin to accept a limited war outcome with Finland, rather than pursue absolute victory",<ref>Dan Reiter, ''How Wars End'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ (2009), p. 138, 135.</ref> although a contemporary "Soviet document... called for the brutal military occupation of Finland at war’s end."<ref>Dan Reiter, ''How Wars End'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ (2009), p. 135.</ref> “The Finnish victory [at [[Battle of Ilomantsi|Ilomantsi]]] ended the Soviet offensive in Finland and persuaded the Soviets to give up their demand for Finland's unconditional surrender".<ref>Dan Reiter, ''How Wars End'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ (2009), p. 136.</ref>  Peter Provis (1999) concludes his essay on point, “By following [self-censorship and limited appeasement] policies and fulfilling the Soviet Union's demands [for great reparations]...Finland avoided the same fate as other nations that were 'liberated' by the Red Army...Finland had once again defended her independence in a global conflict that engulfed and destroyed many other nations...The Finns had once again demonstrated their determination to avoid defeat by the Soviet Union and maintained their independence".<ref name="Provis1999">{{cite web| url=http://diemperdidi.info/nordicnotes/vol03/articles/provis.html|last=Provis|first= Peter|title=Nordic Notes: Finnish achievement in the Continuation War and after JSSN 1442-5165|year=1999|publisher=Celsius Centre for Scandinavian Studies}}</ref>

Russian historian Nikolai Baryshnikov disputes the view that the Soviet Union wanted to deprive Finland of its independence, and that Finnish "defensive victories" prevented this. He argues that there is no documentary evidence for such claims and that the Soviet government was always open for negotiations. Baryshnikov cites the former head of the Office of Information of the Finnish General Staff, Kalle Lehmus, and other Finnish sources to show that the Finnish leaders already knew of the limited Soviet plans for Finland in the first half of July 1944, after intelligence indicated that some Soviet divisions were to be transferred to reserve in Leningrad.<ref>[[#Baryshnikov|Baryshnikov (2002)]], pp.222-223 (Section heading "Стремительный прорыв," paragraph #48 et seq., after cit. 409)</ref><ref name=Baryshnikov2>[[#Baryshnikov2|Baryshnikov (2006)]]</ref>
