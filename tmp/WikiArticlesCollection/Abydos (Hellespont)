'''Abydos''' (Greek: Άβυδος), an ancient city of [[Mysia]], in [[Asia Minor]], situated at Nara Burnu or [[Nagara Point]] on the best harbor on the Asiatic shore of the [[Hellespont]]. Across Abydos lies [[Sestus]] on the European side, marking one of the narrowest points of the [[Dardanelles]], slightly more than a nautical mile broad (the narrrowest point is at [[Çanakkale]]). The strategic site has been a prohibited zone in the 20th century. [[Hero and Leander]]'s story took place near Abydos.   

Abydos was first mentioned in the catalogue of Trojan allies (''[[Iliad]]'' ii.836). It probably was  a [[Thracians|Thracian]] town, as [[Strabo]] has it, but was afterwards colonized by [[Miletus|Milesians]], with the consent of [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges, king of Lydia]], around 700 BC.  It was occupied by the Persians in 514 BC, and [[Darius the Great|Darius]] burnt it in 512 BC.  Here [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] built two [[pontoon bridge]]s later known as [[Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges]] and crossed the strait in 480 BC when he [[Greco-Persian Wars|invaded Greece]].<ref>[[Herodotus]].  ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', 7.34.</ref>

Abydos thereafter became a member of the [[Delian League]], until it revolted from Athenian rule in 411 BC.<ref>[[Thucydides]].  ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/thucydides/jthucbk8rv2.htm 8.61-2].</ref>  It allied itself to [[History of Sparta|Sparta]], until 394 BC; King [[Agesilaus]] of Sparta crossed here while returning to Greece.  Abydos then passed under [[Achaemenid]] rule, until 334 BC.  [[Alexander the Great]] threw a spear to Abydos while crossing the strait and claimed Asia as his own.

Abydos is celebrated for the vigorous resistance it made against [[Philip V of Macedon]] in 200 BC.<ref>[[Polybius]].  ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/16*.html 16.29-34]</ref> It is famous in myth as the home of [[Hero and Leander|Leander]].  In literature, it is memorable from [[Byron]] having adopted its name in ''The Bride of Abydos''.<ref>{{Cite Collier's|Abydos}}</ref> It minted coins from the early 5th century BC to the mid-3rd century AD. 

The town remained until late Byzantine times an important toll and customs station of the Hellespont, its importance thereafter being transferred to the [[Dardanelles]], after the building of the "Old Castles" by Sultan [[Mehmet II]] (c. 1456).
