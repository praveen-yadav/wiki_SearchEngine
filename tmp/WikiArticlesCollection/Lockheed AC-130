The '''Lockheed AC-130''' [[gunship]] is a heavily armed [[attack aircraft|ground-attack aircraft]] variant of the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] transport plane. The basic airframe is manufactured by [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]], while [[Boeing]] is responsible for the conversion into a [[gunship]] and for aircraft support.<ref name="Boe_AC-130U">[http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/support/maintenance/special_ops/ac130u.html AC-130U Gunship page]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}. Boeing</ref>  The AC-130A Gunship II superseded the [[AC-47 Spooky|AC-47 Gunship I]] during the [[Vietnam War]].

The gunship's sole user is the [[United States Air Force]], which uses '''AC-130H Spectre''', '''AC-130U Spooky''', '''AC-130J Ghostrider''', and '''AC-130W Stinger II'''<ref name="MC-130W Dragon Spear">{{cite web|url=http://airforce.americanspecialops.com/aircraft/mc-130w-dragon-spear/ |title=MC-130W Dragon Spear |publisher=Airforce Special Operations |accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref> variants for [[close air support]], [[air interdiction]] and [[force protection]]. Close air support roles include supporting ground troops, escorting [[convoy]]s, and flying urban operations. Air interdiction missions are conducted against planned targets and targets of opportunity. Force protection missions include [[Defense (military)|defending]] [[air base]]s and other facilities. AC-130Us are based at [[Hurlburt Field]], Florida, while AC-130Hs and AC-130Ws are based at [[Cannon AFB]], [[New Mexico]].<ref name="AC-130W Factsheet">[http://www.cannon.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet_print.asp?fsID=12750&page=1].</ref>  The AC-130s deploy to bases worldwide in support of operations. The gunship squadrons are part of the [[Air Force Special Operations Command]] (AFSOC), a component of the [[United States Special Operations Command]] (SOCOM).<ref name="AF_factsht">[http://archive.is/20120723063656/http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=71 AC-130H/U Gunship fact sheet]. US Air Force, 30 July 2010. (Article was originally based on this.)</ref>

All of the weaponry aboard is mounted to fire from the left (port) side of the [[Cabin pressurization|non-pressurised]] aircraft. During an attack the gunship performs a [[pylon turn]], flying in a large circle around the target, allowing it to fire at it far longer than a conventional attack aircraft. The AC-130H "Spectre" was armed with two 20&nbsp;mm [[M61 Vulcan]] cannons, one [[Bofors 40mm]] autocannon, and one 105&nbsp;mm [[M102 howitzer|M102]] cannon, although on most missions after 1994 the 20mm cannons were removed due to their incompatibility with precision targeting and to carry more 40mm and 105mm ammunition.  Another reason the 20mm cannons were removed was due to insufficient slant range to target to operate outside of the shoulder launched missile (MANPADS) threat envelope. The upgraded AC-130U "Spooky" has a single 25&nbsp;mm [[GAU-12 Equalizer]] in place of the Spectre's twin 20&nbsp;mm cannons, an improved fire control system, and increased ammunition capacity. New AC-130J gunships based on [[MC-130J Combat Shadow II]] special operations tankers were planned {{As of|2012|lc=on}}.  The AC-130W is armed with one 30mm Bushmaster Cannon and can drop the [[AGM-176 Griffin]] missile.<ref name="MC-130W Dragon Spear"/>

==Development==

===Origins===
During the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] was selected to replace the [[Douglas AC-47 Spooky]] gunship (Project Gunship I) in order to improve mission endurance and increase capacity to carry munitions. Capable of flying faster than helicopters and at high altitudes with excellent [[Loiter (flight)|loiter]] time, the use of the [[pylon turn]] allowed the AC-47 to deliver continuous accurate fire to a single point on the ground.<ref name="USAF Nat Museum">[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3216 AC-130A fact sheet].

[[File:AC-130H Spectre (2152981898).jpg|thumb|left|AC-130H Spectre near Hurlburt Field, Florida in 1988]]

In 1967, JC-130A USAF 54-1626 was selected for conversion into the prototype AC-130A gunship (Project Gunship II). The modifications were done at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] by the Aeronautical Systems Division. A direct view [[Night vision device|night vision telescope]] was installed in the forward door, an early [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) in the forward part of the left wheel well, and Gatling guns fixed facing down and aft along the left side. The [[Analog computer|analog]] [[fire control computer]] prototype was handcrafted by [[RAF]] Wing Commander Tom Pinkerton at the USAF Avionics Laboratory at Wright-Patterson AFB. Flight testing of the prototype was performed primarily at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], followed by further testing and modifications. By September 1967, the aircraft was certified ready for combat testing and was flown to [[Nha Trang Air Base]], [[South Vietnam]] for a 90-day test program.<ref name="USAF Nat Museum"/>  The AC-130 was later supplemented by the [[Fairchild AC-119|AC-119 Shadow]] (Project Gunship III), which later proved to be underpowered.

[[File:AC-130 Training.jpg|thumb|An AC-130U firing [[Flare (countermeasure)|flares]]]]

Seven more [[warplane]]s were converted to the "Plain Jane" configuration like the AC-130 prototype in 1968,<ref>[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3220 Lockheed AC-130A "Plain Jane"]. National Museum of the United States Air Force. Accessed on 5 April 2009.</ref> and one aircraft received the "Surprise Package" equipment in 1969.<ref>[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3221 Lockheed AC-130A "Surprise Package"]. National Museum of the United States Air Force. Accessed on 5 April 2009.</ref> Surprise Package included the latest [[20 mm caliber|20&nbsp;mm]] rotary cannons and [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40 mm Bofors cannon]] but no 7.62&nbsp;mm close support armament. Surprise Package served as a test bed for the avionic systems and armament for the AC-130E.

In 1970, ten more AC-130As were acquired under the "Pave Pronto" project.<ref name="Pave Pronto">[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3222 Lockheed AC-130A "PAVE Pronto"]. National Museum of the United States Air Force. Accessed on 5 April 2009.</ref> In the summer of 1971, Surprise Package equipped AC-130s were converted to the Pave Pronto configuration and assumed their new nickname 'Thor'. Conversion of C-130Es into AC-130Es for the "PAVE Spectre" project followed.<ref>[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3224 Lockheed AC-130E "PAVE Spectre"].

Regardless of their project names the aircraft were more commonly referred to by the squadron's call sign 'Spectre'.

===Recent and planned upgrades===
[[File:AC-130U Spooky gunship 30 mm cannon.jpg|thumb|AC-130U armed with two 30mm Bushmasters, 2007]]

In 2007, [[Air Force Special Operations Command]] (AFSOC) initiated a program to upgrade the armament of AC-130s. The test program planned for the 25&nbsp;mm GAU-12/U and 40&nbsp;mm Bofors cannon on the AC-130U gunships to be replaced with two [[30 mm caliber|30&nbsp;mm]] Mk 44 [[Bushmaster II]] cannon.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles2006/200610105842.asp |title=30 mm Everywhere |publisher=strategypage.com |date=1 October 2006 |author=Dunnigan, James }}</ref> In 2007, the Air Force modified four AC-130U gunships as test platforms for the Bushmasters. These were referred to as AC-130U Plus 4 or AC-130U+4. AFSOC, however, canceled its plans to install the new cannons on its fleet of AC-130Us. It has since removed the guns and re-installed the original 40&nbsp;mm and 25mm cannons and returned the planes to combat duty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/a-spookier-spooky-30mm-at-a-time-03023/ |title=A Spookier Spooky, 30mm at a Time? Nope. |date=1 March 2012 |work=Defense Industry Daily }}</ref> Brigadier General Bradley A. Heithold, AFSOC's director of plans, programs, requirements, and assessments, said on 11 August 2008 that the effort was canceled because of problems with the Bushmaster's accuracy in tests "at the altitude we were employing it". There were also schedule considerations that drove the decision, he said.<ref>[http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2008/October%202008/1008world.aspx "Spooky Gun Swap Canceled"]. Air Force Magazine, October 2008, Volume 91, Number 10, p. 24.</ref>

There were also plans to possibly replace the 105&nbsp;mm [[M102 howitzer|cannon]] with a [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] 120&nbsp;mm [[M120 mortar]], and to give the AC-130 a standoff capability using either the [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] missile, the [[Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System]] (based on the [[Hydra 70]] rocket), or the [[GBU-44/B Viper Strike|Viper Strike]] [[glide bomb]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2006garm/tuesday/elliot.pdf |title=Future AC-130 Gunship Integrated Weapons Systems |format=PDF |publisher=US DoD |date=March 2006}}</ref>

The Air Force awarded [[L-3 Communications]] a $61&nbsp;million contract to add weapons packages to eight [[Lockheed MC-130|MC-130W Combat Spear]] special-mission aircraft<ref>[http://www.defense.gov/contracts/contract.aspx?contractid=4371 DoD "Contracts"]. U.S. Department of Defense, 21 September 2010.</ref> to give them a gunship-like attack capability. L-3 will provide weapons kits, named "precision strike packages", for installation on the aircraft at Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Georgia.

The Air Force launched an initiative in 2011 to acquire 16 new gunships based on new-built [[MC-130J Combat Shadow II]] special operations tankers outfitted with a "precision strike package" to give them an attack capability. The Air Force is requesting $1.6&nbsp;billion from Fiscal 2011 through 2015 for this recapitalization. These aircraft would increase the size of the Air Force's gunship fleet to 33 aircraft, a net increase of eight after the planned retirement of eight aging AC-130Hs. The first aircraft would be bought in Fiscal 2012, followed by two in Fiscal 2013, five in Fiscal 2014, and the final eight in Fiscal 2015.<ref>Sirak, Micael.

===Overview===

The AC-130 is a heavily armed long-endurance aircraft carrying an array of anti-ground oriented weapons that are integrated with sophisticated sensors, navigation, and fire control systems. It is capable of delivering precision firepower or area-saturation fire over a target area over a long period of time, at night or in adverse weather. The sensor suite consists of a television sensor, [[infrared]] sensor, and [[radar]]. These sensors allow the gunship to visually or electronically identify friendly ground forces and targets in most weather conditions.

The AC-130U is equipped with the [[AN/APQ-180]], a [[synthetic aperture radar]] for long-range target detection and identification. The gunship's navigational devices include [[inertial navigation system]]s and a [[Global Positioning System]]. The AC-130U employs technologies developed in the 1990s which allow it to attack two targets simultaneously. It has twice the [[Ammunition|munitions]] capacity of the AC-130H.<ref name="Boe_AC-130U" /> Although the AC-130U conducts some operations in daylight, most of its combat missions are conducted at night.<ref>Naylor, Sean. [http://books.google.com/books?id=Jz4zjLuvZsUC&printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1 ''Not a Good Day to Die: The Untold Story of Operation Anaconda''], pp. 425. Berkley Books, 2005. ISBN 0-425-19609-7. Retrieved 6 April 2009.</ref> The AC-130H's unit cost is US$132.4&nbsp;million, and the AC-130U's cost is US$190&nbsp;million (fiscal 2001 dollars).<ref name="AF_factsht"/>

===Upgrades===
[[File:AC-130U Sensor Operator.jpg|thumb|left|AC-130U sensor suite]]

During the Vietnam era, the various AC-130 versions following the Pave Pronto modifications were equipped with a [[magnetic anomaly detector]] (MAD) system called the Black Crow (AN/ASD-5), a highly sensitive passive device with a [[phased-array]] [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] located in the left-front nose [[radome]] that could pick up localized deviations in [[earth's magnetic field]] that is normally used to detect submerged [[submarine]]s. The Black Crow system was [[Master-slave (technology)|slaved]] into the targeting computers of the AC-130A/E/H, enabling the detection of the unshielded [[ignition coil]]s of North Vietnamese trucks hidden under dense jungle foliage, typical along the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]]. It could also detect hand-held transmitter signals of air controllers on the ground to identify and locate targets.

The PGM-38/U Enhanced 25&nbsp;mm [[High explosive incendiary|High Explosive Incendiary]] (HEI) round was created to expand the AC-130U gunships' mission in standoff range and survivability for its 25&nbsp;mm [[GAU-12 Equalizer|GAU-12/U]] gun system. This round is a combination of the existing PGU-25 HEI and a M758 fuze designated as FMU-151/B to meet the MIL-STD-1316. The FMU-151 has an improved arming delay with multi-sensitive range.<ref>"PGU-38/U 25mm Ammunition", August 1993, Alliant Techsystems, Public Release, Case No. 93-S3040, E10630 8/93.</ref>

==Operational history==

===Vietnam War===
The AC-130 gunship first arrived in South Vietnam on 21 September 1967 under the Gunship II program and began combat operations over [[Laos]] and South Vietnam that year. In June 1968, AC-130s were deployed to Tan Son Nhut AB near Saigon for support against the Tet Offensive. By 30 October 1968 enough AC-130 Gunship IIs arrived to form a squadron, the [[16th Special Operations Squadron]] (SOS) of the [[8th Tactical Fighter Wing]] (TFW), at [[Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base]], Thailand. It was at this time that the C-130A gunship was designated the AC-130A.

On 18 August 1968, an AC-130 gunship flying an armed reconnaissance mission in Vietnam's III Corps was diverted to support a Special Forces base at Katum. The ground commander quickly assessed the accurate fire and capabilities of this weapon system and called for fire on his own perimeter when the Viet Cong attempted to bridge the wire on the west side of his position.

By December 1968 most AC-130s were flown under [[F-4 Phantom II]] escort (to protect the gunship against heavy and concentrated AAA fire) from the 497th Tactical Fighter Squadron, normally three Phantoms per Gunship. In late 1969, under the code name of "Surprise Package", 56-0490 arrived with solid-state laser-illuminated low-light-level-TV with a companion YAG [[laser designator]], an improved [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) sensor, video recording for TV and FLIR, an [[inertial navigation system]], and a prototype [[Digital data|digital]] [[fire control computer]]. The remaining AC-130s were refitted with upgraded similar equipment in the summer of 1970, and then redeployed to Ubon RTAFB. On 25 October 1971, the first "Cadillac" gunship, the AC-130E arrived in Vietnam. On 17 February 1972, the first 105&nbsp;mm cannon arrived for service with Spectre and was installed on Gunship 570. It was used from mid-February until the aircraft received battle damage to its right flap. The 105 was switched to Gunship 571 and was used until 30 March when the aircraft was shot down.

On 28 January 1973, the Vietnam peace accord went into effect, marking the end of Spectre operations in Vietnam. Spectre was still needed and active in the region, supporting operations in Laos and Cambodia. On 22 February 1973, American offensive operations in Laos ended and the gunships became totally committed to operations in the Cambodian conflict.

On 12 April 1975 Khmer Rouge were threatening the capital of Phnom Penh and AC-130s were called upon to help in Operation EAGLE PULL, the final evacuation of American and allied officials from Phnom Penh before it fell to the communists. The AC-130 was also over Saigon 30 April 1975 to protect the final evacuation in [[Operation Frequent Wind]]. When the [[Mayaguez incident|SS Mayaguez]] was seized by Khmer Rouge soldiers and sailors on 15 May 1975, on the open sea, Spectres were called upon.

AC-130s destroyed more than 10,000 trucks and participated in many crucial close air support missions in Vietnam.

Six Spectres and 52 aircrew members were lost to enemy fire. On 24 May 1969, Spectre lost its first gunship.<ref>Page 268:Hobson, Chris.

[[File:AC-130A pylon turn.jpg|thumb|AC-130A performs a left-hand [[pylon turn]]]]

===Cold War and later action===
With the conclusion of hostilities in Southeast Asia in the mid-1970s, the AC-130H became the sole gunship in the regular Air Force, home based at [[Hurlburt Field]], Florida, while the AC-130A fleet was transferred to the [[Air Force Reserve]]'s 919th Tactical Airlift Group (919 TAG) at [[Eglin AFB]] Auxiliary Field #3/[[Duke Field]], Florida.  With the transition to the AC-130A, the 919 TAG was then redesignated as the [[919th Special Operations Wing|919th Special Operations Group]] (919 SOG).

In the late 1970s when the AC-130H fleet was first being modified for in-flight refueling capability, a demonstration mission was planned and flown from Hurlburt Field, Florida, non-stop, to conduct a 2-hour live-fire mission over Empire Firing Range in the Republic of Panama, then return home. This 13-hour mission with two in-flight refuelings from [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135]] tankers proved the validity of flying long-range missions outside the [[contiguous United States]] to attack targets then return to home base without intermediate stops.

AC-130s from both the [[4th Special Operations Squadron|4th]] and [[16th Special Operations Squadron|16th]] Special Operations Squadrons have been deployed in nearly every conflict the United States has been involved in, officially and unofficially, since the end of the Vietnam War.

In July 1979, AC-130H crews deployed to [[Howard Air Force Base]], Panama, as a precaution against possible hostile actions against American personnel during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]. New time aloft and non-stop distance records were subsequently set by a 16th SOS 2-ship AC-130H formation flight that departed Hurlburt Field on 13 November 1979 and landed on 15 November at [[Andersen Air Force Base]], [[Guam]], a distance of {{convert|7200|nmi|km}} and 29 hours 43 minutes non-stop, refueling four times in-flight.<ref>this flight was documented in Lockheed records and in an article by pilot Lt Col Jim Lawrence in the June 1995 edition of AFSOC Night Flyer magazine</ref> Refueling support for the Guam deployment was provided by KC-135 crews from the 305th Air Refueling Wing from [[Grissom AFB]], Indiana.

In November 1979, four AC-130H gunships flew nonstop from Hurlburt Field to Anderson AFB, Guam, because of the hostage situation at the Embassy in Iran. At Guam, AC-130H crews developed communications-out/lights-out refueling procedures for later employment by trial-and-error. This deployment with the 1 SOW/CC as Task Force commander was directed from the office of the CJCS for fear that Iranian militants could begin executing American Embassy personnel who had been [[Iran hostage crisis|taken hostage on 4 November]]. One early option considered AC-130H retaliatory punitive strikes deep within Iran. Later gunship flights exceeded the 1979 Hurlburt-to-Guam flight.

Upon return in March 1980, the four planes soon found themselves in Egypt to support the ill-fated hostage rescue attempt.

During [[Invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]] in Grenada in 1983, AC-130s suppressed enemy air defense systems and attacked ground forces enabling the assault of the [[Point Salines International Airport|Point Salines Airfield]] via [[airdrop]] and air-land of friendly forces. The AC-130 aircrew earned the [[William H. Tunner|Lieutenant General William H. Tunner]] Award for the mission.

The AC-130Hs of the [[16th Special Operations Squadron]] unit maintained an ongoing rotation to Howard AB, Panama, monitoring activities in El Salvador and other Central American points of interest, with rules of engagement eventually permitting attacks on [[FMLN]] targets.  This commitment of Maintainers and crews started in 1983 and lasted until 1990.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Tom|title=El Salvador, 1980-1992|url=http://www.acig.info/CMS/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=89&Itemid=47|publisher=ACIG.org|accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref>  The AC-130 is considered to have hastened the end of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in the 1980s. Crews flew undercover missions from Honduras and attacked guerrilla camps and concentrations.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

AC-130s also had a primary role during the [[United States invasion of Panama]] (named Operation Just Cause) 1989 when they destroyed [[Military of Panama|Panama Defense Force]] headquarters and numerous command-and-control facilities, and provided close air support for U.S. ground troops. Aircrews earned the [[Mackay Trophy]] for the most meritorious flight of the year, and the Tunner Award.

During the [[Gulf War]] of 1990–91 (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm), Regular Air Force and Air Force Reserve AC-130s provided close air support and force protection (air base defense) for ground forces, and battlefield interdiction. The primary interdiction targets were early warning/[[Ground-controlled interception|ground control intercept]] (EW/GCI) sites along the southern border of [[Iraq]]. The first gunship to enter the [[Battle of Khafji]] helped stop a southbound Iraqi armored column on 29 January 1991. One day later three more gunships provided further aid to [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] participating in the operation. The gunships attacked Iraqi positions and columns moving south to reinforce their positions north of the city.

Despite the threat of [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs) and increasing visibility during the early morning hours of 31 January 1991, one AC-130H, AF Serial No. 69-6567, call-sign Spirit 03, opted to stay to continue to protect the Marines. A lone Iraqi with a [[Strela-2]] [[MANPAD]] shot Spirit 03 down, and all 14 crew members died.<ref>[http://www.specialoperations.com/Memorial/spirit.html Spirit 03 and the Battle for Khafji]</ref>

The military has used AC-130 gunships during the humanitarian operations in [[Somalia]] ([[Unified Task Force|Operation Restore Hope]] and [[Operation United Shield]]) in 1992–93, [[Operation Uphold Democracy]] in Haiti in 1994. AC-130s took part in [[Timeline of United States military operations#1991-1999|Operation Assured Response]] in Liberia in 1996 and in [[Operation Silver Wake]] in 1997, the evacuation of American [[non-combatants]] from [[Albania]].

AC-130s took part in the [[NATO]] missions in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Kosovo]] during the 1990s.

[[File:AC-130 firing night.gif|thumb|Weapons fire during a night mission]]

The AC-130U gunship set a new record for the longest sustained flight by any C-130 on 22 and 23 October 1997, when two AC-130U gunships flew 36 hours nonstop from [[Hurlburt Field]], Florida to [[Taegu Air Base]] (Daegu), [[South Korea]], being refueled seven times in the air by KC-135 tankers. The two gunships took on 410,000&nbsp;lb (186,000&nbsp;kg) of fuel. Gunships also were part of the buildup of U.S. forces in 1998 to compel [[Iraq]] to allow [[UNSCOM]] weapons inspections.

===Operations since 2001===
The United States used gunships during [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|War in Afghanistan]] (Operation Enduring Freedom) in Afghanistan (2001–&nbsp;), and [[Iraq War]] (Operation Iraqi Freedom) in Iraq (2003–2010). In 2007, U.S. Special Operations forces also used the AC-130 in attacks on suspected [[al-Qaeda]] militants in Somalia.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070111194741/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/01/08/somalia.strike/index.html? "Pentagon official: U.S. attacks al Qaeda suspects in Somalia"]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6296971.stm "US plane 'bombed Somalia targets'"]</ref>

Close air support was the main mission of the AC–130 in Iraq. Night after night, at least one AC–130 was in the air to fulfill one or more air support requests (ASRs). A typical mission had the AC–130 supporting a single brigade’s ASRs followed by aerial refueling and another 2 hours with another brigade or SOF team. The use of AC-130s in places like Fallujah, urban settings where insurgents were among crowded populations of non combatants, was criticized by human rights groups.  AC-130s were also used for intelligence gathering with their sophisticated long-range video, infrared and radar sensors.

AC-130 strikes were directed by special forces on known Taliban locations during the early days of the war in Afghanistan. U.S. Special Operations Forces are using the AC-130 to support its operations.  The day after arriving in Afghanistan, the AC-130s attacked Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces near the city of Konduz and were directly responsible for the city's surrender the next day. On 26 November 2001, AC-130 Spectres were called in to put down a rebellion at the prison fort of Qala-i-Janghi. The 16 SOS flew missions over Mazar-E-Shariff, Konduz, Kandahar, Shkin, Asadabad, Bagram, Baghran, Tora Bora, and virtually every other part of Afghanistan. Spectre participated in countless operations within Afghanistan, performing on-call close air support and armed reconnaissance.

In March 2002, three AC-130 Spectres provided 39 crucial combat missions in support of [[Operation Anaconda]] in Afghanistan. During the intense fighting, the planes expended more than 1,300 40&nbsp;mm and 1,200 105&nbsp;mm rounds.

There are eight AC-130H and seventeen AC-130U aircraft in active-duty service as of July 2010.<ref name="AF_factsht"/>

In March 2011, the U.S. Air Force deployed two AC-130U gunships to take part in [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]], the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|U.S. military intervention in Libya]],<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-28/coalition-isn-t-coordinating-strikes-with-rebels-u-s-says-1-.html "Coalition Isn’t Coordinating Strikes With Rebels, U.S. Says"] By Brendan McGarry, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]. 28 March 2011</ref> which eventually came under [[NATO]] as [[Operation Unified Protector]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/us/29military.html?partner=rss&emc=rss |title= U.S. Gives Its Air Power Expansive Role in Libya |last=Schmitt |first=Eric |date= 29 March 2011 |work=New York Times |page=A13 |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref>

As of September 2013, 14 MC-130W Dragon Spear aircraft have been converted to AC-130W Stinger II gunships.  The Stinger gunships have been deployed to Afghanistan to replace the aging AC-130H and provide an example for the new AC-130J Ghostrider.  Modifications began with crews cutting holes in the plane to make room for weapons, and adding kits and bomb bases for laser-guided munitions.  Crews added a 105&nbsp;mm cannon, 20 in infrared and electro-optical sensors, and the ability to carry 250-pound bombs on the wings.<ref>[http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20130917/NEWS04/309170016/AFSOC-s-new-weapon-Portable-unmanned-aircraft-bases AFSOC's new weapon: Portable unmanned aircraft bases] - Militarytimes.com, 17 September 2013</ref>

[[File:AC-130 Spectre.jpg|thumb|[[Nose art]] on AC-130A AF Serial No. 53-3129 at the USAF Armament Museum, Eglin AFB, Florida]]

One of the first seven AC-130A aircraft deployed to [[Vietnam]] was AF Serial No. 53-3129, named ''First Lady'' in November 1970. This aircraft was a conversion of the first production C-130. On 25 March 1971, it took an [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft artillery]] hit in the belly just aft of the nose gear wheel well over the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] in Laos. The 37&nbsp;mm shell destroyed everything below the crew deck and barely missed striking two crew members. In 1975, after the conclusion of US involvement in the Vietnam war, it was transferred to the [[Air Force Reserve Command|Air Force Reserve]], where it served with the [[711th Special Operations Squadron]] of the [[919th Special Operations Wing]]. In 1980, the aircraft was upgraded from the original three-bladed propellers to the quieter four-bladed propellers and was eventually retired in late 1995. The retirement also marked an end to the [[Air Force Reserve Command]] flying the AC-130A. The aircraft now sits on display in the final Air Force Reserve Command configuration with grey paint, black markings, and the four-bladed Hamilton Sunstrand 54H60-91 props at the [[Air Force Armament Museum]] at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], Florida, USA.<ref>[http://www.gunships.org/birds.html "List of AC-130 Gunships."]{{dead link|date=June 2011}} ''gunships.org.''

A second AC-130A, AF Serial No. 56-0509, named the ''Ultimate End'', was accepted by the Air Force on 28 February 1957, and modified to the AC-130A configuration on 27 July 1970. The aircraft participated in the Vietnam War and the [[Mayaguez incident|rescue]] of the [[SS Mayaguez]]. ''Ultimate End'' demonstrated the durability of the C-130 after surviving hits in five places by 37&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft artillery on 12 December 1970, extensive left wing leading edge damage on 12 April 1971 and a 57&nbsp;mm round damaging the belly and injuring one crewman on 4 March 1972. "Ultimate End" was reassigned to the [[Air Force Reserve]]'s [[919th Special Operations Wing]] at [[Eglin AFB]] Auxiliary Field No.3 / [[Duke Field]] on 17 June 1975, where it continued in service until retired in the fall 1994 and transferred to [[Air Force Special Operations Command]]'s ''Heritage Air Park'' at [[Hurlburt Field]], Florida. While assigned to the [[711th Special Operations Squadron]], ''Ultimate End'' served in Operations JUST CAUSE in Panama, [[DESERT STORM]] in Kuwait and Iraq, and UPHOLD DEMOCRACY in Haiti. After 36 years and seven months of service, 24 years as a gunship, ''Ultimate End'' retired from active service on 1 October 1994. It made its last flight from [[Duke Field]] to [[Hurlburt Field]] on 20 October 1994. The Spectre Association dedicated "Ultimate End" (which served with the 16 SOS in Vietnam) on 4 May 1995. Lt Col Michael Byers, then 16 SOS commander, represented the active-duty gunship force and Clyde Gowdy of the Spectre Association represented all Spectre personnel past and present for the unveiling of a monument at the aircraft and the dedication as a whole.<ref>[http://www.hurlburt.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3423 AC-130A Spectre]. USAF Hurlburt Field</ref>

A third AC-130A, AF Serial No. 54-1630, is on display in the Cold War Gallery at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] at [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], Ohio. Named ''Azrael'' for the [[Azrael|angel of death]] who severs the soul from the body in the Koran.  This aircraft figured prominently in the closing hours of Operation Desert Storm. On 26 February 1991, Coalition ground forces were driving the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait. With an Air Force Reserve crew called to active duty, Azrael was sent to the [[Highway of Death|Al Jahra highway]] (Highway 80) between [[Kuwait City]] and [[Basra]], Iraq, to intercept the convoys of tanks, trucks, buses, and cars fleeing the battle. Facing [[SA-6]] and [[SA-8]] surface-to-air missiles and 37&nbsp;mm and 57&nbsp;mm radar-guided anti-aircraft artillery the crew attacked and destroyed or disabled most of the convoys. ''Azrael'' was also assigned to the [[919th Special Operations Wing]] and retired to the museum in October 1995.<ref>[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=412 Lockheed AC-130A Spectre], [http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/071106-F-1234S-006.jpg image]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}. National Museum of the United States Air Force. Retrieved 17 July 2010.</ref>

Another AC-130A, AF Serial No. 54-1626, the original prototype AC-130 named "Gunship II" is on display at the outdoor Air Park at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] at [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], Ohio.<ref>[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3216 Lockheed AC-130A], [http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/051128-F-1234P-066.jpg image]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}. National Museum of the United States Air Force. Retrieved 17 July 2010.</ref>  This aircraft served in Southeast Asia from 1967 to 1972, then served in JC-130A test configuration. It was transferred to the National Museum of the United States Air Force in 1976, and converted back to AC-130A configuration in the late 1990s.

AC-130A Serial No. 54-1623, c/n 3010, named "Ghost Rider" served in Southeast Asia and later conflicts until being retired in 1997 to [[Dobbins AFB]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Ghost Rider eventually was transferred and displayed at the Lockheed Museum at [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]], Georgia.
