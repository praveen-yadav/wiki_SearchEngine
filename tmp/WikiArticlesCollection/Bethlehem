The [[Hebrew Bible]] identifies Bethlehem as the city of [[David]]. The [[New Testament]] identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of [[Jesus]]. The town is inhabited by one of the oldest Christian communities in the world, although the size of the community has shrunk due to emigration. Bethlehem was sacked by the [[Samaritans]] in 529, but rebuilt by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I]]. Bethlehem was conquered by the [[Rashidun|Arab Caliphate]] of [[Umar|'Umar ibn al-Khattāb]] in 637, who guaranteed safety for the city's religious shrines. In 1099, Crusaders captured and fortified Bethlehem and replaced its [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] clergy with a [[Catholic Church|Latin]] one. The Latin clergy were expelled after the city was captured by [[Saladin]], the [[sultan]] of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]. With the coming of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] in 1250, the city's walls were demolished, and were subsequently rebuilt during the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name="BMH">{{cite web

The British wrested control of the city from the Ottomans during [[World War I]] and it was to be included in an [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|international zone]] under the 1947 [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]]. [[Jordan]] annexed the city in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. It was occupied by [[Israel]] in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. Since 1995, Bethlehem has been governed by the Palestinian National Authority.<ref name="BMH"/>

Bethlehem has a [[Muslim]] majority, but is also home to one of the largest [[Palestinian Christians|Palestinian Christian]] communities. Bethlehem's chief [[economy|economic sector]] is tourism which peaks during the [[Christmas]] season when Christian pilgrims throng to the [[Church of the Nativity]]. Bethlehem has over thirty hotels and three hundred handicraft work shops.<ref name="Patience">{{cite news

==History==

===Canaanite period===
A historical reference to the town appears in the [[Amarna letters|Amarna Letters]] (c. 1400 BC) when the King of Jerusalem appeals to his overlord, the King of Egypt, for help in retaking "''Bit-Lahmi''" in the wake of disturbances by the [[Habiru|Apiru]].<ref>"''Oxford Archeological Guides: The Holy Land''", [[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]], pp. 198–199, Oxford University Press, 1998, ISBN 0-19-288013-6.</ref> It is thought that the similarity of this name to its modern forms indicates that this was a settlement of Canaanites who shared a Semitic cultural and linguistic heritage with the later arrivals.<ref>"''International Dictionary of Historic Places: Vol 4, Middle East and Africa''", Trudy Ring, K.A Berney, Robert M. Salkin, Sharon La Boda, Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger, p. 133, Taylor & Francis, 1996, ISBN 1-884964-03-6.</ref>

''[[Lachmo]]'' was the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Akkadian]] god of fertility. Worshiped by the [[Canaanites]] as ''[[Lachama]]'', some time in the 3rd millennium BC, they erected a temple to worship the god on the hill now known as the Hill of the Nativity. The town was known as ''Beit Lachama'', meaning "House of Lachama."<ref name=Loschp51>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=S5GJaakRvPgC&pg=PA51&dq=bethlehem+canaanite#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The uttermost part of the earth: a guide to places in the Bible|author=Richard R. Losch|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8028-2805-7}}</ref> [[William F. Albright]] notes the pronunciation of the name remained essentially the same for 3,500 years, but has meant different things: "'Temple of the God Lakhmu' in Canaanite, 'House of Bread' in Hebrew and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], 'House of Meat' in Arabic."

===Israelite and Judean period===
Archaeological confirmation of Bethlehem as an Israelite city was uncovered in 2012 at the archaeological dig at the [[City of David]] in the form of a ''[[Bulla (seal)|bulla]]'' (seal impression in dried clay) in ancient Hebrew script that reads "From the town of Bethlehem to the King," indicating that it was used to seal the string closing a shipment of grain, wine, or other goods sent as a tax payment in the 8th or 7th century BC.<ref>Israel Antiquities Authority, May, 2012, http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=25&subj_id=240&id=1938&module_id=#as</ref>

Biblical scholars believe Bethlehem, located in the "hill country" of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], may be the same as the Biblical [[Ephrath]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Gen.|35:16}}, {{bibleverse||Gen.|48:27}}, {{bibleverse||Ruth|4:11}}</ref> which means "fertile", as there is a reference to it in the [[Book of Micah]] as Bethlehem Ephratah.<ref>{{bibleverse||Micah|5:2}}</ref> The Bible also calls it Beth-Lehem Judah,<ref>{{bibleverse||Sam|17:12}}</ref> and the "'''City of David'''".<ref name="qjukjz">{{bibleverse||Luke|2:4|KJV}}</ref> It is first mentioned in the [[Tanakh]] and the Bible as the place where the matriarch [[Rachel]] died and was buried "by the wayside" (Gen. 48:7). [[Rachel's Tomb]], the traditional grave site, stands at the entrance to Bethlehem. According to the [[Book of Ruth]], the valley to the east is where [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] of [[Moab]] gleaned the fields and returned to town with [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]]. It was the home of [[Jesse]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Sam|16:1}}</ref> father of King [[David]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]], and the site of David's anointment by the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]].<ref>{{bibleverse||Sam|16:4-13}}</ref> It was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his warriors brought him water when he was hiding in the cave of [[Adullam]].<ref>{{bibleverse||Sam|23:13-17}}</ref>

Writing in the 4th century, the [[Pilgrim of Bordeaux]] reported that the sepulchers of [[David]], [[Ezekiel]], [[Asaph (Bible)|Asaph]], [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]], [[Jesse]], and [[Solomon]] were located near Bethlehem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centuryone.com/bordeaux.html |title=The Bordeaux Pilgrim @ |publisher=Centuryone.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> There has been no corroboration of this.

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Bethlehem Polenov.jpg|thumb|right|A painting of Bethlehem, 1882]]

Between 132 and 135 the city was reoccupied by the Romans after its capture during the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]. Its Jewish residents were expelled by the [[military order]] of [[Hadrian]].<ref>

During the [[Samaritan Revolts|Samaritan revolt]] of 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its walls and the Church of the Nativity destroyed, but they were rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor [[Justinian I]]. In 614, the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Sassanid Empire]], supported by [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius|Jewish rebels]], invaded [[Palestina Prima]] and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the [[magi]] depicted in [[Iranian art|Persian]] clothing in a mosaic.<ref name="BMH"/>

===Islamic and Crusader rule===
In 637, shortly after [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|Jerusalem was captured]] by the [[Rashidun army|Muslim armies]], [[Umar|'Umar ibn al-Khattāb]], the second [[Caliph]], promised that the Church of the Nativity would be preserved for Christian use.<ref name="BMH"/> A [[Mosque of Omar (Bethlehem)|mosque]] dedicated to Umar was built upon the place in the city where he prayed, next to the church.<ref name="ATT">{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> Bethlehem then passed through the control of the Islamic caliphates of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] in the 8th century, then the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] in the 9th century. A [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer recorded in the mid-9th century that a well preserved and much venerated church existed in the town. In 985, the [[Arab people|Arab]] geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]] visited Bethlehem, and referred to its church as the "Basilica of Constantine, the equal of which does not exist anywhere in the country-round."<ref>le Strange, 1890, pp. 298–300.</ref> In 1009, during the reign of the sixth Fatimid Caliph, [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], the Church of the Nativity was ordered to be demolished, but was spared by local Muslims, because they had been permitted to worship in the structure's southern transept.<ref>{{cite web

In 1099, Bethlehem was captured by the [[First Crusade|Crusaders]], who fortified it and built a new monastery and cloister on the north side of the Church of the Nativity. The [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] clergy were removed from their [[Episcopal see|sees]] and replaced with [[Catholic Church|Latin]] clerics. Up until that point the official Christian presence in the region was Greek Orthodox. On Christmas Day 1100, [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]], first king of the Frankish [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a Latin episcopate was also established in the town.<ref name="BMH"/>

In 1187, [[Saladin]], the Sultan of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] who led the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Muslim Ayyubids]], captured Bethlehem from the Crusaders. The Latin clerics were forced to leave, allowing the Greek Orthodox clergy to return. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, Bethlehem suffered from the loss of the pilgrim trade, as there was a sharp decrease of European pilgrims.<ref name="BMH"/>

[[William IV, Count of Nevers]] had promised the Christian bishops of Bethlehem that if Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control, he would welcome them in the small town of [[Clamecy, Nièvre|Clamecy]] in present-day [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], France. As such, The Bishop of Bethlehem duly took up residence in the hospital of Panthenor, Clamecy, in 1223. Clamecy remained the continuous '[[Titular see|in partibus infidelium]]' seat of the Bishopric of Bethlehem for almost 600 years, until the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.<ref>de Sivry, L: "Dictionnaire de Geographie Ecclesiastique", p. 375., 1852 ed, from ecclesiastical record of letters between the Bishops of Bethlehem 'in partibus' to the bishops of Auxerre.</ref>

Bethlehem—along with Jerusalem, [[Nazareth]], and [[Sidon]]—was briefly ceded to the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] by a treaty between [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and Ayyubid Sultan [[al-Kamil]] in 1229, in return for a ten-year truce between the Ayyubids and the Crusaders. The treaty expired in 1239, and Bethlehem was recaptured by the Muslims in 1244.<ref>Paul Reed, 2000, p. 206.</ref>

In 1250, with the coming to power of the [[Mamluk]]s under [[Baibars|Rukn al-Din Baibars]], tolerance of Christianity declined; the clergies left the city, and in 1263 the town walls were demolished. The Latin clergy returned to Bethlehem the following century, establishing themselves in the monastery adjoining the Basilica of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox were given control of the basilica and shared control of the Milk Grotto with the Latins and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenians]].<ref name="BMH"/>

===Ottoman and Egyptian rule===

[[File:Bethlehem 1898.jpg|thumb|right|View of Bethlehem, 1898]]
[[File:Bethlehem street 1880.jpg|thumb|upright|Bethlehem, 1880]]
From 1517, during the years of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control, custody of the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox churches]].<ref name="BMH"/> By the end of the 16th century, Bethlehem had become one of the largest villages in the District of Jerusalem, and was subdivided into seven quarters.<ref name="Singer"/> The Basbus family served as the heads of Bethlehem among other leaders during this period.<ref>Singer, 1994, p. 33.</ref> The Ottoman tax record and census from 1596 indicates that Bethlehem had a population of 1,435, making it the 13th largest village in Palestine at the time. Its total revenue amounted to 30,000 [[akce]].<ref name="Petersen141">Petersen, 2005, p. 141.</ref>

Bethlehem paid taxes on wheat, barley, and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were organized into separate communities, each having its own leader; five leaders represented the village in the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest that the Christian population was slightly more prosperous or grew more grain than grapes (the former being a more valuable commodity).<ref>Singer, 1994, p. 84.</ref>

From 1831 to 1841, Palestine was under the rule of the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty]] of [[Egypt]]. During this period, the town suffered an earthquake as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter in 1834 by Egyptian troops, apparently as a reprisal for the murder of a favored loyalist of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]].<ref>Thomson, 1860, p. 647.</ref> In 1841, Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once more and remained so until the end of World War I. Under the Ottomans, Bethlehem's inhabitants faced unemployment, [[Conscription|compulsory military service]], and heavy taxes, resulting in mass emigration, particularly to [[South America]].<ref name="BMH"/> An American missionary in the 1850s reported a population of under 4,000, nearly all of whom belonged to the Greek Church. He also noted that a lack of water crippled the town's growth.<ref>W. M. Thomson, p. 647.</ref>

Jordan retained control of the city until the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, when Bethlehem was captured by Israel, along with the rest of the [[West Bank]]. Following the Six-Day War, Israel took control of the city. In 1995, Israel turned it over to the Palestinian National Authority in accordance with the [[Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip|Oslo peace accord]].

[[File:Jesus birthplace in Bethlehem.jpg|thumb|right|Silver star marking the place where Jesus was born according to Christian tradition]]
Two accounts in the [[New Testament]] describe [[Jesus]] as being born in Bethlehem. According to the [[Gospel of Luke]],<ref name="qjukjz"/> [[Jesus]]' parents lived in [[Nazareth]] and travelled for the [[Census of Quirinius]] to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born, after which they returned home. The [[Gospel of Matthew]] account implies that the family already lived in Bethlehem and later fled to Nazareth to escape persecution. Matthew says that [[Herod the Great]], told that a 'King of the Jews' has been born in Bethlehem, ordered the killing of all the children aged two and under in the town and surrounding areas. [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] is warned of this in a dream, and the family escapes this fate by fleeing to Egypt and returning only after Herod has died. Most modern biographers of Herod doubt the massacre was a real event.<ref>"most recent biographies of Herod the Great deny it entirely." Paul L. Maier, "Herod and the Infants of Bethlehem", in Chronos, Kairos, Christos II, Mercer University Press (1998), p.170</ref>

The existence of early traditions of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem is attested by the [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] [[Justin Martyr]], who stated in his ''Dialogue with Trypho'' (c. 155–161) that the [[Holy Family]] had taken refuge in a cave outside of the town.<ref>Taylor, 1993, pp.&nbsp;99–100. "Joseph... took up his quarters in a certain cave near the village; and while they were there Mary brought forth the Christ and placed him in a manger, and here the Magi who came from Arabia found him."(Justin Martyr, ''Dialogue with Trypho'', chapter LXXVIII).</ref> [[Origen|Origen of Alexandria]], writing around the year 247, referred to a cave in the town of Bethlehem which local people believed was the birthplace of Jesus.<ref>In Bethlehem the cave is pointed out where he was born, and the manger in the cave where he was wrapped in swaddling clothes. And the rumor is in those places, and among foreigners of the Faith, that indeed Jesus was born in this cave who is worshipped and reverenced by the Christians. (Origen, ''[[Contra Celsum]]'', book I, chapter LI).</ref>

===Christmas celebrations===
[[File:Bethlehem Christmas2.JPG|thumb|upright|Catholic procession on [[Christmas Eve]], 2006]]
Christmas rites are held in Bethlehem on three different dates: December 25 is the traditional date by the Roman Catholic and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations, but Greek, [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian Orthodox]] Christians celebrate Christmas on January 6 and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Orthodox]] Christians on January 19.

[[File:Bethlehem woman edited.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Woman in traditional Bethlehem costume]]
Bethlehem work was unique in its use of couched gold or silver cord, or silk cord onto the silk, wool, felt or velvet used for the garment, to create stylized floral patterns with free or rounded lines. This technique was used for "royal" [[wedding dress]]es (''thob malak''), taqsirehs and the ''shatwehs'' worn by married women. It has been traced by some to [[Byzantium]], and by others to the formal costumes of the Ottoman Empire's elite. As a Christian village, local women were also exposed to the detailing on church vestments with their heavy embroidery and silver brocade.<ref name=PCA2/>

Bethlehem held its first municipal elections in 1876, after the ''mukhtars'' ("heads") of the quarters of Bethlehem's Old City (excluding the Syriac Quarter) made the decision to elect a local council of seven members to represent each clan in the town. A [[Basic law|Basic Law]] was established so that if the victor for mayor was a Catholic, his deputy should be of the Greek Orthodox community.<ref name="BME"/>

Throughout, Bethlehem's rule by the British and Jordan, the Syriac Quarter was allowed to participate in the election, as were the Ta'amrah [[Bedouin]]s and Palestinian refugees, hence ratifying the number of municipal members in the council to 11. In 1976, an amendment was passed to allow women to vote and become council members and later the voting age was increased from 21 to 25.<ref name="BME">[http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/TempVewMenuSub.php?Mid=6 Municipal Council Elections during the British and Jordanian Periods] Bethlehem Municipal Council.</ref>

Today, the Bethlehem Municipal Council consists of 15 elected members, including the mayor and deputy mayor. A special statute requires that the mayor and a majority of the municipal council be Christian, while the remainder are open seats, not restricted to any religion.<ref name="Day"/>

There are several branches of political parties on the council, including [[Communism|Communist]], [[Islamism|Islamist]], and secular. The leftist factions of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) such as the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) and the [[Palestinian People's Party]] (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. [[Hamas]] gained the majority of the open seats in the 2005 [[Palestinian municipal elections, 2005|Palestinian municipal elections]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/Counil/index.php |title=Bethlehem Municipality(Site Under Construction) |accessdate=2008-01-22 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080118135922/http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/Counil/index.php |archivedate=January 18, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

In the October 2012 municipal elections, Fatah member Vera Baboun won, becoming the first female mayor of Bethlehem.<ref name="wafa"/>

==Education==
According to the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS), in 1997, approximately 84% of Bethlehem's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 10,414 were enrolled in schools (4,015 in [[primary education|primary school]], 3,578 in secondary and 2,821 in high school). About 14.1% of high school students received diplomas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/bet_t3.aspx |title=Palestinian Population (10 Years and Over) by Locality, Sex and Educational Attainment |accessdate=2008-01-22 |publisher=[[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]]}}</ref> There were 135 schools in the [[Bethlehem Governorate]] in 2006; 100 run the [[Education Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority]], seven by the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA) and 28 were private.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mohe.gov.ps/downloads/pdffiles/statisticE.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061014122612/http://www.mohe.gov.ps/downloads/pdffiles/statisticE.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-14 |title=Statistics about General Education in Palestine 2005-2006 |publisher=[[Education Minister of the Palestinian National Authority]] |accessdate=2008-01-22|format=PDF}}</ref>

Bethlehem is home to [[Bethlehem University]], a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christian co-educational institution of higher learning founded in 1973 in the Lasallian tradition, open to students of all faiths. Bethlehem University is the first university established in the West Bank, and can trace its roots to 1893 when the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|De La Salle Christian Brothers]] opened schools throughout Palestine and Egypt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bethlehem.edu/about/mission-history |title=Mission and History |publisher=[[Bethlehem University]] |date= |accessdate=29 November 2013}}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Bethlehem-street2.JPG|thumb|upright|A street in Bethlehem]]
Bethlehem has three bus stations owned by private companies which offer service to Jerusalem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahour, [[Hebron]], [[Nahalin]], [[Battir]], [[al-Khader]], [[al-Ubeidiya]] and [[Beit Fajjar]]. There are two taxi stations that make trips to Beit Sahour, Beit Jala, Jerusalem, [[Tuqu']] and [[Herodium]]. There are also two car rental departments: Murad and 'Orabi. Buses and taxis with West Bank licenses are not allowed to enter Israel, including Jerusalem, without a permit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/City/TransSys.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071227075741/http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/City/TransSys.php |archivedate=2007-12-27 |title=Bethlehem Public Transport System |accessdate=2008-01-22}} Bethlehem Municipality.</ref>

The Israeli construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|West Bank barrier]] has had an impact on Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier runs along the northern side of the town's built-up area, within meters of houses in 'Aida [[refugee camp]] on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other.<ref name=OCHA/> Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration to the rest of the [[West Bank]] are currently subject to [[Israel Defense Forces checkpoint|Israeli checkpoints]] and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into [[Jerusalem]] is regulated by a permit-system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/b45e8d8caacda74785256dbb0062e7b9?OpenDocument |title=Impact of Israel's separation barrier on affected West Bank communities - OCHA update report #2 |date=30 September 2003 |accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref> Palestinians require a permit to enter the Jewish holy site of [[Rachel's Tomb]].
