'''Computation''' is any type of [[calculation]]<ref>http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/computation</ref> or use of computing technology in [[information processing]].<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/computation Computation] from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary</ref><ref>http://www.answers.com/topic/computation</ref> Computation is a process following a well-defined [[Model (abstract)|model]] understood and expressed as, for example, an [[algorithm]], or a [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]].

The study of computation is paramount to the discipline of [[computer science]].

{{Wiktionary|computation}}

== Classification ==
Computation can be classified by mainly three unique criteria: [[Digital data|digital]] versus [[analog electronics|analog]], [[sequential]] versus [[parallel computation|parallel]] versus [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]], [[batch processing|batch]] versus [[interactive computation|interactive]].

In practice, digital computation aids simulation of natural processes (for example, [[evolutionary computation]]), including those that are naturally described by analog models of computation (for example, [[artificial neural network]]). 

== Physical phenomenon ==
A computation can be seen as a purely physical phenomenon occurring inside a closed [[physical system]] called a [[computer]].
Examples of such physical systems include [[digital computer]]s, [[mechanical computer]]s, [[quantum computer]]s, [[DNA computer]]s, [[molecular computer]]s, [[analog computer]]s or [[wetware computer]]s.
This point of view is the one adopted by the branch of theoretical physics called the [[physics of computation]].

An even more radical point of view is the postulate of [[digital physics]] that the evolution of the universe itself is a computation - [[pancomputationalism]].

== Mathematical models ==
In the [[theory of computation]], a diversity of mathematical models of computers have been developed.
Typical mathematical [[Model of computation|models of computers]] are the following:
* State models including [[Turing machine]], [[push-down automaton]], [[finite state automaton]], and [[Parallel random access machine|PRAM]]
* Functional models including [[lambda calculus]]
* Logical models including [[logic programming]]
* Concurrent models including [[actor model]] and [[process calculi]]

== History ==
The word computation has an archaic meaning (from its [[Latin language|Latin]] etymological roots), but the word has come back in use with the arising of a new scientific discipline: computer science.
