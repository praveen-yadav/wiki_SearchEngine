'''Denaturation''' is a process in which [[proteins]] or [[nucleic acids]] lose the [[quaternary structure]], [[tertiary structure]] and [[secondary structure]] which is present in their [[native state]], by application of some external stress or compound such as a strong [[acid]] or [[base (chemistry)|base]], a concentrated [[inorganic]] salt, an [[organic compound|organic]] solvent (e.g., [[alcohol]] or [[chloroform]]), radiation or [[heat]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Mosby's Medical Dictionary|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Denaturation+%28biochemistry%29|accessdate=September 2013|edition=8th |year=2009|publisher=[[Elsevier]]}}</ref> If proteins in a living cell are denatured, this results in disruption of cell activity and possibly cell death. Denatured proteins can exhibit a wide range of characteristics, from loss of solubility to [[communal aggregation]].

This concept is unrelated to [[denatured alcohol]], which is alcohol that has been mixed with additives to make it unsuitable for human consumption.

== Common examples ==
When food is cooked, some of its proteins become denatured. This is why boiled eggs become hard and cooked meat becomes firm.

A classic example of denaturing in proteins comes from [[egg white]]s, which are typically largely egg [[ovalbumin|albumin]]s in water. Fresh from the eggs, egg whites are transparent and liquid. Cooking the [[Thermostability|thermally unstable]] whites turns them opaque, forming an interconnected solid mass. The same transformation can be effected with a denaturing chemical. Pouring egg whites into a beaker of [[acetone]] will also turn egg whites translucent and solid. The skin that forms on [[curdled]] milk is another common example of denatured protein. The cold appetizer known as [[ceviche]] is prepared by chemically "cooking" raw fish and shellfish in an acidic citrus marinade, without heat.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/article4220254.ece "Ceviche: the new sushi,"] The Times.</ref>

== Protein denaturation ==
Denatured proteins can exhibit a wide range of characteristics, from loss of [[solubility]] to [[communal aggregation]]. Communal aggregation is the phenomenon of aggregation of the hydrophobic proteins to come closer and form the bonding between them, so as to reduce the total area exposed to water.

=== Background ===
[[Protein]]s are [[amino acid]] polymers. A protein is created by [[ribosome]]s that "read" RNA that is encoded by [[codon]]s in the gene and assemble the requisite amino acid combination from the [[DNA|genetic]] instruction, in a process known as [[translation (genetics)|translation]]. The newly created protein strand then undergoes [[posttranslational modification]], in which additional [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s are added, for example [[copper]], [[zinc]], or [[iron]]. Once this post-translational modification process has been completed, the protein begins to fold (sometimes spontaneously and sometimes with [[enzymatic]] assistance), curling up on itself so that [[hydrophobic]] elements of the protein are buried deep inside the structure and [[hydrophilic]] elements end up on the outside. The final shape of a protein determines how it interacts with its environment.

When a protein is denatured, secondary and tertiary structures are altered but the [[peptide bond]]s of the primary structure between the amino acids are left intact. Since all structural levels of the protein determines its function, the protein can no longer perform its function once it has been denatured. This is in contrast to [[intrinsically unstructured proteins]], which are unfolded in their [[native state]], but still functionally active.

=== How denaturation occurs at levels of protein structure ===
{{See also|Protein structure}}

* In '''quaternary structure''' denaturation, protein sub-units are dissociated and/or the spatial arrangement of protein subunits is disrupted.
* '''Tertiary structure''' denaturation involves the disruption of:
** [[Covalent]] interactions between amino acid [[side-chain]]s (such as [[disulfide bridge]]s between [[cysteine]] groups)
** Noncovalent [[dipole]]-dipole interactions between polar amino acid side-chains (and the surrounding [[solvent]])
** [[van der Waals force|Van der Waals (induced dipole) interactions]] between nonpolar amino acid side-chains.
* In '''secondary structure''' denaturation, proteins lose all regular repeating patterns such as [[alpha helix|alpha-helices]] and [[beta sheet|beta-pleated sheets]], and adopt a [[random coil]] configuration.
* '''[[Protein primary structure|Primary structure]]''', such as the sequence of amino acids held together by covalent peptide bonds, is not disrupted by denaturation.<ref>{{citation |author=Charles Tanford |year=1968 |title=Protein denaturation |journal=Advances in Protein Chemistry |volume=23 |pages=121–282 |doi=10.1016/S0065-3233(08)60401-5 |pmid=4882248 |url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1980/A1980JC93500001.pdf}}</ref>

==== Loss of function ====
Most biological substrates lose their biological function when denatured. For example, [[enzyme]]s lose their [[catalysis|activity]], because the substrates can no longer bind to the [[active site]], and because amino acid residues involved in stabilizing substrates' [[transition state]]s are no longer positioned to be able to do so. The denaturing process and the associated loss of activity can be measured using techniques such as [[dual polarization interferometry]], [[Circular dichroism|CD]], and QCMD.

==== Reversibility and irreversibility ====
In very few cases (unlike egg whites), denaturation is reversible (the proteins can regain their native state when the denaturing influence is removed). This process can be called renaturation.<ref>{{citation |author=Campbell, N. A., Reece, J.B., Meyers, N., Urry, L. A., Cain, M.L., Wasserman, S.A., Minorsky, P.V., Jackson, R.B. |year=2009 |title=Biology |edition=8th, Australian version |place=Sydney |publisher=Pearson Education Australia}}</ref> This understanding has led to the notion that all the information needed for proteins to assume their native state was encoded in the primary structure of the protein, and hence in the [[DNA]] that codes for the protein, the so-called "[[Christian B. Anfinsen|Anfinsen's]] [[Anfinsen's dogma|thermodynamic hypothesis]]".<ref>{{citation |author=Anfinsen CB. |year=1973 |title=Principles that govern the folding of protein chains |journal=Science |volume=181 |issue=4096 |pages=223–30 |doi=10.1126/science.181.4096.223 |pmid=4124164}}</ref>

== Nucleic acid denaturation ==
{{main|Nucleic acid thermodynamics}}

The denaturation of [[nucleic acid]]s such as [[DNA]] due to high temperatures is the separation of a double strand into two single strands, which occurs when the [[hydrogen bond]]s between the strands are broken. This may occur during [[polymerase chain reaction]]. Nucleic acid strands realign when "normal" conditions are restored during [[annealing (biology)|annealing]]. If the conditions are restored too quickly, the nucleic acid strands may realign imperfectly.
