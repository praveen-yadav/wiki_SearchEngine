==Origin and medieval usage==
{{anchor|Etymology}}
The word is from [[Anglo-Norman]] ''bacheler'' (later [[suffix]]al change to ''bachelier''; cf. ''escolier'' "student", from earlier ''escoler''), a young [[squire]] in training. The ultimate source of the word is uncertain, it may be from [[Medieval Latin]] ''baccalari(u)s'' "vassal farmer" or "farm hand" (cf. [[Occitan language|Provençal]] ''bacalar'', Tuscan ''bacalaro'' "squire"), i.e. one who tends a ''baccalaria'', a term for a grazing farm (from ''bacca'' "[[cow]]"),<ref>Middle Latin meanings:  [[Du Cange]] (1733),  [http://books.google.ch/books?id=no9IWJhHTxIC&pg=PA153-IA67#v=onepage&q&f=false 906-912].
</ref> or it may be from Latin ''baculum'' "a stick" (as the knight-in-training would practice with a wooden club before receiving his sword).<ref>etymological discussion, with references:
Uwe Friedrich Schmidt, ''Praeromanica Der Italoromania Auf Der Grundlage Des LEI (A und B)'', Europäische Hochschulschriften 49, 9:  Italienische Sprache und Literatur, Peter Lang, 2009, [http://books.google.ch/books?id=6OPrKYUOFvgC&pg=PA117 117-120].</ref>

The Old French term crossed into English around 1300, referring to one belonging to the lowest stage of [[knighthood]]. [[Knights bachelor]] were either poor vassals who could not afford to take the field under their own banner, or knights too young to support the responsibility and dignity of [[knights banneret]].

From the 14th century, the term was also used for a junior member of a [[guild]] (otherwise known as "yeomen") or [[university]]; hence, an ecclesiastic of an inferior grade, for example, a young [[monk]] or even recently appointed [[Canon (priest)|canon]];<ref>Severtius, de episcopis Lugdunen-sibus, p.&nbsp;377, in [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|du Cange]].</ref> and also an inferior grade in [[scholarship]], i.e. one holding a "[[bachelor's degree]]" In this sense the word ''baccalarius'' or ''baccalaureus'' first appears at the [[University of Paris]] in the 13th century, in the system of degrees established under the auspices of [[Pope Gregory IX]], as applied to scholars still in ''statu pupillari''. 
Thus there were two classes of baccalarii: the ''baccalarii cursores'', theological candidates passed for admission to the divinity course; and the ''baccalarii dispositi'', who, having completed this course, were entitled to proceed to the higher degrees.

==Use for "unmarried man" in the 19th and 20th centuries==

{{mergefrom|Eligible bachelor|date=April 2013}}

In the [[Victorian era]], the term [[eligible bachelor]] was used in the context of [[upper class]] [[arranged marriage|matchmaking]], denoting a young man who was not only unmarried and eligible for marriage, but also considered "eligible" in financial and societal terms for the prospective bride under discussion. 
Also in the Victorian era, the term "confirmed bachelor", denoted man who was resolute to remain unmarried.

By the later 19th century, the term "bachelor" had acquired the general sense of "unmarried man". The expression [[bachelor party]] is recorded 1882. In 1895, a feminine equivalent "bachelor-girl" was coined, replaced in US English by the somewhat humorous "[[bachelorette]]" by the mid-1930s.
After [[World War II]], this terminology came to be seen as antiquated, and has been mostly replaced by the gender-neutral term "[[single person|single]]" (first recorded 1964).
In England and Wales, the term "bachelor" remained the official term used for the purpose of marriage registration until 2005, when it was abolished in favour of "single."<ref>{{cite news|title=R.I.P Bachelors and Spinsters|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4141996.stm|accessdate=8 April 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=14 September 2005}}</ref>

In certain [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Arab]] countries, "bachelor" can refer to men who are single as well as immigrant men married to a spouse residing in their country of origin (due to the high added cost of sponsoring a spouse onsite),<ref>http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/hundreds-of-bachelors-crammed-in-squalid-and-dilapidated-buildings-1.194725</ref> and a colloquial term "executive bachelor" is also used in rental and sharing accommodation advertisements to indicate availability to [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] bachelors in particular.<ref>http://www.google.com/search?q=executive-bachelor</ref>
