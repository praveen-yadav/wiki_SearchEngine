'''Çatalhöyük''' ({{IPA-tr|tʃaˈtaɫhøjyc}}; also ''Çatal Höyük'' and ''Çatal Hüyük''; ''çatal'' is [[Turkish language|Turkish]] for "fork", ''höyük'' for "mound") was a very large [[Neolithic]] and [[Chalcolithic]] [[proto-city]] settlement in southern [[Anatolia]], which existed from approximately 7500 BC to 5700 BC, and flourished around 7000BC.<ref name=Langer>{{cite book|title=An Encyclopedia of World History| editor-last = Langer | editor-first = William L. |edition = 5th | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company| location = Boston, MA| year = 1972 | isbn = 0-395-13592-3|pages = 9}}</ref> It is the largest and best-preserved Neolithic site found to date. In July 2012, it was inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>http://globalheritagefund.org/onthewire/blog/catalhoyuk_world_heritage_list Çatalhöyük added to UNESCO World Heritage List Global Heritage Fund blog article</ref>

Çatalhöyük is located overlooking the Konya Plain, southeast of the present-day city of [[Konya]] (ancient Iconium) in [[Turkey]], approximately 140&nbsp;km (87&nbsp;mi) from the twin-coned volcano of [[Mount Hasan]]. The eastern settlement forms a mound which would have risen about 20&nbsp;m (66&nbsp;ft) above the plain at the time of the latest Neolithic occupation. There is also a smaller settlement mound to the west and a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] settlement a few hundred meters to the east. The prehistoric mound settlements were abandoned before the [[Bronze Age]]. A channel of the [[Çarşamba]] river once flowed between the two mounds, and the settlement was built on alluvial clay which may have been favourable for early [[agriculture]].

==Archaeology==
The site was first excavated by [[James Mellaart]] in 1958. He later led a team which excavated there for four seasons between 1961 and 1965.<ref>J. Mellaart, Excavations at Çatal Hüyük, first preliminary report: 1961. Anatolian Studies, vol. 12, pp. 41-65, 1962</ref><ref>J. Mellaart, Excavations at Çatal Hüyük, second preliminary report: 1962.

Anatolian Studies, vol. 16, pp. 15-191, 1966</ref> These excavations revealed this section of [[Anatolia]] as a centre of advanced culture in the [[Neolithic]] period.<ref name=gard>{{cite book | first = Fred S. | last = Kleiner | coauthors = Mamiya, Christin J. | year = 2006 | title = Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective: Volume 1 | edition = Twelfth | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | location = Belmont, California | isbn = 0-495-00479-0 | pages = 12–4}}</ref>
Mellaart was banned from Turkey for his involvement in the [[James Mellaart#Dorak Affair|Dorak affair]] in which he published drawings of supposedly important Bronze Age artifacts that later went missing.<ref>Kenneth Pearson and Patricia Connor, The Dorak affair, New York, Atheneum, 1968</ref>

After this scandal, the site lay idle until 1993, when investigations began under the leadership of [[Ian Hodder]] then at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>I. Hodder, Çatalhöyük, Anatolian Archaeology, vol. 4, pp. 8-10, 1998</ref><ref>I. Hodder, Getting to the Bottom of Thing: Çatalhöyük 1999, Anatolian Archaeology, vol. 5, pp. 4-7, 1999</ref><ref>I.

Hodder, A New Phase of Excavation at Çatalhöyük, Anatolian Archaeology, vol. 9, pp. 9-11, 2003</ref> These investigations are among the most ambitious excavation projects currently in progress according to, among others, [[Colin Renfrew]]. In addition to extensive use of [[archaeological science]], psychological and artistic interpretations of the [[symbol]]ism of the [[Wall painting in Turkey|wall paintings]] have been employed. Hodder, a former student of Mellaart, chose the site as the first "real world" test of his then-controversial theory of [[post-processual archaeology]].

As of 2012 Ashley Morgan Lingle is leading an international team of conservators coming from [[Cardiff University]] and [[University College London]].<ref>[http://www.catalhoyuk.com/team/ Field team (catalhoyuk.com)]</ref>

[[File:Catal Hüyük Restoration B.jpg|left|thumb|200px|On-site restoration of a typical interior]]
<!--DO NOT try to correct the name of this picture to "CatalHüyük Restauration B.JPG", it will just mess it up.  Thank you.-->Çatalhöyük was composed entirely of domestic buildings, with no obvious public buildings. While some of the larger ones have rather ornate [[murals]], these rooms' purpose remains unclear.<ref name=gard/>

The population of the eastern mound has been estimated at up to 10,000 people, but population likely varied over the community’s history. An average population of between 5,000 to 8,000 is a reasonable estimate. The inhabitants lived in mud-brick houses that were crammed together in an agglutinative manner. No footpaths or streets were used between the dwellings, which were clustered in a honeycomb-like maze. Most were accessed by holes in the ceiling, with doors reached by ladders and stairs. The rooftops were effectively streets. The ceiling openings also served as the only source of ventilation, allowing smoke from the houses' open hearths and ovens to escape. 
{{Neolithic}}
Houses had [[plaster]] interiors characterized by squared-off timber ladders or steep stairs.  These were usually on the south wall of the room, as were [[cooking hearth]]s and [[oven]]s. Each main room served for cooking and daily activities. The main rooms contained raised platforms that may have been used for a range of domestic activities. All interior walls and platforms were plastered to a smooth finish.<ref name=gard/> Ancillary rooms were used as storage, and were accessed through low openings from main rooms.

All rooms were kept scrupulously clean. Archaeologists identified very little rubbish in the buildings, finding middens outside the ruins, with sewage and food waste, as well as significant amounts of wood ash. In good weather, many daily activities may also have taken place on the rooftops, which may have formed a plaza. In later periods, large communal ovens appear to have been built on these rooftops. Over time, houses were renewed by partial demolition and rebuilding on a foundation of rubble, which was how the mound was gradually built up. As many as eighteen levels of settlement have been uncovered.

The people of Çatalhöyük buried their dead within the village. Human remains have been found in pits beneath the floors and, especially, beneath hearths, the platforms within the main rooms, and under beds. Bodies were tightly flexed before burial and were often placed in [[baskets]] or wrapped in reed mats. Disarticulated bones in some graves suggest that bodies may have been exposed in the open air for a time before the bones were gathered and buried. In some cases, graves were disturbed and the individual’s head removed from the skeleton. These heads may have been used in rituals, as some were found in other areas of the community. Some [[Plastered human skulls|skulls were plastered]] and painted with [[ochre]] to recreate faces, a custom more characteristic of Neolithic sites in Syria and at Neolithic [[Jericho]] than at sites closer by.

Vivid [[murals]] and [[figurine]]s are found throughout the settlement, on interior and exterior walls. Distinctive [[clay]] figurines of women, notably the [[Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük]] have been found in the upper levels of the site. Although no identifiable temples have been found, the graves, murals, and figurines suggest that the people of Çatalhöyük had a religion rich in symbols. Rooms with concentrations of these items may have been [[shrines]] or public meeting areas. Predominant images include men with erect phalluses, hunting scenes, red images of the now extinct [[aurochs]] (wild cattle) and [[stags]], and [[vultures]] swooping down on headless figures.<ref name=gard/> [[Relief]] figures are carved on walls, such as of [[lion]]esses facing one another.

Heads of animals, especially of cattle, were mounted on walls. A painting of the village, with the twin mountain peaks of [[Mount Hasan|Hasan Dağ]] in the background,<ref>{{cite web

Çatalhöyük had no apparent social classes, as no houses with distinctive features (belonging to [[Monarch|royalty]] or [[priest|religious hierarchy]], for example) have been found so far.  The most recent investigations also reveal little [[social stratification|social distinction]] based on gender, with men and women receiving equivalent nutrition and seeming to have equal social status, as typically found in [[Paleolithic]] cultures.<ref name="Stavrianos">{{cite book | author=Leften Stavros Stavrianos|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MKhe6qNva10C&q=paleolithic+society&dq=paleolithic+society | title=A Global History from Prehistory to the Present| location=New Jersey, USA | publisher=Prentice Hall| year=1991 | isbn=0-13-357005-3}} [http://books.google.com/books?id=MKhe6qNva10C&q=paleolithic+society&dq=paleolithic+society&pgis=1 Pages 9-13]</ref><ref name="Gutrie">{{cite book | author=R Dale Gutrie|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3u6JNwMyMCEC&printsec=frontcover#PPA420,M1 | title=The Nature of Paleolithic art| location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=2005 | isbn=0-226-31126-0}} [http://books.google.com/books?id=3u6JNwMyMCEC&printsec=frontcover#PPA420,M1 Page 420-422]</ref><ref name=MuseumofAntiquites>[http://museums.ncl.ac.uk/flint/miscon.html Museum of Antiquites web site] (accessed February 13, 2008).</ref>

In upper levels of the site, it becomes apparent that the people of Çatalhöyük were gaining skills in [[agriculture]] and the domestication of animals. Female figurines have been found within bins used for storage of [[cereal]]s, such as [[wheat]] and [[barley]], the figurines presumed to be of a deity protecting the grain. [[Peas]] were also grown, and [[almonds]], [[pistachio]]s, and fruit were harvested from trees in the surrounding hills. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] were domesticated and evidence suggests the beginning of [[cattle]] [[domestication]] as well.  However, [[hunting]] continued to be a major source of food for the community.  [[Pottery]] and [[obsidian]] [[tools]] appear to have been major industries; [[obsidian]] tools were probably both used and also traded for items such as [[Mediterranean]] [[sea]] [[animal shell|shells]] and [[flint]] from [[Syria]].

[[File:Ankara Muzeum B19-36.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük|Seated goddess]] on a throne flanked by two [[felines]]]]
A striking feature of Çatalhöyük are its female figurines.  Mellaart, the original excavator, argued that these well-formed, carefully made figurines, carved and molded from marble, blue and brown limestone, schist, calcite, basalt, alabaster, and clay, represented a [[female deity]]. Although a male deity existed as well, “…statues of a female [[deity]] far outnumber those of the male deity, who moreover, does not appear to be represented at all after Level&nbsp;VI”.<ref name=mellart181>{{cite book | first = James | last = Mellaart |year = 1967 | title = Catal Huyuk: A Neolithic Town in Anatolia | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | pages = 181}}</ref> To date, eighteen levels have been identified. These careful figurines were found primarily in areas Mellaart believed to be shrines. The stately goddess seated on a [[throne]] flanked by two female lions (''illustration'') was found in a grain bin, which Mellaart suggests might have been a means of ensuring the harvest or protecting the food supply.<ref name=mellart180>Mellaart (1967), 180.</ref>

Whereas Mellaart excavated nearly two hundred buildings in four seasons, the current excavator, Ian Hodder, spent an entire season excavating one building alone.<ref name=balter127>{{cite book | first = Michael | last = Balter | title = The Goddess and the Bull | year = 2005 | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-7432-4360-9 | pages = 127}}</ref>  Hodder and his team, in 2004 and 2005, began to believe that the patterns suggested by Mellaart were false.  They found one similar figurine, but the vast majority did not imitate the [[Mother Goddess]] style that Mellaart suggested. Instead of a Mother Goddess culture,  Hodder points out that the site gives little indication of a matriarchy or patriarchy.

{{quote|There are full breasts on which the hands rest, and the stomach is extended in the central part. There is a hole in the top for the head which is missing. As one turns the figurine around one notices that the arms are very thin, and then on the back of the figurine one sees a depiction of either a skeleton or the bones of a very thin and depleted human. The ribs and vertebrae are clear, as are the scapulae and the main pelvic bones. The figurine can be interpreted in a number of ways - as a woman turning into an ancestor, as a woman associated with death, or as death and life conjoined. It is possible that the lines around the body represent wrapping rather than ribs. Whatever the specific interpretation, this is a unique piece that may force us to change our views of the nature of Çatalhöyük society and imagery. Perhaps the importance of female imagery was related to some special role of the female in relation to death as much as to the roles of mother and nurturer<ref name=hodder>{{cite web | last = Hodder | first = Ian | title = New finds and new interpretations at Çatalhöyük | work = Çatalhöyük 2005 Archive Report | publisher = Catalhoyuk Research Project, Institute of Archaeology | year = 2005 | url = http://www.catalhoyuk.com/archive_reports/2005/ar05_01.html}}</ref>}}

In an article in the ''Turkish Daily News'', Hodder is reported as denying that Çatalhöyük was a matriarchal society and quoted as saying "When we look at what they eat and drink and at their social statues, we see that men and women had the same social status. There was a balance of power. Another example is the skulls found. If one's social status was of high importance in Çatalhöyük, the body and head were separated after death. The number of female and male skulls found during the excavations is almost equal."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=93856 | title = A Journey to 9000 years ago | date = 2008-01-17 | accessdate = 2008-08-07 | last = Hodder | first = Ian }}</ref>

In a report in September 2009 on the discovery of around 2000 figurines Hodder is quoted as saying:
<blockquote>“Çatalhöyük was excavated in the 1960s in a methodical way, but not using the full range of natural science techniques that are available to us today. Sir James Mellaart who excavated the site in the 1960s came up with all sorts of ideas about the way the site was organised and how it was lived in and so on,” he said. “We’ve now started working there since the mid 1990s and come up with very different ideas about the site. One of the most obvious examples of that is that Çatalhöyük is perhaps best known for the idea of the mother [[goddess]]. But our work more recently has tended to show that in fact there is very little evidence of a mother goddess and very little evidence of some sort of female-based matriarchy. That’s just one of the many myths that the modern scientific work is undermining.”<ref name="O'Brien">O'Brien, Jeremy "New techniques undermine 'mother goddess' role in the community" ''Irish Times'' September 20, 2009 [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0910/1224254196976.html]</ref></blockquote>

Professor Lynn Meskell explained that while the original excavations had found only 200 figures, the new excavations had uncovered 2000 figurines of which most were animals, with less than 5% of the figurines women.<ref name="O'Brien" />

Estonian folklorist [[Uku Masing]] has suggested as early as in 1976, that Çatalhöyük was probably a hunting and gathering religion and the Mother Goddess figurine didn't represent a female deity. He implied that perhaps a longer period of time was needed in order to develop symbols for agricultural rites.<ref name=Masing>{{cite book | first = Uku | last = Masing | year = 2011 | title = Aarded Tellistes | publisher = Ilmamaa | location = Tartu, Estonia | isbn = 978-9985-77-351-2 | pages = 209–227}}</ref> His theory was developed in the paper "Some remarks on the mythology of the people of Catal Hüyük".<ref>Oriental Studies 3.
