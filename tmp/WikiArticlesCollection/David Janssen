'''David Janssen''' (March 27, 1931 – February 13, 1980) was an American film and television actor who is best known for his starring role as Dr. [[Richard Kimble]] in the television series ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' (1963–1967). Janssen also had the title roles in three other series, ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective]]'', ''[[Harry O]]'' and ''[[O'Hara, U.S. Treasury]]''.

In 1996 ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked him number 36 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list.<ref>{{cite book|title=TV Guide Guide to TV|year=2004|publisher=Barnes and Noble|isbn=0-7607-5634-1|pages=596}}</ref>

==Early life==
Janssen was born as '''David Harold Meyer''' in [[Naponee, Nebraska|Naponee]], a village in [[Franklin County, Nebraska|Franklin County]] in southern [[Nebraska]], to Harold Edward Meyer, a banker (May 12, 1906&nbsp;– November 4, 1990) and Berniece Graf (May 11, 1910&nbsp;– November 26, 1995). Following his parents' divorce in 1935, his mother moved with five-year-old David to Los Angeles, California, and later married Eugene Janssen (February 18, 1918&nbsp;– March 30, 1996) in 1940 in Los Angeles. Young David used his stepfather's name after he entered show business as a child.

While Janssen's birth father was Jewish, he was reared in the Lutheran faith of his mother, states biographer Michael Phelps.<ref>[http://davidjanssen.yuku.com/reply/140/Paying-My-Respects-Graveside#reply-140 ''David Janssen – My Fugitive'']</ref><ref>[http://www.michaelphelpsnovels.com/david-janssen-books/ Michael Phelps website]</ref> He attended [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]] in Los Angeles. His first film part was at the age of thirteen, and by the age of twenty-five he had appeared in twenty films and served two years as an enlisted man in the [[United States Army]]. During his Army days, Janssen became friends with fellow enlistees [[Martin Milner]] and [[Clint Eastwood]] while posted at [[Fort Ord]], California.

==Acting career==
[[File:David Janssen Fugitive 1967.JPG|thumb|in TV series ''The Fugitive'', 1963–1967 (final episode)]]
Janssen appeared in many television series before he landed programs of his own. In 1956, he and [[Peter Breck]] appeared in [[John Bromfield]]'s [[Television syndication|syndicated]] series ''[[Sheriff of Cochise]]'' in the episode "The Turkey Farmers". Later, he guest starred on [[NBC]]'s [[medical drama]] ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'' in the role of Hal Kincaid in the 1962 episode "Make Me a Place", with series co-stars [[Wendell Corey]] and [[Jack Ging]]. He joined friend Martin Milner in a 1962 episode of ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'' as the character Kamo in the episode "One Tiger to a Hill."

Janssen starred in four television series of his own:
* ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective]]'' (1957–1960), a series that also introduced [[Mary Tyler Moore]], showing only her legs, and [[Barbara Bain]] as Diamond's girlfriend.
* ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' (1963–67), the hit [[Quinn Martin]]-produced series, about a Midwest doctor falsely convicted of murdering his wife;
* ''[[O'Hara, U.S. Treasury]]'' (1971–1972), as a government agent investigating counterfeiters and other federal crimes;
* ''[[Harry O (TV series)|Harry O]]'' (1974–1976), as a San Diego-based private eye.

At the time, the final episode of ''The Fugitive'' held the record for the greatest number of American homes with television sets to watch a series finale, at 72 percent in August 1967.

His films include ''[[To Hell and Back (film)|To Hell and Back]]'', the biography of [[Audie Murphy]], who is considered the most decorated soldier in the military history of the United States; [[John Wayne]]'s Vietnam war film ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]''; opposite [[Gregory Peck]] in the space story ''[[Marooned (film)|Marooned]]'', in which Janssen played an astronaut sent to rescue three stranded men in space, and ''[[The Shoes of the Fisherman]]'', as a television journalist in Rome reporting on the election of a new Pope ([[Anthony Quinn]]).

He starred as a Los Angeles police detective trying to clear himself in the killing of an apparently innocent doctor in the 1968 film ''[[Warning Shot]]''.

Janssen played an alcoholic in the 1977 TV movie ''A Sensitive, Passionate Man'', which co-starred [[Angie Dickinson]] and an engineer who devises an unbeatable system for [[blackjack]] in the 1978 made-for-TV movie ''Nowhere to Run'', co-starring [[Stefanie Powers]] and [[Linda Evans]]. Janssen's impressively husky voice was used to good effect as the narrator for the TV mini-series ''Centennial'' (1978–79); he also appeared in the final episode.

Though Janssen's scenes were cut from the final release, he also appeared as a journalist in the film ''[[Inchon (film)|Inchon]]'', which he accepted to work with [[Laurence Olivier]] who played General [[Douglas MacArthur]].<ref>{{cite news   |date=  | url =http://www.davidjanssen.net/chron17.htm  | accessdate =  June 30, 2012}}</ref>

At the time of his death, Janssen had just begun filming a television movie playing the part of [[Father Damien]], the priest who dedicated himself to the [[leprosy|leper]] colony on the island of [[Molokai]], Hawaii. The part was eventually reassigned to actor [[Ken Howard]] of the CBS series ''[[The White Shadow]]''.

==Personal life==
[[File:David Janssen 1974.JPG|thumb|In 1974]]
He was married twice. His first marriage was to Ellie Graham on August 23, 1958 in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. They divorced on August 25, 1970. From October 4, 1975 until his death, he was married to sometime actress and model Dani Crayne Greco.<ref>Dani Greco was born Darlyne Danielle Swanson, December 25, 1934 in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. She was previously married to singer [[Buddy Greco]] from whom she was divorced in April 1974.</ref>

==Death==
Janssen died of a heart attack on the morning of February 13, 1980, at his home in [[Malibu, California]], two days into the filming of ''Father Damien''. Two days earlier, he told his wife, Dani, that he had a bad dream that he was being carried in a coffin following a heart attack.<ref>[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]] 2010</ref> He is interred at the [[Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].
