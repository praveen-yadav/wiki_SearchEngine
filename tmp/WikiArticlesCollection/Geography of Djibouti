'''[[Djibouti]]''' is a country in the [[Horn of Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Eritrea]] in the north, [[Ethiopia]] in the west and south, and [[Somalia]] in the southeast. To the east is its coastline on the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Aden]]. Rainfall is sparse, and most of the territory has a semi-arid or arid environment. Djibouti's major settlements include the capital [[Djibouti City]], the port towns of [[Tadjoura]] and [[Obock]], and the southern cities of [[Ali Sabieh]] and [[Dikhil]]. It is the 150th largest country in the world by land area, covering a total of 23,200 km<sup>2</sup>, of which 23,180 km<sup>2</sup> is land and 20 km<sup>2</sup> is water.<ref name="Cwfbdj">{{cite web|title=Djibouti|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/dj.html|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=February 26, 2013|date=February 5, 2013}}</ref>

==Location==
Djibouti shares {{Convert|113|km|mi}} of border with Eritrea, {{Convert|337|km|mi}} with Ethiopia, and {{Convert|58|km|mi}} with Somalia (total {{Convert|506|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}}). It has a strategic location on the [[Horn of Africa]] and the [[Bab el Mandeb]], along a route through the [[Red Sea]] and [[Suez Canal]]. Djibouti's coastline serves as a commercial gateway between the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the Horn region's interior. The country is also the terminus of [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|rail traffic into Ethiopia]].

==Physiographic regions==
Djibouti can be divided into three [[Physiographic regions of the world|physiographic regions]]
#The Northern Mountains
#Danakil Depression
#Grand Bara

=== Mountains===
A great arc of mountains, consisting of the [[Mousa Ali]], [[Goda Mountains]], and [[Arrei Mountains]] surrounds [[Djibouti]].

Djibouti has eight mountain ranges with peaks of over 1,000 m (3,281&nbsp;ft).<ref name="Hmid">[http://www.geonames.org/DJ/highest-mountains-in-djibouti.html Highest Mountains in Djibouti]</ref>

* The [[Mousa Ali]] range is considered the country's highest mountain range, with the tallest peak on the border with [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]]. It has an elevation of 2,028 m.<ref name="Hmid"/>

* The [[Goda Mountains]] lie northwest of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] in [[Tadjoura Region]]. They rise to 1,750 m (5,740&nbsp;ft) above sea level and are the nation's largest heavily vegetated area.

* [[Garbi (mountain)|Garbi]] is a mountain in the west of Tadjourah Region. It has an elevation of 1680 metres (5,512&nbsp;ft).

* The [[Arrei Mountains]] are in the southern [[Ali Sabieh Region]]. The mountain range has an elevation of 1,301 metres (4,268&nbsp;ft) above sea level, and is situated near the border with Ethiopia.

* The [[Mabla Mountains]] are located in [[Obock Region]]. At 1780&nbsp;m (5850&nbsp;ft) above sea level, the mountains are situated behind the coastal plain where the Red Sea meets the Gulf of Aden, on the northern side of the Gulf of Tadjoura.

* The [[Dagouein Mountain]] sit at an elevation of 1,124 m (3,688&nbsp;ft) above sea level.

* Hemed is a mountain in the western part of the [[Arta Region]] in south-central Djibouti. The summit is 1,103 metres (3,619&nbsp;ft) above sea level.

* The [[Boura Mountains]]' highest peak has an elevation of 1037 m (3,402&nbsp;ft. The ecology of this landform is [[semi-desert]]. The altitude and size of the range affects its weather, with precipitation levels varying greatly and climatic conditions consisting of distinct zones.

===Grand Bara===
The [[Grand Bara]] Desert covers parts of South Djibouti in [[Arta Region]], Ali Sabieh Region and [[Dikhil Region]]. The majority of the Grand Bara Desert lies at a relatively low elevation, below 1,700 feet (560 m).

===Coasts===
Most of Djibouti has been described as part of the [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] [[ecoregion]]. The exception is a strip along the [[Red Sea]] coast, which is part of the [[Eritrean coastal desert]]; it is noted as an important migration route for birds of prey.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|name=Eritrean coastal desert|id=at1304}}</ref>

==Climate==
[[File:Djibouti Topography.png|right|thumb|right|190px|Topography of Djibouti]]
There is not much seasonal variation in Djibouti's [[climate]]. Hot conditions prevail year-round along with winter rainfall. Mean daily maximum temperatures range from 32 to 41 °C (90 to 106 °F), except at high elevations. In [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti city]], for instance, afternoon highs in April typically range from 28 °C (82 °F) to 34 °C (93 °F) in April. Nationally, mean daily minima generally vary between sites from about 15 to 30 °C (59 to 86 °F). The greatest range in climate occurs in eastern Djibouti, where temperatures sometimes surpass 41 °C (106 °F) in July on the littoral plains and fall below freezing point during December in the highlands. In this region, relative humidity ranges from about 40% in the mid-afternoon to 85% at night, changing somewhat according to the season.

Djibouti's climate ranges from arid in the northeastern coastal regions to [[semiarid]] in the central, northern, western and southern parts of the country. On the eastern seaboard, annual rainfall is less than 5 inches (131&nbsp;mm); in the central highlands, it is about 8 to 11 inches (200 to 300&nbsp;mm). Although the coastal regions are hot and humid throughout the year, the hinterland is typically hot and dry. The climate conditions are highly variable within the country and vary locally by altitude. Summers are very humid along the coast but dry in the [[highland]]s. Heat waves are frequent. Annual precipitation amounts vary greatly from one year to another. In general, rain falls more frequently and extensively in the mountains. Sudden and brutal storms are also known to occur. Wadis turn for a few hours into raging torrents tearing everything in their path, and their course is regularized{{clarify|date=September 2013}}. Rainwater serves as an additional water supply for livestock and plants alongside seasonal watercourses.

==Environment==
[[File:Camelsdjibouti.jpg|lift|thumb|Grazing [[camel]]s]]
Natural hazards include earthquakes, drought, and occasional [[cyclone|cyclonic disturbances]] from the [[Indian Ocean]], which bring heavy rains and flash floods. [[Natural resource]]s include [[geothermal energy]]. Inadequate supplies of [[potable water]] and [[desertification]] are current issues.

Djibouti is a party to international agreements on biodiversity, climate change, desertification, endangered species, [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], ozone layer protection, and ship pollution.
