'''Chamaeleon''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|m|iː|l|i|ən}}) is a small [[constellation]] in the southern sky. It is named after the [[chameleon]], a kind of [[lizard]]. It was first defined in the 16th century.

==History==
Chamaeleon was one of twelve constellations created by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=116-117}} It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in [[Amsterdam]] by Plancius and [[Jodocus Hondius]].<!-- The preceding is not covered by Staal (1988) --> [[Johann Bayer]] was the first [[uranography|uranographer]] to put Chamaeleon in a celestial atlas. It was one of many constellations created by European explorers in the 15th and 16th centuries out of unfamiliar Southern Hemisphere stars.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=260}}

=== Stars ===
{{see also|List of stars in Chamaeleon}}

There are four bright stars in Chamaeleon. [[Alpha Chamaeleontis]] is a white-hued star of magnitude 4.1, 63 light-years from Earth. [[Beta Chamaeleontis]] is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 4.2, 27 light-years from Earth. [[Gamma Chamaeleontis]] is a red-hued giant star of magnitude 4.1, 413 light-years from Earth. The other bright star in Chamaeleon is [[Delta Chamaeleontis]], a wide [[double star]]. The brighter star is [[Delta2 Chamaeleontis|Delta<sup>2</sup> Chamaeleontis]], a blue-hued star of magnitude 4.4, 364 light-years from Earth. [[Delta1 Chamaeleontis|Delta<sup>1</sup> Chamaeleontis]], the dimmer component, is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 5.5, 354 light-years away.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=116-117}}

Chamaeleon is also the location of [[Cha 110913]], a unique dwarf star or proto solar system.

=== Deep-sky objects ===
In 1999, a nearby [[open cluster]] was discovered centered on the star [[Eta Chamaeleontis|η Chamaeleontis]]. The cluster, known as either
the [[Eta Chamaeleontis cluster]] or Mamajek 1, is 8 million years old, and lies 316 [[light years]] from Earth.<ref>Luhman, K.L. & Steeghs, D. 2004, ApJ, 609, 917</ref>

The constellation contains a number of [[molecular clouds]] (the [[Chamaeleon complex|Chamaeleon dark clouds]]) that are forming low-mass [[T Tauri star]]s. The cloud complex lies some 400 to 600 [[light years]] from Earth, and contains tens of thousands of solar masses of gas and dust. The most prominent cluster of T Tauri stars and young B-type stars are in the Chamaeleon I cloud, and are associated with the reflection nebula [[IC 2631]].

Chamaeleon contains one planetary nebula, [[NGC 3195]], which is fairly faint. It appears in a telescope at about the same apparent size as [[Jupiter]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=116-117}}

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars that form Chamaeleon were classified as the [[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|Little Dipper]] (小斗, ''Xiǎodǒu'') among the [[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|Southern Asterisms]] (近南極星區, ''Jìnnánjíxīngōu'') by [[Xu Guangqi]].<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060728.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 28 日]</ref>
