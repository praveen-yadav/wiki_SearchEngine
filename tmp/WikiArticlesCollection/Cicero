'''Marcus Tullius Cicero''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|s|ɨ|r|oʊ}}; {{IPA-la|markʊs tul.ljʊs ˈkɪkɛroː|classical}}; 3 January 106 BC &ndash; 7 December 43 BC; sometimes anglicized as '''Tully'''<ref>E.g. H.

Though he was an accomplished orator and successful lawyer, Cicero believed his political career was his most important achievement. It was during his consulship that the [[Second Catilinarian Conspiracy]] attempted the government overthrow through an attack on the city from outside forces, and Cicero suppressed the revolt by executing five conspirators without due process. During the chaotic latter half of the 1st century BC marked by [[Roman civil wars|civil wars]] and the dictatorship of [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], Cicero championed a return to the traditional [[Roman Republic|republican]] government. Following Julius Caesar's death Cicero became an enemy of [[Mark Antony]] in the ensuing power struggle, attacking him in a [[Philippicae|series of speeches]]. He was [[Proscription|proscribed]] as an enemy of the state by the [[Second Triumvirate]] and subsequently murdered in 43 BC.

==Personal life==
{{Main|Personal life of Marcus Tullius Cicero}}

===Early life===
Cicero was born in 106 BC in [[Arpinum]], a hill town {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} southeast of Rome. His father was a well-to-do member of the [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian order]] and possessed good connections in Rome.  However, being a semi-invalid, he could not enter public life and studied extensively to compensate. Although little is known about Cicero's mother, Helvia, it was common for the wives of important Roman citizens to be responsible for the management of the household. Cicero's brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus]] wrote in a letter that she was a thrifty housewife.<ref>Rawson, E.: ''Cicero, a portrait'' (1975) p.5–6; Cicero, ''Ad Familiares'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Fam.+16.26.2 16.26.2] (Quintus to Cicero)</ref>

Cicero's [[cognomen]], or personal surname, comes from the Latin for [[chickpea]], ''cicer''. [[Plutarch]] explains that the name was originally given to one of Cicero's ancestors who had a cleft in the tip of his nose resembling a chickpea. However, it is more likely that Cicero's ancestors prospered through the cultivation and sale of chickpeas.<ref>Trollope, Anthony. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/8945/8945-h/8945-h.htm The Life of Cicero]'' Volume 1. p. 42</ref> Romans often chose down-to-earth personal surnames: the famous family names of [[Fabius]], [[Lentulus]], and [[Piso]] come from the Latin names of beans, lentils, and peas. Plutarch writes that Cicero was urged to change this deprecatory name when he entered politics, but refused, saying that he would make ''Cicero'' more glorious than ''[[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Scaurus]]'' ("Swollen-ankled") and ''[[Gaius Lutatius Catulus|Catulus]]'' ("Puppy").<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#1.3 1.3–5]</ref>

[[File:The Young Cicero Reading.jpg|left|thumb|''The Young Cicero Reading'' by [[Vincenzo Foppa]] (fresco, 1464), now at the [[Wallace Collection]]]]

During this period in Roman history, to be considered "cultured" meant being able to speak both Latin and Greek. Cicero, like most of his contemporaries,{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} was therefore educated in the teachings of the ancient Greek philosophers, poets and historians. The most prominent teachers of oratory of that time were themselves Greek.<ref>Rawson, E.:"Cicero, a portrait" (1975) p.8</ref> {{Full|date=November 2012}}  Cicero used his knowledge of Greek to translate many of the theoretical concepts of Greek philosophy into Latin, thus translating Greek philosophical works for a larger audience. It was precisely his broad education that tied him to the traditional Roman elite.<ref>[[Anthony Everitt|Everitt, A.]]:"Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician" (2001) p.35</ref>

According to Plutarch, Cicero was an extremely talented student, whose learning attracted attention from all over Rome,<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#2.2 2.2]</ref> affording him the opportunity to study Roman law under [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur|Quintus Mucius Scaevola]].<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#3.2 3.2]</ref> Cicero's fellow students were Gaius Marius Minor, [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]] (who became a famous lawyer, one of the few whom Cicero considered superior to himself in legal matters), and [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Titus Pomponius]]. The latter two became Cicero's friends for life, and Pomponius (who later received the nickname "Atticus") would become Cicero's longtime chief emotional support and adviser.

Cicero wanted to pursue a public career in politics along the steps of the [[Cursus honorum]]. In 90 BC–88 BC, he served both [[Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] as they campaigned in the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]], though he had no taste for military life, being an intellectual first and foremost. Cicero started his career as a lawyer around 83–81 BC. His first major case, of which a written record is still extant, was his 80 BC defense of [[Sextus Roscius]] on the charge of [[patricide]].<ref>Rawson, E.: "Cicero, a portrait" (1975) p.22</ref> Taking this case was a courageous move for Cicero; patricide was considered an appalling crime, and the people whom Cicero accused of the murder, the most notorious being [[Lucius Cornelius Chrysogonus|Chrysogonus]], were favorites of Sulla. At this time it would have been easy for Sulla to have the unknown Cicero murdered. Cicero's defense was an indirect challenge to the dictator Sulla, and on the strength of his case, Roscius was acquitted.

In 79 BC, Cicero left for [[Greece]], [[Asia Minor]] and [[Rhodes]], perhaps because of the potential wrath of Sulla.<ref>Haskell, H.J.: "This was Cicero" (1940) p.83</ref> Cicero traveled to [[Athens]], where he again met [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]], who had become an honorary citizen of Athens{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} and introduced Cicero to some significant Athenians. In Athens, Cicero visited the sacred sites of the philosophers, but not before he consulted different [[rhetoric]]ians in order to learn a less physically exhausting style of speech.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} His chief instructor was the rhetorician [[Apollonius Molon|Apollonius Molon of Rhodes]]. He instructed Cicero in a more expansive and less intense form of oratory that would define Cicero's individual style in years to come.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Cicero's interest in philosophy figured heavily in his later career and led to him introducing Greek philosophy to Roman culture,<ref>De Officiis, book 1, n. 1</ref> {{Clarify|date=October 2011}} creating a philosophical vocabulary in Latin. In 87 BC, [[Philo of Larissa]], the head of the [[Academy]] that was founded by [[Plato]] in [[Athens]] about 300 years earlier, arrived in Rome. Cicero, "inspired by an extraordinary zeal for philosophy",<ref>Rawson:"Cicero, a portrait" (1975) p.18</ref> sat enthusiastically at his feet and absorbed Plato's philosophy. He admired especially Plato's moral and political seriousness, but he also respected his breadth of imagination.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
Cicero nonetheless rejected Plato's [[Theory of Forms|theory of Ideas]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}.
Cicero said of Plato's Dialogues, that if Zeus were to speak, he would use their language.<ref>{{cite web|title=Elpenor|url=http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/ancient-greece/plato-homepage.asp}}</ref>

== Public career ==
{{Main|Political career of Marcus Tullius Cicero}}

===Early political career===
His first office was as one of the twenty annual [[Quaestor]]s, a training post for serious public administration in a diversity of areas, but with a traditional emphasis on administration and rigorous accounting of public monies under the guidance of a senior magistrate or provincial commander. Cicero served as quaestor in western [[Sicily]] in 75 BC and demonstrated honesty and integrity in his dealings with the inhabitants. As a result, the grateful Sicilians asked Cicero to prosecute [[Gaius Verres]], a governor of Sicily, who had badly plundered Sicily. His prosecution of Gaius Verres was a great forensic success<ref>{{cite book
|title=The Oxford illustrated history of the Roman world
|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=w95Nb-BJWRcC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20Oxford%20illustrated%20history%20of%20the%20Roman%20world&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=extortionate&f=false
|accessdate=10 August 2011
|pages=84–}}</ref> for Cicero. Governor Gaius Verres hired the prominent lawyer of a noble family [[Quintus Hortensius|Quintus Hortensius Hortalus]]. After a lengthy period on Sicily collecting testimonials, evidence and persuading witnesses to come forth, Cicero returned to Rome and won the case in a series of dramatic court battles. His unique style of oratory set him apart from the flamboyant Hortalus. Upon the conclusion of this case, Cicero came to be considered the greatest orator in Rome. The view that Cicero may have taken the case for reasons of his own is viable. Quintus Hortensius Hortalus was, at this point, known as the best lawyer in [[Rome]]; to beat him would guarantee much success and prestige that Cicero needed to start his career. Cicero's oratorical skill is shown in his character assassination of Verres and various other persuasive techniques used towards the jury. One such example is found in the speech ''[[In Verrem|Against Verres I]]'', where he states "with you on this bench, gentlemen, with [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 91)|Marcus Acilius Glabrio]] as your president, I do not understand what Verres can hope to achieve".<ref>Trans. Grant, Michael. Cicero: Selected Works. London: Penguin Books. 1960.</ref> Oratory was considered a great art in ancient Rome and an important tool for disseminating knowledge and promoting oneself in elections, in part because there were no regular newspapers or mass media at the time. Cicero was neither a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] nor a plebeian [[nobiles|noble]]; his rise to political office despite his relatively humble origins has traditionally been attributed to his brilliance as an orator.<ref>http://www.bartleby.com/268/2/11.html</ref>

Cicero grew up in a time of civil unrest and war. [[Sulla]]’s victory in the first of a series of civil wars led to a new constitutional framework that undermined ''[[libertas]]'' (liberty), the fundamental value of the Roman Republic. Nonetheless, Sulla’s reforms strengthened the position of the [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] class, contributing to that class’s growing political power. Cicero was both an Italian ''eques'' and a ''[[novus homo]]'', but more importantly he was a [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|Roman constitutionalist]]. His social class and loyalty to the Republic ensured that he would "command the support and confidence of the people as well as the Italian middle classes". The fact that the ''[[optimates]]'' faction never truly accepted Cicero undermined his efforts to reform the Republic while preserving the constitution. Nevertheless, he was able to successfully ascend the Roman ''[[cursus honorum]]'', holding each magistracy at or near the youngest possible age: [[quaestor]] in 75 BC (age 31), [[aedile]] in 69 BC (age 37), and [[praetor]] in 66 BC (age 40), where he served as president of the "Reclamation" (or extortion) Court. He was then elected [[consul]] at age 43.

===Consul===
[[File:Maccari-Cicero.jpg|thumb|300px|''Cicero Denounces Catiline'', [[fresco]] by [[Cesare Maccari]], 1882–88]]
Cicero was elected Consul for the year 63 BC. His co-consul for the year, [[Gaius Antonius Hybrida]], played a minor role. During his year in office, he thwarted a conspiracy centered on assassinating him and overthrowing the [[Roman Republic]] with the help of foreign armed forces, led by [[Catiline|Lucius Sergius Catilina]]. Cicero procured a ''[[Senatus Consultum Ultimum]]'' (a&nbsp;declaration of [[martial law]]) and drove Catiline from the city with four vehement speeches (the [[Catiline Orations]]), which to this day remain outstanding examples of his rhetorical style. The Orations listed Catiline and his followers' debaucheries, and denounced Catiline's senatorial sympathizers as roguish and dissolute debtors clinging to Catiline as a final and desperate hope. Cicero demanded that Catiline and his followers leave the city. At the conclusion of his first speech, Catiline hurriedly left the senate, (which was being held in the [[Temple of Jupiter Stator (8th century BC)|Temple of Jupiter Stator]]). In his following speeches, Cicero did not directly address Catiline. He delivered <!--maybe; some scholars think not all the Catilinarians were actually delivered, but were rather published-->the second and third orations before the [[SPQR|people]], and the last one again before the Senate. By these speeches, Cicero wanted to prepare the Senate for the worst possible case; he also delivered more evidence against Catiline.<ref>Cicero, Marcus Tullius, Selected Works, Penguin Books Ltd, Great Britain, 1971</ref>

Catiline fled and left behind his followers to start the revolution from within while Catiline assaulted the city with an army of "moral bankrupts and honest fanatics". Catiline had attempted to involve the [[Allobroges]], a tribe of [[Transalpine Gaul]], in their plot, but Cicero, working with the Gauls, was able to seize letters which incriminated the five conspirators and forced them to confess their crimes in front of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]].<ref>Cicero, ''In Catilinam'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin//ptext?lookup=Cic.+Catil.+3.4 3.2] (at the Perseus Project); Sallust, ''Bellum Catilinae'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#40 40-45] (at Lacus Curtius); Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#18.4 18.4] (at Lacus Curtius).</ref>

The Senate then deliberated upon the conspirators' punishment. As it was the dominant advisory body to the various [[legislative]] assemblies rather than a [[judicial]] body, there were limits to its power; however, martial law was in effect, and it was feared that simple house arrest or exile&nbsp;– the standard options&nbsp;– would not remove the threat to the state. At first Decimus Silanus spoke for the "extreme penalty"; many were then swayed by Julius Caesar, who decried the precedent it would set and argued in favor of life imprisonment in various Italian towns. [[Cato the Younger]] then rose in defence of the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] and all the Senate finally agreed on the matter. Cicero had the conspirators taken to the [[Tullianum]], the notorious Roman prison, where they were strangled. Cicero himself accompanied the former consul [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura]], one of the conspirators, to the Tullianum. Cicero received the honorific "''[[Pater Patriae]]''" for his efforts to suppress the conspiracy, but lived thereafter in fear of trial or exile for having put Roman citizens to death without trial.

After the conspirators were put to death, Cicero was proud of his accomplishment. Some of his political enemies argue that though the act gained Cicero popularity, he exaggerated the extent of his success. He overestimated his popularity again several years later after being exiled from Italy and then allowed back from exile. At this time, he claimed that [[the Republic]] would be restored along with him. 
<ref>{{cite web|last=Clayton|first=Edward|title=Cicero (106—43 BCE)|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/cicero/#H2|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref>

===Exile and return===
In 60 BC Julius Caesar invited Cicero to be the fourth member of his existing partnership with [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus|Pompey]] and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], an assembly that would eventually be called the [[First Triumvirate]]. Cicero refused the invitation because he suspected it would undermine the Republic.<ref>Rawson, E.: ''Cicero'', 1984 106</ref>

In 58 BC, [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]], the [[tribune of the plebs]], introduced a law (the ''[[Leges Clodiae]]'') threatening exile to anyone who executed a Roman citizen without a trial. Cicero, having executed members of the [[Second Catilinarian Conspiracy]] four years previously without formal trial, and having had a public falling out with Clodius, was clearly the intended target of the law. Cicero argued that the ''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'' indemnified him from punishment, and he attempted to gain the support of the senators and consuls, especially of Pompey. When help was not forthcoming, he went into exile. He arrived at [[Thessalonica]], [[Greece]], on May&nbsp;23, 58&nbsp;BC.<ref>Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'', 1964 200</ref><ref>Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'', 1964 p.201</ref><ref>Plutarch. ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#32 32]</ref> Cicero's exile caused him to fall into depression. He wrote to [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]]: "Your pleas have prevented me from committing suicide. But what is there to live for? Don't blame me for complaining. My afflictions surpass any you ever heard of earlier".<ref>Haskell, H.J.: "This was Cicero" (1964) p.201</ref> After the intervention of recently elected [[tribune of Plebs|tribune]] [[Titus Annius Milo]], the senate voted in favor of recalling Cicero from exile. Clodius cast a single vote against the decree. Cicero returned to Italy on August&nbsp;5, 57&nbsp;BC, landing at [[Brundisium]].<ref>Cicero, ''Samtliga brev/Collected letters'' (in a Swedish translation)</ref> He was greeted by a cheering crowd, and, to his delight, his beloved daughter [[Tullia Ciceronis|Tullia]].<ref>Haskell. H.J.: ''This was Cicero'', p.204</ref>

Cicero tried to reintegrate himself into politics, but his attack on a bill of Caesar's proved unsuccessful. The conference at Luca in 56&nbsp;BC forced Cicero to make a recantation and pledge his support to the triumvirate. With this, a cowed Cicero retreated to his literary works. It is uncertain whether he had any direct involvement in politics for the following few years.<ref>Grant, M: "Cicero: Selected Works", p67</ref> He only reluctantly accepted a [[Promagistrate|promagistracy]] in [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Cilicia]] for 51&nbsp;BC, after a shortage of eligible [[Roman governor|governors]] was created by legislation requiring an interval of five years between a consulship or praetorship and a [[Roman province|provincial command]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} He was absent from Italy as [[proconsul]] of Cilicia from May 51 to November 50&nbsp;BC. Accompanied by his brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus]] as a [[Legatus|legate]], he was mostly spared from warfare due to internal conflict among the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], yet for storming a mountain fortress he acquired the title of [[imperator]].

===Julius Caesar's civil war===
The struggle between [[Pompey]] and Julius Caesar grew more intense in 50 BC. Cicero chose to favour Pompey as he was in defence of the senate and Republican tradition, but at the same time he prudently avoided openly alienating Caesar. When Caesar invaded Italy in 49 BC, Cicero fled Rome. Caesar, seeking the legitimacy an endorsement by a senior senator would provide, courted Cicero's favour, but even so Cicero slipped out of Italy and traveled to Dyrrachium ([[Epidamnos]]), Illyria, where Pompey's staff was situated.<ref>Everitt, Anthony: ''Cicero'' pp. 215.</ref> Cicero traveled with the Pompeian forces to [[Pharsalus]] in 48 BC,<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#38 38.1]</ref> though he was quickly losing faith in the competence and righteousness of the Pompeian lot. Eventually, he provoked the hostility of his fellow senator [[Cato the Younger|Cato]], who told him that he would have been of more use to the cause of the ''optimates'' if he had stayed in Rome. After Caesar's victory at Pharsalus, Cicero returned to Rome only very cautiously. Caesar pardoned him and Cicero tried to adjust to the situation and maintain his political work, hoping that Caesar might revive the Republic and its institutions.

In a letter to [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] on c. April 20, 46 BC, Cicero outlined his strategy under Caesar's dictatorship. Cicero, however, was taken completely by surprise when the ''[[Liberatores]]'' assassinated Caesar on the [[ides of March]], 44 BC. Cicero was not included in the conspiracy, even though the conspirators were sure of his sympathy. [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] called out Cicero's name, asking him to restore the republic when he lifted the bloodstained dagger after the assassination.<ref>Cicero, ''Second Philippic'' Against Antony</ref> A letter Cicero wrote in February 43 BC to [[Trebonius]], one of the conspirators, began, "How I could wish that you had invited me to that most glorious banquet on the [[Ides of March]]"!<ref>Cicero, ''Ad Familiares'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/fam10.shtml#28 10.28]</ref> Cicero became a popular leader during the period of instability following the assassination. He had no respect for [[Mark Antony]], who was scheming to take revenge upon Caesar's murderers. In exchange for amnesty for the assassins, he arranged for the Senate to agree not to declare Caesar to have been a tyrant, which allowed the Caesarians to have lawful support and kept Caesar's reforms and policies intact.<ref>Cecil W. Wooten, "Cicero's Philippics and Their Demosthenic Model" University of North Carolina Press</ref>

===Opposition to Mark Antony and death===
[[File:Assassinat de Cicéron.jpg|thumb|Cicero's death (France, 15th century).]]
Cicero and Antony then became the two leading men in Rome; Cicero as spokesman for the Senate and Antony as consul, leader of the Caesarian faction, and unofficial executor of Caesar's public will. The two men had never been on friendly terms and their relationship worsened after Cicero made it clear that he felt Antony to be taking unfair liberties in interpreting Caesar's wishes and intentions. When [[Augustus|Octavian]], Caesar's heir and adopted son, arrived in Italy in April, Cicero formed a plan to play him against Antony. In September he began attacking Antony in a series of speeches he called the [[Philippicae|Philippics]], after [[Demosthenes]]'s denunciations of [[Philip&nbsp;II of Macedon]]. Praising Octavian, he said that the young man only desired honor and would not make the same mistake as his adoptive father. During this time, Cicero's popularity as a public figure was unrivalled.<ref>Appian, ''Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/4*.html#19 4.19]</ref>

Cicero supported [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]] as governor of [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (''Gallia Cisalpina'') and urged the Senate to name Antony an enemy of the state. The speech of [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Lucius Piso]], Caesar's father-in-law, delayed proceedings against Antony. Antony was later declared an [[enemy of the state]] when he refused to lift the siege of [[Mutina]], which was in the hands of Decimus Brutus. Cicero’s plan to drive out Antony failed. Antony and Octavian reconciled and allied with [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]] to form the [[Second Triumvirate]] after the successive battles of [[Battle of Forum Gallorum|Forum Gallorum]] and [[Battle of Mutina|Mutina]]. The Triumvirate began [[proscription|proscribing]] their enemies and potential rivals immediately after legislating the alliance into official existence for a term of five years with consular ''[[imperium]]''. Cicero and all of his contacts and supporters were numbered among the enemies of the state, and reportedly, Octavian argued for two days against Cicero being added to the list.<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#46.3 46.3&ndash;5]</ref>

Cicero was one of the most viciously and doggedly hunted among the proscribed. He was viewed with sympathy by a large segment of the public and many people refused to report that they had seen him. He was caught December&nbsp;7, 43&nbsp;BC leaving his villa in [[Formiae]] in a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]] going to the seaside where he hoped to embark on a ship destined for Macedonia.<ref name="Haskell_1964_293">Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'' (1964) p.293</ref> When his killers – Herennius (a centurion) and Popilius (a tribune) – arrived, Cicero's own slaves said they had not seen him, but he was given away by Philologus, a freed slave of his brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus Cicero]].<ref name="Haskell_1964_293" />

Cicero's last words are said to have been, "There is nothing proper about what you are doing, soldier, but do try to kill me properly." He bowed to his captors, leaning his head out of the litter in a gladiatorial gesture to ease the task. By baring his neck and throat to the soldiers, he was indicating that he wouldn't resist. According to [[Plutarch]], Herennius first slew him, then cut off his head. On Antony's instructions his hands, which had penned the Philippics against Antony, were cut off as well; these were nailed along with his head on the [[Rostra]] in the [[Roman Forum|Forum Romanum]] according to the tradition of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] and [[Sulla]], both of whom had displayed the heads of their enemies in the Forum. Cicero was the only victim of the proscriptions to be displayed in that manner. According to [[Cassius Dio]] (in a story often mistakenly attributed to Plutarch),<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/47*.html#8.4 47.8.4]</ref> Antony's wife [[Fulvia]] took Cicero's head, pulled out his tongue, and jabbed it repeatedly with her hairpin in final revenge against Cicero's power of speech.<ref>Everitt, A.: ''Cicero, A turbulent life'' (2001)</ref>

Cicero's son, [[Cicero Minor|Marcus Tullius Cicero Minor]], during his year as a consul in 30&nbsp;BC, avenged his father's death, to a certain extent, when he announced to the Senate Mark Antony's naval defeat at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]] in 31&nbsp;BC by Octavian and his capable commander-in-chief, [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]].

Octavian (or Augustus, as he was later called) is reported to have praised Cicero as a patriot and a scholar of meaning in later times, within the circle of his family.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Cicero'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#49.5 49.5]</ref> However, it was the acquiescence of Augustus that allowed Cicero's assassination, as Cicero was proscribed by the new Triumvirate.

However, his career as a statesman was marked by inconsistencies and a tendency to shift his position in response to changes in the political climate. His indecision may be attributed to his sensitive and impressionable personality; he was prone to overreaction in the face of political and private change.
"Would that he had been able to endure prosperity with greater self control, and adversity with more fortitude!" wrote [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|C. Asinius Pollio]], a contemporary Roman statesman and historian.<ref>Haskell, H.J.:"This was Cicero" (1964) p.296</ref><ref>Castren and Pietilä-Castren: "Antiikin käsikirja" /"Handbook of antiquity" (2000) p.237</ref>

===Family===
[[File:Cicero.PNG|thumb|upright|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]
Cicero married [[Terentia]] probably at the age of 27, in 79 BC. According to the upper class [[Wiktionary:mores#English|mores]] of the day it was a marriage of convenience, but endured harmoniously for some 30 years. Terentia's family was wealthy, probably the [[Plebs|plebeian]] noble house of Terenti Varrones, thus meeting the needs of Cicero's political ambitions in both economic and social terms. She had a half sister (or perhaps first cousin) named Fabia, who as a child had become a [[Vestal Virgin]], a very great honour. Terentia was a strong willed woman and (citing Plutarch) "she took more interest in her husband's political career than she allowed him to take in household affairs."<ref>Rawson, E.: "Cicero, a portrait" (1975) p.25</ref>

In the 50s BC, Cicero's letters to Terentia became shorter and colder. He complained to his friends that Terentia had betrayed him but did not specify in which sense. Perhaps the marriage simply could not outlast the strain of the political upheaval in Rome, Cicero's involvement in it, and various other disputes between the two. The divorce appears to have taken place in 51 BC or shortly before.<ref>Susan Treggiari, ''Terentia, Tullia and Publilia: the women of Cicero's family'', London: Routledge, 2007, pp. 76f.</ref> In 46 or 45 BC,<ref>Treggiari, op. cit., p. 133</ref> Cicero married a young girl, Publilia, who had been his [[ward (law)|ward]]. It is thought that Cicero needed her money, particularly after having to repay the [[dowry]] of Terentia, who came from a wealthy family.<ref name="Rawson_1975_225">Rawson, E.: ''Cicero'' p.225</ref> This marriage did not last long.

Although his marriage to Terentia was one of convenience, it is commonly known that Cicero held great love for his daughter [[Tullia Ciceronis|Tullia]].<ref>Haskell H.J.: ''This was Cicero'', p.95</ref> When she suddenly became ill in February 45 BC and died after having seemingly recovered from giving birth to a son in January, Cicero was stunned. "I have lost the one thing that bound me to life" he wrote to Atticus.<ref name="Haskell_1964_249">Haskell, H.J.:"This was Cicero" (1964) p.249</ref> Atticus told him to come for a visit during the first weeks of his bereavement, so that he could comfort him when his pain was at its greatest. In Atticus's large library, Cicero read everything that the Greek philosophers had written about overcoming grief, "but my sorrow defeats all consolation."<ref>Cicero, ''Letters to Atticus'', 12.14. Rawson, E.: ''Cicero'' p. 225</ref> Caesar and [[Marcus Junius Brutus Caepio|Brutus]] as well as [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]] sent him letters of condolence.<ref>Rawson, E.:''Cicero'' p.226</ref><ref>Cicero, ''Samtliga brev/Collected letters''</ref>

Cicero hoped that his son [[Cicero Minor|Marcus]] would become a philosopher like him, but Marcus himself wished for a military career. He joined the army of [[Pompey]] in 49 BC and after Pompey's defeat at [[Battle of Pharsalus|Pharsalus]] 48 BC, he was pardoned by Caesar. Cicero sent him to Athens to study as a disciple of the [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] philosopher [[Cratippus of Pergamon|Kratippos]] in 48 BC, but he used this absence from "his father's vigilant eye" to "eat, drink and be merry."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Haskell|first=H.J|title=This was Cicero|year=1964|pages=103–104}}</ref> After Cicero's murder he joined the army of the ''[[Liberatores]]'' but was later pardoned by [[Augustus]]. Augustus' bad conscience for not having objected to Cicero's being put on the [[proscription]] list during the [[Second Triumvirate]] led him to aid considerably Marcus Minor's career. He became an [[augur]], and was nominated [[consul]] in 30 BC together with Augustus. As such, he was responsible for revoking the honors of [[Mark Antony]], who was responsible for the proscription, and could in this way take revenge. Later he was appointed [[proconsul]] of [[Syria]] and the province of [[Asia]].<ref>Paavo Castren & L. Pietilä-Castren: ''Antiikin käsikirja/Encyclopedia of the Ancient World''</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|Cicero about age&nbsp;60, from a marble bust]]
Cicero has been traditionally considered the master of Latin prose, with [[Quintilian]] declaring Cicero was "not the name of a man, but of eloquence itself. "<ref>Quntilian, [[Institutio Oratoria]] 10.1.1 12</ref> He is credited with transforming Latin from a modest utilitarian language into a versatile literary medium capable of expressing abstract and complicated thoughts with clarity.<ref>''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature'', "Ciceronian period" (1995) [http://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&pg=PA244 p. 244]</ref>  [[Julius Caesar]] praised Cicero's achievement by saying “it is more important to have greatly extended the frontiers of the Roman spirit (''ingenium'') than the frontiers of the Roman empire” <ref>Pliny, ''Natural History,'' 7.117</ref>  According to [[John William Mackail]], "Cicero’s unique and imperishable glory is that he created the language of the civilized world, and used that language to create a style which nineteen centuries have not replaced, and in some respects have hardly altered." <ref>Cicero, ''Seven orations'', 1912</ref>  
Cicero was also an energetic writer with an interest in a wide variety of subjects in keeping with the Hellenistic philosophical and rhetorical traditions in which he was trained. The quality and ready accessibility of Ciceronian texts favored very wide distribution and inclusion in teaching curricula as suggested by an amusing graffito at Pompeii admonishing "you will like Cicero, or you will be whipped" <ref>Hasan Niyazi, ''From Pompeii to Cyberspace - Transcending barriers with Twitter'' [http://www.3pipe.net/2011/05/from-pompeii-to-cyberspace-transcending.html]</ref>
Cicero was greatly admired by influential Latin [[Church Fathers]] such as [[Augustine of Hippo]], who credited Cicero's [[Lost work|lost]] ''[[Hortensius (Cicero)|Hortensius]]'' for his eventual conversion to Christianity<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 3:4</ref> and  St. [[Jerome]], who had a feverish vision in which he was accused of being "follower of Cicero and not of Christ" before the judgment seat.<ref>Jerome, ''Letter to Eustochium'', XXII:30</ref>
This influence further increased after the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in Europe, from which more of his writings survived than any other Latin author. Medieval philosophers were influenced by Cicero's writings on [[natural law]] and innate rights.
[[Petrarch]]'s rediscovery of Cicero's letters provided impetus for searches for ancient Greek and Latin writings scattered throughout European monasteries, and the subsequent rediscovery of [[Classical Antiquity]] led to the [[Renaissance]].  Subsequently, Cicero came to be regarded synonymous with classical Latin that many humanist scholars held that no Latin word or phrase was to be used unless it could be found in Cicero's works to the extent that [[Erasmus]] felt compelled to criticize such extremism in his treatise [[Ciceronianus]]. 
His voluminous correspondence, much of it addressed to his friend [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]], has been especially influential, introducing the art of refined letter writing to European culture. [[Cornelius Nepos]], the 1st century BC biographer of Atticus, remarked that Cicero's letters contained such a wealth of detail "concerning the inclinations of leading men, the faults of the generals, and the revolutions in the government" that their reader had little need for a history of the period.<ref>Cornelius Nepos, ''[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nepos.htm#Atticus Atticus]'' 16, trans. John Selby Watson.</ref>
Among Cicero's admirers were [[Desiderius Erasmus]], [[Martin Luther]], and [[John Locke]].<ref>Richards 2010, p.121</ref>  Following the invention of the printing press, ''[[De Officiis]]'' was the second book to be printed&nbsp;– second only to the Gutenberg Bible. Scholars note Cicero's influence on the rebirth of religious toleration in the 17th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=12681|title=John Marshall. John Locke, Toleration and Early Enlightenment Culture: Religious Toleration and Arguments for Religious Toleration in Early Modern and Early Enlightenment Europe|author=William Gibson|year=2006|accessdate=8 July 2012|publisher=H-Albion}}</ref>

While Cicero the humanist deeply influenced the culture of the [[Renaissance]], Cicero the republican inspired the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] and the revolutionaries of the [[French Revolution]].<ref>De Burgh, W.G., "The legacy of the ancient world"</ref> [[John Adams]] said of him "As all the ages of the world have not produced a greater statesman and philosopher united than Cicero, his authority should have great weight."<ref>''American republicanism: Roman Ideology in the United States'' [[Mortimer Sellers|Mortimer N. S. Sellers]], NYU Press, 1994</ref> Jefferson names Cicero as one of a handful of major figures who contributed to a tradition “of public right” that informed his draft of the Declaration of Independence and shaped American understandings of "the common sense" basis for the right of revolution.<ref>Thomas Jefferson, “Letter to Henry Lee,” 8 May 1825, in The Political Thought of American Statesmen, eds. Morton Frisch and Richard Stevens (Itasca, Ill.: F. E. Peacock Publishers, 1973), 12.</ref> [[Camille Desmoulins]] said of the French republicans in 1789 that they were "mostly young people who, nourished by the reading of Cicero at school, had become passionate enthusiasts for liberty".<ref>{{cite book |last= Aulard |first= François-Alphonse |title= Histoire politique de la Révolution française: Origines et Développement de la Démocratie et de la République (1789-1804) |publisher= Librairie Armand Colin |year= 1901|page=5}}</ref>
[[Jim Powell (historian)|Jim Powell]] starts his book on the history of liberty with the sentence: "Marcus Tullius Cicero expressed principles that became the bedrock of liberty in the modern world." Legitimate government protects liberty and justice according to "natural law." "[[Murray N. Rothbard]] praised Cicero as 'the great transmitter of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] ideas from Greece to Rome.&nbsp;... Stoic natural law doctrines ... helped shape the great structures of [[Roman law]] which became pervasive in Western Civilization." Government's purpose was the protection of private property.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Triumph of Liberty: A 2,000 Year History Told Through the Lives of Freedom's Greatest Champions|last=Powell|first=Jim|date=July 4, 2000|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0684859675|pages=2–10}}</ref>

Likewise, no other antique personality has inspired venomous dislike as Cicero especially in more modern times.<ref>Bailey, D.R.S. "Cicero's letters to Atticus" (1978) p.16</ref> His commitment to the values of the Republic accommodated a hatred of the poor and persistent opposition to the advocates and mechanisms of popular representation.<ref>''Letters to Atticus I & II''</ref> [[Friedrich Engels]] referred to him as "the most contemptible scoundrel in history" for upholding republican "democracy" while at the same time denouncing land and class reforms.<ref>Noted in Michael Parenti, ''The Assassination of Julius Caesar: A People's History of Ancient Rome'', 2003:86. ISBN 1-56584-797-0</ref> Cicero has faced criticism for exaggerating the democratic qualities of republican Rome, and for defending the Roman oligarchy against the popular reforms of Caesar. [[Michael Parenti]] admits Cicero's abilities as an orator, but finds him a vain, pompous and hypocritical  personality who, when it suited  him, could show public support for popular causes that he privately despised. Parenti presents Cicero's prosecution of the Catiline conspiracy as legally flawed at least, and possibly unlawful.<ref>Michael Parenti, ''[[The Assassination of Julius Caesar: A People's History of Ancient Rome]]'', 2003, pp. 107–111, 93. ISBN 1-56584-797-0</ref>

Cicero also had an influence on modern astronomy. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], searching for ancient views on earth motion, said that he "first&nbsp;... found in Cicero that [[Hicetas]] supposed the earth to move."<ref>{{cite book |last=Spielvogel |first=Jackson |page=492 |title=Western Civilization since 1300 |isbn= 978-1-111-34219-7 |year=2011 |publisher=Cengage Learning}}</ref>

==Works==
{{Main|Writings of Marcus Tullius Cicero}}
Cicero was declared a "[[righteous pagan]]" by the early [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], and therefore many of his works were deemed worthy of preservation. Subsequent Roman writers quoted liberally from his works ''[[De Re Publica]]'' (''On The Republic'') and ''[[De Legibus]]'' (''On The Laws''), and much of his work has been recreated from these surviving fragments. Cicero also articulated an early, abstract conceptualization of rights, based on ancient law and custom. Of Cicero's books, six on rhetoric have survived, as well as parts of eight on philosophy. Of his speeches, 88 were recorded, but only 58 survive.

==Notable fictional portrayals==
[[Ben Jonson]] dramatised the [[Second Catilinarian Conspiracy|conspiracy of Catiline]] in his play ''[[Catiline His Conspiracy]]'', featuring Cicero as a character. Cicero also appears as a minor character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''.

Cicero was portrayed on the motion picture screen by British actor [[Alan Napier]] in the 1953 film ''[[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|Julius Caesar]]'', based on Shakespeare's play. He has also been played by such noted actors as [[Michael Hordern]] (in ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''), and [[Andre Morell]] (in the 1970 ''[[Julius Caesar (1970 film)|Julius Caesar]]''). Most recently, [[List of Rome characters|Cicero]] was portrayed by [[David Bamber]] in the HBO series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'' (2005–2007) and appeared in both seasons.

In her series of historical novels "[[Masters of Rome]]" [[Colleen McCullough]] presents an unflattering depiction of Cicero's career, showing him struggling with an inferiority complex and vanity, morally flexible and fatally indiscreet, while his rival [[Julius Caesar]] is shown in a more approving light. Cicero is portrayed as a hero in the novel ''[[A Pillar of Iron]]'' by [[Taylor Caldwell]] (1965). [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]' novels ''[[Imperium (novel)|Imperium]]'' and ''[[Lustrum (novel)|Lustrum]]'' (''Conspirata'' in the U.S.) are the first two parts of a planned trilogy of novels based upon the life of Cicero. In these novels Cicero's character is depicted in a more balanced way than in those of McCullough, with his positive traits equaling or outweighing his weaknesses (while conversely Caesar is depicted as more sinister than in McCullough). Cicero is a major recurring character in the ''[[Roma Sub Rosa]]'' series of mystery novels by [[Steven Saylor]]. He also appears several times as a peripheral character in [[John Maddox Roberts]]'s ''[[SPQR series|SPQR]]'' series. Roberts's protagonist, [[Decius Metellus]], admires Cicero for his erudition, but is disappointed by his lack of real opposition to Caesar, as well as puzzled by his relentless fawning on the ''Optimates'', who secretly despise Cicero as a parvenu.
