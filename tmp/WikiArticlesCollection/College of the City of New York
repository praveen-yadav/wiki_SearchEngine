The '''College of the City of New York''' is the former name of [[New York University]]'s undergraduate college when the university was named "University of the City of New York".

It was also from 1866 to 1929 the official name of the first college in the public university system of New York City, later named (and still called) the [[City College of New York]], and now officially the City College of the [[City University of New York]].

It may be used erroneously to refer to the [[New York City College of Technology]], established in 1946.
