'''Cognitive psychology''' is the study of [[mental processes]] such as "[[attention]], language use, [[memory]], [[perception]], problem solving, and [[Cognition|thinking]]."<ref>[http://www.apa.org/research/action/glossary.aspx American Psychological Association (2013). Glossary of psychological terms]</ref> Much of the work derived from cognitive psychology has been integrated into various other modern disciplines of psychological study including [[social psychology]], [[personality psychology]], [[abnormal psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], [[educational psychology]], and [[economics]].

==History==
Philosophically, ruminations of the human mind and its processes have been around since the times of the ancient Greeks. In 387 BC, [[Plato]] is known to have suggested that the brain was the seat of the mental processes.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/courses/1010/mangels/neuro/history/history.html Mangels, J. History of neuroscience]</ref> In 1637, René Descartes posited that humans are born with innate ideas, and forwarded the idea of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind-body dualism]], which would come to be known as substance dualism (essentially the idea that the mind and the body are two separate substances).<ref name="Malone">Malone, J.C. (2009). Psychology: Pythagoras to present. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. (a pp. 143, b pp. 293, c pp. 491)</ref> From that time, major debates ensued through the 19th century regarding whether human thought was solely experiential ([[empiricism]]), or included innate knowledge ([[Psychological nativism|nativism]]).  Some of those involved in this debate included [[George Berkeley]] and [[John Locke]] on the side of empiricism, and [[Immanuel Kant]] on the side of nativism.<ref name="Anderson">Anderson, J.R. (2010). Cognitive psychology and its implications. New York, NY: Worth Publishers.</ref> 
osophical debate continuing, the mid to late 18th century was a critical time in the development of psychology as a scientific discipline. Two discoveries that would later play substantial roles in cognitive psychology were [[Paul Broca]]'s discovery of the area of the brain largely responsible for language production,<ref name="Malone" /> and [[Carl Wernicke]]'s discovery of an area thought to be mostly responsible for comprehension of language.<ref>Eysenck, M.W. (1990). Cognitive psychology: An international review. West Sussex, England: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. (pp. 111)</ref> Both areas were subsequently formally named for their founders and disruptions of an individual's language production or comprehension due to trauma or malformation in these areas have come to commonly be known as [[Expressive aphasia|Broca's aphasia]] and [[Receptive aphasia|Wernicke's aphasia]]. 

In the mid-20th century, three main influences arose that would inspire and shape cognitive psychology as a formal school of thought:
*With the development of new warfare technology during [[World War II|WWII]], the need for a greater understanding of human performance came to prominence. Problems such as how to best train soldiers to use new technology and how to deal with matters of attention while under duress became areas of need for military personnel. [[Behaviorism]] provided little if any insight into these matters and it was the work of [[Donald Broadbent]], integrating concepts from human performance research and the recently developed [[information theory]], that forged the way in this area.<ref name="Anderson" />
*Developments in computer science would lead to parallels being drawn between human thought and the computational functionality of computers, opening entirely new areas of psychological thought. Allen Newell and Herbert Simon spent years developing the concept of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) and later worked with cognitive psychologists regarding the implications of AI. The effective result was more of a framework conceptualization of mental functions with their counterparts in computers (memory, storage, retrieval, etc.)<ref name="Anderson" />
*[[Noam Chomsky]]'s 1959 critique<ref name="Chomsky 1959">Chomsky, N. A. (1959), A Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior</ref> of behaviorism, and empiricism more generally, initiated what would come to be known as the "[[cognitive revolution]]".

[[Ulric Neisser]] is credited with formally having coined the term "cognitive psychology" (in terms of the current understanding of cognitive psychology) in his book ''Cognitive  Psychology,'' published in 1967.<ref name = Neisser>Neisser, U. (1967). Cognitive psychology. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. Neisser's definition on page 4.</ref>  Neisser's definition of "cognition" illustrates the, then, progressive concept of cognitive processes well:

<blockquote>The term "cognition" refers to all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used. It is concerned with these processes even when they operate in the absence of relevant stimulation, as in images and [[hallucinations]]... Given such a sweeping definition, it is apparent that cognition is involved in everything a human being might possibly do; that every psychological phenomenon is a cognitive phenomenon. But although cognitive psychology is concerned with all human activity rather than some fraction of it, the concern is from a particular point of view. Other viewpoints are equally legitimate and necessary. Dynamic psychology, which begins with motives rather than with sensory input, is a case in point. Instead of asking how a man's actions and experiences result from what he saw, remembered, or believed, the dynamic psychologist asks how they follow from the subject's goals, needs, or instincts.<ref name = Neisser/>
</blockquote>

==The mental processes==
The main focus of cognitive psychologists is on the [[mental processes]] that affect behavior. Those processes include, but are not limited to, the following:

===Attention===
The psychological definition of [[attention]] is "A state of focused awareness on a subset of the available perceptual information".<ref name=APA>{{cite web|title=How does the APA define "psychology"? | url = http://www.apa.org/support/about/apa/psychology.aspx#answer | accessdate = 15 November 2011}}</ref> The key function of [[attention]] is to discriminate between irrelevant data and filter it out, enabling the desired data to be distributed to the other [[mental processes]].<ref name="Anderson" /> The human brain may, at times, simultaneously receive inputs in the form of [[Auditory system|auditory]], [[visual]], [[olfactory]], [[taste]], and [[tactile]] information. Without the ability to filter out some or most of that simultaneous information and focus on one or typically two at most, the brain would become overloaded as a person attempted to process that information.<ref name=Anderson />
One major focal point relating to [[attention]] within the field of cognitive psychology is the concept of divided [[attention]]. A number of early studies dealt with the ability of a person wearing headphones to discern meaningful conversation when presented with different messages into each ear.<ref name=Anderson /> Key findings involved an increased understanding of the mind's ability to both focus on one message, while still being somewhat aware of information being taken in from the ear not being consciously attended to. E.g. participants (wearing earphones) may be told that they will be hearing separate messages in each ear and that they are expected to attend only to information related to basketball. When the experiment starts, the message about basketball will be presented to the left ear and non-relevant information will be presented to the right ear. At some point the message related to basketball will switch to the right ear and the non-relevant information to the left ear. When this happens, the listener is usually able to repeat the entire message at the end, having attended to the left or right ear only when it was appropriate.<ref name="Anderson" />

===Memory===
Modern conceptions of [[memory]] typically break it down into three main sub-classes. These three classes are somewhat [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] in nature, in terms of the level of [[conscious]] thought related to their use.<ref name="Balota">Balota, D.A. & Marsh, E.J. (2004). Cognitive psychology: Key readings. New York, NY: Psychology Press. (pp. 364-365)</ref>
*[[Procedural memory]] is memory for the performance of particular types of action. It is often activated on a [[subconscious]] level, or at most requires a minimal amount of [[conscious]] effort. [[Procedural memory]] includes [[Stimulus-response model|stimulus-response]] type information which is activated through association with particular tasks, routines, etc. A person is using [[procedural knowledge]] when they seemingly "automatically" respond in a particular manner, to a particular situation or process.<ref name=Balota /> 
*[[Semantic memory]] is the encyclopedic knowledge that a person possesses. Things like what the [[Eiffel Tower]] looks like, or the name of a friend from sixth grade would be [[semantic memory]]. Access of [[semantic memory]] ranges from slightly to extremely effortful, which depends on a number of variables including but not limited to: recency of encoding of the information, number of associations it has to other information, frequency of access, and levels of meaning (how deeply it was processed when it was encoded).<ref name=Balota />
*[[Episodic memory]] is the memory of autobiographical events that can be explicitly stated. It contains all memories that are temporal in nature, such as when you last brushed your teeth, where you were when you heard about a major news event, etc. [[Episodic memory]] typically requires the deepest level of [[consciousness|conscious]] thought, as it often pulls together [[semantic memory]] and temporal information to formulate the entire [[memory]].<ref name=Balota />

===Perception===
[[Perception]] involves both the physical senses (sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch, and [[proprioception]]) as well as the [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] involved in interpreting those senses. Essentially, it is how people come to understand the world around them through interpretation of stimuli.<ref>[http://psychology.about.com/od/sensationandperception/ss/perceptproc.htm Cherry, K. (2013). [[Perception]] and the perceptual process]</ref> Early psychologists like [[Edward Titchener|Edward B. Titchener]], began to work with perception in their [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralist]] approach to psychology. [[Structuralism (psychology)|Structuralism]] dealt heavily with trying to reduce human thought (or "consciousness," as Titchener would have called it) into its most basic elements by gaining understanding of how an individual perceives particular stimuli.<ref>[http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/titchener.shtml Plucker, J. (2012). Edward Bradford Titchener]</ref><br>
Current perspectives on [[perception]] within cognitive psychology tend to focus on particular ways in which the human mind interprets stimuli from the senses and how these interpretations affect behavior. An example of the way in which modern psychologists approach the study of [[perception]] would be the research being done at the Center for Ecological Study of Perception and Action at the University of Connecticut (CESPA). One study at CESPA concerns ways in which individuals perceive their physical environment and how that influences their navigation through that environment.<ref>[http://ione.psy.uconn.edu/ University of Connecticut (N.D.). Center for the ecological study of perception]</ref><br>

===Language===
Psychologists have had an interest in the cognitive processes involved with [[language]] that dates back to the 1870s, when [[Carl Wernicke]] proposed a model for the mental processing of language.<ref>Temple, Christine M. (1990). Developments and applications of cognitive neuropsychology. In M. W. Eysenck (Ed.)''Cognitive psychology: An international review''. West Sussex, England: John Wiley & Sons Ltd. p. 110</ref> Current work on [[language]] within the field of cognitive psychology varies widely. Cognitive psychologists may study [[language acquisition]],<ref name=Ramsden>Conti-Ramsden, G. & Durkin, K. (2012). ''Neuropsychology Review, 22'', 384-401. DOI 10.1007/s11065-012-9208-z</ref> individual components of [[language]] formation (like [[phoneme]]s),<ref>Valimaa-Blum, R. (2009). The phoneme in cognitive phonology: episodic memories of both meaningful and meaningless units. ''CogniTextes, 2''. DOI : 10.4000/cognitextes.211</ref> how language use is involved in [[Mood (psychology)|mood]],<ref>[http://www.mpi.nl/departments/other-research/research-projects/language-in-action/subprojects/Mood-and-language-comprehension Berkum, J. Language in action - Mood and language comprehension]</ref> or numerous other related areas.<br />
Significant work has been done recently with regard to understanding the timing of [[language acquisition]] and how it can be used to determine if a child has, or is at risk of, developing a [[learning disability]]. A study from 2012, showed that while this can be an effective strategy, it is important that those making evaluations include all relevant information when making their assessments. Factors such as individual variability, [[socioeconomic status]], [[Short term memory|short term]] and [[Long-term memory|long term memory]] capacity, and others must be included in order to make valid assessments.<ref name=Ramsden />

===Metacognition===
[[Metacognition]], in a broad sense, is the thoughts that a person has about their own thoughts. More specifically, [[metacognition]] includes things like:
*How effective a person is at monitoring their own performance on a given task (self-regulation).
*A person's understanding of their capabilities on particular mental tasks.
*The ability to apply [[Cognitive style|cognitive strategies]].<ref>[http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.clemson.edu/stable/20442131 Martinez, M.E. (2006). What is metacognition. ''The Phi Delta Kappan'', 87(9),  696-699]</ref> 
Much of the current study regarding [[metacognition]] within the field of cognitive psychology deals with its application within the area of education. Being able to increase a student's metacognitive abilities has been shown to have a significant impact on their learning and study habits.<ref>[http://blog.brainscape.com/2010/04/learning-study-less/ Cohen, A. (2010). The secret to learning more while studying]</ref> One key aspect of this concept is the improvement of students' ability to set goals and self-regulate effectively to meet those goals. As a part of this process, it is also important to ensure that students are realistically evaluating their personal degree of knowledge and setting realistic goals (another [[Metacognition|metacognitive]] task).<ref>[http://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/metacognition/teaching_metacognition.html Lovett, M. (2008). Teaching metacognition]</ref>

==Modern cognitive psychology==
Modern perspectives on cognitive psychology generally address cognition as a [[dual process theory]], introduced by [[Jonathan Haidt]] in 2006, and expounded upon by [[Daniel Kahneman]] in 2011.<ref name=Kahneman>Kahneman D. (2003) A perspective on judgement and choice. ''American Psychologist''. ''58'', 697-720.</ref> Kahneman differentiated the two styles of processing more, calling them intuition and reasoning. Intuition (or system 1), similar to associative reasoning, was determined to be fast and automatic, usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning process. Kahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and very difficult to change or manipulate. Reasoning (or system 2) was slower and much more volatile, being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes.<ref name=Kahneman />

==Applications of cognitive psychology==

===Abnormal psychology===
Following the cognitive revolution, and as a result of many of the principle discoveries to come out of the field of cognitive psychology, the discipline of cognitive therapy evolved. [[Aaron T. Beck]] is generally regarded as the father of cognitive therapy.<ref>[http://www.med.upenn.edu/suicide/beck/index.html University of Pennsylvania (N.D). Aaron T. Beck, M.D.]</ref> His work in the areas of recognition and treatment of depression has gained worldwide notoriety. In his 1987 book titled ''Cognitive Therapy of Depression'', Beck puts forth three salient points with regard to his reasoning for the treatment of depression by means of therapy or therapy and antidepressants versus using a pharmacological-only approach:
<blockquote>1. Despite the prevalent use of antidepressants, the fact remains that not all patients respond to them. Beck cites (in 1987) that only 60 to 65% of patients respond to antidepressants, and recent [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] (a statistical breakdown of multiple studies) show very similar numbers.<ref>[http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2009/02/03/efficacy-of-antidepressants/ Grohol, J. (2009). Efficacy of Antidepressants]</ref><br>2.Many of those who do respond to antidepressants end up not taking their medications, for various reasons. They may develop side-effects or have some form of personal objection to taking the drugs.<br>3. Beck posits that the use of [[Psychotropic|psychotropic drugs]] may lead to an eventual breakdown in the individual's [[Coping (psychology)|coping mechanisms]]. His theory is that the person essentially becomes reliant on the medication as a means of improving mood and fails to practice those coping techniques typically practiced by healthy individuals to alleviate the effects of depressive symptoms. By failing to do so, once the patient is weaned off of the antidepressants, they often are unable to cope with normal levels of depressed mood and feel driven to reinstate use of the antidepressants.<ref>Beck, A.T. (1987). Cognitive therapy of depression. New York, NY: Guilford Press</ref></blockquote>

===Social psychology===
Many facets of modern social psychology have roots in research done within the field of cognitive psychology. [[Social cognition]] is a specific sub-set of social psychology that concentrates on processes that have been of particular focus within cognitive psychology, specifically applied to human interactions. [[Gordon Moskowitz|Gordon B. Moskowitz]] defines social cognition as "...the study of the mental processes involved in perceiving, attending to, remembering, thinking about, and making sense of the people in our social world".<ref>Moskowitz, G.B. (2004). Social cognition: Understanding self and others. New York, NY: The Guilford Press. (pp. 3)</ref> 

The development of multiple [[social information processing]] models (SIP) has been influential in studies involving aggressive and anti-social behavior. Kenneth Dodge's SIP model is one of, if not the most, empirically supported models relating to aggression. Among his research, Dodge posits that children who possess a greater ability to process social information more often display higher levels of socially acceptable behavior. His model asserts that there are five steps that an individual proceeds through when evaluating interactions with other individuals and that how the person interprets cues is key to their reactionary process.<ref>Fontaine, R.G. (2012). The mind of the criminal: The role of developmental social cognition in criminal defense law. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. (pp. 41)</ref>

===Developmental psychology===
Many of the prominent names in the field of developmental psychology base their understanding of development on cognitive models. One of the major paradigms of developmental psychology, the [[Theory of Mind]] (ToM), deals specifically with the ability of an individual to effectively understand and attribute cognition to those around them. This concept typically becomes fully apparent in children between the ages of 4 and 6. Essentially, before the child develops ToM, they are unable to understand that those around them can have different thoughts, ideas, or feelings than themselves. The development of ToM is a matter of [[metacognition]], or thinking about one's thoughts. The child must be able to recognize that they have their own thoughts and in turn, that others possess thoughts of their own.<ref>[http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/documents/Astington-EdwardANGxp.pdf Astington, J.W. & Edward, M.J. (2010). The development of theory of mind in early childhood. Encyclopedia on Early Childhood Development, 2010:1-6]</ref><br>
One of the foremost minds with regard to developmental psychology, Jean Piaget, focused much of his attention on cognitive development from birth through adulthood. Though there have been considerable challenges to parts of his [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|stages of cognitive development]], they remain a staple in the realm of education. Piaget's concepts and ideas predated the cognitive revolution but inspired a wealth of research in the field of cognitive psychology and many of his principles have been blended with modern theory to synthesize the predominant views of today.<ref>Brainerd, C.J. (1996). Piaget: A centennial celebration. ''Psychological Science, 7''(4), 191-194.</ref>

===Educational psychology===
Modern theories of education have applied many concepts that are focal points of cognitive psychology. Some of the most prominent concepts include:
*[[Metacognition]]: Metacognition is a broad concept encompassing all manners of one's thoughts and knowledge about their own thinking. A key area of educational focus in this realm is related to self-monitoring, which relates highly to how well students are able to evaluate their personal knowledge and apply strategies to improve knowledge in areas in which they are lacking.<ref name="Reif">Reif, F. (2008). Applying cognitive science to education: Thinking and learning in scientific and other complex domains. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. (a pp. 283-84, b pp. 38)</ref>
*[[Declarative knowledge]] and [[procedural knowledge]]: Declarative knowledge is a persons 'encyclopedic' knowledge base, whereas procedural knowledge is specific knowledge relating to performing particular tasks. The application of these cognitive paradigms to education attempts to augment a student's ability to integrate declarative knowledge into newly learned procedures in an effort to facilitate accelerated learning.<ref name="Reif" />
*[[Knowledge organization]]: Applications of cognitive psychology's understanding of how knowledge is organized in the brain has been a major focus within the field of education in recent years. The hierarchical method of organizing information and how that maps well onto the brain's memory are concepts that that have proven extremely beneficial in classrooms.<ref name="Reif" />

===Personality psychology===
The [[Big Five personality traits|Big 5 personality traits]] are five broad domains or dimensions of personality that are used to describe human personality. Those five traits include [[neuroticism]], [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]], [[Openness to experience|openness]], [[conscientiousness]], and [[agreeableness]]. 
Cognitive therapeutic approaches have received considerable attention in the treatment of personality disorders in recent years. The approach focuses on the formation of what it believes to be faulty schemata, centralized on judgmental biases and general cognitive errors.<ref>Beck, A.T., Freeman, A., & Davis, D.D. (2004). Cognitive therapy of personality disorders (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford Press. (pp. 300).</ref>

==Cognitive psychology vs. cognitive science==
The line between cognitive psychology and cognitive science can be a blurry one. The differentiation between the two is best understood in terms of cognitive psychology's relationship to [[applied psychology]], and the understanding of psychological phenomena. Cognitive psychologists are often heavily involved in running psychological experiments involving human participants, with the goal of gathering information related to how the human mind takes in, processes, and acts upon inputs received from the outside world.<ref>Baddeley, A. & Bernses, O.A. (1989). Cognitive Psychology: Research Directions In Cognitive Science: European perspectives, Vol 1 (pp. 7). East Sussex, UK: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Ltd. (pg. 7)</ref> The information gained in this area is then often used in the applied field of clinical psychology. One of the [[paradigm]]s of cognitive psychology derived in this manner, is that every individual develops [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]] which motivate the person to think or act in a particular way in the face of a particular circumstance. E.g., most people have a schema for waiting in line. When approaching some type of service counter where people are waiting their turn, most people don't just walk to the front of the line and butt in. Their schema for that situation tells them to get in the back of the line. This then applies to the field of [[abnormal psychology]] as a result of individuals sometimes developing faulty schemata which lead them to consistently react in a dysfunctional manner. If a person has a schema that says "I am no good at making friends", they may become so reluctant to pursue interpersonal relationships that they become prone to seclusion.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Cognitive science is better understood as predominantly concerned with gathering data through [[research]]. Cognitive science envelopes a much broader scope, which has links to philosophy, linguistics, anthropology, neuroscience, and particularly with artificial intelligence. It could be said that cognitive science provides the database of information that fuels the theory from which cognitive psychologists operate.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognitive-science/ Thagard, P. (2010). Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]</ref> Cognitive scientists' research mostly involves non-human subjects, allowing them to delve into areas which would come under ethical scrutiny if performed on human participants. I.e., they may do research  implanting devices in the brains of rats to track the firing of neurons while the rat performs a particular task. Cognitive science is highly involved in the area of artificial intelligence and its application to the understanding of mental processes.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Criticisms==
In its early years, [[Behaviorism|critics]] held that the empiricism of cognitive psychology was incompatible with its acceptance of internal mental states. However, the sibling field of [[cognitive neuroscience]] has provided evidence of physiological brain states that directly correlate with mental states - thus providing support for the central assumption of cognitive psychology.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Howard|title=Changing Minds|year=2006|publisher=Harvard Business School Publishing|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=1-4221-0329-3}}</ref>

As cognitive psychology gained momentum as a movement, through the 1970s, the complexity of the processes involved in human thought, in the opinion of many, fractured studies of cognition so greatly that the field lost cohesion. John C. Malone poses the assertion, in his book: ''Psychology: Pythagoras to Present'', that "Examinations of late twentieth-century textbooks dealing with 'cognitive psychology', 'human cognition', 'cognitive science', and the like quickly reveals that there are many, many varieties of cognitive psychology and very little agreement about exactly what may be its domain".<ref name="Malone" />

The information processing approach to cognitive functioning is currently being questioned by new approaches in psychology, such as [[dynamical systems]], and the [[embodied cognition|embodiment]] perspective.
