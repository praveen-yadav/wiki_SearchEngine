'''David Warren''' "'''Dave'''" '''Brubeck''' (December 6, 1920&nbsp;– December 5, 2012) was an American [[Jazz piano|jazz pianist]] and composer, considered to be one of the foremost exponents of [[cool jazz]]. He wrote a number of [[jazz standard]]s, including "[[In Your Own Sweet Way]]" and "The Duke". Brubeck's style ranged from refined to bombastic, reflecting his mother's attempts at [[Classical music|classical]] training and his [[improvisation]]al skills. His music is known for employing unusual [[time signature]]s, and superimposing contrasting rhythms, [[meter (music)|meters]], and [[tonality|tonalities]].

His long-time musical partner, [[alto saxophonist]] [[Paul Desmond]], wrote the saxophone melody for the [[#Dave Brubeck Quartet|Dave Brubeck Quartet]]'s best remembered piece, "[[Take Five]]",<ref name="City of Concord news release" /> which is in 5/4 time and has endured as a jazz classic on one of the top-selling jazz albums, ''[[Time Out (album)|Time Out]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazz.com/gallery/sony-collectibles |title=Jazz Music – Jazz Artists – Jazz News |publisher=Jazz.com |accessdate=May 4, 2012}}</ref> Brubeck experimented with [[time signature]]s throughout his career, recording "Pick Up Sticks" in 6/4, "[[Unsquare Dance]]" in 7/4, "World's Fair" in 13/4, and "[[Blue Rondo à la Turk]]" in 9/8. He was also a respected composer of orchestral and [[sacred music]], and wrote soundtracks for television such as ''[[Mr. Broadway]]'' and the animated [[miniseries]] ''[[This Is America, Charlie Brown]]''.

==Early life and career==
Brubeck was born in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] city of [[Concord, California|Concord]], California,<ref name="City of Concord news release">[http://web.archive.org/web/20070928000204/http://www.ci.concord.ca.us/about/citynews/releases/2006/05-04-06-brubeck.htm Reception honors Concord native son, jazz great Dave Brubeck], ci.concord.ca.us. Retrieved September 28, 2007</ref> and grew up in [[Ione, California|Ione]]. His father, Peter Howard "Pete" Brubeck, was a [[cattle rancher]], and his mother, Elizabeth (née Ivey), who had studied piano in England under [[Myra Hess]] and intended to become a [[concert pianist]], taught piano for extra money.<ref name="bookref1">{{cite book|last=Storb|first=Ilse|title=Jazz meets the world – the world meets Jazz, Volume 4 of Populäre Musik und Jazz in der Forschung|publisher=LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster|year=2000|page=129|url=|isbn=3-8258-3748-3}}</ref> His father had Swiss ancestry (the family surname was originally "Brodbeck") and a Native American [[Modoc people|Modoc]] lineage,<ref>[http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/the-second-oldest-profession-pt-4/ "The Second Oldest Profession?

He could not [[musical notation|read music]] during these early lessons, attributing this difficulty to poor eyesight, but "faked" his way through, well enough that this deficiency went mostly unnoticed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fishko |first=Sara |url=http://www.wnyc.org/music/articles/32460 |title=An Hour With Dave Brubeck |publisher=WNYC |date= |accessdate=2013-07-13}}</ref>

Intending to work with his father on their ranch, Brubeck entered the College of the Pacific in [[Stockton, California]] (now the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]]), studying [[veterinary science]]. He changed to music on the urging of the head of [[zoology]], Dr. Arnold, who told him "Brubeck, your mind's not here. It's across the lawn in the [[Music school|conservatory]]. Please go there. Stop wasting my time and yours."<ref>''It's About Time: The Dave Brubeck Story'', by Fred M. Hall.</ref> Later, Brubeck was nearly expelled when one of his professors discovered that he could not read music. Several of his professors came forward, arguing that his ability with [[counterpoint]] and [[harmony]] more than compensated. The college was still afraid that it would cause a scandal, and agreed to let Brubeck graduate only after he had promised never to teach piano.<ref name="Cowboy to Jazzman">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/brubeck/theMan/cowboyToJazzman.htm |title=Rediscovering Dave Brubeck &#124; The Man &#124; With Hedrick Smith |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2013-07-13}}</ref>

After graduating in 1942, Brubeck was drafted into the U.S. Army. He served in Europe in the [[Third United States Army|Third Army]]. He volunteered to play piano at a [[Red Cross]] show and was such a hit that he was spared from combat service and ordered to form a band. He created one of the U.S. armed forces' first [[racial integration|racially integrated]] bands, "The Wolfpack".<ref name="Cowboy to Jazzman" /> While serving in the military, Brubeck met [[Paul Desmond]] in early 1944.<ref>Liner notes to the album "25th Anniversary Reunion", by The Dave Brubeck Quartet</ref> He returned to college after serving nearly four years in the army, this time attending [[Mills College]] in Oakland. He studied under [[Darius Milhaud]], who encouraged him to study [[fugue]] and [[orchestration]], but not classical piano. While on active duty, he received two lessons from [[Arnold Schoenberg]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in an attempt to connect with [[High modernism|High Modernism]] theory and practice.<ref>Starr, Kevin. 2009. ''Golden dreams: California in an age of abundance, 1950–1963''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> However, the encounter did not end on good terms since Schoenberg believed that every note should be accounted for, an approach which Brubeck could not accept. Although according to his son Chris Brubeck, there is a twelve-tone row in ''The Light in the Wilderness'', Dave Brubeck's first oratorio; in it Jesus's twelve [[Apostle (Christian)|disciples]] were introduced by each singing their own individual notes. It is described as “quite dramatic, especially when Judas starting singing 'Repent' on a high and straining dissonant note.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/my-mentor-my-collaborator-my-father-dave-brubeck/|title=My Mentor, My Collaborator, My Father: Dave Brubeck|author=Chris Brubeck|publisher=Newmusicbox.org|accessdate=2013-07-13}}</ref>

After completing his studies under Milhaud, Brubeck worked with an [[Octet (music)|octet]] (the recording bears his name only because Brubeck was the best-known member at the time), and a [[Trio (music)|trio]] including [[Cal Tjader]] and Ron Crotty. Highly experimental, the group made few recordings and got even fewer paying jobs. The trio was often joined by Paul Desmond on the bandstand, at Desmond's own insistence.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Jack Sheedy owned San Francisco-based Coronet Records, which had previously recorded area [[Dixieland]] bands. (This Coronet Records should not be confused with either the late 1950s New York-based budget label, nor with Australia-based [[Coronet Records]].) In 1949, Sheedy was talked into making the first recording of Brubeck's octet and later his trio. But Sheedy was unable to pay his bills and in 1949 turned his masters over to his record stamping company, the Circle Record Company, owned by Max and Sol Weiss. The Weiss brothers soon changed the name of their business to [[Fantasy Records]].

These initial Brubeck records sold well, and he recorded and issued new records for Fantasy. Soon the company was shipping 40,000 to 50,000 copies of Brubeck records each quarter, making enormous profits.<ref>Gioia, Ted. "Dave Brubeck and Modern Jazz in San Francisco" in ''West Coast Jazz: Modern Jazz in California 1945–1960'', University of California Press, Berkeley, Calif., 1998 (reprint of 1962 edition), pp. 63–64.</ref>

[[File:BrubeckQuartet.JPG|thumb|The quartet in 1959 during the ''Time Out'' sessions. From left to right: Joe Morello, Paul Desmond, Dave Brubeck, Eugene Wright.]]
In 1951, Brubeck damaged several neck vertebrae and his spinal cord while diving into the surf in [[Hawaii]]. He would later remark that the paramedics who attended had described him as a "DOA" (dead on arrival). Brubeck recovered after a few months, but suffered with residual nerve pain in his hands for years after.<ref name=washpost /> The injury also influenced his playing style towards complex, blocky chords rather than speedy, high-dexterity, single-note runs.

Brubeck organized the Dave Brubeck Quartet in 1951, with [[Paul Desmond]] on [[alto saxophone]]. They took up a long residency at San Francisco's [[Black Hawk (nightclub)|Black Hawk nightclub]] and gained great popularity touring [[college campus]]es, recording a series of albums with such titles as ''[[Jazz at Oberlin]]'' (1953), ''[[Jazz at the College of the Pacific]]'' (1953), and Brubeck's debut on [[Columbia Records]], ''[[Jazz Goes to College]]'' (1954).

When Brubeck signed with [[Fantasy Records]], he thought he had a half interest in the company and he worked as a sort of [[Artists and repertoire|A & R]] man for the label, encouraging the Weiss brothers to sign other contemporary jazz performers, including [[Gerry Mulligan]], [[Chet Baker]] and [[Red Norvo]]. When he discovered that all he owned was a half interest in his own recording, he was more than willing to sign with another label, [[Columbia Records]].<ref>"The San Francisco Scene in the 1950s," West Coast Jazz: Modern Jazz in California 1945–1960, Ted Gioia, University of California Press, Berkeley, Calif., 1998 (reprint of 1962 edition), pp. 94–95.</ref>

In 1954, he was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the second jazz musician to be so honored (the first was [[Louis Armstrong]] on February 21, 1949).<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19490221,00.html ''Time'' magazine cover: Louis Armstrong] – February 21, 1949</ref> Brubeck personally found this accolade embarrassing, since he considered [[Duke Ellington]] more deserving of it and was convinced that he had been favored for being Caucasian.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Fred|title=1959: The Year that Changed Everything|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Songs|page=131}}</ref> Ellington himself knocked on the door of Brubeck's hotel room to show him the cover and the only reaction Brubeck could give was, “It should have been you.”<ref>{{cite web| title= Sample Liner Notes by Darius Brubeck| last=

Early bassists for the group included Ron Crotty, [[Bob Bates (musician)|Bob Bates]], and Bob's brother [[Norman Bates (musician)|Norman Bates]]; Lloyd Davis and Joe Dodge held the drum chair. In 1956 Brubeck hired drummer [[Joe Morello]], who had been working with [[Marian McPartland]]; Morello's presence made possible the rhythmic experiments that were to come. In 1958 African-American bassist [[Eugene Wright]] joined for the group's [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] tour of Europe and Asia. Wright became a permanent member in 1959, making the "classic" Quartet's personnel complete. During the late 1950s and early 1960s Brubeck canceled several concerts because the club owners or hall managers continued to resist the idea of an integrated band on their stages. He also canceled a television appearance when he found out that the producers intended to keep Wright off-camera.<ref name=atlantic>{{cite web| title=How Dave Brubeck Used His Talents to Fight for Integration| last=Grabar| first=Henry| date=December 5, 2012| accessdate=December 8, 2012| work=[[The Atlantic Cities]]| url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/arts-and-lifestyle/2012/12/dave-brubecks-real-legacy-integration/4080/}}</ref>

In 1959, the Dave Brubeck Quartet recorded ''[[Time Out (album)|Time Out]]'', an album about which the record label was enthusiastic but which they were nonetheless hesitant to release. Featuring the album art of [[S. Neil Fujita]], the album contained all original compositions, almost none of which were in [[common time]]: 9/8, 5/4, 3/4, and 6/4 were used inspired by Eurasian folk music they experienced during that Department of State sponsored tour.<ref>{{cite book | last=Kaplan | title=1959 | year=2009 | pages=131–132}}</ref> Nonetheless, on the strength of these unusual time signatures (the album included "[[Take Five]]", "[[Blue Rondo à la Turk]]", and "Three To Get Ready"), it quickly went [[platinum album|platinum]]. It was the first jazz album to sell more than a million copies.<ref>{{citation| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/9724992/Dave-Brubeck-Take-Five-jazz-star-dies-91.html| title = Dave Brubeck, Take Five jazz star, dies 91| accessdate = December 5, 2012| work = The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>

''Time Out'' was followed by several albums with a similar approach, including ''[[Time Further Out|Time Further Out: Miro Reflections]]'' (1961), using more 5/4, 6/4, and 9/8, plus the first attempt at 7/4; ''Countdown: Time in Outer Space'' (dedicated to [[John Glenn]]) (1962), featuring 11/4 and more 7/4; ''[[Time Changes]]'' (1963), with much 3/4, 10/4 (which was really 5+5), and 13/4; and ''[[Time In (album)|Time In]]'' (1966).

These albums (except the last) were also known for using contemporary paintings as cover art, featuring the work of [[Joan Miró]] on ''Time Further Out'', [[Franz Kline]] on ''Time in Outer Space'', and [[Sam Francis]] on ''Time Changes''.

A high point for the group was their 1963 live album ''[[At Carnegie Hall]]'', described by critic [[Richard Palmer (entrepreneur)|Richard Palmer]] as "arguably Dave Brubeck's greatest concert".

In the early 1960s, Brubeck and his wife Iola developed a jazz musical, ''[[The Real Ambassadors]]'', based in part on experiences they and their colleagues had during foreign tours on behalf of the Department of State. The soundtrack album, which featured [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Lambert, Hendricks & Ross]], and [[Carmen McRae]] was recorded in 1961; the musical was performed at the 1962 [[Monterey Jazz Festival]].

At its peak in the early 1960s, the Brubeck Quartet was releasing as many as four albums a year. Apart from the "College" and the "Time" series, Brubeck recorded four [[LP album|LPs]] featuring his compositions based on the group's travels, and the local music they encountered. ''Jazz Impressions of the USA'' (1956, Morello's debut with the group), ''Jazz Impressions of Eurasia'' (1958), ''[[Jazz Impressions of Japan]]'' (1964), and ''[[Jazz Impressions of New York]]'' (1964) are less well-known albums, but all are brilliant examples of the quartet's studio work, and they produced Brubeck standards such as "Summer Song," "Brandenburg Gate," "Koto Song," and "Theme From ''[[Mr. Broadway]]''." (Brubeck wrote, and the Quartet performed, the theme song for the [[Craig Stevens (actor)|Craig Stevens]] CBS drama series; the music from the series became material for the "New York" album.)

In 1961, Dave Brubeck appeared in a few scenes of the British jazz/beat film ''[[All Night Long (1962 film)|All Night Long]]'', which starred [[Patrick McGoohan]] and [[Richard Attenborough]]. Brubeck merely plays himself, with the film featuring [[close-up]]s of his piano fingerings. Brubeck performs "It's a Raggy Waltz" from the ''Time Further Out'' album and duets briefly with bassist [[Charles Mingus]] in "Non-Sectarian Blues".

In the early 1960s Dave Brubeck was the program director of WJZZ-FM radio (now [[WEZN-FM]]). He achieved his vision of an all-jazz format radio station along with his friend and neighbor John E. Metts, one of the first African Americans in senior radio management.

The final studio album for Columbia by the Desmond/Wright/Morello quartet was ''Anything Goes'' (1966) featuring the songs of [[Cole Porter]]. A few concert recordings followed, and ''The Last Time We Saw Paris'' (1967) was the "Classic" Quartet's swan-song.

Brubeck's disbanding of the Quartet at the end of 1967 allowed him more time to compose the longer, extended orchestral and choral works that were occupying his attention (to say nothing of his desire to spend more time with his family).{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} February 1968 saw the premiere of ''The Light in the Wilderness'' for [[baritone]] solo, the Miami University A Capella Singers, organ, the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Erich Kunzel]], and Brubeck improvising on certain themes therein. The piece is an [[oratorio]] on Jesus's teachings in the Book of Matthew{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}, and was recorded in March 1968 by Brubeck, the orchestra and choir, and performed by them throughout Europe the following summer.  

The next year, Brubeck produced ''The Gates of Justice'', a [[cantata]] mixing [[Biblical scripture]] with the words of Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] His "Take Five" was used on the soundtrack of the 1973 [[Ralph Bakshi]] adult cartoon movie ''[[Heavy Traffic]]''.

Brubeck believed that what he saw during his time as a soldier in [[World War II]] contradicted the [[Ten Commandments]], and the war evoked a spiritual awakening.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} He became a [[Catholic]] in 1980, shortly after completing the Mass ''To Hope'' which had been commissioned by Ed Murray, editor of the national Catholic weekly ''[[Our Sunday Visitor]]''.

In ''The Daily Telegraph'', music journalist Ivan Hewett wrote: "Brubeck didn’t have the réclame of some jazz musicians who lead tragic lives. He didn’t do drugs or drink.
