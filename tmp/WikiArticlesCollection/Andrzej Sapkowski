'''Andrzej Sapkowski''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈandʐɛj sapˈkɔfskʲi}}; born 21 June 1948 in [[Łódź]]) is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[fantasy]] writer. He is best known for his best-selling book series ''[[The Witcher]]''.

==Biography==
Sapkowski studied economics, and before turning to writing, he had worked as a senior sales representative for a foreign trade company. His first [[short story]], ''[[The Witcher]] ''(''Wiedźmin''), was published in ''[[Fantastyka]]'', Poland's leading fantasy literary magazine, in 1986 and  was enormously successful both with readers and critics. Sapkowski has created a cycle of tales based on the world of ''The Witcher'', comprising three collections of short stories and five [[novel]]s. This cycle and his many other works have made him one of the best-known fantasy authors in Poland in the 1990s.<ref name=mo/>

The main character of ''[[The Witcher]]'' (alternative translations: ''The Hexer'' and ''Spellmaker'') is [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]], a [[mutant]] hunter who has been trained since childhood to hunt down and destroy monsters. Geralt exists in a morally ambiguous universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics. At the same time cynical and noble, Geralt has been compared to [[Raymond Chandler]]'s signature character [[Philip Marlowe]].<ref name=mo>{{pl icon}} Marek Oramus ''[http://archiwum.polityka.pl/art/jedynie-sluszny-wizerunek-wiedzmina,365834.html Jedynie słuszny wizerunek wiedźmina]'',  Polityka – nr 36 (2261) from 2000-09-02; pp. 52–54</ref> The world in which these adventures take place is heavily influenced by [[Slavic mythology]].<ref>''[http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Andrzej-Sapkowski/The-Last-Wish.html The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski ]'', fantasybookreview</ref>

Sapkowski has won five [[Zajdel Award]]s, including three for short stories "Mniejsze zło" (''Lesser Evil'') (1990), "Miecz przeznaczenia" (''Sword of Destiny'') (1992) and "W leju po bombie" (''In a Bomb Crater'') (1993), and two for the novels "[[Krew elfów]]" (''Blood of Elves'') (1994) and "[[Narrenturm (novel)|Narrenturm]]" (2002).  He also won the Spanish [[Ignotus Award]], best anthology, for ''The Last Wish'' in 2003, and for "Muzykanci" (''The Musicians''), best foreign short story, same year.

In 1997, Sapkowski won the prestigious [[Polityka's Passport]] award,<ref name="libraryThing">

The Polish game publisher, CD Projekt, created a role-playing PC game based on this universe, called [[The Witcher (computer game)|The Witcher]], which was released in October 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewitcher.com/community/en/press_releases/18.html|title=The Witcher Official Website – Official Release Date!|accessdate=17 July 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070709103856/http://www.thewitcher.com/community/en/press_releases/18.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 9 July 2007}}</ref> There is also a mobile version of the game which has been created by Breakpoint Games and is being published by [[Hands-On Mobile]]<ref>[http://www.handson.com/ Hands-On Mobile<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in Western Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. The sequel, [[The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings]] was released in 2011.
