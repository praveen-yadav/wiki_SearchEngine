'''Riding shotgun''' refers to the practice of sitting alongside the [[driver (person)|driver]] in a moving [[vehicle]].

The expression "riding shotgun"  is derived from "[[shotgun messenger]]", a colloquial term for "express messenger", in the days of [[stagecoach]] travel the person in the position next to the driver. However, apparently the phrase "riding shotgun" was not coined until 1919.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Gary|title=Riding shotgun|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/riding-shotgun.html|accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref> It was later used in print and especially film depiction of stagecoaches and wagons in the [[Old West]] in danger of being robbed or attacked by [[bandit]]s. A special armed employee of the express service using the stage for transportation of bullion or cash would sit beside the driver, carrying a short [[shotgun]] (or alternatively a [[rifle]]){{citation needed|date=July 2012}}, to provide an armed response in case of threat to the cargo, which was usually a strongbox. Absence of an armed person in that position often signaled that the stage was not carrying a strongbox, but only passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/riding-shotgun.html|title=Riding shotgun|work=phrases.org.uk|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>

More recently, the term has been applied to a [[game]], typically played by groups of friends to determine who rides beside the driver in a car. Typically, this involves claiming the right to ride shotgun by being the first person to call out "shotgun".  There may be other rules involved in the game, such as a requirement that the vehicle be in sight, the person to "say" "Shotgun" must officialize the comment through any form of telecommunications, provided the journey is going to be within the next 24 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bored.com/shotgunguide/index.htm|title=Shotgun Rules|work=bored.com|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Joshua Pearson, Thomas Reuter, William Henderson|url=http://www.shotgunrules.com|title=Official Shotgun Rules|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>

The phrase has been used to mean giving actual or figurative support or aid to someone in a situation or project, i.e. to "watch their back".<ref>{{cite web|work=dictionary.reference.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/shotgun|title= Define Shotgun at Dictionary.com|publisher =Dictionary.com|accessdate=11 February 2013}}</ref>
