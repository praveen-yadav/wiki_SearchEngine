'''Danish''' (''dansk,'' {{IPA-da|d̥anˀsɡ̊|pron|Da-dansk.ogg}}; ''dansk sprog'', {{IPA-da|ˈd̥anˀsɡ̊ ˈsb̥ʁɔʊ̯ˀ|}}) is a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]] spoken by around six [[million]] people, principally in the [[country]] of [[Denmark]] and in the region of [[Southern Schleswig]] in northern [[Germany]], where it holds minority language status.<ref>[http://www.bmi.bund.de/cln_012/nn_164168/Internet/Content/Themen/Minderheiten/DatenundFakten/Daenische__Minderheit__Id__19269__de.html The Federal Ministry of the Interior of Germany] and [http://www.midas-press.org/NR/rdonlyres/1FF1EEC7-7193-4072-81C7-88B33B31FCF2/0/Overview_Germany2007.pdf Minorities in Germany]</ref> There are also significant Danish-speaking communities in [[USA]], [[Canada]] and [[Argentina]].
Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas around 15-20% of the population of [[Greenland]] speaks Danish as their home language.

Danish is largely mutually intelligible with [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Proficient speakers of any of the three languages can understand the others, though studies have shown that speakers of Norwegian generally understand both Danish and Swedish far better than Swedes or Danes understand each other. Both Swedes and Danes also understand Norwegian better than they understand each other's languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forskning.no/Artikler/2004/januar/1073896666.77 |title=> Nordmenn forstår nabospråkene best |publisher=forskning.no |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}</ref>

Along with the other North Germanic languages, Danish is a descendant of [[Old Norse]], the common language of the [[Germanic peoples]] living in Scandinavia during the [[Viking Age|Viking Era]]. Danish, together with Swedish, derives from the East Norse dialect group, while the [[Old Norwegian]] dialects before the influence of Danish and [[Bokmål|Norwegian Bokmål]] is classified as a West Norse language together with [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. A more recent classification based on [[mutual intelligibility]] separates modern spoken Danish, Norwegian and Swedish into a ''Mainland Scandinavian'' group while Icelandic and Faroese are placed in a separate category labelled ''Insular Scandinavian''.

Danish has a relatively large vowel inventory consisting of 16 [[phonemes]] and is distinguished by the many [[pharyngealisation|pharyngealized]] sounds, including both [[vowel]]s and [[consonants]]. Written Danish and Norwegian Bokmål are particularly close, though the [[phonology]] (that is, the system of relationships among the speech sounds that constitute the fundamental components of the language) and the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] (the patterns of stress and intonation) differ somewhat.

Danish is a mandatory subject in school in the [[Danish Realm|Danish dependencies]] of the [[Faroe Islands]] (where it is also an [[official language]] after [[Faroese language|Faroese]]) and [[Greenland]] (where, however, the only official language since 2009 is [[Greenlandic language|Kalaallisut]] and the language{{clarify|date=March 2013}} is now spoken as ''[[lingua franca]]''), as well as the former crown holding of [[Education in Iceland|Iceland]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Danish}}
{{Old Norse language map}}
By the 8th century, the common [[Germanic language]] of [[Scandinavia]], [[Proto-Norse]], had undergone some changes and evolved into [[Old Norse]]. This language began to undergo new changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, which resulted in the appearance of two similar dialects, ''Old West Norse'' ([[Norway]] and [[Iceland]]) and ''Old East Norse'' ([[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]).

Old East Norse is called ''Runic Swedish'' in Sweden and ''Runic Danish'' in East Denmark, but until the 12th century, the dialect was roughly the same in the two countries. The dialects are called ''runic'' because the main body of text appears in the [[runic alphabet]]. Unlike [[Proto-Norse]], which was written with the [[Elder Futhark]] alphabet, Old Norse was written with the [[Younger Futhark]] alphabet, which only had 16 letters. Due to the limited number of runes, some runes were used for a range of [[phoneme]]s, such as the rune for the [[vowel]] ''u'' which was also used for the vowels ''o'', ''ø'' and ''y'', and the rune for ''i'' which was also used for ''e''.

A change that separated Old East Norse (Runic Swedish/Danish) from Old West Norse was the change of the [[diphthong]] ''æi'' (Old West Norse ''ei'') to the [[monophthong]] ''e'', as in ''stæin'' to ''sten''. This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read ''stain'' and the later ''stin''. There was also a change of ''au'' as in ''dauðr'' into ''ø'' as in ''døðr''. This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from ''tauþr'' into ''tuþr''. Moreover, the ''øy'' (Old West Norse ''ey'') diphthong changed into ''ø'' as well, as in the Old Norse word for "island".

Famous authors of works in Danish are [[existentialism|existential]] [[philosopher]] [[Søren Kierkegaard]], prolific [[fairy tale]] author [[Hans Christian Andersen]], and playwright [[Ludvig Holberg]]. Three 20th century Danish authors have become [[Nobel Prize]] laureates in [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Literature]]: [[Karl Adolph Gjellerup]] and [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (joint recipients in 1917) and [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen]] (awarded 1944).

Old East Norse was once widely spoken in the northeast counties of England. Many words derived from Norse, such as "gate" (gade) for street, still survive in [[Yorkshire]] and the East Midlands [[Danelaw|(parts of eastern England)]] colonized by Danish [[Vikings]]. The city of [[York]] was once the Viking settlement of Jorvik. Several other English words also derive from Old East Norse, for example, "knife" (kniv), "husband" (husbond), and "egg" (æg).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viking.no/e/england/e-pl-england.htm |title=Viking place names and language in England |publisher=Viking.no |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref> The suffix "-by" for 'town' is common in place names in Yorkshire and the East Midlands that is, Selby, Whitby, Derby and Grimsby. The word dale in Yorkshire and Derbyshire is commonly used in place of valley.

The first printed book in Danish dates from 1495. The first complete translation of the [[Bible]] in Danish was published in October 1550.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Geographical distribution==
Danish is the national language of [[Denmark]] and one of two official languages of the [[Faroe Islands]] (alongside [[Faroese language|Faroese]]). Until 2009, it had also been one of two official languages of [[Greenland]] (alongside [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]]). Danish is widely spoken in Greenland now as ''lingua franca'', and an unknown portion of the native Greenlandic population has Danish as their first language; nearly all of the native Greenlandic population speak Danish as a second language since its introduction into the education system as a compulsory language in 1928. Danish was an official language in [[Iceland]] until 1944 but is today still widely used and is a mandatory subject in school.<ref>^ http://www.icelandexport.is/english/about_iceland/icelandic_language/ "Icelandic Language". Iceland Trade Directory. icelandexport.is. Retrieved 5 November 2012.</ref> In addition, there is a noticeable community of Danish speakers in [[Southern Schleswig]], the portion of [[Germany]] bordering Denmark, where it is an officially recognised [[regional language]], just as [[German language|German]] is north of the border. Furthermore, Danish is one of the official languages of the [[European Union]] and one of the working languages of the [[Nordic Council]].<ref name=norden>{{cite web|title=Nordic language co-operation|url=http://www.norden.org/en/about-nordic-co-operation/areas-of-co-operation/language/nordic-language-co-operation|publisher=Nordic Council|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> Under the [[Nordic Language Convention]], Danish-speaking citizens of the [[Nordic countries]] have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable for any [[interpreting|interpretation]] or [[translation]] costs.<ref name=norden />

The more widespread of the two varieties of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Bokmål]], is a [[daughter language]] of Danish. Until 1814, Danish was the official language of Norway. Bokmål is based on Danish unlike the other variety of Norwegian, [[Nynorsk]], which is based on the Norwegian dialects, with [[Old Norwegian]] as an important reference point. From a linguistic point of view, Bokmål and Danish are the same language.<ref>[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Sprog/Norsk/bokm%C3%A5l. In danish]</ref>

There is no law stipulating an official language for Denmark, making Danish the [[de facto]] language only. The Code of Civil Procedure does, however, lay down Danish as the language of the courts. Since 1997 public authorities have been obliged to observe the official spelling by way of the Orthography Law.

==Dialects==
[[File:Danishdialectmap.png|thumb|right|250px|Map of Danish dialects]]
Standard Danish (''rigsdansk'') is the language based on dialects spoken in and around the capital, [[Copenhagen]]. Unlike Swedish and Norwegian, Danish does not have more than one regional speech norm. More than 25% of all Danish speakers live in the metropolitan area of the capital, and most government agencies, institutions, and major businesses keep their main offices in Copenhagen, something that has resulted in a very homogeneous national speech norm. In contrast, though [[Oslo]] (Norway) and [[Stockholm]] (Sweden) are quite dominant in terms of speech standards, cities like [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], [[Gothenburg]] and the [[Malmö]]-[[Lund]] region are large and influential enough to create secondary regional norms, making the standard language more varied than is the case with Danish. The general agreement is that Standard Danish is based on a form of Copenhagen dialect, but the specific norm, as with most language norms, is difficult to pinpoint for both laypeople and scholars. Historically Standard Danish emerged as a compromise between the dialect of Zealand and [[Scanian dialects|Scania]]. The first layers of it can be seen in east Danish provincial law texts such as [[Scanian Law|Skånske Lov]], just as we can recognize west Danish in laws from the same ages in [[Jyske Lov]].

Despite the relative cultural monopoly of the capital and the centralized government, the divided geography of the country allowed distinct rural dialects to flourish during the centuries. Such "genuine" [[dialect]]s were formerly spoken by a vast majority of the population, but have declined much since the 1960s. They still exist in communities out in the countryside, but most speakers in these areas generally speak a regionalized form of Standard Danish, when speaking with one who speaks to them in that same standard. Usually an adaptation of the local dialect to ''rigsdansk'' is spoken, though [[code-switching]] between the standard-like norm and a distinct dialect is common.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kodeskift |url=http://dialekt.dk/kodeskift/ |date= |work= |publisher=Dialekt.dk |language=Danish |accessdate=16 July 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Denmark-gender.png|thumb|right|The distribution of one, two, and three grammatical genders in Danish dialects. In Zealand the transition from three to two genders has happened fairly recently. West of the red line the definite article goes before the word as in English or German; east of the line it takes the form of a suffix.]]

Danish is divided into three distinct dialect groups,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dialekt.dk/dialekter/ |title=Dialekt.dk |publisher=Dialekt.dk |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}</ref> which are further subdivided in about 30 ''dialektområder'':<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dialekt.ku.dk/dialekter/dialektomraader/dialektomraader/ |title=Kort over dialektområder – Københavns Universitet |publisher=Dialekt.ku.dk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref>

* [[Insular Danish]] (''ømål''), including dialects of the [[Danish islands]] of Zealand, Funen, Lolland, Falster, and Møn
* [[Jutlandic]] (''jysk''), further divided in North, East, West and [[South Jutlandic]]
* [[Bornholmsk dialect]] (''Bornholmian'') the dialect of the island of [[Bornholm]]

The term ''Eastern Danish''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Sprog/Dansk/danske_dialekter |title=danske dialekter &#124; Gyldendal - Den Store Danske |language= {{da icon}} |publisher=Denstoredanske.dk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref> is occasionally used for Bornholmian, but including the dialects of [[Scanian dialects|Scania]] (particularly in a historical context). The background for this lies in the loss of the originally Danish provinces of [[Blekinge]], [[Halland]] and [[Scania]] to Sweden in 1658. The island of Bornholm in the [[Baltic Sea]] also belongs to this group, but returned to Danish rule in 1660. This means that the spoken language in this part of Sweden is descended from a regional variant of Danish, while the written language used is standard Swedish, which evolved in Uppsala and Stockholm. Similarly, the Norwegian language is classified as a descendant of [[West Norse]], while the [[Bokmål|written language]] used by the vast majority in Norway is derived from an older variant of standard Danish. A few generations ago, the classical dialects spoken in the southern Swedish provinces could still be argued to be more Eastern Danish than Swedish, being similar to the dialect of Bornholm. Today, influx of Standard Swedish and Standard Danish vocabulary has generally meant that [[Scanian dialects|Scanian]] and Bornholmian are closer to the modern national standards of their respective host nations than to each other. The Bornholmian dialect has also maintained to this day many ancient features, such as a distinction between three [[grammatical gender]]s, which the central Insular Danish dialects gave up during the 20th century. Standard Danish has two genders and the definite form of nouns is formed by the use of [[suffix]]es, while Western Jutlandic has only one gender and the definite form of nouns uses an article before the noun itself, in the same fashion as [[West Germanic languages]].
Today, Standard Danish is most similar to the Insular Danish dialect group.

==Sound system==
{{Main|Danish phonology}}

The sound system of Danish is in many ways unusual among the world's languages. From the perspective of the written language, the spoken is quite prone to considerable reduction and [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of both consonants and vowels even in very formal standard language. A rare feature is the presence of a prosodic feature called ''[[stød]]'' in Danish (lit. "push; thrust"). This is a form of laryngealization or [[creaky voice]], only occasionally realized as a full [[glottal stop]] (especially in emphatic pronunciation). It can be the only distinguishing feature between certain words, thus creating [[minimal pair]]s (for example, ''bønder'' "peasants" with stød versus ''bønner'' "beans" or "prayers" without). The distribution of stød in the lexicon is clearly related to the distribution of the common Scandinavian [[pitch accent]]s found in most dialects of [[Norwegian phonology#Accent|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish phonology#Stress and pitch|Swedish]], including the national [[standard language]]s. Most linguists today believe that stød is a development of the word accents, rather than the other way round.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Some{{Who|date=June 2012}} have theorized it emerged from the overwhelming influence of [[Low German]] in medieval times, having flattened the originally Nordic melodic accent, but stød is absent in most southern Danish dialects where Low German impact would have been the greatest. Stød generally occurs in words that have "accent 1" in Swedish and Norwegian and that were monosyllabic in [[Old Norse]], while no-stød occurs in words that have "accent 2" in Swedish and Norwegian and that were polysyllabic in Old Norse.

Unlike the neighboring Continental Scandinavian languages, the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of Danish does not have phonemic pitch. [[stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is phonemic and distinguishes words
such as ''billigst'' {{IPA|[ˈbilist]}} "cheapest" and ''bilist'' {{IPA|[biˈlist]}} "car driver".

===Vowels===
In most modern variants of Danish, it is possible to distinguish at least 17 different vowel qualities in distinct pronunciation. The table below shows the approximate distribution of the vowels as pronounced in Modern Standard Danish, and the symbol used in [[Wikipedia:IPA for Danish|IPA for Danish]].

All but four of these vowels may be either long or short, the exceptions being {{IPA|[a]}}, {{IPA|[ʌ]}}, {{IPA|[ə]}} and {{IPA|[ɐ]}} which are always short. {{IPA|[ə]}} and {{IPA|[ɐ]}} occur only in unstressed syllables.

The many different vowels can be analyzed to represent ten distinctive [[Phoneme|vowel phonemes]]: {{IPA|/i e ɛ a y ø œ u o ɔ/}}, and {{IPA|/ə/}} that only occurs in unstressed syllables. These phonemes often have different [[allophones]] depending on length, and in conjunction with {{IPA|/r/}}. For example, {{IPA|/ø/}} is lowered when it occurs either before or after {{IPA|/r/}}, and {{IPA|/a/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[æ]}} when it is long.

===Consonants===
In distinct pronunciation it is possible to distinguish at least 21 consonants in most variants of Danish:

These consonants can be analyzed to represent 15 [[phoneme]]s: {{IPA|/m n p t k b d ɡ f s h v j r l/}}. Many of these phonemes have quite different [[allophone]]s in [[Syllable onset|onset]] and [[Syllable coda|coda]]. {{IPA|/p t k/}} are aspirated in onset, not in coda. {{IPA|/d ɡ v j r/}} are [[contoid]] in onset and [[vocoid]] in coda.

{{IPA|[ʋ, ð]}} often have slight frication, but are usually pronounced as [[approximant]]s.

{{IPA|[ɕ]}} occurs only after {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/t/}}. Since {{IPA|[j]}} doesn't occur after these phonemes, {{IPA|[ɕ]}} can be analyzed as {{IPA|/j/}}, which is devoiced after voiceless alveolar frication. This makes it unnecessary to postulate a {{IPA|/ɕ/}}-phoneme in Danish.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Grønnum|2005|pp=305–306}}</ref>

In onset {{IPA|/r/}} is realized as a [[voiced uvular fricative|uvular approximant]], {{IPA|[ʁ]}}, but in coda it is either realized as a non-syllabic [[near-open central vowel|low central vowel]], {{IPA|[ɐ̯]}} (which is almost identical to how {{IPA|/r/}} is often pronounced in syllable-final position in [[German language|German]]) or simply coalesces with the preceding vowel. The phenomenon is also comparable to [[non-rhotic]] pronunciations of English. The Danish pronunciation of {{IPA|/r/}} distinguishes the language from those varieties of Norwegian and Swedish that use trilled {{IPA|[r]}}, and makes it sound to speakers of those languages as if Danes speak with a German accent.{{cn|date=July 2013}}

==Grammar==
{{Main|Danish grammar}}

The infinitive forms of Danish verbs end in a vowel, which in almost all cases is a schwa, represented in writing by the letter ''e''. Verbs are conjugated according to [[Grammatical tense|tense]], but otherwise do not vary according to [[Grammatical person|person]] or [[Grammatical number|number]]. For example the present tense form of the Danish infinitive verb ''spise'' ("to eat") is ''spiser''; this form is the same regardless of whether the subject is in the first, second, or third person, or whether it is singular or plural. This extreme ease of conjugating verbs is compensated by the large number of [[irregular verb]]s in the language.

Standard Danish nouns fall into only two grammatical genders: ''common'' and ''neuter'', while some dialects still often have ''masculine'', ''feminine'' and ''neuter''. While the majority of Danish nouns (ca. 75%) have the ''common'' gender, and ''neuter'' is often used for inanimate objects, the genders of nouns are not generally predictable and must in most cases be memorized. A distinctive feature of the Scandinavian languages, including Danish, is an [[enclitic]] definite article.
To demonstrate: The ''common'' gender word "a man" (indefinite) is ''en mand'' but "the man" (definite) is ''manden''. The ''neuter'' equivalent would be "a house" (indefinite) ''et hus'', "the house" (definite) ''huset''. Even though the definite and indefinite articles have separate origins, {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} they have become homographs in Danish. In the plural, the definite article is ''-(e)ne'', as the plural endings are ''- / -e / -er''. The enclitic article is not used when an adjective is added to the noun; here the demonstrative pronoun is used instead: ''den store mand'' "the big man", "the big house", ''det store hus''.

Like most Germanic languages, Danish joins compound nouns. The example ''kvindehåndboldlandsholdet'', "the female national handball team", illustrates that it does so to a significantly higher degree than [[English language|English]]. In some cases, nouns are joined with an extra ''s'', originally possessive in function, like ''landsmand'' (from ''land'', "country", and ''mand'', "man", meaning "compatriot"), but ''landmand'' (from same roots, meaning "farmer"). Some words are joined with an extra ''e'', like ''gæstebog'' (from ''gæst'' and ''bog'', meaning "guest book").

==Vocabulary==
The majority of Danish words are derived from the [[Old Norse language]]. However, 35-40% of Danish words hail from [[Middle Low German]] and were borrowed in the [[late medieval]] era (explaining the relative similarity of its vocabulary with modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]]), for example, ''betale'' (to pay). In the 17th and 18th Centuries [[German language|standard German]] and [[French language|French]]  superseded Low German influence and in the 20th Century English became the main supplier of loan words – especially after [[World War II]]. Although many old Nordic words remain, some were replaced with borrowed synonyms, such as can be seen with ''æde'' (to eat) which became less common when the Low German ''spise'' came into fashion. Besides borrowing new words are typically formed by compounding existing words.

Because of the shared history between Danish and English — both are Germanic languages and Danish exerted a strong influence on Old English in the early medieval period — many common words are very similar in the two languages. For example, Danish words for commonly used nouns and prepositions are easily recognizable in their written form to English speakers, such as ''have'', ''over'', ''under'', ''for'', ''give'', ''flag,'' ''salt,'' and ''kat''. However, when pronounced, most of these words sound quite different from their English equivalents; not so much due to the [[Great Vowel Shift]] of English, as Danish ''a'' and ''e'' were affected similarly, but due to the Danish tendency to slur soft consonants such as ''d'', ''g'', and ''v'' (resulting in what sounds to English ears as ''ha'e'', ''o'er'', ''un'er'', ''gi'e'', and ''flay''). Similarly, some other words are almost identical to their [[Scots language|Scottish]] equivalents, e.g., ''kirke'' (Scottish ''kirk'', i.e. 'church') or ''barn'' (Scottish ''bairn'', i.e. 'child'). In addition, the word ''by'', meaning "village" or "town", occurs in many English place-names, such as ''Whitby'' and ''Selby'', as remnants of the [[Danelaw|Viking occupation]]. During the latter period, English adopted "are", the third person plural form of the verb "to be", as well as the corresponding personal pronoun form "they" from contemporary Danish.

===Numerals{{anchor|Numerals}}===<!-- This section is linked from [[Numeral system]] (well, not any more, actually)-->
In the word forms of numbers above 20, the units are stated before the tens, such that 21 is rendered ''enogtyve'', literally  "one and twenty". Similar constructions are found in [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], certain [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and [[Arabic#Numerals|Arabic]] as well as in archaic and dialect English (compare the line "[[Sing a Song of Sixpence|''Four-and-twenty'' blackbirds"]] in the old nursery rhyme.)

The numeral ''halvanden'' means 1½ (literally "half second", implying "one plus half of the second one"). The numerals ''halvtredje'' (2½) and ''halvfjerde'' (3½) are obsolete, but still implicitly used in the [[vigesimal]] system described below. Similarly, the [[time|temporal designation]] ''klokken halv tre'', literally "half three o'clock", is half past two o'clock.

One peculiar feature of the Danish language is the fact that numerals 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 are (somewhat like the [[French language|French]] numerals from 80 through 99) based on a [[vigesimal]] system, formerly also used in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. This means that the [[20 (number)|score]] is used as a base unit in counting: ''Tres'' (short for ''tre-sinds-tyve'' meaning "three times twenty") means sixty, while ''halvtreds'' (short for ''halvtredje-sinds-tyve'' meaning "half third times twenty", implying two score plus half of the third score) is fifty. The [[suffix|ending]] ''sindstyve'' meaning "times twenty" is no longer included in [[cardinal number]]s, but still used in [[ordinal number]]s. Thus, in modern Danish fifty-two is usually rendered as ''tooghalvtreds'' from the now obsolete ''tooghalvtredsindstyve'', whereas 52nd is either ''tooghalvtredsende'' or ''tooghalvtredsindstyvende''. Twenty is called ''tyve'' (derived from old Danish ''tiughu'', a [[haplology]] of ''tuttiughu'', meaning 'two tens'<ref name="ODS">[http://ordnet.dk/ods/ordbog?select=tyve,4&query=tyve] Ordbog over det danske sprog]</ref>), while thirty is ''tredive'' (derived from old Danish ''þrjatiughu'' meaning 'three tens'), and forty is called ''fyrre'' (derived from the old Danish ''fyritiughu'' meaning 'four tens'<ref name="dsnfaq">[http://dsn.dk/sproghjaelp/ofte-stillede-spoergsmaal/de-danske-tal-halvtreds-tres-halvfjerds-firs-og-halvfems {{Language icon|da}} Dansk sprognævn – De danske tal halvtreds, tres, halvfjerds, firs og halvfems]</ref> via ''fyrretyve'', still occasionally used in historical settings or for humorous effect). An exception to the way Danish numbers are formed is in writing cheques and legal amounts in banking, where traditionally the numbers are 10-based and spelled as they appear in numerical form; thus, ''fir(e)ti'' is forty (4 times 10) and ''seksti-to'' is sixty-two (6 times 10 plus 2).

For large numbers (one billion or larger), Danish uses the [[Long and short scales|long scale]], so that for example, one U.S. billion (1,000,000,000) is called ''milliard'', and one U.S. trillion (1,000,000,000,000) is ''billion''.

==Writing system==<!-- This section is linked from [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger]] -->
The oldest preserved examples of written Danish (from the Iron and Viking Ages) are in the [[Runic alphabet]]. The introduction of [[Christianity]] also brought the [[Latin script]] to Denmark, and at the end of the [[High Middle Ages]] the Runes had more or less been replaced by the Latin letters.

As in [[Germany]], the [[Fraktur (typeface sub-classification)|Fraktur]] (blackletter) types were still commonly used in the late 19th century (until 1875, Danish children were taught to read Fraktur letters in school), and many books were printed with Fraktur typesetting even in the beginning of the 20th century, particularly by conservatives. However, the Latin script was used by modernists, for example, the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] changed style in 1799. Nouns were capitalized, as in German, until the 1948 spelling reform.

The modern Danish alphabet is similar to the English one, with three additional letters: ''[[æ]]'', ''[[ø]]'', and ''[[å]]'', which come at the end of the [[Danish alphabet|alphabet]], in that order. A [[spelling reform]] in 1948 introduced the letter ''å'', already in use in Norwegian and Swedish, into the Danish alphabet to replace the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''aa''; the old usage still occurs in some personal and [[geographical name]]s (for example, the name of the city of ''[[Aalborg]]'' is spelled with Aa following a decision by the City Council in the 1970s). When representing the ''å'' sound, ''aa'' is treated just like ''å'' in [[collating|alphabetical sorting]], even though it looks like two letters. When the letters are not available due to technical limitations (e.g., in URLs), they are often replaced by ''ae'' (Æ, æ), ''oe'' or ''o'' (Ø, ø), and ''aa'' (Å, å), respectively.

The same spelling reform changed the spelling of a few common words, such as the past tense ''vilde'' (would), ''kunde'' (could) and ''skulde'' (should), to their current forms of ''ville'', ''kunne'' and ''skulle'' (making them identical to the infinitives in writing, as they are in speech), and did away with the practice of capitalizing all nouns, which is still done in [[German language|German]]. Modern Danish and Norwegian use the same alphabet, though spelling differs slightly.
