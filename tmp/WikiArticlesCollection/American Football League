The '''American Football League''' ('''AFL''') was a major  American [[Professional Football]] league that operated from 1960 until 1969, when it merged with the [[National Football League]] (NFL).  The upstart AFL operated in direct competition with the more established NFL throughout its existence.

The AFL was created by a number of owners who had been refused NFL expansion franchises or had minor shares of NFL franchises.  The AFL's original lineup saw an Eastern division of the [[New York Jets|New York Titans]], [[Boston Patriots]], [[Buffalo Bills]] and the [[Houston Oilers]] along with a Western division of the [[Los Angeles Chargers]], [[Denver Broncos]], [[Oakland Raiders]], and [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]].  The league first gained attention by signing 75% of the [[1960 NFL Draft|NFL's first-round draft choices in 1960]], including Houston's successful signing of All-American [[Billy Cannon]].

While the first years of the AFL saw uneven competition and low attendance, the league was buttressed by a generous television contract with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (followed by a contract for with [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] for games starting with the 1965 season) that broadcast the more offense oriented football league nationwide.  Continuing to attract top talent from colleges and the NFL by the mid-1960s, as well as successful franchise shifts to [[San Diego]] (from LA) and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (from Dallas), the AFL established a dedicated following.  The transformation of the lowly Titans into the [[New York Jets]] under new ownership further solidified the league's reputation amongst the major media.

As fierce competition made player salaries skyrocket in both leagues, especially after a series of "raids," the leagues agreed to a [[AFL-NFL merger|merger in 1966]].  Among the conditions was a common draft and a championship game played between the two league champions, which would eventually become the [[Super Bowl]].

The AFL and NFL operated as separate leagues until 1970, with separate regular season and playoff schedules except for the championship game. During this time the AFL added the [[Miami Dolphins]] and [[Cincinnati Bengals]].  After losses by Kansas City and Oakland in the first two AFL-NFL Championship Games to the [[Green Bay Packers]], the [[New York Jets]] and [[Kansas City Chiefs]] won Super Bowls III and IV, cementing the league's claim to being an equal to the NFL.

In 1970, the AFL was absorbed into the NFL, and the ten AFL franchises along with the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]], [[Cleveland Browns]], and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] became the [[American Football Conference]].

==League history==
During the 1950s, the [[National Football League]] had grown to rival [[Major League Baseball]] as one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the United States. One franchise that did not share in this newfound success of the league was the [[Arizona Cardinals|Chicago Cardinals]], owned by the Bidwill family, who had become overshadowed by the more popular [[Chicago Bears]]. The Bidwills hoped to relocate their franchise, preferably to [[St. Louis]] but could not come to terms with the league on a relocation fee. Needing cash, the Bidwills began entertaining offers from would-be investors, and one of the men who approached the Bidwills was [[Lamar Hunt]], son and heir of [[Texas]] millionaire oilman [[H. L. Hunt]].<ref>Gruver, ''The American Football League'', p. 9.</ref> Hunt offered to buy the Cardinals and move them to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], where he had grown up. However, these negotiations came to nothing, since the Bidwills insisted on retaining a controlling interest in the franchise and were unwilling to move their team to a city where a [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|previous NFL franchise]] had failed in [[1952 NFL season|1952]]. While Hunt negotiated with Bidwills, similar offers were made by [[Bud Adams]], [[Bob Howsam]], and [[Max Winter]].<ref>Gruver, ''The American Football League'', p. 13.</ref>

When Hunt, Adams, and Howsam were unable to secure a controlling interest in the Chicago Cardinals, they approached NFL commissioner [[Bert Bell]] and proposed the addition of [[expansion team]]s. Bell, wary of expanding the 12-team league and risking its newfound success, rejected the offer.<ref>Gruver, ''The American Football League'', pp. 13–14.</ref> On his return flight to Dallas, Hunt conceived the idea of an entirely new league and decided to contact the others who had shown interest in purchasing the Cardinals. He contacted Adams, Howsam, and Winter (as well as Winter's business partner, Bill Boyer) to gauge their interest in starting a new league. Hunt's first meeting with Adams was held in March 1959.<ref>Gruver, ''The American Football League'', p. 14.</ref> Hunt, who felt a regional rivalry would be critical for the success of the new league, convinced Adams to join and found his team in [[Houston]]. Hunt next secured an agreement from Howsam to bring a team to [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].<ref>Gruver, ''The American Football League'', pp. 15–16.</ref>

After Winter and Boyer agreed to start a team in [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], the new league had its first four teams. Hunt then approached Willard Rhodes, who hoped to bring pro football to [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. However, the [[University of Washington]] was unwilling to let the fledgling league use [[Husky Stadium]], probably due to the excessive wear and tear that would have caused to the facility's grass surface.  With no place for his team to play, Rhodes' effort came to nothing.<ref>Miller, ''Going Long'', pp. 3–4.</ref> Hunt also sought franchises in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] and [[New York City]]. During the summer of 1959 he sought the blessings of the NFL for his nascent league, as he did not seek a potentially costly rivalry. Within weeks of the July 1959 announcement of the league's formation, Hunt received commitments from [[Barron Hilton]] and [[Harry Wismer]] to bring teams to Los Angeles and New York, respectively.<ref name="chiefsafl">{{cite web |url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/ |title=Kansas City Chiefs History - AFL Origins |accessdate=2007-02-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070205213037/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-05}}</ref>

On August 14, 1959, the first league meeting was held in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and charter memberships were given to Dallas, New York, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis-Saint Paul. On August 22 the league officially was named the American Football League. The NFL's initial reaction was not as openly hostile as it had been with the earlier [[All-America Football Conference]] (Bell had even given his public approval), yet individual NFL owners soon began a campaign to undermine the new league. AFL owners were approached with promises of new NFL franchises or ownership stakes in existing ones. Only the party from Minneapolis accepted, and the Minnesota group joined the NFL the next year in 1961; the Minneapolis group joined [[Ole Haugsrud]] in the new NFL team's ownership group, with Haugsrud dubbing the team the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. The older league also announced on August 29 that it had conveniently reversed its position against expansion, and planned to bring NFL expansion teams to Houston and Dallas, to start play in 1961.<ref>Gruver, ''The American Football League'', pp. 22–23.</ref> (The NFL did not expand to Houston at that time, the promised Dallas team &ndash; the [[Dallas Cowboys]] &ndash; actually started play in 1960, and the Vikings began play in 1961.) Finally, the NFL quickly came to terms with the Bidwills and allowed them to relocate the struggling Cardinals to St. Louis, eliminating that city as a potential AFL market.

Two more cities were awarded AFL franchises later in the year. [[Ralph C. Wilson, Jr.|Ralph Wilson]], who owned a minority interest in the NFL's [[Detroit Lions]], announced he was placing a team in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York]] after he had been rejected by [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]. Buffalo was officially awarded a franchise on October 28. During a league meeting on November 22, a 10-man ownership group from [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] (led by [[Billy Sullivan (American football)|Billy Sullivan]]) was awarded the AFL's eighth team.<ref>Maiorana, ''Relentless'', p. 65.</ref> On November 30, 1959, [[Joe Foss]], a [[World War II]] [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[fighter ace]] and former governor of [[South Dakota]], was named the AFL's first commissioner. Foss commissioned a friend of Harry Wismer's to develop the AFL's eagle-on-football logo. Hunt was elected President of the AFL on January 26, 1960.

===The AFL Draft===
{{further|American Football League Draft}}

The AFL's first [[American Football League Draft|draft]] took place the same day Boston was awarded its franchise, and lasted 33 rounds. The league held a second draft on December 2, which lasted for 20 rounds. Because the Raiders joined after the AFL draft, they inherited Minnesota's selections (read next section).<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', pp. 7–8.</ref><ref name="nflhistoryone">{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1951-1960 |title=NFL History, 1951–1960 |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=NFL.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070209180120/http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1951-1960| archivedate= 9 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> A special ''[[1960 American Football League Draft|allocation draft]]'' was held in January, 1960, to allow the Raiders to stock their team, as some of the other AFL teams had already signed some of Minneapolis' original draft choices.

===Crisis and success (1960–61)===
In November 1959, Minneapolis owner Max Winter announced his intent to leave the AFL to accept a franchise offer from the NFL. In 1961, his team began play in the NFL as the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. [[San Diego Chargers|Los Angeles Chargers]] owner Barron Hilton demanded that a replacement for Minnesota be placed in California, to reduce his team's operating costs and to create a rivalry. After a brief search, [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] was chosen and an ownership group led by local real estate developer Chet Soda was formed. After initially being called the Oakland ''"Señores"'', the [[Oakland Raiders]] officially joined the AFL on January 30, 1960.

The AFL's first major success came when the [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]] signed [[Billy Cannon]], the All-American and 1959 [[Heisman Trophy]] winner from [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]]. Cannon signed a $100,000 contract to play for the Oilers, despite having already signed a $50,000 contract with the NFL's [[St. Louis Rams|Los Angeles Rams]]. The Oilers filed suit and claimed that Rams general manager [[Pete Rozelle]] had unduly manipulated Cannon. The court upheld the Houston contract, and with Cannon the Oilers appeared in the AFL's first three championship games (winning two).<ref name="loup">{{cite news |first=Rich |last=Loup |title=The AFL: A Football Legacy (Part One) |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_1/ |publisher=CNNSI.com |date=2001-01-22 |accessdate=2007-02-08 }}</ref><ref name="cannon">{{cite news |first=Al |last=Carter |title=Oilers leave rich legacy of low-budget absurdity |url=http://texnews.com/texsports97/oilers063097.html |publisher=''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' |date=1997-06-30 |accessdate=2007-02-08 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070106015329/http://texnews.com/texsports97/oilers063097.html| archivedate= 6 January 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

On June 9, 1960, the league signed a five-year television contract with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], which brought in revenues of approximately [[United States dollar|$]]2,125,000 per year for the entire league. On June 17, the AFL filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL, which was dismissed in 1962 after a two-month trial.<ref name="loup" /> The AFL began regular-season play (a night game on Friday, September 9, 1960) with eight teams in the league — the [[New England Patriots|Boston Patriots]], [[Buffalo Bills]], [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]], [[Denver Broncos]], [[Houston Oilers]], [[San Diego Chargers|Los Angeles Chargers]], [[New York Jets|New York Titans]], and [[Oakland Raiders]]. Raiders' co-owner [[F. Wayne Valley|Wayne Valley]] dubbed the AFL ownership "The Foolish Club," a term Lamar Hunt subsequently used on team photographs he sent as Christmas gifts.<ref name="herskowitz">{{cite news |first=Mickey |last=Herskowitz |title=The Foolish Club |url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/media/misc/5_the_foolish_club.pdf |publisher=Pro Football Weekly |year=1974 |accessdate=2007-02-08 |format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070605071618/http://www.kcchiefs.com/media/misc/5_the_foolish_club.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-05}}</ref>

The Oilers became the first-ever league champions by defeating the Chargers, 24–16, in the AFL Championship on January 1, 1961. Attendance for the 1960 season was respectable for a new league, but not nearly that of the NFL. Whereas the more popular NFL teams in 1960 regularly saw attendance figures in excess of 50,000 per game, AFL attendance generally hovered between 10,000-20,000 per game.<ref name="attendance">{{cite web |url=http://nflhistory.net/linescores/pdf/1960a.pdf |title=1960 AFL box scores |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=The NFL History Network|format=PDF}}</ref> With the low attendance came financial losses. The Raiders, for instance, lost $500,000 in their first year and only survived after receiving a $400,000 loan from Bills owner Ralph Wilson.<ref name="dvd">{{cite video |people=[[Steve Sabol]] (Executive Producer) |date=2004 |title=Raiders - The Complete History |medium=DVD |publisher=NFL Productions LLC}}</ref> In an early sign of stability, however, the AFL did not lose any teams after its first year of operation. In fact, the only major change was the relocation of the Chargers from Los Angeles to nearby [[San Diego, California|San Diego]].

On August 8, 1961, the AFL, challenged the [[Canadian Football League]] to an exhibition game that would feature the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] and the [[Buffalo Bills]].  Playing at [[Ivor Wynne Stadium]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario]], the Ticats defeated the Bills 38–21 playing a mix of AFL and CFL rules.

===Movement and instability (1962–63)===
While the Oilers found instant success in the AFL, other teams did not fare as well. The Oakland Raiders and New York Titans struggled on and off the field during their first few seasons in the league. Oakland's eight-man ownership group was reduced to just three in 1961, after heavy financial losses their first season.<ref name="nflhistorytwo">{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1961-1970 |title=NFL History, 1961–1970 |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=NFL.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070205052436/http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1961-1970| archivedate= 5 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Attendance for home games was poor, partly due to the team playing in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]—which already had an established NFL team (the [[San Francisco 49ers]])—but the product on the field was also to blame. After winning six games their debut season, the Raiders won a total of three times in the 1961 and 1962 seasons. Oakland took part in a 1961 supplemental draft meant to boost the weaker teams in the league, but it did little good. They participated in another such draft in 1962.<ref name="loup" />

The Titans fared a little better on the field but had their own financial troubles. Attendance was so low for home games that team owner Harry Wismer had fans move to seats closer to the field to give the illusion of a fuller stadium on television.<ref name="jetsencyc">{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/nyj/jets.html |title=New York Jets history |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=Sports Encyclopedia| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070210123412/http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/nyj/jets.html| archivedate= 10 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Eventually Wismer could no longer afford to meet his payroll, and on November 8, 1962 the AFL took over operations of the team. The Titans were sold to a five-person ownership group headed by [[Sonny Werblin]] on March 28, 1963, and in April the new owners changed the team's name to the [[New York Jets]].<ref name="jetsone">{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history?year=1962 |title=Jets history - 1962 |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=NewYorkJets.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061114025135/http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history?year=1962 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-11-14}}</ref><ref name="jetstwo">{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history?year=1963 |title=Jets history - 1963 |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=NewYorkJets.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061114025303/http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history?year=1963 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-11-14}}</ref>

The Raiders and Titans both finished last in their respective divisions in the 1962 season.<ref name="sixtytwo">{{cite web |url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1962.htm |title=1962 standings |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=Pro-Football-Reference.com | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070207123656/http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1962.htm| archivedate= 7 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The Texans and Oilers, winners of their divisions, faced each other for the 1962 AFL Championship on December 23. The Texans dethroned the two-time champion Oilers, 20–17, in a double-[[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] contest that was, at the time, Professional Football's longest-ever game.<ref name="loup" />

In 1963, the Texans became the second AFL team to relocate. Lamar Hunt felt that despite winning the league championship in 1962, the Texans could not succeed financially competing in the same market as the [[Dallas Cowboys]], which entered the NFL as an expansion franchise in 1960. After meetings with [[New Orleans]], [[Atlanta]] and [[Miami]], Hunt announced on May 22 that the Texans' new home would be [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]]. Kansas City mayor [[Harold Roe Bartle]] (nicknamed "Chief") was instrumental in his city's success in attracting the team. Partly to honor Bartle, the franchise officially became the Kansas City Chiefs on May 26.<ref name="kcsixties">{{cite web |url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/60s/ |title=Chiefs timeline - 1960s |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=KCChiefs.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070124191953/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/60s/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-01-24}}</ref>

The San Diego Chargers, under head coach [[Sid Gillman]], won a decisive 51–10 victory over the Boston Patriots for the 1963 AFL Championship. Confident that his team was capable of beating the NFL-champion [[Chicago Bears]] (he had the Chargers' rings inscribed with the phrase "World Champions"), Gillman approached NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle and proposed a final championship game between the two teams. Rozelle declined the offer; however, the game would be instituted three seasons later.<ref name="gillman">{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/6101341 |title=Gillman laid foundation for all who followed |accessdate=2007-02-08 |last=Barber |first=Phil |work=NFL.com}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

===Watershed years (1964–65)===
A series of events throughout the next few years demonstrated the AFL's ability to achieve a greater level of equality with the NFL. On January 29, 1964, the AFL signed a lucrative $36 million television contract with [[NBC]] (beginning in the 1965 season), which gave the league money it needed to compete with the NFL for players.  An NFL owner was quoted as saying to NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle that "They don't have to call us 'Mister' anymore".  A single-game attendance record was set on November 8, 1964, when 61,929 fans packed [[Shea Stadium]] to watch the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills.<ref name="sixtyfour">{{cite web |url=http://nflhistory.net/linescores/pdf/1964a.pdf |title=1964 box scores |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=NFL History Network|format=PDF}}</ref>

The bidding war for players between the AFL and NFL escalated in 1965. The Chiefs drafted [[University of Kansas]] star [[Gale Sayers]] in the first round of the 1965 AFL draft (held November 28, 1964), while the Chicago Bears did the same in the NFL draft. Sayers eventually signed with the Bears.<ref name="kcsixties" /> A similar situation occurred when the New York Jets and the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals both drafted University of Alabama quarterback [[Joe Namath]]. In what was viewed as a key victory for the AFL, Namath signed a $427,000 contract with the Jets on January 2, 1965 (the deal included a new car). It was the highest amount of money ever paid to a collegiate football player, and is cited as the strongest contributing factor to the eventual merger between the two leagues.<ref name="silverman">{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Silverman |title=The 'Other' League |url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/media/misc/11_the_other_league.pdf |publisher=Pro Football Weekly |date=1994-11-07 |accessdate=2007-02-08 |format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070605071617/http://www.kcchiefs.com/media/misc/11_the_other_league.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-05}}</ref>

In early 1965, the AFL considered adding its first expansion team, to begin play in [[Atlanta]] in 1966.  An AFL franchise was awarded to [[Rankin Smith]] of that city.   The NFL quickly offered Smith a franchise, which Smith accepted. In March, 1965, [[Joe Robbie]] had met with Commissioner Foss to inquire about an expansion franchise for [[Miami]], [[Florida]]. On May 6, after Atlanta's exit, Robbie secured an agreement with Miami mayor Robert King Higho to bring a team to Miami. League expansion was approved at a meeting held on June 7, and on August 16 the AFL's ninth franchise was officially awarded to Robbie and television star [[Danny Thomas]]. The [[Miami Dolphins]] joined the league for a fee of $7.5 million and started play in the AFL's Eastern Division in 1966.<ref name="dolphins">{{cite web |url=http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/history/historicalhighlights/historicalhighlights.asp |title=Miami Dolphins Historical Highlights |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=MiamiDolphins.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070207055603/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/history/historicalhighlights/historicalhighlights.asp| archivedate= 7 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Escalation and merger (1966–67)===
{{Details|AFL-NFL Merger}}
In 1966, the rivalry between the AFL and NFL reached an all-time peak. On April 7, Joe Foss resigned as AFL commissioner. His successor was Oakland Raiders head coach and general manager [[Al Davis]], who had been instrumental in turning around the fortunes of that franchise. No longer content with trying to outbid the NFL for college talent, the AFL under Davis started to recruit players already on NFL squads. Davis's strategy focused on quarterbacks in particular, and in two months he persuaded seven NFL quarterbacks to sign with the AFL.<ref>Dickey, pp. 38–39.</ref> Although Davis's intention was to help the AFL win the bidding war, some AFL and NFL owners saw the escalation as detrimental to both leagues.

The same month Davis was named commissioner, several NFL owners, along with Dallas Cowboys general manager Tex Schramm, secretly approached Lamar Hunt and other AFL owners and asked the AFL to merge. They held a series of secret meetings in Dallas to discuss their concerns over rapidly increasing player salaries, as well as the practice of player poaching. Hunt and Schramm completed the basic groundwork for a merger of the two leagues by the end of May, and on June 8, 1966, the merger was officially announced. Under the terms of the agreement, the two leagues would hold a common player draft. The agreement also called for a title game to be played between the champions of the respective leagues. The two leagues would be fully merged by 1970, NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] would remain as commissioner of the merged league, and additional expansion teams would eventually be awarded by 1970 or soon thereafter to bring it to a 28-team league. The AFL also agreed to pay indemnities of $18 million to the NFL over 20 years. In protest, Davis resigned as AFL commissioner on July 25 rather than remain until the completion of the merger, and [[Milt Woodard]] was named President of the AFL.<ref name="silverman" /><ref name="cross">{{cite news |first=B. Duane |last=Cross |title=The AFL: A Football Legacy (Part Two) |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_2/ |publisher=CNNSI.com |date=2001-01-22 |accessdate=2007-02-08 }}</ref>

On January 15, 1967, the first-ever World Championship Game between the champions of the two separate professional football leagues, the AFL-NFL Championship Game (retroactively referred to as [[Super Bowl I]]), was played in Los Angeles. After a close first half, the NFL champion [[Green Bay Packers]] overwhelmed the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs, 35–10. The loss reinforced for many the notion that the AFL was an inferior league. Packers head coach [[Vince Lombardi]] stated after the game, "I do not think they are as good as the top teams in the National Football League."<ref name="silverman" />

The second AFL-NFL Championship ([[Super Bowl II]]) yielded a similar result. The Oakland Raiders—who had easily beaten the Houston Oilers to win their first AFL championship—were overmatched by the Packers, 33–14. The more experienced Packers capitalized on a number of Raiders miscues and never trailed. Green Bay defensive tackle [[Henry Jordan]] offered a compliment to Oakland and the AFL, when he said, "...&nbsp;the AFL is becoming much more sophisticated on offense. I think the league has always had good personnel, but the blocks were subtler and better conceived in this game."<ref name="sbtwo">{{cite news |first=Tex |last=Maule |title=Green Bay, Handily |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/features/superbowl/archives/2/ |publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=1968-01-22 |accessdate=2007-02-09 }}</ref>

The AFL added its tenth and final team on May 24, 1967, when it awarded the league's second expansion franchise to an ownership group from [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], headed by NFL legend [[Paul Brown]].<ref name="nflhistorytwo" /> Although Brown had intended to join the NFL, he agreed to join the AFL when he learned that his team would be included in the NFL once the merger was completed.<ref>Brown, ''PB - The Paul Brown Story''</ref> The [[Cincinnati Bengals]] began play in the 1968 season, finishing last in the Western Division.

===Legitimacy and the end of an era (1968–70)===
While many AFL players and observers believed their league was the equal of the NFL, their first two Super Bowl performances did nothing to prove it. However, on November 17, 1968, when NBC [[Heidi Game|cut away from a game]] between the Jets and Raiders to air the children's movie ''[[Heidi (1968 film)|Heidi]],'' the ensuing uproar helped disprove the notion that fans still considered the AFL an inferior product. The perception of AFL inferiority forever changed on January 12, 1969, when the AFL Champion New York Jets shocked the heavily favored NFL Champion [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] in [[Super Bowl III]]. The Colts, who entered the contest favored by as many as 18 points, had completed the [[1968 NFL season]] with a 13–1 record, and won the NFL title with a convincing 34–0 win over the Cleveland Browns. Led by their stalwart defense—which allowed a record-low 144 points—the 1968 Colts were considered one of the best-ever NFL teams.<ref name="hof">{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.jsp?release_id=822 |title=He guaranteed it |accessdate=2007-02-09 |work=Pro Football Hall of Fame}}</ref><ref name="baltse">{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/balticolts/baltcolts.html |title=Baltimore Colts history |accessdate=2007-02-09 |work=Sports Encyclopedia| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070210173055/http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/balticolts/baltcolts.html| archivedate= 10 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

By contrast, the Jets had allowed 280 points, the highest total for any division winner in the two leagues. They had also only narrowly beaten the favored Oakland Raiders 27–23 in the AFL championship game. Jets quarterback [[Joe Namath]] recalled that in the days leading up to the game, he grew increasingly angry when told New York had no chance to beat Baltimore. Three days before the game, a frustrated Namath responded to a [[heckler]] at the Touchdown Club in Miami by declaring, "We're going to win Sunday, I'll guarantee you."<ref name="silverman" /><ref name="cross" /><ref name="jackman">{{cite news |first=Phil |last=Jackman |title=Lifetime guarantee; Jets-Colts |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/bal-mackey011299,0,4077047.story?coll=bal-sports-football |publisher=[[Baltimore Sun]] |date=1999-01-12 |accessdate=2007-02-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930014536/http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/bal-mackey011299,0,4077047.story?coll=bal-sports-football <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}</ref>

The last game in AFL history was the [[AFL All-Star Game]], held in Houston's [[Reliant Astrodome|Astrodome]] on January 17, 1970. The Western All-Stars, led by Chargers quarterback [[John Hadl]], defeated the Eastern All-Stars, 26–3. Hadl was named the game's [[Most Valuable Player]].<ref name="allstarhadl">{{cite web |url=http://www.mmbolding.com/BSR/The_1970_AFL_All-Star_Game.htm |title=1970 AFL All-Star Game recap |accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref> Prior to the start of the [[1970 NFL season]], the merged league was organized into two conferences of three divisions each. All ten AFL teams made up the bulk of the new [[American Football Conference]]. To avoid having an inequitable number of teams in each conference, the leagues voted to move three NFL teams to the AFC. Motivated by the prospect of an [[Battle of Ohio (NFL)|intrastate rivalry]] with the Bengals as well as by personal animosity toward [[Paul Brown]], Cleveland Browns owner [[Art Modell]] quickly offered to include his team in the AFC. He helped persuade the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] ([[Browns–Steelers rivalry|the Browns' archrivals]]) and Baltimore Colts (who shared the [[Baltimore]]/[[Washington, D.C.]] market with the [[Washington Redskins]]) to follow suit, and each team received US $3 million to make the switch.<ref name="switch">{{cite news |first=Gordon |last=Forbes |title=This time, realignment will be cool breeze |url=http://lists.rollanet.org/pipermail/rampage/Week-of-Mon-20010319/001092.html |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=2001-03-22 |accessdate=2007-02-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928150211/http://lists.rollanet.org/pipermail/rampage/Week-of-Mon-20010319/001092.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}</ref><ref name="modell">{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=6085 |title=Moment 26: Enter Art |accessdate=2007-02-09 |work=ClevelandBrowns.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071010070953/http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=6085 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-10}}</ref> All the other NFL squads became part of the [[National Football Conference]].

==Legacy==

===Overview===
The American Football League stands as the only professional football league to successfully compete against the NFL. When the two leagues merged in 1970, all ten AFL franchises and their statistics became part of the new NFL. Every other professional league that had competed against the NFL before the AFL-NFL merger had folded completely: the three previous leagues named "American Football League" and the [[All-America Football Conference]]. From an earlier AFL (1936–1937), only the Cleveland Rams (now the [[St. Louis Rams]]) joined the NFL and are currently operating, as are the [[Cleveland Browns]] and the [[San Francisco 49ers]] from the AAFC.  A third AAFC team, the [[Baltimore Colts (1947–1950)|Baltimore Colts]] (not related to the 1953–1983 Baltimore Colts or to the current Indianapolis Colts franchise), played only one year in the NFL, disbanding at the end of the 1950 season.<ref name="cross" />  The league resulting from the merger was a 26-team juggernaut (since expanded to 32) with television rights covering all of the [[Big Three television networks]] and teams in close proximity to almost all of the top 40 metropolitan areas, a fact that has precluded any other competing league from gaining traction since the merger; failed attempts to mimic the AFL's success included the [[World Football League]] (1974–75), [[United States Football League]] (1983–85), [[XFL]] (2001) and [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]] (2009–present).

The AFL was also the most successful of numerous upstart leagues of the 1960s and 1970s that attempted to challenge a major professional league's dominance. All nine teams that were in the AFL at the time the merger was agreed upon were accepted into the league intact (as was the tenth team added between the time of the merger's agreement and finalization). For comparison, the [[World Hockey Association]] (1972–79) managed to have four of its six remaining teams merged into the [[National Hockey League]], which actually caused the older league to contract a franchise, but WHA teams were forced to disperse the majority of their rosters and restart as expansion teams.  The merged WHA teams were also not financially sound, as three of the four were forced to relocate within 20 years. The [[American Basketball Association]] (1967–76) managed to have only four of its teams merged into the National Basketball Association, and the rest of the league was forced to fold. The [[Continental League]], a proposed third league for [[Major League Baseball]] that was to begin play in 1961, never played a single game.

===Rule changes===
The NFL eventually adopted many ideas introduced by the AFL. One was including the names on player jerseys. The older league also adopted the practice of using the stadium scoreboard clocks to keep track of the official game time, instead of just having a [[stopwatch]] used by the referee. The AFL played a 14-game schedule for its entire existence, starting in 1960. The NFL, which had played a 12-game schedule since 1947, changed to a 14-game schedule in 1961, a year after the American Football League instituted it. The AFL also introduced the [[two-point conversion]] to professional football thirty-four years before the NFL instituted it in 1994 (college football had adopted the two-point conversion in the late 1950s). All of these innovations pioneered by the AFL, including its more exciting style of play and colorful uniforms, have essentially made today's professional football more like the ''AFL'' than like the old-line NFL. The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the [[Super Bowl]], which has become the standard for championship contests in the United States of America.

===Television===
The NFL also adapted how the AFL used the growing power of televised football games, which were bolstered with the help of major network contracts (first with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and later with [[NBC]]). With that first contract with ABC, the AFL adopted the first-ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds were divided equally among member clubs. It featured many outstanding games, such as the classic 1962 double-overtime American Football League championship game between the [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]] and the defending champion [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]]. At the time it was the longest [[Professional American football championship games|professional football championship game]] ever played. The AFL also appealed to fans by offering a flashier style of play (just like the ABA in basketball), compared to the more conservative game of the NFL. Long passes ("bombs") were commonplace in AFL offenses, led by such talented quarterbacks as [[John Hadl]], [[Daryle Lamonica]] and [[Len Dawson]].

Despite having a national television contract, the AFL often found itself trying to gain a foothold, only to come up against roadblocks. For example, CBS-TV, which broadcast NFL games, ignored and did not report scores from the innovative AFL, on orders from the NFL. It was only after the merger agreement was announced that CBS began to give AFL scores.

===Expanding and reintroducing the sport to more cities===
The AFL took advantage of the burgeoning popularity of football by locating teams in major cities that lacked NFL franchises. Hunt's vision not only brought a new professional football league to [[California]] and [[New York State|New York]], but introduced the sport to [[Colorado]], restored it to [[Texas]] and later to fast-growing [[Florida]], as well as bringing it to [[New England]] for the first time in 12 years. Buffalo, having lost its [[Buffalo (NFL)|original NFL franchise]] in 1929 and turned down by the NFL at least twice (1940 and [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|1950]]) for a replacement, returned to the NFL with the merger. The return of football to Kansas City was the first time that city had seen professional football since the NFL's [[Kansas City Blues/Cowboys]] of the 1920s; the arrival of the Chiefs, and the contemporary arrival of the [[Arizona Cardinals|St. Louis Football Cardinals]], brought professional football back to Missouri for the first time since the temporary [[St. Louis Gunners]] of 1934.

If not for the AFL, at least 17 of today's NFL teams would probably never have existed: the ten teams from the AFL, and seven clubs that were instigated by the AFL's presence to some degree. Three NFL franchises were awarded as a direct result of the AFL's competition with the older league: the Minnesota Vikings, who were awarded to Max Winter in exchange for dropping his bid to join the AFL; the Atlanta Falcons, whose franchise went to Rankin Smith to dissuade him from purchasing the AFL's [[Miami Dolphins]]; and the New Orleans Saints, because of successful anti-trust legislation which let the two leagues merge, and was supported by several Louisiana politicians.

In the case of the Dallas Cowboys, the NFL had long sought to return to the Dallas area after the [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]] folded in 1952, but was originally met with strong opposition by [[Washington Redskins]] owner [[George Preston Marshall]], who had enjoyed a monopoly as the only NFL team to represent the American South. Marshall later changed his position after future-Cowboys owner [[Clint Murchison]] bought the rights to Washington's fight song "[[Hail to the Redskins]]" and threatened to prevent Marshall from playing it at games. By then, the NFL wanted to quickly award the new Dallas franchise to Murchison so the team could immediately begin play and complete with the AFL's Texans. As a result, the Cowboys played its inaugural season in 1960 without the benefit of the [[1960 NFL Draft|NFL draft]].

As part of the merger agreement, additional expansion teams would be awarded by 1970 or soon thereafter to bring the league to 28 franchises; this requirement was fulfilled when the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] began play in 1976. In addition, had it not been for the existence of the Oilers from 1960 to 1996, the [[Houston Texans]] also would likely not exist today; the 2002 expansion team restored professional football in Houston after the original charter AFL member Oilers relocated to become the [[Tennessee Titans]].

Kevin Sherrington of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' has argued that the presence of AFL and the subsequent merger radically altered the fortunes of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], saving the team "from stinking".<ref name="DallasNews20110201"/> Before the merger, the Steelers had long been one of the NFL's worst teams. Constantly lacking the money to build a quality team, the Steelers had only posted eight winning seasons, and just one playoff appearance, since their first year of existence in 1933. They also finished with [[1969 NFL season|a 1-13 record in 1969]], tied with the [[Chicago Bears]] for the worst record in the NFL. The $3 million indemnity that the Steelers received for joining the AFC with the rest of the former AFL teams after the merger helped them rebuild into a contender, drafting eventual-[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]rs like [[Terry Bradshaw]] and [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]], and ultimately winning four Super Bowls in the 1970s.<ref name="DallasNews20110201">{{cite web | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/super-bowl/the-game/20110201-sherrington-dallas-meeting-in-66-saved-steelers-from-stinking.ece | title=Dallas meeting in '66 saved Steelers from stinking | first=Kevin | last=Sherrington | work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] | date=2011-02-01 | accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> Since the 1970 merger, the Steelers have the NFL's highest winning percentage, the most total victories, the most trips to either conference championship game, are tied with the [[Dallas Cowboys]] for the most trips to the Super Bowl, and have won an NFL-record six Super Bowl championships.

===Effects on players===
Perhaps the greatest social legacy of the AFL was the [[domino effect]] of its policy of being more liberal than the entrenched NFL in offering opportunity for [[Black players in American professional football|black players]]. While the NFL was still emerging from thirty years of segregation influenced by Washington Redskins' owner [[George Preston Marshall]], the AFL actively recruited from small and predominantly black colleges. The AFL's color-blindness led not only to the explosion of black talent on the field, but to the eventual entry of blacks into scouting, coordinating, and ultimately head coaching positions, long after the league ceased to exist.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[James "Jim" Acho|Jim Acho]] | title=The "Foolish Club" | publisher=Gridiron Press | year=1997 | oclc=38596883 }} Foreword by [[Miller Farr]].</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Charles K. Ross | title=Outside the Lines: African Americans and the Integration of the National Football League | publisher=New York University Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-8147-7495-4 }}</ref>

The AFL's free agents came from several sources. Some were players who could not find success playing in the NFL, while another source was the [[Canadian Football League]]. In the late 1950s, many players released by the NFL, or un-drafted and unsigned out of college by the NFL, went North to try their luck with the CFL, and later returned to the states to play in the AFL.

In the league's first years, players such as Oilers' [[George Blanda]], Chargers/Bills' [[Jack Kemp]], Texans' [[Len Dawson]], the NY Titans' [[Don Maynard]], Raiders/Patriots/Jets' [[Babe Parilli]], Pats' [[Bob Dee]] proved to be AFL standouts. Other players such as the Broncos' [[Frank Tripucka]], the Pats' [[Gino Cappelletti]], the Bills' [[Cookie Gilchrist]] and the Chargers' [[Tobin Rote]], [[Sam DeLuca]] and [[Dave Kocourek]] also made their mark to give the fledgling league badly needed credibility. Rounding out this mix of potential talent were the true "free agents", the walk-ons and the "wanna-be's", who tried out in droves for the chance to play professional American football.

After the AFL-NFL merger agreement in 1966, and after the AFL's [[New York Jets|Jets]] defeated the "best team in the history of the NFL", the Colts, a popular misconception fostered by the NFL and spread by media reports was that the AFL defeated the NFL because of the [[Common Draft]] instituted in 1967. This apparently was meant to assert that the AFL could not achieve parity as long as it had to compete with the NFL in the draft. But the 1968 Jets had less than a handful of "common draftees". Their stars were honed in the AFL, many of them since the Titans days. As noted below, the AFL got its share of stars long before the "common draft".

Players who chose the AFL to develop their talent included [[Lance Alworth]] and [[Ron Mix]] of the [[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]], who had also been drafted by the NFL's [[San Francisco 49ers]] and [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] respectively. Both eventually were elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] after earning recognition during their careers as being among the best at their positions. Among specific teams, the 1964 [[Buffalo Bills]] stood out by holding their opponents to a pro football record 913 yards rushing on 300 attempts, while also recording fifty quarterback sacks in a 14-game schedule.

Another example is cited by the [[University of Kansas]] website, which describes the 1961 [[Bluebonnet Bowl]], won by KU, and goes on to say ''"Two Kansas players, quarterback [[John Hadl]] and fullback [[Curtis McClinton]], signed professional contracts on the field immediately after the conclusion of the game. Hadl inked a deal with the ''[AFL]'' [[San Diego Chargers]], and McClinton went to the ''[AFL]'' [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]]."'' Between them, in their careers Hadl and McClinton combined for an [[American Football League Rookies of the Year|American Football League Rookie of the Year]] award, seven [[American Football League All-Star games|AFL All-Star]] selections, two Pro Bowl selections, a team MVP award, two [[American Football League All-Star games|AFL All-Star Game]] MVP awards, two [[American Football League playoffs#1962 Championship|AFL championships]], and a [[Professional American football championship games|World Championship]]. And these were players selected by the AFL long ''before'' the "Common Draft".

In 2009, a five-part series, ''[[Full Color Football: The History of the American Football League]]'', on the ''[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] Network'', refuted many of the long-held misconceptions about the AFL. In it, [[Abner Haynes]] tells of how his father forbade him to accept being drafted by the NFL, after drunken scouts from that league had visited the Haynes home; the NFL Cowboys' Tex Schramm is quoted as saying that if his team had ever agreed to play the AFL's [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]], they would very likely have lost; [[George Blanda]] makes a case for more AFL players being inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame by pointing out that Hall of Famer [[Willie Brown (American football)|Willie Brown]] was cut by the [[Houston Oilers]] because he couldn't cover Oilers flanker [[Charlie Hennigan]] in practice. Later, when Brown was with the Broncos, Hennigan needed nine catches in one game against the Broncos to break [[Lionel Taylor]]'s Professional Football record of 100 catches in one season. Hennigan caught the nine passes and broke the record, even though he was covered by Brown: Blanda's point being that if Hennigan could do so well against a Hall of Fame db, he deserves induction, as well.

===Influence on professional football coaching===
The AFL also spawned coaches whose style and techniques have profoundly affected the play of professional football to this day. In addition to AFL greats like [[Hank Stram]], [[Lou Saban]], [[Sid Gillman]] and [[Al Davis]] were eventual hall of fame coaches such as [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]], a protégé of Davis with the AFL [[Oakland Raiders]] for one season; and [[Chuck Noll]], who worked for Gillman and the AFL [[San Diego Chargers|LA/San Diego Chargers]] from 1960 through 1965. Others include [[Buddy Ryan]] (AFL's [[New York Jets]]), [[Chuck Knox]] (Jets), [[Walt Michaels]] (Jets), and [[John Madden]] (AFL's [[Oakland Raiders]]). Additionally, many prominent coaches began their pro football careers as players in the AFL, including [[Sam Wyche]] ([[Cincinnati Bengals]]), [[Marty Schottenheimer]] ([[Buffalo Bills]]), [[Wayne Fontes]] (Jets), and two-time Super Bowl winner [[Tom Flores]] ([[Oakland Raiders]]). Flores also has a Super Bowl ring as a player ([[1969 AFL season|1969]] [[Kansas City Chiefs]]).

Walsh is often cited for an impressive "coaching tree" of assistants who went on to become head coaches. But since Walsh was an assistant to Davis, who in turn learned the trade from Gillman, Walsh's [[coaching tree]] is thus an offshoot of ''Gillman's'' coaching tree. Besides Davis, others who coached for Gillman included [[Dick Vermeil]], Knox, and [[George Allen (coach)|George Allen]], as well as Noll, the only head coach to win four Super Bowls. The numbers on Gillman's coaching tree indicate the Super Bowls won by his coaching "descendants", a total of twenty-five.

==AFL 50th Anniversary Celebration==
[[File:AFL 50th logo.jpg|thumb|185px|right|AFL 50th Anniversary Logo]]{{main|2009 NFL season}}
As the influence of the AFL continues through the present, the 50th anniversary of its launch was celebrated during [[2009 NFL season|2009]]. The season-long celebration began in August with the 2009 [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]] in [[Canton, Ohio]] between two AFC teams (as opposed to the AFC-vs-NFC format the game first adopted in 1971). The opponents were two of the original AFL franchises, the [[Buffalo Bills]] and [[Tennessee Titans]] (the former [[Houston Oilers]]). Bills' owner [[Ralph C. Wilson Jr.]] (a 2009 Hall of Fame inductee) and Titans' owner [[Bud Adams]] were the only surviving members of the [[Foolish Club]], the eight original owners of AFL franchises.

The Hall of Fame Game was the first of several "Legacy Weekends," during which each of the "original eight" AFL teams sported uniforms from their AFL era. Each of the 8 teams took part in at least two such "legacy" games. [[List of American Football League officials|On-field officials]] also wore red-and-white-striped AFL uniforms during these games.

In the fall of 2009, the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] pay-cable network premiered ''[[Full Color Football: The History of the American Football League]]'', a 5-part documentary series produced by [[NFL Films]] that features vintage game film and interviews as well as more recent interviews with those associated with the AFL.

The NFL sanctioned a variety of ''"Legacy"'' gear to celebrate the AFL anniversary, such as "throwback" jerseys, t-shirts, signs, pennants and banners, including items with the logos and colors of the [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]], [[Houston Oilers]], and [[New York Jets|New York Titans]], the three of the [[Foolish Club|Original Eight]] AFL teams which have changed names or venues. A December 5, 2009 story by Ken Belson in the ''[[New York Times]]'' quotes league officials as stating that AFL ''"Legacy"'' gear made up twenty to thirty percent of the league's annual $3 billion merchandise income. Fan favorites were the [[Denver Broncos]]' vertically striped socks, which could not be re-stocked quickly enough.

Today, two of the NFL's eight divisions are composed entirely of former AFL teams, the [[AFC West]] ([[Denver Broncos|Broncos]], [[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]], [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]], and [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]]) and the [[AFC East]] ([[Buffalo Bills|Bills]], [[Miami Dolphins|Dolphins]], [[New York Jets|Jets]], and [[New England Patriots|Patriots]]). Additionally, the [[Cincinnati Bengals|Bengals]] now play in the [[AFC North]] and the [[Tennessee Titans]] (formerly the Oilers) play in the [[AFC South]].

==AFL playoffs==
{{Details|American Football League playoffs}}
From 1960 to 1968, the AFL determined its champion via a single-elimination playoff game between the winners of its two divisions.The home teams alternated each year by division, so in 1968 the Jets hosted the Raiders, even though Oakland had a better record (this was changed in 1969). In 1963, the Buffalo Bills and Boston Patriots finished tied with identical records of 7–6–1 in the AFL East Division. There was no tie-breaker protocol in place, so a one game playoff was held in War Memorial Stadium in December. The visiting Patriots defeated the host Bills 26–8. The Patriots traveled to San Diego as the Chargers completed a three game season sweep over the weary Patriots with a 51–10 victory. A similar situation occurred in the 1968 season, when the Oakland Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs finished the regular season tied with identical records of 12–2 in the AFL West Division. The Raiders beat the Chiefs 41–6 in a division playoff to qualify for the AFL Championship Game. In 1969, the final year of the independent AFL, Professional Football's first "[[Wild card (sports)|wild card]]" playoffs were conducted. A four-team playoff was held, with the second-place teams in each division playing the winner of the other division. The Chiefs upset the Raiders in Oakland 17–7 in the league's Championship, the final AFL game played. The Kansas City Chiefs were the first Super Bowl champion to win two road playoff games and the first wildcard team to win the Super Bowl, although the term "wildcard" was coined by the media, and not used officially until several years later.

==AFL All-Star games==
{{Details|American Football League All-Star game}}

The AFL did not play an All-Star game after its first season in 1960, but did stage All-Star games for the 1961 through 1969 seasons. All-Star teams from the Eastern and Western divisions played each other after every season except 1965. That season, the league champion Buffalo Bills played all-stars from the other teams.

After the 1964 season, the AFL All-Star game had been scheduled for early 1965 in [[New Orleans]]' Tulane Stadium. After numerous black players were refused service by a number of area hotels and businesses, black and white players alike called for a [[boycott]]. Led by Bills players such as [[Cookie Gilchrist]], the players successfully lobbied to have the game moved to Houston's [[Jeppesen Stadium]].<ref name="boycott">{{cite web |url=http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/1950/Black_football_players_boycott_AFL_AllStar_game |title=Black football players boycott AFL All-Star game |accessdate=2007-02-09 |work=The African American Registry |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061225020026/http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/1950/Black_football_players_boycott_AFL_AllStar_game <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-12-25}}</ref>
