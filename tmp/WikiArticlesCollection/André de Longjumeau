'''André de Longjumeau''' (also known as '''Andrew of Longjumeau''' in English) was a 13th-century [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] missionary and diplomat and one of the most active Occidental diplomats in the East in the 13th century. He led two embassies to the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]: the first carried letters from [[Pope Innocent IV]] and the second bore gifts and letters from [[Louis IX of France]] to [[Güyük Khan]]. Well acquainted with the [[Middle-East]], he spoke [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and "[[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic|Chaldean]]" (thought to be either [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or [[Persian language|Persian]]).<ref name = "mxpvnk">Roux, "Les explorateurs", p.96</ref>

==Mission for the Holy Crown of Thorns==
[[Image:HolyCrown.JPG|thumb|Andrew went to Constantinople to obtain the [[Crown of Thorns]] bought by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] to [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]]. It is preserved today in a 19th-century reliquary, in [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]], [[Paris]].]]
Andrew's first mission to the East was when he was asked by the French king [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] to go and fetch the [[Crown of Thorns]] which had been sold to him by the Latin Emperor of [[Constantinople]] [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]] in 1238, who was anxious to obtain support for his tottering empire.<ref name = "mxpvnk"/> Andrew was accompanied on this mission by brother Jacques.

==Papal Mission to the Mongols (1245–1247)==
Andrew of Longjumeau led one of four missions dispatched to the Mongols by [[Pope Innocent IV]]. He left [[Lyon]] in the spring of 1245 for the [[Levant]].<ref>Gregory G. Guzman, "Simon of Saint-Quentin and the Dominican Mission to the Mongol Baiju: A Reappraisal" ''Speculum'', Vol. 46, No. 2. (April., 1971), p. 235.</ref> He visited Muslim principalities in [[Syria]] and representatives of the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] churches in Persia, finally delivering the papal correspondence to a Mongol general near [[Tabriz]].<ref>[[Igor de Rachewiltz]], ''Papal Envoys to the Great Khans'' (Stanford University Press, 1971), p. 113.</ref> In Tabriz, André de Longjumeau met with a monk from the [[Far East]], named [[Simeon Rabban Ata]], who had been put in charge by the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of protecting the Christians in the [[Middle-East]].<ref>Richard, "Histoire des Croisades", p.376</ref>

==Second Mission to the Mongols (1249–1251)==
At the Mongol camp near [[Kars]] Andrew had met a certain [[David and Mark|David]], who in December 1248 appeared at the court of King [[Louis IX of France]] in [[Cyprus]]. Andrew, who was now with Saint Louis, interpreted David's message to the King, a real or pretended offer of alliance from the Mongol general [[Eljigidei]], and a proposal of a joint attack upon the Islamic powers of [[Syria]].

In reply to this the French sovereign dispatched Andrew as his ambassador to [[Güyük Khan]]; with Longjumeau went his brother William (also a Dominican) and several others — John Goderiche, John of Carcassonne, Herbert "Le [[Sommelier]]," Gerbert of Sens, Robert (a clerk), a certain William, and an unnamed clerk of [[Poissy]].

The party set out on 27 January 1249, with letters from King Louis and the [[papal legate]], and rich presents, including a chapel-tent, lined with scarlet cloth and embroidered with sacred pictures. From Cyprus they went to the port of [[Antioch]] in Syria, and thence traveled for a year to the Khan's court, going ten leagues (55.56 kilometers) per day. Their route led them through [[Iran|Persia]], along the southern and eastern shores of the [[Caspian Sea]], and certainly through [[Taraz|Talas]], north-east of [[Tashkent]].

On arrival at the supreme Mongol court — either that on the [[Imyl river]] (near [[Lake Alakol]] and the present Russo-Chinese frontier in the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]]), or more probably at or near [[Karakorum]] itself, south-west of [[Lake Baikal]] — Andrew found Güyük Khan dead, poisoned, as the envoy supposed, by [[Batu Khan]]'s agents. The regent-mother [[Oghul Qaimish]] (the "Camus" of [[William of Rubruck]]) seems to have received and dismissed him with presents and a letter for Louis IX, the latter a fine specimen of Mongol insolence. But it is certain that before the friar had quit "Tartary" [[Möngke Khan|Möngke]], Güyük's successor, had been elected.

Andrew's report to his sovereign, whom he rejoined in 1251 at [[Caesarea Palaestina|Caesarea]] in [[Palestine]], appears to have been a mixture of history and fable; the latter affects his narrative of the Mongols' rise to greatness, and the struggles of their leader [[Genghis Khan]] with [[Prester John]]; it is still more evident in the position assigned to the [[Mongols]]' homeland, close to the prison of [[Gog and Magog]]. On the other hand, the envoy's account of Mongol customs is fairly accurate, and his statements about [[Christianity among the Mongols|Mongol Christianity]] and its prosperity, though perhaps exaggerated (e.g. as to the 800 chapels on wheels in the nomadic host), are based on fact.

Mounds of bones marked his road, witnesses of devastations which other historians record in detail. He found Christian prisoners from Germany in the heart of "Tartary" (at Talas), and was compelled to observe the ceremony of passing between two fires, as a bringer of gifts to a dead [[Genghis Khan|Khan]], gifts which were of course treated by the Mongols as evidence of submission. This insulting behaviour, and the language of the letter with which Andrew reappeared, marked the mission a failure: King Louis, says [[Jean de Joinville|Joinville]], "''se repenti fort''" ("felt very sorry").

==Death==
Andrew died some time after 1253, while he was active as a missionary in Palestine. The [[Franciscan]] missionary, [[William of Rubruck]], in his work on Asian customs, declares that everything he had heard from Andrew on the subject was fully borne out by his own personal observations.

We only know of Andrew through references in other writers: see especially [[William of Rubruck]]'s in ''Recueil de voyages'', iv. (Paris, 1839), pp.&nbsp;261, 265, 279, 296, 310, 353, 363, 370; Joinville, ed. Francisque Michel (1858, etc.), pp.&nbsp;142, etc.; Jean Pierre Sarrasin, in same vol., pp.&nbsp;254–235; [[William of Nangis]] in ''Recueil des historiens des Gaules'', xx. 359–367; [[Charles de Rémusat|Rémusat]], ''Mémoires sur les relations politiques des princes chrétiens… avec les… Mongols'' (1822, etc.), p.&nbsp;52.
