'''Cholera''' is an infection of the [[small intestine]] caused by the [[Bacteria|bacterium]] ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]''. The main symptoms are watery [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]]. Transmission occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the [[feces]] (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. Severe cholera, requiring hospitalization, results from the accumulation of about a million bacterial cells within the body.{{mcn|date=November 2013}}<ref name="bakerinstitute.org">{{cite AV media

 }}</ref>  The severity of the diarrhea and vomiting can lead to rapid [[dehydration]] and [[electrolyte]] imbalance, and death in some cases. The primary treatment is [[oral rehydration therapy]], typically with oral rehydration solution, to replace water and electrolytes. If this is not tolerated or does not provide improvement fast enough, [[intravenous]] fluids can also be used. [[Antibacterial]] drugs are beneficial in those with severe disease to shorten its duration and severity. Worldwide, it affects 3–5 million people and causes 100,000–130,000 deaths a year {{As of|2010|lc=on}}. Cholera was one of the earliest infections to be studied by [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] methods.

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[Image:PHIL 1939 lores.jpg|thumb|A person with severe dehydration due to cholera. Note the sunken eyes and decreased skin turgor which produces wrinkled hands and skin]]

The primary symptoms of cholera are profuse [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]] of clear fluid.<ref name=Lancet2004/> These symptoms usually start suddenly, half a day to five days after ingestion of the bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Azman AS, Rudolph KE, Cummings DAT, Lessler J |title=The incubation period of cholera: A systematic review |journal=Journal of Infection |volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=432–438 |year=2012 |month=November |pmid= 23201968 |doi=10.1016/j.jinf.2012.11.013 |url= |pmc=3677557}}</ref> The diarrhea is frequently described as "rice water" in nature and may have a fishy odor.<ref name=Lancet2004/> An untreated person with cholera may produce {{convert|10|to|20|litre|USgal|sigfig=1}} of diarrhea a day.<ref name=Lancet2004/> Severe cholera kills about half of affected individuals.<ref name=Lancet2004/>  Estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100.<ref>{{cite journal |author=King AA, Ionides EL, J.Luckhurst, Bouma MJ |title=Inapparent infections and cholera dynamics |journal=Nature |volume=454 |issue=7206 |pages=877–80 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18704085 |doi=10.1038/nature07084}}</ref> Cholera has been nicknamed the "blue death" because a victim's skin turns bluish-gray from extreme loss of fluids.<ref>McElroy, Ann and Patricia K.

[[Image:Cholera feces.jpg|thumb|Typical "rice water" diarrhea]]
If the severe diarrhea is not treated, it can result in life-threatening [[dehydration]] and [[electrolyte]] imbalances.<ref name=Lancet2004/>
Fever is rare and should raise suspicion for secondary infection. Patients can be lethargic, and might have sunken eyes, dry mouth, cold clammy skin, decreased skin turgor, or wrinkled hands and feet. [[Kussmaul breathing]], a deep and labored breathing pattern, can occur because of [[acidosis]] from stool bicarbonate losses and lactic acidosis associated with poor perfusion.   Blood pressure drops due to dehydration, peripheral pulse is rapid and thready, and urine output decreases with time. Muscle cramping and weakness, altered consciousness, [[seizures]], or even [[coma]] due to electrolyte losses and ion shifts are common, especially in children.<ref name=Lancet2004/>

{{Main|Vibrio cholerae}}
[[Image:Vibrio cholerae.jpg|thumb|''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', the bacterium that causes cholera]]

Transmission is primarily by the fecal contamination of food and water caused by poor [[sanitation]].<ref name=WHO2010>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/immunization/Cholera_PP_Accomp_letter__Mar_10_2010.pdf |title=Cholera vaccines.

=== Susceptibility ===
About 100 million bacteria must typically be ingested to cause cholera in a normal healthy adult.<ref name=Lancet2004/> This dose, however, is less in those with lowered [[gastric acid]]ity (for instance those using [[proton pump inhibitors]]).<ref name=Lancet2004/> Children are also more susceptible, with two- to four-year-olds having the highest rates of infection.<ref name=Lancet2004/> Individuals' susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their [[blood type]], with those with [[type O blood]] being the most susceptible.<ref name=Lancet2004/><ref name="Harris_2005">{{cite journal|author=Harris JB, Khan AI, LaRocque RC, ''et al.'' |title=Blood Group, Immunity, and Risk of Infection with Vibrio cholerae in an Area of Endemicity |journal=Infect.

=== Transmission ===
Cholera is typically transmitted by either contaminated food or water. In the developed world, seafood is the usual cause, while in the developing world it is more often water.<ref name=Lancet2004/> Most cholera cases in developed countries are a result of transmission by food. This occurs when people harvest oysters in waters infected with sewage, as ''Vibrio cholerae'' accumulates in zooplankton and the oysters eat the zooplankton.<ref name="bakerinstitute.org"/> Cholera has been found in two animal populations: [[shellfish]] and [[plankton]].<ref name=Lancet2004 />

People infected with cholera often have diarrhea, and if this highly liquid stool, colloquially referred to as "rice-water", contaminates water used by others, disease transmission may occur.<ref name="Sherris">{{cite book| author = Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors)| title = Sherris Medical Microbiology| edition = 4th| pages = 376–7| publisher = McGraw Hill| year = 2004| isbn = 0-8385-8529-9}}</ref> The source of the contamination is typically other cholera sufferers when their untreated diarrheal discharge is allowed to get into waterways, [[groundwater]] or drinking water supplies. Drinking any infected water and eating any foods washed in the water, as well as [[shellfish]] living in the affected [[waterway]], can cause a person to contract an infection. Cholera is rarely spread directly from person to person. Both toxic and nontoxic strains exist. Nontoxic strains can acquire toxicity through a [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate]] [[bacteriophage]].<ref name="Archivist_1997">{{cite journal| author=Archivist| title=Cholera phage discovery| journal=Arch Dis Child| year=1997| volume=76| page=274| url=http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/76/3/274| doi=10.1136/adc.76.3.274| ref=harv| issue=3}}</ref> Coastal cholera outbreaks typically follow [[algal bloom|zooplankton blooms]], thus making cholera a [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] disease.{{mcn|date=December 2013}}

== Mechanism ==
[[Image:Cholera.jpg|thumb|[[Drawing]] of [[Death (personification)|Death]] bringing cholera, in ''[[Le Petit Journal]]'' (1912)]]

When consumed, most bacteria do not survive the acidic conditions of the [[stomach|human stomach]].<ref name="Hartwell">{{cite book| author=Hartwell LH, Hood L, Goldberg ML, Reynolds AE, Silver LM, and Veres RC| year=2004| title=Genetics: From genes to genomes| publisher=Mc-Graw Hill| location=Boston| pages=551–552, 572–574}} (using the turning off and turning on of [[gene expression]] to make toxin proteins in cholera bacteria as a "comprehensive example" of what is known about the mechanisms by which bacteria change the mix of proteins they express to respond to the changing opportunities for surviving and thriving in different chemical environments).</ref> The few surviving bacteria conserve their [[nutrient|energy and stored nutrients]] during the passage through the stomach by shutting down much protein production. When the surviving bacteria exit the stomach and reach the [[small intestine]], they need to propel themselves through the thick [[mucous membrane|mucus]] that lines the small intestine to get to the intestinal walls where they can thrive. ''V. cholerae'' bacteria start up production of the hollow cylindrical protein [[flagellin]] to make [[flagella]], the cork-screw helical fibers they rotate to propel themselves through the mucus of the small intestine.{{mcn|date=December 2013}}

Once the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall they no longer need the flagella to move. The bacteria stop producing the protein flagellin to conserve energy and nutrients by changing the mix of proteins which they express in response to the changed chemical surroundings. On reaching the intestinal wall, ''V. cholerae'' start producing the toxic proteins that give the infected person a watery diarrhea. This carries the multiplying new generations of ''V. cholerae'' bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place.{{mcn|date=December 2013}}

The [[cholera toxin]] (CTX or CT) is an [[oligomer]]ic complex made up of six protein subunits: a single copy of the A subunit (part A), and five copies of the B subunit (part B), connected by a [[disulfide bond]]. The five B subunits form a five-membered ring that binds to [[GM1]] [[ganglioside]]s on the surface of the intestinal epithelium cells. The A1 portion of the A subunit is an enzyme that [[ADP-ribosylation|ADP-ribosylates]] [[G protein]]s, while the A2 chain fits into the central pore of the B subunit ring. Upon binding, the complex is taken into the cell via receptor-mediated [[endocytosis]]. Once inside the cell, the disulfide bond is reduced, and the A1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein called [[ADP-ribosylation factor 6]] (Arf6).<ref name=O>{{cite journal |author=O'Neal C, Jobling M, Holmes R, Hol W |title=Structural basis for the activation of cholera toxin by human ARF6-GTP |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5737 |pages=1093–6 |year=2005 |pmid=16099990 |doi=10.1126/science.1113398 |ref=harv}}</ref> Binding exposes its active site, allowing it to permanently ribosylate the [[Gs alpha subunit]] of the [[heterotrimeric G protein]]. This results in constitutive [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] production, which in turn leads to secretion of H<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration. The gene encoding the cholera toxin was introduced into ''V. cholerae'' by horizontal gene transfer. Virulent strains of ''V. cholerae'' carry a variant of [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate]] [[bacteriophage]] called CTXf or CTXφ.

Microbiologists have studied the [[gene expression|genetic mechanisms]] by which the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria turn off the production of some proteins and turn on the production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, and on to the intestinal wall.<ref name="DiRita">{{cite journal |author=DiRita VJ, Parsot C, Jander G, Mekalanos JJ |title=Regulatory cascade controls virulence in Vibrio cholerae |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=88 |issue=12 |pages=5403–7 |year=1991 |month=June |pmid=2052618 |pmc=51881 |doi=10.1073/pnas.88.12.5403 |url= |ref=harv}}</ref> Of particular interest have been the genetic mechanisms by which cholera bacteria turn on the protein production of the toxins that interact with host cell mechanisms to pump [[chloride]] ions into the small intestine, creating an ionic pressure which prevents sodium ions from entering the cell. The chloride and sodium ions create a salt-water environment in the small intestines, which through osmosis can pull up to six litres of water per day through the intestinal cells, creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated if an appropriate mixture of dilute salt water and sugar is not taken to replace the blood's water and salts lost in the diarrhea.{{mcn|date=December 2013}}

By inserting separate, successive sections of ''V. cholerae'' DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which ''V. cholerae'' responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall. Researchers have discovered a complex cascade of regulatory proteins controls expression of ''V. cholerae'' [[virulence]] determinants. In responding to the chemical environment at the intestinal wall, the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria produce the TcpP/TcpH proteins, which, together with the ToxR/ToxS proteins, activate the expression of the ToxT regulatory protein. ToxT then directly activates expression of [[virulence]] genes that produce the toxins, causing diarrhea in the infected person and allowing the bacteria to colonize the intestine.<ref name="DiRita"/> Current research aims at discovering "the signal that makes the cholera bacteria stop swimming and start to colonize (that is, adhere to the cells of) the small intestine."<ref name="DiRita" />

=== Genetic structure ===
Amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting of the pandemic isolates of ''V. cholerae'' has revealed variation in the genetic structure. Two clusters have been identified: Cluster I and Cluster II. For the most part, Cluster I consists of strains from the 1960s and 1970s, while Cluster II largely contains strains from the 1980s and 1990s, based on the change in the clone structure. This grouping of strains is best seen in the strains from the African continent.{{MEDRS|date=December 2013}}<ref>{{MEDRS|date=December 2013}} {{cite journal |author=Lan R, Reeves PR |year=2002 |month= Jan|title=Pandemic Spread of Cholera: Genetic Diversity and Relationships within the Seventh Pandemic Clone of Vibrio cholerae Determined by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism |journal=Journal of Clinical Microbiology |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=172–181 |doi=10.1128/JCM.40.1.172-181.2002 |pmid=11773113 |issn=0095-1137 |url=http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11773113 |pmc=120103 |ref=harv }}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
A rapid dip-stick test is available to determine the presence of ''V. cholerae''.<ref name=NEJM2006/> In those samples that test positive, further testing should be done to determine antibiotic resistance.<ref name=NEJM2006/> In [[epidemic]] situations, a clinical diagnosis may be made by taking a patient history and doing a brief examination. Treatment is usually started without or before confirmation by laboratory analysis.

Stool and swab samples collected in the acute stage of the disease, before antibiotics have been administered, are the most useful specimens for laboratory diagnosis. If an epidemic of cholera is suspected, the most common causative agent is ''V. cholerae'' O1. If ''V. cholerae'' [[serotype|serogroup]] O1 is not isolated, the laboratory should test for ''V. cholerae'' O139. However, if neither of these organisms is isolated, it is necessary to send stool specimens to a reference laboratory.
Infection with ''V. cholerae'' O139 should be reported and handled in the same manner as that caused by ''V. cholerae'' O1. The associated diarrheal illness should be referred to as cholera and must be reported in the United States.<ref name="CDC_Diag">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/cholera/top.pdf |title=Laboratory Methods for the Diagnosis of Epidemic Dysentery and Cholera |publisher=CDC | location=Atlanta, GA | format=PDF |year=1999 |accessdate=2010-02-01}}</ref>

== Prevention ==
[[Image:Cholera hospital in Dhaka.jpg|thumb|[[International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh|Cholera hospital]] in [[Dhaka]], showing typical "cholera beds"]]
The World Health Organization recommends focusing on prevention, preparedness, and response to combat the spread of cholera.<ref name="who.int">“Cholera Fact Sheet.” World Health Organization. http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs107/en/index.html. Retrieved November 5, 2013.</ref> They also stress the importance of an effective surveillance system.<ref name="who.int"/> Governments can play a role in all of these areas, and in preventing cholera or indirectly facilitating its spread.

Although cholera may be life-threatening, prevention of the disease is normally straightforward if proper sanitation practices are followed. In [[developed countries]], due to nearly universal advanced [[water treatment]] and sanitation practices, cholera is no longer a major health threat. The last major outbreak of cholera in the United States occurred in 1910–1911.<ref name="moltke1">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Cholera Kills Boy.

There are several points along the cholera transmission path at which its spread may be halted:{{mcn|date=December 2013}}
* Sterilization: Proper disposal and treatment of infected fecal waste water produced by cholera victims and all contaminated materials (e.g. clothing, bedding, etc.) are essential. All materials that come in contact with cholera patients should be [[Disinfection|sanitized]] by washing in hot water, using [[chlorine]] [[bleach]] if possible. Hands that touch cholera patients or their clothing, bedding, etc., should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected with chlorinated water or other effective antimicrobial agents.
* Sewage: antibacterial treatment of general [[sewage]] by chlorine, ozone, ultraviolet light or other effective treatment before it enters the waterways or underground water supplies helps prevent undiagnosed patients from inadvertently spreading the disease.
* Sources: Warnings about possible cholera contamination should be posted around contaminated water sources with directions on how to [[decontamination|decontaminate]] the water (boiling, chlorination etc.) for possible use.
* Water purification: All water used for drinking, washing, or cooking should be sterilized by either boiling, [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], ozone water treatment, ultraviolet light sterilization (e.g. by [[solar water disinfection]]), or antimicrobial filtration in any area where cholera may be present. Chlorination and boiling are often the least expensive and most effective means of halting transmission. [[Cloth filter]]s or [[#Sari filtration|sari filtration]], though very basic, have significantly reduced the occurrence of cholera when used in poor villages in [[Bangladesh]] that rely on untreated surface water. Better antimicrobial filters, like those present in advanced individual water treatment hiking kits, are most effective. Public health education and adherence to appropriate sanitation practices are of primary importance to help prevent and control transmission of cholera and other diseases.

=== Surveillance ===
Surveillance and prompt reporting allow for containing cholera epidemics rapidly. Cholera exists as a seasonal disease in many endemic countries, occurring annually mostly during rainy seasons. Surveillance systems can provide early alerts to outbreaks, therefore leading to coordinated response and assist in preparation of preparedness plans. Efficient surveillance systems can also improve the risk assessment for potential cholera outbreaks. Understanding the seasonality and location of outbreaks provides guidance for improving cholera control activities for the most vulnerable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/cholera/control/en/index.html |title=Cholera: prevention and control |publisher=WHO |work=Health topics | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-12-08}}</ref> For prevention to be effective, it is important that cases be reported to national health authorities.<ref name=Lancet2004/>

== Treatment ==
[[Image:Cholera rehydration nurses.jpg|thumb|Cholera patient being treated by medical staff in 1992]]
Continued eating speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function. The World Health Organization recommends this generally for cases of diarrhea no matter what the underlying cause.<ref name=WHOTreatmentOfDiarrhoea2005/> A CDC training manual specifically for cholera states: “Continue to breastfeed your baby if the baby has watery diarrhea, even when traveling to get treatment. Adults and older children should continue to eat frequently.”<ref name=CDCCommunityHealthWorkerTrainingManual>[http://www.cdc.gov/haiticholera/pdf/chw_trainingmaterialsforcholera.pdf Community Health Worker Training Materials for Cholera Prevention and Control], CDC, slides at back are dated 11/17/2010. See esp pages 7-8.</ref>

=== Fluids ===

The most common error in caring for patients with cholera is to underestimate the speed
and volume of fluids required.<ref>http://globalhealthcenter.umn.edu/documents/Cholera-Lancet-July2012.pdf</ref> In most cases, cholera can be successfully treated with [[oral rehydration therapy]] (ORT), which is highly effective, safe, and simple to administer.<ref name=NEJM2006/> Rice-based solutions are preferred to glucose-based ones due to greater efficiency.<ref name=NEJM2006/> In severe cases with significant dehydration, [[intravenous]] rehydration may be necessary.

If commercially produced oral rehydration solutions are too expensive or difficult to obtain, solutions can be made. One such recipe calls for 1 liter of boiled water, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 6 teaspoons of sugar, and added mashed banana for potassium and to improve taste.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rehydrate.org/solutions/homemade.htm|title=Oral Rehydration Solutions: Made at Home|year=2010|accessdate=2010-10-29|publisher=The Mother and Child Health and Education Trust}}</ref>

=== Electrolytes ===
As there frequently is initially [[acidosis]], the [[potassium]] level may be normal, even though large losses have occurred.<ref name=Lancet2004/> As the dehydration is corrected, potassium levels may decrease rapidly, and thus need to be replaced.<ref name=Lancet2004/>  This may be done by eating foods high in potassium like bananas or green coconut water.<ref name=choleraoutbreaksteps />

Although much is known about the mechanisms behind the spread of cholera, this has not led to a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen some places and not others. Lack of treatment of human [[feces]] and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread, but bodies of water can serve as a [[Natural reservoir|reservoir]], and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease. Cholera was not known in the [[Americas]] for most of the 20th century, but it reappeared towards the end of that century.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Blake | first1 = PA | title = Epidemiology of cholera in the Americas | journal = Gastroenterology clinics of North America | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 639–60 | year = 1993 | pmid = 7691740 }}</ref>

== History ==
The word cholera is from {{lang-el|χολέρα}} ''kholera'' from χολή ''kholē'' "bile". Cholera likely has its origins in the [[Indian Subcontinent]]; it has been prevalent in the [[Ganges delta]] since ancient times.<ref name=Lancet2004/> Choleras first origins, within the Indian Subcontinent, are believed to have occurred due to the result of poor living conditions as well as the presence of pools of still water; both of which are ideal living conditions for cholera to thrive.<ref name=Rosenberg /> The disease first spread by trade routes (land and sea) to [[Russia]] in 1817, then, through technological advancements, to the rest of [[Europe]], and from Europe to [[North America]] and the rest of the world.<ref name=Lancet2004/> Seven cholera [[pandemic]]s have occurred in the past 200 years, with the seventh originating in [[Indonesia]] in 1961.<ref>"[http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/05/09/f-cholera-outbreaks.html Cholera's seven pandemics]".

The [[first cholera pandemic]] occurred in the Bengal region of India starting in 1817 through 1824. The disease dispersed from India to Southeast Asia, China, Japan, the Middle East, and southern Russia. The [[Second cholera pandemic|second pandemic]] lasted from 1827 to 1835 and affected the United States and Europe particularly due to the result of advancements in transportation, such as trade, and increased human migration, including soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|last=McNeil|first=John|title=Something New Under The Sun:An Environmental History of the  Twentieth Century World (The Global Century Series).}}</ref>  The [[Third cholera pandemic|third pandemic]] erupted in 1839, persisted until 1856, extended to North Africa, and reached South America, for the first time specifically infringing upon Brazil. Cholera hit the sub-Saharan African region during the [[Fourth cholera pandemic|fourth pandemic]] from 1863 to 1875. The [[Fifth cholera pandemic|fifth]] and [[Sixth cholera pandemic|sixth pandemics]] raged from 1881–1896 and 1899-1923. These epidemics were less fatal due to a greater understanding of the cholera bacteria. Egypt, the Arabian peninsula, Persia, India, and the Philippines were hit hardest during these epidemics, while other areas, like Germany in 1892 and Naples from 1910–1911, experienced severe outbreaks. The final [[Seventh cholera pandemic|pandemic]] originated in 1961 in Indonesia and is marked by the emergence of a new strain, nicknamed El Tor, which still persists today in developing countries.<ref>Aberth, John.

Cholera became the first [[reportable disease]] in the United States due to the significant effects it had on health.<ref name=Lancet2004/> [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]], in [[England]], was the first to identify the importance of contaminated water in its cause in 1854.<ref name=Lancet2004/> Cholera is now no longer considered a pressing health threat in Europe and North America due to [[water filtration|filtering]] and [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] of water supplies, but still heavily affects populations in [[developing countries]].

In the past, vessels flew a yellow [[quarantine]] flag if any crew members or passengers were suffering from cholera. No one aboard a vessel flying a yellow flag would be allowed ashore for an extended period, typically 30 to 40 days.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sehdev PS |title=The origin of quarantine |journal=Clin.

Cholera cases are much less frequent in developed countries where governments have helped to establish water sanitation practices and effective medical treatments.<ref>"Cholera." World Health Organization. http://www.who.int/topics/cholera/about/en/index.html</ref> The United States, for example, used to have a severe cholera problem similar to those in some developing countries. There were three large cholera outbreaks in the 1800s, which can be attributed to ''Vibrio cholerae'''s spread through interior waterways like the Erie Canal and routes along the Eastern Seaboard.<ref>Pyle, G.F. “The Diffusion of Cholera in the United States in the Nineteenth Century.” http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1969.tb00605.x/abstract Geographical Analysis 1. 1969.

=== Research ===
The bacterium was isolated in 1855 by Italian anatomist [[Filippo Pacini]], but its exact nature and his results were not widely known.

Spanish physician [[Jaume Ferran i Clua]] developed a cholera vaccine in 1885, the first to immunize humans against a bacterial disease.<ref>http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/others#EVT_101034</ref>

Ukrainian bacteriologist [[Waldemar Haffkine]] developed a cholera vaccine in July 1892.<ref>http://www.haffkineinstitute.org/waldemar.htm</ref>

One of the major contributions to fighting cholera was made by the physician and pioneer medical scientist [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] (1813–1858), who in 1854 found a link between cholera and contaminated drinking water.<ref name="Rosenberg">{{cite book |author=Rosenberg, Charles E. |title=The cholera years: the United States in 1832, 1849 and 1866 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1987 |pages= |isbn=0-226-72677-0}}</ref> Dr. Snow proposed a microbial origin for epidemic cholera in 1849. In his major "state of the art" review of 1855, he proposed a substantially complete and correct model for the [[etiology]] of the disease. In two pioneering epidemiological field studies, he was able to demonstrate human [[sewage]] contamination was the most probable disease vector in two major epidemics in London in 1854.<ref>Dr John Snow, ''The mode of communication of cholera'', London 1855</ref> His model was not immediately accepted, but it was seen to be the more plausible, as medical microbiology developed over the next 30 years or so.
[[File:Robert Koch (Deutsche Cholera-Expedition in Ägypten 1884).jpg|thumb|[[Robert Koch]] (third from the right) on a cholera research expedition in [[Egypt]] in 1884, one year after he identified ''V. cholerae''.]]

Cities in developed nations made massive investment in clean water supply and well-separated sewage treatment infrastructures between the mid-1850s and the 1900s. This eliminated the threat of cholera epidemics from the major developed cities in the world. In 1883, [[Robert Koch]] identified ''V. cholerae'' with a microscope as the bacillus causing the disease.<ref>Aberth,John. Plagues in World History. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2011, 101.</ref>

[[Robert Allan Phillips]], working at the US [[Naval Medical Research Unit Two]] in Southeast Asia, evaluated the pathophysiology of the disease using modern laboratory chemistry techniques and developed a protocol for rehydration. His research led the [[Lasker Foundation]] to award him its prize in 1967.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
 
Cholera has been a laboratory for the study of evolution of virulence. The province of Bengal in [[British Raj|British India]] was partitioned into [[West Bengal]] and [[East Pakistan]] in 1947. Prior to partition, both regions had cholera pathogens with similar characteristics. After 1947, India made more progress on public health than East Pakistan (now [[Bangladesh]]). As a consequence,{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} the strains of the pathogen that succeeded in India had a greater incentive in the longevity of the host. They have become less virulent than the strains prevailing in Bangladesh. These draw upon the resources of the host population and rapidly kill many victims.

More recently, in 2002, Alam, ''et al.'', studied stool samples from patients at the [[International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh|International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease]] in [[Dhaka, Bangladesh]]. From the various experiments they conducted, the researchers found a correlation between the passage of ''V. cholerae'' through the human digestive system and an increased infectivity state. Furthermore, the researchers found the bacterium creates a hyperinfected state where [[gene]]s that control biosynthesis of [[amino acid]]s, [[iron]] uptake systems, and formation of periplasmic nitrate reductase complexes were induced just before defecation. These induced characteristics allow the cholera vibrios to survive in the "rice water" stools, an environment of limited oxygen and iron, of patients with a cholera infection.<ref name="Merrell2002">{{cite journal |author=Merrell DS, Butler SM, Qadri F, ''et al.'' |title=Host-induced epidemic spread of the cholera bacterium |journal=Nature |volume=417 |issue=6889 |pages=642–5 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12050664 |pmc=2776822 |doi=10.1038/nature00778 |ref=harv}}</ref>

In many developing countries, cholera still reaches its victims through contaminated water sources, and countries without proper sanitation techniques have greater incidence of the disease.<ref>"Cholera vaccines.

According to [[Rita R. Colwell]] of the [[James Baker Institute]], if cholera does begin to spread, government preparedness is crucial. A government's ability to contain the disease before it extends to other areas can prevent a high death toll and the development of an epidemic or even pandemic. Effective disease surveillance can ensure that cholera outbreaks are recognized as soon as possible and dealt with appropriately. Oftentimes, this will allow public health programs to determine and control the cause of the cases, whether it is unsanitary water or seafood that have accumulated a lot of ''Vibrio cholerae'' specimens.<ref name="bakerinstitute.org"/>  Having an effective surveillance program contributes to a government’s ability to prevent cholera from spreading. In the year 2000 in the state of Kerala in India, the Kottayam district was determined to be "cholera-affected"; this pronouncement led to task forces that concentrated on educating citizens with 13,670 information sessions about human health.<ref name="John, T. Jacob 2004">John, T. Jacob, K. Rajappan, and K. K. Arjunan. "Communicable diseases monitored by disease surveillance in Kottayam district, Kerala state, India." Indian Journal of Medical Research 120 (2004): 86-93.</ref> These task forces promoted the boiling of water to obtain safe water, and provided chlorine and oral rehydration salts.<ref name="John, T. Jacob 2004"/>  Ultimately, this helped to control the spread of the disease to other areas and minimize deaths. On the other hand, researchers have shown that most of the citizens infected during the 1991 cholera outbreak in Bangladesh lived in rural areas, and were not recognized by the government's surveillance program. This inhibited physicians' abilities to detect cholera cases early.<ref name="books.google.com">Siddique, AK. “Cholera Epidemics in Bangladesh: 1985-1991.” Journal of Diarrhoeal Diseases Research  Volume 10, Number 2 (1992): 79. http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=qE5qb2v8_DEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA79&dq=cholera+government&ots=v8PY4Uron_&sig=02ZLs7qKUcbFdwgLdwrrSeHgqmY#v=onepage&q=cholera%20government&f=false.

According to Colwell, the quality and inclusiveness of a country's health care system affects the control of cholera, as it did in the [[Zimbabwean cholera outbreak]].<ref name="bakerinstitute.org"/> While sanitation practices are important, when governments respond quickly and have readily available vaccines, the country will have a lower cholera death toll. Affordability of vaccines can be a problem; if the governments do not provide vaccinations, only the wealthy may be able to afford them and there will be a greater toll on the country's poor.<ref name="sciencedirect.com">DeRoeck, Denise.
