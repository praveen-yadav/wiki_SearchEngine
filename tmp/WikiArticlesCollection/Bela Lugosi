'''Béla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó''' (20 October 1882 – 16 August 1956), better known as '''Bela Lugosi''', was a Hungarian-American actor, famous for portraying [[Count Dracula]] in the [[Dracula (1931 film)| original 1931 film]] and for his roles in various other [[horror films]].

He had been playing small parts on the stage in his native Hungary before making his first film in 1917, but had to leave the country after [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|the failed Hungarian Revolution]].  He had roles in several films in Weimar Germany before crossing the Atlantic and arriving in America as a seaman on a merchant ship.

In 1927, he appeared as Count Dracula in a Broadway adaptation of [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel, where he was talent-spotted as a character actor for the new [[Hollywood]] talkies. He would appear in the classic 1931 Dracula talkie by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].

Through the 1930s, he occupied an important niche in popular horror films, with their East European setting, but his Hungarian accent limited his repertoire, and he tried unsuccessfully to avoid typecasting. Meanwhile, he was often paired with [[Boris Karloff]], who was able to demand top billing. To his frustration, Lugosi was increasingly restricted to minor parts, kept employed by the studio principally for the sake of his name on the posters. Among his pairings with Karloff, only in ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1934), ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'' (1935), and ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939) did he perform major roles again, although even in ''The Raven'' Karloff received top billing despite Lugosi performing the lead role.

By this time, Lugosi had been receiving regular medication for [[sciatica|sciatic neuritis]], and he had become addicted to morphine and methadone. This drug dependence was noted by producers, and the offers eventually dwindled down to a few parts in [[Ed Wood]]'s low-budget movies.

Lugosi was married five times, and had one son, Bela George Lugosi. His widow Hope Lininger died in 1997 at 77.

==Career==

===Early films===
Lugosi's first film appearance was in the movie ''[[The Colonel (1917 film)|Az ezredes]]'' (''The Colonel'', 1917). When appearing in [[Cinema of Hungary|Hungarian]] [[silent film]]s, he used the stage name '''Arisztid Olt'''. Lugosi made 12 films in Hungary between 1917 and 1918 before leaving for Germany. Following the collapse of [[Béla Kun]]'s [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] in 1919, [[political left|leftists]] and [[trade union]]ists became vulnerable. Lugosi was proscribed from acting due to his participation in the formation of an actors’ [[labor union|union]]. In exile in Germany, he began appearing in a small number of well received films, including adaptations of the [[Karl May]] novels, ''[[On the Brink of Paradise|Auf den Trümmern des Paradieses]]'' (''On the Brink of Paradise''), and ''[[Caravan of Death (film)|Die Todeskarawane]]'' (''The Caravan of Death''), opposite the [[Jewish]] actress [[Dora Gerson]] (who was murdered at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]). Lugosi left Germany in October 1920, intending to emigrate to the United States, and entered the country at [[New Orleans]] in December 1920. He made his way to [[New York]] and was legally inspected for immigration at [[Ellis Island]] in March 1921.<ref>Passenger list of the S.S. ''Graf Tisza Istvan'', port of New Orleans, 4 December 1920, with later notation.</ref> He declared his intention to become a U.S. citizen in 1928, and on June 26, 1931, he was [[naturalization|naturalized]].<ref>Ancestry.com. ''Selected U.S. Naturalization Records — Original Documents, 1790–1974 (World Archives Project)'' [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2009.</ref>

On his arrival in America, the {{convert|6|ft|1|in|m|adj=on}}, {{convert|180|lb|kg}} Lugosi worked for some time as a laborer, then entered the theater in New York City's Hungarian immigrant colony. With fellow Hungarian actors he formed a small [[repertory|stock company]] that toured Eastern cities, playing for immigrant audiences. He acted in his first [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play, ''The Red Poppy'', in 1922. Three more parts came in 1925–1926, including a five-month run in the comedy-fantasy ''The Devil in the Cheese''.<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=50322 Bela Lugosi], [[Internet Broadway Database]].</ref> In 1925, he appeared as an Arab Sheik in ''Arabesque'' which premiered in [[Buffalo, New York]] at the Teck Theatre before moving to Broadway.<ref>http://beladraculalugosi.wordpress.com/bela-lugosi-on-the-on-stage/ Bela Lugosi premieres in Buffalo, NY</ref> His first American film role came in the 1923 melodrama ''[[The Silent Command]]''. Several more silent roles followed, as villains or continental types, all in productions made in the New York area.

===''Dracula''===
[[File:Bela Lugosi as Dracula-2.jpg|thumb|Lugosi in ''[[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]]'']]
[[File:Bela Lugosi as Dracula, anonymous photograph from 1931, Universal Studios.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Lugosi as [[Dracula]]]]
Lugosi was approached in the summer of 1927<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Rhodes |first1=Gary Don |title=Lugosi: his life in films, on stage, and in the hearts of horror lovers |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Aueo3mOrIKIC&pg=PA169 |format=[[Google Books]] |accessdate=2009-02-18 |year=1997 |page=169 |chapter=Stage Appearances}}</ref> to star in a Broadway production of ''[[Dracula (1924 play)|Dracula]]'' adapted by [[Hamilton Deane]] and [[John L. Balderston]] from [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[Dracula (novel)|novel]]. The [[Horace Liveright]] production was successful, running 261 performances before touring. He was soon called to Hollywood for character parts in early [[talkies]].

Despite his critically acclaimed performance on stage, Lugosi was not [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]’ first choice for the role of Dracula when the company optioned the rights to the Deane play and began production in 1930. A persistent rumor asserts that director [[Tod Browning]]'s long-time collaborator, [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]], was Universal's first choice for the role, and that Lugosi was chosen only due to Chaney's death shortly before production. This is questionable, because Chaney had been under long-term contract to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] since 1925, and had negotiated a lucrative new contract just before his death.

Chaney and Browning had worked together on several projects (including four of Chaney's final five releases), but Browning was only a last-minute choice to direct the movie version of ''Dracula'' after the death of director [[Paul Leni]], who was originally slated to direct.
In 1927, Lugosi accepted the titular role in the American theatrical run of Dracula, a play based on Bram Stoker's gothic novel of the same name.

Lugosi's Dracula was unlike any previous portrayals of the role. Handsome, mysterious and alluring, Lugosi's Dracula was at once so sexy and so haunting that audiences gasped when he first opened his mouth to speak. After a half-year run on Broadway, Dracula toured the United States to much fanfare and critical acclaim throughout 1928 and 1929. 

His portrayal of Dracula was so successful that Universal decided to make a movie of Dracula starring Lugosi. The film, [[Dracula (1931 film)|''Dracula'']], was a considerable hit and forever immortalized the portrayal of Lugosi's Dracula.

Although countless actors have played Dracula since, to this date vampire enthusiasts idolize Lugosi as synonymous with the character- not least of which because the actor was actually born in Transylvania.  Lugosi's body of work established him as a star of the horror genre, with Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre as his only real rivals in Hollywood. Nevertheless, throughout his entire career Lugosi was frustrated by his inability to break through into other types of films. "I am definitely typed, doomed to be an exponent of evil," he said. In the 1940s, when he worked as Dracula, he spoke as much about his personal tradition as about his character when he spoke his immortal phrase "I am Dracula".

===Typecasting===
[[File:Irene Ware and Bela Lugosi in The Raven.jpg|thumb|left|[[Irene Ware]] and Lugosi]]
Through his association with Dracula (in which he appeared with minimal makeup, using his natural, heavily accented voice), Lugosi found himself [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as a [[horror film|horror]] villain in such movies as ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'', ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'', and ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' for Universal, and the independent ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]''. His accent, while a part of his image, limited the roles he could play.

Lugosi did attempt to break type by auditioning for other roles. He lost out to [[Lionel Barrymore]] for the role of [[Rasputin]] in ''[[Rasputin and the Empress]]''; [[C. Henry Gordon]] for the role of Surat Khan in ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936 film)|Charge of the Light Brigade]]''; [[Basil Rathbone]] for the role of Commissar Dimitri Gorotchenko in ''[[Tovarich (film)|Tovarich]]'' (a role Lugosi had played on stage). He did play the elegant, somewhat hot-tempered Gen. Nicholas Strenovsky-Petronovich in ''[[International House (1933 film)|International House]]'', an ensemble comedy also featuring [[W. C. Fields]], [[George Burns]], [[Gracie Allen]], [[Cab Calloway]] and [[Rose Marie|Baby Rose Marie]].

Regardless of controversy, five films at Universal — ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'', ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'', ''[[The Invisible Ray (1936 film)|The Invisible Ray]]'', ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Black Friday (1940 film)|Black Friday]]'' (plus minor cameo performances in 1934's ''[[Gift of Gab (1934 film)|Gift of Gab]]'') and two at [[RKO Pictures]], ''[[You'll Find Out]]'' and ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]'' — paired Lugosi with [[Boris Karloff]]. Despite the relative size of their roles, Lugosi inevitably got second billing, below Karloff. Lugosi's attitude toward Karloff is the subject of contradictory reports, some claiming that he was openly resentful of Karloff's long-term success and ability to get good roles beyond the horror arena, while others suggested the two actors were — for a time, at least — good friends. Karloff himself in interviews suggested that Lugosi was initially mistrustful of him when they acted together, believing that the Englishman would attempt to upstage him. When this proved not to be the case, according to Karloff, Lugosi settled down and they worked together amicably (though some have further commented that Karloff's on-set demand to break from filming for mid-afternoon tea annoyed Lugosi). Karloff also insinuated that his iconic rival could not act, claiming that Lugosi "never learned his trade."

Universal did wind up giving Lugosi a couple of heroic parts, as in ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' after Karloff had been accorded the more colorful role of the villain, ''[[The Invisible Ray (1936 film)|The Invisible Ray]]'', and a romantic role in the adventure serial ''[[The Return of Chandu]]'', but his typecasting problem appears to have been too entrenched to be alleviated by those films.

Lugosi addressed his plea to be cast in non-horror roles directly to casting directors through his listing in the 1937 [https://www.playersdirectory.com/index.php Players Directory], published by the Motion Picture Academy, in which he (or his agent) calls the idea that he is only fit for horror films "an error."<ref>Michael Mallory. [http://books.google.com/books/about/Universal_Studios_Monsters.html?id=ZHhOPgAACAAJ Universal Studios Monsters: A Legacy of Horror], 2009, Universe, p. 63. ISBN 978-0-7893-1896-1.</ref>

===Career path===
[[File:Invisible Ghost (1941) 1.jpg|thumb|Lugosi (center) with [[Polly Ann Young]] and [[Clarence Muse]] in ''The Invisible Ghost'']]
A number of factors worked against Lugosi's career in the mid-1930s. Universal changed management in 1936, and because of a British ban on horror films, dropped them from their production schedule; Lugosi found himself consigned to Universal's non-horror [[B-movie|B-film]] unit, at times in small roles where he was obviously used for "name value" only. Throughout the 1930s, Lugosi, experiencing a severe career decline despite popularity with audiences (Universal executives always preferred his rival Karloff), accepted many leading roles from independent producers like Nat Levine, [[Sol Lesser]], and [[Sam Katzman]]. These low-budget thrillers indicate that Lugosi was less discriminating than Karloff in selecting screen vehicles, but the exposure helped Lugosi financially if not artistically. Lugosi tried to keep busy with stage work, but had to borrow money from the Actors' Fund to pay hospital bills when his only child, Bela George Lugosi, was born in 1938.

Historian John McElwee reports, in his 2013 book "Showmen, Sell It Hot!", that Bela Lugosi's popularity received a much-needed boost in August 1938, when California theater owner Emil Umann revived ''Dracula'' and ''Frankenstein'' as a special double feature. The combination was so successful that Umann scheduled extra shows to accommodate the capacity crowds, and invited Lugosi to appear in person, which thrilled new audiences that had never seen Lugosi's classic performance. "I owe it all to that little man at the Regina Theatre," said Lugosi of exhibitor Umann. "I was dead, and he brought me back to life." Universal took notice of the tremendous business and launched its own national re-release of the same two horror favorites. The studio then rehired Lugosi to star in new films.

The first was Universal's ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939), when he played the character role of [[Igor (fictional character)|Ygor]], who uses the Monster for his own revenge, in heavy makeup and beard. The same year saw Lugosi playing a straight character role in a major motion picture: he was a stern commissar in [[MGM]]'s comedy ''[[Ninotchka]]'', starring [[Greta Garbo]]. This small but prestigious role could have been a turning point for the actor, but within the year he was back on Hollywood's [[Poverty Row]], playing leads for Sam Katzman. These horror, comedy and [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] B-films were released by [[Monogram Pictures]]. At Universal, he often received star billing for what amounted to a supporting part. ''[[The Gorilla (1939 film)|The Gorilla]]'' (1939) had him playing [[double act|straight man]] to [[Patsy Kelly]], in a role she told author [[Boze Hadleigh]] was her finest part.
[[File:LugosiDevilBat1.jpg|thumb|right|Lugosi in ''[[The Devil Bat]]'']]
Ostensibly due to injuries received during military service, Lugosi developed severe, chronic [[sciatica]]. Though at first he was treated with pain remedies such as [[asparagus]] juice, doctors increased the medication to [[opiate]]s. The growth of his dependence on pain-killers, particularly [[morphine]] and [[methadone]], was directly proportional to the dwindling of screen offers. He was finally cast in the role of Frankenstein's monster for Universal's ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' (1943), which this time contained dialogue (Lugosi's voice had been dubbed over that of [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]], from line readings at the end of ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942) because Ygor's brain had been transplanted into the Monster). Lugosi continued to play the Monster with Ygor's consciousness but with groping gestures because the Monster was now blind. Ultimately, all of the Monster's dialogue and all references to his sightlessness were edited out of the released film, leaving a strange, maimed performance characterized by unexplained gestures and lip movements with no words coming out. He also came to recreate the role of Dracula a second and last time on film in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948). By this time, Lugosi's drug use was so notorious that the producers were not even aware that Lugosi was still alive, and had penciled in actor [[Ian Keith]] for the role.

''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' was Bela Lugosi's last "A" movie. For the remainder of his life he appeared — less and less frequently — in obscure, low-budget features. From 1947 to 1950, he performed in [[summer stock]], often in productions of ''Dracula'' or ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'', and during the rest of the year made personal appearances in a touring "spook show" and on early commercial television. In September 1949 [[Milton Berle]] invited Lugosi to appear in a sketch on ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]''.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/9-27-1949/episode/670241/summary.htmlTexaco Star Theater Episode Guide]</ref> Lugosi memorized the script for the skit, but became confused on the air when Berle began to ad lib.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weaver|first=Tom |title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Film Flashbacks: Conversations with 24 Actors, Writers, Producers and Directors from the Golden Age|publisher=McFarland|year=2004|pages=160|isbn=0-7864-2070-7}}</ref> His only television dramatic role was on the anthology series ''Suspense'' on October 11, 1949 in the episode ''The Cask of Amontillado''.<ref>The Complete Actors' Television Credits, 1948–1988, James Robert Parrish and Vincent Terrace</ref>

In 1951, while in [[England]] to play a six-month tour of ''Dracula'', he co-starred in a lowbrow movie comedy, ''Mother Riley Meets the Vampire'' (also known as ''Vampire over London'' and ''My Son, the Vampire''). Following his return to America, Lugosi was interviewed for television, and reflected wistfully on his typecasting in horror parts: "Now I am the boogie man." In the same interview he expressed a desire to play more comedy, as he had in the Mother Riley farce. Independent producer Jack Broder took Lugosi at his word, casting him in a jungle-themed comedy, ''[[Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla]]'' co-starring nightclub comedians [[Duke Mitchell]] and [[Sammy Petrillo]], whose act closely resembled that of [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]].

===Ed Wood and final projects===
[[File:PlanNine 08.jpg|thumb|Lugosi in Ed Wood's ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'', 1959]]
Late in his life, Bela Lugosi again received star billing in movies when ambitious filmmaker [[Ed Wood]], a fan of Lugosi, found him living in obscurity and near-poverty and offered him roles in his films, such as an anonymous narrator in ''[[Glen or Glenda]]'' and a [[Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Frankenstein]]-like [[mad scientist]] in ''[[Bride of the Monster]]''. During [[post-production]] of the latter, Lugosi decided to seek treatment for his [[drug addiction]], and the premiere of the film was said to be intended to help pay for his hospital expenses. According to [[Kitty Kelley]]'s biography of [[Frank Sinatra]], when the entertainer heard of Lugosi's problems, he helped with expenses and visited at the hospital. Lugosi would recall his amazement, since he did not even know Sinatra.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kelley|first=Kitty |title=His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1987|pages=248|isbn=0-553-26515-6}}</ref>

During an impromptu interview upon his exit from the treatment center in 1955, Lugosi stated that he was about to go to work on a new Ed Wood film, ''The Ghoul Goes West''. This was one of several projects proposed by Wood, including ''The Phantom Ghoul'' and ''Dr. Acula''. With Lugosi in his famed Dracula cape, Wood shot impromptu test footage, with no storyline in mind, in front of [[Tor Johnson]]'s home, a suburban graveyard and in front of Lugosi's apartment building on Carlton Way. This footage ended up in ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'', which was mostly filmed after Lugosi's death. Wood hired [[Tom Mason]], his wife's [[chiropractor]], to double for Lugosi in additional shots.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lostmag.com/issue18/lugosi.php|title=Bela Lugosi's Legacy|last=Nuzum |first=Eric |work = Lost |accessdate=2008-10-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080917071843/http://www.lostmag.com/issue18/lugosi.php| archivedate= 17 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Mason was noticeably taller and thinner than Lugosi, and had the lower half of his face covered with his cape in every shot, as Lugosi sometimes did in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''.

Following his treatment, Lugosi made one final film, in late 1955, ''[[The Black Sleep]]'', for Bel-Air Pictures, which was released in the summer of 1956 through [[United Artists]] with a promotional campaign that included several personal appearances. To his disappointment, however, his role in this film was of a [[Muteness|mute]], with no dialogue.

==Personal life==
[[File:Béla Lugosi-Angelo Rossitto in Scared to Death.jpg|thumb|left|With [[Angelo Rossitto]] in ''[[Scared to Death]]'' (1947)]]
In 1917, Lugosi married Ilona Szmick. The couple divorced in 1920, reputedly over political differences with her parents.

In 1929, Lugosi took his place in Hollywood society and scandal when he married wealthy [[San Francisco]] widow Beatrice Weeks, but she filed for divorce four months later. Weeks cited actress [[Clara Bow]] as the "other woman".<ref>Arthur Lennig, ''The Immortal Count'', University Press of Kentucky, 2003, p. 68. ISBN 978-0-8131-2273-1.</ref>

In 1933 he married 19-year-old Lillian Arch, the daughter of Hungarian immigrants. They had a child, [[Bela G. Lugosi]], in 1938.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Friedemann O’Brien Goldberg & Zarian Names Bela G.

Lillian and Bela, as well as his mother, vacationed on their lake property in the Southern California community of Lake Elsinore (then called Elsinore) on two lots between 1944 and 1953. Bela Lugosi Jr., attended the Elsinore Naval & Military School in Lake Elsinore.
Lillian and Béla divorced in 1953,<ref name=arch/> at least partially because of Béla's jealousy over Lillian taking a full-time job as an assistant to [[Brian Donlevy]] on the sets and studios for Donlevy's radio and television series ''Dangerous Assignment''<ref>Arthur Lennig, ''The Immortal Count'', University Press of Kentucky, 2003, p. 393. ISBN 978-0-8131-2273-1.</ref> — Lillian eventually did marry Brian Donlevy, in 1966.

Lugosi married Hope Lininger, his fifth wife, in 1955. She had been a fan of his, writing letters to him when he was in hospital recovering from addiction to [[Demerol]]. She would sign her letters 'A dash of Hope'.

==Death==

Lugosi was buried wearing one of the ''Dracula''  Cape costumes, per the request of his son and fifth wife, in the [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]]. Contrary to popular belief, Lugosi never requested to be buried in his cloak; [[Bela G. Lugosi]] confirmed on numerous occasions that he and his mother, Lillian, actually made the decision but believed that it is what his father would have wanted.<ref>[[Bela G.

==Legacy==
In 1979, the ''[[Lugosi v. Universal Pictures]]'' decision by the [[California Supreme Court]] held that Bela Lugosi's [[personality rights]] could not pass to his heirs, as a [[copyright]] would have. The court ruled that under California law any rights of publicity, including the right to his image, terminated with Lugosi's death.<ref name=findlaw>{{cite web |url=http://library.findlaw.com/1998/Feb/1/130405.html |title=Lugosi v. Universal Pictures, 603 P.2d 425 (Cal. 1979). |accessdate=2007-02-14 |quote=In this decision preceding (and precipitating) the Legislature's enactment of Section 990, the California Supreme Court held that rights of publicity were not descendible in California. Bela Lugosi's heirs, Hope Linninger Lugosi and Bela George Lugosi, sued to enjoin and recover profits from Universal Pictures for licensing Lugosi's name and image on merchandise reprising Lugosi's title role in the 1931 film ''Dracula''. The [[California Supreme Court]] faced the question whether Bela Lugosi's film contracts with Universal included a grant of merchandising rights in his portrayal of Count Dracula, and the descendibility of any such rights. Adopting the opinion of Justice Roth for the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, the court held that the right to exploit one's name and likeness is personal to the artist and must be exercised, if at all, by him during his lifetime.

In [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', Lugosi is played by [[Martin Landau]], who received the 1994 [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. According to [[Bela G. Lugosi]] (his son), [[Forrest Ackerman]], [[Dolores Fuller]] and Richard Sheffield, Lugosi never used profanity, owned small dogs, or slept in coffins. The film fabricated much about the Hungarian actor.

Three Lugosi projects were featured on the television show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. ''[[The Corpse Vanishes]]'' appeared in episode 105, the serial ''[[The Phantom Creeps]]'' throughout season two and the Ed Wood production ''[[Bride of the Monster]]'' in episode 423.
An episode of ''[[Sledge Hammer]]'' titled "Last of the Red Hot Vampires" was a homage to Bela Lugosi; at the end of the episode, it was dedicated to "Mr. Blasko".
In 2001, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast ''There Are Such Things'' by [[Steven McNicoll]] and Mark McDonnell. Focusing on Lugosi and his well-documented struggle to escape from the role that had typecast him, the play went on to receive the Hamilton Dean Award for best dramatic presentation from the Dracula Society in 2002.
A statue of Lugosi can be seen today on one of the corners of the [[Vajdahunyad Castle]] in [[Budapest]].
The [[Ellis Island]] Immigration Museum in [[New York City]] features a live, 30-minute play that focuses on Lugosi's illegal entry into the country and then his arrival at Ellis Island to enter the country legally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ellisisland.org/genealogy/ellis_island_visiting.asp|title=Visiting the Ellis Island Immigration Museum|publisher=ellisisland.org}}</ref>

The cape Lugosi wore in ''[[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]]'' (1931) still survives today in the ownership of Universal Studios.

The theatrical play ''Lugosi - a vámpír árnyéka'' (''Lugosi - the Shadow of the Vampire'', in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) is based on Lugosi's life, telling the story of his life as he becomes typecast as Dracula and as his drug addiction worsens. He was played by one of Hungary's most renowned actors, [[Ivan Darvas]].
Andy Warhol's 1963 silkscreen ''The Kiss'' depicts Lugosi from ''[[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]]'' about to bite into the neck of co-star [[Helen Chandler]], who played [[Mina Harker]]. A copy sold for $798,000 at [[Christie's]] in May 2000.<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1787949 Christies: Andy Warhol (1928–1987): The Kiss (Bela Lugosi)]</ref>
Lugosi was also the subject of "[[Bela Lugosi's Dead]]", the first single by [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], released in August 1979 it is often considered to be the first [[gothic rock]] record.

Bela Lugosi was a charter member of the [[United States|American]] [[Screen Actors Guild]].
