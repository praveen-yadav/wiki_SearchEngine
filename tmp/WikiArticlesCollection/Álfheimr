'''Alfheim''' ({{Lang-non|Ālfheimr}}, "elf home") is one of the [[Nine Worlds]] and home of the [[Álfar|Light Elves]] in [[Norse mythology]].

==In Old Norse texts==
{{Also|Svartálfaheimr}}
Álfheim as an abode of the Elves is mentioned only twice in [[Old Norse]] texts.

The [[eddic poem]] ''[[Grímnismál]]'' describes twelve divine dwellings beginning in stanza&nbsp;5 with:
<blockquote>[[Ýdalir]] call they &nbsp; &nbsp; the place where [[Ullr|Ull]]<br/>
A hall for himself hath set;<br/>
And Álfheim the gods &nbsp; &nbsp; to [[Freyr|Frey]] once gave<br/>
As a tooth-gift in ancient times.</blockquote>

A tooth-gift was a gift given to an [[infant]] on the cutting of the first tooth.

In the 12th century eddic prose ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', [[Snorri Sturluson]] relates it as the first of a series of abodes in heaven:
<blockquote>That which is called Álfheim is one, where dwell the peoples called ''[[ljósálfar]]'' [Light Elves]; but the ''[[dökkálfar]]'' [Dark Elves] dwell down in the earth, and they are unlike in appearance, but by far more unlike in nature. The Light-elves are fairer to look upon than the sun, but the Dark-elves are blacker than pitch.
</blockquote>
The account later, in speaking of a hall called [[Gimlé]] and the southernmost end of heaven that shall survive when heaven and earth have died, explains:
<blockquote>It is said that another heaven is to the southward and upward of this one, and it is called [[Andlang]] [''Andlangr'' 'Endlong'] but the third heaven is yet above that, and it is called [[Vídbláin]] [''Vídbláinn'' 'Wide-blue'] and in that heaven we think this abode is. But we believe that none but Light-Elves inhabit these mansions now.</blockquote>
It is not indicated whether these heavens are identical to Álfheim or distinct. Some texts read Vindbláin (''Vindbláinn'' 'Wind-blue') instead of Vídbláin.

Modern commentators speculate (or sometimes state as fact) that Álfheim was one of the nine worlds (''heima'') mentioned in stanza&nbsp;2 of the eddic poem ''[[Völuspá]]''.

In Icelandic books called [[Kjalnesingasaga]] (Kjalnesing stories), Búi, 13 year old enters Álfheimr in order to find a token, property of [[Dofri]], king of the elves. There he meets daughter of the [[Dofri]], [[Fríður]] was her name which means beautiful, and when night falls they would go to her room, and "Have fun all night long". Later she helps Búi find the token and at the same time she tells Búi that she is carrying his baby. Búi must then return with the token to king of Norway and when they say goodbye, she tells him that if the baby was a girl, she would raise it, but if it was a boy, she would send it to Búi at 12 years of age. If Búi would not welcome him, he would suffer. 12 years later a boy named Jökull sails from Norway to meet Búi. Jökull claims that he is Son of Búi and Fríður but Búi denies, "My son is not small and lousy, he is strong and mighty!" he said. Búi insisted on a battle to prove his words but Fríður was with him.

==Popular culture==
* [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] anglicized ''Álfheim'' as ''Elvenhome'', or ''[[Aman#Eldamar|Eldamar]]'' in the [[Quenya|speech of the Elves]]. In his stories, Eldamar lies in a coastal region of the [[Undying Lands]] in the Uttermost West. The High King of the Elves in the West was [[Ingwë]], an echo of the name [[Yngvi]] often found as a name for Frey, whose abode was in ''Álfheim'' according to the ''Grímnismál''.
* In anime and light novel, ''[[Sword Art Online]]'', setting for the second arc is based on Álfheimr, referred to as Alfheim.
