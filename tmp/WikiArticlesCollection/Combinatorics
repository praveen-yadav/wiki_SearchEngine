{{distinguish|combinatoriality}}
'''Combinatorics''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] concerning the study of finite or [[Countable set|countable]] [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] [[Mathematical structure|structures]]. Aspects of combinatorics include counting the structures of a given kind and size ([[enumerative combinatorics]]), deciding when certain criteria can be met, and constructing and analyzing objects meeting the criteria (as in [[combinatorial design]]s and [[matroid]] theory), finding "largest", "smallest", or "optimal" objects ([[extremal combinatorics]] and [[combinatorial optimization]]), and studying combinatorial structures arising in an [[algebra]]ic context, or applying algebraic techniques to combinatorial problems ([[algebraic combinatorics]]).

Combinatorial problems arise in many areas of pure mathematics, notably in [[algebra]], [[probability theory]], [[topology]], and [[geometry]],<ref>Björner and Stanley, p. 2</ref> and combinatorics also has many applications in [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], [[computer science]], [[ergodic theory]] and [[statistical physics]]. Many combinatorial questions have historically been considered in isolation, giving an ''ad hoc'' solution to a problem arising in some mathematical context. In the later twentieth century, however, powerful and general theoretical methods were developed, making combinatorics into an independent branch of mathematics in its own right. One of the oldest and most accessible parts of combinatorics is [[graph theory]], which also has numerous natural connections to other areas.  Combinatorics is used frequently in [[computer science]] to obtain formulas and estimates in the [[analysis of algorithms]].

A [[mathematician]] who studies combinatorics is called a ''combinatorialist''.

{{main|History of combinatorics}}

Basic combinatorial concepts and enumerative results appeared throughout the [[Ancient history|ancient world]]. In 6th century BCE, [[physician]] [[Sushruta]] asserts in [[Sushruta Samhita]] that 63 combinations can be made out of 6 different tastes, taken one at a time, two at a time, etc., thus computing all 2<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 possibilities.  [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historian]] [[Plutarch]] discusses an argument between [[Chrysippus]] (3rd century BCE) and [[Hipparchus]] (2nd century BCE) of a rather delicate enumerative problem, which was later shown to be related to [[Schröder number]]s.<ref>[[Richard P. Stanley|Stanley, Richard P.]]; "Hipparchus, Plutarch, Schröder, and Hough", ''American Mathematical Monthly'' '''104''' (1997), no. 4, 344–350.</ref><ref>Habsieger, Laurent; Kazarian, Maxim; and Lando, Sergei; "On the Second Number of Plutarch", ''American Mathematical Monthly'' '''105''' (1998), no. 5, 446.</ref> In the ''[[Ostomachion]]'', [[Archimedes]] (3rd century BCE) considers a [[tiling puzzle]].

In the [[Middle Ages]], combinatorics continued to be studied, largely outside of the [[Culture of Europe|European civilization]].  The [[India]]n mathematician [[Mahāvīra (mathematician)|Mahāvīra]] (c. 850) provided formulae for the number of [[permutation]]s and [[combination]]s,<ref>{{MacTutor | id=Mahavira}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Puttaswamy |first=Tumkur K. |contribution= The Mathematical Accomplishments of Ancient Indian Mathematicians |editor-last=Selin |editor-first=Helaine |title=Mathematics Across Cultures: The History of Non-Western Mathematics |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |location=Netherlands |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2hTyfurOH8AC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-4020-0260-1 |page=417 <!-- pages 409–422 -->}}</ref> and these formulas may have been familiar to Indian mathematicians as early as the 6th century CE.<ref>Biggs, Norman L.; "The Roots of Combinatorics", ''Historia Mathematica'' 6 (1979), 109–136.</ref>  The [[philosopher]] and [[astronomer]] Rabbi [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] (c. 1140) established the symmetry of [[binomial coefficient]]s, while a closed formula was obtained later by the [[talmudist]] and [[mathematician]] [[Levi ben Gerson]] (better known as Gersonides), in 1321.<ref>[http://ncertbooks.prashanthellina.com/class_11.Mathematics.Mathematics/Ch-07(Permutation%20and%20Combinations%20FINAL%20%2004.01.06).pdf History of Combinatorics], chapter in a textbook.</ref>
The arithmetical triangle— a graphical diagram showing relationships among the binomial coefficients— was presented by mathematicians in treatises dating as far back as the 10th century, and would eventually become known as [[Pascal's triangle]]. Later, in [[Medieval England]], [[campanology]] provided examples of what is now known as [[Hamiltonian cycle]]s in certain [[Cayley graph]]s on permutations.<ref>

During the [[Renaissance]], together with the rest of mathematics and the [[science]]s, combinatorics enjoyed a rebirth. Works of [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Jacob Bernoulli]] and [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] became foundational in the emerging field. In modern times, the works of [[James Joseph Sylvester|J. J. Sylvester]] (late 19th century) and [[Percy Alexander MacMahon|Percy MacMahon]] (early 20th century) laid the foundation for [[Enumerative combinatorics|enumerative]] and [[algebraic combinatorics]]. [[Graph theory]] also enjoyed an explosion of interest at the same time, especially in connection with the [[four color problem]].

In the second half of 20th century, combinatorics enjoyed a rapid growth, which led to establishment of dozens of new journals and conferences in the subject.<ref>See [http://www.math.iit.edu/~kaul/Journals.html#CGT Journals in Combinatorics and Graph Theory]</ref> In part, the growth was spurred by new connections and applications to other fields, ranging from algebra to probability, from [[functional analysis]] to [[number theory]], etc.  These connections shed the boundaries between combinatorics and parts of mathematics and theoretical computer science, but at the same time led to a partial fragmentation of the field.

== Approaches and subfields of combinatorics ==

===Enumerative combinatorics===
[[Image:Catalan 4 leaves binary tree example.svg|320px|right|thumb|Five [[binary tree]]s on three [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]], an example of [[Catalan number]]s.]]

{{main|Enumerative combinatorics}}

Enumerative combinatorics is the most classical area of combinatorics, and concentrates on counting the number of certain combinatorial objects.  Although counting the number of elements in a set is a rather broad [[mathematical problem]], many of the problems that arise in applications have a relatively simple combinatorial description. [[Fibonacci numbers]] is the basic example of a problem in enumerative combinatorics.  The [[twelvefold way]] provides a unified framework for counting [[permutations]], [[combinations]] and [[Partition of a set|partitions]].

===Analytic combinatorics===
{{main|Analytic combinatorics}}

Analytic combinatorics concerns the enumeration of combinatorial structures using tools from [[complex analysis]] and [[probability theory]].  In contrast with enumerative combinatorics which uses explicit combinatorial formulae and [[generating functions]] to describe the results, analytic combinatorics aims at obtaining [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic formulae]].

=== Partition theory ===
[[Image:Partition3D.svg|150px|right|thumb|A [[plane partition]].]]

{{main|Partition (number theory)|l1=Partition theory}}

Partition theory studies various enumeration and asymptotic problems related to [[integer partition]]s, and is closely related to [[q-series]], [[special functions]] and [[orthogonal polynomials]].  Originally a part of [[number theory]] and [[analysis]], it is now considered a part of combinatorics or an independent field.  It incorporates the [[Bijective proof|bijective approach]] and various tools in analysis, [[analytic number theory]], and has connections with [[statistical mechanics]].

===Graph theory===
[[Image:Petersen1 tiny.svg|thumb|150px|[[Petersen graph]].]]
{{main|Graph theory}}

Graphs are basic objects in combinatorics.  The questions range from counting (e.g., the number of graphs on ''n'' vertices with ''k'' edges) to structural (e.g., which graphs contain Hamiltonian cycles) to algebraic questions (e.g., given a graph ''G'' and two numbers ''x'' and ''y'', does the [[Tutte polynomial]] ''T''<sub>''G''</sub>(''x'',''y'') have a combinatorial interpretation?).  It should be noted that while there are very strong connections between graph theory and combinatorics, these two are sometimes thought of as separate subjects.<ref>Sanders, Daniel P.; [http://www.math.gatech.edu/~sanders/graphtheory/writings/2-digit.html ''2-Digit MSC Comparison'']</ref>

===Design theory===
{{main|Combinatorial design}}

Design theory is a study of [[combinatorial design]]s, which are collections of subsets with certain [[Set intersection|intersection]] properties. [[Block design]]s are combinatorial designs of a special type. This area is one of the oldest parts of combinatorics, such as in [[Kirkman's schoolgirl problem]] proposed in 1850. The solution of the problem is a special case of a [[Steiner system]], which systems play an important role in the [[classification of finite simple groups]]. The area has further connections to coding theory and geometric combinatorics.

===Finite geometry===
{{main|Finite geometry}}

Finite geometry is the study of [[Geometry|geometric systems]] having only a finite number of points. Structures analogous to those found in continuous geometries ([[Euclidean plane]], [[real projective space]], etc.) but defined combinatorially are the main items studied. This area provides a rich source of examples for [[Combinatorial design|Design theory]]. It should not be confused with Discrete geometry ([[Combinatorial geometry]]).

=== Order theory ===
[[Image:Hasse diagram of powerset of 3.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Hasse diagram]] of the [[Power set|powerset]] of {x,y,z} ordered by [[Inclusion map|inclusion]].]]

{{main|Order theory}}

Order theory is the study of [[partially ordered sets]], both finite and infinite.  Various examples of partial orders appear in [[abstract algebra|algebra]], geometry, number theory and throughout combinatorics and graph theory.  Notable classes and examples of partial orders include [[Lattice (order)|lattices]] and [[Boolean algebras]].

===Matroid theory===
{{main|Matroid theory}}
Matroid theory abstracts part of [[geometry]].   It studies the properties of sets (usually, finite sets) of vectors in a [[vector space]] that do not depend on the particular coefficients in a [[linear independence|linear dependence]] relation.  Not only the structure but also enumerative properties belong to matroid theory.  Matroid theory was introduced by [[Hassler Whitney]] and studied as a part of the order theory.  It is now an independent field of study with a number of connections with other parts of combinatorics.

===Extremal combinatorics===
{{main|Extremal combinatorics}}

Extremal combinatorics studies extremal questions on [[set system]]s. The types of questions addressed in this case are about the largest possible graph which satisfies certain properties.  For example, the largest triangle-free graph on ''2n'' vertices is a [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K<sub>n,n</sub>''. Often it is too hard even to find the extremal answer ''f''(''n'') exactly and one can only give an [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic estimate]].

[[Ramsey theory]] is another part of extremal combinatorics.  It states that any [[sufficiently large]] configuration will contain some sort of order. It is an advanced generalization of the [[pigeonhole principle]].

===Probabilistic combinatorics===
[[Image:Self avoiding walk.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Self-avoiding walk]] in a [[Lattice graph|square grid graph]].]]

{{main|Probabilistic method}}

In probabilistic combinatorics, the questions are of the following type: what is the probability of a certain property for a random discrete object, such as a [[random graph]]? For instance, what is the average number of triangles in a random graph? Probabilistic methods are also used to determine the existence of combinatorial objects with certain prescribed properties (for which explicit examples might be difficult to find), simply by observing that the probability of randomly selecting an object with those properties is greater than 0. This approach (often referred to as ''the'' [[probabilistic method]]) proved highly effective in applications to extremal combinatorics and graph theory. A closely related area is the study of finite [[Markov chains]], especially on combinatorial objects. Here again probabilistic tools are used to estimate the [[Markov chain mixing time|mixing time]].

Often associated with [[Paul Erdős]], who did the pioneer work on the subject, probabilistic combinatorics was traditionally viewed as a set of tools to study problems in other parts of combinatorics. However, with the growth of applications to [[analysis of algorithms]] in [[computer science]], as well as classical probability, [[Additive number theory|additive]] and [[probabilistic number theory]], the area recently grew to become an independent field of combinatorics.

===Algebraic combinatorics===
[[Image:Young diagram for 541 partition.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Young diagram]] of a [[Partition (number theory)|partition]] (5,4,1).]]
{{main|Algebraic combinatorics}}

Algebraic combinatorics is an area of [[mathematics]] that employs methods of [[abstract algebra]], notably [[group theory]] and [[representation theory]], in various combinatorial contexts and, conversely, applies combinatorial techniques to problems in [[abstract algebra|algebra]]. Within the last decade or so, algebraic combinatorics came to be seen more expansively as the area of mathematics where the interaction of combinatorial and algebraic methods is particularly strong and significant. One of the fastest developing subfields within algebraic combinatorics is [[combinatorial commutative algebra]].

===Combinatorics on words===
[[Image:Morse-Thue sequence.gif|thumb|right|210px|Construction of a [[Thue–Morse sequence|Thue–Morse infinite word]].]]

{{main|Combinatorics on words}}

Combinatorics on words deals with [[formal language]]s.  It  arose independently within several branches of mathematics, including [[number theory]], [[group theory]] and [[probability]]. It has applications to enumerative combinatorics, [[fractal analysis]], [[theoretical computer science]], [[automata theory]] and [[linguistics]].  While many applications are new, the classical [[Chomsky–Schützenberger hierarchy]] of classes of [[formal grammar]]s is perhaps the best known result in the field.

===Geometric combinatorics===
[[Image:Icosahedron.svg||150px|thumb|right|An [[icosahedron]].]]

{{main|Geometric combinatorics}}

Geometric combinatorics is related to [[Convex geometry|convex]] and [[discrete geometry]], in particular [[polyhedral combinatorics]].  It asks, for example, how many faces of each dimension can a [[convex polytope]] have.  [[Metric geometry|Metric]] properties of polytopes play an important role as well, e.g. the   [[Cauchy's theorem (geometry)|Cauchy theorem]] on rigidity of convex polytopes.  Special polytopes are also considered, such as [[permutohedron|permutohedra]], [[associahedron|associahedra]] and [[Birkhoff polytope]]s.  We should note that [[combinatorial geometry]] is an old fashioned name for discrete geometry.

===Topological combinatorics===
[[Image:Necklace cropped.png||150px|thumb|right|[[Necklace splitting problem|Splitting a necklace]] with two cuts.]]
{{main|Topological combinatorics}}

Combinatorial analogs of concepts and methods in [[topology]] are used to study [[graph coloring]], [[fair division]], [[partition of a set|partitions]], [[partially ordered set]]s, [[decision tree]]s, [[necklace problem]]s and [[discrete Morse theory]].  It should not be confused with [[combinatorial topology]] which is an older name for [[algebraic topology]].

===Arithmetic combinatorics===
{{main|Arithmetic combinatorics}}

Arithmetic combinatorics arose out of the interplay between [[number theory]], combinatorics, [[ergodic theory]] and [[harmonic analysis]]. It is about combinatorial estimates associated with arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). ''Additive combinatorics'' refers to the special case when only the operations of addition and subtraction are involved.  One important technique in arithmetic combinatorics is the [[ergodic theory]] of [[dynamical system]]s.

===Infinitary combinatorics===
{{main|Infinitary combinatorics}}

Infinitary combinatorics, or combinatorial set theory, is an extension of ideas in combinatorics to infinite sets.  It is a part of [[set theory]], an area of [[mathematical logic]], but uses tools and ideas from both set theory and extremal combinatorics.

[[Gian-Carlo Rota]] used the name ''continuous combinatorics''<ref>[http://faculty.uml.edu/dklain/cpc.pdf ''Continuous and profinite combinatorics'']</ref> to describe [[probability]] and [[measure theory]], since there are many analogies between ''counting'' and ''measure''.

== Related fields ==
[[Image:Kissing-3d.png|150px|right|thumb|[[kissing number|Kissing spheres]] are connected to both [[coding theory]] and [[discrete geometry]].]]

=== Combinatorial optimization ===
[[Combinatorial optimization]] is the study of optimization on discrete and combinatorial objects. It started as a part of combinatorics and graph theory, but is now viewed as a branch of applied mathematics and computer science, related to [[operations research]], [[Analysis of algorithms|algorithm theory]] and [[computational complexity theory]].

=== Coding theory ===
[[Coding theory]] started as a part of design theory with early combinatorial constructions of [[error-correcting code]]s. The main idea of the subject is to design efficient and reliable methods of data transmission. It is now a large field of study, part of [[information theory]].

=== Discrete and computational geometry ===
[[Discrete geometry]] (also called combinatorial geometry) also began a part of combinatorics, with early results on [[convex polytope]]s and [[kissing number]]s.  With the emergence of applications of discrete geometry to [[computational geometry]], these two fields partially merged and became a separate field of study.  There remain many connections with geometric and topological combinatorics, which themselves can be viewed as outgrowths of the early discrete geometry.

===Combinatorics and dynamical systems===
[[Combinatorics and dynamical systems|Combinatorial aspects of dynamical systems]] is another emerging field.  Here dynamical systems can be defined on combinatorial objects.  See for example 
[[graph dynamical system]].

===Combinatorics and physics===
There are increasing interactions between [[combinatorics and physics]], particularly [[statistical physics]]. Examples include an exact solution of the [[Ising model]], and a connection between the [[Potts model]] on one hand, and the [[chromatic polynomial|chromatic]] and [[Tutte polynomial]]s on the other hand.
