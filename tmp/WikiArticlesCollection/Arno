The '''Arno''' is a [[river]] in the [[Tuscany]] region of [[Italy]]. It is the most important river of [[central Italy]] after the [[Tiber]].

== Source and route ==
[[File:Ponte Vecchio.jpg|thumb|250px|left|"Ponte vecchio" (The old bridge)]]
The river originates on [[Mount Falterona]] in the [[Casentino]] area of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], and initially takes a southward curve. The river turns to the west near [[Arezzo]] passing through [[Florence]], [[Empoli]] and [[Pisa]], flowing into the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] at [[Marina di Pisa]].

With a length of {{convert|241|km}}, it is the largest river in the region. It has many tributaries: [[Sieve (river)|Sieve]] ({{convert|60|km}}), [[Bisenzio River|Bisenzio]] ({{convert|49|km}}), [[Era (river)|Era]], [[Elsa (river)|Elsa]], [[Pesa (river)|Pesa]] and [[Pescia (River)|Pescia]]. The drainage basin amounts to more than {{convert|8200|sqkm}} and drains the waters of the following sub-basins:

*The [[Casentino]], in the [[province of Arezzo]], formed by the upper course of the river until the confluence with the Maestro della Chiana channel.
*The [[Valdichiana|Val di Chiana]], a plain dried in the 18th century, which, until then, was a marshy area tributary of the Tiber.
*The upper [[Valdarno]], a long valley bordered from East by the [[Pratomagno]] massif and from West by the hills around [[Siena]].
*The Sieve's basin, which flows in the Arno immediately before Florence.
*The middle Valdarno, with the plain including Florence, [[Sesto Fiorentino]], [[Prato]] and [[Pistoia]].
*The lower Valdarno, with the valley of important tributaries such as the Pesa, Elsa and Era and in which, after [[Pontedera]], the Arno flows into the [[Ligurian Sea]]. The river has a very variable discharge, ranging from minimum values such as 6&nbsp;m³/s to more than 2,000. The mouth of the river was once near [[Pisa]], but is now several kilometres westwards.

It crosses [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], where it passes below the [[Ponte Vecchio]] and the [[Ponte Santa Trinita|Santa Trìnita bridge]] (built by [[Bartolomeo Ammanati]], but inspired by [[Michelangelo]]). The river [[flood]]ed this city regularly in historical times, the last occasion being the [[Flood of the River Arno in Florence|famous flood of 1966]], with 4,500 m³/s  after rainfall of {{convert|437.2|mm}} in Badia Agnano and {{convert|190|mm}} in Florence, in only 24 hours.

The flow rate of the Arno is irregular. It is sometimes described as having a torrent-like behaviour, because it can easily go from almost dry to near-flood in a few days. At the point where the Arno leaves the Apennines, flow measurements can vary between 0.56 m³/s and 3,540 m³/s. New [[dam]]s built upstream of Florence have greatly alleviated the problem in recent years.

A [[1966 Flood of the Arno River|flood on November 4, 1966]] collapsed the embankment in Florence, killing at least 40 people and damaging or destroying millions of works of art and rare books.  New conservation techniques were inspired by the disaster, but even 40 years later hundreds of works still await restoration.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Alison McLean | year = 2006 | month = November | title = This Month in History | journal = Smithsonian | volume = 37 | issue = 8 | pages = 34 }}</ref>
