'''Chalmers University of Technology''' ({{lang-sv|Chalmers tekniska högskola}}, often shortened to '''Chalmers'''), is a [[List of universities in Sweden|Swedish university]] located in [[Gothenburg]] that focuses on research and education in technology, [[natural science]], and [[architecture]].

==History==
The University was founded in 1829 following a donation by [[William Chalmers (merchant)|William Chalmers]], a director of the [[Swedish East India Company]]. He donated part of his fortune for the establishment of an "industrial school". Chalmers was run as a private institution until 1937, when the institute became a [[state-owned university]]. In 1994, the school was incorporated as an
[[aktiebolag]] under the control of the Swedish Government, the faculty and the Student Union. Chalmers is one of only three universities in Sweden which are named after a person, the other two being [[Karolinska Institutet]] and [[Linnaeus University]].

==Departments==
On 1 January 2005, the old schools were replaced by new departments:

# Applied Information Technology
# Applied Mechanics
# Applied Physics
# Architecture
# Chemical and Biological Engineering
# Civil and Environmental Engineering
# Computer Science and Engineering
# Energy and Environment
# Fundamental Physics
# Materials and Manufacturing Technology
# Mathematical Sciences
# Microtechnology and Nanoscience
# Product and Production Development
# Radio and Space Science
# Shipping and Marine Technology
# Signals and Systems
# Technology Management and Economics

In addition to these, Chalmers is home to six national competence centres in key fields like Mathematical Modelling, Environmental Science and Vehicle Safety ([http://www.chalmers.se/safer/EN/ SAFER]).

==Students==
Approximately 40% of Sweden's graduate engineers and architects are educated at Chalmers. Each year, around 250 post graduate degrees are awarded as well as 850 graduate degrees. About 1,000 post-graduate students attend programmes at the university and many students are taking Master of Science engineering programmes and the Master of Architecture programme. From 2007, all Master's programmes are taught in English for both national and international students. This was a result of the adaptation to the [[Bologna process]] that started in 2004 at Chalmers (as the first technical university in Sweden).
Currently, about 10% of all students at Chalmers come from countries outside Sweden to enroll in a Master's or PhD program.

Around 2,700 students also attend Bachelor of Science engineering programmes, merchant marine and other undergraduate courses at [[Chalmers Lindholmen University College|Campus Lindholmen]]. Chalmers also shares some students with Gothenburg University in the joint IT University project. The [[IT University]] focuses exclusively on information technology and offers Bachelor and Master programmes with degrees issued from either Chalmers or Gothenburg University, depending on the programme.

Chalmers confers honorary doctoral degrees to people outside the university who have shown great merit in their research or in society.

== Organization ==
Chalmers is an [[aktiebolag]] with 100 shares à 1,000 [[Swedish Krona|SEK]],<ref>[http://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/chalmers-university-of-technology-foundation/Pages/statutes.aspx Statutes of Chalmers University of Technology Foundation, paragraph 3] (this is a translation of the [http://www.chalmers.se/sections/om_chalmers/stiftelsen_chalmers/stadgar swedish text].) Chalmers University of Technology</ref> all of which is owned by a private foundation ([[Chalmers University of Technology Foundation]]) which appoints the university board and the president. The foundation has its members appointed by the Swedish government (4 to 8 seats), the departments appoints one member, the [[Students' union|student union]] appoints one member and the president automatically gains one chair.<ref>[http://www.chalmers.se/en/sections/about_chalmers/chalmers_university/statues Statues of Chalmers University of Technology Foundation, paragraph 5]. Chalmers University of Technology. Retrieved on 9 August 2011.</ref> Each department is led by a department head, usually a member of the faculty of that department. The faculty senate represents members of the faculty when decisions are taken.

==Campuses==
[[File:Chalmers University of Technology.jpg|right|250px|the gate of Chalmers(Gibraltar Campus)]]
In 1937, the school moved from the city center to the new Gibraltar Campus, named after the mansion which owned the grounds, where it is now located. The [[Chalmers Lindholmen University College|Lindholmen College Campus]] was created in the early 1990s and is located on the island of [[Hisingen]]. Campus Johanneberg and Campus Lindholmen, as they are now called, are connected by bus line number 16, but there have been numerous complaints that the campuses are too isolated from each other.

==Societies and traditions==
Traditions include the pompous graduation ceremony and the Cortège procession, an annual public event.

* [[Chalmers Students' Union]]
* Chalmers Aerospace Club  – founded in 1981. In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] frequently also referred to as ''Chalmers rymdgrupp'' (roughly ''Chalmers Space Group''). Members of CAC led the [[ESA]] funded CACTEX (Chalmers Aerospace Club Thermal EXperiment) project where the [[thermal conductivity]] of alcohol at [[zero gravity]] was investigated using a [[sounding rocket]].
* [http://www.facebook.com/chalmersalternativesports Chalmers Alternative Sports] - a student association organizing trips and other activities working to promote alternative sports. Each year arranges the Chalmers Wake a Pond wakeboard contest in the fountain outside the arcitecture buildning at Chalmers.
* [[Chalmers Ballong Corps]]
* [[Chalmers Baroque Ensemble]]
* [[Chalmers Computer Society]] – Disbanded in 2008 due to low membership.
* [[CETAC]]

== Ties and partnerships ==
Chalmers has partnerships with major industries mostly in the Gothenburg region such as [[Ericsson]], [[Volvo]], and [[SKF]].
The University has general exchange agreements with many European and U.S. universities and maintains a special exchange program agreement with [[National Chiao Tung University]] ([[NCTU]]) in Taiwan where the exchange students from the two universities maintains offices for, among other things, helping local students with applying and preparing for an exchange year as well as acting as representatives ([http://www.europe.nctu.edu.tw/ NCTU Europe – NCTU students at Chalmers], [http://www.asia.chalmers.se/ Chalmers Asia – Chalmers students at NCTU]). It contributes also to the [[Top Industrial Managers for Europe]] (TIME) network.

A close collaboration between the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers and ICVR at ETH Zurich is being established.
