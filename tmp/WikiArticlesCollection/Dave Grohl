==Early life==
Grohl was born in [[Warren, Ohio]], the son of Virginia Jean (née Hanlon), a teacher, and James Harper Grohl, at the time a newswriter.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ks1JAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HYUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5088,3102676&dq=virginia-hanlon-teacher-troth-told-is-bride-of-news&hl=en]</ref> He has [[Slovak American|Slovak]], German, and Irish ancestry.<ref>[http://books.google.ca/books?id=gbnpNc_TZt0C&pg=PT21&dq=%22Both+of+Grohl's+parents+were+Ohio+natives%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=f3FNUpeEPIizyAG-u4DgBg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fPEo7gRnlSQC&pg=PT12&lpg=PT12&dq=dave+grohl+slovak&source=bl&ots=6kRurimuIo&sig=_rIQk2b-1vCn6CK4GoUrEvrVJVE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=41nkUZu_LqyQ7Ab48oDAAg&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg]</ref> As a child, Grohl's family relocated from Warren, to [[Springfield, Virginia]]. When Grohl was six, his parents divorced,<ref name="guardian">Cameron, Keith. "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/sep/14/popandrock.foofighters "'I've never gotten off on chaos'"]."

At the age of twelve, Grohl began learning to play guitar. He quickly grew tired of lessons and instead taught himself, and began playing in bands with friends.<ref name="Grohl-  drummerworld" /><ref name=azerrad148>{{cite book

</ref> A year later, Grohl and his sister spent the summer in [[Evanston, Illinois]], at their cousin Tracy's house. Tracy introduced them to [[punk rock]] by taking the pair to shows by a variety of punk bands. His first concert was in 1982 to see [[Naked Raygun]] at [[The Cubby Bear]] in Chicago when he was 13 years old.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ganz|first=Jacob|title=Dave Grohl: How To Make An Arena Feel Like A Punk Club|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2011/04/07/133965436/dave-grohl-how-to-make-an-arena-feel-like-a-punk-club?|work=The Record|publisher=National Public Radio}}</ref>  "From then on we were totally punk," Grohl explained. "We went home and bought ''[[Maximumrocknroll]]'' and tried to figure it all out."<ref name=azerrad148/>

In Virginia, Grohl attended [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Alexandria, Virginia)|Thomas Jefferson High School]] as a freshman. He was elected vice president of his freshman class and played bits of songs by bands like the [[Circle Jerks]] and [[Bad Brains]] over the school intercom before his morning announcements. Grohl's mother decided that he should transfer to [[Bishop Ireton High School]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] because his marijuana usage was affecting his grades. He stayed there two years, beginning with a repeat of freshman year. After his sophomore year, he transferred yet again, to [[Annandale High School]].<ref name=azerrad148 />

While in high school, Grohl played in several local bands, including a stint on guitar in a band called Freak Baby. While playing in Freak Baby, he taught himself to play drums.<ref name="Grohl-  drummerworld" /> When Freak Baby kicked out its bass player, Grohl decided to switch to drums, and the new band called themselves Mission Impossible.<ref name=azerrad148/> During his developing years as a drummer, Grohl cited [[John Bonham]] as his greatest influence, and eventually had Bonham's [[:Image:Zoso John Bonham sigil three intersecting circles.svg|three-circle logo]] tattooed on his wrist.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5940050/14_led_zeppelin The Immortals - The Greatest Artists of All Time: 14) Led Zeppelin : Rolling Stone]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref> Mission Impossible later rebranded themselves Fast before breaking up, after which Grohl joined the [[post-punk]]-influenced [[hardcore punk]] band [[Dain Bramage]].<ref>Azerrad, p. 149</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~gravityboy/bramage/history.html |title=Dain Bramage ...

Many of Grohl's early influences were gained at the [[9:30 club]], a live music venue in Washington D.C.: "I went to the 9:30 club hundreds of times. I was always so excited to get there, and I was always bummed when it closed. I spent my teenage years at the club and saw some shows that changed my life."<ref name=freedom>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/16/AR2010041602110.html|title=Welcome to the Club: An oral history of D.C.'s 9:30 club on its 30th anniversary|date=April 18, 2010|work=[[The Washington Post|Washington Post Magazine]]|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>

==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=March 2013}}

===Scream (1986–1990)===
[[File:Dave Grohl 1991.jpg|thumb|left|Dave Grohl with Scream, 1990.]]
{{Main|Scream (band)}}
At the age of seventeen, Grohl auditioned with local DC favorites [[Scream (band)|Scream]] to fill the vacancy left by the departure of drummer [[Kent Stax]]. In order to be lined up for the audition, Grohl had lied about his age, claiming he was 20.<ref>Lynskey, Dorian. "[http://www.fooarchive.com/features/arena2002.htm The Man Who Fell To Earth]". ''Arena''. December 2002.</ref> To Grohl's surprise, the band asked him to join. After waffling for a brief period, Grohl accepted the offer. Grohl dropped out of high school in his junior year; he said, "I was seventeen and extremely anxious to see the world, so I did it."<ref>Azerrad, p. 150</ref> Over the next four years, Grohl toured extensively with the band, recording a couple of live albums  (their May 4, 1990 show in Alzey, Germany being released by Tobby Holzinger as [[Your Choice Live Series Vol.10]]) and two studio albums, ''[[No More Censorship]]'' and ''[[Fumble (album)|Fumble]]'', on which Grohl penned and sang vocals on the song "Gods Look Down".

While playing in Scream, Grohl became a fan of [[Melvins]] and eventually befriended the band. During a 1990 tour stop on the west coast, The Melvins' [[Buzz Osborne]] took a couple of his friends, [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Krist Novoselic]], to see the band.<ref>Levin, Hannah [http://www.houstonpress.com/events/the-melvins-1334315/ "The Melvins"]. houstonpress.com. August 27, 2009.</ref>

===Nirvana (1990–1994)===
{{Main|Nirvana (band)}}
A few months later, Scream unexpectedly disbanded following the departure of its bass player. Grohl called Osborne for advice, and the latter gave him the phone numbers of [[Krist Novoselic]] and [[Kurt Cobain]], who invited Grohl to Seattle. Grohl subsequently auditioned for Nirvana, and soon joined them full-time.<ref>

At the time that Grohl joined Nirvana, the band had already recorded several demos for the follow-up to their debut album ''[[Bleach (album)|Bleach]]'', having spent time recording with producer [[Butch Vig]] in [[Wisconsin]]. Initially, the plan was to release the album on [[Sub Pop]], but the band received a great deal of [[major label]] interest based on the demos. Grohl spent the initial months with Nirvana traveling to various major labels as the band shopped for a deal, eventually signing with [[DGC Records]]. In the spring of 1991, the band entered the studio to record the album.<!-- Citation not needed, information can be found on the NEVERMIND article. -->

Upon its release, ''[[Nevermind]]'' exceeded all expectations and became a massive success, catapulting the band to worldwide stardom. At the same time, Grohl was struggling with his status in the band. While his drumming style was a significant element in the band's success, Grohl saw himself as just another in a long line of drummers. Though Grohl had been writing songs for several years, he declined to introduce most of his songs to the band as he was in awe of Cobain's songs and didn't want to pollute the process. Instead, he compiled and recorded them himself, releasing a cassette called ''[[Pocketwatch (album)|Pocketwatch]]'' in 1992 on indie label Simple Machines. Rather than using his own name, Grohl released the cassette under the [[pseudonym]] "Late!".<ref>{{cite web|title=Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters {{!}} Extended interview – Lollapalooza 2011|url=http://timeoutchicago.com/music-nightlife/14873935/dave-grohl-of-foo-fighters-extended-interview-lollapalooza-2011|work=[[Time Out Chicago]]|publisher=Time Out Group|accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>

In the later years of Nirvana, Grohl's songwriting contributions increased. In Dave Grohl's initial months in Seattle, Kurt Cobain overheard him working on a song called "Color Pictures of a Marigold", and the two ended up working on it. Grohl would later record the song for the ''Pocketwatch'' cassette. During the sessions for ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'', he decided to re-record the song, and the band released this version as a B-side on the "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]" single, titled simply "Marigold". Grohl also contributed the main guitar riff for "Scentless Apprentice". Cobain admitted in a late 1993 MTV interview that he initially thought the riff was "kind of boneheaded", but was gratified at how the song developed (a process captured in part in a demo on the Nirvana box set ''[[With the Lights Out]]''). Cobain noted that he was excited at the possibility of having Novoselic and Grohl contribute more to the band's songwriting.

Prior to their 1994 European tour, the band scheduled session time at [[Robert Lang Studios]] in Seattle to work on demos. For most of the three-day session Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on demos of their own songs. The duo completed several of Grohl's songs, including future [[Foo Fighters]] songs "Exhausted", "[[Big Me]]", "February Stars", and "Butterflies". On the third day of the session Cobain finally arrived and the band recorded a demo of a song later named "[[You Know You're Right]]". It was the band's final studio recording.

===Foo Fighters (1994-present)===
{{Main|Foo Fighters}}
Following Cobain's death in April 1994, Grohl retreated, unsure of where to go and what to do with himself. In October 1994, Grohl scheduled studio time, again at Robert Lang's Studio, and quickly recorded a fifteen-track demo. With the exception of a single guitar part on "X-Static" played by [[Greg Dulli]] of the [[Afghan Whigs]], Grohl performed all of the instruments himself.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kirby|first=David|title=Dave Grohl: From Antsy Student to Nirvana to Foo Fighters|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/books/review/this-is-a-call-the-life-and-times-of-dave-grohl-by-paul-brannigan-book-review.html?_r=0|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>

At the same time, Grohl wondered if his future might be in drumming for other bands. In November, Grohl took a brief turn with [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], including a memorable performance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Petty asked him to join permanently, but Grohl declined.<ref name="Brannigan2011">{{cite book|author=Paul Brannigan|title=This Is a Call: The Life and Times of Dave Grohl|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-iAW8G_IND0C&pg=PA236|accessdate=26 March 2013|year=2011|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81956-8|pages=236–}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dave Grohl’s Classic Rock Credentials|url=http://news.radio.com/2013/03/14/dave-grohl-classic-rock-credentials/|work=[[SnT Radio.com{{!}}radio.com]]|accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> He was also rumored as a possible replacement for [[Pearl Jam]] drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]] and even performed with the band for a song or two at three shows during Pearl Jam's March 1995 Australian tour. However, by then Pearl Jam had already settled on ex- [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] drummer [[Jack Irons]] and Grohl had other solo plans in the works.<ref name="Jam2011">{{cite book|author=Pearl Jam|title=Pearl Jam Twenty|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M89kbBxGK4MC&pg=PA148|accessdate=26 March 2013|date=13 September 2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-6940-7|pages=148–}}</ref><ref name="Cross2012">{{cite book|author=Alan Cross|title=Pearl Jam: the secret history|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ordeqqbm378C&pg=PT28|accessdate=26 March 2013|date=26 June 2012|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-1-927002-19-3|pages=28–}}</ref>

After passing the demo around, Grohl found himself with considerable major label interest. Nirvana's [[A&R]] rep Gary Gersh had subsequently taken over as president of [[Capitol Records]] and lured Grohl to sign with the label. Grohl did not want the effort to be considered the start of a solo career so he recruited other band members: former Germs and touring Nirvana guitarist [[Pat Smear]], and two members of the recently disbanded  [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], [[William Goldsmith]] (drums) and [[Nate Mendel]] (bass). Rather than re-record the album, Grohl's demo was given a professional mix by [[Rob Schnapf]] and [[Tom Rothrock]] and was released in July 1995 as Foo Fighters' [[Foo Fighters (album)|debut album]].

During a break between tours, the band entered the studio and recorded a cover of [[Gary Numan]]'s "[[Down in the Park]]". In February 1996, Grohl and his then-wife [[Jennifer Youngblood]] made a brief [[cameo appearance]] on  ''[[The X-Files]]'' third season episode "Pusher".

After touring for the self-titled album for more than a year, Grohl returned home and began work on the soundtrack to the 1997 movie ''[[Touch (1997 film)|Touch]]''. Grohl performed all of the instruments and vocals himself, save for vocals from [[Veruca Salt (band)|Veruca Salt]] singer [[Louise Post]] on the title track, keyboards by Barrett Jones (who also co-produced the record) on one track, and vocals and guitar by [[X (U.S. band)|X's]] [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] on "This Loving Thing (Lynn's Song)". Grohl completed the recording in two weeks, and immediately joined Foo Fighters to work on their follow-up.

In the midst of the initial sessions for Foo Fighters' second album, tension emerged between Grohl and Goldsmith. According to Goldsmith, "Dave had me do 96 takes of one song, and I had to do thirteen hours' worth of takes on another one. ... It just seemed that everything I did wasn't good enough for him, or anyone else." Goldsmith also believed that Capitol and producer Gil Norton wanted Grohl to drum on the album.<ref name="roberts">Roberts, Michael. "[http://bestof.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day Bring Back that Sunny Day]." ''Miami New Times''. December 3, 1998.</ref> With the album seemingly complete, Grohl headed home to Virginia with a copy of the rough mixes, and found himself unhappy with the results. Grohl penned a few new songs, recording one of them, "[[Walking After You]]", by himself at a studio in [[Washington, DC]]. Inspired by the session, Grohl opted to move the band, without Goldsmith's knowledge,<ref name="roberts" /> to Los Angeles to re-record most of the album with Grohl behind the kit. After the sessions were complete, Goldsmith officially announced his departure from the band.

Speaking in 2011 about the tension surrounding the departure of Goldsmith, Grohl said, "There were a lot of reasons it didn't work out... but there was also a part of me that was like, you know, I don't know if I'm finished playing the drums yet." He would also state, "I wish that I would have handled things differently..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWhsYINKcKM#t=2m56s |title=Oxegen 2011 - Foo Fighters Dave Grohl |publisher=YouTube |date=July 10, 2011 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Dave Grohl in London.jpg|thumb|upright|Dave Grohl on stage, 2006]]
The effort was released in May 1997 as the band's second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'', which eventually cemented Foo Fighters as a staple of rock radio. The album spawned several hits, including "[[Everlong]]", "[[My Hero (song)|My Hero]]", and "[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]". Just prior to the album's release, former [[Alanis Morissette]] drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] joined the band on drums. The following September, Smear (a close friend of [[Jennifer Youngblood]]) left the band,<ref name="guardian" /> citing a need to settle down following a lifetime of touring. Smear was subsequently replaced by Grohl's former [[Scream (band)|Scream]] bandmate [[Franz Stahl]]. (Stahl departed the band prior to recording of Foo Fighters' third album<ref name="guardian" /> and was replaced by touring guitarist [[Chris Shiflett]], who later became a full-fledged member during the recording of ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.)

Grohl's life of non-stop touring and travel continued with Foo Fighters' popularity. During his infrequent pauses he lived in [[Seattle]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] before returning to [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. It was there that he turned his basement into a recording studio where the 1999 album ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' was recorded.<ref name=back>{{cite video|author=[[James Moll|Moll, James]] (director)|title=[[Back and Forth (documentary)|Back and Forth]]|year=2011|medium=documentary|publisher=RCA}}</ref>

In 2000, the band recruited [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] to add some guitar flourish to a cover of [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Have a Cigar]]", a song which Foo Fighters previously recorded as a b-side. The friendship between the two bands resulted in Grohl and Taylor Hawkins being asked to induct Queen into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dave Grohl and Taylor Hawkins induct Queen|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/queen/transcript/dave-grohl-and-taylor-hawkins-/|work=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref> Grohl and Hawkins joined May and Queen drummer [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]] to perform "[[Tie Your Mother Down]]", with Grohl<!-- Grohl sang at the 2001 induction&nbsp;— Hawkins did not sing the song until later performances. --> standing in on vocals for [[Freddie Mercury]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Foo Fighters joined by Queen legends|url=http://www.nme.com/news/nme/23362|work=[[NME]]|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref> May later contributed guitar work for the song "Tired of You" on the ensuing Foo Fighters album, as well as on an unreleased Foo Fighters song called "Knucklehead".

Near the end of 2001, Foo Fighters returned to the studio to work on their fourth album. After four months in the studio, with the sessions finished, Grohl accepted an invitation to join [[Queens of the Stone Age]] and helped them to record their 2002 album ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]''. (Grohl can be seen drumming for the band in the video for the song "[[No One Knows]]".) After a brief tour through North America, Britain and Japan with the band<ref name="guardian" /> and feeling rejuvenated by the effort, Grohl recalled the other band members to completely re-record their album at his studio in Virginia. The effort became their fourth album, ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''. While initially pleased with the results, in another 2005 ''Rolling Stone'' interview, Dave Grohl admitted to not liking the record: "Four of the songs were good, and the other seven I never played again in my life. We rushed into it, and we rushed out of it."<ref>Scaggs, Austin. [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7281787/foos_reclaim_their_honor "Foos Reclaim Their Honor"]. Rolling Stone. April 29, 2005.</ref>

On November 23, 2002, Grohl achieved a historical milestone by replacing himself on the top of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Modern Rock]] chart, when "[[You Know You're Right]]" by Nirvana was replaced by "[[All My Life (Foo Fighters song)|All My Life]]" by Foo Fighters.  When "All My Life" ended its run, after a one week respite, "[[No One Knows]]" by Queens of the Stone Age took the number one spot.  Between October 26, 2002 and March 1, 2003 Grohl was in the number one spot on the Modern Rock charts for 17 of 18 successive weeks, as a member of three different groups.

Grohl and Foo Fighters released their fifth album ''[[In Your Honor]]'' on June 14, 2005. Prior to starting work on the album, the band spent almost a year relocating Grohl's home-based Virginia studio to a brand new facility, dubbed Studio 606, located in a warehouse near Los Angeles. Featuring collaborations with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] of [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Josh Homme]] of [[Queens of the Stone Age]] and [[Norah Jones]], the album was a departure from previous efforts, and included one rock and one acoustic disc.

[[File:Foo Fighters 2009.jpg|thumb|Foo Fighters in 2009, from left to right: Hawkins, Shiflett, Grohl, Mendel]]
Foo Fighters's sixth studio album ''[[Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace]]'' was released on September 25, 2007. It was recorded during a three-month period between March 2007 and June 2007, and its release was preceded by the first single "[[The Pretender (Foo Fighters song)|The Pretender]]" on September 17. The second single, "[[Long Road to Ruin]]", was released on December 3, 2007, followed by the third single, "[[Let It Die (song)|Let It Die]]", June 24, 2008.

On November 3, 2009, Foo Fighters released their first ''[[Greatest Hits (Foo Fighters album)|Greatest Hits]]'' collection, consisting of 16 tracks including a previously unreleased acoustic version of "Everlong" and two new tracks "[[Wheels (Foo Fighters song)|Wheels]]" and "Word Forward" which were produced by [[Nevermind]]'s producer [[Butch Vig]]. Grohl has been quoted saying the ''Greatest Hits'' is too early and "...can look like an obituary."

The Foo Fighters' seventh studio album, ''[[Wasting Light]]'', was released on April 12, 2011. It is the first Foo Fighters album to reach #1 in the United States. Despite rumors of a hiatus,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/foo-fighters/66395 |title=Dave Grohl hints at Foo Fighters hiatus |publisher=Nme.Com |date=2012-10-01 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> Grohl confirmed in January 2013 that the band had completed writing material for their follow-up to ''Wasting Light''.<ref>{{cite web|author=01/18/2013 17:48:11 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1700660/dave-grohl-foo-fighters-new-album.jhtml |title=Dave Grohl Says Foo Fighters 'Have A Plan' For Their Next Album - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=2013-01-23 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>

On May 19, 2012, the Foo Fighters appeared with [[Mick Jagger]] on ''Saturday Night Live''.  They performed the [[Jagger/Richards]] songs "[[19th Nervous Breakdown]]" and "[[It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)]]".

==Additional projects and contributions==
Apart from his main bands, Grohl has been involved in other music projects. In 1992, he played drums on [[Buzz Osborne]]'s [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]-styled solo-EP ''[[King Buzzo (album)|King Buzzo]]'', where he was credited as ''Dale Nixon'', a pseudonym that [[Greg Ginn]] adopted to play bass on [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag's]] ''[[My War]]''. He also released the music cassette [[Pocketwatch (album)|Pocketwatch]] under the pseudonym ''Late!'' on the now defunct indie label, [[Simple Machines]].

In 1993, Grohl was recruited to help recreate the music of [[The Beatles]]' early years for the movie ''[[Backbeat (film)|Backbeat]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Full Cast and Credits for Backbeat (1994) |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106339/fullcredits |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=March 18, 2010}}</ref> he played drums in an "all-star" lineup that included [[Greg Dulli]] of the [[Afghan Whigs]], indie producer [[Don Fleming (musician)|Don Fleming]], [[Mike Mills]] of [[R.E.M.]], [[Thurston Moore]] of [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Dave Pirner]] of [[Soul Asylum]]. A music video was filmed for the song "[[Money (That's What I Want)]]" while Grohl was with Nirvana on their 1994 European tour, footage of Grohl was filmed later and included.

Later in 1994, Grohl played drums on two tracks for [[Mike Watt]]'s ''[[Ball-Hog or Tugboat?]]''. In early 1995, Grohl and Foo Fighters played their first US tour opening for Watt, and helped make up Watt's supporting band. Nicknamed the "Ringspiel" tour, Watt's band featured Grohl and William Goldsmith on drums, [[Eddie Vedder]] and Pat Smear on guitar, and Watt on bass.

During the early 2000s, Grohl spent time in his basement studio writing and recording a number of songs for a [[Heavy metal music|metal]] project. Over the span of several years, he recruited his favorite metal vocalists from the 1980s, including [[Lemmy]] of [[Motörhead]], [[Conrad Lant|Conrad "Cronos" Lant]] from [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[King Diamond]], [[Scott Weinrich]], Snake of [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]] and [[Max Cavalera]] of [[Sepultura]], to perform the vocals for the songs. The project was released in 2004 under the [[moniker]] [[Probot (band)|Probot]].<ref>D'Angelo, Joe .

Also in 2003, Grohl stepped behind the kit to perform on [[Killing Joke]]'s second [[Killing Joke 2003 (album)|self-titled album]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Grohl Gets Behind Killing Joke's 'Axis'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/71643/grohl-gets-behind-killing-jokes-axis|work=[[Billboard (magazine){{!}}Billboard]]|accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> The move surprised some Nirvana fans, given that Nirvana had been accused of stealing the opening riff of "[[Come as You Are (Nirvana song)|Come as You Are]]" from Killing Joke's 1984 song "Eighties".<ref>{{cite web|title=Eighties - Killing Joke|last=Janovitz|first=Bill|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/eighties-mt0028575343|work=[[allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>  However, the controversy failed to create a lasting rift between the bands. Foo Fighters covered Killing Joke's "Requiem" during the late 1990s, and were even joined by Killing Joke singer [[Jaz Coleman]] for a performance of the song at a show in New Zealand in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vrenna|first=Carrie|title=Nirvana Pay Back Killing Joke|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nirvana-pay-back-killing-joke-20030410|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>  Also in 2003, at the [[2003 Grammy Awards]], Grohl performed in an ad-hoc supergroup with [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Elvis Costello]], and [[Steven Van Zandt]] for a performance in tribute of then-recently deceased singer/guitarist [[Joe Strummer]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZRn0dhGz7U |title=Joe Strummer Tribute-London Calling(2003 Grammys) |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-06-14 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>

Grohl lent his drumming skills to other artists during the early 2000s. In 2000, he played drums and sang on a track, "Goodbye Lament", from [[Tony Iommi]]'s album ''[[Iommi (album)|Iommi]]''. In 2001, Grohl performed on [[Tenacious D]]'s debut album, and appeared in the video for lead single "[[Tribute (song)|Tribute]]" as a [[demon]]. He later appeared in the duo's 2006 movie ''[[Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny]]'' as the devil in the song "[[Beelzeboss]]", and performed on its soundtrack. He also performed drums for their 2012 album ''[[Rize of the Fenix]]''. In 2002, Grohl helped [[Chan Marshall]] of [[Cat Power]] on the album ''[[You Are Free]]'' and played with [[Queens of the Stone Age]] on their album ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]''. Grohl also toured with the band in support of the album, delaying work on the Foo Fighters' album ''One by One''. In 2004, Grohl drummed on several tracks for [[Nine Inch Nails]]' 2005 album ''[[With Teeth]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|title=With Teeth {{!}} Album Review|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/with-teeth-20050505|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen|title=With Teeth - Nine Inch Nails|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/with-teeth-mw0000472021|work=[[allmusic]]|accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>  He also drummed on the song "Bad Boyfriend" on [[Garbage (band)|Garbage's]] 2005 album ''[[Bleed Like Me]]''.<ref name="garbage" /> Most recently, he recorded all the drums on [[Juliette and the Licks]]'s 2006 album ''[[Four on the Floor (Juliette and the Licks album)|Four on the Floor]]''<ref>{{cite web|title=Juliette Lewis teams up with Dave Grohl|url=http://www.nme.com/news/juliette-and-the-licks/24219 |publisher=NME |accessdate=October 1, 2009}}</ref> and the song "For Us" from [[Pete Yorn]]'s 2006 album ''[[Nightcrawler (album)|Nightcrawler]]''. Beyond drumming, Grohl contributed guitar to a cover of [[Neil Young]]'s "I've Been Waiting For You" on [[David Bowie]]'s 2002 album ''[[Heathen (David Bowie album)|Heathen]]''.<ref name=bowie>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Chris|title=David Bowie Heathen Review|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/95cz|work=[[BBC Music]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>

Grohl has been vocal in his views on drug misuse, contributing to a 2009 anti-drug video for the [[BBC]]. "I have never done cocaine, ever in my life. I have never done heroin, I have never done speed," he said in a 2008 interview, adding that he had stopped smoking marijuana and taking acid at the age of 20. In the BBC video he said "I've seen people die. It ain't easy being young, but that stuff doesn't make it any easier".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8634675/Foo-Fighters-Dave-Grohl-kicks-brawler-out-of-Roundhouse-concert.html|title=Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl kicks brawler out of Roundhouse concert|accessdate=July 29, 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=July 13, 2011}}</ref>

In May 2006, Grohl sent a note of support to the two trapped miners in the [[Beaconsfield mine collapse]] in [[Tasmania]], Australia. In the initial days following the collapse, one of the men requested an [[iPod]] with Foo Fighters album ''[[In Your Honor]]'', to be sent down to them through a small hole. Grohl's note read, in part, "Though I'm halfway around the world right now, my heart is with you both, and I want you to know that when you come home, there's two tickets to any Foos show, anywhere, and two cold beers waiting for yo<!-- Grohl's written statement included the word "yous".

Grohl is an advocate for gay rights. He has worn a [[White Knot]] ribbon to various events to promote whiteknot.org. When questioned about the knot, he responded “You know what that’s about? I believe in love and I believe in equality and I believe in marriage equality.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl: White Knot for Gay Marriage|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/98982/foo-fighters-dave-grohl-white-knot-for-gay-marriage|publisher=eonline|accessdate=February 7, 2009}}</ref> Grohl's gay rights activism dates back to the early 1990s, when he and the other members of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] performed at a benefit to raise money to fight [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992)]]. "Measure 9 goes against American traditions of mutual respect and freedom, and Nirvana wants to do their part to end bigotry and narrow-mindedness everywhere", the group stated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nirvana sets benefit show in Portland for gay rights|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19920808&id=LUVWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=h-oDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6669,1568864|publisher=The Register-Guard|accessdate=April 8, 1992}}</ref>  The ballot measure was ultimately defeated on November 3, 1992.

He was fined $400 and had his Australian driving permit revoked for three months. Following the incident Grohl stated: "So, people, I guess if there's anything to learn here, it's: don't drive after a few beers, even if you feel entirely capable like I did."<ref>January 31, 2000 [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429030/20000131/foo_fighters.jhtml Dave Grohl Nabbed For Down Under DUI] MTV.com</ref><ref>February 3, 2000 [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429029/20000203/foo_fighters.jhtml Dave Grohl Responds To DUI Charge] MTV.com</ref>
