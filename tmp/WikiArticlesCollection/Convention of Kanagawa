On March 31, 1854, the {{Nihongo|'''Convention of Kanagawa'''|日米和親条約|Nichibei Washin Jōyaku|"Japan–US Treaty of Peace and Amity"|lead=yes}} or {{Nihongo|'''Kanagawa Treaty'''|神奈川条約|Kanagawa Jōyaku}} was concluded between [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Matthew C. Perry]] of the [[United States Navy]] and the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].

==Treaty of Peace and Amity (1854)==
The treaty opened the Japanese ports of [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]] and [[Hakodate]] to [[United States]] trade and guaranteed the safety of shipwrecked U.S. sailors; however, the treaty did not create a basis for establishing a permanent residence in these locations.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=980DE2D9113CE13BBC4052DFB667838E649FDE  "From Washington; The Japanese Treaty-Its Advantages and Disadvantages-The President and Col. Rinney, &c.,"] ''New York Times.'' October 18, 1855.</ref> The treaty did establish a foundation for the Americans to maintain a permanent consul in Shimoda. The arrival of the fleet would trigger the end of Japan's 200 year policy of seclusion ([[Sakoku]]).<ref>*Perry, Matthew Calbraith. (1856).

Perry initially refused to deal with local Japanese officials and demanded to speak only with representatives of the Japanese Head of State. At the time, [[Shogun]] [[Tokugawa Ieyoshi]] was the de facto ruler of Japan; for the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] to interact in any way with foreigners was out of the question. Perry concluded the treaty with representatives of the [[Shogun]], led by plenipotentiary {{nihongo|[[Hayashi Akira]]|林韑}} and the text was reluctantly endorsed subsequently by [[Emperor Komei]].<ref>Cullen, Louis M. (2003). ''A History of Japan, 1582-1941: Internal and External Worlds,'' p. 173-185.</ref>

The Treaty was ratified on 21 February 1855.<ref>[[Diplomatic Record Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)]] exhibit.</ref>

==Later treaties==
The Kanagawa treaty was followed by the [[United States-Japan Treaty of Kanagawa]], the "Harris Treaty" of 1858, which allowed the establishment of foreign concessions, extraterritoriality for foreigners, and minimal import taxes for foreign goods. The Japanese chafed under the "[[unequal treaty]] system" which characterized Asian and western relations during this period.<ref>Bert Edström, Bert. (2000). [http://books.google.com/books?id=ltmXn9rUGD8C&pg=PA101&dq=unequal+treaty+japan&lr=#PPA101,M1  ''The Japanese and Europe: Images and Perceptions,'' p. 101.]</ref>

The Kanagawa treaty became a significant causative factor leading to serious internal conflicts within Japan — an upheaval which was only resolved in 1867 with the end of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and the beginning of the [[Meiji Restoration]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Similar treaties were subsequently negotiated by the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Anglo-Japanese Friendship Treaty]], October 1854), the [[Russians]] ([[Treaty of Shimoda]], 7 February 1855), and the [[French people|French]] ([[Treaty of Amity and Commerce between France and Japan]], 9 October 1858).

==Kanagawa Treaty House==
The Convention was negotiated and was then signed in a purpose-built house in [[Yokohama]], [[Japan]].
