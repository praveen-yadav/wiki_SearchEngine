'''''Aotus''''' may refer to:
* [[Aotus (plant)|''Aotus'' (plant)]], one of the plant genera commonly known as golden peas in the family Fabaceae (bean family).
* [[Aotus (monkey)|''Aotus'' (monkey)]], the genus of night monkeys in the family Aotidae.

The name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words for "earless" in both cases: the monkey is missing external [[ear]]s, and the pea is missing earlike bracteoles.

* AOTUS is also the acronym for the [[Archivist of the United States]]
