==Definition==
{{See also|Earth's orbit}}

The astronomical unit was originally defined as the length of the [[semi-major axis]] of the [[Earth]]'s elliptical orbit around the [[Sun]].

In 1976 for greater precision, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) formally adopted [[IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants|the definition]] that "the astronomical unit of length is that length (''A'') for which the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] (''k'') takes the value {{val|0.01720209895}} when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time".<ref name="IAU76">Resolution No. 10 of the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1976_French.pdf XVIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Grenoble, 1976</ref><ref name="Trümper">{{Citation |title= Astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology — Volume VI/4B ''Solar System''|url=http://books.google.com/?id=wgydrPWl6XkC&pg=RA1-PA4 |page=4 |year=2009 |author=H.

==Modern determinations==
Precise measurements of the relative positions of the [[Solar System#Inner planets|inner planets]] can be made by [[radar]] and by [[telemetry]] from [[space probe]]s. As with all radar measurements, these rely on measuring the time taken for [[photons]] to be reflected from an object. These measured positions are then compared with those calculated by the laws of [[celestial mechanics]]: an assembly of calculated positions is often referred to as an [[ephemeris]], in which distances are commonly calculated in astronomical units. One of several ephemeris computation services is provided by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].<ref name=Horizons>

</ref>

The comparison of the ephemeris with the measured positions leads to a value for the [[speed of light]] in astronomical units, which is {{nowrap|173.144 632 6847(69)}}&nbsp;au/d ([[Barycentric Dynamical Time|TDB]]).<ref>"[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecK/2009/Astronomical_Constants_2009.pdf 2009 Selected Astronomical Constants]" in {{citation|title=The Astronomical Almanac Online|url=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/|publisher=[[United States Naval Observatory|USNO]]–[[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office|UKHO]]}}</ref> As the speed of light in meters per second ([http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?c ''c''<sub>0</sub>]) is fixed in the [[International System of Units]], this measurement of the speed of light in au/d (''c''<sub>AU</sub>) also determines the value of the astronomical unit in meters (''A''):

==Usage==
With the definitions used before 2012, the astronomical unit was dependent on the [[heliocentric gravitational constant]], that is the product of the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' and the solar mass ''M''<sub>☉</sub>. Neither ''G'' nor ''M''<sub>☉</sub> can be measured to high accuracy in SI units, but the value of their product is known very precisely from observing the relative positions of planets ([[Kepler's Third Law]] expressed in terms of Newtonian gravitation). Only the product is required to calculate planetary positions for an ephemeris, which explains why ephemerides are calculated in astronomical units and not in SI units.

The calculation of ephemerides also requires a consideration of the effects of [[general relativity]]. In particular, time intervals measured on the surface of the Earth ([[terrestrial time]], TT) are not constant when compared to the motions of the planets: the terrestrial second (TT) appears to be longer in Northern Hemisphere winter and shorter in Northern Hemisphere summer when compared to the "planetary second" (conventionally measured in [[barycentric dynamical time]], TDB). This is because the distance between the Earth and the Sun is not fixed (it varies between {{nowrap|0.983&thinsp;289&thinsp;8912}}&nbsp;au and {{nowrap|1.016&thinsp;710&thinsp;3335}}&nbsp;au) and, when the Earth is closer to the Sun ([[perihelion]]), the Sun's gravitational field is stronger and the Earth is moving faster along its [[Earth's orbit|orbital path]]. As the meter is defined in terms of the second, and the speed of light is constant for all observers, the terrestrial meter appears to change in length compared to the "planetary meter" on a periodic basis.

The meter is defined to be a unit of [[proper length]], but the SI definition does not specify the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] to be used in determining it. Indeed, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) notes that "its definition applies only within a spatial extent sufficiently small that the effects of the non-uniformity of the gravitational field can be ignored."<ref>{{SIbrochure8th|pages=166–67}}</ref> As such, the meter is undefined for the purposes of measuring distances within the Solar System. The 1976 definition of the astronomical unit was incomplete, in particular because it does not specify the [[frame of reference]] in which time is to be measured, but proved practical for the calculation of ephemerides: a fuller definition that is consistent with general relativity was proposed,<ref name="Huang">{{citation|author=Huang, T.-Y.; Han, C.-H.; Yi, Z.-H.; Xu, B.-X.|year=1995|title=What is the astronomical unit of length?|bibcode=1995A&A...298..629H|journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics|Astron.

The au is too small for interstellar distances, where the [[parsec]] is commonly used. See the article [[cosmic distance ladder]]. The [[light year]] is often used in popular works, but is not an approved non-SI unit.<ref name=Dodd1>See, for example, the work cited above: {{cite book |title=Using SI Units in Astronomy |author=Richard Dodd |page=82 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UC_1_804BXgC&pg=PA82 |chapter=§6.2.8: Light year |isbn=0-521-76917-5}}</ref>

==History==
According to [[Archimedes]] in the ''[[Sand Reckoner|Sandreckoner]]'' (2.1), [[Aristarchus of Samos]] estimated the distance to the Sun to be 10,000 times the Earth's radius (the true value is about 23,000).<ref name=Gomez>Gomez, A. G. (2013) [http://www.authorhouse.co.uk/Bookstore/BookDetail.aspx?BookId=SKU-000625467 '' Aristarchos of Samos, the Polymath''] AuthorHouse, ISBN 9781481789493.</ref> However, the book ''[[On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon]]'', which has long been ascribed to Aristarchus, says that he calculated the distance to the sun to be between 18 and 20 times the [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|distance to the Moon]], whereas the true ratio is about 389.174. The latter estimate was based on the angle between the [[Lunar phase|half moon]] and the Sun, which he estimated as 87° (the true value being close to 89.853°). Depending on the distance Van Helden assumes Aristarchus used for the distance to the Moon, his calculated distance to the Sun would fall between 380 and 1,520 Earth radii.<ref>{{Citation|last=Van Helden|first=Albert|title=Measuring the Universe: Cosmic Dimensions from Aristarchus to Halley|place=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1985|pages=5–9|isbn=0-226-84882-5}}</ref>

According to [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in the ''[[Preparation for the Gospel|Praeparatio Evangelica]]'' (Book XV, Chapter 53), [[Eratosthenes]] found the distance to the sun to be "σταδιων μυριαδας τετρακοσιας και οκτωκισμυριας" (literally "of ''stadia'' [[myriad]]s 400 and 80000" but with the additional note that in the Greek text the [[Agreement (linguistics)|grammatical agreement]] is between ''myriads'' (not ''stadia'') on the one hand and both ''400'' and ''80000'' on the other, as in Greek, unlike English, all three or all four if one were to include ''stadia'', words are [[Inflection|inflected]]). This has been translated either as 4,080,000 ''[[stadion (unit of length)|stadia]]'' (1903 translation by [[Edwin Hamilton Gifford]]), or as 804,000,000 ''stadia'' (edition of [[Édouard des Places]], dated 1974–1991).

A Chinese mathematical treatise, the ''[[Zhou Bi Suan Jing|Zhoubi suanjing]]'' (c. 1st century BCE), shows how the distance to the Sun can be computed geometrically, using the different lengths of the noontime shadows observed at three places 1000 [[Li (length)|li]] apart and the assumption that the Earth is flat.<ref>{{citation|first=G.

In the 2nd century CE, [[Ptolemy]] estimated the mean distance of the Sun as 1,210 times the [[Earth radius]].<ref>{{citation|first=Bernard R.|last=Goldstein|title=The Arabic Version of Ptolemy's ''Planetary Hypotheses''|journal=Trans. Am. Phil. Soc.|volume=57|issue=4|year=1967|pages=9–12}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=van Helden|first=Albert|title=Measuring the Universe: Cosmic Dimensions from Aristarchus to Halley|place=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1985|pages=15–27|isbn=0-226-84882-5}}</ref> To determine this value, Ptolemy started by measuring the Moon's parallax, finding what amounted to a horizontal lunar parallax of 1° 26′, which was much too large. He then derived a maximum lunar distance of 64 1/6 Earth radii. Because of cancelling errors in his parallax figure, his theory of the Moon's orbit, and other factors, this figure was approximately correct.<ref name=vh1619>pp. 16–19, van Helden 1985</ref><ref>p. 251, ''Ptolemy's Almagest'',
translated and annotated by G. J. Toomer, London: Duckworth, 1984, ISBN 0-7156-1588-2</ref> He then measured the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon and concluded that the apparent diameter of the Sun was equal to the apparent diameter of the Moon at the Moon's greatest distance, and from records of lunar eclipses, he estimated this apparent diameter, as well as the apparent diameter of the shadow cone of the Earth traversed by the Moon during a lunar eclipse. Given these data, the distance of the Sun from the Earth can be trigonometrically computed to be 1,210 Earth radii. This gives a ratio of solar to lunar distance of approximately 19, matching Aristarchus's figure. Although Ptolemy's procedure is theoretically workable, it is very sensitive to small changes in the data, so much so that changing a measurement by a few percent can make the solar distance infinite.<ref name=vh1619/>

After Greek astronomy was transmitted to the medieval Islamic world, astronomers made some changes to Ptolemy's cosmological model, but did not greatly change his estimate of the Earth–Sun distance. For example, in his introduction to Ptolemaic astronomy, [[al-Farghānī]] gave a mean solar distance of 1,170 Earth radii, while in his ''[[zij]]'', [[al-Battānī]] used a mean solar distance of 1,108 Earth radii. Subsequent astronomers, such as [[al-Bīrūnī]], used similar values.<ref>pp. 29–33, van Helden 1985</ref> Later in Europe, [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] and [[Tycho Brahe]] also used comparable figures (1,142 Earth radii and 1,150 Earth radii), and so Ptolemy's approximate Earth–Sun distance survived through the 16th century.<ref>pp. 41–53, van Helden 1985</ref>

[[Johannes Kepler]] was the first to realize that Ptolemy's estimate must be significantly too low (according to Kepler, at least by a factor of three) in his ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' (1627). [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] allowed astronomers to calculate the relative distances of the planets from the Sun, and rekindled interest in measuring the absolute value for the Earth (which could then be applied to the other planets). The invention of the [[telescope]] allowed far more accurate measurements of angles than is possible with the naked eye. Flemish astronomer [[Godefroy Wendelin]] repeated Aristarchus' measurements in 1635, and found that Ptolemy's value was too low by a factor of at least eleven.

A somewhat more accurate estimate can be obtained by observing the [[transit of Venus]].<ref name=Bell>

An extended historical discussion of this method is provided by {{cite web |title=Quest for the astronomical unit |author =Trudy E Bell |url=http://www.tbp.org/pages/publications/bent/features/su04bell.pdf |work=The Bent of Tau Beta Pi, Summer 2004, p. 20 |accessdate=2012-01-16}}

</ref> By measuring the transit in two different locations, one can accurately calculate the [[parallax]] of Venus and from the relative distance of the Earth and Venus from the Sun, the [[Parallax#Solar_parallax|solar parallax]] ''α'' (which cannot be measured directly<ref name="Weaver">{{citation|last=Weaver|first=Harold F.|title=The Solar Parallax|bibcode=1943ASPL....4..144W|year=1943|journal=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets|volume=4|pages=144–51}}</ref>). [[Jeremiah Horrocks]] had attempted to produce an estimate based on [[Transit of Venus, 1639|his observation of the 1639 transit]] (published in 1662), giving a solar parallax of 15 [[arcsecond]]s, similar to Wendelin's figure. The solar parallax is related to the Earth–Sun distance as measured in [[Earth radius|Earth radii]] by
:<math>A = {\cot\alpha}.</math>
The smaller the solar parallax, the greater the distance between the Sun and the Earth: a solar parallax of 15" is equivalent to an Earth–Sun distance of 13,750 Earth radii.

[[Christiaan Huygens]] believed the distance was even greater: by comparing the apparent sizes of Venus and [[Mars]], he estimated a value of about 24,000 Earth radii,<ref>{{citation|last=Goldstein|first=S. J., Jr.|title=Christiaan Huygens' Measurement of the Distance to the Sun|bibcode=1985Obs...105...32G|journal=Observatory|year=1985|volume=105|pages=32–33}}</ref> equivalent to a solar parallax of 8.6". Although Huygens' estimate is remarkably close to modern values, it is often discounted by historians of astronomy because of the many unproven (and incorrect) assumptions he had to make for his method to work; the accuracy of his value seems to be based more on luck than good measurement, with his various errors cancelling each other out.

[[File:Venustransit 2004-06-08 07-44.jpg|thumb|right|Transits of Venus across the face of the Sun were, for a long time, the best method of measuring the astronomical unit, despite the difficulties (here, the so-called "[[black drop effect]]") and the rarity of observations.]]
[[Jean Richer]] and [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] measured the parallax of Mars between [[Paris]] and [[Cayenne]] in [[French Guiana]] when Mars was at its closest to Earth in 1672. They arrived at a figure for the solar parallax of 9½", equivalent to an Earth–Sun distance of about 22,000 Earth radii. They were also the first astronomers to have access to an accurate and reliable value for the radius of the Earth, which had been measured by their colleague [[Jean Picard]] in 1669 as 3,269 thousand ''[[toise]]s''. Another colleague, [[Ole Rømer]], discovered the finite [[speed of light]] in 1676: the speed was so great that it was usually quoted as the time required for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth, or "light time per unit distance", a convention that is still followed by astronomers today.

A better method for observing Venus transits was devised by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] and published in his ''[[Optica Promata]]'' (1663). It was strongly advocated by [[Edmond Halley]]<ref>{{citation|last=Halley|first=E.|authorlink=Edmond Halley|year=1716|title=A new Method of determining the Parallax of the Sun, or his Distance from the Earth|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=29|pages=454–64|url=http://www.dsellers.demon.co.uk/venus/ven_ch8.htm}}</ref> and was applied to the transits of Venus observed in 1761 and 1769, and then again in 1874 and 1882. Transits of Venus occur in pairs, but less than one pair every century, and observing the transits in 1761 and 1769 was an unprecedented international scientific operation. Despite the [[Seven Years' War]], dozens of astronomers were dispatched to observing points around the world at great expense and personal danger: several of them died in the endeavour.<ref>{{citation|last=Pogge|first=Richard|title=How Far to the Sun?

Another method involved determining the constant of [[aberration of light|aberration]], and [[Simon Newcomb]] gave great weight to this method when deriving his widely accepted value of 8.80″ for the solar parallax (close to the modern value of 8.794143″), although Newcomb also used data from the transits of Venus. Newcomb also collaborated with [[Albert Abraham Michelson|A.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Michelson]] to measure the speed of light with Earth-based equipment; combined with the constant of aberration (which is related to the light time per unit distance) this gave the first direct measurement of the Earth–Sun distance in kilometers. Newcomb's value for the solar parallax (and for the constant of aberration and the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]) were incorporated into the first international system of [[astronomical constant]]s in 1896,<ref>Conférence internationale des étoiles fondamentales, Paris, 18–21 May 1896</ref> which remained in place for the calculation of [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] until 1964.<ref>Resolution No. 4 of the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1964_French.pdf XIIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Hamburg, 1964</ref> The name "astronomical unit" appears first to have been used in 1903.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astronomical%20unit astronomical unit] Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary</ref>

The discovery of the [[near-Earth asteroid]] [[433 Eros]] and its passage near the Earth in 1900–1901 allowed a considerable improvement in parallax measurement.<ref>{{citation|last=Hinks|first=Arthur R.|authorlink=Arthur Robert Hinks|title=Solar Parallax Papers No. 7: The General Solution from the Photographic Right Ascensions of Eros, at the Opposition of 1900|journal=Month.

R. Astron. Soc.|volume=66|year=1941|pages=11–66}}</ref>

Direct radar measurements of the distances to Venus and Mars became available in the early 1960s. Along with improved measurements of the speed of light, these showed that Newcomb's values for the solar parallax and the constant of aberration were inconsistent with one another.<ref>{{citation|last=Mikhailov|first=A. A.|year=1964|title=The Constant of Aberration and the Solar Parallax|bibcode=1964SvA.....7..737M|journal=Sov. Astron.|volume=7|issue=6|pages=737–39}}</ref>

==Developments==
[[Image:Stellarparallax parsec1.svg|thumb|right|The astronomical distance unit [[parsec]] uses the au as a baseline and an angle of one [[arcsecond]] for [[parallax]]. 1 au and 1 pc not to scale. (See also [[stellar parallax]])]]
The unit distance ''A'' (the value of the astronomical unit in meters) can be expressed in terms of other [[astronomical constant]]s:
:<math>A^3 = \frac{G M_\odot D^2}{k^2}</math>
where ''G'' is the [[Newtonian gravitational constant]], ''M''<sub>☉</sub> is the [[solar mass]], ''k'' is the numerical value of [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] and ''D'' is the time period of one day.
The Sun is constantly losing mass by radiating away energy,<ref>{{citation|author=Noerdlinger, Peter D.|arxiv=0801.3807|title=Solar Mass Loss, the Astronomical Unit, and the Scale of the Solar System|journal=[[Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy|Celest. Mech. Dynam. Astron.]]|bibcode = 2008arXiv0801.3807N|volume=0801|year=2008|pages=3807 }}</ref> so the orbits of the planets are steadily expanding outward from the Sun. This has led to calls to abandon the astronomical unit as a unit of measurement.<ref>{{citation|url=http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn13286-astronomical-unit-may-need-to-be-redefined.html?feedId=online-news_rss20|title=AU may need to be redefined|newspaper=New Scientist|date=6 February 2008}}</ref> There have also been calls to redefine the astronomical unit in terms of a fixed number of meters.<ref>{{cite arXiv|last1=Capitaine|first1=N|last2=Guinot|first2=B|eprint=0812.2970|title=The astronomical units|year=2008|version=v1|class=astro-ph}}</ref>

As the [[speed of light]] has an exact defined value in SI units and the Gaussian gravitational constant ''k'' is fixed in the [[astronomical system of units]], measuring the light time per unit distance is exactly equivalent to measuring the product ''GM''<sub>☉</sub> in SI units. Hence, it is possible to construct ephemerides entirely in SI units, which is increasingly becoming the norm.

A 2004 analysis of radiometric measurements in the inner Solar System suggested that the [[secular variation|secular increase]] in the unit distance was much larger than can be accounted for by solar radiation, +15±4&nbsp;meters per century.<ref>{{citation|author=Krasinsky, G. A.; Brumberg, V. A.|title=Secular increase of astronomical unit from analysis of the major planet motions, and its interpretation|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g5051650115444k9/|journal=Celest. Mech. Dynam.

The measurements of the secular variations of the astronomical unit are not confirmed by other authors and are quite controversial. 
Furthermore, since 2010, the astronomical unit is not yet estimated by the planetary ephemerides.<ref>{{citation|author=Fienga, A.et al.|title=The INPOP10a planetary ephemeris and its applications in fundamental physics|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k5456227385812m7/?MUD=MP|journal=Celest.
