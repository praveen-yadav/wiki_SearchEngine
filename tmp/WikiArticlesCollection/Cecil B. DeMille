'''Cecil Blount DeMille''' (August 12, 1881 – January 21, 1959) was an American film director and film producer in both silent and sound films.<ref>"Cecil B. DeMille Obituary." ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', January 28, 1959.</ref>

DeMille began his career as a stage actor in 1900. He later moved on to writing and directing stage productions. He directed his first film, ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'', released in 1914 and would go on to direct dozens of silent films before crossing to sound films in 1929.

DeMille was renowned for the flamboyance and showmanship of his movies. Among his best-known films are ''[[Cleopatra (1934 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1934); ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (1949); ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' (1952), which won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]; and ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), which was his last and most successful film. In addition to his Academy Award win, he was also awarded an [[Academy Honorary Award]] for his film contributions, the [[Palme d'Or]], a [[Directors Guild of America Award|DGA Award]] for Lifetime Achievement, and the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]]. He was also the first recipient of the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]], which is named in his honor.

He was married to [[Constance Adams DeMille]] in 1902 with whom he had four children: Cecilia, [[Katherine DeMille|Katherine]], John, and [[Richard de Mille|Richard]]. DeMille died in January 1959 of a heart ailment at the age of 77.

==Early life==
DeMille was born in [[Ashfield, Massachusetts]], while his parents were vacationing there, and grew up in [[Washington, North Carolina]]. While he is known as DeMille (his nom d'oeuvre), his family name was Dutch and is usually spelled "de Mil".<ref>DeMille, Cecil B. [http://www.archive.org/stream/autobiographyofc006995mbp/autobiographyofc006995mbp_djvu.txt ''Autobiography of Cecil B. DeMille.''] New York: [[Prentice Hall]], 1959.</ref> His father, [[Henry Churchill de Mille]] (1853–1893), was a [[North Carolina]]-born dramatist and lay reader in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], who had earlier begun a career as a playwright, writing his first play at age 15. His mother was Matilda Beatrice DeMille (née Samuel), whose parents were both of German Jewish heritage. She emigrated from England with her parents in 1871 when she was 18, where they settled in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]]. According to biographer Carol Easton, Beatrice grew up in a middle-class English household.<ref name=Easton>{{harv|Easton|1996|pp=6–8}}</ref>

He had an elder brother [[William C. deMille|William]], and a sister, Agnes, who died in childhood. DeMille's [[Agnes de Mille|niece]], who later became a dancer and choreographer, was named after her. He is credited with providing her name.

DeMille's parents met while they were both members of a local music and literary society in New York. She was attracted to Henry, a tall, redheaded student who shared her love of the theater. While he was "slender and mild-mannered", she had dark good looks that "must have seemed to him exotic", writes Easton. She was also intelligent, educated, forthright, and strong-willed, and they were mutually attracted to each other. They were both born in 1853. She would later convert to Henry's faith when they married.<ref name=Easton /> Henry worked as a playwright, administrator, and faculty member during the early years of The [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]], established in New York City in 1884.

They lived in [[Wayne, New Jersey]] in a house built by Henry DeMille. The family spent much time in [[Pompton Lakes, New Jersey]], operating a private school in that town and attending Christ Episcopal Church there. Cecil B. DeMille had said that it was while attending that church where he got the idea for ''The Ten Commandments''.<ref>http://www.northjersey.com/community/history/back_in_the_day/130098403_Sept__18__1991_De_Mille_s_Pompton_Lakes_roots_recalled.html</ref>

In 1893, at the age of 40, Henry contracted [[typhoid fever]] and died, leaving Beatrice with three children, a house, and no savings. Cecil was 11 at the time. Until Henry's sudden death, they had both loved the theater, and she "enthusiastically supported" her husband's theatrical aspirations. Recognizing his love of the theater and his efforts to become a playwright and producer, she wrote at his funeral:

:"May your sons be as fine and as noble and good and honest as you were. May they follow in your steps . . . "<ref name=Easton />

Within eight weeks after his death, to provide an income for the family, Beatrice opened an acting workshop in her home, the Henry C. De Mille School for Girls. She would later become one of the few successful women theater promoters on Broadway.<ref name=Easton /> DeMille attended [[Widener University|Pennsylvania Military College]] in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]] from the age of 15. Both he (Class of 1900) and his brother William (Class of 1901) also attended and graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, which they attended on scholarship. The Academy later honored DeMille with an Alumni Achievement Award.

==Career==

===Broadway===
DeMille began his career as an actor on the Broadway stage in the theatrical company of [[Charles Frohman]] in 1900. His brother William was already establishing himself as a playwright and sometimes worked in collaboration with Cecil. DeMille co-starred with some of the men and women whom he would later direct in films (i.e. [[Charlotte Walker (actress)|Charlotte Walker]], [[Mary Pickford]], and [[Pedro de Cordoba (actor)|Pedro de Cordoba]], among others). DeMille also served as producer and/or director for many plays.<ref>[http://ibdb.com/person.php?id=4709 "Cecil B. DeMille plays."] ''IMDb.'' Retrieved: December 8, 2011.</ref> De Mille found success in the spring of 1913 producing ''Reckless Age'' by Lee Wilson. The story about a high society girl wrongly accused of manslaughter starred [[Frederick Burton (actor)|Frederick Burton]] and [[Sydney Shields]].<ref>[http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2010/New%20York%20NY%20Dramatic%20Mirror/New%20York%20NY%20Dramatic%20Mirror%201913%20Mar-Apr%201914%20Grayscale/New%20York%20NY%20Dramatic%20Mirror%201913%20Mar-Apr%201914%20Grayscale%20-%200391.pdf "News of Other Cities, Atlantic City."] ''New York Dramatic Mirror'', May 14, 1913.</ref><ref>{{harv|Birchard|2004|p=2}}</ref> Some of these plays were later adapted into silent and sound films. DeMille and his brother occasionally worked with [[David Belasco]]. Belasco was legendary for the way he lit his stage scenes, as well as creating a lurid atmosphere. In 1911, Belasco premiered a play titled ''The Return of Peter Grimm''. DeMille claimed he wrote the play and that Belasco had [[plagiarized]] DeMille's work without compensation. DeMille later adopted many of Belasco's stage lighting and atmospheric techniques in such films as ''[[The Cheat (1915 film)|The Cheat]]'', a move some saw as revenge against Belasco.

===Motion pictures===
DeMille entered films in 1913. He directed dozens of [[silent film|silent]] films, including [[Paramount Pictures]]' first production, ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1914), which was co-directed by [[Oscar Apfel]], before coming into huge popularity during the late 1910s and early 1920s, when he reached the apex of his popularity with such films as ''[[Don't Change Your Husband]]'' (1919), ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1923), and ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' (1927).  A few of his silent films featured scenes in two-color [[Technicolor]].

[[File:Demille - c1920.JPG|thumb|left|c.1920]]
DeMille remade his early hit ''The Squaw Man'' twice, once as a silent film ''[[The Squaw Man (1918 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1918) and then as a sound film ''[[The Squaw Man (1931 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1931). All three were based on a hit play ''[[The Squaw Man (play)|The Squaw Man]]'' about a wrongly disgraced British aristocrat who settles in the [[Wild West]].

Cecil B. DeMille was known for being an instrumental catalyst for the rising status of many a struggling or unknown actor. Actor [[Richard Dix (actor)|Richard Dix]]'s best-remembered early role was in the silent version of DeMille's ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''. [[Richard Cromwell (actor)|Richard Cromwell]] owed his 1930s movie fame in part to being personally selected by DeMille for the role as the leader of the youth gang in DeMille's poignant, now cult-favorite, ''[[This Day and Age (film)|This Day and Age]]'' (1933). To ensure that Cromwell's character used current slang, DeMille asked [[Horace Hahn]] to read the script and comment (at the time, Hahn was senior class president at Los Angeles High School).<ref>{{harv|Birchard|2004|pp=262–263}}</ref>

DeMille displayed a loyalty to certain supporting performers, casting them repeatedly in his pictures. They included [[Henry Wilcoxon]], [[Julia Faye]], [[Joseph Schildkraut]], [[Ian Keith]], [[Charles Bickford]], [[Theodore Roberts]], [[Akim Tamiroff]] and [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]]. He also cast leading actors such as [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Jetta Goudal]], [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]], [[Paulette Goddard]] and [[Charlton Heston]] in multiple pictures. He was not known as a particularly good director of actors, often hiring actors whom he relied on to develop their own characters and act accordingly.

[[File:Cecil b de mille directing.png|thumb|Cecil B. DeMille directing]]
DeMille had a reputation for tyrannical behavior on the set, and he despised actors who were unwilling to take physical risks. Such was the case with [[Victor Mature]] in ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'', when Mature refused to wrestle the lion, though the lion was tame and toothless. (DeMille remarked that Mature was "100% yellow"). [[Paulette Goddard]]'s refusal to risk personal injury in a scene involving fire in ''[[Unconquered]]'' cost her DeMille's favor and probably a role in ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth]]''. DeMille was, however, adept at directing "thousands of extras", and many of his pictures included spectacular set pieces, such as the parting of the [[Red Sea]] in both versions of ''The Ten Commandments'', the toppling of the [[Paganism|pagan]] temple in ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'', train wrecks in ''[[The Road to Yesterday]]'', ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' and ''The Greatest Show on Earth'', and the destruction of a zeppelin in ''[[Madame Satan]]''.

[[File:Cecil B DeMille 1937.JPG|thumb|DeMille as producer of the CBS Radio Theatre, 1937]]
DeMille was one of the first directors in Hollywood to become a celebrity in his own right. From 1936 to 1944, DeMille hosted and acted as pitchman for Cecil B. DeMille's ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'', a popular dramatic radio show of the time. [[Gloria Swanson]] immortalized DeMille with the oft-repeated line, "All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up" in [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', wherein DeMille played himself. DeMille also appeared as himself in Paramount's 1947 all-star musical comedy ''[[Variety Girl]]'' and he narrated many of his later films, as well as appearing on screen in the introduction to ''The Ten Commandments''.

DeMille first used three-strip [[Technicolor]] in ''[[Northwest Mounted Police (film)|Northwest Mounted Police]]'' (1940). Following the favorable response to the vivid color photography, shot partly on location in the [[Canadian Rockies]], DeMille decided to always use Technicolor in his films.

While he continued to be prolific throughout the 1930s and 1940s, he is probably best known for his 1956 film ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (which is very different from his 1923 film of the same title). Also representative of his penchant for the spectacular was the 1952 production of ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' which gave DeMille an [[Academy award|Oscar]] for best picture and a nomination for best director.

In 1949 or 1950, DeMille was recruited by [[Allen Dulles]] and [[Frank Wisner]] to serve on the board of the [[anti-communist]] [[National Committee for a Free Europe]], the public face of the organization that oversaw the [[Radio Free Europe]] service.<ref>{{harv|Weiner|2007|p=36}}</ref> In 1954, Secretary of the Air Force [[Harold E. Talbott]] sought out DeMille for help in designing the cadet uniforms at the newly established [[United States Air Force Academy]]. DeMille's designs—most notably his design of the distinctive cadet parade uniform—won praise from Air Force and Academy leadership, were ultimately adopted, and are worn by cadets today.<ref>Radford, Bill. "A Digger, A Director and A Practical Joker". ''Colorado Springs Gazette'', USAF Academy 50th Anniversary Edition, Spring 2004.</ref>

Near the end of his life, DeMille began pre-production work on a film biography of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell]], the founder of the [[Scouting|Scout Movement]] and had asked [[David Niven]] to star in the film, which was never made. Because of illness, he asked his son-in-law, actor [[Anthony Quinn]], to direct a remake of his 1938 film ''[[The Buccaneer (1958 film)|The Buccaneer]]''; although DeMille served as executive producer, he was unhappy with Quinn's work and tried unsuccessfully to remedy the situation. Despite a cast led by [[Charlton Heston]] and [[Yul Brynner]] and some impressive battle scenes, the film was considered a disappointment by many.

Though DeMille was respected by his peers, his individual films were often criticized by them. "Directorially, I think his pictures were the most horrible things I've ever seen in my life", said director [[William Wellman]]. "But he put on pictures that made a fortune. In that respect, he was better than any of us."<ref>{{harv|Brownlow|1976|p=185}}</ref> Critic [[Pauline Kael]] called De Mille "a sanctimonious manipulator – [he] used to satisfy the voyeuristic needs of the God-abiding by showing them what they were missing by being good and then soothe them by showing them the terrible punishments they escaped by being good."<ref>Kael, Pauline. "The Current Cinema: Fellini's Mondo Trasho." ''The New Yorker'', March 14, 1970, p. 134.</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:DeMilleTomb.JPG|thumb|175px|right|DeMille's tomb at Hollywood Forever Cemetery]]
DeMille married [[Constance Adams DeMille|Constance Adams]] on August 16, 1902 and had one child, Cecilia. They also adopted two sons, John and [[Richard de Mille|Richard]], the latter of whom became a notable filmmaker, author, and psychologist. The couple also adopted [[Katherine DeMille|Katherine Lester]] in the early 1920s; her father had been killed in [[World War I]] and her mother had died of [[tuberculosis]]. Katherine married Anthony Quinn.

DeMille was a highly active [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. In [[U.S. presidential election, 1944|1944]], he was the [[master of ceremonies]] at the massive rally organized by [[David O. Selznick]] in the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] in support of the [[Thomas E. Dewey|Dewey]]-[[John W. Bricker|Bricker]] ticket as well as [[governor of California|Governor]] [[Earl Warren]] of California, who would become Dewey's running mate in 1948 and later the [[Chief Justice of the United States]]. The gathering drew 93,000, with short speeches by [[Hedda Hopper]] and [[Walt Disney]]. Among those in attendance were [[Ann Sothern]], [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Randolph Scott]], [[Adolphe Menjou]], [[Gary Cooper]], and [[Walter Pidgeon]]. Though the rally drew a good response, most Hollywood celebrities who took a public position sided with the [[Franklin Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]-[[Harry Truman|Truman]] ticket.<ref name="David M. Jordan 2011 pp. 231-232">David M. Jordan, ''FDR, Dewey, and the Election of 1944'' (Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 2011), pp. 231–232</ref>

==Death==
During on-location filming in [[Egypt]] of the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] sequence for 1956's ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'', the then-75-year-old DeMille climbed a 107-foot ladder to the top of the massive Per Rameses set and suffered a near-fatal heart attack. Against his doctor's orders, DeMille was back directing the film within a week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/dvd/2011-04-01-dvdextra-ten-commandments_N.htm|title=DVD extra: 'Ten Commandments' gets HD treatment|last=Jones|first=Steve|date=April 1, 2011|publisher=usatoday.com|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref>

Though DeMille completed the film, it proved to be his last for he never fully recovered. His doctor made a house call to him on evening of January 20, 1959 and recommended he go to the hospital, and he replied, "No, I think I'll be going to the morgue instead,"{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} and again did not follow his doctor's orders.  He died on January 21, 1959 of a heart ailment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0812.html|title=Cecil De Mille, 77, Pioneer of Movies, Dead in Hollywood|date=January 22, 1959|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref> DeMille's funeral was held on January 23 at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church. He was entombed in [[Hollywood Memorial Cemetery]] (now known as [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]]).<ref>{{harv|Donnelley|2009|p=318}}</ref> At the time of his death, he was planning to direct a movie about space travel. He also wanted to do a film on the biblical [[Book of Revelation]].<ref>{{harv|Eyman|2010|pp=494–496, 500}}</ref>
Upon his passing TIME magazine stated it was "the end of DeMillenium."

==Legacy and honors==
For his contribution to the motion picture and radio industry, Cecil B. DeMille has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. The first, for radio contributions, is located at 6240 Vine Street. The second star is located at 1725 Vine Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/cecil-b-demille/|title=Hollywood Star Walk: Cecil B. DeMille|last=Blake|first=Gene|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref>

Most of the DeMille motion picture library now resides with [[EMKA, Ltd.]], through the [[Universal Television|television division]] of [[NBCUniversal]], due to Paramount Pictures' losing the rights to the DeMille films in 1958 to EMKA. So technically it is [[Universal Pictures]] that now oversees a vast part of DeMille's motion picture career as well as its related archival material.  ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'', although pre-1950, has been retained by Paramount, as are all the DeMille/Paramount silent films produced before 1928, and all sound films produced after 1950. Television distribution for those films is handled by [[Trifecta Entertainment & Media]].  However, the pre-1950 films DeMille produced for [[MGM]] are now owned by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] (through [[Turner Entertainment]]).

In the mid-1950s, DeMille oversaw the development of a family of distinctive uniforms designed for use by the cadets at the new [[United States Air Force Academy]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]].  For this, he received the Defense Department's Exceptional Service Award.

The former film building at [[Chapman University]] in [[Orange, California]] is named in honor of DeMille. The [[Lawrence and Kristina Dodge College of Film and Media Arts]] now resides in Marion Knotts Studios.

The [[Golden Globe]]'s annual [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]] recognizes lifetime achievement in the film industry.

Two schools are named after him, Cecil B. DeMille Middle School, in [[Long Beach, California]], closed and demolished in 2007 to make way for a new high school, and Cecil B. DeMille Elementary School in [[Midway City, California]].
