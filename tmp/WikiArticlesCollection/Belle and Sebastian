==History==

===Formation and early years (1996–1998)===
Belle and Sebastian were formed in Glasgow in 1996 by [[Stuart Murdoch (musician)|Stuart Murdoch]] and [[Stuart David]].<ref name="a2x"/> Together, with [[Stow College]] music professor [[Alan Rankine]], they recorded some demos; these demos were picked up by the college's Music Business course that produces and releases one single each year on the college's label, [[Electric Honey (label)|Electric Honey]]. As the band had a number of songs already and the label was extremely impressed with the demos, Belle and Sebastian were allowed to record a full-length album, which was titled ''[[Tigermilk]]''. Murdoch once described the band as a "product of botched capitalism".<ref name="a2x"/>

''Tigermilk'' was recorded in three days and originally only one thousand copies were pressed on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]].<ref name="grd"/> These original copies now sell for up to £400.<ref name="rse">{{Citation |last=Pareles |first=John |title=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll |publisher=[[Fireside Publishing]] |year=2001 |page=66 |isbn=0-7432-0120-5}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Shiel |first=George |title=Tigermilk |url=http://www.eclectichoney.com/tigermilk.html |work=Eclectic Honey |accessdate=4 November 2007 |format=<sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3AShiel+intitle%3ATigermilk&as_publication=&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070616110535/http://www.eclectichoney.com/tigermilk.html |archivedate = 16 June 2007}}</ref><ref name="pbs">{{Citation |title=Belle and Sebastian 2nd Melbourne show! |url=http://www.pbsfm.org.au/Documents.asp?ID=2536&Title=Belle+and+Sebastian+2nd+Melbourne+show!++ |work=PBS 106.7FM |accessdate=4 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070916203738/http://pbsfm.org.au/Documents.asp?ID=2536&Title=Belle+and+Sebastian+2nd+Melbourne+show!++ |archivedate = 16 September 2007}}</ref> The warm reception the album received inspired Murdoch and David to turn the band into a full-time project, recruiting [[Stevie Jackson]] (guitar and vocals), [[Isobel Campbell]] (cello/vocals), [[Chris Geddes]] (keys) and [[Richard Colburn]] (drums) to fill out the group.

After the success of the debut album, Belle and Sebastian were signed to [[Jeepster Records]] in August 1996 and ''[[If You're Feeling Sinister]]'', their second album, was released on 18 November.<ref name="pbs"/> The album was named by ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' as one of the 100 greatest albums between 1985 and 2005,<ref>{{Citation |title=100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005 |url=http://www.spin.com/articles/100-greatest-albums-1985-2005 |work=Spin |date=20 June 2005 |accessdate=11 November 2007}}</ref> and is widely considered the band's masterpiece.<ref name="notebook"/> Just before the recording of ''Sinister'', [[Sarah Martin (musician)|Sarah Martin]] (violin/vocals) joined the band. Following this a series of EPs were released in 1997.<ref>{{Citation |last=Hornby |first=Nick |title=Lazy Line Painter Jane |url=http://www.salon.com/music/sharps/1997/11/14sharps.html |work=Salon |date=14 November 1997 |accessdate=5 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071210214633/http://www.salon.com/music/sharps/1997/11/14sharps.html| archivedate= 10 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The first of these was ''[[Dog on Wheels]]'', which contained four demo tracks recorded before the real formation of the band. In fact, the only long-term band members to play on the songs were Murdoch, David, and [[Mick Cooke]], who played trumpet on the EP but would not officially join the band until a few years later. It charted at No.&nbsp;59 in the UK singles chart.<ref name="pbs"/>

The ''[[Lazy Line Painter Jane]]'' EP followed in July. The track was recorded in the church where Murdoch lived<ref name="lim">{{Citation |last=Lim |first=Dennis |title=Winter of Their Youth |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/1998-09-15/music/winter-of-their-youth/ |work=The Village Voice |date=15 September 1998 |accessdate=5 November 2007}}</ref> and features vocals from [[Monica Queen]]. The EP narrowly missed out of the UK top 40, peaking at No.&nbsp;41.<ref name="pbs"/> The last of the 1997 EPs was October's ''[[3.. 6.. 9 Seconds of Light]]''. The EP was made Single of the Week in both the ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and reached No.&nbsp;32 in the charts, thus becoming the band's first top 40 single.<ref name="pbs"/>

In 1999 the band was awarded with Best Newcomer (for their third album) at the [[BRIT Awards]], upsetting better-known acts such as [[Steps (band)|Steps]] and [[5ive]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Robbie rules over Brits |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/brit_awards/280847.stm |publisher=BBC |date=17 February 1999 |accessdate=4 November 2007}}</ref> That same year, the band hosted their own festival, the [[Bowlie Weekender]]. ''[[Tigermilk]]'' was also given a full release by [[Jeepster Records|Jeepster]] before the band started work on their next LP. The result was ''[[Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant]]'', which became the band's first top 10 album in the UK.<ref name="pbs"/> A stand-alone single, "[[Legal Man]]", reached No.&nbsp;15 and gave them their first appearance on [[Top of the Pops]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Urban |first=Andy |title=Side Project Becomes Full-Length Let Down |url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/237 |work=Dusted Magazine |date=18 June 2002 |accessdate=4 November 2007}}</ref>
