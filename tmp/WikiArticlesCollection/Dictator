A '''dictator''' is a ruler who does not rule through democratic means. When other states call the [[head of state]] of a particular state a dictator, that state is called a [[dictatorship]]. The word originated as the title of a [[Roman dictator|magistrate]] in [[ancient Rome]] appointed by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to rule the republic in times of emergency (see [[Roman dictator]] and ''[[justitium]]'').<ref>

Like the term "[[tyrant]]" (which was originally a respectable Ancient Greek title), and to a lesser degree "autocrat", "dictator" came to be used almost exclusively as a non-titular term for oppressive, even abusive rule, yet had rare modern titular use.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In modern usage, the term "dictator" is generally used to describe a leader who holds and/or abuses an extraordinary amount of [[Superiority complex|personal power]], especially the power to make [[law]]s without effective restraint by a [[legislative assembly]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. Dictatorships are often characterised by some of the following traits: suspension of [[election]]s and of [[civil liberties]]; proclamation of a [[state of emergency]]; [[rule by decree]]; [[political repression|repression of political opponents]] without abiding by [[rule of law]] procedures; these include [[single-party state]], and [[cult of personality]].{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The term "dictator" is comparable to{{sndash}} but not synonymous with{{sndash}} the ancient concept of a tyrant; initially "tyrant", like "dictator", did not carry negative connotations. A wide variety of leaders coming to power in a number of different kinds of regimes, such as [[military junta]]s, [[single-party state]]s and civilian governments under personal rule, have been described as dictators. They may hold [[far-left|left]] or [[far-right|right-wing]] views, or can even be [[apolitical]].

==Roman origin==
{{Main|Roman dictator}}
[[File:0092 - Wien - Kunsthistorisches Museum - Gaius Julius Caesar-edit.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Julius Caesar]] was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] general whose dictatorship was pivotal in Rome's transition from republic to empire.]]
In the [[Roman Republic]] the term "Dictator" did not have the negative meaning it has later assumed. Rather, a Dictator was a person given sole power (unlike the normal Roman republican practice, where rule was divided between two equal [[Consul]]s) for a specific limited period, in order to deal with an emergency. At the end of his term, the Dictator was supposed to hand power over to the normal Consular rule and give account of his actions{{sndash}} and Roman dictators usually did.

The term started to get its modern negative meaning with [[Cornelius Sulla]]'s ascension to the [[dictatorship]] following [[Sulla's second civil war]], making himself the first Dictator in more than a century (during which the office was ostensibly abolished) as well as ''de facto'' eliminating the time limit and need of senatorial acclamation, although he avoided a major constitutional crisis by resigning the office after about one year due to poor health, dying shortly after. Caesar followed the example in 49 BC and in February 44 BC was proclaimed ''Dictator perpetuo'', "Dictator in perpetuity", officially doing away with any limitations on his power, which he kept until his assassination the following month.

==Garibaldi as a positive dictator==
Still, even in the 19th Century, the term "Dictator" did not always have negative connotations. For example, the Italian revolutionary [[Garibaldi]], during his famous [[Expedition of the Thousand]] in 1860, proclaimed himself "Dictator of [[Sicily]]", which did not prevent him from being extremely popular in Italian and international public opinion. His usage of the term was clearly derived from the original Roman sense{{sndash}} i.e., a person taking power for a limited time in order to deal with an emergency (in this case, the need to unite Italy) and with the task done Garibaldi handed over power to the government of [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]]. A few years later, during the Polish [[January Uprising]] of 1863, General [[Romuald Traugutt]] also bore the title of "Dictator" as an official and positive designation - possibly directly influenced by the then fresh example of Garibaldi.

Garibaldi's case was, however, an exception. In general, the term "dictator" came to be a negative term, not a title used by rulers to call themselves but a term used by the foes of an oppressive ruler. Such was the case with [[Maximillien Robespierre]], whose supporters knew him as "The Incorruptible", while his opponents called him "dictateur sanguinaire", French for "bloodthirsty dictator".

== Modern era ==
[[Image:Democracyindex2.png|thumb|250px|[[Democracy Index]] by [[The Economist]], 2012. Countries marked in dark colors are authoritarian, and most often dictatorships. Most of current dictatorships are in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].<ref>[http://www.economist.com/markets/rankings/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8908438 Liberty and justice for some] at [[The Economist|Economist.com]]</ref>]]
In popular usage in western nations, "dictatorship" is often associated with brutality and oppression. As a result, it is often also used as a term of abuse for political opponents.The term has also come to be associated with [[megalomania]]. Many dictators create a [[cult of personality]] and have come to favor increasingly grandiloquent titles and honours for themselves. For instance, [[Idi Amin|Idi Amin Dada]], who had been a British army [[lieutenant]] prior to [[Uganda]]'s independence from Britain in October 1962, subsequently styled himself as "''[[Excellency|His Excellency]], [[President for Life]], [[Field Marshal (Uganda)|Field Marshal]] [[Hajji|Al Hadji]] [[Doctor of Laws|Doctor]]{{Ref label|Doctorate|A|}} Idi Amin Dada, <small>VC</small>,{{Ref label|VC|B|}} <small>[[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]]</small>, Conqueror of the [[British Empire]] in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular''".<ref name="guardian_obit">{{cite news |last=Keatley |first=Patrick |title=Obituary: Idi Amin |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=18 August 2003 |accessdate=2008-03-18 |location=London}}</ref> In the [[movie]] "[[The Great Dictator]]" (1940), [[Charlie Chaplin]] satirized not only [[Adolf Hitler]] but the institution of dictatorship itself.

The association between the dictator and the [[military]] is a common one; many dictators take great pains to emphasize their connections with the military and often wear military uniforms. In some cases, this is perfectly legitimate; [[Francisco Franco]] was a lieutenant general in the Spanish Army before he became [[Head of state|Chief of State]] of Spain; [[Manuel Noriega]] was officially commander of the [[Panama]]nian Defense Forces. In other cases, the association is mere pretense.

== Modern use in formal titles ==

Because of the negative associations, modern leaders very rarely (if ever) use the term in their formal titles. In the 19th century, however, official use was more common:

== Dictators in game theory ==
In [[social choice theory]], the notion of a dictator is formally defined as a person who can achieve any feasible social outcome he/she wishes. The formal definition yields an interesting distinction between two different types of dictators.
* ''The strong dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind (e.g. raise taxes, having someone killed, etc.), a definite way of achieving that goal. This can be seen as having explicit absolute power, like [[Sulla]].
* ''The weak dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind, and for any political scenario, a course of action that would bring about the desired goal. For the ''weak'' dictator, it is usually not enough to "give their orders", rather he/she has to manipulate the political scene appropriately. This means that the ''weak'' dictator might actually be lurking in the shadows, working within a political setup that seems to be non-dictatorial. An example of such a figure is [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo the Magnificent]], who controlled Renaissance [[Florence]].
Note that these definitions disregard some alleged dictators, e.g. [[Benito Mussolini]], who are not interested in the actual achieving of social goals, as much as in [[propaganda]] and controlling public opinion. [[Monarch]]s and [[Military dictatorship|military dictators]] are also excluded from these definitions, because their rule relies on the consent of other political powers (the [[barons]] or the [[army]]).
