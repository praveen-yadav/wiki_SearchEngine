[[File:Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Jahangir receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on his return from the Mewar campaign]]

According to Rajputana Gazetteer, Ajmer was held by Chechi Gurjars until about 700 years ago. Ajmer ([[Sanskrit]] ''Ajayameru'') was founded in the late 7th century A.D. by Ajayraj Singh [[Chauhan]]. Chauhan clan is a branch of [[Chechi]] Gurjars. The Chauhan dynasty ruled Ajmer in spite of repeated invasions by [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Muslim]] armies  from [[Central Asia]] across the north of [[India]]. Ajmer was conquered by [[Muhammad of Ghor]], founder of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], in 1193. However, the Chauhan rulers were allowed autonomy upon the payment of a heavy tribute to the conquerors. Ajmer remained subject to Delhi until 1365 when it was captured by the ruler of [[Mewar]]. In 1509, control of Ajmer was disputed between the [[Maharaja]]s of Mewar and [[Marwar]] unitil it was conquered by the Marwar in 1532. In 1553, the state was captured by the Hindu Emperor [[Hem Chandra Vikramaditya]],  popularly known as [[Hemu]], who was killed in 1556 in the [[Second Battle of Panipat]]. The city was conquered by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Akbar]] in 1559. In the 18th century, control passed to the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]].

In 1818 the British forced the Marathas to cede the city for 50,000 rupees whereupon it became part of the province of Ajmer-Marwar, which consisted of the districts of Ajmer and Merwara and were physically separated by the territory of the Rajputana Agency. Ajmer-Marwar was directly administered by the British Raj, by a commissioner who was subordinate to the Governor-General's agent for Rajputana. Ajmer-Marwar remained a province of India until 1950, when it became the [[Ajmer State]].

Ajmer state became part of Rajasthan state on 1 November 1956.

The [[Dargāh Sharīf]] of Khwāja [[Moinuddin Chishti|Mu'īnuddīn Chishtī]] is situated at the foot of the Tārāgaṛh hill, and consists of several white marble buildings arranged around two courtyards, including a massive gate donated by the [[Nizam|Nizām]] of [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]] and the Akbari Mosque, built by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Shah Jahan|Shāh Jahān]]. It contains the domed tomb of the saint. [[Akbar]] and his queen used to come here by foot on pilgrimage from [[Agra]] every year in observance of a vow when he prayed for a son. The large pillars called "Kose ('Mile') Minar", erected at intervals of two miles (3&nbsp;km) along the entire way between Agra and Ajmer mark the places where the royal pilgrims halted every day. It has been estimated that around 125,000 pilgrims visit the site every day.

[[Taragarh Fort|Tārāgaṛh Fort]], the fort guarding Ajmer, was the seat of the [[Chauhan|Chauhān]] rulers. It is reputed to be one of the oldest hill forts in India and the world. It was built by King Ajāypāl Chauhān on the summit of Tārāgaṛh Hill and overlooks Ajmer. The battlements run along the top of the hill. The walls are two miles (3&nbsp;km) in circumference and the fort can only be approached by way of a very steep slope. When it fell to the [[British Raj]], the fort was dismantled on the orders of [[Lord William Bentinck]] and was converted into a sanatorium for the British troops stationed at the garrison town of [[Nasirabad, India|Nasirabad]].

Adhāī Din Kā Jhonpdā, a [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] [[Hindu]] temple built in 1153 and converted into a mosque by [[Qutubuddin Aibak|Quṭbuddīn Aybak]] in 1193, is situated on the lower slope of Tārāgarh hill. Aikbak's successor, Shams al-Din [[Iltutmish]] added to the mosque. It is noted for its double-depth calligraphy inscriptions, in the [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] and [[Kufic]] scripts. Apart from the mosque, called Jāma' [[Iltutmish]] (pronounced ''Altamish'' locally), nearly the whole of the ancient temple has fallen into ruins, but the relics are still unsurpassed as examples of Hindu architecture and sculpture. Forty columns support the roof, but no two are alike and the ornaments are exceptional in their decorations.<ref>[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=7605 Arhai-din-ka Jhompra Mosque] archnet.org.</ref>
