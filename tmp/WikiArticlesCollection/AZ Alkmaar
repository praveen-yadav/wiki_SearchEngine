'''Alkmaar Zaanstreek''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɑlkmaːr ˈzaːnstreːk|}}), better known as '''AZ Alkmaar''' or simply '''AZ''' ({{IPA-nl|aːˈzɛt}}), is an [[Association football|football]] club from [[Alkmaar]] and the [[Zaanstreek]], Netherlands. The club plays in the [[Eredivisie]], the highest football league in the Netherlands. AZ was founded in 1967 as ''AZ '67''.

==History==
AZ was founded on 10 May 1967 as '''AZ '67''', the result of a merger of '''Alkmaar '54''' and '''FC Zaanstreek'''. FC Zaanstreek was formed in 1964, continuing the professional adventure of the [[Koog aan de Zaan|Kooger]] Football Club ('''[[:nl:KFC (voetbalclub)|KFC]]'''). KFC had been founded in 1910, had nearly become National Champion in 1934 through a narrow loss to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in the finals, and had been professional since 1955.

In 1964, the brothers Cees and Klaas Molenaar, former players for KFC and owners of a growing appliance store chain, sought to create a powerful football team in the Zaanstreek by merging the two local professional teams (KFC and [[:nl:ZFC|ZFC]]). After this merger failed, they successfully merged KFC (now "FC Zaanstreek") with Alkmaar '54, though the team would be located in Alkmaar. Partially through the hiring of expensive foreign players, the new club soon acquired large debts. Fortunately in 1972 the brothers Molenaar bailed it out and invested heavily in the club, to the point that AZ '67 were successful in the late seventies and early eighties, playing European football in five of the six seasons from 1977 to 1982 and winning the [[Dutch Cup]] three times over that period.

After four near-misses, AZ finally became [[Eredivisie|Dutch champions]] in 1981. They were the only team other than the "big three" (Ajax, [[Feyenoord]], and [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]]) to do so in a period stretching from 1965 to 2009, when AZ repeated as champions. They won the [[1980–81 Eredivisie|1980–81 season]] with overwhelming power, winning 27 of 34 matches while losing only one, and scoring 101 goals while allowing only 30. The same season they reached the [[1981 UEFA Cup Final|final of the UEFA Cup]], losing 4:5 on aggregate to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. The next year in the [[1981–82 European Cup|UEFA Champions League]] they lost in the second round 2:3 on aggregate to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. [[Georg Keßler]] was AZ's manager over most of these years (1978–1982), while star players included [[Kees Kist]], [[Jan Peters (footballer)|Jan Peters]], [[Hugo Hovenkamp]], [[John Metgod]] and [[Kristen Nygaard (footballer)|Kristen Nygaard]].

Things went downhill after Klaas Molenaar left the club in 1985 (Cees had died in 1979). In 1988, AZ were even relegated from the [[Eredivisie]].

The involvement of businessman Dirk Scheringa in the mid-'90s marked the revival of the club. AZ returned to the [[Eredivisie]] in 1998. In 2004–05, they reappeared in the [[UEFA Cup]] tournament, advancing to the semi-finals. The second leg of these semis against [[Sporting CP]] had a heart-breaking ending, when Sporting scored in the 122nd minute (2 minutes into stoppage time) to reach an aggregate tie of 4:4, but to win on [[away goals]]. AZ also finished third in the Eredivisie that season, again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, after spending most of the season in the top two spots. These were remarkable achievements for a small club like AZ, which does not have a similar fanbase as their Eredivisie and European rivals: AZ's home ground until the 2006-07 season, the [[Alkmaarderhout]], had a spectator capacity of 8,390.

In the summer of 2006, the club moved to a new 17,000 capacity stadium [[AZ Stadion]].Club's chairman Dirk Scheringa stated in 2007 that he wished to expand the stadium capacity to 40,000 by 2010.Ultimately, the club began plans to expand the stadium to at least 30,000 seats by 2011–12.

AZ had a very good 2006–07 season, which ended, however, in disaster. Going into the last game of the 2006–07 season, AZ led [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and Ajax by goal-differential for the [[Eredivisie]] championship, but ended up third after losing this last match against bottom-dweller [[Excelsior Rotterdam|Excelsior]], playing with 10 men for 80 minutes. Further setbacks followed when AZ lost the [[KNVB Cup]] finals to Ajax, 8–7 in penalty kicks after a drawn game, and also lost to Ajax over two playoff games for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. After the season, key players like [[Tim de Cler]], [[Danny Koevermans]], and [[Shota Arveladze]] left the team.

[[File:AZ Larisa UEFA Cup0708.jpg|thumb|right|220px|AZ versus [[Larissa F.C.|Larissa]] in a [[2007–08 UEFA Cup]] match.]]
A remarkable run ended in the 2007-08 season: AZ had been undefeated in their first 32 home matches in European competitions, a sequence which ran from 1977 until 20 December 2007, when they finally lost to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] of [[Premier League|England]] by a score of 3–2. In this season, AZ performed so badly (first round loss in the KNVB Cup, elimination from the UEFA Cup before winter break and a final 11th position in the Eredivisie), that team manager [[Louis van Gaal]] felt obliged to hand in his resignation in March 2008. However, after protests from the players and direction, van Gaal withdrew his resignation to finish his contractual obligations.

The 2008–09 season had an unpromising start with two defeats against [[NAC Breda]] and [[ADO Den Haag]]. However, starting with a 1–0 victory over defending league champions PSV, the team didn't lose in the next 28 matches, including a stretch of 11 matches in which the opposing teams did not score a single goal. Three weeks before the end of the season, despite their second home defeat of the season (against [[Vitesse]]), AZ became [[Eredivisie]] champions when nearest rivals [[FC Twente|Twente]] and Ajax both lost their matches.AZ qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the second time, but only took four points from six matches and finished bottom of their group.

[[Ronald Koeman]], succeeded [[Louis van Gaal]] after the 2008–09 season. Van Gaal had already left for [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] after becoming league champions with AZ. Koeman became the manager for AZ on 17 May 2009.On 5 December 2009 AZ announced that Koeman no longer was in charge of AZ, after losing 7 of the first 16 games in the Dutch competition.Former [[Zenit St. Petersburg]] manager [[Dick Advocaat]] took over for the rest of the season. Under his lead, some good results were achieved and European football was secured. For the 2010–2011 season, [[Gertjan Verbeek]], coming from [[Heracles Almelo]], will be the new manager.

==Stadium and sponsor==
{{See also|AFAS Stadion}}

[[File:DSB-Stadion.jpg|250px|right|thumb|AFAS Stadion, AZ's home venue in Alkmaar]]

AZ play their home games at the [[AFAS Stadion]], located in the southern part of the city of [[Alkmaar]]. The stadium, which is owned directly by the club, was inaugurated in 2006 and replaced the old [[Alkmaarderhout]] venue as the [[DSB Bank|DSB Stadion]]. The stadium currently has a capacity of ''17,023''. During its design stages the name Victorie Stadion was frequently used, referring to the [[Eighty Years' War|Dutch War of Independence]], the phrase ''"n Alkmaar begint de victorie" (Victory begins in Alkmaar)'' in particular. Until now, this name hasn't been officially in use, the board instead opting for sponsorship deals because of financial motives. However, to this day the name maintains a good share of support among the fans.

In order to further grow the club's budget, the ''AZ board'' of directors has decided to extend the capacity of the new stadium to a minimum of ''30,000'' seated spectators somewhere in the near future. The extension will be realised to construct a second tier to three of the four stands. The main stand with all technical areas, ''VIP'' and sponsor and media facilities will remain in place.

In October 2009 sponsor [[DSB Bank]] was declared bankrupt.
The stadium name temporarily changed from DSB Stadion to AZ Stadion, as it was considered undesirable that the stadium was linked with a non-existent bank. In February 2010 a new main sponsor was found: construction works service provider BUKO from [[Beverwijk]].

A year later, in the season [[2010–11 Eredivisie|2010–11]], ''[[AFAS Erp Software]]'' took over as official shirt sponsor, also taking over duties as stadium sponsor. The current external name of the ground is [[AFAS Stadion]].

==Trivia==
As of 2012, AZ is the only club to have beaten [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[Feyenoord]] and [[PSV (football club)|PSV]] away from home in a [[1980–81 Eredivisie|single Eredivisie season]]. [[sc Heerenveen]] managed to do the same in 2008–09, though their away victory at Feyenoord was a [[KNVB Cup]] match (Heerenveen had drawn 2–2 at [[De Kuip]] in the [[2008–09 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] match).
