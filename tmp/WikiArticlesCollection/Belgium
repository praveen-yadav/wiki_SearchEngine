Historically, Belgium, the [[Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]] were known as the [[Low Countries]], which used to cover a somewhat larger area than the current [[Benelux]] group of states. The region was called Belgica in Latin because of the [[Roman province]] [[Gallia Belgica]] which covered more or less the same area. From the end of the [[Middle Ages]] until the 17th century, it was a prosperous centre of commerce and culture. From the 16th century until the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830, when Belgium seceded from the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], many battles between European powers were fought in the area of Belgium, causing it to be dubbed the "Battlefield of Europe,"<ref

The second half of the 20th century was marked by the rise of contrasts between the Flemish and the Francophones <!--a quarter of the Francophones are living in Brussels and are not nessarily Walloons but are nevertheless in conflict with the Flemings, so please don't change Francophone into Walloons--> fuelled by [[culture of Belgium|differences of language]] and the [[economy of Belgium|unequal economic development]] of Flanders and Wallonia. This continuing antagonism has caused [[state reform in Belgium|far-reaching reforms]], changing the formerly unitary Belgian state into a federal state, and several governmental crises, the [[2007–2011 Belgian political crisis|most recent]], from 2007 to 2011, being the longest.

The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into the northern [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] (''Belgica Foederata'' in [[Latin]], the "Federated Netherlands") and the [[Southern Netherlands]] (''Belgica Regia'', the "Royal Netherlands"). The latter were ruled successively by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and the [[History of Austria#Charles VI and Maria Theresa (1711–1780)|Austrian]] [[Habsburg]]s and comprised most of modern Belgium. This was the theatre of most [[Franco-Spanish War (1635)|Franco-Spanish]] and [[War of the Austrian Succession|Franco-Austrian wars]]<!--disambiguation page intended: "most" wars of that list--> during the 17th and 18th centuries.

Following the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1794|campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars]], the Low Countries—including territories that were never nominally under Habsburg rule, such as the Prince-Bishopric of Liège—were annexed by the [[French First Republic]], ending Austrian rule in the region. The reunification of the Low Countries as the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] occurred at the dissolution of the [[First French Empire]] in 1815, after the defeat of Napoleon.

In 1830, the [[Belgian Revolution]] led to the separation of the Southern Provinces from the Netherlands and to the establishment of a Catholic and bourgeois, officially French-speaking and neutral, independent Belgium under a [[Provisional Government of Belgium|provisional government]] and a [[national Congress of Belgium|national congress]].<ref

The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885 ceded control of the [[Congo Free State]] to [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold&nbsp;II]] as his private possession. From around 1900 there was growing international concern for the extreme and savage treatment of the Congolese population under Leopold&nbsp;II, for whom the Congo was primarily a source of revenue from ivory and rubber production. In 1908 this outcry led the Belgian state to assume responsibility for the government of the colony, henceforth called the [[Belgian Congo]].<ref>

Germany invaded Belgium in 1914 as part of the [[Schlieffen Plan]] to attack France and much of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] fighting of World War&nbsp;I occurred in western parts of the country. The opening months of the war were known as the [[Rape of Belgium]] due to German excesses. Belgium took over the [[German colonies]] of [[Ruanda-Urundi]] (modern day [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]) during the war, and they were mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the [[League of Nations]]. In the aftermath of the First World War, the [[districts of Prussia|Prussian districts]] of [[Eupen-Malmedy|Eupen and Malmedy]] were annexed by Belgium in 1925, thereby causing the presence of a German-speaking minority.

[[Battle of Belgium|The country was again invaded by Germany in 1940]] and was occupied until its [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|liberation by the Allies]] in 1944.

Ruanda-Urundi followed with its independence two years later. Belgium joined [[NATO]] as a founding member and formed the Benelux group of nations with the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Belgium became one of the six founding members of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] in 1951 and of the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] and [[European Economic Community]], established in 1957. The latter is now the European Union, for which Belgium hosts major administrations and institutions, including the [[European Commission]], the [[Council of the European Union]] and the extraordinary and committee sessions of the [[European Parliament]].

Belgium is a [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional]], [[popular monarchy]] and a [[federalism|federal]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]. The [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Belgian Federal Parliament|federal parliament]] is composed of a [[Senate (Belgium)|Senate]] and a [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber of Representatives]]. The former is made up of 40 directly elected politicians and 21 representatives appointed by the [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|3 Community parliaments]], 10 [[Belgian Senate#Co-opted Senators|co-opted senators]] and the children of the king, as [[Belgian Senate#Senators by right|Senators by Right]] who in practice do not cast their vote. The [[Chambers of parliament|Chamber]]'s 150 representatives are elected under a [[proportional voting]] system from 11 [[Arrondissements of Belgium|electoral districts]]. Belgium has [[compulsory voting]] and thus holds one of the highest rates of [[voter turnout]] in the world.<ref

This single Flemish body thus exercises powers about Community matters in the bilingual area of Brussels-Capital and in the Dutch language area, while about Regional matters only in Flanders.</ref>

The overlapping boundaries of the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities: the territory of the Brussels-Capital Region (which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions) is included in both the Flemish and French Communities, and the territory of the German-speaking Community lies wholly within the Walloon Region. Conflicts about jurisdiction between the bodies are resolved by the [[Constitutional Court of Belgium]]. The structure is intended as a compromise to allow different cultures to live together peacefully.<ref name="Fitzmaurice"/>

===Locus of policy jurisdiction===

The Federal State's authority includes justice, defence, federal police, social security, nuclear energy, monetary policy and public debt, and other aspects of public finances. State-owned companies include the [[Belgian Post Group]] and [[National Railway Company of Belgium|Belgian Railways]]. The Federal Government is responsible for the obligations of Belgium and its federalized institutions towards the European Union and NATO. It controls substantial parts of public health, home affairs and foreign affairs.<ref name=fedgov1>{{cite web|title=The Federal Government's Powers|work=.be Portal|publisher=Belgian Federal Government|url=http://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federal_authorities/competence_federal_government/|accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref> The budget—without the debt—controlled by the federal government amounts to about 50% of the national fiscal income. The federal government employs around 12% of the civil servants.<ref>{{cite book|quote=In 2002, 58.92% of the fiscal income was going to the budget of the federal government, but more than one-third was used to pay the interests of the public debt.

There are 87.8% of the civil servants who are working for the Regions or the Communities and 12.2% for the Federal State.|author=Lagasse, Charles-Etienne |title=Les nouvelles institutions politiques de la Belgique et de l'Europe|publisher=Erasme|location=Namur|year=2003|isbn=2-87127-783-4|page=289}}</ref>

Communities exercise their authority only within linguistically determined geographical boundaries, originally oriented towards the individuals of a Community's language: culture (including audiovisual media), education and the use of the relevant language. Extensions to personal matters less directly connected with language comprise health policy (curative and preventive medicine) and assistance to individuals (protection of youth, social welfare, aid to families, immigrant assistance services, and so on.).<ref name=fedgov2>{{cite web|title=The Communities|work=.be Portal|publisher=Belgian Federal Government|url=http://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/communities/|accessdate=26 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615153816/http://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/communities/| archivedate= 15 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

Regions have authority in fields that can be broadly associated with their territory. These include economy, employment, agriculture, water policy, housing, public works, energy, transport, the environment, town and country planning, nature conservation, credit and foreign trade. They supervise the provinces, municipalities and intercommunal utility companies.<ref name=fedgov3>{{cite web|title=The Regions|work=.be Portal|publisher=Belgian Federal Government|url=http://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/regions/|accessdate=26 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615153938/http://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/regions/| archivedate= 15 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

In several fields, the different levels each have their own say on specifics. With education, for instance, the autonomy of the Communities neither includes decisions about the compulsory aspect nor allows for setting minimum requirements for awarding qualifications, which remain federal matters.<ref name=fedgov1/> Each level of government can be involved in scientific research and international relations associated with its powers. The treaty-making power of the Regions' and Communities' Governments is the broadest of all the Federating units of all the Federations all over the world.<ref name=Lagasse1>{{cite web |url = http://www.kazanfed.ru/en/actions/konfer8/6/ |title = Federalism in Russia, Canada and Belgium: experience of comparative research |language = French |quote = La Belgique constitue ainsi le seul exemple clair du transfert d'une partie de la compétence « affaires étrangères » à des entités fédérées.

Belgium has three main geographical regions: the coastal plain in the north-west and the central plateau both belong to the Anglo-Belgian Basin; the [[Ardennes]] uplands in the south-east are part of the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian orogenic belt]].

The coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and [[polder]]s. Further inland lies a smooth, slowly rising landscape irrigated by numerous waterways, with fertile valleys and the northeastern sandy plain of the [[Campine]] (''Kempen''). The thickly forested hills and plateaux of the Ardennes are more rugged and rocky with caves and small [[canyon|gorges]].

Belgium switched to the euro in 2002, with the first sets of euro coins being minted in 1999. The standard [[Belgian euro coins]] designated for circulation show the portrait of King Albert&nbsp;II.

Despite a 18% decrease observed from 1970 to 1999, Belgium still had in 1999 the highest [[Rail transport in Belgium|rail network]] density within the European Union with 113.8&nbsp;km/1 000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. On the other hand, the same period of time, 1970–1999, has seen a huge growth (+56%) of the [[List of motorways in Belgium|motorway network]]. In 1999, the density of km motorways per 1000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and 1000 inhabitants amounted to 55.1 and 16.5 respectively and were significantly superior to the EU's means of 13.7 and 15.9.<ref name=panorama>{{cite book| title=Panorama of Transport |publisher=Office for Official Publications of the European Communities | year=2003 | isbn=92-894-4845-8 |url=http://www.uni-mannheim.de/edz/pdf/eurostat/02/KS-DA-02-001-EN-N-EN.pdf | format=PDF }}</ref>

The Belgian Armed Forces have about 47,000 active troops. In 2010, Belgium's defence budget totaled €3.95 billion (representing 1.12% of its GDP).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eda.europa.eu/DefenceData/Belgium?DDYear=2010 |title=Defence Data of Belgium in 2010 |publisher=[[European Defence Agency]] |accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref> They are organised into one unified structure which consists of four main components: [[Belgian Land Component|Land Component]], or the Army; [[Belgian Air Component|Air Component]], or the Air Force; [[Belgian Naval Component|Naval Component]], or the Navy; [[Belgian Medical Component|Medical Component]].

The effects of World War II made [[collective security]] a priority for [[Foreign relations of Belgium|Belgian foreign policy]]. In March 1948 Belgium signed the [[Treaty of Brussels]], and then joined [[NATO]] in 1948. However the integration of the armed forces into NATO did not begin until after the [[Korean War]].<ref>David Isby and Charles Kamps Jr, 'Armies of NATO's Central Front,' Jane's Publishing Company, 1985, p.59</ref> The Belgians, along with the Luxembourg government, sent a detachment of battalion strength to fight in Korea known as the [[Belgian United Nations Command]]. This mission was the first in a long line of UN missions which the Belgians supported.

Mirroring the dual structure of the 19th-century Belgian political landscape, characterized by the [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal]] and the [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic parties]], the educational system is segregated within a secular and a religious segment. The secular branch of schooling is controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, while religious, mainly [[Catholic school|Catholic branch]] education, is organised by religious authorities, although subsidized and supervised by the communities.<ref

{{Main|Religion in Belgium}}

[[File:BasKoek.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Brussels|National Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] in [[Koekelberg]], Brussels.]]
Since the country's independence, [[Roman Catholicism]], counterbalanced by strong [[freethought]] movements, has had an important role in Belgium's politics.<ref>See for example [[s:en:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Belgium|Belgium]] entry of the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]</ref> However Belgium is largely a secular country as the ''[[laicite|laicist]]'' [[Constitution of Belgium|constitution]] provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice. During the reigns of [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert&nbsp;I]] and [[Baudouin I of Belgium|Baudouin]], the monarchy had a reputation of deeply rooted Catholicism.<ref name=MarshallCavendish2009>{{cite book|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2009|author=Loopbuyck, P. and Torfs, R. |volume=4|title=The world and its people – Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands|isbn=0-7614-7890-6|page=499}}</ref>

Roman Catholicism has traditionally been Belgium's majority religion; being especially strong in Flanders. However, by 2009 Sunday church attendance was 5% for Belgium in total; 3% in Brussels,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselnieuws.be/artikel/met-uitsterven-bedreigd-de-brusselse-kerkganger |language=Dutch|title=Churchgoers in Brussels threatened with extinction |publisher=Brusselnieuws.be |date=30 November 2010 |accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> and 5.4% in Flanders. Church attendance in 2009 in Belgium was roughly half of the Sunday church attendance in 1998 (11% for the total of Belgium in 1998).<ref>[http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=3932PEIJ Kerken lopen zeer geleidelijk helemaal leeg – Dutch news article describing church attendance in Flanders]. Standaard.be (25 November 2010). Retrieved on 26 September 2011.</ref> Despite the drop in church attendance, Catholic identity nevertheless remains an important part of Belgium's culture.<ref name=MarshallCavendish2009/>

Symbolically and materially, the Roman Catholic Church remains in a favourable position.<ref name=MarshallCavendish2009/> Belgium has three officially recognized religions: Christianity (Catholic, Protestantism, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]] and Anglicanism), Islam and Judaism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717143131/http://www.euresisnet.eu/Pages/ReligionAndState/BELGIUM.aspx | title=State and Church in BELGIUM |work=euresisnet.eu|date=31 October 2007 }}</ref>

In the early 2000s there were approximately 42,000 Jews in Belgium. The [[Jewish Community of Antwerp]] (numbering some 18,000) is one of the largest in Europe, and one of the last places in the world where [[Yiddish]] is the primary language of a large Jewish community (mirroring certain Orthodox and Hassidic communities in New York and Israel). In addition most Jewish children in Antwerp receive a Jewish education.<ref>Ghiuzeli, Haim F. [http://www.bh.org.il/database-article.aspx?48207 The Jewish Community of Antwerp, Belgium]. Beit Hatfutsot, the Museum of the Jewish People</ref> There are several Jewish newspapers and more than 45 active synagogues (30 of which are in Antwerp) in the country.

A 2006 inquiry in Flanders, considered to be a more religious region than Wallonia, showed that 55% considered themselves religious and that 36% believed that God created the universe.<ref>Inquiry by 'Vepec', 'Vereniging voor Promotie en Communicatie' (Organisation for Promotion and Communication), published in Knack magazine {{Nowrap|22 November}} 2006 p. 14 [The Dutch language term 'gelovig' is in the text translated as 'religious'. More precisely it is a very common word for believing in particular in any kind of God in a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] sense, or in some [[afterlife]]], or both.</ref> On the other hand, Wallonia has become one of Europe's most secular/least religious regions. Most of the French-speaking region's population does not consider religion an important part of their lives, and as much as 45% of the population identifies as irreligious. This is particularly the case in eastern Wallonia and areas along the French border.

The Turks are the third largest group, and the second largest Muslim ethnic group, numbering 220,000.<ref name="npdata.be"/><ref name="hbvl.be"/>

According to the [[Eurobarometer|Eurobarometer Poll]] in 2010, 37% of Belgian citizens responded that "they believe there is a God", whereas 31% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 27% that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf|title=Special Eurobarometer, biotechnology, page 204|date=Fieldwork: Jan–Feb 2010|format=PDF}}</ref>

===Health===
{{main|Healthcare in Belgium}}
The Belgians are known to enjoy good health. According to 2012 estimates, the average life expectancy is 79.65 years.<ref name=CIA/> Since 1960, life expectancy has, in line with the European average, grown by two months per year. Death in Belgium is mainly due to heart and vascular disorders, [[neoplasm]]s, disorders of the respiratory system and unnatural causes of death (accidents, suicide). Non-natural causes of death and cancer are the most common causes of death for females up to age 24 and males up to age 44.<ref name=Corens2007>{{cite journal |journal=Health Systems in Transition |volume=9 |year=2007 |title=Belgium, health system review |author=Corens, Dirk |publisher=European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/96442/E90059.pdf |issue=2}}</ref>

[[Healthcare in Belgium]] is financed through both social security contributions and taxation. Health insurance is compulsory. Health care is delivered by a mostly private system of independent medical practitioners and hospitals. Most of the time each provided service is directly paid by the patient and reimbursed later on by health insurance companies.<ref name=Corens2007/> Belgian health care system is supervised and financed by the federal government, the three Communities and the three Regions, i.e. six distinct Ministries (the Flemish Community and Region have merged).<ref name=Corens2007/>

Despite its [[partition of Belgium|political and linguistic divisions]], the region corresponding to today's Belgium has seen the flourishing of major artistic movements that have had tremendous influence on European art and culture. Nowadays, to a certain extent, cultural life is concentrated within each language Community, and a variety of barriers have made a shared cultural sphere less pronounced.<ref name="Fitzmaurice"/><ref>{{cite web
