An '''airline''' is a company that provides [[civil aviation|air transport services]] for [[travel]]ing [[passenger]]s and [[freight]]. Airlines [[leasing|lease]] or own their [[aircraft]] with which to supply these services and may form [[partnership]]s or [[Airline alliance|alliances]] with other airlines for mutual benefit. Generally, airline companies are recognized with an [[Air operator's certificate|air operating certificate]] or license issued by a governmental aviation body.

Airlines vary from those with a single aircraft carrying [[mail]] or [[cargo]], through full-service international airlines operating hundreds of aircraft. Airline services can be categorized as being intercontinental, intra-continental, domestic, regional, or international, and may be operated as scheduled services or charters.

==History==

===The first airlines===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00959, Berlin, Graf Zeppelin LZ 127.jpg|thumb|[[Luftschiffbau Zeppelin|LZ]] ''Graf Zeppelin'' over [[Berlin]] for [[DELAG]], the world's first airline (est. in 1909)]]

American aviation pioneers, such as [[Rufus Porter]] and [[Frederick Marriott]], attempted to start airlines using [[airship]]s in the mid-19th century, focusing on the New York–California route. Those attempts floundered due to such mishaps as the airships catching fire and the aircraft being ripped apart by spectators.

[[DELAG]], ''Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-Aktiengesellschaft'' was the [[List of airlines by foundation|world's first airline]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airships.net/delag-passenger-zeppelins |title=DELAG: The World's First Airline |publisher=Airships.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> It was founded on November 16, 1909 with government assistance, and operated airships manufactured by The [[Zeppelin|Zeppelin Corporation]]. Its headquarters were in [[Frankfurt]].  The four [[List of airlines by foundation|oldest non-dirigible airlines]] that still exist are Netherlands' [[KLM]],  Colombia's [[Avianca]], Australia's [[Qantas]], and the Czech Republic's [[Czech Airlines]]. KLM first flew in May 1920, while Qantas (which stands for ''Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Limited'') was founded in Queensland, Australia, in late 1920.

===European airline industry===
[[File:National Audit Office - Victoria - London - 020504.jpg|thumb|The Imperial Airways Empire Terminal, Victoria, London. Trains ran from here to [[flying boats]] in [[Southampton]], and to [[Croydon Airport]].]]

The earliest fixed wing airline was the [[Aircraft Transport and Travel]], formed by [[George Holt Thomas]] in 1916. Using a fleet of former military [[Airco DH.4]]A biplanes that had been modified to carry two passengers in the [[fuselage]], it operated relief flights between [[Folkestone]] and [[Ghent]]. On 15 July 1919, the company flew a proving flight across the [[English Channel]], despite a lack of support from the [[United Kingdom|British]] government. Flown by Lt. H Shaw in an [[Airco DH.9]] between [[RAF Hendon]] and [[Paris - Le Bourget Airport]], the flight took 2 hours and 30 minutes at £21 per passenger.

On 25 August 1919, the company used [[Airco DH.16|DH.16s]] to pioneer a regular service from [[Hounslow Heath Aerodrome]] to Le Bourget, the first regular international service in the world. The airline soon gained a reputation for reliability, despite problems with bad weather and began to attract European competition. In November 1919, it won the first British civil [[airmail]] contract. Six [[Royal Air Force]] [[Airco DH.9A]] aircraft were lent to the company, to operate the airmail service between [[Hawkinge]] and [[Cologne]]. In 1920, they were returned to the Royal Air Force.<ref>''The Putnam Aeronautical Review'' edited by John Motum, p170 Volume one 1990 Naval Institute Press</ref> 

Other British competitors were quick to follow - [[Handley Page Transport]] was established in 1919 and used the company's converted [[World War One|wartime]] [[Handley Page Type O|Type O/400]] [[bomber]]s with a capacity for 19 passengers, to run a [[London]]-[[Paris]] passenger service. 

The first French airlines were also established and began to offer competition for the same route. The [[Société Générale des Transports Aériens]] was created in late 1919, by the [[Farman]] brothers and the [[Farman F.60 Goliath]] plane flew scheduled services from [[Toussus-le-Noble]] to [[Kenley]], near [[Croydon]]. Another early French airline was the [[Compagnie des Messageries Aériennes]], established in 1919 by [[Louis-Charles Breguet]], offering a mail and freight service between [[Paris - Le Bourget Airport|Le Bourget Airport]], [[Paris]] and [[Lesquin Airport]], [[Lille]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/milestones-of-flight/world/1919.cfm |title=World Aviation in 1919 - Part 1 |publisher=Royal Air Force Museum |accessdate=28 February 2011}}</ref> 

[[File:Klm-poster-1919.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1919 advertisement]]
The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] airline [[KLM]] made its first flight in 1920, and is the oldest continuously operating airline in the world. Established by aviator [[Albert Plesman]], <ref>{{cite journal|journal=International Directory of Company Histories|year=1999|volume=28|title=Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij, N.V. History| url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/koninklijke-luchtvaart-maatschappij-n-v-history/|accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> it was immediately awarded a "Royal" predicate from [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]]<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.klm.com/corporate/en/about-klm/history/index.html|work=KLM Corporate|publisher=KLM|accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> It's first flight was from [[Croydon Airport]], [[London]] to [[Amsterdam]], using a leased [[Aircraft Transport and Travel]] [[Airco DH.16|DH-16]], and carrying two British journalists and a number of newspapers. In 1921 KLM started scheduled services.

Early European airlines tended to favour comfort - the passenger cabins were often spacious with luxury interiors - over speed and efficiency. The relatively basic navigational capabilities of pilots at the time also meant that delays due to the weather, especially during the winter in the south of [[England]], were commonplace.

By the early 1920s, small airlines were struggling to compete, and there was a movement towards increased rationalization and consolidation. In 1924, [[Imperial Airways]] was formed from the merger of [[Instone Air Line|Instone Air Line Company]], [[British Marine Air Navigation Co Ltd|British Marine Air Navigation]], [[Daimler Airway]] and [[Handley Page Transport|Handley Page Transport Co Ltd.]], to allow British airlines to compete with stiff competition from French and German airlines that were enjoying heavy government subsidies. The airline was a pioneer in surveying and opening up air routes across the world to service far-flung parts of the [[British Empire]] and to enhance trade and integration.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1923/1923%20-%200760.html "Appointment of Government Directors"] ''Flight'' 1923</ref>
[[File:Tanken van een vliegtuig Airplane provided with fuel.jpg|thumb|Handley Page W.8b inherited from [[Handley Page Transport]] when Imperial Airways was formed.]]

The first new airliner ordered by Imperial Airways, was the [[Handley Page W8f]] ''City of Washington'', delivered on 3 November 1924.<ref>http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/coming%20of%20age/imperial%20airways.htm</ref> In the first year of operation the company carried 11,395 passengers and 212,380 letters. In April 1925, the film ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' became the first film to be screened for passengers on a scheduled airliner flight when it was shown on the London-Paris route.

[[File:Imperial routes April 1935.jpg|thumb|325px|April 1935 map showing Imperial Airways'<br>routes to Australia and South Africa]]
In 1926, [[Alan Cobham]] surveyed a flight route from the UK to [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], following this up with another proving flight to [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. Other routes to [[British India]] and the [[Far East]] were also charted and demonstrated at this time. Regular services to [[Cairo]] and [[Basra]] began in 1927 and was extended to [[Karachi]] in 1929. The London-[[Australia]] service was inaugurated in 1932 with the [[Handley Page HP 42]] airliners. Further services were opened up to [[Calcutta]], [[Rangoon]], [[Singapore]], [[Brisbane]] and [[Hong Kong]] passengers departed London on 14 March 1936 following the establishment of a branch from Penang to Hong Kong.

Imperial's aircraft were small, most seating fewer than twenty passengers, and catered for the rich - only about 50,000 passengers used Imperial Airways in the 1930s. Most passengers on intercontinental routes or on services within and between British colonies were men doing colonial administration, business or research.<ref>Pirie, G.H. Incidental tourism: British imperial air travel in the 1930s. ''Journal of Tourism History'', 1 (2009) 49-66.</ref>

Two French airlines also merged to form [[Air Union]] on 1 January 1923. This later merged with four other French airlines to become [[Air France]], the country's flagship carrier to this day, on 7 October 1933.

Like Imperial Airways, [[Air France]] and [[KLM]]'s early growth depended heavily on the needs to service links with far-flung colonial possessions ([[French North Africa|North Africa]] and [[French Indochina|Indochina]] for the French and the [[Dutch Indies|East Indies]] for the Dutch). France began an air mail service to [[Morocco]] in 1919 that was bought out in 1927, renamed [[Aéropostale (aviation)|Aéropostale]], and injected with capital to become a major international carrier. In 1933, Aéropostale went [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]], was nationalized and merged into [[Air France]].

In Finland, the charter establishing Aero O/Y (now [[Finnair]]) was signed in the city of [[Helsinki]] on September 12, 1923. [[Junkers F.13]] D-335 became the first aircraft of the company, when Aero took delivery of it on March 14, 1924. The first flight was between Helsinki and [[Tallinn]], capital of [[Estonia]], and it took place on March 20, 1924, one week later.

Germany's [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]] was created in 1926 by merger of two airlines, one of them [[Junkers Luftverkehr]]. Luft Hansa, due to the [[Hugo Junkers|Junkers]] heritage and unlike most other airlines at the time, became a major investor in airlines outside of Europe, providing capital to [[Varig]] and Avianca. German airliners built by [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]], [[Dornier GmbH|Dornier]], and [[Fokker]] were among the most advanced in the world at the time.  In 1931, the airship [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]] began offering regular scheduled passenger service between Germany and South America, usually every two weeks, which continued until 1937.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airships.net/lz127-graf-zeppelin/history |title=LZ-127 Graf Zeppelin |publisher=Airships.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>  In 1936, the airship [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] entered passenger service and successfully crossed the Atlantic 36 times before crashing at Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airships.net/hindenburg |title=Hindenburg |publisher=Airships.net |date=2009-06-10 |accessdate=2010-08-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101005073820/http://www.airships.net/hindenburg| archivedate= 5 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In the [[Soviet Union]] the Chief Administration of the Civil Air Fleet was established in 1921. One of its first acts was to help found Deutsch-Russische Luftverkehrs A.G. (Deruluft), a German-Russian joint venture to provide air transport from Russia to the West. Domestic air service began around the same time, when Dobrolyot started operations on 15 July 1923 between Moscow and Nizhni Novgorod. Since 1932 all operations had been carried under the name Aeroflot. By the end of the 1930s Aeroflot had become the world's largest airline, employing more than 4,000 pilots and 60,000 other service personnel and operating around 3,000 aircraft (of which 75% were considered obsolete by its own standards). During the Soviet era Aeroflot was synonymous with Russian civil aviation, as it was the only air carrier. It became the first airline in the world to operate sustained regular jet services on 15 September 1956 with the [[Tupolev Tu-104]].

====EU Airline Deregulation====
Deregulation of the [[European Union]] airspace in the early 1990s has had substantial effect on structure of the industry there. The shift towards 'budget' airlines on shorter routes has been significant. Airlines such as [[EasyJet]] and [[Ryanair]] have often grown at the expense of the traditional national airlines.

There has also been a trend for these national airlines themselves to be privatized such as has occurred for [[Aer Lingus]] and [[British Airways]]. Other national airlines, including Italy's [[Alitalia]], have suffered - particularly with the rapid increase of oil prices in early 2008.

===U.S. airline industry===

====Early development====
[[File:TWA 1940.jpg|thumb|[[TWA]] [[Douglas DC-3]] in 1940. The DC-3, often regarded as one of the most influential aircraft in the history of commercial aviation, revolutionized the aviation industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dc3history.org/douglasdc3.html |title=The DC-3 Genesis of The Legend |publisher=Dc3history.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100927084841/http://dc3history.org/douglasdc3.html| archivedate= 27 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>]]

[[Tony Jannus]] conducted the United States' first scheduled commercial airline flight on 1 January 1914 for the [[St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line]].<ref name=Society>{{cite web | title=Tony Jannus, an enduring legacy of aviation | work=Tony Jannus Distinguished Aviation Society | publisher=tonyjannusaward.com | url=http://www.tonyjannusaward.com/history/ |date= |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref> The 23-minute flight traveled between [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] and [[Tampa, Florida]], passing some {{convert|50|ft|m}} above Tampa Bay in Jannus' [[Benoist XIV]] biplane flying boat. [[Chalk's International Airlines]] began service between Miami and Bimini in the [[Bahamas]] in February 1919. Based in [[Ft. Lauderdale]], Chalk's claimed to be the oldest continuously operating airline in the United States until its closure in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airportbusiness.com/web/online/Top-News-Headlines/CHALKS-AIRLINES-LOSES-FLIGHT-LICENSE-ITS-AIRPORT-LEASE-COULD-BE-CANCELED/1$15115 |title=Chalks Airlines Loses Flight License | publisher=airportbusiness.com|date= |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref>

Following [[World War I]], the United States found itself swamped with aviators. Many decided to take their war-surplus aircraft on barnstorming campaigns, performing aerobatic maneuvers to woo crowds. In 1918, the [[United States Postal Service]] won the financial backing of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to begin experimenting with [[air mail]] service, initially using [[Curtiss Jenny]]<ref>Amick, George. "How The Airmail Got Off The Ground." American History 33.3 (1998): 48. Academic Search Premier. Web. 3 Nov. 2011.</ref> aircraft that had been procured by the [[United States Army Air Service]]. Private operators were the first to fly the mail but due to numerous accidents the US Army was tasked with mail delivery.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} During the course of the Army's involvement they proved to be too unreliable and lost their air mail duties.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} By the mid-1920s, the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] had developed its own air mail network, based on a transcontinental backbone between [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} To supplant this service, they offered twelve contracts for spur routes to independent bidders. Some of the carriers that won these routes would, through time and mergers, evolve into [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Braniff Airways]], [[American Airlines]], [[United Airlines]] (originally a division of [[Boeing]]), [[Trans World Airlines]], [[Northwest Airlines]], and [[Eastern Air Lines]].

Service during the early 1920s was sporadic: most airlines at the time were focused on [[airmail#History|carrying bags of mail]]. In 1925, however, the [[Ford Motor Company]] bought out the [[William Bushnell Stout|Stout Aircraft Company]] and began construction of the all-metal [[Ford Trimotor]], which became the first successful American airliner. With a 12-passenger capacity, the Trimotor made passenger service potentially profitable. Air service was seen as a supplement to [[rail transport|rail]] service in the American transportation network.

At the same time, [[Juan Trippe]] began a crusade to create an air network that would link America to the world, and he achieved this goal through his airline, [[Pan American World Airways]], with a fleet of flying boats that linked [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] to [[Shanghai]] and [[Boston]] to [[London]]. Pan Am and Northwest Airways (which began flights to Canada in the 1920s) were the only U.S. airlines to go international before the 1940s.

With the introduction of the [[Boeing 247]] and [[Douglas DC-3]] in the 1930s, the U.S. airline industry was generally profitable, even during the [[Great Depression]]. This trend continued until the beginning of [[World War II]].

====Development since 1945====
[[File:Boeing 377 Stratocruiser (B-29) American Overseas 1949-50.jpg|thumb|In October 1945, the [[American Export Airlines]] became the first airline to offer regular commercial flights between North America and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Commercial_Aviation/atlantic_route/Tran4.htm |title=Air Transportation: The Beginnings of Commercial Transatlantic Service |publisher=Centennialofflight.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> Shown here is Am Ex [[Boeing 377]] ''Stratocruiser'' in 1949.]]

As governments met to set the standards and scope for an emergent civil air industry toward the end of the war, the U.S. took a position of maximum operating freedom; U.S. airline companies were not as hard-hit as European and the few Asian ones had been. This preference for "open skies" operating regimes continues, with limitations, to this day.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

World War II, like World War I, brought new life to the airline industry. Many airlines in the Allied countries were flush from lease contracts to the military, and foresaw a future explosive demand for civil air transport, for both passengers and cargo. They were eager to invest in the newly emerging flagships of air travel such as the [[Boeing Stratocruiser]], [[Lockheed Constellation]], and [[Douglas DC-6]]. Most of these new aircraft were based on American bombers such as the [[B-29]], which had spearheaded research into new technologies such as [[pressurization]]. Most offered increased efficiency from both added speed and greater payload.

In the 1950s, the [[De Havilland Comet]], [[Boeing 707]], [[Douglas DC-8]], and [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] became the first flagships of the Jet Age in the West, while the Eastern bloc had [[Tupolev Tu-104]] and [[Tupolev Tu-124]] in the fleets of state-owned carriers such as Czechoslovak [[Czech Airlines|ČSA]], Soviet [[Aeroflot]] and East-German [[Interflug]]. The [[Vickers Viscount]] and [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]] inaugurated turboprop transport.

The next big boost for the airlines would come in the 1970s, when the [[Boeing 747]], [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], and [[Lockheed L-1011]] inaugurated [[widebody]] ("jumbo jet") service, which is still the standard in international travel. The [[Tupolev Tu-144]] and its Western counterpart, [[Concorde]], made supersonic travel a reality. Concorde first flew in 1969 and operated through 2003. In 1972, [[Airbus]] began producing Europe's most commercially successful line of airliners to date. The added efficiencies for these aircraft were often not in speed, but in passenger capacity, payload, and range. Airbus also features modern electronic cockpits that were common across their aircraft to enable pilots to fly multiple models with minimal cross-training.

====US Airline Deregulation====

[[File:Pan Am Boeing 747 at Zurich Airport in May 1985.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pan Am]] [[Boeing 747]] ''Clipper Neptune's Car'' in 1985. The deregulation of the American airline industry increased the financial troubles of the iconic airline which ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Commercial_Aviation/Bankruptcy/Tran9.htm |title=Air Transportation: The Airline Bankruptcies of the 1980s |publisher=Centennialofflight.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>]]

1970 U.S. [[Airline deregulation act|airline industry deregulation]] lowered federally controlled barriers for new airlines just as a downturn in the nation's economy occurred. New start-ups entered during the downturn, during which time they found aircraft and funding, contracted hangar and maintenance services, trained new employees, and recruited laid off staff from other airlines.

Major airlines dominated their routes through aggressive pricing and additional capacity offerings, often swamping new start-ups. In the place of high barriers to entry imposed by regulation, the major airlines implemented an equally high barrier called [[loss leader]] pricing.<ref>name="Andrew R. Thomas">{{cite news

In many ways, the biggest winner in the deregulated environment was the air passenger. Although not exclusively attributable to deregulation, indeed the U.S. witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel. Many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers, even joining [[frequent flyer]] loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying. New services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city, do business, and return the same day, from almost any point in the country. Air travel's advantages put intercity bus lines under pressure, and most have withered away.

By the 1980s, almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the U.S., and today the domestic industry operates over 10,000 daily departures nationwide.

Toward the end of the century, a new style of [[low-cost carrier|low cost airline]] emerged, offering a no-frills product at a lower price. [[Southwest Airlines]], [[JetBlue]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Skybus Airlines]] and other low-cost carriers began to represent a serious challenge to the so-called "legacy airlines", as did their low-cost counterparts in many other countries. Their commercial viability represented a serious competitive threat to the legacy carriers. However, of these, [[ATA Airlines|ATA]] and Skybus have since ceased operations.

Increasingly since 1978, US airlines have been reincorporated and [[off spin|spun off]] by newly created and internally led manangement companies, and thus becoming nothing more than operating units and subsidiaries with limited financially decisive control. Among some of these [[holding company|holding companies]] and [[parent company|parent companies]] which are relatively well known, are the [[UAL Corporation]], along with the [[AMR Corporation]], among a long [[list of airline holding companies]] sometime recognized world wide.  Less recognized are the [[private equity firm]]s which often seize managerial, financial, and [[board of directors]] control of distressed airline companies by temporarily investing large sums of [[Equity (finance)|capital]] in air carriers, to rescheme an airlines assets into a profitable organization or [[liquidate|liquidating]] an air carrier of their profitable and worthwhile routes and business operations.

Thus the last 50 years of the airline industry have varied from reasonably profitable, to devastatingly depressed. As the first major market to deregulate the industry in 1978, U.S. airlines have experienced more turbulence than almost any other country or region. In fact, no U.S. [[legacy carrier]] survived bankruptcy-free. Amongst the outspoken critics of deregulation, former CEO of American Airlines, Robert Crandall has publicly stated: 

<blockquote>"Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing shows airline industry deregulation was a mistake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/45477274/AMR_Filing_Shows_Airline_Deregulation_Failed_Ex_CEO |title=Robert Cranall former CEO AA, CNBC}}</ref>"</blockquote>

====The Airline Industry Bailout====

Congress passed the [http://ostpxweb.ost.dot.gov/aviation/Data/stabilizationact.pdf Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act] (P.L. 107-42) in response to a severe liquidity crisis facing the already-troubled airline industry in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11th terrorist attacks]]. Congress sought to provide cash infusions to carriers for both the cost of the four-day federal shutdown of the airlines and the incremental losses incurred through December 31, 2001 as a result of the terrorist attacks. This resulted in the first government bailout of the 21st century.<ref>http://ostpxweb.ost.dot.gov/aviation/Data/stabilizationact.pdf</ref> Between 2000 and 2005 US airlines lost $30 billion with wage cuts of over $15 billion and 100,000 employees laid off.<ref name="Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009">{{cite book|url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100965480|author=Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. |year=2009 |title=Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees|publisher=Cornell University Press, Ithaca |chapter=chapter 5}}</ref>

In recognition of the essential national economic role of a healthy aviation system, Congress authorized partial compensation of up to $5 billion in cash subject to review by the [[Department of Transportation]] and up to $10 billion in loan guarantees subject to review by a newly created [[Air Transportation Stabilization Board]] (ATSB). The applications to DOT for reimbursements were subjected to rigorous multi-year reviews not only by DOT program personnel but also by the [[Government Accountability Office]]<ref>http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04725r.pdf</ref> and the DOT Inspector General.<ref>[http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=/data/pdfdocs/aa20011024.pdf ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=/data/pdfdocs/cr2003092.pdf ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>

Ultimately, the federal government provided $4.6 billion in one-time, subject-to-income-tax cash payments to 427 U.S. air carriers, with no provision for repayment, essentially a gift from the taxpayers. (Passenger carriers operating scheduled service received approximately $4 billion, subject to tax.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.gov/affairs/carrierpayments.htm |title=U |publisher=Dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> In addition, the ATSB approved loan guarantees to six airlines totaling approximately $1.6 billion.

===Asian airline industry===

Although [[Philippine Airlines]] (PAL) was officially founded on February 26, 1941, its license to operate as an airliner was derived from merged Philippine Aerial Taxi Company (PATCO) established by mining magnate Emmanuel N. Bachrach on December 3, 1930, making it Asia's oldest scheduled carrier still in operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/hawaiiaviation/hawaii-commercial-aviation/philippine-air-lines |title=Above the Pacific, by William Joseph Horvat, 1966, ISBN 978-0-8168-0000-1 |publisher=Hawaii.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> Commercial air service commenced three weeks later from [[Manila]] to [[Baguio]], making it Asia's first airline route. Bachrach's death in 1937 paved the way for its eventual merger with Philippine Airlines in March 1941 and made it Asia's oldest airline. It is also the oldest airline in Asia still operating under its current name.<ref name="PAL">Jane, ''[http://www.janes.com Jane's airlines & airliners By Jeremy Flack]'', First Edition, 2003, ISBN 978-0-00-715174-5</ref> Bachrach's majority share in PATCO was bought by beer magnate Andres R. Soriano in 1939 upon the advice of General [[Douglas McArthur]] and later merged with newly formed Philippine Airlines with PAL as the surviving entity. Soriano has controlling interest in both airlines before the merger. PAL restarted service on March 15, 1941 with a single [[Beech Model 18]] NPC-54 aircraft, which started its daily services between [[Manila]] (from [[Nielson Field]]) and [[Baguio]], later to expand with larger aircraft such as the DC-3 and Vickers Viscount.

[[India]] was also one of the first countries to embrace civil aviation.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=AcGn-Fmc43sC&pg=PA111&dq=tata+airlines+first+airline |title=An Introduction To Travel And Tourism By Pran Nath Seth, Sushma Seth Bhat |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22|isbn=978-81-207-2482-2|year=2005}}</ref> One of the first West Asian airline companies was [[Air India]], which had its beginning as [[Tata Airlines]] in 1932, a division of Tata Sons Ltd. (now [[Tata Group]]). The airline was founded by India's leading industrialist, [[JRD Tata]]. On October 15, 1932, J. R. D. Tata himself flew a single engined [[De Havilland Puss Moth]] carrying air mail (postal mail of [[Imperial Airways]]) from [[Karachi]] to [[Mumbai|Bombay]] via [[Ahmedabad]]. The aircraft continued to [[Madras]] via Bellary piloted by [[Royal Air Force]] pilot [[Nevill Vintcent]]. Tata Airlines was also one of the world's first major airlines which began its operations without any support from the Government.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=s0g7tCYYu-gC&pg=PA175&dq=tata+airlines+first+airline#PPA176,M1 |title=International Environmental Law By Bhatt |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2007-01-01|accessdate=2010-08-22|isbn=978-81-313-0125-8}}</ref>

With the outbreak of [[World War II]], the airline presence in Asia came to a relative halt, with many new flag carriers donating their aircraft for military aid and other uses. Following the end of the war in 1945, regular commercial service was restored in India and Tata Airlines became a public limited company on July 29, 1946 under the name Air India. After the [[independence of India]], 49% of the airline was acquired by the [[Government of India]]. In return, the airline was granted status to operate international services from India as the designated flag carrier under the name [[Air India International]].

On July 31, 1946, a chartered Philippine Airlines (PAL) [[DC-4]] ferried 40 American servicemen to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]] from Nielson Airport in [[Makati City]] with stops in [[Guam]], [[Wake Island]], [[Johnston Atoll]] and [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], making PAL the first Asian airline to cross the [[Pacific Ocean]]. A regular service between [[Manila]] and [[San Francisco]] was started in December. It was during this year that the airline was designated as the flag carrier of Philippines.

During the era of [[decolonization]], newly born Asian countries started to embrace air transport. Among the first Asian carriers during the era were [[Cathay Pacific]] of [[Hong Kong]] (founded in September 1946 ), [[Orient Airways]] (later [[Pakistan International Airlines]]; founded in October 1946), [[Malayan Airways Limited]] in 1947 (later [[Singapore Airlines|Singapore]] and [[Malaysia Airlines]]), [[El Al]] in [[Israel]] in 1948, [[Garuda Indonesia]] in 1948, [[Japan Airlines]] in 1951, [[Thai Airways International]] in 1960, and [[Korean National Airlines]] in 1947.

===Latin American airline industry===
[[File:Tam.a330-200.pt-mvl.arp.jpg|thumb|[[TAM Airlines]] is the largest airline in [[Latin America]] in terms of number of annual passengers flown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airtravel.about.com/od/basedincaribbeansa/tp/top10la.htm |title=Top 10 Airlines in Latin America By Arlene Fleming |publisher=Airtravel.about.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>]]

Among the first countries to have regular airlines in Latin America were [[Bolivia]] with [[Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano]], Cuba with [[Cubana de Aviación]], Colombia with [[Avianca]], [[Chile]] with [[LAN Chile]] (today [[LAN Airlines]]), [[Brazil]] with [[Varig]], [[Dominican Republic]] with [[Dominicana de Aviación]], [[Mexico]] with [[Mexicana de Aviación]], [[Venezuela]] with [[Aeropostal]], and [[Grupo TACA|TACA]] based in [[El Salvador]] and representing several airlines of [[Central America]] (Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua). All the previous airlines started regular operations well before World War II.

The air travel market has evolved rapidly over recent years in [[Latin America]]. Some industry estimates indicate that over 2,000 new aircraft will begin service over the next five years in this region.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

These airlines serve domestic flights within their countries, as well as connections within Latin America and also overseas flights to North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.

Only three airlines: [[LAN Airlines|LAN]], [[Avianca Brazil|OceanAir]] and [[TAM Airlines]] have international subsidiaries and cover a large number of destinations within the Americas as well as major hubs in other continents. LAN with [[Chile]] as the central operation along with [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]] and [[Argentina]] and some operations in the [[Dominican Republic]]. The recently formed [[AviancaTaca Holding|AviancaTACA]] group has control of [[Avianca Brazil]], [[VIP Ecuador]] and a strategic alliance with [[AeroGal]]. And TAM with its [[Mercosur]] base in [[Asuncion]], [[Paraguay]]. As of 2010, talks of uniting LAN and TAM have strongly developed to create a joint airline named [[LATAM Airlines Group|LATAM]].

==Regulatory considerations==

===National===
[[File:Garuda Indonesia Boeing 737-800 PER Koch-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Garuda Indonesia]] [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737 800]] parked at [[Perth International Airport]]. This Indonesian [[Flag carrier]] is wholly owned by the [[Politics of Indonesia|Indonesian Government]]]]

Many countries have [[Flag carrier|national airline]]s that the government owns and operates. Fully private airlines are subject to a great deal of government regulation for economic, political, and safety concerns. For instance, governments often intervene to halt airline labor actions to protect the free flow of people, communications, and goods between different regions without compromising safety.

The United States, Australia, and to a lesser extent Brazil, Mexico, India, the United Kingdom, and Japan have "deregulated" their airlines. In the past, these governments dictated airfares, route networks, and other operational requirements for each airline. Since deregulation, airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own operating arrangements with different airports, enter and exit routes easily, and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand.
[[File:Cyprus airways a330.jpg|thumb|[[Cyprus Airways]] national airline of Cyprus]]
The entry barriers for new airlines are lower in a deregulated market, and so the U.S. has seen hundreds of airlines start up (sometimes for only a brief operating period). This has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets, and average fares tend to drop 20% or more.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} The added competition, together with pricing freedom, means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that, to a limited degree, full service airlines must match. This is a major constraint on profitability for established carriers, which tend to have a higher cost base.

As a result, profitability in a deregulated market is uneven for most airlines. These forces have caused some major airlines to go out of business, in addition to most of the poorly established new entrants.

===International===
[[File:SIA Airbus A380, 9V-SKA, SIN 8.jpg|thumb|[[Singapore Airlines]] [[Airbus A380]] lands at [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]]. Singapore Airlines was the first international airline to operate the A380, the world's largest passenger airliner.<ref>[http://www.singaporeair.com/mediacentre/pacontent/news/NE_1608.jsp Singapore Airlines - News Releases]</ref>]]

Groups such as the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] establish worldwide standards for safety and other vital concerns. Most international air traffic is regulated by bilateral agreements between countries, which designate specific carriers to operate on specific routes. The model of such an agreement was the [[Bermuda Agreement]] between the US and UK following World War II, which designated airports to be used for transatlantic flights and gave each government the authority to nominate carriers to operate routes.

Bilateral agreements are based on the "[[freedoms of the air]]", a group of generalized traffic rights ranging from the freedom to overfly a country to the freedom to provide domestic flights within a country (a very rarely granted right known as [[cabotage]]). Most agreements permit airlines to fly from their home country to designated airports in the other country: some also extend the freedom to provide continuing service to a third country, or to another destination in the other country while carrying passengers from overseas.

In the 1990s, "[[open skies]]" agreements became more common. These agreements take many of these regulatory powers from state governments and open up international routes to further competition. Open skies agreements have met some criticism, particularly within the European Union, whose airlines would be at a comparative disadvantage with the United States' because of [[cabotage]] restrictions.

==Economic considerations==
[[File:Tran12G7.jpg|thumb|[[Juan Trippe]], the founder of [[Pan American World Airways]], surveying his globe. The collapse of Pan Am, an airline often credited for shaping the international airline industry, in December 1991 highlighted the financial complexities faced by major airline companies.]]

Historically, air travel has survived largely through state support, whether in the form of equity or subsidies. The airline industry as a whole has made a cumulative loss during its 100-year history, once the costs include subsidies for aircraft development and airport construction.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/airlines/story/0,,1715861,00.html Wings of Desire], Guardian, Thursday February 23, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.johnkay.com/2005/09/27/airlines-and-the-canine-features-of-unprofitable-industries/ Airlines and the canine features of unprofitable industries], Financial Times, September 27, 2005</ref>

One argument is that [[positive externalities]], such as higher growth due to global mobility, outweigh the microeconomic losses and justify continuing government intervention. A historically high level of government intervention in the airline industry can be seen as part of a wider political consensus on strategic forms of transport, such as [[highways]] and [[railways]], both of which receive public funding in most parts of the world. Profitability is likely to improve in the future as privatization continues and more competitive low-cost carriers proliferate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Although many countries continue to operate state-owned or parastatal airlines, many large airlines today are privately owned and are therefore governed by microeconomic principles to maximize shareholder profit.

===Ticket revenue===

Airlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability. The pricing of airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely determined by computerized [[yield management]] systems.

Because of the complications in scheduling flights and maintaining profitability, airlines have many loopholes that can be used by the knowledgeable traveler. Many of these airfare secrets are becoming more and more known to the general public, so airlines are forced to make constant adjustments.

Most airlines use differentiated pricing, a form of [[price discrimination]], to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments. Factors influencing the price include the days remaining until departure, the booked load factor, the forecast of total demand by price point, competitive pricing in force, and variations by day of week of departure and by time of day. Carriers often accomplish this by dividing each cabin of the aircraft (first, business and economy) into a number of [[travel class]]es for pricing purposes.

A complicating factor is that of origin-destination control ("O&D control"). Someone purchasing a ticket from Melbourne to Sydney (as an example) for A$200 is competing with someone else who wants to fly Melbourne to Los Angeles through Sydney on the same flight, and who is willing to pay A$1400. Should the airline prefer the $1400 passenger, or the $200 passenger plus a possible Sydney-Los Angeles passenger willing to pay $1300? Airlines have to make hundreds of thousands of similar pricing decisions daily.
[[File:Flughafen Frankfurt am Main.JPG|thumb|[[Lufthansa]] is the [[flag carrier]] airline of [[Germany]].]]

The advent of advanced computerized reservations systems in the late 1970s, most notably [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], allowed airlines to easily perform [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefit analyses]] on different pricing structures, leading to almost perfect price discrimination in some cases (that is, filling each seat on an aircraft at the highest price that can be charged without driving the consumer elsewhere).

The intense nature of airfare pricing has led to the term "[[fare war]]" to describe efforts by airlines to undercut other airlines on competitive routes. Through computers, new airfares can be published quickly and efficiently to the airlines' sales channels. For this purpose the airlines use the [[Airline Tariff Publishing Company]] (ATPCO), who distribute latest fares for more than 500 airlines to [[Computer Reservation System]]s across the world.

The extent of these pricing phenomena is strongest in "legacy" carriers. In contrast, low fare carriers usually offer preannounced and simplified price structure, and sometimes quote prices for each leg of a trip separately.

Computers also allow airlines to predict, with some accuracy, how many passengers will actually fly after making a reservation to fly. This allows airlines to overbook their flights enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for "no-shows," but not enough (in most cases) to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats, stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with [[overbooking]] on high demand flights can help reduce this figure. This is especially crucial during tough economic times as airlines undertake massive cuts to ticket prices to retain demand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cheapflights.co.uk/flights/2009/05/recession-prompts-surge-in-cheap-flights.html |title=Recession ‘prompts surge in cheap flights’ - Cheapflights.co.uk |publisher=News.cheapflights.co.uk |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>

===Operating costs===
[[File:virgin atlantic a340-600 g-vyou arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Airbus A340]]-600 of [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]]. In October 2008, Virgin Atlantic offered to combine its operations with [[BMI (airline)|BMI]] in an effort to reduce operating costs.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article5037731.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Virgin proposes tieup with BMI and Lufthansa | date=October 29, 2008 | accessdate=April 23, 2010 | first=David | last=Robertson}}</ref>]]

Full-service airlines have a high level of fixed and operating costs to establish and maintain air services: labor, fuel, airplanes, engines, spares and parts, IT services and networks, airport equipment, airport handling services, sales distribution, catering, training, [[aviation insurance]] and other costs. Thus all but a small percentage of the income from ticket sales is paid out to a wide variety of external providers or internal cost centers.

Moreover, the industry is structured so that airlines often act as tax collectors. Airline fuel is untaxed because of a series of treaties existing between countries. Ticket prices include a number of fees, taxes and surcharges beyond the control of airlines. Airlines are also responsible for enforcing government regulations. If airlines carry passengers without proper documentation on an international flight, they are responsible for returning them back to the original country.

Analysis of the 1992–1996 period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than the airlines, who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales. While airlines as a whole earned 6% return on capital employed (2-3.5% less than the cost of capital), airports earned 10%, catering companies 10-13%, handling companies 11-14%, aircraft lessors 15%, aircraft manufacturers 16%, and global distribution companies more than 30%. (Source: Spinetta, 2000, quoted in Doganis, 2002)

The widespread entrance of a new breed of low cost airlines beginning at the turn of the century has accelerated the demand that full service carriers control costs. Many of these low cost companies emulate Southwest Airlines in various respects, and like Southwest, they can eke out a consistent profit throughout all phases of the business cycle.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

As a result, a [[shakeout]] of airlines is occurring in the U.S. and elsewhere. [[American Airlines]], [[United Airlines]], [[Continental Airlines]] (twice), [[US Airways]] (twice), [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[Northwest Airlines]] have all declared [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy. Some{{Who|date=July 2008}} argue that it would be far better for the industry as a whole if a wave of actual closures were to reduce the number of "undead" airlines competing with healthy airlines while being artificially protected from creditors via [[bankruptcy]] law. On the other hand, some{{Who|date=July 2008}} have pointed out that the reduction in capacity would be short lived given that there would be large quantities of relatively new aircraft that bankruptcies would want to get rid of and would re-enter the market either as increased fleets for the survivors or the basis of cheap planes for new startups.

Where an airline has established an engineering base at an airport, then there may be considerable economic advantages in using that same airport as a preferred focus (or "hub") for its scheduled flights.

===Assets and financing===
[[File:Maslounge.jpg|thumb|The 'Golden Lounge' of [[Malaysia Airlines]] at [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] (KLIA). The airline has ownership of special slots at KLIA giving it a competitive edge over other airlines operating at the airport.]]

Airline financing is quite complex, since airlines are highly leveraged operations. Not only must they purchase (or lease) new airliner bodies and engines regularly, they must make major long-term fleet decisions with the goal of meeting the demands of their markets while producing a fleet that is relatively economical to operate and maintain. Compare Southwest Airlines and their reliance on a single airplane type (the [[Boeing 737]] and derivatives), with the now defunct [[Eastern Air Lines]] which operated 17 different aircraft types, each with varying pilot, engine, maintenance, and support needs.

A second financial issue is that of [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[fuel]] purchases, which are usually second only to [[Labour (economics)|labor]] in its relative cost to the company. However, with the current high fuel prices it has become the largest cost to an airline. Legacy airlines, compared with new entrants, have been hit harder by rising fuel prices partly due to the running of older, less fuel efficient aircraft.<ref name="Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009"/> While hedging instruments can be expensive, they can easily pay for themselves many times over in periods of increasing fuel costs, such as in the 2000–2005 period.

In view of the congestion apparent at many international [[airport]]s, the ownership of slots at certain airports (the right to take-off or land an aircraft at a particular time of day or night) has become a significant tradable asset for many airlines. Clearly take-off slots at popular times of the day can be critical in attracting the more profitable business traveler to a given airline's flight and in establishing a competitive advantage against a competing airline.

If a particular city has two or more airports, market forces will tend to attract the less profitable routes, or those on which competition is weakest, to the less congested airport, where slots are likely to be more available and therefore cheaper. For example, [[Reagan National Airport]] attracts profitable routes due partly to its congestion, leaving less-profitable routes to [[Baltimore-Washington International Airport]] and [[Dulles International Airport]].

Other factors, such as surface transport facilities and onward connections, will also affect the relative appeal of different airports and some long distance flights may need to operate from the one with the longest runway. For example, [[LaGuardia Airport]] is the preferred airport for most of [[Manhattan]] due to its proximity, while long-distance routes must use [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]'s longer runways.

===Airline partnerships===
[[File:JA8941-oneworld-01.jpg|thumb|A [[Japan Airlines]] Boeing 777-300 with special [[Oneworld]] livery. Oneworld is the third largest airline alliance after [[Star Alliance]] and [[SkyTeam]].]]

[[Codeshare agreement|Codesharing]] is the most common type of airline partnership; it involves one airline selling tickets for another airline's flights under its own airline code. An early example of this was Japan Airlines' (JAL) codesharing partnership with Aeroflot in the 1960s on [[Tokyo]]–[[Moscow]] flights; Aeroflot operated the flights using Aeroflot aircraft, but JAL sold tickets for the flights as if they were JAL flights. This practice allows airlines to expand their operations, at least on paper, into parts of the world where they cannot afford to establish bases or purchase aircraft. Another example was the [[Austrian Airlines|Austrian]]– [[Sabena]] partnership on the [[Vienna]]–[[Brussels]]–[[New York City|New York]]/JFK route during the late '60s, using a Sabena [[Boeing 707]] with Austrian [[Aircraft livery|livery]].

Since airline reservation requests are often made by city-pair (such as "show me flights from Chicago to Düsseldorf"), an airline that can codeshare with another airline for a variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering a Chicago–[[Düsseldorf]] flight. The passenger is advised however, that airline no. 1 operates the flight from say Chicago to Amsterdam, and airline no. 2 operates the continuing flight (on a different airplane, sometimes from another terminal) to Düsseldorf. Thus the primary rationale for code sharing is to expand one's service offerings in city-pair terms to increase sales.

A more recent development is the [[airline alliance]], which became prevalent in late 1990s. These alliances can act as virtual mergers to get around government restrictions. Alliances of airlines such as [[Star Alliance]], [[Oneworld]], and [[SkyTeam]] coordinate their passenger service programs (such as lounges and [[frequent-flyer program]]s), offer special interline tickets, and often engage in extensive codesharing (sometimes systemwide). These are increasingly integrated business combinations—sometimes including cross-equity arrangements—in which products, service standards, schedules, and airport facilities are standardized and combined for higher efficiency. One of the first airlines to start an alliance with another airline was [[KLM]], who partnered with [[Northwest Airlines]]. Both airlines later entered the SkyTeam alliance after the [[Air France-KLM|fusion of KLM and Air France]] in 2004.

Often the companies combine [[Information technology|IT]] operations, or purchase fuel and aircraft as a bloc to achieve higher bargaining power. However, the alliances have been most successful at purchasing invisible supplies and services, such as fuel. Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors. If an airline's main domestic competitor flies Boeing airliners, then the airline may prefer to use Airbus aircraft regardless of what the rest of the alliance chooses.

===Fuel hedging===

[[File:Jetfuel.jpg|thumb| Average jet fuel prices per gallon for major United States airlines.]]

Southwest is credited with maintaining strong business profits between 1999 and the early 2000s due to its fuel hedging policy.  Looking at the annual reports, many other airlines are replicating Southwest's hedging policy to control their fuel costs.

Growth of the industry in recent years raised a number of ecological questions. 

Domestic air transport grew in China at 15.5 percent annually from 2001 to 2006. The rate of air travel globally increased at 3.7 percent per year over the same time.

Despite continuing efficiency improvements from the major aircraft manufacturers, the expanding demand for global air travel has resulted in growing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Currently, the aviation sector, including US domestic and global international travel, make approximately 1.6 percent of global anthropogenic GHG emissions per annum. North America accounts for nearly 40 percent of the world's GHG emissions from aviation fuel use.<ref>David McCollum, Gregory Gould, and David Greene. Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Aviation and Marine Transportation: Mitigation Potential and Policies, 2009.</ref>

CO2 emissions from the [[jet fuel]] burned per passenger on an average {{convert|3200|km|mi|sp=us}} airline flight is about 353 kilograms (776&nbsp;pounds).<ref>{{cite web|title=carbon-footprint-calculator|url=http://www.terrapass.com/carbon-footprint-calculator/methodology-popup.html|publisher= TerraPass.com|accessdate=Feb 19, 2008}}</ref> Loss of natural habitat potential associated with the jet fuel burned per passenger on a {{convert|3200|km|mi|sp=us}} airline flight is estimated to be 250 square meters (2700 square feet).{{Verify source|date=May 2010}}<ref>{{cite web|title=environmental impact of airline flights|url=http://ecofx.org/wiki/index.php?title=Airline|publisher=ecofx.org|accessdate=Feb 19, 2008}}</ref>

In the context of purported climate change and [[peak oil]], there is a debate about possible [[taxation]] of air travel and the inclusion of aviation in an [[emissions trading]] scheme, with a view to ensuring that the total [[external costs]] of aviation are taken into account.<ref>[http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/trading/eu/pdf/including-aviation-icf.pdf Including Aviation into the EU ETS: Impact on EU allowance prices] ICF Consulting for DEFRA February 2006</ref>

The airline industry is responsible for about 11 percent of [[greenhouse gas]]es emitted by the U.S. transportation sector. [[Boeing]] estimates that biofuels could reduce flight-related greenhouse-gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent. The solution would be blending algae fuels with existing jet fuel:<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/03/AR2008010303907.html | work=The Washington Post | title=A Promising Oil Alternative: Algae Energy | date=January 6, 2008 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref>

* Boeing and [[Air New Zealand]] are collaborating with leading Brazilian biofuels maker [[Tecbio]] and [[Aquaflow Bionomic]] of New Zealand and other jet biofuel developers around the world.
* [[Virgin Atlantic]] and [[Virgin Green Fund]] are looking into the technology as part of a biofuels initiative.<ref>{{cite web|author=By Ángel González |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/boeingaerospace/2003858756_boeingenergy30.html |title=Boeing/aerospace &#124; To go green in jet fuel, Boeing looks at algae &#124; Seattle Times Newspaper |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=2007-08-30 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>
* KLM has made the first commercial flight with bio-fuel in 2009.

There are [[Electric aircraft]] projects, where some of them are fully operational planes as of 2013.

==Call signs==

Each operator of a scheduled or charter flight uses an [[Airline codes|airline call sign]] when communicating with airports or air traffic control centres. Most of these call-signs are derived from the airline's trade name, but for reasons of history, marketing, or the need to reduce ambiguity in spoken English (so that pilots do not mistakenly make navigational decisions based on instructions issued to a different aircraft), some airlines and air forces use call-signs less obviously connected with their trading name. For example, British Airways uses a ''Speedbird'' call-sign, named after the logo of its predecessor, [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]], while [[SkyEurope]] used ''Relax''.

==Airline personnel==
[[File:Air Bishkek A320-200 EX-32002 DME Dec 2012.png|thumb|An [[Air Bishkek]] [[Airbus A320]] landing at [[Domodedovo Airport]]. (2012)]]
The various types of airline personnel include:
Flight operations personnel including flight safety personnel.
* [[Flight crew]], responsible for the operation of the aircraft. Flight crew members include:
** [[Aviator|Pilots]] ([[Pilot in command|Captain]] and [[First officer (civil aviation)|First Officer]]: some older aircraft also required a [[Flight Engineer]] and or a [[Navigator]])
** [[Flight attendant]]s, (led by a [[purser]] on larger aircraft)
** [[Sky marshal|in-flight security personnel]] on some airlines (most notably [[El Al]])
* [[Groundcrew]], responsible for operations at airports. Ground crew members include:
** Aerospace and avionics engineers responsible for certifying the aircraft for flight and management of aircraft maintenance
*** [[Aerospace]] engineers, responsible for airframe, powerplant and electrical systems maintenance
*** [[Avionics]] engineers responsible for avionics and instruments maintenance
** [[Airframe]] and [[Aircraft engine|powerplant]] technicians
** Electric System technicians, responsible for maintenance of electrical systems
** [[Avionics]] technicians, responsible for maintenance of avionics
** [[Flight dispatcher]]s
** [[Baggage handler]]s
** Ramp Agents
** Remote centralised weight and balancing<ref>www.globalloadcontrol.com</ref>
** [[Gate agent]]s
** Ticket agents
** Passenger service agents (such as [[airline lounge]] employees)
** Reservation agents, usually (but not always) at facilities outside the airport.
** Crew schedulers
Airlines follow a [[corporation|corporate]] structure where each broad area of operations (such as maintenance, flight operations(including flight safety),
and passenger service) is supervised by a vice president. Larger airlines often appoint vice presidents to oversee each of the
airline's hubs as well. Airlines employ [[lawyers]] to deal with regulatory procedures and other administrative tasks.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Industry trends==
[[File:World-airline-routemap-2009.png|thumb|256px|Map of scheduled airline traffic in 2009]]

The pattern of ownership has been privatized in the recent years, that is, the ownership has gradually changed from governments to private and individual sectors or organizations. This occurs as regulators permit greater freedom and non-government ownership, in steps that are usually decades apart. This pattern is not seen for all airlines in all regions. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The overall trend of demand has been consistently increasing. In the 1950s and 1960s, annual growth rates of 15% or more were common. Annual growth of 5-6% persisted through the 1980s and 1990s{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Growth rates are not consistent in all regions, but countries with a de-regulated airline industry have more competition and greater pricing freedom. This results in lower fares and sometimes dramatic spurts in traffic growth. The U.S., Australia, Canada, [[Japan]], [[Brazil]], [[India]] and other markets exhibit this trend.  The industry has been observed to be cyclical in its financial performance. Four or five years of poor earnings precede five or six years of improvement. But profitability even in the good years is generally low, in the range of 2-3% net profit after interest and tax. In times of profit, airlines lease new generations of airplanes and upgrade services in response to higher demand. Since 1980, the industry has not earned back the cost of capital during the best of times. Conversely, in bad times losses can be dramatically worse.  [[Warren Buffett]] once said that despite all the money that has been invested in all airlines, the net profit is less than zero. He believes it is one of the hardest businesses to manage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiancapitalist.com/buffetts-spot-on-advice/ |title=Buffett’s spot-on advice |publisher=Money Sense |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>

As in many mature industries, consolidation is a trend. Airline groupings may consist of limited bilateral partnerships, long-term, multi-faceted alliances between carriers, equity arrangements, [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]], or [[takeover]]s. Since governments often restrict ownership and merger between companies in different countries, most consolidation takes place within a country. In the U.S., over 200 airlines have merged, been taken over, or gone out of business since deregulation in 1978. Many international airline managers are lobbying their governments to permit greater consolidation to achieve higher economy and efficiency.
