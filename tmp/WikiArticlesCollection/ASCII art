'''ASCII art''' is a [[graphic design]] technique that uses [[computer]]s for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable (from a total of 128) [[character (computing)|characters]] defined by the [[ASCII]] Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters (beyond the 128 characters of standard [[7-bit ASCII]]<!-- leave it as 7-bit for accuracy -->). The term is also loosely used to refer to [[#Other text-based visual art|text based visual art in general]]. ASCII art can be created with any [[text editor]], and is often used with [[free-form language]]s. Most examples of ASCII [[art]] require a [[typeface#Proportion|fixed-width font]] (non-proportional [[typeface|fonts]], as on a traditional [[typewriter]]) such as [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] for presentation.

Among the oldest known examples of ASCII art are the
creations by computer-art pioneer [[Kenneth Knowlton]] from around 1966, who was working for [[Bell Labs]] at the time.<ref name="cgihist">{{Citation

One of the main reasons ASCII art was born was because early printers often lacked graphics ability and thus characters were used in place of graphic marks. Also, to mark divisions between different print jobs from different users, bulk printers often used ASCII art to print large banners, making the division easier to spot so that the results could be more easily separated by a computer operator or clerk. ASCII art was also used in early e-mail when images could not be embedded.

==History==

===Typewriter art===
Since 1867 typewriters have been used for creating visual art.{{better source|date=August 2013}} The oldest known preserved example of typewriter art is a picture of a butterfly made in 1898 by Flora Stacey.<!-- primary site http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/7373/history.htm#typewrite --><ref>{{cite web| last=Stark| first=Joan G.| authorlink=Joan Stark| title=The History of ASCII (Text) Art| year=2001| accessdate=5 March 2008|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5klVZl8en#typewrite|archivedate=24 October 2009|deadurl=yes|url=http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/7373/history.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.typewritermuseum.org/lib/library_art2.html|title=Typewriter Art|last=Robert|first=Paul|date=11 May 2005|publisher=The Virtual Typewriter Museum|accessdate=5 March 2008}}</ref> Typewriter art was also called keyboard art.<ref>[http://chris.com/ascii/index.php?page=popular-mechanics "Keyboard Art"] by Paul Hadley Popular Mechanics, October, 1948</ref> 
In the 1954 short film ''[[Stamp Day for Superman]]'', typewriter art was a feature of the plot.

===TTY and RTTY===
TTY stands for "TeleTYpe" or "TeleTYpewriter" and is also known as [[Teleprinter]] or [[Teletype]].
RTTY stands for [[Radioteletype]]; [[character set]]s such as [[Baudot code]], which predated ASCII, were used. According to a chapter in the "RTTY Handbook", text images have been sent via teletypewriter as early as 1923.<ref name=rttyhb>{{cite book|last=Green|first=Wayne|title=RTTY Handbook|publisher=G/L Tab Books|location=[[Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania]]|date=June 1972|isbn=0-8306-2597-6}}</ref> However, none of the "old" RTTY art has been discovered yet. What is known is that text images appeared frequently on radioteletype in the 1960s and the 1970s.<ref name="joan">{{Citation | last=Stark| first=Joan G. | authorlink=Joan Stark | title=DEVELOPMENT OF (ASCII) TEXT ART | year=2000| accessdate=5 March 2008|url=http://www.geocities.com/joan_stark/textasciihistory.txt|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5klVaBjlA|archivedate=24 October 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rtty.com/gallery/rttyeasy.htm RTTY Art Made Easy, RTTY Journal November 1970]</ref>

===Line-printer art===

In the 1960's, [[Andries van Dam]] published a representation of an electronic circuit produced on an [[IBM 1403]] line printer.<ref>http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/afips/1967/5069/00/50690601.pdf</ref>  At the same time, [[Kenneth Knowlton]] was producing realistic images, also on line printers, by overprinting several characters on top of one another.<ref name=sip1/>

===ASCII art===
[[Image:ASCII full.svg|frame|There are 95 printable ASCII characters, numbered 32 to 126.]]
The widespread usage of ASCII art can be traced to the computer [[bulletin board system]]s of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The limitations of computers of that time period necessitated the use of text characters to represent images. Along with ASCII's use in communication, however, it also began to appear in the underground online art groups of the period. An ASCII comic is a form of webcomic which uses ASCII text to create images. In place of images in a regular comic, ASCII art is used, with the text or dialog usually placed underneath.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

During the 1990s, graphical browsing and [[variable-width]] [[Computer font|fonts]] became increasingly popular, leading to a decline in ASCII art.  Despite this, ASCII art continued to survive through online [[MUD]]s, an acronym for "Multi-User Dungeon", (which are textual [[Multiplayer game|multiplayer]] [[role-playing video game]]s), [[Internet Relay Chat]], [[E-mail]], [[message boards]] and other forms of online communication which commonly employ the needed [[fixed-width]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===ANSI===

ASCII and more importantly, [[ANSI escape code|ANSI]] were staples of the early technological era; terminal systems relied on coherent presentation using color and control signals standard in the terminal protocols.

Over the years, [[warez]] groups began to enter the ASCII art scene.<ref>{{Citation | last=Necromancer| title=History of the PC Ascii Scene | publisher=[[textfiles.com]]| date=6 March 1998 | url=http://artscene.textfiles.com/history/essays/pcascii.txt | accessdate=5 March 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080215200828/http://artscene.textfiles.com/history/essays/pcascii.txt| archivedate= 15 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Warez groups usually release [[.nfo]] files with their software, [[Software cracking|cracks]] or other general software reverse-engineering releases.<ref>{{Citation

[[Bulletin board system|BBS]] systems were based on ASCII and ANSI art, as were most [[DOS]] and similar [[System console|console]] applications, and the procursor to [[AOL]].

==Uses==
[[Image:ASCII Panzer unt Sattelzug.png|right|thumb|A tank and truck made using ASCII art]]
ASCII art is used wherever text can be more readily printed or transmitted than graphics, or in some cases, where the transmission of pictures is not possible. This includes typewriters, [[teleprinter]]s, non-graphic [[computer terminal]]s, [[printer separator]]s, in early [[computer network]]ing (e.g., [[bulletin board system|BBSes]]), [[e-mail]], and [[Usenet]] news messages. ASCII art is also used within the [[source code]] of computer programs for representation of company or product logos, and flow control or other diagrams. In some cases, the entire source code of a program is a piece of ASCII art – for instance, an entry to one of the earlier [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]] is a program that adds numbers, but visually looks like a binary adder drawn in logic ports.

Examples of ASCII-style art predating the modern computer era can be found in the June 1939, July 1948 and October 1948 editions of Popular Mechanics.<ref name="popscience">{{cite web|url=http://www.roysac.com/blog/2007/02/keyboard-text-art-from-over-twenty-years-before-ascii/|title=Keyboard Text Art From Over Twenty Years Before ASCII|last=Cumbrowski|first=Carsten|date=14 February 2007|publisher=roysac.com|accessdate=5 March 2008}}</ref>

"0verkill" is a 2D platform multiplayer shooter game designed entirely in colour ASCII art. [[MPlayer]] and [[VLC media player]] can display videos as ASCII art. ASCII art is used in the making of DOS-based [[ZZT]] games.

Many game walkthrough guides come as part of a basic .txt file; this file often contains the name of the game in ASCII art. Such as below, word art is created using backslashes and other ASCII values in order to create the illusion of 3D.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}<!-- need source for illustration -->

== Types and styles ==
Different techniques could be used in ASCII art to obtain different artistic effects. Electronic circuits and diagrams were implemented by [[typewriter]] or [[teletype]] and provided the pretense{{clarify|date=June 2012}} for ASCII.

Line art, for creating shapes: 
 .--.     /\                ____
 '--'    /__\    (^._.^)~ <(o.o )>

Solid art, for creating filled objects:
 .g@8g.  db
 'Y8@P' d88b

Shading, using symbols with various intensities for creating gradients or contrasts:
 :$#$: "4b. ':.
 :$#$:   "4b. ':.

Combinations of the above, often used as signatures, for example, at the end of an email:
   |\_/|        ****************************    (\_/)
  / @ @ \       *  "Purrrfectly pleasant"  *   (='.'=)
 ( > º < )      *       Poppy Prinz        *   (")_(") 
  `&gt;&gt;x&lt;&lt;´       *   (pprinz@example.com)   *
  /  O  \       ****************************

=== Emoticons and verticons ===
{{Main|Emoticon}}
The simplest forms of ASCII art are combinations of two or three characters for expressing emotion in text.  They are commonly referred to as '[[emoticon]]', 'smilie', or '[[smiley]]'.

There is another type of one-line ASCII art that does not require the mental rotation of pictures, which is widely known in Japan as [[Emoticon#Japanese style|kaomoji]] (literally "face characters".) Traditionally, they are referred to as "ASCII face".

More complex examples use several lines of text to draw large symbols or more complex figures.

ATASCII text animations are also referred to as "break animations" by the Atari sceners.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

====C-64 PETSCII====
The [[Commodore 64]], which was released in 1982, also did not follow the ASCII standard. The C-64 character set is called [[PETSCII]], an extended form of [[ASCII]]-1963. As with the Atari's ATASCII art, C-64 fans developed a similar scene that used PETSCII for their creations.

===="Block ASCII" / "High ASCII" style ASCII art on the IBM PC====
{{sync|ANSI art}}
[[Image:ASCII notepad acidview compare.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Block ASCII display via Notepad versus ACiDView for Windows]]
So-called "block ASCII" or "high ASCII" uses the extended characters of the 8-bit [[code page 437]], which is a proprietary standard introduced by [[IBM]] in 1979 (ANSI Standard x3.16) for the IBM PC DOS and MS-DOS operating systems. "Block ASCIIs" were widely used on the PC during the 1990s until the Internet replaced BBSes as the main communication platform. Until then, "block ASCIIs" dominated the [[Computer art scene|PC Text Art Scene]].<ref name="asciistyles">[http://www.RoySAC.com/roy-sac_styles_of_underground_text_art.asp The three Styles of the Underground ASCII Art Scene], Article 01, 2006, Roy/[[Superior Art Creations|SAC]], [http://www.RoySAC.com RoySAC.com]</ref><ref name="ddarthistory">[http://cd.textfiles.com/darkdomain/www/html/history-art_scene.html An Abbreviated History of the Underground Computer Art Scene] by Napalm, 11/10/1998, The History of Art and Technology</ref>

The first art scene group that focused on the extended character set of the PC in their art work was called "Aces of ANSI Art," or "AAA." Some members left in 1990, and formed a group called [[ACiD Productions|ACiD]], "ANSI Creators in Demand." In that same year the second major underground art scene group was founded, [[iCE Advertisements|ICE]], "Insane Creators Enterprise".<ref name="100years">[http://www.cow.net/conned/notacon/artscene/notacon-100artscene-transcript.txt 100 YEARS OF THE COMPUTER ART SCENE], Presented by [[Jason Scott Sadofsky]] and [[RaD Man]] ([[ACiD Productions|ACiD]]), [[Notacon]] Conference – Cleveland, Ohio, USA,  23–25 April 2004</ref>

There is some debate between ASCII and block ASCII artist, with "Hardcore" ASCII artists maintaining that block ASCII art is in fact not [[ANSI art]], because it does not use the 128 characters of the original ASCII standard. On the other hand, block ASCII artists argue that if their art uses only characters of the computers character set, then it is to be called ASCII, regardless if the character set is proprietary or not.<!--original sentence was entirely ungrammatical; I hope this one gets the proper meaning across-->

Microsoft Windows does not support the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI Standard]] x3.16. One can view block ASCIIs with a text editor using the font "[[Terminal (font)|Terminal]]", but it will not look exactly as it was intended by the artist. With a special ASCII/ANSI viewer, such as ACiDView for Windows (see ASCII and ANSI art viewers), one can see block ASCII and ANSI files properly. An example that [[#.22Block.22 ASCII art|illustrates the difference]] in appearance is part of this article. Alternatively, one could look at the file using the Type command in the command prompt.

===="Amiga"/"Oldskool" style ASCII art====
[[Image:Paso-IceCream-AmigaVsPC.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Oldschool/Amiga ASCII look on Commodore Amiga Computer versus look on the IBM PC (notice the tight spacing)]]
In the art scene one popular ASCII style that used the 7-bit standard ASCII character set was the so-called "Oldskool" Style. It is also called "Amiga style", due to its origin and widespread use on the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] Computers. The style uses primarily the characters: <tt>_/\-+=.()<>:</tt>. The "oldskool" art looks more like the outlined drawings of shapes than real pictures.
This is an example of "[[Amiga]] style" (also referred to as "old school" or "oldskool" style) [[computer art scene|scene]] ASCII art.<ref name="asciistyles" />

The Amiga ASCII Scene surfaced in 1992, seven years after the introduction of the Commodore [[Amiga 1000]]. The Commodore 64 PETSCII scene did not make the transition to the Commodore Amiga as the C64 demo and warez scenes did. Among the first Amiga ASCII art groups were ART, Epsilon Design, Upper Class, Unreal. This means that the text art scene on the Amiga was actually younger than the text art scene on the PC. The Amiga artists also did not call their ASCII art style "Oldskool". That term was introduced on the PC. When and by whom is unknown and lost in history.

The Amiga style ASCII artwork was most often released in the form of a single text file, which included all the artwork (usually requested), with some design parts in between, as opposed to the PC art scene where the art work was released as a [[ZIP archive]] with separate text files for each piece. Furthermore, the releases were usually called "ASCII collections" and not "art packs" like on the IBM PC.

====Newskool style ASCII art====
[[Image:Roy-csnewskool.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Newskool ASCII Screenshot]]
"Newskool" is a popular form of ASCII art which capitalizes on character strings like  "$#Xxo".  In spite of its name, the style is not "new"; on the contrary, it was very old but fell out of favor and was replaced by "Oldskool" and "Block" style ASCII art. It was dubbed "Newskool" upon its comeback and renewed popularity at the end of the 1990s.<ref name="asciistyles" />

Newskool changed significantly as the result of the introduction of [[Character encoding|extended proprietary characters]]. The classic 7-bit standard ASCII characters remain predominant, but the extended characters are often used for "fine tuning" and "tweaking". The style developed further after the introduction and adaptation of [[Unicode]].

==Methods for generating ASCII art==
{{Main|List of text editors#ASCII and ANSI art}}

While some prefer to use a simple [[text editor]] to produce ASCII art, specialized programs, such as [[JavE]] have been developed that often simulate the features and tools in bitmap image editors. For Block ASCII art and ANSI art the artist almost always uses a special text editor, because the required characters are not available on a standard keyboard.

The special text editors have sets of special characters assigned to existing keys on the keyboard. Popular MS DOS based editors, such as [[TheDraw]] and ACiDDraw had multiple sets of different special characters mapped to the F-Keys to make the use of those characters easier for the artist who can switch between individual sets of characters via basic keyboard shortcuts. PabloDraw is one of the very few special ASCII/ANSI art editors that were developed for MS Windows XP.

===Image to text conversion===
{{Main|ASCII art converter}}

Other programs allow one to automatically convert an image to text characters, which is a special case of [[vector quantization]]. A method is to sample the image down to [[grayscale]] with less than [[integer (computer science)|8-bit]] precision, and then assign a character for each value.  Such ASCII art generators often allow users to choose the intensity and contrast of the generated image.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asciiartgenerator.net/ascii-art-generator-an-overview/|title=ASCII Art Generator: An Overview|date=12 January 2012|publisher=asciiartgenerator.net|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref>

Examples of converted images are given below.

This is one of the earliest forms of ASCII art, dating back to the early days of the 1960s [[minicomputer]]s and [[teletype]]s. During the 1970s it was popular in [[shopping mall|malls]] to get a [[t-shirt]] with a photograph printed in ASCII art on it from an automated kiosk manned by a computer. With the advent of the web and [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], many ASCII conversion programs will now quantize to a full [[RGB color model|RGB]] colorspace, enabling colorized ASCII images.

Still images or movies can also be converted to ASCII on various Linux and UNIX computers using the [http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/aalib aalib (black and white)] or [http://sam.zoy.org/libcaca libcaca (colour)] graphics device driver, or the [[VLC media player]] under [[Windows]], Linux or [[OS X]]; all of which render the screen using ASCII symbols instead of pixels.  See also [http://oreilly.com/pub/h/4441 O'Reilly article "Watch Videos in ASCII art"].

There are also a number of [[smartphone]] applications, such as ASCII cam for [[Android (operating system)|Android]], that generate ASCII art in real-time using input from the phone's camera. These applications typically allow the ASCII art to be saved as either a text file or as an image made up of ASCII text.

==Non fixed-width ASCII==
Most ASCII art is created using a [[monospace font]], where all characters are identical in width ([[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] is a popular monospace font). Early computers in use when ASCII art came into vogue had monospace fonts for screen and printer displays. Today most of the more commonly used fonts in word processors, web browsers and other programs are proportional fonts, such as [[Helvetica]] or [[Times Roman]], where different widths are used for different characters. ASCII art drawn for a fixed width font will usually appear distorted, or even unrecognizable when displayed in a proportional font.

Some ASCII artists have produced art for display in proportional fonts. These ASCIIs, rather than using a purely shade-based correspondence, use characters for slopes and borders and use block shading. These ASCIIs generally offer greater precision and attention to detail than fixed-width ASCIIs for a lower character count, although they are not as universally accessible since they are usually relatively font-specific.

==Animated ASCII art==
Animated ASCII art started in 1970  from so-called VT100 animations produced on [[vt100]] terminals. These animations were simply text with cursor movement instructions, deleting and erasing the characters necessary to appear animated. Usually, they represented a long hand-crafted process undertaken by a single person to tell a story.

Contemporary [[web browser]] revitalized animated ASCII art again. It became possible to display animated ASCII art via [[JavaScript]] or [[Java (Sun)|Java applets]]. Static ASCII art pictures are loaded and displayed one after another, creating the animation, very similar to how movie projectors  unreel film reel and project the individual pictures on the big screen at movie theaters. A new term was born: ''ASCIImation'' – another name of Animated ASCII Art. A seminal work in this arena is the Star Wars ASCIImation.<ref>{{cite web

There are now many tools and programs that can transform raster images into text symbols; some of these tools can operate on streaming video. For example, the music video for pop singer [[Beck Hansen]]'s song "Black Tambourine"<ref name=beckbt>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEXaEYpifhg Black Tambourine] ASCIImation Music Video by [[Beck Hansen]] at [[YouTube.com]]</ref> is made up entirely of ASCII characters that approximate the original footage.

==Other text-based visual art==
There are a variety of other types of art using text symbols from character sets other than ASCII and/or some form of color coding. Despite not being pure ASCII, these are still often referred to as "ASCII art". The character set portion designed specifically for drawing is known as the line drawing characters or [[pseudo-graphics]].

===ANSI art===
{{Main|ANSI art}}
The IBM PC graphics hardware in text mode uses 16 bits per character. It supports a variety of configurations, but in its default mode under DOS they are used to give 256 glyphs from one of the IBM PC code pages ([[Code page 437]] by default), 16 foreground colors, eight background colors, and a flash option. Such art can be loaded into screen memory directly. ANSI.SYS, if loaded, also allows such art to be placed on screen by outputting escape sequences that indicate movements of the screen cursor and color/flash changes. If this method is used then the art becomes known as [[ANSI art]]. The IBM PC code pages also include characters intended for simple drawing which often made this art appear much cleaner than that made with more traditional character sets. Plain text files are also seen with these characters, though they have become far less common since Windows GUI text editors (using the [[Windows ANSI code page]]) have largely replaced DOS based ones.

===Shift_JIS===

{{Main|Shift_JIS art}}
A large character selection and the availability of fixed-width characters allow Japanese users to use [[Shift JIS]] as a text-based art on Japanese websites.

==== Special circumstances of Japan ====
Japanese mainly refer to ASCII-art (AA) as '''Shift-JIS Art''' in Japan.

===Unicode===
{{Main|Unicode}}
[[Unicode]] would seem to offer the ultimate flexibility in producing text based art with its huge variety of characters. However, finding a suitable fixed-width font is likely to be difficult if a significant subset of Unicode is desired. (Modern UNIX-style operating systems do provide complete fixed-width Unicode fonts, e.g. for [[xterm]]. Windows has the [[Courier New]] font which includes characters like ┌╥─╨┐♥☺Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ) Also, the common practice of rendering Unicode with a mixture of variable width fonts is likely to make predictable display hard if more than a tiny subset of Unicode is used.

===Overprinting (surprint)===
In the 1970s and early 1980s it was popular to produce a kind of text art that relied on overprinting – the overall darkness of a particular character space dependent on how many characters, as well as the choice of character, printed in a particular place. Thanks to the increased granularity of tone, photographs were often converted to this type of printout. Even manual typewriters or [[daisy wheel printer]]s could be used. The technique has fallen from popularity since all cheap printers can easily print photographs, and a normal text file (or an e-mail message or Usenet posting) cannot represent overprinted text. However, something similar has emerged to replace it: shaded or colored ASCII art, using ANSI video terminal markup or color codes (such as those found in [[HTML]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and many internet [[message board]]s) to add a bit more tone variation. In this way, it is possible to create ASCII art where the characters only differ in color.
