'''''Destry Rides Again''''' (aka ''The Man from Montana'') (1939) is a [[Western (genre)|western]] starring [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[James Stewart]], and directed by [[George Marshall (director)|George Marshall]]. The supporting cast includes [[Mischa Auer]], [[Charles Winninger]], [[Brian Donlevy]], [[Allen Jenkins]], [[Irene Hervey]], [[Billy Gilbert]], [[Bill Cody, Jr.]], [[Lillian Yarbo]], and [[Una Merkel]]. It bears no relation to [[Max Brand]]'s [[Destry Rides Again (novel)|popular novel]]; the characters and story are completely different and unrelated.

In 1996, ''Destry Rides Again'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

==Plot==
Saloon owner Kent ([[Brian Donlevy]]), the unscrupulous boss of the fictional [[Wild West|Western]] town of Bottleneck, has the town's Sheriff, Keogh, killed when the Sheriff asks one too many questions about a rigged poker game. Kent and "Frenchy" ([[Marlene Dietrich]]), his girlfriend and the dance hall queen, now have a stranglehold over the local cattle ranchers. The crooked town's mayor, Hiram J. Slade ([[Samuel S. Hinds]]), who is in collusion with Kent, appoints the town drunk, Washington Dimsdale ([[Charles Winninger]]), as the new sheriff, assuming that he'll be easy to control and manipulate. But what the mayor doesn't know is that Dimsdale was a deputy under the famous lawman, Tom Destry and is able to call upon the equally formidable Tom Destry, Jr. (James Stewart) to help him make Bottleneck a lawful, respectable town. 

Destry confounds the townsfolk by refusing to strap on a gun in spite of demonstrating that he is an expert marksman. He still carries out the "letter of the law", as deputy Sheriff, and wins over their respect. A final confrontation between Destry and Kent's gang is inevitable, but "Frenchy" is won over by Destry and changes sides. A final gunfight ensues where Frenchy is killed in the [[crossfire]], and the rule of law wins the day.

*[[Marlene Dietrich]] as Frenchy, the saloon singer
*[[James Stewart]] as Thomas Jefferson "Tom" Destry, Jr., the new deputy
*[[Mischa Auer]] as Boris Callahan, the henpecked Russian
*[[Charles Winninger|"Charlie" Winninger]] as "Wash" (Washington Dimsdale), the new sheriff

==Songs==
Marlene Dietrich as Frenchy performs the songs "[[The Boys in the Back Room|See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have]]" and "You've Got That Look", written by [[Frank Loesser]], set to music by [[Frederick Hollander]], which have become classics.

==Production==
Famed Western writer [[Max Brand]] contributed the novel, ''[[Destry Rides Again (novel)|Destry Rides Again]]'', but the film also owes its origins to Brand's serial "Twelve Peers", published in a pulp-magazine. In the original work, Harrison (or "Harry") Destry was not a pacifist. As [[Destry Rides Again (1932 film)|filmed in 1932]], with [[Tom Mix]] in the starring role, the central character differed in that Destry did wear six-guns in that version.

The film was James Stewart's first western (he would not return to the genre until 1950, with ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' and ''[[Winchester 73]]''), and was also notable for a ferocious cat-fight between Marlene Dietrich and Una Merkel, which apparently caused a mild censorship problem at the time of release.<ref>Quirk 2000, pp. 117â€“118.</ref>

According to writer/director [[Peter Bogdanovich]], Marlene Dietrich told him during an aircraft flight that she and James Stewart had an affair during shooting and that she became pregnant and had the baby surreptitiously aborted without telling Stewart.<ref>Riva 1994, pp. 456, 500.</ref>

==Reception==
''Destry Rides Again'' was generally well accepted by the public, as well as critics. It was reviewed by Frank S. Nugent in ''[[The New York Times]],'' who noted that the film did not follow the usual Hollywood type-casting. On Dietrich's role, he characterized, "It's difficult to reconcile Miss Dietrich's Frenchy, the cabaret girl of the Bloody Gulch Saloon, with the posed and posturing Dietrich we last saw in Mr. Lubitsch's 'Angel'." Stewart's contribution was similarly treated, "turning in an easy, likable, pleasantly humored performance."<ref>Nugent, Frank S. [http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B03E3DA113AE532A25753C3A9679D946894D6CF " 'Destry Rides Again' (1939)."] ''The New York Times'', originally published November 30, 1939.
