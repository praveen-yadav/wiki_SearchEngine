Sullivan]].<ref>[[Tim Weiner|Weiner]], ''Enemies'' (2012), p. 196. "Sullivan would become Hoover's field marshal in matters of national security, chief of FBI intelligence, and commandant of COINTELPRO. In that top secret and tightly compartmentalized world, an FBI inside of the FBI, Sullivan served as the executor of Hoover's most clandestine and recondite demands."</ref> Attorney General [[Robert F.

He personally renewed his authorization for the taps on Levison's office, and he approved Hoover's request to tap Levison's home telephone, where King called late at night several times a week."</ref>

==History==
The FBI engaged in political repression almost from the time of the agency's inception in 1908, and antecedents to COINTELPRO operated during the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Harry S. Truman]] administrations. Centralized operations under COINTELPRO officially began in August 1956 with a program designed to "increase factionalism, cause disruption and win defections" inside the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party U.S.A.]] (CPUSA). Tactics included anonymous phone calls, IRS audits, and the creation of documents that would divide American communists internally.<ref>Weiner, ''Enemies'' (2012), p. 195</ref> An October 1956 memo from Hoover reclassified the FBI's ongoing surveillance of black leaders, including it within COINTELPRO, with the justification that the movement was infiltrated by communists.<ref>Weiner, ''Enemies'' (2012), p. 198. "On October 2, 1956, Hoover stepped up the FBI's long-standing surveillance of black civil rights activists. He sent a COINTELPRO memo to the field, warning that the Communist Party was seeking to infiltrate the movement."</ref> When the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) was founded in 1957, the FBI began to monitor and target the group almost immediately, focusing particularly on [[Bayard Rustin]], [[Stanley Levison]], and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]<ref>Weiner, ''Enemies'' (2012), p. 200.</ref>

After the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], King was singled out as a major target for COINTELPRO. Under pressure from Hoover to focus not simply on communist infiltration of the civil rights movement, but on King specifically, Sullivan wrote: "In the light of King's powerful demagogic speech. . . . We must mark him now, if we have not done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this nation from the standpoint of communism, the Negro, and national security."<ref>Weiner, ''Enemies'' (2012), p. 235.</ref> Soon after, the FBI was systematically bugging King's home and his hotel rooms.<ref>Weiner, ''Enemies'' (2012), p. 236. "The bugs got quick results. When King traveled, as he did constantly in the ensuing weeks, to Washington, Milwaukee, Los Angeles, and Honolulu, the Bureau planted hidden microphones in his hotel rooms. The FBI placed a total of eight wiretaps and sixteen bugs on King."</ref>

Amidst the urban unrest of July–August 1967, the FBI began "COINTELPRO–BLACK HATE", which focused on King and the SCLC as well as the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and its leader, [[Stokely Carmichael]]. BLACK HATE established the [[Ghetto Informant Program]] and instructed 23 FBI offices to "disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize the activities of black nationalist hate type organizations".<ref>Weiner, ''Enemies'' (2012), p. 271.</ref> This program coincided with a broader federal effort to prepare military responses for urban riots, and began increased collaboration between the FBI, [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[National Security Agency]], and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].<ref>Weiner, ''Enemies'' (2012), p. 272. "Some 1,500 army intelligence officers in civilian clothing undertook the surveillance of some 100,000 American citizens. Army intelligence shared all their reports over the next three years. The CIA tracked antiwar leaders and black militants who traveled overseas, and it reported back to the FBI. The FBI, in turn, shared thousands of selected files on Americans with army intelligence and the CIA. All three intelligence services sent the names of Americans to the National Security Agency for inclusion on a global watch list; the NSA relayed back to the FBI hundreds of transcripts of intercepted telephone calls to and from suspect Americans."</ref> A particular target was the [[Poor People's Campaign]], a national effort organized by King and the SCLC to occupy Washington, D.C. The FBI monitored and disrupted the campaign on a national level, while using targeted smear tactics locally to undermine support for the march.<ref>McKnight, ''Last Crusade'', pp. 26–28. "By March the Hoover Bureau's campaign against King was virtually on a total war footing. In a March 21 'urgent' teletype, Hoover urged all field offices involved the in the POCAM project to exploit every tactic in the bureau's arsenal of covert political warfare to bring down King and the SCLC."</ref>

COINTELPRO–NEW LEFT was created in April 1968, in the wake of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s assassination in Memphis and [[Columbia University protests of 1968|mass student protests at Columbia University]].<ref>Weiner, ''Enemies'' (2012), p. 274.</ref>

The program ultimately encompassed disruption of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (1961), the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (1964), the [[Nation of Islam]], the [[Black Panther Party]] (1967), and the entire [[New Left]] social/political movement, which included antiwar, community, and religious groups (1968). A later investigation by the Senate's [[Church Committee]] (see below) stated that "COINTELPRO began in 1956, in part because of frustration with Supreme Court rulings limiting the Government's power to proceed overtly against dissident groups..."<ref name= cfr3a>{{cite web

===Program exposed===
The program was successfully kept secret until 1971, when the [[Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI]] burglarized an FBI field office in [[Media, Pennsylvania]], took several dossiers, and exposed the program by passing this information to news agencies. Many news organizations initially refused to publish the information. Within the year, Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] declared that the centralized COINTELPRO was over, and that all future [[counterintelligence]] operations would be handled on a case-by-case basis.<ref>[http://www.albionmonitor.net/9905a/jbcointelpro.html A Short History of FBI COINTELPRO]. Retrieved July 13, 2007. {{Wayback|url=http://www.albionmonitor.net/9905a/jbcointelpro.html|date =20070928104133}}</ref><ref>Weiner, ''Enemies'' (2012), p. 293</ref>

Further documents were revealed in the course of separate lawsuits filed against the FBI by [[NBC]] correspondent Carl Stern, the Socialist Workers Party, and a number of other groups. A major investigation was launched in 1976 by the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities of the United States Senate, commonly referred to as the "[[Church Committee]]" for its chairman, Senator [[Frank Church]] of [[Idaho]]. However, many documents are speculated to have remained unreleased, and many released documents have been partly, or entirely, redacted.

Since the conclusion of centralized COINTELPRO operations in 1971, FBI counterintelligence operations have been handled on a "case-by-case basis"; however allegations of improper political repression continue.<ref>http://www.publiceye.org/liberty/RepressionTOC.html</ref><ref name="publiceye.org">Berlet, Chip.

Conspiracy Theories for Fun, Not for False Prophets”], 1998, Political Research Associates</ref>

In the Final Report of the Select Committee, COINTELPRO was castigated in no uncertain terms:

:The Committee finds that the domestic activities of the intelligence community at times violated specific statutory prohibitions and infringed the constitutional rights of American citizens. The legal questions involved in intelligence programs were often not considered. On other occasions, they were intentionally disregarded in the belief that because the programs served the "national security" the law did not apply. While intelligence officers on occasion failed to disclose to their superiors programs which were illegal or of questionable legality, the Committee finds that the most serious breaches of duty were those of senior officials, who were responsible for controlling intelligence activities and generally failed to assure compliance with the law.<ref name="church-final-report"/>

:Many of the techniques used would be intolerable in a democratic society even if all of the targets had been involved in violent activity, but COINTELPRO went far beyond that...the Bureau conducted a sophisticated vigilante operation aimed squarely at preventing the exercise of First Amendment rights of speech and association, on the theory that preventing the growth of dangerous groups and the propagation of dangerous ideas would protect the national security and deter violence.<ref name= cfr3a/>

The Church Committee documented a history of use of the agency for purposes of [[political repression]] as far back as [[World War I]], through the 1920s, when agents were charged with rounding up "anarchists and revolutionaries" for deportation, and then building from 1936 through 1976.

==Intended effects==
The intended effect of the FBI's COINTELPRO was to "expose, disrupt, misdirect, or otherwise neutralize" groups that the FBI believed were "subversive"<ref>{{cite book|author=Deflam, Mathieu|title=Surveillance and governance: crime control and beyond|publisher=Emerald Publishing Group|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7623-1416-4|pages=182|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zBgDPupR_lMC&pg=PA182}}</ref> by instructing FBI field operatives to:<ref>{{cite book|author=Deflam, Mathieu|title=Surveillance and governance: crime control and beyond|publisher=Emerald Publishing Group|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7623-1416-4|pages=184–185|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zBgDPupR_lMC&pg=PA184}}</ref>
# create a negative public image for target groups (e.g. by surveiling activists, and then releasing negative personal information to the public)
# break down internal organization 
# create dissension between groups 
# restrict access to public resources
# restrict the ability to organize protests
# restrict the ability of individuals to participate in group activities

==Range of targets==
In an interview with the [[BBC]]'s [[Andrew Marr]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] professor of linguistics and political activist [[Noam Chomsky]] spoke about the purpose and the targets of COINTELPRO saying, "COINTELPRO was a program of subversion carried out not by a couple of petty crooks but by the national political police, the FBI, under four administrations... by the time it got through, I won't run through the whole story, it was aimed at the entire new left, at the women's movement, at the whole black movement, it was extremely broad. Its actions went as far as political assassination."<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG24vg8js4o Video] at [[YouTube]]</ref>
According to the Church Committee:

:While the declared purposes of these programs were to protect the "national security" or prevent violence, Bureau witnesses admit that many of the targets were nonviolent and most had no connections with a foreign power. Indeed, nonviolent organizations and individuals were targeted because the Bureau believed they represented a "potential" for violence -- and nonviolent citizens who were against the war in Vietnam were targeted because they gave "aid and comfort" to violent demonstrators by lending respectability to their cause.

:The imprecision of the targeting is demonstrated by the inability of the Bureau to define the subjects of the programs. The Black Nationalist program, according to its supervisor, included "a great number of organizations that you might not today characterize as black nationalist but which were in fact primarily black." Thus, the nonviolent Southern Christian Leadership Conference was labeled as a Black Nationalist-"Hate Group."

:Furthermore, the actual targets were chosen from a far broader group than the titles of the programs would imply. The CPUSA program targeted not only Communist Party members but also sponsors of the [[National Committee to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee]] and civil rights leaders allegedly under Communist influence or deemed to be not sufficiently "anti-Communist". The Socialist Workers Party program included non-SWP sponsors of anti-war demonstrations which were cosponsored by the SWP or the Young Socialist Alliance, its youth group. The Black Nationalist program targeted a range of organizations from the Panthers to SNCC to the peaceful Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and included every Black Student Union and many other black student groups. New Left targets ranged from the SDS to the InterUniversity Committee for Debate on Foreign Policy, from [[Antioch College]] ("vanguard of the New Left") to the New Mexico Free University and other "alternate" schools, and from underground newspapers to students' protesting university censorship of a student publication by carrying signs with four-letter words on them.

Examples of surveillance, spanning all presidents from FDR to Nixon, both legal and illegal, contained in the Church Committee report:<ref>[http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIa.htm Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans, Final Report of the Senate Committee to Study Governmental Operations with respect to Intelligence Activities]</ref>

* [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] asked the FBI to put in its files the names of citizens sending telegrams to the White House opposing his "national defense" policy and supporting Col. [[Charles Lindbergh]].
* [[Harry S Truman|President Truman]] received inside information on a former Roosevelt aide's efforts to influence his appointments, labor union negotiating plans, and the publishing plans of journalists.
* [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] received reports on purely political and social contacts with foreign officials by [[Bernard Baruch]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]].
* The [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] had the FBI wiretap a congressional staff member, three executive officials, a lobbyist, and a Washington law firm.  [[US Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] received the fruits of an FBI wire tap on [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and an electronic listening device targeting a congressman, both of which yielded information of a political nature.
* [[Lyndon Johnson|President Johnson]] asked the FBI to conduct "name checks" of his critics and members of the staff of his 1964 opponent, Senator [[Barry Goldwater]].  He also requested purely political intelligence on his critics in the Senate, and received extensive intelligence reports on political activity at the [[1964 Democratic Convention]] from FBI electronic surveillance.
* [[Richard M. Nixon|President Nixon]] authorized a program of wiretaps which produced for the White House purely political or personal information unrelated to national security, including information about a Supreme Court Justice.

The COINTELPRO documents show numerous cases of the FBI's intentions to prevent and disrupt protests against the [[Vietnam War]].  Many techniques were used to accomplish this task.  "These included promoting splits among antiwar forces, encouraging [[red-baiting]] of socialists, and pushing violent confrontations as an alternative to massive, peaceful demonstrations."  One 1966 COINTELPRO operation attempted to redirect the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] from their pledge of support for the antiwar movement.<ref>Blackstock, Nelson. ''COINTELPRO: The FBI's Secret War on Political Freedom'', Pathfinder, New York. 1975. p. 111.</ref>  

The FBI claims that it no longer undertakes COINTELPRO or COINTELPRO-like operations.   However, critics claim that agency programs in the spirit of COINTELPRO targeted groups such as the [[Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador]],<ref>Gelbspan, Ross.

According to attorney Brian Glick in his book ''War at Home'', the FBI used four main methods during COINTELPRO:
# Infiltration: Agents and informers did not merely spy on political activists. Their main purpose was to discredit and disrupt. Their very presence served to undermine trust and scare off potential supporters. The FBI and police exploited this fear to smear genuine activists as agents.
# Psychological warfare: The FBI and police used myriad "dirty tricks" to undermine progressive movements. They planted false media stories and published bogus leaflets and other publications in the name of targeted groups. They forged correspondence, sent anonymous letters, and made anonymous telephone calls. They spread misinformation about meetings and events, set up pseudo movement groups run by government agents, and manipulated or strong-armed parents, employers, landlords, school officials and others to cause trouble for activists. They used [[bad-jacketing]] to create suspicion about targeted activists, some times with lethal consequences.<ref>{{Citation

The FBI specifically developed tactics intended to heighten tension and hostility between various factions in the black militancy movement, for example between the Black Panthers, the US Organization and the Blackstone Rangers. This resulted in numerous deaths, among which were San Diego Black Panther Party members John Huggins, Bunchy Carter and Sylvester Bell.<ref name="icdc.com"/>

The FBI also conspired with the police departments of many U.S. cities (San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, Philadelphia, Chicago) to encourage repeated raids on Black Panther homes—often with little or no evidence of violations of federal, state, or local laws—which resulted directly in the police killing of many members of the Black Panther Party, most notably Chicago Black Panther Party Chairman [[Fred Hampton]] on December 4, 1969.<ref name="icdc.com"/><ref name="FBI Secrets 1995"/><ref name="itsabouttimebpp.com"/><ref>Brown, Elaine.

In 1969 the FBI special agent in San Francisco wrote Hoover that his investigation of the Black Panther Party (BPP) revealed that in his city, at least, the Panthers were primarily feeding breakfast to children. Hoover fired back a memo implying the career ambitions of the agent were directly related to his supplying evidence to support Hoover's view that the BPP was "a violence-prone organization seeking to overthrow the Government by revolutionary means".<ref>FBI document, 27 May 1969, Director FBI to SAC San Francisco.

Hoover was willing to use false claims to attack his political enemies.

In one particularly controversial 1965 incident, civil rights worker [[Viola Liuzzo]] was murdered by [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen who gave chase and fired shots into her car after noticing that her passenger was a young black man; one of the Klansmen was acknowledged FBI informant Gary Thomas Rowe.<ref name="The Informant">Gary May, The Informant: The FBI, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Murder of Viola Luzzo, Yale University Press, 2005.</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/30/AR2005063001422_pf.html | work=The [[Washington Post]] | title=Jonathan Yardley | accessdate=April 30, 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKqS0VOK |archivedate = 2010-11-18}}</ref> Rumors were spread that Liuzzo was a member of the [[Communist Party]] and abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with [[African Americans]] involved in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–68)|Civil Rights Movement]].<ref name="uua">{{cite web |url=http://www25-temp.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/violaliuzzo.html |title=Viola Liuzzo |author=Joanne Giannino |work=Dictionary of Unitarian & Universalist Biography |accessdate=2008-09-29|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKqSe8XJ |archivedate = 2010-11-18}}</ref><ref name="urlRearview Mirror">{{cite web |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/history/viola/viola.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990427180231/http://www.detroitnews.com/history/viola/viola.htm |archivedate=1999-04-27 |title=The Detroit housewife who moved a nation toward racial justice |author=Kay Houston |work= [[The Detroit News]], Rearview Mirror }}</ref> FBI records show that [[J.

Hoover ordered preemptive action "to pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them before they exercise their potential for violence."<ref name="WRH"/>

==Illegal surveillance==

The final report of the [[Church Committee]] concluded:

:Too many people have been spied upon by too many Government agencies and too much information has been collected. The Government has often undertaken the secret surveillance of citizens on the basis of their political beliefs, even when those beliefs posed no threat of violence or illegal acts on behalf of a hostile foreign power. The Government, operating primarily through secret informants, but also using other intrusive techniques such as wiretaps, microphone "bugs", surreptitious mail opening, and break-ins, has swept in vast amounts of information about the personal lives, views, and associations of [[American citizen]]s. Investigations of groups deemed potentially dangerous -- and even of groups suspected of associating with potentially dangerous organizations -- have continued for decades, despite the fact that those groups did not engage in unlawful activity.

:Groups and individuals have been harassed and disrupted because of their political views and their lifestyles. Investigations have been based upon vague standards whose breadth made excessive collection inevitable. Unsavory and vicious tactics have been employed -- including anonymous attempts to break up marriages, disrupt meetings, ostracize persons from their professions, and provoke target groups into rivalries that might result in deaths. Intelligence agencies have served the political and personal objectives of presidents and other high officials. While the agencies often committed excesses in response to pressure from high officials in the Executive branch and Congress, they also occasionally initiated improper activities and then concealed them from officials whom they had a duty to inform.

:Governmental officials -- including those whose principal duty is to enforce the law --have violated or ignored the law over long periods of time and have advocated and defended their right to break the law.

:The Constitutional system of checks and balances has not adequately controlled intelligence activities. Until recently the Executive branch has neither delineated the scope of permissible activities nor established procedures for supervising intelligence agencies. Congress has failed to exercise sufficient oversight, seldom questioning the use to which its appropriations were being put. Most domestic intelligence issues have not reached the courts, and in those cases when they have reached the courts, the judiciary has been reluctant to grapple with them.<ref name = "Church">{{cite web

==Post-COINTELPRO operations==
While COINTELPRO was officially terminated in April 1971, critics allege that continuing FBI actions indicate that post-COINTELPRO reforms did not succeed in ending COINTELPRO tactics.<ref>David Cunningham. ''There's Something Happening Here: The New Left, the Klan, and FBI.'' University of California Press, 2005: "However, strong suspicions lingered that the program's tactics were sustained on a less formal basis—suspicions sometimes furthered by agents themselves, who periodically claimed that counterintelligence activities were continuing, though in a manner undocumented within Bureau files."; Hobson v. Brennan, 646&nbsp;F.Supp. 884 (D.D.C.,1986)</ref><ref>Bud Schultz, Ruth Schultz. ''The Price of Dissent: Testimonies to Political Repression in America''. University of California Press, 2001: "Although the FBI officially discontinued COINTELPRO immediately after the Pennsylvania disclosures "for security reasons," when pressed by the Senate committee, the bureau acknowledged two new instances of "Cointelpro-type" operations.  The committee was left to discover a third, apparently illegal operation on its own."</ref><ref>Athan G. Theoharis, et al. ''The FBI: A Comprehensive Reference Guide.'' Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999: "More recent controversies have focused on the adequacy of recent restrictions on the Bureau's domestic intelligence operations.  Disclosures of the 1970s that FBI agents continued to conduct break-ins, and of the 1980s that the FBI targeted CISPES, again brought forth accusations of FBI abuses of power — and raised questions of whether reforms of the 1970s had successfully exorcised the ghost of FBI Director Hoover."</ref>  Documents released under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] show that the FBI tracked the late [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning journalist and author [[David Halberstam]] for more than two decades.<ref>[[The Associated Press]], {{cite news |title=FBI tracked journalist for over 20 years |work=Toronto Star |date=November 7, 2008 |url=http://www.thestar.com/News/World/article/533203 |accessdate=November 23, 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gHBk0Wtol8FN8SMpFQIYL5CPxXfwD94AF32O0]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref>  

“Counterterrorism” guidelines implemented during the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] have been described as allowing a return to COINTELPRO tactics.<ref>Bud Schultz, Ruth Schultz. ''The Price of Dissent: Testimonies to Political Repression in America''. University of California Press, 2001: "The problem persists after Hoover…."The record before this court," Federal Magistrate Joan Lefkow stated in 1991, "shows that despite regulations, orders and consent decrees prohibiting such activities, the FBI had continued to collect information concerning only the exercise of free speech."</ref>  Some radical groups accuse factional opponents of being FBI informants or assume the FBI is infiltrating the movement.<ref>Mike Mosedale, "Bury My Heart," City Pages, Volume 21 - Issue 1002 - Cover Story - February 16, 2000</ref>  

The FBI improperly opened investigations of American activist groups, even though they were planning nothing more than peaceful civil disobedience, according to a report by the [[inspector general]] (IG) of the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].  The review by the inspector general was launched in response to complaints by civil liberties groups and members of Congress.  The FBI improperly monitored groups including the [[Thomas Merton Center (Pittsburgh)|Thomas Merton Center]], a [[Pittsburgh]]-based peace group, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA), and [[Greenpeace USA]], an [[environmental activism]] organization.  Also, activists affiliated with Greenpeace were improperly put on a [[No Fly List|terrorist watch list]], even though they were planning no violence or illegal acitivities.  The IG report found the "troubling" FBI practices between 2001 and 2006.  In some cases, the FBI conducted investigations of people affiliated with activist groups for "factually weak" reasons.  Also, the FBI extended investigations of some of the groups "without adequate basis" and improperly kept information about activist groups in its files.  The IG report also found that FBI Director [[Robert Mueller III]] provided inaccurate congressional testimony about one of the investigations, but this inaccuracy may have been due to his relying on what FBI officials told him.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=The San Jose Mercury News |date=September 20, 2010 |title=FBI Probes of Groups Were Improper, Justice Department Says |url= http://www.mercurynews.com/california/ci_16128591?nclick_check=1 }} also reported at [http://www.democracynow.org/2010/9/21/headlines#2 democracynow.org]</ref>  

Several authors have accused the FBI of continuing to deploy COINTELPRO-like tactics against radical groups after the official COINTELPRO operations were ended.  Several authors have suggested the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) has been a target of such operations.  
A few authors go further and allege that the federal government intended to acquire [[uranium]] deposits on the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] tribe's reservation land, and that this motivated a larger government conspiracy against [[American Indian Movement|AIM]] activists on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation|Pine Ridge]] reservation.<ref name="churchill-vanderwall-1990a"/><ref name="churchill-vanderwall-1988a"/><ref>Weyler, Rex. ''Blood of the Land: The Government and Corporate War Against First Nations''.</ref><ref>Matthiessen, Peter, ''In the Spirit of Crazy Horse'', 1980, Viking.</ref><ref name="conculture">Woidat, Caroline M. ''The Truth Is on the Reservation: American Indians and Conspiracy Culture'', ''The Journal of American Culture'' 29 (4), 2006. Pages 454–467</ref>  Others believe COINTELPRO continues and similar actions are being taken against [[activist]] groups.<ref name="conculture"/><ref>[[Jason McQuinn|McQuinn, Jason]]. "Conspiracy Theory vs Alternative Journalism", ''[[Alternative Press Review]]'', Vol. 2, No. 3, Winter 1996</ref><ref>Horowitz, David. "Johnnie's Other O.J.", FrontPageMagazine.com. September 1, 1997.</ref>  

Caroline Woidat argued that with respect to Native Americans, COINTELPRO should be understood within a historical context in which "Native Americans have been viewed and have viewed the world themselves through the lens of [[conspiracy theory]]."<ref>Woidat, Caroline M. "The Truth Is on the Reservation: American Indians and Conspiracy Culture", ''The Journal of American Culture'' 29 (4), 2006. pp. 454–467.</ref>  

Other authors note that while some conspiracy theories related to COINTELPRO are unfounded, the issue of ongoing government surveillance and repression is real.<ref name="publiceye.org"/><ref>Berlet, Chip; and Matthew N. Lyons. 1998, [http://www.publiceye.org/liberty/RepressionTOC.html "One key to litigating against government prosecution of dissidents: Understanding the underlying assumptions"], Parts 1 and 2, ''Police Misconduct and Civil Rights Law Report'' (West Group), 5 (13), (January–February): 145–153; and 5 (14), (March–April): 157–162.</ref>
