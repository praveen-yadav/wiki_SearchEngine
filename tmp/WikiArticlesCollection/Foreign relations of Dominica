{{Politics of Dominica}}
Like its [[Eastern Caribbean]] neighbors, the main priority of [[Dominica]]'s foreign relations is economic development. The country maintains missions in Washington, New York, London, and Brussels and is represented jointly with other [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS) members in [[Canada]]. Dominica is also a member of the [[Caribbean Development Bank]] (CDB), and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It became a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) in 1978 and of the [[World Bank]] and [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in 1979.

As a member of [[CARICOM]], in July 1994 Dominica strongly backed efforts by the United States to implement [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 940]], designed to facilitate the departure of [[Haiti]]'s de facto authorities from power. The country agreed to contribute personnel to the multinational force, which restored the democratically elected government of Haiti in October 1994.

In May 1997, Prime Minister [[Edison James|James]] joined 14 other Caribbean leaders, and President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], during the first-ever U.S.-regional summit in [[Bridgetown, Barbados]]. The summit strengthened the basis for regional cooperation on justice and counternarcotics issues, finance and development, and trade. Dominica previously maintained official relations with the [[Republic of China]] (commonly known as "Taiwan") instead of the [[People's Republic of China]], but on 23 March 2004, a joint communique was signed in Beijing, paving the way for diplomatic recognition of the People's Republic. Beijing responded to Dominica's severing relations with the Republic of China by giving them a $12 million aid package, which includes $6 million in [[budget support]] for the year 2004 and $1 million annually for six years.

Dominica is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).
