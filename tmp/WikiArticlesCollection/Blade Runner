'''''Blade Runner''''' is a 1982 American [[dystopia]]n [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[thriller film]] directed by [[Ridley Scott]] and starring [[Harrison Ford]], [[Rutger Hauer]], [[Sean Young]] and [[Edward James Olmos]]. The screenplay, written by [[Hampton Fancher]] and [[David Peoples]], is loosely based on the novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]].

The film depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in November 2019 in which genetically engineered organic robots called [[replicant]]s—visually indistinguishable from adult humans—are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation as well as by other "mega-corporations" around the world. Their use on Earth is banned and replicants are exclusively used for dangerous, menial or leisure work on [[Space colonization|off-world colonies]]. Replicants who defy the ban and return to Earth are hunted down and "retired" by police special operatives known as "Blade Runners". The plot focuses on a desperate group of recently escaped replicants hiding in Los Angeles and the burnt-out expert Blade Runner, [[Rick Deckard]] (Harrison Ford), who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment to hunt them down.

''Blade Runner'' initially polarized critics: some were displeased with the pacing, while others enjoyed its thematic complexity. The film performed poorly in North American theaters but has since become a [[cult film]].<ref>Sammon, pp. xvi–xviii</ref> It has been hailed for its production design, depicting a "[[retrofitted]]" future,<ref>Bukatman, p. 21; Sammon, p. 79</ref> and remains a leading example of the [[neo-noir]] genre.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.kentuckypress.com/live/title_detail.php?titleid=1113 | title= The Philosophy of Neo-Noir | publisher=University Press of Kentucky | accessdate=July 27, 2011 | last=Conard | first=Mark T. | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-8131-2422-3}}</ref> It brought the work of Philip K.

Seven versions of the film have been shown for various markets as a result of controversial changes made by film executives. A rushed ''[[Director's Cut]]'' was released in 1992 after a strong response to [[workprint]] screenings. This, in conjunction with its popularity as a video rental, made it one of the first films released on DVD, resulting in a basic disc with mediocre video and audio quality.<ref name="hunt">{{citation | last1=Hunt | first1=Bill | date=December 12, 2007 | url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/site_archive/reviewshd/bladerunnerfinalallver01.html | title=Blade Runner: The Final Cut – All Versions | publisher=The Digital Bits, Inc. | accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> In 2007, [[Warner Bros.]] released ''[[Versions of Blade Runner#The Final Cut (2007)|The Final Cut]]'', a 25th anniversary digitally remastered version by Scott in select theaters, and subsequently on DVD, [[HD DVD]], and [[Blu-ray Disc]].<ref name="thedigitalbits">{{citation | url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/site_archive/articles/br2007/announce.html | title=Blade Runner: The Final Cut | publisher=The Digital Bits, Inc. | date=July 26, 2007 | accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>

==Plot==
{{Hatnote|'''Note''': There are several [[versions of Blade Runner|versions of ''Blade Runner'']].}}
In Los Angeles, November 2019, retired police officer [[Rick Deckard]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) is detained by officer [[Characters in Blade Runner#Gaff|Gaff]] ([[Edward James Olmos]]) and brought to meet with his former supervisor, [[Characters in Blade Runner#Harry Bryant|Bryant]] ([[M. Emmet Walsh]]). Deckard, whose job as a "Blade Runner" was to track down bioengineered beings known as [[replicant]]s and "retire" (euphemism for the termination of replicants) them, is told by Bryant that several have come to Earth illegally; as Tyrell Corporation Nexus-6 models, they have only a four-year lifespan and may have come to Earth to try to extend their lives.

Deckard watches a video of a Blade Runner named [[Characters in Blade Runner#Holden|Holden]] ([[Morgan Paull]]) administering a "Voight-Kampff" test designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their [[empathy|empathic]] response to questions. The subject of the test, [[Characters in Blade Runner#Leon Kowalski|Leon]] ([[Brion James]]), shoots Holden after Holden asks about Leon's mother. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and three other replicants—[[Characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]] ([[Rutger Hauer]]), [[Characters in Blade Runner#Zhora|Zhora]] ([[Joanna Cassidy]]) and [[Characters in Blade Runner#Pris|Pris]] ([[Daryl Hannah]]). Deckard refuses, but after Bryant ambiguously threatens him, Deckard reluctantly agrees.

Deckard is sent to the Tyrell Corporation to ensure that the test works on Nexus-6 models. There he discovers that [[Characters in Blade Runner#Dr. Eldon Tyrell|Tyrell's]] ([[Joe Turkel]]) assistant [[Characters in Blade Runner#Rachael|Rachael]] ([[Sean Young]]) is an experimental replicant who believes herself to be human. Rachael's consciousness has been enhanced with false memories to provide an "emotional cushion" and, as a result, a more extensive test is required to determine whether she is a replicant.

Roy and Leon go to the eye-manufacturing laboratory of [[Characters in Blade Runner#Hannibal Chew|Chew]] ([[James Hong]]) to try to find a way to meet with Tyrell. He is unable to provide them with information, but in fear for his life, he divulges the identity of [[Characters in Blade Runner#J.F. Sebastian|J.F. Sebastian]] ([[William Sanderson]]), a gifted designer who works closely with Tyrell.

Rachael visits Deckard at his apartment to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo, but after Deckard tells her that her memories are only implants taken from a real person, she drops the photograph and leaves his apartment in tears. Pris gains the confidence of Sebastian at his apartment, where he lives with manufactured companions.

While searching Leon's apartment, Deckard finds a photo of Zhora and a synthetic [[Scale (anatomy)|snake scale]] that leads him to a strip club where Zhora works. Deckard retires Zhora and shortly after is told by Bryant to add Rachael to his list of retirements because she has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation headquarters. Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd but is attacked by Leon. Rachael kills Leon using Deckard's gun, and the two return to Deckard's apartment, where he promises not to hunt her. Later they share an intimate moment; Rachael then tries to leave, but Deckard physically restrains her.

Arriving at Sebastian's apartment, Roy tells Pris the others are dead. Sympathetic to their plight, Sebastian reveals that because of a genetic disorder that accelerates his aging, his life will also be cut short. Sebastian and Roy gain entrance into Tyrell's secure penthouse, where Roy demands more life from his maker. Tyrell tells him that it is impossible. Roy confesses his guilt that he has done "questionable things" which Tyrell dismisses, praising Roy's advanced design and his accomplishments. Roy responds with "nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you into heaven for" and kisses Tyrell, then kills him. Sebastian runs for the elevator followed by Roy, who then rides the elevator down alone.

Upon entering Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but manages to kill her just as Roy returns. Roy fights Deckard without using his full strength against him, instead chasing him through the building and arriving on the roof. In an attempt to escape, Deckard tries to jump to another roof, but ends up hanging from the rooftop. Just as he is about to fall, Roy saves him. As his life runs out, Roy delivers [[Tears in rain soliloquy|a monologue]] about how his memories are about to be lost. Then he dies in front of Deckard, who watches silently. Gaff arrives and, referring to Rachael, shouts to Deckard, "It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?" Deckard returns to his apartment to find Rachael sleeping in his bed; as they leave, Deckard finds a small tin-foil unicorn, a calling card left by his [[origami]]-making partner Gaff. Depending on the version, Deckard and Rachael either leave the apartment block to an uncertain future, or drive through an idyllic pastoral landscape.

===Spinner===
[[File:Blade Runner Spinners.png|thumb|320px|right|alt=A screenshot from the film shows a line of police vehicles with flashing lights flying high above a smog-covered cityscape. Below them several small pinpoints of light from aircraft-avoidance lights on the tops of towers are all that can be seen of the city|Police spinners flying above Los Angeles.]]

"Spinner" is the generic term for the fictional flying cars used in the film. A Spinner can be driven as a ground-based vehicle, and take off vertically, hover, and cruise using [[jet engine|jet propulsion]] much like [[VTOL|Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL)]] aircraft. They are used extensively by the police to patrol and survey the population, and it is clear that despite restrictions wealthy people can acquire spinner licenses.<ref>Sammon, pp. 79–80</ref> The vehicle was conceived and designed by [[Syd Mead]] who described the spinner as an "aerodyne"—a vehicle which directs air downward to create [[lift (force)|lift]], though press kits for the film stated that the spinner was propelled by three engines: "conventional [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]], jet, and [[anti-gravity]]"<ref name=SJPSTop40>{{citation|title=The top 40 cars from feature films: 30.

The Voight-Kampff machine (or device) is a fictional interrogation tool, originating in the book where it is spelled Voigt-Kampff. The Voight-Kampff is a [[polygraph]]-like machine used by Blade Runners to assist in the testing of an individual to determine if they are a replicant. It measures bodily functions such as respiration, blush response, heart rate, and eye movement in response to emotionally provocative questions.<ref>Sammon, pp. 106–107</ref> In the film two replicants take the test, Leon and Rachael, and Deckard tells Tyrell that it usually takes 20 to 30 cross-referenced questions to distinguish a replicant; in contrast with the book, where it is stated it only takes "six or seven" questions to make a determination. In the film it takes more than one hundred questions to determine if Rachael is a replicant.

==Casting and characters {{anchor|Cast}}==
{{Main|List of Blade Runner characters}}

=== Cast ===
Casting the film proved troublesome, particularly for the lead role of Deckard. Screenwriter Hampton Fancher envisioned [[Robert Mitchum]] as Deckard and wrote the character's dialogue with Mitchum in mind.<ref name="DangerousDays">{{Citation|title=Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner|format=''Blade Runner: The Final Cut'' DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros.]]|year=2007}}</ref> Director Ridley Scott and the film's producers "spent months" meeting and discussing the role with [[Dustin Hoffman]], who eventually departed over differences in vision.<ref name="DangerousDays" /> Harrison Ford was ultimately chosen for several reasons, including his performance in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, Ford's interest in the story of ''Blade Runner'', and discussions with [[Steven Spielberg]] who was finishing ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' at the time and strongly praised Ford's work in the film.<ref name="DangerousDays" /> According to production documents, a long list of actors was considered for the role, including [[Gene Hackman]], [[Sean Connery]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Al Pacino]], and [[Burt Reynolds]].<ref name="DangerousDays" />

Coming off the success of ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' (1977), ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), Ford was looking for a role with dramatic depth. After Steven Spielberg praised Ford, he was hired for ''Blade Runner''. In 1992, Ford revealed, "''Blade Runner'' is not one of my favorite films. I tangled with Ridley."<ref>Sammon, p. 211</ref> Apart from friction with the director, Ford also disliked the voiceovers: "When we started shooting it had been tacitly agreed that the version of the film that we had agreed upon was the version without voiceover narration. It was a f**king {{sic}}<!--This is a direct quote from source, and is correct as written with two asterisks.--> nightmare. I thought that the film had worked without the narration. But now I was stuck re-creating that narration. And I was obliged to do the voiceovers for people that did not represent the director's interests."<ref>{{citation

In 2006 Scott was asked "Who's the biggest pain in the arse you've ever worked with?", he replied: "It's got to be Harrison&nbsp;... he'll forgive me because now I get on with him. Now he's become charming. But he knows a lot, that's the problem. When we worked together it was my first film up and I was the new kid on the block. But we made a good movie."<ref>{{citation|first=Rob|last=Carnevale|title=Getting Direct With Directors&nbsp;...

"Harrison's fully on board", said Scott.<ref>{{citation | last=Smith|first=Neil | title=The Total Film Interview | newspaper=Total Film | date=Summer 2007 | issue=130}}</ref>

The film also used a number of then lesser-known actors such as [[Daryl Hannah]] and [[Sean Young]].<ref>Sammon, pp. 92–93</ref> Casting their roles of Pris and Rachael was also challenging, and a lengthy series of screen tests, with [[Morgan Paull]] playing the role of Deckard, were filmed with numerous actresses auditioning. Paull was cast as Deckard's fellow bounty hunter Holden based on his performances in the tests.<ref name="DangerousDays" /> Among the actresses tested for the role of Rachael was [[Nina Axelrod]], who was Paull's recommendation.<ref name="DangerousDays" /> [[Stacey Nelkin]] tried out for Pris but was instead given another role in the film, which was ultimately cut before filming.<ref name="DangerousDays" /> Both Axelrod's and Nelkin's screen tests are featured in the 2007 documentary ''Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner''. Young was picked to play Rachael, Tyrell's assistant, a replicant with memories that belonged to Tyrell's niece. Hannah played Pris, a "basic pleasure model" replicant, and the development of her relationship with Roy Batty is shown as a symbol of the replicants' underlying humanity.

One role that was not difficult to cast was [[Rutger Hauer]] as Roy Batty, the violent yet thoughtful leader of the replicants.<ref name="Ebert">{{citation | last=Ebert | first=Roger | date=September 11, 1992 | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920911/REVIEWS/209110301/1023 | title=Blade Runner: Director's Cut | publisher=rogerebert.com | accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> Scott cast Hauer without having met him, based solely on Hauer's performances in [[Paul Verhoeven]]'s movies Scott had seen (''[[Keetje Tippel|Katie Tippel]]'', ''[[Soldier of Orange]]'' and ''[[Turkish Delight (film)|Turkish Delight]]'').<ref name="DangerousDays" /> Hauer's portrayal of Batty was regarded by Philip K. Dick as, "the perfect Batty—cold, [[Aryan race|Aryan]], flawless".<ref name="FutureNoir-p284" /> Of the many films Hauer has done, ''Blade Runner'' is his favorite. As he explained in a live chat in 2001,<!-- This quote is Literally what is said on the website. ''Please do not correct it''. --> "BLADE RUNNER needs no explanation. It just IZZ {{sic}}. All of the best. There is nothing like it. To be part of a real MASTERPIECE which changed the world's thinking.

[[Edward James Olmos]] played Gaff and used his diverse ethnic background, and some in-depth personal research, to help create the fictional "[[Cityspeak]]" language his character uses in the film.<ref name="FutureNoir-p115">Sammon, pp. 115–116</ref> His initial addresses to Deckard at the noodle bar is partly in Hungarian and means, "Horse dick! No way. You are the Blade ... Blade Runner."<ref name="FutureNoir-p115" /> [[M. Emmet Walsh]] played the role of Captain Bryant, a hard-drinking, sleazy, and underhanded police veteran typical of the [[film noir]] genre. [[Joe Turkel]] was Dr. Eldon Tyrell, a corporate mogul who built an empire on genetically manipulated humanoid slaves. [[William Sanderson]] was cast as J. F. Sebastian, a quiet and lonely genius who provides a compassionate yet compliant portrait of humanity. J.&nbsp;F. sympathizes with the replicants, whom he sees as companions,<ref>Bukatman, p. 72</ref> and shares their shorter lifespan because he has "Methuselah Syndrome", a genetic disease resembling [[progeria]] that causes faster aging.<ref>Sammon, p. 170</ref> [[Joe Pantoliano]] was considered for the role.<ref>{{citation | author=Brinkley, Aaron | title=A Chat With William Sanderson | url=http://media.bladezone.com/contents/film/interviews/bill-sanderson | work=BladeZone – The Online Blade Runner Fan Club | date=October 5, 2000 | accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>

[[Brion James]] played Leon Kowalski, a replicant masquerading as a waste disposal engineer; he shoots a Blade Runner to escape, establishing the physical threat the replicants pose to their would-be captors. [[Joanna Cassidy]] was a special-ops, undercover and assassin replicant model called Zhora. Cassidy portrays a strong female who has seen the worst humanity has to offer. [[Morgan Paull]] plays Holden, the Blade Runner initially assigned to the case. [[James Hong]] as Hannibal Chew, an elderly Asian geneticist specializing in synthetic eyes. [[Hy Pyke]] conveyed the sleazy bar owner Taffey Lewis with ease and in a single take, something almost unheard-of with Scott whose drive for perfection resulted at times in double-digit takes.<ref>Sammon, p. 150</ref>

{{Anchor|Writing|Development}}
Interest in adapting [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' developed shortly after its 1968 publication. Director [[Martin Scorsese]] was interested in filming the novel, but never [[option (finance)|optioned]] it.<ref>Bukatman, p. 13; Sammon, p. 23</ref> Producer [[Herb Jaffe]] optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb's son Robert: "Jaffe's screenplay was so terribly done&nbsp;... Robert flew down to Santa Ana to speak with me about the project. And the first thing I said to him when he got off the plane was, 'Shall I beat you up here at the airport, or shall I beat you up back at my apartment?' "<ref>Dick quoted in Sammon, p. 23</ref>

The screenplay by [[Hampton Fancher]]<!--Not titled "Android" initially&nbsp;– See Sammon, pp. 32 and 38 for explanation--> was optioned in 1977.<ref>Sammon, pp. 23–30</ref> Producer [[Michael Deeley]] became interested in Fancher's draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to film it. Scott had previously declined the project, but after leaving the slow production of ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'', wanted a faster-paced project to take his mind off his older brother's recent death.<ref>Sammon, pp. 43–49</ref> He joined the project on February 21, 1980, and managed to push up the promised [[Filmways]] financing from US$13&nbsp;million to $15&nbsp;million. Fancher's script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and faith, which had featured heavily in the novel, and Scott wanted changes. Fancher found a cinema treatment by [[William S. Burroughs]] for [[Alan E. Nourse]]'s novel ''[[The Bladerunner]]'' (1974), titled ''[[Blade Runner (a movie)]]''.{{#tag:ref|Some editions of Nourse's novel use the two-word spacing ''Blade Runner'', as does the Burroughs book.|group=nb}} Scott liked the name, so Deeley obtained the rights to the titles. Eventually he hired [[David Peoples]] to rewrite the script and Fancher left the job over the issue on December 21, 1980, although he later returned to contribute additional rewrites.<ref>Sammon, pp. 49–63</ref>

Having invested over $2.5&nbsp;million in pre-production,<ref>Sammon, p. 49</ref> as the date of commencement of principal photography neared, Filmways withdrew financial backing. In ten days Deeley had secured $21.5&nbsp;million in financing through a three-way deal between [[The Ladd Company]] (through Warner Bros.), the Hong Kong-based producer [[Run Run Shaw|Sir Run Run Shaw]], and [[Tandem Productions]].<ref>Bukatman, pp. 18–19; Sammon, pp. 64–67</ref>

Philip K. Dick became concerned that no one had informed him about the film's production, which added to his distrust of Hollywood.<ref>Sammon, pp. 63–64</ref> After Dick criticized an early version of Hampton Fancher's script in an article written for the Los Angeles ''Select TV Guide'', the studio sent Dick the David Peoples rewrite.<ref>Sammon, pp. 67–69</ref> Although Dick died shortly before the film's release, he was pleased with the rewritten script, and with a twenty-minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Despite his well known skepticism of Hollywood in principle, Dick enthused to Ridley Scott that the world created for the film looked exactly as he had imagined it.<ref name="FutureNoir-p284">Sammon, p. 284</ref> He said, "I saw a segment of [[Douglas Trumbull]]'s special effects for ''Blade Runner'' on the KNBC-TV news. I recognized it immediately. It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly." He also approved of the film's script, saying, "After I finished reading the screenplay, I got the novel out and looked through it. The two reinforce each other, so that someone who started with the novel would enjoy the movie and someone who started with the movie would enjoy the novel."<ref name="Dick's final interview">{{citation|last=Boonstra|first=John|title=A final interview with science fiction's boldest visionary, who talks candidly about ''Blade Runner'', inner voices and the temptations of Hollywood|journal=Rod Serling's the Twilight Zone Magazine|volume=2|issue=3|date=June 1982|pages=47–52|url=http://www.philipkdick.com/media_twilightzone.html|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> The motion picture was dedicated to Dick.<ref>Blade Runner film, dedication after credits, 1:51:30</ref>

''Blade Runner'' has numerous deep similarities to [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', including a built-up urban environment, in which the wealthy literally live above the workers, dominated by a huge building &ndash; the Stadtkrone Tower in ''Metropolis'' and the Tyrell Building in ''Blade Runner''.

Ridley Scott credits [[Edward Hopper]]'s painting ''[[Nighthawks]]'' and the French science fiction comic magazine ''[[Métal Hurlant]]'' ([[Heavy Metal (magazine)|"Heavy Metal"]]), to which the artist [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]] contributed, as stylistic mood sources.<ref>Sammon, p. 74</ref> He also drew on the landscape of "Hong Kong on a very bad day"<ref>{{Citation |last= Wheale |first= Nigel |year= 1995 |title= The Postmodern Arts: An Introductory Reader |publisher=Routledge |url= http://books.google.com/?id=8dGfKmubQIgC&pg=PA107 |page= 107 |isbn= 0-415-07776-1 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> and the industrial landscape of his one-time home in northeast England.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/09/20/bfscott20.xml&sSheet=/arts/2003/09/20/ixartright.html|title=Director Maximus|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=July 27, 2011|date=September 20, 2003 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Monahan}}</ref> Scott hired [[Syd Mead]] as his concept artist who, like Scott, was influenced by ''Métal Hurlant''.<ref>Sammon, p. 53</ref> Moebius was offered the opportunity to assist in the pre-production of ''Blade Runner'', but he declined so that he could work on [[René Laloux]]'s animated film ''[[Les Maîtres du temps]]'' &ndash; a decision that he later regretted.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Giraud | first1 = Jean | year = 1988 | title = The Long Tomorrow & Other SF Stories | isbn=0-87135-281-8 | publisher=Marvel}}</ref> [[Lawrence G.

==Interpretation==
{{Main|Themes in Blade Runner}}
[[File:Blade Runner sun window.png|thumb|right|320px|alt=A screen-shot from the film depicts a large room as we look between two rows of pillars. At the far end of room there is a massive window that dwarfs a man in front of it. The man is facing away from us looking out of the window, through which the sun can be seen.|In this image, the dark and shadowy elements of film-noir cinematography are clearly visible.]]
Although ''Blade Runner'' is ostensibly an action film, it operates on multiple dramatic and narrative levels. It is indebted to [[film noir]] conventions: the ''[[femme fatale]]''; protagonist-narration (removed in later versions); dark and shadowy cinematography; and the questionable moral outlook of the hero &ndash; in this case, extended to include reflections upon the nature of his own humanity.<ref name="Barlow">Barlow, Aaron "Reel Toads and Imaginary Cities: Philip K. Dick, ''Blade Runner'' and the Contemporary Science Fiction Movie" in Brooker, pp. 43–58</ref><ref>Jermyn, Deborah "The Rachel Papers: In Search of ''Blade Runner''s Femme Fatale" in Brooker, pp. 159–172</ref> It is a literate science fiction film, thematically enfolding the philosophy of religion and moral implications of human mastery of [[genetic engineering]] in the context of classical Greek drama and [[hubris]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/view/172/210 |title=The Dystopian World of ''Blade Runner'': An Ecofeminist Perspective |accessdate=July 27, 2011|journal=Trumpeter| last1=Jenkins |first1 = Mary|year=1997|volume=14|issue=4}}</ref> It also draws on Biblical images, such as [[Noah]]'s flood,<ref>Kerman, Judith B.

''Blade Runner'' delves into the implications of technology on the environment and on society by reaching to the past, using literature, [[religious symbolism]], classical dramatic themes, and film noir. This tension between past, present, and future is mirrored in the retrofitted future of ''Blade Runner'', which is high-tech and gleaming in places but decayed and old elsewhere. Ridley Scott described the film as: "extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel", in an interview by [[Lynn Barber]] for ''[[The Observer]]'' (London) in 2002. Scott "liked the idea of exploring pain" in the wake of his brother's skin cancer death: "When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me."<ref name="scottobserver" />

An aura of paranoia suffuses the film: corporate power looms large; the police seem omnipresent; vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings; and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are explored &ndash; especially the consequences for replicants of their implanted memories. Control over the environment is depicted as taking place on a vast scale, hand in hand with the absence of any natural life, with artificial animals substituting for their extinct predecessors. This oppressive backdrop explains the frequently referenced migration of humans to extra-terrestrial ("off-world") colonies.<ref>{{citation |last1= Leaver |first1 = Tama |year= 1997 |title= Post-Humanism and Ecocide in William Gibson's ''Neuromancer'' and Ridley Scott's ''Blade Runner'' | url=http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/post-humanism_and_ecocide.html | publisher=Tama Leaver, University of Western Australia | accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>
The dystopian themes explored in ''Blade Runner'' are an early example of [[cyberpunk]] concepts expanding into film. Eyes are a recurring motif, as are manipulated images, calling into question reality and our ability to accurately perceive and remember it.<ref>{{citation |last1= Saini | first1 = Tinku |year= 1996 |url=http://kszu.standord.edu/uwi/br/tinku/ |title=Eye disbelieve |publisher=Tinku Saini, University of Washington |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |archiveurl=http://wolftrappe.blogspot.com/2006/09/eye-disbelieve-by-tinku-saini.html|archivedate = September 15, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last1=McCoy |first1 = John|url= http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~syverson/309-fall95/classpage/bladerunner/mccoy/|title=The Eyes Tell All|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=July 27, 2011|year=1995}}</ref><ref>Bukatman, pp. 9–11</ref>

These thematic elements provide an atmosphere of uncertainty for ''Blade Runner''{{'}}s central theme of examining humanity. In order to discover replicants, an empathy test is used, with a number of its questions focused on the treatment of animals &ndash; seemingly an essential indicator of someone's "humanity". The replicants appear to show compassion and concern for one another and are juxtaposed against human characters who lack empathy while the mass of humanity on the streets is cold and impersonal. The film goes so far as to put in doubt whether Deckard is human, and forces the audience to re-evaluate what it means to be human.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Kerman | first1 = Judith | year = 1991 | title = Retrofitting ''Blade Runner'': Issues in Ridley Scott's ''Blade Runner'' and Philip K.

Deckard's unicorn dream sequence, inserted into the ''Director's Cut'', coinciding with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn is seen by many as showing that Deckard is a replicant &ndash; as Gaff could have accessed Deckard's implanted memories.<ref name="Alessio" /><ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/825641.stm|title=''Blade Runner'' riddle solved|date=July 9, 2000|publisher=BBC |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity,<ref>Brooker, Peter "Imagining the Real: ''Blade Runner'' and Discourses on the Postmetropolis" in Brooker, pp. 9, 222</ref> or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the film's main theme.<ref>Bukatman, p. 83</ref> The inherent ambiguity and uncertainty of the film, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from their own perspectives.<ref>Hills, Matt "Academic Textual Poachers: ''Blade Runner'' as Cult Canonical Film" in Brooker, pp. 124–141</ref>

==Reception==
''Blade Runner'' was released in 1,290 theaters on June 25, 1982. That date was chosen by producer [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] because his previous highest-grossing films (''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'') had a similar opening date (May 25) in 1977 and 1979, making the date his "lucky day".<ref>Sammon, p. 309</ref>
The gross for the opening weekend was a disappointing $6.15&nbsp;million.<ref>Bukatman, p. 34; Sammon, p. 316</ref> A significant factor in the film's rather poor box office performance was that it was released around the same time as other science fiction films, including ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'', ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', and, most significantly, ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', which dominated box office revenues that summer.<ref>Sammon, pp. 316–317</ref>

Film critics were polarized as some felt the story had taken a back seat to special effects and that it was not the action/adventure the studio had advertised. Others acclaimed its complexity and predicted it would stand the test of time.<ref>Sammon, pp. 313–315</ref>

In the United States, a general criticism was its slow pacing that detracts from other strengths;<ref>{{citation|last1=Hicks|first1=Chris|date=September 11, 1992|url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700000200/Blade-Runner.html|title=Movie review: Blade Runner |publisher=Deseret News Publishing Co|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> Sheila Benson from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "Blade Crawler", while Pat Berman in ''[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]'' and ''[[Columbia Record]]'' described it as "science fiction pornography".<ref>Quoted in Sammon, p. 313 and p. 314, respectively</ref> [[Pauline Kael]] noted that with its "extraordinary" congested-megalopolis sets, ''Blade Runner'' "has its own look, and a visionary sci-fi movie that has its own look can't be ignored &ndash; it has its place in film history" but "hasn't been thought out in human terms".<ref name=Kael>{{cite book|last=Kael|first=Pauline|title=Taking It All In|year=1984|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|isbn=0-03-069361-6|pages=360–365}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] praised the visuals of both the original ''Blade Runner'' and the ''Director's Cut'' versions and recommended it for that reason; however, he found the human story clichéd and a little thin.<ref name="Ebert" /> In 2007, upon release of ''The Final Cut'', Ebert somewhat revised his original opinion of the film and added it to his list of Great Movies, while noting, "I have been assured that my problems in the past with ''Blade Runner'' represent a failure of my own taste and imagination, but if the film was perfect, why has Sir Ridley continued to tinker with it?"<ref>{{citation|url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071103%2FREVIEWS08%2F71103001%2F1023|date= November 3, 2007|title= Blade Runner: The Final Cut (1982)|authorlink= Roger Ebert | last1 = Ebert | first1 = Roger |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> ''Blade Runner'' holds a 91% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with an average score of 8.5 out of 10 from 96 reviews.<ref name="RottenTomatoes"/> The site's main consensus reads "Misunderstood when it first hit theaters, the influence of Ridley Scott's mysterious, neo-noir Blade Runner has deepened with time.

While not initially a success with North American audiences, the film was popular internationally and garnered a [[cult film|cult following]].<ref>Sammon, pp. 318–329</ref> The film's dark style and futuristic designs have served as a benchmark and its influence can be seen in many subsequent science fiction films, [[anime]], video games, and television programs.<ref name="Barlow" /> For example, [[Ronald D. Moore]] and [[David Eick]], the producers of the re-imagining of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', have both cited ''Blade Runner'' as one of the major influences for the show.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Moore |first=Ronald D. |subjectlink=Ronald D.

===''Blade Runner'' curse===
Among the folklore that has developed around the film over the years has been the belief that the film was a curse to the companies whose logos were displayed prominently as [[product placement]]s in some scenes.<ref>Sammon, p. 104</ref> While they were market leaders at the time, [[Atari]], [[Bell System|Bell]], [[Cuisinart]] and [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] experienced setbacks after the film's release. [[The Coca-Cola Company]] suffered losses during its failed introduction of [[New Coke]] in 1985, but soon afterwards regained its market share.<ref name=chapman/>

===''Future Noir''===
{{Further|Tech noir}}
Before the film's [[principal photography]] began, ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' magazine commissioned Paul M. Sammon to write an article about ''Blade Runner''{{'}}s production which became the book ''Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner'' (referred to as the "''Blade Runner'' Bible" by many of the film's fans).<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.brmovie.com/Encyclopedia/PQRST.HTML |title= Encyclopedia Blade Runner|accessdate=January 22, 2008 |publisher=BRmovie.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080316193547/http://www.brmovie.com/Encyclopedia/PQRST.HTML |archivedate = March 16, 2008}}</ref>
The book chronicles the evolution of ''Blade Runner'' as a film and focuses on film-set politics, especially the British director's experiences with his first American film crew; of which producer [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] has said, "Harrison wouldn't speak to Ridley and Ridley wouldn't speak to Harrison. By the end of the shoot Ford was 'ready to kill Ridley', said one colleague. He really would have taken him on if he hadn't been talked out of it."<ref>{{Citation | last= Shone | first= Tom | year= 2004 | title= Blockbuster | isbn = 0-7432-3990-3 | publisher=Simon & Schuster}}</ref>
''Future Noir'' has short cast biographies and quotations about their experiences in making ''Blade Runner'', as well as many photographs of the film's production and preliminary sketches. The cast chapter was deleted from the first edition, though it is available online. A second edition of ''Future Noir'' was published in 2007.<ref>{{citation|url = http://scribble.com/uwi/br/fn/ | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20010624131853/scribble.com/uwi/br/fn/ | archivedate = June 24, 2001 | title= Future Noir: Lost Chapters |publisher=2019:Lost Worlds |accessdate=February 5, 2008 }}</ref>

==Soundtrack==
{{Main|Blade Runner (soundtrack)}}

The ''Blade Runner'' soundtrack by [[Vangelis]] is a dark melodic combination of classic composition and futuristic synthesizers which mirrors the film-noir retro-future envisioned by Ridley Scott. Vangelis, fresh from his [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning score for ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'',<ref name=NSVan>{{citation|title=Blade Runner - Scoring the music|url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/bladerunner/index.htm|publisher=Nemo Studios|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> composed and performed the music on his synthesizers.<ref>Sammon, pp. 271–274</ref> He also made use of various chimes and the vocals of collaborator [[Demis Roussos]].<ref name="FutureNoir-p419">Sammon, pp. 419–423</ref> Another memorable sound is the haunting tenor sax solo "Love Theme" by British saxophonist [[Dick Morrissey]], who appeared on many of Vangelis' albums. Ridley Scott also used "Memories of Green" from Vangelis' album ''[[See You Later]]'' (an orchestral version of which Scott would later use in his film ''[[Someone to Watch Over Me (film)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]'').<ref>{{Citation | last = Larsen | first = Peter | title = Film music | publisher=Reaktion Books | location = London | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-86189-341-3 |page=179}}</ref>

Along with Vangelis' compositions and ambient textures, the film's sound scape also features a track by the Japanese ensemble Nipponia ("Ogi No Mato" or "The Folding Fan as a Target" from the Nonesuch Records release ''Traditional Vocal and Instrumental Music'') and a track by harpist Gail Laughton ("Harps of the Ancient Temples" from Laurel Records).<ref>Sammon, p. 424</ref>

Despite being well received by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and [[Golden Globe]] as best original score, and the promise of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from ''Blade Runner''. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the [[New American Orchestra]] recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would in 1989 surface on the compilation ''Vangelis: Themes'', but not until the 1992 release of the ''Director's Cut'' version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.<ref name="FutureNoir-p419" />

These delays and poor reproductions led to the production of many [[bootleg recording]]s over the years. A bootleg tape surfaced in 1982 at science fiction conventions and became popular given the delay of an official release of the original recordings, and in 1993 "Off World Music, Ltd" created a bootleg CD that would prove more comprehensive than Vangelis' official CD in 1994.<ref name="FutureNoir-p419" /> A set with three CDs of ''Blade Runner''-related Vangelis music was released in 2007. Titled ''Blade Runner Trilogy'', the first CD contains the same tracks as the 1994 official soundtrack release, the second CD contains previously unreleased music from the movie, and the third CD is all newly composed music from Vangelis, inspired by, and in the spirit of the movie.<ref>{{citation|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/ |title=Album Review: Vangelis: ''Blade Runner Trilogy: 25th Anniversary'' |first=Mike |last=Orme |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |date=February 7, 2008 }}</ref>

==Versions==
{{Main|Versions of Blade Runner}}

Seven different versions of ''Blade Runner'' have been shown. The original workprint version (1982, 113 minutes) was shown for audience test previews in Denver and Dallas in March 1982. Negative responses to the test previews led to the modifications resulting in the U.S. theatrical version.<ref>{{citation|last1=Kaplan|first1=Fred|title=A Cult Classic Restored, Again |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/movies/30kapl.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 30, 2007|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>Sammon, p. 289</ref> The original version was also shown as a director's cut without Scott's approval at the Los Angeles Fairfax Theater in May 1990, at an AMPAS showing in April 1991, and in September and October 1991 at the Los Angeles NuArt Theater and the San Francisco Castro Theater.<ref>Bukatman, pp. 36–37; Sammon, pp. 334–340</ref> Positive responses pushed the studio to approve work on an official director's cut.<ref>Bukatman, p. 37</ref> It was re-released with the 5-disc Ultimate Edition in 2007.

A San Diego Sneak Preview was shown only once, in May 1982, and was almost identical to the U.S. theatrical version but contained three extra scenes not shown in any other version, including the 2007 Final Cut.<ref>Sammon, pp. 306 and 309–311</ref>

The releases seen by most cinema audiences were: the U.S. theatrical version (1982, 116 minutes), known as the original version or ''Domestic Cut'', released on [[Betamax]] and VHS in 1983 and [[Laserdisc]] in 1987; the ''International Cut'' (1982, 117 minutes), also known as the "Criterion Edition" or "uncut version", which included more violent action scenes than the U.S. version. Although initially unavailable in the U.S., and distributed in Europe and Asia via theatrical and local Warner Home Video Laserdisc releases, it was later released on VHS and [[Criterion Collection]] Laserdisc in North America, and re-released in 1992 as a "10th Anniversary Edition".<ref>Sammon, pp. 326–329</ref>

The U.S. broadcast version (1986, 114 minutes) was the U.S. theatrical version edited by [[CBS]] to tone down the violence, profanity, and nudity to meet broadcasting restrictions.<ref>Sammon, pp. 407–408 and 432</ref>

The Ridley Scott-approved (1991, 116 minutes) ''Director's Cut'' was prompted by the unauthorized 1990/1991 workprint theatrical release. This ''Director's Cut'' was made available on VHS and Laserdisc in 1993, and on DVD in 1997. Significant changes from the theatrical version include: the removal of Deckard's voice-over; re-insertion of a unicorn sequence; and removal of the studio-imposed happy ending. Scott provided extensive notes and consultation to Warner Bros. through film preservationist Michael Arick, who was put in charge of creating the ''Director's Cut''.<ref name="Sammon, pp. 353, 365">Sammon, pp. 353, 365</ref>

Ridley Scott's ''The Final Cut'' (2007, 117 minutes) or the "25th Anniversary Edition" was released by Warner Bros. theatrically on October 5, 2007, and subsequently released on DVD, [[HD DVD]], and [[Blu-ray Disc]] in December 2007.<ref name="thedigitalbits" /> This is the only version over which Ridley Scott had complete artistic control, as he was not directly in charge of the ''Director's Cut''.<ref name="Sammon, pp. 353, 365" /> In conjunction with the ''Final Cut'' cinema release, extensive documentary and other materials were produced for the DVD releases which culminated in a five-disc "Ultimate Collector's Edition" release by [[Charles de Lauzirika]].<ref name="hunt" />

==Derivative works==

===Novelization===
Philip K. Dick refused an offer of $400,000 to write a [[novelization]] of the ''Blade Runner'' screenplay, saying: "[I was] told the cheapo novelization would have to appeal to the twelve-year-old audience" and "[it] would have probably been disastrous to me artistically." He added, "That insistence on my part of bringing out the original novel and not doing the novelization &ndash; they were just furious. They finally recognized that there was a legitimate reason for reissuing the novel, even though it cost them money. It was a victory not just of contractual obligations but of theoretical principles."<ref name="Dick's final interview" /> ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'' was eventually reprinted as a [[movie tie-in (book)|tie-in]], with the film poster as a cover and the original title in parentheses below the ''Blade Runner'' title.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://books.google.com/?id=n0pzCsR6yDQC|title=Blade runner: (Do androids dream of electric sheep)|last=Dick|first=Philip K.|year=2007|publisher=Del Rey Books|page=216|accessdate=July 27, 2011|isbn=978-0-345-35047-3}}</ref>

===Documentaries===
''On the Edge of Blade Runner'' (2000, 55 minutes) was produced by Nobles Gate Ltd. (for [[Channel 4]]), directed by Andrew Abbott and hosted/written by [[Mark Kermode]]. Interviews with production staff, including Scott, give details of the creative process and the turmoil during preproduction. Stories from Paul M. Sammon and Hampton Fancher provide insight into [[Philip K. Dick]] and the origins of ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''<ref name="edge-doc-review">{{citation|url=http://tyrell-corporation.pp.se/on-the-edge-of-blade-runner-documentury/|title=On The Edge Of Blade Runner (Documentury) |last=Ingels|first=Nicklas|publisher=Los Angeles, 2019|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>

Interwoven are cast interviews (with the notable exceptions of Harrison Ford and Sean Young), which convey some of the difficulties of making the film (including an exacting director and humid, smoggy weather). There is also a tour of some locations, most notably the [[Bradbury Building]] and the Warner Bros. backlot that became the LA 2019 streets, which look very different from Scott's dark vision. The documentary then details the test screenings and the resulting changes (the voice over, the happy ending, and the deleted Holden hospital scene), the special effects, the soundtrack by Vangelis, and the unhappy relationship between the filmmakers and the investors which culminated in Deeley and Scott being fired but still working on the film. The question of [[Themes in Blade Runner#Deckard: human or replicant?|whether or not Deckard is a replicant]] surfaces.<ref name="edge-doc-review"/>

''Future Shocks'' (2003, 27 minutes) is a documentary by [[TVOntario]].<ref name="futureshocks">{{citation|url=http://www.tvo.org/TVO/WebObjects/TVO.woa?b?8595181114711207000|title=The Interviews – Future Shocks|publisher=TVO.ORG|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> It includes interviews with executive producer [[Bud Yorkin]], [[Syd Mead]], and the cast, this time with Sean Young, but still without Harrison Ford. There is extensive commentary by science fiction author [[Robert J. Sawyer]] and from film critics, as the documentary focuses on the themes, visual impact and influence of the film. Edward James Olmos describes Ford's participation, and personal experiences during filming are related by Young, Walsh, Cassidy and Sanderson. They also relate a story about crew members creating T-shirts that took pot shots at Scott. The different versions of the film are critiqued and the accuracy of its predictions of the future are discussed.

''Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner'' (2007, 183 minutes) is a documentary directed and produced by [[Charles de Lauzirika]] for ''The Final Cut'' version of the film. It appears with every edition of ''The Final Cut'' on DVD, HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc, except for the 2010 single-disc DVD and Blu-Ray editions. (It is a DVD format disc, even in the HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc editions). It was culled from over 80 interviews, including Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Edward James Olmos, Jerry Perenchio, Bud Yorkin and Ridley Scott, and also contains several alternate and deleted shots within the context of the documentary itself.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.chud.com/11285/interview-charles-de-lauzirika-blade-runner/ |title=Interview: Charles de Lauzirika (Blade Runner)|accessdate=July 27, 2011|publisher=CHUD.com| last1 =Fischer | first1 = Russ|date=February 8, 2007}}</ref> The documentary consists of eight chapters, each covering a portion of the film-making &ndash; or in the case of the final chapter, the film's controversial legacy.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.filmedge.net/BladeRunner/BRdvd.htm|title=Blade Runner&nbsp;– The Final Cut: 2-Disc Special Edition DVD Review|accessdate=July 27, 2011|publisher=FilmEdge.net| last1=Weitz | first1 = Scott|date=December 16, 2007}}</ref>

''All Our Variant Futures: From Workprint to Final Cut'' (2007, 29 minutes), produced by Paul Prischman, appears on Disc 5 of the ''Blade Runner'' Ultimate Collector's Edition and provides an overview of the film's multiple versions and their origins, as well as detailing the seven year-long restoration, enhancement and remastering process behind ''The Final Cut''. Included are interviews with director Ridley Scott, restoration producer Charles de Lauzirika, restoration consultant Kurt P. Galvao, restoration VFX supervisor John Scheele and ''Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner'' author Paul M. Sammon. Behind-the-scenes footage documenting the restoration—from archival work done in 2001 through the 2007 filming of Joanna Cassidy and Benjamin Ford for ''The Final Cut''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s digital fixes—are seen throughout.<ref name="thedigitalbits" /> A variety of other supplemental featurettes produced and directed by Charles de Lauzirika are included on both the four- and five-disc collector's editions of ''Blade Runner'' released by Warner Home Video in 2007.<ref name="thedigitalbits" />

===Possible follow-ups===
[[K. W. Jeter]], a friend of Philip K. Dick, wrote three officially authorized ''Blade Runner'' novels that continue Deckard's story; attempting to resolve many of the differences between ''Blade Runner'' and ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''<ref>Gray, Christy "Originals and Copies:The Fans of Philip K.

By 1999, [[Stuart Hazeldine]] had written a proposed sequel to ''Blade Runner'' titled ''Blade Runner Down'', which would have been based on Jeter's first sequel novel. The project was shelved due to rights issues.<ref name=sequels>{{citation | url=http://www.mybladerunner.com/faq/1-8-are-there-any-sequels-i-heard-rumours/| title=The Blade Runner FAQ: Are there any sequels?

In June 2009 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Ridley Scott and his brother [[Tony Scott]] were working on a prequel to ''Blade Runner'' set at a point in time before 2019. The prequel, ''Purefold'', was planned as a series of 5–10 minute shorts, aimed first at the [[webisode|web]] and then perhaps television. Due to rights issues the proposed series was not to be linked too closely to the characters or events of the 1982 film.<ref>{{citation|last=Stone |first=Brad |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/web-series-tied-to-blade-runner-is-in-the-works |title=Web Series Tied to 'Blade Runner' Is In the Works|publisher=New York Times |date= June 4, 2009|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> On February 7, 2010, it was announced that production on ''Purefold'' had ceased, due to funding problems.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ag8.com/ |work=Ag8 |accessdate=December 23, 2011}}</ref>

On March 4, 2011, [[io9]] reported that Bud Yorkin, the producer of ''Blade Runner'', was developing a sequel or prequel to the film. It was not announced whether this was connected to Ridley Scott or any of the other original filmmakers.<ref>{{citation|url=http://io9.com/#!5774950/a-warner-bros+financed-production-company-buying-the-rights-to-do-a-blade-runner-sequel-or-prequel |work=[[io9]] |publisher=Gawker Media |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |date=March 4, 2011 |first=Charlie Jane |last=Anders |title=''Blade Runner'' Sequel (or Prequel) in Development Now}}</ref> It was also reported that month that [[Christopher Nolan]], who has worked with Warner Bros. many times in the past, was wanted at the helm of any eventual prequel or sequel.<ref>{{citation|author=Orange, B.

It was announced on August 18, 2011, that Ridley Scott was to be at the helm of a new ''Blade Runner'' movie, either a sequel or a prequel, with filming to begin no earlier than 2013 and a release for the following year. Indications from producer [[Andrew Kosove]] were that Harrison Ford was unlikely to be involved in the project.<ref>{{citation|last=Fleming |first=Mike|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/08/ridley-scott-ready-to-direct-new-version-of-seminal-sci-fi-film-blade-runner/|title=Ridley Scott To Direct New 'Blade Runner' Installment For Alcon Entertainment |publisher=deadline.com |date=August 18, 2011 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14586762 |title=Ridley Scott to direct new Blade Runner film|publisher=BBC|date=August 19, 2011|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> Scott later said that the film was "liable to be a sequel" but without the previous cast, and that he was close to finding a writer that "might be able to help [him] deliver".<ref>{{citation|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/11/04/ridley-scott-says-he’ll-direct-‘blade-runner’-sequel/ |title=Ridley Scott Says He'll Direct 'Blade Runner' Sequel|publisher=Speakeasy|date=November 2, 2011|accessdate=November 6, 2011}}</ref> On February 6, 2012, Kosove denied that any casting considerations had been made in response to buzz that Ford might reprise his role, saying, "It is absolutely, patently false that there has been any discussion about Harrison Ford being in ''Blade Runner'' [2]. To be clear, what we are trying to do with Ridley now is go through the painstaking process of trying to break the back of the story&nbsp;... The casting of the movie could not be further from our minds at this moment."<ref>{{citation|author=Vejvoda, Jim|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/02/07/harrison-ford-in-blade-runner-2 |title=Harrison Ford in Blade Runner 2?|publisher=ign.com|date=February 6, 2012|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}</ref>

When Scott was asked about the possibility of a ''Blade Runner'' sequel in October 2012, he said, "It's not a rumor&mdash;it's happening. With Harrison Ford? I don't know yet. Is he too old? Well, he was a Nexus-6 so we don't know how long he can live. And that's all I'm going to say at this stage."<ref>{{citation|last=Sullivan|first=Kevin P.|title=Ridley Scott Gives 'Prometheus 2' And 'Blade Runner 2' Updates|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2012/10/12/prometheus-2-blade-runner-2-updates/|work=MTV Movies Blog|accessdate=October 13, 2012|date=October 12, 2012}}</ref> It is widely believed that Ford will appear in ''Star Wars: Episode VII'', which may affect his ability to reprise his role as Deckard in a ''Blade Runner'' sequel.<ref>http://screencrush.com/star-wars-episode-7-j-j-abrams-talks/</ref>

===Video games===
{{Main|Blade Runner (1985 video game)|Blade Runner (1997 video game)}}
There are two video games based on the film, one for [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] (1985) by CRL Group PLC based on the music by Vangelis (due to licensing issues), and another action adventure [[Blade Runner (1997 video game)|PC game]] (1997) by [[Westwood Studios]]. The [[Blade Runner (1997 video game)|Westwood PC game]] featured new characters and branching storylines based on the ''Blade Runner'' world. [[Blade Runner (1997 video game)#Characters|Eldon Tyrell, Gaff, Leon, Rachael, Chew, and J.F. Sebastian]] are seen, and their voice files were recorded by the original actors. DNA Row, the Eye Works, the Police Headquarters, Howie Lee's, the Tyrell Corporation building, and J.F. Sebastian's hotel are faithfully replicated.<ref name=BRcast/> The events portrayed in the 1997 game occur not after, but in parallel to those in the film. The player assumes the role of McCoy, another replicant-hunter working at the same time as Deckard. Although Deckard is seen in photo evidence and referred to in dialogue,<ref name=BRcast>{{citation|url=http://www.brmovie.com/BR_Game_MW01.htm |title=Blade Runner |publisher=BRMovie |accessdate=August 10, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080714055512/http://www.brmovie.com/BR_Game_MW01.htm |archivedate = July 14, 2008}}</ref> Deckard and McCoy never meet.<ref name="Atkins" /><ref name="Tosca" />

The PC game featured a non-linear plot, [[non-player character]]s that each ran in their own independent [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], and an unusual pseudo-3D engine (which eschewed polygonal solids in favor of [[Voxel#Computer gaming|voxel]] elements) that did not require the use of a 3D accelerator card to play the game.<ref>{{citation | last=Bates | first=Jason | title=Westwood's Blade Runner|journal=PC Gamer|volume=4|issue=9| publisher=Blade Zone | date=September 9, 1997 | url=http://media.bladezone.com/contents/game/BR-PCGame1.html | accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>

===Television series===
{{Main|Total Recall 2070}}
The television film ''Total Recall 2070'' was initially planned as a spin-off of the movie ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'', and would eventually be transformed into a hybrid of ''Total Recall'' and ''Blade Runner''.<ref>{{Citation
