The '''Amu Darya''' ({{lang-fa|آمودریا}}, ''Āmūdaryā''; {{lang-tk|Amyderýa}}; [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]]: ''Amudaryo''; {{lang-tg|Амударё}}; {{lang-ps|د آمو سيند}}, ''da Āmú Sínd''; {{lang-grc|Ὦξος}}, ''Oxos''; {{lang-la|Oxus}}), also called '''Amu River''', is a major river in [[Central Asia]]. It is formed by the junction of the [[Vakhsh River|Vakhsh]] and [[Panj River|Panj]] rivers. In ancient times, the river was regarded as the boundary between [[Greater Iran]] and [[Turan]].<ref name="Iranica">B. Spuler, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/amu-darya-gk ĀMŪ DARYĀ], in [[Encyclopædia Iranica]], online ed., 2009</ref>

[[Image:Amu darya delta.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Amu Darya Delta from space]]

In [[classical antiquity]], the river was known as the ''Ōxus'' in [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[wikt:Ὦξος|Ὦξος]] ''Oxos'' in [[Greek language|Greek]] — a clear derivative of [[Vakhsh River|Vakhsh]] &mdash; the name of the largest tributary of the river.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} In Vedic [[Sanskrit]], the river is also referred to as [[Vaksu]] (वक्षु). The [[Avestan]] texts too refer to the River as Yaksha-arte. 

In ancient Afghanistan, the river was also called '''Gozan''', descriptions of which can be found in the book "The Kingdom of Afghanistan: a historical sketch By George Passman Tate".<ref name="Gozan - The River Oxus or Amu">http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tGTd9KKwKVwC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=allintext:+%3D+gozan+oxus+amu&source=bl&ots=ZDHOgiLp1e&sig=Du0XLu3_E3vhhGiArc3JU_iqJHk&hl=en&ei=CBHhTPm6IYnsuAPGkKjYDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=allintext%3A%20%3D%20gozan%20oxus%20amu&f=false</ref><ref name="The Kingdom of Afghanistan: a historical sketch By George Passman Tate">http://library.du.ac.in/dspace/bitstream/1/4715/4/Ch.1 The kingdom of Afghanistan (page 1-87).pdf</ref> In [[Middle Persian]] sources of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid period]] the river is known as ''Wehrōd''<ref name="Iranica" /> (lit. "good river"). 

The name ''Amu'' is said to have come from the medieval city of ''Āmul'', (later, Chahar Joy/Charjunow, and now known as [[Türkmenabat]]), in modern [[Turkmenistan]], with ''Darya'' being the Persian word for "river".

Medieval [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Muslim]] sources call the river ''Jayhoun'' (جيحون) which is derived from ''[[Gihon]]'', the biblical name for one of the four rivers of the [[Garden of Eden]].<ref name="ref1">[[William C. Brice]]. 1981. ''Historical Atlas of Islam (Hardcover)''. Leiden with support and patronage from Encyclopaedia of Islam.

Amu Darya is a river almost in reverse, for long reputed to be sourced by a powerful glacier-fed stream high in the Pamir Knot at the eastern end of [[Afghanistan]]'s [[Wakhan Corridor]], and ending not at the sea but spreading out into the sands of Turkmenistan's [[Kyzyl Kum]] desert, well short of its historic terminus of the inland [[Aral Sea]].

==As the river Gozan==
Historians mention that one of the names for the Oxus or Amu in ancient Afghanistan was Gozan, and that this name was used by Greek, Mongol, Chinese, Persian, Jewish, and Afghan historians. However, this name is no longer used.

==Description==
[[File:Aral map.png|thumb|250px|left|Map of area around the Aral Sea. Aral Sea boundaries are c. 1960. Countries at least partially in the Aral Sea watershed are in yellow.]]

The river's total length is {{convert|2400|km|mi}} and its drainage basin totals {{convert|534739|km2|sqmi}} in area, providing a mean discharge of around {{convert|97.4|km3|cumi}}<ref name="autogenerated1" /> of water per year. The river is navigable for over {{convert|1450|km|mi}}. All of the water comes from the high mountains in the south where annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] can be over {{convert|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Even before large-scale irrigation began, high summer evaporation meant that not all of this discharge reached the [[Aral Sea]] - though there is some evidence the large Pamir [[glacier]]s provided enough melt water for the Aral to overflow during the 13th and 14th centuries.

Since the end of the 19th century there have been four different claimants as the true source of the Oxus:
1: the [[Pamir River]], which emerges from Lake [[Zorkul]] (once also known as Lake Victoria) in the [[Pamir Mountains]] (ancient [[Mount Imeon]]), and flows west to Qila-e Panja, where it joins the [[Wakhan River]] to form the [[Panj River]]. 
2: the Sarhad or [[Little Pamir]] River flowing down the Little Pamir in the High [[Wakhan]]
3: Lake Chamaktin, which discharges to the east into the [[Bartang River|Aksu River]], which in turn becomes the [[Murghab River (Tajikistan)|Murghab]] and then [[Bartang River|Bartang]] rivers, and which eventually joins the Panj Oxus branch 350 kilometres downstream at Roshan Vomar in Tajikistan.
4: an [[ice cave]] at the end of the [[Wakhjir]] valley, in the [[Wakhan Corridor]], in the [[Pamir Mountains]], near the border with Pakistan.
[[File:Afghanistan - Tajikistan Bridge Completion.jpg|thumb|[[Tajikistan–Afghanistan bridge at Panji Poyon|Afghanistan-Tajikistan]] bridge over the Amu Darya.]]
A glacier turns into the [[Wakhan River]] and joins the Pamir River about {{convert|50|km}} downstream.<ref>Mock,J., O'Neil, K.  (2004) [http://www.mockandoneil.com/stg04r3.htm#oxus Expedition Report]</ref>
Bill Colegrave's expedition to Wakhan in 2007 found that both claimants 2 and 3 had the same source, the Chelab stream, which bifurcates on the watershed of the Little Pamir, half flowing into Lake Chamaktin and half into the parent stream of the Little Pamir/Sarhad River. Therefore the Chelab stream may be properly considered the true source or parent stream of the Oxus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Colegrave|first=Bill|title=Halfway House to Heaven|year=2011|publisher=Bene Factum Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-1-903071-28-1|pages=176|url=http://www.bene-factum.co.uk}}</ref> 
The Panj River forms the border of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]]. It flows west to [[Ishkashim, Afghanistan|Ishkashim]] where it turns north and then north-west through the [[Pamirs]] passing the [[Tajikistan–Afghanistan bridge at Panji Poyon|Tajikistan-Afghanistan Friendship Bridge]]. It subsequently forms the border of Afghanistan and Uzbekistan for about {{convert|200|km}}, passing [[Termez]] and the [[Afghanistan-Uzbekistan Friendship Bridge]]. It delineates the border of Afghanistan and Turkmenistan for another {{convert|100|km}} before it flows into Turkmenistan at [[Atamurat]]. As the ''Amudarya'', it flows across Turkmenistan south to north, passing [[Türkmenabat]], and forms the border of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan from [[Halkabat]]. It is then split into many waterways that are used to form the [[river delta]] joining the Aral Sea, passing [[Urgench]], [[Daşoguz]], and other cities, but it does not reach what is left of the sea anymore and is lost in the desert.

Use of water from the Amu Darya for [[irrigation]] has been a major contributing factor to the shrinking of the Aral Sea since the late 1950s.

Historical records state that in different periods, the river flowed into the [[Aral Sea]] (from the south), into the [[Caspian Sea]] (from the east), or both, similar to the [[Syr Darya]] (Jaxartes, in [[Ancient Greek]]).

==Watershed==
[[File:Bridge.Amu.Darya.Urgench.jpg|thumb|Pontoon Bridge on the Amu River near [[Urgench]]]]
About {{convert|1385045|km2|mi2}} of land is drained by the Amu Darya into the Aral Sea [[endorheic basin]]. This includes most of Tajikistan, the southwest corner of [[Kyrgyzstan]], the northeast corner of Afghanistan, a long narrow portion of eastern Turkmenistan and about half of Uzbekistan. Part of the Amu Darya's [[drainage divide]] in Tajikistan forms that country's border with China (in the east) and Pakistan (to the south). About 61% of the drainage lies within Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, while 39% is in Afghanistan.<ref name="Basin">{{cite web

This is because many of the river's major tributaries (especially the [[Zeravshan River]]) have been diverted, and much of the river's drainage is dominated by outlying [[desert]] and [[steppe]].

==History==

[[File:BactriaMap.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Ancient [[Bactria]]]]
[[File:Homage being paid to Babur, in 910 AH1504 CE, by Bāqī Chaghānyānī near the river Oxus (Daryā Āmū).jpg|thumb|Homage being paid to [[Babur]] beside the Amu Darya river.]]

The Amu Darya was called the ''Oxus'' by the ancient [[Greece|Greek]]s. In ancient times, the river was regarded as the boundary between [[Greater Iran]] and [[Turan|Tūrān]].<ref name="Iranica">Spuler, B., [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/amu-darya-gk ĀMŪ DARYĀ], in [[Encyclopædia Iranica]], online ed., 2009</ref> The river's drainage lies in the area between the former empires of [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Alexander the Great]], although they occurred at much different times. When the Monguls lived in the area, they used the water of the Amu Darya to flood [[Konye-Urgench]].<ref name=Sykes>{{cite book|last=Sykes|first=Percy|title=A History of Persia|year=1921|publisher=Macmillan and Company|location=London|page=64|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7307/view/1/64/}}</ref> One southern route of the [[Silk Road]] ran along part of the Amu Darya northwestward from [[Termez]] before going westwards to the [[Caspian Sea]].

It is believed that the Amu Darya's course across the Kara-Kum Desert has gone through several major shifts in the past few thousand years. Much of the time, the most recent period being in the 13th century to the late 16th century, the Amu Darya emptied into both the Aral and the Caspian Seas, the latter via a large [[distributary]] called the [[Uzboy River]]. The Uzboy splits off from the main channel just south of the Amudarya Delta. Sometimes, the flow through the two branches was more or less equal, but often, most of the Amu Darya's flow split to the west and flowed into the Caspian. 

People began to settle along the lower Amu Darya and the Uzboy in the 5th century, establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands, towns, and cities. The river was impounded in about 985 AD at the bifurcation of the forks by the massive Gurganj Dam, which diverted water to the Aral. The dam was destroyed by [[Genghis Khan]]'s troops in 1221, and the Amu Darya shifted its flows more or less equally between the main stem and the Uzboy.<ref name="Oxus">{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-02-08}}</ref> But in the 18th century, the river again turned north, flowing into the Aral Sea, a path it has taken since. Less and less water flowed down the Uzboy until, in the 1720s, the river's surface flow completely dried up.<ref>{{cite web

The first Englishman to reach the Oxus was [[William Moorcroft (explorer)|William Moorcroft]] about 1824.<ref>Peter Hopkirk,"The Great Game",1994, page 100</ref> Another to reach the region in the [[Great Game]] period was a naval officer called [[John Wood (explorer)|John Wood]].  He was sent on an expedition to find the source of the river in 1839. He found modern day Lake Zorkul, called it Lake Victoria and proclaimed he had found the source.<ref>Keay, J. (1983) ''When Men and Mountains Meet'' ISBN 0-7126-0196-1 Chapter 9</ref> Then, the French explorer and geographer [[Thibaut Viné]] collected a lot of informations about this area during five expeditions between 1856 and 1862.

[[File:Thibaut Viné.jpg|thumb|left|French geographer Thibaut Viné]]

The question of finding a route between the Oxus valley and India has been of concern historically. A direct route crosses extremely high mountain passes in the [[Hindu Kush]] and isolated areas like [[Kafiristan]]. It was feared by some in Britain that the Empire of [[Russia]], which at the time held a large influence over the Oxus area, would overcome these obstacles and find a suitable route through which to invade [[British India]] but this never came to pass.<ref>See for example "Can Russia invade India?" by Henry Bathurst Hanna, 1895, (Google eBook), or "The Káfirs of the Hindu-Kush", Sir George Scott Robertson, Illustrated by Arthur David McCormick, Lawrence & Bullen, Limited, 1896, (Google eBook)</ref>

The [[Soviet Union]] became the ruling power in the early 1920s and expelled [[Mohammed Alim Khan]]. It later put down the [[Basmachi movement]] and killed [[Ibrahim Bek]]. A large refugee population of Central Asians, including Turkmen, Tajiks and Uzbeks, fled to northern Afghanistan.<ref>Taliban and Talibanism in Historical Perspective, M Nazif Shahrani, chapter 4 of The Taliban And The Crisis of Afghanistan, 2008 Harvard Univ Press, ed by Robert D Crews and Amin Tarzi</ref> In the 1960s and 1970s, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya were first used by the Soviets to irrigate extensive [[cotton]] fields in the Central Asian plain. Before this time, water from the rivers was already being used for agriculture, but not on this massive scale. The [[Qaraqum Canal]], Karshi Canal, and Bukhara Canal were among the larger of the irrigation diversions built. The 1970s [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] used the valley to invade the country through [[Termez]].<ref>Termez - See the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] article</ref> The Soviet Union fell in the 1990s and Central Asia split up into the many smaller countries that lie within or partially within the Amu Darya basin.<ref>{{cite web

Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had <br>
In his high mountain-cradle in Pamere, <br>
A foiled circuitous wanderer: — till at last <br>
