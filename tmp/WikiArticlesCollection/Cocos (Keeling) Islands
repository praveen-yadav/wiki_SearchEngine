The '''Territory of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands''', also called '''Cocos Islands''' and '''Keeling Islands''', is a [[States and territories of Australia|territory]] of [[Australia]], located in the [[Indian Ocean]], southwest of [[Christmas Island]] and approximately midway between Australia and [[Sri Lanka]].

The territory consists of two [[atoll]]s and 27 [[coral island]]s, of which two, [[West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|West Island]] and [[Home Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Home Island]], are inhabited with a total population of approximately 600.

== Geography ==

The Cocos (Keeling) Islands consist of two flat, low-lying coral atolls with an area of {{convert|14.2|km2|sqmi}}, {{convert|26|km|mi}} of coastline, a highest elevation of {{convert|5|m|ft}} and thickly covered with coconut palms and other vegetation. The climate is pleasant, moderated by the southeast [[trade winds]] for about nine months of the year and with moderate rainfall. [[Cyclone]]s may occur in the early months of the year.

'''[[North Keeling]] Island''' is an atoll consisting of just one C-shaped island, a nearly closed atoll ring with a small opening into the [[lagoon]], about {{convert|50|m|ft}} wide, on the east side. The island measures {{convert|1.1|km2|acre}} in land area and is uninhabited. The lagoon is about {{convert|0.5|km2|acre}}. North Keeling Island and the surrounding sea to {{convert|1.5|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} from shore form the [[Pulu Keeling National Park]], established on 12 December 1995. It is home to the only surviving population of the endemic, and endangered, [[Cocos Buff-banded Rail]].

'''South Keeling Islands''' is an atoll consisting of 24 individual islets forming an incomplete atoll ring, with a total land area of {{convert|13.1|km2|sqmi}}. Only [[Home Island]] and [[West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|West Island]] are populated. The Cocos Malays maintain weekend shacks, referred to as pondoks, on most of the larger islands.

There are no rivers or lakes on either atoll. Fresh water resources are limited to [[Lens (hydrology)|water lenses]] on the larger islands, underground accumulations of rainwater lying above the seawater. These lenses are accessed through shallow bores or wells.

Cocos (Keeling) Island is located on [[Antipodes|the opposite side of the globe]] from [[Corn Island]], Nicaragua, relatively close to [[Cocos Island]], Costa Rica.

===Fauna===
{{main|Fauna of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands}}

===Demographics===
In 2010, the population of the islands is estimated at just over 600.<ref name="cia" /> The population on the two inhabited islands generally is split between the ethnic Europeans on West Island (estimated population 100) and the ethnic [[Cocos Malays|Malays]] on Home Island (estimated population 500). A [[Cocos Islands Malay|Cocos dialect]] of [[Malay language|Malay]] and English are the main languages spoken, and 80% of Cocos Islanders are [[Sunni Muslim]].

== History ==

In 1609, Captain [[William Keeling]] was the first European to see the islands, while serving in the [[East India Company]],<ref name="joshua">[[Joshua Slocum]], "[http://archive.org/stream/sailingalonearou00slocuoft#page/212/mode/2up Sailing Alone Around the World", p. 212]</ref> but they remained uninhabited until the 19th century.

In 1814, a Scottish merchant seaman named Captain John Clunies-Ross stopped briefly at the islands on a trip to India, nailing up a [[Union Jack]] and planning to return and settle on the islands with his family in the future.<ref name="joshua"/>

However, a wealthy Englishman named [[Alexander Hare]] had similar plans, and hired a captain{{spaced ndash}} coincidentally, Clunies-Ross' brother{{spaced ndash}}to bring him and a [[harem]] of forty [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] women to the islands, where he hoped to set up his own private residence.<ref name="joshua"/> Hare had previously served as governor of a colony in [[Borneo]] and found that "he could not confine himself to the tame life that prosy civilisation affords".<ref name="joshua"/>

When Clunies-Ross returned two years later with his wife, children and mother-in-law, and found Hare already established on the island and living with a private harem, a feud grew instantly between the two men.<ref name="joshua"/> Clunies-Ross' eight sailors, "began at once the invasion of the new kingdom to take possession of it, women and all".<ref name="joshua"/><ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4ohwAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA293 ''Some Account of the Keeling Isles'' (October 1830) Gleanings in Science, pp.293–301 ]</ref>

After some time, Hare's women began deserting him, and instead finding themselves mates amongst Clunies-Ross' sailors.<ref>[http://www.clunies-ross.com/ The Clunies-Ross Chronicle]</ref> Disheartened, Hare left the island; he died in [[Bencoolen (city)|Bencoolen]] in 1834.<ref>Morning Post (London) 20/3/1835</ref>

Clunies-Ross' workers were paid in a currency called the [[Cocos rupee]], a currency John Clunies-Ross minted himself that could only be redeemed at the company store.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6730047.stm End of a kingdom]</ref>

On 1 April 1836, {{HMS|Beagle}} under Captain [[Robert FitzRoy]] arrived to take soundings establishing the profile of the atoll as part of the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|survey expedition of the ''Beagle'']]. To the young naturalist [[Charles Darwin]], who was on the ship, the results supported a theory he had developed of how atolls formed, which he later published as ''[[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs]]''. He studied the natural history of the islands and collected specimens.<ref>{{citation |last=Keynes |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Keynes |year=2001 |title=Charles Darwin's Beagle Diary |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1925&pageseq=445 413–418] |accessdate=2009-01-20}}</ref> Darwin's assistant [[Syms Covington]] noted that "an Englishman ''[he was in fact Scottish]'' and HIS family, with about sixty or seventy [[mulatto]]s from the Cape of Good Hope, live on one of the islands. Captain Ross, the governor, is now absent at the Cape."

===Annexation by the British Empire===
The islands were annexed by the British Empire in 1857. This annexation was carried out by [[Thomas Fremantle (Royal Navy officer)#Sons of Thomas Fremantle|Captain Stephen Grenville Fremantle]] in command of {{HMS|Juno|1844|6}}. Fremantle claimed the islands for the British Empire and appointed [[King of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Ross II]] as Superintendent.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Cocos Islands|journal=The Chambers's Journal|year=1899|volume= 76|pages=187–190|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ddUXAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA187}}</ref> In 1867, their administration was placed under the [[Straits Settlements]], which included [[Penang]], [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]]. [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] granted the islands in perpetuity to the [[King of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Clunies-Ross family]] in 1886. The Cocos Islands under the Clunies-Ross family have been cited as an example of a 19th-century [[micronation]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===World War I===
{{main|Battle of Cocos}}
On the morning of 9 November 1914, the islands became the site of the [[Battle of Cocos]], one of the first naval battles of World War I. A landing party from the German cruiser {{SMS|Emden|1906|6}} captured and disabled the wireless and cable communications station on [[Direction Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Direction Island]], but not before the station was able to transmit a distress call. An Allied troop convoy was passing nearby, and the Australian cruiser {{HMAS|Sydney|1912|6}} was detached from the convoy escort to investigate.

''Sydney'' spotted the island and ''Emden'' at 09:15, with both ships preparing for combat. The longer range of ''Emden''{{'}}s guns meant she was able to fire first, but the German ship was unable to inflict disabling damage on the Australian cruiser before ''Sydney'' closed into range and opened up with her more powerful main guns. At 11:20, the heavily damaged ''Emden'' beached herself on [[North Keeling Island]]. The Australian warship broke to pursue ''Emden''{{'}}s supporting [[collier]], which scuttled herself, then returned to North Keeling Island at 16:00. At this point, ''Emden''{{'}}s [[battle ensign]] was still flying: usually a sign that a ship intends to continue fighting. After no response to instructions to lower the ensign, two salvoes were shot into the beached cruiser, after which the Germans lowered the flag and raised a [[flag of surrender|white sheet]]. ''Sydney'' had orders to ascertain the status of the transmission station, but returned the next day to provide medical assistance to the Germans.

134 personnel aboard ''Emden'' were killed, and 69 were wounded, compared to only 4 killed and 16 wounded aboard ''Sydney''. The German survivors were taken aboard the Australian cruiser, which caught up to the troop convoy in Colombo on 15 November, then transported to Malta and handed over to the British Army. An additional 50 German personnel from the shore party, unable to be recovered before ''Sydney'' arrived, commandeered a schooner and escaped from Direction Island, eventually arriving in Constantinople. ''Emden'' was the last active [[Central Powers]] warship in the Indian or Pacific Oceans, which meant troopships from Australia and New Zealand could sail without naval escort, and Allied ships could be deployed elsewhere.

===World War II===
During World War II, the cable station was once again a vital link. Allied planners noted that the islands might be seized as an airfield for [[Nazi Germany|German]] raider cruisers operating in the Indian Ocean.  Following [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s entry into the war, Japanese forces occupied neighbouring islands.  To avoid drawing their attention to the Cocos cable station and its islands' garrison, the [[seaplane]] anchorage between Direction and [[Horsburgh Island|Horsburgh]] islands was not used.  Radio transmitters were also kept silent, except in emergencies.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

After the [[Fall of Singapore]] in 1942, the islands were administered from [[Ceylon]] ([[Sri Lanka]]) and West and Direction Islands were placed under [[Allied]] military administration.  The islands' garrison initially consisted of a platoon from the British Army's [[King's African Rifles]], located on Horsburgh Island, with two {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=4}} guns to cover the anchorage. The local inhabitants all lived on Home Island. Despite the importance of the islands as a communication centre, the Japanese made no attempt either to raid or to occupy them and contented themselves with sending over a reconnaissance aircraft about once a month.

On the night of 8–9 May 1942, 15 members of the garrison, from the [[Ceylon Defence Force]], [[Mutiny|mutinied]] under the leadership of [[Gratien Fernando]].  The mutineers were said to have been provoked by the attitude of their British officers and were also supposedly inspired by [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] beliefs.  They attempted to take control of the [[Artillery|gun battery]] on the islands.  The [[Cocos Islands Mutiny]] was crushed, but the mutineers killed one non-mutinous soldier and wounded one officer.  Seven of the mutineers were sentenced to death at a trial that was later alleged to have been improperly conducted.  Four of the sentences were commuted, but three men were executed, including Fernando.  These were to be the only [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] soldiers executed for mutiny during the Second World War.<ref name=CIM>{{cite book |last=Cruise |first=Noel |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Cocos Islands Mutiny |publisher=Fremantle Arts Centre Press |year=2002 |location=Fremantle |page=248 |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=1-86368-310-0}}</ref>

On 25 December 1942, the Japanese submarine ''[[Japanese submarine I-166|I-166]]'' bombarded the islands but caused no damage.<ref>[http://www.combinedfleet.com/I-166.htm Combinedfleet.com]</ref>

Later in the war, two airstrips were built, and three bomber squadrons were moved to the islands to conduct raids against Japanese targets in South East Asia and to provide support during the [[Operation Tiderace|planned]] reinvasion of [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and reconquest of [[Singapore]].  The first aircraft to arrive were [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mk VIIIs of [[No. 136 Squadron RAF]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Fail|first=J.E.H.|title=FORWARD STRATEGIC AIR BASE  COCOS ISLAND|url=http://www.rquirk.com/cocos/cocosart.htm|work=www.rquirk.com|accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref> They included some [[B-24|Liberator]] bombers from [[No. 321 Squadron RAF|No. 321 (Netherlands) Squadron RAF]] (members of exiled Dutch forces serving with the [[Royal Air Force]]), which were also stationed on the islands.  When in July 1945 [[No. 99 Squadron RAF|No. 99]] and [[No. 356 Squadron RAF|No. 356]] RAF squadrons arrived on West Island, they brought with them a daily newspaper called ''Atoll'' which contained news of what was happening in the outside world.  Run by airmen in their off-duty hours, it achieved fame when dropped by Liberator bombers on POW camps over the heads of the Japanese guards.  In 1946, the administration of the islands reverted to Singapore.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Transfer to Australia===
On 23 November 1955, the islands were transferred to Australian control under the ''Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955'' (an Australian Act) pursuant to the ''Cocos Islands Act, 1955'' (a UK Act).<ref>{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1977/jun/28/cocos-keeling-islands#S5CV0934P0-05978 | house=House of Commons | date=28 June 1977 }}</ref> Mr H J Hull was appointed the first Official Representative (now Administrator) of the new Territory. He had been a Lieutenant-Commander in the Royal Australian Navy and was released for the purpose. Under Commonwealth Cabinet Decision 1573 of 9 September 1958, Mr Hull's appointment was terminated and [[John William Stokes]] was appointed on secondment from the Northern Territory Police. A media release at the end of October 1958 by the Minister for Territories, Mr Hasluck, commended Mr Hull's three years of service on Cocos.

Stokes served in the position from 31 October 1958 to 30 September 1960. His son's boyhood memories and photos of the Islands have been published.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stokes |first=Tony |title=Whatever Will Be, I'll See: Growing Up in the 1940s, 50s and 60s in the Northern Territory, Christmas and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory |year=2012 |publisher=Tony Stokes |isbn=9780646575643 |pages=238}}</ref> C.I. Buffett [[MBE]] from [[Norfolk Island]] succeeded him and served from 28 July 1960 to 30 June 1966, and later acted as Administrator back on Cocos and on Norfolk Island. In 1974, Ken Mullen wrote a small book<ref>Cocos Keeling, the islands time forgot (1974). Ken Mullen. published by Angus & Robertson, Sydney. 122 pages.</ref> about his time with wife and son from 1964 to 1966 working at the Cable Station on Direction Island.

In the 1970s, the Australian government's dissatisfaction with the Clunies-Ross feudal style of rule of the island increased. In 1978, Australia forced the family to sell the islands for the sum of A$6,250,000, using the threat of compulsory acquisition. By agreement, the family retained ownership of Oceania House, their home on the island. However, in 1983, the Australian government reneged on this agreement, and told [[John Clunies-Ross]] that he should leave the Cocos. The following year the [[High Court of Australia]] ruled that resumption of Oceania House was unlawful, but the Australian government ordered that no government business was to be granted to Clunies-Ross's shipping company, an action that contributed to his bankruptcy. John Clunies-Ross now lives in Perth, Western Australia. However, some members of the Clunies-Ross family still live on the Cocos.

Extensive preparations were undertaken by the government of Australia to prepare the Cocos Malays to vote in their referendum of self-determination. Discussions began in 1982, with an aim of holding the referendum, under United Nations supervision, in mid-1983. Under guidelines developed by the UN Decolonization Committee, residents were to be offered 3 choices: full independence, free association, or integration with Australia. The latter was preferred by both the islanders and the Australian government. However, a change in government in Canberra following the March 1983 Australian elections delayed the vote by one year. While the Home Island Council stated a preference for a traditional communal consensus "vote", the UN insisted on a secret ballot. The vote was held on 6 April 1984, with all 261 eligible islanders participating, including the Clunies-Ross family: 229 voted for integration, 21 for Free Association, 9 for independence, and 2 failed to indicate a preference.<ref>Kenneth Chen, "Pacific Island Development Plan: Cocos (Keeling) Islands- The Political Evolution of a Small Island Territory in the Indian Ocean" (1987): Mr Chen was Administrator, Cocos Islands, from December 1983 – November 1985.</ref>

The 2004 earthquake and tsunami centered off the western shore of Sumatra, Indonesia, prompted early worries about the Cocos, but no casualties were reported (see [[Countries affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]).

The Act also gives Western Australian courts judicial power over the islands. The Cocos Islands remain constitutionally distinct from Western Australia, however; the power of the state to legislate for the territory is power delegated by the federal government. The kind of services typically provided by a state government elsewhere in Australia are provided by departments of the Western Australian Government, and by contractors, with the costs met by the federal government.

There also exists a unicameral [[Shire of Cocos|Cocos (Keeling) Islands Shire Council]] with seven seats. A full term lasts four years, though elections are held every two years; approximately half the members retire each two years. Federally, Cocos (Keeling) Islanders form the electorate of [[Division of Lingiari|Lingiari]] with Christmas Island and outback Northern Territory.

The islands have a five-person police force but their defence remains the responsibility of Australia.<ref name="cia"/>

== Economy ==

There is a small and growing tourist industry focused on water-based or nature activities.

Small local gardens and fishing contribute to the food supply, but most food and most other necessities must be imported from Australia or elsewhere.

The Cocos Islands Cooperative Society Ltd. employs construction workers, [[stevedore]]s, and lighterage worker operations. Tourism employs others.

The Cocos Islands are geostrategically important because of their proximity to [[Indian Ocean]] and [[South China Sea]] shipping lanes.<ref name=wsws /> The United States Armed Forces have planned to construct airbases on the Cocos Islands, capable of supporting drone-based espionage and surveillance over the South China Sea.<ref name="post">Whitlock, Craig, "[http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-to-expand-ties-with-australia-as-it-aims-to-shift-forces-closer-to-se-asia/2012/03/19/gIQAPSXlcS_story.html U.S., Australia to broaden military ties amid Pentagon pivot to SE Asia]", ''[[The Washington Post]],'' 26 March 2012.</ref> [[Euronews]] described the plan as providing Australian support for increased American presence in Southeast Asia, but likely to upset Chinese officials.<ref name="euro">Grubel, James, "[http://www.euronews.com/newswires/1459124-australia-open-to-us-spy-flights-from-indian-ocean-island/ Australia open to US spy flights from Indian Ocean]." {{dead link|date=July 2012}} [[Euronews]], 28 March 2012.</ref> James Cogan has written for the [[World Socialist Web Site]] that airbase construction at Cocos is one component of Obama's "pivot" towards Asia, facilitating control of the sea lanes between the Indian and Pacific Oceans and potentially allowing US forces to enforce a blockade against China.<ref name="wsws">Cogan, James, "[http://wsws.org/articles/2012/apr2012/darw-a14.shtml US Marines begin operations in northern Australia]."

== Communications and transport ==

The islands are connected within Australia's telecommunication system (with number range +61 8 9162 xxxx) and postal system ([[Postal code|post code]]: 6799). Public phones are located on both West Island and Home Island. A reasonably reliable GSM mobile phone network (number range +61 406 xxx), run by CiiA (Christmas Island Internet Association), operates on Cocos (Keeling) Islands.  SIM cards (full size) and recharge cards can be purchased from the Telecentre on West Island to access this service.  There is one paved airport on the West Island, [[Cocos (Keeling) Island International Airport]], to which [[Virgin Australia]] operates scheduled jet services from Perth, Western Australia via Christmas Island.  There is also a lagoon anchorage between Horsburgh and Direction islands for larger vessels, while yachts have a dedicated anchorage area in the southern lee of Direction Island.

After 1952, the airport at Cocos Islands was a stop for airline flights between Australia and South Africa, and Qantas and South African Airways stopped there to refuel. The arrival of long range jet aircraft ended this need in 1967.

===Internet===
[[.cc]] is the Internet country code top-level domain ([[ccTLD]]) for Cocos (Keeling) Islands. It is administered by VeriSign through a subsidiary company eNIC, which promotes it for international registration as "the next .com"; .cc was originally assigned in October 1997 to eNIC Corporation of Seattle WA by the IANA.  The [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] also uses the .cc domain, along with .nc.tr.

Internet access on Cocos is provided by CiiA (Christmas Island Internet Association), and is supplied via satellite ground station on West Island, and distributed via a wireless PPPoE-based WAN on both inhabited islands.  Casual internet access is available at the Telecentre on West Island, and the Indian Ocean Group Training office on Home Island.

It was announced in early 2012 that the [[National Broadband Network]] would be extended to Cocos in 2015 via high speed satellite link.<ref name="Gizmodo">Kidman, Alex, "[http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/02/nbn-to-launch-satellites-in-2015/]." ''[[Gizmodo]]'', 8 February 2012.</ref>

== Media ==

The Cocos (Keeling) Islands have access to a range of modern communication services. Four television stations broadcast from Western Australia via satellite. These are ABC, SBS, WIN and GWN. A local radio station, 6CKI – Voice of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, is staffed by community volunteers and provides some local content.

* [[ABC1]]
* [[SBS One]]
* [[WIN Television]] (Affiliate of [[STW|Nine Network Perth]])

== Education ==

There is a school in the archipelago, Cocos Islands District High School, with campuses located on West Island (Kindergarten to Year 10), and the other on Home Island (Kindergarten to Year 6).  CIDHS is part of the Western Australia education 
School instruction is in English on both campuses, with Cocos Malay teacher aides assisting the younger children in Kindergarten, Pre-Preparatory and early Primary with the English curriculum on the Home Island Campus.  English is encouraged, rather than Cocos Malay being discouraged.
