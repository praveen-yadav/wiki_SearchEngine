'''''Bar Kokhba''''' is a [[double album]] by [[John Zorn]], recorded between 1994 and 1996.<ref>[http://www.tzadik.com/index.php?catalog=7108-2 Tzadik catalogue]</ref> It features music from Zorn's ''[[Masada (band)|Masada]]'' project, rearranged for small ensembles.

==Reception==
The [[Allmusic]] review by Marc Gilman awarded the album 4Â½ stars noting that "While some compositions retain their original structure and sound, some are expanded and probed by Zorn's arrangements, and resemble avant-garde classical music more than jazz. But this is the beauty of the album; the ensembles provide a forum for Zorn to expand his compositions. The album consistently impresses".<ref name="Allmusic">Gilman, M.
