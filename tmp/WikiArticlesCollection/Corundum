'''Corundum''' is a [[crystal]]line form of [[aluminium oxide]] ({{chem|Al|2|O|3}}) with traces of [[iron]], [[titanium]] and [[chromium]].<ref name=Handbook/> It is a [[rock (geology)|rock]]-forming [[mineral]]. It is one of the naturally clear [[transparent materials]], but can have different colors when impurities are present. [[Transparent alumina|Transparent]] specimens are used as [[Gemstone|gem]]s, called [[ruby]] if [[red]] and [[Sapphire#Padparadscha|padparadscha]] if pink-orange. All other colors are called [[sapphire]], e.g., "green sapphire" for a green specimen. 

The name "corundum" is derived from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word ''kuruntam'' (குருந்தம்)  meaning "ruby", and related to [[Sanskrit]] ''kuruvinda''.<ref name=Webmin/>

Because of corundum's hardness (pure corundum is defined to have 9.0 [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs]]), it can scratch almost every other [[mineral]]. It is commonly used as an [[abrasive]], on everything from [[sandpaper]] to large machines used in machining metals, plastics, and wood. Some [[Emery (mineral)|emery]] is a mix of corundum and other substances, and the mix is less [[abrasive]], with an average [[hardness]] near 8.0. 

In addition to its hardness, corundum is unusual for its [[density]] of 4.02 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which is very high for a transparent mineral composed of the low [[atomic mass]] elements [[aluminium]] and [[oxygen]].<ref>[http://www.galleries.com/minerals/oxides/corundum/corundum.htm Mineral Galleries]</ref>

==Geology and occurrence==
[[Image:Corindon azulEZ.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Corundum from [[Brazil]], size about {{convert|2|×|3|cm|in|sigfig=1}}.]]
Corundum occurs as a mineral in mica [[schist]], [[gneiss]], and some [[marble]]s in [[metamorphic]] [[terranes]]. It also occurs in low silica [[igneous]] [[syenite]] and [[nepheline syenite]] [[intrusive]]s. Other occurrences are as masses adjacent to [[ultramafic]] intrusives, associated with [[lamprophyre]] [[Dike (geology)|dikes]] and as large crystals in [[pegmatite]]s.<ref name=Hurlbut/> It commonly occurs as a [[detrital]] mineral in stream and beach sands because of its hardness and resistance to weathering.<ref name=Hurlbut/> The largest documented single crystal of corundum measured about {{convert/3|65|×|40|×|40|cm|in}}, and weighed 152 kg (335 pounds).<ref>{{cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| pages = 885–907| year= 1981| title= The largest crystals| author = P. C. Rickwood}}</ref> The record has since been surpassed by certain synthetic boules.<ref>[http://www.ledinside.com/news/2009/4/Rubicon_Technology_Grows_Super_boule_of_200kg_Weight_20090421 ''Rubicon Technology Grows 200kg “Super Boule”,'' LED Inside, April 21, 2009]</ref>

Corundum for abrasives is mined in [[Zimbabwe]], [[Russia]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[India]]. Historically it was mined from deposits associated with [[dunite]]s in [[North Carolina]], [[United States|USA]] and from a [[nepheline syenite]] in [[Craigmont, Ontario]].<ref name=Hurlbut/> [[Emery (mineral)|Emery]] grade corundum is found on the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Naxos (Crete)|Naxos]] and near [[Peekskill, New York]], USA. Abrasive corundum is synthetically manufactured from [[bauxite]].<ref name=Hurlbut/> 4 corundum axes dating back to 2500 B.C.E from the Liangzhou culture have been discovered in China. The surfaces of the axes are so polished they act as mirrors; researchers were unable to replicate this level of polishing even using the best of modern methods. <ref> {{cite web|url=ttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4555235.stm|title=Chinese made first use of diamond|publisher=BBC|date=May 2005|accessdate=December 1st 2013}} </ref>

==Synthetic corundum==
In 1837, [[Marc Antoine Auguste Gaudin|Marc Antoine Gaudin]] made the first synthetic rubies by fusing [[alumina]] at a high temperature with a small amount of [[chromium]] as a pigment.<ref>{{cite journal| url = http://www.gem-a.com/media/94808/duroc%20danner%20website.pdf | journal = Journal of Gemmology| volume = 32| pages = 175–178|year= 2011| title=Untreated yellowish orange sapphire exhibiting its natural colour| author = J. M. Duroc-Danner}}</ref>  In 1847, [[Jacques-Joseph Ebelmen|Ebelmen]] made white sapphires by fusing [[Aluminum oxide|alumina]] in [[boric acid]]. In 1877 Frenic and Freil made crystal corundum from which small stones could be cut. Frimy and [[Auguste Verneuil]] manufactured artificial ruby by fusing [[Barium fluoride|{{chem|BaF|2}}]] and {{chem|Al|2|O|3}} with a little chromium at temperatures above {{convert|2000|C|0|abbr=on}}. In 1903, Verneuil announced he could produce synthetic rubies on a commercial scale using this [[flame fusion]] process.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_067|title = Bahadur: a Handbook of Precious Stones|year = 1943|accessdate = 2007-08-19}}</ref>

The [[Verneuil process]] allows the production of flawless single-crystal [[sapphire]]s, [[ruby|rubies]] and other corundum gems of much larger size than normally found in nature. It is also possible to grow gem-quality synthetic corundum by flux-growth and [[hydrothermal synthesis]]. Because of the simplicity of the methods involved in corundum synthesis, large quantities of these crystals have become available on the market causing a significant reduction of price in recent years. Apart from ornamental uses, synthetic corundum is also used to produce mechanical parts (tubes, rods, bearings, and other machined parts), scratch-resistant optics, scratch-resistant [[Watch#Overview|watch crystals]], instrument windows for satellites and spacecraft (because of its transparency from the UV to IR), and [[laser]] components.
