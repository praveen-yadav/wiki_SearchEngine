The yellow sphere is the [[redox|redox-active]] sulfur atom that provides antioxidant activity, while the red, blue, white, and dark grey spheres represent oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon atoms, respectively.]]

An '''antioxidant''' is a [[molecule]] that inhibits the [[Redox|oxidation]] of other molecules. Oxidation is a [[chemical reaction]] that transfers [[electron]]s or hydrogen from a substance to an [[oxidizing agent]]. Oxidation reactions can produce [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]].  In turn, these radicals can start [[chain reaction]]s.  When the chain reaction occurs in a [[cell (biology)|cell]], it can cause damage or death to the cell.  Antioxidants terminate these chain reactions by removing free radical intermediates, and inhibit other oxidation reactions. They do this by being oxidized themselves, so antioxidants are often [[reducing agent]]s such as [[thiol]]s, [[ascorbic acid]], or [[polyphenol antioxidant|polyphenols]].<ref name="Sies" />

[[Image:Antioxidant.png|thumb|right|250px|Substituted [[phenol]]s and derivatives of [[p-Phenylenediamine|phenylenediamine]] are common antioxidants used to inhibit gum formation in gasoline (petrol).]]

Although oxidation reactions are crucial for life, they can also be damaging; plants and animals maintain complex systems of multiple types of antioxidants, such as [[glutathione]], [[vitamin C]], [[vitamin A]], and [[vitamin E]] as well as [[enzyme]]s such as [[catalase]], [[superoxide dismutase]] and various [[peroxidase]]s. Insufficient levels of antioxidants, or [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibition]] of the antioxidant enzymes, cause [[oxidative stress]] and may damage or kill cells. Oxidative stress is damage to cell structure and cell function by overly reactive oxygen-containing molecules and chronic excessive inflammation. Oxidative stress seems to play a significant role in many human diseases, including cancers. The use of antioxidants in [[pharmacology]] is intensively studied, particularly as treatments for stroke and [[neurodegenerative disease]]s.  For these reasons, oxidative stress can be considered to be both the cause and the consequence of some diseases.

Antioxidants are widely used in [[dietary supplement]]s and have been investigated for the prevention of diseases such as cancer, [[coronary heart disease]] and even [[altitude sickness]]. Although initial studies suggested that antioxidant supplements might promote health, later large [[clinical trial]]s with a limited number of antioxidants detected no benefit and even suggested that excess supplementation with certain putative antioxidants may be harmful.<ref name="cardivascular review">{{cite journal|last=Jha|first=Prabhat|coauthors=Marcus Flather, Eva Lonn, Michael Farkouh, and Salim Yusuf|title=The Antioxidant Vitamins and Cardiovascular Disease: A Critical Review of Epidemiologic and Clinical Trial Data|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|year=1995|volume=123|issue=11|pages=860–872|url=http://www.annals.org/content/123/11/860.short|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-123-11-199512010-00009|pmid=7486470}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pages=341–8 |doi=10.1093/qjmed/hcp026 |title=Oral antioxidant supplementation does not prevent acute mountain sickness: double blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial |year=2009 |last1=Baillie |first1=J.K. |last2=Thompson |first2=A.A.R. |last3=Irving |first3=J.B. |last4=Bates |first4=M.G.D. |last5=Sutherland |first5=A.I. |last6=MacNee |first6=W. |last7=Maxwell |first7=S.R.J. |last8=Webb |first8=D.J. |journal=QJM |volume=102 |issue=5 |pmid=19273551}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bjelakovic G |title=Mortality in randomized trials of antioxidant supplements for primary and secondary prevention: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=8 |pages=842–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17327526 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842 |last2=Nikolova |first2=D |last3=Gluud |first3=LL |last4=Simonetti |first4=RG |last5=Gluud |first5=C}}</ref>  Antioxidants also have many industrial uses, such as [[preservative]]s in food and cosmetics and to prevent the degradation of rubber and gasoline.<ref name=Ullmann>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/14356007.a16_719.pub2|chapter=Automotive Fuels|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2007|last1=Dabelstein|first1=Werner|last2=Reglitzky|first2=Arno|last3=Schütze|first3=Andrea|last4=Reders|first4=Klaus|isbn=3527306730}}</ref>

== History ==
As part of their adaptation from marine life, terrestrial plants began producing non-marine antioxidants such as [[ascorbic acid]] ([[Vitamin C]]), [[polyphenol oxidant|polyphenols]] and [[tocopherol]]s.  The evolution of [[angiosperm]] plants between 50 and 200 million years ago resulted in the development of many antioxidant pigments&nbsp;– particularly during the [[Jurassic]] period&nbsp;– as chemical defences against [[reactive oxygen species]] that are byproducts of [[photosynthesis]].<ref>{{cite journal |pages=113–26 |doi=10.1016/S1095-6433(02)00368-9 |title=Evolution of dietary antioxidants |year=2003 |last1=Benzie |first1=I |journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology |volume=136 |pmid=14527634 |issue=1}}</ref> Originally, the term antioxidant specifically referred to a chemical that prevented the consumption of oxygen. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, extensive study concentrated on the use of antioxidants in important industrial processes, such as the prevention of metal [[corrosion]], the [[vulcanization]] of rubber, and the [[polymerization]] of fuels in the [[fouling]] of [[internal combustion engine]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=177–92 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.16.070147.001141 |title=Antioxidants |year=1947 |last1=Mattill |first1=H A |journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry |volume=16 |pmid=20259061}}</ref>

Early research on the role of antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of [[unsaturated fat]]s, which is the cause of [[rancidity]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10335367 |year=1999 |last1=German |first1=JB |title=Food processing and lipid oxidation |volume=459 |pages=23–50 |journal=Advances in experimental medicine and biology |doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-4853-9_3 |series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology |isbn=978-0-306-46051-7}}</ref> Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption.

A [[paradox]] in [[metabolism]] is that, while the vast majority of complex [[life on Earth]] requires [[oxygen]] for its existence, oxygen is a highly reactive molecule that damages living organisms by producing [[reactive oxygen species]].<ref name="Davies">{{cite journal |pmid=8660387 |year=1995 |last1=Davies |first1=KJ |title=Oxidative stress: The paradox of aerobic life |volume=61 |pages=1–31 |journal=Biochemical Society Symposia}}</ref> Consequently, organisms contain a complex network of antioxidant [[metabolite]]s and [[enzyme]]s that work together to prevent oxidative damage to cellular components such as [[DNA]], [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s.<ref name="Sies">{{cite journal |last1=Sies |first1=Helmut |pmid=9129943 |url=http://ep.physoc.org/content/82/2/291.long |year=1997 |title=Oxidative stress: Oxidants and antioxidants |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=291–5 |journal=Experimental physiology}}</ref><ref name="Vertuani">{{cite journal |pages=1677–94 |doi=10.2174/1381612043384655 |title=The Antioxidants and Pro-Antioxidants Network: An Overview |year=2004 |last1=Vertuani |first1=Silvia |last2=Angusti |first2=Angela |last3=Manfredini |first3=Stefano |journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design |volume=10 |issue=14 |pmid=15134565}}</ref> In general, antioxidant systems either prevent these reactive species from being formed, or remove them before they can damage vital components of the cell.<ref name="Sies" /><ref name="Davies" /> However, reactive oxygen species also have useful cellular functions, such as [[redox signaling]].

== Metabolites ==

=== Overview ===
Antioxidants are classified into two broad divisions, depending on whether they are soluble in water ([[hydrophile|hydrophilic]]) or in lipids ([[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]]). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell [[cytosol]] and the [[blood plasma]], while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect [[cell membrane]]s from lipid peroxidation.<ref name="Sies" /> These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet.<ref name="Vertuani" /> The different antioxidants are present at a wide range of concentrations in [[Bodily fluid|body fluids]] and tissues, with some such as glutathione or [[ubiquinone]] mostly present within cells, while others such as [[uric acid]] are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in [[pathogen]]s and can be [[virulence factor]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8993856 |year=1997 |last1=Miller |first1=RA |last2=Britigan |first2=BE |title=Role of oxidants in microbial pathophysiology |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |pmc=172912 |journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews}}</ref>

The relative importance and interactions between these different antioxidants is a very complex question, with the various metabolites and enzyme systems having [[synergy|synergistic]] and interdependent effects on one another.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=949–62 |doi=10.1016/S0278-6915(99)00090-3 |title=Intracellular Antioxidants: From Chemical to Biochemical Mechanisms |year=1999 |last1=Chaudiere |first1=J |journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology |volume=37 |issue=9–10 |pmid=10541450 |last2=Ferrari-Iliou |first2=R}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pages=213–9 |doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18025.x |title=Strategies of antioxidant defense |year=1993 |last1=Sies |first1=Helmut |journal=European Journal of Biochemistry |volume=215 |issue=2 |pmid=7688300}}</ref> The action of one antioxidant may therefore depend on the proper function of other members of the antioxidant system.<ref name="Vertuani" /> The amount of protection provided by any one antioxidant will also depend on its concentration, its reactivity towards the particular reactive oxygen species being considered, and the status of the antioxidants with which it interacts.<ref name="Vertuani" />

Some compounds contribute to antioxidant defense by [[chelation|chelating]] [[transition metal]]s and preventing them from catalyzing the production of free radicals in the cell. Particularly important is the ability to sequester iron, which is the function of [[iron-binding proteins]] such as [[transferrin]] and [[ferritin]].<ref name="Pathways Ofoxidativedamage"/> [[Selenium]] and [[zinc]] are commonly referred to as ''antioxidant nutrients'', but these [[chemical element]]s have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is discussed below.

That is,  paradoxically,  agents which are normally considered antioxidants can act as conditional [[pro-oxidant]]s and actually increase oxidative stress.  Besides ascorbate, medically important conditional pro-oxidants include uric acid and sulfhydryl amino acids such as [[homocysteine]].  Typically,  this involves some transition-series metal such as copper or iron as catalyst.  The potential role of the pro-oxidant role of uric acid in (e.g.) atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke is considered above.  Another example is the postulated role of [[homocysteine]] in atherosclerosis.

== Enzyme systems ==
[[Image:Antioxidant pathway.svg|thumb|right|Enzymatic pathway for detoxification of reactive oxygen species.]]

=== Overview ===
As with the chemical antioxidants, cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes.<ref name="Sies" /><ref name="Davies" /> Here, the superoxide released by processes such as [[oxidative phosphorylation]] is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water. This detoxification pathway is the result of multiple enzymes, with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen peroxide. As with antioxidant metabolites, the contributions of these enzymes to antioxidant defenses can be hard to separate from one another, but the generation of [[Genetically modified organism|transgenic mice]] lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be informative.<ref name=Magnenat>{{cite journal |author=Ho YS, Magnenat JL, Gargano M, Cao J |title=The nature of antioxidant defense mechanisms: a lesson from transgenic studies |journal=Environ.

Although some levels of antioxidant vitamins and minerals in the diet are required for good health, there is considerable doubt as to whether  antioxidant supplements are beneficial or harmful; and if they are actually beneficial, which antioxidant(s) are needed and in what amounts.<ref name="Stanner" /><ref name="Shenkin">{{cite journal |author=Shenkin A |title=The key role of micronutrients |journal=Clin Nutr |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |year=2006 |pmid=16376462 |doi=10.1016/j.clnu.2005.11.006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Woodside J, McCall D, McGartland C, Young I |title=Micronutrients: dietary intake v. supplement use |journal=Proc Nutr Soc |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=543–53 |year=2005 |pmid=16313697 |doi=10.1079/PNS2005464}}</ref> Indeed, some authors argue that the hypothesis that antioxidants could prevent chronic diseases has now been disproved and that the idea was misguided from the beginning.<ref name=Hail>{{cite journal |author=Hail N, Cortes M, Drake EN, Spallholz JE |title=Cancer chemoprevention: a radical perspective |journal=Free Radic.

=== Physical exercise ===
During exercise, oxygen consumption can increase by a factor of more than 10.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dekkers J, van Doornen L, Kemper H |title=The role of antioxidant vitamins and enzymes in the prevention of exercise-induced muscle damage |journal=Sports Med |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=213–38 |year=1996 |pmid=8776010 |doi=10.2165/00007256-199621030-00005}}</ref> This leads to a large increase in the production of oxidants and results in damage that contributes to muscular fatigue during and after exercise. The [[Delayed onset muscle soreness|inflammatory response]] that occurs after strenuous exercise is also associated with oxidative stress, especially in the 24 hours after an exercise session. The immune system response to the damage done by exercise peaks 2 to 7 days after exercise, which is the period during which most of the adaptation that leads to greater fitness occurs. During this process, free radicals are produced by [[neutrophil]]s to remove damaged tissue. As a result, excessive antioxidant levels may inhibit recovery and adaptation mechanisms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tiidus P |title=Radical species in inflammation and overtraining |url=http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?issn=0008-4212&volume=76&issue=5&startPage=533 |journal=[[Can J Physiol Pharmacol]] |volume=76 |issue=5 |pages=533–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9839079 |doi=10.1139/cjpp-76-5-533}}</ref> Antioxidant supplements may also prevent any of the health gains that normally come from exercise, such as increased [[insulin sensitivity]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ristow M, Zarse K, Oberbach A |title=Antioxidants prevent health-promoting effects of physical exercise in humans |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume= 106|issue= 21|pages= 8665–70|year=2009 |pmc=2680430 |pmid=19433800 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0903485106}}</ref>

The evidence for benefits from antioxidant supplementation in vigorous exercise is mixed. There is strong evidence that one of the adaptations resulting from exercise is a strengthening of the body's antioxidant defenses, particularly the glutathione system, to regulate the increased oxidative stress.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leeuwenburgh C, Fiebig R, Chandwaney R, Ji L |title=Aging and exercise training in skeletal muscle: responses of glutathione and antioxidant enzyme systems |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/267/2/R439 |journal=Am J Physiol |volume=267 |issue=2 Pt 2 |pages=R439–45 |year=1994 |pmid=8067452}}</ref> This effect may be to some extent protective against diseases which are associated with oxidative stress, which would provide a partial explanation for the lower incidence of major diseases and better health of those who undertake regular exercise.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leeuwenburgh C, Heinecke J |title=Oxidative stress and antioxidants in exercise |journal=Curr Med Chem |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=829–38 |year=2001 |pmid=11375753 |doi=10.2174/0929867013372896}}</ref>

A review published in Sports Medicine looked at 150 studies on antioxidant supplementation during exercise. The review found that even studies that found a reduction in oxidative stress failed to demonstrate benefits to performance or prevention of muscle damage.

Other antioxidants are not vitamins and are instead made in the body. For example, [[ubiquinol]] (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made in humans through the [[mevalonate pathway]].<ref name="Turunen" /> Another example is [[glutathione]], which is made from amino acids. As any glutathione in the gut is broken down to free cysteine, [[glycine]] and [[glutamic acid]] before being absorbed, even large oral doses have little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Witschi A, Reddy S, Stofer B, Lauterburg B |title=The systemic availability of oral glutathione |journal=Eur J Clin Pharmacol |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=667–9 |year=1992 |pmid=1362956 |doi=10.1007/BF02284971}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Flagg EW, Coates RJ, Eley JW |title=Dietary glutathione intake in humans and the relationship between intake and plasma total glutathione level |journal=Nutr Cancer |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=33–46 |year=1994 |pmid=8183721 |doi=10.1080/01635589409514302}}</ref> Although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as [[acetylcysteine]] can increase glutathione,<ref name=Dodd>{{cite journal |author=Dodd S, Dean O, Copolov DL, Malhi GS, Berk M |title=N-acetylcysteine for antioxidant therapy: pharmacology and clinical utility |journal=Expert Opin Biol Ther |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=1955–62 |year=2008|pmid=18990082 |doi=10.1517/14728220802517901}}</ref> no evidence exists that eating high levels of these glutathione precursors is beneficial for healthy adults.<ref>{{cite journal |author=van de Poll MC, Dejong CH, Soeters PB |title=Adequate range for sulfur-containing amino acids and biomarkers for their excess: lessons from enteral and parenteral nutrition |journal=J.

Other compounds in the diet can alter the levels of antioxidants by acting as [[pro-oxidant]]s. Here, consuming the compound causes oxidative stress, which the body responds to by inducing higher levels of antioxidant defenses such as antioxidant enzymes.<ref name=Hail/> Some of these compounds, such as [[isothiocyanate]]s and [[curcumin]], may be [[Chemoprophylaxis|chemopreventive]] agents that either block the transformation of abnormal cells into cancerous cells, or even kill existing cancer cells.<ref name=Hail/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Pan MH, Ho CT |title=Chemopreventive effects of natural dietary compounds on cancer development |journal=Chem Soc Rev |volume=37 |issue=11 |pages=2558–74 |year=2008 |pmid=18949126 |doi=10.1039/b801558a}}</ref>

== Uses in technology ==

=== Food preservatives ===
Antioxidants are used as [[food additive]]s to help [[preservative|guard against food deterioration]]. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping in the dark and sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers. However, as oxygen is also important for plant [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], storing plant materials in [[Anaerobic organism#Metabolism|anaerobic]] conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kader A, Zagory D, Kerbel E |title=Modified atmosphere packaging of fruits and vegetables |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=1–30 |year=1989 |pmid=2647417 |doi=10.1080/10408398909527490}}</ref> Consequently, packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. Antioxidants are an especially important class of preservatives as, unlike bacterial or [[fungus|fungal]] spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zallen E, Hitchcock M, Goertz G |title=Chilled food systems. Effects of chilled holding on quality of beef loaves |journal=J Am Diet Assoc |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=552–7 |year=1975 |pmid=1184900}}</ref> These preservatives include natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (AA, E300) and tocopherols (E306), as well as synthetic antioxidants such as [[propyl gallate]] (PG, E310), [[tert-Butylhydroquinone|tertiary butylhydroquinone]] (TBHQ), [[butylated hydroxyanisole]] (BHA, E320) and [[butylated hydroxytoluene]] (BHT, E321).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Iverson F |title=Phenolic antioxidants: Health Protection Branch studies on butylated hydroxyanisole |journal=Cancer Lett |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=49–54 |year=1995 |pmid=7600543 |doi=10.1016/0304-3835(95)03787-W}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=E number index |publisher=UK food guide|url=http://www.ukfoodguide.net/enumeric.htm#antioxidants |accessdate=5 March 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070304151341/http://www.ukfoodguide.net/enumeric.htm| archivedate= 4 March 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The most common molecules attacked by oxidation are unsaturated fats; oxidation causes them to turn [[rancidification|rancid]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Robards K, Kerr A, Patsalides E |title=Rancidity and its measurement in edible oils and snack foods. A review |journal=Analyst |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=213–24 |year=1988 |pmid=3288002 |doi=10.1039/an9881300213}}</ref> Since oxidized lipids are often discolored and usually have unpleasant tastes such as metallic or [[sulfur]]ous flavors, it is important to avoid oxidation in fat-rich foods. Thus, these foods are rarely preserved by drying; instead, they are preserved by [[Smoking (cooking technique)|smoking]], [[salting (food)|salting]] or [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]]. Even less fatty foods such as fruits are sprayed with sulfurous antioxidants prior to air drying. Oxidation is often catalyzed by metals, which is why fats such as butter should never be wrapped in [[aluminium foil]] or kept in metal containers. Some fatty foods such as olive oil are partially protected from oxidation by their natural content of antioxidants, but remain sensitive to photooxidation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Del Carlo M, Sacchetti G, Di Mattia C, Compagnone D, Mastrocola D, Liberatore L, Cichelli A |title=Contribution of the phenolic fraction to the antioxidant activity and oxidative stability of olive oil |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry |volume=52 |issue=13 |pages=4072–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15212450 |doi=10.1021/jf049806z}}</ref> Antioxidant preservatives are also added to fat-based cosmetics such as lipstick and [[moisturizer]]s to prevent rancidity.

=== Industrial uses ===
Antioxidants are frequently added to industrial products. A common use is as [[Gasoline additive|stabilizers]] in [[fuel]]s and [[lubricant]]s to prevent oxidation, and in gasolines to prevent the polymerization that leads to the formation of engine-fouling residues.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=3233–7 |doi=10.1021/ja01617a026 |year=1955 |last1=Boozer |first1=Charles E. |last2=Hammond |first2=George S. |last3=Hamilton |first3=Chester E. |last4=Sen |first4=Jyotirindra N. |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=77 |issue=12 |title=Air Oxidation of Hydrocarbons.1II. The Stoichiometry and Fate of Inhibitors in Benzene and Chlorobenzene}}</ref> In 2007, the worldwide market for industrial antioxidants had a total volume of around 0.88 million tons. This created a revenue of circa 3.7 billion US-dollars (2.4 billion Euros).<ref>{{cite web|title = Market Study: Antioxidants|publisher = Ceresana Research|url = http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/additives/antioxidants/ }}</ref>

They are widely used to prevent the oxidative degradation of [[polymer]]s such as rubbers, plastics and [[adhesive]]s that causes a loss of strength and flexibility in these materials.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why use Antioxidants? |publisher=SpecialChem Adhesives|url=http://www.specialchem4adhesives.com/tc/antioxidants/index.aspx?id= |accessdate=27 February 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070211063739/http://www.specialchem4adhesives.com/tc/antioxidants/index.aspx?id=| archivedate= 11 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Polymers containing [[double bond]]s in their main chains, such as [[natural rubber]] and [[polybutadiene]], are especially susceptible to [[oxidation]] and [[ozonolysis]]. They can be protected by [[antiozonant]]s. Solid polymer products start to crack on exposed surfaces as the material degrades and the chains break. The mode of cracking varies between oxygen and [[ozone]] attack, the former causing a "crazy paving" effect, while ozone attack produces deeper cracks aligned at right angles to the tensile strain in the product.  Oxidation and [[UV degradation]] are also frequently linked, mainly because [[UV radiation]] creates free radicals by bond breakage. The free radicals then react with oxygen to produce [[peroxy]] radicals which cause yet further damage, often in a [[chain reaction]]. Other polymers susceptible to oxidation include [[polypropylene]] and [[polyethylene]]. The former is more sensitive owing to the presence of [[secondary carbon atom]]s present in every repeat unit. Attack occurs at this point because the free radical formed is more stable than one formed on a [[primary carbon atom]]. Oxidation of polyethylene tends to occur at weak links in the chain, such as branch points in [[low density polyethylene]].
