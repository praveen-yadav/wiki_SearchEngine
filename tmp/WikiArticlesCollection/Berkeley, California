'''Berkeley''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜr|k|l|iː}} {{respell|BURK|lee}}) is a city on the east shore of the [[San Francisco Bay]] in [[Northern California|Northern]] [[California]]—in northern [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]]. It is bordered on the south by the cities of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], and on the north by the city of [[Albany, California|Albany]] and the [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] community of [[Kensington, California|Kensington]]. The eastern city limit coincides with the [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]] border, which generally follows the ridge line of the [[Berkeley Hills]]. The population was 112,580 at the 2010 census. The city is named after Bishop [[George Berkeley]].

Berkeley is the site of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the oldest of the [[University of California]] system, and the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]. It is also home to the [[Graduate Theological Union]]. The city is noted as one of the most [[Modern liberalism in the United States|politically liberal]] in the nation.

==History==

===Early history===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
The site of today's City of Berkeley was the territory of the Chochenyo/Huchiun band of the [[Ohlone]] people when the first Europeans arrived.<ref>{{cite book|last=Golla|first=Victor|title=California Indian Languages|year=2011|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-0-520-26667-4|page=380|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520266674}}</ref> Evidence of their existence in the area include pits in rock formations, which they used to grind acorns, and a [[shellmound]], now mostly leveled and covered up, along the shoreline of [[San Francisco Bay]] at the mouth of [[Strawberry Creek]]. Other artifacts were discovered in the 1950s in the [[Downtown Berkeley|downtown area]] during remodeling of a commercial building, near the upper course of the creek.

[[File:Acorn pit at Indian Rock.jpg|thumb|left|100px|This pit in the surface of a rock at [[Indian Rock Park]] is typical of those used by [[Ohlone]] Indians to grind [[acorn]]s.]]
The first people of European descent (most of whom were born in America, and many of whom were of mixed ancestry) arrived with the [[De Anza Expedition]] in 1776.<ref>{{cite web|last=National Park Service|title=Juan Bautista de Anza|url=http://www.borregospringschamber.com/juan_bautista_de_anza.html|publisher=Borrego Springs Chamber of Commerce}}</ref> Today, this is noted by signage on [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]], which runs along the San Francisco Bay shoreline of Berkeley. The De Anza Expedition led to establishment of the Spanish [[Presidio of San Francisco]] at the entrance to San Francisco Bay (the ''[[Golden Gate]]),'' which is due west of Berkeley. [[Luis María Peralta|Luis Peralta]] was among the soldiers at the Presidio. For his services to the [[King of Spain]], he was granted a vast stretch of land on the east shore of San Francisco Bay (the ''contra costa'', "opposite shore") for a ranch, including that portion that now comprises the City of Berkeley.

Luis Peralta named his holding "[[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]]." The primary activity of the ranch was raising cattle for meat and hides, but hunting and farming were also pursued. Eventually, Peralta gave portions of the ranch to each of his four sons. What is now Berkeley lies mostly in the portion that went to Peralta's son [[José Domingo Peralta|Domingo]], with a little in the portion that went to another son, Vicente. No artifact survives of the Domingo or Vicente ranches, but their names survive in Berkeley street names (Vicente, Domingo, and Peralta). However, legal title to all land in the City of Berkeley remains based on the original Peralta land grant.

The Peraltas' Rancho San Antonio continued after [[Alta California]] passed from Spanish to Mexican sovereignty after the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. However, the advent of U.S. sovereignty after the [[Mexican–American War]], and especially, the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], saw the Peraltas' lands quickly encroached on by [[squatter]]s and diminished by dubious legal proceedings. The lands of the brothers Domingo and Vicente were quickly reduced to reservations close to their respective ranch homes. The rest of the land was surveyed and parceled out to various American claimants (''See'' [[Kellersberger's Map]]).

Politically, the area that became Berkeley was initially part of a vast [[Contra Costa County]]. On March 25, 1853, Alameda County was created by division of Contra Costa County, as well as from a small portion of [[Santa Clara County]].

The area of Berkeley was at this period mostly a mix of open land, farms and ranches, with a small though busy wharf by the bay. It was not yet "Berkeley," but merely the northern part of the "Oakland Township" subdivision of Alameda County.

[[File:Indian rock.jpg|thumb|center|800px|As seen from [[Indian Rock Park]] in the North Berkeley hills. Berkeley is in the foreground, with the [[Berkeley Marina]] and [[César Chávez Park]] just beyond.]]

===Late 19th century===
In 1866, Oakland's private [[College of California]] looked for a new site. It settled on a location north of Oakland along the foot of the [[Berkeley Hills|Contra Costa Range]] (later called the Berkeley Hills) astride [[Strawberry Creek]], at an elevation about {{convert|500|ft}} above the bay, commanding a view of the Bay Area and the Pacific Ocean through the [[Golden Gate]].

According to the ''Centennial Record of the University of California'', "In 1866…at [[Founders' Rock]], a group of College of California men watched two ships standing out to sea through the [[Golden Gate]]. One of them, [[Frederick Billings]], thought of the lines of the Anglo-Irish Anglican Bishop [[George Berkeley]], 'westward the course of empire takes its way,' and suggested that the town and college site be named for the eighteenth-century Anglo-Irish philosopher."<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Stadtman |editor-first=Verne |title=The Centennial Record of the University of California |publisher=[[Regents of the University of California]] |year=1967 |page=114 |url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb4v19n9zb;NAAN=13030&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00219&toc.depth=1&toc.id=div00219&brand=calisphere}}</ref> Although the philosopher's name is pronounced "bark-lee," the pronunciation of the city's name has evolved to suit [[American English]] as "burk-lee."<ref>{{cite web |title=George Berkeley – Biography |publisher=[[European Graduate School]] |url=http://www.egs.edu/library/george-berkeley/biography/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130225225047/http://www.egs.edu/library/george-berkeley/biography/ |archivedate=February 25, 2013 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

The College of California's ''College Homestead Association'' planned to raise funds for the new campus by selling off adjacent parcels of land. To this end, they laid out a plat and street grid that became the basis of Berkeley's modern street plan. Their plans fell far short of their desires, and they began a collaboration with the State of California that culminated in 1868 with the creation of the public [[University of California]].

As construction began on the new site, more residences were constructed in the vicinity of the new campus. At the same time, a settlement of residences, saloons, and various industries grew around the wharf area called "[[Ocean View, Berkeley, California|Ocean View]]." A [[horsecar]] ran from [[Temescal, Oakland, California|Temescal]] in Oakland to the university campus along what is now [[Telegraph Avenue]].

By the 1870s, the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] reached its terminus in Oakland. In 1876, a branch line of the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], the [[Berkeley Branch Railroad]], was laid from a junction with the mainline called Shellmound (now a part of Emeryville) into what is now [[Downtown Berkeley, California|downtown Berkeley]]. That same year, the mainline of the transcontinental railroad into Oakland was re-routed, putting the right-of-way along the bay shore through Ocean View.

There was a strong prohibition movement in Berkeley at this time. In 1876, the city passed the "mile limit law," which forbade sale or public consumption of alcohol within one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) of the new University of California.<ref>Berkeley Gazette. 1900 April 9</ref> Then, in 1899 Berkeley residents voted to make their city an alcohol-free zone. Scientists, scholars and religious leaders spoke vehemently of the dangers of alcohol.<ref>Berkeley 1900: Daily Life at the Turn of the Century, by Richard Schwartz. 2000. page 187</ref>

The first post office opened in 1872.<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|601}}</ref> In 1878, the people of Ocean View and the area around the University campus, together with local farmers, incorporated as the Town of Berkeley. The first elected trustees of the town were the slate of [[Denis Kearney]]'s [[Workingman's Party]], who were particularly favored in the working class area of the former Ocean View, now called "West Berkeley." The area near the university became known for a time as "East Berkeley."

The modern age came quickly to Berkeley, no doubt due to the influence of the university. [[Electric light]]s were in use by 1888. The [[telephone]] had already come to town. Electric [[streetcar]]s soon replaced the [[horsecar]]. A silent film of one of these early streetcars in Berkeley can be seen at the [[Library of Congress]] website: [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/papr:@filreq(@field(NUMBER+@band(lcmp003+m3a29754))+@field(COLLID+sanfran)) "A Trip To Berkeley, California"]

===Early 20th century===

Berkeley's slow growth ended abruptly with the [[1906 San Francisco Earthquake|Great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906]]. The town and other parts of the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] escaped serious damage from the massive temblor, and thousands of refugees flowed across the Bay.

In 1908, a statewide referendum that proposed moving the California state capital to Berkeley was defeated by a margin of about 33,000 votes.<ref>''Exactly Opposite the Golden Gate'', edited by Phil McCardle, published 1983 by the Berkeley Historical Society, p.251</ref> The city named streets around the proposed capitol grounds for California counties. They bear those names today, a legacy of the failed referendum.

In 1909, the citizens of Berkeley adopted a new charter, and the Town of Berkeley became the City of Berkeley. Rapid growth continued up to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Crash of 1929]]. The [[Great Depression]] hit Berkeley hard, but not as hard as many other places in the U.S., thanks in part to the University.

On September 17, 1923, [[1923 Berkeley Fire|a major fire]] swept down the hills toward the University campus and the downtown section. Around 640 structures burned before a late afternoon sea breeze stopped its progress, allowing firefighters to put it out.

The next big growth occurred with the advent of [[World War II]], when large numbers of people moved to the Bay Area to work in the many war industries, such as the immense [[Kaiser Shipyards]] in nearby [[Richmond, California|Richmond]]. One who moved out, but played a big role in the outcome of the War was U.C. Professor and Berkeley resident [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]. During the war, an Army base, [[Camp Ashby]], was temporarily sited in Berkeley.

The element [[berkelium]] was synthesized and named in 1949, recognizing the University, thus also placing the city's name in the list of elements.

===1950s and 1960s===
{{Expand section|date=July 2008}}
During the 1940s, many African Americans migrated to Berkeley.<ref>[http://www.berkeleypubliclibrary.org/community/berkeley_history/a_city_in_history/07WWII_watershed.php "Berkeley, A City in History"]. Berkeley Public Library.</ref> In 1950, the Census Bureau reported Berkeley's population as 11.7% black and 84.6% white.<ref name="census">{{cite web|title=California - Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html}}</ref>

The postwar years brought moderate growth to the City, as events on the U.C. campus began to build up to the recognizable activism of the sixties.  In the 1950s, [[McCarthyism]] induced the University to demand a loyalty oath from its professors, many of whom refused to sign the oath on the principle of freedom of thought. In 1960, a U.S. House committee ([[HUAC]]) came to San Francisco to investigate the influence of communists in the Bay Area. Their presence was met by protesters, including many from the University. Meanwhile, a number of U.C. students became active in the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Finally, in 1964, the University provoked a massive student protest by banning distribution of political literature on campus. This protest became the [[Free Speech Movement]]. As the [[Vietnam War]] rapidly escalated in the ensuing years, so did student activism at the University, particularly that organized by the [[Vietnam Day Committee]].

{{See also|Berkeley riots}}

Berkeley is strongly identified with the rapid social changes, civic unrest, and political upheaval that characterized the late 1960s. In that period, Berkeley—especially [[Telegraph Avenue]]—became a focal point for the [[hippie]] movement, which spilled over the Bay from San Francisco. Many hippies were apolitical drop-outs, rather than students, but in the heady atmosphere of Berkeley in 1967–1969 there was considerable overlap between the hippie movement and the radical left. An iconic event in the Berkeley Sixties scene was a conflict over a parcel of University property south of the contiguous campus site that came to be called "[[People's Park, Berkeley|People's Park]]."

[[Image:People's-Park.jpg|thumbnail|left|People's Park with Unit 2 in the background]]

The battle over the disposition of People's Park resulted in a month-long occupation of Berkeley by the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] on orders of then-Governor [[Ronald Reagan]]. In the end, the park remained undeveloped, and remains so today. A spin-off, "People's Park Annex," was established at the same time by activist citizens of Berkeley on a strip of land above the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] subway construction along Hearst Avenue northwest of the U.C. campus. The land had also been intended for development, but was turned over to the City by BART and is now [[Ohlone Park]].

The era of large public protest in Berkeley waned considerably with the end of the Vietnam War in 1974. While the 1960s were the heyday of liberal activism in Berkeley, it remains one of the most overwhelmingly Democratic cities in the United States.

===1970s to present===
[[File:Berkeley BART Station 1973 Postcard.jpg|thumb|Shattuck Avenue at Center Street in downtown Berkeley as seen in 1973]]
{{Expand section|date=July 2008}}
The Berkeley population declined in the 1970s, partly due to an exodus to the suburbs. Some moved because of the rising cost of living throughout the Bay Area, and others because of the decline and disappearance of many industries in West Berkeley.

From the 1980s to the present, Berkeley housing costs have risen, especially since the mid-1990s. In 2005–2007, sales of homes began to slow, but average home prices, as of 2012, remain among the highest in the nation.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In 1983, Berkeley's [[Domestic Partner Task Force]]  was established, which in 1984 made policy recommendation to the School Board, which passed [[Domestic Partner]] legislation. The legislation became a model for similar measures nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joe Garofoli |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Ethel-Manheimer-Berkeley-activist-dies-4110179.php |title=Ethel Manheimer, Berkeley activist, dies |publisher=SFGate |date=2012-12-12 |accessdate=2013-01-01}}</ref>

In 2006, the [[Berkeley Oak Grove Protest]] began protesting construction of a new sports center annex to Memorial Stadium at the expense of a grove of oak trees on the UC campus. The protest ended in September 2008 after a lengthy court process.

In 2007–08, Berkeley received media attention due to demonstrations against a Marine Corps recruiting office in downtown Berkeley and a series of controversial motions by Berkeley's City Council regarding opposition to Marine recruiting. (''See'' [[Berkeley Marine Corps Recruiting Center controversy]].)

During the fall of 2010, the [[Berkeley Student Food Collective]] opened after many protests on the [[UC Berkeley]] campus due to the proposed opening of the fast food chain [[Panda Express]]. Students and community members worked together to open a collectively-run grocery store right off of the UC Berkeley campus, where the community can buy local, seasonal, humane, and organic foods at prices that everyone can afford. The [[Berkeley Student Food Collective]] still operates at 2440 Bancroft Way.

In the Fall of 2011, the nationwide [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement came to two Berkeley locations: on the campus of the University of California and as an encampment in Civic Center Park.

On September 18, 2012, Berkeley became what may be the first city in the U.S. to officially proclaim a day recognizing bisexuals September 23, which is known as [[Celebrate Bisexuality Day]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Berkeley becomes first US city to declare Bisexual Pride Day, support ‘marginalized’ group|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/berkeley-becomes-first-us-city-to-declare-bisexual-pride-day-support-marginalized-group/2012/09/18/8556fd92-0208-11e2-bbf0-e33b4ee2f0e8_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref>

==Geography==
Berkeley is located at {{Coord|37|52|18|N|122|16|29|W|type:city}} (37.871775, −122.274603).{{GR|1}}
[[Image:BayareaUSGS.jpg|right|thumb|Satellite map of the San Francisco Bay Area from the U.S. Geological Survey.]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]] the city's {{convert|17.7|sqmi}} area includes {{convert|10.5|sqmi}} of land and {{convert|7.2|sqmi}} (40.83%) water, most of it part of [[San Francisco Bay]].

Berkeley borders the cities of Albany, Oakland, and Emeryville and Contra Costa County including unincorporated Kensington as well as San Francisco Bay.

Berkeley lies within telephone [[area code]] 510 (until September 2, 1991, Berkeley was part of the 415 telephone code that now covers only San Francisco and Marin Counties<ref name=BerkeleyAreaCode>{{cite news|last=Fabisch|first=M.P.|title=Revised Date for Split of 415 (California) Numbering Plan Area|url=http://www.nanpa.com/pdf/old_pl/IL%2090-06-023.pdf|accessdate=June 1, 2011|newspaper=BellCore Letter|date=June 6, 1990}}</ref>), and the postal [[ZIP code]]s are 94701 through 94710, 94712, and 94720 for the [[University of California]] campus.

===Geology===
Most of Berkeley lies on a rolling sedimentary plain that rises gently from sea level to the base of the [[Berkeley Hills]]. From there, the land rises dramatically. The highest peak along the ridge line above Berkeley is [[Grizzly Peak (Berkeley Hills)|Grizzly Peak]], elevation {{convert|1754|ft}}. A number of small creeks run from the hills to the Bay through Berkeley: [[Cerrito Creek|Cerrito]], [[Codornices Creek|Codornices]], [[Schoolhouse Creek|Schoolhouse]] and [[Strawberry Creek|Strawberry]] Creeks are the principal streams. Most of these are largely culverted once they reach the plain west of the hills.

The Berkeley Hills are part of the [[Pacific Coast Ranges]], and run in a northwest–southeast alignment. In Berkeley, the hills consist mainly of a soft, crumbly rock with outcroppings of harder material of old (and extinct) volcanic origin. These [[rhyolite]] formations can be seen in several city parks and in the yards of a number of private residences. [[Indian Rock Park]] in the northeastern part of Berkeley near the Arlington/Marin Circle features a large example.

====Earthquakes====
Berkeley is traversed by the [[Hayward Fault]], a major branch of the [[San Andreas Fault]] to the west. No large earthquake has occurred on the Hayward Fault near Berkeley in historic times (except possibly in 1836), but seismologists warn about the geologic record of large temblors several times in the deeper past, and their current assessment is that a quake of 6.5 or greater is imminent, sometime within the next 30 years.<ref>[http://seismo.berkeley.edu/hayward/probabilities.html Bay Area Earthquake Probabilities, UC Berkeley Seismological Laboratory]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref>

The [[1868 Hayward earthquake]] did occur on the southern segment of the Hayward Fault<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9801E5DB1E3CE13BBC4A51DFB6678383679FDE |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 22, 1868 |title=Earthquake in San Francisco and Neighboring Places }}</ref> in the vicinity of today's city of [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] (hence, how the fault got its name). This quake destroyed the county seat of Alameda County then located in [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]] and it subsequently moved to Oakland. It was strongly felt in San Francisco, causing major damage, and experienced by Samuel Clemens ([[Mark Twain]]).<ref>http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=TwaRoug.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=58&division=div1</ref> It was regarded as the "Great San Francisco Quake" prior to 1906. The quake produced a furrow in the ground along the fault line in Berkeley, across the grounds of the new [[State Asylum for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind]] then under construction, which was noted by one early University of California professor. Though no significant damage was reported to most of the few Berkeley buildings of the time, the 1868 quake did destroy the vulnerable adobe home of Domingo Peralta in north Berkeley.<ref>Lawson, A. C. (ed.), ''The California Earthquake of April 18, 1906'', 1908, Reprinted 1969 by the Carnegie Institution of Washington. This is a comprehensive report on the 1906 earthquake, published by the State Earthquake Investigation Commission, and comprises two volumes and an atlas. It contains a discussion of the 1868 Hayward Fault earthquake and its effects, and includes a number of photos taken by Lawson himself of damage in Berkeley caused by the 1906 quake. The report is available from the USGS. {{cite web |url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/1906/18april/references.php |title=The California Earthquake of April 18, 1906 |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov}}</ref>

Today, evidence of the Hayward Fault's "creeping" is visible at various locations in Berkeley. Cracked roadways, sharp jogs in streams, and springs mark the fault's path. However, since it cuts across the base of the hills, the creep is often concealed by or confused with slide activity. Some of the slide activity itself, however, results from movement on the Hayward Fault.

A notorious segment of the Hayward Fault runs lengthwise down the middle of [[California Memorial Stadium|Memorial Stadium]] at the mouth of Strawberry Canyon on the University of California campus. Photos and measurements<ref>http://seismo.berkeley.edu/hayward/ucb_campus.htm</ref>l show the movement of the fault through the stadium.

===Climate===
Berkeley has a cool summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (Köppen climate classification Csb), with dry summers and wet winters. The summers are cooler than a typical Mediterranean climate thanks to [[upwelling]] ocean currents along the California coast. These help produce cool and [[San Francisco fog|fog]]gy nights and mornings. Berkeley's location directly opposite the [[Golden Gate]] ensures that typical eastward fog flow blankets the city more often than its neighbors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ephemeris.sjaa.net/0107/b.html |title=Jane Houston Jones. '&#39;San Francisco Weather – Weird and Wacky'&#39;. SJAA Ephemeris July 2001 |publisher=Ephemeris.sjaa.net |date=2007-07-19 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref>

Winter is punctuated with rainstorms of varying ferocity and duration, but also produces stretches of bright sunny days and clear cold nights. It does not normally snow, though occasionally the hilltops get a dusting. Spring and fall are transitional and intermediate, with some rainfall and variable temperature. Summer typically brings night and morning low clouds or [[fog]], followed by sunny, warm days. The warmest and driest months are typically June through September, with the highest temperatures occurring in September. Mid-summer (July–August) is often a bit cooler due to the sea breezes and fog common then.

Average January temperatures are a maximum of {{convert|56.4|°F}} and a minimum of {{convert|43.6|°F}}. Average September (the warmest month) temperatures are a maximum of {{convert|71.7|°F}} and a minimum of {{convert|55.9|°F}}. In a year, there are an average of 2.9 days with highs of {{convert|90.0|°F}} or higher, and an average of 0.8 days with lows of {{convert|32|°F}} or lower. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|107|°F}} on June 15, 2000, and the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|24|°F}} on December 22, 1990.

January is normally the wettest month, averaging {{convert|5.13|in|mm}} of precipitation. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|25.40|in|mm}}, falling on an average of 63.7 days each year. The most rainfall in one month was {{convert|14.49|in|mm}} in February 1998. The most rainfall in 24 hours was {{convert|6.98|in|mm}} on January 4, 1982.<ref>http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/ca/040693.pdf</ref> Light snow has fallen on rare occasions. Snow has generally fallen every several years on the higher peaks of the [[Berkeley Hills]].<ref>Western Regional Climate Center Web site</ref>

In the late spring and early fall, strong offshore winds of sinking air typically develop, bringing heat and dryness to the area. In the spring, this is not usually a problem as vegetation is still moist from winter rains, but extreme dryness prevails by the fall, creating a danger of wildfires. In September 1923 a major fire swept through the neighborhoods north of the University campus, stopping just short of downtown. (''See'' [[1923 Berkeley fire]]). On October 20, 1991, gusty, hot winds fanned a conflagration along the Berkeley–Oakland border, killing 25 people and injuring 150, as well as destroying 2,449 single-family dwellings and 437 apartment and condominium units. (''See'' [[1991 Oakland firestorm]])

The [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{USCensus-2010CA}}</ref> reported that Berkeley had a population of 112,580. The [[population density]] was 10,752 people per square mile of land area (4,104/km²). The racial makeup of Berkeley was 66,996 (59.5%) [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 11,241 (10.0%) [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black or African American]], 479 (0.4%) [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 21,690 (19.3%) [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]] (8.4% [[Chinese American|Chinese]], 2.4% [[Indian American|Indian]], 2.1% [[Korean American|Korean]], 1.6% [[Japanese American|Japanese]], 1.5% [[Filipino American|Filipino]], 1.0% [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese]], 0.3% [[Pakistani American|Pakistani]], 0.3% [[Thai American|Thai]], 0.2% [[Nepalese American|Nepalese]]), 186 (0.2%) [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 4,994 (4.4%) from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 6,994 (6.2%) from two or more races.

==Transportation==
Berkeley is served by [[Amtrak]] ([[Capitol Corridor]]), [[AC Transit]], [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] ([[Ashby (BART station)|Ashby]], [[Downtown Berkeley Station]] and [[North Berkeley (BART)|North Berkeley]]) and bus shuttles operated by major employers including [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] and [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]. The [[Eastshore Freeway]] ([[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]] and [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]]) runs along the bay shoreline. Each day there is an influx of thousands of cars into the city by commuting UC faculty, staff and students, making parking for more than a few hours an expensive proposition.

Berkeley has one of the highest rates of [[bicycle]] and pedestrian commuting in the nation. Berkeley is the safest city of its size in California for pedestrians and cyclists, considering the number of injuries per pedestrian and cyclist, rather than per capita.<ref>[http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/contentdisplay.aspx?id=8512 Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety in Berkeley], City of Berkeley.</ref>

Berkeley has modified its original grid roadway structure through use of diverters and barriers, moving most traffic out of neighborhoods and onto arterial streets (visitors often find this confusing, because the diverters are not shown on all maps). Berkeley maintains a separate grid of arterial streets for bicycles, called [[Bicycle Boulevards]], with bike lanes and lower amounts of car traffic than the major streets they often parallel.

Berkeley hosts [[car sharing]] networks run by City CarShare, [[Uhaul Car Share]], and [[Zipcar]]. Rather than owning (and parking) their own cars, members share a group of cars parked nearby. Web- and telephone-based reservation systems keep track of hours and charges. Several "pods" (points of departure where cars are kept) exist throughout the city, in several downtown locations, at the Ashby and North Berkeley BART stations, and at various other locations in Berkeley (and other cities in the region). Using alternative transportation is encouraged.

Berkeley has had recurring problems with [[parking meter]] vandalism. In 1999, over 2,400 Berkeley meters were jammed, smashed, or sawed apart.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/01/25/BAG664HDH31.DTL “Chicanery tops meters in Berkeley”], ''San Francisco Chronicle''.</ref> Starting in 2005 and continuing into 2006, Berkeley began to phase out mechanical meters in favor of more centralized electronic meters.

===Transportation past===
The first commuter service to San Francisco was provided by the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]]'s [[Berkeley Branch Railroad]], a [[standard gauge]] [[steam railroad]], which terminated in downtown Berkeley, and connected in Emeryville (at a locale then known as "Shellmound") with trains to the [[Oakland Long Wharf|Oakland ferry pier]] as well as with the Central Pacific main line starting in 1876. The Berkeley Branch line was extended from Shattuck and University to Vine Street ("Berryman's Station") in 1878. Starting in 1882, Berkeley trains ran directly to the Oakland Pier.<ref>''Berkeley Gazette'', January 22, 1903</ref> In the 1880s, [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] assumed operations of the Berkeley Branch. In 1911, Southern Pacific electrified this line and the several others it constructed in Berkeley, creating its [[East Bay Electric Lines]] division. The huge and heavy cars specially built for these lines were called the "Red Trains" or the "Big Red Cars." The Shattuck line was extended and connected with two other Berkeley lines (the Ninth Street Line and the California Street line) at Solano and Colusa (the "Colusa Wye"). It was at this time that the [[Northbrae Tunnel]] and the Rose Street Undercrossing were constructed, both of which still exist (the Rose Street Undercrossing is not accessible to the public, being situated between what is now two backyards). The fourth Berkeley line was the Ellsworth St. line to the university campus. The last Red Trains ran in July, 1941.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ford |first=Robert S. |title=Red Trains in the East Bay: The History of the Southern Pacific Transbay Train and Ferry System |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PT8fAQAAIAAJ |year=1977 |series=Interurbans Specials |volume=65 |publisher=[[Interurban Press]] |location=Glendale, California |isbn=0-916374-27-0}}</ref>

The first electric rail service in Berkeley was provided by several small [[streetcar]] companies starting in 1891. Most of these were eventually bought up by the [[Key System]] of [[Francis "Borax" Smith]] who added lines and improved equipment. The Key System's streetcars were operated by its East Bay Street Railways division. Principal lines in Berkeley ran on Euclid, The Arlington, College, Telegraph, Shattuck, San Pablo, University, and Grove (today's Martin Luther King Jr. Way). The last streetcars ran in 1948, replaced by buses.

The first electric commuter interurban-type trains to San Francisco from Berkeley were put in operation by the Key System in 1903, several years before the Southern Pacific electrified its steam commuter lines. Like the SP, Key trains ran to a pier serviced by the Key's own fleet of [[Ferries of San Francisco Bay|ferryboats]], which also docked at the Ferry Building in San Francisco. After the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] was built, the Key trains ran to the [[Transbay Terminal]] in San Francisco, sharing tracks on the lower deck of the Bay Bridge with the SP's red trains and the [[Sacramento Northern]] Railroad. It was at this time that the Key trains acquired their letter designations, which were later preserved by Key's public successor, AC Transit. Today's F bus is the successor of the F train. Likewise, the E, G and the H. Before the Bridge, these lines were simply the Shattuck Avenue Line, the Claremont Line, the Westbrae Line, and the Sacramento Street Line, respectively.

After the Southern Pacific abandoned transbay service in 1941, the Key System acquired the rights to use its tracks and [[overhead lines|catenary]] on Shattuck north of Dwight Way and through the Northbrae Tunnel to The Alameda for the F-train. The SP tracks along Monterey Avenue as far as Colusa had been acquired by the Key System in 1933 for the H-train, but were abandoned in 1941. The Key System trains stopped running in April 1958.<ref>{{cite book |last=Demoro |first=Harre W. |title=The Key Route: Transbay Commuting by Train and Ferry, Part 1 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=p0wfAQAAIAAJ |year=1985 |series=Interurbans Specials |volume=95 |publisher=[[Interurban Press]] |location=Glendale, California |isbn=0-916374-66-1}}</ref> In 1963, the Northbrae Tunnel was opened to auto traffic.

===Neighborhoods===
{{See also|List of Berkeley neighborhoods}}
[[File:Claremonthotel03192006.JPG|thumb|The Claremont Resort at the heart of the Claremont neighborhood.]]

Berkeley has a number of distinct neighborhoods.

Surrounding the [[University of California, Berkeley Campus Architecture|University of California campus]] are the most densely populated parts of the city. West of the campus is [[Downtown Berkeley, California|Downtown Berkeley]], the city's traditional commercial core; home of the [[civic center]], the city's only public [[Berkeley High School (California)|high school]], the busiest [[Downtown Berkeley Station|BART station]] in Berkeley, as well as a major transfer point for [[AC Transit]] buses. South of the campus is the [[Southside, Berkeley, California|Southside]] neighborhood, mainly a [[student ghetto]], where much of the university's [[UC Berkeley student housing|student housing]] is located. The busiest stretch of [[Telegraph Avenue]] is in this neighborhood. North of the campus is the quieter [[Northside, Berkeley, California|Northside]] neighborhood, the location of the [[Graduate Theological Union]].

Further from the university campus, the influence of the University quickly becomes less visible. Most of Berkeley's neighborhoods are primarily made up of detached houses, often with separate in-law units in the rear, although larger apartment buildings are also common in many neighborhoods. Commercial activities are concentrated along the major avenues and at important intersections.

In the southeastern corner of the city is the [[Claremont, Oakland/Berkeley, California|Claremont District]], home to the [[Claremont Resort|Claremont Hotel]]; and the [[Elmwood, Berkeley, California|Elmwood District]], with a small shopping area on College Avenue. West of Elmwood is [[South Berkeley, Berkeley, California|South Berkeley]], known for its weekend [[flea market]] at the [[Ashby (BART station)|Ashby Station]].

West of (and including) San Pablo Avenue, a major commercial corridor, is [[West Berkeley, Berkeley, California|West Berkeley]], the historic commercial center of the city, and the former unincorporated town of [[Ocean View, Berkeley, California|Ocean View]]. West Berkeley contains the remnants of Berkeley's industrial area, much of which has been replaced by retail and office uses, as well as residential live/work loft space, with the decline of manufacturing in the United States.  The areas of South and West Berkeley are in the midst of redevelopment. Some residents have opposed redevelopment in this area.  Along the shoreline of San Francisco Bay at the foot of University Avenue is the [[Berkeley Marina]].
