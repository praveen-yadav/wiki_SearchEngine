The [[order (biology)|order]] '''Cetacea''' {{IPAc-en|s|ɨ|ˈ|t|eɪ|ʃ|ⁱ|ə}} includes the [[marine mammals]] commonly known as [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s, and [[porpoise]]s. ''Cetus'' is [[Latin]] and is used in biological names to mean "whale"; its original meaning, "large sea animal", was more general. It comes from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|κῆτος}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[kētos]]}}''), meaning "whale" or "any huge [[fish]] or [[sea monster]]". In [[Greek mythology]], the monster [[Perseus]] defeated was called [[Ceto]], which is depicted by the [[constellation]] of [[Cetus]]. [[Cetology]] is the branch of marine science associated with the study of cetaceans.

Fossil evidence suggests that cetaceans share a common ancestor with land-dwelling mammals that began living in marine environments around 50 million years ago. Today, they are the [[mammal]]s best [[aquatic adaptation|adapted to aquatic life]]. The body of a cetacean is fusiform (spindle-shaped). The forelimbs are modified into flippers. The tiny hindlimbs are [[vestigial]]; they do not attach to the backbone and are hidden within the body. The tail has horizontal [[wikt:Special:Search/fluke|fluke]]s. Cetaceans are nearly hairless, and are insulated from the cooler water they inhabit by a thick layer of [[blubber]].

Some species are noted for [[cetacean intelligence|their high intelligence]]. At the 2012 meeting in Vancouver, Canada, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (the world's largest science conference), support was reiterated for a cetacean bill of rights, listing cetaceans as [[non-human person]]s.<ref name="BBC News Online Feb 2012">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-17116882 |title=Dolphins deserve same rights as humans, say scientists |date=21 Feb 2012 |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>

==Physical characteristics==

===Respiration===
[[File:DelfinEstrecho.jpg|thumb|left|A [[dolphin]] in the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]|alt=Overhead photo of whale at surface]]

Cetaceans breathe air. They surface periodically to exhale [[carbon dioxide]] and inhale a fresh supply of [[oxygen]]. During diving, a muscular action closes the [[blowhole (biology)|blowholes]] ([[nostril]]s), which remain closed until the cetacean comes to the surface; when it surfaces, the muscles open the blowholes and warm air is exhaled.

Cetaceans' blowholes [[Evolution of cetaceans|have evolved]] to a position at the top of the head, simplifying breathing in sometimes rough seas. When the stale air, warmed from the lungs, is exhaled, it condenses as it meets colder external air. As with a terrestrial mammal breathing out on a cold day, a small cloud of 'steam' appears. This is called the 'blow' or 'spout' and varies by species in terms of shape, angle and height. Species can be identified at a distance using this characteristic.

Cetaceans can remain under water for much longer periods than most other mammals, (about seven to 120 minutes, varying by species) due to large physiological differences. Two studied advantages of cetacean physiology let this order (and other marine mammals) forage underwater for extended periods without breathing:
* Mammalian [[myoglobin]] concentrations in [[skeleton|skeletal]] [[muscle]] have much variation. [[New Zealand]] white rabbits have {{convert|0.08|g|oz}} +/- {{convert|0.6|g|oz}} myoglobin in {{convert|100|g|oz}} of wet muscle,<ref>
Castellini and Somero, 1981{{Citation broken|date=April 2008}}</ref> whereas a [[northern bottlenose whale]] has {{convert|6.34|g|oz}}.<ref>
Scholander, 1940{{Citation broken|date=April 2008}}</ref> Myoglobin, by nature, has a higher oxygen affinity than [[hemoglobin]]. The higher the myoglobin concentration in skeletal muscle, the longer the animal can stay underwater.
* Increased body size also increases maximum dive duration. Greater body size implies increased muscle mass and increased oxygen stores. Cetaceans also obey [[Kleiber's law]], which states that mass and metabolic rate are inversely related, ''i.e.'', larger animals consume less oxygen than smaller animals per unit mass.

===Vision, hearing and echolocation===
Cetacean [[eye]]s are set on the sides rather than the front of the head. This means only cetaceans with pointed 'beaks' (such as dolphins) have good binocular vision forward and downward. Tear glands secrete greasy tears, which protect the eyes from the salt in the water. The lens is almost spherical, which is most efficient at focusing the minimal light that reaches deep water. Cetaceans make up for their generally poor vision (with the exception of the dolphin) with excellent hearing.

The external ear of cetaceans has lost the [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] (visible ear) but still retains an extremely narrow [[external auditory meatus]]. To register sounds, instead, the posterior part of the [[mandible]] has a thin lateral wall (the pan bone) behind which a large fat pad is housed in a concavity. The fat pad passes anteriorly into the greatly enlarged [[mandibular foramen]] to reach in under the teeth, and posteriorly to reach the thin lateral wall of the [[ectotympanic]]. The ectotympanic only offers a reduced attachment area for the [[tympanic membrane]] and the connection between this auditory complex and the rest of the skull is reduced in cetaceans&nbsp;— to a single, small cartilage in [[oceanic dolphin]]s. In odontocetes, the complex is surrounded by spongy tissue filled with air spaces, while in mysticetes it is integrated into the skull similar to land mammals. In odontocetes, the tympanic membrane (or ligament) has the shape of a folded-in umbrella which stretches from the ectotympanic ring and narrows off to the malleus (quite unlike the flat, circular membrane found in land mammals.) In mysticetes, it also forms a large protrusion (known as the "glove finger") which stretches into the external meatus, and the stapes are larger than in odontocetes. In some [[Kogia|small sperm whales]], the malleus is fused with the ectotympanic. The ear ossicles are pachyosteosclerotic (dense and compact) in cetaceans and very different in shape compared to land mammals (other aquatic mammals, such as sirenians and earless seals, have also lost their pinnae). In modern cetaceans, the semicircular canals are much smaller relative to body size than in other mammals.<ref name="Thewissen-Hearing">{{Cite book

In modern cetaceans, the [[auditory bulla]] is separated from the skull and composed of two compact and dense bones (the periotic and tympanic) referred to as the tympano-periotic complex. This complex is located in a cavity in the middle ear which, in Mysticeti, is divided by a bony projection and compressed between the exoccipital and squamosal but, in Odontoceti, is large and completely surrounds the bulla (hence called "peribullar") which is therefore not connected to the skull except in [[Physeteroidea|physeterids]]. In odontoceti, the cavity is filled with a dense foam in which the bulla hangs suspended in five or more sets of ligaments. The pterygoid and peribullar [[Sinus (anatomy)|sinuses]] that form the cavity tend to be more developed in shallow water and riverine species than in pelagic mysticeti. In odontoceti, the composite auditory structure is thought to serve as an acoustic isolator, analogous to the lamellar construction found in the temporal bone in bats.<ref>{{Cite book

}}</ref> From this, Odontoceti can discern the size, shape, surface characteristics, distance and movement of an object. With this ability, cetaceans can search for, chase and catch fast-swimming prey in total darkness. Echolocation is so advanced in most Odontoceti, they can distinguish between prey and nonprey (such as humans or boats); captive Odontoceti can be trained to distinguish between, for example, balls of different sizes or shapes. Mysticeti (baleen whales) have exceptionally thin, wide basilar membranes in their cochleae without stiffening agents, making their ears adapted for processing low to infrasonic frequencies.<ref>Ketten, D.R. 1997. Structure and function in whale ears. The International Journal of Animal Sound and its Recording 8: 103-135.</ref>

Cetaceans also use sound to [[communication|communicate]], whether it be groans, moans, whistles, clicks or the complex 'singing' of the [[humpback whale]].

Besides hearing and vision, at least one species, the [[tucuxi]] or Guiana dolphin, is able to use [[electroreception]] to sense prey.<ref>[http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/07/guiana-dolphins-can-use-electric.html?ref=hp Guiana Dolphins Can Use Electric Signals to Locate Prey]</ref>

===Feeding===
<!--[[File:Cetacea.jpg|thumb|right|Various Cetacea: 1- [[bowhead whale]]; 2- [[orca]]; 3- [[right whale]]; 4- [[sperm whale]]; 5- [[narwhal]]; 6- [[blue whale]]; 7- [[rorqual]]; 8- [[beluga (whale)|beluga]]]] Commenting out for now... Which right whale species? There are three. Which rorqual species? There are nine, including the blue whale.-->
The toothed whales, such as the [[sperm whale]], [[Beluga (whale)|beluga]], dolphins and porpoises, have teeth they use for catching [[fish]], [[squid]] or other marine life. They do not chew, but swallow prey whole. When they catch large prey, such as when the [[killer whale]] (''Orcinus orca'') catches a [[pinniped|seal]], they bite off and swallow one chunk at a time.

Instead of teeth, Mysticeti have [[baleen]] plates made of [[keratin]] (the same substance as human fingernails), which hang from the upper jaw. These plates filter small animals (such as [[krill]] and fish) from the seawater. Cetaceans included in this group include the blue, humpback, bowhead and minke whales.

Not all Mysticeti feed on [[plankton]]; the larger species eat small shoaling fish, such as [[herring]] and [[sardine]]s, called micronecton. The [[gray whale]] (''Eschrichtius robustus''), is a [[Benthos|benthic]] feeder, primarily eating sea-floor [[crustacean]]s.

==Taxonomy==
The order Cetacea contains about 90 species, all marine except for four species of [[river dolphin|freshwater dolphins]]. The order contains two suborders: [[Mysticeti]] (baleen whales) and [[Odontoceti]] (toothed whales, which includes dolphins and porpoises). The species range in size from [[Commerson's dolphin]], smaller than a human, to the [[Blue Whale]], the largest animal ever known to have lived.

Cetaceans are mammals, that is, members of the [[Class (biology)|class]] Mammalia. Their closest living relatives are the [[even-toed ungulate]]s, such as the [[hippopotamus]] and [[deer]].<ref name=science_news_1>{{cite web | url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/09/010920072245.htm | title = New Fossils Suggest Whales And Hippos Are Close Kin | accessdate = 2007-12-21 | author = University Of Michigan (2001, September 20) | publisher = ScienceDaily}}</ref><ref name=science_news_2>{{cite web | url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071220220241.htm | title = Whales Descended From Tiny Deer-like Ancestors | accessdate = 2007-12-21 | author = Northeastern Ohio Universities Colleges of Medicine and Pharmacy (2007, December 21) | publisher = ScienceDaily}}</ref>

{{Cetartiodactyla Cladogram}}

Mammalian characteristics include [[warm-blooded]]ness, breathing air through their [[lungs]], [[Breastfeeding|suckling]] their young and growing [[hair]], although very little of it.

Another way of distinguishing a cetacean from a fish is the shape of the tail. [[Fish fin|Fish tails]] are vertical and move from side to side when the fish swims. Cetacea tails&nbsp;— called a fluke&nbsp;— are horizontal and move up and down, because cetacea spines bend in the same manner as a [[human]] spine.

===Evolution===
{{See also|Evolution of cetaceans}}
The [[cetacean]]s ([[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s) are [[marine mammal]] descendants of the artiodactyl family Raoellidae, a group of land mammals characterized by an even-toed ungulate skull, slim limbs, and an ear with significant similarities to that of early whales.<ref>
Thewissen, J.G.M., Cooper, L.N., Clementz, M.T., Bajpai, S, & Tiwari, B.N. 2007. Whales originated from aquatic artiodactyls in the Eocene epoch of India. Nature 450: 1190–1195.</ref> The terrestrial origins of cetaceans are indicated first by their need to breathe air from the surface, the bones of their fins, which resemble the limbs of land mammals, and by the vestigial remains of hind legs inherited from their four-legged ancestors.

The question of how land animals became ocean-going was a mystery until discoveries starting in the late 1970s in [[Pakistan]] revealed several stages in the transition of cetaceans from land to sea:{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

{{wide image|Cetacea-evolution.jpg|1000px|Illustrative representation of the cetacean evolution ([[Pakicetus]] » [[Ambulocetus]] »  [[Kutchicetus]] » [[Protocetus]] » [[Janjucetus]] / [[Squalodon]]).|alt=Illustrative representation of the cetacean evolution.}}

This image does not capture the true [[Phylogenesis|phylogenetic]] [[evolution]] of a particular species, but it is an illustrative representation of the evolution of cetaceans from terrestrial four-legged [[mammals]], from their probable ancestor, through different stages of adaptation to aquatic life to modern cetaceans type; hydrodynamic body shape, fully developed caudal fin and vestigial hind legs. The separation of cetaceans in suborder [[baleen whales]] and suborder [[toothed whales]], occurred during the [[Oligocene]] (Janjucetus and Squalodon represent the early forms of their suborders).

===Mysticeti vs Odontoceti===
Fossils indicate that before evolving baleen, Mysticeti also had teeth, so defining the Odontoceti via teeth alone is problematic. Instead, paleontologists have identified other features uniting fossil and modern odontocetes that are not shared by Mysticetes. It was also assumed that toothed whales evolved their asymmetrical skulls as an adaptation to their echolocation, but newer discoveries indicate that the common ancestor of the present whales actually had a contorted skull as well. Cranial asymmetry is now known to have evolved in ancient whales as part of a set of traits linked to directional hearing, including pan-bone thinning of the lower jaws, the development of mandibular fat pads, and the isolation of the ear region.<ref>Fahlke, J.M., Gingerich, P.D., Welsh, R.C. & Wood, A.R. 2011. Cranial asymmetry in Eocene archaeocete whales and the evolution of directional hearing in water. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</ref> This likely means that, while the asymmetry in the Odontoceti skull has increased over time, the Mysticeti skull has evolved from asymmetrical to symmetrical.<ref>[http://www.livescience.com/15686-ancient-whales-twisted-skulls.html Ancient Whales Had Twisted Skulls]</ref>

===Classification===
[[File:Cetaceans.svg|right|thumb|300px|Size comparison of nearly all known extant cetacean species. Note the human diver at lower right for scale.]]
{{See also|List of cetaceans|List of extinct cetaceans}}
The classification here closely follows [[Dale W. Rice]], ''Marine Mammals of the World: Systematics and Distribution'' (1998), which has become the standard taxonomy reference in the field. There is very close agreement between this classification and that of ''Mammal Species of the World: 3rd Edition'' (Wilson and Reeder eds., 2005). Any differences are noted using the abbreviations "Rice"<ref>{{Cite journal: Rice cetacea classification}}</ref> and "MSW3"<ref name=msw3/> respectively. Further differences due to recent discoveries are also noted.

Discussion of synonyms and subspecies are relegated to the relevant genus and species articles.
