The '''Bahamas''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Bahamas.ogg|b|ə|ˈ|h|ɑː|m|ə|z}}, officially the '''Commonwealth of the Bahamas''', is a country consisting of more than 700 [[island]]s, [[cay]]s, and [[islet]]s in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; north of [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]] (the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Haiti]]); northwest of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]]; southeast of the U.S. state of [[Florida]] and east of the [[Florida Keys]]. Its capital is [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] on the island of [[New Providence]]. The designation of "Bahamas"  can refer to either the country or the larger island chain that it shares with the Turks and Caicos Islands. As stated in the mandate/manifesto of the [[Royal Bahamas Defence Force]], the Bahamas territory encompasses {{convert|180000|sqmi|km2|disp=flip|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of ocean space.

Originally inhabited by the [[Lucayan]], a branch of the [[Arawakan]]-speaking [[Taíno people|Taino]] people, the Bahamas were the site of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]' first landfall in the [[New World]] in 1492. Although the Spanish never colonized the Bahamas, they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola. The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when [[Kingdom of England|English]] colonists from [[Bermuda]] settled on the island of [[Eleuthera]].

The Bahamas became a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[Crown colony]] in 1718, when the British clamped down on [[piracy]]. After the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]], thousands of [[American Loyalists]], taking their enslaved Africans, moved to the Bahamas, where the Americans set up a plantation economy. After Britain [[Abolitionism|abolished the international slave trade]] in 1807, the [[Royal Navy]] resettled many free Africans liberated from illegal slave ships in the Bahamas during the 19th century. Hundreds of American slaves and [[Black Seminoles]] escaped to the islands from Florida, and nearly 500 were freed from American merchant ships in the domestic trade. [[Slavery in the Bahamas]] was abolished in 1834. Today the descendants of slaves and free Africans form the majority of the population; issues related to the slavery years are part of society. The Bahamas became an independent [[Commonwealth realm]] in 1973, retaining [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its monarch.

In terms of [[gross domestic product]] per capita, the Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the [[Americas]] (following [[United States|the United States]] and [[Canada]]).<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html?countryName=Bahamas,%20The&countryCode=bf&regionCode=cam&rank=49#bf CIA - The World Factbook<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Etymology of name==
The name ''Bahamas'' is derived from the Spanish ''baja mar'' ("shallow water or sea"). In English, the Bahamas is one of only two countries whose official name begins with the word "the", along with [[the Gambia]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Geoghegan|first=Tom|title=Ukraine or the Ukraine: Why do some country names have 'the'?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18233844|accessdate=8 June 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 June 2012}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of the Bahamas}}
[[File:PSM V36 D105 Lucayan skull from the bahamas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lucayan people|Lucayan]] skull. These [[Taino people|Taíno]] people were the original inhabitants of the Bahamas.]]
[[Taíno people|Taino]] people moved into the uninhabited southern Bahamas from [[Hispaniola]] and [[Cuba]] around the 11th century AD, having migrated there from South America. They came to be known as the [[Lucayan people|Lucayan]]. An estimated 30,000 Lucayan inhabited the Bahamas at the time of [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in 1492. Columbus' first landfall in the [[New World]] was on an island named San Salvador (known to the Lucayan as ''[[Guanahani]]''), which some researchers believe to be present-day [[San Salvador Island]] (also known as Watling's Island), situated in the southeastern Bahamas.

An alternative theory holds that Columbus landed to the southeast on [[Samana Cay]], according to calculations made in 1986 by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' writer and editor [[Joseph Judge]], based on Columbus' log. Evidence in support of this remains inconclusive. On the landfall island, Columbus made first contact with the Lucayans and exchanged goods with them.

The Spanish forced much of the Lucayan population to Hispaniola for use as forced labour; together with suffering from exposure to [[Infectious disease|diseases]] to which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]], they suffered high fatalities. The population of the Bahamas was decimated.<ref>[http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/DUMENE01.ART Joanne E.

Historians had long believed that Europeans generally did not begin to colonize the islands until the mid-17th century. However, recent research suggests that there may have been attempts to settle the islands by groups from Spain, France, and Britain, as well as by other Amerindians. In 1648, the [[Eleutherian Adventurers]], led by [[William Sayle]], migrated from [[Bermuda]]. These English Puritans established the first permanent European settlement on an island which they named [[Eleuthera]]—the name derives from the Greek word for freedom. They later settled [[New Providence]], naming it Sayle's Island after one of their leaders. To survive, the settlers [[Wrecking (shipwreck)#The Bahamas|salvaged goods from wrecks]].

In 1670 [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] granted the islands to the [[Lords Proprietors]] of the Carolinas, who rented the islands from the king with rights of trading, tax, appointing [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|governors]], and administering the country.<ref name="Anglican">{{cite web |year=2009 |url=http://bahamas.anglican.org/history.php|title = Diocesan History|publisher = © Copyright 2009 Anglican Communications Department| accessdate = 2009-05-07 | last= |quote=}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> In 1684 Spanish [[privateer|corsair]] Juan de Alcon [[Raid on Charles Town|raided the capital]], Charles Town (later renamed [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]).

During proprietary rule, the Bahamas became a haven for [[Piracy|pirates]], including the infamous [[Blackbeard]]. To restore orderly government, Britain made the Bahamas a [[British overseas territories|crown colony]] in 1718 under the royal governorship of [[Woodes Rogers]]. After a difficult struggle, he succeeded in suppressing piracy.<ref>{{cite book

During the [[American War of Independence]], the islands were a target for American naval forces under the command of Commodore [[Esek Hopkins|Ezekial Hopkins]]. [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] occupied the capital of Nassau for a [[fortnight]].

In 1782, following the British defeat at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]], a Spanish fleet appeared off the coast of Nassau, and the city [[Capture of The Bahamas (1782)|surrendered without a fight]]. Spain returned possession of the Bahamas to Britain the following year, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]].

After American independence, the British resettled some 7,300 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] and their slaves in the Bahamas from New York, Florida, and the Carolinas, to help compensate them for losses. These Loyalists established plantations on several islands and became a political force in the capital. European Americans were outnumbered by the African-American slaves they brought with them, and ethnic Europeans remained a minority in the territory.

In 1807, the British abolished the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]]. During the following decades, they resettled thousands of Africans liberated from slave ships by the [[Royal Navy]], which intercepted the trade, in the Bahamian islands. Slavery was finally [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|abolished in the British Empire]] on 1 August 1834.

In the 1820s, hundreds of American slaves and [[Black Seminoles]] escaped from [[Cape Florida]] to the Bahamas, settling mostly on northwest [[Andros Island]], where they developed the village of Red Bays. From eyewitness accounts, 300 escaped in a mass flight in 1823, aided by Bahamians in 27 sloops, with others using canoes for the journey. This was commemorated in 2004 by a large sign at [[Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park]].<ref name="nps">[http://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/ntf_member/ntf_member_details.htm?SPFID=9173&SPFTerritory=Florida&SPFType=Site&SPFKeywords=Bill%20Baggs%20Cape%20Florida%20State%20Park "Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park"], ''Network to Freedom,'' National Park Service, 2010, accessed 10 April 2013</ref><ref>Charles Blacker Vignoles, ''Observations on the Floridas,'' New York: E.

It plans to develop interpretive programs at historical sites in Red Bay associated with the period of their settlement in the Bahamas.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/ntf_member/ntf_partner_details.htm?PARTNERID=13845&PARTNERTerritory=NULL&PARTNERKeywords=Red%20Bays Partners: "African Bahamanian Museum and Research Center (ABAC)"], Network to Freedom, National Park Service, accessed 10 April 2013</ref>

Note: In trying to retrieve American slaves off the ''Encomium'' from colonial officials (who freed them), the US consul in February 1834 was told by the Lieutenant Governor that "he was acting in regard to the slaves under an opinion of 1818 by Sir Christopher Robinson and Lord Gifford to the British Secretary of State."</ref> the Home Office in London had ruled that "any slave brought to the [[Bahamas]] from outside the [[British West Indies]] would be manumitted." This led to a total of nearly 300 slaves owned by U.S. nationals being freed from 1830 to 1835.<ref name="horne103">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XTLFKrmJPgcC Gerald Horne, ''Negro Comrades of the Crown: African Americans and the British Empire Fight the U.S. Before Emancipation''], New York University (NYU) Press, 2012, p. 103</ref>  The American slave ships ''Comet'' and ''Encomium,'' used in its domestic [[coastwise slave trade]], had wrecked off Abaco Island in December 1830 and February 1834, respectively. When wreckers took the masters, passengers and slaves into Nassau, customs officers seized the slaves and British colonial officials freed them, over the protests of the Americans. There were 165 slaves on the ''Comet'' and 48 on the ''Encomium.'' Britain paid an indemnity to the US in those two cases, but only after lengthy delay.<ref>Horne (2012), ''Negro Comrades of the Crown'', p. 137</ref>

British colonial officials also freed 78 American slaves from the ''[[Enterprise (slave ship)|Enterprise]]'', which went into Bermuda in 1835; and 38 from the ''[[Hermosa (slave ship)|Hermosa]]'', which wrecked off Abaco island in 1840, after abolition was effective in August 1834.<ref>Horne (2012), ''Negro Comrades of the Crown'', pp. 107–108</ref> The most notable case was that of the ''Creole'' in 1841, the result of a [[slave revolt]] whose leaders ordered the American brig to Nassau. It was carrying 135 slaves from Virginia destined for sale in [[New Orleans]]. The Bahamian officials freed the 128 slaves who chose to stay in the islands. The ''Creole'' case has been described as the "most successful slave revolt in US history".<ref name="williams">{{cite news

These incidents, in which a total of 447 slaves belonging to American nationals were freed by 1842, increased tension between the United States and Great Britain, although they had been cooperating in patrols to suppress the international slave trade. Worried about the stability of its domestic slave trade and its value, the US argued that Britain should not treat its domestic ships that came to its colonial ports under duress, as part of the international trade. The US worried that the success of the Creole's slaves in gaining freedom would encourage more slave revolts on merchant ships.

In August 1940, after his abdication, the [[Duke of Windsor]] was installed as [[Governor of the Bahamas]], arriving with his wife, the [[Wallis Simpson|Duchess]].

[[File:Sir. Roland Symonette Park Sign.jpg|thumb|left|Sign at the entrance of the Sir. Roland Symonette Park in [[North Eleuthera]] district commemorating Sir [[Roland Theodore Symonette]], the Bahamas' first [[Prime Minister of the Bahamas|Premier]].]]
Modern political development began after the [[Second World War]]. The first political parties were formed in the 1950s. The British Parliament authorized the islands as internally self-governing in 1964, with [[Sir Roland Symonette]], of the [[United Bahamian Party]], as the first Premier.

The fourth [[James Bond films|James Bond film]], ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]],'' was partly filmed in 1965 in Nassau. [[The Beatles]]' film ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' was filmed in part on New Providence Island and Paradise Island the same year.

In 1967, [[Lynden Pindling]] ([[Sir]] Lynden from 1983), of the [[Progressive Liberal Party]], became the first black Premier of the colony; in 1968 the title of the position was changed to [[Prime Minister of the Bahamas|Prime Minister]]. In 1973, the Bahamas became fully independent as a [[Commonwealth realm]], retaining membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. [[Sir Milo Butler]] was appointed the first [[Governor-General of the Bahamas]] (the official representative of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]) shortly after independence.

Based on the twin pillars of tourism and [[offshore finance]], the Bahamian economy has prospered since the 1950s. Significant challenges in areas such as education, health care, housing, international narcotics trafficking, and illegal immigration from Haiti continue to be issues.

The [[College of the Bahamas]] is the national higher education/tertiary system. Offering baccalaureate, masters and associate degrees, COB has three campuses, and teaching and research centres throughout the Bahamas. The College is in the process of becoming the University of the Bahamas as early as 2012.

==Geography and climate==
{{Main|Geography of the Bahamas}}
[[File:Bahamas 2009.jpg|thumb|right|The Bahamas from space. [[NASA]] [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellite image, 2009]]
The country lies between latitudes [[20th parallel north|20°]] and [[28th parallel north|28°N]], and longitudes [[72nd meridian west|72°]] and [[80th meridian west|80°W]].

In 1864, the [[Governor of the Bahamas]] reported that there were 29 islands, 661 cays, and 2,387 rocks in the colony.<ref>Albury:6</ref>

The closest island to the United States is [[Bimini]], which is also known as the gateway to the Bahamas. The island of [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]] is to the east of [[Grand Bahama]]. The southeasternmost island is [[Inagua]]. The largest island is [[Andros Island]]. Other inhabited islands include [[Eleuthera]], [[Cat Island, Bahamas|Cat Island]], [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]], [[San Salvador Island]], [[Acklins]], [[Crooked Island (Bahamas)|Crooked Island]], [[Exuma]] and [[Mayaguana]]. [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], capital city of the Bahamas, lies on the island of [[New Providence]].

All the islands are low and flat, with ridges that usually rise no more than {{convert|15|to|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The highest point in the country is [[Mount Alvernia]] (formerly Como Hill) on Cat Island. It has an altitude of {{convert|63|m|ft}}.
[[File:Hurricane wilma devastation.jpg|thumb|right|Damaged homes in the Bahamas in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Wilma]] in 2005.]]
To the southeast, the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], and three more extensive submarine features called [[Mouchoir Bank]], [[Silver Bank]], and [[Navidad Bank]], are geographically a continuation of the Bahamas, but not part of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

===Climate===
{{See also|Geography of the Bahamas}}
The climate of the Bahamas is tropical savannah or Aw. As such, there has never been a frost or freeze ever reported anywhere in the Bahamas - although every few decades low temperatures can fall into the 38 to 45 F (3 to 5 C) range for a few hours when a severe cold outbreak comes off the North American landmass. Otherwise, the low latitude, warm tropical Gulf Stream, and low elevation give the Bahamas a warm and winterless climate. There is only a 12 F difference between the warmest month and coolest month in most of the Bahama Islands. Like most tropical climates, seasonal rainfall follows the sun, and summer is the wettest season. The Bahamas are often sunny and dry for long periods of time, and average more than 3000 hours of sunlight annually.

Although rare, tropical cyclones can impact the Bahamas. In 1992 Hurricane Andrew passed over the northern portions of the Islands, and Hurricane Floyd passed near the eastern portions of the islands in 1999.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of the Bahamas}}
[[File:BahamianParliamentPanorama.jpg|thumb|[[Parliament of the Bahamas|Bahamian Parliament]], located in downtown [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]]]

The Bahamas is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy headed by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in her role as Queen of the Bahamas. Political and legal traditions closely follow those of the United Kingdom and the [[Westminster system]]. The two main parties are the Free National Movement and the Progressive Liberal Party. The Bahamas is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] as a [[Commonwealth realm]], retaining the Queen as [[head of state]] (represented by a [[List of Governors-General of the Bahamas|Governor-General]]).

Tourism generates about half of all jobs, but the number of visitors has dropped significantly since the beginning of the global economic downturn during the last quarter of 2008. Banking and international financial services also have contracted.

[[Legislature|Legislative power]] is vested in a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]], which consists of a 38-member [[House of Assembly of the Bahamas|House of Assembly]] (the [[lower house]]), with members elected from [[Plurality voting system|single-member districts]], and a 16-member [[Parliament of The Bahamas#Senate|Senate]], with members appointed by the Governor-General, including nine on the advice of the Prime Minister, four on the advice of the [[Leader of the Opposition|Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition]], and three on the advice of the Prime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition. The House of Assembly carries out all major legislative functions. As under the Westminster system, the Prime Minister may dissolve Parliament and call a General Election at any time within a five-year term.

The [[Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]] and is the leader of the party with the most seats in the House of Assembly. [[Executive (government)|Executive power]] is exercised by the Cabinet, selected by the Prime Minister and drawn from his supporters in the House of Assembly. The current Governor-General is [[Excellency|His Excellency]] [[Arthur Foulkes|Sir Arthur Foulkes]], [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George|G.C.M.G.]], and the current [[List of heads of government of the Bahamas|Prime Minister]] is [[The Right Honourable|The Rt. Hon.]] [[Perry Christie]], [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|P.C.]], [[Member of Parliament|M.P.]].

The Bahamas has a largely [[two-party system]] dominated by the [[centre-left]] [[Progressive Liberal Party]] and the [[centre-right]] [[Free National Movement]]. A handful of splinter parties have been unable to win election to parliament. These parties have included the [[Bahamas Democratic Movement]], the [[Coalition for Democratic Reform]], Bahamian Nationalist Party and the [[Democratic National Alliance (Bahamas)|Democratic National Alliance]].

Constitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association. Although the Bahamas is not geographically located in the Caribbean, it is a member of the [[Caribbean Community]]. The [[Judicial independence|judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Jurisprudence is based on [[English law]].

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Local government in the Bahamas}}
[[File:Districts of the Bahamas (Labeled).png|thumb|right|Districts of the Bahamas]]
The districts of the Bahamas provide a system of local government everywhere except [[New Providence]] (which holds 70% of the national population), whose affairs are handled directly by the central government. In 1996, the Bahamian Parliament passed "The Local Government Act" to facilitate the establishment of Family Island Administrators, Local Government Districts, Local District Councillors, and Local Town Committees for the various island communities. The overall goal of this act is to allow the various elected leaders to govern and oversee the affairs of their respective districts without the interference of Central Government. In total, there are 38 districts, with elections being held every five years. There are also one hundred and ten Councillors and two hundred and eighty-one Town Committee members to correspond with the various districts.<ref>[http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/bahamasweb2/home.nsf/vContentW/A5FB7665F3E4341306256F0000763055 Family Island District Councillors & Town Committee Members]</ref>

Each Councillor or Town Committee member is responsible for the proper use of public funds for the maintenance and development of their constituency.

The Bahamas uses [[left hand drive]] traffic rules throughout the Commonwealth.

The districts other than New Providence are:

===Military===
{{Main|Royal Bahamas Defence Force}}
The Bahamas does not have an army or an air force. Its military is composed of the Royal Bahamas Defence Force (the R.B.D.F.), the navy of The Bahamas. Under The Defence Act, the R.B.D.F. has been mandated, in the name of [[Elizabeth II of The Bahamas|The Queen]], to defend The Bahamas, protect its territorial integrity, patrol its waters, provide assistance and relief in times of disaster, maintain order in conjunction with the law enforcement agencies of The Bahamas, and carry out any such duties as determined by the National Security Council. The Defence Force is also a member of The Caribbean Community ([[Caricom|CARICOM]])'s Regional Security Task Force.

The R.B.D.F. officially came into existence on 31 March 1980. Their duties include defending The Bahamas, stopping drug smuggling, illegal immigration, poaching, and providing assistance to mariners whenever and wherever they can. The Defence Force has a fleet of 26 coastal and inshore patrol craft along with 6 aircraft and over 1500 personnel including 65 officers and 74 women.

===National flag===
{{main|Flag of the Bahamas}}
[[File:Flag of the Bahamas.svg|thumb|right|150px|National Flag of The Bahamas]]
The colours embodied in the design of the Bahamian flag symbolise the image and aspirations of the people of The Bahamas; the design reflects aspects of the natural environment (sun, sand, and sea) and the economic and social development. The flag is a black equilateral triangle against the mast, superimposed on a horizontal background made up of two colours on three equal stripes of aquamarine, gold and aquamarine.

The symbolism of the flag is as follows: Black, a strong colour, represents the vigour and force of a united people, the triangle pointing towards the body of the flag represents the enterprise and determination of The Bahamian people to develop and possess the rich resources of sun and sea symbolized by gold and aquamarine respectively. In reference to the representation of the people with the colour black, some white Bahamians have joked that they are represented in the thread which "holds it all together."<ref>[http://www.bahamasschools.com/Symbol%20-%20Flag.htm ASJ-Bahamas Symbol - Flag<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

There are rules on how to use the flag for certain events. For a funeral the national flag should be draped over the coffin covering the top completely but not covering the bearers. The black triangle on the flag should be placed over the head of the deceased in the coffin. The flag will remain on the coffin throughout the whole service and removed right before lowered into the grave. Upon removal of the flag it should be folded with dignity and put away. The black triangle should never be displayed pointing upwards or from the viewer's right. This would be a sign of distress.<ref>{{cite book|last=Strachan|first=Cheryl C.|title=Flying the Pride|year=2010|publisher=Compusec Printing|location=United States of America|isbn=9781609572235|page=74|url=http://books.google.com/?id=FBCwN6zfExwC}}</ref>

===Coat of arms===
{{Main|Coat of arms of the Bahamas}}
[[File:Coat of arms of Bahamas.svg|thumb|right|150px|Bahamian Coat of Arms]]
The coat of arms of the Bahamas contains a shield with the national symbols as its focal point. The shield is supported by a [[marlin]] and a [[flamingo]], which are the national animals of the Bahamas. The flamingo is located on the land, and the marlin on the sea, indicating the geography of the islands.

On top of the shield is a conch shell, which represents the varied marine life of the island chain. The conch shell rests on a helmet. Below this is the actual shield, the main symbol of which is a ship representing the ''[[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa María]]'' of Christopher Columbus, shown sailing beneath the sun. Along the bottom, below the shield appears a banner upon which is scripted the national motto:<ref>[http://www.bahamasschools.com/National%20Coat%20of%20Arms.htm ASJ-Bahamas National Coat of Arms<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
<blockquote>''"Forward, Upward, Onward Together."'' </blockquote>

===National flower===
[[File:Tecoma stans, flowers+pods.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The yellow elder]]
The [[Tecoma stans|yellow elder]] was chosen as the national flower of the Bahamas because it is native to the Bahama Islands, and it blooms throughout the year.

Selection of the yellow elder over many other flowers was made through the combined popular vote of members of all four of New Providence's garden clubs of the 1970s – the Nassau Garden Club, the Carver Garden Club, the International Garden Club, and the [[Young Women's Christian Association|Y.W.C.A.]] Garden Club.

They reasoned that other flowers grown there – such as the bougainvillea, hibiscus, and poinciana – had already been chosen as the national flowers of other countries. The yellow elder, on the other hand, was unclaimed by other countries (although it is now also the national flower of the United States Virgin Islands).<ref>[http://www.bahamasschools.com/Symbol%20-%20Flower.htm ASJ-Bahamas Symbol - Flower<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Bahamas}}
One of the most prosperous countries in the West Indies, The Bahamas relies on [[tourism]] to generate most of its economic activity. Tourism as an industry not only accounts for over 60 percent of the Bahamian GDP, but provides jobs for more than half the country's workforce.<ref>[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/The-Bahamas-ECONOMY.html "The Bahamas – Economy".] [http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/ ''Encyclopedia of the Nations''.] Retrieved 21 March 2010.</ref> After tourism, the next most important economic sector is financial services, accounting for some 15 percent of GDP.
[[File:Prince George Wharf in Nassau Harbor.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cruise ships]] in Nassau Harbour]]
The government has adopted incentives to encourage foreign financial business, and further banking and finance reforms are in progress. The government plans to merge the regulatory functions of key financial institutions, including the Central Bank of The Bahamas (CBB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} The Central Bank administers restrictions and controls on capital and money market instruments. The Bahamas International Securities Exchange currently consists of 19 listed public companies. Reflecting the relative soundness of the banking system (mostly populated by Canadian banks), the impact of the global financial crisis on the financial sector has been limited.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Bahamas.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Graphical depiction of the Bahamas' product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]
The economy has a very competitive tax regime. The government derives its revenue from import tariffs, license fees, property and stamp taxes, but there is no income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, value-added tax (VAT), or wealth tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits and amount to 3.9% paid by the employee and 5.9% paid by the employer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Contributions Table|url=http://www.nib-bahamas.com/_m1722/Brochures/default.aspx|publisher=The National Insurance Board of The Commonwealth of The Bahamas|accessdate=2011-12-22|date=11 May 2010}}</ref> In 2010, overall tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 17.2%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bahamas, The|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bf.html|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=2011-12-22}}</ref>

==Ethnic groups==
{{Main|Demographics of the Bahamas}}

===Afro-Bahamians===
[[File:Gary White Visits Local Schools - Bahamas.JPG|thumb|right|[[Afro-Bahamian]] children at a local school.]]
[[Afro-Bahamian]]s are Bahamian nationals whose primary ancestry lies in West Africa. The first Africans to arrive to The Bahamas came from Bermuda with the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] as freed slaves looking for a new life.
Currently, Afro-Bahamians are the largest ethnic group in the Bahamas, accounting for some 85% of the country's population.<ref name="cia.gov">[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bf.html CIA - The World Factbook<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref> The [[Haiti]]an community numbers about 80,000.<ref>Nick Davis (2009-09-20), [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8257660.stm Bahamas outlook clouds for Haitians]. BBC.</ref>

===Europeans===
According to the 2010 Census of Bahamas, there were a total of 16,598 Whites living there.<ref>http://statistics.bahamas.gov.bs/download/095261300.pdf</ref> [[European Bahamian]]s, or Bahamians of [[Europe]]an descent, numbering about 38,000,<ref>David Levinson (1998). "''[http://books.google.com/books?id=uwi-rv3VV6cC Ethnic groups worldwide: a ready reference handbook]''". Greenwood Publishing Group. p.317. ISBN 1-57356-019-7</ref> are mainly the descendants of the [[Puritan|English Puritans]] and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|American Loyalists]] who arrived in 1649 and 1783 respectively.<ref>"[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bhswgw/land.htm The Names of Loyalist Settlers and Grants of Land Which They Received from the Bahamian Government: 1778 - 1783]".</ref> They form the largest minority group in The Bahamas, making up some 12% of the population.<ref name="cia.gov"/> Many Southern Loyalists went to [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]], which is about 50% white.<ref>Rachel J. Christmas, Walter Christmas (1984). "''Fielding's Bermuda and the Bahamas 1985''". Fielding Travel Books. p.158. ISBN 0-688-03965-0</ref>

A small portion of the European Bahamian population is descended from [[Greece|Greek]] labourers who came to help develop the sponging industry in the 1900s. Although making up less than 1% of the nation's population, they have been able to preserve their distinct [[Greek Bahamians|Greek Bahamian]] culture.

One of the features of the Bahamian genealogy is that most families have branches, and even immediate family members, spanning the entire spectrum between ‘ light’, 'brown' and ‘unequivocally dark.’<ref>{{cite web|url=http://isbndb.com/d/book/a_z_of_bahamas_heritage.html |title=A-Z of Bahamas Heritage |publisher=Isbndb.com |date= |accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref>

In the Bahamas, the term ''Bahamian'' is the only one in use, as ''West Indian'' is not readily acknowledged.

==Demographics==
The Bahamas have a total population of 347,176, of which 25.9% are under 14, 67.2% 15 through 64, and 6.9% over 65.

The only other sporting event that began before [[cricket]] was [[horse racing]], which started in 1796. The [[Bahamas Cricket Association]] was formed in 1936 as an organised body. From the 1940s - 1970s, cricket was played amongst many Bahamians. [[Bahamas]] is not apart of the West Indies Board, so players are not eligible to play for the [[West Indies cricket team]].The late 1970s saw the game begin to decline in the country as teachers, who had previously come from the [[UK]] with a passion for cricket were replaced by teachers who had been trained in the [[USA]]. The Bahamian Physical education teachers had no knowledge of the game and instead taught [[track & field]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[softball]],<ref>http://www.tribune242.com/news/2013/feb/01/call-to-continue-to-develop-softball/</ref> [[volleyball]]<ref>http://www.tribune242.com/news/2013/jul/12/team-bahamas-ratified-for-volleyball-championships/?news</ref> and [[soccer]]<ref>http://bahamasfa.com/</ref> where  primary and high schools compete against each other. Today cricket is still enjoyed by a few locals and immigrants in the country usually from Jamaica, Guyana, Haiti and Barbados. Cricket is played on Saturdays and Sundays at Windsor Park and Haynes Oval.

[[Dexter Cambridge]], [[Rick Fox]] and [[Ian Lockhart]] are a few Bahamians who joined Bahamian [[Mychal Thompson]] of the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA ranks.<ref>http://www.bahamasbasketballfederation.com/the-history-of-baketball-in-the-bahamas.php</ref> Over the years [[American football]] has become much more popular than [[association football]], though not implemented in the high school system yet. Leagues for teens and adults have been developed by the Bahamas American Football Federation.<ref>http://www.thenassauguardian.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11035&Itemid=50</ref> However association football, commonly known as [[soccer]] in the country, is still a very popular sport amongst high school students. Leagues are governed by the [[Bahamas Football Association]].

In the less developed outer islands, handicrafts include basketry made from palm fronds. This material, commonly called "straw", is plaited into hats and bags that are popular tourist items. Another use is for so-called "Voodoo dolls," even though such dolls are the result of the American imagination and not based on historic fact.<ref>Hurbon, Laennec. "American Fantasy and Haitian Vodou.” ''Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou''. Ed. Donald J. Cosentino. Los Angeles: [[UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History]], 1995. 181–97.</ref>

A form of folk magic ([[obeah]]) is practiced by some Bahamians but, mostly the Haitian-Bahamian community, mainly in the Family Islands (out-islands) of The Bahamas.<ref>{{cite web|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2005 - Bahamas|url=http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2005/51625.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref> The practice of obeah is, however, illegal in the Bahamas and punishable by law.<ref>[http://laws.bahamas.gov.bs/statutes/statute_CHAPTER_84.html#Ch84s232 ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>

[[Junkanoo]] is a traditional Bahamian street parade of music, dance, and art held in Nassau (and a few other settlements) every [[Boxing Day]], [[New Year's Day]]. Junkanoo is also used to celebrate other holidays and events such as Emancipation Day.

[[Regatta]]s are important social events in many family island settlements. They usually feature one or more days of sailing by old-fashioned [[work boats]], as well as an onshore festival.

There are many dishes that are part of [[Bahamian cuisine]] and some settlements have festivals associated with the traditional crop or food of that area, such as the "Pineapple Fest" in Gregory Town, [[Eleuthera]] or the "Crab Fest" on Andros. Other significant traditions include [[story telling]].

Bahamians have created a rich literature of poetry, short stories, plays, and short fictional works. Common themes in these works are (1) an awareness of change, (2) a striving for sophistication, (3) a search for identity, (4) nostalgia for the old ways, and (5) an appreciation of beauty. Some contributing writers are Susan Wallace, Percival Miller, Robert Johnson, Raymond Brown, O.M. Smith, William Johnson, Eddie Minnis, Winston Saunders, and many others.<ref>Dean W.

Bahamas culture is rich with beliefs, traditions, folklore and legend. The most well-known folklore and legends in Bahamas includes Lusca in Andros Bahamas, Pretty Molly on Exuma Bahamas, The Chickcharnies of Andro Bahamas, and the Lost City of Atlantis on Bimini Bahamas.
