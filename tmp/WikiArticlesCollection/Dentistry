'''Dentistry''' is the branch of [[medicine]] that is involved in the study, [[diagnosis]], prevention, and treatment of [[diseases]], disorders and conditions of the [[mouth|oral cavity]], the maxillofacial area and the adjacent and associated structures, and their impact on the human body.<ref>[http://www.ada.org/495.aspx Dentistry Definitions], hosted on the American Dental Association website. Page accessed 30 May 2010. This definition was adopted the association's House of Delegates in 1997.</ref> To the layman, dentistry tends to be perceived as being focused primarily on human [[Tooth|teeth]], though it is not limited strictly to this. Dentistry is widely considered necessary for complete overall health. Doctors who practice dentistry are known as [[dentist]]s. The dentist's [[Dental auxiliary|supporting team]] – which includes [[dental assistant]]s, [[dental hygienist]]s, [[dental technician]]s, and [[dental therapist]]s – aids in providing oral health services.

==Overview==
[[File:Tooth Section.svg|thumb|200px|[[Sagittal]] section of a tooth]]

===Dental surgery and treatments===
Dentistry usually encompasses very important practices related to the [[human mouth|oral cavity]]. Oral diseases are major public health problems due to their high incidence and prevalence across the globe with the disadvantaged affected more than other socio-economic groups.<ref>The World Oral Health Report 2003: continuous improvement of oral health in the 21st century – the approach of the WHO Global Oral Health Programme</ref>

The majority of dental treatments are carried out to prevent or treat the two most common oral diseases which are [[dental caries]] (tooth decay) and [[periodontal disease]] (gum disease or pyorrhea). Common treatments involve the [[dental restoration|restoration of teeth]] as a treatment for dental caries (fillings), [[dental extraction|extraction]] or surgical removal of teeth which cannot be restored, [[scaling and root planing|scaling]] of teeth to treat periodontal problems and endodontic [[endodontic therapy|root canal]] treatment to treat abscessed teeth.

All dentists in the United States undergo at least two years of undergraduate studies, but most complete a bachelors degree.  This schooling is followed by four years of dental school to qualify as a "[[Doctor of Dental Surgery]]" (DDS) or "[[Doctor of Dental Medicine]]" (DMD). Dentists need to complete additional qualifications or training to carry out more complex treatments such as [[sedation]], [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]], and [[dental implant]]s.

By nature of their general training they can carry out the majority of dental treatments such as restorative (fillings, [[crown (dentistry)|crowns]], [[bridge (dentistry)|bridges]]), prosthetic ([[dentures]]), endodontic (root canal) therapy, periodontal (gum) therapy, and exodontia (extraction of teeth), as well as performing examinations, radiographs (x-rays) and diagnosis. Dentists can also prescribe medications such as [[antibiotic]]s, [[sedative]]s, and any other drugs used in patient management.

===Prevention===
Dentists also encourage prevention of oral diseases through proper [[hygiene]] and regular, twice yearly, checkups for professional cleaning and evaluation. Conditions in the oral cavity may be indicative of systemic diseases such as [[osteoporosis]], [[diabetes]], or [[cancer]]. Many studies have also shown that [[gum disease (disambiguation)|gum disease]] is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, [[heart disease]], and [[preterm birth]].

==Education and licensing==
[[File:Early dental chair, Shamrock, TX IMG 6151.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Early dental chair in [[Pioneer West Museum]] in [[Shamrock, Texas]]]]

Dr. John M. Harris started the world's first dental school in [[Bainbridge, Ross County, Ohio|Bainbridge, Ohio]], and helped to establish dentistry as a health profession. It opened on 21 February 1828, and today is a [[Harris Dental Museum|dental museum]].<ref>Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1217-1218.</ref> The first dental college, [[Baltimore College of Dental Surgery]], opened in Baltimore, Maryland, USA in 1840.   Philadelphia Dental College was founded in 1863 and is the second in the United States. In 1907 Temple University accepted a bid to incorporate the school.

Studies showed that dentists graduated from different countries,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zadik Yehuda, Levin Liran |title=Clinical decision making in restorative dentistry, endodontics, and antibiotic prescription |journal=J Dent Educ |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=81–6 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18172239 |doi= |url= }}</ref> or even from different dental schools in one country,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zadik Yehuda, Levin Liran |title=Decision making of Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University Dental Schools graduates in every day dentistry—is there a difference? |journal=J Isr Dent Assoc |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=19–23 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16886872 |doi= |url= }}</ref> may have different clinical decisions for the same clinical condition. For example, dentists graduated from [[Israel]]i dental schools may recommend more often for the removal of asymptomatic impacted [[third molar]] (wisdom teeth) than dentists graduated from Latin American or Eastern European dental schools.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zadik Yehuda, Levin Liran |title=Decision making of Israeli, East European, and South American dental school graduates in third molar surgery: is there a difference? |journal=J Oral Maxillofac Surg |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=658–62 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17368360 |doi= 10.1016/j.joms.2006.09.002|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WKF-4N8JDW3-J&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=734474d0fe654970b56c219106722fb6 |accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, the 1878 British Dentists Act and 1879 Dentists Register limited the title of "dentist" and "dental surgeon" to qualified and registered practitioners.<ref name="125years">Gelbier, Stanley. [http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v199/n7/full/4812875a.html 125 Years of Developments in Dentistry]. British Dental Journal (2005); 199, 470–473. Page accessed 11 December 2007. The 1879 register is referred to as the "Dental Register".</ref><ref name="bdatimeline" /> However, others could legally describe themselves as "dental experts" or "dental consultants".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19550208&id=Ihc1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=9aULAAAAIBAJ&pg=2264,3628076|title=Failure of Act|publisher=[[The Glasgow Herald]]|date=8 February 1955|accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref> The practice of dentistry in the United Kingdom became fully regulated with the 1921 Dentists Act, which required the registration of anyone practicing dentistry.<ref>[http://www.rcsed.ac.uk/site/682/default.aspx History of Dental Surgery in Edinburgh], hosted on the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh website.

There are sixteen dental schools in the UK, five of which are for postgraduate applicants only. Thus the competition for places can be fierce.<ref>[http://www.prospects.ac.uk/dentist_entry_requirements.htm Dentist Entry Requirements], hosted on Prospects website. Page accessed 30 October 2011</ref> Because of the low numbers of dental schools, funding for building and service developments in the schools can be very high. Well known UK universities providing dental courses are the Universities of [[University of Leeds|Leeds]], [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], [[University of Cardiff|Cardiff]], [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's Belfast]], [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham]], [[University of Bristol|Bristol]], [[University of Dundee|Dundee]], [[University of Manchester|Manchester]], [[University of Sheffield|Sheffield]] and [[King's College London]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/table/2011/may/17/university-guide-dentistry | work=The Guardian | title=Dentistry | date=17 May 2011}}</ref>

In Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Finland, Sweden, Brazil, Chile, the United States, and Canada, a dentist is a healthcare professional qualified to practice dentistry after graduating with a degree of either Doctor of Dental Surgery ([[Doctor of Dental Surgery|DDS]]) or Doctor of Dental Medicine ([[Doctor of Dental Medicine|DMD]]). This is equivalent to the Bachelor of Dental Surgery/Baccalaureus Dentalis Chirurgiae ([[Bachelor of Dental Surgery|BDS, BDent, BChD, BDSc]]) that is awarded in the UK and British Commonwealth countries. In most western countries, to become a qualified dentist one must usually complete at least four years of postgraduate study{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}; within the [[European Union]] the education has to be at least five years. Dentists usually complete between five and eight years of post-secondary education before practising. Though not mandatory, many dentists choose to complete an internship or residency focusing on specific aspects of dental care after they have received their dental degree.

==Specialties {{anchor|Specialities<!--alt spelling-->}} ==
{{Main|Specialty (dentistry)}}
The [[American Dental Association]] recognizes ten dental specialties: [[public health dentistry]], [[endodontics]], [[oral and maxillofacial pathology]], [[oral and maxillofacial radiology]], [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]], [[orthodontics]], [[pediatric dentistry]], [[periodontics]], [[prosthodontics]], and [[general dentistry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/104.aspx |title=Dental Specialties |publisher=American Dental Association (ADA) |date= |accessdate=2010-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://predds.net/dental-specialties |title=Dental Specialties PreDDS.NET |publisher=PreDDS.NET |date= |accessdate=2010-12-24}}</ref> There are other dental niches such as [[oral medicine]], [[dental aesthetics]], [[dental implantation]], [[dental anesthesiology]], and [[orofacial pain]] and [[temporomandibular disorder]]s; some of them are recognized as dental specialties in other countries. In the European Union all member states must recognize the specialties of orthodontics and oral and maxillofacial surgery.

==History==
[[File:Johann Liss 002a.jpg|thumb|left|''Farmer at the dentist'', [[Johann Liss]], c. 1616–17.]]

The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (IVC) has yielded evidence of dentistry being practised as far back as 7000 BC.<ref name=Coppa>Coppa, A. et al. 2006.

A [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] text from 5000 BC describes a "tooth worm" as the cause of [[dental caries]].<ref name="adahistory">[http://www.ada.org/public/resources/history/timeline_ancient.asp History of Dentistry: Ancient Origins], hosted on the [http://www.ada.org American Dental Association] website. Page accessed 9 January 2007.</ref> Evidence of this belief has also been found in ancient India, [[Egypt]], Japan, and China. The legend of the worm is also found in the writings of [[Homer]], and as late as the 14th century AD the surgeon [[Guy de Chauliac]] still promoted the belief that worms cause tooth decay.<ref name="suddickhistorical">Suddick, Richard P. and Norman O.

The [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]], written in the 17th century BC but which may reflect previous manuscripts from as early as 3000 BC, includes the treatment of several dental ailments.<ref>Arab, M. Sameh.

[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] scholars [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aristotle]] wrote about dentistry, including the eruption pattern of teeth, treating decayed teeth and [[gum disease (disambiguation)|gum disease]], extracting teeth with [[forceps]], and using wires to stabilize loose teeth and fractured jaws.<ref>[http://www.ada.org/public/resources/history/timeline_ancient.asp History of Dentistry Ancient Origins]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> Some say the first use of dental appliances or [[bridge (dentistry)|bridges]] comes from the [[Etruscans]] from as early as 700 BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcpsg.ac.uk/hdrg/2006May8.htm |title=History of Dentistry Research Page, Newsletter |publisher=Rcpsg.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}</ref> Further research suggested that 3000 B.C. In ancient Egypt, Hesi-Re is the first named "dentist" (greatest of the teeth). The Egyptians bind replacement teeth together with gold wire. [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] medical writer [[Cornelius Celsus]] wrote extensively of oral diseases as well as dental treatments such as narcotic-containing [[emollients]] and [[astringents]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/1995/Dentistry-Skill-superstition.html |title=Dentistry – Skill And Superstition |publisher=Science.jrank.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dentaltreatment.org.uk/history.html |title=Dental Treatment in the Ancient Times |publisher=Dentaltreatment.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}</ref> The earliest [[amalgam (dentistry)|dental amalgams]] were first documented in a [[Tang Dynasty]] medical text written by the Chinese physician Su Kung in 659, and appeared in Germany in 1528.<ref name="Bjørklund1">{{cite journal |author=Bjørklund G |title=The history of dental amalgam (in Norwegian) |journal=Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen |volume=109 |issue=34-36 |pages=3582–3585 |year=1989 |pmid=2694433 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name=czarnetzki>{{cite journal|last=Czarnetzki|first=A.|coauthors=Ehrhardt S.|title=Re-dating the Chinese amalgam-filling of teeth in Europe|journal=International Journal of Anthropology|year=1990|volume=5|issue=4|pages=325–332}}</ref>

Historically, dental extractions have been used to treat a variety of illnesses. During the [[Middle Ages]] and throughout the 19th century, dentistry was not a profession in itself, and often dental procedures were performed by barbers or general [[physician]]s. [[Barber]]s usually limited their practice to extracting teeth which alleviated [[pain]] and associated chronic tooth [[infection]]. Instruments used for dental extractions date back several centuries. In the 14th century, [[Guy de Chauliac]] invented the dental pelican<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.dmd.co.il/antiques |title=Antique Dental Instruments |publisher=Dmd.co.il |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}</ref> (resembling a [[pelican]]'s beak) which was used to perform [[dental extraction]]s up until the late 18th century. The pelican was replaced by the [[dental key]]<ref name="autogenerated1" /> which, in turn, was replaced by modern forceps in the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
[[File:Dental office.jpg|thumb|right|A modern Dentist's chair]]
The first book focused solely on dentistry was the "Artzney Buchlein" in 1530,<ref>[http://www.ada.org/public/resources/history/timeline_midlage.asp History of Dentistry Middle Ages]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> and the first dental textbook written in English was called "Operator for the Teeth" by Charles Allen in 1685.<ref name="bdatimeline">[http://www.bda.org/museum/the-story-of-dentistry/timeline.aspx The story of dentistry: Dental History Timeline], hosted on the British Dental Association website. Page accessed 2 March 2010.</ref> It was between 1650 and 1800 that the science of modern dentistry developed. The English physician [[Thomas Browne]] in his ''[[A Letter to a Friend]]'' (pub. post. 1690) made an early dental observation with characteristic humour –

{{Quote|The Egyptian Mummies that I have seen, have had their Mouths open, and somewhat gaping, which affordeth a good opportunity to view and observe their Teeth, wherein 'tis not easie to find any wanting or decayed: and therefore in Egypt, where one Man practised but one Operation, or the Diseases but of single Parts, it must needs be a barren Profession to confine unto that of drawing of Teeth, and little better than to have been Tooth-drawer unto King Pyrrhus, who had but two in his Head.}}

It{{who|date=October 2012}} is said that the 17th-century French physician [[Pierre Fauchard]] started dentistry science as it is known today, and he has been named ''"the father of modern dentistry"''.<ref>[http://www.fauchard.org/publications/history/history.htm History of Dentistry Articles]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> Among many of his developments were the extensive use of [[Prosthodontics|dental prosthesis]], the introduction of [[dental fillings]] as a treatment for [[dental caries]] and the statement that sugar derivative acids such as [[tartaric acid]] are responsible for dental decay.

There has been a problem of [[quackery]] in the history of dentistry, and accusations of quackery among some dental practitioners persist today.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ring|first=Malvin E|year=1998|title=Quackery in Dentistry – Past and Present|journal=Journal of the California Dental Association|url=http://www.cda.org/library/cda_member/pubs/journal/jour1198/quackery.html|accessdate=21 March 2009}}</ref>

==Priority patients==
UK NHS priority patients include patients with congenital abnormalities (such as [[cleft palates]] and [[hypodontia]]), patients who have suffered orofacial trauma and those being treated for [[cancer]] in the head and neck region. These are treated in a multidisciplinary team approach with other hospital based dental specialities [[orthodontics]] and [[maxillofacial surgery]]. Other priority patients include those with infections (either third molars or necrotic teeth) or avulsed permanent teeth, as well as patients with a history of smoking or smokeless tobacco with ulcers in the oral cavity also.
