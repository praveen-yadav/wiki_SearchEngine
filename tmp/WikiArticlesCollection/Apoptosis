In contrast to [[necrosis]], which is a form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury, apoptosis generally confers advantages during an organism's life cycle. For example, the differentiation of fingers and toes in a developing human [[embryo]] occurs because cells between the fingers apoptose; the result is that the digits are separate. Unlike necrosis, apoptosis produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies that phagocytic cells are able to engulf and quickly remove before the contents of the cell can spill out onto surrounding cells and cause damage.<ref>{{cite book |last=Alberts |first=Bruce |last2=Johnson |first2=Alexander |last3=Lewis |first3=Julian |last4=Raff |first4=Martin |last5=Roberts |first5=Keith |last6=Walter |first6=Peter |title=[[Molecular Biology of the Cell (textbook)]] |edition=5th |publisher=[[Garland Science]] |page=1115 |chapter=Chapter 18 Apoptosis: Programmed Cell Death Eliminates Unwanted Cells |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8153-4105-5}}</ref>

Research in and around apoptosis has increased substantially since the early 1990s. In addition to its importance as a biological phenomenon, defective apoptotic processes have been implicated in an extensive variety of diseases. Excessive apoptosis causes [[atrophy]], whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation, such as [[cancer]].

==Discovery and etymology==
{{Main|History and highlights in apoptosis research}}

German scientist [[Carl Vogt]] was first to describe the principle of apoptosis in 1842. In 1885, anatomist [[Walther Flemming]] delivered a more precise description of the process of programmed cell death. However, it was not until 1965 that the topic was resurrected. While studying tissues using electron microscopy, John Foxton Ross Kerr at University of Queensland was able to distinguish apoptosis ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ''apo'' - from/off/without, ''ptosis'' - falling) from traumatic cell death.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kerr|first=JF.|year=1965|title=A histochemical study of hypertrophy and ischaemic injury of rat liver with special reference to changes in lysosomes|journal=[[Journal of Pathology and Bacteriology]]|issue=90|pages=419–35|doi=10.1002/path.1700900210|volume=90}}</ref> Following the publication of a paper describing the phenomenon, Kerr was invited to join Alastair R Currie, as well as [[Andrew Wyllie]], who was Currie's graduate student,<ref name="AHW 1972">{{cite web|url = http://www.a-star.edu.sg/astar/biomed/action/biomed_dvp_abstract.do?id=2901ddeb02dH |title=Prof Andrew H.

In 1972, the trio published a seminal article in the [[British Journal of Cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kerr JF, Wyllie AH, Currie AR |title=Apoptosis: a basic biological phenomenon with wide-ranging implications in tissue kinetics |journal=Br.

Kerr, Wyllie and Currie credited James Cormack, a professor of Greek language at [[University of Aberdeen]], with suggesting the term apoptosis. Kerr received the [[Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize]] on March 14, 2000, for his description of apoptosis. He shared the prize with Boston biologist [[Robert Horvitz]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Rourke MG, Ellem KA |title=John Kerr and apoptosis |journal=Med. J.

Sulston]] for their work identifying genes that control apoptosis.  The genes were identified by studies in the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' and these same genes function in humans for apoptosis.
[[File:John Sulston.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John E. Sulston]] won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2002, for his pioneering research on apoptosis.]]
In Greek, apoptosis translates to the "dropping off" of petals or leaves from plants or trees. Cormack, professor of Greek language, reintroduced the term for medical use as it had a medical meaning for the Greeks over two thousand years before. [[Hippocrates]] used the term to mean "the falling off of the bones". [[Galen]] extended its meaning to "the dropping of the scabs". Cormack was no doubt aware of this usage when he suggested the name. Debate continues over the correct pronunciation, with opinion divided between a pronunciation with the second ''p'' silent ({{IPAc-en|æ|p|ə|ˈ|t|oʊ|s|ɨ|s}} {{respell|ap-ə|TOH|sis}}<ref name="bartleby.com"/><ref name="aboutapop">{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/sigs/aig/Aboutapo.html|title=About apoptosis|accessdate=2006-12-15|year=1999|author=Apoptosis Interest Group| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061228100402/http://www.nih.gov/sigs/aig/Aboutapo.html| archivedate= 28 December 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>) and the second ''p'' pronounced ({{IPAc-en|æ|p|ə|p|ˈ|t|oʊ|s|ɨ|s}}),<ref name="bartleby.com"/><ref name="webster.com">[http://www.webster.com/dictionary/apoptosis Webster.com dictionary entry]</ref> as in the original Greek.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In English, the ''p'' of the Greek ''-pt-'' [[consonant cluster]] is typically silent at the beginning of a word (e.g. [[pterodactyl]], [[Ptolemy]]), but articulated when used in combining forms preceded by a vowel, as in [[helicopter]] or the orders of insects: [[diptera]], [[lepidoptera]], etc.

In the original Kerr Wyllie and Currie paper, British Journal of Cancer, 1972 Aug;26(4):239-57, there is a footnote regarding the pronunciation:

<blockquote>"We are most grateful to Professor James Cormack of the Department of Greek, University of Aberdeen, for suggesting this term. The word "apoptosis" ({{lang|grc|ἀπόπτωσις}}) is used in Greek to describe the "dropping off" or "falling off" of petals from flowers, or leaves from trees. To show the derivation clearly, we propose that the stress should be on the penultimate syllable, the second half of the word being pronounced like "ptosis" (with the "p" silent), which comes from the same root "to fall", and is already used to describe the drooping of the upper eyelid."</blockquote>

==Process==
[[Image:Apoptosis.png|right]]
[[File:Control Of The Apoptosis Mecanisms.pdf|thumb|alt=Control Of The Apoptotic hai Mechanisms|Control Of The Apoptotic Mechanisms]]
The process of apoptosis is controlled by a diverse range of [[cell signalling|cell signals]], which may originate either extracellularly (''extrinsic inducers'') or intracellularly (''intrinsic inducers''). Extracellular signals may include [[toxin]]s,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Popov SG, Villasmil R, Bernardi J |title=Lethal toxin of Bacillus anthracis causes apoptosis of macrophages |journal=Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. |volume=293 |issue=1 |pages=349–55 |year=2002 |month=April |pmid=12054607 |doi=10.1016/S0006-291X(02)00227-9 |url=}}</ref> [[hormone]]s, [[growth factor]]s, [[nitric oxide]]<ref name="NO">{{cite journal |author=Brüne B |title=Nitric oxide: NO apoptosis or turning it ON? |journal=Cell Death Differ. |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=864–9 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12867993 |doi=10.1038/sj.cdd.4401261 |url=}}</ref> or [[cytokine]]s, that must either cross the plasma membrane or [[signal transduction|transduce]] to effect a response. These signals may positively (i.e., trigger) or negatively (i.e., repress, inhibit, or dampen) affect apoptosis. (Binding and subsequent trigger of apoptosis by a molecule is termed ''positive induction'', whereas the active repression or inhibition of apoptosis by a molecule is termed ''negative inductio''n.)

A cell initiates intracellular apoptotic signaling in response to a stress, which may bring about cell suicide. The binding of nuclear receptors by [[glucocorticoid]]s,<ref name="robspath">{{cite book | title=Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease| last=Cotran| author2=Kumar, Collins| publisher=W.B Saunders Company| location=Philadelphia| isbn=0-7216-7335-X | year=1998 | first=Ramzi, S.}}</ref> heat,<ref name="robspath"/> radiation,<ref name="robspath"/> nutrient deprivation,<ref name="robspath"/> viral infection,<ref name="robspath"/> [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]<ref name="robspath"/> and increased intracellular [[calcium]] concentration,<ref>[http://www.nature.com/ncb/journal/v5/n12/full/ncb1203-1041.html Calcium orchestrates apoptosis].

A number of cellular components, such as [[poly ADP ribose polymerase]], may also help regulate apoptosis.<ref name="parp1">{{cite journal | author=Chiarugi A, Moskowitz MA| title=PARP-1—a perpetrator of apoptotic cell death?| journal=Science| year=2002| volume=297| issue=5579| pages=259–63| doi=10.1126/science.1074592| pmid=12114611}}</ref>

Before the actual process of cell death is precipitated by enzymes, apoptotic signals must cause regulatory proteins to initiate the apoptosis pathway. This step allows apoptotic signals to cause cell death, or the process to be stopped, should the cell no longer need to die. Several proteins are involved, but two main methods of regulation have been identified: targeting [[mitochondria]] functionality, or directly transducing the signal via [[adaptor proteins]] to the apoptotic mechanisms. Another extrinsic pathway for initiation identified in several toxin studies is an increase in calcium concentration within a cell caused by drug activity, which also can cause apoptosis via a calcium binding protease [[calpain]].

===Mitochondrial regulation===
The [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] are essential to multicellular life.  Without them, a cell ceases to [[aerobic respiration|respire aerobically]] and quickly dies. This fact forms the basis for some apoptotic pathways.  Apoptotic proteins that target mitochondria affect them in different ways.  They may cause mitochondrial swelling through the formation of membrane pores, or they may increase the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and cause apoptotic effectors to leak out.<ref name="robspath"/>  These are very closely related to intrinsic pathway, and tumors arise more frequently through intrinsic pathway than the extrinsic pathway because of sensitivity.<ref>Mohan S, Bustamam A, Abdelwahab SI, Al-Zubairi AS, Aspollah M, Abdullah R, Elhassan MM, Ibrahim MY, Syam S: Typhonium flagelliforme induces apoptosis in CEMss cells via activation of caspase-9, PARP cleavage and cytochrome c release: Its activation coupled with G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Journal of ethnopharmacology 2010</ref> There is also a growing body of evidence indicating that [[nitric oxide]] is able to induce apoptosis by helping to dissipate the [[membrane potential]] of mitochondria and therefore make it more permeable.<ref name="NO"/> Nitric oxide has been implicated in initiating and inhibiting apoptosis through its possible action as a signal molecule of subsequent pathways that activate apoptosis.<ref>Brune, B. et al 1999. "Nitric oxide (NO): an effector of apoptosis." Cell Death and Differentiation. 6:10 pg 969-975.</ref>{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Mitochondrial proteins known as SMACs (small mitochondria-derived activator of [[caspase]]s) are released into the [[cytosol]] following an increase in permeability.  SMAC binds to ''[[Inhibitor of apoptosis|inhibitor of apoptosis proteins]]'' (IAPs) and deactivates them, preventing the IAPs from arresting the apoptotic process and therefore allowing apoptosis to proceed.  IAP also normally suppresses the activity of a group of [[cysteine protease]]s called [[caspase]]s,<ref name="caspcontrol">{{cite journal | author=Fesik SW, Shi Y.| title=Controlling the caspases| journal=Science| year=2001| volume=294| issue=5546| pages=1477–8| doi=10.1126/science.1062236| pmid=11711663}}</ref> which carry out the degradation of the cell, therefore the actual degradation enzymes can be seen to be indirectly regulated by mitochondrial permeability.

[[Cytochrome c]] is also released from mitochondria due to formation of a channel, the [[mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel]] (MAC), in the outer mitochondrial membrane,<ref name="knife">{{cite journal | author=Laurent M. Dejean, Sonia Martinez-Caballero, Kathleen W. Kinnally| title=Is MAC the knife that cuts cytochrome c from mitochondria during apoptosis? | journal=Cell Death and Differentiation| year=2006| volume=13| url=http://www.nature.com/cdd/journal/v13/n8/full/4401949a.html
 | doi = 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401949| pages=1387–5 | pmid=16676005 | issue=8}}</ref> and serves a regulatory function as it precedes morphological change associated with apoptosis.<ref name="robspath"/>  Once cytochrome c is released it binds with Apoptotic protease activating factor - 1 (''[[Apaf-1]]'') and [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], which then bind to ''pro-caspase-9'' to create a protein complex known as an [[apoptosome]].  The apoptosome cleaves the pro-caspase to its active form of [[caspase-9]], which in turn activates the effector ''caspase-3''.

[[MAC, the Mitochondrial Apoptosis-Induced Channel|MAC]] (not to be confused with the Membrane Attack Complex formed by complement activation, also commonly denoted as MAC), also called "Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization Pore" is regulated by various proteins, such as those encoded by the mammalian [[Bcl-2 family]] of anti-apoptopic genes, the homologs of the ''[[CED9 (gene)|ced-9]]'' gene found in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''.<ref name="knife2">{{cite journal |author=Dejean LM, Martinez-Caballero S, Manon S, Kinnally KW |title=Regulation of the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel, MAC, by BCL-2 family proteins |journal=Biochim.

Two theories of the direct initiation of apoptotic mechanisms in mammals have been suggested: the ''TNF-induced'' ([[tumour necrosis factor]]) model and the  ''Fas-Fas [[ligand]]-mediated'' model, both involving receptors of the ''TNF receptor'' (TNFR) family<ref name="fas">{{cite journal | author=Wajant H| title=The Fas signaling pathway: more than a paradigm| journal=Science| year=2002| volume=296| issue=5573| pages=1635–6| doi=10.1126/science.1071553| pmid=12040174}}</ref> coupled to extrinsic signals.

====TNF path====
TNF is a [[cytokine]] produced mainly by activated [[macrophage]]s, and is the major extrinsic mediator of apoptosis. Most cells in the human body have two receptors for TNF: ''TNF-R1'' and ''TNF-R2''. The binding of TNF to ''TNF-R1'' has been shown to initiate the pathway that leads to caspase activation via the intermediate membrane proteins ''TNF receptor-associated death domain'' (TRADD) and ''Fas-associated death domain protein'' cIAP1/2 inhibit TNF-α signaling by binding to TRAF2. FLIP inhibits the activation of caspase-8 ([[FADD]]).<ref name="tnfr1">{{cite journal | author=Chen G, Goeddel DV| title=TNF-R1 signaling: a beautiful pathway| journal=Science| year=2002| volume=296| issue=5573| pages=1634–5| doi=10.1126/science.1071924| pmid=12040173}}</ref> Binding of this receptor can also indirectly lead to the activation of [[transcription factor]]s involved in cell survival and inflammatory responses.<ref name="tfnpathway">{{cite journal | author=Goeddel, DV| title=Connection Map for Tumor Necrosis Factor Pathway| journal=[[Science Signaling|Science STKE]]| url=http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/cm/CMP_7107
 | doi = 10.1126/stke.3822007tw132 }}</ref> The link between TNF and apoptosis shows why an abnormal production of TNF plays a fundamental role in several human diseases, especially in [[autoimmune disease]]s.

The [[Fas receptor]] (also known as ''Apo-1'' or ''CD95'') binds the [[FAS ligand|Fas ligand]] (FasL), a [[transmembrane protein]] part of the TNF family.<ref name="fas"/> The interaction between Fas and FasL results in the formation of the ''death-inducing signaling complex'' (DISC), which contains the FADD, caspase-8 and caspase-10. In some types of cells (type I), processed caspase-8 directly activates other members of the caspase family, and triggers the execution of apoptosis of the cell. In other types of cells (type II), the ''Fas''-DISC starts a feedback loop that spirals into increasing release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria and the amplified activation of caspase-8.<ref name="fassignal">{{cite journal | author=Wajant, H.| title=Connection Map for Fas Signaling Pathway| journal=[[Science Signaling|Science STKE]]| url=http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/cm/CMP_7966 | doi = 10.1126/stke.3802007tr1 }}</ref>

====Common components====
Following ''TNF-R1'' and ''Fas'' activation in mammalian cells a balance between proapoptotic ([[Bcl-2-associated X protein|BAX]],<ref name="bax">{{cite journal |author=Murphy KM, Ranganathan V, Farnsworth ML, Kavallaris M, Lock RB |title=Bcl-2 inhibits Bax translocation from cytosol to mitochondria during drug-induced apoptosis of human tumor cells |journal=Cell Death Differ. |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=102–11 |year=2000 |month=January |pmid=10713725 |doi=10.1038/sj.cdd.4400597 |url=}}</ref> [[BH3 interacting domain death agonist|BID]], [[Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer|BAK]], or [[Bcl-2-associated death promoter|BAD]]) and anti-apoptotic (''[[Bcl-Xl]]'' and ''[[Bcl-2]]'') members of the ''Bcl-2'' family is established. This balance is the proportion of proapoptotic [[homodimer]]s that form in the outer-membrane of the mitochondrion. The proapoptotic homodimers are required to make the mitochondrial membrane permeable for the release of caspase activators such as cytochrome c and SMAC. Control of proapoptotic proteins under normal cell conditions of nonapoptotic cells is incompletely understood, but in general, Bax or Bak are activated by the activation of BH3-only proteins, part of the [[Bcl-2]] family.

=====Caspases=====
Caspase  play the central role in the transduction of DR apoptotic signals. Caspases are proteins that are highly conserved, cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases. There are two types of caspases: initiator caspases, caspase 8,10,9,2, and effector caspases, caspase 3,7,6. The activation of initiator caspases requires binding to specific oligomeric adaptor protein. Effector caspases are then activated by these active initiator caspases through proteolytic cleavage. The active effector caspases then proteolytically degrade a host of intracellular proteins to carry out the cell death program.

====Caspase-independent apoptotic pathway====
There also exists a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway that is mediated by AIF ([[apoptosis-inducing factor]]).<ref name="pmid9989411">{{cite journal |author=Susin SA, Lorenzo HK, Zamzami N |title=Molecular characterization of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor |journal=Nature |volume=397 |issue=6718 |pages=441–6 |year=1999 |month=February |pmid=9989411 |doi=10.1038/17135}}</ref>

===Execution===
Many pathways and signals lead to apoptosis, but there is only one mechanism that actually causes the death of a cell.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} After a cell receives stimulus, it undergoes organized degradation of cellular organelles by activated [[proteolytic]] [[caspase]]s. A cell undergoing apoptosis shows a characteristic morphology:

==Pathway knock-outs==
Many [[gene knockout|knock-out]]s have been made in the apoptosis pathways to test the function of each of the proteins.  Several caspases, in addition to APAF-1 and FADD, have been mutated to determine the new phenotype.  In order to create a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) knockout, an exon containing the nucleotides 3704-5364 was removed from the gene.  This exon encodes a portion of the mature TNF domain, as well as the leader sequence which is a highly conserved region necessary for proper intracellular processing.  TNF-/- mice develop normally and have no gross structural or morphological abnormalities.  However, upon immunization with SRBC (sheep red blood cells), these mice demonstrated a deficiency in the maturation of an antibody response; they were able to generate normal levels of IgM, but could not develop specific IgG levels.  Apaf-1 is the protein that turns on caspase 9 by cleavage to begin the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis.  Since a -/- mutation in the APAF-1 gene is embryonic lethal, a gene trap strategy was used in order to generate an APAF-1 -/- mouse.  This assay is used to disrupt gene function by creating an intragenic gene fusion.  When an APAF-1 gene trap is introduced into cells, many morphological changes occur, such as spina bifida, the persistence of interdigital webs, and open brain.  Additionally, after embryonic day 12.5, the brain of the embryos showed several structural changes.  APAF-1 cells are protected from apoptosis stimuli such as irradiation.  A BAX-1 knock-out mouse exhibits normal forebrain formation and a decreased programmed cell death in some neuronal populations and in the spinal cord, leading to an increase in motor neurons.

The caspase proteins are integral parts of the apoptosis pathway, so it follows that knock-outs made have varying damaging results.  A caspase 9 knock-out leads to a severe brain malformation.  A caspase 8 knock-out leads to cardiac failure and thus embryonic lethality.  However, with the use of cre-lox technology, a caspase 8 knock-out has been created that exhibits an increase in peripheral T cells, an impaired T cell response, and a defect in neural tube closure.  These mice were found to be resistant to apoptosis mediated by CD95, TNFR, etc. but not resistant to apoptosis caused by UV irradiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and other stimuli.  Finally, a caspase 3 knock-out was characterized by ectopic cell masses in the brain and abnormal apoptotic features such as membrane blebbing or nuclear fragmentation.  A remarkable feature of these KO mice is that they have a very restricted phenotype: Casp3, 9, APAF-1 KO mice have deformations of neural tissue and FADD and Casp 8 KO showed defective heart development, however in both types of KO other organs developed normally and some cell types were still sensitive to apoptotic stimuli suggesting that unknown proapoptotic pathways exist.

==Methods for distinguishing apoptotic from necrotic (necroptotic) cells==
In order to perform analysis of apoptotic versus necrotic (necroptotic) one can do analysis of morphology by time-lapse microscopy, flow fluorocytometry, and transmission electron microscopy. There are  also various biochemical techniques for analysis of cell surface markers (phosphatidylserine exposure versus cell permeability by flow fluorocytometry), cellular markers such as DNA fragmentation (flow fluorocytometry), caspase activation, Bid cleavage, and cytochrome c release (Western blotting). It is important to know how primary and secondary necrotic cells can be distinguished by analysis of supernatant for caspases, HMGB1, and release of cytokeratin 18.  
However, no distinct surface or biochemical markers of necrotic (necroptotic) cell death have been identified yet, and only negative markers are available. These include absence of apoptotic parameters (caspase activation, cytochrome c release, and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation) and differential kinetics of cell death markers (phosphatidylserine exposure and cell membrane permeabilization). A selection of techniques that can be used to distinguish apoptosis from necroptotic cells could be found in these references. <ref name="methods">{{cite journal | author=Krysko DV, Vanden Berghe T, Parthoens E, D'Herde K, Vandenabeele P.| title=Methods for distinguishing apoptotic from necrotic cells and measuring their clearance.| journal=Methods Enzymol.| year=2008| volume=442| pages=307–41| doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(08)01416-X| pmid=18662577}}</ref><ref name="methods">{{cite journal | author=Krysko DV, Vanden Berghe T, D'Herde K, Vandenabeele P.| title=Apoptosis and necrosis: detection, discrimination and phagocytosis.| journal=Methods. | year=2008| volume=44| issue=3 |pages=205–21| doi=10.1016/j.ymeth.2007.12.001| pmid=18314051}}</ref><ref name="methods">{{cite journal | author=Vanden Berghe T, Grootjans S, Goossens V, Dondelinger Y, Krysko DV, Takahashi N, Vandenabeele P.| title=Determination of apoptotic and necrotic cell death in vitro and in vivo.| journal=Methods.| year=2013| doi= 10.1016/j.ymeth.2013.02.011| pmid= 23473780| volume=61| issue=2| pages=117–29}}</ref>

===Defective pathways===
The many different types of apoptotic pathways contain a multitude of different biochemical components, many of them not yet understood.<ref name="pathogenesis">{{cite journal | author=Thompson, CB| title=Apoptosis in the pathogenesis and treatment of disease| journal=Science| year=1995| volume=267| issue=5203| pages=1456–62| doi=10.1126/science.7878464| pmid=7878464}}</ref> As a pathway is more or less sequential in nature, it is a victim of causality; removing or modifying one component leads to an effect in another. In a living organism this can have disastrous effects, often in the form of disease or disorder. A discussion of every disease caused by modification of the various apoptotic pathways would be impractical, but the concept overlying each one is the same: the normal functioning of the pathway has been disrupted in such a way as to impair the ability of the cell to undergo normal apoptosis. This results in a cell that lives past its "use-by-date" and is able to replicate and pass on any faulty machinery to its progeny, increasing the likelihood of the cell becoming cancerous or diseased.

A recently described example of this concept in action can be seen in the development of a lung cancer called NCI-H460.<ref name="h460">{{cite journal |author=Yang L, Mashima T, Sato S |title=Predominant suppression of apoptosome by inhibitor of apoptosis protein in non-small cell lung cancer H460 cells: therapeutic effect of a novel polyarginine-conjugated Smac peptide |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=831–7 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12591734 |doi= |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12591734}}</ref> The ''X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein'' ([[XIAP]]) is [[Gene expression|overexpressed]] in cells of the H460 [[cell line]]. XIAPs bind to the processed form of caspase-9, and suppress the activity of apoptotic activator [[cytochrome c]], therefore overexpression leads to a decrease in the amount of proapoptotic agonists. As a consequence, the balance of anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic effectors is upset in favour of the former, and the damaged cells continue to replicate despite being directed to die.

====Dysregulation of p53====
The tumor-suppressor protein [[p53]] accumulates when DNA is damaged due to a chain of biochemical factors. Part of this pathway includes alpha-[[interferon]] and beta-interferon, which induce transcription of the ''p53'' gene and result in the increase of p53 protein level and enhancement of cancer cell-apoptosis.<ref name="takaoka">{{cite journal | author=Takaoka A| title=Integration of interferon-alpha/beta signalling to p53 responses in tumour suppression and antiviral defence| journal=Nature| year=2003| volume=424| issue=6948| pmid=12872134| pages=516–23| doi=10.1038/nature01850 | last2=Hayakawa | first2=S | last3=Yanai | first3=H | last4=Stoiber | first4=D | last5=Negishi | first5=H | last6=Kikuchi | first6=H | last7=Sasaki | first7=S | last8=Imai | first8=K | last9=Shibue | first9=T}}</ref> p53 prevents the cell from replicating by stopping the [[cell cycle]] at G1, or interphase, to give the cell time to repair, however it will induce apoptosis if damage is extensive and repair efforts fail. Any disruption to the regulation of the ''p53'' or interferon genes will result in impaired apoptosis and the possible formation of tumors.

===Inhibition===
Inhibition of apoptosis can result in a number of cancers, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and viral infections. It was originally believed that the associated accumulation of cells was due to an increase in cellular proliferation, but it is now known that it is also due to a decrease in cell death. The most common of these diseases is cancer, the disease of excessive cellular proliferation, which is often characterized by an overexpression of [[inhibitor of apoptosis|IAP]] family members. As a result, the malignant cells experience an abnormal response to apoptosis induction: cycle regulating genes (such as p53, ras or c-myc) are mutated or inactivated in diseased cells, and further genes (such as bcl-2) also modify their expression in tumors.

====HeLa cell====
Apoptosis in [[HeLa]] cells is inhibited by proteins produced by the cell; these inhibitory proteins target retinoblastoma tumor suppressing proteins.<ref name=DelPuerto/> These tumor suppressing proteins regulate the cell cycle, but are rendered inactive when bound to an inhibitory protein.<ref name=DelPuerto/> HPV E6 and E7 are inhibitory proteins expressed by the human papillomavirus, HPV being responsible for the formation of the cervical tumor from which HeLa cells are derived.<ref name=Liu>{{cite journal |author=Liu HC, Chen GG, Vlantis AC, Tse GM, Chan AT, van Hasselt CA |title=Inhibition of apoptosis in human laryngeal cancer cells by E6 and E7 oncoproteins of human papillomavirus 16 |journal=J.

''[[Journal of Cellular Biochemistry]]'' 78:334–349</ref> CDV (Canine Distemper Virus) is able to induce apoptosis despite the presence of these inhibitory proteins. This is an important oncolytic property of CDV: this virus is capable of killing canine lymphoma cells. Oncoproteins E6 and E7 still leave p53 inactive, but they are not able to avoid the activation of caspases induced from the stress of viral infection. These [[oncolytic]] properties provided a promising link between CDV and lymphoma apoptosis which can lead to development of alternative treatment methods for both canine [[lymphoma]] and human non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Defects in the cell cycle are thought to be responsible for certain tumor cells resisting chemotherapy or radiation, so a virus that can induce apoptosis despite defects in the cell cycle is useful for cancer treatment.<ref name="Liu McKalip" />

====Treatments====
The main method of treatment for death signaling-related diseases involves either increasing or decreasing the susceptibility of apoptosis in diseased cells, depending on whether the disease is caused by either the inhibition of or excess apoptosis. For instance, treatments aim to restore apoptosis to treat diseases with deficient cell death, and to increase the apoptotic threshold to treat diseases involved with excessive cell death. To stimulate apoptosis, one can increase the number of death receptor ligands (such as TNF or TRAIL), antagonize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 pathway, or introduce Smac mimetics to inhibit the inhibitor (IAPs). The addition of agents such as Herceptin, Iressa or Gleevec works to stop cells from cycling and causes apoptosis activation by blocking growth and survival signaling further upstream. Finally, adding p53-MDM2 complexes displaces p53 and activates the p53 pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Many different methods can be used either to stimulate or inhibit apoptosis in various places along the death signaling pathway.<ref>Böhm I. Apoptosis in physiological and pathological skin: implications for therapy. Curr Mol Med 2006;6(No.4):375-394 url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16900661</ref>

Apoptosis is a multi-step, multi-pathway cell-death programme that is inherent in every cell of the body. In cancer, the apoptosis cell-division ratio is altered. Cancer treatment by chemotherapy and  irradiation kills target cells primarily by inducing apoptosis.

===Hyperactive apoptosis===
On the other hand, loss of control of cell death (resulting in excess apoptosis) can lead to neurodegenerative diseases, hematologic diseases, and tissue damage.  The progression of HIV is directly linked to excess, unregulated apoptosis.  In a healthy individual, the number of CD4+ lymphocytes is in balance with the cells generated by the bone marrow; however, in HIV-positive patients, this balance is lost due to an inability of the bone marrow to regenerate CD4+ cells.  In the case of HIV, CD4+ lymphocytes die at an accelerated rate through uncontrolled apoptosis, when stimulated.

====Treatments====
Treatments aiming to inhibit apoptosis work to simultaneously inhibit the expression of proapoptotic factors and promote the expression of anti-apoptotic factors. Fas-induced apoptosis can be blocked by use of FLIPs (FLICE-inhibitory proteins, which inhibit caspases-8 and -10), Bcl-2 (which prevents cytochrome c release and the subsequent activation of caspase 9), and CrmA (Cytokine response modifier A). Increasing the concentration of IAPs works to block specific caspases. Finally, the Akt protein kinase promotes cell survival through two pathways. Akt phosphorylates and inhibits Bas (a Bcl-2 family member), causing Bas to interact with the 14-3-3 scaffold, resulting in Bcl dissociation and thus cell survival. Akt also activates IKKα, which leads to NF-κB activation and cell survival. Active NF-κB induces the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis. NF-κB has been found to play both an antiapoptotic role and proapoptotic role depending on the stimuli utilized and the cell type.<ref name="Farhana, L.

===HIV progression===
The progression of the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] infection into [[AIDS]] is primarily due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T-helper lymphocytes]] in a manner that is too rapid for the body's bone marrow to replenish the cells, leading to a compromised immune system. One of the mechanisms by which T-helper cells are depleted is apoptosis, which results from a series of biochemical pathways:<ref name="Judie">{{cite journal | author=Judie B. Alimonti, T. Blake Ball, Keith R. Fowke| title=Mechanisms of CD4+ T lymphocyte cell death in human immunodeficiency virus infection and AIDS| journal=J Gen Virology| year=2003| issue= 7| url=http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/84/7/1649
 | doi = 10.1099/vir.0.19110-0| pages=1649–61| pmid=12810858 | volume=84}}</ref>
#HIV enzymes deactivate anti-apoptotic ''Bcl-2''. This does not directly cause cell death, but primes the cell for apoptosis should the appropriate signal be received.  In parallel, these enzymes activate proapoptotic ''procaspase-8'', which does directly activate the mitochondrial events of apoptosis.
#HIV may increase the level of cellular proteins which prompt Fas-mediated apoptosis.
#HIV proteins decrease the amount of [[CD4]] glycoprotein marker present on the cell membrane.
#Released viral particles and proteins present in extracellular fluid are able to induce apoptosis in nearby "bystander" T helper cells.
#HIV decreases the production of molecules involved in marking the cell for apoptosis, giving the virus time to replicate and continue releasing apoptotic agents and virions into the surrounding tissue.
#The infected CD4+ cell may also receive the death signal from a cytotoxic T cell.

Cells may also die as a direct consequence of viral infection. HIV-1 expression induces tubular cell G2/M arrest and apoptosis.<ref>Vashistha H, Husain M, Kumar D, Yadav A, Arora S, Singhal PC. (2008)Ren Fail. 2008;30(6):655-64.</ref>  The progression from HIV to AIDS is not immediate or even necessarily rapid; HIV's cytotoxic activity towards CD4+ lymphocytes is classified as AIDS once a given patient's CD4+ cell count falls below 200.<ref>{{cite web|author=&copy;2013 Indiana University Health |url=http://iuhealth.org/riley/infectious-diseases/hiv/aids-defining-criteria/ |title=AIDS Defining Criteria &#124; Riley |publisher=IU Health |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20}}</ref>

===Viral infection===
Viral induction of apoptosis occurs when one or several cells of a living organism is infected with a [[virus]] leading to cell death. Cell death in organisms is necessary for the normal development of cells and the cell cycle maturation.<ref name=Indran>{{cite journal |author=Indran IR, Tufo G, Pervaiz S, Brenner C |title=Recent advances in apoptosis, mitochondria and drug resistance in cancer cells |journal=Biochim.

Viruses can trigger apoptosis of infected cells via a range of mechanisms including:
*Receptor binding.
*Activation of [[protein kinase R]] (PKR).
*Interaction with p53.
*Expression of viral proteins coupled to MHC proteins on the surface of the infected cell, allowing recognition by cells of the immune system (such as Natural Killer and cytotoxic T cells) that then induce the infected cell to undergo apoptosis.<ref name=Everett>{{cite journal | author=Everett, H. and McFadden, G. | title=Apoptosis: an innate immune response to virus infection | journal=Trends Microbiol | year=1999 | pages=160–5 | volume=7 | issue=4 | pmid= 10217831 | doi=10.1016/S0966-842X(99)01487-0}}</ref>
[[Canine distemper virus]] (CDV) is known to cause apoptosis in central nervous system and lymphoid tissue of infected dogs in vivo and in vitro.<ref name=Nishi>{{cite journal |author=Nishi T, Tsukiyama-Kohara K, Togashi K, Kohriyama N, Kai C |title=Involvement of apoptosis in syncytial cell death induced by canine distemper virus |journal=Comp.

Apoptosis caused by CDV is typically induced via the [[extrinsic pathway]] which activates [[caspases]] that disrupt cellular function and eventually leads to the cells death.<ref name=DelPuerto>{{cite journal |author=Del Puerto HL, Martins AS, Milsted A, ''et al.'' |title=Canine distemper virus induces apoptosis in cervical tumor derived cell lines |journal=Virol. J. |volume=8 |issue= |page=334 |year=2011 |pmid=21718481 |pmc=3141686 |doi=10.1186/1743-422X-8-334 |url=}}</ref> In normal cells CDV activates caspase-8 first which works as the initiator protein followed by the executioner protein caspase-3.<ref name=DelPuerto/>  However apoptosis induced by CDV in HeLa cells does not involve the initiator protein caspase-8. HeLa cell apoptosis caused by CDV follows a different mechanism than in vero cell lines.<ref name=DelPuerto/>  This change in the caspase cascade suggests CDV induces apoptosis via the [[intrinsic apoptosis|intrinsic pathway]], excluding the need for the initiator caspase-8. The executioner protein is instead activated by the internal stimuli caused by viral infection not a caspase cascade.<ref name=DelPuerto/>

The [[Oropouche virus]] (OROV) is found in the family ''[[Bunyaviridae]]''. The study of apoptosis brought on by ''Bunyaviridae'' was initiated in 1996 when it was observed that apoptosis was induced by the La Crosse virus into the kidney cells of baby hamsters and into the brains of baby mice.<ref name=Acrani>{{cite journal |author=Acrani GO, Gomes R, Proença-Módena JL, ''et al.'' |title=Apoptosis induced by Oropouche virus infection in HeLa cells is dependent on virus protein expression |journal=Virus Res. |volume=149 |issue=1 |pages=56–63 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20080135 |doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2009.12.013}}</ref>

OROV is a disease that is transmitted between humans by the biting midge (''[[Culicoides paraensis]]'').<ref name=Azevedo>{{cite journal |author=Azevedo RS, Nunes MR, Chiang JO, ''et al.'' |title=Reemergence of Oropouche fever, northern Brazil |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=912–5 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17553235 |pmc=2792853 |doi=10.3201/eid1306.061114}}</ref> It is referred to as a [[zoonotic]] [[arbovirus]] and causes febrile illness, characterized by the onset of a sudden fever known as Oropouche fever.<ref name=Santos>{{cite journal |author=Santos RI, Rodrigues AH, Silva ML, ''et al.'' |title=Oropouche virus entry into HeLa cells involves clathrin and requires endosomal acidification |journal=Virus Res. |volume=138 |issue=1-2 |pages=139–43 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=18840482 |doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2008.08.016 }}</ref>

The Oropouche virus also causes disruption in cultured cells - cells which are cultivated in distinct and specific conditions. An example of this can be seen in [[HeLa cells]] whereby the cells begin to degenerate shortly after they are infected.<ref name=Acrani/> 

With the use of [[gel electrophoresis]], it can be observed that OROV causes [[DNA]] fragmentation in HeLa cells. It can be interpreted by counting, measuring and analyzing the cells of the Sub/G1 cell population.<ref name=Acrani/> When HeLA cells are infected with OROV, the [[cytochrome C]] is released from the membrane of the mitochondria, into the cytosol of the cells. This type of interaction shows that apoptosis is activated via an intrinsic pathway.<ref name=Indran/> 

In order for apoptosis to occur within OROV, viral uncoating, viral internalization, along with the replication of cells is necessary. Apoptosis in some viruses is activated by extracellular stimuli, however, studies have demonstrated that the OROV infection causes apoptosis to be activated through intracellular stimuli and involves the mitochondria.<ref name=Acrani/>

Many viruses encode proteins that can inhibit apoptosis.<ref name=Teodora>{{cite journal | author=Teodoro, J.G. Branton, P.E. | title=Regulation of apoptosis by viral gene products | journal=J Virol | year=1997 | pages=1739–46 | volume=71 | issue=3 | pmid= 9032302 | pmc=191242}}</ref> Several viruses encode viral homologs of Bcl-2. These homologs can inhibit proapoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK, which are essential for the activation of apoptosis.

Whilst a number of viruses can block the effects of TNF and Fas. For example the M-T2 protein of myxoma viruses can bind TNF preventing it from binding the TNF receptor and inducing a response.<ref name=Hay>{{cite journal

Consequently p53 cannot induce apoptosis since it cannot induce the expression of proapoptotic proteins. The adenovirus E1B-55K protein and the [[hepatitis B virus]] HBx protein are examples of viral proteins that can perform such a function.<ref name=Wang>{{cite journal | author=Wang, X.W. Gibson, M.K.

Viruses can remain intact from apoptosis particularly in the latter stages of infection. They can be exported in the ''apoptotic bodies'' that pinch off from the surface of the dying cell and the fact that they are engulfed by phagocytes prevents the initiation of a host response. This favours the spread of the virus.<ref name="Hay"/>

==Plants==
[[Programmed cell death]] in plants has a number of molecular similarities to animal apoptosis, but it also has differences, notably the presence of a [[cell wall]] and the lack of an [[immune system]] which removes the pieces of the dead cell.  Instead of an immune response, the dying cell synthesizes substances to break itself down and places them in a [[vacuole]] which ruptures as the cell dies.  Whether this whole process resembles animal apoptosis closely enough to warrant using the name ''apoptosis'' (as opposed to the more general ''programmed cell death'') is unclear.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://elfosscientiae.cigb.edu.cu/PDFs/BA/2006/23/1/BA002301RV001-010.pdf | title = Programmed cell death in plants resembles apoptosis of animals | author = Cyrelys Collazo, Osmani Chacón, Orlando Borrás | journal = Biotecnología Aplicada | year = 2006 | volume = 23 | pages = 1–10 }}</ref>

==Caspase independent apoptosis==
The characterization of the caspases allowed the development of caspase inhibitors which can be used to determine whether a cellular process involves active caspases. Using these inhibitors it was discovered that cells can die while displaying a morphology similar to apoptosis without caspase activation.<ref>Xiang J. et al, BAX-induced cell death may not require interleukin 1β-converting enzyme-likeproteases, 1996, cell biology</ref> Later studies linked this phenomenon to the release of AIF ([[Apoptosis-inducing factor|apoptosis inducing factor]]) from the mitochondria and its translocation into the nucleus mediated by its NLS (nuclear localization signal). Inside the mitochondria, AIF is anchored to the inner membrane. In order to be released the protein is cleaved by a calcium-dependent [[Calpain|calpain protease]].

==Apoptosis protein subcellular location prediction==
In 2003, a method was developed for predicting subcellular location of apoptosis proteins.<ref>Zhou, G. P. & Doctor, K. (2003). Subcellular location prediction of apoptosis proteins. PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Genetics 50, 44-48.</ref>
Subsequently, various modes of Chou's [[pseudo amino acid composition]] were developed for improving the quality of predicting subcellular localization of apoptosis proteins based on their sequence information alone.
