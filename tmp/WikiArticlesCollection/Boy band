A '''boy band''' (or '''boyband''') is loosely defined as a  [[vocal group]] consisting of young male singers, usually in their teenage years or in their twenties at the time of formation. Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play [[musical instrument]]s, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term something of a [[misnomer]]. However, exceptions do exist. Most boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances.

Some such bands form on their own. They can evolve out of church choral or [[gospel music]] groups, but are often created by [[talent manager]]s or record producers who hold auditions. Due to this and their general commercial orientation towards a female audience of [[preteen]]s, [[teenybopper]]s, or teens, the term may be used with negative connotations in [[music journalism]]. Boy bands are similar in concept to their counterparts, [[girl group]]s.

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest form of boy band music took place in the late 19th century with the use of a capella [[Barbershop quartets]].  They were usually a group of males and sang in four part harmonies. The popularity of Barbershop quartets had been prominent into the earlier part of the 20th century. A revival of the male vocal group took place in the late 1940s and 1950s with the use of [[doo-wop]] music. Doo-wop bands sang about topics such as love and other themes used in pop music. The earliest traces of boy bands were in the mid-1950s although the term boy band was not used. [[The Ink Spots]] was one of the first of what we would now call boy bands. The term boy band was not established until the late 1980s as before that they were called male vocal groups or hep harmony singing groups.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://didyouknow.org/boybands/ |title=Boy bands |publisher=Did you know |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref>

===1960s: The Osmonds, the Jackson 5 and the Monkees===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
[[File:The-Osmonds.jpg|thumb|The Osmonds]]
Although the term "boy band" is mostly associated with groups from the 1990s onwards, the earliest predecessors of this format were groups such as [[the Osmonds]], [[the Jackson 5]], and [[the Monkees]], which helped form the template for boy bands.  While the Monkees were originally a manufactured act turned real band that featured members with distinct (albeit fictional) personality types, [[the Jackson 5]] were a family group that established many musical conventions that boy bands follow. For instance, their music featured [[close harmony| close harmonies]] from [[soul music]] and catchy pop hooks influenced as much as they were by [[Motown]] and acts like [[the Supremes]]. All members of the band sang, which is a common convention of a boy band, as opposed to having a front man and the rest on instruments; thus, no one person dominated the stage. Even so, the members conveniently fitted into the convention of having stereotypical personality types (e.g. [[Michael Jackson]] being the "cute one").

Although not a boy band, [[the Beatles]] set a precedent for boy bands to follow both in terms of marketing to young girls and certain aesthetic and musical conventions. The merchandising, whether it was films like ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film) |A Hard Day's Night]]'' or novelty goods, were possibly the first aimed at a certain demographic on a large scale for a group. This made them a prototype for boy bands, such as the Jackson 5 and the Monkees. Musical conventions that boy bands adopted from the Beatles were mostly the catchy pop hooks, melodies and harmonies combined with their marketability. Their marketability was based on the idea that there was something for everyone, whether it was the music or the personality of [[John Lennon]] or [[Paul McCartney]] or their [[sex appeal]].

The Beatles were more directly an influence on boy bands that use rock band instrumentation. The precedent for this was when TV Producers [[Bert Schneider]] and [[Bob Rafelson]] got four members to perform catchy pop tunes while also acting in a television series. The [[Monkees]] are often considered as the original pioneers among boy bands as they were the first example of a manufactured boy band. Formed in 1965 under the supervision of [[Don Kirshner]], the group became dissatisfied with Kirshner's control over them and they became independent two years later working on their own up to 1970.

===1970s and 1980s: Menudo, New Edition, and New Kids on the Block===
Other antecedents (apart from those already mentioned) exist throughout the history of pop music. The genre has been copied into languages and cultures other than the Anglo-American. The Puerto Rican boy band [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], appealing to young [[Latina]] audiences, was founded in 1977. Menudo had a convention unique among boy bands: when a member turned 16, became too tall, or their voice changed, they were replaced.  The members of Menudo were generally aged 12–14.

The [[Bay City Rollers]] were a [[Scotland|Scottish]] pop band who were most popular in the mid-1970s. The ''[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]'' noted that they were "[[tartan]] teen sensations from [[Edinburgh]]", and were "the first of many acts heralded as the 'Biggest Group since The Beatles' and one of the most screamed-at teeny-bopper acts of the 1970s".<ref name= "British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums|edition= 19th|publisher= Guinness World Records |location= London|isbn= 1-904994-10-5|page = 45}}</ref>  For a relatively brief but fervent period (nicknamed "Rollermania"), they were worldwide [[teen idol]]s.  The group were one of the first bands like The Monkees before them to take the formula shown by [[The Beatles]] and apply it to a teen market. The group achieved the same amount of success but for a limited period of time. At the peak of their popularity in the UK, comparisons were being made to [[The Beatles]]. Also by this time, Bay City Roller [[fan (person) |fans]] had a completely distinctive style of dress, the main elements of which were ankle-length [[tartan]] trousers and tartan [[scarf|scarves]], the group using the benefit of merchandise and promotion.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book| first= Martin C | last = Strong| year = 2000| title = The Great Rock Discography | edition = 5th|publisher= Mojo |location= Edinburgh|pages= 2–3|isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>

In the US, the [[Cleveland]]-based [[power pop]] group [[Raspberries (band)| Raspberries]] was generally interpreted as a "teen act", although all the band members played their own music. Vocalist [[Eric Carmen]] later commented, "You’d have a thousand screaming girls in the front of the stage and then ten very serious rock critics in the back of the room going, ‘Uh-huh, I think we understand this.’ And unfortunately the great mass of pot-smoking 18-year-olds that bought albums and made you a substantial commodity in the great marketing world of records never took to us.  It was not hip for people to like us, because their little sister liked us."<ref>{{Citation | last = Knopper | first = Steve | contribution = Raspberries | title = Contemporary Musicians | publisher = Gale | year = 2004 | series = Encyclopedia | date = December 26, 2009 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/}}.</ref>

[[New Edition]] was a [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] group formed in Boston in 1978. The group reached their height of popularity during the 1980s. They were the progenitors of the boy band movement of the 1980s and 1990s in the US. The group recorded mostly as a quintet.

Formed in 1982, [[Norwegians| Norwegian]] band [[A-ha]] became the first [[Continental Europe]]an boyband to top the [[US Hot 100]] with their single "[[Take on Me]]" in 1985. Although considered a [[one hit wonder]] in that country the group went on to have considerable success worldwide and lasting success.

[[Bros]] (abbreviation of the word "brothers") were a British boy band active in the late 1980s and early 1990s, consisting of twin brothers [[Matt Goss| Matt]] and [[Luke Goss]] along with [[Craig Logan]]. Formed in 1986, they scored multiple top 10 hits between 1987 and 1989. In Britain Bros also became the first modern era–style boyband to have a multiple platinum selling album with ''[[Push (Bros album)|Push]]'' in 1988, which is still one of the most successful boyband albums in the UK. Other big boybands in Britain during the late eighties were [[Big Fun (boyband) | Big Fun]] and [[Brother Beyond]].

Boston group [[New Edition]] is often credited for starting the boy band trend in the 1980s, even though the term "boy band" did not exist until the 1990s. [[Maurice Starr]] was influenced by New Edition and popularised it with his [[Mentorship |protégé]] [[New Kids on the Block]], the first commercially successful modern boy band who formed in 1984 and found international success in 1988. Starr's idea was to take the traditional template from the R&B genre (in this case his teenage band [[New Edition]]) and apply it to a pop genre.

===1990s: Boyz II Men, Take That, Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync===
Some managers in Europe soon created their own acts after being inspired by [[New Kids on the Block]]. First beginning with [[Nigel Martin-Smith]]'s [[Take That]] in the UK who formed in 1990 and followed by [[Tom Watkins (music manager) | Tom Watkins]] who had success with [[Bros]] in the late eighties and formed [[East 17]] in 1991 who were marketed and pitted against Take That as rivals with a harsher attitude, style and sound. Although in previous years [[Bros]] and [[New Kids on the Block]] had achieved number one singles in the UK, it was Take That who were the first group to completely dominate the charts. Between their first number one single in 1993 and last in 1996 and before their 2005 reunion only one single failed to reach the top spot. This making them one of the most successful groups in British music chart history and the inspiration for most British pop groups ever since.  Irish music manager [[Louis Walsh]], who had witnessed the impact of these two British boy bands, put out an advert for an 'Irish Take That' thereby creating [[Boyzone]] in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/boyzone/biography.html | work =Boyzone | title = Biography |publisher=Lyrics freak |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref> [[Let Loose]] formed in 1993, [[MN8]] and [[911 (band) |911]] formed in 1995, and [[Damage (British band)|Damage]] formed in 1996 were also boy bands who enjoyed success in Britain; however by the late 1990s all these bands had ran their course and split up.

All these artists were very successful on both the singles and albums charts domestically and internationally however with the emergence of [[britpop]] and the commercial co-option of [[indie rock]], many boy bands were ridiculed by the British music press as having no artistic credibility. The media attention was now placed on the [[Battle of Britpop]] and the bands [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]] replaced the importance and rivalry of Take That and [[East 17]] as the two new biggest bands in Britain. However, other boybands found success in the late nineties like [[Five (band)|Five]], [[Another Level (band)|Another Level]], [[Point Break (band)|Point Break]] and [[Westlife]]. In 1995 successful German music manager [[Frank Farian]] who had been manager of [[Boney M]] and [[Milli Vanilli]] put together [[Latin American]] band [[No Mercy (pop band)|No Mercy]] who scored a few worldwide hits during the mid nineties.

Although being American and the sons of [[Tito Jackson]], a member of [[The Jackson 5]], [[3T]] had several hits singles across Europe in the mid-1990s, despite limited success in the [[United States of America | US]], and finished the second biggest selling act of 1996 in Europe behind [[Spice Girls]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.sortmusic.com/_0/3t-biography,len.html |title=3T Biography |publisher=Sort music |accessdate=August 5, 2012}}</ref>

With the success of North American boybands like [[New Kids On The Block]] in East Asia, Japanese entertainment company [[Johnny & Associates]] formed [[SMAP]] in 1992. The group enjoyed tremendous success and paved the way for more Asian boy bands like [[Arashi]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_music_artists_in_Japan |title=wiki |publisher=Wiki |accessdate=September 12, 2013}}</ref> 

[[File:Backstreet Boys 2005.jpg|thumb|left|[[Backstreet Boys]] are the best-selling boy band in history.]]
In the mid-1990s in North America, most boy bands were African American and had R&B and gospel elements, such as the group [[All-4-One]] formed in 1993 and [[Boyz II Men]] formed in 1988. [[Boyz II Men]] are also the most successful boy band act on the [[U.S. Hot 100]] as well as the [[Australian Singles Chart]]. Although they had success on the Billboard charts, they had been targeted to more of an adult audience and were not marketed for youth. It wasn't until 1997 and the change to pop oriented groups like [[Backstreet Boys]], [[98 Degrees]], [['N Sync]], [[The Moffatts]], and [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] that boy bands exploded commercially and dominated the market in the United States. This late nineties era marked the height of boy band popularity in North America which hasn't been seen since.

Arguably the most successful boy band manager from the U.S. was [[Lou Pearlman]], who founded commercially successful acts such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] in 1993, [['N Sync]] and [[LFO (group)|LFO]] in 1995, [[O-Town (band)|O-Town]] in 2000, and [[US5]] in 2005. Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync became the two biggest boy bands in late 1990s until early 2000s, and Backstreet Boys went on to become the best selling boy band in history with over 130 million records sold.<ref name = "garcia1">{{cite news|url= http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2010/02/143_61233.html|title= Backstreet Boys Share Secrets to Success|last=Garcia|first=Cathy Rose A |work=[[The Korea Times]]|date=February 22, 2010|accessdate = January 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Backstreet Boys back, for good|url = http://www.straight.com/article-160145/backstreet-boys-back-good |publisher=Straight |accessdate=May 31, 2012|date=September 4, 2008}}</ref>

In the late nineties in the UK, producer [[Simon Cowell]] (noted in the U.S. for the American Idol/X Factor franchise) is also known for having managed British boyband [[Five (band)|Five]] which was formed in 1997 and Irish boyband [[Westlife]] which was formed in 1998. Westlife was created by Irishman [[Louis Walsh]] as a replacement for [[Boyzone]]<ref>{{cite web| url = http://uk.tv.yahoo.com/x-factor/judges/louis-walsh.html | work = Press Association | title = Louis Walsh Profile | publisher= Yahoo! |accessdate= January 9, 2010}}</ref> and was initially managed by a former member of the band [[Ronan Keating]]. Westlife would eventually overtake Take That in number one's tally in the UK although Take That's overall UK sales are still higher. In 2012, the [[Official Charts Company]] revealed the biggest selling singles artists in British music chart history with Take That placed 15th overall and the highest selling boyband act (9 million), followed by Boyzone at 29 (7.1 million) and Westlife at 34 (6.8 million).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-20-biggest-selling-groups-of-all-time-revealed-1682/ | title = The Official Top 20 biggest selling groups of all time revealed!|publisher=Official charts |accessdate=November 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-singles-charts-biggest-selling-artists-of-all-time-revealed-1431/ |title=Official Singles Charts' biggest selling artists of all time revealed | publisher =Official charts |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}</ref> Even though Cowell is known to have managed several successful boy bands, he is also infamous for passing on signing two of the biggest boybands to emerge from the 1990s and 2000s, Take That and [[Busted (band)|Busted]].<ref>{{cite web| first =Alasdair | last = Glennie |url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2118414/Simon-Cowell-admits-turned-Take-That-overweight-Gary-Barlow.html | title =Simon Cowell admits that he turned down Take That because of 'overweight' Gary Barlow |work=Daily Mail |date = March 22, 2012 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bebo.com/BlogView.jsp?MemberId=7322368642&BlogId=7651779757 |title=Blog |publisher=Bebo |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref>

===2000s: Backstreet Boys, Westlife, Jonas Brothers, Super Junior and F4===
[[File:JonasBrothers.JPG|thumb|180px|[[Jonas Brothers]] are described as pop boy band]]
With the continued success of [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[*NSYNC]], American and British groups like [[98 Degrees]], [[Dream Street]], [[O-Town (band)|O-Town]], [[A1 (band)|A1]], [[Blue (English band)|Blue]], and [[Busted (band) | Busted]] gained quick popularity both domestically and internationally. International boy bands would also occasionally spring up, such as the [[Moldova]]n band [[O-Zone]] (better known today as an [[Numa numa|Internet meme]]), and [[Overground (band)|Overground]]. American Christian boy band [[Plus One (band)| Plus One]] also enjoyed brief remarkable success during this time.

At the height of boy band popularity in [[North America]], MTV created their own parody boyband, [[2gether (band) | 2gether]]. Like [[The Monkees]] in the 1960s, they were a manufactured act, featuring members with a distinct fictional type. 2gether played off of the idea that every successful boy band must have five distinct personality types: the bad boy, the shy one, the young one, the older brother type, and a heart throb. All of the members of 2gether were actors and have moved onto other projects since the end of the MTV series that followed the made for TV movie.

Since 2001, the dominance of traditional boy bands on pop charts began to fade, although Gil Kaufman of [[MTV.com | MTV]] has described "new boy bands" that are "more likely to resemble [[Good Charlotte]], [[Simple Plan]].<ref name = "mtv">{{cite web|url= http://www.mtv.com/bands/b/boy_bands/050207/ |title=The New Boy Bands|accessdate = November 8, 2007 | publisher=MTV|year=2007| first =Gil | last = Kaufman}}</ref>

In 2001, Taiwanese boy band [[F4 (band)|F4]] (called JVKV since 2007)<ref>{{cite news | first = Vivien | last = Wang | title = Boy band changes name F4 into JVKV | url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/lifestyle/2007-04/29/content_863824.htm | work = [[China Daily]] | date = April 29, 2007 | accessdate =May 31, 2007}}</ref> blew up big as a result of the success of their TV drama [[Meteor Garden]]. Their popularity spread throughout Asia, including China, Hong Kong, Singapore, [[Malaysia]], Thailand, [[Indonesia]], Japan, [[South Korea]] and [[Philippines]]. With their success, many other Taiwanese boy bands emerged around this time, such as [[5566]] and [[Fahrenheit (Taiwanese band)|Fahrenheit]]. Also in 2001, a new all-male pop band and dance group boyband hailing from Japan called [[Exile (Japanese band) | Exile]], debuted under Avex Group's label [[Rhythm Zone]] with 14 members, putting them on par with [[Super Junior]], a South Korean boy band, who had 13 members at its peak.

In North America, the [[Jonas Brothers]] rose to fame from promotion on the [[Disney Channel]], enabling them to sell over 180,000 copies of their album in a week in 2008 and hit number one on the American Billboard 200. Other new boy bands like [[JLS]] and [[Mindless Behavior]] also experienced remarkable success around this time. However, apart from them, boy bands haven't seen the commercial boom experienced in the genre from the mid to late nineties in North America.

In South Korea, [[Super Junior]] rose to fame from their hit single "[[Sorry, Sorry (song)|Sorry, Sorry]]", in 2008, under SM Entertainment.

===2010s: NKOTBSB, Big Time Rush, One Direction, The Wanted, and comebacks of 1990s-early 2000s boy bands===
Moving into the 2010s boy bands are still hugely popular especially in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe due to the continued commercial presence and longevity of nineties boy bands such as [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[Westlife]], and the successful comeback of [[Take That]] in 2005, [[Boyzone]] in 2007, and [[New Kids on the Block]] in 2008. Some sections of the press have referred to these acts, particularly those who have reformed after a previous split, such as Take That, Boyzone, and [[98 Degrees]], as 'man bands'.<ref>{{cite web|title=98 Degrees reunites as 'man band' on 'Today' show| work = The Los Angeles Times | url= http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-98-degrees-reunites-today-show-20120817,0,3400710.story |accessdate=September 14, 2012|date=August 17, 2012}}</ref> These older generation boy bands chart alongside the new boy bands.

[[File:One Direction Sydney 6.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[One Direction]] rose to fame in 2011.]]
Early 2010s also marks the resurgence of boy band popularity in countries where the trend had not maintained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2012/04/rise-and-return-boy-band|title=The rise and return of the boy band|publisher=Hampton Roads|date=April 29, 2012|accessdate= June 29, 2012}}</ref> It began in 2010 with the emergence of new boy bands like [[Big Time Rush (band)|Big Time Rush]], [[The Wanted]], and [[One Direction]]; and the formation of supergroup [[NKOTBSB]] which comprised New Kids on the Block and Backstreet Boys. NKOTBSB's success inspired boy bands who were fairly popular during 1990s and 2000s to make a comeback, such as [[Blue (English band)|Blue]], 98 Degrees. At the same time, the success of One Direction, The Wanted, and Big Time Rush prompted the formation of many new boy bands around the world. Like [[2gether (band)|2gether]] and [[The Monkees]], Big Time Rush was a manufactured act created for a television show.

In Southeast Asia, local boy bands also started to emerge as a result of the resurgence and continued success of Korean and Japanese boy bands such as [[Shinhwa]], [[Super Junior]], [[TVXQ]], [[Big Bang (South Korean band)|Big Bang]], [[SHINee]], [[Exo (band)|Exo]], [[U-KISS]], [[2PM]], [[2AM]], and [[Arashi]]. One of the boy bands who emerged as a result of [[Hallyu]] (Korean wave) is Indonesia's [[SM*SH]] and [[S4 (band)|S4]] who enjoyed prominent success domestically.

In 2013, thanks to ''[[The Big Reunion]]'', [[Five (band)|Five]] and [[911 (band)|911]] reunited.

==Key factors of the concept==
Seen as important to a "boy band" group's commercial success is the group's [[Reputation|image]], carefully controlled by managing all aspects of the group's dress, promotional materials (which are frequently supplied to [[teen magazine]]s), and music videos. The key factor of a boy band is being trendy. This means that the band conforms to the most recent fashion and musical trends in the popular music scene. Typically, each member of the group will have some distinguishing feature and be portrayed as having a particular personality stereotype, such as "the baby," "the bad boy," or "the shy one."  While managing the portrayal of popular musicians is as old as [[popular music]], the particular pigeonholing of band members is a defining characteristic of boy and girl bands. Some South Korean record labels like [[YG Entertainment]], [[JYP Entertainment]] or [[S.M. Entertainment]] control even where their artists live.

In most cases, their music is written, arranged and produced by a producer who works with the band at all times and controls the group's sound – if necessary, to the point of hiring [[session singers]] to record guide vocals for each member of the group to sing individually if the members cannot harmonize well together. However, for clarity of each voice, recording each voice individually is most commonly the norm with most modern vocal groups.  In recent years [[auto-tune]] has become a popular tool for boy bands who are unable to sing properly. Some boy bands have come under fire for this issue of using auto-tune. Some have also come under fire for [[lip syncing]] in their performances as well, for example [[New Kids on the Block]].<ref>{{cite web | title = New Kids' Performance Was Dubbed, Critic Says | url = http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-03-04/news/9203040523_1_mcpherson-new-kids-starr |publisher = Orlando Sentinel | accessdate =August 15, 2012|date=March 4, 1992}}</ref>

A typical boy band performance features elaborately choreographed dancing, with the members taking turns singing and/or rapping. Boy bands generally do not compose or produce their own material, unless the members lobby hard enough for creative control. However, some bands were created around the talent of a songwriter within the group like [[Gary Barlow]] of [[Take That]] or [[Tony Mortimer]] of [[East 17]]. [[Five (band)|Five]] were another group who wrote virtually all their own songs. It is not uncommon to find extra songs on an album written by one or more of the band members; however, their producers rarely use these as singles.

Since the 21st century, however, boy bands have been expected to write or at least contribute in some part lyrically to songs. Apart from the groups mentioned above who all had at least one primary songwriter from their beginning, other groups soon caught up.  From the late nineties, members of [[Backstreet Boys]] who had previously used writers like [[Max Martin]] or Gary Baker during their early albums began writing their own songs. Modern groups of the last ten years such as [[JLS]] have all made a point from early interviews that they write their own songs and hold their own image as this is an important part of marketing. Some bands like [[The Wanted]] have even spent time learning the craft of songwriting.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a329584/the-wanted-go-to-songwriting-camp-to-write-new-album.html |title=The Wanted go to songwriting camp to write new album |work=Digital Spy |date=July 13, 2011 | place = [[United Kingdom |UK]] | accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref>

Individuals can also go on to achieve greater success as a solo artist coming out of a boy band having used the groups popularity to build on. Usually this signals the end of the group until potential future reunions. Examples of this include [[Michael Jackson]] from [[The Jackson 5]], [[Donny Osmond]] from [[The Osmonds]], [[Ricky Martin]] from [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], [[Justin Timberlake]] from *NSYNC, [[Jordan Knight]] from New Kids on the Block, and [[Ronan Keating]] from [[Boyzone]]. Sometimes the most successful solo star from a band is not the member most obvious such as [[Robbie Williams]] as opposed to lead singer [[Gary Barlow]] from [[Take That]]. Some boy band members have gone on to successful careers elsewhere in the media. [[Michael Dolenz]] of [[The Monkees]] went on to become a successful television producer, working for [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] franchises such as [[LWT]] and [[Television South]].

==Music genres==
Although most boy bands consist of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] or pop influences, other [[music genre]]s, most notably [[country music]] and [[folk music]], are also represented. [[South 65]] and [[Marshall Dyllon]], for example, were both country music boy bands. [[Il Divo]], created by [[Simon Cowell]] in 2004, are a vocal group that performs [[Operatic pop]] in several (mainly Italian) languages. Since then operatic/classical boy bands have become quite popular and common, especially in the UK. Since 2001 there has been some crossover with [[power pop]] and [[pop punk]] from bands that play live instruments. For example, as of 2008, boy bands are often influenced by pop punk, [[post-grunge]] and power pop (a perennial genre). Just recently some boy bands decided to go back to their original doo-wop roots, most notably, [[The Overtones]].

==Controversy==
Since the 1990s, bands such as [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[LFO (group)|LFO]] have disliked the term "boy band" and have preferred to be known as a "male vocal group".<ref>{{cite web| title = I would be the dessert because I’m satisfying | url = http://www.popjustice.com/interviewsandfeatures/backstreet-boys-interview/49849/|publisher= Pop Justice | accessdate = August 16, 2012|date=October 24, 2007|quote=We were never a boyband.

Such criticisms can become extremely scathing. Boy bands are often seen as being short lived, although some acts such as [[The Jackson 5]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[Human Nature (band)|Human Nature]], [[SMAP]], and [[Westlife]] (before they split up in 2012) have sustained lasting careers, and bands like [[New Kids On The Block]], [[Boyzone]], and [[Take That]] have had successful comebacks.<ref>{{cite web| publisher = Google Blogger | url = http://filipinocultured.blogspot.com/2008/05/new-kids-on-block-on-today-show.html |title= New Kids On The Block Today Show Videos | work =Filipino cultured |date=May 16, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6480113.ece |title= Why are Take That's fans so loyal? |work=The Times |date=June 22, 2012 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref>
