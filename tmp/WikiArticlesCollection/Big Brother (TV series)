'''''Big Brother''''' is a [[Reality television#Reality competition/game shows|reality game show]] franchise created by [[John de Mol]]. The premise of the show is that there is a group of people that are housemates or houseguests living together in a large, usually specially constructed house. During their time in the house they are isolated from the outside world and are not commonly aware of outside events. Contestants are continuously monitored by in-house television cameras as well as personal audio microphones during their stay. Each series lasts for about three months, with 10–20 contestants entering the house. To win the final cash prize, a contestant must survive periodic (usually weekly) evictions and be the last housemate or houseguest remaining in the compound by the series' conclusion.

==History==
The idea for ''Big Brother'' is said to have come during a brainstorming session at the Dutch-based international [[Italy|Italian]] television production firm [[Endemol]] on March 10, 1997. The first version of ''Big Brother'' was broadcast in 1999 on [[Veronica (TV channel)|Veronica]] in the [[Big Brother (Netherlands)|Netherlands]]. Since then the format has become a worldwide TV franchise, airing in many countries in a number of versions.

Although each country has made its own adaptations of the format, the contestants are confined to a specially-designed house where their every action is recorded by cameras and microphones and they are not permitted contact with the outside world. In most countries that have produced ''Big Brother'', the contestants have been known as "housemates"; however in the American and Canadian version they are referred to as "houseguests". The term ''Big Brother'' originates from [[George Orwell]]'s novel, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. Besides living together under continuous observation (which is the chief attraction of the contest), the program relies on four basic props: the stripped-bare back-to-basics environment in which they live, the evictions, the weekly tasks and competitions set by ''Big Brother'' and the "Diary/Confession Room" (in which the housemates convey their thoughts, feelings, and frustrations, and reveal their nominees for eviction). Contestants are required to evict one of their own on a regular basis; in the earlier series of ''Big Brother'', contestants were evicted every two weeks. However, the UK version introduced weekly evictions; all versions of ''Big Brother'' now follow this format.

At regular intervals, the housemates privately nominate a number of fellow housemates whom they wish evicted from the house. The housemates with the most nominations are then announced, and viewers are given the opportunity to [[televoting|vote via telephone]] for whom they wish to see evicted. The exceptions to this process are in the American and Canadian versions, in which the housemates vote to evict each other. After the votes are tallied, the "evictee" leaves the house and is interviewed by the host of the show (usually in the presence of a studio audience). In some cases, two housemates may be evicted simultaneously (a "double eviction"); rarely, no housemates will be removed that week. At the end of the game, the last remaining housemate is declared the winner for the particular series and receives prizes (often including a large amount of money, a car, a vacation and—in some editions—a house).

In the first season of most series of ''Big Brother'', the house was very basic. Although essential amenities such as running water, furniture and a limited ration of food were provided, luxury items were often forbidden. This added a [[survivalist]] element to the show, increasing the potential for social tension. Nearly all later series provide a modern house for the contest with a jacuzzi, sauna, VIP suite, loft and other luxuries.

The contestants are required to do housework, and are assigned tasks by the producers of the show (who communicate with the housemates via the omnipresent authority figure known to them only as "Big Brother"). The tasks are designed to test their teamwork abilities and community spirit; in some countries, the housemates' shopping budget or weekly allowance depends on the outcome of assigned tasks. The housemates have a weekly allowance, with which they can buy food and other essentials.

Most international versions of the show remain quite similar to each other; their main format remains true to the original [[fly on the wall]] observational style with the emphasis on human relationships, to the extent that contestants are forbidden from discussing nominations or voting strategy. Since 2001 the [[United States|US]] version adopted a different format from the others during its second season, with an emphasis on strategy, competition and voting (the public does not choose who to evict). In 2011, the [[United Kingdom|UK]] version controversially adapted the discussion of nominations before reverting this rule back after a poll by ''Big Brother'' broadcaster [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], which showed that 90 percent of voters believed that housemates should not discuss nominations.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Overview===
From a sociological and demographic perspective, ''Big Brother'' allows an analysis of how people react when forced into close confinement with people outside their [[comfort zone]] (with different opinions or ideals, or from a different socioeconomic group). The viewer has the opportunity to see how a person reacts from the outside (through the constant recording of their actions) and the inside (in the Diary or Confession Room). The Diary Room (known as the DR) is where contestants can privately express their feelings about the game, strategy and the other contestants. The results range from violent or angry confrontations to genuine and tender connections (often including romantic interludes).

The show is notable for involving the [[Internet]].{{According to whom|date=March 2013}} Although the show typically broadcasts daily updates during the evening (sometimes criticized for their heavy editing), viewers can also watch a continuous feed from multiple cameras on the Web. These websites were successful, even after some national series began charging for access to the video stream. In some countries, Internet broadcasting was supplemented by updates via email, [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] and [[Text messaging|SMS]]. The house is shown live on [[satellite television]], although in some countries there is a 10–15 minute delay to allow libelous or unacceptable content (such as references to people not participating in the program who have not consented to have personal information broadcast) to be removed.

Contestants occasionally develop sexual relationships; the level of sexual explicitness allowed to be shown in broadcast and Internet-feed versions varies by country.

==={{anchor|Isolation of contestants}}Isolation===
''Big Brother'' contestants are isolated in the house, without access to television, radio or the Internet; they are not permitted routine communication with the outside world. This was an important issue for most earlier series of the show. In more-recent series, contestants are occasionally allowed to view televised events (usually as a reward for winning at a task). In most versions of the program books and writing materials are also forbidden, although exceptions are sometimes made for religious materials such as the [[Bible]], [[Torah]] or the [[Qur'an]]. Some versions ban all writing implements, even items that can be used to write (such as lipstick or eyeliner). Despite the housemates' isolation, some contestants are occasionally allowed to leave the house as part of tasks. Contestants are permitted to leave the house in an emergency.

Contestants have regularly-scheduled interactions with the show's host on eviction nights. Throughout each day the program's producer, in the "Big Brother" voice, issues directives and commands to contestants. Some versions of the show allow private counseling sessions with a psychologist. These are allowed at any time, and are often conducted by telephone from the Diary Room.

==={{anchor|Pan-regional versions}}Regional versions===
Due to the intelligibility of certain languages across several nations, it has been possible to make regional versions of ''Big Brother''. All these follow the normal ''Big Brother'' rules, except that contestants must come from each of the countries in the region where it airs:
* [[Big Brother Africa|Africa]]: [[Angola]], [[Botswana]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Liberia]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Namibia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[South Africa]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].
*[[Big Brother: The Boss|Arabia]]: [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Oman]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Somalia]], [[Syria]] and [[Tunisia]]
*[[Gran Hermano (Pacific)|Pacific]]: [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]
* [[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)|Scandinavia]]: [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]
* [[Veliki brat 2011|Former Yugoslavia]]: [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]]

[[Image:Big brother countries.PNG|thumb|alt=World map, with different shading for "Big Brother" versions|Locations of ''Big Brother'' versions]]
In the [[Big Brother 3 (UK)|third UK series]], Big Brother set live tasks for the housemates on a Saturday night to win treats; this was used until series 5 of the program. The format was used in [[Big Brother Australia|Australia]] as [[Friday Night Live, Big Brother Australia|Friday Night Live]] from series 5 to series 8. The [[Big Brother 5 (UK)|fifth UK edition]] introduced an "evil" touch; Big Brother became villainous with punishments, difficult tasks and secret tricks. This was also seen in [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Pacific]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]] and [[Mexico]]. The [[Big Brother 6 (UK)|sixth UK series]] introduced secret missions, where housemates could win luxuries if they completed a secret task set by Big Brother. The [[Big Brother 8 (UK)|eighth UK series]] saw an all-female house. However, two days later one male housemate arrived. The same twist was used in ''[[Big Brother 4 (Bulgaria)|Big Brother 4 Bulgaria]]''. ''[[Big Brother Africa 4]]'' used a similar twist, with an all-male premiere.

Since ''[[Big Brother 2 (UK)|Big Brother 2]]'', the [[Big Brother (UK)|UK series]] opens with a twist. This has included the public choosing the final housemate from three possibilities (''Big Brother 2''); public voting for a housemate to leave during the first week and the housemates choosing between two housemates with the least number of votes (''Big Brother 3''); first-night nominations (''[[Big Brother 4 (UK)|Big Brother 4]]''); suitcase nominations (''Big Brother 5''); Unlucky Housemate 13 (''Big Brother 6''); Big Brother Hood (''[[Big Brother 7 (UK)|Big Brother 7]]''); an all-female house and a set of twins as contestants (''[[Big Brother 2007 (UK)|Big Brother 8]]''); a couple entering as housemates, who must hide their relationship (''[[Big Brother 9 (UK)|Big Brother 9]]''); housemates having to earn housemate status (''[[Big Brother 10 (UK)|Big Brother 10]]''); a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] entering the house with an impossible task (''[[Big Brother 11 (UK)|Big Brother 11]]''); [[Jackie Stallone]] entering a house containing her son's ex-wife (''[[Celebrity Big Brother 3 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 3]]''); a non-celebrity in a celebrity edition (''[[Celebrity Big Brother 4 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 4]]'') and a visit from [[Jade Goody]]'s family (''[[Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 5]]''). During ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 6 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 6]]'' [[LaToya Jackson]] entered first, walked straight into a private bedroom (the bedrooms are usually locked until everyone has arrived) and put her bag on the bed to claim it as her own.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tom Bryant |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/01/05/celebrity-big-brother-exclusive-la-toya-jackson-s-diva-demands-115875-21016252/ |title=Celebrity Big Brother exclusive: La Toya Jackson's diva demands - 3am & Mirror Online |publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date=2009-01-05 |accessdate=2013-07-15}}</ref> [[Terry Christian]] became head of the house which was used at the end of the previous non-celebrity series and had to nominate three housemates for the first eviction; the others voted to save one of the nominees, [[Ben Adams]], leaving [[Lucy Pinder]] and eventual winner [[Ulrika Jonsson]] to face the first eviction. In the summer series of 2009 the house was empty at first, with only crates to sit on. The new arrivals had to earn housemate status by completing tasks; Noirin Kelly was required to shave off her hair and draw a [[mustache]] and glasses on her face. Freddie Fisher and eventual winner Sophie Reade had to change their names by [[deed poll]] to Halfwit and Dogface. On day four, the six people who had not received housemate status were nominated for a public vote. The person with the fewest votes (Beinazir Lasharie) left, and the house was transformed into a "Big Brother" house. Other countries, such as Bulgaria, the United States and (previously) Australia, have also begun using opening-night twists.

The fifth UK edition introduced fake evictions, where one or two housemates are "evicted". In the eighth UK Series one housemate was evicted, interviewed and sent back into the house. In [[France]] and [[Canada]], the format uses couples; twelve single people stay in the house, until only the winning couple is left. [[Big Brother (U.S.)|''Big Brother'' U.S.]] uses a different set of rules which began for the second season. Nominations are made by one houseguest, the [[Big Brother (U.S.)#Head of Household (HoH)|Head of Household (HoH)]], and the houseguests vote for which nominee to evict (not the viewers). The third season introduced the Power of Veto, where a houseguest can veto a nominee on the block for eviction. This has been adapted in [[Brazil]] and Africa, and other countries have modified their nomination rules. The [[Big Brother 8 (U.S.)|eighth American season]] introduced "America's Player", a houseguest given assignments by votes from viewers. Included in the public voting is which houseguest that America's Player should vote off and campaign to be evicted.

The [[Big Brother (Netherlands)#Season 3|third Dutch edition]] introduced "the battle", in which the house is separated into a luxurious half and a poor half and two teams of housemates fight for time in the luxurious half. Separated houses have also been used in:
* [[Big Brother (Netherlands)#Season 3|Netherlands, 2001]] and [[Big Brother (Netherlands)#Season 4|Netherlands, 2002]]: Rich and poor

In Germany, a new sixth-season version of the show was ''Big Brother - Das Dorf'' (''Big Brother - The Village''). The season ended after 363 days in February 2006 because of low ratings. For season seven, RTL II switched back to a traditional version. The fourth Greek season introduced a mother. During the tenth week of the seventh UK season, the housemates were paired with their "best friend" in the house and had to nominate and face eviction as couples. The [[Big Brother 9 (U.S.)|ninth American season]] added a romantic aspect by pairing up the housemates up and having them compete as couples.

The [[Big Brother Brasil 9|ninth Brazilian season]] featured the "Bubble": a glass house in a [[shopping mall]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] where four potential housemates lived for a week. Later in the season a bubble was built inside the Big Brother house, with another two housemates living in it for a week until they were voted in and the glass house dismantled.

Introduced in the [[Big Brother 5 (U.S.)|fifth season]] of the American series, several countries have included twins (or triplets) in their shows:
*[[Big Brother 5 (U.S.)|U.S., 2004]]: [[Adria Montgomery-Klein and Natalie Montgomery-Carroll]]
*[[Big Brother Australia 2005|Australia, 2005]]: David and [[Greg Mathew|Greg Matthew]]

A variation of the above twist occurred in the [[Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Edition 2|second celebrity edition]] of the Philippine version, where two housemates related by profession or family played as onee. In ''[[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack|Celebrity Hijack UK]]'' evicted housemates were given the opportunity to choose if a "ninja" delivered good or bad gifts to the house. Later that year [[Big Brother Australia 2008]] introduced the Housemate Hand Grenade, where an evicted housemate decided which housemate received a penalty. [[Big Brother 5 (Bulgaria)|Big Brother 5 Bulgaria]], which began in early 2010, introduced a new family format (Big Brother Family). Whole families entered the house with their spouses, children and relatives. They received a salary for their stay and the winning family received a cash prize, a car and an apartment. [[Big Brother 11 (U.S.)|The eleventh American season]] featured Pandora's Box, in which the winning head of household was tempted (with money, a celebrity visit or time alone with a loved one) to open a box. If an HoH chooses to open Pandora's Box, however, there may be unintended consequences.

[[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|The twelfth American season]] featured a saboteur, who entered the house to wreak havoc with tasks suggested by viewers. [[Big Brother Africa 6]] in 2011 was the first season of Big Brother to have two winners, each getting $200,000. [[Big Brother 13 (U.S.)|The thirteenth American season]] introduced Dynamic Duos, where eight new houseguests would enter the house with three duos from past seasons. The [[Pinoy Big Brother: Unlimited|fourth Philippine season]] features ''Unli-Day'' and ''Unli-Night'', where two separate groups of housemates were covered in two separate programs. It also introduced reserved housemates, shortlisted auditioners who were given a chance to be a housemate by completing tasks assigned by Big Brother (this was also done in Argentina's [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 7)|seventh season]]). The [[Pinoy Big Brother|Philippine version]] introduced the 100-second session, in which housemates are given a chance to be with their loved ones for only 100 seconds in the Confession Room.<ref>Big Brother is giving one housemate a special treat! A housemate will reunite with a loved one inside the confession room! And this special moment will be aired live on Pinoy Big Brother tonight!http://bb1.pinoybigbrother.com/Default.aspx?tabid=52&articleType=ArticleView&articleId=184.</ref> [[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)|The fourteenth American season]] had four houseguests from past seasons returning to the house to coach twelve new houseguests. The four returning houseguests played their own game for a separate prize of $100,000 until they joined the normal game later after a reset twist. [[Big Brother 15 (U.S.)|The fifteenth American season]] Introduced the Big Brother M.V.P twist where every week, the viewers would vote one of the houseguests who the viewers thought was playing the best game, also introduced three nominations in the US version where the HOH would nominate the first two houseguests for eviction (like in previous seasons) while the 3rd nomination is made by the M.V.P of that week in a further twist for the M.V.P, the viewers decided who the 3rd nominee would be for the week, half way into the season the M.V.P twist ended and the show continued on with just 2 nominees a week as in previous seasons.

The ''Big Brother'' format has been adapted in some countries; the housemates are local celebrities, and the shows are called ''Celebrity Big Brother'' or ''Big Brother VIP''. In some countries, the prize money normally awarded to the winning housemate is donated to a charity, and all celebrities are paid to appear in the show as long as they do not voluntarily leave before their eviction or the end of the series. The rest of the rules are nearly the same as those of the original version. The celebrity version has become particularly popular in the UK, with two series broadcast in 2012 and 2013 (the first in January and the second after the main series in summer 2012 and 2013).

===={{anchor|Variants in the ''Celebrity Big Brother'' /''Big Brother VIP Format''}}Variations====
The 2006 Netherlands series was entitled ''Hotel Big Brother''. This variation introduced a group of celebrity hoteliers and a Big Boss, who run a hotel and collect money for charity without nominations, evictions or a winner.

Another variation appeared in the UK in early 2008, entitled ''Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack''. This temporarily replaced the 2007 ''Celebrity Big Brother'' in the wake of a racial-abuse incident. Instead of celebrities playing housemates the celebrities became Big Brother himself, creating tasks and holding nominations with the help of Big Brother. The housemates were considered by the producers "Britain's most exceptional and extraordinary" 18- to 21-year-olds. The prize for the winner of the series was £50,000.<ref name="celebhijack">[http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bb8/news/newsstory.jsp?id=24561 BREAKING BB NEWS] ''Channel 4 - Official Big Brother UK Website'' Retrieved 2007-09-08</ref>

In 2009 ''[[VIP Brother 3 (Bulgaria)|VIP Brother 3 Bulgaria]]'' introduced the concept of celebrities competing for charitable causes, sometimes allowed to leave the house to raise money for the charity (which changed each week).

* ''[[Secret Story: Desafio Final (Portugal)]]'' ([[Portugal]], 22 days): An all-star edition with the housemates of season 2 and 3 of [[Secret Story (Portugal)]]

There are also "test runs", with a group of celebrities (or journalists) living in the house for several days to test it. There are occasions where people who have auditioned for the show are also put in the house, most notably in the British edition, where many housemates claim to have met before. These series have been televised in [[Argentina]], Bulgaria, [[Czech Republic]], Germany, Mexico, the Pacific, the Philippines and Spain. In some cases, it is not broadcast, but in others, such as the U.S. edition, it is used as a promotional tool.

=={{anchor|''Big Brother'' series}}The series==
There are currently 310 winners of the show; the most recent winner is [[Stanka Zlateva]] from [[Bulgaria]].
