{{Politics of the People's Republic of China}}
The '''Communist Party of China''' ('''CPC'''), also known as the '''Chinese Communist Party''' ('''CCP'''), is the founding and [[Ruling party|ruling]] political party of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC). Although nominally it exists alongside the [[United Front (People's Republic of China)|United Front]],<ref>[http://mcx.sagepub.com/cgi/rapidpdf/0097700409347982v1.pdf 'New Approaches to the Study of Political Order in China'], Donald Clarke, ''Modern China'', 2009</ref> a coalition of governing political parties, in practice, the CPC is the [[single-party state|only party]] in the PRC,<ref name="Cdecon">{{Cite book | last = Goodman | first = David S.

Since becoming an institution of the state, aside from official commitment to communism and [[Marxism-Leninism]], the party also has ''de facto'' unrecognized factions including [[Consumerism|consumerist]] and [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] figures including business people on the right who effectively support capitalism (although they have been subject to purges and repression in the [[Cultural Revolution]] and later, after the [[1989 Tiananmen Square Protests]]), as well as factions on the left that oppose the right in the party, and other factions.<ref>Politics in China: An Introduction.

Both before and after the founding of the PRC, the CPC's history is defined by various power struggles and ideological battles, including destructive socio-political movements such as the [[Cultural Revolution]]. At first a conventional member of the international Communist movement, the CPC [[Sino-Soviet Split|broke with its counterpart in the Soviet Union]] over ideological differences in the 1960s. The Communist Party's ideology was redefined under [[Deng Xiaoping]] to incorporate principles of [[market economics]], and the [[socialist market economy|corresponding reforms]] enabled rapid and sustained economic [[Economy of China|growth]].<ref>{{cite web|title=EPP|url=http://www.enrichprofessional.com/home/|accessdate=April 18, 2012}}</ref>

The modern party stresses unity and avoids public conflict while practicing a [[democratic centralism]] within the party structure.

==Organization==
The party's organizational structure was destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]] and rebuilt afterwards by [[Deng Xiaoping]], who subsequently initiated "[[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]]" and brought all state apparatuses back under the rule of the CPC.

Theoretically, the party's highest body is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China]], which meets at least once every five years. The primary organs of power in the Communist Party which is detailed in the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|party constitution]] include:
* [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], which includes:
** The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], which is the highest-ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese ''de facto'' [[paramount leader]].
** The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], presently consisting of 25 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee); see [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China#Current Members|current members of the Politburo]] for a complete list.
** The [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], which currently consists of seven members; see [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China#Current members|current members of the Politburo Standing Committee]] for a complete list.
** The [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretariat]], the principal administrative mechanism of the CPC, headed by the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Central Committee]];
** The [[Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China|Central Military Commission]] (a parallel organization of the government institution of the same name);
* The [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China|Central Discipline Inspection Commission]], which is directly under the National Congress and on the same level with the Central Committee, charged with rooting out corruption and malfeasance among party cadres.

===Organizations under the Central Committee===
Other central organizations directly under the Party Central Committee include:
* [[General Office of the Communist Party of China|General Office]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/2006/Mar/161216.htm |title=Images of GO CPC in Session |publisher=China.org.cn |date=2006-03-12 |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref>
* [[Organization Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|Central Organization Department]];
* [[Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|Central Propaganda Department]];
* [[International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|Central International Liaison Department]];
* Central [[United Front Work Department]];
* [[Policy Research Office of the Communist Party of China|Central Policy Research Office]];
* [[Taiwan Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|Central Taiwan Work Office]];
* [[External Publicity Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|Central External Publicity Office]];
* [[Central Security Office of the Communist Party of China|Central Security Office]];
* [[Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Party School]];
* ''[[People's Daily]]'';
* ''[[Seeking Truth From Facts]]'';
* Party History Research Centre;
* Party Research Centre;
* Central Compilation and Translation Bureau.

In addition, there are numerous commissions and leading groups. Usually those commissions and leading groups have jurisdiction on both Party and State apparatus, and include ranking leaders up to the [[President of the People's Republic of China]] and the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier of the State Council]]. The most important of them are:
* [[Political and Legislative Affairs Committee of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|Central Political and Legislative Affairs Commission]];
* [[Central Guidance Commission for Building Spiritual Civilization of the Communist Party of China|Central Guidance Commission for Building Spiritual Civilization]];
* [[Central Commission for Comprehensive Management of Social Order of the Communist Party of China|Central Commission for Comprehensive Management of Social Order]];
* [[State Commission for Public Sector Reform]];
* [[Central Leading Group for Financial Work]];
* [[Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs|Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs]];
* [[Central Leading Group for Taiwan Affairs]];
* [[Central Leading Group for Foreign Affairs]];
* [[Central National Security Leading Group]];
* [[Central Leading Group for Rural Work]];
* [[Central Leading Group for Party Building]];
* [[Central Leading Group for Propaganda and Ideological Work]];
* [[Central Leading Group for Combating Pornography and Illegal Publications]];
* [[6-10 Office|Central Leading Group for Preventing and Handling the Problem of Heretical Organizations]] (related to [[Falun Gong]]);
* [[Central Leading Group for Preserving Stability]];
* [[Central Leading Group for Cultural System Reform]];
* [[Central Leading Group for Hong Kong and Macao Affairs]];
* [[Central Leading Group for Combating Bribery]];
* [[Central Leading Group for Protection of Party Secrets]];
* [[Central Leading Group for Advancing Grass-roots Party Organization and Training Party Members]];
* [[Central Leading Group for Tibet Work]];
* [[Central Leading Group for Xinjiang Work]];
* [[Central Anti-Corruption Guidance Group]].

Every five years, the Communist Party of China holds a National Congress. The latest happened on October 19, 2007. Formally, the Congress serves two functions: to approve changes to the Party constitution regarding policy and to elect a [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], about 300 strong. The Central Committee in turn elects the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]]. In practice, positions within the Central Committee and Politburo are determined before a Party Congress, and the main purpose of the Congress is to announce the party policies and vision for the direction of China in the following few years.

The party's central focus of power is the Politburo Standing Committee. The process for selecting Standing Committee members, as well as Politburo members, occurs behind the scenes in a process parallel to the National Congress. The new power structure is announced obliquely through the positioning of portraits in the ''[[People's Daily]]'', the official newspaper of the Party. The number of Standing Committee members varies and has tended to increase over time. The Committee was expanded to nine at the 16th Party National Congress in 2009, before being reduced to 7 members at the Congress of 2012.

There are two other key organs of political power in the People's Republic of China: the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|formal government]] and the [[People's Liberation Army]]. The Party's main bodies to oversee the PLA are the [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|Central Military Commission]] and the [[People's Liberation Army General Political Department|General Political Department]].

There are, in addition to decision-making roles, advisory committees, including the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]]. During the 1980s and 1990s there was a [[Central Advisory Commission]] established by [[Deng Xiaoping]] which consisted of senior retired leaders, but with their death this has been abolished since 1992.

===Factions===
Political theorists have identified two groups within the Communist Party,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicagosociety.uchicago.edu/china/coverage/PoliticsPanel.pdf |title=Uchicago.edu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref> a structure which has been called "one party, two [[Political faction|factions]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chinavitae.com/reference/conferencepapers/Li_Cheng.pdf |title=Chinavitae.com |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref> The first is the "elitist coalition" or ''[[Shanghai clique]]'' which is composed mainly of officials who have risen from the more prosperous provinces. The second is the "populist coalition", the core of which are the ''[[tuanpai]]'', or the "Youth League faction" which consists mainly of officials who have risen from the rural interior, through the [[Communist Youth League]]. Minor informal groupings include the reformist [[Qinghua clique]], and the derogatorily termed [[Crown Prince Party]] of officials benefiting from [[nepotism]]. The interaction between the two main factions is largely complementary with each faction possessing a particular expertise and both committed to the continued rule of the Communist Party and not allowing intra-party factional politics to threaten party unity. It has been noted that party and government positions have been assigned to create a very careful balance between these two groupings.

Within his "one party, two factions" model, Li Cheng has noted that one should avoid labelling these two groupings with simplistic ideological labels, and that these two groupings do not act in a zero-sum, winner take all fashion. Neither group has the ability or will to dominate the other completely.<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/news_details.php?news_id=210 The Jamestown Foundation]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref>

===Membership===
The party was small at first, but grew intermittently through the 1920s. Twelve voting delegates were seated at the 1st [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|National Congress]] in 1921, as well as at the 2nd (in 1922), when they represented 195 party members. By 1923, the 420 members were represented by 30 delegates. The 1925 4th Congress had 20 delegates representing 994 members; then real growth kicked in. The 5th Congress (held in April–May 1927 as the [[KMT]] was cracking down on communists) comprised 80 voting delegates representing 57,968 members.

It was on October 3, 1928 6th Congress that the now-familiar ‘full’ and ‘alternate’ structure originated, with 84 and 34 delegates, respectively. Membership was estimated at 40,000. In 1945, the 7th Congress had 547 full and 208 alternate delegates representing 1.21&nbsp;million members, a ratio of one representative per 1,600 members as compared to 1:725 in 1927.

After the Party defeated the Nationalists, participation at National Party Congresses became much less representative. Each of the 1026 full and 107 alternate members represented 9,470 party members (10.73&nbsp;million in total) at the 1956 8th Congress. Subsequent congresses held the number of participants down despite membership growing to more than 60&nbsp;million by 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.cpcnews.cn/92277/6277861.html |title=Press centre of the 17th CPC National Congress |publisher=English.cpcnews.cn |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref>

===Discipline===
Investigations and prosecutions of cadre who are suspect of corruption are conducted confidentially in a system run the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] which is separate from ordinary Chinese law enforcement and courts which are subject to influence by local cadre. According to ''The New York Times'' the system is called "shuanggui" and is greatly feared by corrupt party functionaries. According to ''The New York Times'' suspects are subjected to severe physical and psychological pressure. The system has resulted in successful investigation and prosecution of a number of corrupt cadre including some very powerful party officials. There is little sympathy by the Chinese public for corrupt officials who get caught up in the system, but also skepticism regarding its effectiveness.<ref name=shuanggui>{{cite news|title=Accused Chinese Party Members Face Harsh Discipline|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/world/asia/accused-chinese-party-members-face-harsh-discipline.html|accessdate=June 15, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 14, 2012|author=Andrew Jacobs}}</ref>

[[Museum of the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party]].]]
The CPC has its origins in the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919, where radical political systems like [[Anarchism in China|anarchism]] and communism gained traction among Chinese intellectuals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution|first=Arif|last=Dirlik|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1993|page=16}}</ref> Stalin opposed the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang because he wanted to expand Soviet influence in the province.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=warlords+and+muslims#v=snippet&q=fascist%20trotskyite%20plotters&f=false|title=Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911–1949|author=Andrew D. W. Forbes|year=1986|publisher=CUP Archive|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-25514-7|pages=151, 376|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}</ref> The CPC's ideologies have significantly evolved since its founding and establishing political power in 1949. [[Mao Zedong]]'s revolution that founded the PRC was nominally based on [[Marxism-Leninism]] with a rural focus based on China's social situations at the time. During the 1960s and 1970s, the CPC experienced a significant [[Sino-Soviet split|ideological breakdown]] with the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], and later, [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. Since then Mao's peasant revolutionary vision and so-called "continued revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat" stipulated that class enemies continued to exist even though the socialist revolution seemed to be complete, giving way to the ''[[Cultural Revolution]]''. This fusion of ideas became known officially as "[[Maoism|Mao Zedong Thought]]", or Maoism outside of China. It represented a powerful branch of communism that existed in opposition to the Soviet Union's "[[Marxist revisionism]]".

Following the death of Mao in 1976, however, the CPC under the leadership of [[Deng Xiaoping]] moved towards ''[[Socialist market economy|Socialism with Chinese characteristics]]'' and instituted [[Chinese economic reform]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NewChina|url=http://www.enrichprofessional.com/home/|accessdate=April 18, 2012}}</ref>  In reversing some of Mao's "extreme-leftist" policies, Deng argued that a socialist country and the [[market economy]] model were not mutually exclusive. While asserting the political power of the Party itself, the change in policy generated significant economic growth.<ref>{{cite book|title=ReformingChina|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LuLYSAAACAAJ&dq=Enrich+Series+on+China%27s+Economic+Reform&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nDaPT-7aDMioiQKv8-X7Ag&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ|accessdate=April 18, 2012}}</ref>  The ideology itself, however, came into conflict on both sides of the spectrum with Maoists as well as progressive liberals, culminating with other social factors to cause the [[1989 Tiananmen Square Protests]]. Deng's vision for economic success and a new socialist market model became entrenched in the Party constitution in 1997 as ''[[Deng Xiaoping Theory]]''.
[[File:Stalin birthday2.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Chinese communists celebrate Stalin's 70th birthday, 1949]]
The "third generation" of leadership under [[Jiang Zemin]], [[Zhu Rongji]], and associates largely continued Deng's progressive economic vision while overseeing the re-emergence of [[Chinese nationalism]] in the 1990s. Nationalist sentiment has seemingly also evolved to become informally the part of the Party's guiding doctrine. As part of Jiang's nominal legacy, the CPC ratified the ''[[Three Represents]]'' into the 2003 revision of the Party Constitution as a "guiding ideology", encouraging the Party to represent "advanced productive forces, the progressive course of China's culture, and the fundamental interests of the people." There are various interpretations of the ''Three Represents''. Most notably, the theory has legitimized the entry of private business owners and quasi-"bourgeois" elements into the party.

The insistent road of focusing almost exclusively on economic growth has led to a [[Social issues in the People's Republic of China|wide range of serious social problems]]. The CPC's "fourth generation" of leadership under [[Hu Jintao]] and [[Wen Jiabao]], after taking power in 2003, attempted reversing such a trend by bringing forth an integrated ideology that tackled both social and economic concerns. This new ideology was known as the creation of a [[socialist harmonious society]] using the [[Scientific Development Concept]].

The degree of power the Party had on the state has gradually decreased as economic liberalizations progressed. The evolution of CPC ideology has gone through a number of defining changes that it no longer bears much resemblance to its founding principles. Some believe that the large amount of economic liberalization starting from the late 1970s to present, indicates that the CPC has transitioned to endorse economic neoliberalism.<ref>Harvey, David. 2005.

The Communist Party of China comprises a [[single-party state]] form of government; however, there are parties other than the CPC within China, which report to the [[United Front (China)|United Front Department of the Communist Party of China]] and do not act as opposition or independent parties. The continued dominance of the CPC, as with the parties of the last communist states (all in Asia and Latin America), can be attributed in part to its anti-colonial and "national liberation" credentials, burnished by its participation in events such as the [[Anti-Japanese War]] and the [[Korean War]]. According to historian of Communism [[Archie Brown]], the memory of the Cultural Revolution, where a form of mass political mobilization turned against the Party and resulted in chaotic destruction, may account for the reticence of educated Chinese to press for an end to one-party rule.<ref name="Brown"/>

==Political ideology and stances==

===Regional corruption and reform===
The leading officials of the PRC have realised and acknowledged that there are severe issues related to political corruption within [[Mainland China]]. They've also realised that this jeopardises to an extent their targets of maintaining the trust of the Chinese people. However, attempts made in closed-door sessions at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 17th Communist Party of China's Central Committee in September 2009 to grapple with these problems produced inconclusive results, although a directive which requires disclosure of investments and property holdings by party and governmental officials was passed.<ref>Wines, Michael (September 20, 2009). [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/21/world/asia/21china.html "Party’s Agenda in China Seems to Fall Flat"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>

===Relationship with competing ideologies===
[[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] perspectives allegedly perceive the party as having been doomed to its present character - that of, what this point of view has labelled as 'petty-bourgeois nationalism - in the 1920s, because of the near-annihilation of the workers' movement in the KMT betrayal of 1927.  [[Joseph Stalin]]'s order then that the Communists join with the KMT in a centrist coalition effectively disarmed the Communist Party, which opportunity the KMT swiftly exploited to defeat the communist revolution.<ref>

[[Marxist]] perspectives from within the [[Kuomintang]] throughout history have shown a tendency to recount the Chinese revolution in different terms than the Communists of the CPC, with its adhereants controversially claiming that China already went past its feudal stage and had reached a period of stagnation rather than another mode of production. These Marxists in the Kuomintang thus opposed the CPC's ideology.<ref>

Some{{which|date=January 2013}} [[Maoism|Maoist]] and other so-called "[[anti-revisionist]]" perspectives are often able to criticise [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|the changes]] made after Chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, claiming them to be them the exact "capitalist road" that Chairman Mao had pledged to fight during the early years of the PRC. An adherent of such a perspective, thus, would not necessarily sympathise or empathise with the CPC. The [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] is an example of a well-known group, until recently [[armed struggle|armed]], that adheres to Mao's ideologies, whom the CPC, as the [[People's democratic dictatorship|''de jure'' ruling power of the PRC]], has officially denounced. Also, some Maoist groups even attack some of the shifts and changes that occurred when Mao Tse-Tung was still alive and in power, such as his 1972 welcoming of US president [[Richard Nixon]]. The [[Chinese New Left]], which encompasses these Maoists and other [[postmodernists]] is a current within China that seeks to "revert China to the socialist road" – i.e., to return China to the socialist system that existed before Deng Xiaoping's reforms of the 1980s, that favoured more allegedly 'capitallist'-type policies as opposed to Mao's original principle of ''Mao Tse-Tung Thought (or [[Maoism]])''.

Some perspectives of the Party that favour the [[Chinese democracy movement]] would prefer not to regard a strong [[authoritarian]] government of mainland China as inevitably bad, but rather to publicise and focus upon the corruption of the Communist leadership and how to resolve it, as opposed to emphasising upon the negatives of [[People's democratic dictatorship|CPC dictatorship]] and alternatives that would increase freedom in the PRC, although these perspectives are not documented as well as others and aren't as well known. The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] represented a controversial point in criticism of the Chinese Communist Party by Chinese students within China.<ref>

Other perspectives often hold that that the worst of the abuses took place decades ago, and that the current leaders not only had no connection with them, but were actually victims of that era. People adhering to such minority perspectives would plausibly claim, while the modern Communist Party may be flawed, it is comparatively better than previous regimes, with respect to improving the general standard of living, than any other government that has governed China (except, perhaps the [[Republic of China]] government in Taiwan, a [[Asian Tiger|major economic centre in Asia]]) in the past century and emerges in a more favourable light compared with most governments of the [[developing nation]]s. As a result, the CPC has recently{{when|date=November 2012}} taken sweeping measures to regain support from the countryside, with limited success.

In addition, some scholarly opinions{{which|date=November 2012}} contend that China has never operated under a liberalised democratic regime in its several thousand years of history, and therefore the present political structure, albeit not up to Western moral or political standards, may possibly represent the best possible option when compared to the alternatives. A sudden transition to democracy, as per some plausible perspectives, would result in the sort of economic and political upheaval that occurred in the [[Soviet Union]] in the late 1980s, and that by focusing on economic growth, China has started setting the stage for a more gradual but sustainable transition to a more democratic and liberal system of politics. This group sees mainland China as resembling [[Francoist Spain|Franco's Spain]] in the 1960s, or [[South Korea]] during the 1970s when corrupt, authoritarian regimes ran that country. This perspective also, as per some perspectives {{which|date=December 2012}}, brings together some unlikely political allies.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Not only do some intellectual perspectives within the PRC authorities, as per some opinions, claim that this could be the case, but it is also plausibly a thought occurring amongst pro-[[free trade]] perspectives in the West.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Observers of some perspectives{{which|date=November 2012}} - both from within and outside of China - may argue that the CPC has, though not all perspectives would agree, taken gradual steps towards [[democracy]] and [[Transparency in government|transparency]], and hence may advocate giving it time and room to evolve into a better government -  more responsive to its people - rather than forcing an abrupt change which could in theory effect a major loss of stability.<ref>

However, other observers (like [[Minxin Pei]]) question whether these steps are genuine efforts towards democratic reform or disingenuous measures by the CPC to retain power.<ref>

===Religion===
{{see also|Freedom of religion in the People's Republic of China}}
The CPC, as an officially [[Atheism|atheist]] institution, prohibits party members from holding religious beliefs. Although religion is banned for members of the state, personal beliefs are not held accountable.

The Party's [[United Front Work Department]] coordinates with the [[State Administration for Religious Affairs]] to manage the country's five officially sanctioned religions. Unregistered religious groups face varying degrees of suppression under the Communist Party.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Funding==
The CPC charges a limited due on its members, receives donations, and operates some businesses, from which it derives money. But the majority of the Party's budget is supposed to come from a grant by the national treasury,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaelections.org/newsinfo.asp?newsid=107807|title=建立规范的党务经费制度 |accessdate=October 24, 2011 |author=孙国良|publisher=中国选举与治理 |language=Chinese}}</ref> the same way that the other 8 subordinate parties are supposed to be funded. There is no official and public process for the grants to the Party, however.

==Internet presence==
As of 2010, the party has no standalone website.<ref name=McGregor20>McGregor, p.
