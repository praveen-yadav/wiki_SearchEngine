==History==
The cheese originates from the village of [[Cheddar]] in [[Somerset]], South West England. [[Cheddar Gorge]] on the edge of the village contains a number of [[cave]]s, which provided the ideal humidity and constant temperature for maturing the cheese.<ref name=indy/> Cheddar cheese traditionally had to be made within {{convert|30|mi|km}} of [[Wells Cathedral]].<ref name=curdswhey/>

Cheddar has been produced since at least the 12th century. A [[pipe rolls|pipe roll]] of [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] from 1170 records the purchase of {{convert|10240|lb|abbr=on}} at a [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]] per pound (totaling £10.13s.4d., about £10.67 in [[Decimal Day|decimal currency]]).<ref>{{Cite web| title=History| work=Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company | url=http://www.cheddargorgecheeseco.co.uk/acatalog/about-cheddar-gorge.html | accessdate=1 August 2009}}</ref>  
[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (1600–1649) also bought cheese from the village.<ref name=indy/>
[[Ancient Rome|Romans]] may have brought the recipe to Britain from the [[Cantal]] region of France.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Barthélemy| first1 = Roland| last2 = Sperat-Czar| first2 = Arnaud| title = Guide du fromage: Choisir, reconnaître, goûter 1200 fromages du monde| year = 2003| isbn = 978-2-01-236867-5| page = 89 }}</ref>

Central to the modernisation and standardisation of cheddar cheese was the nineteenth century [[Somerset]] dairyman [[Joseph Harding]].<ref name="History">{{Cite web| title=History of Cheddar Cheese | work=Icons of England | url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/cheddar-cheese/biography/history-of-cheddar-finished | accessdate=9 May 2007}}</ref>
For his technical developments, promotion of dairy hygiene and unremunerated propagation of modern cheese-making techniques he has been described as the father of cheddar cheese.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Heeley |first=Anne |coauthors= Mary Vidal |title=Joseph Harding, Cheddar Cheese-Maker |year=1996 |publisher=Friends of the Abbey Barn |location=Glastonbury }}</ref>
Harding introduced new equipment into the process of cheese making, including his "revolving breaker" for curd cutting, saving much manual effort.<ref>Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, By [[Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland]], 1866-7 volume 1, Aberdeen</ref><ref>History of British Agriculture, 1846-1914: 1846 - 1914 - Page 145
by Christabel Susan Lowry Orwin, Edith Holt Whetham - Agriculture - 1964</ref>
The "Joseph Harding method" was the first modern system for cheddar production based upon scientific principles. Harding stated that cheddar cheese is "not made in the field, nor in the [[byre]], nor even in the cow, it is made in the dairy".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gourmetbritain.com/encyclo_entry.php?item=2391 |title=Encyclopedia - Harding, Joseph |publisher=Gourmet Britain |date= |accessdate=23 June 2009}}</ref>  He and his wife were behind the introduction of the cheese into Scotland and North America. Joseph Harding's sons, Henry and William Harding, were responsible for introducing cheddar cheese production to Australia<ref>{{cite book | title=From Artisans to "Factories": The Interpenetration of Craft and Industry in English Cheese-Making 1650–1950 | first1=Richard | last1=Blundel | first2=Angela | last2=Tregear | publisher=Enterprise and Society | date=17 October 2006}}</ref> and facilitating the establishment of the cheese industry in New Zealand respectively. 

During [[World War II]], and for nearly a decade after the war, most milk in Britain was used for the making of one single kind of cheese nicknamed "Government cheddar" as part of war economies and [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/government-cheddar-cheese |title=Government Cheddar Cheese |publisher= Practically Edible |accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref>
This nearly resulted in wiping out all other cheese production in the country. Before [[World War I]] there were more than 3,500 cheese producers in Britain, while fewer than 100 remained after the Second World War.<ref>{{Cite web| url= http://www.thestar.com/News/article/264784 | title= Cool Britannia rules the whey  |last=Potter |first=Mich | publisher= [[Toronto Star]]  | date= 9 October 2007 | accessdate= 4 January 2009}}</ref>

==Process==
[[File:Cheese curds 2.jpg|thumb|left|A bowl of [[cheese curds]]]]
{{Main|Manufacture of cheddar cheese}}

The curds and whey are separated using [[rennet]], an enzyme complex normally produced from the stomachs of newborn calves (in [[vegetarian]] or [[kosher]] cheeses, bacterial-, yeast- or mould-derived [[chymosin]] is used).<ref name=telegraph /><ref>{{Cite web| url= http://www.vegsoc.org/info/cheese.html | publisher= [[Vegetarian Society]] | title= Information Sheet - Cheese & Rennet | accessdate= 10 March 2008}}</ref>

''Cheddaring'' refers to an additional step in the production of cheddar cheese where, after heating, the [[curd]] is kneaded with salt, cut into cubes to drain the [[whey]] then stacked and turned.<ref name="telegraph">{{Cite news| url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/wine/main.jhtml?xml=/wine/2005/06/18/edsavvy18.xml | publisher= Daily Telegraph | title= Savvy shopper: Cheddar | date= 18 June 2005 | accessdate= 10 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref> Strong, extra-mature cheddar, sometimes called vintage, needs to be matured for up to 15 months. The cheese is kept at a constant temperature often requiring special facilities. As with other hard cheese varieties produced worldwide, [[cave]]s provide an ideal environment for maturing cheese; still, today, some cheddar cheese is matured in the caves at [[Wookey Hole Caves|Wookey Hole]] and [[Cheddar Gorge]].

==Character==
[[File:MidSomerset Show 170803.jpg|left|thumb|Cheddar cheeses on display at the Mid Somerset Show]]
The ideal quality of the original Somerset Cheddar was described by Joseph Harding in 1864 as "close and firm in texture, yet mellow in character or quality; it is rich with a tendency to melt in the mouth, the flavour full and fine, approaching to that of a hazelnut".<ref>Transactions of the New-York State Agricultural Society for the Year 1864, page 232, volume 14 1865, Albany</ref>

Cheddar made in the classical way tends to have a sharp, pungent flavour, often slightly earthy. Its texture is firm, with farmhouse traditional cheddar being slightly crumbly; it should also, if mature, contain large [[cheese crystals]] consisting of [[calcium lactate]] – often precipitated when matured for times longer than six months.<ref name="Phadungath">{{Cite thesis | last= Phadungath | first = Chanokphat| title = The Efficacy of Sodium Gluconate as a Calcium Lactate Crystal Inhibitor in Cheddar Cheese | type = |chapter = | url = http://purl.umn.edu/116278 | year = 2011 | publisher = University of Minnesota | accessdate = 12 October 2013}}</ref> Real Cheddar is never "soapy", in texture or [[mouthfeel]], and tends to be more brittle than other types of [[cheese]]s.

Cheddar is usually a deep to pale yellow (off-white) colour, but food colourings are sometimes used in industrial varieties of cheddar-style cheeses. One commonly used example is [[annatto]], extracted from seeds of the tropical [[Achiote|achiote tree]]. The largest producer of industrial cheddar-style cheese in the United States, [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]], uses a combination of annatto and oleoresin paprika, an extract of the lipophilic (oily) portion of [[paprika]].<ref name="df">{{cite book| last = Feldman| first = David| title = When Do Fish Sleep? And Other Imponderables of Everyday Life| year = 1989| publisher = Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc.| isbn = 0-06-016161-2| page = 15 }}</ref>
Coloured cheddar cheese has long been sold, but even as early as 1860, the real reason for this was unclear: [[Joseph Harding]] stated "to the cheese consumers of London who prefer an adulterated food to that which is pure I have to announce an improvement in the annatto with which they compel the cheesemakers to colour the cheese".<ref>{{cite journal| last = Murray| first = John| title = Recent Improvements in Dairy Practice| url = http://books.google.com/?id=OKsGTRlEfSgC&pg=PA82| volume = 21| year = 1860| publisher = | location = London| page = 90| journal = Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England }}</ref> According to David Feldman, an author of trivia books, "The only reason why cheesemakers colour their product is because consumers seem to prefer it".<ref name=df/>

Cheddar cheese was sometimes (and still can be found) packaged in black wax, but was more commonly packaged in larded cloth, which was impermeable to contaminants, but still allowed the cheese to "breathe", although this practice is now limited to artisan cheese makers.

The [[Slow Food|Slow Food Movement]] has created a ''Cheddar [[Presidium]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|author=Blulab sas |url=http://www.slowfoodfoundation.org/eng/presidi/dettaglio.lasso?cod=148 |title=La Fondazione - slow food per la biodiversità - ONLUS |publisher=Slowfoodfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=23 June 2009}}</ref> claiming that only three cheeses should be called "Cheddar". Their specifications, which go further than the West Country Farmhouse Cheddar [[Protected Designation of Origin]] (PDO), require that cheddar cheese be made in Somerset and with traditional methods, such as using raw milk, traditional animal [[rennet]], and a cloth wrapping.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Presidia Artisan Somerset Cheddar  | work=The Slow Food Foundation | url=http://www.slowfoodfoundation.com/eng/presidi/dettaglio.lasso?cod=148 | accessdate=9 May 2007}}</ref>

Notable cheddar cheeses include "Quickes", which in 2009 was awarded cheese of the year by the British Cheese Association, "Keen's", with a strong tang, and "Montgomery's", with an apple aftertaste. [[Lincolnshire Poacher cheese]] is an example of a cheese made in the style of a traditional cheddar in [[Lincolnshire]].

==International production==

===Status===
The Cheddar cheese name is used internationally; its name does not have a [[Protected Geographical Status|protected designation of origin]] (PDO) but the use of the name West Country Farmhouse Cheddar does. Countries making cheddar cheese include Australia, Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. 'Cheddars' can be industrial or [[artisan cheese]]s. The flavour, colour, and quality of industrial cheese varies significantly, and food packaging will usually indicate a strength, such as mild, medium, strong, tasty, sharp, extra sharp, mature, old, or vintage; this may indicate the maturation period, or food additives used to enhance the flavour. Artisan varieties develop strong and diverse flavours over time.

===Canada===
Following a wheat midge outbreak in Canada in the mid-nineteenth century, farmers in [[Ontario]] began to convert to [[dairy farming]] in large numbers, and cheddar cheese became their main exportable product, even being exported back to England. By the turn of the twentieth century there were 1,242 cheddar factories in Ontario, and cheddar had become Canada’s second largest export behind timber.<ref name="thewalrus.ca">http://thewalrus.ca/manufacturing-taste/</ref>  Cheddar exports totalled {{convert|234000000|lbs}} in 1904, but by 2012, Canada was a net importer of cheese.  [[James L. Kraft]] grew up on a dairy farm in Ontario, before moving to Chicago. As writer Sarah Champman writes, "Although we cannot wholly lay the decline of cheese craft in Canada at the feet of James Lewis Kraft, it did correspond with the rise of Kraft’s processed cheese empire."<ref name="thewalrus.ca"/> Canadian 'Cheddar' is produced mostly by a number of large companies in [[Ontario]], though other provinces produce some and there are some smaller artisanal producers. The annual production is 120,000 tons <ref>[http://www.canadianliving.com/food/__all_you_need_is_cheese/types_of_cheddar_cheese.php Types of cheddar cheese, Canadian Living]</ref> It is aged a minimum of three months, but much of it is held for much longer, up to 10 years.

Canadian cheddar cheese soup is a featured dish at the [[Canada (Epcot)|Canada pavilion]] at [[Epcot]], in [[Walt Disney World Resort|Walt Disney World]].<ref>[http://allears.net/din/rec_ched.htm Recipe for Canadian cheddar cheese soup at Epcot]</ref>

===New Zealand===
Much of the cheddar cheese in New Zealand is factory produced but reportedly good quality. Most of it is sold young within the country. The [[Anchor (brand)|Anchor]] dairy company ships New Zealand cheddars to the UK, where it matures for another year or so.<ref name=Ridgway77/>

===United Kingdom===
{{Double image|right|PDO-Logo.svg|120|WestcountryCheddar-Counties.svg|120|PDO logo can be displayed on any approved West Country Farmhouse Cheddar cheese|The four English counties in the PDO}}
Only one producer of the cheese is now based in [[Cheddar]] itself, The Cheddar Gorge Cheese Co.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cheddargorgecheeseco.co.uk|title=Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company}}</ref> The name "cheddar" is not protected by the European Union, though the name "West Country Farmhouse Cheddar" has an EU [[Protected Geographical Status|Protected Designation of Origin]], and may only be produced in [[Somerset]], [[Devon]], [[Dorset]], and [[Cornwall]], using milk sourced from those counties.<ref name="PDO">{{Cite web| url= http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/industry/regional/foodname/products/registered/westcoun.htm | publisher= [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|defra]] | title= EU Protected Food Names Scheme - UK registered names | accessdate= 22 July 2009}}</ref>  Cheddar is usually sold as mild, medium, mature, extra mature or vintage.

===United States===

[[File:Bravo Cheddar.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Cheddar-style cheese from Bravo Farms, [[Traver, California]]]]
The state of [[Wisconsin]] produces the most cheddar cheese in the United States; other centres of production include [[California]], [[Idaho]], [[Upstate New York]], [[Vermont]], [[Tillamook, Oregon]], [[Texas]], and [[Oklahoma]]. It comes in several varieties, including mild, medium, sharp, extra sharp, New York Style, white, and Vermont. New York cheddar-style cheese is particularly sharp, and usually slightly softer than milder varieties. Cheese that has not been coloured is frequently labelled as "white cheddar" or "Vermont cheddar," regardless of whether it was produced in the state of Vermont. Vermont has three creameries that produce what is regarded as first-class cheddar cheeses: the [[Cabot Creamery]], which produces the sixteen-month-old Private Stock Cheddar; the Grafton Village Company; and Shelburne Farms.<ref name="Ridgway77">Ridgway, Judy. ''The Cheese Companion''. Running Press, 2004, p. 77.</ref>

Some cheeses called Cheddar are actually flavoured [[processed cheese]]s or cheese food, and often bear little resemblance to the original cheese. Examples include [[Easy Cheese]], a cheese food contained in a spray can, or in individually wrapped processed cheese slices.

'Cheddar' is one of several products used by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] to track the [[dairy industry]]; reports are issued weekly detailing prices and production quantities.
