'''Cracking''' or '''popping''' of joints is the action of [[joint manipulation]] to produce a sharp cracking or popping sound. This commonly occurs during deliberate [[knuckle]]-cracking.  It is possible to crack many joints, such as those in the back and neck [[vertebrae]], hips, wrists, elbows, shoulders, toes, ankles, knees, jaws, feet, and the [[Achilles tendon]] area.

==Causes==
The physical mechanism causing a cracking sound produced by bending, twisting, or compressing joints is uncertain. Suggested causes include:

* [[Cavitation]] within the joint&mdash;small cavities of partial vacuum form in the synovial fluid and then rapidly collapse, producing a sharp sound. 
* Rapid stretching of ligaments.<ref name="Protopapas"/>
* Intra-articular (within-joint) [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]] being broken.<ref name="Protopapas"/>

[[Synovial fluid]] cavitation has some evidence to support it.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Brodeur R. | title = The audible release associated with joint manipulation. | journal = J Manipulative Physiol Ther | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 155–64 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7790795}}</ref> When a [[spinal manipulation]] is performed, the applied force separates the [[articular]] surfaces of a fully encapsulated synovial joint, which in turn creates a reduction in pressure within the joint cavity. In this low-pressure environment, some of the [[gases]] that are dissolved in the [[synovial fluid]] (which are naturally found in all bodily fluids) leave the solution, making a [[liquid bubble|bubble]], or [[cavity]], which rapidly collapses upon itself, resulting in a "clicking" sound. The contents of the resultant gas bubble are thought to be mainly [[carbon dioxide]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Unsworth A, Dowson D, Wright V. | title = 'Cracking joints'.

There is some evidence that [[Ligamentous laxity|ligament laxity]] may be associated with an increased tendency to cavitate.<ref name="Fryer">{{cite journal | author = Fryer, Gary and Jacob, Mudge and McLaughlin, Patrick | year = 2002 | title = The Effect of Talocrural Joint Manipulation on Range of Motion at the Ankle | journal = [[Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics]] | issue = 6 | pages = 384–390 | pmid = 12183696 | doi = 10.1067/mmt.2002.126129 | volume = 25}}</ref>

The snapping of tendons or scar tissue over a prominence (as in [[snapping hip syndrome]]) can also generate a loud snapping or popping sound.<ref name="Protopapas">{{cite journal | author = Protopapas M, Cymet T, Protapapas M | title = Joint cracking and popping: understanding noises that accompany articular release. | journal = J Am Osteopath Assoc | volume = 102 | issue = 5 | pages = 283–7 | date=1 May 2002| pmid = 12033758 | url = http://www.jaoa.org/cgi/reprint/102/5/283 }}</ref>

The common claim that cracking one's knuckles causes [[arthritis]] appears unsupported. A recent study examined the hand radiographs of 215 people (aged 50 to 89) and compared the joints of those who regularly cracked their knuckles to those who did not.<ref name="Deweber">{{cite journal | author = Deweber K, Olszewski M, Ortolano R. | title = Knuckle cracking and hand osteoarthritis | journal = J Am Board Fam Med | pages = 169–174 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.3122/jabfm.2011.02.100156| pmc = | volume = 24 | pmid=21383216 | issue = 2}}</ref> The study concluded that knuckle-cracking did not cause hand osteoarthritis, no matter how many years or how often a person cracked their knuckles.<ref name="Deweber"/> An earlier study also concluded that there was no increased preponderance of arthritis of the hand of chronic knuckle-crackers; however, habitual knuckle-crackers were more likely to have hand swelling and lowered grip strength.<ref name="Castellanos">{{cite journal | author = Castellanos J., Axelrod D. | title = Effect of habitual knuckle cracking on hand function | journal = Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases | pages = 49(5):308–9 | year = 1990 | doi = 10.1136/ard.49.5.308 | pmc = 1004074 | volume = 49 | pmid=2344210 | issue = 5}}</ref> Habitual knuckle-cracking was associated with manual labour, biting of the nails, smoking, and drinking alcohol and was suggested to result in functional hand impairment.<ref name="Castellanos"/> This early study has been criticized for not taking into consideration the possibility of confounding factors, such as whether the ability to crack one's knuckles is associated with impaired hand functioning rather than being a cause of it.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Simkin|first=Peter|title=Habitual knuckle cracking and hand function.|journal=Annals of Rheumatic Disease|year=1990|month=November|volume=49|issue=11|pages=957|accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref> 

Medical doctor Donald Unger cracked the knuckles of his left hand every day for more than sixty years, but he did not crack the knuckles of his right hand. No arthritis or other ailments formed in either hand, earning him the 2009 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in Medicine, a [[parody]] of the [[Nobel Prize]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig2009 | title=2009 Winners of the Ig® Nobel Prize|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>
