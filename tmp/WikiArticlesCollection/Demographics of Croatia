The '''[[demography|demographic]] characteristics of the [[population]] of [[Croatia]]''' are known through censuses, normally conducted in ten-year intervals and analysed by various statistical bureaus since the 1850s. The [[Croatian Bureau of Statistics]] has performed this task since the 1990s. The latest census in Croatia was performed in April 2011. The permanent population of Croatia at the 2011 census had reached 4.29&nbsp;million. The [[population density]] is 75.8 inhabitants per square kilometre, and the overall [[List of countries by life expectancy|life expectancy in Croatia]] at birth is 75.7 years. The population rose steadily (with the exception of censuses taken following the two world wars) from 2.1&nbsp;million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7&nbsp;million. Since 1991, Croatia's [[death rate]] has continuously exceeded its [[birth rate]]; the natural growth rate of the population is currently negative. Croatia is currently in the fourth or fifth stage of the [[demographic transition]]. In terms of age structure, the population is dominated by the 15&ndash;64&nbsp;year old segment. The median age of the population is 41.4, and the gender ratio of the total population is 0.93 males per 1 female.

Croatia is inhabited mostly by [[Croats]] (90.4%), while minorities include [[Serbs]] (4.5%), and 21 other ethnicities (less than 1% each). The demographic history of Croatia is marked by significant migrations, including the arrival of the Croats in the area growth of Hungarian and German speaking population since the [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|personal union of Croatia and Hungary]], and joining of the [[Habsburg Empire]], migrations set off by [[Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War|Ottoman conquests]] and growth of Italian speaking population in [[Istria]] and in [[Dalmatia]] during [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]] rule there. After the collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]], the Hungarian population declined, while the German-speaking population was forced or compelled to leave after World War II and [[Istrian exodus|similar fate]] was suffered by the Italian population. Late 19th century and the 20th century were marked by large scale economic migrations abroad. The 1940s and the 1950s in [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] were marked by internal migrations in Yugoslavia, as well as by [[urbanisation]]. The most recent significant migrations came as a result of the [[Croatian War of Independence]] when hundreds of thousands were displaced.

The [[Croatian language]] is the official language of Croatia, but minority languages are officially used in some local government units. Croatian is declared as the native language by 95,60% of the population. A 2009 survey revealed that 78% of Croatians claim knowledge of at least one foreign language&mdash;most often [[English language|English]]. The main religions of Croatia are [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] (86.28%), [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] (4.44%) and [[Islam]] (1.47%). Literacy in Croatia stands at 98.1%. The proportion of the population aged 15 and over attaining [[academic degree]]s grew rapidly since 2001, doubling and reaching 16.7% by 2008. An estimated 4.5% of the GDP is spent for education. Primary and secondary education are available in Croatian and in languages of recognised minorities. Croatia has a [[universal health care]] system and in 2010, the nation spent 6.9% of its GDP on healthcare. Net monthly income in September 2011 averaged 5,397 [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] ({{circa}} 729 [[euro]]). The most significant sources of employment in 2008 were manufacturing industry, wholesale and retail trade and construction. In October 2011, unemployment rate was 17.4%. Croatia's median equivalent household income tops average [[Purchasing Power Standard]] of [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|the ten countries which joined the EU in 2004]], while trailing the EU average. 2011 census recorded a total of 1.5&nbsp;million private households, which predominantly owned their own housing. Average [[urbanisation]] rate in Croatia stands at 56%, with augmentation of urban population and reduction of rural population.

One explanation for the recent population decrease is the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. During the war, large sections of the population were displaced and emigration increased. In 1991, in predominantly Serb areas, more than 400,000 Croats and other non-[[Serbs]] were either removed from their homes by the Croatian Serb forces or fled the violence.<ref name="United Nations">{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2007/pr1162e-summary.htm|title=Summary of judgement for Milan Martić|date=12 June 2007|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=21 June 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071215084458/http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2007/pr1162e-summary.htm |archivedate=15 December 2007}}</ref> In 1995, during the final days of the war, more than 120,000 and perhaps as many as 200,000 Serbs fled the country before the arrival of Croatian forces during [[Operation Storm]].<ref name="Erlanger">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/16/world/for-serbs-in-croatia-a-pledge-unkept.html|title=For Serbs in Croatia, a Pledge Unkept|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=15 October 2011|author=[[Steven Erlanger]]|date=16 January 2000|accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="Prodger">{{cite web|author=[[Matt Prodger]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4747379.stm|title=Evicted Serbs remember Storm|publisher=BBC News|date=5 August 2005 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}</ref> Within a decade following the end of the war, only 117,000 Serb refugees returned out of the 300,000 displaced during the entire war.<ref name="OSCE-Reform">{{cite web|publisher=[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]|format=PDF|title=STATUS REPORT No.16 ON CROATIA’S PROGRESS IN MEETING INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS SINCE NOVEMBER 2004|date=7 July 2005|url=http://www.osce.org/zagreb/15985|accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref> Most of Croatia's remaining Serbs never lived in areas occupied in the Croatian War of Independence.

In 2009, there were 44,577 live births in Croatia, comprising 22,877 male and 21,700 female children. Virtually all of those were performed in medical facilities; only 34 births occurred elsewhere. Out of the total number, 38,809 children were born in wedlock or within 300&nbsp;days after the end of the marriage, and the average age of mothers at the birth of their first child was 27&nbsp;years and 5&nbsp;months. General fertility rate, i.e. number of births per 1,000 women aged 15–49 is 42.9, with the age specific rate peaking at 101.0 per million for women aged 25–29. In 2009, 52,414 persons died in Croatia, 48.5% of whom died in medical facilities and 90.0% of whom were receiving medical treatment at the time. [[Cardiovascular disease]] and [[cancer]] were the primary causes of death in the country, with 26,235 and 13,280 deaths respectively. In the same year, there were 2,986 violent deaths, including 2,121 due to accidents. The latter figure includes 616 deaths in traffic accidents.

The median age of the population is 41.4. The sex ratio of the population is 1.06 males per 1 female at birth and up to 14 years of age, and 0.99 males per 1 female between the ages of 15 and 64.

There were 8,468 immigrants in Croatia in 2009, more than half of them (57.5%) coming from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a sharp decline from the previous year's 14,541. In the same year, there were 9,940 emigrants from the country, 44.8% of them leaving to [[Serbia]]. The number of emigrants represents a substantial increase compared to the figure of 7,488 recorded in 2008. In 2009, the net migration to and from abroad peaked in the [[Sisak-Moslavina County]] (-1,093 persons) and the city of [[Zagreb]] (+830 persons).

In 2009, a total of 22,382 marriages were performed in Croatia as well as 5,076 divorces. The 2001 census recorded 1.47&nbsp;million households in the country.<ref name="DZS-Stat2010"/>

===Significant migrations===
[[File:Ad-of-croat-cruiser-en-route-to-sth-america.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A 1930s ad for shipping lines to South America]]
The demographic history of Croatia is characterised by significant migrations, starting with the arrival of the Croats in the area. According to the work ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' written by the 10th-century Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine VII]], the Croats arrived in the area of modern-day Croatia in the early 7th&nbsp;century. However, that claim is disputed, and competing hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries.<ref name="Mužić-249-293">{{cite book|author=Ivan Mužić|title=Hrvatska povijest devetoga stoljeća|trans_title=Croatian Ninth Century History|language=Croatian|url= http://www.muzic-ivan.info/hrvatska_povijest.pdf|format=PDF|isbn=978-953-263-034-3|year=2007|publisher=Naklada Bošković|accessdate=14 October 2011|pages=249–293}}</ref> Following the establishment of a [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|personal union of Croatia and Hungary]] in 1102,<ref name="HR-HU-Heka">{{cite journal|journal=Scrinia Slavonica|issn=1332-4853|publisher=Hrvatski institut za povijest – Podružnica za povijest Slavonije, Srijema i Baranje|title= Hrvatsko-ugarski odnosi od sredinjega vijeka do nagodbe iz 1868. s posebnim osvrtom na pitanja Slavonije|trans_title=Croatian-Hungarian relations from the Middle Ages to the Compromise of 1868, with a special survey of the Slavonian issue|language=Croatian|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=68144|author= Ladislav Heka|year=2008|month=October|volume=8|issue=1|pages=152–173|accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref> and the joining of the [[Habsburg Empire]] in 1527,<ref name="Povijest-saborovanja">{{cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=404|title=Povijest saborovanja|trans_title=History of parliamentarism|language=Croatian|publisher=[[Sabor]]|accessdate=18 October 2010|archivedate=26 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69Qkc8832}}</ref> the Hungarian and German speaking population of Croatia began gradually increasing in number.

The period between 1890 and World War I was marked by large economic emigration from Croatia to the [[United States]], and particularly to the areas of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Cleveland]] and [[Chicago]].
