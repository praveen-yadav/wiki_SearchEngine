'''''Cyperales''''' is a name for an order of [[flowering plants]].  As used in the [[Engler system]] (update, of 1964) and in the [[Wettstein system]] it consisted of only the single family. In the [[Cronquist system]] it is used for an order (placed in subclass ''[[Commelinidae]]'') and circumscribed as (1981):

* order ''Cyperales''
*: family ''[[Cyperaceae]]''
*: family ''[[Poaceae]]'' (or ''Gramineae'')

The [[APG II system]], used here, assigns the plants involved to the order ''[[Poales]]''.
