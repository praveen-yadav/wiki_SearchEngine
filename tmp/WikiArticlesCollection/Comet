[[File:Comet-Hale-Bopp-29-03-1997 hires adj.jpg|thumb|right|[[Comet Hale-Bopp]], as seen in [[Pazin]], [[Croatia]] 1997.]]

A '''comet''' is an icy [[small Solar System body]] that, when passing close to the [[Sun]], heats up and begins to outgas, displaying a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of [[solar radiation]] and the [[solar wind]] upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma and tail are much larger, and if sufficiently bright may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many different cultures.

Comets have a wide range of [[orbital period]]s, ranging from several years to several millions of years. Short-period comets originate in the [[Kuiper belt]] or its associated [[scattered disc]], which lie beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]]. Longer-period comets are thought to originate in the [[Oort cloud]], a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the [[Kuiper Belt]] to halfway to the next nearest star. Long-period comets are directed towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by [[gravitational perturbation]]s caused by [[List of nearest stars#Future and past|passing stars]] and the [[galactic tide]]. [[Hyperbola|Hyperbolic]] comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung out to [[interstellar space]] along [[Hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic trajectories]].

Comets are distinguished from [[asteroid]]s by the presence of an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus. This atmosphere has parts termed the coma (the central atmosphere immediately surrounding the nucleus) and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from the coma by the Sun's light pressure or outstreaming solar wind plasma). However, [[extinct comets]] that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is the difference between asteroids and comets |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Frequently_asked_questions |work=Rosetta's Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> Asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets, having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer Solar System.<ref>{{cite web |title=What Are Asteroids And Comets |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/#ast |work=Near Earth Object Program FAQ |publisher=NASA |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1150683 |title=Comparison of Comet 81P/Wild 2 Dust with Interplanetary Dust from Comets |year=2008 |last1=Ishii |first1=H.

The word ''comet'' derives from the [[Old English]] ''cometa'' from the [[Latin]] ''comēta'' or ''comētēs''. That, in turn, is a [[Latinisation of names|latinisation]] of the Greek ''κομήτης'' ("wearing long hair"), and the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] notes that the term (''ἀστὴρ'') ''κομήτης'' already meant "long-haired star, comet" in Greek. ''Κομήτης'' was derived from ''κομᾶν'' ("to wear the hair long"), which was itself derived from ''κόμη'' ("the hair of the head") and was used to mean "the tail of a comet".<ref>{{OED|comet}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://etymonline.com/?term=comet |title=Comet (n.) |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=30 July 2013 |last=Harper |first=Douglas}}</ref>

The solid, core structure of a comet is known as the nucleus. Cometary nuclei are composed of an amalgamation of [[rock (geology)|rock]], dust, [[ice|water ice]], and frozen gases such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[methane]], and [[ammonia]].<ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=1998A&A...330..375G |title=Making a comet nucleus |author1=Greenberg |first1=J.

The surface of the nucleus is generally dry, dusty or rocky, suggesting that the ices are hidden beneath a surface crust several metres thick. In addition to the gases already mentioned, the nuclei contain a variety of [[organic compound]]s, which may include [[methanol]], [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[formaldehyde]], [[ethanol]], and [[ethane]] and perhaps more complex molecules such as long-chain [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[amino acid]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last=Meech |first=M. |title=1997 Apparition of Comet Hale–Bopp: What We Can Learn from Bright Comets |url=http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Feb97/Bright.html |publisher=Planetary Science Research Discoveries |date=24 March 1997 |accessdate=30 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Stardust Findings Suggest Comets More Complex Than Thought |url=http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news110.html |publisher=NASA |date=14 December 2006 |accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref> In 2009, it was confirmed that the amino acid [[glycine]] had been found in the comet [[dust]] recovered by NASA's [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust mission]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.2009.tb01224.x |title=Cometary glycine detected in samples returned by Stardust |year=2009 |last1=Elsila |first1=Jamie E. |last2=Glavin |first2=Daniel P. |last3=Dworkin |first3=Jason P. |journal=Meteoritics & Planetary Science |volume=44 |issue=9 |pages=1323|bibcode = 2009M&PS...44.1323E }}</ref> In August 2011, a report, based on [[NASA]] studies of [[meteorites]] found on [[Earth]], was published suggesting [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] components ([[adenine]], [[guanine]], and related [[organic molecules]]) may have been formed on [[asteroids]] and comets.<ref name="Callahan">{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1106493108 |title=Carbonaceous meteorites contain a wide range of extraterrestrial nucleobases |year=2011 |last1=Callahan |first1=M.

The outer surfaces of cometary nuclei have a very low [[albedo]], making them among the least reflective objects found in the Solar System. The [[Giotto mission|Giotto]] [[space probe]] found that the nucleus of [[Halley's Comet]] reflects about four percent of the light that falls on it,<ref name="dark">{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.275.5308.1900 |title=The Activity and Size of the Nucleus of Comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1) |year=1997 |last1=Weaver |first1=H.

The dark surface material of the nucleus may consist of complex [[organic compounds]]. Solar heating drives off lighter [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[Chemical compound|compounds]], leaving behind larger organic compounds that tend to be very dark, like [[tar]] or [[petroleum|crude oil]]. The low reflectivity of cometary surfaces enables them to absorb the heat necessary to drive their [[outgassing]] processes.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PRqVqQKao9QC&pg=PA91#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=91 |title=Habitability and Cosmic Catastrophes |isbn=9783540769453 |author1=Hanslmeier |first1=Arnold |year=2008}}</ref>

Once the particles have been ionized, they attain a net positive electrical charge, which in turn gives rise to an "induced [[magnetosphere]]" around the comet. The comet and its induced magnetic field form an obstacle to outward flowing solar wind particles. Because the relative orbital speed of the comet and the solar wind is supersonic, a [[bow shock]] is formed upstream of the comet in the flow direction of the solar wind. In this bow shock, large concentrations of cometary ions (called "pick-up ions") congregate and act to "load" the solar magnetic field with plasma, such that the field lines "drape" around the comet forming the ion tail.<ref name="pp 864">{{cite book |last1=Carroll |first1=B.

[[File:Encke tail rip off.ogg|thumb|left|[[Encke's Comet]] loses its tail]]

If the ion tail loading is sufficient, then the magnetic field lines are squeezed together to the point where, at some distance along the ion tail, [[magnetic reconnection]] occurs. This leads to a "tail disconnection event".<ref name="pp 864" /> This has been observed on a number of occasions, one notable event being recorded on April 20, 2007, when the ion tail of [[Encke's Comet]] was completely severed while the comet passed through a [[coronal mass ejection]]. This event was observed by the [[STEREO|STEREO space probe]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11207-008-9299-0 |title=The Heliospheric Imagers Onboard the STEREO Mission |year=2008 |last1=Eyles |first1=C.

Most comets are [[small Solar System bodies]] with elongated [[elliptical orbit]]s that take them close to the Sun for a part of their orbit and then out into the further reaches of the Solar System for the remainder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~bds2/ltsn/ljm/JAVA/COMETORB/COMET.HTM |title=The Orbit of a Comet |publisher=University of St Andrews |accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref> Comets are often classified according to the length of their [[orbital period]]s: The longer the period the more elongated the ellipse.

At the shorter extreme, [[Encke's Comet]] has an orbit that does not reach the orbit of Jupiter, and is known as an Encke-type comet.

Because their elliptical orbits frequently take them close to the giant planets, comets are subject to further [[Perturbation (astronomy)|gravitational perturbations]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l11_p9.html |title=Comets |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University |accessdate=8 August 2013}}</ref> Short-period comets display a tendency for their [[Apsis|aphelia]] to coincide with a [[gas giant]]'s orbital radius, with the Jupiter family of comets being the largest.<ref name="britastro"/> It is clear that comets coming in from the Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets as a result of a close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.<ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|pp=102–104}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w7E_uwj0Lc8C&pg=PA246#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=246 |title=In Quest of the Solar System |isbn=9780763794774 |last=Koupelis |first=Theo |year=2010}}</ref>

Based on their orbital characteristics, short-period comets are thought to originate from the [[Centaur (minor planet)|centaurs]] and the Kuiper belt/[[scattered disc]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Davidsson |first=Björn J.

Occasionally the gravitational influence of the outer planets (in the case of Kuiper belt objects) or nearby stars (in the case of Oort cloud objects) may throw one of these bodies into an elliptical orbit that takes it inwards toward the [[Sun]] to form a visible comet. Unlike the return of periodic comets, whose orbits have been established by previous observations, the appearance of new comets by this mechanism is unpredictable.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PRqVqQKao9QC&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=152 |title=Habitability and Cosmic Catastrophes |isbn=9783540769453 |last=Hanslmeier |first=Arnold |year=2008}}</ref>

Long-period comets have highly [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] orbits and periods ranging from 200 years to thousands or even millions of years.<ref name="SBP"/> An eccentricity greater than 1 when near [[perihelion]] does not necessarily mean that a comet will leave the Solar System.<ref name=Elenin2011>{{cite web |url=http://spaceobs.org/en/2011/03/07/vliyanie-planet-gigantov-na-orbitu-komety-c2010-x1-elenin/ |title=Influence of giant planets on the orbit of comet C/2010 X1 |first=Leonid |last=Elenin |date=7 March 2011 |accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref> For example, [[C/2006 P1|Comet McNaught]] had a heliocentric osculating eccentricity of 1.000019 near its perihelion passage [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] in January 2007 but is bound to the Sun with roughly a 92,600-year orbit because the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] drops below 1 as it moves further from the Sun. The future orbit of a long-period comet is properly obtained when the [[osculating orbit]] is computed at an epoch after leaving the planetary region and is calculated with respect to the [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|center of mass of the Solar System]]. By definition long-period comets remain gravitationally bound to the Sun; those comets that are ejected from the Solar System due to close passes by major planets are no longer properly considered as having "periods". The orbits of long-period comets take them far beyond the outer planets at aphelia, and the plane of their orbits need not lie near the ecliptic. Long-period comets such as [[Comet West]] and [[C/1999 F1]] can have [[apoapsis]] distances of nearly 70,000 AU with orbital periods estimated around 6 million years.

Single-apparition or non-periodic comets are similar to long-period comets because they also have [[parabolic trajectory|parabolic]] or slightly [[hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic]] trajectories<ref name="SBP">{{cite web |title=Small Bodies: Profile |url=http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/special/smbod.htm |publisher=NASA/JPL |date=29 October 2008 |accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref> when near perihelion in the inner Solar System.

Some authorities use the term "periodic comet" to refer to any comet with a periodic orbit (that is, all short-period comets plus all long-period comets),<ref>{{cite web |title=Comet |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-54344/comet |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |accessdate=13 August 2013}}</ref> whereas others use it to mean exclusively short-period comets.<ref name="SBP"/> Similarly, although the literal meaning of "non-periodic comet" is the same as "single-apparition comet", some use it to mean all comets that are not "periodic" in the second sense (that is, to also include all comets with a period greater than 200 years).

Early observations have revealed a few genuinely hyperbolic (i.e. non-periodic) trajectories, but no more than could be accounted for by perturbations from Jupiter. If comets pervaded [[interstellar space]], they would be moving with velocities of the same order as the relative velocities of stars near the Sun (a few tens of kms per second). If such objects entered the Solar System, they would have positive [[specific orbital energy]] and would be observed to have genuinely hyperbolic trajectories. A rough calculation shows that there might be four hyperbolic comets per century within Jupiter's orbit, give or take one and perhaps two orders of [[Order of magnitude|magnitude]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/185590 |title=On the nondetection of extrasolar comets |year=1989 |last1=McGlynn |first1=Thomas A. |last2=Chapman |first2=Robert D. |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=346 |pages=L105|bibcode = 1989ApJ...346L.105M }}</ref>

===Lost===
{{main|Lost comet}}
A number of periodic comets discovered in earlier decades or previous centuries are now [[lost comet]]s. Their orbits were never known well enough to predict future appearances or the comets have disintegrated. However, occasionally a "new" comet is discovered, and calculation of its orbit shows it to be an old "lost" comet. An example is Comet [[11P/Tempel–Swift–LINEAR]], discovered in 1869 but unobservable after 1908 because of perturbations by Jupiter. It was not found again until accidentally rediscovered by [[LINEAR]] in 2001.<ref name="kronk">

==Fate of comets==

===Departure (ejection) from Solar System===
If a comet is traveling fast enough, it may leave the Solar System; such is the case for hyperbolic comets. To date, comets are only known to be ejected by [[Perturbation (astronomy)|interacting]] with another object in the Solar System, such as Jupiter.<ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=1991JBAA..101..119H |title=On hyperbolic comets |author1=Hughes |first1=D.

===Volatiles exhausted===
{{Main|Extinct comet}}
Jupiter-family comets and long-period comets appear to follow very different fading laws. The JFCs are active over a lifetime of about 10,000 years or ~1,000 orbits whereas long-period comets fade much faster. Only 10% of the long-period comets survive more than 50 passages to small perihelion and only 1% of them survive more than 2,000 passages.<ref name="dormant"/> Eventually most of the volatile material contained in a comet nucleus evaporates away, and the comet becomes a small, dark, inert lump of rock or rubble that can resemble an [[asteroid]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Lyzenga |first=Greg |title=If comets melt, why do they seem to last for long periods of time |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=if-comets-melt-why-do-the |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=16 November 1998 |accessdate=13 August 2013}}</ref> Some asteroids in elliptical orbits are now identified as extinct comets.<ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=2002aste.conf..669W |url=http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hal/PDF/asteroids3.pdf |title=Evolution of Comets into Asteroids |last1=Bottke Jr |first1=William F. |last2=Levison |first2=Harold F. |year=2002 |pages=669 |journal=Asteroids III}}</ref> Roughly six percent of the near-Earth asteroids are thought to be extinct nuclei of comets that no longer emit gas.<ref name="dormant">{{cite journal |last1=Whitman |first1=K. |last2=Morbidelli |first2=Alessandro |last3=Jedicke |first3=Robert |title=The Size–Frequency Distribution of Dormant Jupiter Family Comets |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2006.02.016 |journal=Icarus |volume=183 |page=101 |arxiv=astro-ph/0603106v2 |bibcode = 2006Icar..183..101W }}</ref>

===Breakup===
[[File:Schwassman-Wachmann3-B-HST.gif|thumb|Breaking up of [[73P/Schwassmann–Wachmann]] in 1995. This animation covers three days.]]

Comets [[42P/Neujmin]] and [[53P/Van Biesbroeck]] appear to be fragments of a parent comet. Numerical integrations have shown that both comets had a rather close approach to Jupiter in January 1850, and that, before 1850, the two orbits were nearly identical.<ref name="DPS35">{{cite journal |bibcode=2003DPS....35.4705P |title=Are Comets 42P/Neujmin 3 and 53P/Van Biesbroeck Parts of one Comet? |last1=Pittichova |first1=Jand |last2=Meech |first2=Karen J. |last3=Valsecchi |first3=Giovanni B. |last4=Pittich |first4=Eduard M. |volume=35 |year=2003 |pages=1011 |journal=American Astronomical Society}}</ref>

Some comets have been observed to break up during their perihelion passage, including great comets [[Comet West|West]] and [[Comet Ikeya–Seki|Ikeya–Seki]]. [[3D/Biela|Biela]]'s Comet was one significant example, when it broke into two pieces during its  passage through the perihelion in 1846. These two comets were seen separately in 1852, but never again afterward. Instead, spectacular [[meteor showers]] were seen in 1872 and 1885 when the comet should have been visible. A lesser meteor shower, the [[Andromedids]], occurs annually in November, and it is caused when the Earth crosses the orbit of Biela's Comet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://meteorshowersonline.com/showers/andromedids.html |title=The Andromedids |publisher=Meteor Showers Online |accessdate=27 April 2009}}</ref>

===Collisions===
[[File:Jupiter showing SL9 impact sites.jpg|thumb|Brown spots mark impact sites of [[Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9|Comet Shoemaker–Levy]] on Jupiter]]
Some comets meet a more spectacular end – either falling into the Sun<ref>{{cite web |title=SOHO analyses a kamikaze comet |url=http://sci.esa.int/soho/26188-soho-analyses-a-kamikaze-comet/ |publisher=ESA |date=23 February 2001 |accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref> or smashing into a planet or other body. Collisions between comets and planets or moons were common in the early Solar System: some of the many craters on the [[Moon]], for example, may have been caused by comets. A recent collision of a comet with a planet occurred in July 1994 when [[Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9]] broke up into pieces and collided with Jupiter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/comet.html |title=Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 Collision with Jupiter |accessdate=30 August 2013 |publisher=National Space Science Data Center}}</ref>

====Source of life====
Many comets and asteroids collided into Earth in its early stages. Many scientists believe that comets bombarding the young Earth about 4 billion years ago brought the vast quantities of water that now fill the Earth's oceans, or at least a significant portion of it. Other researchers have cast doubt on this theory.<ref>{{cite web |last=Muir |first=Hazel |title=Earth's water brewed at home, not in space |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12693 |work=New Scientist |date=25 September 2007 |accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref> The detection of organic molecules in significant quantities in comets has led some to speculate that comets or [[meteorite]]s may have brought the precursors of life—or even life itself—to Earth.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Dfn0VoICrBYC&pg=PA315#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=315 |title=Comets |isbn=9781402034954 |last=Fernández |first=Julio A. |year=2006}}</ref>

It is suspected that comet impacts have, over long timescales, also delivered significant quantities of water to the Earth's [[Moon]], some of which may have survived as [[lunar ice]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/articles/water-discovered-in-apollo-moon-rocks-likely-came-from-comets/ |title=Water Discovered in Apollo Moon Rocks Likely Came from Comets |accessdate=7 September 2013 |publisher=NASA}}</ref> Comet and [[meteoroid]] impacts are also believed responsible for the existence of [[tektite]]s and [[australite]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/discoverycentre/infosheets/australites/ |title=Australites |publisher=Museum Victoria |accessdate=7 September 2013}}</ref>

In 2013 it was suggested that impacts between rocky and icy surfaces, such as comets, had the potential to create the [[amino acid]]s that make up [[protein]]s through shock synthesis.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ngeo1930 |title=Shock synthesis of amino acids from impacting cometary and icy planet surface analogues |year=2013 |last1=Martins |first1=Zita |last2=Price |first2=Mark C. |last3=Goldman |first3=Nir |last4=Sephton |first4=Mark A. |last5=Burchell |first5=Mark J. |journal=Nature Geoscience}}</ref>

==Nomenclature==
{{main|Naming of comets}}
The names given to comets have followed several different conventions over the past two centuries. Prior to the early 20th century, most comets were simply referred to by the year when they appeared, sometimes with additional adjectives for particularly bright comets; thus, the "[[Great Comet of 1680]]", the "[[Great Comet of 1882]]", and the "[[Great January comet of 1910]]".

[[File:Halley's Comet, 1910.JPG|thumb|Halley's comet, named after the astronomer [[Edmund Halley]] for successfully calculating its orbit. Photo of 1910]]

After [[Edmund Halley]] demonstrated that the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 were the same body and successfully predicted its return in 1759, that comet became known as Halley's comet.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Ridpath |title=Halley and his Comet |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/halley/halley4.htm |work=A brief history of Halley's Comet |date=3 July 2008 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref> Similarly, the second and third known periodic comets, Encke's Comet<ref name="KronkEncke">{{cite web |last=Kronk |first=Gary W. |title=2P/Encke |url=http://cometography.com/pcomets/002p.html |work=Gary W.

Later, periodic comets were usually named after their discoverers, but comets that had appeared only once continued to be referred to by the year of their apparition.<ref name="harvcom"/>

In the early 20th century, the convention of naming comets after their discoverers became common, and this remains so today. A comet can be named its discoverers, or an instrument or program that helped to find it.<ref name="harvcom">{{cite web |url=http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/cometnames.html |title=Comet Names and Designations; Comet Naming and Nomenclature; Names of Comets |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=7 September 2013}}</ref>

==History of study==
{{Main|Observational history of comets}}

===Early observations and thought===
[[File:Tapestry of bayeux10.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Halley's Comet appeared at [[the Battle of Hastings]] in 1066 ([[Bayeux Tapestry]]).]]

From ancient sources, such as Chinese [[oracle bone]]s, it is known that their appearances have been noticed by humans for millennia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/mulu/oracle.html |title=Chinese Oracle Bones |publisher=Cambridge University Library |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref> Until the sixteenth century, comets were usually considered bad [[omen]]s of deaths of kings or noble men, or coming catastrophes, or even interpreted as attacks by heavenly beings against terrestrial inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Ridpath |title=Comet lore |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/halley/halley1.htm |work=A brief history of Halley's Comet |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|p=14}}</ref>

[[Aristotle]] believed that comets were atmospheric phenomena, due to the fact that they could appear outside of the [[Zodiac]] and vary in brightness over the course of a few days.<ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|p=24}}</ref> [[Pliny the Elder]] believed that comets were connected with political unrest and death.<ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|pp=27–28}}</ref>

In the 16th century [[Tycho Brahe]] demonstrated that comets must exist outside the Earth's atmosphere by measuring the [[parallax]] of the [[Great Comet of 1577]] from observations collected by geographically separated observers. Within the precision of the measurements, this implied the comet must be at least four times more distant than from the Earth to the Moon.<ref name="ESO part I">{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Comets I (until 1950) |url=http://www.eso.org/public/events/astro-evt/hale-bopp/comet-history-1.html |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory]] |accessdate=14 August 2013|archiveurl=http://archive.is/OQxt|archivedate=9 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|p=37}}</ref>

[[Isaac Newton]], in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' of 1687, proved that an object moving under the influence of his [[inverse square law]] of [[gravity|universal gravitation]] must trace out an orbit shaped like one of the [[conic section]]s, and he demonstrated how to fit a comet's path through the sky to a parabolic orbit, using the comet of 1680 as an example.<ref>{{cite book |last=Newton |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Newton |chapter=Lib. 3, Prop. 41 |title=[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] |publisher=[[Royal Society of London]] |year=1687 |isbn=0-521-07647-1}}</ref>

In 1705, [[Edmond Halley]] (1656–1742) applied Newton's method to twenty-three cometary apparitions that had occurred between 1337 and 1698. He noted that three of these, the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682, had very similar [[orbital element]]s, and he was further able to account for the slight differences in their orbits in terms of gravitational perturbation by Jupiter and [[Saturn]]. Confident that these three apparitions had been three appearances of the same comet, he predicted that it would appear again in 1758–9.<ref name="Halley">{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstl.1704.0064 |title=Astronomiae Cometicae Synopsis, Autore Edmundo Halleio apud Oxonienses.

Isaac Newton described comets as compact and durable solid bodies moving in oblique orbit and their tails as thin streams of vapor emitted by their nuclei, ignited or heated by the Sun. Newton suspected that comets were the origin of the life-supporting component of air.<ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|pp=306–307}}</ref>

As early as the 18th century, some scientists had made correct hypotheses as to comets' physical composition. In 1755, [[Immanuel Kant]] hypothesized that comets are composed of some volatile substance, whose vaporization gives rise to their brilliant displays near perihelion.<ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|p=85}}</ref> In 1836, the German mathematician [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]], after observing streams of vapor during the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1835, proposed that the [[jet force]]s of evaporating material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet's orbit, and he argued that the non-gravitational movements of Encke's Comet resulted from this phenomenon.<ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|p=126}}</ref>

In 1950, [[Fred Lawrence Whipple]] proposed that rather than being rocky objects containing some ice, comets were icy objects containing some dust and rock.<ref name="Whipple">{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/145272 |title=A comet model.

===Recent findings===
{{See also|List of comets visited by spacecraft}}
Debate continues about how much ice is in a comet. In 2001, the ''[[Deep Space 1]]'' spacecraft obtained high-resolution images of the surface of [[19P/Borrelly|Comet Borrelly]]. It was found that the surface of comet Borrelly is hot and dry, with a temperature of between {{convert|26|to|71|C|F}}, and extremely dark, suggesting that the ice has been removed by solar heating and maturation, or is hidden by the soot-like material that covers Borrelly's.<ref>{{cite web |title=NASA Spacecraft Finds Comet Has Hot, Dry Surface |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/2002/release_2002_80.html |publisher=JPL |date=5 April 2002 |accessdate=22 August 2013}}</ref>

In July 2005, the ''[[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]]'' probe blasted a crater on [[9P/Tempel|Comet Tempel 1]] to study its interior. The mission yielded results suggesting that the majority of a comet's water ice is below the surface and that these reservoirs feed the jets of vaporised water that form the coma of Tempel 1.<ref>{{cite web |title=NASA's 'Deep Impact' Team Reports First Evidence of Cometary Ice |url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2005-06/05-072.html |publisher=Brown University |date=2 February 2006 |accessdate=22 August 2013}}</ref> Renamed [[EPOXI]], it made a flyby of [[103P/Hartley|Comet Hartley 2]] on November 4, 2010.

===Great comets===

Approximately once a decade, a comet becomes bright enough to be noticed by a casual observer, leading such comets to be designated as [[Great Comet]]s.<ref name="great"/> In times past, bright comets often inspired panic and hysteria in the general population, being thought of as bad omens. More recently, during the passage of Halley's Comet in 1910, the Earth passed through the comet's tail, and erroneous newspaper reports inspired a fear that [[cyanogen]] in the tail might poison millions,<ref>{{cite web |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Ridpath |title=Awaiting the Comet |work=A brief history of Halley's Comet |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/halley/halley11.htm |date=3 July 2008 |accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref> whereas the appearance of [[Comet Hale–Bopp]] in 1997 triggered the mass suicide of the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]] cult.<ref>{{cite news |first=B.

The late 20th century saw a lengthy gap without the appearance of any great comets, followed by the arrival of two in quick succession—[[Comet Hyakutake]] in 1996, followed by Hale–Bopp, which reached maximum brightness in 1997 having been discovered two years earlier. The first great comet of the 21st century was [[C/2006 P1]] (McNaught), which became visible to naked eye observers in January 2007. It was the brightest in over 40 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/hubble_discoveries/comet_ison/blogs/great-moments-in-comet-history-comet-mcnaught |title=Great Moments in Comet History: Comet McNaught |publisher=Hubblesite |accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref>

===Sungrazing comets===
{{Main|Sungrazing comet}}
A sungrazing comet is a comet that passes extremely close to the Sun at perihelion, generally within a few million kilometres.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qU95h4yKia4C&pg=PA34 |page=34 |title=Hunting and Imaging Comets |isbn=9781441969057 |last=Mobberley |first=Martin |year=2010}}</ref> Although small sungrazers can be completely evaporated during such a close approach to the [[Sun]], larger sungrazers can survive many perihelion passages. However, the strong [[tidal forces]] they experience often lead to their fragmentation.<ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=1966IrAJ....7..141O |title=Sun-Grazing Comets and Tidal Disruption |last=Opik |first=E. J. |volume=7 |year=1966 |pages=141 |journal=Irish Astronomical Journal}}</ref>

About 90% of the sungrazers observed with [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] are members of the [[Kreutz Sungrazers|Kreutz group]], which all originate from one giant comet that broke up into many smaller comets during its first passage through the inner Solar System.<ref name="Bailey">{{cite journal |last=Hahn |first=M. E. |last2=Chambers |first2=J. E. |last3=Hahn |first3=G. |title=Origin of sungrazers: a frequent cometary end-state |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=257 |issue=1 |pages=315–322 |year=1992 |doi= |bibcode=1992A&A...257..315B}}</ref> The remainder contains some sporadic sungrazers, but four other related groups of comets have been identified among them: the Kracht, Kracht 2a, Marsden, and Meyer groups. The Marsden and Kracht groups both appear to be related to [[96P/Machholz|Comet 96P/Machholz]], which is also the parent of two [[meteor shower|meteor streams]], the [[Quadrantids]] and the [[Arietids]].<ref name="Ohtsuka">{{cite journal |last=Yoshikawa |first=K. |last2=Nakano |first2=S. |last3=Yoshikawa |first3=M. |title=On the Association among Periodic Comet 96P/Machholz, Arietids, the Marsden Comet Group, and the Kracht Comet Group |url=http://pasj.asj.or.jp/v55/n1/550127/55012319.pdf |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=321–324 |year=2003 |doi= |bibcode=2003PASJ...55..321O}}</ref>

===Unusual comets===
:''See also [[#Fate of comets | Fate of comets]].''
Of the thousands of known comets, some exhibit unusual properties. Encke's Comet orbits from outside the asteroid belt to just inside the orbit of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] whereas the Comet 29P/Schwassmann–Wachmann currently travels in a nearly circular orbit entirely between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kronk |first=Gary W. |title=29P/Schwassmann–Wachmann 1 |url=http://cometography.com/pcomets/029p.html |work=Gary W. Kronk's Cometography |accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref> [[2060 Chiron]], whose unstable orbit is between Saturn and [[Uranus]], was originally classified as an asteroid until a faint coma was noticed.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kronk |first=Gary W. |title=95P/Chiron |url=http://cometography.com/pcomets/095p.html |work=Gary W.

==Observation==
A comet may be discovered photographically using a wide-field [[telescope]] or visually with [[binoculars]]. However, even without access to optical equipment, it is still possible for the [[amateur astronomer]] to discover a sungrazing comet online by downloading images accumulated by some satellite observatories such as [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]].<ref name="soho">{{cite web |last=Farmer |first=Steve E. Jr. |title=Getting Started – SOHO Comet Hunting Techniques/Instructions |url=http://www.cometary.net/searching_for_soho_comets.htm |publisher=Red Barn Observatory |accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> SOHO's 2000th comet was discovered by Polish amateur astronomer Michał Kusiak on 26 December 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/hotshots/2010_12_28/ |title=SOHO |date=28 December 2010 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
{{See also|Comets in fiction|Category:Impact events in fiction}}
The depiction of comets in [[popular culture]] is firmly rooted in the long Western tradition of seeing comets as harbingers of doom and as omens of world-altering change.<ref name="Van Riper 29">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JADiKdzkJqsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA27#v=onepage&q&f=false |pages=27–29 |title=Science in Popular Culture: A Reference Guide |isbn=9780313318221 |author1=Bowdoin Van Riper |first1=A |year=2002}}</ref> Halley's Comet alone has caused a slew of sensationalist publications of all sorts at each of its reappearances. It was especially noted that the birth and death of some notable persons coincided with separate appearances of the comet, such as with writers [[Mark Twain]] (who correctly speculated that he'd "go out with the comet" in 1910)<ref name="Van Riper 29" /> and [[Eudora Welty]], to whose life [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] dedicated the song ''[[Halley Came to Jackson]]''.<ref name="Van Riper 29" />

In [[science fiction]], the [[impact event|impact of comets]] has been depicted as a threat overcome by technology and heroism (''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'', 1998), or as a trigger of global apocalypse (''[[Lucifer's Hammer]]'', 1979) or of waves of zombies (''[[Night of the Comet]]'', 1984).<ref name="Van Riper 29" /> In [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Off on a Comet]]'' a group of people are stranded on a comet orbiting the Sun, while a large manned space expedition visits Halley's Comet in Sir [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[2061: Odyssey Three]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-06/books/bk-26609_1_ballantine-books |title=The View From Halley's Comet : 2061: ODYSSEY THREE by Arthur C.
