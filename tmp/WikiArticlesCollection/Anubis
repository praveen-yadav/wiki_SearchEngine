He takes names in connection with his funerary role, such as ''He who is upon his mountain'', which underscores his importance as a protector of the deceased and their tombs, and the title ''He who is in the place of embalming'', associating him with the process of mummification.<ref name=Wilkinson /> Like many ancient [[List of Egyptian gods|Egyptian deities]], Anubis assumes different roles in various contexts. Anubis also attends the [[weighing scale]] in the Afterlife during the "Weighing Of The Heart".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_image.aspx?image=ps343850.jpg&retpage=15522 |title=Papyrus from the Book of the Dead of Ani |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15}}</ref> Anubis' wife is a goddess called [[Anput]]. His daughter is the goddess [[Kebechet]].

==Portrayal==
Anubis was associated with the mummification and protection of the dead for their journey into the afterlife.
He was usually portrayed as a half human – half [[jackal]], or in full jackal form wearing a ribbon and holding a [[flail]] in the crook of its arm.<ref name="Egyptianmyths.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptianmyths.net/anubis.htm |title=Ancient Egypt: the Mythology - Anubis |publisher=Egyptianmyths.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15}}</ref> The jackal [Note: recent genetic studies show that the Egyptian jackal is actually a form of the grey wolf and has thus been renamed the "Egyptian Wolf"<ref name="http://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/anubis-not-egyptian-jackal-but-african.html#.UVdZ_TfNs1c |title=Anubis Not Egyptian Jackal but African Wolf |publisher=archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-26}}</ref>] was strongly associated with cemeteries in ancient Egypt, since it was a scavenger which threatened to uncover human bodies and eat their flesh.<ref name="Freeman, op. cit., p.91">Freeman, op. cit., p.91.</ref> The distinctive black color of Anubis "did not have to do with the jackal [per se] but with the color of rotting flesh and with the black soil of the Nile valley, symbolizing rebirth."<ref name="Freeman, op. cit., p.91"/> The only known depiction of him in fully human form is in the tomb of [[Ramesses II]] in [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]].<ref>[http://www.ancient-egypt.org/index.html Ancient Egypt]</ref>

Anubis is depicted in funerary contexts where he is shown attending to the [[mummies]] of the deceased or sitting atop a tomb protecting it. In fact, during embalming, the "head embalmer" wore an Anubis costume. The critical weighing of the heart scene in the ''[[Book of the Dead]]''  also shows Anubis performing the measurement that determined the worthiness of the deceased to enter the realm of the dead (the [[underworld]], known as ''[[Duat]]''). [[New Kingdom]] tomb-seals also depict Anubis sitting atop the [[nine bows]] that symbolize his domination over the enemies of Egypt.<ref name=Wilkinson />

==Embalmer==
One of the roles of Anubis was "Guardian of the Scales".<ref>{{cite book|last=Faulkner|first=Raymond O.|title=The Egyptian Book of the Dead: The Book of Going Forth by Day|date=Reprint edition (1 April 2008)|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=978-0-8118-6489-3|page=155|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=La9K8fp-BcMC&pg=PA155&dq=anubis+scales#v=onepage&q=anubis%20scales&f=false|coauthors=arol Andrews, James Wasserman}}</ref>  Deciding the weight of "truth" by weighing the heart against [[Ma'at]], who was often depicted as an ostrich feather, Anubis dictated the fate of souls. In this manner, he was a Lord of the Underworld, only usurped by Osiris.

Anubis is a son of [[Ra]] in early myths, but later he became known as son of [[Osiris(mythology)|Osiris]] and [[Nephthys]], and he helped Isis mummify Osiris.<ref name="Freeman, op. cit., p.91"/> Indeed, when the [[Myth of Osiris and Isis]] emerged, it was said that when Osiris had been killed by Set, Osiris' organs were given to Anubis as a gift. With this connection, Anubis became the patron god of embalmers: during the funerary rites of [[mummy|mummification]], illustrations from the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' often show a priest wearing the jackal mask supporting the upright mummy.

==Perceptions outside Egypt==
{{Ancient Egyptian religion}}
In later times, during the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] period, Anubis was merged with the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god [[Hermes]], becoming [[Hermanubis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babylon.com/definition/Hermanubis/English |title=Hermanubis &#124; English &#124; Dictionary & Translation by Babylon |publisher=Babylon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15}}</ref> The centre of this [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] was in ''uten-ha''/''Sa-ka''/ [[Cynopolis]], a place whose Greek name simply means "city of dogs". In Book XI of "[[The Golden Ass]]" by [[Apuleius]], we find evidence that the worship of this god was  maintained in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] at least up to the 2nd century. Indeed, Hermanubis also appears in the [[alchemy|alchemical]] and [[Hermeticism|hermetical]] literature of the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]].

Although the Greeks and [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] typically scorned Egypt's animal-headed gods as bizarre and primitive (Anubis was known to be mockingly called "Barker" by the Greeks), Anubis was sometimes associated with [[Sirius]] in the heavens, and [[Cerberus]] in [[Hades]].  In his dialogues,<ref>e.g. ''Republic'' 399e, 592a</ref> Plato has Socrates utter, "by the dog" (''kai me ton kuna''), "by the dog of Egypt", "by the dog, the god of the Egyptians",<ref>''Gorgias'', 482b</ref> for emphasis.

==Birth==
Usually, Anubis is portrayed as the son of Nephthys and Osiris, Set's brother and Husband of Isis. One myth says that Nephthys got Osiris drunk and the resultant seduction brought forth Anubis. Yet another says she disguised herself as Isis and seduced Osiris and subsequently gave birth to Anubis.<ref name="Egyptianmyths.net"/>

==Weighing of the heart==
The weighing of the heart ceremony was an important factor of the Egyptian mythology. In this ceremony, the heart was weighed by Anubis, against an ostrich feather representing [[Maat]] or truth. If the heart was heavier than the feather the soul would be devoured by [[Ammit]].<ref>http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/young_explorers/discover/museum_explorer/ancient_egypt/death/weighing_the_heart.aspx</ref>

==Misconceptions in popular media==
The 2008 comic documentary [[Religulous]] refers to Anubis, as "Anup the Baptizer" and says that he performed baptisms in Egyptian mythology.  There is no evidence for baptism and it is widely held by [[Egyptologist]]s that Anubis' role was associated with the mummification and protection of the dead for their journey into the afterlife.  Anubis and [[Wepwawet]] (Upuaut) led the deceased to the halls of [[Maat]] where they would be judged. Anubis oversaw the process and ensured that the weighing of the heart was conducted correctly. He then led the innocent on to a heavenly existence and abandoned the guilty to [[Ammit]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_image.aspx?image=ps343850.jpg&retpage=15522 |title=Gods of Ancient Egypt: Anubis |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15}}<!-- Bot generated title --></ref>
