==Biology==
Chives are a [[bulb]]-forming [[herbaceous]] [[perennial plant]], growing to 30–50&nbsp;cm tall. The bulbs are slender, conical, 2–3&nbsp;cm long and 1&nbsp;cm broad, and grow in dense clusters from the [[root]]s. The scapes (or stems) are hollow and tubular, up to 50&nbsp;cm long, and 2–3&nbsp;mm in [[diameter]], with a soft texture, although, prior to the emergence of a flower, they may appear stiffer than usual. The leaves, which are shorter than the scapes, are also hollow and tubular, or terete, (round in cross-section) which distinguishes it at a glance from [[Allium tuberosum|Garlic Chives]]. The [[flower]]s are pale purple, and star-shaped with six [[petal]]s, 1–2&nbsp;cm wide, and produced in a dense [[inflorescence]] of 10-30 together; before opening, the inflorescence is surrounded by a papery [[bract]]. The [[seed]]s are produced in a small three-valved capsule, maturing in summer. The herb flowers from April to May in the southern parts of its habitat zones and in June in the northern parts.<ref>[http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/Plant.asp?code=J270 Allium schoenoprasum factsheet], from Kemper center for home gardening, ''retrieved on June 13, 2006'', based on the position of the botanical Garden (Missouri)</ref><ref>[http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/mono/allia/alliu/allisch.html Gräslök], from Den virtuella floran, ''retrieved on June 13, 2006'', The facts mentioned on the site apply to Sweden, which is in the northern part of the habitat zone.</ref>

Chives are the only species of ''Allium'' native to both the Old World and the [[New World]]. Sometimes, the plants found in North America are classified as ''A. schoenoprasum'' [[variety (botany)|var.]] ''sibiricum'', although this is disputed. Differences among specimens are significant.  One example was found in northern [[Maine]] growing solitary, instead of in clumps, also exhibiting dingy grey flowers.<ref>{{cite book

Although chives are repulsive to insects in general, due to their [[sulfur]] compounds, their flowers attract [[bee]]s, and they are at times kept to increase desired insect life.<ref>Baines. C. Making a Wildlife Garden. 0</ref>

==Uses==
=== Culinary arts ===

Chives are grown for their leaves, which are used for culinary purposes as a flavoring herb, and provide a somewhat milder flavor than those of other ''[[Allium]]'' species.

Chives have a wide variety of culinary uses, such as in traditional dishes in [[France]] and Sweden,<ref name="swe">Försök til en Flora Oeconomica Sveciæ by A. J. Retzius (1806)</ref> among others. In his 1806 book ''Attempt at a Flora'' (''Försök til en flora''), Retzius describes how chives are used with pancakes, soups, fish and sandwiches.<ref name="swe"/> They are also an ingredient of the ''[[sour cream|gräddfil]]'' sauce served with the traditional [[herring]] dish served at Swedish [[midsummer]] celebrations. The flowers may also be used to garnish dishes.<ref>[http://www.mountainvalleygrowers.com/allschoenoprasum.htm Allium schoenoprasum], from Mountain valley growers, ''accessed on June 13, 2006''</ref> In [[Poland]], chives are served with [[Quark (cheese)|quark cheese]].

Chives are one of the "[[fines herbes]]" of French cuisine, which also include [[tarragon]], [[chervil]] and/or [[parsley]].

Chives can be found fresh at most markets year-round, making them readily available; they can also be dry-frozen without much impairment to the taste, giving home growers the opportunity to store large quantities harvested from their own gardens.<ref name="hc"/>

=== Uses in plant cultivation ===
Retzius also describes how farmers would plant chives between the rocks making up the borders of their flowerbeds, to keep the plants free from pests (such as [[Japanese beetle]]s).<ref name="swe"/><ref name="japanese_beetles">[http://www.selfsufficientish.com/pests.htm pests - selfsufficientish - pests<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The growing plant repels unwanted insect life, and the juice of the leaves can be used for the same purpose, as well as fighting [[Fungal phytopathogen|fungal infection]]s, [[mildew]] and [[Fusarium ear blight|scab]].<ref>Holtom. J. and Hylton. W. Complete Guide to Herbs. Rodale Press 1979 ISBN 0-87857-262-7</ref><ref>Riotte. L. Companion Planting for Successful Gardening. Garden Way, Vermont, USA. 1978 ISBN 0-88266-064-0</ref><ref>Huxley. A. The New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. 1992. MacMillan Press 1992 ISBN 0-333-47494-5</ref>

Its flowers are attractive to bees, which are important for gardens with an abundance of plants in need of [[pollination]].

=== Medicine ===
The medicinal properties of chives are similar to those of [[garlic]], but weaker; the faint effects in comparison with garlic are probably the main reason for their limited use as a [[medicinal herb]]. Containing numerous [[organosulfur compound]]s such as [[allyl]] [[sulfide]]s<ref>{{cite book| last = Burdock| first = George A| year = 1996| title = Encyclopedia of Food & Color Additives| publisher = CRC Press| location = Boca Raton| isbn = 0-8493-9412-0| pages = 87, 95–96}}</ref> and [[alkyl]] [[sulfoxide]]s, chives are reported to have a beneficial effect on the [[circulatory system]].<ref name="phd">[http://www.vibrantlife.com/vl/herb-43.html Chive Talkin'], by Winston J. Craig, Ph. D, from Vibrantlife.com, ''accessed on May 31, 2009''{{Dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref> They also have mild [[stimulant]], [[diuretic]], and [[antiseptic]] properties.<ref name="S&S">{{cite book|title=Simon & Schuster's Guide to Herbs and Spices |editor=Stanley Schuler |isbn=0-671-73489-X |author=Gualtiero Simonetti |year=1990 |publisher=Simon & Schuster, Inc}}</ref> As chives are usually served in small amounts and never as the main dish, negative effects are rarely encountered, although [[digestive system|digestive]] problems may occur following overconsumption.{{Dead link|date=May 2013}}<ref name="phd" />

Chives are also rich in [[vitamin A|vitamins A]] and [[Vitamin C|C]],<ref name="sal">[http://www.sallys-place.com/food/columns/gilbert/chives.htm Chives], from "Sally's place", ''accessed on May 31, 2009''</ref> contain trace amounts of sulfur, and are rich in [[calcium]] and [[iron]].{{Dead link|date=December 2012}}<ref>[http://www.organicgardeningpractices.com/garlicchives.php Organic Gardening Practices]. {{Dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref>

==Cultivation==
Chives are cultivated both for their culinary uses and their ornamental value; the violet flowers are often used in ornamental dry bouquets.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1082/is_n3_v40/ai_18339595/pg_2 Flower & Garden Magazine, June-July 1996, The lazy gardener's guide to potpourri]</ref>

Chives thrive in well-drained soil, rich in organic matter, with a [[pH]] of 6-7 and full sun.<ref name="mobot"/>  They can be grown from seed and mature in summer, or early the following spring. Typically, chives need to be [[germination|germinated]] at a temperature of 15 to 20°C (60-70°F) and kept moist. They can also be planted under a [[Row cover|cloche]] or germinated indoors in cooler climates, then planted out later. After at least four weeks, the young shoots should be ready to be planted out. They are also easily propagated by division.<ref name="TBC">{{cite book | last =McGee | first =Rose Marie Nichols  | authorlink = | coauthors = Stuckey, Maggie | title =The Bountiful Container | publisher = Workman Publishing | year = 2002}}</ref>

In cold regions, chives die back to the underground bulbs in winter, with the new leaves appearing in early spring. Chives starting to look old can be cut back to about 2–5&nbsp;cm. When harvesting, the needed number of stalks should be cut to the base.<ref name="TBC"/> During the growing season, the plant will continually regrow leaves, allowing for a continuous harvest.<ref name="TBC"/>

==History and cultural importance==
Chives have been cultivated in Europe since the [[Middle Ages]] (5th until the 15th centuries), although their usage dates back 5000 years.<ref name="hc"/>  They were sometimes referred to as "rush leeks" (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''schoinos'' meaning rush and ''prason'' meaning leek).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The Romans believed chives could relieve the pain from [[sunburn]] or a sore throat. They believed eating chives could increase [[blood pressure]] and act as a [[diuretic]].<ref>{{cite book |title= 75 Exceptional Herbs for Your Garden |last= Staub |first= Jack E. |year= 2008 |publisher= Gibbs Smith |isbn= 978-1-4236-0251-4 |page= 54 }}</ref>

Romanian Gypsies have used chives in fortune telling.<ref name="sal">[http://www.sallys-place.com/food/columns/gilbert/chives.htm Chives], from "Sally's place", ''accessed on June 13, 2006''</ref> It was believed that bunches of dried chives hung around a house would ward off disease and evil.<ref name="sal"/>
