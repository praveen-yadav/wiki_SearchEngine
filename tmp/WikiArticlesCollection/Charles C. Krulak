==Legacy==
General Krulak famously referred to the "Strategic Corporal" and the [[Three Block War]] as two of the key lessons identified from the deployments in [[Somalia]], [[Haiti]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. These concepts are still considered vital in understanding the increasing complexity of modern [[battle]]fields.

General Krulak explained some of his warfighting philosophy in an interview with [[Tom Clancy]] in Clancy's nonfiction book ''[[Marine (book)|Marine]]''. Clancy referred to General Krulak as "Warrior Prince of the Corps".

General Krulak also rewrote the Marine Corps' basic combat study text, ''MCDP-1: Warfighting'', incorporating his theories on operations in the modern battlefield.

As [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], General Krulak had a habit of always taking a few minutes when visiting Marine units to mingle with the junior ranking enlisted Marines, earning him much respect and popularity, but much to the chagrin of his bodyguards who were always supposed to be within an arm's distance of the Commandant.

==Family==
General Krulak is married to Zandi Meyers from Annapolis. They have two sons: David and Todd; and five grandchildren: Brian, Katie, Mary, Matthew and Charles.
He is the son of Lieutenant General [[Victor H. Krulak]], Sr., and the younger brother of Commander Victor H. Krulak Jr, [[United States Navy Chaplain Corps|Navy Chaplain Corps]] and Colonel William Krulak, USMCR.<ref>Coram, Robert (2010). Brute: The Life of Victor Krulak, U.S. Marine. Little, Brown & Co.</ref>
General Krulak stated in an interview that his godfather was Holland M. "Howling Mad" Smith.
