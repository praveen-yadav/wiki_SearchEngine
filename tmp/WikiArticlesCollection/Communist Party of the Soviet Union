The '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ({{lang-ru|Коммунистическая партия Советского Союза}}, ''Kommunisticheskaya partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza''; short: КПСС, ''KPSS'') was the sole governing [[political party]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and one of the largest [[Communist Party|communist organizations]] in the world. The party was [[Constitution of the Soviet Union|constitutionally]] recognised as the leading and guiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of its political system and public organisations.<ref>''[http://www.constitution.org/cons/ussr77.txt Constitution of the Soviet Union]'', 1977, Section I, Chapter 1, Article 6</ref> It lost its legal dominion in the wake of the failure of the 1991 [[August putsch]].  

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union emerged from the Majority ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''[[Bolshevik]]'') faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, the Bolsheviks pushed for [[Communist revolution|socialist revolution]] and the overthrow of the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]]. On 7 November, the Bolsheviks orchestrated the [[October Revolution]] which overthrew the Provisional Government, thus transferring all governing power to the workers' councils ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''[[Soviet (council)|soviets]]''). Immediately thereafter, the Bolsheviks founded the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] - the world's first constitutionally [[socialist state]]. After a bloody [[Russian Civil War|civil war]], at the end of 1922 the Bolsheviks emerged victorious and [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|unified]] territories of the former [[Russian Empire]] into the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR). 

The Party established the Third International, known as the "[[Comintern]]" ("''Communist International''"), an [[Political international|international network]] of [[Communist Party|communist parties]] loyal to the Russian Communist Party, with the aim of fighting "by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and for the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the State."<ref>[http://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/the-communist-threat.html MI5 History], The Inter-War Period</ref> Domestically, given the central role under the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]], the Party controlled all tiers of government and social institutions in the Soviet Union. Its organisation was subdivided into communist parties of the constituent [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republic]]s as well as the mass youth organisation, the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League ([[Komsomol]]) and the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneer organisation]] for children.

After Lenin's death in 1924, an ideological struggle ensued within the Party between [[Leon Trotsky]], who advocated [[permanent revolution]] and emphasis on international intervention, and [[Joseph Stalin]], who advocated [[socialism in one country]] and emphasis on domestic [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|industrialisation]]. Ultimately, by 1930, Trotsky was expelled from the Party and deported from the Soviet Union, leaving Stalin and his supporters in full control of the party and effectively of governing the country. During this time, [[Marxism-Leninism]] became the official ideology of the Party. Later into the 1930s, Stalin initiated the [[Great Purge]], a period of widespread paranoia and repression culminating in a series of [[Moscow Trials|show trials]] and the purging of all [[Old Bolshevik|original Party members]]. With the rise of [[fascism]] in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], the Party actively sought to form "collective security" alliances with western powers. Unable to do so, the USSR [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact|established non-aggressive relations]] with Germany, which were ultimately [[Operation Barbarossa|broken]] in 1941 with Germany invading the Soviet Union, thus beginning the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Great Patriotic War]]. After the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in the war, the Party held a doctrine of establishing pro-Stalin governments in the [[Eastern Bloc|post-war occupied territories]] and of actively seeking to expand the domain of influence, through [[proxy wars]] and [[espionage]].

After Stalin's death in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] rose to power. In 1956, at the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Party Congress]], Khrushchev delivered the "[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]", which denounced the [[Stalin's cult of personality|cult of personality]] around Stalin and the political repression of his regime. Khrushchev initiated a policy of [[de-Stalinisation]], which removed the image of Stalin from public life entirely, terminated the [[GULAG|correctional labour camp system]], and ended the most repressive aspects of the Stalinist system; this period was known as the "[[Khrushchev Thaw]]". The Party maintained Marxism-Leninism as its ideology while rejecting [[Stalinism]], thus splitting the two as distinct ideologies. This would later lead to a [[Sino-Soviet split|disintegration of relations]] with the [[Communist Party of China]] during the 1960s, which under [[Mao]]'s leadership upheld a favourable view of Stalin's legacy. 

Into the late 1980s, under the leadership of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], policies of ''[[glasnost|openness]]'' and ''[[perestroika|restructuring]]'' were implemented, which sought to liberalise the [[Politics of the Soviet Union|political]] and [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economic]] systems of the Soviet Union. Once the Party lost its constitutional status as the sole governing force of country, the Union began to crumble. The party ceased to exist at the All-Union level after the [[August Putsch|coup d'état attempt]] in 1991 and was succeeded by the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] in [[Russian Federation|Russia]] and the communist parties of the now-independent former Soviet republics.

==Structure CPSU==
{{Main|Organization of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}

The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which was held once in 1–5 years, depending on the historical period, with an exception of a long break from 1939 to 1952. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin, the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo.<ref>Kevin McDermott, Stalin: Revolutionary In An Era of War (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006) 41-43.</ref> In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966.

In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress. However, in practice, all executive power was in the hands of the General Secretary and the Politburo.
* [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] of delegates
* [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]]
* [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] (Bureau of Presidium in 1952-53)
* General Secretary of Party

At lower levels the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected "partkom bureau secretary" ("partkom secretary", секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., "partkoms". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) at city level, etc.

The bottom level of the Party was the "primary party organization" (первичная партийная организация) or "party cell" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational [http://www.kpss.web.tr kpss] entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called "party bureau" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected "bureau secretary" (секретарь партбюро).

At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding factory/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an "[[exempt secretary]]" (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
During the 1970s the relative number of communists in Republics of the Soviet Union was as follows:
*Russian SFSR: 7.2%
*Ukraine: 5.35% (1976)
*Moldavia: 3.43% (1975)
*Tajikistan: less than 3%
*The mean value for the Soviet Union was: 5.935% (1974)

===Membership===
[[File:Партийный билет КПСС.1989.jpg|thumb|left|CPSU [[membership card]] (1989)]]

Membership in the Party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of the Party becoming an élite class or ''[[nomenklatura]]'' in Soviet society. The members of the Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Such perks included shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, permission to travel abroad, sending their children to prestigious universities, and obtaining prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing élite without becoming a member of the Communist Party.

Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the leadership under [[Joseph Stalin]] subjected the Party to purges. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member, one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]], and then, at the age of 14, might graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League). Ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. However, membership also had its obligations. The Party expected [[Komsomol]] and CPSU members not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and "social tasks" (общественная работа).

In 1918 Party membership stood at approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the Party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the "Lenin Levy") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This represented both an attempt to "proletarianize" the Party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the Party.

In 1925 the Party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million.<ref>

</ref> In 1927, after an intensive recruitment campaign, membership rose to 1,200,000.<ref>
Organisational report of the Central Committee: Pyatnadtsatyi s"ezd Vesoyuznoi Kommunisticheski Partii-(b), pp. 100-3. This number includes probationary members.</ref>

By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members, but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] of 1936-1939 party membership reduced  to 1.9 million by 1939.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} (Nicholas DeWitt gives 2.307 million members in total in 1939, including candidate members, compared with 1.535 million in 1929 and 6.3 million in 1947.<ref>

In 1986, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, and 12% as collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in 14 of the USSR's 15 republics. The [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] itself had no separate Communist Party until 1990 as the CPSU controlled affairs there directly.

{{Main|History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}

===End of Communist rule===

In 1989, Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.

The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the "State Emergency Committee" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional, but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].

Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its large size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.

In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].

* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was renamed the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]] and abandoned communist ideology.
* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] changed the CPSU branch into the [[People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan|People's Democratic Party]].
* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was banned in 1991. A branch of "progressive" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].
