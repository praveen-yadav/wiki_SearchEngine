The '''Aar''', or '''Aare''' ([[German language|German]] ''Aare''), a [[tributary]] of the [[High Rhine]], is the longest [[river]] that both rises and ends entirely within [[Switzerland]].<ref name=CVDE>Bridgwater, W.; Aldrich, Beatrice (1968)</ref>

Its total length from its source to its junction with the [[Rhine]] comprises about 295<ref name="eb"/> km (183 miles),<ref name=CVDE /> during which distance it descends {{convert|1565|m|ft|abbr=on}}, draining an area of {{convert|17779|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, including the whole of central Switzerland.<ref name="eb">Hoiberg, Dale H. (2010)</ref> There are more than 40 [[hydroelectric plant]]s along the course of the Aare River.<ref name=cohen/>

The Aar rises in the great [[Aar Glaciers]] of the [[Bernese Alps|Bernese]] [[Swiss Alps|Alps]], in the [[canton of Bern]] and west of the [[Grimsel Pass]].<ref name="CVDE"/> The [[Unteraar Glacier]] is the main source for the start, along with the [[Finsteraar Glacier]] and [[Lauteraar Glacier]].<ref name=cohen>Cohen, Saul B. (1998)</ref> It runs east to the Grimsel [[Hostel|Hospice]], below the [[Finsteraarhorn]], and then northwest through the [[Haslital]], forming on the way the magnificent Handegg Waterfall, {{convert|46|m|ft|abbr=on}}, past [[Guttannen]]. Between [[Innertkirchen]] and [[Meiringen]], the river carves through a [[limestone]] ridge in the [[Aar Gorge]] or ''Aareschlucht''.<ref name=CVDE /> 

A little past Meiringen, near [[Brienz]], the river expands into [[Lake Brienz]]. Near the west end of the lake it receives its first important [[tributary]], the [[Lütschine]]. It then runs across the swampy plain of the Bödeli between [[Interlaken]] and [[Unterseen]] before flowing into [[Lake Thun]].<ref name=CVDE />

Near the west end of Lake Thun, the river receives the waters of the [[Kander (Switzerland)|Kander]], which has just been joined by the [[Simme]]. Lake Thun marks the [[head of navigation]].<ref name=cohen/> On flowing out of the lake it passes through [[Thun]], and then flows through the city of [[Bern]], passing beneath [[List of Aar bridges in Berne|eighteen bridges]] and around the steeply-flanked peninsula on which the [[Old City of Berne|Old City]] is located. The river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction, but after receiving the [[Saane/Sarine|Saane or Sarine]] it turns north until it nears [[Aarberg]]. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the 19th century, the [[Jura water correction]], the river, which had previously rendered the countryside north of Bern a [[swampland]] through frequent flooding, was diverted by the [[Hagneck Canal]] into the [[Lake of Bienne]]. From the upper end of the lake the river issues through the [[Nidau-Büren channel]] and then runs east to [[Büren, Solothurn|Büren]]. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the Alps, and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the "vegetable garden of Switzerland".

From here the Aar flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town [[Solothurn]]<ref name=CVDE /> (below which the Grosse [[Emme (river)|Emme]] flows in on the right), Aarburg (where it is joined by the Wigger), [[Olten]], [[Aarau]],<ref name=CVDE /> near which is the junction with the [[Suhre]], and Wildegg, where the Hallwiler Aa falls in on the right. A short distance further, below [[Brugg]] it receives first the [[Reuss (river)|Reuss]], and shortly afterwards the [[Limmat]]. It now turns due north, and soon becomes itself a tributary of the [[Rhine]], which it surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite at [[Koblenz, Switzerland|Koblenz]] (Switzerland), opposite [[Waldshut-Tiengen|Waldshut]], Germany.  The Rhine, in turn, empties into the [[North Sea]] after crossing into the [[Netherlands]].
