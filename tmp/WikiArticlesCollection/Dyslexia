'''Dyslexia''' is characterized by difficulty with learning to read fluently and with accurate comprehension despite normal, or above normal intelligence.<ref> Yet reading difficulty is optional. (http://www.dyslexia.com/library/symptoms.htm) A child or an adult may have trouble spelling, writing, articulating, OR reading.

Internationally, dyslexia has no single definition; more than 70 names are used to describe its manifestations, characterizations or causes.<ref name=Davis1 />{{rp|7-8}} The World Federation of Neurology defines dyslexia as "a disorder manifested by difficulty in learning to read despite conventional instruction, adequate intelligence and sociocultural opportunity".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avko.org/Info/dyslexia/what_is_dyslexia.htm |title=What Is Dyslexia? |publisher=AVKO Education Research Foundation |date= |accessdate=5 July 2010}}</ref> The [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] definition also adds, "difficulty with spelling, phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), and/or rapid visual-verbal responding."<ref name="ninds1"/> Many published definitions from researchers and organizations around the world are purely descriptive or embody causal theories.

===Neuroanatomy===
In the area of [[neurological research into dyslexia]], modern [[neuroimaging]] techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] ([[fMRI]]) and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) have produced a correlation between functional and structural differences in the brains of children and reading difficulties. Some individuals with dyslexia show less electrical activation in parts of the left hemisphere of the brain involved in reading, which includes the [[inferior frontal gyrus]], [[inferior parietal lobule]], and middle and [[Brodmann area 20|ventral temporal cortex]].<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Cao F, Bitan T, Chou TL, Burman DD, Booth JR |title=Deficient orthographic and phonological representations in children with dyslexia revealed by brain activation patterns |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=1041–50 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17073983 |pmc=2617739 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01684.x}}</ref>

Brain activation studies using PET to study language have produced a breakthrough in understanding of the neural basis of language over the past decade.

As the environment plays a large role in learning and memory, it is likely that [[epigenetic]] modifications play an important role in reading ability. [[Animal models]] and measures of [[gene expression]] and [[methylation]] in the human periphery are used to study epigenetic processes, both of which have limitations in extrapolating to the human brain.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Roth |first=TL |coauthors=Roth ED, Sweatt JD |title=Epigenetic regulation of genes in learning and memory |journal=Essays Biochem |date=September 2010 |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=263–74 |pmid=20822498 |doi=10.1042/bse0480263}}</ref>

==Effect of language orthography==
{{Main|Orthographies and dyslexia}}
The complexity of a language's orthography (i.e., its conventional spelling system, see [[orthographic depth]]) has a direct impact upon how difficult it is to learn to read that language. English has a comparatively deep orthography within the [[Latin alphabet]] [[writing system]], with a complex orthographic structure that employs spelling patterns at several levels: principally, letter-sound correspondences, syllables, and morphemes. Other languages, such as Spanish, have mostly alphabetic orthographies that employ letter-sound correspondences, so-called [[Phonemic orthography|shallow orthographies]]. It is relatively easy to learn to read languages like Spanish; it is much more difficult to learn to read languages with more complex orthographies such as English.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Henry |first=Marcia K. |year=2005 |chapter=The history and structure of the English language |editor=Judith R.

From a neurological perspective, different types of writing systems (e.g., alphabetic as compared to logographic writing systems) require different neurological pathways in order to read, write, and spell. Because different writing systems require different parts of the brain to process the visual notation of speech, children with reading problems in one language might not have one in a language with another orthography. The neurological skills required to perform the tasks of reading, writing, and spelling can vary between writing systems. As a result, different neurological deficits can cause dyslexic problems in relation to different orthographies.<ref name=kana/><ref name=lang/><ref name='Wydell'/>

For [[dyslexia intervention]] with alphabet writing systems, the fundamental aim is to increase a child's awareness of correspondences between [[grapheme]]s (letters) and [[phoneme]]s (sounds), and to relate these to reading and spelling by teaching him or her to blend the sounds into words. It has been found that training focused towards visual language (reading) and [[orthography|orthographic]] (spelling) yields longer-lasting gains than mere oral phonological training.<ref name=Lyytinen>{{Cite book

==History==
{{Main|History of developmental dyslexia}}
Dyslexia was identified by [[Oswald Berkhan]] in 1881,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Berkhan O |year=1917 |title=Uber die Wortblindheit, ein Stammeln im Sprechen und Schreiben, ein Fehl im Lesen |journal=Neurologisches Centralblatt |volume=36|pages = 914–927|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=pt-BR&id=DmEsAQAAIAAJ&dq=editions%3AUCALB3248710&q=Wortblindheit#search_anchor}}</ref> but the term ''dyslexia'' was coined in 1887 by [[Rudolf Berlin]], who was an [[ophthalmologist]] in [[Stuttgart]].<ref>{{Cite journal

|doi=10.1007/BF02653841}}</ref> He used the term to refer to a case of a young boy who had a severe impairment in learning to read and write in spite of showing typical intellectual and physical abilities in all other respects.

In 1896 W. Pringle Morgan, a British physician from [[Seaford, East Sussex]], published a description of a reading-specific learning disorder in a report to the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' titled "Congenital Word Blindness".

==Alternative compensating skills and abilities==
Ronald Davis's book ''The Gift of Dyslexia'' presents dyslexia with a unique viewpoint and states that "dyslexia is an unintentionally self-created condition ... [and] is the result of a perceptual talent... in some situations, the talent becomes a liability."<ref name=davis1>{{cite web | url=http://www.dyslexia.com//library/gift-chapter-one.htm | title=The Gift of Dyslexia: Chapter One | publisher=Perigee Trade | date=2010 | accessdate=29 October 2013 | author=Davis, Ronald}}</ref> Upon looking at a [[list of people diagnosed with dyslexia]], important historical figures have had dyslexia or succeeded because of dyslexia. Davis explains that the nonverbal picture thinking mode is superior to verbal thinking which is limited by the brain's ability to process and think auditorially.<ref name=davis1 />{{rp|100}} Davis explains that the adage of a "picture is worth a thousand words" to describe Einstein's daydream which spawned his theory of [[general relativity]] as simple because of his visual thought process.<ref name=davis1 />{{rp|100}}
