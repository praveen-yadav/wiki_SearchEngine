== Early life and career ==
Barış Manço was born in [[Üsküdar]], [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] on January 2, 1943. His mother, [[Rikkat Uyanık]], was a famous singer in early 1940s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} His older brother, who was born during [[World War II]], was named Savaş{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} ("war" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) while he was named Barış ("peace" in Turkish) by his parents to celebrate the end of the war.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} At birth, he was additionally named Tosun Yusuf after his deceased uncle Yusuf called Tosun (literally: Yusuf The Sturdy). However, this name was erased just before he attended the primary school.<ref name="h1"/>

In primary school his head was shaven to prevent [[head lice]], a serious threat back then, which he cited among reasons for his later signature long hair.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

During his highschool days in [[Galatasaray High School]] (and later in Şişli Terakki High School) he formed his first band, '''Kafadarlar''' ("The Buddies"), allegedly upon seeing [[Erkin Koray]]'s band performing, all students of [[Deutsche Schule Istanbul]] (''İstanbul Alman Lisesi''), a nearby highschool.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} '''Asaf Savaş Akat''', a famous economist in Turkey, played [[saxophone]],{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} and [[guitarist]] '''Ender Enön''' made his own guitar because it was difficult to find a real one on the market in those years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In 1962 and 1963, with his next band, '''Harmoniler''' ("The Harmonies"), he recorded cover versions of some of popular American [[Twist (dance)|twist]] songs and rearrangements of Turkish folk songs in [[rock and roll]] form, marking the beginning of the [[Anatolian rock]] movement,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} a synthesis of [[Turkish folk music]] and [[rock music|rock]]. In this period, his key visual and musical influence was [[Elvis Presley]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

After graduating from high school in 1963, he moved to Europe, travelling around [[Paris]] and [[Liège (city)|Liège]], where he formed bands with local musicians and recorded some singles mainly in English and in French but also in Turkish. He toured with his band '''Les Mistigris''' (not related to [[Mistigris]]) in [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[France]] and [[Turkey]] until 1967.

In 1967, he suffered a serious car accident,{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} after which he started to grow his signature mustache to disguise his scar.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Frustrated by the difficulties of working with musicians from different nationalities, he formed '''Kaygısızlar''' (The Carefrees), featuring [[Mazhar Alanson]] and [[Fuat Güner]], future members of the band [[MFÖ]]. He recorded several singles and toured with the band, both domestically and internationally, until the band members revealed that they did not want to live abroad.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In 1970, he formed '''Barış Manço Ve ...''' ("Barış Manço and ...") again with foreign musicians, to record his first hit single, both in Turkey and in Belgium, ''Dağlar Dağlar'' (Mountains, Mountains!), selling over 700,000 copies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Today, the song remains one of his most popular works.

== 1970s ==
After the success of "Dağlar Dağlar", Manço recorded a couple of singles with [[Moğollar]] (The Mongols), another influential Turkish Anatolian rock band. He then decided to return to Turkey where he recorded with the reformed Kaygısızlar for a short period. In 1971, his early works were compiled under his first full length album ''Dünden Bugüne'', today commonly referred as ''Dağlar Dağlar''.

In 1972, he formed [[Kurtalan Ekspres]], a legend by itself, the band that would accompany him until his death. In 1975 until when he continued to release singles, he released his first non-compilation LP ''2023'', a [[concept album]] that includes many instrumental songs.

As a last attempt to reach international success, he released the LP titled ''Baris Mancho'' (1976), a strange transcription of his name, mostly with '''George Hayes Orchestra''' under [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] label, in Europe and South Africa. Although the album did not bring the fame he was expecting, it did reach the top of the charts in [[Romania]] and [[Morocco]]. Next year, the album was released in Turkey under the title ''Nick the Chopper''.

From 1977 to 1980, he released three more albums in Turkey, partly consisting of compilations of older singles, namely ''Sakla Samanı Gelir Zamanı'' (1977), ''Yeni Bir Gün'' (1979) and ''20. Sanat Yılı Disko Manço'' (1980), all following a similar sound with ''2023''. All these albums are now rarity items, but most of the material from the era are available in later compilations ''Ben Bilirim'' and ''Sarı Çizmeli Mehmet Ağa''.

== 1980s ==
In 1981, Manço released ''Sözüm Meclisten Dışarı'' with Kurtalan Ekspres, containing many hit songs including "Alla Beni Pulla Beni", "Arkadaşım Eşşek", "Gülpembe", "Halhal" and "Dönence" among others. The album remains as one of their most popular works and launched a boost of popularity for Barış Manço during 1980s.

"Arkadaşım Eşşek" ("My Friend Donkey"), quickly grew very popular among children (the song is about rural nostalgia and was not initially intended as a children's song){{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Throughout his career, he went on to write many other songs primarily for children to achieve an iconic acceptance among Turkish children of 1980s and 1990s.

On the other hand "Gülpembe", composed by Kurtalan Ekspres bassist [[Ahmet Güvenç]], a requiem for Manço's grandmother, caught older audiences and probably is the artist's most popular song, competing perhaps only with "Dağlar Dağlar".

In 1983, ''Estağfurullah, Ne Haddimize'' was released. It contained hit songs "Halil İbrahim Sofrası" and "Kol Düğmeleri", a new version of the artist's very first song. "Halil İbrahim Sofrası" exemplified Manço's signature moral themed lyrics, a rare feature in [[Turkish pop music]].

In 1985, ''24 Ayar Manço'' which included "Gibi Gibi" and a long conceptual song "Lahburger" was released. It also marked the beginning of the shift in Manço's sound characterized with the heavy use of [[synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]] in contrast with his older works consisting of a group oriented rock based sound. In subsequent years, Manço released ''Değmesin Yağlı Boya'' (1986), ''Sahibinden İhtiyaçtan'' (1988) and ''Darısı Başınıza'' (1989), all containing a couple of hit songs and demonstrating his new sound.

== 7'den 77'ye and 1990s ==

[[File:Barış Manço museum01.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Barış Manço Museum]]]]

In 1988, ''7'den 77'ye'' (''From age 7 to 77''), a TV show directed and presented by Manço began to run on [[TRT 1]], the national TV channel of Turkey. It was a combined music, talk show and documentary program which was a major hit during the 8 years it stayed on air. Manço travelled almost 150 countries for the show. "Adam Olacak Çocuk", a part of the show, strengthened Manço's acceptance among children.

Although his popularity continued mostly due to the TV show, his musical works in 1990s were not well received. The albums ''Mega Manço'' (1992) and ''Müsadenizle Çocuklar'' (1995) were considered as the weakest efforts of his career, despite the limited success of 1992 children hit "Ayı" (The Bear). On the other hand, in 1995 he toured in [[Japan]] with Kurtalan Ekspres, leading to ''Live In Japan'' (1996), his first and only live album. He released two albums in that country with some recognition as "the man who writes songs about vegetables", referring to "Domates, Biber, Patlıcan" ("Tomato, Pepper, Aubergine") and "Nane, Limon Kabuğu" (Mint, Lemon Rind), two of his hit songs from 1980s.

== Death ==
On January 31, 1999, Barış Manço died of a sudden heart attack before the release of his just finished last work ''Mançoloji'' (''Mançology'' or ''Manchology'') (1999), a double album containing the new recordings of his hit songs along with an unfinished instrumental song "40. Yıl" ("The 40th Anniversary"), celebrating his 40th year in music. His sudden death caused an almost unanimous shock in Turkey with millions of people mourning and tens of thousands of people attending his funeral.

== Legacy ==
Barış Manço was one of the most influential Turkish musicians. In his early career he and his bands contributed to the [[Turkish rock]] movement by combining traditional Turkish music with [[rock music|rock]] influences, which is still one of the main trends of Turkish popular music.

His visual image, characterized by his long hair, mustache and big rings, softened the reaction of the otherwise conservative Turkish public opinion.

His experimentation with electronic instruments in the late 1980s contributed to the 1990s sound of Turkish popular music.

His lyrics with diverse themes, mostly following a somewhat modernized version of the "aşık" (wandering folk poets) tradition were heavily marginal in the popular music scene of 1980s which was mostly dominated by love-themed lyrics.

In 2002, a tribute album was released under the name ''Yüreğimdeki Barış Şarkıları'' ("Peace Songs In My Heart"), featuring 15 extremely popular Turkish artists of such diverse genres as [[arabesque music|arabesque]], pop and rock (both Anatolian and western style) demonstrating his wide range of influence.
