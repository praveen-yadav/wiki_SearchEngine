'''Albinism''' (from [[Latin]] ''albus'', "white"; ''see [[wikt:albino|extended etymology]]'', also called '''achromia''', '''achromasia''', or '''achromatosis''') is a [[congenital disorder]] characterized by the complete or partial absence of [[Biological pigment|pigment]] in the skin, hair and eyes due to absence or defect of [[tyrosinase]], a copper-containing enzyme involved in the production of [[melanin]]. Albinism results from inheritance of [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive gene]] [[alleles]] and is known to affect all [[vertebrate]]s, including [[humans]]. While an organism with complete absence of melanin is called an '''albino''' ({{IPAc-en|us|æ|l|ˈ|b|aɪ|n|oʊ}},<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/albino "Albino"] Dictionary.com. Accessed May 11, 2011</ref> or {{IPAc-en|uk|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|n|oʊ}})<ref>[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/pronunciation/british/albino "Pronunciation of albino"] Macmillan Dictionary. Accessed May 11, 2011</ref> an organism with only a diminished amount of melanin is described as '''albinoid'''.<ref name="Tietz">Tietz, W. A Syndrome of Deaf-Mutism Associated with Albinism Showing Dominant Autosomal Inheritance. Department of Pediatrics, Southern California.</ref>

Albinism is associated with a number of vision defects, such as [[photophobia]], [[nystagmus]] and [[astigmatism]]. Lack of skin pigmentation makes for more susceptibility to sunburn and skin cancers. In rare cases such as [[Chédiak–Higashi syndrome]], albinism may be associated with deficiencies in the transportation of melanin granules. This also affects essential granules present in immune cells leading to increased susceptibility to infection.<ref>{{cite PMID|18043242}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Albinistic girl papua new guinea.jpg|thumb|left|287px|Albinistic girl from [[Papua New Guinea]]]]

In humans, there are two principal types of albinism, [[Oculocutaneous albinism|oculocutaneous]], affecting the eyes, skin and hair, and [[Ocular albinism|ocular]] affecting the eyes only.

Most people with oculocutaenous albinism appear white or very pale as the melanin pigments responsible for brown, black, and some yellow colorations are not present. Ocular albinism results in pale blue eyes, and may require genetic testing to diagnose.

Because individuals with albinism have skin that entirely lacks the dark pigment melanin, which helps protect the skin from the sun's [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]], their skin can [[sunburn|burn]] more easily from overexposure.<ref name="Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis">{{cite book |author=Chen, Harold |title=Atlas of genetic diagnosis and counseling |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=2006 |pages=37–40 |isbn=1-58829-681-4 |oclc= |doi= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=2VcdAXJ_dZkC&pg=PA36&dq=Albinism&q=Albinism|accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>

The human eye normally produces enough pigment to color the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] blue, green or brown and lend opacity to the eye. However, there are cases in which the eyes of an albinistic person appear red, pink or purple, depending on the amount of pigment present, due to the red of [[retina]] being visible through the iris. Lack of pigment in the eyes also results in problems with vision, both related and unrelated to [[photosensitivity]].

Those afflicted with albinism are generally as healthy as the rest of the population (but see related disorders below), with growth and development occurring as normal, and albinism by itself does not cause mortality,<ref name="eMedicine1" /> although the lack of pigment blocking [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]] increases the risk of melanomas (skins cancers) and other problems.

===Visual problems===
[[Image:Mali Salif Keita2 400.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Mali]]an singer [[Salif Keita]]]]
Development of the optical system is highly dependent on the presence of melanin, and the reduction or absence of this pigment in albinistic individuals may lead to
* Misrouting of the retinogeniculate projections, resulting in abnormal [[decussation]] (crossing) of optic nerve fibres<ref name="Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis"/>
* [[Photophobia]] and decreased [[visual acuity]] due to light scattering within the eye ([[ocular straylight]])<ref name="Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis"/><ref>Kruijt B et al. "Ocular straylight in albinism". ''Optom Vis Sc'' 2011;88:E585-E592</ref>
* Reduced visual acuity due to [[Macular hypoplasia|foveal hypoplasia]] and possibly light-induced [[retina]]l damage<ref name="Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis"/>

Eye conditions common in albinism include:
* [[Nystagmus]], irregular rapid movement of the eyes back and forth, or in circular motion.<ref name="Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis"/>
* [[Astigmatism (eye)|Astigmatism]], irregular shaped cornea requiring additional cylindrical corrective lenses in spectacles.<ref name="Albinism_Diagnosis">{{cite journal |author=Carden SM, Boissy RE, Schoettker PJ, Good WV |title=Albinism: modern molecular diagnosis |journal=The British Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=189–95 |year=1998 |month=February |pmid=9613388 |pmc=1722467 |doi=10.1136/bjo.82.2.189 }}</ref>
* [[Amblyopia]], decrease in acuity of one or both eyes due to poor transmission to the brain, often due to other conditions such as [[strabismus]].<ref name="Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis"/>
* [[Optic nerve hypoplasia]], underdevelopment of the optic nerve

Some of the visual problems associated with albinism arise from a poorly developed [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE) due to the lack of melanin.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This degenerate RPE causes foveal hypoplasia (a failure in the development of normal [[fovea]]e), which results in eccentric fixation and lower visual acuity, and often a minor level of strabismus.

The [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a [[sphincter]] formed from pigmented tissue that contracts when the eye is exposed to bright light, to protect the [[retina]] by limiting the amount of light passing through the pupil. In low light conditions the iris relaxes to allow more light to enter the eye. In albinistic subjects, the iris does not have enough pigment to block the light, thus the decrease in pupil diameter is only partially successful in reducing the amount of light entering the eye.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Additionally, the improper development of the RPE, which in normal eyes absorbs most of the reflected sunlight, further increases glare due to light scattering within the eye.<ref name="Optometry_Albinism">[http://www.revoptom.com/HANDBOOK/SECT58a.HTM "Albinism—Review of Optometry Online"].</ref> The resulting sensitivity (photophobia) generally leads to discomfort in bright light, but this can be reduced by the use of sunglasses and/or brimmed hats.<ref name="Facts_Albinism">[http://albinism.med.umn.edu/facts.htm "Facts about Albinism"], by Dr. Richard King et al.</ref>

==Genetics==
Occulocutaenous albinism is generally the result of the [[biological inheritance]] of [[dominance relationship|genetically recessive]] [[allele]]s ([[gene]]s) passed from both parents of an individual, though some rare forms are inherited from only one parent. There are other [[genetic mutation]]s which are proven to be associated with albinism. All alterations, however, lead to changes in melanin production in the body.<ref name="eMedicine1">[http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic12.htm "Albinism"], by Dr. Raymond E. Boissy, Dr. James J. Nordlund, et al., at [[eMedicine]], 22 August 2005. Retrieved 31 March 2007.</ref><ref name="OMIM1">[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&DB=omim&term=albinism Online ''Mendelian Inheritance in Man''], at [[Johns Hopkins University]] (see also [[Mendelian Inheritance in Man]] for more information about this source).</ref>

The chance of offspring with albinism resulting from the pairing of an organism with albinism and one without albinism is low. However, because organisms (including humans) can be carriers of genes for albinism without exhibiting any traits, albinistic offspring can be produced by two non-albinistic parents. Albinism usually occurs with equal frequency in both sexes.<ref name="eMedicine1" /> An exception to this is ocular albinism, which it is passed on to offspring through X-linked inheritance. Thus, ocular albinism occurs more frequently in males as they have a single X and Y chromosome, unlike females, whose genetics are characterized by two X&nbsp;chromosomes.<ref name="Sex-linked_recessive">[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002051.htm "Sex-linked recessive"], by Chad Haldeman-Englert, MD, Division of Human Genetics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA</ref>

There are two different forms of albinism: a partial lack of the melanin is known as hypomelanism, or hypomelanosis and the total absence of melanin is known as [[amelanism]] or amelanosis.

==Diagnosis==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2007}}
[[Genetic testing]] can confirm albinism and what variety it is, but offers no medical benefits except in the cases of non-OCA disorders (see below) that cause albinism ''along with'' other medical problems which may be treatable. The ''symptoms'' of albinism can be treated by various methods detailed below.

==Treatment==
For the most part, treatment of the eye conditions consists of visual rehabilitation. Surgery is possible on the ocular muscles to decrease nystagmus, [[strabismus]] and common refractive errors like [[astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]].<ref name="Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis"/> Nystagmus-damping surgery can also be performed, to reduce the "shaking" of the eyes back and forth.<ref name="Surgical management of nystagmus">{{cite journal |author=Lee J |title=Surgical management of nystagmus |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=95 |issue=5 |pages=238–41 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=11983764 |pmc=1279676 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.5.238}}</ref> The effectiveness of all these procedures varies greatly and depends on individual circumstances.

[[Glasses]] and other vision aids, [[large-print]] materials as well as bright but angled reading lights, can help individuals with albinism, even though their vision cannot be corrected completely. Some people with albinism do well using [[bifocals]] (with a strong reading lens), prescription reading glasses, and/or hand-held devices such as [[Magnifying glass|magnifiers]] or [[monocular]]s.<ref name="Facts_Albinism">{{cite web |url=http://albinism.med.umn.edu/facts.htm |title=Facts about Albinism |first=Richard |last=King}}</ref> [[Contact lenses]] may be colored to block light transmission through the <!--commenting out unexplained term for now: aniridic-->iris. But in the case of nystagmus this is not possible, due to the irritation that is caused by the movement of the eyes. Some use [[bioptics (device)|bioptics]], glasses which have small telescopes mounted on, in, or behind their regular lenses, so that they can look through either the regular lens or the telescope. Newer designs of bioptics use smaller light-weight lenses. Some US states allow the use of bioptic telescopes for driving motor vehicles. (See also [[National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation|NOAH]] bulletin "Low Vision Aids".)

===Epidemiology===
Albinism affects people of all ethnic backgrounds; its frequency worldwide is estimated to be approximately one in 17,000. Prevalence of the different forms of albinism varies considerably by population, and is highest overall in people of sub-Saharan African descent.<ref name="Oculocutaneous albinism">{{cite journal |author=Gronskov K, Ek J, Brondum-Nielsen K |title=Oculocutaneous albinism |journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases |date=2 November 2007 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-2-43 |pmc=2211462 |pmid=17980020 |volume=2 |pages=43}}</ref>

{{Main|Persecution of people with albinism|Albinism in popular culture}}
In physical terms, humans with albinism commonly have visual problems and need sun protection. They often face social and cultural challenges (even threats), as the condition is often a source of ridicule, discrimination, or even fear and violence. Many cultures around the world have developed beliefs regarding people with albinism.

In African countries such as [[Tanzania]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7518049.stm |title=Africa &#124; Living in fear: Tanzania's albinos |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-07-21 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}</ref> and [[Burundi]],<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11614957 | work=BBC News | title=Burundi albino boy 'dismembered' | date=24 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8057956.stm |title=Africa &#124; Burundian albino murders denied |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-05-19 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}</ref> there has been an unprecedented rise in [[witchcraft]]-related killings of albino people in recent years, because their body parts are used in potions sold by [[witchdoctor]]s.

Another harmful and false belief is that sex with an albinistic woman will cure a man of [[HIV]]. This has led, for example in [[Zimbabwe]], to rapes (and subsequent HIV infection).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=14122|title=RIGHTS-ZIMBABWE: The Last Minority Group to Find a Voice|last=Machipisa|first=Lewis |work=Inter Press Service News Agency|publisher=IPS-Inter Press Service|accessdate=30 January 2010}}</ref>

Certain ethnic groups and insular areas exhibit heightened susceptibility to albinism, presumably due to genetic factors. These include notably the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] and [[Zuni people|Zuni]] nations (respectively of [[Panama]] and [[New Mexico]]); [[Japan]], in which one particular form of albinism is unusually common; and [[Ukerewe Island]], the population of which shows a very high incidence of albinism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southern-africas-children.org.uk/ukerewe-albino.html|title=Ukerewe Albino Society|last=Anon|year=2009|work=southern-africas-children.org.uk/|publisher=Southern Africas Children|accessdate=21 July 2010}}</ref>

Famous people with albinism include historical figures such as [[Oxford University|Oxford]] don [[William Archibald Spooner]]; actor-comedian [[Victor Varnado]]; musicians such as [[Johnny Winter|Johnny]] and [[Edgar Winter]], [[Salif Keita]], [[Yellowman|Winston "Yellowman" Foster]], [[Brother Ali]], [[Sivuca]], [[Piano Red|Willie "Piano Red" Perryman]]; and fashion models [[Connie Chiu]] and [[Shaun Ross (model)|Shaun Ross]].

==In animals==

[[File:Albino Gator.jpg|thumb|An albino alligator at the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA]]
Many animals with albinism lack their protective [[camouflage]] and are unable to conceal themselves from their predators or prey; the survival rate of animals with albinism in the wild is usually quite low.<ref name="survival1">Ilo Hiler, Albinos. ''Young Naturalist''. The Louise Lindsey Merrick Texas Environment Series, No. 6, pp. 28–31. Texas A&M University Press, College Station (1983)</ref><ref name="survival2">{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1439-0426.2000.00147.x |first1=ByS |last1=Dobosz |first2=K. |last2=Kohlmann |first3=K. |last3=Goryczko |first4=H. |last4=Kuzminski |month=July |year=2008 |title=Growth and vitality in yellow forms of rainbow trout |journal=Journal of Applied Ichthyology |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=117–20}}</ref> However the novelty of albino animals has occasionally led to their protection by groups such as the [[Albino Squirrel Preservation Society]].

In what used to be called "partial albinism" but is more often termed [[leucism]] there can be a single patch or patches of skin that lack melanin. Especially in [[albinism in birds|albinistic birds]] and reptiles, ruddy and yellow hues or other colors may be present on the entire body or in patches (as is common among pigeons), because of the presence of other pigments unaffected by albinism such as [[porphyrin]]s, [[pteridine]]s and psittacins, as well as [[carotenoid]] pigments derived from the diet.

Intentionally bred albinistic strains of some animal species are commonly used as [[model organism]]s in biomedical study and experimentation, although some researchers have argued that they are not always the best choice.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Creel D |title=Inappropriate use of albino animals as models in research |journal=Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=969–7 |year=1980 |month=June |pmid=7403210 |doi=10.1016/0091-3057(80)90461-X}}</ref> Examples include the [[BALB/c]] mouse and [[Wistar rat|Wistar]] and [[Sprague Dawley rat]] strains, while albino rabbits were historically used for [[Draize test|Draize toxicity testing]].<ref name="Draize">{{Cite journal | author = Draize, J.H., Woodard, G. and Calvery, H.O. | year = 1944 | title = Methods for the study of irritation and toxicity of substances applied topically to the skin and mucous membranes | url =  | journal = J. Pharmacol. and Exp. Therapeutics. | volume = 82 | issue =  | pages = 377–390 }}</ref> The ''yellow'' mutation in [[Drosophila|fruit flies]] is their version of albinism.

The incidence of albinism can be artificially increased in fish by exposing the eggs to [[heavy metals]] (arsenic, cadmium, copper, mercury, selenium, zinc).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S1679-62252005000100009 |title=An albino armored catfish Schizolecis guntheri (Siluriformes: Loricariidae) from an Atlantic Forest coastal basin |year=2005 |last1=Brito |first1=Marcelo F.

The eyes of an albino animal appear red because the colour of the red blood cells in the underlying retinal blood vessels shows through where there is no pigment to obscure it.

Famous albino animals include [[Migaloo]], a [[humpback whale]] off the coast of Australia; [[Pinky (dolphin)|Pinky]], a [[bottlenose dolphin]] living in and around in [[Calcasieu Lake]], Louisiana; [[Snowflake (albino gorilla)|Snowflake]], a [[Barcelona Zoo]] [[gorilla]]; [[Snowflake (penguin)|Snowflake]], a [[Bristol Zoo]] [[penguin]]; and [[Mahpiya Ska]] ([[Sioux]] for "White Cloud"), a [[American Bison|buffalo]] in [[Jamestown, North Dakota]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,287938,00.html |title=Rare Pink Dolphin Seen in Louisiana Lake – Science News &#124; Science & Technology &#124; Technology News |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2007-07-03 |accessdate=27 February 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100224154728/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,287938,00.html| archivedate= 24 February 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The inspiration for [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' was a [[sperm whale]] known as [[Mocha Dick]].

==Related pigment disorders==
In some animals, albinism-like conditions may affect other pigments or pigment-production mechanisms:
* "Whiteface," a condition that affects some parrot species, is caused by a lack of psittacins.<ref name="Hesford">[http://www.birdhobbyist.com/parrotcolour/parblu04.html "The Parblue Puzzle: Part 4—Common Parblue Varieties: The Cockatiel &#91;''Nymphicus hollandicus''&#93;"] by Clive Hesford, ''The Genetics of Colour in the Budgerigar and Other Parrots'', January 1998</ref>
* [[Axanthism]] is a condition common in reptiles and amphibians, in which [[xanthophore#Xanthophores and erythrophores|xanthophore]] [[metabolism]] is affected rather than [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of melanin, resulting in reduction or absence of red and yellow pteridine pigments.<ref name="ABPC">[http://www.livingunderworld.org/biology/caudata/ "Amphibian Biology & Physiology: ''Caudata''"] at ''Amphibian Information Resource: An Educational Web Project About Amphibian Species''; sourced December 2006, actual authoring/publication date unspecified.</ref>
* [[Leucism]] differs from albinism in that the melanin is, at least, partially absent but the eyes retain their usual color. Some leucistic animals are white or pale because of [[chromatophore]] (pigment cell) defects, and do not lack melanin.
* [[Melanism]] is the direct opposite of albinism. An unusually high level of melanin pigmentation (and sometimes absence of other types of pigment in species that have more than one) results in an appearance darker than non-melanistic specimens from the same genepool.<ref name="Feinstein">[http://www.birdersworld.com/brd/default.aspx?c=a&id=676 "Feather Colors: What We See"] by Dr. Julie Feinstein of the American Museum of Natural History (NY), in ''Birder's World Magazine'' online archive; sourced December 2006, actual authoring/publication date unspecified.</ref>

Plants that are pale due to a mutation that eliminates [[chlorophyll]] production are sometimes termed albinos, whereas plants that are pale from being in the dark are called [[etiolation|etiolated]]. [[Albino redwood]]s are rare examples that may grow to substantial size as [[parasite]]s.
