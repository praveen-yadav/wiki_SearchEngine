<!--Paragraph 1/3: Introduction and geogrpahy:-->
The '''London Borough of Croydon''' ({{audio|En-uk-LBCroydon.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a [[London borough]] in [[South London]], England and is part of [[Outer London]]. It covers an area of {{convert|87|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} and is the largest London borough by population. It is the southernmost borough of London.<ref name="General info">{{cite web|year=1996|url=http://www.londononline.co.uk/boroughs/croydon/|title=London Borough of Croydon information|publisher=London Online|accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref> At its centre is the historic town of [[Croydon]] from which the borough takes its name. Croydon is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]], and from a small market town has expanded into one of the most populous areas on the fringe of London. Croydon is the civic centre of the borough and houses the largest office and retail centre in the south east of England outside [[central London]]. The borough is now one of London's leading [[business]], [[financial]] and [[cultural]] centres, and its influence in [[entertainment]] and the [[arts]] contribute to its status as a major metropolitan centre.

<!--Paragraph 2/3: History and governance:-->
Formed in 1965 from the [[Coulsdon and Purley Urban District]] and the [[County Borough of Croydon]], the local authority [[Croydon London Borough Council]], is now part of the local government association for Greater London, [[London Councils]].<ref name="Arms of Croydon Online">{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/origins/arms.asp|title=The Arms of the London Borough of Croydon|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> The borough has a long history which is based mainly around [[Economy of Croydon|the economy of the area]]. The economic strength of Croydon dates back mainly to [[Croydon Airport]] which was a major factor in the development of Croydon as a business centre. Once London's main airport for all international flights to and from the capital, it was closed on 30 September 1959 due to the lack of expansion space needed for an airport to serve the growing city. It is now a Grade II [[listed building]] and tourist attraction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=201233&resourceID=5|title=Listed Buildings Online: Airport House|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=201234&resourceID=5|title=Listed Buildings Online: Former Lodge To Croydon Airport Terminal|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref> Croydon Council and its predecessor [[County Borough of Croydon|Croydon Corporation]] unsuccessfully applied for [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 1954, 2000 and 2002.

<!--Paragraph 3/3: Places, landmarks and cultural institutions:-->

==History==
:'' For the history of the original town see [[Croydon#History|History of Croydon]]''
The London Borough of Croydon was formed in 1965 from the [[Coulsdon and Purley Urban District]] and the [[County Borough of Croydon]].<ref name="Arms of Croydon Online"/> The name Croydon comes from Crogdene or Croindone, named by the [[Saxons]] in the 8th century when they settled here, although the area had been inhabited since prehistoric times.<ref name="History of Croydon">{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43053|title=Croydon: Introduction and Croydon Palace|publisher=British History Online|accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> It is thought to derive from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''croeas deanas'', meaning "the valley of the [[crocus]]es", indicating that, like [[Saffron Walden]] in [[Essex]], it was a centre for the collection of [[saffron]].

By the time of the Norman invasion Croydon had a church, a mill and around 365 inhabitants as recorded in the Domesday Book.<ref name="Croyweb History">{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.croyweb.com/Basic/history.htm|title=Local history of Croydon|publisher=Croyweb|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Archbishop Lanfranc]] lived at [[Croydon Palace]] which still stands. Visitors included [[Thomas Beckett]] (another Archbishop), and royal figures such as [[Henry VIII of England]] and [[Elizabeth I]].<ref name="History of Croydon book">{{cite book|last=Malden|first=H.E.|title=A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 4|year=1912|publisher=Victoria County History}}</ref>

Croydon carried on through the ages as a prosperous market town, they produced charcoal, tanned leather, and ventured into brewing. Croydon was served by the [[Surrey Iron Railway]], the first public railway (horse drawn) in the world, in 1803, and by the [[Brighton Main Line|London to Brighton]] rail link in the mid-19th century, helping it to become the largest town in what was then  [[Surrey]].<ref name="Croyweb History"/>

In the 20th century Croydon became known for industries such as metal working, car manufacture and its aerodrome, [[Croydon Airport]]. Starting out during World War I as an airfield for protection against [[Zeppelin]]s, an adjacent airfield was combined, and the new aerodrome opened on 29 March 1920. It became the largest in London, and was the main terminal for international air freight into the capital. It developed into one of the great airports of the world during the 1920s and 1930s, and welcomed the world's pioneer aviators in its heyday.<ref name="Battle book">{{cite book|last=Cluett|first=Douglas|coauthors=Joanna Bogle, Bob Learmonth|title=Croydon Airport and The Battle for Britain|year=1984|location=London Borough of Sutton Libraries and Arts Services|isbn=0-907335-11-X}}</ref> [[British Airways Ltd]] used the airport for a short period after redirecting from [[RAF Northolt|Northolt Aerodrome]], and Croydon was the operating base for [[Imperial Airways]]. It was partly due to the airport that Croydon suffered heavy bomb damage during World War II. As aviation technology progressed, however, and [[aircraft]] became larger and more numerous, it was recognized in 1952 that the airport would be too small to cope with the ever-increasing volume of air traffic. The last scheduled flight departed on 30 September 1959. It was superseded as the main airport by both [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] and [[London Gatwick Airport]] (see below). The air terminal, now known as Airport House, has been restored, and has a hotel and museum in it.<ref name="Croyweb History"/>

In the late 1950s and through the 1960s the council commercialized the centre of Croydon with massive development of office blocks and the [[Whitgift Centre]] which was formerly the biggest in town shopping centre in Europe.<ref name="urbanization">{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://usj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/43/13/2399|title=Modernism vs Urban Renaissance: Negotiating Post-war Heritage in English City Centres|publisher=Urban Studies Journal|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> The centre was officially opened in October 1970 by the [[Katharine, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]]. The original [[Whitgift School]] there had moved to Haling Park, South Croydon in the 1930s; the replacement school on the site, Whitgift Middle School, now the [[Trinity School of John Whitgift]], moved to Shirley Park in the 1960s when the buildings were demolished.

The borough council unsuccessfully applied for [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 1965, 2000 and again in 2002. If it had been successful it would have been the third local authority in [[Greater London]] to hold that status along with the ''[[City of London]]'' and the ''[[City of Westminster]]''. At present the London Borough of Croydon is the second most populous [[Local government district]] of England without city status, [[Kirklees]] being the first. Croydon's applications were refused as it was felt not to have an identity separate from the rest of Greater London. In 1965 it was described as "...now just part of the London conurbation and almost indistinguishable from many of the other Greater London boroughs" and in 2000 as having "no particular identity of its own".<ref name="beckett">{{cite book|title=City status in the British Isles, 1830–2002|series=Historical urban studies|author=Beckett, J V|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot|isbn=0-7546-5067-7}}</ref>

Croydon is currently going through a vigorous regeneration plan, called [[Croydon Vision 2020]]. This will change the [[urban planning]] of central Croydon completely. Its main aims are to make Croydon ''London's Third City'' and the hub of retail, business, culture and living in South London and South East England.<ref name="croydon expo 07">{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://www.croydonexpo.com/|title=Home of the Croydon Exp07|publisher=[[Croydon Expo]]|accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref> The plan was showcased in a series of events called [[Croydon Expo]].<ref name="regeneration croydon">{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://www.croydonconservatives.com/news_search_results_detail.asp?StoryNo=944|title=Croydon Expo to be a Regeneration Showcase|publisher=Croydon Conservatives|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> It was aimed at business and residents in the London Borough of Croydon to demonstrate the £3.5bn development projects the Council wishes to see in Croydon in the next ten years.<ref name="bbc croydon expo">{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/02/21/regeneration_feature.shtml |title=New look Croydon on display|work=[[BBC London]]|accessdate=2008-04-05 | location=London | first=Evadney | last=Campbell}}</ref>

There have also been exhibitions for regional districts of Croydon, including [[Waddon]], [[South Norwood]] and [[Woodside, London|Woodside]], [[Purley, London|Purley]], [[New Addington]] and [[Coulsdon]]. Examples of upcoming architecture featured in the expo can easily be found to the centre of the borough in the form of the [[Croydon Gateway]] site and the [[Cherry Orchard Road|Cherry Orchard Road Towers]].<ref name="ssn">{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=449575|title=Developer plans mixed-use scheme to rival Croydon Gateway|publisher=Skyscraper News|accessdate=2008-03-18}}</ref>

===Politics of Croydon Council===
{{further2|[[Croydon local elections]]}}
Croydon Council is governed by 70 councillors elected in 24 wards. From 1994 to 2006 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] councillors controlled the council.  

At the [[Croydon Council election, 2010|2010 Croydon local elections]] seats lost previously in Addiscombe, South Norwood and Upper Norwood were retaken by Labour Party councillors; in New Addington the Conservative party gained a councillor. The current composition of the council is Conservatives 37, Labour 33.

Mike Fisher, Conservative group leader since May 2005, was named as Council Leader following the Conservative victory. Croydon is a [[cabinet-style council]], and the Leader heads a ten-person cabinet, its members responsible for areas such as education or planning. There is a Shadow Cabinet drawn from the principal opposition party. A backbench cross-party scrutiny and overview committee is in place to hold the executive cabinet to account.

;Recent History
At the [[Croydon Council election 2006|2006 local elections]] Conservative councillors regained control in gaining 12&nbsp;councillors, taking ten seats from Labour in Addiscombe, Waddon, South Norwood and Upper Norwood and ousting the single [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] councillor in Coulsdon.<ref name="2005 election">{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydon.gov.uk/democracy/dande/elections/results/general|title=Results of the 2005 General Election held for Croydon Council|publisher=Croydon Council|accessdate=2007-10-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071027083047/http://www.croydon.gov.uk/democracy/dande/elections/results/general <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-27}}</ref><ref name="Map of wards in Croydon">{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.croydon.gov.uk/content/departments/570770/570872/wardmap.pdf|title=How the wards look|publisher=Croydon Council|accessdate=2007-09-20|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071026182529/http://www.croydon.gov.uk/content/departments/570770/570872/wardmap.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-26}}</ref>  Between the 2006 and 2010 elections, a by-election in February 2007 saw a large swing to Labour from the Conservatives.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Whereas 6% Conservative to Labour [[swing (politics)|swings]] were produced in the two previous [[by-election]]s to 2006, won by a councillor from the incumbent party (in both cases the party of a councillor who had died).{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Crossover in recent years has occurred in political affiliation, during 2002–6 one Conservative councillor defected to Labour, went back to the Conservatives and spent some time as an independent.  Since the election, a Labour councillor joined the Conservatives while a Conservative councillor became an independent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.croydonconservatives.com/news_search_results_detail.asp?StoryNo=949|title=Councillor defects to the Tory Group after a "lifetime" in the Labour Party|publisher=Croydon Conservatives|accessdate=2008-06-23}}</ref> 

Cllr Jonathan Driver, who became Mayor in 2008, died unexpectedly at the close of the year, causing a by-election in highly marginal Waddon which was successfully held by the Conservatives. 

From February 2005 until May 2006 the Leader of Croydon Council was [[Labour Co-operative]] Councillor Tony Newman, succeeding Hugh Malyan.

===Westminster Representation===

The borough is covered by three [[parliamentary constituencies]] for the Westminster Parliament, these are [[Croydon North (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon North]], [[Croydon Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon Central]] and [[Croydon South (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon South]]. There are 24 wards which represent Croydon Council.

===Civic history===
For much of its history, Croydon Council was controlled by the Conservative Party or conservative-leaning independents. Former Croydon councillors include former MPs [[Andrew Pelling]], [[Vivian Bendall]], [[David Congdon]], [[Geraint Davies (Labour politician)|Geraint Davies]] and [[Reg Prentice]], [[London Assembly]] member [[Valerie Shawcross]], [[Peter Spencer Bowness|Lord Bowness]], [[John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington]] ([[Master of the Rolls]]) and [[H.T. Muggeridge]], MP and father of [[Malcolm Muggeridge]]. The first Mayor of the newly created [[County Borough]] was [[Jabez Balfour]], later a disgraced [[Member of Parliament]]. Former Conservative Director of Campaigning, [[Gavin Barwell]], was a Croydon councillor between 1998 and 2010 and since 2010 is the MP for Croydon Central.

Some 10,000 people work directly or indirectly for the council, in its main offices in Taberner House or in its schools, care homes, housing offices or work depots. The council is generally well-regarded, having made important improvements in education and social services. However, there have been concerns over benefits, leisure services and waste collection. Although the council has one of London's lower rates of council tax, there are claims that it is too high and that resources are wasted.

The [[Mayors in England|Mayor of Croydon]] for 2010-11 is Councillor Avril Slipper. The Leader is Cllr Mike Fisher and the Deputy Leaders are Cllr Tim Pollard and Cllr Dudley Mead. The Chief Executive since 7 July 2007 has been Jon Rouse.

===Government buildings===
[[File:CroydonTabHouse.jpg|thumb|left|Croydon Council's [[Taberner House]] offices]]
[[Croydon Clocktower|Croydon Town Hall]] on Katharine Street in [[Croydon|Central Croydon]] houses the committee rooms, the mayor's and other councillors' offices, electoral services and the arts and heritage services.

The present Town Hall is Croydon's third. The first town hall is thought to have been built in either 1566 or 1609.<ref name="Croydon Town Hall">{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/heritage/town_hall.asp|title=Katharine Street, Town Hall: Heritage Pages|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref> The second was built in 1808 to serve the growing town but was demolished after the present town hall was erected in 1895.

The present town hall was designed by local architect Charles Henman<ref name="Croydon Town Hall"/> and was officially opened by the Prince and [[Queen Alexandra|Princess of Wales]] on 19 May 1896. It was constructed in red brick, sourced from [[Wrotham]] in [[Kent]], with [[Portland stone]] dressings and green [[Westmorland|Westmoreland]] [[slate]]s for the roof. It also housed the court and most central council employees.

[[File:Croydon clocktower.jpg|thumb|Croydon's Victorian Town Hall]]

Parts, including the former court rooms, have been converted into the [[Museum of Croydon]] and exhibition galleries. The original public library is now a cinema (now closed), part of the [[Croydon Clocktower]]. The Braithwaite Hall is used for events and performances. The town hall was renovated in the mid-1990s and the imposing central staircase, long closed to the public and kept for councillors only, was re-opened in 1994. The civic complex, meanwhile, was substantially added to, with buildings across Mint Walk and the 19-floor Taberner House to house the rapidly expanding corporation's employees.

[[Ruskin House]] is the headquarters of Croydon's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], [[Trade Union]] and [[Co-operative Party|Co-operative]] movements and is itself a co-operative with shareholders from organisations across the three movements. In the 19th century, Croydon was a bustling commercial centre of London. It was said that, at the turn of the 20th century, approximately £10,000 was spent in Croydon's taverns and inns every week. For the early labour movement, then, it was natural to meet in the town's public houses, in this environment. However, the temperance movement was equally strong, and [[Georgina King Lewis]], a keen member of the [[Croydon United Temperance Council]], took it upon herself to establish a dry centre for the labour movement. The first Ruskin House was highly successful, and there has been two more since.<ref name="Ruskin House">This text was taken, with permission, from ''Ruskin House: A History'', M. Tiedemann & E. Daisley. For more information see [[Talk:Ruskin House|here]] {{cite book|first=M. Tiedemann|coauthors=E. Daisley|year=1999}}</ref> The current house was officially opened in 1967 by the then Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Harold Wilson]]. Today, Ruskin House continues to serve as the headquarters of the Trade Union, Labour and Co-operative movements in Croydon, hosting a range of meetings and being the base for several labour movement groups. Office tenants include the headquarters of the [[Communist Party of Britain]] and Croydon Labour Party. [[Geraint Davies (Labour politician)|Geraint Davies]], the MP for [[Croydon Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon Central]], had offices in the building, until he was defeated by [[Andrew Pelling]] and is now the Labour representative standing for [[Swansea West (UK Parliament constituency)|Swansea West]] in [[Wales]].

[[Taberner House]] was built between 1964 and 1967, designed by architect H. Thornley, with Allan Holt and Hugh Lea as borough engineers. Although the council had needed extra space since the 1920s, it was only with the imminent creation of the London Borough of Croydon that action was taken. The building is in classic 1960s style, praised at the time but subsequently much derided. It has its elegant upper slab block narrowing towards both ends, a formal device which has been compared to the famous [[Pirelli Tower]] in [[Milan]]. It was named after Ernest Taberner OBE, Town Clerk from 1937 to 1963.<ref name="Taberner House names">{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/heritage/taberner_house.asp|title=Park Lane, Taberner House:Heritage Pages|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref>

Taberner House houses most of the council's central employees and is the main location for the public to access information and services, particularly with respect to housing.

==Geography and climate==
The borough is in the deep south of London, with the [[M25 motorway|M25 orbital motorway]] stretching to the south of it, between Croydon and [[Tandridge (district)|Tandridge]]. In the north and east of Croydon the authority mainly borders the [[London Borough of Bromley]] and in the north west the boroughs of [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] and [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]]. The boroughs of [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]] and [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]] are located directly to the west. It is at the head of the [[River Wandle]], just to the north of a significant gap in the [[North Downs]]. It lies {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of Central London, and the earliest settlement may have been a Roman staging post on the London-Portslade road, although conclusive evidence has not yet been found. The main town centre houses a great variety of well-known stores on [[North End, Croydon|North End]] and two shopping centres. It was pedestrianised in 1989 to attract people back to the town centre. Another shopping centre called [[Park Place (Croydon)|Park Place]] was due to open in 2012 but has since been scrapped.<ref>{{cite news |title=Croydon Council abandons agreement to build new shopping centre |first=Andrew |last=Worden |url=http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/news/Breaking-news-Croydon-Council-abandons-agreement-build-new-shopping-centre/article-985303-detail/article.html/ |newspaper=[[Croydon Advertiser]] |date=2009-05-12|accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref>

[[Wellesley Road]], is a [[dual carriageway]] that cuts through the centre of the town, and makes it hard to interchange between the civic centre's two railway stations. [[Croydon Vision 2020]] includes a plan for a more pedestrian-friendly replacement.

It mainly leads traffic on to [[Duppas Hill]], towards [[Purley Way]] with the intention for easy links with [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] and [[Kingston upon Thames]] further afield. The major junction on the flyover is for [[Old Town, Croydon|Old Town]], which is also a large three-lane road.

Croydon covers an area of 86.52&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, the 256th [[List of English districts by area|largest district in England]]. Croydon's physical features consist of many hills and rivers that are spread out across the borough and into the [[North Downs]], [[Surrey]] and the rest of South London. [[Addington Hills]] is a major hilly area to the south of London and is recognised as a significant obstacle to the growth of London from its origins as a port on the north side of the river, to a large circular city. The [[Great North Wood]] is a former natural oak forest that covered the [[Sydenham|Sydenham Ridge]] and the southern reaches of the [[River Effra]] and its tributaries. The most notable tree, called Vicar's Oak, marked the boundary of four ancient parishes; [[Lambeth]], [[Camberwell]], Croydon and [[Bromley]]. John Aubrey<ref>John Aubrey ''Natural History and Antiquities of the County of Surrey'', 1718, vol. 2, p. 33,</ref> referred to this "ancient remarkable tree" in the past tense as early as 1718, but according to JB Wilson,<ref>J.B. Wilson & H.A. Wilson ''The Story of Norwood'' ISBN 0-9515384-1-1</ref> the Vicar's Oak survived until 1825. The [[River Wandle]] is also a major tributary of the [[River Thames]], where it stretches to [[Wandsworth]] and [[Putney]] for 9 miles (14&nbsp;km) from its main source in [[Waddon]].

Croydon has a [[temperate]] climate in common with most areas of Great Britain, it is similar to that of [[Greenwich]] in [[Inner London]]: its [[Humid temperate climate|Köppen climate classification]] is ''Cfb''.<ref>[http://www.worldclimate.com/ WorldClimate]</ref><ref>([http://www.worldclimate.com/cgi-bin/data.pl?ref=N51W000+1102+03776W Temperature data)]</ref> Its mean annual temperature of 9.6 °C is similar to that experienced throughout the Weald, and slightly cooler than nearby areas such as the Sussex coast and central London.<ref name="temperature">{{cite web|year=2001|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif|title=Mean Temperature Annual Average|publisher=[[Met Office]]|accessdate=2007-08-22}}</ref> Rainfall is considerably below England's average (1971–2000) level of 838&nbsp;mm, and every month is drier overall than the England average.<ref name="rainmean">{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/areal/england.html|title=Met Office: averages 1971–2000|accessdate=2007-08-22|publisher=Met Office|year=2007|work=Met Office website}}</ref>

===Architecture===
{{further2|[[Architecture of Croydon]] and [[List of tallest buildings and structures in Croydon]]}}
The skyline of Croydon has significantly changed over the past 50 years. High rise buildings, mainly office blocks, now dominate the skyline. The most notable of these buildings include Croydon Council's headquarters [[Taberner House]], which has been compared to the famous [[Pirelli Tower]] of [[Milan]], and the [[Nestlé Tower]], the former UK headquarters of [[Nestlé]].

In recent years, the development of [[Tall buildings in London|tall buildings]], such as the approved [[Croydon Vocational Tower]] and [[Wellesley Square]], has been encouraged in the [[London Plan]], which will lead to the erection of new skyscrapers over the next few years as London goes through a high-rise boom.<ref>{{cite web|title=London - Full Summary of Projects|publisher=Will Fox, SkyscraperCity.com|url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=46|accessdate=2006-12-15}}</ref>

[[No. 1 Croydon]], formerly the NLA Tower, Britain's 88th tallest tower,<ref name="NLA Tower">{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/snuk_list.htm|title=Britain's Tallest 100 Buildings by Height|publisher=Sky Scraper News|accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> close to [[East Croydon station]], is an example of 1970s architecture. The tower was originally nicknamed the ''Threepenny bit building'', as it resembles a stack of pre-decimalisation [[Threepence (British coin)|Threepence]] coins, which were 12-sided. Since [[Decimal Day|decimalisation]] it has gained the alternative nickname ''50 pence building'', based on the more familiar [[British fifty pence coin|50 pence coin]].

[[Lunar House]] is another high-rise building. Like other government office buildings on Wellesley Road, such as '''[[Apollo House (Croydon)|Apollo House]]''', the name of the building was inspired by the [[Project Apollo|US moon landings]] (In the Croydon suburb of New Addington there is a [[public house]], built during the same period, called ''The Man '''on''' the Moon'').

A new generation of buildings are being considered by the council as part of [[Croydon Vision 2020]], so that the borough doesn't lose its title of having the "largest office space in the south east", excluding central London.<ref>{{cite web|title=Croydon Gateway - Arrowcroft Scheme|publisher=Emporis|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/nc/ne/?id=101018|accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> Projects such as [[Wellesley Square]], which will be a mix of residential and retail with an eye-catching colour design and [[100 George Street]] a proposed modern office block are incorporated in this vision.

Notable events that have happened to Croydon's skyline include the Millennium project to create the largest single urban lighting project ever. It was created for the buildings of Croydon to illuminate them for the third millennium. Not only did this project give new lighting to the buildings, but it provided an opportunity to project onto them images and words, mixing art and poetry with coloured light, and also displaying public information after dark. Apart from increasing night time activity in Croydon and thereby reducing the fear of crime, it helped to promote the sustainable use of older buildings by displaying them in a more positive way.<ref name="skyline">{{cite web|url=http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-site/awards.cgi?action=detail&id=38&t=2|title=Croydon Skyline|accessdate=2007-10-12|publisher=Millennium Commission|year=2003|work=Croydon Skyline Millennium Trust}}</ref>

Major employers are well-known companies, who hold stores or offices in the town. [[Purley Way]] is a major employer of people, looking for jobs as sales assistants, sales consultants and store managerial jobs. [[IKEA Croydon]], when it was built in 1992, brought many non-skilled jobs to Croydon.

==Transport==
{{Main|List of stations in the London Borough of Croydon|Tramlink}}
There are two main interchanges for all public transport modes ([[Inter-city rail|national]] and [[Commuter rail|local rail]], [[Tramlink|tram]], and [[Bus|local buses]]) at [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]] and [[East Croydon station]].

===National and international travel===
Croydon is linked into the national motorway network via the [[M23 motorway|M23]] and [[M25 motorway|M25]] orbital motorway. The M25 skirts the south of the borough, linking Croydon with other parts of London and the surrounding counties; the M23 branches from the M25 close to Coulsdon, linking the town with the south coast, [[Crawley]], [[Reigate]], and [[London Gatwick Airport]]. The [[A23 road|A23]] connects the borough with the motorways. The A23 is the major trunk road through Croydon, linking it with central London, East Sussex, Horsham, and Littlehaven. The old London to Brighton road, passes through the west of the borough on [[Purley Way]], bypassing the commercial centre of Croydon which it once did.

[[File:East Croydon Railway Station - England - Station Frontage - Evening - 270404.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[East Croydon station]]]]

The [[Brighton Main Line]] [[Rail transport in Great Britain|railway route]] south from Croydon links the town to Sussex, Surrey, and Kent and to central London to the north: providing direct services to Hastings, Southampton, Brighton, Portsmouth, Gatwick Airport, Bedford and Luton. The main station for all these services is [[East Croydon station]] in the centre of the town centre. [[East Croydon station]] is the largest and busiest station in Croydon, third busiest in London, excluding [[Travelcard Zone 1]]. The station at [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]] serves all trains travelling west except the fastest. There are also more regional stations scattered around the borough. Passenger rail services through Croydon are provided by [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]] and [[First Capital Connect]].<ref name="national rail">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/system/galleries/download/print_maps/Nat_Rail_Passenger_Operators_2006.pdf|title=UK rail network map|accessdate=2008-05-25|publisher=[[National Rail]]|year=2006|work=National Rail website}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> A pilot scheme launched by the [[Strategic Rail Authority]], [[Transport for London]] and three train operators is designed to encourage more passengers to travel off-peak. In full partnership with the [[South London|South London Boroughs]] which includes Croydon, SWELTRAC, SELTRANS and the transport users group, the scheme promotes the advantages of off-peak travel following improvements to safety, travel connections and upgrading of station facilities. The [[Thameslink Programme]] (formerly known as Thameslink 2000), is a £3.5&nbsp;billion major project to expand the [[Thameslink|Thameslink network]] from 51 to 172 [[railway station|stations]]<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=2413&NewsAreaID=2&SearchCategoryID=8|title=Good news for South London as £3.5BN Thameslink project clears major hurdle|date=2006-10-18|accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref> spreading northwards to [[Bedford]], [[Peterborough]], [[Cambridge]] and [[King's Lynn]] and southwards to [[Guildford]], [[Eastbourne]], [[Horsham]], [[Hove]] to [[Littlehampton]], [[East Grinstead]], [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] and [[Dartford]]. The project includes the lengthening of platforms, station remodelling, new railway infrastructure (e.g. viaduct) and additional rolling stock. When implemented, First Capital Connect services would call at other stations in the borough including Purley and Norwood Junction.

The closest international airport to Croydon is [[London Gatwick Airport]], which is located {{convert|19|mi|km}} from the town centre. Gatwick airport opened on August 1930 as an aerodrome and is a major international operational base for [[British Airways]], [[EasyJet]] and [[Virgin Atlantic Airways|Virgin Atlantic]]. It currently handles around 35 million passengers a year, making it London's second largest airport, and the second busiest airport in the United Kingdom after [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]]. [[London Heathrow Airport]], [[London City Airport]] and [[London Luton Airport]] all lie within a two hours' drive of Croydon. Gatwick and Luton Airports are connected to Croydon by [[Thameslink|frequent direct trains]], while Heathrow is accsesible by the [[London Buses route X26|route X26]] bus.

===Local travel===
The [[A23 road|A23]] and [[A22 road]]s are the major trunk roads through Croydon. These both run north-south, connecting to each other in [[Purley, London|Purley]]. The A22 connects Croydon, its starting point, to [[East Grinstead]], [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[Uckfield]], and [[Eastbourne]]. Other major roads generally radiate spoke-like from the city centre. [[Wellesley Road]] is an urban [[dual carriageway]] which cuts through the middle of the [[central business district]]. It was constructed in the 1960s as part of a planned ring road for Croydon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/indepth/croydonringroad/|title=CBRD - In Depth - Croydon Ring Road|accessdate=2009-06-09}}</ref> and includes an [[Croydon Underpass|underpass]], which allows traffic to avoid going into the town centre.

The hilly topography of Croydon and the lack of underground services in that part of South London is a reason for the extensive suburban and inter-urban railway network. Croydon is in the commuter belt to London as part of suburbia. There are several busy local rail routes running along the borough's towns, connecting it with [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] and [[London Victoria]]. These local routes mainly run on the [[Brighton Main Line]] and [[Sutton & Mole Valley Lines]]. As well as the main stations of East Croydon and West Croydon, there are several suburban stations at [[Norwood Junction railway station|Norwood Junction]], [[Purley railway station|Purley]], [[Coulsdon South railway station|Coulsdon South]] and [[Kenley railway station|Kenley]] and more.

[[File:Addington Village bus and tram station.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Tramlink]] at Addington Interchange]]
The light rail system ''[[Tramlink]]'' (Operated by [[Tramtrack Croydon]], a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx|title=TfL announces plans to take over Tramlink services|date=2008-03-17|accessdate=2008-05-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080412011803/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-12}}</ref> opened in 2000, serves the borough and surrounding areas. Its network consists of three lines, from [[Elmers End]] to West Croydon, from [[Beckenham]] to West Croydon, and from [[New Addington]] to [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], with all three lines running via the Croydon loop on which it is centred on. It has been highly successful, environmentally-friendly and a reliable light rail system carrying around 22 million passengers a year. It is also the only tram system in London but there is another light rail system [[Docklands Light Railway|in the Docklands]]. It serves [[Mitcham]], [[Woodside, London|Woodside]], [[Addiscombe]] and the [[Purley Way]] retail and industrial area amongst others. An extension to [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] is currently being developed by Transport for London with the support of the council and the South London Partnership. This would improve public transport access to [[Upper Norwood]] and [[Crystal Palace Park]] and help to stimulate regeneration across the wider area. The extension could be in service by 2013. Other possible extensions include [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], a new park and ride close to the M25, [[Coulsdon]], [[Purley, London|Purley]], [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Tolworth]], [[Tooting]], [[Brixton]] for an interchange with the proposed [[Cross River Tram]], [[Bromley]] and [[Lewisham]] for an interchange with the Docklands Light Railway.

A sizeable bus infrastructure which is part of the [[London Buses]] network operates from a main hub at [[West Croydon station]]. The bus station at [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]] is undergoing a major re-development to make it more modern and future-proof. There are also plans to create a new bus terminal at [[Park Place (Croydon)|Park Place]] if the shopping centre is built. [[Addington Interchange]] is a regional bus terminal in [[Addington, London|Addington Village]] which has an interchange between [[Tramlink route 3|route three]] and bus services in the remote area. [[Arriva London]], part of [[Arriva]], is one of the largest bus operators to serve Croydon along with [[Metrobus (South East England)|Metrobus]], [[Selkent]], and [[Travel London|National Express London]]. Unlike other places in the country, London's transport infrastructure is regulated and therefore is not subject to price wars between different companies with TfL setting a standard price for bus services which is currently set at 90p with an [[Oyster card]]. Services include buses to central London, Purley Way, Bromley, Lewisham and a number of other [[civic centre]]s in the south. [[London Buses route X26]], the longest route in London, provides services to Heathrow Airport via [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond]] and Sutton.

Although hilly, Croydon is compact and has few major trunk roads running through it. It is on one of the [[Connect2]] schemes which are part of the [[National Cycle Network]] route running around [[Croydon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sustransconnect2.org.uk/schemes/project_detail.php?id=147|title=London - Croydon Park Links|year=2008|accessdate=2008-05-24}}</ref> The [[North Downs]], an area of outstanding natural beauty popular with both on- and off-road cyclists, is so close to Croydon that part of the park lies within the borough boundary, and there are routes into the park almost from the civic centre.

Following the extension of the [[East London Line]] in 2010, two stations in Croydon are now served by [[London Overground]] services; [[Norwood Junction]] and [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]]. Currently Croydon is one of only five London Boroughs not to have at least one [[London Underground]] station within its boundaries, and the closest tube station is in [[Morden tube station|Morden]].<ref name="London Town">{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.londontown.com/LondonStreets/the_croydon_flyover_44f.html|title = Local guide to The Croydon Flyover|publisher=LondonTown|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref>

===Libraries===
The borough of Croydon has 14 libraries, a joint library and a mobile library. Many of the libraries were built a long time ago and therefore have become outdated, so the council started updating a few including [[Ashburton Library]] which moved from its former spot into the state-of-the-art [[Ashburton Learning Village]] complex which is on the former site of the old 'A Block' of [[Oasis Academy Shirley Park|Ashburton Community School]] which is now situated inside the centre. The library is now on one floor. This format was planned to be rolled out across all of the council's libraries but what was seen as costing too much.

[[South Norwood Library]], [[New Addington Library]], Shirley Library, Selsdon Library, Sanderstead Library, Purley Library, Coulsdon Library and Bradmore Green Library are examples of older council libraries. The main library is [[Croydon Central Library]] which holds many references, newspaper archives and a tourist information point (one of three in southeast London). [[Upper Norwood Library]] is a joint library with the [[London Borough of Lambeth]]. This means that both councils fund the library and its resources, but even though Lambeth have nearly doubled their funding for the library in the past several years Croydon has kept it the same,<ref name="Tessa Jowell Labour campaign article">{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.tessajowell.net/?PageId=4bd1346c-8ec2-36f4-ed45-ba76a9cef35eschoolType=all|title=Tessa Jowell joins campaign for joint funding of Upper Norwood Library|publisher=Labour Party|accessdate=2007-07-24}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> doubting the future of the library.

The predominant religion of the borough is [[Christianity]]. According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001]], the borough has over 215,124 Christians, mainly Protestants. This is the largest religious following in the borough followed by Islam with 17,642 Muslims resident. This is a small portion of the more than 600,000 Muslims in London as a whole. 

48,615 Croydon residents stated that they are [[atheist]] or [[irreligious|non-religious]] in the 2001 Census.

There are more than 35 churches in the borough, with [[Croydon Minster]] being the main one.<ref name="Churches in LB Croydon">{{cite web|year=2003|url=http://www.eden.co.uk/churches/croydon/index.html|title=Croydon Churches|publisher=Eden/National Church Database|accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref> This church was founded in Saxon times, since there is a record of "a priest of Croydon" in 960, although the first record of a church building is in the [[Domesday Book]] (1086). In its final medieval form, the church was mainly a Perpendicular-style structure, but this was severely damaged by fire in 1867, following which only the tower, south porch and outer walls remained. Under the direction of Sir George Gilbert Scott the church was rebuilt, incorporating the remains and essentially following the design of the medieval building, and was reconsecrated in 1870. It still contains several important monuments and fittings saved from the old church.<ref name="Croydon Parish Church">{{cite web|year=2011|url=http://www.croydonminster.org/about-us/history|title=History of Croydon Minster|publisher=Croydon Minster|accessdate=2011-05-30}}</ref>

Croydon has strong religious links, from a royal charter for [[Surrey Street Market]] dating back to 1276, to [[Croydon Palace]] which was the summer residence of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] for over 500 years, with visitors such as [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. The [[Bishop of Croydon]] is a position as a [[Bishop#Bishops in Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican churches|suffragan]] [[Bishop]] in the [[Anglican]] [[Anglican Diocese of Southwark|Diocese of Southwark]]. The latest bishop was Rt Rev [[Nicholas Baines (bishop)|Nicholas (Nick) Baines]].

==Sport and leisure==
{{further2|[[Croydon parks and open spaces]]}}
The borough has been criticized in the past for not having enough leisure facilities, maintaining the position of Croydon as a three star borough.<ref name="Croydon's three star borough rating">{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://www.croydonconservatives.com/news_search_results_printer.asp?StoryNo=942|title=Three Star Croydon 'Improving Well'|publisher=Croydon Conservatives|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref> At the moment{{When|date=October 2012}} only three leisure centres are open for public use and two of these are expected to be closed down in the near future, with plans for only one of them to be re-built. Thornton Heath's ageing sports centre was recently demolished and replaced by a newer more modern leisure centre.

==Culture==
[[File:Fairfield 07-12-19.JPG|Fairfield Halls in Central Croydon is the main entertainment venue in the borough|thumb|right]]
Croydon aims to become one of the hearts of culture in London and the South East of England. This has been proved with the dedication the council has shown to projects such as the proposed [[Croydon Arena]]. Although, despite the aim, it has also cut funding to the [[Warehouse Theatre]].<ref name="Warehouse Theatre">{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/search/display.var.956329.0.the_warehouse_fights_council_cut.php|title=The Warehouse Theatre fights council cut plans|publisher=Croydon Guardian|accessdate=2007-09-28}}</ref>

==Investment in the tobacco industry==
