All the discovered alkali metals occur in nature: in order of [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundance]], sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high [[radioactivity]] and thus occurs only in [[trace radioisotope|traces]] due to its presence in natural [[decay chain]]s.<ref name="webelements-occurrence"/><ref name="chemeducator"/> Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of [[ununennium]] (Uue), which is likely to be the next member of the group, but they have all met with failure.<ref name="link">{{cite journal|title=Search for superheavy elements using <sup>48</sup>Ca + <sup>254</sup>Es<sup>g</sup> reaction|first1=R.W. |last1=Lougheed |first2=J.H.|last2=Landrum|first3=E.K.|last3=Hulet|first4=J.F.|last4=Wild|first5=R.J.|last5=Dougan|first6=A.D.|last6=Dougan|first7=H.|last7=Gäggeler|first8=M|last8=Schädel|first9=K.J.|last9=Moody|first10=K.E.|last10=Gregorich|last11=Seaborg|journal=Physical Review C|year=1985|pages=1760–1763|volume=32|issue=5|bibcode = 1985PhRvC..32.1760L|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.32.1760|first11=G. }}</ref> However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of [[superheavy element]]s;<ref name="tanm">{{cite web |url=http://lch.web.psi.ch/files/lectures/TexasA&M/TexasA&M.pdf |title=Gas Phase Chemistry of Superheavy Elements |author=Gäggeler, Heinz W. |date=5–7 November 2007 |work=Lecture Course Texas A&M |accessdate=26 February 2012}}</ref> even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.<ref name="Uue"/>{{rp|1729–1733}}

Most alkali metals have many different applications. Two of the most well-known applications of the pure elements are rubidium and caesium [[atomic clock]]s,<ref name="atomic-clocks"/> of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time.<ref name="pubs.usgs"/><ref name="nist-second"/> A common application of the compounds of sodium is the [[sodium-vapour lamp]], which emits very efficient light.<ref name="lamp1"/><ref name="lamp2"/> [[Table salt]], or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity. Sodium and potassium are also [[essential element]]s, having major biological roles as [[electrolyte]]s,<ref name="webelements-potassium"/><ref name="webelements-sodium"/> and although the other alkali metals are not essential, they also have various effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.<ref name="webelements-lithium"/><ref name="webelements-rubidium"/><ref name="webelements-caesium"/><ref name="rsc-francium"/>

Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme [[radioactive decay|radioactivity]];<ref name="rsc" /> thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited.

[[File:Cesium water.theora.ogv|thumb|Caesium reacts explosively with water even at low temperatures]]
All the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature.<ref name="krebs" /> Because of this, they are usually stored in [[mineral oil]] or [[kerosene]] (paraffin oil).<ref name="OU"/> They react aggressively with the [[halogen]]s to form the [[alkali metal halide]]s, which are white [[ionic crystal|ionic crystalline compounds]] that are all [[solubility|soluble]] in water except [[lithium fluoride]] ([[lithium|Li]][[fluorine|F]]).<ref name="rsc"/> The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly [[alkali]]ne [[hydroxide]]s and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium.<ref name="rsc"/><ref name="alkalibangs"/><ref name="pubs.usgs" /> The alkali metals have the lowest first [[ionization energy|ionisation energies]] in their respective periods of the [[periodic table]]<ref name="RubberBible84th">{{cite book | editor = Lide, D.

The alkalide anions have filled [[s-orbital|s-subshells]], which gives them more stability and allows them to exist. All the stable alkali metals except lithium are known to be able to form alkalides,<ref>{{cite journal | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | author = J. L. Dye, J. M. Ceraso, Mei Lok Tak, B. L.

The chemistry of lithium shows several differences from that of the rest of the group as the small Li<sup>+</sup> cation [[chemical polarity|polarises]] [[anion]]s and gives its compounds a more [[covalent bond|covalent]] character.<ref name="rsc" /> Lithium and [[magnesium]] have a [[diagonal relationship]]:<ref name="rsc" /> because of this, lithium has some similarities to magnesium. For example, lithium forms a stable [[nitride]], a property common among all the [[alkaline earth metal]]s (magnesium's group) but unique among the alkali metals.<ref name="alkalireact"/> In addition, among their respective groups, only lithium and magnesium form [[covalent bond|covalent]] [[organometallic compound]]s (e.g. Li[[methyl group|Me]] and MgMe<sub>2</sub>).<ref name="Shriver&Atkins">{{cite book |title=Inorganic Chemistry |first1=Duward |last1=Shriver |first2=Peter |last2=Atkins |publisher=W.

In contrast to the trend of decreasing [[electronegativity|electronegativities]] and [[ionisation energy|ionisation energies]] of the alkali metals, francium's electronegativity and ionisation energy are predicted to be higher than caesium's due to the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons; also, its [[atomic radius]] is expected to be abnormally low.<!--Haire says this happens for Uue because of the analogous effect for 8s - seems likely for Fr too--><ref name="Uue">{{cite book| title = The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements| editor1-last = Morss|editor2-first = Norman M.| editor2-last = Edelstein| editor3-last = Fuger|editor3-first = Jean| last1 = Hoffman|first1 = Darleane C.| last2=Lee|first2=Diana M. |last3=Pershina|first3=Valeria | chapter = Transactinides and the future elements| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]]| year = 2006| isbn = 1-4020-3555-1| location = Dordrecht, The Netherlands| edition = 3rd| ref = CITEREFHaire2006}}</ref>{{rp|1729}}<ref name="andreev"/>

[[File:Large Sodium Explosion.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large orange-yellow explosion|A reaction of 3 [[pound (mass)|pounds]] (≈ 1.4 kg) of sodium with water]]
All the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water, producing an [[aqueous solution]] of the strongly [[base (chemistry)|basic]] alkali metal [[hydroxide]] and releasing hydrogen gas.<ref name="alkaliwater">{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/reacth2o.html#top |title=Reaction of the Group 1 Elements with Water |author=Clark, Jim |year=2005 |work=chemguide |accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref> This reaction becomes more vigorous going down the group: lithium reacts steadily with [[effervescence]], but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers.<ref name="rsc"/> When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, of which there are two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing [[hydrogen]] gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water).<ref name="alkalibangs"/>

Lithium and sodium react with [[carbon]] to form [[acetylide]]s, Li<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, which can also be obtained by reaction of the metal with [[acetylene]].

Lithium, the lightest of the alkali metals, is the only alkali metal which reacts with [[nitrogen]] at [[standard conditions]], and its [[nitride]] is the only stable alkali metal nitride. Nitrogen is an [[reactivity (chemistry)|unreactive]] gas because breaking the strong [[triple bond]] in the [[dinitrogen]] molecule (N<sub>2</sub>) requires a lot of energy. The formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal (forming M<sup>+</sup> ions), the energy required to break the triple bond in N<sub>2</sub> and the formation of N<sup>3−</sup> ions, and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the [[lattice energy]] of the alkali metal nitride. The lattice energy is maximised with small, highly charged ions; the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions, only forming ions with a charge of +1, so only lithium, the smallest alkali metal, can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen [[exothermic]], forming [[lithium nitride]]. The reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be [[endothermic]], so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions.<ref name="alkalireact">{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/reacto2.html#top |title=Reaction of the Group 1 Elements with Oxygen and Chlorine |author=Clark, Jim |year=2005 |work=chemguide |accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref> ([[Sodium nitride]] (Na<sub>3</sub>N) and [[potassium nitride]] (K<sub>3</sub>N), while existing, are extremely unstable, being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements, and cannot be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions.)<ref name=Jansen1>{{cite journal|title=Synthesis and structure of Na<sub>3</sub>N|author=Fischer, D., Jansen, M.|journal= Angew Chem|volume=41|issue=10|page=1755|year=2002|doi=10.1002/1521-3773(20020517)41:10<1755::AID-ANIE1755>3.0.CO;2-C}}</ref><ref name="Jansen2">{{cite journal|title=Synthesis and structure of K<sub>3</sub>N|author=Fischer, D.; Cancarevic, Z.; Schön, J.

All the alkali metals react readily with [[phosphorus]] and [[arsenic]] to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula M<sub>3</sub>Pn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a [[pnictogen]]). This is due to the greater size of the P<sup>3−</sup> and As<sup>3−</sup> ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form.<ref name=generalchemistry/> These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae K<sub>3</sub>P, K<sub>4</sub>P<sub>3</sub>, K<sub>5</sub>P<sub>4</sub>, KP, K<sub>4</sub>P<sub>6</sub>, K<sub>3</sub>P<sub>7</sub>, K<sub>3</sub>P<sub>11</sub>, KP<sub>10.3</sub>, and KP<sub>15</sub>.<ref name = "Schnering">H.G.

=====Reaction with the chalcogens (alkali metal chalcogenides)=====

All the alkali metals react vigorously with [[oxygen]] at standard conditions. They form various types of oxides, such as simple [[oxide]]s (containing the O<sup>2−</sup> ion), [[peroxide]]s (containing the {{chem|O|2|2-}} ion, where there is a [[single bond]] between the two oxygen atoms), [[superoxide]]s (containing the {{chem|O|2|-}} ion), and many others. Lithium burns in air to form [[lithium oxide]], but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of [[sodium oxide]] and [[sodium peroxide]]. Potassium forms a mixture of [[potassium peroxide]] and [[potassium superoxide]], while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively. Their reactivity increases going down the group: while lithium, sodium and potassium merely burn in air, rubidium and caesium are [[pyrophoric]] (spontaneously catch fire in air).<ref name="alkalireact"/>

The smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the more complex anions (the peroxide and superoxide) due to their small size. This attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms, forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom. This causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature. This effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium, allowing them to form the less stable peroxides. Rubidium and caesium, at the bottom of the group, are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form. Because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed, the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised. (The oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist, but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions.)<ref name="alkalireact"/> In addition, the small size of the Li<sup>+</sup> and O<sup>2−</sup> ions contributes to their forming a stable ionic lattice structure. Under controlled conditions, however, all the alkali metals, with the exception of francium, are known to form their oxides, peroxides, and superoxides. The alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful [[oxidizing agent]]s. [[Sodium peroxide]] and [[potassium superoxide]] react with [[carbon dioxide]] to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas, which allows them to be used in [[submarine]] air purifiers; the presence of [[water vapour]], naturally present in breath, makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient.<ref name=generalchemistry/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lindsay |first1=D.

Rubidium and caesium can form even more complicated oxides than the superoxides. Rubidium can form Rb<sub>6</sub>O and Rb<sub>9</sub>O<sub>2</sub> upon oxidation in air, while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides, such as the [[ozonide]] CsO<sub>3</sub><ref>{{cite journal|doi =10.1007/BF00845494|title =Synthesis of cesium ozonide through cesium superoxide|year =1963|last1 =Vol'nov|first1 =I.

The alkali metals can also react analogously with the heavier chalcogens ([[sulfur]], [[selenium]], [[tellurium]], and [[polonium]]), and all the alkali metal chalcogenides are known (with the exception of francium's). Reaction with an excess of the chalcogen can similarly result in lower chalcogenides, with chalcogen ions containing chains of the chalcogen atoms in question. For example, sodium can react with sulfur to form the [[sulfide]] ([[sodium sulfide|Na<sub>2</sub>S]]) and various [[polysulfide]]s with the formula Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>''x''</sub> (''x'' from 2 to 6), containing the {{chem|S|''x''|2-}} ions.<ref name=generalchemistry/> Due to the basicity of the Se<sup>2−</sup> and Te<sup>2−</sup> ions, the alkali metal [[selenide]]s and [[telluride (chemistry)|tellurides]] are alkaline in solution; when reacted directly with selenium and tellurium, alkali metal polyselenides and polytellurides are formed along with the selenides and tellurides with the {{chem|Se|''x''|2-}} and {{chem|Te|''x''|2-}} ions.<ref name="house2008">{{cite book|title = Inorganic chemistry| first = James E.|last = House| publisher = Academic Press| year = 2008| isbn = 0-12-356786-6| page = 524}}</ref> The alkali metal [[polonide]]s are all ionic compounds containing the Po<sup>2−</sup> ion; they are very chemically stable and can be produced by direct reaction of the elements at around 300–400&nbsp;°C.<ref name="Greenwood&Earnshaw"/><ref name="AEC-chem">{{Cite book | last = Moyer | first = Harvey V. | contribution = Chemical Properties of Polonium | pages = 33–96 | title = Polonium | url = http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/4367751-nEJIbm/ | editor-last = Moyer | editor-first = Harvey V. | id = TID-5221 | doi = 10.2172/4367751 | year = 1956 | location = Oak Ridge, Tenn. | publisher = United States Atomic Energy Commission | postscript = }}.</ref><ref name="Bagnall">{{Cite journal | first = K.

=====Reaction with hydrogen and the halogens (alkali metal hydrides and halides)=====
{{main|Alkali metal halide}}
The alkali metals are among the most [[electropositive]] elements on the periodic table and thus tend to [[ionic bond|bond ionically]] to the most [[electronegative]] elements on the periodic table, the [[halogen]]s, forming [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] known as the alkali metal halides. This includes [[sodium chloride]], otherwise known as common salt. The reactivity becomes higher from lithium to caesium and drops from [[fluorine]] to [[iodine]]. All of the alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids.<ref name="rsc"/><ref name="alkalireact"/> All the alkali metal halides are [[solubility|soluble]] in water except for [[lithium fluoride]] (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high [[lattice enthalpy]]. The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li<sup>+</sup> and F<sup>−</sup> ions, causing the [[electrostatic interaction]]s between them to be strong.<ref name="rsc"/> The alkali metals also react similarly with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides.<ref name="generalchemistry">{{cite book |last1=Averill |first1=Bruce A. |last2=Eldredge |first2=Patricia |title=Chemistry: Principles, Patterns, and Applications with Student Access Kit for Mastering General Chemistry |url=http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/general-chemistry-principles-patterns-and-applications-v1.0/section_25_03.html |accessdate=24 June 2013 |year=2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=1st |isbn=9780805337990 |chapter=21.3: The Alkali Metals}}</ref>

Alkali metal cations do not usually form [[coordination complex]]es with simple [[Lewis base]]s due to their low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li<sup>+</sup> ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less. In [[aqueous solution]], the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes ([M(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>)]<sup>+</sup>), with the exception of the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes ([Li(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>)]<sup>+</sup>); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, [[anhydrous]] salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as [[desiccant]]s.<ref name=generalchemistry/> Alkali metals also readily form complexes with [[crown ether]]s (e.g. [[12-crown-4]] for Li<sup>+</sup>, [[15-crown-5]] for Na<sup>+</sup>, and [[18-crown-6]] for K<sup>+</sup>) and [[cryptand]]s due to electrostatic attraction.<ref name=generalchemistry/>

=====Ammonia solutions=====
Unlike most metals, the alkali metals dissolve slowly in liquid [[ammonia]], forming hydrogen gas and the [[metal amide#alkali metal amides|alkali metal amide]] (MNH<sub>2</sub>, where M represents an alkali metal). The process may be speeded up by a [[catalyst]]. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. The colour is due to the presence of [[solvated electron]]s, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous [[sodium chloride]]; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like [[mercury (element)|mercury]].<ref name="Greenwood&Earnshaw"/><ref name=generalchemistry/><ref name="c&w">{{cite book |last=Cotton  |first=F.A |authorlink= |coauthors=G. Wilkinson |title=Advanced Inorganic Chemistry |year=1972 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons Inc |location= |isbn=0-471-17560-9 }}</ref> In addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation (M<sup>+</sup>), the neutral alkali metal atom (M), [[diatomic molecule|diatomic]] alkali metal molecules (M<sub>2</sub>) and alkali metal anions (M<sup>−</sup>). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful [[reducing agent]]s and are often used in chemical synthesis.<ref name=generalchemistry/>

=====Organometallic chemistry=====
[[File:Methyllithium-tetramer-2-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|Structure of the methyllithium tetramer, (CH<sub>3</sub>Li)<sub>4</sub>]]
Being the smallest alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable [[organometallic compound]]s, which are bonded covalently. [[Organolithium reagent|Organolithium]] compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, and tend to form [[oligomer]]s with the structure (RLi)<sub>''x''</sub> where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the [[charge density]] of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a [[carbanion]], organolithium compounds are extremely powerful [[base (chemistry)|base]]s and [[carbon nucleophile|nucleophile]]s. For use as bases, [[butyllithium]]s are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is [[methyllithium]] ((CH<sub>3</sub>Li)<sub>''x''</sub>), which exists in tetrameric (''x'' = 4) and hexameric (''x'' = 6) forms.<ref name=generalchemistry/><ref name=Brown1957 >{{ cite journal | author = Brown, T.

The application of [[organosodium chemistry|organosodium]] compounds in chemistry is limited in part due to competition from [[organolithium compound]]s, which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is [[sodium cyclopentadienide]]. [[Sodium tetraphenylborate]] can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups. Organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility. A notable reagent is [[Schlosser's base]], a mixture of [[n-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] and [[potassium tert-butoxide|potassium ''tert''-butoxide]]. This reagent reacts with [[propene]] to form the compound [[allylpotassium]] (KCH<sub>2</sub>CHCH<sub>2</sub>). [[cis-2-butene|''cis''-2-Butene]] and [[trans-2-butene|''trans''-2-butene]] equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals. Whereas [[isomerization]] is fast with lithium and sodium, it is slow with the higher alkali metals. The higher alkali metals also favor the [[steric hindrance|sterically]] congested conformation.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Superbases for organic synthesis | author = Manfred Schlosser | journal = Pure and Appl.

The atomic radii of the alkali metals increase going down the group.<ref name="chemguide"/> Because of the [[shielding effect]], when an atom has more than one [[electron shell]], each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus.<ref name=shielding>{{cite book|first=Theodore|last=L. Brown|coauthors=H. Eugene LeMay, Jr., Bruce E. Bursten, Julia R. Burdge|year=2003|title=Chemistry: The Central Science|edition=8th|publisher=Pearson Education|location=US|isbn=0-13-061142-5|url=http://www.pearsoneducation.net/brown}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref> In the alkali metals, the [[valence electron|outermost electron]] only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the [[nuclear charge]] (which is equal to the [[atomic number]]) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.<ref name="chemguide"/>

The [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii. This is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different [[electron shell]] than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller. Additionally, the [[effective nuclear charge]] has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.<ref name="rsc"/>

The first ionisation energy of an [[chemical element|element]] or [[molecule]] is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with [[electric charge]] +1. The factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the [[nuclear charge]], the amount of [[shielding effect|shielding]] by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus, which is always an outer electron in [[main group element]]s. The first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels. Since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feel the same effective nuclear charge (+1), the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus. Since this distance increases down the group, the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases.<ref name="chemguide"/> (This trend is broken in francium due to the [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic]] stabilization and contraction of the 7s orbital, bringing francium's valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non-relativistic calculations. This makes francium's outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus, increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium.)<ref name="Uue"/>{{Rp|1729}}<!--Also explain why the alkali metals have the lowest ionization energies in their period.-->

The second ionisation energy of the alkali metals is much higher than the first as the second-most loosely held electron is part of a fully filled [[electron shell]] and is thus difficult to remove.<ref name="rsc"/>

=====Reactivity=====
{{main|Reactivity (chemistry)}}
The reactivities of the alkali metals increase going down the group. This is the result of a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and [[atomisation energy|atomisation energies]] of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in [[chemical reaction]]s, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the [[metallic bond]] of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in [[atomic radius|radius]] and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the [[activation energy]] of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.<ref name="alkaliwater"/>

Electronegativity is a [[chemical property]] that describes the  tendency of an [[atom]] or a [[functional group]] to attract [[electron]]s (or [[electron density]]) towards itself.<ref name="definition">{{GoldBookRef|file=E01990|title=Electronegativity}}</ref> If the bond between [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]] in [[sodium chloride]] were [[covalent bond|covalent]], the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an [[ionic bond]]). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them.<ref name="chemguide"/>

Because of the higher electronegativity of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character. For example, [[lithium iodide]] ([[lithium|Li]][[iodine|I]]) will dissolve in [[organic solvent]]s, a property of most covalent compounds.<ref name="chemguide"/> [[Lithium fluoride]] (Li[[fluorine|F]]) is the only [[alkali halide]] that is not soluble in water,<ref name="rsc"/> and [[lithium hydroxide]] (Li[[hydroxide|OH]]) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not [[deliquescent]].<ref name="rsc"/>

The alkali metals all have the same [[crystal structure]] ([[body-centered cubic|body-centred cubic]])<ref name="Greenwood&Earnshaw"/> and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table.<ref name="chemguide"/> Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water.<ref name="rsc"/>

All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers; hence, their isotopes must be either [[odd-odd nuclei|odd-odd]] (both proton and [[neutron number]] are odd) or [[odd-even nuclei|odd-even]] ([[proton number]] is odd, but neutron number is even). Odd-odd nuclei have even [[mass number]]s, while odd-even nuclei have odd mass numbers. Odd-odd [[primordial nuclide]]s are rare because most odd-odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to [[beta decay]], because the decay products are even-even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to [[Semi-empirical mass formula#Pairing term|nuclear pairing effects]].<ref name="Lide02">{{cite book | author=Various authors|editor-last=Lide |editor-first=David R. | year=2002 | title=Handbook of Chemistry & Physics | edition=88th | publisher=CRC | url=http://www.hbcpnetbase.com/ | accessdate=2008-05-23 | isbn=0-8493-0486-5 | oclc=179976746 }}</ref>

Due to the great rarity of odd-odd nuclei, almost all the primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are odd-even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived [[radioisotope]] potassium-40). For a given odd mass number, there can be only a single [[beta-decay stable isobars|beta-stable nuclide]], since there is not a difference in binding energy between even-odd and odd-even comparable to that between even-even and odd-odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number ([[isobar (nuclide)|isobar]]s) free to [[beta decay]] toward the lowest-mass nuclide. An effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements. Of the 26 [[monoisotopic element]]s that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons. [[Beryllium]] is the single exception to both rules, due to its low atomic number.<ref name="Lide02"/>

Being the first [[period 8 element]], the undiscovered element [[ununennium]] (element 119) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter [[Congener (chemistry)|congener]]s; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties.<ref name="Uue"/>{{rp|1729–1730}} Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium<ref name=EB/> or rubidium<ref name="Uue"/>{{rp|1729–1730}} instead of caesium or francium. This is unusual as [[periodic trends]], ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the [[metallic radius|metallic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic radii]];<ref name="EB"/> this effect is already seen for francium.<ref name="Uue"/>{{rp|1729–1730}} This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic effects.<ref name="tanm"/> The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's [[electron affinity]] far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the [[polarisability]] of ununennium.<ref name="Uue"/>{{rp|1729–1730}} On the other hand, ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group, being expected to have a melting point between 0&nbsp;°C and 30&nbsp;°C.<ref name="Uue"/>{{rp|1724}}

The stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron and thus the contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240&nbsp;[[picometer|pm]],<ref name="Uue"/>{{rp|1729–1730}} very close to that of rubidium (247&nbsp;pm),<ref name="rsc"/> so that the chemistry of ununennium in the +1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium. On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Uue<sup>+</sup> ion is predicted to be larger than that of Rb<sup>+</sup>, because the 7p orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Ununennium may also show the +3 [[oxidation state]],<ref name="Uue"/>{{rp|1729–1730}} which is not seen in any other alkali metal,<ref name="Greenwood&Earnshaw"/>{{rp|28}} in addition to the +1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals: this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the 7p<sub>3/2</sub> spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected.<ref name="Greenwood&Earnshaw"/>{{rp|28}}<ref name="Uue"/>{{rp|1729–1730}} Indeed, many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large [[covalent]] character, due to the involvement of the 7p<sub>3/2</sub> electrons in the bonding.<ref name="Thayer">{{cite book|title=Chemistry of heavier main group elements|last=Thayer|first=John S.|doi=10.1007/9781402099755_2|year=2010|pages=81, 84}}</ref>

Not as much work has been done predicting the properties of the alkali metals beyond ununennium. Although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table would put element 169, unhexennium, under ununennium, Dirac-Fock calculations predict that the next alkali metal after ununennium may actually be element 165, unhexpentium, which is predicted to have the electron configuration [Uuo] 5g<sup>18</sup> 6f<sup>14</sup> 7d<sup>10</sup> 8s<sup>2</sup> 8p<sub>1/2</sub><sup>2</sup> 9s<sup>1</sup>.<ref name="Uue"/>{{rp|1729–1730}}<ref name="pyykko">{{Cite journal|last1=Pyykkö|first1=Pekka|title=A suggested periodic table up to Z ≤ 172, based on Dirac–Fock calculations on atoms and ions|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=13|issue=1|pages=161–8|year=2011|pmid=20967377|doi=10.1039/c0cp01575j|bibcode = 2011PCCP...13..161P }}</ref> Further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend of increasing ionisation energy beyond caesium, having an ionisation energy comparable to that of sodium, and that it should also continue the trend of decreasing atomic radii beyond caesium, having an atomic radius comparable to that of potassium.<ref name="Uue"/>{{rp|1729–1730}} However, the 7d electrons of unhexpentium may also be able to participate in chemical reactions along with the 9s electron, possibly allowing oxidation states beyond +1 and perhaps even making unhexpentium behave more like a [[boron group]] element than an alkali metal.<ref name="Uue"/>{{rp|1732–1733}}

The probable properties of the alkali metals beyond unhexpentium have not been explored yet as of 2012. In periods 8 and above of the periodic table, relativistic and shell-structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate. In addition, the relativistic and shell-structure effects (which stabilise the s-orbitals and destabilise and expand the d-, f-, and g-orbitals of higher shells) have opposite effects, causing even larger difference between relativistic and non-relativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers.<ref name="Uue"/>{{rp|1732–1733}} Due to the alkali and [[alkaline earth metal]]s both being [[s-block]] elements, these predictions for the trends and properties of ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly apply to the corresponding alkaline earth metals [[unbinilium]] (Ubn) and unhexhexium (Uhh).<ref name="Uue"/>{{rp|1729–1733}}

However, Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80&nbsp;keV. Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one that was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure [[actinium]]-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being [[thorium]], [[radium]], [[lead]], [[bismuth]], or [[thallium]]. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, caused by the [[alpha decay]] of actinium-227.<ref name="chemeducator">Adloff, Jean-Pierre; Kaufman, George B.

==Occurrence==

===In the Solar System===
[[Image:SolarSystemAbundances.png|thumb|right|800px|Estimated abundances of the chemical elements in the Solar system. Hydrogen and helium are most common, from the [[Big Bang]]. The next three elements (lithium, [[beryllium]], and [[boron]]) are rare because they are poorly synthesized in the Big Bang and also in stars. The two general trends in the remaining stellar-produced elements are: (1) an alternation of abundance in elements as they have even or odd atomic numbers, and (2) a general decrease in abundance, as elements become heavier. Iron is especially common because it represents the minimum energy nuclide that can be made by fusion of helium in supernovae.<ref name=lodders>{{cite journal | last1 = Lodders | first1 = Katharina | year = 2003 | title = Solar System Abundances and Condensation Temperatures of the Elements | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 591 | issue = 2| pages = 1220–1247 |bibcode = 2003ApJ...591.1220L |doi = 10.1086/375492 }}</ref>]]
The [[Oddo-Harkins rule]] holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers, with the exception of hydrogen. This rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another, thus increasing their atomic number.  In elements with even atomic numbers, protons are paired, with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other, enhancing stability.<ref name=oddo>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/zaac.19140870118 | title = Die Molekularstruktur der radioaktiven Atome | year = 1914 | last1 = Oddo | first1 = Giuseppe | journal = Zeitschrift für anorganische Chemie | volume = 87 | pages = 253}}</ref><ref name=harkins>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja02250a002 | year = 1917 | last1 = Harkins | first1 = William D. | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 856 | title = The Evolution of the Elements and the Stability of Complex Atoms.

===On Earth===
[[File:Spodumene-usa59abg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Spodumene]], an important lithium mineral]]
The [[Earth]] formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the planets acquired different compositions during the [[formation and evolution of the solar system]]. In turn, the [[history of Earth|natural history of the Earth]] caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements. The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98{{e|24}}&nbsp;kg. It is composed mostly of [[iron]] (32.1%), [[oxygen]] (30.1%), [[silicon]] (15.1%), [[magnesium]] (13.9%), [[sulfur]] (2.9%), [[nickel]] (1.8%), [[calcium]] (1.5%), and [[aluminium]] (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to [[mass segregation]], the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.<ref name=pnas71_12_6973>{{cite journal | author=Morgan, J.

The alkali metals, due to their high reactivity, do not occur naturally in pure form in nature. They are [[Goldschmidt classification|lithophiles]] and therefore remain close to the Earth's surface because they combine readily with [[oxygen]] and so associate strongly with [[silica]], forming relatively low-density minerals that do not sink down into the Earth's core. Potassium, rubidium and caesium are also [[incompatible element]]s due to their low [[ionic radius|ionic radii]].<ref name="albarede">{{cite book | title = Geochemistry: an introduction | url = http://books.google.de/books?id=doVGzreGq14C&pg=PA17 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-521-89148-6 | first =Francis | last = Albarède }}</ref>

From their [[silicate]] ores, all the alkali metals may be obtained the same way: [[sulfuric acid]] is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and [[aluminium]](III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the [[aluminium hydroxide|hydroxide]]. The remaining insoluble alkali metal [[carbonate]] is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in [[hydrochloric acid]]. The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated through [[electrolysis]].<ref name=generalchemistry/>

Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with [[calcium chloride]] typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and [[magnesium]] or [[calcium]] for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the alkali metal) then undergoes [[fractional distillation]] for purification.<ref name=generalchemistry/>

==Applications==

All of the discovered alkali metals excluding francium have many applications. Lithium is often used in [[lithium-ion battery|batteries]], and [[lithium oxide]] can help process silica.
