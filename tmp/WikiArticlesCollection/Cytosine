'''Cytosine''' {{IPAc-en|'|s|ai|t|o-|s|i-|n}} ('''C''') is one of the four main bases found in [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], along with [[adenine]], [[guanine]], and [[thymine]] ([[uracil]] in RNA). It is a [[pyrimidine]] derivative, with a [[heterocyclic]] [[aromatic ring]] and two substituents attached (an [[amine]] group at position 4 and a [[Ketone|keto]] group at position 2). The [[nucleoside]] of cytosine is [[cytidine]].  In Watson-Crick [[base pair]]ing, it forms three hydrogen bonds with [[guanine]].

==History==
Cytosine was discovered by [[Albrecht Kossel]] in 1894 when it was hydrolyzed from calf [[thymus]] tissues.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kossel, A.; Steudel, H. Z. | journal = Physiol. Chem. | year = 1903 | volume = 38 | pages = 49 | doi = 10.1515/bchm2.1903.38.1-2.49 | title = Weitere Untersuchungen über das Cytosin}}</ref> A structure was proposed in 1903, and was synthesized (and thus confirmed) in the laboratory in the same year.

Cytosine recently found use in [[quantum computation]]. The first time any [[quantum]] mechanical properties were harnessed to process [[information]] took place on August 1 in 1998 when researchers at Oxford implemented [[David Deutsch|David Deutsch's]] [[Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm|algorithm]] on a two [[qubit]] [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] quantum computer (NMRQC) based on cytosine.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Jones | first = J.A. | coauthors = M.

==Chemical reactions==
[[File:Cytosine chemical structure.svg|thumb|left|100px|Cytosine with numbered components. [[Methylation]] occurs on carbon nr 5.]]
Cytosine can be found as part of DNA, as part of RNA, or as a part of a [[nucleotide]]. As [[cytidine triphosphate]] (CTP), it can act as a co-factor to enzymes, and can transfer a phosphate to convert [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) to [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP).

In DNA and RNA, cytosine is paired with [[guanine]]. However, it is inherently unstable, and can change into [[uracil]] ([[deamination|spontaneous deamination]]). This can lead to a [[point mutation]] if not repaired by the [[DNA repair]] [[enzyme]]s such as uracil glycosylase, which cleaves a uracil in DNA. 

Cytosine can also be [[Methylation|methylated]] into [[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosine]] by an enzyme called [[DNA methyltransferase]] or be methylated and [[Hydroxylation|hydroxylated]] to make [[5-Hydroxymethylcytosine|5-hydroxymethylcytosine]].
Active enzymatic deamination of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine by the [[APOBEC]] family of cytosine deaminases could have both beneficial and detrimental implications on various cellular processes as well as on organismal evolution.<ref name="Chahwan">{{cite journal| author= Chahwan R., Wontakal S.N., and Roa S.| title=Crosstalk between genetic and epigenetic information through cytosine deamination| journal=Trends in Genetics| volume = 26| pages = 443–448| year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2010.07.005| pmid = 20800313| issue = 10}}</ref> The implications of deamination on 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, on the other hand, remains less understood.
