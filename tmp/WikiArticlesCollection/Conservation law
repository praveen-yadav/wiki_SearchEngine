In [[physics]], a '''conservation law''' states that a particular measurable property of an isolated [[physical system]] does not change as the system evolves. 

One particularly important physical result concerning conservation laws is [[Noether's theorem]], which states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between conservation laws and differentiable [[symmetry in physics|symmetries of physical systems]].  For example, the conservation of energy follows from the time-invariance of physical systems, and the fact that physical systems behave the same regardless of how they are oriented in space gives rise to the conservation of angular momentum.

==Exact laws==

A partial listing of conservation laws that are said to be '''exact laws''', or more precisely ''have never been [proven] to be violated:''
* [[Conservation of mass-energy]]
* [[Conservation of linear momentum]]
* [[Conservation of angular momentum]]
* [[charge conservation|Conservation of electric charge]]
* Conservation of [[color charge]]
* Conservation of [[weak isospin]]
* [[Probability current|Conservation of probability]]
* [[CPT symmetry]] (combining charge, parity and time conjugation)
* [[Lorentz symmetry]]

==Approximate laws==

There are also '''approximate''' conservation laws.  These are approximately true in particular situations, such as low speeds, short time scales, or certain interactions.  

* [[Conservation of mass]] (applies for non-relativistic speeds and when there are no [[nuclear reaction]]s)
* Conservation of [[baryon number]] (See [[chiral anomaly]])
* Conservation of [[lepton number]] (In the [[Standard Model]])
* Conservation of [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]] (violated by the [[weak interaction]])
* Conservation of [[parity (physics)|parity]]
* Invariance under [[Charge conjugation]]
* Invariance under [[T-symmetry|time reversal]]
* [[CP symmetry]], the combination of charge and parity conjugation (equivalent to time reversal if CPT holds)
