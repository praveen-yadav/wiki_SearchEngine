==Etymology and uncertain meanings==
The Irish word {{lang|ga|''crannóg''}} derives from [[Old Irish]] {{lang|sga|''crannóc''}},<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=2009 |title=Crannog |encyclopedia=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/crannog}}</ref> which referred to a wooden structure or vessel, stemming from ''crann'', which means "tree", plus a [[diminutive]] ending—literally "young tree".<ref name=Fredengren>{{cite book|last=Fredengren |first=Christina |year=2002 |title=Crannogs: A Study of People's Interaction with Lakes, with Special Reference to Loch Gara in the North West of Ireland |publisher=Wordwell |location=Bray}}</ref> The modern sense of the term first appears sometime around the 12th century; its popularity spread in the medieval period along with the terms ''isle'', ''ylle'', ''inis'', ''eilean'', ''oileán''.<ref name=Morrison /><ref>{{cite book|title=A New History of Ireland: Prehistoric and early Ireland |first1=Dáibhí |last1=Ó Cróinín |authorlink1=Dáibhí Ó Cróinín |first2=Theodore William |last2=Moody |authorlink2=Theodore William Moody |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-19-821737-4}}</ref> There is some confusion on what the term ''crannog'' originally referred to, the structure atop the island or the island itself.<ref name=Morrison /> The additional meanings of 'crannog' can be variously related as "structure/piece of wood; wooden pin; [[crow's nest]]; [[pulpit]]; driver's box on a coach and vessel/box/chest" for crannóg.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dinneen |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick S.

==Types and problems with definition==
[[File:Crannog Loch Tay.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Replica Crannóg on [[Loch Tay]]]]Crannogs took on many different forms and methods of construction based on what was available in the immediate landscape. The classic image of a prehistoric crannog stems from both post-medieval illustrations<ref name="O'Sullivan 1998" /> and highly influential excavations such as Milton Loch in Scotland by C.M. Piggot after World War II.<ref name=Piggott>{{cite journal|last=Piggott |first=C.&nbsp;M. |year=1953 |title=Milton Loch Crannog: a native house of the second century AD in Kirkcudbrightshire |journal=Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland |volume=87 |pages=134–52}}</ref> The Milton Loch interpretation is of a small islet surrounded or defined at its edges by timber piles and a gangway, topped by a typical Iron Age roundhouse. The choice of a small islet as a home may seem odd today, yet waterways were the main channels for both communication and travel until the 19th century in much of Ireland and especially Highland Scotland. Crannogs are traditionally interpreted as simple prehistorical farmsteads. They are also interpreted as boltholes in times of danger, as status symbols with limited access and as inherited locations of power which imply a sense of legitimacy and ancestry towards ownership of the surrounding landscape.

A strict definition of a crannog, which has long been debated, requires the use of timber.<ref name=Lynn /> Sites in the Western Isles do not satisfy this criterion, although their inhabitants shared the common habit of living on water.<ref name=Lynn /><ref name="Harding 2000" /> If not classed as "true" crannogs, small occupied islets (often at least partially artificial in nature) may be referred to as "island duns",<ref name="Armit 1996" /> although rather confusingly, 22 islet-based sites are classified as "proper" crannogs due to the different interpretations of the inspectors or excavators who drew up field reports [http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/results/?sitename=&site_type_term=CRANNOG+&site_discipline=1&numlink=&mapno=&site=&council_code=410&parish=&region_code=&district_code=&county_code=&ngr=&locat_xy_radius_m=&collection_name=&biblio_surname=&biblio_inits=&biblio_title=&biblio_date=&biblio_journal=&site_country=1&submit=Search Canmore search for crannog in the Western Isles] Hebridean island dwellings or crannogs were commonly built on both natural and artificial islets, usually reached by a stone causeway. The visible structural remains are traditionally interpreted<ref name="Beveridge, E 1911">Beveridge, E. 1911. North Uist: Its Archaeology and Topography, William Brown, Edinburgh.</ref> as [[dun]]s, or in more recent terminology as "Atlantic roundhouses". This terminology has recently become popular when describing the entire range of robust, drystone structures which exist in later prehistoric Atlantic Scotland.<ref name="Armit 1992" />

The majority of crannog excavations were poorly conducted (by modern standards) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by early antiquarians, or were indeed purely accidental finds as lochs were drained during the improvements to increase usable farmland or pasture.<ref name="Munro Ancient" /><ref>Wilde, W.R. 1840. ‘Antiquities recently discovered at Dunshanghlin’ Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. 1 pp.420-426.</ref><ref>Wilson, G. 1873. ‘Notes on the crannogs and lake dwellings of Wigtownshire’, Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, vol. 9, pp. 368-378.</ref><ref>Thomas, F.W.L. 1890. ‘On the Duns of the Outer Hebrides’ in: Archaeologica Scotia, vol. 5, pp. 365-415.</ref><ref>Steurt, J. 1865. ‘Notices of a Group of Artificial Islands in the Loch of Dowalton, Wigtownshire, and of other Artificial Islands or Crannogs throughout Scotland’ in Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, vol.VI, pp. 114-188.</ref><ref>Smith, J. 1894.

Preservation and conservation techniques for waterlogged materials such as logboats or structural material were all but non-existent, and a number of extremely important finds perished as a result: in some instances dried out for firewood.<ref name="Munro Ancient" /> From about 1900 to the late 1940s there was very little crannog excavation in Scotland, while Ireland did witness some important and highly influential contributions.<ref>Hencken, H.

Thus the re-occupiers may have viewed crannogs as a legacy that remained alive in local tradition and memory. Crannog reoccupation is important and significant, especially in the many instances of crannogs built near natural islets that were often completely unused.
This long chronology of use has been verified both by radiocarbon dating and more precisely by dendrochronology.<ref name="Crone, B. A 2000"/> Interpretations of crannog function are not static through time; instead they appear to change in both the archaeological and historic records. Rather than largely simple domestic residences in prehistory, medieval crannogs were increasingly seen as strongholds of the upper class or regional 'political players' such as Gaelic chieftains like the O'Boylans and McMahons in County [[Monaghan]] and the Kingdom of [[Airgíalla]] until the 17th century. In Scotland, their medieval and post-medieval use is also documented into the early 18th century.<ref name="Dixon 2004" /><ref name=Morrison /> Whether this increase in 'status' is real, or just a by-product of increasingly complex material assemblages remains to be convincingly validated.<ref name=Fredengren />

==History==
The earliest construction of a crannog is the completely artificial Neolithic islet of [[Eilean Domhnuill]], Loch Olabhat on [[North Uist]] in Scotland. Eilean Domhnuill<ref name="Armit 1996" /> has produced radiocarbon dates ranging from 3650 to 2500 BC<ref name="Armit 2003" /> while Irish crannogs appear from middle Bronze Age layers at Ballinderry (1200–600 BC).<ref>national handbook of underwater archaeology By Carol Ruppé, Jan Barstadch</ref> Prior to the Bronze Age, the existence of artificial island settlement in Ireland is not as clear. While lakeside settlements are evident in Ireland from 4500 BC, these settlements are not crannogs as they were not intended to be islands. Despite having a tremendous chronology{{clarify|date=October 2013}}, their use was not at all consistent or unchanging. Crannog construction and occupation was at its peak in Scotland from about 800 BC to AD 200.<ref name="Henderson 1998" /> Not surprisingly, crannogs have useful defensive properties, although there appears to be more significance to prehistoric use than simple defense as very few weapons or evidence for destruction appear in excavations of prehistoric crannogs. In Ireland, crannogs were at their zenith during the Early Historic period<ref name="O'Sullivan 2000" /> when they were the homes and retreats of kings, lords, prosperous farmers and occasionally socially marginalised groups such as monastic hermits or metalsmiths who could work in isolation. However, despite earlier concepts of a strict Early Historic evolution,<ref name=Lynn /> Irish excavations are increasingly uncovering examples which date from the "missing" Iron Age in Ireland.<ref name="O'Sullivan & Sands" />

==Construction==
[[File:Loughbrickland Crannog.jpg|thumb|[[Loughbrickland Crannóg]] in [[Northern Ireland]].]]
The construction techniques for a crannog (prehistoric or otherwise) are as varied as the multitude of finished forms witnessed in the archaeological record. Island settlement in Scotland and Ireland is manifest through the entire range of possibilities ranging from entirely natural, small islets to completely artificial islets, therefore definitions will invariably remain contentious. For 'crannogs' in the strict sense, typically this effort began on a shallow reef or rise in the lochbed. When timber was available, many were surrounded by a circle of wooden [[Deep foundation|piles]] with axe-sharpened bases that were driven into the bottom, forming a circular enclosure that helped to retain the main mound and prevent erosion. The piles could also be joined together by [[mortise and tenon]], or large holes cut to carefully accept specially shaped timbers designed to interlock together and provide structural rigidity. On other examples, interior surfaces were built up with any mixture of clay, peat, stone, timber or brush- whatever was available. In some instances, more than one structure was built on crannogs.<ref name="Armit 2003" /> Other types of crannogs saw the occupants add large stones to the waterline of small natural islets, extending and enlarging them over successive phases of renewal. Larger crannogs could be occupied by extended families or communal groups, and access was either by logboats or coracles while evidence for timber or stone causeways exists on a large number of crannogs. The causeways themselves may have been slightly submerged; this has been interpreted as a device to make access difficult<ref name="Beveridge, E 1911"/> yet this can also simply be a by-product of loch level fluctuations over the ensuing centuries or indeed millennia. Organic remains are often found in excellent condition on these water-logged sites. The bones of [[cattle]], [[deer]], and [[Pig|swine]] have been found in excavated crannogs while remains of wooden utensils and even dairy products can remain completely preserved for several millennia.<ref name="Dixon 2004" />
