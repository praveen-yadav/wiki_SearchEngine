'''Sir Charles Lyell, 1st Baronet''', [[Knight Bachelor|Kt]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (14 November 1797 – 22 February 1875) was a British lawyer and the foremost geologist of his day. He is best known as the author of ''[[Principles of Geology]]'', which popularised [[James Hutton]]'s concepts of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]]&nbsp;– the idea that the earth was shaped by the same processes still in operation today. Lyell was also one of the first to believe that the world is older than 300 million years, on the basis of its geological anomalies. Lyell was a close and influential friend of [[Charles Darwin]].

==Biography==
Lyell was born in [[Scotland]] about 15 miles north of [[Dundee]] in Kinnordy, near [[Kirriemuir]] in [[Forfarshire]] (now in [[Angus]]). He was the eldest of ten children. Lyell's father, also named Charles, was a lawyer and [[botanist]] of minor repute: it was he who first exposed his son to the study of nature.
[[Image:Scotland (Location) Named (HR).png|thumb|The main geographical <br>divisions of Scotland]]

The house/place of his birth is located in the north-west of the [[Central Lowlands]] in the valley of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]]. Round the house, in the [[rift valley]], is farmland, but within a short distance to the north-west, on the other side of the fault, are the [[Grampian Mountains]] in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]].<ref>[[Google maps]], including terrain and satellite.</ref> His family's second home was in a completely different geological and ecological area: he spent much of his childhood at [[Bartley Lodge]] in the [[New Forest]], England.

Lyell entered [[Exeter College, Oxford]] in 1816, and attended [[William Buckland]]'s lectures. He graduated BA second class in classics, December 1819, and [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] 1821.<ref name = "czscax" />{{sfn|Wilson|1973}}
After graduation he took up law as a profession, entering [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1820. He completed a circuit through rural England, where he could observe geological phenomena. In 1821 he attended [[Robert Jameson]]'s lectures in Edinburgh, and visited [[Gideon Mantell]] at [[Lewes]], in [[Sussex]]. In 1823 he was elected joint secretary of the [[Geological Society]]. As his eyesight began to deteriorate, he turned to geology as a full-time profession.{{sfn|Wilson|1973}} His first paper, "On a recent formation of freshwater limestone in Forfarshire", was presented in 1822.{{sfn|Wilson|1973}} By 1827, he had abandoned law and embarked on a geological career that would result in fame and the general acceptance of uniformitarianism, a working out of the ideas proposed by [[James Hutton]] a few decades earlier.

[[File:Lyell 1840.jpg|left|thumb|Charles Lyell at the [[British Association]] meeting in Glasgow 1840. Painting by Alexander Craig.]]
In 1832, Lyell married [[Mary Horner]] of Bonn, daughter of [[Leonard Horner]] (1785–1864), also associated with the [[Geological Society of London]]. The new couple spent their honeymoon in Switzerland and Italy on a geological tour of the area.{{sfn|MaComber|1997}}

During the 1840s, Lyell travelled to the United States and Canada, and wrote two popular travel-and-geology books: ''Travels in North America'' (1845) and ''A Second Visit to the United States'' (1849). After the [[Great Chicago Fire]], Lyell was one of the first to donate books to help found the [[Chicago Public Library]]. In 1866, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

Lyell's wife died in 1873, and two years later (in 1875) Lyell himself died as he was revising the twelfth edition of ''Principles''. He is buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].{{sfn|MaComber|1997}}{{sfn|Westminster Abbey}} Lyell was knighted ([[Knight Bachelor|Kt]]) in 1848,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=20905 |date=13 October 1848 |startpage=3692}}</ref> and later, in 1864, made a baronet ([[Baronet|Bt]]),<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=22878 |date=22 July 1864 |startpage=3665}}</ref> which is an hereditary honour. He was awarded the [[Copley Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1858 and the [[Wollaston Medal]] of the [[Geological Society]] in 1866. [[Mount Lyell (California)|Mount Lyell]], the highest peak in [[Yosemite National Park]], is named after him; the crater [[Lyell (lunar crater)|Lyell]] on the [[Moon]] and a [[Impact crater|crater]] on [[Mars]] were named in his honour; [[Mount Lyell (Tasmania)|Mount Lyell]] in western Tasmania, Australia, located in a profitable mining area, bears Lyell's name; and the Lyell Range in north-west Western Australia is named for him as well. The jawless fish ''[[Cephalaspis|Cephalaspis lyelli]]'', from the [[Old Red Sandstone]] of southern Scotland, was named by [[Louis Agassiz]] in honour of Lyell.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/species-of-the-day/evolution/cephalaspis-lyelli/index.html | title=Cephalaspis lyelli | publisher=The Natural History Museum | year=2013 | accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref>

==Career and major writings==
Lyell had private means, and earned further income as an author. He came from a prosperous family, worked briefly as a lawyer in the 1820s, and held the post of Professor of Geology at [[King's College London]] in the 1830s. From 1830 onward his books provided both income and fame. Each of his three major books was a work continually in progress. All three went through multiple editions during his lifetime, although many of his friends (such as Darwin) thought the first edition of the ''Principles'' was the best written.<ref>{{cite book|last=Darwin |first=F. |year=1887|title= Life and letters of Charles Darwin|volume= II |page= 90|location= London|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Darwin |first=F |last2=Seward |first2=A.C.|year=1903|title=More letters of Charles Darwin|volume=II |page= 232 |location=London.|ref=harv}}</ref> Lyell used each edition to incorporate additional material, rearrange existing material, and revisit old conclusions in light of new evidence.

[[File:Sir Charles Lyell, 1st Bt.jpg|thumb|Lyell between 1865 and 1870]]

''[[Principles of Geology]]'', Lyell's first book, was also his most famous, most influential, and most important. First published in three volumes in 1830–33, it established Lyell's credentials as an important geological theorist and propounded the doctrine of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]].{{sfn|Thanukos|2012}} It was a work of synthesis, backed by his own personal observations on his travels.

The central argument in ''Principles'' was that ''the present is the key to the past''&nbsp;– a concept of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] which [[David Hume]] had stated as "all inferences from experience suppose&nbsp;... that the future will resemble the past", and [[James Hutton]] had described when he wrote in 1788 that "from what has actually been, we have data for concluding with regard to that which is to happen thereafter."<ref name="KEY TO THE PAST">{{cite web |url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2002CD/finalprogram/abstract_34786.htm |title=The Present is the Key to the Past is the Key to the Future |first==Elizabeth Lincoln |last=Mathieson |month=13 May|year= 2002|publisher=The Geological Society of America |accessdate=28 September 2010|ref=harv}}</ref> Geological remains from the distant past can, and should, be explained by reference to geological processes now in operation and thus directly observable. Lyell's interpretation of geologic change as the steady accumulation of minute changes over enormously long spans of time was a powerful influence on the young [[Charles Darwin]]. Lyell asked [[Robert FitzRoy]], captain of [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']], to search for erratic boulders on the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|survey voyage of the ''Beagle'']], and just before it set out FitzRoy gave Darwin Volume 1 of the first edition of Lyell's ''Principles''. When the ''Beagle'' made its first stop ashore at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|St Jago]], Darwin found rock formations which seen "through Lyell's eyes" gave him a revolutionary insight into the geological history of the island, an insight he applied throughout his travels.

While in South America Darwin received Volume 2 which considered the ideas of [[Lamarck]] in some detail. Lyell rejected Lamarck's idea of organic [[evolution]], proposing instead "Centres of Creation" to explain diversity and territory of species. However, as discussed [[Charles Lyell#Evolution|below]], many of his letters show he was fairly open to the idea of evolution.<ref>Judd gives a number of examples: Judd J.W. 1910. ''The coming of evolution''. Cambridge.</ref> In geology Darwin was very much Lyell's disciple, and brought back observations and his own original theorising, including ideas about the formation of [[atoll]]s, which supported Lyell's uniformitarianism. On the return of the ''Beagle'' (October 1836) Lyell invited Darwin to dinner and from then on they were close friends. Although Darwin discussed evolutionary ideas with him from 1842, Lyell continued to reject evolution in each of the first nine editions of the ''Principles''. He encouraged Darwin to publish, and following the 1859 publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', Lyell finally offered a tepid endorsement of evolution in the tenth edition of ''Principles''.

[[File:Lyell Principles frontispiece.jpg|thumb|The frontispiece from ''Elements of Geology'']]

''[[Elements of Geology]]'' began as the fourth volume of the third edition of ''[[Principles of Geology|Principles]]'': Lyell intended the book to act as a suitable field guide for students of geology.<ref name = "czscax">Bailey, Edward 1962. ''Charles Lyell''. Nelson, London.</ref> The systematic, factual description of geological formations of different ages contained in ''Principles'' grew so unwieldy, however, that Lyell split it off as the ''Elements'' in 1838. The book went through six editions, eventually growing to two volumes and ceasing to be the inexpensive, portable handbook that Lyell had originally envisioned. Late in his career, therefore, Lyell produced a condensed version titled ''Student's Elements of Geology'' that fulfilled the original purpose.

''[[Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man]]'' brought together Lyell's views on three key themes from the geology of the [[Quaternary Period]] of Earth history: glaciers, evolution, and the [[age of the human race]]. First published in 1863, it went through three editions that year, with a fourth and final edition appearing in 1873. The book was widely regarded as a disappointment because of Lyell's equivocal treatment of [[evolution]]. Lyell, a devout Christian, had great difficulty reconciling his beliefs with [[natural selection]].<ref name="Bynum W.F 1984">{{cite journal|author=Bynum W.F. |year=1984|title=Charles Lyell's ''Antiquity of Man'' and its critics|journal=J. Hist Biol|volume=17|pages=153–187|jstor=4330890|issue=2|doi=10.1007/BF00143731}}</ref>

==Scientific contributions==
Lyell's geological interests ranged from [[volcano]]es and geological dynamics through [[stratigraphy]], [[palaeontology]], and [[glaciology]] to topics that would now be classified as [[archaeology|prehistoric archaeology]] and [[paleoanthropology]]. He is best known, however, for his role in popularising the doctrine of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]].

===Uniformitarianism===
From 1830 to 1833 his multi-volume ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' was published. The work's subtitle was "An attempt to explain the former changes of the Earth's surface by reference to causes now in operation", and this explains Lyell's impact on science. He drew his explanations from field studies conducted directly before he went to work on the founding geology text.{{sfn|Wilson|1973}} He was, along with the earlier [[John Playfair]], the major advocate of [[James Hutton]]'s idea of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], that the earth was shaped entirely by slow-moving forces still in operation today, acting over a very long period of time. This was in contrast to [[catastrophism]], a geologic idea of abrupt changes, which had been adapted in England to support belief in [[Deluge (mythology)|Noah's flood]]. Describing the importance of uniformitarianism on contemporary geology, Lyell wrote,

<blockquote>Never was there a doctrine more calculated to foster indolence, and to blunt the keen edge of curiosity, than this assumption of the discordance between the former and the existing causes of change... The student was taught to despond from the first. Geology, it was affirmed, could never arise to the rank of an exact science... [With catastrophism] we see the ancient spirit of speculation revived, and a desire manifestly shown to cut, rather than patiently untie, the Gordian Knot.<small>-Sir Charles Lyell, ''[[Principles of Geology]]'', 1854 edition, p.196; quoted by [[Stephen Jay Gould]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Galilei|first=Galileo|title=Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems|year=2001|publisher=Modern Science Library|location=New York|pages=ix–x|editor=Stephen Jay Gould}}</ref></small></blockquote>

Lyell saw himself as "the spiritual saviour of geology, freeing the science from the old dispensation of Moses."{{sfn|Porter|1956|p=91}} The two terms, ''uniformitarianism'' and ''catastrophism'', were both coined by [[William Whewell]];<ref>Whewell, William 1837. ''History of the Inductive Sciences'', vol. IV of the Historical and Philosophical Works of William Whewell. Chapter VIII The two antagonistic doctrines of geology. [reprint of 3rd edition of 1857, publ. Cass 1967].</ref> in 1866 R. Grove suggested the simpler term ''continuity'' for Lyell's view, but the old terms persisted. In various revised editions (12 in all, through 1872), ''Principles of Geology'' was the most influential geological work in the middle of the 19th century, and did much to put geology on a modern footing. For his efforts he was knighted in 1848, then made a baronet in 1864.

===Geological Surveys===
Lyell noted the "economic advantages" that geological surveys could provide, citing their felicity in mineral-rich countries and provinces. Modern surveys, like the [[US Geological Survey]], map and exhibit the natural resources within the country. So, in endorsing surveys, as well as advancing the study of geology, Lyell helped to forward the business of modern extractive industries, such as the coal and oil industry.

===Volcanoes and geological dynamics===
[[File:Vesuvius from plane.jpg|thumb|An aerial photo of Vesuvius]]
Before the work of Lyell, phenomena such as earthquakes were understood by the destruction that they brought. One of the contributions that Lyell made in ''Principles'' was to explain the cause of earthquakes.<ref name = "byaztm">Adams, Frank D. ''The Birth and Development of the Geological Sciences''. Dover Publications, Inc., 1938.</ref> Lyell, in contrast focused on recent earthquakes (150 yrs), evidenced by surface irregularities such as faults, fissures, stratigraphic displacements and depressions.<ref name = "byaztm" /><br />
Lyell's work on volcanoes focused largely on [[Vesuvius]] and [[Mount Etna|Etna]], both of which he had earlier studied. His conclusions supported gradual building of volcanoes, so-called "backed up-building",<ref name = "czscax" /> as opposed to the upheaval argument supported by other geologists.

===Stratigraphy===
Lyell's most important specific work was in the field of [[stratigraphy]]. From May 1828, until February 1829, he travelled with [[Roderick Impey Murchison]] (1792–1871) to the south of France (Auvergne volcanic district) and to Italy.<ref name = "czscax" />{{sfn|MaComber|1997}}<ref>Stafford, Robert A. ''Scientist of Empire.'' Cambridge, UK. Cambridge University Press, 1989.</ref> In these areas he concluded that the recent strata (rock layers) could be categorised according to the number and proportion of marine shells encased within. Based on this he proposed dividing the [[Tertiary]] period into three parts, which he named the [[Pliocene]], [[Miocene]], and [[Eocene]]. He also renamed the traditional ''Primary'', ''Secondary'' and ''Tertiary'' periods (now called [[Era (geology)|eras]]) to [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]], which nomenclature was gradually accepted worldwide.

===Glaciers===
[[File:glacier.zermatt.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|Lateral moraine on a glacier joining the Gorner Glacier, Zermatt, Switzerland.]]
In ''Principles of Geology'' (first edition, vol. 3, Ch. 2, 1833){{sfn|MaComber|1997}} Lyell proposed that [[iceberg]]s could be the means of transport for [[Glacial erratic|erratics]]. During periods of global warming, ice breaks off the poles and floats across submerged continents, carrying debris with it, he conjectured. When the iceberg melts, it rains down sediments upon the land. Because this theory could account for the presence of diluvium, the word ''drift'' became the preferred term for the loose, unsorted material, today called ''till''. Furthermore, Lyell believed that the accumulation of fine angular particles covering much of the world (today called [[loess]]) was a deposit settled from mountain flood water. Today some of Lyell's mechanisms for geologic processes have been disproven, though many have stood the test of time.{{sfn|Wilson|1973}} His observational methods and general analytical framework remain in use today as foundational principles in geology.{{sfn|Wilson|1973}}

===Evolution===
Lyell first received a copy of one of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]]'s books from [[Gideon Mantell|Mantell]] in 1827, when he was on circuit. He thanked Mantell in a letter which includes this enthusiastic passage:
:"I devoured Lamark... his theories delighted me... I am glad that he has been courageous enough and logical enough to admit that his argument, if pushed as far as it must go, if worth anything, would prove that men may have come from the [[Orangutan|Ourang-Outang]]. But after all, what changes species may really undergo!... That the Earth is quite as old as he supposes, has long been my creed..."<ref>Lyell K. 1881. ''The life and letters of Sir Charles Lyell''. 2 vols, London. vol. 1 p. 168</ref>

[[File:Charles Darwin.jpg|left|thumb|Charles Darwin]]

In the second volume of the first edition of ''Principles'' Lyell explicitly rejected the ''mechanism'' of Lamark on the [[transmutation of species]], and was doubtful whether species were mutable.<ref>Lyell C. 1830–33. ''The principles of geology''. Murray, London. vol. 2, Chapter 2.</ref> However, privately, in letters, he was more open to the possibility of [[evolution]]:
:"If I had stated... the possibility of the introduction or origination of fresh species being a natural, in contradistinction to a miraculous process, I should have raised a host of prejudices against me, which are unfortunately opposed at every step to any philosopher who attempts to address the public on these mysterious subjects".<ref>Lyell to [[William Whewell]], 7 March 1837. In Lyell K. 1881. ''The life and letters of Sir Charles Lyell''. 2 vols, London. vol. 2 p. 5</ref>

This letter makes it clear that his equivocation on evolution was, at least at first, a deliberate tactic. As a result of his letters and, no doubt, personal conversations, [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] and [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]] were convinced that, at the time he wrote ''Principles'', he believed new species had arisen by natural methods. Both [[William Whewell|Whewell]] and [[Adam Sedgwick|Sedgwick]] wrote worried letters to him about this.<ref>Judd J.W. 1910. ''The coming of evolution''. Cambridge. Chapter 8, pp. 83–86.</ref>

Later, [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] became a close personal friend, and Lyell was one of the first scientists to support ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', though he did not subscribe to all its contents. Lyell was also a friend of Darwin's closest colleagues, [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]], but unlike them he struggled to square his religious beliefs with evolution. This inner struggle has been much commented on. He had particular difficulty in believing in [[natural selection]] as the main motive force in evolution.<ref>Bowler P.J. 2003.

[[File:Alfred Russel Wallace 1862 - Project Gutenberg eText 15997.png|thumb|upright|[[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in 1862.]]

Lyell and Hooker were instrumental in arranging the peaceful co-publication of the theory of natural selection by Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in 1858: each had arrived at the theory independently. Lyell's data on [[stratigraphy]] were important because Darwin thought that populations of an organism changed slowly, requiring "geologic time".

Although Lyell did not publicly accept evolution (descent with modification) at the time of writing the ''Principles'',<ref>Lyell C. 1830–33. ''The principles of geology''. Murray, London. vol. 2, pp. 20–21.</ref> after the Darwin–Wallace papers and the ''Origin'' Lyell wrote in his notebook:
:3 May 1860: "Mr. Darwin has written a work which will constitute an era in geology & natural history to show that... the descendants of common parents may become in the course of ages so unlike each other as to be entitled to rank as a distinct species, from each other or from some of their progenitors".<ref>Wilson, Leonard G. (ed) 1970. ''Sir Charles Lyell's scientific journals on the species question''. Yale University Press. p. 407</ref>

Lyell's acceptance of natural selection, Darwin's proposed mechanism for evolution, was equivocal, and came in the tenth edition of ''Principles''.{{sfn|Wilson|1973}}<ref>[[Adrian Desmond|Desmond A.]] 1982. ''Archetypes and Ancestors: palaeontology in Victorian London'' Blond & Briggs, London. page 179: "Even Charles Lyell agreed... that 'natural selection was a force quite subordinate to that variety-making or creative power to which all the wonders of the organic world must be referred.' "</ref> ''[[The Antiquity of Man]]'' (published in early February 1863, just before Huxley's ''Man's place in nature'') drew these comments from Darwin to Huxley:
:"I am fearfully disappointed at Lyell's excessive caution" and "The book is a mere 'digest' ".<ref>Burkhardt F. and Smith S. 1982–present. ''The correspondence of Charles Darwin.'' Cambridge, vol. 11, pp. 173, 181.</ref>
Quite strong remarks: no doubt Darwin resented Lyell's repeated suggestion that he owed a lot to [[Lamarck]], whom he (Darwin) had always specifically rejected. Darwin's daughter Henrietta (Etty) wrote to her father: "Is it fair that Lyell always calls your theory a modification of Lamarck's?" <ref>Burkhardt F. and Smith S. 1982–present. ''The correspondence of Charles Darwin.'' Cambridge, vol. 11, p. 223.</ref><ref>Cape, ISBN 1-84413-314-1 Browne, E. Janet 2002. ''Charles Darwin: the power of place. Volume 2 of a biography''. Cape, London. page 219</ref>

In other respects ''Antiquity'' was a success. It sold well, and it "shattered the tacit agreement that mankind should be the sole preserve of theologians and historians".<ref>Browne, E. Janet 2002. ''Charles Darwin: the power of place. Volume 2 of a biography''. Cape, London. p. 218</ref> But when Lyell wrote that it remained a profound mystery how the huge gulf between man and beast could be bridged, Darwin wrote "Oh!" in the margin of his copy.<ref name="Bynum W.F 1984" />
