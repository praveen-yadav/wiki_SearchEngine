In 1795, following the [[Northwest Indian War]], an area that was to be part of Chicago was turned over to the United States for a military post by native tribes in accordance with the [[Treaty of Greenville]]. In 1803, the [[United States Army]] built [[Fort Dearborn]], which was destroyed in the [[War of 1812]], [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]] and later rebuilt.{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=16-17}} The [[Odawa people|Ottawa]], [[Ojibwe]], and Potawatomi tribes had ceded additional land to the United States in the 1816 [[Treaty of St.&nbsp;Louis]].

On August 12, 1833, the Town of Chicago was organized with a population of around 200.<ref name="Timeline: Early Chicago History"/> Within seven years it would grow to a population of over 4,000. On June 15, 1835, the first public land sales commenced with [[Edmund Dick Taylor]] as U.S. receiver of public moneys.

As the site of the [[Chicago Portage]],{{sfnp|Keating|2005|p=27}} the city emerged as an important transportation hub between the eastern and western United States. Chicago's first railway, [[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]], opened in 1848, which also marked the opening of the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]]. The canal allowed steamboats and sailing ships on the [[Great Lakes]] to connect to the [[Mississippi River]].{{sfnp|Buisseret|1990|pp=86-98}}<ref>{{cite book| last = Condit| first = Carl W.| title = Chicago 1910–29, Building, Planning, and Urban Technology| year = 1973| publisher = The University of Chicago Press| isbn = 0-226-11456-2| lccn = 72-94791| pages = 30–31 }}</ref>{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=24-25}}{{sfnp|Keating|2005|pp=26-29, 35-39}}

A flourishing economy brought residents from rural communities and [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] from abroad. Manufacturing and retail and finance sectors became dominant, influencing the American economy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Conzen|first=Michael|title=Global Chicago|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/277.html|work=The Economic Rivalry between St. Louis and Chicago|publisher=Encyclopedia of Chicago}}</ref> The [[Chicago Board of Trade]] (established 1848) listed the first ever standardized 'exchange traded' forward contracts, which were called [[futures contract]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmegroup.com/company/history/timeline-of-achievements.html |title=Timeline-of-achievements |publisher=[[CME Group]]|accessdate=2013-01-20}}</ref>
 
In the 1850s Chicago gained national political prominence as the home of Senator [[Stephen Douglas]], the champion of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] and "popular sovereignty" approach to the issue of the spread of slavery.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stephen Douglas|url=http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/spcl/excat/douglas5.html|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=2011-05-29}}</ref> These issues also helped propel another Illinoisan, [[Abraham Lincoln]], to the national stage. Lincoln was nominated in Chicago for the nation's presidency at the [[1860 Republican National Convention]] and went on to defeat Douglas in the general election, setting the stage for the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lincoln nominated for presidency|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lincoln-nominated-for-presidency|work=History Channel|publisher=A&E Television Networks|accessdate=2013-04-11}}</ref>

To accommodate [[Chicago#Demographics|rapid population growth]] and demand for better sanitation, the city implemented various infrastructural improvements. In February 1856, the [[Ellis S. Chesbrough|Chesbrough]] plan for the building of the United States' first comprehensive sewerage system was approved by the Common Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nike-of-samothrace.net/chn.html#y1856_m02_d14 |title=Chicago Daily Tribune, Thursday Morning, February 14 |publisher=nike-of-samothrace.net |accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> The project [[Raising of Chicago|raised much of central Chicago]] to a new grade. While raising Chicago, and at first improving the health of the city, the untreated sewage and industrial waste now flowed into the [[Chicago River]], then into [[Lake Michigan]], polluting the primary source of fresh water for the city.
The city responded by tunneling two miles (3&nbsp;km) out into Lake Michigan to newly built [[water crib]]s. In 1900, the problem of sewage contamination was largely resolved when the city completed a major engineering feat. It reversed the flow of the Chicago River so that the water flowed away from Lake Michigan rather than into it. This project began with the construction and improvement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and was completed with the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]] that connects to the [[Illinois River]], which flows into the [[Mississippi River]].{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=15-18, 243-245}}{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=27-29, 38-43}}{{sfnp|Buisseret|1990|pp=154-155, 172-173, 204-205}}

Chicago's flourishing economy attracted huge numbers of new immigrants from [[Europe]] and migrants from the eastern states. Of the total population in 1900 no less than 77% were foreign-born, or born in the United States of foreign parentage. [[Germans]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Poles]], [[Swedes]] and [[Czechs]] made up nearly two-thirds of the foreign-born population (by 1900, whites were 98.1% of the city's population).<ref>"[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Chicago#Population Chicago]". 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html}}</ref>

[[Labor history of the United States|Labor conflicts]] followed the industrial boom and the rapid expansion of the labor pool, including the [[Haymarket affair]] on May 4, 1886. Concern for social problems among Chicago's immigrant poor led [[Jane Addams]] to co‑found [[Hull House]] in 1889.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hull House Maps Its Neighborhood|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/410008.html|work=Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago Historical Society / Northwestern University|accessdate=2013-04-11}}</ref> Programs developed there became a model for the new field of social work.<ref name="hullhouse">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mary Ann|title=Hull House|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/615.html|work=Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|accessdate=2013-04-12}}</ref>

During the 1870s and 1880s, Chicago attained national stature as the leader in the movement to improve public health. City, and later state laws, that upgraded standards for the medical profession and fought urban epidemics of cholera, small pox, and yellow fever were not only passed, but also enforced. These in turn became templates for public health reform in many other cities and states.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Clinton |last=Sandvick |year=2009 |title=Enforcing Medical Licensing in Illinois: 1877–1890 |journal=Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=67–74 |pmid=19562006 |pmc=2701151}}</ref>

The city invested in many large, well-landscaped [[Chicago Park District|municipal parks]], which also included public sanitation facilities. The chief advocate and driving force for improving public health in Chicago was [[John Henry Rauch|Dr. John H. Rauch, M.D.]], who established a plan for Chicago's park system in 1866, created Lincoln Park by closing a cemetery filled with festering, shallow graves, and helped establish a new Chicago Board of Health in 1867 in response to an outbreak of cholera. Ten years later he became the secretary and then the president of the first Illinois State Board of Health, which carried out most of its activities in Chicago.<ref>{{cite journal |first=William K. |last=Beatty |year=1991 |title=John H. Rauch – Public Health, Parks and Politics |journal=Proceedings of the Institute of Medicine of Chicago |volume=44 |pages=97–118 }}</ref>

In the 19th century, Chicago became the nation's railroad center, by 1910 over 20 railroads operated passenger service out of 6 different downtown terminals.{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=43-49, 58, 318-319}}<ref>{{cite book| last = Holland| first = Kevin J.| title = Classic American Railroad Terminals| year = 2001| publisher = Andover Junction Pub.| isbn = 0-7603-0832-2| pages = 66–91 }}</ref> In 1883, the standardized system of North American [[Time Zones]] was adopted by the general time convention of railway managers in Chicago.<ref>{{cite book| author = United States.

In 1893, Chicago hosted the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] on former marshland at the present location of [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]. The Exposition drew 27.5&nbsp;million visitors, and is considered the most influential world's fair in history.<ref>{{cite web| title=Chicago's Rich History| url=http://www.choosechicago.com/attendees/about_chicago/Pages/chicago_history.aspx| publisher=Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau| accessdate=2011-06-10}}</ref>{{sfnp|Lowe|2000|pp=148-154, 158-169}} The [[University of Chicago]] was founded in 1892 on the same South Side location.

The World War I period and the 1920s also saw a major expansion in industry. The availability of jobs attracted blacks from the South. Between 1910 and 1930, the black population of Chicago dramatically increased from 44,103 to 233,903.<ref>"[http://bentley.umich.edu/research/publications/migration/ch1.php Detroit and the Great Migration, 1916–1929 by Elizabeth Anne Martin]".

The ratification of the 18th amendment to the Constitution in 1919 made the production and sale (including exportation) of alcoholic beverages illegal in the United States. This ushered in the beginning of what is known as the Gangster Era, a time that roughly spans from 1919 until 1933 when the Prohibition was repealed.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Chicago}}

===Topography===
[[File:Full chicago skyline.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Downtown and the North Side with beaches lining the waterfront]]
Chicago is located in northeastern Illinois on the southwestern shores of [[Lake Michigan]]. It is the principal city in [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]] situated in the [[Midwestern United States]] and the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]]. Chicago rests on a [[continental divide]] at the site of the [[Chicago Portage]], connecting the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Great Lakes]] [[drainage basin|watersheds]]. The city lies beside huge freshwater Lake Michigan, and two rivers—the [[Chicago River]] in downtown and the [[Calumet River]] in the industrial far South Side—flow entirely or partially through Chicago.{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=6-9}}
Chicago's history and economy are closely tied to its proximity to Lake Michigan. While the Chicago River historically handled much of the region's waterborne cargo, today's huge [[lake freighter]]s use the city's [[Port of Chicago|Lake Calumet Harbor]] on the South Side. The lake also provides another positive effect, moderating Chicago's climate; making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Angel|first=Jim|title=State Climatologist Office for Illinois|url=http://www.isws.illinois.edu/atmos/statecli/general/chicago-climate-narrative.htm|work=Illinois State Water Survey|publisher=[[Prairie Research Institute]]|accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref>

When Chicago was founded in 1833, most of the early building began around the mouth of the Chicago River, as can be seen on a map of the city's original 58 blocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/11175.html|title=Thompson's Plat of 1830|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|year=2004|accessdate=2011-07-03}}</ref> The overall [[Land grading|grade]] of the city's central, built-up areas, is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography, generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise. The average land elevation is {{convert|579|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The lowest points are along the lake shore at {{convert|578|ft|abbr=on}}, while the highest point, at {{convert|672|ft|abbr=on}}, is the morainal ridge of [[Blue Island, Illinois|Blue Island]] in the city's far south side.<ref name=neiu>{{cite web|title=Chicago Facts|url=http://www.neiu.edu/~jmhemzac/courses/docs/ofs2005-09%20small2.pdf|work=[[Northeastern Illinois University]]|accessdate=28 August 2013|page=46}}</ref>

[[File:20070909 Chicago Half Marathon.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Chicago Half Marathon]] on [[Lake Shore Drive]] next to [[Harold Washington Park]] on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]]]]
The [[Chicago Loop]] is the central business district, but Chicago is also a city of [[Chicago#Neighborhoods|neighborhoods]]. [[Lake Shore Drive]] runs adjacent to a large portion of Chicago's lakefront. Some of the parks along the waterfront include [[Lincoln Park]], [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], [[Burnham Park (Chicago)|Burnham Park]] and [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]. Twenty-four public [[Chicago beaches|beaches]] are also found across {{Convert|26|mi|km|0}} of the waterfront.<ref name=usabeaches>{{cite web|last=Fulton|first=Jeff|title=Public Beaches in Chicago|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/public-beaches-chicago-53741.html|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=28 August 2013}}</ref> Landfill extends into portions of the lake providing space for [[Navy Pier]], [[Northerly Island]], the [[Museum Campus Chicago|Museum Campus]], and large portions of the [[McCormick Place]] Convention Center. Most of the city's high-rise commercial and residential buildings can be found close to the waterfront.

An informal name for the entire [[Chicago metropolitan area]] is "Chicagoland". There is no precise definition for the term "Chicagoland", but it generally means the city and its suburbs combined together. The [[Chicago Tribune]], which coined the term, includes the city of Chicago, the rest of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], eight nearby Illinois counties: [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake]], [[McHenry County, Illinois|McHenry]], [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage]], [[Kane County, Illinois|Kane]], [[Kendall County, Illinois|Kendall]], [[Grundy County, Illinois|Grundy]], [[Will County, Illinois|Will]] and [[Kankakee County, Illinois|Kankakee]], and three counties in [[Indiana]]: [[Lake County, Indiana|Lake]], [[Porter County, Indiana|Porter]] and [[LaPorte County, Indiana|LaPorte]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/communities/ |title=Chicago Tribune Classifieds map of Chicagoland |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> The Illinois Department of Tourism defines Chicagoland as Cook County without the city of Chicago, and only Lake, DuPage, Kane and Will counties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chicagoland Region|url=http://www.enjoyillinois.com/topSpots/region.aspx?area=chicagoland|year=2009|work=EnjoyIllinois.com|publisher=Illinois Department of Tourism|accessdate=2009-08-14}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> The [[Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce]] defines it as all of Cook and DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will counties.<ref>[http://www.chicagolandchamber.org/sub/fast_facts.asp Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Chicago}}

The city lies within the [[humid continental climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfa&#x202f;''), and experiences four distinct seasons. [[Summer]]s are hot and humid, with a July daily average of {{convert|75.8|°F|1}}. In a normal summer, temperatures exceed {{convert|90|°F|0|abbr=on}} on 21&nbsp;days. [[Winter]]s are cold and snowy with few sunny days, and with a January daytime average of {{convert|31|°F|1}}. [[Spring (season)|Spring]] and [[autumn]] are mild seasons with low humidity.

According to the [[National Weather Service]], Chicago's highest official temperature reading of {{convert|106|F|abbr=on}} was recorded on July 24, 1934,<ref name="temperature records">[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/lot/?n=chi_records Chicago's Official Records].

There are also many mild winter and summer days. [[Thunderstorms]] are not uncommon during the spring and summer months which may sometimes produce hail, high winds, and [[tornadoes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A Study of Chicago's Significant Tornadoes|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/lot/?n=Sigchitorn|work=[[National Weather Service]]|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=2013-05-10}}</ref>

The destruction caused by the Great Chicago Fire led to the largest building boom in the history of the nation. In 1885, the first [[steel frame|steel-framed high-rise building]], the [[Home Insurance Building]], rose in the city as Chicago ushered in the [[Early skyscrapers|skyscraper era]],{{sfnp|Lowe|2000|pp=121, 129}} which would then be followed by many other cities around the world.<ref>[http://www.chipublib.org/004chicago/timeline/skyscraper1.html Chicago (2004)]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}.

Large swaths of the city's residential areas away from the lake are characterized by brick [[bungalow]]s built from the early 20th century through the end of World War II. Chicago is also a prominent center of the [[Polish Cathedral style]] of [[church architecture]]. The Chicago suburb of [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]] was home to famous architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], who had designed The [[Robie House]] located near the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>"Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House," Hoffman, Donald, Dover Publications, Inc., 1984, p. 19-25.

=== Streetscape ===
{{main| Roads and expressways in Chicago}}
Chicago's streets were laid out in a [[Grid plan|street grid]] that grew from the city's original townsite plat. Streets following the [[Public Land Survey System]] section lines later became arterial streets in outlying sections. As new additions to the city were platted, city ordinance required them to be laid out with eight streets to the mile in one direction and sixteen in the other direction. The grid's regularity would provide an efficient means to develop new real estate property. A scattering of diagonal streets, many of them originally Indian trails, also cross the city (Elston, Milwaukee, Ogden, Lincoln, etc.). Many additional diagonal streets were recommended in the [[Burnham Plan|Plan of Chicago]], but only the extension of [[Ogden Avenue (Chicago)|Ogden Avenue]] was ever constructed.{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=31, 52-53}}

Most of the city's residential streets tend to have a wide patch of grass and/or trees between the street and the sidewalk itself.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} This has the effect of keeping pedestrians walking on the sidewalk further away from the street traffic. Chicago's [[Western Avenue (Chicago)|Western Avenue]] is the longest continuous urban street in the world.<ref name="El-KhouryRobbins2004">{{cite book|author1=Rodolphe El-Khoury|author2=Edward Robbins|title=Shaping the City: Studies in History, Theory and Urban Design|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Dbv-zU6M9WIC&pg=PA60|accessdate=2013-05-09|date=19 June 2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-26189-0|pages=60–}}</ref> Other famous streets include [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|North Michigan Avenue]], [[State Street (Chicago)|North State Street]], [[Clark Street (Chicago)|Clark]], and [[Belmont Avenue (Chicago)|Belmont Avenue]].

When Chicago was incorporated in 1837, it chose the motto ''Urbs in Horto'', a [[Latin]] phrase which translates into English as "City in a Garden". Today, the [[Chicago Park District]] consists of 552 parks with over {{convert|7300|acre}} of [[municipal park]]land. There are 33 sand [[Chicago beaches]], a plethora of museums, two world-class conservatories, 16 historic lagoons, and 10 bird and wildlife gardens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/docs/7fb8e301-0cdd-431b-9dcb-78b2cd6ac348_document.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - 29430CHIdoc.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-17}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> [[Lincoln Park]], the largest of the city's parks, covers {{convert|1200|acre}} and has over 20&nbsp;million visitors each year, making it second only to [[Central Park]] in New York City in number of visitors.<ref>{{cite web|title=City Park Facts |publisher=The Trust for Public Land, Center for City Park Excellence |month=June | year=2006 |url=http://www.tpl.org/tier3_cd.cfm?content_item_id=20531&folder_id=3208|accessdate=2006-07-19}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref>

===Literature===
[[File:Carl Sandburg NYWTS.jpg|thumb|upright|Much of [[Carl Sandburg]]'s poetry focused on Chicago. His most famous description of the city is as ''"Hog Butcher for the World/Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat/Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler,/Stormy, Husky, Brawling, City of the Big Shoulders."'']]
{{Further|Chicago literature}}

Chicago literature finds its roots in the city's tradition of lucid, direct journalism, lending to a strong tradition of [[social realism]]. In the ''[[Encyclopedia of Chicago]]'', [[Northwestern University]] Professor Bill Savage describes Chicago fiction as prose which tries to ''"capture the essence of the city, its spaces and its people."'' The challenge for early writers was that Chicago was a frontier outpost that transformed into a global metropolis in the span of two generations. Narrative fiction of that time, much of it in the style of "high-flown romance" and "genteel realism", needed a new approach to describe the urban social, political, and economic conditions of Chicago.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/448.html Encyclopedia of Chicago, "Fiction."]</ref> Nonetheless, Chicagoans worked hard to create a literary tradition that would stand the test of time,<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/755.html Encyclopedia of Chicago, "Literary Cultures."]</ref> and create a "city of feeling" out of concrete, steel, vast lake, and open prairie.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1390.html Encyclopedia of Chicago, "Literary Images of Chicago"]</ref> Much notable Chicago fiction focuses on the city itself, with social criticism keeping exultation in check.

At least, three short periods in the [[history of Chicago]] have had a lasting influence on [[American Literature]].<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/257.html Encyclopedia of Chicago History, "Chicago Literary Renaissance."]</ref> These include from the time of the [[Great Chicago Fire]] to about 1900, what became known as the Chicago Literary Renaissance in the 1910s and early 1920s, and the period of the [[Great Depression]] through the 1940s.

What would become the influential ''[[Poetry Magazine]]'' was founded in [[1912 in poetry|1912]] by [[Harriet Monroe]], who was working as an [[art]] [[critic]] for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. The magazine discovered such poets as [[Gwendolyn Brooks]], [[James Merrill]], and [[John Ashbery]].<ref name="ny">Goodyear, Dana, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/02/19/070219fa_fact_goodyear "The Moneyed Muse: What can two hundred million dollars do for poetry?"], article, ''[[The New Yorker]]'', February 19 and February 26 double issue, 2007</ref> [[T.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Eliot]]'s first professionally published poem, "[[The Love Song of J.&nbsp;Alfred Prufrock]]", was first published by ''Poetry''. Contributors have included [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[William Carlos Williams]], [[Langston Hughes]], and [[Carl Sandburg]], among others. The magazine was instrumental in launching the [[Imagist]] and [[Objectivist poets|Objectivist]] poetic movements.

Christianity is predominant among the city's population. The [[Chicago metropolitan area]] also includes adherents of [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]], among others.

The wealth of Chicago's religious heritage is evident in its many noted examples of [[sacred architecture]] and institutions. Many of these religious edifices are Christian in origin, with [[Roman Catholic]] structures particularly prevalent. However, the city of [[Polish Cathedral style|Polish Cathedrals]] is rife with numerous historic synagogues, as well as the noteworthy sacred spaces of other religions.

Chicago was named the ''Best Sports City'' in the United States by the ''[[Sporting News]]'' in 1993, 2006, and 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nhl/feed/2010-10/best-sports-city
|title=Sweet home Chicago: Best Sports City 2010 |work=[[Sporting News]] |date=October 2010|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> The city is home to two [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams: the [[Chicago Cubs]] of the [[National League]] (NL), who play in [[Wrigley Field]] on the North Side; and the [[Chicago White Sox]] of the [[American League]] (AL), who play in [[U.S. Cellular Field]] on the South Side. Chicago is the only city that has had more than one MLB franchise every year since the AL began in 1901. The [[Chicago Bears]], one of the last two remaining charter members of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), have won nine [[List of NFL champions|NFL Championships]], including [[Super Bowl&nbsp;XX]]. The other remaining charter franchise, the [[History of the Chicago Cardinals|Chicago Cardinals]], also started out in the city, but are now known as the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. The Bears play their home games at [[Soldier Field]] named after, "The men and women of the armed forces". It is located just off the shore of Lake Michigan, on [[Lake Shore Drive]]. Soldier Field was an aging stadium and was in dire need of renovation by the end of the 20th century. In 2003, the stadium re-opened after an extensive renovation, which increased the number of luxury boxes and dramatically improved the game day experience for Bears fans. However, because of this renovation, the stadium lost its National Historic Landmark designation on February 17, 2006.

The [[Chicago Bulls]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is one of the most recognized basketball teams in the world. During the 1990s with [[Michael Jordan]] leading them, the Bulls took six NBA championships in eight seasons.<ref name=bulls_dynasty>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Clare|title=The Bulls Dynasty|url=http://www.nba.com/history/bulls_dynasty.html|work=[[NBA]]|accessdate=10 November 2013}}</ref><ref>Markovits, Andrei S. and Lars Rensman.

Both the Bulls and Blackhawks play at the [[United Center]] on the Near West Side. The [[Chicago Rush]] has been a member of the [[Arena Football League]] since 2001 and won [[ArenaBowl&nbsp;XX]], playing in suburban [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]]. The [[Arena Football]] League front office is also in Chicago. The [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]] are members of [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) and reside at [[Toyota Park (Bridgeview)|Toyota Park]] in suburban [[Bridgeview, Illinois|Bridgeview]], after playing its first eight seasons at [[Soldier Field]]. The Fire have won one league title and four [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S.&nbsp;Open Cups]] since their founding in 1997.

While four of the five major franchises have won championships within recent time – the Bears (1985), the Bulls (91, '92, '93, '96, '97, and '98), the White Sox (2005), and the Blackhawks (2010, 2013) — the Chicago Cubs are known for their drought of over 100 years without a championship (currently 105 years as of the 2013 MLB season). The last time the Cubs were in a World Series was 1945. Some fans claim the [[Curse of the Billy Goat]] is responsible for the drought.

{{Main|Demographics of Chicago}}

During its first 100 years, Chicago was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. When founded in 1833, fewer than 200 people had settled on what was then the American frontier. By the time of its first census, seven years later, the population had reached over 4,000. Within the span of forty years, the city's population grew from slightly under 30,000 in 1850 to over 1&nbsp;million by 1890. By the close of the 19th century, Chicago was the fifth largest city in the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201f.htm |title=Top 10 Cities of the Year 1900 |publisher=Geography.about.com |accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> and the largest of the cities that did not exist at the dawn of the century. Within sixty years of the [[Great Chicago Fire|Great Chicago Fire of 1871]], the population went from about 300,000 to over 3 million,<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> and reached its highest ever-recorded population of 3.6&nbsp;million for the 1950 census.

From the last two decades of the 19th Century, Chicago was the destination of waves of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, including (but by no means limited to) [[Italians]], [[Jews]], [[Poles]], and [[Czechs]].<ref name="Cohen">Lizabeth Cohen, ''Making a New Deal: Industrial Workers in Chicago, 1919–1939''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1990; pp.&nbsp;33–34.</ref> To these ethnic groups, the basis of the city's industrial [[working class]], was added an additional influx of [[African-Americans]] from the [[Southern United States|American South]] — with Chicago's black population doubling between 1910 and 1920 and doubling again between 1920 and 1930.<ref name=Cohen />

The great majority of American blacks moving to Chicago in these years were clustered in a so‑called "[[Black Belt (region of Chicago)|Black Belt]]" on the city's South Side.<ref name=Cohen /> By 1930, two-thirds of Chicago's African-American population lived in sections of the city which were 90% black in racial composition.<ref name=Cohen /> Chicago's South Side emerged as America's second largest urban black concentration, following New York's [[Harlem]].<ref name=Cohen />

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]],<ref>[http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_QTPL&prodType=table American Community Survey: Chicago city]. Retrieved 2011-03-06.</ref> there were 2,695,598 people with 1,045,560 households living in Chicago. More than half the population of the state of Illinois lives in the Chicago metropolitan area. Chicago is one of the United States' most densely populated major cities, and the largest city in the [[Great Lakes Megalopolis]]. The racial composition of the city was:
* 45.0% [[White American|White]] (31.7% [[non-Hispanic whites]]);
* 32.9% [[African American|Black or African American]];
* 13.4% from some other race;
* 5.5% [[Asian American|Asian]] (1.6% Chinese, 1.1% Indian, 1.1% Filipino, 0.4% Korean, 0.3% Pakistani, 0.3% Vietnamese, 0.2% Japanese, 0.1% Thai);
* 2.7% from [[Multiracial American|two or more races]];
* 0.5% [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]].
Chicago has a [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] population of 28.9%. (Its members may belong to any race; 21.4% Mexican, 3.8% Puerto Rican, 0.7% Guatemalan, 0.6% Ecuadorian, 0.3% Cuban, 0.3% Colombian, 0.2% Honduran, 0.2% Salvadoran, 0.2% Peruvian)<ref>[http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_QTPL&prodType=table Factfinder2census.gov]</ref> The Guatemalan, Colombian and Peruvian communities have skyrocketed in the 2000s, and some estimates give higher percentages.

According to the US Census Bureau's [[American Community Survey]] data for 2011, the median income for a household in the city was $43,628, and the median income for a family was $49,442. Male full-time workers had a median income of $44,647 versus $41,168 for females. About 19.7% of families and 23.7% of the population lived below the poverty line.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/11_1YR/DP03/1600000US1714000| title=Selected Economic Characteristics: 2011 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates (DP03): Chicago city, Illinois| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=2013-02-08}}</ref>

The government of the City of Chicago is divided into executive and [[legislature|legislative]] branches. The [[Mayor of Chicago]] is the chief executive, elected by general election for a term of four years, with no term limits. The mayor appoints commissioners and other officials who oversee the various departments. In addition to the mayor, Chicago's two other citywide elected officials are the clerk and the treasurer. The [[Chicago City Council|City Council]] is the legislative branch and is made up of 50 aldermen, one elected from each [[wards of the United States|ward]] in the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=City Council, Your Ward & Alderman|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/about/council.html|work=City of Chicago|accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref> The council takes official action through the passage of [[local ordinance|ordinances]] and resolutions and approves the city budget.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chicago Government|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/chicagogovt.html|work=City of Chicago|accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref>

The [[Chicago Police Department]] provides law enforcement for the City of Chicago and its residents. The [[Chicago Fire Department]] provides fire suppression and emergency medical services for the City of Chicago and its residents. Civil and criminal law cases are heard in the [[Cook County Circuit Court]] of the State of Illinois court system, or in the [[Northern District of Illinois]], in the federal system. In the former, the public prosecutor is the Illinois [[State's Attorney]], in the latter, the United States [[District Attorney|Attorney]].

===Politics===
{{Main|Political history of Chicago}}
During much of the last half of the 19th century, Chicago's politics were dominated by a growing [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] organization. During the 1880s and 1890s, Chicago had a powerful radical tradition with large and highly organized socialist, [[anarchism|anarchist]] and labor organizations.<ref>Schneirov 1998, pp 173–174</ref> For much of the 20th century, Chicago has been among the largest and most reliable Democratic strongholds in the United States; with Chicago's Democratic vote the state of Illinois has been "[[Red states and blue states|solid blue]]" in [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] since 1992. Even before then, it was not unheard of for Republican presidential candidates to win handily in downstate Illinois, only to lose statewide due to large Democratic margins in Chicago. The citizens of Chicago have not elected a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] mayor since 1927, when [[William Hale Thompson|William Thompson]] was voted into office. The strength of the party in the city is partly a consequence of Illinois state politics, where the Republicans have come to represent the rural and farm concerns while the Democrats support urban issues such as Chicago's public school funding. Chicago contains less than 25% of the state's population, but 8 of Illinois' 19 [[United States House of Representatives|U.S.&nbsp;Representatives]] have part of Chicago in their [[Illinois's congressional districts|districts]].

[[Machine politics]] persisted in Chicago after the decline of similar machines in other large U.S. cities.<ref>Montejano 1998, pp 33–34</ref> During much of that time, the city administration found opposition mainly from a liberal "independent" faction of the Democratic Party. The independents finally gained control of city government in 1983 with the election of [[Harold Washington]] (in office 1983–1987). From 1989 until May 16, 2011, Chicago was under the leadership of its longest serving mayor, [[Richard M. Daley]], the son of Richard J. Daley. On May 16, 2011, [[Rahm Emanuel]] was sworn in as the 55th mayor of Chicago. Because of the dominance of the Democratic Party in Chicago, the Democratic [[primary election|primary]] vote held in the spring is generally more significant than the general elections in November for U.S. House and Illinois State seats. The aldermanic, mayoral, and other city offices are filled through nonpartisan elections with runoffs as needed.

Chicago is a major transportation hub in the United States. It is an important component in global distribution, as it is the third largest inter-modal port in the world after [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]].<ref>
Madigan 2004, p.52.</ref>

===Expressways===
{{Further|Roads and expressways in Chicago}}
Seven mainline and four auxiliary [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highways]] ([[Interstate 55 in Illinois|55]], [[Interstate 57|57]], [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|65]] (only in Indiana), [[Interstate 80 in Illinois|80]] (also in [[Interstate 80 in Indiana|Indiana]]), [[Interstate 88 (west)|88]], [[Interstate 90 in Illinois|90]] (also in [[Indiana Toll Road|Indiana]]), [[Interstate 94 in Illinois|94]] (also in [[Interstate 94 in Indiana|Indiana]]), [[Interstate 190 (Illinois)|190]], [[Interstate 290 (Illinois)|290]], [[Interstate 294|294]], and [[Interstate 355|355]]) run through Chicago and its suburbs. Segments that link to the city center are named after influential politicians, with three of them named after former U.S.&nbsp;Presidents (Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Reagan) and one named after two-time Democratic candidate [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]].

===Transit systems===
The '''[[Regional Transportation Authority (Illinois)|Regional Transportation Authority]] (RTA)''' coordinates the operation of the three service boards: CTA, Metra, and Pace.

* The '''[[Chicago Transit Authority]] (CTA)''' handles public transportation in the City of Chicago and a few adjacent suburbs outside of the Chicago city limits. The CTA operates an extensive network of buses and a [[rapid transit]] elevated and subway system known as the [[Chicago 'L'|'L']] (for "elevated"), with lines designated by colors. These rapid transit lines also serve both [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway]] and [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare Airport]]s. The CTA's rail lines consist of the [[Red Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Red]], [[Blue Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Blue]], [[Green Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Green]], [[Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Orange]], [[Brown Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Brown]], [[Purple Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Purple]], [[Pink Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Pink]], and [[Yellow Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Yellow]] lines. Both the Red and Blue lines offer 24‑hour service which makes Chicago one of a handful of cities around the world (and one of two in the United States, the other being New York City) to offer rail service 24 hours a day, every day of the year, within the city's limits.

* '''[[Metra]]''', the nation's second-most used passenger regional rail network, operates an 11-line [[commuter rail]] service in Chicago and throughout the Chicago suburbs. The [[Metra Electric Line]] shares its trackage with Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District's [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]], which provides commuter service between [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] and Chicago.

* '''[[Pace (transit)|Pace]]''' provides bus and [[paratransit]] service in over 200 surrounding suburbs with some extensions into the city as well. A 2005 study found that one quarter of commuters used public transit.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/13/real_estate/public_transit_commutes/index.htm "New Yorkers are top transit users"], by Les Christie,''CNNmoney.com'', 2007-6-29. Retrieved 2009-9-21.</ref>

'''[[Greyhound Lines]]''' provides inter-city bus service to and from the city, and Chicago is also the hub for the Midwest network of [[Megabus (North America)]].

'''[[Amtrak]]''' long distance services originate from [[Union Station (Chicago)|Union Station]]. Chicago is one of the largest hubs of passenger rail service in the nation. The services terminate in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., New York City, [[Indianapolis]], New Orleans, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Seattle]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St.&nbsp;Louis]], [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]], Boston, [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]], [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], Los Angeles, and [[San Antonio]]. An attempt was made in the early 20th century to link Chicago with New York City via the [[Chicago – New York Electric Air Line Railroad]]. Parts of this were built, but it was ultimately never completed.

==Infrastructure==

===Utilities===
Electricity for most of [[northern Illinois]] is provided by [[Commonwealth Edison]], also known as ComEd. Their service territory borders [[Iroquois County, Illinois|Iroquois County]] to the south, the [[Wisconsin]] border to the north, the [[Iowa]] border to the west and the [[Indiana]] border to the east. In northern Illinois, ComEd (a division of [[Exelon]]) operates the greatest number of nuclear generating plants in any US state. Because of this, ComEd reports indicate that Chicago receives about 75% of its electricity from nuclear power. Recently, the city started the installation of wind turbines on government buildings with the aim to promote the use of renewable energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iit.edu/~ipro307f/faq.html |title=IIT.edu |publisher=IIT.edu |date=June 20, 2003 |accessdate=2009-05-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080605021018/http://www.iit.edu/~ipro307f/faq.html |archivedate = 2008-06-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentlaw.edu/news/advisory/adv030707.html |title=KentLaw.edu |publisher=KentLaw.edu |accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=By Martin LaMonica Staff Writer, CNET News |url=http://news.com.com/Micro+wind+turbines+are+coming+to+town/2100-11398_3-6037539.html |title='Micro' wind turbines are coming to town &#124; CNET News.com |publisher=News.com.com |accessdate=2009-05-04|archiveurl=http://archive.is/dPEO|archivedate=2012-07-14}}</ref>

Natural Gas is provided by Peoples Gas, a subsidiary of [[Integrys Energy Group]], which is headquartered in Chicago.

Domestic and industrial waste was once incinerated but it is now [[landfill]]ed, mainly in the [[Lake Calumet|Calumet area]]. From 1995 to 2008, the city had a [[blue bag]] program to divert certain refuse from landfills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1322.html |title=Waste Disposal |publisher=Encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> In the fall of 2007 the city began a pilot program for blue bin recycling similar to that of other cities due to low participation rates in the blue bag program. After completion of the pilot the city will determine whether to roll it out to all wards.

Using only 3% of the total available bandwidth capacity and 13% of the available fiber pairs, Chicago area data centers move data for local, area, regional and international networks.<ref name="Telecommunications Hub"/>
