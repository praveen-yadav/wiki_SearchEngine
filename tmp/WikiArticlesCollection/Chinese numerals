{{Numeral systems}}

'''Chinese numerals''' are words and characters used to denote [[number]]s in [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

Today speakers of Chinese use three written [[numeral system]]s: the system of [[Arabic numerals]] used world-wide, and two indigenous systems. The more familiar indigenous system is based on [[Chinese character]]s that correspond to [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals in the spoken language]]. These are shared with other languages of the [[Chinese cultural sphere]] such as Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese. Most people and institutions in China primarily use the Arabic system for convenience, with traditional Chinese numerals used in finance, mainly for writing amounts on checks and banknotes and some ceremonial occasions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The other indigenous system is the [[Suzhou numerals]], or ''huama'', a positional system, the only surviving form of the [[rod numerals]]. These were once used by Chinese mathematicians, and later in Chinese markets, such as those in [[Hong Kong]] before the 1990s, but have been gradually supplanted by Arabic (and also [[Roman numerals|Roman]]) numerals.

==Written numbers==
[[File:Muyu-G209-1620km-5469.jpg|thumb|Chinese and Arabic numerals may coexist, as on this kilometer marker: 1620 km on [[China National Highway 209|Hwy G209]] (G二〇九)]]
The Chinese character numeral system consists of the [[Chinese characters]] used by the [[Chinese written language]] to write spoken numerals. Similar to spelling-out numbers in English (e.g., "one thousand nine hundred forty-five"), it is not an independent system ''per se''. Since it reflects spoken language, it does not use the positional system as in [[Arabic numerals]], in the same way that spelling out numbers in English does not.

===Characters used to represent numbers===

==== Standard numbers ====
There are characters representing the numbers zero through nine, and other characters representing larger numbers such as tens, hundreds, thousands and so on. There are two sets of characters for Chinese numerals: one for everyday writing and one for use in commercial or financial contexts known as '''''dàxiě''''' ({{zh|t=大寫|s=大写}}). The latter arose because the characters used for writing numerals are geometrically simple, so simply using those numerals cannot prevent forgeries in the same way spelling numbers out in English would. A forger could easily change the everyday characters [[wikt:三十|三十]] (30) to [[wikt:五千|五千]] (5000) just by adding a few strokes. That would not be possible when writing using the financial characters [[wikt:參拾|參拾]] (30) and [[wikt:伍仟|伍仟]] (5000). They are also referred to as "banker's numerals", "anti-fraud numerals", or "banker's anti-fraud numerals". For the same reason, rod numerals were never used in commercial records.

'''T''' denotes Traditional Chinese characters, '''S''' denotes Simplified Chinese characters.

|-
|
| align=center|[[wikt:幺|幺]]
| align=center|[[1 (number)|1]]
| align=center| yāo
| align=center|  [[wikt:一|一]]
| Literally means "the smallest". It is used in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] to unambiguously pronounce "#1" in a series of one (一) such as phone numbers and ID numbers, because reading them together in a row is not  distinguishable (e.g. 一一一 would be pronounced as "yao-yao-yao" instead of sounding like "YEEEEEE"). In [[Taiwan]], it is only used by [[soldier]]s, [[police]], and [[emergency service]]s. This usage is not observed in Cantonese except for 十三幺 (a special winning hand) in [[Mahjong]].
|-
|
| align=center| [[wikt:兩|兩]](T) or <br> [[wikt:两|两]](S)
| align=center|[[2 (number)|2]]
| align=center| liǎng
| align=center|  [[wikt:二|二]]
| A very common alternative way of saying "two". Its usage varies from dialect to dialect, even person to person. For example "2222" can read as "二千二百二十二", "兩千二百二十二" or even "兩千兩百二十二" in Mandarin. See [[#Reading and transcribing numbers|Reading and transcribing numbers]] section below.
|-
|
|align=center|[[wikt:仨|仨]]
|align=center|[[3 (number)|3]]
|align=center| sā<!--NOT A TYPO. 仨 is a regional dialect character pronounced "sā", not "sān".-->
|align=center|[[wikt:三|三]]
| In regional dialects of [[Northeastern Mandarin]], 仨 represents a "lazy" pronunciation of three within the local dialect. It can be used as a general number to represent "three" (e.g.第仨号 ''dì sā hào'', "number three"; 星期仨 ''xīngqísā'', "Wednesday"), or as an alternative for 三个 "three of" (e.g. 我们仨 ''Wǒmen sā'', "the three of us", as opposed to 我们三个 ''Wǒmen sān gè''). Regardless of usage, a [[Chinese classifier|measure word]] (such as 个) never follows after 仨.
|-
|
|align=center|[[wikt:呀|呀]]
|align=center|[[10 (number)|10]]
|align=center| yā
|align=center|[[wikt:十|十]]
| In [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] speech, when 十 is used in the middle of a number, preceded by a multiplier and followed by a ones digit, 十 becomes 呀 (aa<sup>6</sup>), e.g. 六呀三, 63. This usage is not observed in Mandarin.
|-
|align=center|[[wikt:念|念]]
|align=center|[[wikt:廿|廿]]
|align=center|[[20 (number)|20]]
|align=center|niàn
|align=center|[[wikt:二十|二十]]
|The written form is still used to refer to dates, especially Chinese calendar dates.<br>Spoken form is still used in various dialects of Chinese. See [[#Reading and transcribing numbers|Reading and transcribing numbers]] section below.<br>In [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]], 廿 (jaa<sup>6</sup>) must be followed by another digit 1-9 (e.g. 廿三, 23), or in a phrase like 廿幾 ("twenty-something"); it is not used by itself to mean 20.<br>[[wikt:卄|卄]] is a rare variant.
|-
|
|align=center|[[wikt:卅|卅]]
|align=center|[[30 (number)|30]]
|align=center|sà
|align=center|[[wikt:三十|三十]]
|The written form is still used to abbreviate date references in Chinese. For example, [[May 30 Movement]] (五卅運動).<br>Spoken form is still used in various dialects of Chinese. See [[#Reading and transcribing numbers|Reading and transcribing numbers]] section below. As with 廿, 卅 must be used with another number to mean 卅幾 ("thirty-something") in Cantonese. Used in other dialects too, as well as historical writings.
|-
|
|align=center|[[wikt:卌|卌]]
|align=center|[[40 (number)|40]]
|align=center|xì
|align=center|[[wikt:四十|四十]]
|Spoken form is still used in various dialects of Chinese, albeit very rare, as well as historical writings written in [[Classical Chinese]].<br>As with 廿, 卌 must be used with another number to mean 卌幾 ("forty-something") in Cantonese. The usage of the word 卌 is done in the following matter, "sei(四) ah ##", or "4 ah ##". Thus 41 would be pronounced "sei ah yat", i.e. "four ah one".
|-
|
|align=center|[[wikt:皕|皕]]
|align=center|[[200 (number)|200]]
|align=center|bì
|align=center|[[wikt:二百|二百]]
|Very rarely used, one common example is the literature 《皕宋樓》.
|}

==== Characters with military usage ====

In the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]], some numbers will have altered names when used for [[Voice procedure|clearer radio communications]]. They are:
*0: renamed 洞 (dòng) ''lit.'' hole
*1: renamed 幺 (yāo) ''lit.'' small
*2: renamed 两 (liǎng) ''lit.'' double
*4: renamed 刀 (dāo) ''lit.'' knife
*7: renamed 拐 (guǎi) ''lit.'' turn
*9: renamed 勾 (gōu) ''lit.'' hook

====Large numbers====
For numbers larger than 10,000, similarly to the [[long and short scales]] in the West, there have been four systems in ancient and modern usage. The original one, with unique names for all powers of ten up to the 14th, is ascribed to the [[Yellow Emperor]] in the 6th century book by Zhen Luan,  ''Wujing suanshu'' (Arithmetic in Five Classics). In modern Chinese only the second system is used, in which the same ancient names are used, but each represents a number 10,000 (myriad, [[wikt:萬|萬]] wàn) times the previous:

In practice, this situation does not lead to ambiguity, with the exception of 兆 (zhào), which means 10<sup>12</sup> according to the system in common usage throughout the Chinese communities as well as in [[Japanese numerals|Japan]] and [[Korean numerals|Korea]], but has also been used for 10<sup>6</sup> in recent years (especially in mainland China for [[megabyte]]). To avoid problems arising from the ambiguity, the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] government never uses this character in official documents, but uses 万亿 (wànyì) instead. The [[Republic of China|ROC]] government in [[Taiwan]] uses 兆 (zhào) to mean 10<sup>12</sup> in official documents.

====SI prefixes====
{{see also|Chinese units of measurement}}
In the People's Republic of China, the translations for the [[SI prefix]]es in 1981 were different from those used today. The larger (兆, 京, 垓, 秭, 穰) and smaller Chinese numerals (微, 纖, 沙, 塵, 渺) were defined as translations for the SI prefixes as ''mega'', ''giga'', ''tera'', ''peta'', ''exa''', ''micro'', ''nano'',  ''pico'',  ''femto'',  ''atto'', resulting in the creation of more values for each numeral.<ref name="PRC1981SIprefixes">{{zh icon}} [http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2011-11/09/content_1989016.htm 1981 Gazette of the State Council of the People's Republic of China], [http://www.gov.cn/gongbao/shuju/1981/gwyb198118.pdf No. 365], page 575, Table 7: SI prefixes</ref>

{{citation needed span|text=By the time of "1981 translation", a dispute had arisen over the value of 兆 . The government of the PRC used ''a part'' of this translation, and defined [[wikt:兆|兆]] zhào as the translation for the SI prefix ''[[mega-]]'' (10<sup>6</sup>). (Perhaps the government was not aware of the common usage of 兆, and thus did not consider an alternative single Chinese character, such as [[wikt:巨|巨]], to represent ''mega''.) Because of this, the translation has caused much confusion.|date=June 2013}}

In addition, Taiwanese defined 百萬 as the translation for ''mega''. This translation is widely used in official documents, academic communities, informational industries, etc. However, the civil broadcasting industries sometimes use [[wikt:兆赫|兆赫]] to represent "[[megahertz]]".

Today, both the governments of the [[People's Republic of China]] ([[Mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]) and [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) use phonetic transliterations for the SI prefixes. However, the governments have each chosen different Chinese characters for certain prefixes. The following table lists the two different standards together with the early translation.

=== Reading and transcribing numbers ===

==== Whole numbers ====
Multiple-digit numbers are constructed using a multiplicative principle; first the digit itself (from 1 to 9), then the place (such as 10 or 100); then the next digit.

In Mandarin, the multiplier [[wikt:兩|兩]] (liǎng) is often used rather than [[wikt:二|二]] (èr) for all numbers greater than 200 with the "2" numeral (although as noted earlier this varies from dialect to dialect and person to person). Use of both 兩 (liǎng) or 二 (èr) are acceptable for the number 200. When writing in the Cantonese dialect, 二 (yi<sup>6</sup>) is used to represent the "2" numeral for all numbers.  In the [[Min Nan|southern Min]] dialect of Chaozhou ([[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]), 兩 (no<sup>6</sup>) is used to represent the "2" numeral in all numbers from 200 onwards.  Thus:

|}

For the numbers 11 through 19, the leading "one" (一) is usually omitted.  In some dialects, like Shanghainese, when there are only two significant digits in the number, the leading "one" and the trailing zeroes are omitted.  Sometimes, the one before "ten" in the middle of a number, such as 213, is omitted.  Thus:

Notes:
# Nothing is ever omitted in large and more complicated numbers such as this.

In certain older texts like the [[Protestant]] [[Bible]] or in poetic usage, numbers such as 114 may be ''written'' as [100] [10] [4] (百十四).

For numbers larger than a [[myriad]], the same grouping system used in English applies, except in groups of four places (myriads) rather than in groups of three (thousands).  Hence it is more convenient to think of numbers here as in groups of four, thus 1,234,567,890 is regrouped here as 12,3456,7890.  Larger than a myriad, each number is therefore four zeroes longer than the one before it, thus 10000 × wàn (萬) = yì (億). If one of the numbers is between 10 and 19, the leading "one" is omitted as per the above point.  Hence (numbers in parentheses indicate that the number has been written as one number rather than expanded):
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Number
! Structure
! Characters
|-
| 12,345,678,902,345<br>(12,3456,7890,2345) || (12) [1,0000,0000,0000] (3456) [1,0000,0000] (7890) [1,0000] (2345) || 十二兆三千四百五十六億七千八百九十萬兩千三百四十五
|}

Interior zeroes before the unit position (as in 1002) must be spelt explicitly.  The reason for this is that trailing zeroes (as in 1200) are often omitted as shorthand, so ambiguity occurs.  One zero is sufficient to resolve the ambiguity.  Where the zero is before a digit other than the units digit, the explicit zero is not ambiguous and is therefore optional, but preferred.  Thus:
{| class="wikitable"

|}

====Fractional values====
To construct a fraction, the [[denominator]] is written first, followed by [[wikt:分之|分之]] ("parts of") and then the [[numerator]]. This is the opposite of how fractions are read in English, which is numerator first. Each half of the fraction is written the same as a whole number. [[Mixed number]]s are written with the whole-number part first, followed by [[wikt:又|又]] ("and"), then the fractional part.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Fraction
! Structure
! Characters
|-
| <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> || [3] [parts of] [2] || 三分之二

| <sup>15</sup>/<sub>32</sub> || [3] [10] [2] [parts of] [10] [5] || 三十二分之十五
|-
| <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3000</sub> || [3] [1000] [parts of] [1] || 三千分之一
|-
| 3 <sup>5</sup>/<sub>6</sub>|| [3] [and] [6] [parts of] [5] || 三又六分之五
|}

Percentages are constructed similarly, using 百 (100) as the denominator. The 一 (one) before 百 is omitted.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Percentage

|-
| 25% || [100] [parts of] [2] [10] [5] || 百分之二十五
|-
| 110% || [100] [parts of] [1] [100] [1] [10] || 百分之一百一十
|}

Decimal numbers are constructed by first writing the whole number part, then inserting a point ({{zh|t=[[wikt:點|點]] |s=[[wikt:点|点]] |p=diǎn}}), and finally the decimal expression. The decimal expression is written using only the digits for 0 to 9, without multiplicative words.

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding [[wikt:第|第]] ''dì'' ("sequence") before the number.

|}

====Usage====
[[Chinese grammar]] requires the use of [[classifier (linguistics)|classifier]]s (measure words) when a numeral is used together with a noun to express a quantity. For example, "three people" is expressed as 三个人 ''sān ge rén'', "three GE person", where 个 ''ge'' is a classifier. There exist many [[List of Chinese classifiers|different classifiers]], for use with different sets of nouns, although 个 is the most common, and may be used informally in place of other classifiers. For details see the article [[Chinese classifier]].

Chinese uses cardinal numbers in certain situations in which English would use ordinals. For example, 三楼 ''sān lóu'' (literally "three story") means "third floor" ("second floor" in British numbering). Likewise, 二十一世纪 ''èrshí yī shìjì'' (literally "twenty-one century") is used for "21st century".<ref>Yip, Po-Ching; Rimmington, Don, ''Chinese: A Comprehensive Grammar'', Routledge, 2004, p. 12.</ref>

Numbers of years are commonly spoken as a sequence of digits, as in 二零零一 ''èr líng líng yī'' ("two zero zero one") for the year [[2001]].<ref>Yip, Po-Ching; Rimmington, Don, ''Chinese: A Comprehensive Grammar'', Routledge, 2004, p. 13.</ref> Names of months and days (in the Western system) are also expressed using numbers: 一月 ''yīyuè'' ("one month") for January, etc.; and 星期一 ''xīngqīyī'' ("week one") for Monday, etc. (although Sunday is 星期日 ''xīngqīrì'', or informally 星期天 ''xīngqītiān'', "week day"). Full dates are usually written in the format 2001年1月20日 for January 20, 2001 (using 年 ''nián'' "year", 月 ''yuè'' "month", and 日 ''rì'' "day") – all the numbers are read as cardinals, not ordinals, and the year is read as a sequence of digits as just mentioned. (See also [[Chinese calendar]].)

== Counting rod and Suzhou numerals ==
[[File:Chounumerals.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Counting rod numerals]]
{{Main|Suzhou numerals}}

In the same way that [[Roman numerals]] were standard in ancient and medieval Europe for mathematics and commerce, the Chinese formerly used the [[counting rods|rod numerals]], which is a positional system. The Suzhou numerals ({{zh|t=蘇州花碼 |s=苏州花码 |p=Sūzhōu huāmǎ}}) system is a variation of the [[Song Dynasty|Southern Song]] rod numerals. Nowadays, the ''huāmǎ'' system is only used for displaying prices in Chinese markets or on traditional handwritten invoices.

==Hand gestures==
{{Main|Chinese number gestures}}

There is a common method of using of one hand to signify the numbers one to ten. While the five digits on one hand can express the numbers one to five, six to ten have special signs that can be used in commerce or day-to-day communication.

==Historical use of numerals in China==
[[File:Shang numerals.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Shang oracle bone numerals of 14th century B.C.<ref>The Shorter Science & Civilisation in China Vol 2, An abridgement by Colin Ronan of Joseph Needham's original text, Table 20, p. 6, Cambridge University Press ISBN 0-521-23582-0</ref>]]

[[File:Rod numeral positioning.JPG|thumb|right|300ox|rod numeral place value from Yongle Encyclopedia]]
[[File:Counting board.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Japanese counting board with grids]]

Most Chinese numerals of later periods were descendants of the [[Shang dynasty]] oracle numerals of the 14th century BC. The [[oracle bone script]] numerals were found on tortoise shell and animal bones. In early civilizations, the Shang were able to express any numbers, however large, with only 9 symbols and a counting board.<ref>The Shorter Science & Civilisation in China Vol 2, An abridgement by Colin Ronan of Joseph Needham's original text, p5,Cambridge University Press  ISBN 0-521-23582-0</ref>

Some of the bronze script numerals such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, and 13 became part of the system of [[rod numerals]].

In this system, horizontal rod numbers are used for the tens, thousands, hundred thousands etc.  [[Sun Tzu (mathematician)|Sun Tzu]] wrote that "one is vertical, ten is horizontal."<ref>[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E5%AD%AB%E5%AD%90%E7%AE%97%E7%B6%93 Chinese Wikisource] 孫子算經: 先識其位，一從十橫，百立千僵，千十相望，萬百相當。</ref>

The counting rod numerals system has place value and decimal numerals for computation, and was used widely by Chinese merchants, mathematicians and astronomers from the [[Han dynasty]] to the 16th century.

[[Alexander Wylie (missionary)|Alexander Wylie]], Christian missionary to China, in 1853 already refuted the notion that "the Chinese numbers were written in words at length", and stated that in ancient China, calculation was carried out by means of counting rods, and "the written character is evidently a rude presentation of these". After being introduced to the rod numerals, he said "Having thus obtained a simple but effective system of figures, we find the Chinese in actual use of a method of notation depending on the theory of local value [i.e. place-value], several centuries before such theory was understood in Europe, and while yet the science of numbers had scarcely dawned among the Arabs."<ref>Alexander Wylie, ''Jottings on the Sciences of the Chinese, North Chinese Herald, 1853, Shanghai''</ref>

During the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (when Arabic numerals were first introduced into China), some Chinese mathematicians used Chinese numeral characters as positional system digits. After the Qing period, both the Chinese numeral characters and the Suzhou numerals were replaced by Arabic numerals in mathematical writings.

== Cultural influences ==
Traditional Chinese numeric characters are also used in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] and were used in [[Vietnam]] before the 20th century. In vertical text (that is, read top to bottom), using characters for numbers is the norm, while in horizontal text, Arabic numerals are most common. Chinese numeric characters are also used in much the same formal or decorative fashion that Roman numerals are in Western cultures. Chinese numerals may appear together with Arabic numbers on the same sign or document.
