The '''Central Powers''' ({{lang-de|Mittelmächte}}; {{lang-hu|Központi hatalmak}}; {{lang-tr|İttifak Devletleri'' or ''Bağlaşma Devletleri}}; {{lang-bg|Централни сили, ''Tsentralni sili''}}) were one of the two warring factions in [[World War&nbsp;I]] (1914–18), composed of [[German Empire|Germany]], the [[Austria–Hungary]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Bulgaria]] (hence also known as the '''Quadruple Alliance'''<ref>[http://archive.org/details/outofmylife00hinduoft Hindenburg, Paul von: Out of my life. P. 113.]</ref> ({{lang-de|Vierbund}})). This alignment originated in the alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary, and fought against the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] that had formed around the [[Triple Entente]]. The Central Powers regarded [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|the assassination]] of Austro-Hungarian Archduke [[Francis Ferdinand]] by several militants as being an act supported by the government of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], and given an unwillingness of Serbia to fully comply with Austro-Hungarian demands for a full investigation of Serbian complicity in the assassination, war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia was justified. This resulted in war with [[Russian Empire|Russia]], which opposed Austro-Hungarian intervention and supported Serbia, and ignited several alliance systems to bring the major European powers into a major war.

==Member states==
The Central Powers consisted of the [[German Empire]] and the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] at the beginning of the war. The [[Ottoman Empire]] joined the Central Powers later in 1914. In 1915, the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] joined the alliance. The name "Central Powers" is derived from the location of these countries; all four (including the other groups that supported them except for [[Finland]] and [[Lithuania]]) were located between the [[Russian Empire]] in the east and [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in the west. [[Finland]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Lithuania]] joined them in 1918 before the war ended and after the Russian Empire collapsed.

In early July 1914, in the aftermath of the assassination of Austro-Hungarian Archduke Francis Ferdinand and the immediate likelihood of war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II]] and the German government informed the Austro-Hungarian government that Germany would uphold its alliance with Austria-Hungary and defend it from possible Russia intervention if a war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia took place.<ref>Cashman, Greg; Robinson, Leonard C.

A World Undone: The Story of the Great War, 1914 to 1918. Delta Book. 2006. P39.</ref> The German government regarded the Russian promise of no war with Germany to be nonsense in light of its general mobilization, and Germany in turn mobilized for war.<ref>Meyer, G.J. A World Undone: The Story of the Great War, 1914 to 1918. Delta Book. 2006. P39.</ref> On August 1, Germany sent an ultimatum to Russia stating that since both Germany and Russia were in a state of military mobilization, an effective state of war existed between the two countries.<ref>Meyer, G.J. A World Undone: The Story of the Great War, 1914 to 1918. Delta Book. 2006. P95.</ref> Later that day, France, an ally of Russia, declared a state of general mobilization,<ref>Meyer, G.J. A World Undone: The Story of the Great War, 1914 to 1918. Delta Book. 2006. P95.</ref>

In August 1914, Germany waged war on Russia, the German government justified military action against Russia as necessary because of Russian aggression as demonstrated by the mobilization of the Russian army that had resulted in Germany mobilizing in response.<ref>Hagen, William W. German History in Modern Times: Four Lives of the Nation. P228.</ref>

After Germany declared war on Russia, France with its alliance with Russia prepared a general mobilization in expectation of war. On 3 August 1914, Germany responded to this action by declaring war on France.<ref>Tucker, Spencer C. A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East. ABC-CLIO. 2009. P1556.</ref> Germany facing a two-front war enacted what was known as the [[Schlieffen Plan]], that involved German armed forces needing to move through Belgium and swing south into France and towards the French capital of Paris. This plan was hoped to quickly gain victory against the French and allow German forces to concentrate on the Eastern Front. Belgium was a neutral country and would not accept German forces crossing its territory. Germany disregarded Belgian neutrality and invaded the country to launch an offensive towards Paris. This act of violation of Belgian neutrality, escalating the conflict resulted in the [[United Kingdom]] declaring war on Germany.

Subsequently several states declared war on Germany, including: [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] declaring war on Germany in late August 1914; [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] declaring war on Austria-Hungary and Germany in 1915, [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] declaring war on Austria-Hungary and Germany in 1916, and the [[United States]] declaring war on Germany on April 6, 1917.

====Colonies and dependencies====
=====In Europe=====

Upon its founding in 1871, the German Empire controlled [[Alsace-Lorraine]] as an "imperial territory", that was incorporated from France after the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and was held within Germany's sovereign territory.

=====In Africa=====
Germany held multiple African colonies at the time of World War I. All of Germany's African colonies were invaded and occupied by Allied forces during the war. 

[[Kamerun|Cameroon]], [[German East Africa]], and [[German Southwest Africa]] were German colonies in Africa. [[Togoland]] was a German protectorate in Africa.

=====In Asia=====
[[German New Guinea]] was a German protectorate in the Pacific. It was occupied by Australian forces in 1914.

The [[Kiautschou Bay concession]] was a German dependency in East Asia leased from China in 1898. It was occupied by Japanese forces following the [[Siege of Tsingtao]].

=== Austria-Hungary ===

[[File:Austrian troops marching up Mt. Zion, 1916.JPG|thumb|right|Austro-Hungarian soldiers marching up [[Mount Zion]] in [[Jerusalem]] in the Ottoman Empire, during the Middle Eastern campaign.]]
==== War Justifications ====

Austria-Hungary regarded the assassination of Arch Duke Francis Ferdinand as being orchestrated with the assistance of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]].<ref>Cashman, Greg; Robinson, Leonard C. An Introduction to the Causes of War: Patterns of Interstate Conflict from World War I to Iraq. Rowman & Littlefield. 2007. P57</ref> The country viewed the assassination as setting a dangerous precedent of encouraging the country's [[South Slavs|South Slav]] population to rebel and threaten to tear apart the multinational country.<ref>Meyer, G.J. A World Undone: The Story of the Great War, 1914 to 1918. Delta Book. 2006. P39.</ref> Austria-Hungary formally sent an ultimatum to Serbia demanding a full-scale investigation of Serbian government complicity in the assassination, and complete compliance by Serbia in agreeing to the terms demanded by Austria-Hungary.<ref>Cashman, Greg; Robinson, Leonard C. An Introduction to the Causes of War: Patterns of Interstate Conflict from World War I to Iraq. Rowman & Littlefield. 2007. P57</ref> Serbia submitted to accept most of the demands, however the Austria-Hungary viewed this as insufficient and used this lack of full compliance to justify military intervention.<ref>Cashman, Greg; Robinson, Leonard C. An Introduction to the Causes of War: Patterns of Interstate Conflict from World War I to Iraq. Rowman & Littlefield. 2007. P61</ref> These demands have been viewed as a diplomatic cover for what was going to be an inevitable Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia.<ref>Cashman, Greg; Robinson, Leonard C. An Introduction to the Causes of War: Patterns of Interstate Conflict from World War I to Iraq. Rowman & Littlefield. 2007. P61</ref>

Austria-Hungary had been warned by Russia that the Russian government would not tolerate Austria-Hungary crushing Serbia.<ref>Cashman, Greg; Robinson, Leonard C. An Introduction to the Causes of War: Patterns of Interstate Conflict from World War I to Iraq. Rowman & Littlefield. 2007. P61</ref> However with Germany supporting Austria-Hungary's actions, the Austro-Hungarian government hoped that Russia would not intervene and that the conflict with Serbia would be a regional conflict.<ref>Cashman, Greg; Robinson, Leonard C. An Introduction to the Causes of War: Patterns of Interstate Conflict from World War I to Iraq. Rowman & Littlefield. 2007. P57</ref>

Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia resulted in Russia declaring war on the country and Germany in turn declared war on Russia, setting off the beginning of the clash of alliances that resulted in the World War.

==== Dependencies ====
Austria-Hungary was internally divided into two states joined in communion through the Hapsburg throne, Austria and Hungary with their own governments. Both Austria and Hungary possessed several dependencies. 

Austrian [[Cisleithania]] contained various duchies and principalities but Austria also contained several protectorate kingdoms within its sovereign territory such as the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], and the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary|Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] with sovereign authority shared by both Austria and Hungary.

Hungarian [[Transleithania]] comprised the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the protectorate [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]]. Hungary shared with Austria sovereign authority over the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

=== Ottoman Empire ===

==== War justifications ====
The Ottoman Empire joined the war on the side of the Central Powers in November 1914. The Ottoman Empire had gained strong economic connections with Germany through the Berlin-to-Baghdad railway project that was still incomplete at the time.<ref>Hickey, Michael. The First World War: Volume 4 The Mediterranean Front 1914-1923. P31.</ref> The Ottoman Empire made a formal alliance with Germany signed on 2 August 1914.<ref>Afflerbach, Holger; David Stevenson, David. An Improbable War: The Outbreak of World War 1 and European Political Culture. Berghan Books. 2012. P. 292.</ref> The alliance treaty expected that the Ottoman Empire would become involved in the conflict in a short amount of time.<ref>Afflerbach, Holger; David Stevenson, David. An Improbable War: The Outbreak of World War 1 and European Political Culture. Berghan Books. 2012. P. 292.</ref> However initially for the first several months of the war the Ottoman Empire maintained neutrality though it allowed a German naval squadron to enter and stay near the strait of [[Bosphorus]].<ref>Kent, Mary. The Great Powers and the End of the Ottoman Empire. end ed. Frank Cass. 1998. P119</ref> Ottoman officials informed the German government that the country needed time to prepare for conflict.<ref>Kent, Mary. The Great Powers and the End of the Ottoman Empire. end ed.

An Improbable War: The Outbreak of World War 1 and European Political Culture. Berghan Books. 2012. P. 292.</ref>

After pressure escalated from the German government demanding that the Ottoman Empire fulfill its treaty obligations, or else Germany would expel the country from the alliance and terminate economic and military assistance, the Ottoman government entered the war with the recently acquired cruisers from Germany, the ''[[SMS Goeben|Yavuz Sultan Selim]]'' (formerly ''SMS Goeben'') and the ''[[SMS Breslau|Midilli]]'' (formerly ''SMS Breslau'') launching a naval raid on the Russian port of [[Odessa]], thus engaging in a military action in accordance with its alliance obligations with Germany. [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and the Triple Entente declared war on the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Afflerbach, Holger; David Stevenson, David. An Improbable War: The Outbreak of World War I and European Political Culture. Berghan Books. 2012. P. 293.</ref>

===Bulgaria===
{{main|Bulgaria during World War I|}}
[[File:Bulgaria southern front.jpg|thumb|right|Bulgarian soldiers firing at an incoming aircraft.]]
Bulgaria was still resentful after its [[Second Balkan War|defeat]] in July 1913 at the hands of Serbia, [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and the Ottoman Empire. It was the last country to join the Central Powers, which Bulgaria did in October 1915 by declaring war on Serbia. It invaded Serbia in conjunction with [[German Army (German Empire)|German]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian forces]]. Bulgaria held irredentist aims on the region of [[Vardar Macedonia]] held by Serbia.

Ethnic Nationalism and the Fall of Empires: Central Europe, the Middle East and Russia, 1914-23. Routledge, 2002. P. 117.</ref>

The state was utilized by the German government alongside punitive threats to induce Polish landowners living in the German-occupied Baltic territories to move to the state and sell their Baltic property to Germans in exchange for moving to Poland, and efforts were made to induce similar emigration of Poles from Prussia to the state.<ref>Annemarie Sammartino.

Other movements supported the efforts of the Central Powers for their own reasons, such as the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood|Irish Nationalists]] who launched the [[Easter Rising]] in [[Dublin]] in April 1916; they referred to their "gallant allies in Europe". In 1914, [[Józef Piłsudski]] was permitted by Germany and Austria-Hungary to form independent [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish legions]]. Piłsudski wanted his legions to help the Central Powers defeat Russia and then side with France and the UK and win the war with them. During the years 1917 and 1918, the [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finns]] under [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|C.G.E. Mannerheim]] and [[Lithuania]]n nationalists fought Russia for a [[Co-belligerence|common cause]]. With the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]] [[Ukrainian–Soviet War|aggression]] of late 1917, the [[General Secretariat of Ukraine|government of Ukraine]] sought a military protection first from the Central powers and later from the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|armed forces of the Entente]]. The Ottoman Empire also had its own allies in [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]] and the [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus|Northern Caucasus]]. The three nations fought alongside each other under the [[Ottoman Army of Islam|Army of Islam]] in the [[Battle of Baku]].

==Armistice and treaties==
