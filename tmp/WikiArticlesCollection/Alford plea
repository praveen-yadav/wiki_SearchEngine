==Origin==
{{main|North Carolina v. Alford}}
[[File:North Carolina v. Alford.pdf|thumb|''[[North Carolina v. Alford]]'', [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] (1970)]]
The Alford guilty plea originated in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case of ''[[North Carolina v. Alford]]'' (1970).<ref name="wild" /><ref name="champion" /> Henry Alford had been [[indictment|indicted]] on a charge of [[first-degree murder]] in 1963.<ref name="walburn" /> Evidence in the case included testimony from witnesses that Alford had said after the death of the victim that he had killed the individual.<ref name="walburn" /> Court testimony showed Alford and the victim argued at the victim's house.<ref name="walburn" /> Alford left the house, and afterwards the victim received a fatal [[gunshot wound]] when he opened the door responding to a knock.<ref name="walburn" /> 

Alford was faced with the possibility of [[capital punishment]] if convicted by a [[jury trial]].<ref name="solgan" /> The [[death penalty]] was the automatic sentence by [[North Carolina]] law at the time, if two requisites in the case were satisfied:<ref name="walburn" /> the defendant had to have pleaded not guilty, and the jury did not instead recommend a [[life sentence]].<ref name="walburn" /> Had he pled guilty to first-degree murder, Alford would have had the possibility of a life sentence, but would have avoided the death penalty.<ref name="walburn" /> The defendant did not want to admit guilt. Alford pled guilty to [[Murder_(United_States_law)#Degrees_of_murder_in_the_United_States|second-degree murder]], and said he was doing so to avoid a death sentence if he had been convicted of first-degree murder after attempting to contest that charge.<ref name="walburn" /><ref name="feinman">{{cite book  | last =Feinman  | first = Jay M.   | title =Law 101: Everything You Need to Know about the American Legal System  | publisher =[[Oxford University Press, USA]]  | year =2006  | page =327  | isbn =0-19-517957-9 }}</ref> Alford was sentenced to thirty years in prison, after the trial judge in the case accepted the plea bargain and ruled that the defendant had been adequately apprised by his lawyer.<ref name="walburn" />

[[File:Justice White Official.jpg|thumb|left|[[Supreme Court Justice]] [[Byron White]] wrote the decision for the majority]]
Alford appealed and requested a new trial, arguing he was forced into a guilty plea because he was afraid of receiving a death sentence.<ref name="walburn" /> The [[Supreme Court of North Carolina]] ruled that the defendant had voluntarily entered the guilty plea, with knowledge of what that meant.<ref name="walburn" /> Following this ruling, Alford petitioned for a [[writ of habeas corpus]] in the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina]], which upheld the initial ruling, and subsequently to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] which ruled that Alford's plea was not voluntary, because it was made under fear of the death penalty.<ref name="walburn" />  "I just pleaded guilty because they said if I didn't, they would gas me for it," wrote Alford in one of his appeals.<ref name="barksdale" />

The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court. [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court Justice]] [[Byron White]] wrote the decision for the majority.<ref name="acker">{{cite book  | last =Acker  | first =James R.   | coauthors =David C. Brody  | title =Criminal Procedure: A Contemporary Perspective  | publisher =Jones & Bartlett Publishers  | year =2004  | pages =485–488  | isbn = 0-7637-3169-2}}</ref> The Supreme Court held that for the plea to be accepted, the defendant must have been advised by a competent lawyer who was able to inform the individual that his best decision in the case would be to enter a guilty plea.<ref name="solgan">{{cite journal  | last =Solgan  | first =Christopher  | title =Life or Death: The Voluntariness of Guilty Pleas by Capital Defendants and the New York Perspective  | journal =New York Law School Journal of Human Rights  | volume =16  | page =699  | publisher =[[New York Law School]]  | date =Spring 2000  }}</ref> The Court ruled that the defendant can enter such a plea "when he concludes that his interests require a guilty plea and the record strongly indicates guilt."<ref name="barksdale" /> The Court allowed the guilty plea only with a simultaneous protestation of innocence as there was enough evidence to show that the prosecution had a strong case for a conviction, and the defendant was entering such a plea to avoid this possible sentencing.<ref name="solgan" /> The Court went on to note that even if the defendant could have shown that he would not have entered a guilty plea "but for" the rationale of receiving a lesser sentence, the plea itself would not have been ruled invalid.<ref name="solgan" /> As evidence existed that could have supported Alford's conviction, the Supreme Court held that his guilty plea was allowable while the defendant himself still maintained that he was not guilty.<ref name="feinman" />

==Definition==
The ''Dictionary of Politics: Selected American and Foreign Political and Legal Terms'' defines the term Alford plea as: "A plea under which a defendant may choose to plead guilty, not because of an admission to the crime, but because the prosecutor has sufficient evidence to place a charge and to obtain conviction in court. The plea is commonly used in local and state courts in the United States."<ref name="raymond" /> According to ''[[University of Richmond Law Review]]'', "When offering an Alford plea, a defendant asserts his innocence but admits that sufficient evidence exists to convict him of the offense."<ref name="judge" /> ''A Guide to Military Criminal Law'' notes that under the Alford plea, "the defendant concedes that the prosecution has enough evidence to convict, but the defendant still refuses to admit guilt."<ref name="davidson" /> The book ''Plea Bargaining's Triumph: A History of Plea Bargaining in America'' published by [[Stanford University Press]] defines the plea as one in "which the defendant adheres to his/her claim of innocence even while allowing that the government has enough evidence to prove his/her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt".<ref name="fisher" /> According to the book ''Gender, Crime, and Punishment'' published by [[Yale University Press]], "Under the Alford doctrine, a defendant does not admit guilt but admits that the state has sufficient evidence to find him or her guilty, should the case go to trial."<ref name="daly" /> ''Webster's New World Law Dictionary'' defines Alford plea as: "A guilty plea entered as part of a plea bargain by a criminal defendant who denies committing the crime or who does not actually admit his guilt. In federal courts, such plea may be accepted as long as there is evidence that the defendant is actually guilty."<ref name="wild" />

The Alford guilty plea is "a plea of guilty containing a protestation of innocence".<ref name="scheb">{{cite book  | last =Scheb  | first =John  | title =Criminal Procedure  | publisher =[[Wadsworth Publishing]]  | year =2008  | page =148  | isbn = 978-0-495-50386-6}}</ref> The defendant pleads guilty, but does not have to specifically admit to the guilt itself.<ref name="raum">{{cite journal  | last =Raum  | first =Michael S.    | coauthors =Jeffrey L.

Defendants can take advantage of the ability to use the Alford guilty plea, by admitting there is enough evidence to convict them of a higher crime, while at the same time pleading guilty to a lesser charge.<ref name="duff">{{cite book  | last =Duff  | first =Antony   | title =The Trial on Trial, Volume One: Truth and Due Process  | publisher =Hart Publishing  | year =2004  | page =58  | isbn =1-84113-442-2 }}</ref> Defendants usually enter an Alford guilty plea if they want to avoid a possible worse sentence were they to lose the case against them at trial.<ref name="gardner" /> It affords defendants the ability to accept a [[plea bargain]], while maintaining innocence.<ref name="marguis">{{cite journal  | last =Marquis  | first =Joshua  | title =Symposium: Innocnence in Capital Sentencing: Article: The Myth of Innocence  | journal =Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology  | volume =95  | page =501  | publisher =[[Northwestern University School of Law|Northwestern School of Law]]  | date =Winter 2005 }}</ref>

==Court and government usage==
This form of guilty plea has been frequently used in local and state courts in the United States,<ref name="raymond" /> though it consists of a small percentage of all plea bargains in the U.S.<ref name="fisher">{{cite book  | last =Fisher  | first =George  | title =Plea Bargaining's Triumph: A History of Plea Bargaining in America  | publisher =[[Stanford University Press]]  | year =2003  | page =319  | isbn =0-8047-5135-8 }}</ref> This form of plea is not allowed in courts of the [[United States military]].<ref name="davidson" /><ref name="walburn">{{cite journal  | last =Walburn  | first =Steve E.   | title =Should the Military Adopt an ''Alford''-Type Guilty Plea?  | journal =The Air Force Law Review  | volume =44  | pages =119–169  | publisher =[[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Air Force|Judge Advocate General School, United States Air Force]] | year =1998 }}</ref> In 2000 the [[United States Department of Justice]] noted, "In an Alford plea the defendant agrees to plead guilty because he or she
realizes that there is little chance to win acquittal because of the strong evidence of guilt.  About 17% of State inmates and 5% of Federal inmates submitted either an Alford plea or a no contest plea, regardless of the type of attorney.  This difference reflects the relative readiness of State courts, compared to Federal courts, to accept an alternative plea."<ref>{{cite news | first=Caroline Wolf | last=Harlow | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Defense Counsel in Criminal Cases | date=November 2000 | publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] | url =http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/ascii/dccc.txt | work =NCJ 179023 | pages = | accessdate = 2009-12-03 | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080716091432/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/ascii/dccc.txt |archivedate = 2008-07-16}}</ref>

In the 1995 case ''State of Idaho v. Howry'' before the [[Idaho Court of Appeals]], the Court commented on the impact of the Alford guilty plea on later sentencing.<ref name="cooper" /> The Court ruled, "Although an Alford plea allows a defendant to plead guilty amid assertions of innocence, it does not require a court to accept those assertions. The sentencing court may, of necessity, consider a broad range of information, including the evidence of the crime, the defendant's criminal history and the demeanor of the defendant, including the presence or absence of remorse."<ref name="cooper">{{Cite web  | last = Cooper  | first = Bob  | title = Coles Enters Guilty Pleas on Two Felony Charges  | work = Office of Attorney General Lawrence Wasden  | publisher = [[Idaho|State of Idaho]]  | date = November 3, 2003  | url =http://www2.state.id.us/ag/newsrel/2003/nr_nov032003b.htm  | accessdate = 2009-11-30}}</ref> In the 1999 [[South Carolina Supreme Court]] case ''State v.

In the 2006 case before the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], ''Ballard v. Burton'', Judge [[Carl E.

In March 2009, the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] characterized the Alford plea as: "a form of a guilty plea in which the defendant asserts innocence but acknowledges on the record that the prosecutor could present enough evidence to prove guilt."<ref>{{cite news | first= | last=[[Minnesota House of Representatives]] | coauthors= |authorlink= | title= Permanent disqualification | date=March 27, 2009 | publisher=[[Minnesota]] | url =http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/bs/86/hf1750.html | work =Bill Summary: House Research Department | pages = | accessdate = 2009-12-03 | language = | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091204055107/http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/bs/86/hf1750.html| archivedate= 4 December 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The Minnesota Judicial Branch similarly states: "Alford Plea: A plea of guilty that may be accepted by a court even where the defendant does not admit guilt.

==Commentary==
In his 1972 book ''American Criminal Justice'', Jonathan D. Caplan comments on the Supreme Court decision, noting, "The ''Alford'' decision recognizes the plea-bargaining system, acknowledging that a man may maintain his innocence but still plead guilty in order to minimize his potential loss."<ref name="jackson">{{cite book  | last =Jackson  | first =Bruce  | title =Law and Disorder  | publisher =[[University of Illinois|University of Illinois Press]]  | year =1984  | pages =119–120  | isbn = 0-252-01012-4}}</ref> Caplan comments on the impact of the Supreme Court's decision making it necessary for there to be evidence of guilt in such a plea, "By requiring that there be some evidence of guilt in such a situation, the decision attempts to protect the 'really' innocent from the temptations to which plea-bargaining and defense attorneys may subject them."<ref name="jackson" />

[[Major]] Steven E. Walburn argues in a 1998 article in ''The Air Force Law Review'' that this form of guilty plea should be adopted for usage by the United States military.<ref name="walburn" /> "In fairness to an accused, if, after consultation with his defense counsel, he knowingly and intelligently determines that his best interest is served by an Alford-type guilty plea, he should be free to choose this path. The system should not force him to lie under oath, nor to go to trial with no promise of the ultimate outcome concerning guilt or punishment. We must trust the accused to make such an important decision for himself. The military provides an accused facing court-martial with a qualified defense attorney. Together, they are in the best position to properly weigh the impact his decision, and the resulting conviction, will have upon himself and his family," writes Walburn.<ref name="walburn" /> He emphasizes that when allowing these pleas, "trial counsel should establish as strong a factual basis as possible", in order to minimize the possible negative outcomes to "the public's perception of the administration of justice within the military".<ref name="walburn" />

{{Quote box |qalign=center |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right |halig=left | salign=right|quote="These procedures may be constitutional and efficient, but they undermine key values served by admissions of guilt in open court."|source=&nbsp;—Stephanos Bibas, ''[[Cornell Law Review]]''<ref name="bibas" />}}
Stephanos Bibas writes in a 2003 analysis for ''[[Cornell Law Review]]'' that Judge [[Frank H. Easterbrook]] and a majority of scholars "praise these pleas as efficient, constitutional means of resolving cases."<ref name="bibas" /> Bibas notes that prominent plea bargain critic Albert Alschuler supports the use of this form of plea, writing, "He views them as a lesser evil, a way to empower defendants within a flawed system. As long as we have plea bargaining, he maintains, innocent defendants should be free to use these pleas to enter advantageous plea bargains without lying. And guilty defendants who are in denial should be empowered to use these pleas instead of being forced to stand trial."<ref name="bibas" /> Bibas instead asserts that this form of plea is "unwise and should be abolished".<ref name="bibas" /> Bibas argues, "These procedures may be constitutional and efficient, but they undermine key values served by admissions of guilt in open court. They undermine the procedural values of accuracy and public confidence in accuracy and fairness, by convicting innocent defendants and creating the perception that innocent defendants are being pressured into pleading guilty. More basically, they allow guilty defendants to avoid accepting responsibility for their wrongs."<ref name="bibas" />

Legal scholar Jim Drennan, an expert on the court system at the Institute of Government at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], told the ''[[Winston-Salem Journal]]'' in a 2007 interview that the ability to use this form of guilty plea as an option in courts had a far-reaching effect throughout the United States.<ref name="barksdale">{{cite news   | last =Barksdale  | first =Titan   | title =(Not) Guilty – Lawyer in case that led to Alford plea says he worried about later questions   | work =[[Winston-Salem Journal]]  | page =B1  | date =28 March 2007 | url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-30144461_ITM | accessdate = 31 July 2013}}</ref> Drennan commented, "We have lots of laws, but human interaction creates unique circumstances and the law has to adapt."<ref name="barksdale" /> He said of the Supreme Court case, "They had to make a decision about what to do. One of the things the court has to do is figure out how to answer new questions, and that is what happened in this case."<ref name="barksdale" />
