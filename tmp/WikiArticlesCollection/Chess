'''Chess''' is a two-player [[Abstract strategy game|strategy]] [[board game]] played on a [[chessboard]], a checkered gameboard with 64&nbsp;squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. It is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in parks, [[chess club|clubs]], online, by [[correspondence chess|correspondence]], and in [[list of chess terms#Tournament|tournaments]].

Each player begins the game with 16 [[Chess piece|pieces]]: one [[king (chess)|king]], one [[queen (chess)|queen]], two [[rook (chess)|rooks]], two [[knight (chess)|knights]], two [[bishop (chess)|bishops]], and eight [[pawn (chess)|pawns]]. Each of the six piece types [[#Movement|moves]] differently. Pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, with the objective to '[[checkmate]]' the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. In addition to checkmate, the game can be won by the voluntary [[resign]]ation of the opponent, which typically occurs when too much [[material (chess)|material]] is lost, or if checkmate appears unavoidable. A game may also result in a [[draw (chess)|draw]] in several ways, where neither player wins. The course of the game is divided into three phases: [[chess opening|opening]], [[Chess middlegame|middlegame]], and [[Chess endgame|endgame]].

The first official [[World Chess Championship|World Chess Champion]], [[Wilhelm Steinitz]], claimed his title in 1886; the current World Champion is Norwegian chess [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[Magnus Carlsen]]. In addition to the [[World Chess Championship|World Championship]], there are the [[Women's World Chess Championship|Women's World Championship]], the [[World Junior Chess Championship|Junior World Championship]], the [[World Senior Chess Championship|World Senior Championship]], the [[World Correspondence Chess Champion|Correspondence Chess World Championship]], the [[World Computer Chess Championship]], and [[fast chess|Blitz and Rapid World Championships]]. The [[Chess Olympiad]] is a popular competition among teams from different nations. Online chess has opened amateur and professional competition to a wide and varied group of players. Chess is a [[Olympic sports#Recognized sports|recognized sport]] of the [[International Olympic Committee]] and international chess competition is sanctioned by the [[FIDE|World Chess Federation (FIDE)]], which adopted the now-standard [[Staunton chess set]] in 1924 for use in all official games. There are also many [[chess variants]], with different rules, different pieces, and different boards.

Since the second half of the 20th century, [[Chess engine|computers have been programmed to play chess]] with increasing success, to the point where the strongest home computers play chess at a higher level than the best human players. In the past two decades computer analysis has contributed significantly to chess theory, particularly in the endgame. The computer [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] was the first machine to overcome a reigning World Chess Champion in a match, when it [[Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov|defeated]] [[Garry Kasparov]] in 1997.

==Rules==
{{Main|Rules of chess}}
[[File:ChessStartingPosition.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|Pieces at the start of a game]]
The official rules of chess are maintained by the [[FIDE|World Chess Federation]]. Along with information on official [[chess tournament]]s, the rules are described in the ''FIDE Handbook'', Laws of Chess section.<ref>{{cite web

===Setup===
Chess is played on a square [[Chessboard|board]] of eight rows (called ''[[rank (chess)|ranks]]'' and denoted with numbers ''1'' to ''8'') and eight columns (called ''[[file (chess)|files]]'' and denoted with letters ''a'' to ''h'') of squares. The colors of the 64 squares alternate and are referred to as "light" and "dark" squares. The chessboard is placed with a light square at the right-hand end of the rank nearest to each player, and the pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo, with each [[Queen (chess)|queen]] on a square of its own color.

The pieces are divided, by convention, into white and black sets. The players are referred to as [[White and Black in chess|"White" and "Black"]], and each begins the game with 16 [[Chess piece|pieces]] of the specified color. These consist of one [[king (chess)|king]], one [[queen (chess)|queen]], two [[rook (chess)|rooks]], two [[bishop (chess)|bishops]], two [[knight (chess)|knights]], and eight [[pawn (chess)|pawns]].
{{clear left}}

===Movement===
White always moves first. After the initial move, the players alternately move one piece at a time (with the exception of [[castling]], when two pieces are moved). Pieces are moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from play. With the sole exception of ''[[en passant]]'', all pieces capture opponent's pieces by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies. A player may not make any move that would put or leave his king under attack. If the player to move has no legal moves, the game is over; it is either a [[checkmate]] (a loss for the player with no legal moves) if the king is under attack, or a [[stalemate]] (a draw) if the king is not.

Each [[chess piece]] has its own style of moving. In the diagrams, the dots mark the squares where the piece can move if no other pieces (including one's own piece) are on the squares between the piece's initial position and its destination.

* The [[King (chess)|king]] moves one square in any direction. The king has also a special move which is called ''[[Chess#Castling|castling]]'' and involves also moving a rook.
* The [[Rook (chess)|rook]] can move any number of squares along any rank or file, but may not leap over other pieces. Along with the king, the rook is involved during the king's castling move.
* The [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]] can move any number of squares diagonally, but may not leap over other pieces.
* The [[Queen (chess)|queen]] combines the power of the rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along rank, file, or diagonal, but it may not leap over other pieces.
* The [[Knight (chess)|knight]] moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal, thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically. The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.
* The [[Pawn (chess)|pawn]] may move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it may advance two squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied (black "●"s in the diagram); or the pawn may capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, by moving to that square (black "'''x'''"s). The pawn has two special moves: the ''[[Chess#En passant|en passant]]'' capture and pawn [[Promotion (chess)|promotion]].

[[File:ChessCastlingMovie.gif|thumb|250px|Examples of castling]]

===Castling===
{{Main|Castling}}
Once in every game, each king is allowed to make a special move, known as ''[[castling]]''. Castling consists of moving the king two squares along the first rank toward a rook (which is on the player's first rank{{#tag:ref|Without this additional restriction, which was added to the FIDE rules in 1972, it would be possible to promote a pawn on the ''e'' [[File (chess)|file]] to a rook and then castle vertically across the board (as long as the other conditions are met). This way of castling was "discovered" by Max Pam and used by [[Tim Krabbé]] in a [[Joke chess problem#Offbeat interpretations of the rules of chess|chess puzzle]] before the rules were amended to disallow it. See ''Chess Curiosities'' by Krabbé. See also [[:de:Pam-Krabbé-Rochade]] for the diagrams online.|group=note}}) and then placing the rook on the last square the king has just crossed. Castling is permissible only if all of the following conditions hold:<ref>{{cite web
 | title=The rules of chess
 | url=http://www.chessvariants.org/d.chess/chess.html

 | publisher=Chess Variants
 | accessdate=2008-01-07
}}</ref>
* Neither of the pieces involved in castling may have been previously moved during the game.
* There must be no pieces between the king and the rook.
* The king may not be in check, nor may the king pass through squares that are under attack by enemy pieces, nor move to a square where it is in check.

===''En passant''===
[[File:ChessPawnSpecialMoves.gif|thumb|250px|Examples of pawn moves: promotion (left) and ''en passant'' (right)]]
{{Main|En passant}}
When a pawn advances two squares from its starting position and there is an opponent's pawn on an adjacent file next to its destination square, then the opponent's pawn can capture it ''en passant'' (in passing), and move to the square the pawn passed over. However, this can only be done on the very next move, otherwise the right to do so is forfeit. For example, if the black pawn has just advanced two squares from g7 (initial starting position) to g5, then the white pawn on f5 may take it via ''en passant'' on g6 (but only on white's next move).

===Promotion===
{{Main|Promotion (chess)}}

When a pawn advances to the eighth rank, as a part of the move it is ''promoted'' and must be exchanged for the player's choice of queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. Usually, the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen, but in some cases another piece is chosen; this is  called [[underpromotion]]. In the diagram on the right, the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted to an allowed piece. There is no restriction placed on the piece that is chosen on promotion, so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game (for example, two queens).

}}

===Check===
{{Main|Check (chess)}}
When a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in ''[[Check (chess)|check]]''. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave his own king in check.

===End of the game===
Although the objective of the game is to ''checkmate'' the opponent, chess games do not have to end in checkmate—either player may [[List of chess terms#Resign|resign]] which is a win for the other player. It is considered bad etiquette to continue playing when in a truly hopeless position.<ref>Burgess (2000), p. 481</ref> If it is a game with [[time control]], a player may run out of time and lose, even with a much superior position. Games also may end in a [[Draw (chess)|draw]] (tie). A draw can occur in several situations, including [[draw by agreement]], [[stalemate]], [[threefold repetition]] of a position, the [[fifty-move rule]], or a draw by impossibility of checkmate (usually because of [[Glossary of chess#Insufficient material|insufficient material]] to checkmate). As checkmate from some positions cannot be forced in fewer than 50 moves (such as in the [[pawnless chess endgame]] and [[two knights endgame]]), the fifty-move rule is not applied everywhere,{{#tag:ref|The 50 moves rule is not applied at FICGS.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ficgs.com/membership.html#chess
 | title=50 moves rules
 | accessdate=2009-12-01
 | publisher=FICGS
}}</ref>|group=note}} particularly in correspondence chess.

===Time control===
[[File:Digitalna sahovska ura2.jpg|thumb|left|A modern digital chess clock]]

Chess matches may also be played with a [[time control]], mostly by club and professional players. If a player's time runs out before the game is completed, the game is automatically lost (provided his opponent has enough pieces left to deliver checkmate). The duration of a game ranges from long games played up to seven hours to shorter [[rapid chess]] games, usually lasting 30 minutes or one hour per game. Even shorter is [[blitz chess]], with a time control of three to 15 minutes for each player, and [[bullet chess]] (under three minutes). In tournament play, time is controlled using a [[game clock]] that has two displays, one for each player's remaining time.

==Notation for recording moves==
[[File:SCD algebraic notation.svg|frame|right|Naming the squares in algebraic chess notation]]
{{Main|Chess notation}}

Chess games and positions are recorded using a special notation, most often [[Algebraic notation (chess)|algebraic chess notation]].<ref>See paragraph "E. Algebraic notation" in {{cite web
 | url=http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=125&view=article
 | title=E.I.01B. Appendices
 | accessdate=2008-11-26
 | publisher=FIDE
}}</ref> Abbreviated (or short) algebraic notation generally records moves in the format "abbreviation of the piece moved – file where it moved – rank where it moved". For example, '''Qg5''' means "queen moves to the g-file and 5th rank" (that is, to the square g5). If there are two pieces of the same type that can move to the same square, one more letter or number is added to indicate the file or rank from which the piece moved, e.g. '''Ngf3''' means "knight from the g-file moves to the square f3". The letter ''P'' indicating a pawn is not used, so that '''e4''' means "pawn moves to the square e4".

If the piece makes a capture, "x" is inserted before the destination square. Thus '''Bxf3''' means "bishop captures on f3". When a pawn makes a capture, the file from which the pawn departed is used in place of a piece initial, and ranks may be omitted if unambiguous. For example, '''exd5''' (pawn on the e-file captures the piece on d5) or '''exd''' (pawn on the e-file captures a piece somewhere on the d-file).

[[File:Scholars mate animation.gif|frame|left|"[[Scholar's mate]]"]]

If a pawn moves to its last rank, achieving promotion, the piece chosen is indicated after the move, for example '''e1Q''' or '''e1=Q'''. Castling is indicated by the special notations '''0-0''' for [[kingside]] castling and '''0-0-0''' for [[queenside]] castling. An ''en passant'' capture is sometimes marked with the notation "e.p." A move that places the opponent's king in check usually has the notation "+" added. Checkmate can be indicated by "#" (occasionally "++", although this is sometimes used for a [[double check]] instead). At the end of the game, "1–0" means "White won", "0–1" means "Black won", and "½–½" indicates a draw.<ref>{{cite web

 | title=FIDE Laws of Chess
 | accessdate=2010-09-04
 | publisher=FIDE
}}</ref>

Chess moves can be annotated with [[punctuation (chess)|punctuation marks and other symbols]]. For example "!" indicates a good move, "!!" an excellent move, "?" a mistake, "??" a blunder, "!?" an interesting move that may not be best, or "?!" a dubious move not easily refuted.<ref name="Hooper & Whyld 1992, p. 92">Hooper & Whyld (1992), p. 92</ref>

For example, one variant of a simple trap known as the [[Scholar's mate]] (see animated diagram) can be recorded:

:'''1. e4 e5'''
:'''2. Qh5?! Nc6'''
:'''3. Bc4 Nf6??'''
:'''4. Qxf7# 1–0'''
{{clear}}

==Strategy and tactics==
Chess strategy consists of setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game – for example, where to place different pieces – while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These two parts of the chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play. A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: [[Chess opening|opening]], typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; then [[Chess middlegame|middlegame]]; and last the [[Chess endgame|endgame]], when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and [[pawn promotion]] is often decisive.

===Fundamentals of tactics===
{{Main|Chess tactics}}
In chess, tactics in general concentrate on short-term actions – so short-term that they can be calculated in advance by a human player or by a computer. The possible depth of calculation depends on the player's ability. In quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides, a deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical, while in "tactical" positions with a limited number of forced variations, strong players can calculate long sequences of moves.

Simple one-move or two-move tactical actions – threats, exchanges of [[Material (chess)|material]], and double attacks – can be combined into more complicated [[Combination (chess)|combinations]], sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players.<ref name="Harding 2003, p. 70ff">Harding (2003), p. 70ff</ref> Theoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers; for example, [[Pin (chess)|pins]], [[Fork (chess)|forks]], [[Skewer (chess)|skewers]], [[Battery (chess)|batteries]], [[discovered attack]]s (especially discovered checks), [[zwischenzug]]s, [[Deflection (chess)|deflections]], [[Decoy (chess)|decoys]], [[Sacrifice (chess)|sacrifices]], [[Undermining (chess)|underminings]], [[Overloading (chess)|overloadings]], and [[Interference (chess)|interferences]].<ref>Harding (2003), p. 8ff</ref>

A forced variation that involves a sacrifice and usually results in a tangible gain is called a [[Combination (chess)|combination]].<ref name="Harding 2003, p. 70ff"/> Brilliant combinations – such as those in the [[Immortal Game]] – are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers. A common type of chess exercise, aimed at developing players' skills, is showing players a position where a decisive combination is available and challenging them to find it.<ref>Burgess, Nunn, & Emms (2004), pp. 14–15</ref>
{{clear}}

===Fundamentals of strategy===
{{Main|Chess strategy}}
Chess strategy is concerned with evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term plans for the future play. During the evaluation, players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board, control of the center and centralization, the [[pawn structure]], king safety, and the control of key squares or groups of squares (for example, diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares).

The most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the [[Chess piece relative value|total value of pieces]] of both sides.<ref>Harding (2003), pp. 1–7</ref> The point values used for this purpose are based on experience; usually pawns are considered worth one point, knights and bishops about three points each, rooks about five points (the value difference between a rook and a bishop or knight being known as [[The exchange (chess)|the exchange]]), and queens about nine points. The king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined, since its checkmate loses the game. But in practical terms, in the endgame the king as a fighting piece is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but less powerful than a rook.<ref>Lasker (1934), p. 73</ref> These basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece (for example, advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares), coordination between pieces (for example, a pair of bishops usually coordinate better than a bishop and a knight), or the type of position (knights are generally better in [[Glossary of chess#Closed game|closed positions]] with many pawns while bishops are more powerful in [[Glossary of chess#Open game|open]] positions).<ref>Watson (1998), p. 163ff</ref>

Another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure (sometimes known as the pawn skeleton), or the configuration of pawns on the chessboard.<ref>Harding (2003), pp. 138ff</ref> Since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces, the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in the pawn structure, such as [[Isolated pawn|isolated]], [[Doubled pawns|doubled]], or [[backward pawn]]s and [[Chess terminology#Hole|holes]], once created, are often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset (for example, by the possibility of developing an attack).<ref>Evans (1958), pp. 22–67</ref>

==Phases==

===Opening===
{{Main|Chess opening}}

A chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game (the "opening moves"). Recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as ''openings'' and have been given names such as the [[Ruy Lopez]] or [[Sicilian Defence]]. They are catalogued in reference works such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]]''. There are dozens of different openings, varying widely in character from quiet [[Positional chess|positional]] play (for example, the [[Réti Opening]]) to very aggressive (the [[Latvian Gambit]]). In some opening lines, the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than 30 moves.<ref>Tamburro (2010), p. 18</ref> Professional players spend years studying openings and continue doing so throughout their careers, as [[Chess theory#Opening theory|opening theory]] continues to evolve.

The fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar:<ref>Tarrasch (1987)</ref>
* ''Development'': This is the technique of placing the pieces (particularly bishops and knights) on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the game.
* ''Control of the center'': Control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily, and can also have a cramping effect on the opponent.
* ''King safety'': It is critical to keep the king safe from dangerous possibilities. A correctly timed castling can often enhance this.
* ''[[Pawn structure]]'': Players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns, and pawn islands – and to force such weaknesses in the opponent's position.

Most players and [[Chess theory|theoreticians]] consider that White, by virtue of the first move, [[First-move advantage in chess|begins the game with a small advantage]]. This initially gives White the [[Initiative (chess)|initiative]].<ref>Evans (1958), p. 175</ref> Black usually strives to neutralize White's advantage and achieve [[Glossary of chess#Equalise/Equalize|equality]], or to develop [[Glossary of chess#Dynamism|dynamic]] [[List of chess terms#Counterplay|counterplay]] in an unbalanced position.

===Middlegame===
{{Main|Chess middlegame}}

The middlegame is the part of the game which starts after the opening. There is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame, but typically the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed. (Similarly, there is no clear transition from the middlegame to the endgame; see [[Chess endgame#The start of the endgame|start of the endgame]].) Because the [[Chess theory#Opening theory|opening theory]] has ended, players have to form plans based on the features of the position, and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position.<ref>Harding (2003), p. 32–151</ref> The middlegame is the phase in which most [[Combination (chess)|combinations]] occur. Combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain. Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent's king; some typical patterns have their own names; for example, the [[Boden's Mate]] or the [[Lasker - Bauer, Amsterdam, 1889|Lasker–Bauer]] combination.<ref>Hooper & Whyld (1992), p. 86</ref>

Specific plans or strategic themes will often arise from particular groups of openings which result in a specific type of [[pawn structure]]. An example is the [[Glossary of chess#Minority attack|minority attack]], which is the attack of [[queenside]] pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside. The study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middlegames.<ref>Silman (1998), pp. 202–5</ref>

Another important strategic question in the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transition into an endgame (i.e. [[Chess terms#Simplification|simplify]]). Minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame, and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending. Not every reduction of material is good for this purpose; for example, if one side keeps a light-squared bishop and the opponent has a dark-squared one, the transformation into a [[Chess endgame#Bishop and pawn endings|bishops and pawns]] ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only, because an endgame with [[opposite-colored bishops endgame|bishops on opposite colors]] is likely to be a draw, even with an advantage of a pawn, or sometimes even with a two-pawn advantage.<ref>Hooper & Whyld (1992), p. 373</ref>

The endgame (or ''end game'' or ''ending'') is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board. There are three main strategic differences between earlier stages of the game and endgame:<ref>Harding (2003), p. 187ff</ref>
* During the endgame, pawns become more important; endgames often revolve around attempting to [[Promotion (chess)|promote]] a pawn by advancing it to the eighth rank.
* The king, which has to be protected in the middlegame owing to the threat of checkmate, becomes a strong piece in the endgame. It is often brought to the center of the board where it can protect its own pawns, attack the pawns of opposite color, and hinder movement of the opponent's king.
* [[Zugzwang]], a disadvantage because the player has to make a move, is often a factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game. For example, the diagram on the right is zugzwang for both sides, as with Black to move he must play 1...Kb7 and let White promote a pawn after 2.Kd7; and with White to move he must allow a draw by 1.Kc6 stalemate or lose his last pawn by any other legal move.
Endgames can be classified according to the type of pieces that remain on board. [[Checkmate#Basic checkmates|Basic checkmates]] are positions in which one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces and can checkmate the opposing king, with the pieces working together with their king. For example, [[king and pawn endgame]]s involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns. Other more complicated endings are classified according to the pieces on board other than kings, such as the "[[rook and pawn versus rook endgame]]".

[[File:Shatranj.jpg|thumb|Iranian chess set, glazed [[fritware]], 12th century, [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
Chess is believed to have originated in [[Eastern India]] during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta empire]],<ref>Leibs (2004), p. 92</ref><ref>Robinson & Estes (1996), p. 34</ref><ref name="Murray (1913)">Murray (1913)</ref><ref>Bird (1893), p. 63</ref> where its early form in the 6th century was known as ''[[chaturanga|chaturaṅga]]'' ({{Lang-sa|चतुरङ्गक्रीडा}}), literally ''four divisions'' [of the military]&nbsp;– [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], [[war elephant|elephants]], and [[chariot]]ry, represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively. The earliest evidence of chess is found in the neighboring [[Sassanid Persia]] around 600, where the game came to be known by the name ''[[chatrang]]''. Chatrang is evoked in three epic romances written in Pahlavi ([[Middle Persian]]). Chatrang was taken up by the [[Muslim world]] after the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] (633–44), where it was then named ''[[shatranj]]'', with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names. In Spanish "shatranj" was rendered as ''ajedrez'' ("al-shatranj"), in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as ''xadrez'', and in [[Greek language|Greek]] as ζατρίκιον (''zatrikion'', which comes directly from the Persian ''chatrang''),<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dzatri%2Fkion ζατρίκιον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian ''shāh'' ("king"), which was familiar as an exclamation and became the English words "[[Check (chess)|check]]" and "chess".{{#tag:ref|At that time the Spanish word would have been written ''axedrez''. The Spanish "x" was pronounced as English "sh", as the Portuguese "x" still is today. The spelling of ''ajedrez'' changed after [[Spanish orthography#Older conventions|Spanish lost the "sh" sound]].|group=note}} Murray theorized that Muslim traders came to European seaports with ornamental chess kings as curios before they brought the game of chess.<ref name="Murray (1913)"/>

The game reached Western Europe and Russia by at least three routes, the earliest being in the 9th century. By the year 1000 it had spread throughout Europe.<ref name="Hooper & Whyld (1992), pp. 173–75">Hooper & Whyld (1992), pp. 173–75</ref> Introduced into the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the [[Moors]] in the 10th century, it was described in a famous 13th-century manuscript covering shatranj, [[backgammon]], and [[dice]] named the ''[[Libro de los juegos]]''. Another theory contends that chess arose from the game [[xiangqi]] (Chinese chess) or one of its predecessors,<ref>Li (1998)</ref> although this has been contested.<ref>{{cite web| last = Banaschak| first = Peter | title = A story well told is not necessarily true: a critical assessment of David H.

Around 1200, the rules of shatranj started to be modified in southern Europe, and around 1475, several major changes made the game essentially as it is known today.<ref name="Hooper & Whyld (1992), pp. 173–75"/> These modern rules for the basic moves had been adopted in Italy and Spain.<ref>Davidson (1949), p. 13–17</ref><ref name = "nauiua">{{cite web

Pawns gained the option of advancing two squares on their first move, while bishops and queens acquired their modern abilities. The [[Queen (chess)|queen]] replaced the earlier [[Vizier#Influence on chess|vizier]] chess piece towards the end of the 10th century and by the 15th century had become the most powerful piece;<ref>Yalom (2004)</ref> consequently modern chess was referred to as "Queen's Chess" or "Mad Queen Chess".<ref>Weissberger (2004), pp. 152ff</ref> These new rules quickly spread throughout western Europe.

Writings about the [[chess theory|theory]] of how to play chess began to appear in the 15th century. The ''Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez'' (''Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess'') by [[Spanish people|Spanish]] churchman [[Luis Ramirez de Lucena]] was published in [[Salamanca]] in 1497.<ref name = "nauiua"/> Lucena and later masters like [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Pedro Damiano]], [[Italians]] [[Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona]], [[Giulio Cesare Polerio]] and [[Gioachino Greco]], and Spanish bishop [[Ruy López de Segura]] developed elements of [[Chess opening|openings]] and started to analyze simple [[Chess endgame|endgames]].

In the 18th century, the center of European chess life moved from the Southern European countries to France. The two most important French masters were [[François-André Danican Philidor]], a musician by profession, who discovered the importance of pawns for chess strategy, and later [[Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais]], who won a famous series of matches with the [[Irish people|Irish]] master [[Alexander McDonnell]] in 1834.<ref>{{cite web

===Birth of a sport (1850–1945)===
[[File:immortal game animation.gif|frame|left|The "[[Immortal Game]]", Anderssen–Kieseritzky, 1851]]
The first modern chess tournament was organized by [[Howard Staunton]], a leading English chess player, and was [[London 1851 chess tournament|held in London in 1851]]. It was won by the relatively unknown German [[Adolf Anderssen]], who was hailed as the leading chess master, and his brilliant, energetic attacking style became typical for the time, although it was later regarded as [[chess strategy|strategically]] shallow.<ref>{{cite web

Deeper insight into the nature of chess came with two younger players. American [[Paul Morphy]], an extraordinary [[chess prodigy]], won against all important competitors (except [[Howard Staunton]], who refused to play), including Anderssen, during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863. Morphy's success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy; he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks.<ref>Shibut (2004)</ref> [[Prague]]-born [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] later described how to avoid weaknesses in one's own position and how to create and exploit such weaknesses in the opponent's position.<ref>Steinitz (2002)</ref> The scientific approach and positional understanding of Steinitz revolutionized the game. Steinitz was the first to break a position down into its components.<ref>Kasparov (2003a), p. 6</ref> Before Steinitz, players brought their queen out early, did not completely [[development (chess)|develop]] their other pieces, and mounted a quick attack on the opposing king, which either succeeded or failed. The level of defense was poor and players did not form any deep plan.<ref>Kasparov (2003a), p. 11</ref> In addition to his theoretical achievements, Steinitz founded an important tradition: his triumph over the leading German master [[Johannes Zukertort]] in 1886 is regarded as the first official [[World Chess Championship]]. Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger player, the German mathematician [[Emanuel Lasker]], who maintained this title for 27 years, the longest tenure of all World Champions.<ref>Kasparov (1983a), p. 117</ref>
[[File:Stanislaw Chlebowski - Chess Players.jpg|right|thumb|''Chess Players in late 19th Century [[Istanbul]]'', by [[Stanisław Chlebowski]]]]
After the end of the 19th century, the number of master tournaments and matches held annually quickly grew. Some sources state that in 1914 the title of [[International Grandmaster|chess Grandmaster]] was first formally conferred by Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] to Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, [[Siegbert Tarrasch|Tarrasch]], and [[Frank Marshall (chess player)|Marshall]], but this is a disputed claim.{{#tag:ref|This is stated in ''The Encyclopaedia of Chess'' (1970, p.223) by [[Anne Sunnucks]], but is disputed by [[Edward Winter (chess historian)]] in his [http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter38.html Chess Notes 5144 and 5152].|group=note}} The tradition of awarding such titles was continued by the World Chess Federation ([[FIDE]]), founded in 1924 in Paris. In 1927, the [[Women's World Chess Championship]] was established; the first to hold the title was [[Czech people|Czech]]-English master [[Vera Menchik]].<ref>{{cite web

It took a prodigy from [[Cuba]], [[José Raúl Capablanca]] (World Champion 1921–27), who loved simple positions and endgames, to end the German-speaking dominance in chess; he was undefeated in tournament play for eight years, until 1924. His successor was Russian-French [[Alexander Alekhine]], a strong attacking player who died as the World champion in 1946. He briefly lost the title to [[Dutch people|Dutch]] player [[Max Euwe]] in 1935 and regained it two years later.<ref>Kasparov (1983b), p. 9</ref>

Between the world wars, chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school of so-called [[Hypermodernism (chess)|hypermodernists]] like [[Aron Nimzowitsch]] and [[Richard Réti]]. They advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawns, which invited opponents to occupy the center with pawns, which become objects of attack.<ref>Hooper & Whyld (1992), p. 178</ref>

===Post-war era (1945 and later)===
<!-- [[File:Capablanca-Lasker 1925.jpg|thumb|left|World Champions [[José Raúl Capablanca]] (left) and [[Emanuel Lasker]] in 1925]] -->

After the death of Alekhine, a new World Champion was sought. FIDE, who have controlled the title since then (except for one interruption), ran a tournament of elite players. The winner of the [[World Chess Championship 1948|1948 tournament]], Russian [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], started an era of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] dominance in the chess world. Until the end of the Soviet Union, there was only one non-Soviet champion, American [[Bobby Fischer]] (champion 1972–75).<ref>Kasparov (2003b), pp. 7–8</ref> Botvinnik revolutionized opening theory. Previously Black strove for equality, to neutralize White's [[first-move advantage in chess|first-move advantage]]. As Black, Botvinnik strove for the initiative from the beginning.<ref>Kasparov (2003b), p. 7</ref> In the previous informal system of World Championships, the current champion decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match. FIDE set up a new system of qualifying tournaments and matches. The world's strongest players were seeded into [[Interzonal]] tournaments, where they were joined by players who had qualified from Zonal tournaments. The leading finishers in these Interzonals would go on the "[[Candidates Tournament|Candidates]]" stage, which was initially a tournament, and later a series of knockout matches. The winner of the Candidates would then play the reigning champion for the title. A champion defeated in a match had a right to play a rematch a year later. This system operated on a three-year cycle. Botvinnik participated in championship matches over a period of fifteen years. He won the world championship tournament in 1948 and retained the title in tied matches in 1951 and 1954. In 1957, he lost to [[Vasily Smyslov]], but regained the title in a rematch in 1958. In 1960, he lost the title to the 23-year-old [[Latvia]]n prodigy [[Mikhail Tal]], an accomplished [[Chess tactics|tactician]] and attacking player. Botvinnik again regained the title in a rematch in 1961.

Following the 1961 event, FIDE abolished the automatic right of a deposed champion to a rematch, and the next champion, [[Armenia]]n [[Tigran Petrosian]], a player renowned for his defensive and positional skills, held the title for two cycles, 1963–69. His successor, [[Boris Spassky]] from Russia (champion 1969–72), won games in both positional and sharp tactical style.<ref>Kasparov (2004a), pp, 5–6; Kasparov (2003b), p, 8</ref> The next championship, the so-called [[World Chess Championship 1972|Match of the Century]], saw the first non-Soviet challenger since World War II, American [[Bobby Fischer]], who defeated his Candidates opponents by unheard-of margins and clearly won the world championship match. In 1975, however, Fischer refused to defend his title against Soviet [[Anatoly Karpov]] when FIDE did not meet his demands, and Karpov obtained the title by default.<ref>Kasparov (2004b), pp. 5–6</ref> Fischer modernized many aspects of chess, especially by extensively preparing openings.<ref>Kasparov (2003a), p. 8</ref>

Karpov defended his title twice against [[Viktor Korchnoi]] and dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with a string of tournament successes.<ref>Kasparov (2004b), pp. 5–6; Kasparov (2006), pp. 5–6</ref> Karpov's reign finally ended in 1985 at the hands of [[Garry Kasparov]], another Soviet player from [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]. Kasparov and Karpov contested five world title matches between 1984 and 1990; Karpov never won his title back.<ref>Keene (1993), p. 16</ref> In 1993, Garry Kasparov and [[Nigel Short]] broke with FIDE to organize their own match for the title and formed a competing [[Professional Chess Association]] (PCA). From then until 2006, there were two simultaneous World Champions and World Championships: the PCA or Classical champion extending the Steinitzian tradition in which the current champion plays a challenger in a series of many games, and the other following FIDE's new format of many players competing in a tournament to determine the champion. Kasparov lost his Classical title in [[Classical World Chess Championship 2000|2000]] to [[Vladimir Kramnik]] of Russia.<ref>{{cite news

===Pre-modern===
In the [[Middle Ages]] and during the [[Renaissance]], chess was a part of [[Nobility|noble]] culture; it was used to teach war strategy and was dubbed the "[[Chess or the King's Game|King's Game]]".<ref>Vale (2001), pp. 170–99</ref> Gentlemen are "to be meanly seene in the play at Chestes", says the overview at the beginning of [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' (1528, English 1561 by Sir Thomas Hoby), but chess should not be a gentleman's main passion. Castiglione explains it further:

<blockquote>And what say you to the game at chestes?

It is truely<!--sic--> an honest kynde of enterteynmente and wittie, quoth Syr Friderick.

Many of the elaborate chess sets used by the aristocracy have been lost, but others partially survive, such as the [[Lewis chessmen]].

Chess was often used as a basis of sermons on [[morality]]. An example is ''Liber de moribus hominum et officiis nobilium sive super ludo scacchorum'' ('Book of the customs of men and the duties of nobles or the Book of Chess'), written by an Italian [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monk [[Jacobus de Cessolis]] c. 1300. This book was one of the most popular of the Middle Ages.<ref>Olmert (1996), p. 127</ref> The work was translated into many other languages (the first printed edition was published at Utrecht in 1473) and was the basis for [[William Caxton]]'s ''The Game and Playe of the Chesse'' (1474), one of the first books printed in English.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/212/1303.html The Introduction of Printing into England and the Early Work of the Press: The First Book printed in English], from ''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]'', Vol II. (1907) Online at bartleby.com. Retrieved 12 December 2006.</ref> Different chess pieces were used as metaphors for different classes of people, and human duties were derived from the rules of the game or from visual properties of the chess pieces:<ref>Adams (2006)</ref>

Known in the circles of clerics, students, and merchants, chess entered into the popular culture of Middle Ages. An example is the 209th song of [[Carmina Burana]] from the 13th century, which starts with the names of chess pieces, ''Roch, pedites, regina...''<ref>{{cite web

===Modern===
During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], chess was viewed as a means of self-improvement. [[Benjamin Franklin]], in his article "[[The Morals of Chess]]" (1750), wrote:

<blockquote>
The Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement; several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired and strengthened by it, so as to become habits ready on all occasions; for life is a kind of Chess, in which we have often points to gain, and competitors or adversaries to contend with, and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events, that are, in some degree, the effect of prudence, or the want of it. By playing at Chess then, we may learn:

'''I. Foresight''', which looks a little into futurity, and considers the consequences that may attend an action [...]

'''II. Circumspection''', which surveys the whole Chess-board, or scene of action: – the relation of the several Pieces, and their situations [...]

'''III. Caution''', not to make our moves too hastily [...]<ref>Franklin (1779)</ref>
</blockquote>

[[File:Red King sleeping.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'': the Red King is snoring. Illustration by [[John Tenniel]] ]]
With these or similar hopes, chess is taught to children in schools around the world today. Many schools host chess clubs, and there are many scholastic tournaments specifically for children. Tournaments are held regularly in many countries, hosted by organizations such as the [[United States Chess Federation]] and the National Scholastic Chess Foundation.<ref>{{cite web

Chess is often depicted in the [[Chess in the arts and literature|arts]]; significant works where chess plays a key role range from Thomas Middleton's ''[[A Game at Chess]]'' to ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' by Lewis Carroll to ''[[The Royal Game]]'' by Stefan Zweig and Vladimir Nabokov's ''[[The Defense]]''. The [[Thriller(genre)|thriller]] film ''[[Knight Moves]]'' is about a chess grandmaster who is accused of being a [[serial killer]]. Chess is featured in films like Ingmar Bergman's ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' and Satyajit Ray's ''[[The Chess Players]]''. Chess is also present in the contemporary popular culture. For example, J. K. Rowling's [[Harry Potter]] plays "[[Wizard's Chess]]", while the characters of ''[[Star Trek]]'' prefer "[[Tri-dimensional chess|Tri-Dimensional Chess]]". The hero of ''[[Searching for Bobby Fischer]]'' struggles against adopting the [[aggression|aggressive]] and [[misanthropic]] views of a world chess champion.<ref>{{cite web

==Composition==
{{Main|Chess problem}}
Chess composition is the art of creating chess problems (the problems themselves are sometimes also called chess compositions). A person who creates such problems is known as a [[chess composer]].<ref>Howard (1961)</ref> There are many types of chess problems. The two most important are:
* '''Directmates''': white to move first and checkmate black within a specified number of moves against any defense. These are often referred to as "mate in ''n''" – for example "mate in three" (a ''three-mover'').<ref>Hooper & Whyld (1992), p. 110</ref>
* '''[[Endgame study|Studies]]''': orthodox problems in which the stipulation is that white to play must win or draw. Almost all studies are [[Chess endgame|endgame]] positions.<ref>Hooper & Whyld (1992), pp. 400–401</ref>

Chess composition is a distinct branch of chess sport, and tournaments (or ''tourneys'') exist for both the composition and solving of chess problems.<ref>Weenink (1926)</ref>

===Example===
{{Main|Réti endgame study}}
This is one of the most famous chess studies; it was published by [[Richard Réti]] in 1921. It seems impossible to catch the advanced black pawn, while the black king can easily stop the white pawn. The solution is a [[diagonal]] advance, which brings the king to ''both'' pawns simultaneously:

'''1. Kg7! h4 2. Kf6! Kb6'''
:Or 2...h3 3.Ke7 and the white king can support its pawn.

'''3. Ke5!!
:Now the white king comes just in time to support his pawn, or catch the black one.

'''3... h3 4. Kd6 draw'''<ref>de la Villa (2008), pp.179–80</ref>

==Competitive play==

===Organization of competitions===
Contemporary chess is an organized sport with structured international and national leagues, tournaments, and [[congress]]es. Chess's international governing body is [[FIDE]] (Fédération Internationale des Échecs). Most countries have a national chess organization as well (such as the [[United States Chess Federation|US Chess Federation]] and [[English Chess Federation]]) which in turn is a member of FIDE. FIDE is a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]],<ref>{{cite web

Other competitions for individuals include the [[World Junior Chess Championship]], the [[European Individual Chess Championship]], and the [[List of national chess championships|National Chess Championships]]. Invitation-only tournaments regularly attract the world's strongest players. Examples include Spain's [[Linares chess tournament|Linares]] event, Monte Carlo's [[Melody Amber]] tournament, the [[Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting|Dortmund Sparkassen]] meeting, Sofia's [[M-tel Masters]], and Wijk aan Zee's [[Tata Steel Chess Tournament|Tata Steel]] tournament.

Regular team chess events include the [[Chess Olympiad]] and the [[European Team Chess Championship]]. The [[World Chess Solving Championship]] and World [[Correspondence Chess]] Championships include both team and individual events.

Besides these prestigious competitions, there are thousands of other chess tournaments, matches, and festivals held around the world every year catering to players of all levels. Chess is promoted as a "mind sport" by the [[Mind Sports Organisation]], alongside other [[mental-skill game]]s such as [[Contract Bridge]], [[Go (board game)|Go]], and [[Scrabble]].

}}</ref>
* ''[[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]]'' (shortened as GM; sometimes ''International Grandmaster'' or IGM is used) is awarded to world-class chess masters. Apart from World Champion, Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain. Before FIDE will confer the title on a player, the player must have an [[Elo rating system|Elo chess rating]] (see below) of at least 2500 at one time and three favorable results (called norms) in tournaments involving other grandmasters, including some from countries other than the applicant's. There are other milestones a player can achieve to attain the title, such as winning the World Junior Championship.
* ''[[International Master]]'' (shortened as IM). The conditions are similar to GM, but less demanding. The minimum rating for the IM title is 2400.
* ''[[FIDE Master]]'' (shortened as FM). The usual way for a player to qualify for the FIDE Master title is by achieving a FIDE rating of 2300 or more.
* ''[[Candidate Master]]'' (shortened as CM). Similar to FM, but with a FIDE rating of at least 2200.
All the titles are open to men and women. Separate women-only titles, such as Woman Grandmaster (WGM), are available. Beginning with [[Nona Gaprindashvili]] in 1978, a number of women have earned the GM title, and most of the top ten women in 2006 hold the unrestricted GM title.<ref group=note name="FIDE_top_players">Current FIDE lists of top players with their titles are online at {{cite web

As of August 2011, there are 1363 active grandmasters and 3153 international masters in the world. Top three countries with the largest numbers of grandmasters are [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Germany]], with 208, 78, and 76. The country with most grandmasters per capita is [[Iceland]], with 11 GMs and 13 IMs among the population of 310,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ratings.fide.com/topfed.phtml?tops=0&ina=1&country=|title=Federations Ranking}}</ref>

International titles are awarded to composers and solvers of chess problems and to correspondence chess players (by the [[International Correspondence Chess Federation]]). National chess organizations may also award titles, usually to the advanced players still under the level needed for international titles; an example is the [[Chess expert]] title used in the United States.

In order to rank players, FIDE, [[International Correspondence Chess Federation|ICCF]], and national chess organizations use the [[Elo rating system]] developed by [[Arpad Elo]]. Elo is a [[Statistical model|statistical system]] based on the assumption that the chess performance of each player in their games is a random variable. Arpad Elo thought of a player's true skill as the average of that player's performance random variable, and showed how to estimate the average from results of player's games. The [[US Chess Federation]] implemented Elo's suggestions in 1960, and the system quickly gained recognition as being both fairer and more accurate than older systems; it was adopted by FIDE in 1970.{{#tag:ref|For the official process see {{cite web

The game structure and nature of chess is related to several branches of mathematics. Many [[combinatorics|combinatorical]] and [[topology|topological]] problems connected to chess were known of for hundreds of years. In 1913, [[Ernst Zermelo]] used chess as a basis for his theory of game strategies, which is considered as one of the predecessors of [[game theory]].<ref>Zermelo, Ernst (1913), Uber eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels, Proceedings of the Fifth International Congress of Mathematicians 2, 501–4.

One of the most important mathematical challenges of chess is the development of [[algorithm]]s that can play chess. The idea of creating a chess-playing machine dates to the 18th century; around 1769, the chess-playing [[automaton]] called [[The Turk]] became famous before being exposed as a [[hoax]].<ref>Levitt (2000)</ref> Serious trials based on automatons, such as [[El Ajedrecista]], were too complex and limited to be useful.

Since the advent of the [[digital computer]] in the 1950s, chess enthusiasts, [[computer engineer]]s and computer scientists have built, with increasing degrees of seriousness and success, chess-playing machines and computer programs.<ref>Hsu, F.

There is an extensive scientific literature on chess psychology.{{#tag:ref|A survey is given in [http://jeays.net/files/psychchess.htm Mark Jeays, "A brief survey of psychological studies of chess"].|group=note}}{{#tag:ref|Chess is even called the "[[drosophila]]" of [[cognitive psychology]] and artificial intelligence ([[AI]]) studies, because it represents the domain in which expert performance has been most intensively studied and measured.<ref>Grabner, Stern, & Neubauer (2007) pp. 398–420</ref>|group=note}}<ref>De Groot & Gobet (1996)</ref><ref>Gobet, de Voogt, & Retschitzki (2004)
</ref><ref>Holding (1985)</ref><ref>Saariluoma (1995)</ref> [[Alfred Binet]] and others showed that [[knowledge]] and verbal, rather than visuospatial, ability lies at the core of expertise.<ref>Binet (1894)</ref><ref>Robbins (1996), pp. 83–93</ref> In his doctoral thesis, [[Adriaan de Groot]] showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position.<ref>de Groot (1946)</ref> According to de Groot, this [[perception]], made possible by years of practice and study, is more important than the sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly. The ability to memorize does not alone account for chess-playing skill, since masters and novices, when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces, had equivalent recall (about half a dozen positions in each case). Rather, it is the ability to recognize patterns, which are then memorized, which distinguished the skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game, the masters had almost total positional recall.<ref>Richards J. Heuer, Jr. ''Psychology of Intelligence Analysis'' Center for the Study of Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency 1999 (see [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/art6.html Chapter 3]).</ref>

More recent research has focused on [[chess as mental training]]; the respective roles of knowledge and look-ahead search; [[brain imaging]] studies of chess masters and novices; [[blindfold chess]]; the role of [[Personality psychology|personality]] and [[intelligence]] in chess skill; gender differences; and computational models of chess expertise. The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to a lot of research recently. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess.<ref>Ericsson, K. A., Krampe, R. Th., & Tesch-Römer, C. (1993). {{PDFlink| [http://web.archive.org/web/19960101-re_/http://www.freakonomics.com/pdf/DeliberatePractice%28PsychologicalReview%29.pdf The role of deliberate practice in the acquisition of expert performance.] |1.25&nbsp;MB}} ''Psychological Review'', 100, 363–406. Retrieved 2010-05-20.</ref> Recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important. For example, [[Fernand Gobet]] and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere are more likely to have been born in late winter and early spring. Chess players are more likely to be non-right-handed, though they found no correlation between handedness and skill.<ref>Gobet, F. & Chassy, P. (in press). {{PDFlink| [http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/736/1/Seasonality%20and%20chess.pdf Season of birth and chess expertise.] |65.8&nbsp;KB}} ''Journal of Biosocial Science''. <br> Gobet, F. & Campitelli, G.

===Chess and intelligence===
Although the link between performance in chess and [[intelligence|general intelligence]] is often assumed, researchers have largely failed to confirm its existence.<ref>Binet, A. (1966). Mnemonic virtuosity: A study of chess players. Genetic Psychology, Monographs, 74, 127–162</ref> For example, a 2006 study found no differences in fluid intelligence, as measured by [[Raven's Progressive Matrices]], between strong adult chess players and regular people.<ref>Unterrainer, J. M., Kaller, C. P., Halsband U., & Rahm. B. (2006). Planning abilities and chess: A comparison of chess and non-chess players on the Tower of London. British Journal of Psychology, 97, 299–311.</ref> There is some evidence towards a correlation between performance in chess and intelligence among beginning players. However, performance in chess also relies substantially on one's experience playing the game, and the role of experience may overwhelm the role of intelligence. Chess experts are estimated to have in excess of 10,000 and possibly as many as 300,000 position patterns stored in their memory; long training is necessary to acquire that amount of data.<ref name="Bilalic">{{cite journal|title=Does chess need intelligence? — A study with young chess players|author=Merim Bilalić, Peter McLeod, Fernand Gobet|journal=Intelligence|volume=35|date=September–October 2007|pages=457–470|url=http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/642/1/Does%20Chess%20Need%20Intelligence-revision-finalINT.pdf}}</ref>

A 2007 study of young chess players in the United Kingdom found that strong players tended to have above-average IQ scores, but, within that group, the correlation between chess skill and IQ was moderately negative, meaning that smarter children tended to achieve a lower level of chess skill. This result was explained by a negative correlation between intelligence and practice in the elite subsample, and by practice having a higher influence on chess skill.<ref name="Bilalic" />

==Variants==
[[File:Hexagonal chess.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|[[Hexagonal chess#Gliński's hexagonal chess|Gliński's hexagonal chess]]]]
{{Main|Chess variant}}
Chess variants are forms of chess where the game is played using a different board (e.g. [[hexagonal chess]] or [[Three-dimensional chess|3D chess]]), different rules, or special [[Fairy chess piece|fairy pieces]]. There are more than two thousand published variants, the most popular being [[xiangqi]] in China and [[shogi]] in Japan.<ref>Pritchard (2000)</ref><ref>Pritchard (1994)</ref> Chess variants can include, but are not limited to:
* direct predecessors of chess ([[chaturanga]] and [[shatranj]]);
* traditional national or regional variants like xiangqi, shogi, [[janggi]] (Korea), and [[makruk]] (Thailand), which share common predecessors with Western chess;
* [[Hexagonal chess|hexagonal variants]], such as Gliński's hexagonal chess, popular in the 1930s;
* modern variants such as [[Chess960]], where the starting position is [[Chess960#Rules|selected randomly]], removing the opportunity to play prepared [[Chess opening|opening lines]].<ref>Verwer (2010), p. 63</ref>
