'''The Beach Boys''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in [[Hawthorne, California]] in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers [[Brian Wilson|Brian]], [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]] and [[Carl Wilson]], their cousin [[Mike Love]], and friend [[Al Jardine]]. Initially managed by the Wilsons' father [[Murry Wilson|Murry]], the Beach Boys signed to [[Capitol Records]] in 1962. The band's early music gained popularity across the United States for its [[close harmony|close vocal harmonies]] and lyrics reflecting a [[Southern California]] youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. By the mid-1960s, Brian Wilson's growing creative ambition and songwriting ability would dominate the group's musical direction. The primarily Wilson-composed ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album and "[[Good Vibrations]]" single (both released in 1966) featured a complex, intricate and multi-layered sound that represented a departure from the simple [[surf rock]] of the Beach Boys' early years.

Starting in 1967, Wilson gradually ceded control to the rest of the band, assuming a reduced level of input due to mental health and substance abuse issues. Though the more democratic incarnation of the Beach Boys recorded a string of albums in various musical styles that garnered international critical success, the group struggled to reclaim their commercial momentum in America despite once being seen as the primary competitors to [[the Beatles]]. Since the 1980s, there has been much publicized legal-wrangling over royalties, songwriting credits, and use of the band's name. Dennis Wilson drowned in 1983, and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998. After Carl's death, a number of versions of the band, each fronted by surviving members from the original quintet, continued to tour into the 2000s. For the band's 50th anniversary, they briefly reunited as the Beach Boys for a [[That's Why God Made the Radio|new studio album]], [[The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour|world tour]], and [[Made in California|career-spanning retrospective box set]].

==1958–1966: The Beach Boys under Brian Wilson==

===Formation and first years (1958–61)===
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2013}}
[[File:Beach Boys Landmark - Plano general I.jpg|thumb|right|[[Beach Boys Historic Landmark|A historical landmark]] at 3701 W. 119th St., Hawthorne, California marking where the Wilson family home once stood]]
At age 16, Brian Wilson shared a bedroom with his brothers, Dennis and Carl, in their family home in Hawthorne. He watched his father, [[Murry Wilson]], play piano and listened intently to the harmonies of vocal groups like [[the Four Freshmen]]. One night he taught his brothers a song called "Ivory Tower" and how to sing the background harmonies. For his 16th birthday, Brian was given a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorder]]. He learned how to [[overdub]], using his vocals and those of Carl and their mother. Brian would play piano with Carl and [[David Marks (musician)|David Marks]] (an eleven-year-old longtime neighbor) playing the guitars they got as Christmas presents.<ref name="Stebbins-18">{{cite book | last = Stebbins |first = Jon | coauthor = David Marks | title = The Lost Beach Boy | publisher = Virgin Books | location = London | year = 2007 | page =18 | isbn = 978-1-85227-391-0}}</ref>

Soon Brian was avidly listening to [[Johnny Otis]] on his KFOX radio show, a favorite station of Carl's. Inspired by the simple structure and vocals of the [[rhythm and blues]] songs he heard, he changed his piano-playing style and started writing songs. His enthusiasm interfered with his music studies at school.

Family gatherings brought the Wilsons in contact with cousin [[Mike Love]]. Brian taught Love's sister Maureen and a friend harmonies. Later, Brian, Mike Love and two friends performed at [[Hawthorne High School (Hawthorne, California)|Hawthorne High School]]. Brian also knew Al Jardine, a high school classmate who had already played guitar in a folk group called the Islanders.

Brian suggested to Jardine that they team up with his cousin and brother Carl. It was at these sessions, held in Brian's bedroom, that "the Beach Boys sound" began to form. Brian says: "Everyone contributed something. Carl kept us hip to the latest tunes, Al taught us his repertoire of folk songs, and Dennis, though he didn't [then] play anything, added a combustible spark just by his presence." Love encouraged Brian to write songs and gave the fledgling band its name: "The Pendletones", a combination of "[[Pendleton Woolen Mills|Pendleton]]" a style of woolen shirt popular at the time and "[[Musical tone|tone]]" the musical term. In their earliest performances, the band wore the heavy wool jacket-like shirts, which were favored by surfers in the South Bay. Although [[surfing]] motifs were very prominent in their early songs, Dennis was the only avid surfer in the group.<ref name=pc20/>

Jardine and a singer friend, Gary Winfrey, went to Brian's to see if he could help out with a version of a folk song they wanted to record—"[[Sloop John B]]". In Brian's absence, the two spoke with Murry, a music industry veteran of modest success. The group performed a slower ballad, "[[Their Hearts Were Full of Spring]]", but failed to impress the Morgans. After an awkward pause, Dennis mentioned they had an original song, "Surfin'".

With help from Love, Brian finished the song and the group rented guitars, drums, amplifiers and microphones. They practiced for three days while the Wilsons' parents were on a short vacation. In October, the Pendletones recorded twelve takes of "Surfin'" in the Morgans' cramped offices, David Marks was not present at the session as he was at school.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/exclusive-q-a-original-beach-boy-david-marks-on-the-bands-anniversary-tour-20120316 |title=Exclusive QA: Original Beach Boy David Marks on the Band's Anniversary Tour &#124; Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2012-03-16 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref> A small number of singles were pressed. When the boys eagerly unpacked the first box of singles, on the [[Candix Records]] label, they were shocked to see their band name changed to "Beach Boys". Murry Wilson, now intimately involved with the band's fortunes, called the Morgans. Apparently a young promotion worker, Russ Regan, made the change to more obviously tie the group in with other surf bands of the time.

Released in December 1961, "[[Surfin' (song)|Surfin']]" was soon aired on [[KFWB]] and [[KRLA]], two of Los Angeles' most influential teen radio stations. It was a hit on the West Coast, going to number three in Southern California, and peaked at number 75 on the national pop charts.<ref name="photobucket13">"The Beach Boy Empire" Taylor, Derek. October 5, 1966. Hit Parader, p13. http://i351.photobucket.com/albums/q476/marcus1970/hit%20parader%201966/HitParaderp6October1966.jpg.</ref> By the final weeks of 1961 "Surfin'" had sold more than 40,000 copies.<ref name="photobucket13"/> Murry Wilson told the boys he did not like "Surfin'". By now the de facto manager of the Beach Boys, Murry got the group's first paying gig on New Year's Eve, 1961, at the [[Ritchie Valens]] Memorial Dance in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], headlined by [[Ike & Tina Turner]]. Brian recalls how he wondered what they were doing there: "five clean-cut, unworldly white boys from a conservative white suburb, in an auditorium full of black kids". Brian describes the night as an "education"—he knew afterwards that success was all about "R&B, rock and roll, and money".

===Early successes with surf and hot rod-themed rock (1962–64)===

Although Murry effectively seized managerial control of the band without consultation, Brian acknowledges that he "deserves credit for getting us off the ground... he hounded us mercilessly... [but] also worked hard himself". In the first half of February 1962, Jardine left the band and was replaced by Marks. The band duly recorded two more originals on April 19 at Western Studios, Los Angeles; "Lonely Sea" and "[[409 (song)|409]]", also re-recording "[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]". On June 4, the band released their second single "Surfin' Safari" backed with "409". The release prompted national coverage in the June 9 issue of ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' where the magazine praised Love's lead vocal and deemed the song to have strong hit potential.<ref>{{cite journal | date = June 9, 1962 |title=Reviews of New Singles |journal=Billboard Magazine |volume= 74 |issue= 23 |page=40 |publisher= Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |doi= |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=sSkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PP4 |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref>

After being turned down by [[Dot Records|Dot]] and [[Liberty Records|Liberty]], the Beach Boys eventually signed a seven-year contract with [[Capitol Records]] on July 16 based on the strength of the June demo session.<ref name="photobucket13"/> By November, their first album was ready—''[[Surfin' Safari]]'' which reached 32 on the US Billboard charts.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/r1405|title= Richie Unterberger review of Surfin' Safari|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate =May 25, 2011}}</ref> Their song output continued along the same commercial line, focusing on California youth lifestyle.<ref name=pc20>{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19770/m1/ |title=Show 20 – Forty Miles of Bad Road: Some of the best from rock 'n' roll's dark ages.

In January 1963, three months after the release of their debut album, the band began recording their sophomore effort, ''[[Surfin' U.S.A.]]'', an album which placed a greater emphasis on surf rock instrumentals and tighter production values. It has been hypothesized that the shift to a sound more typical of the surf rock genre was in response to the Californian surfer locals who were dismissive of the band's debut as it strayed from the sound of other surf acts of the era. After the moderate success of ''Surfin' Safari'', ''Surfin' U.S.A.'', released on March 25, 1963 met a more enthusiastic reception, reaching number two on the Billboard charts and propelling the band into a nationwide spotlight. Five days prior to the release of ''Surfin' U.S.A.'' Brian produced "[[Surf City (song)|Surf City]]", a song he had written for [[Jan and Dean]]. "Surf City" hit number one on the ''Billboard'' charts in July 1963, a development that pleased Brian but angered Murry, who felt his son had "given away" what should have been the Beach Boys' first chart-topper.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Sometime around late 1963, Brian Wilson heard the song "[[Be My Baby]]" by [[the Ronettes]] for the first time, which "revamped" Wilson's creative interests and songwriting.<ref name=groove/> "Be My Baby" was later claimed by critics to be the epitome of [[Phil Spector]]'s [[Wall of Sound]] production,<ref>{{cite web | url= {{Allmusic|class=song|id=t130103|pure_url=yes}} | title= "Be My Baby" Song Review | last= Ankeny | first= Jason | publisher= allmusic.com}}</ref> a recording method Wilson would hold an enduring fascination with for the next several decades. Wilson later in life stated: "I was unable to really think as a producer until I really got familiar with Phil Spector's work."<ref name=groove>''Rock'n Roll In The Groove'' http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=tn_0JNiqLio#t=196s</ref> Apart from Murry, Phil Spector, and the close vocal harmonies of Brian's favorite groups, early inspiration came from the driving rock-and-roll sound of [[Chuck Berry]].<ref name="A Boy's own story">{{cite journal |first=Sean |last=O'Hagan |title=Feature: ''A Boy's own story'' |journal=Review, [[The Observer]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |issue=January 6, 2002 |pages=1–3}}</ref><ref>Lambert, Philip.

At the beginning of a tour of the Mid-West in April 1963, Jardine rejoined the Beach Boys at Brian's request.<ref name="The Beach Boys">{{cite web|url=http://www.thebeachboys.com/home.aspx |title=The Beach Boys |publisher=The Beach Boys |accessdate=November 23, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref> As Jardine began playing live gigs again, Brian left the road to focus on writing and recording. Around this time, Brian began utilizing members of [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]], session musicians also used by his favorite producer Phil Spector. The session musicians were never an outright replacement for members of the band, rather used to augment arrangements or perfect takes in a shorter amount of time to adhere to the fast-paced recording environment that the early-sixties forced onto the group. The result of this arrangement produced the albums ''[[Surfer Girl]]'', released on September 16, 1963 and ''[[Little Deuce Coupe]]'', released less than a month later on October 7, 1963. This sextet incarnation of the Beach Boys didn't extend beyond these two albums however as Marks officially left the band in early October due to conflict with manager Murry Wilson, resulting in Brian having to tour once more.<ref>{{cite web |title=GIGS63 |first=Andrew G. |last=Doe |authorlink= |year=2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2012 |url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/gigs63.html}}</ref>

Following a successful Australasian tour in January and February 1964, the band returned home to be greeted by the Beatles leading the charge of the British invasion through their appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show. Reportedly, Brian Wilson wished to have more time to complete the album they had been working on earlier in the year, yet their record label insisted they finish recording swiftly to avoid being forgotten in the throes of the impending "invasion". Satisfying these demands, the band hastily finished the sessions on February 20, 1964 and titled the album ''[[Shut Down Volume 2]]''. Critics have found evaluating the album's worth difficult through the years. Though songs like "[[The Warmth of the Sun]]" and "[[Don't Worry Baby]]" are widely acclaimed and seen as impressive milestones in the artistic growth of the band, certain tracks, largely those quickly recorded to satisfy Capitol's demands, are often received with less enthusiasm.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.allmusic.com/album/shut-down-vol-2-r60307|title= Ritchie Unterberger review of Shut Down Vol. 2 |publisher=Allmusic|accessdate =April 23, 2011}}</ref>

In April 1964, during recording of the single "[[I Get Around]]", Murry was relieved of his duties as manager. Brian reflected, "We love the family thing - y'know: three brothers, a cousin and a friend is a really beautiful way to have a group - but the extra generation can become a hang-up".<ref name="photobucket13"/> When the single was released in May of that month, it would climb to the number one position on the Billboard charts, the first such feat the Beach Boys had accomplished. Two months later, the album that the song later appeared on, ''[[All Summer Long (album)|All Summer Long]]'', reached number four on the Billboard 200 charts and has been cited by some as the best early-Beach Boys album.<ref>{{cite web|last=Unterberger |first=Richie |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/all-summer-long-mw0000319105 |title=All Summer Long - The Beach Boys : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=1964-07-13 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref> The album was also a swan-song to the surf and car music the Beach Boys built their commercial standing upon, with the albums that followed ''All Summer Long'' taking a stylistic and/or lyrical path that greatly deviated from the established 1962-1964 style of the band.

The group's early hits made them major pop stars in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and several other countries with sixteen hit singles between 1962 and 1965. The Beach Boys were one of the few American bands formed prior to the [[British Invasion]] in 1964 to hold onto the success they had garnered in 1962-63. Their early hits also helped raise the profile of the state of California and associated the band with surfing, [[hot-rod]] racing, and the pursuit of happiness by carefree teens.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/hot-rod-d2780|title= Hot rod rock|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate =April 23, 2011}}</ref>

By the end of 1964, the stress of road travel, composing, producing and maintaining a high level of creativity became too much to bear for Brian Wilson. On December 23 that year, while on a flight to [[Houston]], he suffered an [[anxiety attack]] and left the tour. In January, 1965, he announced his withdrawal from touring to concentrate entirely on songwriting and record production. For the rest of 1964 and into 1965, [[Glen Campbell]] served as Wilson's temporary replacement in concert, until his own career success required him to leave the group in April 1965.<ref>{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1543|label=Glen Campbell|accessdate =April 23, 2011}}</ref> [[Bruce Johnston]] was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston himself subsequently became a full-time member of the band on May 19, 1965, first replacing Wilson on the road and later contributing his own talents in the studio beginning with the vocal sessions for "[[California Girls]]" recorded on the 4th of June, 1965.<ref>{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p18553|label=Bruce Johnston|accessdate =April 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/gigs65.html |title=GIGS65 |publisher=Esquarterly.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-22}}</ref>

During the recording sessions for ''[[The Beach Boys Today!]]'', Mike Love told [[Melody Maker]] that he and the band wanted to look beyond [[surf rock]], wanting to avoid living in the past or resting on the band's laurels.<ref>Welch, C 1964, 'Beach Boys Brought their own vegetables - so audiences beware!, Melody Maker, 14 November, p.10</ref> The resulting LP had largely guitar-oriented pop songs such as "[[Dance, Dance, Dance (song)|Dance, Dance, Dance]]" and "Good to My Baby" on side A with melancholic ballads on side B such as "[[Please Let Me Wonder]]" and "[[She Knows Me Too Well]]".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/r1416| title = Richie Unterberger review of Today!| publisher = Allmusic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.allmusic.com/song/dance-dance-dance-t14595755| title =Dance, Dance, Dance| publisher = Allmusic}}</ref><ref>"Sessionography". In ''Today!'' [CD booklet]. Los Angeles: Capitol Records</ref>

In June, 1965, the band released ''[[Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)]]''. The album included a reworked arrangement of "[[Help Me, Rhonda]]" which became the band's second number one single in the spring of 1965, displacing the Beatles' "[[Ticket to Ride]]". Songs that featured on these albums such as "[[Kiss Me, Baby]]" and "[[Let Him Run Wild]]" tapped into the same youthful angst that would later pervade his upcoming efforts.

In November 1965, the group followed up their US number three charting "California Girls" from ''[[Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)]]'' with another top-twenty single, "[[The Little Girl I Once Knew]]". It was considered the band's most experimental statement thus far, using silence as a pre-chorus, clashing keyboards, moody brass, and vocal tics. Perhaps too extreme an arrangement to go much higher than its modest number 20 peak, it was only the band's second single not to reach the top ten since their 1962 breakthrough. In December they scored an unexpected number two hit (number three in the UK) with "[[Barbara Ann]]", which Capitol released as a single without any input from the band. A cover of a 1961 song by [[the Regents]], it became one of the Beach Boys' most recognized hits over the years.

''[[Pet Sounds]]'' was where Wilson's growing mastery of studio recording and his increasingly sophisticated songs and complex arrangements would reach a creative peak. Influenced by psychedelic drugs, Brian Wilson turned his attention inward and probed his deep-seated self-doubts and emotional longings.<ref name=autogenerated2>J.

The tracks "[[Wouldn't It Be Nice]]" and "[[God Only Knows]]" showcased Wilson's growing mastery as a composer, [[orchestration|arranger]], and producer,<ref name=pc20/> as did "[[Caroline, No]]", which was issued as a Brian Wilson solo single, the only time he was credited as a solo artist during the early Capitol years. The album also included two sophisticated instrumental tracks, the quiet and wistful "[[Let's Go Away for Awhile]]" and the brittle brassy surf of the instrumental [[Pet Sounds (instrumental)|title track]]. Because of his withdrawal from touring, Wilson was able to complete almost all the backing tracks for the album while the Beach Boys were on tour in Japan. They returned to find a substantially complete album, requiring only their vocals and a small amount of their instrumental skills to finish it.

Seeking to expand on the advances made on ''Pet Sounds'', Wilson began an even more ambitious project, originally dubbed ''Dumb Angel''; in due course, the project became ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''.<ref>Richard Henderson, Song Cycle , (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2009),ISBN 0-8264-2917-3, p48</ref> Its first fruit was "[[Good Vibrations]]", which Brian described as a "pocket symphony".<ref name=autogenerated1>J.

Costing a reported $50,000, more than most albums, sessions for the song stretched over several months in at least three major studios. According to Wilson, the electro-theremin work itself cost $15,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2005/08/10/brian-wilson-interview-with-brian-wilson/|title=Interview with Brian Wilson|publisher=theaquarian.com|accessdate=November 22, 2009}}</ref>

In contrast to his work on ''Pet Sounds'', Wilson adopted a modular approach to "Good Vibrations": he broke the song into sections and taped multiple versions of each at different studios to take advantage of the different sound and ambience of each facility.<ref>Harvey Kubernik, Scott Calamar, Lou Adler, Canyon of Dreams: The Magic and the Music of Laurel Canyon, (Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2009), ISBN 1-4027-6589-4, p. 78.</ref> He then assembled his favorite sections into a master backing track and added vocals. The song's innovative instrumentation included drums, [[Hammond organ]], piano, [[tack piano]], two basses, guitars, [[electro-theremin]], harmonica, and cello. The group members recall the "Good Vibrations" vocal sessions as among the most demanding of their career.<ref name="Carlin, Peter Ames 2006"/>

While putting the finishing touches to ''Pet Sounds,'' Brian Wilson met musician and songwriter [[Van Dyke Parks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/05-06-02/ftr-hoskyns.html |title=cit. Barney Hoskyns, "All But Done." |publisher=Gadflyonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-05}}</ref> In mid-1966, Brian and Parks began an intense collaboration that resulted in a suite of challenging new songs for ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''. Using the same techniques as on "Good Vibrations", recording began in August 1966 and carried on into early 1967. Although the structure of the album and the exact running order of the songs have been subjects of speculation, it is known that Wilson and Parks intended ''Smile'' to be a continuous suite of songs that were linked both thematically and musically, with the main songs being linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated upon the musical themes of the major songs.

Many factors combined to put intense pressure on Brian Wilson as ''Smile'' neared completion: his own mental instability, the pressure to create against fierce internal opposition to his new music, the relatively unenthusiastic response to ''Pet Sounds'' in the United States, Carl Wilson's [[military draft|draft]] resistance, and a major dispute with Capitol Records. Further, Wilson's reliance on both prescription drugs and [[amphetamine]]s exacerbated his underlying mental health problems. ''Smile'' was shelved in May 1967, and would go on to become the most famous unreleased album in the history of popular music.<ref>Priore, Dominic (1997), ''Look Listen Vibrate Smile'', Last Gasp pub., collects much of the "Smile" legend in historical articles and reviews.</ref> Comparable to [[Brian Jones]] and [[Syd Barrett]], Brian Wilson's use of psychedelic drugs—especially [[LSD]]—led to a nervous breakdown in the late-1960s.<ref name="Out-Of-Sight!

==1967–1973: The Beach Boys as a democratic unit==

===Release of ''Smiley Smile'' and ''Wild Honey'' (1967)===
{{Main|Smiley Smile|Wild Honey (album)}}
Some of the ''Smile'' tracks were salvaged and re-recorded in scaled-down versions at [[Brian Wilson's home studio|Brian's new home studio]]. Along with the single version of "Good Vibrations", these tracks were released on ''[[Smiley Smile]]'', an album which elicited positive critical and commercial response abroad, but was the first real commercial failure for the group in the United States.<ref>J. DeRogatis,"Kaleidoscope eyes: psychedelic rock from the 1960s to the 1990s", (Fourth Estate, 1996), ISBN 1-85702-599-7, p. 18.</ref> By this time the Beach Boys' management (Nick Grillo and [[David Anderle]]) had created the band's own record label, [[Brother Records|Brother]]. One of the first labels to be owned by a rock group, Brother Records was intended for releases of Beach Boys side projects, and as an invitation to new talent. The initial output of the label, however, was limited to ''Smiley Smile'' and two resulting singles from the album; the failure of "[[Gettin' Hungry]]" caused the band to shelve Brother until 1970. Compounding these setbacks, the group's public image took another hit following their withdrawal from the 1967 [[Monterey Pop Festival]].

Despite the cancellation of ''Smile'', several tracks—including "[[Our Prayer]]", "Cabin Essence" and "[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]"—continued to trickle out. Many were assembled by Carl Wilson over the next few years and included on later albums. The band was still expecting to complete and release ''Smile'' as late as 1972, before it became clear that only Brian could comprehend the endless fragments that had been recorded. The original ''Smile'' project did not surface until the 2000s, when Wilson reunited with Parks to complete its writing. Wilson then released the re-recorded ''[[Smile (Brian Wilson album)|Smile]]'' in 2004 as a solo album,<ref name="Smile-Brian Wilson review"/> and this was followed by the [[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|band's version]] in 2011.

The 1967 album ''[[Wild Honey (album)|Wild Honey]]'' features songs written by Wilson and Love, including the hit "[[Darlin' (Beach Boys song)|Darlin']]" and a rendition of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "[[I Was Made to Love Her (song)|I Was Made to Love Her]]". The album fared better than its predecessor in the charts, reaching number 24 in the US.

After meeting [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] at a [[UNICEF]] Variety Gala in Paris, France on December 15, 1967, Love, along with other high-profile celebrities such as [[Donovan]] and [[the Beatles]] traveled to [[Rishikesh]] in India during February and March 1968.<ref>{{cite web |title=GIGS67 |first=Andrew G. |last=Doe |authorlink= |year=2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2012 |url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/gigs67.html}}</ref><ref name="Doe 2012">{{cite web |title=GIGS68 |first=Andrew G. |last=Doe |authorlink= |year=2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2012 |url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/gigs68.html}}</ref> The following Beach Boys album ''[[Friends (The Beach Boys album)|Friends]]'' (1968) had certain songs influenced by the [[Transcendental Meditation]] taught by the Maharishi. The album reached number 13 in the UK and 126 in the US, [[Friends (The Beach Boys song)|the title track]] placing at number 25 in the UK and number 47 in the US, the band's lowest single peak since 1962.

In support of the ''Friends'' album, Love had arranged for the Beach Boys to tour with the Maharishi in the US, which has been called "one of the more bizarre entertainments of the era".<ref>{{cite book|title=Beatles: Image and the Media|first=Michael R.|last=Frontani|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-57806-965-1|year=2007|page =198}}</ref> Starting on May 3, 1968, the tour lasted five shows and was cancelled when the Maharishi had to withdraw to fulfill film contracts. Due to disappointing audience numbers and the Maharishi's withdrawal, twenty-four tour dates were subsequently cancelled at a cost estimated at US$250,000 (approximately US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|250000|1969|r=-4}}}} today) for the band.<ref name="Doe 2012"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Gaines, Steven S.|authorlink=Steven Gaines |title=Heroes and villains: the true story of the Beach Boys |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-306-80647-6| page =196}}</ref> This tour was followed by the release of "[[Do It Again (The Beach Boys song)|Do It Again]]", a single critics described as an update of the Beach Boys' surf rock past in a late-1960's style.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.allmusic.com/song/do-it-again-t995511|title =Do It Again | publisher=Allmusic| accessdate =July 12, 2011 }}</ref> The single went to the top of the Australian and UK single charts in 1968 and was moderately successful in the US, peaking at number 20.

For a short time in mid-1968, Brian Wilson sought psychological treatment in hospital.<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter Ames|last=Carlin|title=Catch a Wave: The Rise, Fall, and Redemption of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eYyovo_AbqAC|year=2006|publisher=Rodale|isbn=978-1-59486-320-2|ref=harv}}</ref> During his absence, other members began writing and producing material themselves. To complete their contract with Capitol, they produced one more album. ''[[20/20 (The Beach Boys album)|20/20]]'' (1969) was one of the group's most stylistically diverse albums, including [[hard rock]] songs such as "[[All I Want to Do (The Beach Boys song)|All I Want to Do]]", the [[waltz]]-based "[[Time to Get Alone]]" and a remake of [[the Ronettes]]' "[[I Can Hear Music]]".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/song/bluebirds-over-the-mountain-t995513|title =Bluebirds over the Mountain | publisher=Allmusic| accessdate =July 12, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.snopes.com/risque/tattled/alliwant.asp|title =All I Want to Do| publisher=Barbra and David P.

In the US, the album reached a modest 68 on the ''Billboard'' charts.

On April 12, 1969, the band revisited their 1967 lawsuit against Capitol Records after they alleged an audit undertaken revealed the band were owed over US$2,000,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000000|1969|r=-4}}}} today) for unpaid royalties and production duties.<ref name=gaines>{{cite book|last=Gaines|first=Steven|title=Heroes and Villains: The True Story of The Beach Boys|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-qkJvajmU4EC|page=221|year=1986|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=New York|isbn=0306806479|edition=1.

In late 1969, the Beach Boys reactivated their Brother label and signed with [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]. Around this time, the band commenced recording two separate albums ''Add Some Music'' and ''Reverberation'', the latter considered for their final Capitol release before the projects were combined to strengthen the album submitted to Reprise. At the time the Beach Boys tenure ended with Capitol in 1969, they had sold 65 million records worldwide, closing the decade as the most commercially successful American group in popular music.<ref>{{cite journal | date = November 14, 1970 |title=The Best Kept Secret in the World: "The Most Dynamic Vocal Group Rock Has Produced" |journal=Billboard Magazine |volume= 82 |issue= 46 |page=4 |publisher= Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |doi= |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=sSkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PP4 |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref>

===''Sunflower'', ''Surf's Up'' and change in sound, label and management (1970–71)===
{{Main|Sunflower (The Beach Boys album)|Surf's Up (album)}}
In 1970, armed with the new Reprise contract, the band appeared rejuvenated, releasing the album ''[[Sunflower (The Beach Boys album)|Sunflower]]'' to critical acclaim. The album features a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all band members. Brian Wilson was quite active during this period, writing or co-writing seven of the twelve songs on ''Sunflower'' and performing at half of the band's domestic concerts in 1970. ''Sunflower'' reached number 29 in the UK and number 151 in the US, the band's lowest domestic chart showing to that point.

"[[Tears in the Morning]]", written and sung by [[Bruce Johnston]] reached number four in the Netherlands. A version of "[[Cottonfields]]" arranged by [[Al Jardine]] appeared on European releases of ''Sunflower'' and as a single, reached number one in [[Australia]], [[Norway]], [[South Africa]] and [[Sweden]] and the top-five in six other countries including the UK.

After ''Sunflower'', the band hired [[Jack Rieley]] as their manager. Under Rieley's management, the group's music began emphasizing political and social awareness. During this time, Carl Wilson gradually assumed leadership of the band and Rieley contributed lyrics.

On August 30, 1971 the band released ''[[Surf's Up (album)|Surf's Up]]'', named after the Brian Wilson/Van Dyke Parks composition "[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]" . The song was the same arrangement as Brian's 1966 version, with Carl adding vocals and overdubs. Carl's "[[Long Promised Road]]" and "[[Feel Flows]]" with lyrics by Rieley are also standouts on the record. The track "A Day in the Life of a Tree" was sung by Rieley himself. Johnston produced the classic "[[Disney Girls (1957)]]", a throwback to the easier, simpler time Johnston remembered.

Johnston ended his first stint with the band shortly after the record's release, reportedly because of friction with Rieley. The album was moderately successful, reaching the US top 30, a marked improvement over their recent releases. While the record charted, the Beach Boys added to their renewed fame by performing a near-sellout set at [[Carnegie Hall]], followed by an appearance with the [[Grateful Dead]] at [[Fillmore East]] on April 27, 1971.

===Line-up shuffle, ''Carl and the Passions'', ''Holland'' and acclaimed live performances (1972–73)===
{{Main|Carl and the Passions – "So Tough"|Holland (album)|The Beach Boys in Concert}}
[[File:Touring Beach Boys 1972.jpg|thumb|left|200px|upright|[[Carl Wilson]], [[Al Jardine]], [[Ricky Fataar]], [[Dennis Wilson]], [[Blondie Chaplin]] and [[Mike Love]] in 1972.]]

|filetype=[[Ogg]]}}

The addition of [[Ricky Fataar]] and [[Blondie Chaplin]] in February 1972 led to a dramatic restructuring in sound for the band. The album ''[[Carl and the Passions – "So Tough"]]'' was an uncharacteristic mix that included several songs written by Fataar and Chaplin. The live shows during this era included reworked arrangements of many of the band's previous songs. In April 1972, [[Bruce Johnston]], due to reported conflict with band manager [[Jack Rieley]], left the group (Johnston would later rejoin the band; however, he still performed as a guest musician on subsequent Beach Boy releases).

For their next project the band, their families, assorted associates and technicians moved to the Netherlands for the summer of 1972. Once there, they rented a farmhouse to convert into a makeshift studio where recording sessions for the new project would take place. By the end of their sessions, the band felt they had produced one of their strongest efforts yet. Reprise, however, felt that the album required a strong single before release. This resulted in the song "[[Sail On, Sailor]]", a collaboration between Brian Wilson, [[Tandyn Almer]], [[Ray Kennedy]], Jack Rieley and Van Dyke Parks featuring a soulful lead vocal by Chaplin.

Reprise subsequently approved and the resulting album, ''[[Holland (album)|Holland]]'', was released early in 1973, peaking at number 37 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. Brian's musical children story, "Mount Vernon and Fairway (A Fairy Tale)", narrated by Rieley, which was directly influenced by [[Randy Newman]]'s ''[[Sail Away (Randy Newman album)|Sail Away]]'' album, was included as a "bonus" [[extended play]] (EP).

Despite indifference from Reprise, the band's concert audience started to grow. ''[[The Beach Boys in Concert]]'', a double album documenting the 1972 and 1973 US tours, was another top-30 charting album and became the band's first [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] under Reprise. It was during this period that the band established themselves as one of America's most popular live acts. Chaplin and Fataar helped organize the concerts to obtain a high quality live performance, playing their current material off ''Surf's Up'', ''Carl and the Passions'' and ''Holland'' and supplementing songs from their older catalog. It was this concert arrangement which would soon send them back into American public recognition.

===''Endless Summer'' and its implication on band dynamics (1974–75)===
{{Main|Endless Summer (The Beach Boys album)}}
In late-1973, the soundtrack to [[American Grafitti]], ''[[41 Original Hits from the Soundtrack of American Graffiti]]'', was released to mass commercial and critical success. The soundtrack included early Beach Boy songs "[[Surfin' Safari]]" and "[[All Summer Long (The Beach Boys song)|All Summer Long]]" and was a catalyst in creating a wave of nostalgia that reintroduced the Beach Boys into contemporary American consciousness.<ref>http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-10-greatest-summer-songs-20130522/6-the-beach-boys-all-summer-long-0368776</ref> In 1974, Capitol Records issued ''[[Endless Summer (The Beach Boys album)|Endless Summer]]'', the band's first major pre-''Pet Sounds'' greatest hits package. The record sleeve's sunny, colorful graphics caught the mood of the nation and surged to the top of the ''Billboard'' album charts. It was the group's first multi-million selling record since "Good Vibrations", and remained on the album chart for three years.<ref name="mp3.com">[http://www.mp3.com/albums/1194/summary.html Endless Summer, The Beach Boys]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}, ''mp3.com'', retrieved on January 15, 2007</ref> The following year, Capitol released another a second compilation, ''[[Spirit of America (The Beach Boys album)|Spirit of America]]'', which also sold well. With these compilations, the Beach Boys became one of the most popular acts in rock, propelling themselves from being the opening act for [[Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]] to headliners selling out basketball arenas in a matter of weeks. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine named the Beach Boys the "Band of the Year" for 1974, solely on the basis of their juggernaut touring schedule and material written over a decade earlier.

Manager Jack Rieley, who remained in the Netherlands after ''Holland''{{'}}s release, was relieved of his managerial duties in late 1973. Blondie Chaplin also left the band in late 1973 after an argument with Steve Love, the band's business manager (and Mike's brother). Ricky Fataar remained until 1974, when he was offered a chance to join a new group led by future [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] member [[Joe Walsh]]. Chaplin's replacement, [[James William Guercio]], started offering the group career advice that resulted in his becoming their new manager. Under Guercio, the Beach Boys staged a highly successful 1975 joint concert tour with [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], with each group performing some of the other's songs, including their previous year's collaboration on Chicago's hit "[[Wishing You Were Here]]". Beach Boys vocals were also heard on [[Elton John]]'s 1974 hit "[[Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me]]".

Nostalgia had settled into the Beach Boys' hype; the group had not officially released any albums of new material since 1973's ''Holland''. While their concerts continuously sold out, the stage act slowly changed from a contemporary presentation followed by oldies encores to an entire show made up of mostly pre-1967 music.

[[File:The Beach Boys (Logo).png|thumb|right|''15 Big Ones'' included a stylized version of the Beach Boys' name by Dean Torrence which would later be used on compilations, ''[[That's Why God Made the Radio]]'' and promotion for their 50th anniversary reunion tour.]]
''[[15 Big Ones]]'' (1976) marked the return of Brian Wilson as a major force in the group. The album included several new songs by Brian, as well as cover versions of oldies such as "[[Rock and Roll Music]]" (#5), "[[Blueberry Hill (song)|Blueberry Hill]]", and "[[In the Still of the Night (1956 song)|In the Still of the Night]]". Brian and Love's "[[It's O.K. (The Beach Boys song)|It's O.K.]]" was in the vein of their early sixties style, and was a moderate hit. The album was publicized by an August 1976 [[NBC]]-TV special, simply titled "The Beach Boys". The special, produced by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (SNL) creator [[Lorne Michaels]], featured appearances by ''SNL'' cast members [[John Belushi]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]].

[[File:Brian Wilson 1976.png|thumb|left|Brian Wilson behind [[Brother Studios]]' mixing console in the mid-1970s.]]
For the remainder of 1976 to early 1977, Brian Wilson spent his time making sporadic public appearances and producing the band's next album ''[[Love You (album)|Love You]]'' (1977), a quirky collection of 14 songs mostly written, arranged and produced by Brian. Brian revealed to biographer Peter Ames Carlin that ''Love You'' is one of his favorite Beach Boys releases, telling him "That's when it all happened for me. That's where my heart lies."<ref name="Biography">{{cite book | author=Carlin, Peter Ames | title=''Catch a Wave: The Rise, Fall, & Redemption of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson''| publisher=[[Rodale Books]] (New York)| year=2006|page=290 | isbn= 978-1-59486-320-2}}</ref> ''Love You'' peaked at number 28 in the UK and number 53 in the US and has since developed a [[cult following]]; regarded as one of the band's best albums by fans and critics alike.<ref name="Rock Hall">[http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-beach-boys/bio/ "The Beach Boys Biography"].

{{Quote box| width=25%|align=right|quote="A diseased bunch of motherfuckers if ever there was one…But the miracle is that the Beach Boys have made that disease sound like the literal babyflesh pink of health…Maybe it's just that unprickable and ingenuous wholesomeness that accounts not only for their charm, but for their beauty—a beauty so awesome that listening to them at their best is like being in some vast dream cathedral decorated with a thousand gleaming American pop culture icons."

After ''Love You'' was released, Brian began to record and assemble ''[[Adult/Child]]'' an effort largely consisting of songs written by Wilson from 1976 and 1977, with some sourced from recording sessions for ''Sunflower''. The effort is noted for featuring a "big band" sound on a number of the tracks. These tracks were written by Wilson and arranged by Dick Reynolds.

Though publicized as the Beach Boys' next release, ''Adult/Child'' reportedly caused tension within the group and was ultimately shelved. Rumors surfaced alleging that the album's demise directly resulted in Brian's relapsed withdrawal from band activity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Following this period, his concert appearances with the band gradually diminished and his performances when attended were deemed erratic.

Despite the much-hyped "Brian's Back" campaign in the mid to late 1970s, most critics at this point would comment on how Brian Wilson could become the latest celebrity drug casualty.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The internal wrangling came to a head after a show at Central Park, New York City on September 1, 1977, when the band effectively split up into two camps; Dennis and Carl Wilson on one side, Mike Love and Al Jardine on the other with Brian remaining a neutral party. Following a confrontation on an airport's tarmac, the band broke up for a period of two and a half weeks. This was followed by a band meeting taken place on September 17, 1977 at Brian's house. In light of a new Caribou Records (CBS) contract in the balance all parties negotiated a settlement resulting in Mike Love gaining corporate control of Brian's vote in the group, meaning he along with Al could vote against Carl and Dennis Wilson on any matter.<ref>{{cite web |title=BBTIMELINE |first=Andrew G. |last=Doe |authorlink=|year=2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2012 |url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/1977.html}}</ref>

==1978–present: The Beach Boys under fluctuating control and influence==

===Infighting and the retreat of the Wilsons (1978–1983)===
{{Main|M.I.U. Album|L.A. (Light Album)|Keepin' the Summer Alive}}
[[Image:Reagans with the Beach Boys.jpg|thumb||The Beach Boys with President [[Ronald Reagan]] and First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]], 1983]]
After the Brian Wilson produced album ''Adult/Child'' was deemed too uncommercial to be released, Brian relented creative control to Mike Love and Al Jardine who dictated the future direction of the band. The Beach Boys' last album for Reprise, ''[[M.I.U. Album]]'' (1978), was recorded at [[Maharishi International University]] in Iowa at the insistence of Love. Dennis and Carl made limited contributions to the project; the album was mostly produced by Jardine and Ron Altbach, with Brian appearing as "Executive Producer". ''M.I.U.'' was largely a contractual obligation to finish out their association with Reprise, who likewise did not promote the album. The record also acted as a catalyst in dividing the group between two camps. Mike Love and Al Jardine desired to focus on rock and roll orientated material while Carl and Dennis wished to resume the progressive focus they had established with the albums ''Carl and the Passions'' and ''Holland''. This division resulted in Dennis withdrawing from the group to focus on his second solo album and follow-up to ''[[Dennis Wilson|Pacific Ocean Blue]]'' entitled ''[[Dennis Wilson#Bambu|Bambu]]''. However alcoholism and marital problems overcame all three Wilson brothers resulting in Dennis' ''Bambu'' being shelved,  Carl appearing intoxicated during concerts (notably at appearances on their disastrous 1978 Australia tour) and Brian gradually sliding back into addiction and an unhealthy lifestyle.

After departing Reprise, the Beach Boys signed with [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]]. They in turn received a substantial advance and were paid $1 million per album even as CBS deemed their preliminary review of the band's first product, ''[[L.A. (Light Album)]]'' as unsatisfactory. Faced with the realization Brian was in no condition to write or produce the required material, the band recruited former band member Bruce Johnston as producer. The result paid off, as "[[Good Timin' (The Beach Boys song)|Good Timin']]" became a US top 40 single. The album also featured outstanding performances by both Dennis (cuts intended for his second solo effort ''Bambu'') and Carl ("Full Sail"). The group also enjoyed moderate success with a disco reworking of the ''Wild Honey'' song "Here Comes the Night" which was followed by their highest charting UK single in nine years: Al Jardine's penned "[[Lady Lynda]]" peaked at #6 in the UK Singles Chart.

1980 saw the release of ''[[Keepin' the Summer Alive]]'', with Johnston once again producing. Carl Wilson would be the only Wilson brother who made any sort of imprint on the finished product. Brian managed to contribute several ideas, as seen in the ''Going Platinum'' television special documenting the album's release, but was otherwise ''[[persona non grata]]''. Dennis Wilson's ongoing personal problems resulted in him not being featured in either the special or album, though his drumming is heard on the cover version of Chuck Berry's "[[School Days (song)|School Days]]".

From 1980 through 1982, the Beach Boys and [[The Grass Roots]] performed Independence Day concerts at the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., attracting large crowds.<ref>"July 4: Day of Music, Parades, Fireworks", ''The Washington Post'', Washington, D.C., July 3, 1982, p. D1.</ref><ref name="McCombs">Phil McCombs, "Watt Outlaws Rock Music on Mall for July 4", ''The Washington Post'', Washington, D.C., April 6, 1983, p.

Watt]], President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups. Watt said that "rock bands" that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted "the wrong element", who would mug people and families attending any similar events in the future.<ref name="McCombs" /> During the ensuing uproar, which included over 40,000 complaints to the Department of the Interior, the Beach Boys stated that the [[Soviet Union]], which had invited them to perform in [[Leningrad]] in 1978, "obviously .... did not feel that the group attracted the wrong element".<ref name="McCombs" /><ref name=mojo2004>{{cite journal|last=Holdship|first=Bill|journal=MOJO magazine|year=2004|month=December}}</ref> Vice President [[George H.

Dennis Wilson's personal problems, however, had continued to escalate. On December 28, 1983, he drowned in the Marina del Rey while diving from a friend's boat trying to recover items he had previously thrown overboard in fits of rage. Despite his death, the Beach Boys continued as a successful touring act.

===Soundtrack appearances, "Kokomo" and reliance on nostalgia (1984–1998)===
{{Main|The Beach Boys (album)|Still Cruisin'|Kokomo (song)|Summer in Paradise|Stars and Stripes Vol. 1}}
On July 4, 1985, the Beach Boys played to an afternoon crowd of one million in Philadelphia and the same evening they performed for over 750,000 people on the Mall in Washington (the day's historic achievement was recorded in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]]). They also appeared nine days later at the [[Live Aid]] concert. That year, they released the eponymous album ''[[The Beach Boys (album)|The Beach Boys]]'' and enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as [[David Lee Roth]]'s hit version of "California Girls". In 1987, they played with the [[Hip hop music|rap]] group [[The Fat Boys]], performing the song "[[Wipe Out (song)|Wipe Out]]" and filming a video for it.

By 1988, Brian Wilson had officially left the Beach Boys and released his [[Brian Wilson (album)|first solo album]], which received critical acclaim. It was during this period that the band unexpectedly claimed their first US number one hit single in 22 years with "[[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]]", which had appeared in the movie ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]''. Written by [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]], [[Scott McKenzie]], Mike Love, and [[Terry Melcher]], the song managed to become the band's largest selling single of all time. The video for the song received heavy airplay on the music video channel [[VH1]], and prominently featured actor [[John Stamos]] on the congas. Having been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] earlier in the year, the group became the second artist after [[Aretha Franklin]] to hit number one in the US after their induction. Riding high on the runaway success of "Kokomo", the Beach Boys released the album ''[[Still Cruisin']]'', which went gold in the US and gave them their best chart showing since 1976.

In 1989, Wilson filed a lawsuit to reclaim the rights to his songs and the group's publishing company, [[Sea of Tunes]], which he had supposedly signed away to his father Murry in 1969. He successfully argued that he had not been mentally fit to make an informed decision and that his father had potentially forged his signature. While Wilson failed to regain his copyrights, he was awarded $25&nbsp;million for unpaid royalties.<ref>[http://www.beachboys.com/history.html "The Beach Boys – The complete Guide"], ''beachb oys.com''</ref> Soon after Wilson won his "[[Sea of Tunes]]" case, Love discovered Murry Wilson did not properly credit him as co-writer on dozens of Beach Boys songs. With Love and Brian Wilson unable to determine exactly what Love was properly owed, Love sued Wilson in 1992 to gain credit for his co-authorship of a number of important Beach Boys songs, winning $13&nbsp;million in 1994 for lost royalties.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-13/business/fi-8511_1_beach-boys-lead-singer "Company Town : Beach Boys' Mike Love Wins His Case..."] ''Los Angeles Times'' December 13, 1994</ref> In interviews, Love revealed that on some songs he wrote most of the lyrics, on others only a line or two. Even though Love sued Wilson, both parties said in interviews that there was no malice between them; they simply couldn't come up with an agreeable settlement by themselves.

In 1990, the band gathered several studio musicians and recorded the Melcher-produced title track of the comedy ''[[Problem Child (1990 film)|Problem Child]]''. Stamos again appeared in video, and later appeared singing lead vocals on "Forever" (written by Dennis Wilson for the ''Sunflower'' album) on their 1992 album ''[[Summer in Paradise]]''. Having no new contributions from Brian Wilson whatsoever due to interference from caretaker [[Eugene Landy]], ''Summer in Paradise'' was poorly regarded by both critics and fans, was a commercial disaster and would become their last album of original material for two decades. Members of the band appeared on several television shows such as ''[[Full House]]'', ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', and ''[[Baywatch]]'' in the late 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, the band appeared in [[Michael Feeney Callan]]'s film ''The Beach Boys Today'', which included in-depth interviews with all members except Brian Wilson. Carl Wilson confided to Callan that Brian would record again with the band at some point in the near future, though sessions from this era involving Brian and The Beach Boys were never released. In February 1996, the Beach Boys guested with [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] on a re-recording of "[[Fun, Fun, Fun]]", which was a British Top-30 hit.

In June, the group worked with comedian [[Jeff Foxworthy]] on the recording "Howdy From Maui", and ultimately released ''[[Stars and Stripes Vol. 1]]'' in August 1996. The album consisted of country renditions of several Beach Boys hits, performed by popular country artists such as [[Toby Keith]] and [[Willie Nelson]]. Brian Wilson, who was in a better mental state at the time, rejoined the group and acted as co-producer.

In early 1997, Carl Wilson was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] after years of heavy smoking. Despite his terminal condition, Carl soldiered on throughout the band's 1997 summer tour while undergoing  chemotherapy. During performances, he sat on a stool and reportedly needed oxygen after every song. Carl managed to stand, however, when featuring his signature vocal on "[[God Only Knows]]". By 1998 the cancer had spread to his brain. Carl Wilson died on February 6, 1998, just two months after the death of the Wilsons' mother, Audree.

===Splintering of the Beach Boys’ name and the relationships of the members (1999–2010)===
[[File:The Beach Boys concierto.jpg|thumb|left|The touring line-up of Mike Love and Bruce Johnston's "The Beach Boys Band", plus guest member David Marks, in 2008]]
Following Carl Wilson's death, the remaining members splintered. Mike Love, Bruce Johnston and David Marks continued to tour without Jardine, initially as "America's Band", but following several cancelled bookings under that name, they sought authorization through Brother Records Inc. (BRI) to tour as "The Beach Boys" and were successful in securing the license.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In turn Jardine began to tour regularly with his band dubbed "Beach Boys: Family & Friends" until he ran into legal issues for using the Beach Boys name without holding a BRI-approved license.  BRI, through its longtime attorney, Ed McPherson, sued Jardine in Federal Court for trademark infringement.  Jardine, in turn, counter claimed against BRI for wrongful termination.  BRI ultimately prevailed in the litigation, which lasted for several years.  Love was allowed to continue to tour as The Beach Boys, and Jardine was prohibited from touring using any form of The Beach Boys name. Relieved from Landy's hold, Brian Wilson sought different treatments for his illnesses which aided him in continuing his solo career that saw him tour regularly with his backing band consisting of members of [[Wondermints]] and other LA/Chicago musicians. David Marks also maintained a quiet but steady solo career. Each of their tours remained reliable draws, with Wilson and Jardine both remaining legal members of the Beach Boys organization.

In September 2004, Brian Wilson issued a free CD through the ''[[Daily Mail|Mail On Sunday]]'' that included Beach Boys songs he'd rerecorded, five of which he'd co-authored with Mike Love. The 10 track compilation had 2.6 million copies distributed and prompted Love to file a lawsuit claiming the promotion hurt the sales of the original recordings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/04/entertainment/et-quick4.4 |title=Mike Love sues Brian Wilson |last1=Lewis |first1=Randy |date=November 4, 2005 |website=http://www.latimes.com/ |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}</ref> Love's suit was dismissed in 2007 when a judge determined that there were no triable issues of material fact.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/16/entertainment/et-quick16.1 |title=Beach Boys lawsuit dismissed |last1=Lewis |first1=Randy |date=May 16, 2007 |website=http://www.latimes.com/ |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}</ref>

On June 13, 2006, the five surviving Beach Boys (Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston and David Marks) appeared together for the celebration of the 40th anniversary of ''Pet Sounds'' and the double-platinum certification of their greatest hits compilation, ''[[Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys]]'', in a ceremony atop the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. Plaques were awarded for their efforts, with Brian Wilson accepting on behalf of Dennis and Carl.

===''The Smile Sessions'', 50th anniversary reunion tour and ''That's Why God Made the Radio'' (2011–2012)===
{{Main|The Smile Sessions|The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour|That's Why God Made the Radio}}
[[File:Beachboys smile cover.jpg|thumb|right|The cover for ''The Smile Sessions'' uses the artwork Frank Holmes prepared in December 1966 for ''Smile''.]]

Toward the end of 2011, the Beach Boys with the participation of Brian Wilson finally released the unfinished Smile album in the form of ''The Smile Sessions''. The album - even in its incomplete form - garnered universal critical acclaim and experienced almost immediate popular success, charting in both the Billboard US & UK Top 30. The artwork and packaging featured the original Frank Holmes illustrations and included the photo/illustration booklet insert that was intended for the 1967 original release.  The format of the recordings utilized Wilson's 2004 ''Brian Wilson Presents Smile'' solo effort as a template.
The band was rewarded with glowing reviews including inclusion to Rolling Stone's Top 500 album list at number 381. ''The Smile Sessions'' deluxe album package went on to win Best Historical Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards.  Brian Wilson personally accepted the award stating "I guess Van Dyke and I were on to something after all."

In a 500 set limited edition, the ''The Smile Sessions'' came in a box set with a lit-up shop front window. Each of these box sets came with Brian Wilson's signature on the box.

In February 2011, the Beach Boys released "Don't Fight the Sea", a charity single to aid the victims of the 2011 Japan earthquake. The single, released on Jardine's 2011 album ''A Postcard From California'' featured Jardine, Wilson, Love, Johnston, and prerecorded vocals by Carl Wilson. Rumors then circulated regarding a potential 50th anniversary band reunion. Despite some uncertainty<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/news/beach-boys-plan-anniversary-blowout-likely-reunion-tour-152547833.html|title=Beach Boys plan anniversary blowout, likely reunion tour|accessdate=September 25, 2011}}</ref> and limited public comment,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/sep/29/brian-wilson-beach-boys|title=Brian Wilson rules out reunion with the Beach Boys|accessdate=September 29, 2011 | location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Sean|last=Michaels|date=September 29, 2011}}</ref> on December 16, 2011, it was announced that Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston and David Marks would reunite for a new album and [[Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour|50th anniversary tour in 2012]] that would include a performance at the [[New Orleans Jazz Festival]] in April 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/B/Beach_Boys/2011/12/16/19133156.html|title=Beach Boys gear up for reunion |accessdate=December 16, 2011 | work=Sun Media|first=Darryl|last=Sterdan|date=December 16, 2011}}</ref>

On February 12, 2012, the Beach Boys performed at the 2012 Grammy Awards, in what was billed as a "special performance" by organizers. It marked the group's first live performance to include Brian since 1996.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/08/us-grammys-beachboys-idUSTRE8171QK20120208 | work=Reuters | first=Jill | last=Serjeant | title=Reunited Beach Boys to perform at Grammy Awards | date=February 8, 2012}}</ref> This anniversary band lineup performed "[[Good Vibrations]]" with Adam Levine and Mark Foster, after [[Maroon 5]] opened the set with "[[Surfer Girl]]" and [[Foster the People]] played "[[Wouldn't It Be Nice]]" during the ceremony. On February 16, 2012, dates for their tour were announced, which includes shows in the US, Canada, Asia, and Europe. Johnston responded to claims by some in the media that the group lip-synched their performance at the Grammy Awards, which the group strongly denies. Johnston also said "I never hoped for [a reunion], because I never thought any of us wanted to do it. We have probably, you know, the presidential honeymoon of six months but then we have to show something to keep it going. We have to make sure we have a great flowing song list but also make sure we don't sound like a greatest-hits band. We have a lot to balance."<ref>

''That's Why God Made the Radio'' made its debut at number three on the US charts giving the group highest charting album in 37 years—since 1974's compilation ''Endless Summer'' and highest charting studio album since 1965's ''Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)''. It also became the band's first top ten studio album since 1976's ''15 Big Ones''. The album made its debut in the UK charts at number 15 giving the group their highest studio album debut since 1971's ''Surf's Up''. The album also made US chart history by breaking a record by expanding the group's span of [[Billboard 200]] top ten albums to 49 years and one week passing [[the Beatles]] with 47 years of top ten albums. [[Frank Sinatra]] holds the record with 52 years while [[the Rolling Stones]] are fourth with 45 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/beach-boys-beatles-billboard-337926 |title=Beach Boys Surpass the Beatles for Billboard 200 Record |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref>

Later in 2012, the group released the ''[[Fifty Big Ones]]'' and ''Greatest Hits'' compilations along with reissues of 12 of their albums. The next year, the group released ''[[Live – The 50th Anniversary Tour]]'' a 41 song, 2-CD set documenting their ''50th Anniversary Tour''.

===Breakup controversy and return to solo careers (2012–present)===
While there were no definite plans to do so, Brian Wilson stated that he would like to make another Beach Boys album following the world tour. "This time I would like to do some rock n' roll," Wilson says. "I would like it to be a bit harder and faster."<ref>{{cite web|author=Ed Condran |url=http://www2.tbo.com/entertainment/entertainment/2012/may/03/7/fxnewso8-golden-boys-ar-399218/?referer=None&shorturl=http%3A%2F%2Ftbo.ly%2FIMf8Fy |title=Beach Boys celebrate 50 years with tour stop in Tampa |publisher=TBO.com |date=2012-05-03 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> In late June 2012, Mike Love confirmed the Beach Boys would be playing some dates in [[South America]] in October 2012 although the lineup would feature only himself and Bruce Johnston and include a different backing band than the current one. Love said that these shows will not be part of the concert series of the reunion tour. Wilson quickly responded that he had no idea Love planned these tour dates. He also stated that he would love to do more touring with the band once the dates are finished, along with recording more music.<ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp;Patrick Doyle |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/mike-love-books-beach-boys-shows-without-brian-wilson-20120626 |title=Mike Love Books Beach Boys Shows Without Brian Wilson &#124; Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=viernes 22 de junio del 2012 13:14 espectaculos |url=http://elcomercio.pe/espectaculos/1431754/noticia-beach-boys-confirmaron-gira-america-sur |title=Los Beach Boys confirmaron gira por América del Sur &#124; El Comercio Perú |publisher=Elcomercio.pe |date= |accessdate=2012-07-10}}</ref> A month later in July 2012, Love further spoke about the group's future by saying "There's talk of us going and doing a return to the Grammys next year, and there's talk about doing another album together. There's nothing in stone, but there's a lot of ideas being floated around. So after this year, after completing the 50th anniversary reunion, we'll entertain doing some more studio work and see what we can come up with and can do in the future." Love said that Wilson and producer Joe Thomas had over 80 hours of music recorded much of it culled from material they were working on around the time of Wilson's 1998 ''[[Your Imagination]]'' album that "were always songs he had earmarked for the Beach Boys."{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} He further added that the label is stoked about what is happening and are pushing for more music and more tour dates.

On October 5, 2012, Love announced in a self-written press release to the LA Times that the band would return to its pre-50th Reunion Tour lineup with him and Johnston touring as The Beach Boys without Wilson, Jardine and Marks:
{{cquote|Let me get right to it: I did not fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys. I cannot fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys. I am not his employer. I do not have such authority. And even if I did, I would never fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys.…This tour was always envisioned as a limited run. None of us wanted to do a 50th anniversary tour that lasted 10 years. It was meant to be special.…Brian, Al and I signed an agreement outlining the beginning and end of the tour.…As the year went on, Brian and Al wanted to keep the 50th anniversary tour going beyond the 75 dates. Like any good party, no one wanted it to end. However, that was impossible, given that we had already set up shows in smaller cities with a different configuration of the band -- the configuration that had been touring together every year for the last 13 years. Brian and Al would not be joining for these small market dates, as was long agreed upon. It is not feasible, both logistically and economically, for the 50th anniversary tour to play these markets.…This approach is not new for our band.…The name "The Beach Boys" is controlled by Brother Records Inc., which was founded by the original members of the Beach Boys and whose sole shareholders voted over a decade ago to grant me an exclusive license to tour as "The Beach Boys." With it, I’ve felt a great responsibility to uphold, honor and further our legacy.<ref name="latimes.com">{{cite web|last=Love |first=Mike |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-mike-love-beach-boys-on-brian-wilson-20121004,0,6311413.story |title=Mike Love sets the record straight on Brian Wilson's 'firing' |publisher=latimes.com |date=2012-10-05 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref>}}

Then there was confusion in some markets when photos of me, Al and David and the 50th reunion band appeared on websites advertising his shows. At that point my attorney merely suggested to Mike's attorney that a possible press release in those markets might be appropriate to stop the confusion, which was in no one's best interest.…I was completely blindsided by his press release.

Despite all of Wilson's and Jardine's claims it appears that no further events featuring the 50th lineup will occur. On December 13, 2012, Wilson and Jardine played a Christmas show at which they performed the Beach Boys Christmas songs, "[[Little Saint Nick]]" and "Christmas Day".<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgzoox4asI0 |title=Backstage with Al Jardine |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-12-14 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://smileysmile.net/board/index.php?PHPSESSID=e936cb80c6c4dcc044ac0e893f106c7b&topic=14666.75 |title=Brian & Al KLOS Show 12/13/12 |publisher=Smileysmile.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref> Following this appearance, on January 23, 2013, Wilson announced a concert date featuring himself, Jardine and Marks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fraze.com/brian-wilson/ |title=BRIAN WILSON &#124; Fraze Pavilion |publisher=Fraze.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref> It has been speculated that the date announced will be followed by more dates as Wilson has said he will be spending the summer with Jardine and Marks.<ref>[https://twitter.com/BrianWilsonLive/status/294852814713257984/photo/1 ]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> Love and Johnston have continued to book dates in 2013 under the Beach Boys name, to which Love holds an exclusive license,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beachboysband.net/TOURSCH/BB_TOUR_SCH.htm |title=The Beach Boys Tour Dates |publisher=Beachboysband.net |date=2013-02-15 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref> while Wilson, Jardine, and Marks continue to tour together as a trio.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brian Wilson, Al Jardine & David Marks of the Beach Boys to Play Shows as a Trio|url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2013/03/08/brian-wilson-al-jardine-david-marks-beach-boys-mike-love/|accessdate=8 March 2013|newspaper=Rock Cellar Magazine|date=8 March 2013}}</ref> The tour which is with guitarist [[Jeff Beck]] is also expected to include former Beach Boy [[Blondie Chaplin]] at select dates.

Reflecting upon the band's recent reunion in 2013, Mike Love stated: "I had a wonderful experience being in the studio together. Brian has lost none of his ability to structure those melodies and chord progressions, and when we heard us singing together coming back over the speakers it sounded like 1965 again. Touring was more for the fans.…It was a great experience, it had a term to it, and now everyone's going on with their ways of doing things."<ref name="TheGuardian">{{cite web |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/jul/04/beach-boys-mike-love-interview |title=The Beach Boys' Mike Love: 'There are a lot of fallacies about me' |first=Dave |last=Simpson |work=theguardian.co.uk |accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref> In a July 8, 2013 interview, Mike Love continued by discussing the potential of another reunion, saying "I don’t know how that sacking controversy started.…The anniversary tour was originally 50 dates, and got extended to 73. At that point, Brian said: ‘No more dates for us, please.’ So once we finished those 73 shows we went back to the line-up of the band before he rejoined.…I’d very much like to get in a room, just him and I, to write more songs.…We didn’t write together on last year’s album, and I’d like to do that more than anything."<ref name="Dailystar">{{cite web |url= http://www.dailystar.co.uk/playlist/view/325039/Surf-s-up-again-for-the-Beach-Boys/|title=SURF'S UP AGAIN FOR THE BEACH BOYS|first=Carr |last=Kim |work=dailystar.co.uk|accessdate=8 July 2012}}</ref>

On August 27, 2013 the group released ''[[Made in California]]'', a six disc collection will feature more than seven and a half hours of music, including more than 60 previously unreleased tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianwilson.com/music/ |title=The Beach Boys — Brian Wilson |publisher=Brianwilson.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-15}}</ref> ''Made in California'' also concluded the Beach Boys' 50th anniversary campaign.

McCartney has frequently said that it was the inspiration behind the seminal Beatles' album, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.
