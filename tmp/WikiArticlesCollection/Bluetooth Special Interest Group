The '''Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG)''' is the [[standards organisation|body]] that oversees the development of [[Bluetooth]] [[standardization|standards]] and the licensing of the Bluetooth technologies and [[trademark]]s to manufacturers. The SIG is a not-for-profit, non-stock corporation founded in September 1998.  The SIG is headquartered in [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].  The SIG has local offices in Beijing, China; Taiwan; Seoul, Korea; Tokyo, Japan and Malmö, Sweden.

The SIG does not make, manufacture or sell Bluetooth enabled products.

==Introduction==
''Bluetooth'' technology provides a way to exchange information between [[wireless]] devices such as [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), [[mobile phone]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[computer]]s, [[Computer printer|printers]] and [[digital camera]]s via a secure, low-cost, globally available short-range [[radio]] [[frequency]] band. Originally developed by [[Ericsson]], ''Bluetooth'' technology is now used in many different products by many different [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]]. These manufacturers must be either Associate or Promoter members of(see below) the Bluetooth SIG before they are granted early access to the ''Bluetooth'' specifications, but published ''Bluetooth'' specifications are available online via the Bluetooth SIG Website [http://www.bluetooth.com/ENGLISH/TECHNOLOGY/Pages/default.aspx]. 

The SIG owns the ''Bluetooth'' word mark, figure mark and combination mark.  These trademarks are licensed out for use to companies that are incorporating ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology into their products.  To become a licensee, a company must become a member of the Bluetooth SIG.  The SIG also manages the Bluetooth SIG Qualification program, a certification process required for any product using ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology and a pre-condition of the intellectual property license for ''Bluetooth'' technology. The main tasks for the SIG are to publish the ''Bluetooth'' specifications, protect the ''Bluetooth'' trademarks and evangelize ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology.

At its inception in 1998, the Bluetooth SIG was primarily run by a staff effectively seconded from its member companies. In 2001 Tom Siep served as the group's Managing Director and from 2002-2004 Mike McCamon led the group as its Executive Director. In 2004 he was replaced by [[Michael W. Foley]] (Mike). In mid-2012, Mark Powell took the reigns as the SIG's current Executive Director. Beginning in 2002 a professional staff was hired, composed of operations, [[engineering]] and [[marketing]] specialists. From 2002-2004 the Bluetooth SIG was based in [[Overland Park, Kansas]] USA and is now based in [[Kirkland, Washington]]. In addition to its professional staff, the SIG is supported by its more than 20,000 member companies [http://www.bluetooth.org] who participate in the various working groups that produce the standardization documents and oversee the qualification process for new products and help to evangelize the technology.

==Structure==
The [[Special Interest Group|SIG]] members participate in Study Groups, Expert Groups, Working Groups along with committees [https://www.bluetooth.org/bluetooth/landing/sig_groups.php].

===Study groups===
The Study Groups carry out research into their various areas which informs the development of the Bluetooth specifications. They may eventually become Working Groups in their own right.

===Expert groups===
The Expert Groups deal with issues of technical importance to all aspects of ''Bluetooth'' development. As with the Study Groups their work informs the Working Groups as well as the corporate groups. 
Participation in the Expert Groups is restricted to [[#Promoter members|Promoter members]] and [[#Associate members|Associate members]].

===Working Groups===
The Working Groups develop new Bluetooth specifications and enhance adopted specifications.  They are responsible for the vast majority of published standards and specifications.  Participation in the Working Groups is restricted to [[#Promoter members|Promoter members]] and [[#Associate members|Associate members]].

===Committees===
The committees of the SIG deal with the other aspects of licensing, marketing and review including developing and maintaining the Qualification Process, oversight of the ''Bluetooth'' specifications, and developing, improving and maintaining the test methodology and concepts as well as other strategic functions.

==Membership==
Any company incorporating ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology into products, using the technology to offer goods and services or simply re-branding a product with ''Bluetooth'' technology must become a member of the Bluetooth SIG. There are three levels of corporate membership totaling more than 13,000 members, and individuals from member companies may also participate.

===Promoter members===
These members are the most active in the SIG and have considerable influence over both the strategic and technological directions of Bluetooth as a whole. The current promoter members are:<ref>https://www.bluetooth.org/apps/content/?doc_id=44513</ref>
 
*[[Ericsson|Ericsson Technology Licensing]] (founder member)
*[[Intel]] (founder member)
*[[Lenovo]]  (since 2005)
*[[Microsoft]] (since 2008)
*[[Motorola]] (since 1999)
*[[Nokia]] (founder member)
*[[Toshiba]] (founder member)
*[[IBM]] (founder member)

Each Promoter member has one seat (and one vote) on the Board of Directors and the Qualification Review Board (the body responsible for developing and maintaining the qualification process). They each may have multiple staff in the various working groups and committees that comprise the work of the SIG.

The SIG's website carries a [https://www.bluetooth.org/apps/directory/default.aspx] full list of  members].

===Associate members===
The Bluetooth SIG Associate membership fees have stayed the same since 2006.  Associate membership is renewed annually and the yearly fee depends on the individual company's revenue. Companies with annual revenue in excess of $100M US are considered Large Associates and pay annual membership fees of $35,000 US.  Small Associates are categorized as those organizations with revenue less than $100M US and join the SIG with an annual membership fee of $7,500 US.  Associate members of the SIG get early access to draft specifications at versions 0.5 and 0.7 and are eligible to participate and gain a voting seat in working groups and committees—a key opportunity to work with other Associate and Promoter members on enhancing existing specifications. They are also eligible for enhanced marketing support, receive discounts on product qualification listings and SIG events including Bluetooth World and UnPlugFest (UPF) testing events.

===Adopter members===
Adopter membership in the SIG is free and entitles members to use published ''Bluetooth '' wireless specifications and ''Bluetooth'' trademarks.  Adopter members do not have early access to unpublished specifications and may not participate in working groups or committees to influence the development of the technology.

===Individuals===
Membership is not currently open to individuals.

===Universities===
Universities are accepted for membership.  The person registering the institution must have the power and authority to accept the Membership Agreements [https://www.bluetooth.org/apps/content/?doc_id=44514] on behalf of the school.  Note that students may not register their school, but may create user accounts on the SIG membership portal, [http://www.bluetooth.org www.bluetooth.org], that are associated with their school's existing SIG membership.

==Qualification==
Next to the development of the technology itself, the qualification process is one of the most important aspects of ''Bluetooth'' technology, supporting interoperability, conformance to the ''Bluetooth '' specifications, and to strengthening the ''Bluetooth'' brand.  ''Bluetooth'' Qualification is a requirement for any product using the technology and a precondition of the intellectual property license for ''Bluetooth'' technology.  An overview of the process including steps of the Qualification Process and Qualification Types and Fees is available on the Bluetooth SIG public portal, [http://www.bluetooth.com/English/Technology/Building/Pages/Qualifications.aspx]. 

The Qualification program enables members to perform most or all of the required Qualification testing, assessment and listing functions.  ''Bluetooth'' Qualification Experts (BQEs) and ''Bluetooth'' Qualification Test Facilities (BQTFs) are still available to members for support of the Qualification process, but are now an optional service.  Note that BQTFs are still a requirement for any tests that are CAT-A.  Members who are uncertain or unfamiliar with the Qualification Process are encouraged to consider use of one or both of these service types.
