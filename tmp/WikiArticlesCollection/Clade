A '''clade''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|κλάδος}}, ''klados'', "branch") or '''monophylum''' (see [[monophyletic]]) is a group consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants, a single "branch" on the "[[Tree of life (science)|tree of life]]".<ref name=Dupuis>{{cite journal | last=Dupuis | first=Claude | year=1984 | title=Willi Hennig's impact on taxonomic thought | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=15 | pages=1–24 | issn=0066-4162}}</ref> The ancestor may be an individual, a population or even a [[species]] ([[extinct]] or [[Extant taxon|extant]]). Many familiar groups, [[rodent]]s and [[insect]]s for example, are clades; others, like [[lizard]]s and [[monkey]]s, are not (lizards excludes snakes, monkeys excludes apes and humans). [[File:Clade-grade II.svg|thumb|right|334 px|[[Cladogram]] (family tree) of a biological group. The red and blue boxes at right and left represent clades (i.e., complete branches). The green box in the middle is not a clade, but rather represents an [[evolutionary grade]], an incomplete group, because the blue clade at left is [[common descent|descended]] from it, but is excluded.]] Increasingly, taxonomists try to name preferably or only [[Taxon|taxa]] that are clades.

==Etymology==
The term "clade" was coined in 1957 by the biologist [[Julian Huxley]] to refer to the result of [[cladogenesis]], a concept Huxley borrowed from [[Bernhard Rensch]].<ref name=Dupuis/><ref name=Huxley>{{cite journal | last = Huxley | first = J.

==Definitions==

===Clade and ancestor===
A clade is by definition [[monophyletic]], meaning it contains one ancestor (which can be an organism, a [[population]], or a [[species]]) and all its descendants.<ref group=note>
A semantic case has been made that the name should be "holophyletic," but this term has not acquired widespread use.

==Clades and phylogenetic trees==
{{main|Phylogenetics}}
{{main|Cladistics}}

The science that tries to reconstruct phylogenetic trees and thus discover clades is called [[phylogenetics]] or [[cladistics]], the latter term being derived from "clade" by [[Ernst Mayr]] (1965). The results of phylogenetic/cladistic analyses are tree-shaped diagrams called ''[[cladogram]]s''; they, and all their branches, are phylogenetic hypotheses.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nixon|first=Kevin C.|coauthors=Carpenter, James M.|title=On the Other "Phylogenetic Systematics"|journal=Cladistics|date=1 September 2000|volume=16|issue=3|pages=298–318|doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2000.tb00285.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2000.tb00285.x/pdf}}</ref>

Three methods of defining clades are featured in phylogenetic nomenclature: node-, stem-, and apomorphy-based:
* In node-based definition, clade name A refers to the least inclusive clade containing taxa (or specimens) X, Y, etc. A is the clade consisting of the last common ancestor of these taxa together with all the descendents of that ancestor. The ancestor is the branch point, or node.
* In stem-based definition, A refers to the most inclusive clade containing X and Y, etc., but not U or V etc. A consists of all organisms more closely related to both X and Y than to either U or V.
* In apomorphy-based definition, A refers to the clade containing X with an apomorphy α (a trait) together with the earliest ancestor from which X inherited α and all other descendants of that ancestor.

==Terminology==

The relationship between clades can be described in several ways:

* A clade located within a clade is said to be ''nested'' within that clade. In the diagram, the [[Ape|hominoid]] clade, the apes and humans, is nested within the primate clade.
* Two clades are ''[[Sister group|sisters]]'' if they have an immediate common ancestor. In the diagram, lemurs and lorises are sister clades.
* A clade ''A'' is ''[[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]]'' to a clade ''B'' if ''A'' branches off the lineage leading to ''B'' before ''B''&thinsp;'s first member. In the diagram to the right, the [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] clade, including the lemurs and lorises, is basal to the [[Hominoidea|hominoids]], the apes and humans. Some authors have used "basal" differently to mean a clade that is "more primitive" or less species-rich than its sister clade; others consider this usage to be incorrect.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Krell |first=F.-T. |last2=Cranston |first2=P. |year=2004 |title=Which side of the tree is more basal? |journal=Systematic Entomology |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=279–281 |doi=10.1111/j.0307-6970.2004.00262.x |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref>

== Nomenclature and taxonomy ==
[[File:Haeckel arbol bn.png|thumb|right|Early phylogenetic tree by [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], 1866]]

The idea of a clade did not exist in pre-[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] [[Linnaean taxonomy]], which was based by necessity only on internal or external [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] similarities between organisms – although as it happens, many of the better known animal groups in Linnaeus' original [[Systema Naturae]] (notably among the [[vertebrate]] groups) do represent clades. The phenomenon of [[convergent evolution]] is however responsible for many cases where there are misleading similarities in the morphology of groups that evolved from different lineages.

With the publication of Darwin's [[Evolution|theory of evolution]] in 1859, the idea was born that groups used in a system of classification should represent branches on the evolutionary [[tree of life]]. In the century and a half since then, taxonomists have increasingly worked to make the taxonomic system reflect evolution. When it comes to [[Nomenclature#Biology|naming]], however, this principle is not always compatible with the traditional [[Linnaean taxonomy|rank-based nomenclature]]. In the latter, only taxa associated with a [[Taxonomic rank|rank]] can be named, yet there are not enough ranks to name a long series of nested clades; also, taxon names cannot be defined in a way that guarantees them to refer to clades. For these and other reasons, [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] has been developed; it is still controversial.
