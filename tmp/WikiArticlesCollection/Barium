'''Barium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&nbsp;'''Ba''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;56. It is the fifth element in Group 2, a soft silvery [[metal]]lic [[alkaline earth metal]]. Because of its high chemical [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] barium is never found in nature as a free element. Its hydroxide was known in pre-modern history as [[Barium hydroxide|baryta]]; this substance does not occur as a [[mineral]], but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate.

The most common naturally occurring minerals of barium are [[Baryte|barite]] ([[barium sulfate]], BaSO<sub>4</sub>) and [[witherite]] ([[barium carbonate]], BaCO<sub>3</sub>), both being insoluble in water. Barium's name originates from the alchemical derivative "baryta", which itself comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] βαρύς (''barys''), meaning "heavy." Barium was identified as a new element in 1774, but not reduced to a metal until 1808, shortly after electrolytic isolation techniques became available.

Barium has only a few industrial applications. The metal has been historically used to [[getter|scavenge air]] in [[vacuum tube]]s. It is a component of [[YBCO]] ([[high-temperature superconductor]]s) and electroceramics, and is added to steel and cast iron to reduce the size of carbon grains within the microstructure of the metal. Barium compounds are added to fireworks to impart a green color. [[Barium sulfate]] is used as an insoluble heavy additive to [[oil well]] [[drilling fluid]], and in purer form, as X-ray [[radiocontrast agent]]s for imaging the human gastrointestinal tract. Soluble barium compounds are poisonous due to release of the soluble barium [[ion]], and therefore have been used as [[rodenticide]]s.

===Physical properties===
[[File:Barium 1.jpg|thumb|left|Oxidized barium]]
Barium is a soft, silvery-white metal, with a slight golden shade when ultrapure.<ref name="Ullman2005">{{cite book |author=Kresse, Robert; Baudis, Ulrich; Jäger, Paul; Riechers, H. Hermann; Wagner, Heinz; Winkler, Jocher; Wolf, Hans Uwe |chapter=Barium and Barium Compounds |editor=Ullman, Franz |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year=2007 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |doi=10.1002/14356007.a03_325.pub2}}</ref>{{rp|2}} The silvery-white color of barium metal rapidly vanishes upon [[redox|oxidation]] in air yielding a dark gray [[oxide]] layer. Barium has a medium [[specific weight]] and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure barium is very hard to prepare, and therefore many properties of barium have not been accurately measured yet.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|2}}

At room temperature and pressure, barium has a [[body-centered cubic]] structure, with a barium–barium distance of 503 [[picometer]]s, expanding with heating at a rate of approximately 1.8{{e|-5}}/°C.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|2}} It is a very soft metal with a [[Mohs hardness]] of 1.25.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|2}}  Its melting temperature of {{convert|1000|K|C F}}<ref name="Lide2004">{{cite book|last = Lide |first= D.

===Chemical reactivity===
Barium is chemically similar to magnesium, calcium, and strontium, being even more reactive. It always exhibits the oxidation state of +2.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|2}} Reactions with [[chalcogen]]s are highly [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] (release energy); the reaction with oxygen or air occurs at room temperature, and therefore barium is stored under oil or inert gas atmosphere.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|2}} Reactions with other [[nonmetal]]s, such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, and hydrogen, are generally exothermic and proceed upon heating.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|2–3}} Reactions with water and alcohols are also very exothermic and release hydrogen gas:<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|3}}
: Ba + 2 ROH → Ba(OR)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>↑ (R is an alkyl or a hydrogen atom)

Additionally, barium reacts with [[ammonia]] to form complexes such as Ba(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|3}}

The metal is readily attacked by most acids. [[Sulfuric acid]] is a notable exception, as [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] stops the reaction by forming the insoluble [[barium sulfate]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Müller, Hermann|chapter=Sulfuric Acid and Sulfur Trioxide|editor=Ullman, Franz|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2007|publisher=Wiley-VCH|doi=10.1002/14356007.a03_325.pub2}}</ref>  Barium combines with several metals, including [[aluminium]], [[zinc]], [[lead]], and [[tin]], forming [[intermetallics|intermetallic phases]] and alloys.<ref>{{cite book|author= Ferro, Riccardo and Saccone, Adriana|page=355|title=Intermetallic Chemistry|publisher=Elsevier|year=2008|isbn=978-0-08-044099-6}}</ref>

Barium salts are typically white when solid and colorless when dissolved, as barium ions provide no specific coloring.<ref>{{cite book|page=87|title=Qualitative analysis and the properties of ions in aqueous solution|author=Slowinski, Emil J.; Masterton, William L.|publisher=Saunders|year=1990|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-03-031234-2}}</ref> They are also denser than their [[strontium]] or [[calcium]] analogs, except for the [[halide]]s (see table; [[zinc]] is given for comparison).

[[Barium hydroxide]] ("baryta") was known to alchemists who produced it by heating barium carbonate. Unlike calcium hydroxide, it absorbs very little CO<sub>2</sub> in aqueous solutions and is therefore insensitive to atmospheric fluctuations. This property is used in calibrating pH equipment.

Volatile barium compounds burn with a green to pale green [[flame test|flame]], which is an efficient test to detect a barium compound. The color results from [[spectral lines]] at 455.4, 493.4, 553.6, and 611.1&nbsp;nm.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|3}} <!---BaO forms a peroxide when heated in air.<ref name=O2/>--->

Barium occurs naturally on Earth as a mixture of seven primordial nuclides, barium-130, 132, and 134 through 138.<ref name="iso"/> The first two are thought to be radioactive: barium-130 should decay to xenon-130 via double [[Beta decay|beta plus decay]], and barium-132 should similarly decay to xenon-132.

==History==
[[File:Humphry Davy Engraving 1830.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sir Humphry Davy, who first isolated barium metal]]
Alchemists in the early Middle Ages knew about some barium minerals. Smooth pebble-like stones of mineral barite found in [[Bologna]], [[Italy]], were known as "Bologna stones." Witches and alchemists were attracted to them because after exposure to light they would glow for years.<ref name=history/> The phosphorescent properties of barite heated with organics were described by V. Casciorolus in 1602.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|5}}

[[Carl Scheele]] identified barite as containing a new element in 1774, but could not isolate barium, only [[barium oxide]]. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] also isolated [[barium oxide]] two years later in similar studies. Oxidized barium was at first called "barote," by [[Guyton de Morveau]], a name that was changed by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] to ''baryta.'' Also in the 18th century, English mineralogist [[William Withering]] noted a heavy mineral in the lead mines of [[Cumberland]], now known to be [[witherite]]. Barium was first isolated by electrolysis of molten barium salts in 1808, by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] in [[England]].<ref>Davy, H. (1808) "[http://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&pg=102 Electro-chemical researches on the decomposition of the earths; with observations on the metals obtained from the alkaline earths, and on the amalgam procured from ammonia]," ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', vol. 98, pp. 333–370.</ref> Davy, by analogy with [[calcium]] named "barium" after baryta, with the "-ium" ending signifying a metallic element.<ref name=history>{{cite book| page = 80| url = http://books.google.com/?id=yb9xTj72vNAC| title = The history and use of our earth's chemical elements: a reference guide| author = Krebs, Robert E. | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2006| isbn = 0-313-33438-2}}</ref> [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Augustus Matthiessen]] obtained pure barium by electrolysis of a molten mixture of [[barium chloride]] and [[ammonium chloride]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1002/jlac.18550930301|title = Masthead|year = 1855|journal = Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume = 93|issue = 3|pages = fmi–fmi}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi =10.1002/prac.18560670194|title =Notizen|year =1856|last1 =Wagner|first1 =Rud.|last2 =Neubauer|first2 =C.|last3 =Deville|first3 =H.

The production of pure oxygen in the [[Brin process]] was a large-scale application of barium peroxide in the 1880s, before it was replaced by electrolysis and [[fractional distillation]] of liquefied air in the early 1900s. In this process barium oxide reacts at {{convert|500|-|600|C|F}} with air to form barium peroxide, which decomposes at above {{convert|700|C}} by releasing oxygen:<ref name=O2>{{cite journal|last1 = Jensen|first1 = William B.|title = The Origin of the Brin Process for the Manufacture of Oxygen|journal = Journal of Chemical Education|volume = 86|pages = 1266|year = 2009|doi = 10.1021/ed086p1266|issue = 11 |bibcode = 2009JChEd..86.1266J}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=34KwmkU4LG0C&pg=PA681|page = 681|title = The development of modern chemistry|isbn = 978-0-486-64235-2|author1 = Ihde, Aaron John|date = 1984-04-01}}</ref>

==Occurrence and production==
The abundance of barium is 0.0425% in the Earth's crust and 13&nbsp;µg/L in sea water. The main commercial source of barium is barite (also called barytes or heavy spar), which is a barium sulfate mineral.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|5}} Its deposits are spread all over the world. The only other commercial source is far less important than barite; it is witherite, a barium carbonate mineral. Its main deposits are located in England, Romania, and the former USSR.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|5}}

The barite reserves are estimated between 0.7 and 2 billion [[tonne]]s. The maximum production was achieved in 1981, at 8.3 million tonnes, and only 7–8% of it was used to make barium or its compounds.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|5}} The barite production has again risen since the second half of the 1990s: from 5.6 million tonnes in 1996 to 7.6 in 2005 and 7.8 in 2011. China accounts for more than 50% of this output, followed by India (14% in 2011), Morocco (8.3%), US (8.2%), Turkey (2.5%), Iran and Kazakhstan (2.6% each).<ref>Miller, M. M.

The mined ore is washed, crushed, classified, and separated from quartz. If the quartz penetrates too deep into the ore, or the iron, zinc, or lead content is abnormally high, then [[froth flotation]]<!--http://books.google.de/books?id=zNicdkuulE4C&pg=PA223--> methods are applied. The product is a 98% pure barite (by mass); the purity should be no less than 95%, with a minimal content of iron and [[silicon dioxide]].<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|7}} It is then reduced by carbon to barium sulfide:<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|6}}
:BaSO<sub>4</sub> + 2 C → BaS + 2 CO<sub>2</sub>↑

The water-soluble barium sulfide is the starting point for other compounds: dissolved BaS upon reaction with oxygen gives the hydroxide, with nitric acid the nitrate, with carbon dioxide the carbonate, and so on.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|6}} The nitrate can be thermally decomposed to yield the oxide.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|6}} Barium metal is produced by reduction with [[aluminium]] at {{convert|1100|C}}. The [[intermetallic compound]] BaAl<sub>4</sub> is produced first:<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|3}}
:3 BaO + 14 Al → 3 BaAl<sub>4</sub> + Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>

It is an intermediate, which reacts with barium oxide to give the metal. Note that not all barium is reduced.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|3}}
:8 BaO + BaAl<sub>4</sub> → Ba↑ + 7 BaAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>

The remaining barium oxide reacts with the formed aluminium oxide:<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|3}}
:BaO + Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> → BaAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>

and the overall reaction is<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|3}}
:4 BaO + 2 Al → 3 Ba↑ + BaAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>

The thus produced barium vapor is collected at the cooler part of the apparatus and then packed into molds under argon atmosphere.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|3}} This method is used commercially and can yield ultrapure barium.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|3}} Commonly sold barium is about 99% pure, with main impurities being strontium and calcium (up to 0.8% and 0.25%) and other contaminants contributing less than 0.1%.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|4}}

A similar reaction with silicon at {{convert|1200|C}} yields barium and [[barium metasilicate]].<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|3}} Electrolysis is not used because barium readily dissolves in molten halides and is rather impure when isolated with this method.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|3}}

===Gemstone===
A barium-containing mineral [[benitoite]] (barium titanium silicate) occurs as a very rare blue fluorescent gemstone, and is the official state gem of [[California]].

==Applications==
===Metal and alloys===
Barium, as a metal or when alloyed with aluminium, is used to remove unwanted gases ([[getter]]ing) from vacuum tubes, such as TV picture tubes.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|4}} Barium is suitable for this purpose because of its low [[vapor pressure]] and reactivity towards oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water; it can even partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice. This application is gradually disappearing due to the rising popularity of the tubeless LCD and plasma sets.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|4}}

Other uses of elemental barium are minor and include an additive to [[silumin]] (aluminium–silicon alloys) that refines their structure, as well as<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|4}}
* [[bearing alloy]]s;
* lead–tin [[soldering alloy]]s – to increase the creep resistance;
* alloy with nickel for [[spark plug]]s;
* additive to steel and cast iron as an inoculant;
* alloys with calcium, manganese, silicon, and aluminium as high-grade steel deoxidizers.

===Barium sulfate and barite===
[[File:BariumXray.jpg|thumb|left|[[Amoebiasis]] as seen in radiograph of barium-filled colon]]
Barium sulfate (the mineral barite, BaSO<sub>4</sub>) is important to the petroleum industry, for example, as a [[drilling fluid]] in [[oil well|oil and gas wells]].<ref name="Lide2004" />{{rp|4–5}} The precipitate of the compound (called "blanc fixe", from a French expression meaning "permanent white") is used in paints and varnishes, and also as a filler in ringing ink, plastics, and rubbers.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|9}} It is also a paper coating pigment.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|9}} In the form of nanoparticles, it can improve physical properties of some polymers, such as epoxies.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|9}}

Barium sulfate has a low toxicity and relatively high density of ca. 4.5 g·cm<sup>−3</sup> (and thus opacity to X-rays). For this reason it is used as a [[radiocontrast]] agent in [[medical imaging|X-ray imaging]] of the digestive system ("[[barium meal]]s" and "[[Lower gastrointestinal series|barium enemas]]").<ref name="Lide2004" />{{rp|4–5}} [[Lithopone]], a [[pigment]] that contains barium sulfate and [[zinc sulfide]], is a permanent white that has good covering power, and does not darken when exposed to sulfides.<ref>{{cite book| page = 102| url = http://books.google.com/?id=uEJHsZWyO-EC| title= Medicinal applications of coordination chemistry| author = Jones, Chris J. and Thornback, John | publisher =Royal Society of Chemistry| year = 2007| isbn =0-85404-596-1}}</ref>

===Other barium compounds===
[[File:2006 Fireworks 1.JPG|thumb|Green barium fireworks]]

* [[Barium oxide]] is used in a coating for the [[electrode]]s of [[fluorescent lamp]]s, which facilitates the release of [[electron]]s.
* [[Barium carbonate]] is used in glassmaking. Being a heavy element, barium increases the [[refractive index]] and luster of the glass.<ref name="Lide2004" />{{rp|4–5}} The compound is also used to reduce leaks of X-rays from [[cathode ray tubes]] (CRT) TV sets.<ref name="Ullman2005" />{{rp|12–13}}

At low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, whereas higher doses affect the [[nervous system]], causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, [[anxiety]], [[dyspnea]] and [[paralysis]]. This may be due to the ability of Ba<sup>2+</sup> to block [[potassium ion channels]], which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system.<ref>{{cite book |pages = 77–78| isbn = 0-07-049439-8|url = http://books.google.com/?id=Xqj-TTzkvTEC&pg=PA243 |title = Handbook of inorganic chemicals |author = Patnaik, Pradyot |year = 2003}}</ref> Other target organs for water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin.<ref name=bariumtoxic>{{cite book|title=Barium|url=http://www.espimetals.com/index.php/msds/46-barium|accessdate=2012-06-11|publisher=ESPI Metals}}</ref> They affect the body strongly, causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.<ref name=bariumtoxic/>

To avoid a potentially vigorous chemical reaction, barium metal is kept under argon or mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous, as it may cause ignition. Moisture, friction, heat, sparks, flames, shocks, static electricity, reactions with oxidizers and acids should be avoided. Everything that may make contact with barium should be grounded. Those who work with the metal should wear pre-cleaned non-sparking shoes, flame-resistant rubber clothes, rubber gloves, apron, goggles, and a gas mask; they are not allowed to smoke in the working area and must wash themselves after handling barium.<ref name=bariumtoxic/>
