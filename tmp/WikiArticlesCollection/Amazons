The '''Amazons''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνες}}, ''Amazónes'', singular {{lang|grc|Ἀμαζών}}, ''Amazōn''), also known as Oiorpata in the Scythian language, are a nation of all-female warriors in [[Greek mythology]] and [[Classical antiquity]]. [[Herodotus]] placed them in a region bordering [[Scythia]] in [[Sarmatians|Sarmatia]] (modern territory of [[Ukraine]]). Other historiographers place them in [[Asia Minor]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=0627113515282-2010-06-28 |title=4,000-year-old legend about northern Turkey to become film - Hurriyet Daily News and Economic Review |publisher=Hurriyetdailynews.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07}}</ref> or sometimes [[Ancient Libya|Libya]].<ref name="DGRBM">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Schmitz | first = Leonhard | authorlink = Leonhard Schmitz | title = Amazones | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 137–138 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0146.html}}</ref>

Notable queens of the Amazons are [[Penthesilea]], who participated in the [[Trojan War]], and her sister [[Hippolyta]], whose magical girdle, given to her by her father [[Ares]], was the object of one of the [[labours of Hercules]]. Amazonian raiders were often depicted in battle with Greek warriors in [[amazonomachy|amazonomachies]] in classical art.

The Amazons have become associated with many historical people throughout the [[Roman Empire period]] and [[Late Antiquity]]. In [[Roman historiography]], there are various accounts of Amazon raids in Asia Minor.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} From the Early Modern period, their name has become a term for female warriors in general.

==Etymology==

The origin of the word is uncertain. It may be derived from an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[ethnonym]] ''*ha-mazan-'' "warriors", a word attested as a denominal verb in [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]'s gloss {{lang|grc|«ἁμαζακάραν· πολεμεῖν. Πέρσαι»}} ("''hamazakaran'': 'to make war' in Persian") and which also appears together with the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] root ''*kar-'' "make" in [[Sanskrit]] ''[[karma]]''.<ref>Lagercrantz, ''Xenia Lidéniana'' (1912), 270ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]], ''Greek Etymological Dictionary'' (1960, 1970) [http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/param-change-handle.cgi?url=response.cgi%3Froot%3Dleiden%26morpho%3D0%26basename%3D\data\ie\frisk%26first%3D351&encoding=utf-eng]</ref>
Alternatively, a Greek derivation from ''{{PIE|*ṇ-mṇ-gw-jon-es}}'' "manless, without husbands" ([[privative a|''a-'' privative]] and a derivation of ''[[Man (word)|*man-]]'' also found in Slavic ''muzh'') has been proposed, an explanation deemed "unlikely" by [[Hjalmar Frisk]].<ref>Jacobsohn, [[Kuhns Zeitschrift|KZ]] 54, 278ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]] (1960, 1970).</ref>
19th century scholarship also connected the term to the ethnonym [[Amazigh]].<ref>Guy Cadogan Rothery, ''The Amazons'' (1910) , [http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/ama/ama08.htm ch. 7]: "There have been some authors who trace the word Amazon from this term."</ref> A further explanation proposes Iranian *''ama-janah'' "virility-killing" as source.<ref>{{harvnb|Hinge|2005|pp=94–98}}</ref>

Among Classical Greeks, ''amazon'' was given a [[popular etymology]] as from ''a-mazos'' "without [[breast]]", connected with an [[etiology|etiological]] tradition that Amazons had their right [[mastectomy|breast cut off]] or [[breast ironing|burnt out]], so they would be able to throw their javelins;<ref>http://www.credoreference.com/entry/brewerphrase/amazon [[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]; [[Guy Cadogan Rothery]] ''The Amazons'' (1910)</ref> there is no indication of such a practice in works of art, in which the Amazons are always represented with both breasts, although the left is frequently covered (see photos in article).

==Origins==
[[File:Amazon trousers BM VaseB673.jpg|upright|thumb|Amazon wearing trousers and carrying a shield with an attached patterned cloth and a quiver. [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic white-ground [[alabastron]], c. 470 BC, [[British Museum]], London]]

The legendary Amazons are believed to have lived in [[Pontus]],<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Trabzon and Pontus |url=http://www.karalahana.com/english/archive/history.html |publisher=Karalahana.Com |year=2012 |accessdate=2013-06-12}}</ref> which is part of modern-day [[Turkey]] near the southern shore of the Euxine Sea (the [[Black Sea]]). There they formed an independent kingdom under the government of a queen named [[Hippolyta]] or Hippolyte ("loose, unbridled mare").<ref>This area is known to have been occupied in the Late Bronze Age by a transhumant group known to the Hittites as the [[Kaskians|Kaŝka]]; though they were not directly known to Greeks, modern archaeologists have detected that they finally defeated their enemies, the Hittites, about 1200 BCE; they left no inscriptions.</ref> The Amazons were supposed to have founded many towns, amongst them [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], and [[Paphos]]. According to the dramatist [[Aeschylus]], in the distant past they had lived in [[Scythia]] (modern [[Crimea]]), at the ''Palus Maeotis'' ("Lake Maeotis", the [[Sea of Azov]]). According to [[Plutarch]], the Amazons lived in and about the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] river, which the Greeks called the Tanais; but which was called by the Scythians the "Amazon". The Amazons later moved to [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]] (modern [[Terme]]) on the River [[Thermodon]] (the Terme river in northern Turkey). [[Herodotus]] called them ''Androktones'' ("killers of men"), and he stated that in the Scythian language they were called ''Oiorpata'', which he asserted had this meaning.

==The myth==

In some versions of the myth, no men were permitted to have sexual encounters or reside in Amazon country; but once a year, in order to prevent their race from dying out, they visited the [[Gargareans]], a neighbouring tribe. The male children who were the result of these visits were either killed, sent back to their fathers or [[child abandonment|exposed in the wilderness]] to fend for themselves; the girls were kept and brought up by their mothers, and trained in agricultural pursuits, hunting, and the art of war. In other versions when the Amazons went to war they would not kill all the men. Some they would take as slaves, and once or twice a year they would have sex with their slaves.<ref>[[Strabo]] xi. 503.</ref>

The intermarriage of Amazons and men from other tribes was also used to explain the origin of various people; for example, the story of the Amazons settling with the Scythians (Herodotus Histories 4.110.1-117.1).<ref>[[Wikisource:History of Herodotus/Book 4|History of Herodotus, Book 4]]</ref>

In the ''[[Iliad]]'', the Amazons were referred to as ''Antianeirai'' ("those who fight like men").

The Amazons appear in [[Greek art]] of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] and in connection with several Greek legends. They invaded [[Lycia]], but were defeated by [[Bellerophon]], who was sent against them by [[Iobates]], the king of that country, in the hope that he might meet his death at their hands.<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' vi. 186, &c.</ref><ref>[[Scholiast]] ''On [[Lycophron]]'' 17</ref> The tomb of [[Myrine]] is mentioned in the ''Iliad''; later interpretation made of her an Amazon: according to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]],<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' Book ii.45-46; book iii.52-55</ref> Queen Myrine led her Amazons to victory against [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] and much of [[Gorgon]].

They attacked the [[Phrygia]]ns, who were assisted by [[Priam]], then a young man.<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' iii. 189</ref> In his later years, however, towards the end of the [[Trojan War]], his old opponents took his side against the Greeks under their queen [[Penthesilea]] "of [[Thrace|Thracian]] birth", who was slain by [[Achilles]].<ref>In the ''[[Aethiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''Iliad''. The epic, by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], is lost: only references to it survive.</ref><ref>[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] i. 699</ref><ref>[[Justin (historian)|Justin]] ii.4</ref><ref>[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 490</ref><ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' v. 11. § 2</ref><ref>[[Philostratus]] ''Her.'' xix. 19</ref>

One of the [[Labours of Hercules|tasks imposed upon Heracles]] by [[Eurystheus]] was to obtain possession of the [[girdle]] of the Amazonian queen [[Hippolyta]].<ref>[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' ii. 5</ref><ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' iv. 16</ref><ref>[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 30</ref><ref>[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] xi. 244</ref> He was accompanied by his friend [[Theseus]], who carried off the princess [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], sister of Hippolyta, an incident which led to a retaliatory invasion of [[Attica]],<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' i. 2</ref><ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' 26-28</ref> in which Antiope perished fighting by the side of Theseus. In some versions, however, Theseus marries Hippolyta and in others, he marries Antiope and she does not die; by this marriage with the Amazon Theseus had a son [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]]. The battle between the Athenians and Amazons is often commemorated in an entire genre of art, [[amazonomachy]], in marble [[bas-relief]]s such as from the [[Parthenon]] or the sculptures of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]].
[[File:Thalestris, Queen of the Amazons, visits Alexander (1696).jpg|left|thumb|[[Thalestris]], Queen of the Amazons, visits [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] (1696)]]

The Amazons are also said to have undertaken an expedition against the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|island of Leuke]], at the mouth of the [[Danube]], where the ashes of Achilles had been deposited by [[Thetis]]. The ghost of the dead hero appeared and so terrified the horses, that they threw and trampled upon the invaders, who were forced to retire. [[Pompey]] is said to have found them in the army of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

They are heard of in the time of Alexander, when some of the king's biographers make mention of Amazon Queen [[Thalestris]] visiting him and becoming a mother by him (the story is known from the ''[[Alexander Romance]]''). However, several other biographers of Alexander dispute the claim, including the highly regarded [[secondary source]], [[Plutarch]]. In his writing he makes mention of a moment when Alexander's secondary naval commander, [[Onesicritus]], was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King [[Lysimachus]] of [[Thrace]] who was on the original expedition: the king smiled at him and said "And where was I, then?"

The Roman writer [[Virgil]]'s characterization of the [[Volsci]]an warrior maiden [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' borrows heavily from the myth of the Amazons.

[[Jordanes]]' ''[[Getica]]'' (c. 560), purporting to give the earliest history of the [[Goths]], relates that the Goths' ancestors, descendants of [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]], originally dwelt within Scythia, on the [[Sea of Azov]] between the [[Dnieper]] and [[Don River (Russia)|Don Rivers]]. After a few centuries, following an incident where the Goths' women successfully fended off a raid by a neighboring tribe, while the menfolk were off campaigning against Pharaoh [[Vesosis]], the women formed their own army under [[Marpesia]] and crossed the Don, invading Asia. Her sister [[Lampedo]] remained in Europe to guard the homeland. They procreated with men once a year. These Amazons conquered Armenia, Syria, and all of Asia Minor, even reaching [[Ionia]] and [[Aeolis|Aeolia]], holding this vast territory for 100 years. Jordanes also mentions that they fought with Hercules, and in the Trojan War, and that a smaller contingent of them endured in the Caucasus Mountains until the time of Alexander. He mentions by name the Queens Menalippe, Hippolyta, and Penthesilea.

===Lists===
[[File:Amazone Staatliche Antikensammlungen 8953.jpg|thumb|Fleeing Amazon. Tondo of an Attic red-figure kylix, 510–500 BC.]]
{{split section|List of legendary and mythological Amazons|date=June 2013}}

There are several (conflicting) lists of names of Amazons.

[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]<ref>[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''[[Posthomerica]]'' I</ref> lists the attendant warriors of Penthesilea: "Clonie was there, Polemusa, Derinoe, Evandre, and [[Antandre]], and [[Bremusa]], [[Hippothoe]], dark-eyed Harmothoe, [[Alcibie]], Derimacheia, Antibrote, and Thermodosa glorying with the spear."

[[Diodorus Siculus]]<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' IV. 16</ref> enlists nine Amazons who challenged Heracles to single combat during his quest for Hippolyta's girdle and died against him one by one: [[Aella (Amazon)|Aella]], Philippis, Prothoe, Eriboea, [[Celaeno]], Eurybia, [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]], Deianeira, [[Asteria]], Marpe, Tecmessa, Alcippe. After Alcippe's death, a group attack followed.

Another list of Amazons' names is found in [[Hyginus]]' ''Fabulae''.<ref>[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 163</ref> Along with [[Hippolyta]], [[Otrera]], [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]] and [[Penthesilea]], it attests the following names: Ocyale, Dioxippe, Iphinome, Xanthe, [[Hippothoe]], Laomache, [[Glauce]], [[Agave]], Theseis, Clymene, Polydora.

Yet another different set of names is found in [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]]' ''Argonautica'':<ref>[[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/ValeriusFlaccus1.html Argonautica]'', 6. 370-377</ref> he mentions Euryale, Harpe, Lyce, Menippe and Thoe. Of these Lyce also appears in a fragment preserved in the ''[[Latin Anthology]]'' where she is said to have killed the hero Clonus of [[Moesia]], son of Doryclus, with her javelin.<ref name="Latin Anthology" />

[[John Tzetzes]] in ''Posthomerica''<ref>[[Tzetzes]], ''Posthomerica'', 176-183</ref> enumerates the Amazons that fell at [[Troy]]: Hippothoe, Antianeira, Toxophone, Toxoanassa, Gortyessa, Iodoce, Pharetre, Andro, Ioxeia, Oïstrophe, Androdaïxa, Aspidocharme, Enchesimargos, Cnemis, Thorece, Chalcaor, Eurylophe, Hecate, Anchimache, Andromache the queen. Concerning Antianeira and Andromache, see below; for almost all the other names on the list, this is a unique attestation.

[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] provides an alternate list of the Amazons that fell against Heracles, describing them as "the most prominent" of their people: Tralla, Isocrateia, Thiba, Palla, Coea (Koia), Coenia (Koinia).<ref>[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v. ''Thibaïs''</ref> [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] gives the same list minus the last two names.<ref>Eustathius on [[Dionysius Periegetes]], 828</ref> Both Stephanus and Eustathius write of these Amazons in connection with the placename Thibais, which they report to have been derived from Thiba's name.

Other names of Amazons from various sources include:

===Hero cults===

According to ancient sources, ([[Plutarch]] [[Theseus]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:BiDerPMT15YJ:classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/theseus.html+Amazon+statues+in+Scotussa&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=4 |title=The Internet Classics Archive &#124; Theseus by Plutarch |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}</ref> [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]), Amazon tombs could be found frequently throughout what was once known as the ancient Greek world. Some are found in [[Megara]], [[Athens]], [[Chaeronea]], [[Chalcis]], [[Thessaly]] at [[Skotousa]], in [[Cynoscephalae]], and statues of Amazons are all over Greece. At both Chalcis and Athens, [[Plutarch]] tells us that there was an Amazoneum or shrine of Amazons that implied the presence of both tombs and cult. On the day before the Thesea at Athens there were annual sacrifices to the Amazons. In historical times Greek maidens of [[Ephesus]] performed an annual circular dance with weapons and shields that had been established by [[Hippolyta]] and her Amazons. They had initially set up wooden statues of [[Artemis]], a bretas, ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], (fl.c.160): Description of Greece, Book I: Attica).<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/pausanias-bk1.html Ancient History Sourcebook: Pausanias: Description of Greece, Book I: Attica<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===In art===

In works of art, battles between Amazons and Greeks are placed on the same level as and often associated with battles of Greeks and [[centaur]]s. The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings. Amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of Scythian or Sarmatian horsemen. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly in the shape of a crescent, called ''pelta'', and in early art a helmet, the model before the Greek mind having apparently been the goddess Athena. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly [[Iran|Persian]] – that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the kidaris. They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot.
This depiction of Amazons demonstrates just how closely, in the Greeks in mind, the Amazons were linked to the Scythians. Their manner of dress has been noted to bear a striking similarity to the traditional dress of nomadic peoples from the Crimea to Mongolia.<ref name="amaz">[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/previous_seasons/case_amazon/clues.html]</ref> Amazons can also be identified in vase paintings by the fact that they are wearing one earring. The battle between Theseus and the Amazons (''[[Amazonomachy]]'') is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples (e.g. the reliefs from the frieze of the temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Bassae]], now in the [[British Museum]]), vases and sarcophagus reliefs; at [[Athens]] it was represented on the shield of the statue of [[Athena Parthenos]], on wall-paintings in the [[Theseum]] and in the ''[[stoa|Stoa Poikile]]''. There were also three standard [[Amazon statue types]].

==In historiography==
[[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men". Moreover, said Herodotus, "No girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle". In the story related by [[Herodotus]], a group of Amazons was blown across the [[Sea of Azov|Maeotian Lake]] (the [[Sea of Azov]]) into [[Scythia]] near the cliff region (today's southeastern [[Crimea]]). After learning the Scythian language, they agreed to marry Scythian men, on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of Scythian women. According to Herodotus, this band moved toward the northeast, settling beyond the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] ([[Don River (Russia)|Don]]) river, and became the ancestors of the [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]]. According to Herodotus, the [[Sarmatians]] fought with the Scythians against [[Darius the Great]] in the 5th century BC.

Hippocrates describes them as: "They have no right breasts...for while they are yet babies their mothers make red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it, so that its growth is arrested, and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm."

Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. Caesar reminded the Senate of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons. Successful Amazon raids against Lycia and Cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by Lydian cavalry against the invaders ([[Strabo]] 5.504; [[Nicholas Damascenus]]). [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] pays particularly detailed attention to the Amazons. The story of the Amazons as deriving from a Cappadocian colony of two Scythian princes Ylinos and Scolopetos is due to him. [[Pliny the Elder]] records some surprising facts pointing to the valley of the [[Terme River]] as possibly being their home: a mountain named for them (the modern Mason Dagi), as well as a settlement Amazonium; Herotodus (VI.86) first mentions their capital [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]], which Pliny locates near the Terme.<ref>[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]] VI.3.10</ref> [[Philostratus]] places the Amazons in the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] places them east of [[Tanais]], as neighbouring the [[Alans]]. [[Procopius]] places them in the Caucasus. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' chapter 49) derived the Amazons from [[Atlantis]] and located them in western [[Ancient Libya|Libya]]. He also relates the story of Hercules defeating the Amazons at Themiscyre.

Although Strabo shows skepticism as to their historicity, the Amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout Late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers speak of the Amazons as of a real people. [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]] embraces the account of Pliny. Under [[Aurelianus]], captured [[Goths|Gothic]] women were identified as Amazons ([[Claudianus]]). The account of [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] was influential, and was used as a source by [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] who continued to be read during the European Middle Ages. Medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.<ref>[[F. A. Ukert]], ''Die Amazonen'', Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1849), 63..</ref>

==Medieval and Renaissance literature==
[[File:Dahomey amazon1.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Dahomey Amazons]] were so named by Western observers due to their similarity to the semi-mythical Amazons.]]
Amazons continued to be discussed by authors of the European Renaissance, and with the [[Age of Exploration]], they were located in ever more remote areas. In 1542, [[Francisco de Orellana]] reached the [[Amazon River]] (''Amazonas'' in Spanish), naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed having encountered and fought there.<ref>It has been suggested that what Orellana actually engaged was an especially warlike tribe of Native Americans whose warrior men had long hair and thus appeared to him as women. See Theobaldo Miranda Santos, ''Lendas e mitos do Brasil'' ("Brazil's legends and myths"), Companhia Editora Nacional, 1979.</ref> Afterwards the whole basin and region of the Amazon (''Amazonía'' in Spanish) were named after the river. Amazons also figure in the accounts of both [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Walter Raleigh]].<ref>Ukert (1849), p. 35.</ref> Famous medieval traveller [[John Mandeville]] mentions them in his book:

:"Beside the land of Chaldea is the land of Amazonia, that is the land of Feminye. And in that real is all woman and no man; not as some may say, that men may not live there, but for because that the women will not suffer no men amongst them to be their sovereigns." <ref>''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', Dover publications, Mineola, New York, 2006, cap. XVII, p. 103-104</ref>

Medieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the [[Corded Ware culture|battle-axe]]. This is probably related to the [[Sagaris]], an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also [[Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan]]). [[Paulus Hector Mair]] expresses astonishment that such a "manly weapon" should have been invented by a "tribe of women", but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, [[Johannes Aventinus]].

[[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' contains a country of warrior women, ruled by Queen Orontea; the epic describes an origin much like that in Greek myth, in that the women, abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers, rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced, to prevent them from regaining power. The Amazons and Queen Hippolyta are also referenced in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' in "[[The Knight's Tale]]".

==Historical background==
[[Classics|Classicist]] Peter Walcot wrote, "Wherever the Amazons are located by the Greeks, whether it is somewhere along the Black Sea in the distant north-east, or in Libya in the furthest south, it is always beyond the confines of [[Civilization|the civilized world]]. The Amazons exist outside the range of normal human experience."<ref>P. Walcot, "Greek Attitudes towards Women: The Mythological Evidence" ''Greece & Rome''2nd Series 31.1 (April 1984, pp. 37-47) p 42.</ref>

Nevertheless, there are various proposals for a historical nucleus of the Amazons of Greek historiography, the most obvious candidates being historical [[Scythia]] and [[Sarmatia]] in line with the account by [[Herodotus]], but some authors prefer a comparison to cultures of Asia Minor or even [[Minoan Crete]].

== Archaeology ==

=== Scythians and Sarmatians ===
Speculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials, pointing to the possibility that some Sarmatian women may have participated in battle. These findings have led scholars to suggest that the Amazonian legend in [[Greek mythology]] may have been "inspired by real warrior women".<ref name="amaz">[http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml Lyn Webster Wilde, "Did the Amazons really exist?" ''Diotima'']</ref>

Evidence of high-ranking warrior women comes from [[kurgans]] in southern Ukraine and Russia.
David Anthony notes, "About 20% of [[Scythian]]-[[Sarmatian]] "warrior graves" on the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and lower [[Volga river|Volga]] contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress, a phenomenon that probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons."<ref name="anthonyd">{{cite book| last = Anthony| first = David W.| title = The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World| url = http://books.google.com/?id=mTxQmQEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 0-691-05887-3 }}</ref>

[[File:Amazone Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2342.jpg|thumb|Mounted Amazon in [[Scythia]]n costume, on an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure vase, ca 420 BCE]]
Up to 25% of military burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml Diotima<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Russian archaeologist [[Vera Kovalevskaya]] points out that when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-[[hegemony]] in the Near-East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Before modern archaeology uncovered some of the Scythian burials of warrior-maidens entombed under [[kurgan]]s in the region of [[Altai Mountains]] and Sarmatia,<ref>[http://www.archaeology.org/9701/abstracts/sarmatians.html "Warrior Women of Eurasia"], Archaeology Magazine (Abstract) Volume 50 Number 1, January/February 1997 Retrieved 7/10/08.</ref>
<ref>In a recent excavation of [[Sarmatian]] sites by Dr. Jeannine Davis-Kimball,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} a tomb was found wherein female warriors were buried.</ref> giving concrete form at last to the Greek tales, the origin of the Amazon story had been the subject of speculation among classics scholars. In the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] speculation ranged along the following lines:

{{quote|While some regard the Amazons as a purely mythical people, others assume an historical foundation for them. The deities worshipped by them were [[Ares]] (who is consistently assigned to them as a god of war, and as a god of [[Thrace|Thracian]] and generally northern origin) and [[Artemis]], not the usual Greek goddess of that name, but an Asiatic deity in some respects her equivalent. It is conjectured that the Amazons were originally the temple-servants and priestesses (''hierodulae'') of this goddess; and that the removal of the breast corresponded with the self-mutilation of the god [[Attis]] and the [[galli]], Roman priests of [[Cybele|Rhea Cybele]]. Another theory is that, as the knowledge of geography extended, travellers brought back reports of tribes ruled entirely by women, who carried out the duties which elsewhere were regarded as peculiar to man, in whom alone the rights of nobility and inheritance were vested, and who had the supreme control of affairs. Hence arose the belief in the Amazons as a nation of female warriors, organized and governed entirely by women. According to J. Viirtheim (''De Ajacis'' origine, 1907), the Amazons were of Greek origin [...] It has been suggested that the fact of the conquest of the Amazons being assigned to the two famous heroes of Greek mythology, Heracles and Theseus [...] shows that they were mythical illustrations of the dangers which beset the Greeks on the coasts of Asia Minor; rather perhaps, it may be intended to represent the conflict between the Greek culture of the colonies on the [[Black Sea|Euxine]] and the barbarism of the native inhabitants.}}
[[File:Deruet-Departure of the Amazons-1620.jpg|thumb|400px|''Departure of the Amazons'', by [[Claude Deruet]], 1620.]]

===Minoan Crete===
When Minoan archeology was still in its infancy, nevertheless, a theory raised in an essay regarding the Amazons contributed by [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] and [[John Myres]] to [[Robert Ranulph Marett]]'s ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1908),<ref>L.R. Farnell and J.L. Myres, "Herodotus and anthropology" in [[Robert Ranulph Marett|Robert R. Marett]] ''Anthropology and the Classics'' 1908, pp. 138ff.</ref> placed their possible origins in [[Minoan civilization]], drawing attention to overlooked similarities between the two cultures. According to Myres, (pp.&nbsp;153 ff), the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed Amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] culture. <!--The following is a "hard sell" for an outdated idea: "The theory that the Amazons originally represented Minoan Crete's women has a strong case based on what [[archeologists]] and historians have been discovering about Minoan culture. Out of all the ancient civilizations which are so far known to archaeologists and historians the Minoans seem to fit most of the aspects that classical Greeks and later scholars have come to associate with the Amazonian culture."-->

== Modern legacy ==

In [[Ukraine]] Katerina Tarnovska leads a group called the [[Asgarda]] which claims to be a new tribe of Amazons.<ref name="pri.org">http://www.pri.org/stories/politics-society/social-justice/ukraine%E2%80%99s-asgarda-martial-arts-program-recasts-amazon-warrior-women-13825.html</ref> Tarnovska believes that the Amazons are the direct ancestors of Ukrainian women, and she has created an all-female martial art for her group, based on another form of fighting called “[[Fighting Hopak]],” but with a special emphasis on self-defense.<ref name="pri.org"/> French photographer [[Guillaume Herbaut]] lived with the Asgarda and photographed them in 2004.<ref>http://jezebel.com/5366963/photographer-captures-ukrainian-amazons</ref> As of 2009, the group consists of 150 women.<ref>http://www.planet-mag.com/?s=asgarda</ref>

The city of [[Samsun]] in modern-day [[Turkey]] features a recently constructed "[[Amazon Village]]" museum, created to bring attention to the legacy of the Amazons and to generate both academic interest and popular tourism.<ref name="todayszaman">http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&link=212625</ref> An iconic statue of the museum is the prominent figure of a fierce female warrior, flanked by two buildings designed to look like lions.

A festival is held every year in the [[Terme]] district of [[Samsun Province]] to celebrate the Amazons.<ref name="todayszaman" />
