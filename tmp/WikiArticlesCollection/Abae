'''Abae''' ({{lang-grc|Ἄβαι}}, '''Abai''') is an ancient town in the northeastern corner of [[Phocis]], in [[Greece]]. It was famous in antiquity for its [[oracle]] of [[Apollo]] [[Abaeus]],<ref name="DGRBM">Schmitz, Leonhard (1867)</ref> one of those consulted by [[Croesus]], king of [[Lydia]],<ref name = Her>Herodotus (1920); p. 53</ref><ref>Hesychius; Schmidt, Moritz (1867)</ref><ref name = PausX>Pausanias (1898); pp. 554-555</ref> and [[Mardonius]], among others.<ref>Bell, Robert E. (1989)</ref>

==History==
It was rich in treasures,<ref>Herodotus (2003) p. 33</ref> but was destroyed by the [[Persia]]ns in the invasion of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] in 480 BCE, and a second time by the [[Boeotia]]ns and remained in a ruined state.It was rebuilt by [[Hadrian]].<ref>Smith, William (2011)</ref>

The oracle was, however, still consulted, e.g. by the [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebans]] before [[Leuctra]] in 371 BCE.<ref>Pausanias iv. 32.5</ref> The temple seems to have been burnt again during the [[Third Sacred War]] (355–346 BCE), and was in a very dilapidated state when seen by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the 2nd century CE,<ref name = PausX/> though some restoration, as well as the building of a new temple, was undertaken by Emperor [[Hadrian]].<ref name=EB>Hoiberg, Dale H. (2010)</ref>

The sanctity of the shrine ensured certain privileges to the people of Abae,<ref>Bilco, J. (1882)</ref> and these were confirmed by the Romans.

Among the most exciting recent archaeological discoveries in Greece is the recognition that the sanctuary site near the modern village of [[Kalapodi]] is not only the site of the oracle of Apollon at Abai but that it was in constant use for cult practices from early [[Helladic period|Mycenaean]] times to the Roman period. It is thus the first site where the archaeology confirms the continuity of Mycenaean and Classical Greek religion, which has been inferred from the presence of the names of Classical Greek divinities on [[Linear B]] texts from [[Pylos]] and [[Knossos]].{{refn | group = nb |See reports of the excavations of the German Archaeological Institute in Archaeological Reports for 2008/9 43-45, Archaeological Reports for 2007/8 47-49, Archaeological Reports for 2006/7 41-43, Archaeological Reports for 2005/6 68-69, Archaeological Reports for 2004/5 55-56.}}

The fortified site described below, originally identified as Abae by Colonel [[William Leake]] in the 19th century, is much more likely to be that of the Sanctuary of Artemis at [[Hyampolis]].   

The [[polygonal]] walls of the acropolis may still be seen in a fair state of preservation on a circular hill standing about {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the little plain of [[Exarcho]]; one gateway remains, and there are also traces of town walls below. The temple site was on a low spur of the hill, below the town. An early terrace wall supports a precinct in which are a [[stoa]] and some remains of temples; these were excavated by the [[British School at Athens]] in 1894, but little was found.
