The '''Central Artery/Tunnel Project''' ('''CA/T'''), known unofficially as the '''Big Dig''', was a [[megaproject]] in [[Boston]] that rerouted the [[Central Artery]] ([[Interstate 93]]), the chief [[highway]] through the heart of the city, into a 3.5-mile (5.6-km) tunnel. The project also included the construction of the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]] (extending [[Interstate 90]] to [[Logan International Airport]]), the [[Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Charles River]], and the [[Rose Kennedy Greenway]] in the space vacated by the previous I-93 elevated roadway. Initially, the plan was also to include a [[North–South Rail Link|rail connection]] between Boston's two major train terminals. The official planning phase started in 1982; the construction work was done between 1991 and 2006; and the project concluded on December 31, 2007, when the partnership between the program manager and the [[Massachusetts Turnpike Authority]] ended.<ref name="enddate">{{Cite news|first=Steve |last=LeBlanc |title=On December 31, It's Official: Boston's Big Dig Will Be Done |work=The Washington Post |date=2007-12-26 |accessdate=2007-12-26 |url=http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/25/AR2007122500600.html?nav=hcmoduletmv }}</ref>

==Background==

===Origin===
[[Image:OnBostonsElevatedCentralArtery.agr.jpg|thumb|right|Traffic on the old, elevated Central Artery at mid-day.]]
This project was developed in response to traffic congestion on Boston's historically tangled streets, which were laid out long before the advent of the [[automobile]]. As early as 1930, the city's Planning Board recommended a raised express highway running north-south through the downtown district, in order to draw traffic off the city streets.<ref>Daily Boston Globe, December 21, 1930 'Streets In The Air Only Solution To Boston's Traffic Problems So Says the Planning Board That Asks for Two-Level Road Across City, Costing $28,000,000, as First Item in a Big Scheme'</ref> Commissioner of Public Works [[William F. Callahan|William Callahan]] promoted plans for an elevated expressway, which eventually was constructed between the downtown area and the waterfront. Governor [[John Volpe]] interceded in the 1950s to change the design of the last section of the Central Artery, putting it  underground through the [[Dewey Square Tunnel]]. While traffic moved somewhat better, the other problems remained. There was chronic congestion on the Central Artery (I-93), an elevated six-lane highway through the center of downtown Boston, which was, in the words of Pete Sigmund, "like a funnel full of slowly-moving, or stopped, cars (and swearing motorists)."<ref name=autogenerated3>{{Cite news|first=Pete |last=Sigmund |url=http://cegltd.com/story.asp?story=8751&headline=Triumph,%20Tragedy%20Mark%20Boston%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Dig%20Project |title=Triumph, Tragedy Mark Boston's Big Dig Project |publisher=Construction Equipment Guide |date=2007-06-06 |accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref>
In 1959, the 1.5-mile-long (2.4&nbsp;km) road section carried approximately 75,000 vehicles a day, but by the 1990s, this had grown to 190,000 vehicles a day. Traffic jams of 16 hours were predicted for 2010.<ref name="MTA">{{Cite news|url=http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/bigdig/projectbkg.aspx |title=The Big Dig - Project Background |publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation |accessdate=2009-11-04}}{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref>

Designed and built before federal [[Interstate Highway standards]] were developed during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] administration, the expressway had tight turns, an excessive number of entrances and exits, entrance ramps without merge lanes, and as the decades passed, had continually escalating vehicular traffic that was well beyond its design capacity. Local businesses again wanted relief, and city leaders sought a reuniting of the waterfront with the city, and nearby residents desired removal of the matte green-painted elevated road, which mayor [[Thomas Menino]] called Boston's "other [[Green Monster]]".<ref>{{Cite news| agency=Associated Press | url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3769829 | title=Boston’s ‘Big Dig’ opens to public | publisher=MSNBC | date=December 20, 2003 | accessdate=2006-07-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060821233345/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3769829| archivedate= 21 August 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]] engineers Bill Reynolds and (eventual state Secretary of Transportation) [[Frederick P. Salvucci]] envisioned moving the whole expressway underground.

===Cancellation of the inner belt===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
[[Image:Boston CAT Project-construction view from air.jpeg|right|frame|[[Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge]] over the Charles River under construction, looking north. The old elevated Central Artery crossing is to the right.]]
Another important motivation for the Big Dig in its final form was the abandonment of the Massachusetts Department of Public Works' intended expressway system through and around Boston. The Central Artery, as part of Mass. DPW's Master Plan of 1948, was originally planned to be the downtown Boston stretch of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]], and was signed as such; a bypass road called the Inner Belt, was subsequently renamed  [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 695]]. (The law establishing the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956|Interstate highway system]] was enacted in 1956.)  The Inner Belt was to pass around the downtown core to the west, through the neighborhood of [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] and the cities of [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], and [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]]. Earlier controversies over impact of the Boston extension of the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], particularly on the heavily populated neighborhood of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], and the additional large amount of housing that would have had to be destroyed led to [[freeway and expressway revolts|massive community opposition]] to both the Inner Belt and the Boston section of I-95.

Building demolition and land clearances for I-95 through the neighborhoods of Roxbury, [[Jamaica Plain]], and [[Roslindale]] led to secession threats by [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]], Boston's youngest and southernmost neighborhood. By 1972, with only a minimum of work done on the I-95 right of way and none on the potentially massively disruptive Inner Belt, Governor [[Francis Sargent]] put a moratorium on highway construction within the [[Massachusetts Route 128|MA-128]] corridor, except for a short stretch of Interstate 93. In 1974, the remainder of the Master Plan was canceled, leaving Boston with a severely overstressed expressway system for the existing traffic.

With ever-increasing traffic volumes funneled onto I-93 alone, the Central Artery became chronically gridlocked. The Sargent moratorium led to the rerouting of I-95 away from Boston around the MA-128 beltway and the conversion of the cleared land in the southern part of the city into the Southwest Corridor linear park, as well as a new right-of-way for the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] subway and [[Amtrak]]. Parts of the planned I-695 right-of-way remain unused and under consideration for future mass-transit projects.

The original 1948 Master Plan included a Third Harbor Tunnel plan that was hugely controversial in its own right, because it would have disrupted the [[Maverick Square]] area of [[East Boston]]. It was never built.

===Mixing of traffic===
A major reason for the all-day congestion was that the Central Artery carried not only north&ndash;south traffic, but much east&ndash;west traffic as well. Boston's Logan Airport lies across [[Boston Harbor]] in East Boston, and before the Big Dig the only access from downtown was through the paired [[Callahan Tunnel|Callahan]] and [[Sumner Tunnel|Sumner]] tunnels. Traffic on the major highways from west of Boston&mdash;the Massachusetts Turnpike and [[Storrow Drive]]&mdash;mostly traveled on portions of the Central Artery to reach these tunnels. Getting between the Central Artery and the tunnels involved short diversions onto city streets, increasing local congestion.

The final Big Dig plan, then, combined several projects&mdash;the depression and improvement of the Central Artery, the construction of a third Harbor tunnel (now known as the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]]), and massive interchange improvements to the Massachusetts Turnpike and several other major routes in the area. While only one net lane in each direction was added to the north&ndash;south I-93, several new east&ndash;west lanes were added to untangle the traffic. East&ndash;west traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike now proceeds directly through the Ted Williams Tunnel to Logan Airport and Route 1A beyond, with new exits in South Boston along the way. Traffic between Storrow Drive and the Callahan and Sumner Tunnels uses a short portion of I-93, but additional lanes and direct connections are provided for this traffic.

===Mass transit===
A number of [[public transportation]] projects were included as part of an [[environmental mitigation]] for the Big Dig. The most expensive was the building of the Phase II [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] tunnel under [[Fort Point Channel]], done in coordination with Big Dig construction. Silver Line buses now use this tunnel and the Ted Williams Tunnel to link [[South Station]] and Logan Airport.

{{As of|2013}}, promised projects to extend the Green Line beyond [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]], to connect the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red]] and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue]] subway lines, and to restore the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] streetcar service to the [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Arborway]] in [[Jamaica Plain]] have not been completed. The [[Green Line Extension|extension beyond Lechmere]] is in currently under construction<ref>[http://www.greenlineextension.org/ Green Line Extension Project]</ref> and the Red and Blue subway line connection is being designed,<ref>[http://www.eot.state.ma.us/redblue/ Red Line / Blue Line Connector]</ref> although no funding has been designated for the latter project. The status of the Arborway Line is unclear,<ref>[http://www.arborway.org/ The Arborway Committee]</ref> but engineering studies have not been funded.

Yet another plan, the [[North-South Rail Link]] that would have connected North and South Stations (the major passenger train stations in Boston), was part of the original Big Dig but was ultimately dropped by the [[Michael Dukakis|Dukakis]] administration as an impediment to acquiring federal funding for the project.

==Early planning==
The project was conceived in the 1970s by the [[Boston Transportation Planning Review]] to replace the rusting elevated six-lane Central Artery. The expressway separated downtown from the waterfront, and was increasingly choked with bumper-to-bumper traffic. Business leaders were more concerned about access to [[Logan Airport]], and pushed instead for a third harbor tunnel. In their second terms, [[Michael Dukakis]] (governor) and [[Fred Salvucci]] (secretary of transportation) came up with the strategy of tying the two projects together&mdash;thereby combining the project that the business community supported with the project that they and the City of Boston supported.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Planning for the Big Dig as a project officially began in 1982, with environmental impact studies starting in 1983. After years of extensive lobbying for federal dollars, a 1987 public works bill appropriating funding for the Big Dig was passed by [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], but it was vetoed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] for being too expensive. When Congress [[Veto override|overrode]] the veto, the project had its green light and ground was first broken in 1991.<ref>Dan McNichol and Andy Ryan, ''The Big Dig''. Silver Lining Press, 1991</ref>

In 1997, the state legislature created the Metropolitan Highway System and transferred responsibility for the Central Artery and Tunnel "CA/T" Project from the Massachusetts Highway Department and the Massachusetts Governor's Office to the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MTA).<ref>{{cite news |title=Cerasoli charges Big Dig coverup |first=Thomas C. |last=Palmer Jr. |authorlink2= |url=http://www.boston.com/globe/metro/packages/bechtel/archives/032101.htm |newspaper=Boston Globe |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |id= |date=March 21, 2001 |at= |accessdate=September 3, 2011 |trans_title= |quote=Big Dig managers in the William F.

The MTA, which had little experience in managing an undertaking of the scope and magnitude of the CA/T Project, hired a joint venture to provide preliminary designs, manage design consultants and construction contractors, track the project's cost and schedule, advise MTA on project decisions, and (in some instances) act as the MTA's representative. Eventually, MTA combined some of its employees with joint venture employees in an integrated project organization. This was intended to make management more efficient, but it hindered MTA's ability to independently oversee project activities because MTA and the joint venture had effectively become partners in the project.<ref>OIG Testimony CC-2005-027, "Impact of Water Leaks on the Central Artery/Tunnel Project and Remaining Risks"</ref>

==Obstacles==
In addition to political and financial difficulties, the project faced several environmental and engineering obstacles.
The downtown area through which the tunnels were to be dug was largely [[Land reclamation|landfill]], and included existing [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]]  [[rapid transit|subway]] tunnels as well as innumerable pipes and utility lines that would have to be replaced or moved. Tunnel workers encountered many unexpected geological and archaeological barriers, ranging from glacial debris to foundations of buried houses and a number of sunken ships lying within the reclaimed land.

The project received approval from state environmental agencies in 1991, after satisfying concerns including release of toxins by the excavation and the possibility of disrupting the homes of millions of [[rat]]s, causing them to roam the streets of Boston in search of new housing. By the time the federal environmental clearances were delivered in 1994,<ref name="Palmer">{{Cite news| first=Thomas | last=Palmer | url=http://libraries.mit.edu/rotch/artery/boston_globe.htm#wins | title=State Wins Federal OK to Start River-Crossing Part of Artery Project | work=Boston Globe | date=1994-06-21 | accessdate=2007-12-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071105064639/http://libraries.mit.edu/rotch/artery/boston_globe.htm#wins <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-11-05}}{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref> the process had taken some seven years, during which time inflation greatly increased the project's original cost estimates.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Reworking such a busy corridor without seriously restricting traffic flow required a number of state-of-the-art construction techniques. Because the old elevated highway (which remained in operation throughout the construction process) rested on pylons located throughout the designated dig area, engineers first utilized [[slurry wall]] techniques to create {{convert|120|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} concrete walls upon which the highway could rest. These concrete walls also stabilized the sides of the site, preventing cave-ins during the continued excavation process.

The multi-lane interstate highway lanes also had to pass under [[South Station (MBTA)|South Station]]'s seven railway tracks, which carried over 40,000 commuters and 400 trains per day. To avoid multiple relocations of train lines while the tunneling advanced, as had been initially planned, a specially designed [[jack (device)|jack]] was constructed to support the ground and tracks to allow the excavation to take place below. Construction crews also used [[ground freezing]] (an artificial induction of [[permafrost]]) to help stabilize surrounding ground as they excavated the tunnel. This was the largest tunneling project undertaken beneath railway lines anywhere in the world. The ground freezing enabled safer, more efficient [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]], and also assisted in environmental issues, as less contaminated fill needed to be exported than if a traditional [[Cut-and-cover tunnel|cut-and-cover method]] had been applied.<ref>[http://tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=region&amp;id=3418 Boston Central Artery Jacked Tunnels - Mott MacDonald Project Page]</ref>

Other challenges included existing subway tunnels crossing the path of the underground highway. To build slurry walls past these tunnels, it was necessary to dig beneath the tunnels and to build an underground concrete bridge to support the tunnels' weight, without interrupting rail service.

==Construction phase==
[[Image:Boston-big-dig-area.png|thumb|Construction sites of the "Big Dig"]]

The project was managed by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, with the Big Dig and the Turnpike's Boston Extension from the 1960s being financially and legally joined by the legislature as the [[Metropolitan Highway System]].<ref>[http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/81a-3.htm MGL Chapter 81A, Section 3.]</ref> Design and construction was supervised by a joint venture of [[Bechtel Corporation]] and [[Parsons Brinckerhoff]]. Because of the enormous size of the project&mdash;too large for any company to undertake alone&mdash;the design and construction of the Big Dig was broken up into dozens of smaller subprojects with well-defined interfaces between contractors. Major heavy-construction contractors on the project included [[Jay Cashman]], [[Modern Continental]], [[Obayashi Corporation]], [[Perini Building Company|Perini Corporation]], [[Peter Kiewit Sons' Incorporated]], [[J.F. White]], and the Slattery division of [[Skanska]] USA. (Of those, Modern Continental was awarded the greatest gross value of contracts, joint ventures included.)

The nature of the [[Charles River]] crossing had been a source of major controversy throughout the design phase of the project. Many environmental advocates preferred a river crossing entirely in tunnels, but this, along with 27 other plans, was rejected as too costly. Finally, with a deadline looming to begin construction on a separate project that would connect the [[Tobin Bridge]] to the Charles River crossing, Salvucci overrode the objections and chose a variant of the plan known as "Scheme Z". This plan was considered to be reasonably cost-effective, but had the drawback of requiring highway ramps stacked up as high as {{convert|100|ft|m}} immediately adjacent to the Charles River.<ref name="bg-scheme z">{{Cite news|title=Caution: High bridge ahead; Artery plan includes an awful scheme for a great wall across the Charles|last=Campbell|first=Robert|date=June 24, 1990|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=2009-08-04|quote=The grotesque monstrosity that will be the new Central Artery requires a certain power of imagination to be grasped. Maybe that's why people are only now beginning to get upset about it.}}</ref>

The city of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] objected to the visual impact of the chosen Charles River crossing design. It sued to revoke the project's environmental certificate and forced the project to redesign the river crossing again.<ref name="bg-cambridge">{{Cite news|title=Cambridge sues to halt bridge plan|last=Palmer Jr|first=Thomas C.|date=March 12, 1995|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref>

[[Image:ZakimBridge20040307.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Leonard P. Zakim Bridge]]
Swiss engineer [[Christian Menn]] took over the design of the bridge. He suggested a cradle [[cable-stayed bridge]] that would carry ten lanes of traffic. The plan was accepted and construction began on the [[Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge]]. The bridge employed an asymmetrical design and a hybrid of steel and concrete was used to construct it. The distinctive bridge is supported by two forked towers connected to the span by cables and girders. It was the first bridge in the country to employ this method and it is the widest cable-stayed bridge in the world.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite news| first=Pete | last=Sigmund | url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=8751&headline=Triumph,%20Tragedy%20Mark%20Boston%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Dig%20Project | title=Triumph, Tragedy Mark Boston's Big Dig Project | publisher=Construction Equipment Guide |date=2007-06-06 |accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref>

Meanwhile, construction continued on the Tobin Bridge approach. By the time all parties agreed on the I-93 design, construction of the Tobin connector (today known as the "City Square Tunnel" for a [[Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] area it bypasses) was far along, significantly adding to the cost of constructing the [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. 1]] interchange and retrofitting the tunnel. <!--Shift to active voice shortened this sentence a little, but it's still unclear whether the Rt1 work and tunnel retrofit were built, or were abandoned because of the increased cost.-->

Boston blue [[clay]] and other soils extracted from the path of the tunnel were used to cap many local [[landfill]]s, fill in the [[Quincy Quarries Reservation|Granite Rail Quarry]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], and restore the surface of [[Spectacle Island (Massachusetts)|Spectacle Island]] in the [[Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area]].

The [[Storrow Drive Connector]], a companion bridge to the Zakim, began carrying traffic from I-93 to [[Storrow Drive]] in 1999. The project had been under consideration for years, but was opposed by the wealthy residents of the [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood. However, it finally was accepted because it would funnel traffic bound for Storrow Drive and downtown Boston away from the mainline roadway.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bostonroads.com/crossings/zakim/ | title=Leonard P. Zakim-Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge | accessdate=2006-07-18 | publisher=BostonRoads.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060626115922/http://www.bostonroads.com/crossings/zakim/| archivedate= 26 June 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The Connector ultimately used a pair of ramps that had been constructed for [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 695]], enabling the mainline I-93 to carry more traffic that would have used I-695 under the original Master Plan.

When construction began, the project cost, including the Charles River crossing, was estimated at $5.8 billion. Eventual [[cost overruns]] were so high that the chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, [[James Kerasiotes]], was fired in 2000. His replacement had to commit to an $8.55 billion cap on federal contributions. The total expenses eventually passed $15 billion. Interest brought this cost to $21.93 billion.

===Engineering methods and details===
[[Image:BigDigSupportsCentralArtery.agr.jpg|thumb|left|Temporary supports hold up elevated Central Artery during construction.]]
Several unusual engineering challenges arose during the project, requiring unusual solutions and methods to address them.

At the beginning of the project, engineers had to figure out the safest way to build the tunnel without endangering the existing elevated highway above. Eventually, they created horizontal braces as wide as the tunnel, then cut away the elevated highway's struts, and lowered it onto the new braces.<ref name="AP 122507">{{Cite news |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071225/ap_on_re_us/big_dig_the_end |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228035119/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071225/ap_on_re_us/big_dig_the_end |archivedate=2007-12-28 |title=Boston's $14.8B Big Dig finally complete |first=Steve |last=LeBlanc |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 25, 2007}}</ref>

==Final phases==
[[Image:Tunnel-large.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Interstate 93 Tunnel]]

On January 17, 2002, the opening ceremony was held for the I-90 Connector Tunnel, extending the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90) east into the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]], and onwards to Boston [[Logan International Airport]]. The Ted Williams tunnel had been completed and was in limited use for commercial traffic and [[high-occupancy vehicle]]s since late 1995. The westbound lanes opened on the afternoon of January 18 and the eastbound lanes on January 19.

The next phase, moving the elevated Interstate 93 underground, was completed in two stages: northbound lanes opened in March 2003 and southbound lanes (in a temporary configuration) on December 20, 2003. A tunnel underneath [[Leverett Circle]] connecting eastbound Storrow Drive to I-93 North and the Tobin Bridge opened December 19, 2004, easing congestion at the circle. All southbound lanes of I-93 opened to traffic on March 5, 2005, including the left lane of the Zakim Bridge, and all of the refurbished [[Dewey Square Tunnel]].

By the end of December 2004, 95% of the Big Dig was completed. Major construction remained on the surface, including construction of final ramp configurations in the [[North End, Boston, Massachusetts|North End]] and in the [[South Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|South Bay]] interchange, and reconstruction of the surface streets.

The final ramp downtown &mdash; exit 20B from [[Interstate 93|I-93]] south to [[Albany Street (Boston)|Albany Street]] &mdash; opened January 13, 2006.<ref>{{Cite news| first=Casey | last=Ross | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/969503741.html?dids=969503741:969503741&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jan+14%2C+2006&author=CASEY+ROSS&pub=Boston+Herald&edition=&startpage=009&desc=Hallelujah+Hub+drivers!+Last+Big+Dig+ramp+done | title=Hallelujah Hub drivers!

In 2006, the two Interstate 93 tunnels were dedicated as the [[Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel]], after the former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] speaker of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from Massachusetts who pushed to have the Big Dig funded by the federal government.

==Mitigation projects==

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}} <!-- What are the non-MBTA mitigation requirements that haven't been met? -->

{{For|more information about the public transit mitigation projects|Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority}}

Many environmental impact mitigation projects (transit, pedestrian, bicycle, and parks) also remain. Although these were legal requirements for approval of the environmental impact statement, many{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} are not funded because of the massive cost overruns on the highway portion of the project. For example, though the [[North Point Park (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|North Point Park]] was created as part of the project, it ended without constructing pedestrian bridges to neighboring parks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}  Also, many [[MBTA]] projects such as the restoration of Green Line "E" Arborway service, and the proposed Green Line Extension to [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], have not been completed.

===Public art===
While not a legally mandated requirement, [[public art]] was part of the urban design planning process (and later design development work) through the Artery Arts Program. The intent of the program was to integrate public art into highway infrastructure (retaining walls, fences, and lighting) and the essential elements of the pedestrian environment (walkways, park landscape elements, and bridges). As overall project costs increased, the Artery Arts Program was seen as a potential liability, even though there was support and interest from the public and professional arts organizations in the area.

At the beginning of the highway design process, a temporary arts program was initiated and over 50 proposals were selected. However, development began on only a few projects before funding for the program was cut. Permanent public art that was funded includes: super graphic text and facades of former [[West End, Boston|West End]] houses cast into the concrete elevated highway abutment support walls near [[North Station]] by artist [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]]; a historical sculpture about the 18th and 19th century shipbuilding industry and a bust of shipbuilder [[Donald McKay]] in [[East Boston]]; blue interior lighting of the Zakim Bridge; and the [[Millers River (Middlesex)|Miller's River]] Littoral Way walkway and lighting under the loop ramps north of the [[Charles River]].

Extensive landscape planting, as well as a maintenance program to support the plantings, was requested by many community members during public meetings. <!-- need more details on landscape program here -->

==Impact on traffic==
[[Image:ONeilltoZakimBridge.agr.jpg|thumb|Traffic exiting the Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel onto the Zakim Bridge.]]
Before the Big Dig, the Central Artery carried not only north&ndash;south traffic but much east&ndash;west traffic, a major cause of its all-day congestion. The only direct access to Boston's Logan Airport from downtown was through the paired [[Callahan Tunnel|Callahan]] and [[Sumner Tunnel|Sumner]] tunnels under [[Boston Harbor]]. To reach these tunnels, traffic on the major highways from west of Boston&mdash;the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] and Storrow Drive&mdash;traveled on portions of the Central Artery. Getting between the Central Artery and the tunnels also involved short stretches on city streets, increasing local congestion and causing backups on the highway.

The Big Dig untangled this co-mingled traffic. While only one net lane in each direction was added to the north&ndash;south I-93, several new east&ndash;west lanes became available. East&ndash;west traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike/I-90 now proceeds directly through the Ted Williams Tunnel to Logan Airport and Route 1A beyond. Traffic between Storrow Drive and the Callahan and Sumner Tunnels still uses a short portion of I-93, but additional lanes and direct connections are provided for this traffic.

The result was a 62% reduction in vehicle hours of travel on I-93, the airport tunnels, and the connection from Storrow Drive, from an average 38,200 hours per day before construction (1994–1995) to 14,800 hours per day in 2004–2005, after the project was largely complete.<ref name=impactreport>[http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf]{{dead link|date=August 2013}} Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-6</ref>  The savings for travelers was estimated at $166 million annually in the same 2004–2005 time frame.<ref>[http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, p. 24]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref>  Travel times on the Central Artery northbound during the afternoon peak hour were reduced 85.6%.<ref>[http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-1]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref>

A 2008 ''Boston Globe'' report asserted that waiting time for the majority of trips actually increased as a result of [[induced demand|demand induced]] by the increased road capacity. Because more drivers were opting to use the new roads, traffic bottlenecks were only pushed outward from the city, not reduced or eliminated (although some trips are now faster). The report states, "Ultimately, many motorists going to and from the suburbs at peak rush hours are spending more time stuck in traffic, not less."  The ''Globe'' also asserted that their analysis provides a fuller picture of the traffic situation than a state-commissioned study done two years earlier, in which the Big Dig was credited with helping to save at least $167 million a year by increasing economic productivity and decreasing motor vehicle operating costs. That study did not look at highways outside the Big Dig construction area and did not take into account new congestion elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Murphy | first=Sean | date=2008-11-16 | title=Big Dig pushes bottlenecks outward | work=Boston Globe | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/11/16/big_dig_pushes_bottlenecks_outward/ | accessdate=2009-04-01| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090401210807/http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/11/16/big_dig_pushes_bottlenecks_outward/| archivedate= 1 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Operations Control Center (OCC)==
{{anchor|Operations Control Center (OCC)}}
{{expand section|date=April 2013}}

As part of the project, an elaborate Operations Control Center (OCC) [[control room]] was constructed in [[South Boston]]. Staffed on a "[[24/7/365]]" basis, this center monitors and reports on [[traffic congestion]], and responds to emergencies. Continuous [[video surveillance]] is provided by hundreds of cameras, and thousands of sensors monitor traffic speed and density, [[air quality]], water levels, temperatures, equipment status, and other conditions inside the tunnel. The OCC can activate emergency ventilation fans, change electronic display signs, and dispatch service crews when necessary.<ref name=RTT>{{cite web|title=Boston Big Dig, Central Artery / Tunnel Project, Massachusetts, United States of America|url=http://www.roadtraffic-technology.com/projects/big_dig/|work=roadtraffic-technology.com|publisher=Net Resources International|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=Rosenwald>{{cite web|last=Rosenwald|first=Mike|title=Fixing Boston's Horrible Jams|url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2003-09/fixing-bostons-horrible-jams|work=Popsci|publisher=Popular Science|accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=Lewis>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Raphael|title=The smart highway|url=http://cache.boston.com/traffic/bigdig/stories/032402_smart_highway.htm|accessdate=3 April 2013|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=24 March 2002}}</ref>

==Problems==
{{anchor|Problems}}

==="Thousands of leaks"===
As far back as 2001, Turnpike Authority officials and union contractors knew of thousands of leaks in ceiling and wall fissures, extensive water damage to steel supports and fireproofing systems, and overloaded drainage systems.<ref>[http://www.thebostonchannel.com/bigdig/3924866/detail.html Report: Even More Big Dig Leaks Found - Big Dig News Story - WCVB Boston<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref> A $10 million contract, signed off as a [[cost overrun]], was used to repair these leaks. Many of the leaks were a result of [[Modern Continental]] and other subcontractors failing to remove gravel and other debris before pouring concrete. This was not made publicly known to the media, but engineers at MIT (volunteer students and professors) performed several experiments and found serious problems with the tunnel.<ref name="evenmorebigleaks">{{Cite news| title=Report: Even More Big Dig Leaks Found | url=http://www.thebostonchannel.com/bigdig/3924866/detail.html | publisher=WCVB-TV | date=2004-11-17 | accessdate=2006-07-18}}{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref>

On September 15, 2004, a major leak in the [[Interstate 93]] north tunnel forced the closure of the tunnel while repairs were conducted. This also forced the Turnpike Authority to release information regarding its non-disclosure of prior leaks. A follow-up reported on "extensive" leaks that were more severe than state authorities had previously acknowledged. The report went on to state that the $14.6 billion tunnel system was riddled with more than 400 leaks. A ''[[Boston Globe]]'' report, however, countered that by stating there were nearly 700 leaks in a single {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} section of tunnel beneath [[South Station]]. Turnpike officials also stated that the number of leaks being investigated was down from 1,000 to 500.<ref name="evenmorebigleaks" />

The problem of leaks is further aggravated by the fact that many of them involve corrosive [[Seawater|salt water]]. This is caused by the proximity of [[Boston Harbor]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], causing a mix of salt and fresh water leaks in the tunnel. The situation is made worse by [[road salt]] spread in the tunnel to melt ice during freezing weather, or brought in by vehicles passing through.<ref name="54m-fix"/> Salt water and [[salt spray]] are well-known issues that must be dealt with in any [[marine environment]]. It has been reported that "hundreds of thousands of gallons of salt water are pumped out monthly" in the Big Dig, and a map has been prepared showing "hot spots" where water leakage is especially serious.<ref name="CorrosionGraphic"/> Salt-accelerated corrosion has caused ceiling light fixtures to fail (see below), but can also cause rapid deterioration of embedded [[rebar]] and other [[structural steel]] reinforcements holding the tunnel walls and ceiling in place.<ref name="54m-fix"/>

===Substandard materials===
{{update|section|date=December 2012|what happened after the arrests and charges}}

[[Massachusetts State Police]] searched the offices of [[Aggregate Industries]], the largest concrete supplier for the underground portions of the project, in June 2005. They seized evidence that Aggregate delivered concrete that did not meet contract specifications. In March 2006  Massachusetts Attorney General [[Thomas Reilly|Tom Reilly]] announced plans to sue project contractors and others because of poor work on the project. Over 200 complaints were filed by the state of Massachusetts as a result of leaks, cost overruns, quality concerns, and safety violations. In total, the state has sought approximately $100 million from the contractors ($1 for every $141 spent).<ref name="Reuters-StateWeighs">{{Cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/19/news/notes.php |title=State weighs suing 'Big Dig' contractors |work=International Herald Tribune |date=2006-03-20 |accessdate=2006-07-17| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060718094219/http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/19/news/notes.php| archivedate= 18 July 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> 

In May 2006, six employees of the company were arrested and charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. In July 2007, Aggregate Industries settled the case with an agreement to pay $50 million. $42 million of the settlement went to civil cases and $8 million was paid in criminal fines. The company will provide $75 million in insurance for maintenance as well as pay $500,000 toward routine checks on areas suspected to contain substandard concrete. <ref>[http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/east/2007/07/30/82122.htm Concrete Supplier to Pay $50 Million to Settle Big Dig Case<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Fatal ceiling collapse===
{{Main|Big Dig ceiling collapse}}

A fatal accident raised safety questions and closed part of the project for most of the summer of 2006. On July 10, 2006, a concrete ceiling panel weighing 3 tons (2722&nbsp;kg) and measuring {{convert|20|by|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} fell on a car traveling on the two-lane ramp connecting northbound I-93 to eastbound [[Interstate 90|I-90]] in [[South Boston]], killing Milena Del Valle, who was a passenger, and injuring her husband, Angel Del Valle, who was driving.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=8751&headline=Triumph,%20Tragedy%20Mark%20Boston%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Dig%20Project| publisher=Construction Equipment Guide | date=2007-06-06 | accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref> Immediately following the fatal ceiling collapse, Governor Mitt Romney ordered a stem-to-stern safety audit conducted by the Illinois engineering firm of [[Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc.]] to look for additional areas of risk.

==="Ginsu guardrails"===
Public safety workers have called the walkway safety handrails in the Big Dig tunnels "[[ginsu]] guardrails", because the squared-off edges of the support posts have caused mutilations and deaths of passengers ejected from crashed vehicles. After an eighth reported death involving the safety handrails, [[MassDOT]] officials announced plans to cover or remove the allegedly dangerous fixtures, but only near curves or exit ramps.<ref name=Carroll-Rails>{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Matt|title=State plans to remove many rails in tunnels|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-04-15/news/29422310_1_tunnel-rail-crashes-state-police|work=boston.com|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=2012-04-09|date=April 15, 2011}}{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref> This partial removal of hazards has been criticized by a safety specialist, who suggests that the handrails are just as dangerous in straight sections of the tunnel.<ref name="Carroll-Rails"/>

=== Lighting fixtures ===
In March 2011, it became known that senior MassDOT officials had failed to disclose an issue with the lighting fixtures in the O'Neill tunnel. In early February 2011, a maintenance crew found a fixture lying in the middle travel lane in the northbound tunnel.<ref name="Moskowitz-lights">{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Moskowitz |title=State says some light fixtures in Big Dig tunnels are flawed |url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-03-16/news/29350222_1_tunnels-fixtures-fluorescent-lights |work=Boston Globe |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=11 July 2011}}{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref> Assuming it to be simple road debris, the maintenance team picked it up and brought it back to its home facility.
