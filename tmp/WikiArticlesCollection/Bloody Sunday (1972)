==Narrative of events==
{{Main|Narrative of events of Bloody Sunday (1972)}}

The people planned on marching to the [[Guildhall, Derry|Guildhall]], but because of army barricades designed to reroute the march, the protesters redirected it to Free Derry Corner. A group of teenagers broke off from the march and persisted in pushing the barricade and marching on the Guildhall. They attacked the British army barricade with stones. At this point, a water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets were used to disperse the rioters. Such confrontations between soldiers and youths were common, and observers reported that the rioting was not intense.<ref>{{cite book | author=Peter Pringle & Philip Jacobson | title=Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They? | location=London | publisher=Fourth Estate | year=2000 | isbn=1-84115-316-8}} P. 100: "…the level of rioting was no greater than usual – and no petrol bombs or nail bombs were being thrown."</ref> Two civilians, Damien Donaghy and John Johnston, were shot and wounded  on William Street by soldiers, who claimed that the former was carrying a black cylindrical object.<ref>{{cite book | author=Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson | title=Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They? | location=London | publisher=Fourth Estate | year=2000 | isbn=1-84115-316-8}}P 116: "Seconds after the corporal fired, he would say that he spotted the same man with a black cylindrical object in one hand strike what appeared to be a match against the wall. Johnston was standing a few feet from Donaghy. One of the bullets sliced through his right thigh."</ref>

At a certain point, reports of an IRA sniper operating in the area were allegedly given to the Army command centre. At {{Nowrap|4:07&nbsp;pm}} Brigade gave the British Parachute Regiment permission to go into the Bogside. The order to fire live rounds was given,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} and one young man was shot and killed when he ran down Chamberlain Street away from the advancing troops. This first fatality, Jackie Duddy, was among a crowd who were running away. He was running alongside a priest, [[Bishop Edward Daly|Father Edward Daly]], when he was shot in the back.<ref name="CAINBS">{{cite web | title = 'Bloody Sunday', Derry 30&nbsp;January 1972 | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/circum.htm | publisher = [[CAIN]] | accessdate =16 May 2007}}</ref>  Eventually the order was given to mobilise the troops in an arrest operation, chasing the tail of the main group of marchers to the edge of the field by Free Derry Corner.

Despite a cease-fire order from the army HQ, over 100 rounds were fired directly into the fleeing crowds by troops under the command of Major [[Ted Loden]]. Twelve more were killed,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/bs.htm |title=CAIN: Events: Bloody Sunday: Menu Page |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> many of them as they attempted to aid the fallen.

==Perspectives and analyses on the day==
Thirteen people were shot and killed, with another man later dying of his wounds. The official army position, backed by the British [[Home Secretary]] the next day in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], was that the paratroopers had reacted to gun and nail bomb attacks from suspected IRA members. All eyewitnesses (apart from the soldiers), including marchers, local residents, and British and Irish journalists present, maintain that soldiers fired into an unarmed crowd, or were aiming at fleeing people and those tending the wounded, whereas the soldiers themselves were not fired upon. No British soldier was wounded by gunfire or reported any injuries, nor were any bullets or nail bombs recovered to back up their claims.

In the events that followed, irate crowds burned down the British embassy on [[Merrion Square]] in Dublin.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/2/newsid_2758000/2758163.stm 1972: British embassy in Dublin destroyed] BBC News Online.

Although there were many IRA men—both Official and Provisional—present at the protest, it is claimed they were all unarmed, apparently because it was anticipated that the paratroopers would attempt to "draw them out".<ref>{{cite news |title=Rumours of plan to clear Bogside are 'nonsense' |author=David Sharrock |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/03/30/nuls130.html |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20020627205642/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/03/30/nuls130.html |archivedate= 27 June 2002 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London  |date=30 March 2000 |accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref> March organiser and MP [[Ivan Cooper]] had been promised beforehand that no armed IRA men would be near the march.

The city's [[coroner]], retired British Army Major Hubert O'Neill, issued a statement on 21 August 1973, at the completion of the [[inquest]] into the people killed.<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/chron.htm 'Bloody Sunday', 30 January 1972 – A Chronology of Events] CAIN Web Service, 23 March 2006. Retrieved 27 August 2006.</ref> He declared:
{{cquote|This Sunday became known as Bloody Sunday and bloody it was. It was quite unnecessary. It strikes me that the Army ran amok that day and shot without thinking what they were doing. They were shooting innocent people. These people may have been taking part in a march that was banned but that does not justify the troops coming in and firing live rounds indiscriminately. I would say without hesitation that it was sheer, unadulterated murder. It was murder.}}

Two days after Bloody Sunday, the Westminster Parliament adopted a resolution for a [[tribunal]] into the events of the day, resulting in Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] commissioning the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], Lord Widgery to undertake it. Many witnesses intended to [[boycott]] the tribunal as they lacked faith in Widgery's impartiality, but were eventually persuaded to take part. Widgery's quickly produced report—completed within ten weeks (10 April) and published within eleven (19 April)—supported the Army's account of the events of the day. Among the evidence presented to the tribunal were the results of paraffin tests, used to identify lead residues from firing weapons, and that nail bombs had been found on the body of one of those killed. Tests for traces of explosives on the clothes of eleven of the dead proved negative, while those of the remaining man could not be tested as they had already been washed. Most Irish people and witnesses to the event disputed the report's conclusions and regarded it as a whitewash. It has been argued that firearms residue on some deceased may have come from contact with the soldiers who themselves moved some of the bodies, or that the presence of lead on the hands of one (James Wray) was easily explained by the fact that his occupation involved the use of lead-based [[solder]]. In fact, in 1992, [[John Major]], writing to John Hume stated:
{{cquote|The Government made clear in 1974 that those who were killed on 'Bloody Sunday' should be regarded as innocent of any allegation that they were shot whilst handling firearms or explosives. I hope that the families of those who died will accept that assurance.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Don Mullan]] |title=Eyewitness Bloody Sunday |location=Wolfhound |publisher=Printing Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-86327-586-9}}</ref>}}

Having witnessed the events firsthand, she was later infuriated that she was consistently denied the chance to speak in Parliament about the day, although parliamentary convention decreed that any MP witnessing an incident under discussion would be granted an opportunity to speak about it in the House.<ref>{{cite news |title = Daughters of Ireland |author = Ros Wynne-Jones |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970309/ai_n14092582/pg_2 |work=The Independent |location=UK |date = 9 March 1997 |accessdate =2 June 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In January 1997, the United Kingdom television station [[Channel 4]] carried a news report that suggested that members of the [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] had also opened fire on the protesters and could have been responsible for three of the fourteen deaths.

On 29 May 2007 it was reported that General Sir [[Mike Jackson]], [then Captain Mike Jackson] second-in-command of 1 Para on Bloody Sunday, said: "I have no doubt that innocent people were shot".<ref>{{cite news

==The Saville Inquiry==
{{Main|Bloody Sunday Inquiry}}
[[File:Guildhall, Derry, August 2010.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The city [[Guildhall, Derry|Guildhall]], home to the Inquiry]]
Although British Prime Minister John Major rejected John Hume's requests for a [[public inquiry]] into the killings, his successor, Tony Blair, decided to start one. A second commission of inquiry, chaired by Lord Saville, was established in January 1998 to re-examine Bloody Sunday. The other judges were [[John Toohey (judge)|John Toohey]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], a former [[Judge|Justice]] of the [[High Court of Australia]] who had worked on Aboriginal issues (he replaced New Zealander Sir [[Edward Somers]] QC, who retired from the Inquiry in 2000 for personal reasons), and Mr Justice [[William Lloyd Hoyt|William Hoyt]] QC, former [[Chief Justice]] of [[New Brunswick]] and a member of the [[Canadian Judicial Council]]. The hearings were concluded in November 2004, and the report was published 15 June 2010. The Saville Inquiry was a more comprehensive study than the Widgery Tribunal, interviewing a wide range of witnesses, including local residents, soldiers, journalists and politicians. Lord Saville declined to comment on the Widgery report and made the point that the Saville Inquiry was a judicial inquiry into Bloody Sunday, not the Widgery Tribunal.

Evidence given by [[Martin McGuinness]], a senior member of [[Sinn Féin]] and now the [[deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland]], to the inquiry stated that he was second-in-command of the Derry City brigade of the Provisional IRA and was present at the march. He did not answer questions about where he had been staying because he said it would compromise the safety of the individuals involved.

A claim was made at the Saville Inquiry that McGuinness was responsible for supplying detonators for nail bombs on Bloody Sunday. Paddy Ward claimed he was the leader of the [[Fianna Éireann]], the youth wing of the IRA in January 1972. He claimed that McGuinness, the second-in-command of the IRA in the city at the time, and another anonymous IRA member gave him bomb parts on the morning of 30 January, the date planned for the civil rights march. He said his organisation intended to attack city-centre premises in Derry on the day when civilians were shot dead by British soldiers. In response McGuinness rejected the claims as "fantasy", while Gerry O'Hara, a Sinn Féin councillor in Derry stated that he and not Ward was the Fianna leader at the time.<ref name="INNES"/>

Many observers allege that the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] acted in a way to impede the inquiry.<ref>{{cite news |title = Bloody Sunday footage release calls |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/2710309.stm |publisher=BBC News |date = 30 January 2003 |accessdate =18 May 2007}}</ref> Over 1,000 army photographs and original army helicopter video footage were never made available.

By the time the inquiry had retired to write up its findings, it had interviewed over 900 witnesses, over seven years, making it the biggest investigation in [[Law of the United Kingdom|British legal]] history.<ref name=Q&A/> The cost of this process has drawn criticism; as of the publication of the Saville Report being {{Nowrap|£195 million}}.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/10320609.stm|work=BBC News |title=Bloody Sunday Report Published. |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref>

The inquiry was expected to report in late 2009 but was delayed until after the general election on 6 May 2010.<ref name="general election">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/foyle_and_west/8606048.stm |title=Saville Bloody Sunday inquiry delayed until after poll |publisher=[[BBC|BBC News]] |date=6 April 2010 |accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref>

The report concluded that an Official IRA sniper fired on British soldiers, albeit that on the balance of evidence his shot was fired <i>after</i> the Army shots that wounded Damien Donaghey and John Johnston. The Inquiry rejected the sniper's account that this shot had been made in reprisal, stating the view that he and another Official IRA member had already been in position, and the shot had probably been fired simply because the opportunity had presented itself.<ref name=SavilleSnipers312>{{cite web |url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003/#the-report |title=Report of The Bloody Sunday Inquiry – Volume&nbsp;I – Chapter 3 |publisher=Bloody Sunday Inquiry |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010 }}</ref> Ultimately the Saville Inquiry was inconclusive on Martin McGuinness' role, due to a lack of certainty over his movements, concluding that while he was "engaged in paramilitary activity" during Bloody Sunday, and had probably been armed with a [[Thompson submachine gun]], there was insufficient evidence to make any finding other than they were "sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire".<ref name=SavilleMcGuinness3119>{{cite web|url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003/#the-report |title=Report of The Bloody Sunday Inquiry – Volume&nbsp;I – Chapter 3 |publisher=Bloody Sunday Inquiry |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010 |quote=3.119 In the course of investigating the activities of the Provisional and Official IRA on the day, we considered at some length allegations that Martin McGuinness, at that time the Adjutant of the Derry Brigade or Command of the Provisional IRA, had engaged in paramilitary activity during the day. In the end we were left in some doubt as to his movements on the day. Before the soldiers of Support Company went into the Bogside he was probably armed with a Thompson sub-machine gun, and though it is possible that he fired this weapon, there is insufficient evidence to make any finding on this, save that we are sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire.}}</ref>

Regarding the soldiers in charge on the day of Bloody Sunday, Saville found: Lieutenant Colonel [[Derek Wilford]] was commander of 1 Para and on the day was directly responsible for arresting rioters and returning to base. However, Wilford 'deliberately disobeyed' his superior Brigadier [Patrick] MacLellan's orders by sending Support Company into the Bogside [and without informing MacLellan].<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> Brigadier Patrick MacLellan was operational commander of the day. The Saville Inquiry cleared MacLellan of any wrongdoing as he was under the impression that Wilford would follow orders by arresting rioters and then returning to base, and could not be blamed for Wilford's actions.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> Major General [[Robert Ford (British Army officer)|Robert Ford]] was Commander of land forces and set the British strategy to oversee the civil march in Derry. Although Saville cleared Ford of any fault, he found Ford's selection of 1 Para, and in particular Wilford to be in control of arresting rioters, to be disconcerting, specifically as "1 PARA was a force with a reputation for using excessive physical violence, which thus ran the risk of exacerbating the tensions between the Army and nationalists".<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> Major Ted Loden was the commander in charge of soldiers, following orders issued by Lieutenant Colonel Wilford. Saville cleared Loden of misconduct, citing that Loden "neither realised nor should have realised that his soldiers were or might be firing at people who were not posing or about to pose a threat".<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> In short, the inquiry found that Loden could not be held responsible for claims (whether malicious or not) by some of the individual soldiers that they had received fire from snipers. Captain [[Mike Jackson]] [later General Sir Mike Jackson] was second in command of 1 Para on the day of Bloody Sunday. Saville cleared Jackson of sinister actions following Jackson's compiling of a list of what soldiers told Major Loden on why they had fired. This list became known as the "Loden List of Engagements" which played a role in the Army's initial explanations. While Saville found the compiling of the list was 'far from ideal', he accepted Jackson's explanations based on the list not containing the names of soldiers and the number of times they fired.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> Saville had concluded that Lance Corporal F was responsible for a number of the deaths and that a number of soldiers have "knowingly put forward false accounts in order to seek to justify their firing".<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> Intelligence officer Colonel Maurice Tugwell and [[Colin Wallace]], (an IPU army press officer) were also both cleared of wrongdoing. Saville believed that the information Tugwell and Wallace released through the media was not down to any deliberate attempt to deceive the public but rather due to much of the inaccurate information Tugwell had received at the time by various other figures.<ref>Britain's propaganda war during the Troubles, BBC, http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/8577087.stm</ref> Major Michael Steele was with MacLellan in the operations room and was in charge of passing on the orders on the day. Saville accepted that Steele could not believe other than that a separation had been achieved between rioters and marchers, because both groups were in different areas.<ref>Major gives Bloody Sunday evidence, BBC News, http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/2521517.stm</ref>

Reporting on the findings of the Saville Inquiry in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] said:

“Mr Speaker, I am deeply patriotic. I never want to believe anything bad about our country. I never want to call into question the behaviour of our soldiers and our army, who I believe to be the finest in the world. And I have seen for myself the very difficult and dangerous circumstances in which we ask our soldiers to serve. But the conclusions of this report are absolutely clear. There is no doubt, there is nothing equivocal, there are no ambiguities. What happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable. It was wrong."<ref>Bloody Sunday: PM David Cameron's full statement, BBC News, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10322295</ref>

==Impact on Northern Ireland divisions==
[[File:Bloody Sunday memorial.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bloody Sunday memorial in the Bogside]]
[[Harold Wilson]], then the [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the House of Commons, reiterated his belief that a [[united Ireland]] was the only possible solution to Northern Ireland's Troubles. [[William Craig (politician)|William Craig]], then Stormont Home Affairs Minister, suggested that the west bank of Derry should be ceded to the Republic of Ireland.

When it was deployed on duty in Northern Ireland, the British Army was welcomed by Roman Catholics as a neutral force there to protect them from Protestant mobs, the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) and the [[Ulster Special Constabulary|B-Specials]].<ref>This "Honeymoon period", as it has come to be known, ended around the time of the [[Falls Road Curfew]] on 3 July 1970. See CAIN for details here [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch70.htm]. The 'B-Specials' were disbanded and replaced by the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR) on 1 April 1970.</ref> After Bloody Sunday many Catholics turned on the British army, seeing it no longer as their protector but as their enemy. Young [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]] became increasingly attracted to violent [[Irish republicanism|republican]] groups. With the Official IRA and [[Official Sinn Féin]] having moved away from mainstream Irish republicanism towards [[Marxism]], the Provisional IRA began to win the support of newly radicalised, disaffected young people.

In the following twenty years, the Provisional Irish Republican Army and other smaller republican groups such as the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) mounted an [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997|armed campaign]] against the British, by which they meant the RUC, the British Army, the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR) of the British Army (and, according to their critics, the Protestant and [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] establishment). With rival paramilitary organisations appearing in both the nationalist/republican and [[Unionism in Ireland|Irish unionist]]/[[Ulster loyalist]] communities (the [[Ulster Defence Association]], [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF), etc. on the loyalist side), the Troubles cost the lives of thousands of people. Incidents included the killing of three members of a pop band, the [[Miami Showband killings|Miami Showband]], by a gang including members of the UVF who were also members of the local army regiment, the UDR, and in uniform at the time,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/15/newsid_2534000/2534941.stm 1976: UDR men jailed for Showband killings].</ref> and the killing by the Provisionals of eighteen members of the Parachute Regiment in the [[Warrenpoint Ambush]]-seen by some as revenge for Bloody Sunday.

With the official cessation of violence by some of the major paramilitary organisations and the creation of the power-sharing executive at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]] in [[Belfast]] under the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]], the Saville Inquiry's re-examination of the events of that day is widely hoped to provide a thorough account of the events of Bloody Sunday.

In his speech to the House of Commons on the Inquiry, British Prime Minister David Cameron stated: "These are shocking conclusions to read and shocking words to have to say. But you do not defend the British Army by defending the indefensible."<ref>{{cite news |author=''RTÉ News'' |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0615/bloodysunday.html |title=Bloody Sunday killings 'unjustifiable' |date=15 June 2010}}</ref> He acknowledged that all those who died were unarmed when they were killed by British soldiers and that a British soldier had fired the first shot at civilians. He also said that this was not a premeditated action, though "there was no point in trying to soften or equivocate" as "what happened should never, ever have happened". Cameron then apologised on behalf of the British Government by saying he was "deeply sorry".

A survey conducted by [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]] in June 2010 found that 61 per cent of Britons and 70 per cent of Northern Irish agreed with Cameron’s apology for the Bloody Sunday events.<ref>{{cite web|author=Angus Reid Public Opinion |url=http://www.visioncritical.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/2010.06.28_Sunday_BRI.pdf |title=Britons and Northern Irish Welcome PM’s Apology for Bloody Sunday |publisher=Angus Reid Public Opinion |date=28 June 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref>

Stephen Pollard, solicitor representing several of the soldiers, said on 15 June 2010 that Saville had cherry-picked the evidence and did not have justification for his findings.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Devenport, BBC NI Political Editor |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/northern_ireland/10320609.stm |title=Bloody Sunday killings 'unjustified and unjustifiable' |publisher=BBC News |date=30 January 1972 |accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref>

In January 2013, shortly before the annual Bloody Sunday remembrance march, Parachute Regiment flags appeared in the loyalist Fountain, Waterside and [[Drumahoe]] areas of Derry. The display of the flags was heavily criticised by nationalist politicians and relatives of the Bloody Sunday dead.<ref>[http://www.derryjournal.com/news/local/para-flag-fury-1-4697596 "Para Flag Fury"] ''Derry Journal'' 18 January 2013 Retrieved 11 February 2013</ref> The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] also condemned the flying of the flags.<ref>[http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/army-condemns-irresponsible-disrespectful-use-of-its-flags-1-5174546 "Army condemns ‘irresponsible, disrespectful’ use of its flags"] ''The Newsletter''</ref>
