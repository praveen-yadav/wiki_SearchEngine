'''Abijah''' (אביה '' 'aḆiYaH'') or '''Abiah''' or '''Abia''', [[modern Hebrew]] '''Aviya''', is a [[Biblical Hebrew|Biblical]] [[unisex name]] that means "my Father is [[Yahweh]]".<ref>[http://www.mfnames.com/mfnames/a/origin-and-meaning-of-abijah.htm MFnames.com - Origin and Meaning of Abijah]</ref> In the Old Testament the name Abijah was borne by several characters:

'''Women'''
# [[Abijah (queen)]], the daughter of [[Abijah (queen)|Zechariah]] (2 [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 29:1), who married King [[Ahaz]] of Judah. She is also called Abi. (2 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 18:2) She was the mother of King [[Hezekiah]] ([[BibleWiki:2 Chronicles Chapter 29, Verse 1|2 Chr. 29:1]]).
# A wife of [[Hezron|Hetzron]], one of the grandchildren of [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] (1 Chr. 2:24).

'''Men'''
# [[Abijah (king)]] of the [[Kingdom of Judah]], also known as [[Abijam]] (אבים '' 'aḄiYaM'' "My Father is Yam [Sea]"), who was son of [[Rehoboam]] and succeeded him on the throne of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (1 Chr. 3:10, [[BibleWiki:Matthew Chapter 1, Verse 7|Matthew 1:7]], 1 Kings 14:31).
# A son of [[List of minor Biblical figures#Becher|Becher]], the son of [[Benjamin]] (1 Chr. 7:8).
# The second son of [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] ([[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 8:2; 1 Chr. 6:28). His conduct, along with that of his brother, as a judge in [[Beer-sheba]], to which office his father had appointed him, led to popular discontent, and ultimately provoked the people to demand a [[monarchy]].
# A descendant of [[Eleazar]], the son of [[Aaron]], a chief of one of the twenty-four orders into which the priesthood was divided by [[David (biblical king)|David]] (1 Chr. 24:10). The order of Abijah was one of those that did not return from the Captivity ([[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 2:36–39; [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] 7:39–42; 12:1).
# A son of [[Jeroboam]], the first king of Israel. On account of his severe illness when a youth, his father sent his wife to consult the prophet [[Ahijah the Shilonite|Ahijah]] regarding his recovery. The prophet, though blind with old age, knew the wife of Jeroboam as soon as she approached, and under a divine impulse he announced to her that inasmuch as in Abijah alone of all the house of Jeroboam there was found "some good thing toward the Lord", he only would come to his grave in peace. As his mother crossed the threshold of the door on her return, the youth died, and "all Israel mourned for him" ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 14:1–18).
# The head of the eighth of the twenty-four courses into which [[David]] divided the priests, and an ancestor of [[Zechariah (priest)|Zecharias]] the priest, who was the father of [[John the Baptist]] ({{bibleref|1Chronicles|24:10|KJV}}, {{bibleref|Luke|1:5|KJV}}, {{bibleref|Luke|1:13|KJV}}).
