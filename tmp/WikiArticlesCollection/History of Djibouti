{{History of Djibouti}}
[[Djibouti]] is a country in the [[Horn of Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Somalia]] to the southeast, [[Eritrea]] and the [[Red Sea]] to the northwest, [[Ethiopia]] to the west and south, and the [[Gulf of Aden]] and [[Yemen]] to the northeast.

In antiquity, the territory was part of the [[Land of Punt]]. The Djibouti area, along with other localities in the Horn region, was later the seat of the medieval [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]] and [[Ifat Sultanate|Ifat]] Sultanates. In the late 19th century, the colony of [[French Somaliland]] was established following treaties signed by the ruling [[Issa (clan)|Issa Somali]] and [[Afar people|Afar]] Sultans with the French. It was subsequently renamed to the [[French Territory of the Afars and the Issas]] in 1967. A decade later, the Djiboutian people voted for independence, officially marking the establishment of the Republic of Djibouti.

Together with northern [[Somalia]], [[Eritrea]] and the [[Red Sea]] coast of [[Sudan]], Djibouti is considered the most likely location of the land known to the ancient [[Egyptians]] as ''[[Land of Punt|Punt]]'' (or "Ta Netjeru", meaning "God's Land"), whose first mention dates to the 25th century BC.<ref>Simson Najovits, ''Egypt, trunk of the tree, Volume 2'', (Algora Publishing: 2004), p.258.</ref> The Puntites were a nation of people that had close relations with [[Ancient Egypt]] during the times of [[Pharaoh]] [[Sahure]] and [[Queen regnant|Queen]] [[Hatshepsut]]. They "traded not only in their own produce of incense, [[ebony]] and [[Shorthorn|short-horned cattle]], but also in goods from other neighbouring regions, including gold, [[ivory]] and animal skins."<ref>Tyldesley, Hatchepsut, p.147</ref> According to the temple reliefs at [[Deir el-Bahari]], the Land of Punt was ruled at that time by King Parahu and Queen Ati.<ref>{{harvnb|Breasted|1906-07|pp=246–295|Ref=none}}, vol. 1.</ref>

==Adal Sultanate==
{{main|Adal Sultanate}}
[[File:YagbeaSionBattlingAdaSultan.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Adal Sultanate|Sultan of Adal]] (right) and his troops battling King [[Yagbe'u Seyon of Ethiopia|Yagbea-Sion]] and his men.]]
[[Islam]] was introduced to the area early on from the [[Arabian peninsula]], shortly after the [[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]. In the late 800s, [[Al-Yaqubi]] wrote that Muslims were living along the northern Horn seaboard.<ref name="Encyamer">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 25|year=1965|publisher=Americana Corporation|pages=255|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=OP5LAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> He also mentioned that the Adal kingdom had its capital in [[Zeila]], a port city in the northwestern [[Awdal]] region abutting Djibouti.<ref name="Encyamer"/><ref name="Lewispohoa">{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=I.M.|title=Peoples of the Horn of Africa: Somali, Afar and Saho|year=1955|publisher=International African Institute|pages=140|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=Cd0mAQAAMAAJ}}</ref> This suggests that the [[Adal Sultanate]] with Zeila as its headquarters dates back to at least the 9th or 10th centuries. According to I.M. Lewis, the polity was governed by local dynasties consisting of Somalized Arabs or Arabized Somalis, who also ruled over the similarly-established [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]] in the [[Benadir]] region to the south. Adal's history from this founding period forth would be characterized by a succession of battles with neighbouring [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]].<ref name="Lewispohoa"/> At its height, the Adal kingdom controlled large parts of modern-day Djibouti, Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia.

==Ifat Sultanate==
{{main|Ifat Sultanate}}
The [[Ifat Sultanate]] was a medieval kingdom in the Horn of Africa. Founded in 1285 by the [[Walashma dynasty]], it was centered in [[Zeila]].<ref>J. Gordon Melton and Martin Baumann, Religions of the World, Second Edition: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, page 2663</ref><ref>Asafa Jalata, State Crises, Globalisation, And National Movements In North-east Africa page 3-4</ref> Ifat established bases in Djibouti and northern Somalia, and from there expanded southward to the [[Ahmar Mountains]]. Its [[Sultan]] Umar Walashma (or his son Ali, according to another source) is recorded as having conquered the Sultanate of [[Shewa]] in 1285. Taddesse Tamrat explains Sultan Umar's military expedition as an effort to consolidate the Muslim territories in the Horn, in much the same way as Emperor [[Yekuno Amlak]] was attempting to unite the Christian territories in the highlands during the same period. These two states inevitably came into conflict over Shewa and territories further south. A lengthy war ensued, but the Muslim sultanates of the time were not strongly unified. Ifat was finally defeated by Emperor [[Amda Seyon I]] of Ethiopia in 1332, and withdrew from Shewa.

==Egypt Eyalet==
{{main|Egypt Eyalet}}
Governor Abou Baker orders the Egyptian garrison at [[Sagallo]] to retire to [[Zeila]]. The cruiser Seignelay reaches Sagallo shortly after the Egyptians depart. French troops occupy the fort despite protests from the British Agent in [[Aden]], Major Frederick Mercer Hunter, who dispatches troops to safeguard British and Egyptian interests in [[Zeila]] and prevent further extension of French influence in that direction.<ref name="awdalpress.com">[http://www.awdalpress.com/index/archives/16528] FRENCH SOMALI COAST Timeline</ref>
On the 14 April 1884 the Commander of the patrol sloop L’Inferent reports on the Egyptian occupation in the Gulf of Tadjoura. The Commander of the patrol sloop Le Vaudreuil reports that the Egyptians are occupying the interior between [[Obock]] and [[Tadjoura]]. Emperor Johannes IV of Ethiopia signs an accord with [[Great Britain]] to cease fighting the Egyptians and to allow the evacuation of Egyptian forces from [[Ethiopia]] and the Somali Coast ports.
The Egyptian garrison is withdrawn from [[Tadjoura]]. Léonce Lagarde deploys a patrol sloop to [[Tadjoura]] the following night. A British warship arrives the next morning to find the French sloop already anchored before the town.<ref name="awdalpress.com"/>

==French Somaliland==
{{main|French Somaliland|List of colonial heads of Djibouti (French Somaliland)}}
[[Image:EthiopiaRAND1908.jpg|thumb|right|240px|French Somaliland in 1908]]
It was [[Rochet d'Hericourt]]'s exploration into [[Shoa, Ethiopia|Shoa]] (1839–42) that marked the beginning of French interest in the Djiboutian coast of the [[Red Sea]]. Further exploration by [[Henri Lambert]], French Consular Agent at Aden, and Captain [[Fleuriot de Langle]] led to a treaty of friendship and assistance between France and the sultans of Raheita, [[Tadjoura]], and Gobaad, from whom the French purchased the anchorage of [[Obock]] in 1862.

Growing French interest in the area took place against a backdrop of British activity in Egypt and the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869. Between 1883-87, [[France]] signed various treaties with the then ruling [[Issa (clan)|Issa]] [[Somali people|Somali]] and [[Afar people|Afar]] [[Sultan]]s, which allowed it to expand the [[protectorate]] to include the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]].<ref name="Uwechue">Raph Uwechue, ''Africa year book and who's who'', (Africa Journal Ltd.: 1977), p. 209.</ref><ref name="Chisholm">Hugh Chisholm (ed.), ''The encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information'', Volume 25, (At the University press: 1911), p. 383.</ref> [[Léonce Lagarde]] was subsequently installed as the protectorate's governor. In 1894, he established a permanent French administration in the [[Djibouti (city)|city of Djibouti]] and named the region ''Côte française des Somalis'' ([[French Somaliland]]), a name which continued until 1967. The territory's border with Ethiopia, marked out in 1897 by France and [[Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia]], was later reaffirmed by agreements with [[Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia]] in 1945 and 1954.

In 1889, a Russian by the name of Nikolay Ivanovitch Achinov<ref>Ashinov, Achinov, Atchinoff or Atchimoff</ref><ref>{{fr icon}} [http://collections.bm-lyon.fr/PER0016108 Le cosaque Achinoff] in Le Progrès Illustré (French daily newspaper), March 1, 1891</ref> (b. 1856<ref>Ernest A.

The French considered the presence of the Russians as a violation of their territorial rights and dispatched two [[gunboat]]s. The Russians were bombarded and after some loss of life, surrendered. The colonists were deported to [[Odessa]] and the dream of Russian expansion in East Africa came to an end in less than one year.

The administrative capital was moved from Obock in 1896. The city of [[Djibouti, Djibouti|Djibouti]], which had a harbor with good access that attracted trade caravans crossing East Africa, became the new administrative capital. The [[Franco-Ethiopian railway]], linking Djibouti to the heart of Ethiopia, began in 1897 and reached [[Addis Ababa]] in June 1917, increasing the volume of trade passing through the port.

===World War II===
After the Italian [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invasion and occupation of Ethiopia]] in the mid-1930s, constant border skirmishes occurred between French forces in French Somaliland and Italian forces in [[Italian East Africa]]. In June 1940, during the early stages of [[World War II]], [[fall of France|France fell]] and the colony was then ruled by the pro-[[Axis powers|Axis]] [[Vichy France|Vichy (French) government]].

British and Commonwealth forces fought the neighboring Italians during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]].  In 1941, the Italians were defeated and the Vichy forces in French Somaliland were isolated. The Vichy French administration continued to hold out in the colony for over one year after the Italian collapse.  When [[Nazi Germany]] invaded [[France]] in 1940, [[Djibouti]] became the [[Vichy French]] control. In response, the [[United Kingdom]] closed the port of [[Djibouti City]] but it could not prevent local French to provide information on the passing ship convoys. In 1942, about 4,000 [[British troops]] occupied the city. A local battalion from French Somaliland participated in the [[Liberation of Paris]] in 1944.

===Referendums===
In 1958, on the eve of neighboring Somalia's independence in 1960, a [[French Somaliland overseas territory referendum, 1958|referendum]] was held in Djibouti to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, partly due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans.<ref name=Barrington2006>Barrington, Lowell, [http://books.google.com/books?id=pyWpKKlukLcC&pg=PA115 ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States''], (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p. 115 ISBN 0472068989</ref> There was also widespread [[vote rigging]], with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls.<ref>Kevin Shillington, Encyclopedia of African history, (CRC Press: 2005), p. 360 ISBN 1579582451.</ref> The majority of those who voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia as had been proposed by [[Mahmoud Harbi]], Vice President of the Government Council. Harbi died in a plane crash two years later under mysterious circumstances.<ref name="Barrington2006">Barrington, Lowell, ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States'', (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p.115</ref><ref name="Tss">United States Joint Publications Research Service, ''Translations on Sub-Saharan Africa'', Issues 464-492, (1966), p.24.</ref>

In 1960, with the fall of the ruling Dini administration, [[Ali Aref Bourhan]], a Harbist politician, assumed the seat of Vice President of the Government Council of French Somaliland, representing the UNI party.<ref name="Wsdjib">[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Djibouti.html Worldstatesmen - DJibouti]</ref><ref name="Jfeaa">[http://ccrh.revues.org/472 Jacques Foccart et Ali Aref]</ref> He would hold that position until 1966.

That same year, France rejected the [[United Nations]]' recommendation that it should grant French Somaliland independence. In August, an official visit to the territory by then French President, General [[Charles de Gaulle]], was also met with demonstrations and rioting.<ref name="Apcoatf">''A Political Chronology of Africa'', (Taylor & Francis), p.132.</ref><ref name="Nwvol">''Newsweek'', Volume 81, (Newsweek: 1973), p.254.</ref> In response to the protests, de Gaulle ordered another referendum.<ref name="Nwvol"/>

On 19 March 1967, a [[French Somaliland independence referendum, 1967|second plebiscite]] was held to determine the fate of the territory. Initial results supported a continued but looser relationship with France. Voting was also divided along ethnic lines, with the resident Somalis generally voting for independence, with the goal of eventual reunion with Somalia, and the Afars largely opting to remain associated with France.<ref name="Apcoatf"/> However, the referendum was again marred by reports of vote rigging on the part of the French authorities,<ref name="Aufsnas">American Universities Field Staff, ''Northeast Africa series'', Volume 15, Issue 1, (American Universities Field Staff.: 1968), p.3.</ref> with some 10,000 Somalis deported under the pretext that they did not have valid identity cards.<ref name="Nwjestr">Jean Strouse, ''Newsweek'', Volume 69, Issues 10-17, (Newsweek: 1967), p.48.</ref> According to official figures, although the territory was at the time inhabited by 58,240 Somali and 48,270 Afar, only 14,689 Somali were allowed to register to vote versus 22,004 Afar.<ref name="Arlacr">Africa Research, Ltd, ''Africa contemporary record: annual survey and documents'', Volume 1, (Africana Pub. Co.: 1969), p.264.</ref> Somali representatives also charged that the French had simultaneously imported thousands of Afar nomads from neighboring [[Ethiopia]] to further tip the odds in their favor, but the French authorities denied this, suggesting that Afars already greatly outnumbered Somalis on the voting lists.<ref name="Nwjestr"/> Announcement of the plebiscite results sparked civil unrest, including several deaths. France also increased its military force along the frontier.<ref name="Nwjestr"/><ref name="Tioipeami">Alvin J. Cottrell, Robert Michael Burrell, Georgetown University.

==French Territory of the Afars and Issas==
{{See also|French Territory of the Afars and Issas}}
In 1967, shortly after the second referendum was held, the former ''Côte française des Somalis'' (French Somaliland) was renamed to ''Territoire français des Afars et des Issas''. This was both in acknowledgement of the large Afar constituency and to downplay the significance of the Somali composition (the [[Issa (clan)|Issa]] being a Somali sub-clan).<ref name="Tioipeami"/>

The French Territory of Afars and Issas also differed from French Somaliland in terms of government structure, as the position of Governor General changed to that of High Commissioner. A nine member council of government was also implemented.

With a steadily enlarging Somali population, the likelihood of a third referendum appearing successful had grown even more dim. The prohibitive cost of maintaining the colony, France's last outpost on the continent, was another factor that compelled observers to doubt that the French would attempt to hold on to the territory.<ref name="Nwvol">''Newsweek'', Volume 81, (Newsweek, inc.: 1973), p.254.</ref>

On June 27, 1977, a [[Afars and Issas independence referendum, 1977|third vote]] took place. A landslide 98.8% of the electorate supported disengagement from France, officially marking [[Djibouti]]'s independence.<ref name="Nwvol"/><ref>[http://africanelections.tripod.com/dj.html Elections in Djibouti] African Elections Database</ref> [[Hassan Gouled Aptidon]], a Somali politician who had campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958, eventually wound up as the nation's first president (1977–1999).<ref name=Barrington2006/>

==Djibouti Republic==
In 1981, Aptidon turned the country into a one party state by declaring that his party, the Rassemblement Populaire pour le Progrès (RPP) ([[People's Rally for Progress]]), was the sole legal one. A [[Djiboutian Civil War|civil war]] broke out in 1991, between the government and a predominantly Afar rebel group, the [[Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy]] (FRUD). The FRUD signed a peace accord with the government in December 1994, ending the conflict. Two FRUD members were made cabinet members, and in the presidential elections of 1999 the FRUD campaigned in support of the RPP.

Aptidon resigned as president 1999, at the age of 83, after being elected to a fifth term in 1997. His successor was his nephew, [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]].

On May 12, 2001, President Ismail Omar Guelleh presided over the signing of what is termed the final peace accord officially ending the decade-long civil war between the government and the armed faction of the FRUD, led by Ahmed Dini Ahmed, an Afar nationalist and former Gouled political ally. The peace accord successfully completed the peace process begun on February 7, 2000 in Paris. [[Ahmed Dini Ahmed]] represented the FRUD.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

In the presidential election held April 8, 2005 Ismail Omar Guelleh was re-elected to a second 6-year term at the head of a multi-party coalition that included the FRUD and other major parties. A loose coalition of opposition parties again [[election boycott|boycotted the election]]. Currently, political power is shared by a Somali president and an Afar prime minister, with an Afar career diplomat as Foreign Minister and other cabinet posts roughly divided. However, Issas are predominate in the government, civil service, and the ruling party. That, together with a shortage of non-government employment, has bred resentment and continued political competition between the Issa Somalis and the Afars. In March 2006, Djibouti held its first regional elections and began implementing a decentralization plan. The broad pro-government coalition, including FRUD candidates, again ran unopposed when the government refused to meet opposition preconditions for participation. In the 2008 elections, the opposition Union for a Presidential Majority (UMP) party boycotted the election, leaving all 65 seats to the ruling RPP. Voter turnout figures were disputed. Guelleh was re-elected in the 2011 presidential election.

Due to its strategic location at the mouth of the [[Bab el Mandeb]] gateway to the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]], Djibouti also hosts various foreign military bases. [[Camp Lemonnier]] is a United States Naval Expeditionary Base,<ref name=MARCENT-2006>{{cite web |title=Introduction to MARCENT
