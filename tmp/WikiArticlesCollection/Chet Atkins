'''Chester Burton "Chet" Atkins''' (June 20, 1924&nbsp;– June 30, 2001) was an American guitarist, occasional vocalist and [[record producer]] who, along with [[Owen Bradley]], created the smoother [[country music]] style known as the [[Nashville sound]], which expanded country's appeal to adult pop music fans as well.

Atkins' signature picking style was inspired by [[Merle Travis]]. Other major guitar influences were [[Django Reinhardt]], [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]], [[Les Paul]] and later [[Jerry Reed]].<ref name=pc10/> His trademark picking style and musicianship brought him admirers within and outside the country scene, both in the United States and internationally. Atkins produced records for [[The Browns]], [[Porter Wagoner]], [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Dottie West]], [[Perry Como]], [[Elvis Presley]], the [[Everly Brothers]], [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Don Gibson]], [[Jim Reeves]], [[Jerry Reed]], [[Skeeter Davis]], [[Waylon Jennings]] and many others.

Among many honors, Atkins received 14 [[Grammy Award]]s as well as the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]], nine [[Country Music Association]] Instrumentalist of the Year awards, and was inducted into the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]], [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]] and the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]].

==Biography==

===Childhood and early life===
Chet Atkins was born on June 20, 1924, in [[Luttrell, Tennessee|Luttrell]], [[Tennessee]], near [[Clinch Mountain]]. His parents divorced when he was six, after which he was raised by his mother. He was the youngest of three boys and a girl. He started out on the [[ukulele]], later moving on to the [[fiddle]], but traded his brother Lowell an old pistol and some chores for a [[guitar]] when he was nine.<ref name="CMT">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/atkins_chet/bio.jhtml |title=Country Music Television biography. |publisher=Cmt.com |date= |accessdate=March 28, 2008}}</ref> He stated in his 1974 autobiography, "We were so poor and everybody around us was so poor that it was the forties before anyone even knew there had been a depression." Forced to relocate to [[Fortson, Georgia|Fortson]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], to live with his father because of a critical [[asthma]] condition, Atkins was a sensitive youth who made music his obsession. Because of his illness, he was forced to sleep in a straight-back chair in order to breathe comfortably. On those nights, he would play his guitar until he fell asleep holding it, a habit which lasted his whole life.<ref name="CG">Atkins, Chet and Neely, Bill. (1974). "Country Gentleman". Chicago. Harry Regnery Company. ISBN 0-8092-9051-0.</ref> While living in Fortson, he attended historic Mountain Hill School. He would return in the 1990s to play a series of charity concerts to save the school from demolition.<ref>{{cite news

Stories have been told about the very young Chet, who, when a friend or relative would come to visit and play guitar, would crowd in and put his ear so very close to the instrument that it became difficult for that person to play.<ref name="CG" />

Atkins became an accomplished guitarist while he was in high school.<ref name="CMT" /> He would use the restroom in the school to practice, because it gave better acoustics.<ref>Atkins, Chet and Neely, Bill.

Later in life he lightheartedly gave himself (along with [[John Knowles (guitarist)|John Knowles]], [[Tommy Emmanuel]], [[Steve Wariner]], [[Jerry Reed]] and [[Marcel Dadi]]<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8AXs6oRPnQ : 'Interview of Chet Atkins']</ref>) the honorary degree CGP, standing for "Certified Guitar Player".<ref name="mamg" />
In 2011 daughter Merle Atkins Russell bestowed the CGP degree upon long time sideman Paul Yandell.  She then declared no more CGP's would be allowed by the Atkins estate.<ref>{{cite web

Atkins did not have a strong style of his own until 1939 when (while still living in Georgia) he heard [[Merle Travis]] picking over [[WLW]] radio.<ref name="CG" /><ref>*[http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/inductees.aspx?cid=99 Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]</ref> This early influence dramatically shaped his unique playing style.<ref name=pc10/> Whereas Travis's right hand used his index finger for the melody and thumb for bass notes, Atkins expanded his right hand style to include picking with his first three fingers, with the thumb on bass.

Chet Atkins was a [[Ham Radio]] General class licensee. Formerly using the call-sign, WA4CZD, he obtained the vanity call sign W4CGP in 1998 to reflect the C.G.P. name. He was an [[American Radio Relay League|ARRL]] member.<ref>[http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2001/07/02/1/?nc=1 ARRLWeb: 'Mister Guitar,' Chet Atkins, W4CGP, SK]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref>

===Early musical career===
After dropping out of high school in 1942, Atkins landed a job at [[WNOX|WNOX-AM]] radio in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]. There he played fiddle and guitar with singer [[Bill Carlisle]] and comic [[Archie Campbell]] as well as becoming a member of the station's Dixieland Swingsters, a small swing instrumental combo. After three years, he moved to [[WLW|WLW-AM]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], where Merle Travis had formerly worked.

After six months he moved to Raleigh and worked with [[Johnnie and Jack]] before heading for [[Richmond, Virginia]], where he performed with Sunshine Sue Workman. Atkins' shy personality worked against him, as did the fact that his sophisticated style led many to doubt he was truly "country." He was fired often but was soon able to land another job at another radio station due to his unique playing ability.<ref name="CG" /> Atkins and [[Jethro Burns]] of [[Homer and Jethro]] married twin sisters, Leona and Lois Johnson who sang as Laverne and Fern Johnson: the Johnson Sisters. Leona Atkins outlived Atkins by eight years, dying in 2009 at the age of 85.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=3389 |title=Chet Atkins' widow dies |date=October 22, 2009 |work=Country Standard Time |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}</ref>

Traveling to Chicago, Atkins auditioned for [[Red Foley]], who was leaving his star position on [[WLS (AM)|WLS-AM]]'s ''[[National Barn Dance]]'' to join the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref name="RollingStone">[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5931727/chet_atkins_dies/print "Chet Atkins dies"] ''Rolling Stone''. Accessed on March 28, 2008.</ref> Atkins made his first appearance at the Opry in 1946 as a member of Foley's band. He also recorded a single for Nashville-based Bullet Records that year. That single, "Guitar Blues", was fairly progressive, including as it did, a clarinet solo by Nashville dance band musician Dutch McMillan with [[Owen Bradley]] on piano. He had a solo spot on the Opry; but when that was cut, Atkins moved on to [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]]. Despite the support of executive [[Si Siman]], however, he soon was fired for not sounding "country enough."<ref name="CG" />

===Signing with RCA Victor===
While working with a Western band in [[Denver, Colorado]], Atkins came to the attention of [[RCA Victor Records|RCA Victor]]. Siman had been encouraging [[Stephen H. Sholes|Steve Sholes]] to sign Atkins, as his style (with the success of [[Merle Travis]] as a hit recording artist) was suddenly in vogue. Sholes, A&R director of country music at RCA, tracked Atkins down to Denver.

He made his first RCA Victor recordings in Chicago in 1947. They did not sell. He did some studio work for RCA that year but had relocated to Knoxville again where he worked with [[Homer and Jethro]] on WNOX's new Saturday night radio show ''The Tennessee Barn Dance'' and the popular ''Midday Merry Go Round''.

In 1949 he left WNOX to join [[June Carter]] with Mother Maybelle & [[The Carter Sisters]] back on KWTO. This incarnation of the old [[Carter Family]] featured Maybelle Carter and daughters June, Helen and Anita. Their work soon attracted attention from the Grand Ole Opry. The group relocated to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in mid-1950. Atkins began working on recording sessions, performing on [[WSM (AM)|WSM-AM]] and the Opry.<ref name="CG" /> Atkins became a member of The Opry in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web
| title = Opry Timeline - 1950s
| url = http://www.opry.com/about/Timeline_1950.html
| date = 
| accessdate = July 2, 2012}}</ref>

While he had not yet had a hit record on RCA Victor his stature was growing. He began assisting Sholes as a Session Leader when the New York–based producer needed help organizing Nashville sessions for RCA Victor artists. Atkins's first hit single was "[[Mr. Sandman]]", followed by "Silver Bell", which he did as a duet with [[Hank Snow]]. His albums also became more popular, and he was featured on ABC-TV's ''[[The Eddy Arnold Show]]'' during the summer of 1956; as well as on ''[[Ozark Jubilee|Country Music Jubilee]]'' in 1957 and '58 (by then renamed ''Jubilee USA'').
[[File:Gretsch G6122-1958.jpg|thumb|upright|Atkins's [[Gretsch]] ''Country Gentleman'', model G6122-1962]]

In addition to recording, Atkins became a design consultant for [[Gretsch]], who manufactured a popular Chet Atkins line of electric guitars from 1955–1980. Atkins also became manager of RCA Victor's Nashville studio, eventually inspiring and seeing the completion of the legendary [[RCA Studio B]], the first studio built specifically for the purpose of recording on the now-famous [[Music Row]].<ref name="mamg" />

===Performer and producer===
When Sholes took over pop production in 1957—a result of his success with [[Elvis Presley]]—he put Atkins in charge of RCA Victor's Nashville division. With country music record sales declining as rock and roll took over, Atkins and [[Bob Ferguson (music)|Bob Ferguson]] took their cue from [[Owen Bradley]] and eliminated fiddles and steel guitar as a means of making country singers appeal to pop fans. This became known as the [[Nashville sound]] which Atkins said was a label created by the media attached to a style of recording done during that period to keep country (and their jobs) viable.

Atkins used the [[Jordanaires]] and a rhythm section on hits like [[Jim Reeves]]' "[[Four Walls (song)|Four Walls]]" and "[[He'll Have to Go]]"<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r245817|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic entry for ''Welcome to My World'', Jim Reeves 1996 box-set from Bear Family Records]</ref> and [[Don Gibson]]'s "[[Oh Lonesome Me]]" and "Blue Blue Day".<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1624|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic biography entry for Don Gibson]</ref> The once rare phenomenon of having a country hit [[Crossover (music)|cross over]] to pop success became more common. He and Bradley had essentially put the producer in the driver's seat, guiding an artist's choice of material and the musical background.

Atkins made his own records, which usually visited pop standards and [[jazz]], in a sophisticated home studio, often recording the rhythm tracks at RCA but adding his solo parts at home, refining the tracks until the results satisfied him.<ref name="mamg" /> Guitarists of all styles came to admire various Atkins albums for their unique musical ideas and in some cases experimental electronic ideas. In this period he became known internationally as "Mister Guitar", inspiring an album named ''[[Mister Guitar]]'', engineered by both Bob Ferris and [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], Ferris's replacement.

[[File:RCA Studio B - Chet Atkins, Bill Porter.jpg|thumb|upright|Atkins listening as [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]] adjusts a mix in RCA's Nashville studio]]
At the end of March 1959, Porter took over as chief engineer at RCA's Nashville studio, in the space now known as "Studio B". (At the time there was only one RCA studio in Nashville, with no letter designation.) Porter soon helped Atkins get a better reverberation sound from the studio's German effects device, an [[Elektro-Mess-Technik|EMT]] [[Reverberation#Plate_reverberators|plate reverb]]. With his [[golden ear]], Porter found the studio's acoustics to be problematic, and he devised a set of acoustic baffles to hang from the ceiling, then selected positions for microphones based on resonant [[room modes]]. The sound of the recordings improved significantly, and the studio achieved a string of successes. The Nashville sound became more [[Dynamic range|dynamic]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ballou|first=Glen|title=Handbook for Sound Engineers|year=1998|publisher=Focal Press|page=1154}}</ref> In later years, when Bradley asked how he achieved his sound, Atkins told him "it was Porter."<ref name=McClellan2004>{{cite book |last1=McClellan |first1=John |last2=Bratic |first2=Deyan |title=Chet Atkins in Three Dimensions |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mmCUExOXx0MC |volume=2 |year=2004 |publisher=Mel Bay Publications |isbn=0-7866-5877-0 |pages=149–152}}</ref> Porter described Atkins as respectful of musicians when recording—if someone was out of tune he would not single that person out by name. Instead, he would say something like, "we got a little tuning problem&nbsp;... Everybody check and see what's going on."<ref name=McClellan2004/> If that didn't work, Atkins would instruct Porter to turn the offending player down in the mix. When Porter left RCA in late 1964, Atkins said, "the sound was never the same, never as great."<ref name=McClellan2004/>

Atkins's trademark "Atkins Style" of playing uses the thumb and first two—sometimes three—fingers of the right hand. He developed this style from listening to Merle Travis<ref name=pc10>{{Gilliland |url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19758/m1/ |title=Show 10 - Tennessee Firebird: American country music before and after Elvis. [Part 2] }}</ref> occasionally on a primitive radio. He was sure no one could play that articulately with just the thumb and index finger (which was exactly how Travis played) and he assumed it required the thumb and two fingers—and that was the style he pioneered and mastered.

He enjoyed jamming with fellow studio musicians which led to them being asked to perform at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in 1960. Although that performance was canceled due to rioting, a live recording of the group (''[[After the Riot in Newport|After the Riot at Newport]]'') was released. Atkins performed by invitation at the [[White House]] for presidents Kennedy through George H. W. Bush. Atkins was a member of the [[Million Dollar Band (country music group)|Million Dollar Band]] during the 1980s. He is also well known for his song "Yankee Doodle Dixie", in which he played "[[Yankee Doodle]]" and "[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]" simultaneously, on the same guitar.

Before his mentor Sholes died in 1968, Atkins had become vice president of RCA's country division. In 1987 he told [[Nine-O-One Network Magazine]] that he was "ashamed" of his promotion: "I wanted to be known as a guitarist and I know, too, that they give you titles like that in lieu of money. So beware when they want to make you vice president."<ref>Nine-O-One Interview, Nine-O-One Network Magazine,December 1987, p.10-11</ref> He had brought [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Connie Smith]], [[Bobby Bare]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Jerry Reed]] and [[John Hartford]] to the label in the 1960s and inspired and helped countless others.<ref name="RockHall">[http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/chet-atkins "Chet Atkins"], Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Accessed on March 28, 2008.</ref> He took a considerable risk during the mid-1960s, when the [[Civil Rights Movement]] sparked violence throughout the South by signing country music's first African-American singer [[Charley Pride]], who sang rawer country than the smoother music Atkins had pioneered.

Atkins's own biggest hit single came in 1965, with "Yakety Axe", an adaptation of his friend saxophonist [[Boots Randolph]]'s "[[Yakety Sax]]". He rarely performed in those days, and eventually had to hire other RCA producers like [[Bob Ferguson (music)|Bob Ferguson]] and [[Felton Jarvis]] to alleviate his workload.<ref name="mamg" />

===Later career===
In the 1970s, Atkins became increasingly stressed by his executive duties. He produced fewer records but could still turn out hits such as [[Perry Como]]'s pop hit "[[And I Love You So (song)|And I Love You So]]". He recorded extensively with close friend and fellow picker [[Jerry Reed]], who'd become a hit artist in his own right. A 1973 diagnosis of [[colorectal cancer|colon cancer]], however, led Atkins to redefine his role at RCA, to allow others to handle administration while he went back to his first love, the guitar, often recording with [[Jerry Reed|Reed]] or even [[Homer & Jethro]]'s Jethro Burns (Atkins' brother-in-law) after Homer died in 1971.<ref name="mamg" />

By the late 1970s, RCA decided to remove Atkins from his producing duties and replace him with younger men. He also felt stifled because the record company would not let him branch into [[jazz]]. His mid-1970s collaborations with one of his influences, [[Les Paul]], ''Chester & Lester'' and ''Guitar Monsters'', had already reflected that interest; ''Chester & Lester'' was one of the best-selling recordings of Atkins's career. At the same time he grew dissatisfied with the direction Gretsch (no longer family-owned) was going and withdrew his authorization for them to use his name and began designing guitars with [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]]. He left RCA in 1982 and signed with [[Columbia Records]], for whom he produced a debut album in 1983.<ref name="RollingStone" />

Jazz had always been a strong love of his, and often in his career he was criticized by "pure" country musicians for his jazz influences. He also said on many occasions that he did not like being called a "country guitarist", insisting that he was a guitarist, period. Although he played 'by ear' and was a masterful improviser he was able to read music and even performed some classical guitar pieces. When [[Roger C. Field]], a friend, suggested to him in 1991 that he record and perform with a female singer he did so with [[Suzy Bogguss]].<ref name="mamg"/>

He returned to his country roots for albums he recorded with [[Mark Knopfler]] and [[Jerry Reed]].<ref name="mamg" /> Knopfler had long mentioned Atkins as one of his earliest influences. Atkins also collaborated with Australian guitar legend [[Tommy Emmanuel]]. On being asked to name the ten most influential guitarists of the 20th century, he named [[Django Reinhardt]] to the first position, and also placed himself on the list.<ref name="OfficialSite">[http://www.misterguitar.com/news/chetsten.html Official Web Site of Chet Atkins]. Accessed on March 31, 2008.</ref>

In later years he even went back to radio, appearing on [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Prairie Home Companion]]'' radio program, on [[American Public Media]] radio, even picking up a fiddle from time to time.<ref name="mamg" />

==Death and legacy==
Atkins received numerous awards, including 14 Grammy Awards and nine Country Music Association Instrumentalist of the Year awards.<ref name="RollingStone" /> In 1993 he was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. ''Billboard'' magazine awarded him their Century Award, their "highest honor for distinguished creative achievement", in December 1997.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/chetatkins/biography "Biography&nbsp;– Chet Atkins"]. ''Rolling Stone''. Accessed on May 10, 2008.</ref>

Atkins is notable for his broad influence. His love for numerous styles of music can be traced from his early recording of stride-pianist [[James P. Johnson]]'s "Johnson Rag," all the way to the rock stylings of [[Eric Johnson]], an invited guest on Atkins's recording sessions who, when Chet attempted to copy his influential rocker "[[Cliffs of Dover (song)|Cliffs of Dover]]," led to Atkins's creation of a unique arrangement of "Londonderry Air (Danny Boy)."

Chet's recordings of "Malagueña" inspired a new generation of [[Flamenco]] guitarists; the classical guitar selections included on almost all his albums were, for many American artists working in the field today, the first classical guitar they ever heard. He recorded [[smooth jazz]] guitar still played on American airwaves today.

Atkins continued performing in the 1990s, but his health declined after being diagnosed again with cancer in 1996. He died on June 30, 2001, at his home in Nashville, Tennessee.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/07/02/obit.chet.atkins/index.html "Obituary"], CNN, July 2, 2001 Accessed June 21, 2008</ref>

Atkins was buried at Harpeth Hills Memory Gardens in Nashville.<ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=23366 Chet Atkins at Find A Grave.] Accessed November 24, 2010</ref>

A stretch of [[Interstate 185 (Georgia)|Interstate 185]] in southwest [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (between [[LaGrange, Georgia|LaGrange]] and [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]]) is named "Chet Atkins Parkway".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ganet.org/services/leg/ShowBillPre.cgi?year=1997&filename=1997/HR245.passed |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050128185210/http://www.ganet.org/services/leg/ShowBillPre.cgi?year=1997&filename=1997/HR245.passed |archivedate=January 28, 2005 |title=Chet Atkins Parkway bill resolution. |accessdate=January 9, 2012}}</ref> This stretch of interstate runs through Fortson, GA where Atkins spent much of his childhood.

In 2002, Atkins was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name="RockHall" /> His award was presented by [[Marty Stuart]] and [[Brian Setzer]] and accepted by Atkins's grandson, Jonathan Russell. The following year, Atkins ranked No.28 in ''[[Country Music Television|CMT]]'s 40 Greatest Men of Country Music''.

At the age of 13, jazz guitarist [[Earl Klugh]] was captivated watching Atkins's guitar playing on ''The [[Perry Como]] Show.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalostate.edu/pac/season/klugh.asp |title=Performing Arts Center, Buffalo State University |publisher=Buffalostate.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-02-27}}</ref> Similarly he was an extremely big influence on [[Doyle Dykes]]. Atkins also inspired Drexl Jonez and [[Tommy Emmanuel]].<ref>[http://www.tommyemmanuel.com/bio/ Tommy Emmanuel official website biography.] Retrieved September 2009.</ref>

[[Clint Black]]'s album "[[Nothin' but the Taillights]]" includes the song "Ode to Chet," which includes the lines "'Cause I can win her over like Romeo did Juliet, if I can only show her I can almost pick that legato lick like '''Chet'''" and "It'll take more than [[Mel Bay]] 1, 2, & 3 if I'm ever gonna play like '''CGP'''." Atkins plays guitar on the track. At the end of the song Black and Atkins have a brief conversation.

Chet's song Jam Man is currently used in commercials for Esurance.

The opening guitar licks to the [[Miranda Lambert]] song [[Only Prettier]] sound very similar to Chet Atkins's guitar picking style.

In 1967, a tribute song called "Chet's Tune" was produced for his birthday, with contributions by a long list of RCA/Victor artists including Eddy Arnold, Connie Smith, Jerry Reed, Willie Nelson, Hank Snow, and others. The song was written by Nashville songwriter [[Cy Coben]], a friend of Atkins. The single reached No.&nbsp;38 on the country charts.<ref>Billboard, June 3, 1967, p. 41</ref><ref>Chet Atkins in Three Dimensions: 50 Years of Legendary Guitar, Volume 1, John McClellan and Deyan Bratic, Mel Bay Publications, Pacific, MO, p. 47-9</ref>

In 2009, [[Steve Wariner]] released an album entitled ''My Tribute to Chet Atkins''.  One song from that record, "Producer's Medley", featured Wariner's recreation of several very famous songs which Chet Atkins both produced and performed on.  In 2010, "Producer's Medley" won the Grammy for Best Country Instrumental Performance.
