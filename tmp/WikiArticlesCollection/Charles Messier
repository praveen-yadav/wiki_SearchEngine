'''Charles Messier''' (26 June 1730 – 12 April 1817) was a French [[astronomy|astronomer]] most notable for publishing an [[astronomical catalog]]ue consisting of [[nebula]]e and [[star cluster]]s that came to be known as the 110 "[[Messier object]]s". The purpose of the catalogue was to help astronomical observers, in particular [[comet]] hunters such as himself, distinguish between permanent and transient visually diffuse objects in the sky.

==Biography==
Messier was born in [[Badonviller]] in the [[Lorraine (région)|Lorraine]] region of France, being the tenth of twelve children of Françoise B. Grandblaise and Nicolas Messier, a [[Court usher]]. Six of his brothers and sisters died while young and in 1741, his father died. Charles' interest in astronomy was stimulated by the appearance of the spectacular, [[C/1743 X1|great six-tailed comet]] in 1744 and by an annular [[solar eclipse]] visible from his hometown on 25 July 1748.

In 1751 he entered the employ of [[Joseph Nicolas Delisle]], the astronomer of the [[French Navy]], who instructed him to keep careful records of his observations. Messier's first documented observation was that of the [[Transit of Mercury|Mercury transit]] of 6 May 1753.

In 1764, he was made a fellow of the [[Royal Society]], in 1769, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], and on 30 June 1770, he was elected to the [[French Academy of Sciences]].

Messier discovered 13 comets&nbsp;:<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080716110006/http://www.comethunter.de/cat2002/com_disc.txt Maik Meyer. Catalog of comet discoveries]</ref>

Messier is buried in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]], Paris, in Section 11. The grave is fairly plain and faintly inscribed, and while it is not on most maps of the cemetery, it can be found near the grave of [[Frédéric Chopin]], slightly to the west and directly north, and behind the small mausoleum of the jeweller [[Abraham-Louis Breguet]].

Messier's occupation as a [[comet]] hunter led him to continually come across fixed diffuse objects in the night sky which could be mistaken for comets (they are known today to be [[galaxies]], [[nebula]]e, and [[star cluster]]s). He compiled a [[List of Messier objects|list of them]],<ref>

Messier did his observing with 100 mm (four inch) [[refracting telescope]] from Hôtel de Cluny (now the [[Musée national du Moyen Âge]]), in [[Paris]], [[France]]. The list he compiled contains only objects found in the sky area he could observe: from the north [[celestial pole]] to a celestial latitude of about −35.7° and are not organized scientifically by object type, or even by location.

The first version of Messier's catalogue contained 45 objects and was published in 1774 in the journal of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in Paris. The final version of the catalogue was published in 1781, in ''Connoissance des Temps for 1784''.<ref>Charles Messier, 1781. Catalogue des Nébuleuses & des amas d'Étoiles.

On several occasions between 1921 and 1966, astronomers and historians discovered evidence of another seven objects that were observed either by Messier or by Méchain, shortly after the final version was published. These seven objects, [[Messier 104|M104]] through [[Messier 110|M110]], are accepted by astronomers as "official" Messier objects.

The objects' Messier designations, from [[Crab Nebula|M1]] to [[Messier 110|M110]], still are in use by professional and [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] today and their relative brightness makes them popular objects in the amateur astronomical community.

==Legacy==
The crater [[Messier (crater)|Messier]] on the [[Moon]] and the [[asteroid]] [[7359 Messier]] were named in his honor.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schmadel |first=Lutz D.|authorlink=Lutz D.
