[[File:Red Wine Glass.jpg|thumb|upright|A "large" (250&nbsp;ml) glass of 12%&nbsp;ABV red wine has about three units of alcohol. A "medium" (175&nbsp;ml) glass, such as the one shown, has about two units.<ref group=Note>Even though the sizes of wine glasses are defined in UK law, the terms "large", "medium", "standard" etc are not defined in law.</ref>]]

'''Units of alcohol''' are a measure of the volume of pure [[ethanol|alcohol]] in an [[alcoholic beverage]]. They are used in some countries as
a guideline for alcohol consumption.

One unit of alcohol is defined as 10 [[litre|millilitres]] (7.9 [[grams]]) in the United Kingdom,<ref>{{cite web|title=Drinkaware|url=http://www.drinkaware.co.uk/tips-and-tools/drink-diary/}}</ref> and as 12.7 [[litre|millilitres]] (10 [[grams]]) in Australia. In both countries, a so-called [[standard drink]] contains one unit of alcohol (according to the country’s own definition). The definition of a "standard drink" varies significantly in other countries.

In the United Kingdom, the number of units contained in a typical serving of an alcoholic beverage is publicised and printed on bottles.

In one hour, an average healthy adult can [[Metabolism|metabolize]] about 75% of an Australian unit of alcohol or 95% of a United Kingdom unit.{{Citation needed|reason=Actual link to a medical study showing that an average healthy adult uses up one unit in an hour.|date=June 2011}}

== Formulae ==
The number of UK units of alcohol in a drink can be determined by multiplying <var>the volume of the drink (in millilitres)</var> by its <var>percentage [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]]</var>, and dividing by 1000.

For example, one [[Imperial units|imperial]] [[pint]] (568 ml) of beer at 4% ABV contains:

<math>\frac{568\mbox{ ml} \times 4}{1000} {{=}} 2.3\mbox{ units}</math>

The formula uses {{math|<var>ml ÷ 1000</var>}}. This results in exactly one unit per percentage point per litre, of any alcoholic beverage.

Since 4% can be expressed as .04, {{math|.04 × 568 ml}} gives the amount of alcohol in terms of ml—which, when divided by {{math|10}}, shows the number of units.

When the volume of an alcoholic drink is shown in [[centilitre]]s, determining the number of units in a drink is as simple as <var>volume</var> × <var>percentage</var> (converted into a fraction of 1).

Thus, 75 centilitres of wine (the contents of a standard wine bottle) at 12% [[ABV]] contain:

<math>75 \times 0.12 {{=}} 9\mbox{ units}</math>

== Quantities ==
It is often stated that a unit of alcohol is supplied by a small glass of wine, half a pint of beer, or a single measure of spirits.<ref>{{cite web

The advent of [[smartphone]]s has led to the creation of [[Mobile app|apps]] which inform consumers of the number of units contained in an alcoholic drink.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Alculator|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_pking30.The_Alculator_Ad&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImFwcGludmVudG9yLmFpX3BraW5nMzAuVGhlX0FsY3VsYXRvcl9BZCJd}}</ref>

=== Beers ===
* A half pint (284 ml) of [[beer]] with 3.5% ABV contains almost exactly one unit; however, most beers are stronger. In pubs in the United Kingdom, beers generally range from 3.5%–5.5% ABV, and continental lagers start at around 5% ABV. A pint of such lager (e.g., 568 ml at 5.2%) contains almost 3 units of alcohol<ref>The volume of the drink in litres multiplied by its percentage strength in ABV give the number of units. In this case, {{nowrap|0.568 × 5.2 gives 2.95}}, i.e.,  almost 3 units.</ref> rather than the oft-quoted 2 units.
* Stronger beer (6%–12%) may contain 2 units or more per half pint.
* A half litre (500 ml) of standard [[lager]] or [[ale]] (5%) contains 2.5 units.
* One litre (1000 ml) of typical [[Oktoberfest]] beer (5.5%–6%) contains 5.5–6 units of alcohol.

=== Wines ===
* A medium glass (175 ml) of 12% ABV [[wine]] contains around two units of alcohol. However, British pubs and restaurants often supply larger quantities (large glass ≈ 250 ml), which contain 3 units. Red wine may have a higher alcohol content (on average 12.5%, sometimes up to 16%).
* A 750 ml bottle of 12% ABV wine contains 9 units. Some [[port wine]]s may contain 20% ABV or more, which is 15 units of alcohol per bottle.
* A 750 ml bottle of 14.5% ABV wine contains 10.88 units.

=== Fortified wines ===
* A small glass (50 ml) of [[sherry]], [[fortified wine]], or cream liqueur (≈20% ABV) contains about one unit.

=== Spirits ===
* Most [[Distilled beverage|spirits]] sold in the [[United Kingdom]] have 40% ABV or slightly less. In [[Great Britain]], a single pub measure (25 ml) of a spirit contains one unit.

* However, a larger 35ml measure is increasingly used (and in particular is standard in [[Northern Ireland]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}), which contains 1.4 units of alcohol.

=== Alcopops ===
* Most [[alcopops]] contain 1.4–1.5 units per bottle. For example, a normal 275ml bottle of [[WKD Original Vodka|WKD]] contains 1.4 units,<ref name="% volume of wkd">{{cite web | url=http://www.qfak.com/livelihood/food_drink/?id=b158893#.UXvAYaKG2So | title=Question:- "How much alcohol is there in WKD vodka blue?" | accessdate=2013-04-27}}</ref> whereas [[Bacardi Breezer]] and [[Smirnoff Ice]] both contain 1.5 units of alcohol. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Limits ==
{{Main|Recommended maximum intake of alcoholic beverages}}

Since 1995 the UK government has advised that regular consumption of 3–4 units a day for men, or 2–3 units a day for women, would not pose significant health risks, but that consistently drinking four or more units a day (men), or three or more units a day (women), is not advisable. <ref>{{cite web

Previously (from 1992 until 1995), the advice was that men should drink no more than 21 units per week, and women no more than 14.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drinkaware.co.uk/facts/factsheets/health-fact-sample-2 |title=Health Effects of Alcohol |publisher=Drinkaware.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref> (The difference between the sexes was due to the typically lower weight and water-to-body-mass ratio of women.) This was changed because a government study showed that many people were in effect "saving up" their units and using them at the end of the week, a phenomenon referred to as [[binge drinking]].{{Citation needed|date= October 2007}} [[The Times]] reported in October 2007 that these limits had been "plucked out of the air" and had no scientific basis.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/article2697975.ece Drink limits ‘useless’], The Times, 20 October 2007</ref>
<ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/26/alcohol-drinking-guidelines-studies The great alcohol myth], The Guardian, 26 January 2009</ref>

An international study<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kanis JA |title=Alcohol intake as a risk factor for fracture |journal=Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=737–42 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=15455194 |doi=10.1007/s00198-004-1734-y |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Johansson H |author3=Johnell O |display-authors=3 |last4=Oden |first4=Anders |last5=Laet |first5=Chris |last6=Eisman |first6=John A. |last7=Pols |first7=Huibert |last8=Tenenhouse |first8=Alan}}</ref> of almost 6,000 men and 11,000 women found that persons who reported that they drank more than 2 units of alcohol a day had an increased risk of fractures compared to non-drinkers.  For example, those who drank over 3 units a day had nearly twice the risk of a hip fracture.
