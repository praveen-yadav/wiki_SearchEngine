In chemistry, a '''carbonate''' is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[carbonic acid]], characterized by the presence of the '''carbonate ion''', {{chem|CO|3|2-}}.  The name may also mean an [[ester]] of carbonic acid, an organic compound containing the '''carbonate [[functional group|group]]''' C(=O)(O&ndash;)<sub>2</sub>.

The term is also used as a verb, to describe [[carbonation]]: the process of raising the concentrations of carbonate and [[bicarbonate]] ions in water to produce [[carbonated water]] and other carbonated beverages — either by the addition of [[carbon dioxide]] gas under pressure, or by dissolving carbonate or bicarbonate salts into the water.

In [[geology]] and [[mineralogy]], the term "carbonate" can refer both to [[carbonate minerals]] and [[carbonate rock]] (which is made of chiefly carbonate minerals), and both are dominated by the carbonate ion, CO{{su|b=3|p=2−}}.  Carbonate minerals are extremely varied and ubiquitous in chemically precipitated [[sedimentary rock]].  The most common are [[calcite]] or [[calcium carbonate]], CaCO<sub>3</sub>, the chief constituent of [[limestone]] (as well as the main component of [[mollusc]] shells and [[coral]] skeletons); [[dolomite]], a calcium-magnesium carbonate CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>; and [[siderite]], or [[iron]](II) carbonate, FeCO<sub>3</sub>, an important [[iron ore]].  [[Sodium carbonate]] ("soda" or "natron") and [[potassium carbonate]] ("potash") have been used since antiquity for cleaning and preservation, as well as for the manufacture of [[glass]].  Carbonates are widely used in industry, e.g. in iron smelting, as a raw material for [[Portland cement]] and [[lime (mineral)|lime]] manufacture, in the composition of [[ceramic glaze]]s, and more.

==Structure and bonding==

The carbonate ion is the simplest [[oxocarbon anion]].  It consists of one [[carbon]] atom surrounded by three [[oxygen]] atoms, in a [[trigonal planar]] arrangement, with ''D''<sub>3h</sub> [[Molecular symmetry#Point Group|molecular symmetry]]. It has a molecular mass of 60.01 [[dalton (unit)|daltons]] and carries a negative two [[formal charge]].  It is the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]] of the [[bicarbonate|hydrogen carbonate (bicarbonate)]] ion, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, which is the conjugate base of H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, carbonic acid.

The [[Lewis structure]] of the carbonate ion has two (long) single bonds to negative oxygen atoms, and one short double bond to a neutral oxygen

[[File:Carbonate-ion-localised-2D.png|100px|Simple, localised Lewis structure of the carbonate ion]]

This structure is incompatible with the observed symmetry of the ion, which implies that the three bonds are equally long and that the three oxygen atoms are equivalent.  As in the case of the [[isoelectronic]] [[nitrate]] ion, the symmetry can be achieved by a [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] between three structures:

[[File:Carbonate-ion-resonance-2D.png|400px|Resonance structures of the carbonate ion]]

This resonance can be summarized by a model with fractional bonds and [[delocalization|delocalized]] charges:

==Chemical properties==
Metal carbonates generally decompose on heating, liberating carbon dioxide from the long term carbon cycle to the short term carbon cycle and leaving behind an oxide of the metal.  This process is called [[calcination]], after ''calx'', the Latin name of [[quicklime]] or [[calcium oxide]], CaO, which is obtained by roasting limestone in a [[lime kiln]].

A carbonate salt forms when a positively charged ion, {{chem|M|+}}, attaches to the negatively charged oxygen atoms of the ion, forming an ionic [[chemical compound|compound]]:

:2 {{chem|M|+}} + {{chem|C|O|3|2-}} → {{chem|M|2|C|O|3}}

:{{chem|M|2+}} + {{chem|C|O|3|2−}} → {{chem|M|C|O|3}}

:2 {{chem|M|3+}} + 3 {{chem|C|O|3|2-}} → {{chem|M|2|(|C|O|3|)|3}}

Most carbonate salts are [[solubility|insoluble]] in [[water]] at [[standard temperature and pressure]], with [[solubility constant]]s of less than 1×10<sup>−8</sup>. Exceptions include [[lithium carbonate|lithium]], [[sodium carbonate|sodium]], [[potassium carbonate|potassium]] and [[ammonium carbonate|ammonium]] carbonates, as well as many [[uranium carbonate]]s.

In [[aqueous solution]], carbonate, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, and carbonic acid exist together in a [[chemical equilibrium|dynamic equilibrium]]. In strongly basic conditions, the carbonate ion predominates, while in weakly basic conditions, the [[bicarbonate]] ion is prevalent. In more acid conditions, aqueous [[carbon dioxide]], {{chem|C|O|2}}(aq), is the main form, which, with water, {{chem|H|2|O}}, is in equilibrium with carbonic acid - the equilibrium lies strongly towards carbon dioxide. Thus [[sodium carbonate]] is basic, [[sodium bicarbonate]] is weakly basic, while carbon dioxide itself is a weak acid.  Note that although the carbonate salts of most metals are insoluble in water, the same is not true of the bicarbonate salts. This equilibrium between carbonate, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide and carbonic acid in water can, under changing temperature or pressure conditions, and in the presence of metal ions with insoluble carbonates, result in formation of insoluble compounds. This is responsible for the buildup of scale inside pipes caused by [[hard water]].

[[Carbonated water]] is formed by dissolving {{chem|C|O|2}} in water under pressure.  When the partial pressure of {{chem|C|O|2}} is reduced, for example when a can of soda is opened, the equilibrium for each of the forms of carbonate (carbonate, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, and carbonic acid) shifts until the concentration of {{chem|C|O|2}} in the solution is equal to the solubility of CO<sub>2</sub> at that temperature and pressure.  In living systems an enzyme, [[carbonic anhydrase]], speeds the interconversion of CO<sub>2</sub> and carbonic acid.

==Organic carbonates==
{{main|Carbonate ester}}
In [[organic chemistry]] a carbonate can also refer to a [[functional group]] within a larger molecule that contains a carbon atom bound to three oxygen atoms, one of which is double bonded. These compounds are also known as organocarbonates or carbonate esters, and have the general formula ROCOOR′, or RR′CO<sub>3</sub>. Important organocarbonates include [[dimethyl carbonate]], the cyclic compounds [[ethylene carbonate]] and [[propylene carbonate]], and the phosgene replacement, [[triphosgene]].

==Biological significance==
It works as a [[buffer solution|buffer]] in the blood as follows:
when pH is too low, the concentration of hydrogen ions is too high, so one exhales CO<sub>2</sub>. This will cause the equation to shift left, essentially decreasing the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions, causing a more basic pH.

When pH is too high, the concentration of hydrogen ions in the blood is too low, so the kidneys excrete bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>).  This causes the equation to shift right, essentially increasing the concentration of hydrogen ions, causing a more acidic pH.

There are 3 important reversible reactions that control the above pH balance.<ref>http://www.scifun.org/chemweek/BioBuff/BioBuffers.html</ref>

1. H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(aq) {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup>(aq) +  HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(aq)

2. H<sub>2</sub></sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(aq) {{eqm}} CO<sub>2</sub>(aq)  + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

3. CO<sub>2</sub>(aq) {{eqm}} CO<sub>2</sub>(g)

Exhaled CO<sub>2</sub>(g) depletes CO<sub>2</sub>(aq) which in turn consumes H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> causing the aforementioned shift left in the first reaction by [[Le Chatelier's principle]].  By the same principle when the pH is too high, the kidneys excrete bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) into urine as urea via the Urea Cycle (aka the Krebs-Henseleit Ornithine Cycle).  By removing the bicarbonate more H<sup>+</sup> is generated from carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) which come from CO<sub>2</sub>(g) produced by [[cellular respiration]].

==Presence outside Earth==
It is generally thought that the presence of carbonates in [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is strong evidence for the presence of liquid water.  Recent observations of the [[Planetary nebula]] [[NGC 6302]] shows evidence for carbonates in space,<ref>Kemper, F., Molster, F.J., Jager, C. and Waters, L.B.F.M. (2002) The mineral composition and spatial distribution of the dust ejecta of NGC 6302.  ''Astronomy & Astrophysics'' '''394''', 679-690.</ref> where aqueous alteration similar to that on Earth is unlikely. Other minerals have been proposed which would fit the observations.

Significant [[Carbonates on Mars|carbonate deposits]] have not been found on Mars via remote sensing or in situ missions, even though Martian meteorites contain small amounts. Groundwater may have existed at both [[Gusev crater|Gusev]]<ref>Squyres et al., (2007) [http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1139045 doi 10.1126/science.1139045]</ref> and [[Meridiani Planum]].<ref>Squyres et al., (2006) [http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JE002771 doi 10.1029/2006JE002771]</ref>
