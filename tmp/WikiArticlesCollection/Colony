In [[politics]] and [[history]], a '''colony''' is a [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] under the immediate political control of a [[Sovereign state|state]], distinct from the home territory of the sovereign. For [[colonies in antiquity]], [[city-state]]s would often found their own colonies. Some colonies were historically countries, while others were territories without definite statehood from their inception. The  [[metropolis|metropolitan]] state is the state that owns the colony. In [[Ancient Greece]], the city that founded a colony was called the metropolis.  Mother country is a reference to the metropolitan state from the point of view of citizens who live in its colony. There is a [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]].

Unlike a [[puppet state]] or [[satellite state]], a colony has no independent international representation, and its top-level administration is under direct control of the metropolitan state.

The term ''informal colony'' is used by some historians to refer to a country under the ''de facto'' control of another state, although this term is often contentious.


==Definitions==
The word Colony comes from the Latin word colōnia. This in turn derives from the word [[Colonus (person)|colōnus]], which means colonist but also implies a farmer. [[Cologne]] is an example of a settlement preserving this etymology. Other, less obvious settlements that began as Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] include cities from [[Belgrade]] to [[York]]. A tell-tale sign of a settlement once being a Roman Colony is a city centre with a grid pattern.<ref>{{cite book|author=James S. Jeffers|title=The Greco-Roman world of the New Testament era: exploring the background of early Christianity|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YGmKaXiUDiYC|year=1999|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-1589-0|pages=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=YGmKaXiUDiYC&pg=PA52 52–53]}}</ref> The terminology is taken from architectural analogy, where a column pillar is beneath the (often stylized) head [[Capital (architecture)|capital]], which is also a biological analog of the body as subservient beneath the controlling head (with 'capital' coming from the Latin ''caput'', meaning 'head'). So colonies are not independently self-controlled, but rather are controlled from a separate entity that serves the capital function.

Roman colonies first appeared when the Romans conquered neighbouring [[Ancient peoples of Italy|italic peoples]]. These were small farming settlements that appeared when the Romans had subdued an enemy in war. A colony could take many forms, as a trade outpost or a military base in enemy territory, but its original definition as a settlement created by people migrating from a home territory became the modern definition.

* '''[[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]]''': a colony of Portugal since the 15th century. Independent since 1822.
* '''[[Canada]]''': colonised by first [[France]], as [[New France]] (1534-1763), then [[Canada under British rule (1763–1867)|under British rule (1763–1867)]], before achieving [[Canadian Confederation|Dominion status]].
* '''[[Belgian Congo|Congo]]''':  a colony of [[Belgium]] from 1908 to 1960.

* '''[[Hong Kong]]''' was a British colony from 1841 to 1997. Is now a [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[China]].
* '''[[India]]''' since the 15th century until 1961, parts of modern [[India]] belonged to [[Portugal]] and were collectively known as '''[[Portuguese India]]'''. Parts of India were also under the direct control of the government of the [[United Kingdom]] between 1858 and 1947. ''See also [[Crown colony]].''
* '''[[Indonesia]]''' was a Dutch colony for 350 years, from 1600 to 1945/49, occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945.
* '''[[Jamaica]]''' was part of the [[Spanish West Indies]] in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Became a British colony in 1655, then gained its independence in 1962.

* '''[[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]''': a colony of Portugal since the 15th century. Independent since 1975.
* '''[[Philippines]]''', previously a colony of Spain from 1521{{#tag:Ref|[[Ferdinand Magellan]] claimed the Philippine Islands for Spain in 1521, but it can be argued that Spain's legitimate sovereignty over the islands commenced following a popular referendum in 1599.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Damaso|last1=De Lario|first2=Dámaso|last2=de Lario Ramírez|title=Re-shaping the world: Philip II of Spain and his time|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8r8eIuAJpTAC|year=2008|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-556-7|chapter=Philip II and the "Philippine Referendum" of 1599|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=8r8eIuAJpTAC&pg=PA93}}</ref>}} to 1898 as part of the [[Spanish East Indies]], was a colony of the United States from 1898 to 1946. Achieved [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]] status in 1935. During [[World War II]] between 1942 and 1945, it was occupied by the Japanese forces.
* '''[[Sri Lanka]]''' a British colony from 1815 to 1948. Known as [[Ceylon]]. Was a [[British Dominion]] until 1972.
* '''[[Taiwan]]''' was originally inhabited by [[indigenous peoples]] closely related linguistically, culturally and genetically to the [[Filipino people|Filipino]] people and more distantly to the [[Polynesians]]. In the 17th century, most of southern Taiwan was a [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch colony]] for 37 years before [[Koxinga]], an anti-Manchu and [[Ming Dynasty|Ming loyalist]]  invaded the island and defeated the Dutch, replacing Dutch colonial rule with Chinese colonial [[Kingdom of Tungning|rule]].<ref name="gutenberg-e.org">[http://www.gutenberg-e.org/andrade/conclusion.html Tonio Andrade, How Taiwan Became Chinese: Dutch, Spanish, and Han Colonization in the Seventeenth Century, Columbia University Press.]</ref> In 1683, the [[Qing Dynasty]] defeated Koxinga's descendants and [[Taiwan under Qing Dynasty rule|control]] of the island passed to the Qing rulers. Taiwan was made a prefecture of [[Fujian Province]] in 1684, and that status continued until 1885, when it was elevated to become a province in its own right. The Qing were "reluctant colonizers" but became convinced of Taiwan's value to their empire due to the threat the island posed if used as a base by rival powers, and by its abundant resources.<ref name="gutenberg-e.org"/> In 1895, the Qing Dynasty ceded Taiwan to the [[Empire of Japan]] following its defeat in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. After the defeat of Japan in World War II, Taiwan has been administered by the [[Government of the Republic of China|Republic of China]], which has been based there following its retreat from mainland China after losing a civil war to the [[Communist Party of China|communists]] in 1949.
* The '''[[United States]]''', originally thirteen distinct English (or British, if founded after the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union of 1707]]) [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]] in [[British America]]. The [[Colony of Virginia]], later to become the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Virginia]], [[Kentucky]] and [[West Virginia]], was the first of the thirteen colonies and was under English and then British rule from 1607 until 1783, at least nominally. The United States also founded their own colonies in both the Atlantic and Pacific regions, such as [[Fort Madison, Nuku Hiva|Madisonville]] on the island of [[Nuku Hiva]] in 1813 and [[Monrovia]] in 1821.

==Current colonies==

There is no universally agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a "colony", given that [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] have varying degrees of autonomy and political power in the affairs of the controlling state.  The [[Special Committee on Decolonization]] maintains the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]], which identifies areas the United Nations (though not without controversy) believes are colonies.
