What is now California was first settled by [[Indigenous peoples of California|various Native American tribes]] before being explored by a number of European expeditions throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. It was then claimed by the [[Spanish Empire]] as part of [[Alta California]] in the larger territory of [[New Spain]]. Alta California became a part of [[Mexico]] in 1821 following its successful [[Mexican independence|war for independence]], but would later be ceded to the United States in 1848 after the [[Mexican-American War]]. The western portion of Alta California was soon organized as the State of California, which was admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850. The [[California Gold Rush]] starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic change, with large scale immigration from the U.S. and abroad and an accompanying economic boom.

California's diverse geography ranges from the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] in the west, to the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in the east – from the [[Sequoia sempervirens|Redwood]]–[[Douglas-fir]] forests of the northwest, to the [[Mojave Desert]] areas in the southeast. The center of the state is dominated by the [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]], a major agricultural area. California contains both the highest and lowest points in the [[contiguous United States]] ([[Mount Whitney]] and [[Death Valley]]), and has the [[List of U.S. states by coastline|3rd longest coastline]] of all states (after Alaska and [[Florida]]). Earthquakes are a common occurrence because of the state's location along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]: about 37,000 are recorded annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seismo.berkeley.edu/faq/rate_of_seism.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Seismo.berkeley.edu |accessdate=April 22, 2011}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Main|Origin of the name California}}

The word ''California'' originally referred to the entire region composed of the [[Baja California peninsula]] of Mexico, the current U.S. states of California, [[Nevada]], and [[Utah]], and parts of [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Texas]] and [[Wyoming]].

The name ''California'' is most commonly believed to have derived from a fictional paradise peopled by [[Black People|Black]] [[Amazons]] and ruled by Queen [[Calafia]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Putnam|first=Ruth|editor=Herbert Ingram Priestley|title=California: the name|url=http://www.archive.org/details/cu31924008278347|year=1917|publisher=University of California|location=Berkeley|pages=356–361|chapter=Appendix A: Etymology of the Word "California": Surmises and Usage}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Vogeley|first=Nancy|date=April 20, 2001|title=How Chivalry Formed the Myth of California|journal=Modern Language Quarterly|publisher=University of Washington|volume=62|issue=2|pages=165–188|url=http://mlq.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/62/2/165|doi=10.1215/00267929-62-2-165}}</ref> The story of Calafia is recorded in a 1510 work ''[[Las sergas de Esplandián|The Adventures of Esplandián]]'', written as a sequel to ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'' by Spanish adventure writer [[Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo]].<ref name=cpn>Gudde, Erwin G. and William Bright. 2004.

{{Quotation|Know ye that at the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California, very close to that part of the Terrestrial Paradise, which was inhabited by black women without a single man among them, and they lived in the manner of Amazons. They were robust of body with strong passionate hearts and great virtue. The island itself is one of the wildest in the world on account of the bold and craggy rocks. | Chapter CLVII of ''[[Las sergas de Esplandián|The Adventures of Esplandián]]''<ref>Putnam, 1917, [http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924008278347#page/n23/mode/1up/ p. 306]</ref>}}

The name ''California'' is the fifth oldest surviving European place-name in the US and was applied to what is now the southern tip of Baja California peninsula as the ''[[Island of California]]'' by a Spanish expedition led by Diego de Becerra and [[Fortún Ximénez]], who landed there in 1533 at the behest of [[Hernán Cortés]].{{#tag:ref| Florida, [[Dry Tortugas]], [[Cape Canaveral]], and [[Appalachia]] appeared earlier, ...

California is the [[List of U.S. states by area|3rd largest state in the United States]] in area, after [[Alaska]] and [[Texas]].<ref name="2000 population and housing">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/phc3-us-pt1.pdf |format=PDF |title=2000 Census of Population and Housing|year=2004 |month=April |publisher=[[US Census Bureau]] |page=29|accessdate=December 25, 2009}}</ref>

In the middle of the state lies the [[California Central Valley]], bounded by the [[Pacific Coast Ranges|coastal mountain ranges]] in the west, the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] to the east, the [[Cascade Range]] in the north and the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] in the south. The Central Valley is California's agricultural heartland.

Divided in two by the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta]], the northern portion, the [[Sacramento Valley]] serves as the watershed of the [[Sacramento River]], while the southern portion, the [[San Joaquin Valley]] is the watershed for the [[San Joaquin River]]; both areas derive their names from the rivers that transit them. With dredging, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained sufficiently deep that several inland cities are [[seaport]]s.

The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta serves as a critical water supply hub for the state. Water is routed through an extensive network of canals and pumps out of the delta, that traverse nearly the length of the state, including the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project. Water from the Delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people, almost two-thirds of the state's population, and provides water to farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley. The [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] are located off the [[Southern California|southern]] [[South Coast (California)|coast]].

The Sierra Nevada (Spanish for "snowy range") includes the highest peak in the [[contiguous United States|contiguous 48 states]], [[Mount Whitney]], at {{convert|14505|ft|m}}.<ref name=Mount_Whitney>{{cite ngs|id=GT1811|designation=Whitney|accessdate=October 20, 2011}}</ref><ref name=USGS>{{cite web|url=http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html|title=Elevations and Distances in the United States|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|year=2001|accessdate=October 21, 2011}}</ref><ref name=NAVD88>Elevation adjusted to [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]].</ref>  The range embraces [[Yosemite Valley]], famous for its glacially carved domes, and [[Sequoia National Park]], home to the [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|giant sequoia]] trees, the largest living organisms on Earth, and the deep freshwater lake, [[Lake Tahoe]], the largest lake in the state by volume.

To the east of the Sierra Nevada are [[Owens Valley]] and [[Mono Lake]], an essential [[bird migration|migratory bird]] habitat. In the western part of the state is [[Clear Lake (California)|Clear Lake]], the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in California. Though Lake Tahoe is larger, it is divided by the California/Nevada border. The Sierra Nevada falls to Arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers, including [[Palisade Glacier]], the southernmost glacier in the United States.

Indeed, almost all of southeastern California is arid, hot desert, with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer. The southeastern border of California with Arizona is entirely formed by the [[Colorado River]], from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water.

Along the California coast are several major metropolitan areas, including [[Greater Los Angeles Area]], the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and the [[San Diego metropolitan area]].

As part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]], California is subject to [[tsunami]]s, [[flood]]s, droughts, [[Santa Ana winds]], [[wildfire]]s, [[landslide]]s on steep terrain, and has several [[volcanoes]]. It sees numerous [[List of earthquakes in California|earthquakes]] due to several faults, in particular the [[San Andreas Fault]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of California}}
[[File:Sherwin Range, Benton Crossing.jpg|thumb|Snow on the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in eastern California]]

[[File:North_LagunaBeachCA_photo_D_Ramey_Logan.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The coastline along [[Laguna Beach]] in Southern California.]]
California's climate varies from Mediterranean to [[subarctic climate|subarctic]].

Much of the state has a [[Mediterranean climate]], with cool, rainy winters and dry summers. The cool [[California Current]] offshore often creates summer [[fog]] near the coast. Farther inland, one encounters colder winters and hotter summers.

Northern parts of the state average higher annual rainfall than the south. California's mountain ranges influence the climate as well: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a [[temperate climate]], and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], have an [[alpine climate]] with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.

The east side of California's mountains produce a [[rain shadow]], creating expansive [[desert]]s. The higher elevation deserts of [[eastern California]] see hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the southern California mountains experience hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters. [[Death Valley]], a desert with large expanses below sea level, is considered the hottest location in North America; the highest temperature in the [[Western Hemisphere]], {{convert|134|°F|°C|0}}, was recorded there on July 10, 1913. The lowest temperature in California was {{convert|−45|°F}} in 1937 in [[Boca, California|Boca]].

===Ecology===
{{Main|Ecology of California}}
{{See also|Environment of California}}

California is one of the richest and most diverse parts of the world, and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities. California is part of the [[Nearctic ecozone]] and spans a number of terrestrial [[ecoregion]]s.<ref name="Checklist of the Scarabaeoidea of the Nearctic Realm">{{cite web|url=http://www.iscc.ca.gov/docs/CaliforniaInvasiveSpeciesList.pdf
|title=Checklist of the Scarabaeoidea of the Nearctic Realm|publisher=digitalcommons.unl.edu  (University of Nebraska State: Papers in Entomology)|year=2003|accessdate=October 5, 2010}}</ref>

California's large number of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species includes [[relict]] species, which have died out elsewhere, such as the Catalina Ironwood (''[[Lyonothamnus]] floribundus''). Many other endemics originated through differentiation or [[adaptive radiation]], whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the California lilac (''[[Ceanothus]]''). Many California endemics have become endangered, as urbanization, logging, [[overgrazing]], and the introduction of [[exotic species]] have encroached on their habitat.

===Flora and fauna===
California boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora: the [[giant sequoia|largest trees]], the [[coast redwood|tallest trees]], and the [[pinus longaeva|oldest trees]]. California's native grasses are [[perennial plant]]s.<ref name="Restoring Native Grasses">{{cite journal |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/may04/grass0504.htm |title=Restoring California's Native Grasses |journal=Agricultural Research magazine |author=David Elstein |month=May |year=2004 |volume= 52 |issue= 5 |page=17 |accessdate=December 25, 2009}}</ref> After European contact, these were generally replaced by [[invasive species]] of European annual grasses; and, in modern times, California's hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer.<ref name="The California Invasive Species List">{{cite web|url=http://www.iscc.ca.gov/docs/CaliforniaInvasiveSpeciesList.pdf

Because California has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain, the state has six life zones which are the lower Sonoran (desert); upper Sonoran (foothill regions and some coastal lands), transition (coastal areas and moist northeastern counties); and the Canadian, Hudsonian, and Arctic Zones, comprising the state's highest elevations.<ref name="California: flora and fauna">{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/states/California-Flora-and-fauna.html |title=California: flora and fauna|publisher=city-data.com |year=2010 |accessdate=September 7, 2010}}</ref>

Plant life in the dry climate of the lower Sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus, mesquite, and paloverde. The [[Yucca brevifolia|Joshua tree]] is found in the Mojave Desert. Flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of [[aster (genus)|asters]]. [[Fremont cottonwood]] and [[valley oak]] thrive in the Central Valley. The upper Sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt, characterized by forests of small shrubs, stunted trees, and herbaceous plants. [[Nemophila]], [[Lamiaceae|mint]], [[Phacelia]], [[viola (plant)|Viola]], and the California poppy ([[Eschscholzia californica]]) – the state flower – also flourish in this zone, along with the lupine, more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world.<ref name="California: flora and fauna"/>

The transition zone includes most of California's forests with the redwood ([[Sequoia sempervirens]]) and the "big tree" or giant sequoia ([[Sequoiadendron giganteum]]), among the oldest living things on earth (some are said to have lived at least 4,000 years). [[Tanbark oak]], [[California laurel]], [[Sugar Pine]], [[Arbutus|madrona]], broad-leaved maple, and [[Douglas-fir]] also grow here. Forest floors are covered with [[swordfern]], alumnroot, [[barrenwort]], and [[trillium]], and there are thickets of [[huckleberry]], [[azalea]], elder, and wild currant. Characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa, [[tulip]], and [[Lilium columbianum|tiger]] and [[Lilium pardalinum|leopard]] lilies.<ref name="Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl.">{{cite web|url=http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_1/sequoia/sempervirens.htm|title=Sequoia sempervirens (D.

The high elevations of the Canadian zone allow the [[Jeffrey Pine]], [[red fir]], and [[Lodgepole Pine]] to thrive. Brushy areas are abundant with dwarf [[manzanita]] and [[ceanothus]]; the unique [[Calvatia sculpta|Sierra puffball]] is also found here. Right below the timeberline, in the Hudsonian zone, the whitebark, foxtail, and silver pines grow. At about {{convert|10500|ft|m}}, begins the Arctic zone, a treeless region whose flora include a number of wildflowers, including [[Primula suffrutescens|Sierra primrose]], [[Yellow Columbine|yellow columbine]], [[Ranunculus|alpine buttercup]], and [[Dodecatheon alpinum|alpine shooting star]].<ref name="California: flora and fauna"/><ref name="Life Zones of the Central Sierra Nevada">{{cite web| url=http://www.sierrahistorical.org/archives/lifezones.html| title=Life Zones of the Central Sierra Nevada| publisher=sierrahistorical.org| accessdate=October 5, 2010}}</ref>

Common plants that have been introduced to the state include the [[eucalyptus]], [[acacia]], [[Schinus|pepper tree]], geranium, and [[Scotch broom]]. The species that are federally classified as endangered are the [[Erysimum capitatum|Contra Costa wallflower]], [[Oenothera deltoides subsp. howellii|Antioch Dunes evening primrose]], [[Tuctoria mucronata|Solano Grass]], [[Delphinium variegatum|San Clemente Island larkspur]], [[Cordylanthus maritimus|salt marsh bird's beak]], [[Arabis blepharophylla|McDonald's rock-cress]], and [[Dudleya traskiae|Santa Barbara Island Liveforever]]. {{As of|1997|12}}, 85 plant species were listed as threatened or endangered.<ref name="California: flora and fauna"/>

In the deserts of the lower Sonoran zone, the mammals include the [[jackrabbit]], [[kangaroo rat]], squirrel, and opossum. Common birds include the [[owl]], [[roadrunner]], [[Cactus Wren]], and various species of hawk. The area's reptilian life include the [[Crotalus cerastes|sidewinder viper]], [[desert tortoise]], and [[horned toad]]. The upper Sonoran zone boasts mammals such as the [[antelope]], [[Dusky-Footed Woodrat|brown-footed woodrat]], and [[Ring-tailed cat]]. Birds unique to this zone are the [[California Thrasher]], [[Psaltriparus minimus|bushtit]], and [[California Condor]].<ref name="California: flora and fauna"/><ref name="California Condor">{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/California_Condor/id |title=California Condor|publisher=The Cornell Lab of Ornithology |year=2009 |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}</ref><ref name="CalPhotos: Browse Mammal Common Names">{{cite web|url=http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/fauna/com-Mammal.html|title=CalPhotos: Browse Mammal Common Names|publisher=calphotos.berkeley.edu (BSCIT University of California, Berkeley) |date=October 2, 2010|accessdate=October 3, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Quail Ridge Reserve: UC Davis Natural Reserve System">{{cite web|url=http://nrs.ucdavis.edu/quail/natural/birds_bushtit.htm|title=Quail Ridge Reserve: UC Davis Natural Reserve System|publisher=nrs.ucdavis.edu (University of California at Davis: Natural Reserve System) |date=April 5, 2007|accessdate=October 5, 2010}}</ref>

In the transition zone, there are Colombian [[Black-tailed Deer]], [[American Black Bear|black bears]], [[gray fox]]es, [[cougar]]s, [[bobcat]]s, and [[Roosevelt elk]]. Reptiles such as the garter snakes and rattlesnakes inhabit the zone. In addition, amphibians such as the [[Proteidae|water puppy]] and [[Batrachoseps attenuatus|redwood salamander]] are common too. Birds such as the [[kingfisher]], chickadee, [[towhee]], and hummingbird thrive here as well.<ref name="California: flora and fauna"/><ref name="Black-tailed Deer of California">{{cite web|url=http://www.westernhunter.com/Pages/Vol02Issue24/blacktail.html|title=Black-tailed Deer of California|publisher=westernhunter.com|year=2000|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}</ref>

The Canadian zone mammals include the [[Mountain weasel]], [[Snowshoe hare]], and several species of chipmunks. Conspicuous birds include the [[Steller's Jay|blue-fronted jay]], [[Poecile|Sierra chickadee]]. Sierra [[Hermit Thrush]], [[water ouzel]], and [[Townsend's Solitaire]]. As one ascends into the Hudsonian zone, birds become scarcer. While the Sierra rosy finch is the only bird native to the high Arctic region, other bird species such as the hummingbird and [[Clark's Nutcracker]]. Principal mammals found in this region include the Sierra coney, [[White-tailed jackrabbit]], and the [[Bighorn Sheep]]. {{As of|2003|04}}, the Bighorn Sheep was listed as endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The fauna found throughout several zones are the [[mule deer]], coyote, [[mountain lion]], [[Northern Flicker]], and several species of hawk and sparrow.<ref name="California: flora and fauna"/>

Aquatic life in California thrives, from the state's mountain lakes and streams to the rocky Pacific coastline. Numerous trout species are found, among them [[Rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Golden trout|golden]], and [[Cutthroat trout|cutthroat]]. Migratory species of salmon are common as well. Deep-sea life forms include [[White seabass|sea bass]], [[yellowfin tuna]], [[barracuda]], and several types of whale. Native to the cliffs of northern California are seals, sea lions, and many types of shorebirds, including migratory species.<ref name="California: flora and fauna"/>

As of April 2003, 118 California animals were on the federal endangered list; 181 plants were listed as endangered or threatened. Endangered animals include the [[Vulpes macrotis|San Joaquin kitfox]], [[Aplodontia rufa nigra|Point Arena mountain beaver]], [[Pacific pocket mouse]], [[Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse]], [[Morro Bay kangaroo rat]] (and five other species of kangaroo rat), [[California vole#Subspecies|Amargosa vole]], [[California Least Tern]], [[California Condor]], [[Loggerhead Shrike]], [[Bell's Sparrow|San Clemente sage sparrow]], [[San Francisco garter snake]], five species of salamander, three species of chub, and two species of pupfish.

===Rivers===
{{Main|List of rivers of California}}

The vast majority of rivers in California are dammed as part of two massive water projects: the [[Central Valley Project]], providing water to the agricultural central valley, the [[California State Water Project]] diverting water to from northern to southern California. The state's coasts, rivers, and other bodies of water are regulated by the [[California Coastal Commission]].

The two most prominent rivers within California are the [[Sacramento River]] and the [[San Joaquin River]], which drain the Central Valley and the west slope of the Sierra Nevada and flow to the Pacific Ocean through [[San Francisco Bay]]. Several major tributaries feed into the Sacramento and the San Joaquin, including the [[Pit River]], the [[Tuolumne River]], and the [[Feather River]].

The [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]] and [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]] each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively, and the Eel River is the largest river in the state to remain in its natural un-dammed state. The [[Mojave River]] is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the [[Santa Ana River]] drains much of the [[Transverse Ranges]] as it bisects Southern California. Some other important rivers are the [[Klamath River]] and the [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity River]] in the far north coast, and the [[Colorado River]] on the southeast border with [[Arizona]].

[[File:Mission San Diego de Alcala in 1848.jpg|thumb|[[Mission San Diego de Alcalá]] drawn as it was in 1848. Established in 1769, it is the first of the California Missions established]]
Settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10,000 years, California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America. Various estimates of the native population range from 100,000 to 300,000, which was about one-third of all native Americans in what is now the United States.<ref>{{cite book |last=Starr |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Starr |title=California: A History |series=Modern Library Chronicles |volume=23 |year=2007 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |isbn=978-0-8129-7753-0 |page=13}}</ref> The [[Indigenous peoples of California]] included more than [[Classification of Native Americans#California|70 distinct groups]] of Native Americans, ranging from large, settled populations living on the coast to groups in the interior. California groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands, tribes, villages, and on the resource-rich coasts, large chiefdoms, such as the [[Chumash (tribe)|Chumash]], [[Pomo people|Pomo]] and [[Salinan]]. Trade, intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups.

The first European effort to explore the coast as far north as the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] was a Spanish sailing expedition, led by Portuguese captain [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]], in 1542. Some 37 years later English explorer [[Francis Drake]] also explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579. Spanish traders made unintended visits with the [[Manila Galleon]]s on their return trips from the [[Philippines]] beginning in 1565.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyzercreek.com/britannica.htm |title=Page 1580 of the 1778 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica (second edition) |publisher=Hyzercreek.com |date=July 15, 2011 |accessdate=October 28, 2011}}</ref> [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]] explored and mapped the coast of California in 1602 for [[New Spain]].

Finally, after the [[Portola expedition]] of 1769-70, Spanish [[missionaries]] began setting up 21 [[California Missions]] on or near the coast of [[Alta California|Alta (Upper)California]], beginning in San Diego. During the same period, Spanish military forces built several forts (''[[presidio]]s'') and three small towns (''pueblos''). Two of the pueblos grew into the cities of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].

In 1821 the [[Mexican War of Independence]] gave [[Mexico]] (including California) independence from Spain; for the next 25 years, [[Alta California]] remained a remote northern province of the nation of Mexico.

Cattle ranches, or ''[[Ranchos of California|ranchos]]'', emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California. After Mexican independence from Spain, the chain of missions became the property of the Mexican government and were [[secularized]] by 1834.<ref name=nps/> The ranchos developed under ownership by [[Californios]] (Spanish-speaking Californians) who had received land grants, and traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchants.

Beginning in the 1820s, trappers and settlers from the U.S. and Canada began to arrive in Northern California. These new arrivals used the [[Siskiyou Trail]], [[California Trail]], [[Oregon Trail]] and [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]] to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts surrounding California. In this period, [[Imperial Russia]] explored the California coast and established a trading post at [[Fort Ross]].

In between 1831 to 1836, California experienced a series of revolts against Mexico;<ref>{{cite book |last=Altman |first=Linda Jacobs |title=California |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rAgL-tgWOecC&lpg=PA117&dq=1836%20California%20revolt&pg=PA117#v=onepage&q=1836%20California%20revolt&f=false |accessdate=March 16, 2013 |year=2005 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn=978-0-7614-1737-8 |page=117 }}<br />{{cite book |title=Testimonios: Early California Through the Eyes of Women, 1815–1848 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DuvFpaRwJlgC&lpg=PA427&dq=1836%20California%20revolt&pg=PA425#v=onepage&q=1836%20California%20revolt&f=false |accessdate=March 16, 2013 |year=2006 |publisher=Heyday |isbn=978-1-59714-033-1 |page=425}}</ref> this culminated in the [[1836 California revolt]] lead by [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]], which ended after Mexico appointed him governor of the department.<ref>Starr, Kevin.

In 1846 settlers rebelled against Mexican rule during the [[Bear Flag Revolt]]. Afterwards, rebels raised the [[Bear Flag]] (featuring a bear, a star, a red stripe and the words "California Republic") at Sonoma. The Republic's first and only president was [[William B. Ide]],<ref name="William B. Ide Adobe SHP">{{cite web|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=458|title=William B. Ide Adobe SHP|publisher=California State Parks|accessdate=December 25, 2009}}</ref> who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revolt.

The California Republic was short lived; the same year marked the outbreak of the [[Mexican-American War]] (1846–1848). When Commodore [[John D. Sloat]] of the [[United States Navy]] sailed into [[Monterey Bay]] and began the military occupation of California by the United States, Northern California capitulated in less than a month to the U.S. forces. After a series of defensive battles in [[Southern California]], the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] was signed by the [[Californios]] on January 13, 1847, securing American control in California.

Following the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] that ended the war, the region was divided between Mexico and the U.S.; the western territory of Alta California, was to become the U.S. state of California, and [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], [[Colorado]] and [[Utah]] became U.S. Territories, while the lower region of California, the Baja Peninsula, remained in the possession of [[Mexico]].

In 1846 the non-native population of California was estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans down from about 300,000 prior to Hispanic settlement in 1769.<ref>Thomas J.

In subsequent decades, the native population was placed in reservations and rancherias, which were often very small and isolated and lacked adequate natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on them.<ref name="cabrillo1"/> As a result, the rise of California brought great hardship for the native inhabitants.

In 1849, the Constitutional Convention was first held in Monterey. Among the tasks was a decision on a location for the new state capital. The first legislative sessions were held in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] (1850–1851). Subsequent locations included [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] (1852–1853), and nearby [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] (1853–1854); these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well.

Initially, travel between California and the rest of the continental U.S. was time consuming and dangerous. A more direct connection came in 1869 with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] through [[Donner Pass]] in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Once completed, hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens came west, where new Californians were discovering that land in the state, if irrigated during the dry summer months, was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general. Vast expanses of wheat, other cereal crops, vegetable crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state's prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere.

Migration to California accelerated during the early-20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the [[Lincoln Highway]] and [[U.S. Route 66 (California)|Route 66]]. In the period from 1900 to 1965, the population grew from fewer than one million to become the most populous state in the Union. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported California's population as 6.0% Hispanic, 2.4% Asian, and 89.5% non-Hispanic white.<ref>{{cite web|title=California – Race and Hispanic Origin: 1850 to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html}}</ref> The [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and 1928 [[St. Francis Dam]] flood remain the deadliest in U.S history.<ref name="IIIMcNeill2004">{{cite book|author1=Shepard Krech, III|author2=J.

In order to meet the population's needs, major engineering feats like the [[California Aqueduct|California]] and [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]]s; the [[Oroville Dam|Oroville]] and [[Shasta Dam]]s; and the [[San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay]] and [[Golden Gate Bridge]]s were built across the state. The state government also adopted the [[California Master Plan for Higher Education]] in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education.

Meanwhile, attracted to the mild Mediterranean climate, cheap land, and the state's wide variety of geography, filmmakers established the [[studio system]] in Hollywood in the 1920s. California manufactured 8.7 percent of total United States military armaments produced during [[World War II]], ranking third (behind [[New York]] and [[Michigan]]) among the 48 states.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M.

California has long been a subject of interest in the public mind and has often been promoted by its boosters as a kind of paradise. In the early 20th century, fueled by the efforts of state and local boosters, many Americans saw the Golden State as an ideal resort destination, sunny and dry all year round with easy access to the ocean and mountains. In the 1960s, popular music groups such as [[The Beach Boys]] promoted the image of Californians as laid-back, tanned beach-goers.

The [[California Gold Rush]] of the 1850s is [[California Gold Rush#Longer-term effects|still seen as a symbol of California's economic style]], which tends to generate technology, social, entertainment, and economic fads and booms and related busts.

The largest religious denominations by number of adherents as a percentage of California's population in 2008 were the Catholic Church with 31 percent; Evangelical Protestants with 18 percent; and Mainline Protestants with 14 percent. Those unaffiliated with any religion represented 21 percent of the population.

The first priests to come to California were Roman Catholic missionaries from Spain. Roman Catholics founded [[California missions|21 missions along the California coast]], as well as the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco. California continues to have a large Roman Catholic population due to the large numbers of Mexicans and Central Americans living within its borders. California has twelve dioceses and two archdioceses, the [[Archdiocese of Los Angeles]] and the [[Archdiocese of San Francisco]], the former being the largest archdiocese in the United States.

A [[Pew Research Center]] survey revealed that California is somewhat less religious than the rest of the US: 62 percent of Californians say they are "absolutely certain" of their belief in God, while in the nation 71 percent say so. The survey also revealed 48 percent of Californians say religion is "very important," compared to 56 percent nationally.<ref name="Helfland 2008">{{cite news |last=Helfand |first=Duke |title= State has a relaxed view on religion – Survey finds Californians are less certain about the existence of God than others in the U.S |work=The Los Angeles Times | publisher= [[Tribune Company]] |date=June 24, 2008 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/24/local/me-faith24 |accessdate=December 27, 2009}}</ref>

All [[real property]] is taxable annually; the tax is based on the property's fair market value at the time of purchase or new construction. Property tax increases are capped at 2% per year (see [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]]).

Because it is the most populous U.S. state, California is one of the country's largest users of energy. However because of its high energy rates, conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centers and strong environmental movement, its ''per capita'' energy use is one of the smallest of any U.S. state.<ref>{{Cite news

As a result of the state's strong environmental movement, California has some of the most aggressive [[renewable energy]] goals in the United States, with a target for California to obtain a third of its electricity from renewables by 2020.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BG4YI20091217 California OKs new transmission for renewables] ''Reuters'', December 17, 2009.</ref> Currently, several [[solar power plants]] such as the [[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] facility are located in the [[Mojave Desert]].

Several dams across the state provide [[Hydroelectricity|hydro-electric power]].

The state's crude oil and natural gas deposits are located in the Central Valley and along the coast, including the large [[Midway-Sunset Oil Field]]. Natural gas-fired [[power plants]] typically account for more than one-half of State electricity generation.

California is also home to two major [[nuclear power]] plants: [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant|Diablo Canyon]] and [[San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station|San Onofre]]. However, voters banned the approval of new nuclear power plants since the late 1970s because of concerns over [[radioactive waste disposal]].<ref name="Doyle 2009">{{Cite news

California's vast terrain is connected by an extensive system of [[controlled-access highways]] ('freeways'), [[limited-access road]]s ('expressways'), and highways. California is known for its [[car culture]], giving California's cities a reputation for severe [[traffic congestion]]. Construction and maintenance of state roads and statewide transportation planning are primarily the responsibility of the [[California Department of Transportation]], nicknamed "Caltrans". The rapidly growing population of the state is straining all of its transportation networks, and California has some of the worst roads in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mieszkowski |first=Katharine |url=http://www.baycitizen.org/blogs/pulse-of-the-bay/read-while-you-are-waiting-traffic-clear |title=California Is Tops in Worst Roads – Pulse of the Bay |publisher=The Bay Citizen |date=September 2, 2010 |accessdate=April 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/9621456 | work=The Economist | title=A bridge too far gone | date=August 9, 2007}}</ref> The Reason Foundation's 19th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems ranked California's highways the third-worst of any state, with Alaska second, and Rhode Island first.<ref>http://reason.org/files/19th_annual_highway_report.pdf</ref>

The state has been a pioneer in road construction. One of the state's more visible landmarks, the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], was once the [[List of longest suspension bridge spans|longest suspension bridge main span]] in the world at {{convert|4200|ft|m}} when it opened in 1937. With its orange paint and panoramic views of the bay, this highway bridge is a popular tourist attraction and also accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists. The [[San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge]] (often abbreviated the "Bay Bridge"), completed in 1936, transports approximately 280,000 vehicles per day on two-decks. Its two sections meet at [[Yerba Buena Island]] through the world's largest diameter transportation bore tunnel, at {{convert|76|ft}} wide by {{convert|58|ft}} high.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/tollbridge/SFOBB/Sfobbfacts.html | title=The San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge Facts at a glance | publisher=[[California Department of Transportation]] | accessdate =April 5, 2012}}</ref> The [[Arroyo Seco Parkway]], connecting Los Angeles and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], opened in 1940 as the first freeway in the Western United States.<ref>{{cite news |last= Pool |first= Bob |title= Pasadena Freeway getting a new look and a new name |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 25, 2010 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/25/local/la-me-parkway-20100625 |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref> It was later extended south to the [[Four Level Interchange]] in downtown Los Angeles, regarded as the first [[stack interchange]] ever built.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/la-as-subject/navigating-the-stack-the-four-level-turns-58.html | title=L.A.'s Famous Four-Level Freeway Interchange, 'The Stack,' Turns 58 | publisher=[[KCET]] | date=September 22, 2011 |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref>

[[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX), [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|the 6th busiest airport in the world]], and [[San Francisco International Airport]] (SFO), [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|the 21st busiest airport in the world]], are major hubs for trans-Pacific and transcontinental traffic. There are about a dozen important commercial airports and many more [[general aviation]] [[List of airports in California|airports]] throughout the state.

California also has several important [[seaport]]s. The giant seaport complex formed by the [[Port of Los Angeles]] and the [[Long Beach, California#Shipping and transportation|Port of Long Beach]] in Southern California is the largest in the country and responsible for handling about a fourth of all container cargo traffic in the United States. The [[Port of Oakland]], fourth largest in the nation, also handles trade entering from the Pacific Rim to the rest of the country.

The [[California Highway Patrol]] is the largest statewide police agency in the United States in terms of employment with over 10,000 employees. They are responsible for providing any police-sanctioned service to anyone on California's state maintained highways and on state property.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles is by far the largest in North America. By the end of 2009, the California DMV had 26,555,006 driver's licenses and ID cards on file.<ref>http://dmv.ca.gov/about/profile/official.pdf</ref> In 2010, there were 1.17 million new vehicle registrations in force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_17197542 |title=California new-car sales up 13.1 percent in 2010 |publisher=San Jose Mercury News |accessdate=April 22, 2011}}</ref>

Intercity rail travel is provided by [[Amtrak California]], which manages the three busiest intercity rail lines in the U.S. outside the [[Northeast Corridor]], all of which are funded by Caltrans. This service is becoming increasingly popular over flying and ridership is continuing to set records, especially on the LAX-SFO route.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/01/05/BAMU1GU16Q.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Michael | last=Cabanatuan | title=Calif.

===State government===
{{Main|Government of California}}
[[File:Sacramento Capitol.jpg|thumb|The [[California State Capitol]] building in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]]]
California is governed as a republic, with three [[separation of powers|branches of government]] – the [[executive branch]] consisting of the [[Governor of California|Governor]] and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the [[legislative branch]] consisting of the [[California State Assembly|Assembly]] and [[California State Senate|Senate]]; and the [[judicial branch]] consisting of the [[Supreme Court of California]] and lower courts. The state also allows direct participation of the electorate by [[initiative]], [[referendum]], [[recall election|recall]], and [[ratification]]. California allows each political party to choose whether to have a [[closed primary]] or a primary where only party members and [[independent (politics)|independents]] vote. The state's capital is [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].

The Governor of California and the other state constitutional officers serve four-year terms and may be re-elected only once. The [[California State Legislature]] consists of a 40-member Senate and 80-member Assembly. Senators serve four-year terms and Assembly members two. Members of the Assembly are subject to [[term limit]]s of three terms, and members of the Senate are subject to term limits of two terms.

California's [[judiciary]] is the largest in the United States (with a total of 1,600 judges, while the federal system has only about 840). It is supervised by the seven Justices of the [[Supreme Court of California]]. Justices of the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal are appointed by the Governor, but are subject to retention by the electorate every 12 years.

California has an idiosyncratic political culture compared to the rest of the country, and is sometimes regarded as a trendsetter.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/30/eveningnews/main2138297.shtml | title=California Is A Political Trendsetter | date=October 30, 2006 | accessdate=February 22, 2011 | work=CBS News}}</ref> In terms of socio-cultural mores and national politics, Californians are perceived as more [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] than other Americans, especially those who live in the inland states.

Among the political idiosyncrasies and trendsetting, California was the second state [[California gubernatorial recall election, 2003|to recall their state governor]], the second state to legalize abortion, and the only state to ban marriage for gay couples twice by voters (including [[California Proposition 8|Proposition 8 in 2008]]). Voters also passed [[California Proposition 71 (2004)|Proposition 71 in 2004]] to fund [[stem cell]] research, and [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|Proposition 14 in 2010]] to completely change the state's [[primary election]] process. California has also experienced [[California Water Wars|disputes over water rights]]; and a [[tax revolt]], culminating with the passage of [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13 in 1978]], limiting state [[property tax]]es.

The state's trend towards the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and away from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] can be seen in state elections. From 1899 to 1939, California had Republican governors. Since 1990, California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal, state and local offices, including current Governor [[Jerry Brown]]; however, the state has elected Republican Governors, though many of its Republican Governors, such as [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], tend to be considered moderate Republicans and more [[Centrism|centrist]] than the national party.
[[File:Edmund G Brown Jr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Governor of California Jerry Brown|Governor [[Jerry Brown]] is one of the many [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] currently in office in California]]

The Democrats also now hold a majority in both houses of the state legislature. There are currently 56 Democrats and 24 Republicans in the Assembly; and 26 Democrats and 12 Republicans in the Senate.

The trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections; Republicans have not won California's [[electoral vote]]s since 1988. Additionally, both the state's current Democratic U.S. Senators, [[Dianne Feinstein]], a native and former mayor of San Francisco, and [[Barbara Boxer]], a former congresswoman from [[Marin County]], have held onto their seats since they were first elected in 1992.

In the U.S. House, the Democrats held a 34–19 edge in the CA delegation of the [[110th United States Congress]] in 2007. As the result of [[gerrymandering]], the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and very few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained 4 seats and held a 38-15 majority in the delegation.

In general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous [[Coastal California|coastal regions]] of the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] also remains mostly Republican. One study ranked [[Berkeley California|Berkeley]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and San Francisco in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[Orange, California|Orange]], [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]], and [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]] in the top 20 most conservative cities.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html | publisher=Bay Area Center for Voting Research | title=Study Ranks America's Most Liberal and Conservative Cities | date=August 16, 2005 | accessdate=February 20. 2011}}</ref>

[[File:CACourt protest.jpg|thumb|180px|Pro and Anti-[[California Proposition 8|Proposition 8]] protesters clash at a rally in front of San Francisco City Hall]]

California is considered generally liberal in its policies regarding the [[LGBT]] community, and the rights of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]] people have received greater recognition since 1960 at both the state and municipal level. California is home to a number of [[gay village]]s such as the [[The Castro, San Francisco|Castro District]] in San Francisco, [[Hillcrest, San Diego|Hillcrest]] in San Diego, and [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]].

Through the Domestic Partnership Act of 1999, California became the first state in the United States to recognize same-sex relationships in any legal capacity. However, the status of [[same-sex marriage in California]] is unique among the other U.S. states, in that California formerly granted marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but has discontinued doing so. In 2000, voters passed [[California Proposition 22 (2000)|Proposition 22]], which restricted state recognition of marriage to opposite-sex couples. However, in May 2008, the [[California Supreme Court]] struck down the initiative in ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'', leading to the marriage of over 85500 same-sex couples between May and November of that year. In November of the same year, the Supreme Court ruling was overruled when voters passed [[California Proposition 8|Proposition 8]], an amendment to the [[California Constitution]] that limited marriages to those between one man and one woman, resulting in protests and further judicial cases.

In 2011, the State Legislature passed the [[FAIR Education Act]], making California the first state to enforce the teaching of LGBT history and social sciences in the public school curriculum, while also prohibiting educational discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.

{{hatnote|For lists of cities, towns, and counties in California, see [[List of counties in California]], [[List of largest California cities by population]], [[List of cities and towns in California]], [[List of California urban areas]], and [[California locations by per capita income]].}}

The state's local government is divided into 58 counties and 482 [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] cities and towns; of which 460 are cities and 22 are towns. Under California law, the terms "city" and "town" are explicitly interchangeable; the name of an incorporated municipality in the state can either be "City of (Name)" or "Town of (Name)".<ref name="Cal Gov Code 34502">{{cite web

The majority of these cities and towns are within one of five [[metropolitan area]]s: the [[Los Angeles Metropolitan Area]], the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], the [[Riverside-San Bernardino Area]], the [[San Diego metropolitan area]] and the [[Sacramento metropolitan area]]. 

The state recognizes two kinds of cities: [[Charter city|charter]] and general law.<ref name="Cal Gov Code 34502"/> General law cities owe their existence to state law and are consequentially governed by it; charter cities are governed by their own city charters. Cities incorporated in the 19th century tend to be charter cities. All ten of the state's most populous cities are charter cities.

==Education==
[[File:THS facade.jpg|thumb|[[Torrance High School]] is one of the oldest high schools in continuous use in California and a popular location for television and motion picture production]]

Public [[Secondary education in the United States|secondary education]] consists of [[High school#United States|high schools]] that teach elective courses in trades, languages, and liberal arts with tracks for gifted, college-bound and industrial arts students. California's public educational system is supported by a [[California Proposition 98 (1988)|unique constitutional amendment]] that requires a minimum annual funding level for grades K-12 and [[community college]]s that grows with the economy and student enrollment figures.<ref name="Prop 98">{{cite web

California had over 6.2 million school students in the 2005–06 school year. Funding and staffing levels in California schools lag behind other states. In expenditure per pupil, California ranked 29th (of the 50 states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]) in 2005–06. In teaching staff expenditure per pupil, California ranked 49th of 51. In overall teacher-pupil ratio, California was also 49th, with 21 students per teacher. Only Arizona and Utah were lower.<ref name="How">{{cite web

A 2007 study concluded that California's public school system was "broken".<ref>{{cite news|last=Marshall |first=Carolyn |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/16/education/16schools.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1313692806-wLcsPvmsQ7+YfX++w1H+lQ |title=Report Says Public Schools in California Are 'Broken' – New York Times |location=California |work=The New York Times |date=March 16, 2007 |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref>

California's public [[postsecondary education]] offers a unique three tiered system:
* The research university system in the state is the [[University of California]] (UC), a [[public university]] system. As of fall 2011, the University of California had a combined [[student]] body of 234,464 students.<ref name=About>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.ucop.edu/display/UC101/About+the+University+of+California |title=About the University of California}}</ref> There are ten general UC campuses, and a number of specialized campuses in the UC system. The system was intended to accept the top 10% of California high school students, but under severe budget restrictions, this has since been diminishing. The UC system was originally given direct authority in awarding Ph.Ds, but this has since changed several years ago, California's Master Plan for Higher Education granting the CSU to award several Doctoral degrees.
* The [[California State University]] (CSU) system has almost 430,000 students, making it the largest university system in the United States. CSU was intended to accept the top one-third of high school students, but under severe budget woes and record amount of applications, this has since changed. The CSU originally began as an educational system primarily intended for undergraduate education, but has since changed under California's Master Plan for Higher Education. The CSU has been granted the authority to award an ample amount of Doctoral degrees today.
* The [[California Community Colleges System]] provides lower division coursework as well as basic skills and workforce training. It is the largest network of higher education in the US, composed of 112 colleges serving a student population of over 2.6 million.

California is also home to such notable private universities as [[Stanford University]], the [[University of Southern California]], the [[California Institute of Technology]], and the [[Claremont Colleges]]. California has hundreds of other private colleges and universities, including many religious and special-purpose institutions.

==Sports==
[[File:LA Coliseum gate.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], the only stadium in the world to host the Olympic Games twice: in [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]]]]
{{Main|Sports in California|List of professional sports teams in California}}
The State of California is the only US state to have hosted both the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer]] and Winter Olympics. The [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics]] were held in Los Angeles. [[Squaw Valley Ski Resort]] in the Lake Tahoe region hosted the [[1960 Winter Olympics]]. Multiple games during the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] took place in California, with the [[Rose Bowl Stadium|Rose Bowl]] in Pasadena hosting eight matches including the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], while [[Stanford Stadium]] in Palo Alto hosted six matches.

California has nineteen [[major professional sports league]] franchises, far more than any other state. The [[San Francisco Bay Area]] has seven major league teams spread in its three major cities: San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland. While the Greater Los Angeles Area is home to ten major league franchises, it is also the largest metropolitan area not to have a team from the [[National Football League]]. San Diego has two major league teams, and Sacramento has one. The NFL [[Super Bowl]] has been hosted in California 11 times at four different stadiums: [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], the Rose Bowl, Stanford Stadium, and San Diego's [[Qualcomm Stadium]].

Home to some of the most prominent universities in the United States, California has long had many respected collegiate sports programs. California is home to the oldest college bowl game, the annual [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], among others.

California has also long been a hub for motorsports and auto racing. The city of Long Beach holds an event every year in the month of April, which is host to [[IndyCar Series]] racing through the streets of downtown. Long Beach has hosted [[Formula One]] events there in the past, and also currently hosts an event on the [[American Le Mans Series]] schedule. [[Auto Club Speedway]] is a speedway in [[Fontana, California|Fontana]] and currently hosts one [[NASCAR]] Sprint Cup Series race a year. [[Sonoma Raceway]] is a multi-purpose facility outside [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]], featuring a road course and a drag strip. The road course is home to a NASCAR event and an IndyCar event. The drag strip hosts a yearly [[NHRA]] event. [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]] is a road course in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] that currently hosts an ALMS event, a round of the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] and the [[Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion]]. The [[Auto Club Raceway at Pomona]] has hosted NHRA drag racing for over 50 years.
