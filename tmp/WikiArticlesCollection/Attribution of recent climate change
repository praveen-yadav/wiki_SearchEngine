'''Attribution of recent climate change''' is the effort to scientifically ascertain mechanisms responsible for recent changes observed in the [[Earth]]'s [[climate]]. The effort has focused on changes observed during the period of [[instrumental temperature record]], when records are most reliable; particularly on the last 50 years, when human activity has grown fastest and observations of the [[troposphere]] have become available. The dominant mechanisms (to which recent climate change has been attributed) are anthropogenic, i.e., the [[Human impact on the environment|result of human activity]]. They are:<ref name="IPCC AR4 WG1 2007">http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref>

* increasing [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] concentrations of [[greenhouse gas]]es
* global changes to land surface, such as [[deforestation]]
* increasing atmospheric concentrations of [[aerosol]]s.

There are also natural mechanisms for variation including [[climate oscillation]]s, changes in [[solar variation|solar activity]], and [[volcano|volcanic]] activity.

According to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), it is "extremely likely" that human influence was the dominant cause of global warming between 1951 and 2010.<ref>

This section introduces some concepts in [[climate]] science that are used in the following sections:

Factors affecting [[Earth]]'s climate can be broken down into [[climate feedback|feedbacks]] and forcings.<ref name=nrc2008>{{cite book

A forcing is something that is imposed externally on the climate system. External forcings include natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions and variations in the sun's output.<ref>Le Treut ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch1.html Chapter 1: Historical Overview of Climate Change Science], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-1-1.html FAQ 1.1, What Factors Determine Earth's Climate?], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.</ref> Human activities can also impose forcings, for example, through changing the composition of the atmosphere.

[[Radiative forcing]] is a measure of how various factors alter the [[First law of thermodynamics|energy balance]] of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]].<ref>Forster ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2.html Chapter 2: Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and Radiative Forcing], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-2-1.html FAQ 2.1, How do Human Activities Contribute to Climate Change and How do They Compare with Natural Influences?] in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.</ref> A positive radiative forcing will tend to increase the energy of the Earth-atmosphere system, leading to a warming of the system. Between the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in 1750, and the year 2005, the increase in the atmospheric concentration of [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]] ([[chemical formula]]: CO<sub>2</sub>) led to a positive radiative forcing, averaged over the Earth's [[surface area]], of about 1.66 [[watt]]s per square metre (abbreviated W&nbsp;m<sup>−2</sup>).<ref name="ipcc radiative forcing">IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spm.html Summary for Policymakers], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-human-and.html Human and Natural Drivers of Climate Change], Figure SPM.2, in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.</ref>

Climate feedbacks can either amplify or dampen the response of the climate to a given forcing.<ref name=nrc2008/>{{Rp|7|date=November 2012}}
There are many feedback mechanisms in the climate system that can either amplify (a [[positive feedback]]) or diminish (a [[negative feedback]]) the effects of a change in climate forcing.

Aspects of the climate system will show variation in response to changes in forcings.<ref>

In the absence of forcings imposed on it, the climate system will still show internal variability (see images opposite). This internal variability is a result of complex interactions between components of the climate system, such as the [[coupling (physics)|coupling]] between the atmosphere and [[ocean]] (see also the later section on [[Attribution of recent climate change#Internal climate variability and global warming|Internal climate variability and global warming]]).<ref>Albritton ''et al.'', [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/010.htm Technical Summary], [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/011.htm#box1 Box 1: What drives changes in climate?], in {{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG1|2001}}.</ref> An example of internal variability is the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]].

Detection and attribution of climate signals, as well as its common-sense meaning, has a more precise definition within the climate change literature, as expressed by the IPCC.<ref>Mitchell ''et al.'', [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/439.htm Chapter 12: Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes], [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/443.htm#1211 Section 12.1.1: The Meaning of Detection and Attribution], in {{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG1|2001}}.</ref>

''Detection'' of a signal requires demonstrating that an observed change is [[statistically significant]]ly different from that which can be explained by natural internal variability.

''Attribution'' requires demonstrating that a signal is:

* unlikely to be due entirely to internal variability;
* consistent with the estimated responses to the given combination of anthropogenic and natural forcing
* not consistent with alternative, physically plausible explanations of recent climate change that exclude important elements of the given combination of forcings.

Detection does not imply attribution, and is easier to show than attribution. Unequivocal attribution would require controlled experiments with multiple copies of the climate system, which is not possible. Therefore, attribution, as described above, can only be done within some margin of error. For example, the IPCC's [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] says "it is ''extremely likely'' that human activities have exerted a substantial net warming influence on climate since 1750," where "extremely likely" indicates a probability greater than 95%.<ref name="IPCC AR4 WG1 2007"/>

=== Greenhouse gases ===

===Land use===
Climate change is attributed to [[land use]] for two main reasons. Between 1750 and 2007, about two-thirds of anthropogenic [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] emissions were produced from burning fossil fuels, and about one-third of emissions from changes in land use,<ref>

</ref> Deforestation both reduces the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by deforested regions and releases greenhouse gases directly, together with aerosols, through [[slash and burn|biomass burning]] that frequently accompanies it.

A second reason that climate change has been attributed to land use is that the [[albedo|terrestrial albedo]] is often altered by use, which leads to [[radiative forcing]]. This effect is more significant locally than globally.<ref name="Technical Summary"/>

Worldwide, livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the ice-free land surface of the Earth.<ref name="livestock">{{Cite book| title = Livestock's Long Shadow | year = 2006 | publisher = Food and Agricultural Organization of the U.N. | isbn = 9251055718 | url = http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf | format = PDF | author = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

More than 18% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to livestock and livestock-related activities such as deforestation and increasingly fuel-intensive farming practices.<ref name="livestock" /> Specific attributions to the livestock sector include:

===Aerosols===
With virtual certainty, scientific consensus has attributed various forms of climate change, chiefly cooling effects, to [[aerosol]]s, which are small particles or droplets suspended in the atmosphere.<ref name="WG1-2007-FM">??{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}. <!-- Original citation TOTALLY SCREWED UP.

== Attribution of 20th century climate change ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Global warming controversy]] -->
[[File:Climate Change Attribution.png|250px |thumb |alt=Refer to caption |One [[global climate model]]'s reconstruction of temperature change during the 20th century as the result of five studied forcing factors and the amount of temperature change attributed to each.]]
Over the past 150 years human activities have released increasing quantities of [[greenhouse gas]]es into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. This has led to increases in mean global temperature, or [[global warming]]. Other human effects are relevant—for example, sulphate [[Particulate|aerosols]] are believed to have a cooling effect. Natural factors also contribute. According to the [[historical temperature record]] of the last century, the Earth's near-surface air temperature has risen around 0.74 [[Plus-minus sign|±]] 0.18&nbsp;°Celsius (1.3 ± 0.32&nbsp;°Fahrenheit).<ref>[https://www2.ucar.edu/climate/faq/how-much-has-global-temperature-risen-last-100-years UCAR FAQ: How much has global temp. risen over the past 100 years?]</ref>

A historically important question in climate change research has regarded the relative importance of human activity and non-[[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] causes during the period of [[instrumental temperature record|instrumental record]]. In the 1995 [[IPCC Second Assessment Report|Second Assessment Report]] (SAR), the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] made the widely quoted statement that "The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate". The phrase "balance of evidence" suggested the (English) common-law standard of proof required in civil as opposed to criminal courts: not as high as "beyond reasonable doubt". In 2001 the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|Third Assessment Report]] (TAR) refined this, saying "There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities".<ref name="WG1-2001-SPM"/> The 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] (AR4) strengthened this finding:
* "Anthropogenic warming of the climate system is widespread and can be detected in temperature observations taken at the surface, in the free atmosphere and in the oceans. Evidence of the effect of external influences, both anthropogenic and natural, on the climate system has continued to accumulate since the TAR."<ref>Solomon ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ts.html Technical Summary], [http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-ts.pdf p. ?].{{page needed|date=September 2011}} in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.</ref>)

Other findings of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report include:
*"It is ''extremely unlikely'' (<5%)<ref name="ar4 uncertainty">
In the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, the following scale is used to quantify uncertainty: "virtually certain" >99%; "extremely likely" >95%; "very likely" >90%; "likely" >66%; "more likely than not" >50%; "about as likely as not" 33 to 66%; "unlikely" <33%; "very unlikely" <10%; "extremely unlikely" <5%; "exceptionally unlikely" <1%. {{citation

Over the past five decades there has been a global warming of approximately 0.65&nbsp;°C (1.17&nbsp;°F) at the Earth's surface (see [[historical temperature record]]). Among the possible factors that could produce changes in global mean temperature are internal variability of the climate system, external forcing, an increase in concentration of greenhouse gases, or any combination of these. Current studies indicate that the increase in greenhouse gases, most notably {{CO2}}, is mostly responsible for the observed warming. Evidence for this conclusion includes:

* Estimates of internal variability from climate models, and reconstructions of past temperatures, indicate that the warming is unlikely to be entirely natural.
* Climate models forced by natural factors ''and'' increased greenhouse gases and aerosols reproduce the observed global temperature changes; those forced by natural factors alone do not.<ref name="WG1-2001-SPM">IPCC, [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/007.htm Summary for Policymakers].{{page needed|date=September 2011}} in {{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG1|2001}}.</ref>

Recent scientific assessments find that most of the warming of the Earth's surface over the past 50 years has been caused by human activities (see also the section on [[Attribution of recent climate change#Scientific literature and opinion|scientific literature and opinion]]). This conclusion rests on multiple lines of evidence. Like the warming "signal" that has gradually emerged from the "noise" of natural climate variability, the scientific evidence for a human influence on global climate has accumulated over the past several decades, from many hundreds of studies. No single study is a "[[smoking gun]]." Nor has any single study or combination of studies undermined the large body of evidence supporting the conclusion that human activity is the primary driver of recent warming.

<!-- This entire paragraph is based on the following reference --><ref name="usgcrp attribution"/>
The first line of evidence is based on a physical understanding of how greenhouse gases trap heat, how the climate system responds to increases in greenhouse gases, and how other human and natural factors influence climate. The second line of evidence is from indirect estimates of climate changes over the last 1,000 to 2,000 years. These records are obtained from living things and their remains (like [[tree ring]]s and [[coral]]s) and from physical quantities (like the ratio between lighter and heavier [[isotope]]s of [[oxygen]] in [[ice core]]s), which change in measurable ways as climate changes. The lesson from these data is that global surface temperatures over the last several decades are clearly unusual, in that they were higher than at any time during at least the past 400 years. For the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the recent temperature rise is clearly unusual in at least the last 1,000 years (see graph opposite).

The third line of evidence is based on the broad, qualitative consistency between observed changes in climate and the computer model simulations of how climate would be expected to change in response to human activities. For example, when climate models are run with historical increases in greenhouse gases, they show gradual warming of the Earth and ocean surface, increases in ocean heat content and the temperature of the lower atmosphere, a [[current sea level rise|rise]] in global sea level, retreat of [[sea ice]] and [[snow]] cover, cooling of the [[stratosphere]], an increase in the amount of atmospheric water vapor, and changes in large-scale [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[atmospheric pressure|pressure patterns]]. These and other aspects of modelled climate change are in agreement with observations.<!-- This entire paragraph was based on the following reference --><ref name="usgcrp attribution"/>

Finally, there is extensive [[statistical]] evidence from so-called "fingerprint" studies. Each factor that affects climate produces a unique pattern of climate response, much as each person has a unique fingerprint. Fingerprint studies exploit these unique signatures, and allow detailed comparisons of modelled and observed climate change patterns. Scientists rely on such studies to attribute observed changes in climate to a particular cause or set of causes. In the real world, the climate changes that have occurred since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]] are due to a complex mixture of human and natural causes. The importance of each individual influence in this mixture changes over time. Of course, there are not multiple Earths, which would allow an experimenter to change one factor at a time on each Earth, thus helping to isolate different fingerprints. Therefore, climate models are used to study how individual factors affect climate. For example, a single factor (like greenhouse gases) or a set of factors can be varied, and the response of the modelled climate system to these individual or combined changes can thus be studied.<!-- This entire paragraph was based on the following reference --><ref name="usgcrp attribution"/>

For example, when climate model simulations of the last century include all of the major influences on climate, both human-induced and natural, they can reproduce many important features of observed climate change patterns. When human influences are removed from the model experiments, results suggest that the surface of the Earth would actually have cooled slightly over the last 50 years (see graph, opposite). The clear message from fingerprint studies is that the observed warming over the last half-century cannot be explained by natural factors, and is instead caused primarily by human factors.<!-- This entire paragraph was based on the following reference --><ref name="usgcrp attribution"/>

Another fingerprint of human effects on climate has been identified by looking at a slice through the layers of the atmosphere, and studying the pattern of temperature changes from the surface up through the stratosphere (see the section on [[Attribution of recent climate change#Solar activity|solar activity]]). The earliest fingerprint work focused on changes in surface and atmospheric temperature. Scientists then applied fingerprint methods to a whole range of climate variables, identifying human-caused climate signals in the heat content of the oceans, the height of the [[tropopause]] (the boundary between the [[troposphere]] and [[stratosphere]], which has shifted upward by hundreds of feet in recent decades), the geographical patterns of precipitation, [[drought]], surface pressure, and the [[surface runoff|runoff]] from major [[river basin]]s.<!-- This entire paragraph was based on the following reference --><ref name="usgcrp attribution"/>

Studies published after the appearance of the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] in 2007 have also found human fingerprints in the increased levels of atmospheric [[moisture]] (both close to the surface and over the full extent of the atmosphere), in the decline of [[Arctic sea ice]] extent, and in the patterns of changes in [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] surface temperatures.<!-- This entire paragraph was based on the following reference --><ref name="usgcrp attribution"/>

The message from this entire body of work is that the climate system is telling a consistent story of increasingly dominant human influence – the changes in temperature, ice extent, moisture, and [[Atmospheric circulation|circulation]] patterns fit together in a physically consistent way, like pieces in a complex puzzle.<!-- This entire paragraph was based on the following reference --><ref name="usgcrp attribution"/>

Increasingly, this type of fingerprint work is shifting its emphasis. As noted, clear and compelling scientific evidence supports the case for a pronounced human influence on global climate. Much of the recent attention is now on climate changes at continental and regional scales, and on variables that can have large impacts on societies. For example, scientists have established causal links between human activities and the changes in [[snowpack]], maximum and minimum ([[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]]) temperature, and the seasonal timing of runoff over [[mountain]]ous regions of the [[western United States]]. Human activity is likely to have made a substantial contribution to ocean surface temperature changes in [[hurricane]] formation regions. Researchers are also looking beyond the physical climate system, and are beginning to tie changes in the distribution and seasonal behaviour of plant and animal species to human-caused changes in temperature and precipitation.<!-- This entire paragraph was based on the following reference --><ref name="usgcrp attribution"/>

For over a decade, one aspect of the climate change story seemed to show a significant difference between models and observations. In the [[tropics]], all models predicted that with a rise in greenhouse gases, the troposphere would be expected to warm more rapidly than the surface. Observations from weather balloons, satellites, and surface thermometers seemed to show the opposite behaviour (more rapid warming of the surface than the troposphere). This issue was a stumbling block in understanding the causes of climate change. It is now largely resolved. Research showed that there were large uncertainties in the [[satellite]] and [[weather balloon]] data. When uncertainties in models and observations are properly accounted for, newer observational data sets (with better treatment of known problems) are in agreement with climate model results.<!-- This entire paragraph was based on the following reference --><ref name="usgcrp attribution"/>

This does not mean, however, that all remaining differences between models and observations have been resolved. The observed changes in some climate variables, such as Arctic sea ice, some aspects of precipitation, and patterns of surface pressure, appear to be proceeding much more rapidly than models have projected. The reasons for these differences are not well understood. Nevertheless, the bottom-line conclusion from climate fingerprinting is that most of the observed changes studied to date are consistent with each other, and are also consistent with our scientific understanding of how the climate system would be expected to respond to the increase in heat-trapping gases resulting from human activities.<!-- This entire paragraph was based on the following reference --><ref name="usgcrp attribution"/>

One of the subjects discussed in the literature is whether or not extreme weather events can be attributed to human activities. Seneviratne ''et al.'' (2012)<ref>

===Detection and attribution studies===

* In 1996, in a paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' titled "A search for human influences on the thermal structure of the atmosphere", [[Benjamin D. Santer]] et al. wrote: "The observed spatial patterns of temperature change in the free atmosphere from 1963 to 1987 are similar to those predicted by state-of-the-art climate models incorporating various combinations of changes in carbon dioxide, anthropogenic sulphate aerosol and stratospheric ozone concentrations. The degree of pattern similarity between models and observations increases through this period. It is likely that this trend is partially due to human activities, although many uncertainties remain, particularly relating to estimates of natural variability."
* A 2002 paper in the ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]'' says "Our analysis suggests that the early twentieth century warming can best be explained by a combination of warming due to increases in greenhouse gases and natural forcing, some cooling due to other anthropogenic forcings, and a substantial, but not implausible, contribution from internal variability. In the second half of the century we find that the warming is largely caused by changes in greenhouse gases, with changes in sulphates and, perhaps, volcanic aerosol offsetting approximately one third of the warming."<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Tett SFB |authorlink1=Simon Tett |author2=''et al.'' |title=Estimation of natural and anthropogenic contributions to twentieth century temperature change |journal=J.

==Difficulties in attribution==

At the time of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, attribution was possible for a number of observed changes in the climate (see [[effects of global warming]]). However, attribution was found to be more difficult when assessing changes over smaller regions (less than continental scale) and over short time periods (less than 50 years).<ref name="hegerl 2007 executive summary">Hegerl ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html Chapter 9: Understanding and Attributing Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-es.html Executive Summary], in
{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.</ref>
Over larger regions, averaging reduces natural variability of the climate, making detection and attribution easier.

The role of the sun in recent climate change has been looked at by climate scientists. Since 1978, [[solar variation|output from the Sun]] has been precisely measured by [[satellite]]s.<ref name=nrc2008/>{{Rp|6|date=November 2012}}
These measurements indicate that the Sun's output has not increased since 1978, so the warming during the past 30 years cannot be attributed to an increase in solar energy reaching the Earth (see graph above, left). In the three decades since 1978, the combination of solar and [[volcanic activity]] probably had a slight cooling influence on the climate.<ref>Global Climate Change, in {{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, pp. 15–16.</ref>

Climate models have been used to examine the role of the sun in recent climate change.<ref>Hegerl, ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html Chapter 9: Understanding and Attributing Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-9-2.html Frequently Asked Question 9.2: Can the Warming of the 20th century be Explained by Natural Variability?], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.</ref>
Models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when they only take into account variations in solar output and volcanic activity. Models are, however, able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings, including human influences and natural forcings. As has already been stated, Hegerl ''et al.'' (2007) concluded that greenhouse gas forcing had "very likely" caused most of the observed global warming since the mid-20th century. In making this conclusion, Hegerl ''et al.'' (2007) allowed for the possibility that climate models had been underestimated the effect of solar forcing.<ref>Hegerl, ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html Chapter 9: Understanding and Attributing Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-es.html Executive Summary], in

Preliminary results from the experiment (Duplissy et al., 2009) suggest that though there was some evidence of ion mediated nucleation, for most of the nucleation events observed the contribution of ion processes appeared to be minor. These experiments also showed the difficulty in maintaining sufficiently clean conditions and stable temperatures to prevent spurious aerosol bursts. There is no indication that the earlier Svensmark experiments could even have matched the controlled conditions of the CERN experiment. We find that the Svensmark results on cloud seeding have not yet been shown to be robust or sufficient to materially alter the conclusions of the assessment literature, especially given the abundance of recent literature that is skeptical of the cosmic ray-climate linkage</blockquote>

First principles as well as empirical observation suggest that positive feedbacks from {{CO2}} concentrations amplify warming initially caused by other factors:
<blockquote>Close analysis of the relationship between the two curves [i.e., temperature and {{CO2}}] shows that, within the uncertainties of matching their timescales, the temperature led by a few centuries. This is expected, since it was changes in the Earth's orbital parameters (including the shape of its orbit around the Sun, and the tilt of Earth's axis) that caused the small initial temperature rise. This then raised atmospheric {{CO2}} levels, in part by outgassing from the oceans, causing the temperature to rise further. By amplifying each other's response, this "positive feedback" can turn a small initial perturbation into a large climate change. There is therefore no surprise that the temperature and {{CO2}} rose in parallel, with the temperature initially in advance. In the current case, the situation is different, because human actions are raising the {{CO2}} level, and we are starting to observe the temperature response.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_bas/news/news_story.php?id=178 |title=News Story&nbsp;— BAS Statement about Channel 4 programme on Global Warming&nbsp;— British Antarctic Survey |publisher=Antarctica.ac.uk |date= | accessdate = 2010-07-21| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100731085928/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_bas/news/news_story.php?id=178| archivedate= 31 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> </blockquote>

Present {{CO2}} levels greatly exceed the range found in the ice core data.

One of the issues that has been raised in the media is the view that global warming "stopped in 1998".<ref name="scott variability p1">Edited quote from public-domain source: {{citation

[[File:This graph shows Global Average Temperature between 1880-2009 compared with the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) Index. The roughly parallel curves of the two parameters show that they are related.gif|thumb|300px|left|alt=Refer to caption|This graph shows Global Average Temperature compared with the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) Index.<ref name="scott variability p3"/> The AMO Index is the average sea-surface temperature over the North Atlantic Ocean. The roughly parallel curves of the two parameters show that they are related: the increase in global temperature over time, coincident with the increase in greenhouse gases observed since the [[Industrial Revolution]], is alternately obscured and enhanced by the AMO.]]
Another example of internal climate variability is the [[Atlantic multidecadal oscillation|Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation]] (AMO), which is an alternating pattern of heat-distributing ocean circulation that brings warmed waters from the [[tropics]] to high [[latitude]]s.<ref name="scott variability p3"/> One cycle of the oscillation takes about 65 to 70 years.<ref name="scott variability p3"/> Over that time, the amount of [[heat]] moved northward along the western side of the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] varies, increasing and decreasing temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean and the surrounding [[continental margin]]s.<ref name="scott variability p3"/>

Although not directly dictated by this decades-long phenomenon, global temperatures are influenced by the oscillation, just as average temperatures can be driven up or down by El Niño and La Niña events.<ref name="scott variability p3"/> The transport of such a massive quantity of heat helps explain some counter-intuitive temperature trends during the twentieth century.<ref name="scott variability p3"/> Despite the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations that began in the mid-1800s, between 1850 and 1900, global temperatures showed little significant change.<ref name="scott variability p3"/> Between 1900 and 1940, temperatures rose.<ref name="scott variability p3"/> After 1940, temperatures declined for 35 years.<ref name="scott variability p3"/> According to Michael Schlesinger, of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation helps to explain the lack of a direct correlation between {{CO2}} concentrations and global temperatures over this time period.<ref name="scott variability p3"/>

David Easterling (Chief of the Scientific Services Division at [[NOAA]]'s [[National Climatic Data Center]]) and co-author Michael Wehner have examined observed temperatures and model simulations of future temperatures.<ref name="scott variability p3"/> For observed temperatures, Easterling relied on a data set generated by NOAA's National Climatic Data Center, incorporating globally averaged surface air temperatures from 1901 to 2008.<ref name="scott variability p3"/> In that data set, he found two periods—1977 to 1985 and 1981 to 1989—that showed slight cooling, similar to what appears in the [[Hadley Centre]]'s data set from 1998 to 2008.<ref name="scott variability p3"/>

For model simulations, Easterling used a database of predicted temperatures, validated by its ability to retroactively "predict" temperatures for years past.<ref name="scott variability p3"/> He assumed a "business-as-usual" scenario in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, with little future reduction.<ref name="scott variability p3"/> When projecting temperatures for the twenty-first century, he found two more periods—2001 to 2010 and 2016 to 2031—that showed no trend, again similar to 1998 to 2008.<ref name="scott variability p3"/> Every one of these no-trend periods occurred against a backdrop of rising temperatures.<ref name="scott variability p3"/>

===Projected impacts of internal climate variability===

Easterling's finding that natural variability can cause short-term cooling, or no-trend periods within longer-term warming, correlates with other predictions about future temperatures.<ref name="scott variability p4">Edited quote from public-domain source: {{citation
 | title=What the Future May Hold
 | url=http://www.climatewatch.noaa.gov/article/2009/short-term-cooling-on-a-warming-planet/4
}}, p.4, in {{harvnb|Scott|2009}}
</ref> In May 2008, a group of climate modelers in [[Germany]] published projections that incorporated current understanding of natural cycles to make a climate forecast for the next decade.<ref name="scott variability p4"/> The group forecast that global surface temperatures might not increase much over the next decade (2010–2020), as cooling driven by natural variability offsets human-caused warming.<ref name="scott variability p4"/> After a decade or so of stability, however, the model indicates that temperatures would begin to rise.<ref name="scott variability p4"/>

In contrast, the UK Met Office predicted warming beginning in a few years from 2009.<ref name="scott variability p4"/> Both groups, however, agreed that after a short period of negative or no trend in the early 2000s, global temperatures would begin to rise, perhaps quickly.<ref name="scott variability p4"/> In other words, the no-trend period in the Hadley Centre's data set is consistent with what climatologists have predicted.<ref name="scott variability p4"/>
