'''Robert Montgomery "Bob" Knight''' (born October 25, 1940) is a retired [[United States|American]] [[basketball]] [[coach (sport)|coach]]. Nicknamed "The General," Knight won 902 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] men's college basketball games, most all-time at the time of his retirement and currently third all-time behind his former player, [[Mike Krzyzewski]] of [[Duke University|Duke]] and [[Jim Boeheim]] of [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]]. He is most well known as the head coach of the [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana Hoosiers]] from 1971&ndash;2000. He also coached at [[Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball|Texas Tech]] (2001&ndash;2008) and at [[Army Black Knights men's basketball|Army]] (1965&ndash;1971).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/020408/loc_243647726.shtml|title=Exclusive: Knight speaks about retirement decision|publisher=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|accessdate=2008-02-04|date=2008-02-04|author=Walker, Jeff}}</ref> 

While at Indiana, Knight led his teams to three [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA championships]], one [[National Invitation Tournament]] (NIT) championship, and 11 [[Big Ten Conference]] championships. He received the National Coach of the Year honor four times and the Big Ten Coach of the Year honor eight times. In 1984, he coached the [[USA men's national basketball team|USA men's Olympic team]] to a gold medal, becoming one of only three basketball coaches to win an NCAA title, NIT title, and an Olympic gold medal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&page=cbask/news/AEN4127975.htm |title=Bob Knight resigns |publisher=Sportsnetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref>

Knight was one of college basketball's most successful and innovative coaches, having perfected and popularized the [[motion offense]]. He has also been praised for running clean programs (none of his teams were ever sanctioned by the NCAA for recruiting violations) and graduating most of his players. However, Knight has also attracted controversy; he famously threw a chair across the court during a game, was once arrested for [[assault]], and regularly displayed a combative nature during encounters with members of the press.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/23171291 |title=Pat Knight to mine for players in Indiana |publisher=Nbcsports.msnbc.com |date=2008-02-15 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref> Knight remains "the object of near fanatical devotion" from his former players and Indiana fans.<ref name="darkside">{{cite news|title=A dark side of Knight|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/thenetwork/news/2000/03/14/knight_indiana/|accessdate=26 April 2012|newspaper=CNN/Si|date=10 September 2000}}</ref> 

In 2008, Knight joined [[ESPN]] as a men's [[ESPN College Basketball broadcast teams|college basketball]] studio analyst during Championship Week and for coverage of the NCAA Tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=3269476 |title=Bob Knight joins ESPN for Championship Week and NCAA Tournament |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2008-02-29 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref> For the [[2008-09 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2008&ndash;09 season]], he joined ESPN as a part-time color commentator as well as continuing his studio analyst duties.

==Playing career==
Knight was born in [[Massillon, Ohio]] and grew up in [[Orrville, Ohio]].<ref name="www2.indystar.com">{{cite web|url=http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/people/k/knight_bob/knight.html |title=Bob Knight |publisher=.indystar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref> Knight began his career as a player at [[Orrville High School]]. He continued under [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] coach [[Fred R. Taylor|Fred Taylor]] at [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]] in 1958. Despite being a star player in high school, he played a reserve role as a forward on the [[1959–60 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|1960 Ohio State Buckeyes team]] that won the NCAA Championship and featured future Hall of Fame players [[John Havlicek]] and [[Jerry Lucas]]. The Buckeyes lost to the [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati Bearcats]] in each of the next two NCAA Championship games, of which Knight was also a part. 

Due in part to the star power of those Ohio State teams, playing time was usually scarce for Knight, but that did not prevent him from making an impact; in the 1961 NCAA Championship game, Knight came off the bench with 1:41 on the clock and Cincinnati leading Ohio State, 61-59. In the words of then-Ohio State assistant coach [[Frank Truitt]],
<blockquote>Knight got the ball in the left front court and faked a drive into the middle. Then [he] crossed over like he worked on it all his life and drove right in and laid it up. That tied the game for us, and Knight ran clear across the floor like a 100-yard dash sprinter and ran right at me and said, 'See there, coach, I should have been in that game a long time ago!'</blockquote>
To which Truitt replied, "Sit down, you hot dog. You're lucky you're even on the floor."<ref>[Delsohn, Steve and Mark Heisler. "Bob Knight: The Unauthorized Biography." New York: Simon & Schuster, Inc., 2006. 22. ISBN 074324348X]</ref>

In addition to lettering in basketball at Ohio State, it has been claimed that Knight also lettered in football and baseball;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/bob-knight-at.htm |title=Howstuffworks "Bob Knight" |publisher=Entertainment.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref> however, the official list of Ohio State football letter earners does not include Knight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://admin.xosn.com/fls/17300//pdf/fb/m-footbl-letterwinners.pdf?SPSID=87751&SPID=10408&DB_OEM_ID=17300 |title=Tradition and History: Ohio State Letterwinners |work=Ohio State 2007 Spring Football Media Guide |publisher=Ohio State University Athletics |format=PDF |page=148 |accessdate=2007-10-31}}</ref> Knight graduated with a degree in history and government in 1962.

==Army Black Knights==
After graduation in 1962, Knight coached junior varsity basketball at [[Cuyahoga Falls High School]] in Ohio for one year.<ref name="deford">{{cite news|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|last=Deford|first=Frank|title=The Rabbit Hunter|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/magazine/12/28/knight.flashback/|date=1981-01-26|accessdate=2008-05-30}}</ref> Knight then enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and accepted an assistant coaching position with the [[Army Black Knights men's basketball|Army Black Knights]] in 1963, where, two years later, he was named the head coach at the relatively young age of 24. In six seasons at West Point, Knight won 102 games, with his first as a head coach coming against [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]]. One of his players was [[Mike Krzyzewski]], who would later serve as his assistant before becoming a Hall of Fame head coach at [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]. [[Mike Silliman]] was also another of Knight's players at Army, and Bob Knight was quoted as saying, "Mike Silliman is the best player I have ever coached."

==Indiana University Hoosiers==
In 1971 the [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana University Hoosiers]] hired Knight as head coach. Because of his time spent coaching at Army and his disciplinarian nature, Knight earned the nickname "The General." During his 29 years as head coach at Indiana, the Hoosiers won 662 games, including 22 seasons of 20 or more wins, while losing but 239, a remarkable .735 winning percentage. In 24 NCAA tournament appearances at Indiana, Hoosier teams under Bob Knight won 42 of 63 games (.667), winning titles in [[1975–76 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1976]], [[1980–81 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1981]], and [[1986–87 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1987]], while losing in the semi-finals in 1973 and 1992.

===1970s===
In [[1972–73 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1972–73]], Knight's second year as coach, Indiana won the Big Ten championship and reached the Final Four, but lost to [[1972–73 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]]. The following season, 1973–74, Indiana once again captured a Big Ten title. In the two following seasons, [[1974–75 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1974-75]] and [[1975–76 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1975-76]], Knight's teams were undefeated in the regular season and won 37-consecutive Big Ten games on their way to their fourth conference title in a row. The [[1974–75 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1974-75]] Hoosiers swept the entire Big Ten by an average of 22.8 points per game. However, in a 83-82 win against [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue]] they lost consensus All-American forward [[Scott May]] to a broken left arm. With May playing just 7 mins,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/scott-may-1/gamelog/1975/ |title=Scott May 1974-75 Game Log &#124; College Basketball at |publisher=Sports-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref> the No. 1 Hoosiers lost to [[1974–75 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] 92-90 in the [[1975 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Midwest Regional]]. The following season, [[1975–76 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1975–76]], the Hoosiers went the entire season and [[1976 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1976 NCAA tournament]] without a single loss, beating [[1975–76 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]] 86–68 in the title game. Immediately after the game, Knight lamented that "it should have been two." The 1976 Hoosiers remains the last undefeated NCAA Division I men's basketball team.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dave |last=Dorr  | url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/sports2000/trends/150673.html | title=A perfect season | work=sportingnews.com |date=1976-04-10 | accessdate= 2008-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.heraldtimesonline.com/sports/hh/1976/| title=Hoosier Historia | work=heraldtimesonline.com | accessdate=28 March 2008 }}</ref> Indiana won the [[1979 National Invitation Tournament|1979 NIT]] championship.

===1980s===
The 1979-80 Hoosiers won the Big Ten championship and advanced to the [[1980 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1980 Sweet Sixteen]]. The following season, in [[1980–81 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1980-81]], star-guard [[Isiah Thomas]] and Knight's Hoosiers once again won a conference title and won the [[1981 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1981 NCAA tournament]], Knight's second national title. In 1982–1983, Knight's No. 1 ranked Hoosiers were favorites to win another national championship. However with an injury to All-American [[Ted Kitchel]] mid-season, the Hoosiers' prospects were grim. Knight asked for fan support to rally around the team, which ultimately won the Big Ten championship. Nevertheless in the tournament Kitchel's absence was felt and the team lost to Kentucky in the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1983 Sweet Sixteen]].

Around this time, Knight eschewed wearing ties and sportcoats on the sidelines in favor of his now-famous sweaters.

[[File:Knight with young fans.jpg|thumb|Knight with young fans at [[Frank Truitt]]'s house in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], summer of 1988]]

Knight and his [[1985–86 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1985-86]] team were profiled in a best-selling book ''[[A Season on the Brink]]''. To write it Knight granted author [[John Feinstein]] almost unprecedented access to the Indiana basketball program, as well as insights into Knight's private life. Feinstein depicts a coach who is quick with a violent temper, but also one who never cheats and strictly follows all of the NCAA's rules. The following season, in [[1986–87 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1986-87]], Knight won a share of the Big Ten title and his third national championship against [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse]] in the [[1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1987 NCAA tournament]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Weinberg |title=60: Smart's jumper wins NCAA title for Indiana |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/60 |work= espn.com |accessdate= 2008-03-30}}</ref> In the 1988–1989 season the Hoosiers again won a Big Ten championship.

===1990s===
From 1990-91 through [[1992–93 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1992-93]], the Hoosiers posted 87 victories, the most by any Big Ten team in a three-year span, breaking the mark of 86 set by Coach Knight's Indiana teams of 1974-76. Teams from these three seasons spent all but two of the 53 poll weeks in the top 10, and 38 of them in the top 5. They captured two Big Ten crowns in 1990-91 and 1992–93, and during the 1991-92 season reached the [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Final Four]]. During the 1992-93 season, the 31-4 Hoosiers finished the season at the top of the [[AP Poll]], but were defeated by [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]] in the [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Elite Eight]].

Throughout the mid and late 1990s Knight continued to experience success with continual NCAA tournament appearances and a minimum of 19 wins each season. However, 1993 would be Knight's last conference championship and 1994 would be his last trip to the Sweet Sixteen.

===Dismissal===
On March 14, 2000, just before Indiana was to begin play in the NCAA tournament, the CNN/SI network ran a piece on Knight in which former player [[Neil Reed]] claimed he had been choked by Knight in a 1997 practice.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Knight Tape: Video captures encounter between IU coach, ex-player|publisher=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]|date=2000-09-09|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/thenetwork/news/2000/04/11/knight_cnnsi/|accessdate=2008-09-29}}</ref> Knight denied the claims in the story. However, less than a month later, [[CNN Sports Illustrated]] aired a tape of an IU practice from 1997 that appeared to show Knight placing his hand on the neck of Neil Reed.<ref name="Fired">[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/09/11/knight.protest.02 CNN.com - Fired Bob Knight calms angry student demonstrators - September 11, 2000]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref>

In response, Indiana University president [[Myles Brand]] announced that spring he had adopted a "zero tolerance" policy with regard to Bob Knight's behavior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/people/k/knight_bob/knight.html |title=Bob Knight - Former Indiana University basketball coach |publisher=.indystar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref> Later in the year, in September 2000, Indiana [[first year|freshman]] Kent Harvey reportedly said, "Hey, Knight, what's up?" to Knight. According to Harvey, Knight then grabbed him by the arm and lectured him for not showing proper respect, insisting that Harvey address him as either "Mr. Knight" or "Coach Knight" instead of simply "Knight."<ref name="Fired" /> Brand stated that this incident was only one of numerous complaints that occurred after the zero-tolerance policy had been placed on Knight. He asked Knight to resign on September 10. When Knight refused, however, Brand relieved him of his coaching duties effective immediately. Knight's dismissal was met with outrage from students. That night, thousands of Indiana students marched from Indiana University's Assembly Hall to Brand's home, burning him in effigy.<ref name="Fired" />

Harvey was supported by some and vilified by many who claim he had intentionally set up Knight. Kent Harvey's stepfather, Mark Shaw, was a former Bloomington-area radio talk show host and Knight critic.<ref>Threats Follow Knight Dismissal - http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/09/11/sports/main232140.shtml</ref> On September 13, Knight said goodbye to a crowd of some 6,000 supporters in Dunn Meadow at Indiana University. He asked that they not hold a grudge against Harvey and that they continue to support the basketball team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/bobknight_farewell |title=Internet Archive: Details: Coach Bob Knight's Farewell Address to Indiana University |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref> Knight's firing made national headlines, including the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' and around the clock coverage on ESPN. It was also covered heavily on major news programs such as CBS News and CNN.

==International coaching==
In 1979 Knight guided the United States Pan American team to a gold medal in Puerto Rico. In 1984 Knight led the [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. national team]] to a gold medal in the [[1984 Summer Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] as coach of the [[Basketball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 basketball team]] (coaches do not receive medals in the Olympics). Players on the team included [[Michael Jordan]] and Knight's Indiana player and protege [[Steve Alford]].

==Texas Tech Red Raiders==
[[File:Bob-Knight-Nov-21-07-1.jpg|thumb|right|Knight watches his team practice in November 2007.]]
After taking a season off following his dismissal from Indiana, all the while on the lookout for vacancies, Knight accepted the head coaching job at [[Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball|Texas Tech]], though his hiring was opposed by a group of faculty led by Walter Schaller.<ref name="The New York Times">{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E4D7163DF936A25750C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=COLLEGE BASKETBALL; At Texas Tech, Some Professors Balk at Knight | first=Liz | last=Robbins | date=2001-03-15 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> At the press conference introducing him, Knight quipped, "This is without question the most comfortable red sweater I've had on in six years."<ref>{{cite news|last=Drape |first=Joe |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E6D9123CF937A15750C0A9679C8B63&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |title=COLLEGE BASKETBALL; Texas Tech Will Be Knight's New Home |publisher=New York Times |date=2001-03-24 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref>

Knight quickly improved the program, which had not been to an NCAA tournament since 1996. He led the [[Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball|Red Raiders]] to postseason appearances in each of his first four years at the school (three NCAA Championship tournaments and one NIT). After a rough 2006 season, the team improved in 2007, finishing 21–13 and again making it to the NCAA Championship tournament, where it lost to [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]] in the first round. The best performance by the Red Raiders under Knight came in 2005 when they advanced as far as the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet Sixteen]]. In both 2006 and 2007 under Knight, Texas Tech defeated two Top 10-ranked teams in consecutive weeks. During Knight's first six years at Texas Tech, the Red Raiders won 126 games, an average of 21 wins per season.

On February 4, 2008, Bob Knight retired as head coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders. His son [[Pat Knight]], the head coach designate since 2005, was immediately named as his successor. The younger Knight stated that, after many years of coaching, his father was exhausted and ready to retire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/seth_davis/02/05/davis.night/|title='He was just worn out':Pat Knight sheds light on father's decision to leave|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=2008-02-05|date=2008-02-05|author=Davis, Seth}}</ref> Just after achieving his 900th win, Knight handed the job over to Pat in the mid-season in part to allow him to get acquainted with coaching the team earlier, instead of having him wait until October, the start of the next season.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/seth_davis/02/05/davis.night/ | work=CNN | title=Pat Knight sheds light on father's decision to leave | date=2008-02-05 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> Following retirement Knight continued living in Lubbock.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/sports/ncaabasketball/05knight.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin|title=Bob Knight Resigns as Coach of Texas Tech|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2008-02-04|date=2008-02-04|author=Evans, Thayer and Pete Thamel}}</ref>

==Life after coaching==
In 2008, Knight was hired as a studio analyst and occasional color commentator by ESPN.<ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=3269476</ref> In November 2012, he called an Indiana Men's Basketball game for the first time, something he had previously refused to do. Current [[Indiana Hoosiers]] Men's basketball coach [[Tom Crean]] has reached out to Knight in an attempt to get him to visit the school again. Knight has thus far rebuffed all attempts to bring him back to Bloomington.<ref>http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/26283066/32640014</ref>

==Coaching philosophy==
Bob Knight was an innovator of the [[motion offense]], which he perfected and popularized.<ref name="walker">{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Jeff|title=Knight Developed Motion Offense Through Research, And He's Always Adapting|url=http://www.knight880.com/special/stories/motion.shtml|accessdate=26 April 2012|newspaper=AVALANCHE-JOURNAL}}</ref> The system emphasizes post players setting screens and perimeter players passing the ball until a teammate becomes open for an uncontested [[Jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]] or [[lay-up]]. This required players to be unselfish, disciplined, and effective in setting and using [[screen (basketball)|screens]] to get open. Knight's Army background and his focus on fundamentals, strict discipline, and precision earned him the nickname "General".

Knight's motion offense didn't take shape until his time at Indiana. Prior to that, at Army, he ran a "reverse action" that involved reversing the ball from one side of the floor to the other and screening along with it.<ref name="walker"/> According to Knight, it was a "West Coast offense" that [[Pete Newell]] used exclusively during his coaching career. After being exposed to the [[Princeton offense]], Knight instilled more cutting with the offense he employed, which evolved into the motion offense that he ran for most of his career.<ref name="walker"/> Knight continued to develop the offense, instituting different cuts over the years and putting his players in different scenarios. 

Knight was well known for the extreme preparation he put into each game and practice. He was often quoted as saying, "Most people have the will to win, few have the will to prepare to win."<ref>{{cite news|last=Kasakove|first=Evan|title=The legacy of Bob Knight|url=http://www.muhlenbergweekly.com/the-legacy-of-bob-knight-1.2498342#.T5qe87NumWg|accessdate=27 April 2012|newspaper=The Muhlenberg Weekly|date=13 April 2011}}</ref> Often during practice, Knight would instruct his players to a certain spot on the floor and give them options of what to do based on how the defense might react.<ref name="walker"/> In contrast to set plays, Knight's offense was designed to react according to the defense. 

The [[Three-point field goal|3-point shot]] was adopted nationally in the NCAA in 1986, mid-way through Knight's coaching career. Although he opposed the rule change throughout his life, it did compliment his offense well by improving the spacing on the floor.<ref name="walker"/> Knight's offense also emphasized a two-count.<ref name="walker"/> Players in the post are expected to try and post in the paint for two seconds and if they don't receive the ball they go set a screen. Players with the ball are expected to hold the ball for two seconds to see where they are going to take it. Screens are supposed to be held for two seconds, as well.

On defense Knight was known for emphasizing tenacious "man-to-man" defense where defenders contest every pass and every shot, and to help teammates when needed. However, Knight has also incorporated a zone defense periodically after eschewing that defense for the first two decades of his coaching career.<ref name="Tribute">{{cite web|url=http://www.knight880.com/special/stories/quotes.shtml |title=Tribute to Coach Bob Knight present by the '&#39;Lubbock-Avalanche-Journal'&#39; |publisher=Knight 880 |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref>

Knight's coaching also included a firm emphasis on academics. All but four of his four-year players completed degrees, a ratio of nearly 98 percent. Nearly 80 percent of his players graduated compared to the national average of 42 percent for Division I schools.<ref>{{cite news|last=Suellentrop|first=Chris|title=Bob Knight|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2002/03/bob_knight.html|accessdate=26 April 2012|newspaper=Slate|date=15 March 2002}}</ref>

==Legacy==

===Accomplishments===
Bob Knight's all time coaching record is 902-371. His 902 wins in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] men's college basketball games is third all-time to Jim Boeheim, and his former player, [[Mike Krzyzewski]]. Knight achieved his 880th career win on January 1, 2007 and passed retired North Carolina coach [[Dean Smith]] for most career victories, a title he held until his win total was surpassed by Krzyzewski on November 15, 2011. Knight is the youngest coach to reach 200 (age 35), 300 (age 40) and 400 (age 44) wins. He was also among the youngest to reach other milestones of 500 (age 48) and 600 (age 52) wins.

[[Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball|Texas Tech]]'s participation in the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2007 NCAA Tournament]] gave Knight more NCAA Tournaments appearances than any other coach.<ref name="ESPY" /> He is the only coach to win the NCAA, the NIT, an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] Gold medal, and a [[Pan American Games]] Gold medal.<ref name="ESPY">{{cite web | url=http://texastech.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/062707aad.html | title=Bob Knight nominated for ESPY Award | publisher=CSTV.com | date=2007-06-27 | accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> Knight is also one of only three people, along with [[Dean Smith]] and [[Joe B. Hall]], who had both played on and coached a winning NCAA championship basketball team.

===Recognition===
Knight received a number of personal honors during and after his coaching career. He was named the National Coach of the Year four times (1975, 1976, 1987, 1989) and Big Ten Coach of the Year eight times (1973, 1975, 1976, 1980, 1981, 1989, 1992, 1993). In 1975 he was a unanimous selection as National Coach of the Year, an honor he was accorded again in 1976 by Associated Press, United Press International, and Basketball Weekly. In 1987 he was the first person to be honored with the [[Naismith College Coach of the Year|Naismith Coach of the Year Award]]. In 1989 he garnered National Coach of the Year honors by the AP, UPI, and the United States Basketball Writers Association. Knight was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 1991.

On November 17, 2006, Knight was recognized for his impact on college basketball as a member of the founding class of the [[National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame]]. The following year he was the recipient of the [[Naismith Outstanding Contribution to Basketball|Naismith Award for Men's Outstanding Contribution to Basketball]].<ref name="Naismith">{{cite news | url=http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2007/03/30/Sports/Knight.To.Receive.Naismith.Award-2813903.shtml?reffeature=htmlemailedition | title=Knight to receive Naismith award | publisher=[[The Daily Toreador]] | date=2007-03-30 | accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref> Knight was also inducted into the [[United States Military Academy|Army]] Sports Hall of Fame (Class of 2008) and the [[Indiana Hoosiers]] athletics Hall of Fame (Class of 2009). In August 2003, he was honored as the first inductee in The Vince Lombardi Titletown Legends.

===Coaching tree===
{{Main|Coaching legacy of Bob Knight}}
A number of assistant coaches, players, and managers of Knight have gone on to be coaches. Among them are Hall of Fame [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]], UCLA coach [[Steve Alford]] and NBA coaches [[Randy Wittman]], [[Mike Woodson]], [[Keith Smart]] Evansville Coach [[Marty Simmons]], St. Louis Coach [[Jim Crews]] and [[Lawrence Frank]].

==In the media==

===Books about Knight===
In 1986 author [[John Feinstein]] published ''[[A Season on the Brink]]'', which detailed the [[1985–86 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1985-86 season]] of the [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana Hoosiers]]. Granted almost unprecedented access to the Indiana basketball program, as well as insights into Knight's private life, the book quickly became a major best-seller and spawned a new genre, as a legion of imitators wrote works covering a single year of a sports franchise. In the book Feinstein depicts a coach who is quick with a violent temper, but also one who never cheats and strictly follows all of the NCAA's rules. 

Two years later author Joan Mellen penned the book ''Bob Knight: His Own Man'' (ISBN 0-380-70809-4), in part to rebut Feinstein's ''A Season on the Brink''. Mellen deals with seemingly all the causes celebres in Knight's career and presents the view that he is more sinned against than sinning. 

A number of close associates and friends of Knight have also written books about him. Former player and current [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] head basketball coach [[Steve Alford]] wrote ''Playing for Knight: My Six Seasons with Bobby Knight'', published in 1990. 

Knight's autobiography, written with longtime friend and sports journalist Bob Hammel, was titled ''Knight: My Story'' and published in 2003. Three years later Steve Delsohn and Mark Heisler wrote ''Bob Knight: An Unauthorized Biography''.

===Film and television===
Knight has appeared or been featured in numerous films and television productions. In [[1994 in film|1994]] a feature film titled ''[[Blue Chips]]'' was about Pete Bell, a volatile but honest college basketball coach under pressure to win who decides to blatantly violate NCAA rules to field a competitive team after a sub-par season. It starred [[Nick Nolte]] as Bell and NBA star [[Shaquille O'Neal]] as Neon Bodeaux, a once-in-a-lifetime player Bell woos to his school with gifts and other perks. The coach's temper and wardrobe were modeled after Knight's, though at no time has Knight been known to illegally recruit. Knight himself appears in the movie and coaches against Nolte in the film's climactic game.

[[ESPN]]'s first feature-length film was ''[[A Season on the Brink]]'', a 2002 TV adaptation from John Feinstein's book. In the movie Knight is played by veteran character actor [[Brian Dennehy]]. ESPN also featured Knight in a [[reality television|reality show]] titled ''[[Knight School (TV series)|Knight School]]'', which followed a handful of [[Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball|Texas Tech]] students as they competed for the right to join the basketball team as a non-scholarship player.

Knight made a cameo appearance as himself in the 2003 film ''[[Anger Management (film)|Anger Management]]''. In 2008, Knight appeared in a commercial as part of [[Volkswagen]]'s Das Auto series where Max, a 1964 black [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]] interviews famous people. When Knight talked about Volkswagen winning the best resale value award in 2008, Max replied, "At least one of us is winning a title this year." This prompted Knight to throw his chair off the stage and walk out saying, "I may not be retired."<ref>{{cite web|title=Angry Bob Knight Yells At Volkswagen|publisher=Jalopnik|url=http://jalopnik.com/377439/angry-bob-knight-yells-at-volkswagen|accessdate=2008-09-29}}</ref>

Knight also made an appearance in a TV commercial for [[Guitar Hero: Metallica]] with fellow coaches [[Mike Krzyzewski]], [[Rick Pitino]], and [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]], in a parody of [[Tom Cruise]] in ''[[Risky Business]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/sports/story/1464998.html|title=Roy, Coach K take a turn as 'Guitar Heroes'|last=van der Horst|first=Roger|date=2009-03-31|work=[[The News & Observer]]|accessdate=2009-03-31}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In 2009, Knight produced 3 instructional coaching DVD libraries—on motion offense, man-to-man defense, and instilling mental toughness—with Championship Productions.

==Family and charity==
[[File:Bobknight.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Knight and his son [[Pat Knight|Pat]] while coaching at Texas Tech.]]
Knight married Nancy Lou on April 17, 1963 and the two divorced in 1985. Together they had two sons, Tim and [[Pat Knight|Pat]]. Pat played at Indiana from 1991–95 and is now head coach at [[Lamar Cardinals basketball|Lamar]]. In 1988 Knight married Karen Vieth Edgar, a former Oklahoma high school basketball coach.

Knight has a high regard for education and has made generous donations to the schools he has been a part of, particularly libraries. At [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] Knight endowed two chairs, one in history and one in law. He also raised nearly $5 million for the Indiana University library system by championing a library fund to support the library's activities. The fund was ultimately named in his honor.

When Knight came to Texas Tech in 2001, he gave $10,000 to the library, the first gift to the Coach Knight Library Fund which has now collected over $300,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2007/11/30/LaVida/A.Knights.Tale.Tech.Library.Honors.Coach.Knight.For.Donations.Generosity-3124358.shtml?reffeature=htmlemailedition |title=A Knight's Tale: Tech library honors coach Knight for donations, generosity - La Vida |publisher=Media.www.dailytoreador.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref> On November 29, 2007, the Texas Tech library honored this with ''A Legacy of Giving: The Bob Knight Exhibit''.

==Criticism and controversy==
<!--Any unsourced or poorly sourced material added to this section will be removed immediately per biographies of living persons policy. See Talk page for more details. -->

===1970s===
*It was reported (although years after the incident) that Knight choked and punched IU's longtime sports information director, Kit Klingelhoffer,<!-- citation has name incorrectly spelled "Klinglhofer" with one "h" --> in the 1970s, over a news release that upset the coach.<ref name="www2.indystar.com"/>

* On December 7, 1974, Indiana and Kentucky met in the regular season in Bloomington with a 98-74 Indiana win. Near the end of the game, Bob Knight went to the Kentucky bench where the official was standing to complain about a call. Before he left, Knight hit Kentucky coach [[Joe B. Hall]] in the back of the head.<ref>{{cite web|title=Recapping the rivalry|url=http://kentucky.247sports.com/Article/Recapping-the-top-5-games-in-the-Kentucky-Indiana-hoops-rivalry-52292|accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> UK's assistant coach Lynn Nance, a former FBI agent who was about 6 feet 5 inches, had to be restrained by Hall from hitting Knight. Hall later said, "It publicly humiliated me."<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Atlanta Constitution Journal|date=28 February 1982}}</ref>  Knight said the slap to the head was something he has done, "affectionately" to his own players for years. "But maybe someone would not like that," he said. "If Joe didn't like it, I offer an apology. I don't apologize for the intent." ... "Hall and I have been friends for a long time," Knight said. "If he wants to dissolve the friendship, that's up to him."<ref>{{cite news|last=Laudeman|first=Tev|newspaper=Louisville Courier Journal|date=8 December 1974}}</ref> Knight blamed the furor on Hall, noting in his inimitable style, "If it was meant to be malicious, I'd have blasted the fucker into the seats."<ref>{{cite book|last=Delsohn|first=Steve|title=Bob Knight: The Unauthorized Biography|year=2006|publisher=Simon & Schuster|page=96}}</ref>

*During the 1979 Pan American Games in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Knight was accused of assaulting a police officer while coaching the US Basketball team before a practice session. He was later convicted in absentia to a six-month jail sentence, but extradition efforts by the Puerto Rican government were not successful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Knight_Bob.html |title=ESPN Classic Sportscentury Biography |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref>

===1980s===
*In a game at Bloomington on January 31, 1981 between Indiana and Purdue, Hoosier star [[Isiah Thomas]] allegedly hit Purdue guard [[Roosevelt Barnes (American football)|Roosevelt Barnes]] in what some critics described as a "sucker punch".<ref>{{cite book|last=Challen|first=Paul|title=The Isiah Thomas Story|year=2004|publisher=ECW Press|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=1-55022-662-2}}</ref> Video replay shown by Knight later showed Barnes had mistakenly thrown the first punch, and that Thomas was merely reacting to this. When the two schools played their second game of the season at Purdue on February 7, 1981, Knight claimed a number of derisive chants were directed at him, his wife, and Indiana University. In response Knight invited Purdue athletic director George King on his weekly television show to discuss the matter, but King declined. Therefore, in place of King, Knight brought onto the show a "jackass" (male [[donkey]]) wearing a Purdue hat as a representative of Purdue.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=John|title=Knight Infamous Prankster|accessdate=6 May 2012|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate|date=26 March 1981}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Knight & the Purdue Mascot|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdm4Oi1YRZY|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref> The [[1980–81 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1980–81 Hoosiers]] would go on to win the [[1981 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1981 NCAA National Championship]], the school's fourth national title.

*On Saturday, February 23, 1985 in game at Bloomington between Purdue and Indiana, with just five minutes into the game, a scramble for a loose ball resulted in a foul call on Indiana's Daryl Thomas.  Knight, irate, insisted the call should have been for a [[jump ball]] and ultimately received a [[technical foul]].  Purdue's Steve Reid stepped to the [[free throw line]] to shoot the resulting free throws, but before he could Knight grabbed a red plastic chair from Indiana's bench and threw it across the floor toward the basket in front of Reid. Knight was ejected from the game. He apologized for his actions the next day and was given a one-game suspension and two years' probation from the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]].  Since the incident, Knight has occasionally joked about throwing the chair by saying that he saw an old lady standing on the opposite sideline and threw her the chair so she could sit down.<ref>{{cite news|title=Knight chair toss resonates 20 years later|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/7008442/|accessdate=6 May 2012|newspaper=NBC Sports|date=21 February 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bobby Knight Throws a Chair|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvRO2GE4x4M|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>

*Women's groups nationwide were outraged by Knight's comments during an April 1988 interview with [[Connie Chung]] in which he said, "I think that if rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it" (the comment had already had gotten weatherman [[Tex Antoine]] fired from [[WABC-TV]] in New York 12 years earlier and would ultimately derail the Texas gubernatorial bid of [[Clayton Williams]] two years later).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/big12/2006-11-14-knight-timeline_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Bob Knight's outburst timeline | date=2006-11-14 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> Knight's comment was in reference to an Indiana basketball game in which he felt the referees were making poor calls against the Hoosiers.

===1990s===
*At a practice leading up to an Indiana-Purdue game in West Lafayette in 1991, Bob Knight unleashed a torrent of expletives and threats designed to motivate his Indiana team. In one portion he exclaims he is "f**king tired of losing to Purdue." Unknown to most, someone was secretly taping the speech. The speech has since gone viral and has over 1.84 million views on YouTube alone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bobby Knight - angry motivational speech|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw7KijRfU-c|publisher=YouTube}}</ref> Although the source of who taped the speech remains unknown, many former players suspect it was former manager and current [[NBA]] coach [[Lawrence Frank]]. Players who were present were unable to remember the speech because such expletive-filled outbursts by Knight were so frequent.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Tom|title=Did Lawrence Frank Tape Classic Knight Tirade?|url=http://www.indycornrows.com/2008/2/18/14524/2873|accessdate=9 May 2012|newspaper=Indy Cornrows|date=18 February 2008}}</ref>

*In March 1992 prior to the NCAA regional finals, controversy erupted after Knight playfully mock whipped Indiana players [[Calbert Cheaney]] and Pat Graham during practice. The bullwhip had been given to Knight as a gift from his team. Several black leaders complained at the racial connotations of the act (Cheaney is black.)<ref>(''Knight: My Story'', pg. 297.)</ref>

*In January 1993, Knight mentioned the arrival of [[Ivan Renko]] to his team, as a trap to expose unreputable basketball recruiting experts. Even though Renko was completely fictitious, several recruiting services started listing him as a prospect.

*Knight was shown berating an NCAA volunteer at a March 1995 post-game press conference following a 65&ndash;60 loss to Missouri in the first round of the NCAA tournament held in Boise, Idaho. The volunteer, Rance Pugmire, informed the press that Knight would not be attending the press conference, when in reality, Knight was running a few minutes late and had planned on attending per NCAA rules. Knight was shown saying: "You've only got two people that are going to tell you I'm not going to be here. One is our SID [Sports Information Director], and the other is me. Who the hell told you I wasn't going to be here? I'd like to know. Do you have any idea who it was?...Who?...They were from Indiana, right?...No, they weren't from Indiana, and you didn't get it from anybody from Indiana, did you?...No, I—I'll handle this the way I want to handle it now that I'm here. You (EXPLETIVE) it up to begin with. Now just sit there or leave. I don't give (EXPLETIVE) what you do. Now back to the game."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/page2/tvlistings/show3transcript.html |title=ESPN.com - Page2 - Outside the Lines - Bob Knight: The Final Crisis? |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref>

*Former IU player [[Neil Reed]] alleged that Knight had grabbed him by the neck in a choking manner during a 1997 practice. A videotape of the incident was shown on CNN.<ref name="www2.indystar.com"/>

===2000s===
*On February 19, 2000, Clarence Doninger, Knight's boss, alleged to have been physically threatened by the coach during a confrontation after a game.<ref name="www2.indystar.com"/>

*An IU investigation inquired about an allegation in which Knight berated and physically intimidated a university secretary, once throwing a potted plant in anger, showering her with glass and debris. The University later asked the coach to issue an apology to the secretary.<ref name="www2.indystar.com"/>

*It was alleged that Knight attacked assistant coach Ron Felling, throwing him out of a chair after overhearing him criticizing the basketball program in a phone conversation.<ref name="www2.indystar.com"/>

*On September 8, 2000, IU freshman Kent Harvey told campus police Knight grabbed him roughly by the arm and berated him for speaking to the coach disrespectfully. Knight admitted putting his hand on the student's arm and lecturing him on civility, but denied that he was rough or raised his voice. The coach was fired from IU two days later.<ref name="www2.indystar.com"/>

*Two days after Knight was fired from Indiana University, [[Jeremy Schaap]] of [[ESPN]] interviewed him and discussed his time at Indiana. Towards the end of the interview, Knight talked about his son, Patrick, who had also been dismissed by the university, wanting an opportunity to be a head coach. Schaap, thinking that Knight was finished, attempted to move on to another subject, but Knight insisted on continuing about his son. Schaap repeatedly tried to ask another question when Knight shifted the conversation to Schaap's style of interviewing, notably chastising him about interruptions. Knight then commented (referring to Schaap's father, [[Dick Schaap]]), "You've got a long way to go to be as good as your dad!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/people/k/knight_bob/interview.html|title=Bob Knight interview|work=[[The Indianapolis Star]]}}</ref>
*In March 2006, a student's heckling at [[Baylor University]] resulted in Knight having to be restrained by a police officer. The incident was not severe enough to warrant any action from the [[Big 12 Conference]].<ref>{{cite news| author=Keith Whitmire | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/colleges/texastech/stories/030306dnspoknight.1c4691b0.html | title=Big 12 won't take action against Knight | publisher=[[The Dallas Morning News]] | date=2006-03-02}}</ref>
*On November 13, 2006, Knight was shown allegedly hitting player Michael Prince under the chin to get him to make eye contact. Although Knight didn't comment on the incident afterwards and has not yet done so, Prince, his parents, and Texas Tech Athletic Director [[Gerald Myers]] insisted that Knight did nothing wrong and that he merely lifted Prince's chin and told him, "Hold your head up and don't worry about mistakes. Just play the game." Prince commented, "He was trying to teach me and I had my head down so he raised my chin up. He was telling me to go out there and don't be afraid to make mistakes. He said I was being too hard on myself."<ref name="controversy">{{cite news | url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/chad/4350211.html | title=Viewing the Knight file, through fact and fiction | author=Chad, Norman | publisher=Houston Chronicle | date=2006-11-20 | accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref>
*On October 21, 2007, James Simpson of [[Lubbock, Texas]], accused Knight of firing a shotgun in his direction after he yelled at Knight and another man for hunting too close to his home.<ref>{{cite news| author=Brandon George | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/stories/112907dnspoknight.4acb07d7.html | title=Bob Knight's hunting dispute on video | work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] | date=2007-11-29}}</ref> Knight denied the allegations.

* On December 17, 2009, Knight insulted longtime rival [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] and its coach [[John Calipari]], saying, "We've gotten into this situation where integrity is really lacking and that's why I'm glad I'm not coaching. You see we've got a coach at Kentucky, who put two schools <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[UMass Minutemen basketball|UMass]] and [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> on probation and he's still coaching. I really don't understand that."

===2010s===
* On April 18, 2011, video surfaced showing Knight responding to a question concerning John Calipari and the [[University of Kentucky]] men's basketball team by stating that in [[2009–10 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|the previous season]], Kentucky made an Elite Eight appearance with "five players who had not attended a single class that semester." These claims were later disproven by the University and the players in question, including [[Patrick Patterson (basketball)|Patrick Patterson]], who graduated in three years, and [[John Wall (basketball)|John Wall]], who finished the semester in question with a 3.5 GPA.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kentucky responds to Bob Knight's 'blatantly erroneous' comments|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/campusrivalry/post/2011/04/bob-knight-kentucky-john-calipari-mitch-barnhart-/1 | work=USA Today | date=2011-04-19}}</ref> Knight later apologized for his comments stating, "My overall point is that 'one-and-dones' are not healthy for college basketball.
