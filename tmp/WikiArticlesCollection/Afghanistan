Historically, the name ''"Afghan"'' mainly designated the [[Pashtun people]], the largest [[Ethnic groups in Afghanistan|ethnic group of Afghanistan]].<ref name="Afghan">{{cite encyclopedia |author=Ch.

[[Al-Biruni]] referred to them in the 11th century as various tribes living on the western frontier mountains of the [[Indus River]], which would be the [[Sulaiman Mountains]].<ref name="EofI">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Morgenstierne |first=G. |title=AFGHĀN |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam |edition=CD-ROM v. 1.0 |publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV |year=1999}}</ref> [[Ibn Battuta]], a famous [[Moroccan people|Moroccan]] scholar visiting the region in 1333, writes: "We travelled on to [[Kabulistan|Kabul]], formerly a vast town, the site of which is now occupied by a village inhabited by a tribe of Persians called ''Afghans''. They hold mountains and defiles and possess considerable strength, and are mostly highwaymen. Their principle mountain is called [[Sulaiman Mountains|Kuh Sulayman]]."<ref name="Routledge"/> One prominent 16th-century Persian scholar explains extensively about the Afghans. For example, he writes:
{{quote|"The men of Kábul and [[Khilji dynasty|Khilj]] also went home; and whenever they were questioned about the Musulmáns of the Kohistán (the mountains), and how matters stood there, they said, "Don't call it Kohistán, but Afghánistán; for there is nothing there but Afgháns and disturbances." Thus it is clear that for this reason the people of the country call their home in [[Pashto language|their own language]] Afghánistán, and themselves Afgháns."<ref name="Firishta"/>|[[Firishta]]|1560–1620 AD}}

It is widely acknowledged that the terms ''"Pashtun"'' and ''Afghan'' are [[synonyms]],<ref name="Afghan" /> something that is even mentioned in the 17th-century poetry of [[Khushal Khan Khattak]]: For example, he states: "Pull out your sword and slay any one, that says Pashtun and Afghan are not one! Arabs know this and so do Romans: Afghans are Pashtuns, Pashtuns are Afghans!"<ref>Extract from "Passion of the Afghan" by [[Khushal Khan Khattak]]; translated by C. Biddulph in ''Afghan Poetry Of The 17th Century: Selections from the Poems of Khushal Khan Khattak'', London, 1890.</ref>

The last part of the name, ''[[-stan|-stān]]'' is a [[Persian language|Persian]] [[suffix]] for "place". The name ''"Afghanistan"'' is described by the 16th century Mughal Emperor [[Babur]] in his [[Baburnama|memoirs]] as well as by the later Persian scholar [[Firishta]] and Babur's descendants, referring to the traditional ethnic Pashtun territories between the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains and the Indus River.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian//pf?file=03501051&ct=92|title=Events Of The Year 910|accessdate=22 August 2010|author=[[Babur|Zahir ud-Din Mohammad Babur]]|work=[[Baburnama|Memoirs of Babur]]|publisher=[[Packard Humanities Institute]] |year=1525}}</ref> In the early 19th century, [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan politicians]] decided to adopt the name ''Afghanistan'' for the entire [[Durrani Empire|Afghan Empire]] after its English translation had already appeared in various treaties with [[Qajar dynasty|Qajarid Persia]] and [[British Raj|British India]].<ref>E. Huntington, ''"The Anglo-Russian Agreement as to Tibet, Afghanistan, and Persia"'', Bulletin of the American Geographical Society, Vol. 39, No. 11 (1907).</ref> In 1857, in his review of [[John William Kaye|J.W. Kaye's]] ''The Afghan War'', [[Friedrich Engels]] describes "Afghanistan" as:
{{quote|"an extensive country of Asia&nbsp;... between Persia and the Indies, and in the other direction between the Hindu Kush and the Indian Ocean. It formerly included the Persian provinces of [[Khorasan Province|Khorassan]] and [[Quhistan|Kohistan]], together with [[Herat Province|Herat]], [[Balochistan|Beluchistan]], [[Kashmir|Cashmere]], and [[Sindh|Sinde]], and a considerable part of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]&nbsp;... Its principal cities are Kabul, the capital, [[Ghazni|Ghuznee]], [[Peshwar|Peshawer]], and [[Kandahar]]."<ref name="Engels"/>}}

The Afghan kingdom was sometimes referred to as the ''[[Durrani Empire|Kingdom of Kabul]]'', as mentioned by the British statesman and historian [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]].<ref>[[Mountstuart Elphinstone|Elphinstone, M.]], ''"Account of the Kingdom of Cabul and its Dependencies in Persia and India"'', 1815; published by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme & Brown.</ref> Afghanistan was officially recognized as a [[sovereign state]] by the international community after the [[Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919]] was signed.<ref>M.

The country sits at a unique nexus point where numerous civilizations have interacted and often fought. It has been home to various peoples through the ages, among them the [[ancient Iranian peoples]] who established the dominant role of [[Indo-Iranian languages]] in the region. At multiple points, the land has been incorporated within large regional empires, among them the [[Achaemenid Empire]], the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian Empire]], the [[Maurya Empire|Indian Maurya Empire]], the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Islamic Empire]] and the [[Sassanid Empire]].

Many kingdoms have also risen to power in what is now Afghanistan, such as the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrians]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], [[Hephthalites]], [[Kabul Shahi]]s, [[Saffarid Dynasty|Saffarids]], [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]], [[Kartids]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], and finally the [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotaki]] and [[Durrani dynasty|Durrani]] dynasties that marked the political origins of the modern state.

He was succeeded by his son, [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur Shah]], who transferred the capital of Afghanistan from Kandahar to Kabul in 1776. After Timur Shah's death in 1793, the Durrani throne passed down to his son [[Zaman Shah Durrani|Zaman Shah]] followed by [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]], [[Shuja Shah Durrani|Shuja Shah]] and others.

The Afghan Empire was under threat in the early 19th century by the [[Qajar dynasty|Persians]] in the west and the [[British Raj|British]]-backed [[Sikh Empire|Sikhs]] in the east. The western provinces of Khorasan and Kohistan were taken by the Persians in 1800. Fateh Khan, leader of the [[Barakzai dynasty|Barakzai tribe]], had installed 21 of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire. After his death, they rebelled and divided up the provinces of the empire between themselves.

The large defensive wall around the city was removed in the early 1930s by the order of [[Mohammed Nadir Shah|King Nadir]].]]
Following the [[1842 retreat from Kabul|1842 defeat of the British-Indian forces]] and victory of the Afghans, the British established [[foreign relations of Afghanistan|diplomatic relations]] with the Afghan government but withdrew all forces from the country. They returned during the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] in the late 1870s for about two-year military operations, which was to assist [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] defeat [[Mohammad Ayub Khan|Ayub Khan]]. The United Kingdom began to exercise a great deal of influence after this and even controlled the state's [[foreign policy]]. In 1893, [[Mortimer Durand]] made Amir Abdur Rahman Khan sign a controversial [[Durand Line|agreement]] in which the ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] territories were divided by the [[Durand Line]]. This was a standard [[divide and rule]] policy of the British and would lead to strained relations, especially with the later new state of Pakistan.

After the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] and the signing of the [[Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919|Treaty of Rawalpindi]] in 1919, King [[Amānullāh Khān|Amanullah Khan]] declared Afghanistan a [[sovereign state|sovereign]] and fully [[independence|independent state]]. He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community and, following a 1927–28 tour of Europe and [[Turkey]], introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was [[Mahmud Tarzi]], an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's 1923 [[constitution of Afghanistan|constitution]], which made elementary education compulsory. The institution of [[slavery]] was abolished in 1923.<ref>{{cite web|year=1976|publisher=Americana Corporation|title=''[[Encyclopedia Americana|The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 25]]''|page=24}}</ref>

Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional [[burqa]] for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah Khan was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after Kabul fell to rebel forces led by [[Habibullah Kalakani]]. Prince [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]], Amanullah's cousin, in turn defeated and killed Kalakani in November 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favor of a more gradual approach to modernisation but was assassinated in 1933 by [[Abdul Khaliq Hazara (assassin)|Abdul Khaliq]], a [[Hazara people|Hazara]] school student.<ref>{{cite book|title=Culture and customs of Afghanistan |last1=Hafizullah |first1=Emadi |year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0-313-33089-1|page=252|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bY8ck6iktikC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA35#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

[[Mohammed Zahir Shah]], Nadir Shah's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. Until 1946 Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another of Zahir Shah's uncles, [[Shah Mahmud Khan]], became Prime Minister in 1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. He was replaced in 1953 by [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud Khan sought a closer relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] and a more distant one towards Pakistan. Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in [[World War II]], nor aligned with either power bloc in the [[Cold War]]. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports and other vital infrastructure. In 1973, while King Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit, Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first [[President of Afghanistan]].

===Marxist revolution and Soviet war===

In April 1978, the communist [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) seized power in Afghanistan in the [[Saur Revolution]]. Within months, opponents of the communist government launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a [[Afghan Civil War|civil war]] waged by guerrilla [[mujahideen]] against government forces countrywide. The [[Pakistan]]i government provided these rebels with covert training centers, while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government.<ref>{{cite book| last=Hussain| first =Rizwan| title= Pakistan And The Emergence Of Islamic Militancy In Afghanistan|publisher= Ashgate Publishing| year=2005|pages=108–109|isbn=0-7546-4434-0}}</ref> Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA&nbsp;— the dominant [[Khalq]] and the more moderate [[Parcham]]&nbsp;— resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup. By mid-1979, the United States had started a covert program to assist the mujahideen.<ref>{{cite book| last=Meher| first =Jagmohan| title= America's Afghanistan War: The Success that Failed|publisher= Gyan Books| year=2004|pages=68–69, 94|isbn=81-7835-262-1}}</ref>

In September 1979, Khalqist President [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] was assassinated in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member [[Hafizullah Amin]], who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979. A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's [[Babrak Karmal]] but inclusive of both factions, filled the vacuum. Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government did not expect to do most of the fighting in Afghanistan. As a result, however, the Soviets were now directly involved in what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite book| last=Kalinovsky| first = Artemy M.| title= A Long Goodbye: The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan|publisher= Harvard University Press| year=2011|pages=25–28|isbn=978-0-674-05866-8}}</ref>

At the time some believed the Soviets were attempting to expand their borders southward in order to gain a foothold in the [[Middle East]]. The Soviet Union had long lacked a [[warm water port]], and their movement south seemed to position them for further expansion toward [[Pakistan]] in the East, and [[Iran]] to the West. American politicians, Republicans and Democrats alike, feared the Soviets were positioning themselves for a takeover of [[Middle East]]ern oil. Others believed that the Soviet Union was afraid Iran's [[Islamic Revolution]] and Afghanistan's [[Islamization]] would spread to the millions of Muslims in the USSR. The PDPA prohibited [[usury]], made statements on [[women's rights in Afghanistan|women's rights]] by declaring equality of the sexes<ref name=autogenerated4 /> and introducing women to political life.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0028) |title=Afghanistan |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] |accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Reagan sitting with people from the Afghanistan-Pakistan region in February 1983.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] with a group of [[mujahideen]] representatives at the [[White House]] in 1983.]]
After the invasion, President [[Jimmy Carter]] announced what became known as the [[Carter Doctrine]]: that the U.S. would not allow any other outside force to gain control of the [[Persian Gulf]]. He terminated the Soviet Wheat Deal in January 1980, which was intended to establish trade with USSR and lessen [[Cold War]] tensions. The grain exports had been beneficial to people employed in agriculture, and the [[1980 grain embargo|Carter embargo]] marked the beginning of hardship for American farmers. That same year, Carter also made two of the most unpopular decisions of his entire Presidency: prohibiting American athletes from participating in the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, and reinstating registration for the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] for young males.  Following the Soviet invasion, the United States supported diplomatic efforts to achieve a Soviet withdrawal. In addition, generous U.S. contributions to the refugee program in Pakistan played a major part in efforts to assist [[Afghan refugees]].

The [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] increased arming and funding of the mujahideen as part of the [[Reagan Doctrine]], thanks in large part to the efforts of [[Charlie Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]] and CIA officer [[Gust Avrakotos]]. Early reports estimated $6–20 billion<ref name="greenleft">{{cite web|year=2001 |url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/24198 |title=How the CIA created Osama bin Laden |publisher=greenleft.org.au}}</ref> but more recent reports suggest that up to $40 billion were provided by the U.S. and [[Saudi Arabia]] to Pakistan.<ref name="The Brunei Times">{{cite web|year=2009 |url=http://www.bt.com.bn/analysis/2008/12/17/story_of_us_cia_and_taliban |title=Story of US, CIA and Taliban |work=[[The Brunei Times]]}}</ref><ref name="The Nation">{{cite web|year=1999 |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/cost-afghan-victory?page=0,1 |title=The Cost of an Afghan 'Victory' |work=[[The Nation]]}}</ref> This was in the forms of cash and weapons, which included over two thousand [[FIM-92 Stinger]] [[surface-to-air missiles]].

After the fall of Najibullah's government in 1992, the Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement (the Peshawar Accords). The accords created the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] and appointed an [[interim government]] for a transitional period to be followed by general elections. According to [[Human Rights Watch]]:

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Provinces of Afghanistan|Districts of Afghanistan}}
Afghanistan is administratively divided into 34 provinces (''[[wilayah|wilayats]]''), with each province having its own capital and a provincial administration. The provinces are further divided into about 398 smaller provincial districts, each of which normally covers a city or a number of villages. Each district is represented by a district governor.

The [[list of current governors of Afghanistan|provincial governors]] are appointed by the [[President of Afghanistan]] and the district governors are selected by the provincial governors. The provincial governors are representatives of the central government in Kabul and are responsible for all administrative and formal issues within their provinces. There are also provincial councils which are elected through direct and general elections for a period of four years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iec.org.af/eng/content.php?id=5&cnid=24 |title=Explaining Elections, Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan |publisher=Iec.org.af |date=9 October 2004 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> The functions of provincial councils are to take part in provincial development planning and to participate in monitoring and appraisal of other provincial governance institutions.

According to article 140 of the constitution and the presidential decree on electoral law, [[mayor]]s of cities should be elected through free and direct elections for a four-year term. However, due to huge election costs, mayoral and municipal elections have never been held. Instead, mayors have been appointed by the government. As for the capital city of Kabul, the mayor is appointed by the President of Afghanistan.

===Foreign relations and military===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Afghanistan|Military of Afghanistan}}

[[File:Afghan soldiers.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Afghan National Army]], including the [[ANA Commando Battalion]] standing in the front.]]
The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] is responsible for managing the foreign relations of Afghanistan. The nation has been a member of the UN since 1946, and has maintained good [[Afghanistan – United States relations|relations with the United States]] and other [[NATO]] member states since the signing of the [[Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919|Anglo-Afghan Treaty in 1919]].

The [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan]] (UNAMA) was established in 2002 under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1401]] to help the nation recover from decades of war and establish a normal functioning government. Today, more than 22 NATO nations deploy about 100,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF). Apart from close military links, the country also enjoys strong economic relations with NATO members and their allies. It also has diplomatic relations with neighboring Pakistan, [[Afghanistan–Iran relations|Iran]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], the [[People's Republic of China]], including regional states such as [[Afghanistan–India relations|India]], [[Afghanistan–Turkey relations|Turkey]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Afghanistan–Russia relations|Russia]], [[United Arab Emirate]], Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt, Japan, South Korea, and others.

[[Afghanistan–Pakistan relations]] have been negatively affected by issues related to the [[Durand Line]], the 1978–present [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|war]] (i.e. Mujahideen, Afghan refugees, Taliban insurgency, and [[Afghanistan–Pakistan skirmishes|border skirmishes]]), including water and the growing [[Afghanistan–India relations|influence of India in Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/world/9387172.asp?gid=244&sz=48187 |title=Afghan officials accuse Pakistan of embassy attack |publisher=Hurriyet |accessdate=13 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.usip.org/resources/resolving-pakistan-afghanistan-stalemate Resolving the Pakistan–Afghanistan Stalemate]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}, United States Institute of Peace, ''Afghanistan and Pakistan have had largely antagonistic relations under all governments''</ref> Afghan officials often allege that Pakistani and Iranian intelligence agencies are involved in terrorist attacks inside Afghanistan, by training and guiding terrorists to carry out attacks.<ref>{{cite news |title=Iran, Pakistan out to weaken Afghanistan, MPs told |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2012/05/20/iran-pakistan-out-weaken-afghanistan-mps-told |publisher=[[Pajhwok Afghan News]] |editor=Abasin Zaheeron |date=May 20, 2012 |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}</ref><ref name="dawn.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/world/13+pakistan+stoking+violence+in+afghanistan+adviser-za-01 |title=World &#124; Pakistan stoking violence in Afghanistan: adviser |publisher=Dawn.Com |date=15 October 2009 |accessdate=29 December 2009}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2011/08/02/stable-afghanistan-interest-region-zardari |title=Stable Afghanistan in the interest of region: Zardari|first=Wasim |last=Yousufzai|publisher=Pajhwok.com |date= 2 August 2011 |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref>  Afghanistan has always depended on Pakistani trade routes for import and export but this has changed in the last decade with the opening of Central Asian and Iranian routes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Asia/What-is-the-Best-Route-for-Supplying-Landlocked-Afghanistan.html|title=What is the Best Route for Supplying Landlocked Afghanistan|work=Oil Price|date=30 January 2012|accessdate=31 January 2012}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> Conversely, Pakistan depends on [[List of rivers of Afghanistan|Afghan water]] and considers Afghanistan as the only trade route to Central Asian resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ca-c.org/dataeng/oxford.shtml|title=The Security of the Caspian Sea Region|work=Murad Esenov, Oxford University Press|year=2001|accessdate=31 January 2012}}</ref>

[[File:ANP trucks in Kunar.jpg|thumb|[[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) in [[Kunar Province]]]]
The [[National Directorate of Security]] (NDS) is the nation's domestic [[intelligence agency]], which operates similar to that of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) and has between 15,000 to 30,000 employees. The nation also has about 126,000 national police officers, with plans to recruit more so that the total number can reach 160,000.<ref name=Pellerindate/> The [[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) is under the [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of the Interior]] and serves as a single [[law enforcement agency]] all across the country. The [[Afghan National Civil Order Police]] is the main branch of the ANP, which is divided into five Brigades and each one commanded by a Brigadier General. These brigades are stationed in Kabul, [[Gardez]], [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], and [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]. Every province has an appointed provincial [[Chief of Police]] who is responsible for [[law enforcement in Afghanistan|law enforcement]] in all the districts within his province.

The south and eastern parts of Afghanistan are the most dangerous due to militant activities and the flourishing drug trade. These particular areas are sometimes patrolled by [[Taliban insurgency|Taliban insurgents]], who often plant [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs) on roads and carry out suicide bombings. Kidnapping and robberies are also reported. Every year [[list of Afghan security forces fatality reports in Afghanistan|many Afghan police officers are killed]] in the line of duty in these areas. The [[Afghan Border Police]] (ABP) are responsible for protecting the nation's airports and borders, especially the disputed [[Durand Line]] border which is often used by members of criminal organizations and terrorists for their illegal activities. A report in 2011 suggested that up to 3 million people were involved in the illegal drug business in Afghanistan. Many of the attacks on government employees may be ordered by powerful mafia groups. Drugs from Afghanistan make its way to neighboring and others countries. The [[Ministry of Counter Narcotics (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics]] is tasked to deal with these issues by bringing to justice major drug traffickers.<ref>http://mcn.gov.af/en</ref>

Afghanistan is an impoverished and [[least developed country]], one of the world's poorest because of decades of war and lack of foreign investment. As of 2012, the nation's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] stands at about $34.29 billion with an exchange rate of $19.91 billion, and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP per capita]] is $1,100.

While the nations's current account deficit is largely financed with the donor money, only a small portion is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations. The [[Ministry of Finance (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Finance]] is focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline. For example, government revenues increased 31% to $1.7 billion from March 2010 to March 2011.

One of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over 5 million [[Afghan diaspora|expatriates]], who brought with them fresh energy, entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed funds to start up businesses.

The 2004–present suggested estimations in the above chart are supported by recent national [[opinion poll]]s, which were aimed at knowing how a group of about 804 to 7,760 local residents in Afghanistan felt about the current war, political situation, as well as the economic and social issues affecting their daily lives. Seven of the [[statistical survey|surveys]] were conducted between 2004 to 2012 by the [[The Asia Foundation|Asia Foundation]] and one between 2004 to 2009 by a combined effort of the broadcasting companies [[NBC News]], [[BBC]], and [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]].<ref name="AsiaFoundation">See:

The [[Culture of Afghanistan|Afghan culture]] has been around for over two millennia, tracing record to at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire in 500 BCE.<ref name="LoC">{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |title=Country Profile: Afghanistan |work=|publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] on Afghanistan |date = August 2008|accessdate=16 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated5>Barbara Robson, Juliene Lipson, Farid Younos, Mariam Mehdi. {{cite web |url=http://www.cal.org/co/afghan/ahist.html |title=The Afghans&nbsp;– Their History and Culture |publisher=[[Center for Applied Linguistics]]|location=United States|date=30 June 2002|accessdate=25 September 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> It is mostly a [[nomad]]ic and [[tribal society]], with different regions of the country having their own tradition, reflecting the multi-cultural and multi-lingual character of the nation.

Afghans display pride in their culture, nation, ancestry, and above all, their religion and independence. Like other highlanders, they are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their tribe loyalty and for their readiness to use force to settle disputes.<ref name="Heathcote">Heathcote, Tony (1980, 2003) "The Afghan Wars 1839–1919", Sellmount Staplehurst.</ref> As tribal warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreigners to conquer them. Tony Heathcote considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle.<ref name="Heathcote" /> There are an estimated 60 major [[Pashtun tribes]],<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/445546/Pashtun Pashtun (people)]".

[[IRIN]] Asia. 18 February 2008.</ref>

The nation has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. However, many of its historic monuments have been damaged in recent wars.<ref>G.V. Brandolini. ''Afghanistan [[cultural heritage]]''.
