The '''Bolsheviks''', originally also<ref>''[[Ushakov's Explanatory Dictionary of Russian Language]], article "Большевистский"''</ref> '''Bolshevists'''<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bolshevist Dictionaries define] the word "Bolshevist" both as a synonym to "Bolshevik" and as an adherent of Bolshevik policies.</ref> ({{lang-rus|большевики, большевик (singular)|p=bəlʲʂɨˈvʲik}}; derived from ''bol'shinstvo'', "majority", literally meaning "one of the majority") were a [[faction (political)|faction]] of the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP) which split apart from the [[Menshevik]] faction<ref>Derived from ''men'shinstvo'', "minority", which comes from ''men'she'', "less". The split occurred at the Second [[Congress of the CPSU|Party Congress]] in 1903.</ref> at the [[2nd Congress of the RSDLP|Second Party Congress]] in 1903.<ref>{{cite book |last=Suny |first=Ronald Grigor |title=The Soviet Experiment |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London |isbn=978-0-19-508105-3 |pages=57}}</ref>

The Bolsheviks were the majority faction in a crucial vote, hence their name. They ultimately became the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].<ref>After the split, the Bolshevik party was designated as RSDLP(b) (Russian: РСДРП(б)), where "b" stands for "Bolsheviks". Shortly after coming to power in November 1917 the party changed its name to the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (РКП(б)) and was generally known as the Communist Party after that point, however, it was not until 1952 that the party formally dropped the word "Bolshevik" from its name. (See [[Congress of the CPSU]] article for the timeline of name changes.)</ref> The Bolsheviks came to power in [[Russia]] during the [[October Revolution]] phase of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], and founded the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] which would later become the chief constituent of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922.

The Bolsheviks, founded by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Alexander Bogdanov]], were by 1905 a mass organization consisting primarily of workers under a democratic internal [[hierarchy]] governed by the principle of [[democratic centralism]], who considered themselves the leaders of the revolutionary [[proletariat|working class]] of Russia. Their beliefs and practices were often referred to as '''Bolshevism'''. 

Bolshevik revolutionary leader [[Leon Trotsky]] commonly used the terms "Bolshevism" and "Bolshevist" after his exile from the Soviet Union to differentiate between what he saw as true [[Leninism]] and the state and party as they existed under [[Joseph Stalin]]'s leadership.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== History of the split ==
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar |Related}}

In the [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], held in [[Brussels]] and [[London]] during August 1903, Lenin and [[Julius Martov]] disagreed over the membership rules. Lenin wanted members "who recognise the Party Programme and support it by material means<ref>Robert Service, Lenin a biography, p. 154.</ref> and by personal participation in one of the party's organisations." [[Julius Martov]] suggested "by regular personal assistance under the direction of one of the party's organisations."
Lenin advocated limiting party membership to a smaller core of active members, as opposed to "[[Card-carrying Communists|card carriers]]" who might only be active in party branches from time to time or not at all. This active base would develop the cadre, a core of "[[professional revolutionaries]]", consisting of loyal communists who would spend most of their time organising the party toward a mass revolutionary party capable of leading a [[Proletarian revolution|workers' revolution]] against the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsarist]] autocracy.

The base of active and experienced members would be the recruiting ground for this professional core. Sympathizers would be left outside and the party would be organised based on the concept of [[democratic centralism]]. Martov, until then a close friend of Lenin, agreed with him that the core of the party should consist of professional revolutionaries, but argued that party membership should be open to sympathizers, revolutionary workers and other [[fellow traveler]]s.

The two had disagreed on the issue as early as March–May 1903, but it was not until the Congress that their differences became irreconcilable and split the party.<ref>See [[Israel Getzler]]. ''Martov: A Political Biography of a Russian Social Democrat'', Cambridge University Press, 2003 (first edition 1967), ISBN 0-521-52602-7 p.78</ref> Although at first the disagreement appeared to be minor and inspired by personal conflicts, for example, Lenin's insistence on dropping less active editorial board members from ''[[Iskra]]'' or Martov's support for the Organizing Committee of the Congress which Lenin opposed, the differences quickly grew and the split became irreparable.

===Origins of the name===
The two factions were originally known as "hard" (Lenin's supporters) and "soft" (Martov's supporters). Soon, however, the terminology changed to "Bolsheviks" and "Mensheviks", from the Russian "bolshinstvo" (majority) and "menshinstvo" (minority), based on the fact that Lenin believed that most of the party stood behind him. On the other hand, Martov's supporters won the vote concerning the question of party membership. Neither Lenin nor Martov had a firm majority throughout the Congress as delegates left or switched sides. At the end, the Congress was evenly split between the two factions.

From 1907 on, English language articles sometimes used the term "Maximalist" for "Bolshevik" and "Minimalist" for "Menshevik", which proved confusing since there was also a "Maximalist" faction within the Russian [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] in 1904–1906 (which after 1906 formed a separate [[Union of Socialists-Revolutionaries Maximalists]]) and then again after 1917.<ref>See Étienne Antonelli, ''Bolshevik Russia'', A.A. Knopf, 1920, tr. by Charles A. Carroll, 307pp.: "the term "Maximalist" rather widely used as a translation for "Bolshevik" is historically false." (p.59)</ref>

=== Composition of the party ===
The average party member was very young. In 1907, 22% of Bolsheviks were under 20, 37% were 20-24 and 16% were 25-29. By 1905, 62% of the members were industrial workers (3% of the population in 1897<ref>Abraham Ascher, The Revolution of 1905, p. 4.</ref>).<ref>Tony Cliff, Lenin and the Revolutionary Party, p. 37.</ref> 22% of Bolsheviks were gentry (1.7% of the total population), 38% were uprooted peasants, compared with 19% and 26% for the [[Mensheviks]]. In 1907 78.3% of the Bolsheviks were Russian and 10% were Jewish (34 and 20% for the Mensheviks).
Total membership was 8,400 in 1905, 13,000 in 1906 and 46,100 by 1907 (8,400, 18,000, 38,200 respectively for the Mensheviks). By 1910 both factions together had fewer than 10,000 members.<ref>Richard Pipes, The Russian Revolution, pp. 364-5.</ref>

===Beginning of the 1905 Revolution (1903–1905)===
The two factions were in a state of flux in 1903–04 with many members changing sides. The founder of Russian Marxism, [[Georgy Plekhanov]], who was at first allied with [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the Bolsheviks, parted ways with them by 1904. [[Leon Trotsky]] at first supported the Mensheviks, but left them in September 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with Russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with Lenin and the Bolsheviks. He remained a self-described "non-factional social democrat" until August 1917 when he joined Lenin and the Bolsheviks as their positions assembled and he came to believe that Lenin was right on the issue of the party.

All but one member of the Central Committee were arrested in [[Moscow]] in early 1905. The remaining member, with the power of appointing a new one, was won over by the Bolsheviks.<ref>Tim McDaniel, Autocracy, capitalism, and revolution in Russia, p. 246.</ref>

The lines between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks hardened in April 1905 when the Bolsheviks held a Bolsheviks-only meeting in London, which they called the Third Party Congress. The Mensheviks organised a rival conference and the split was thus formalised.

The Bolsheviks played a relatively minor role in the [[1905 Russian Revolution|1905 Revolution]], and were a minority in the [[St. Petersburg Soviet]] of Workers' Deputies led by Trotsky. The less significant Moscow [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]], however, was dominated by the Bolsheviks. These soviets became the model for those formed in 1917.

===The Mensheviks ("The minority") (1906–1907)===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
As the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] progressed, Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and smaller non-Russian social democratic parties operating within the Russian Empire attempted to reunify at the [[4th Congress of the RSDLP|Fourth (Unification) Congress of the RSDLP]] held at [[Folkets hus]], [[Norra Bantorget]] in [[Stockholm]], April 1906. When the Mensheviks struck an alliance with the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Jewish Bund]], the Bolsheviks found themselves in a minority.

However, all factions retained their respective factional structure and the Bolsheviks formed the [[Bolshevik Centre]], the de facto governing body of the Bolshevik faction within the RSDLP. At the Fifth Congress held in London in May 1907, the Bolsheviks were in the majority, but the two factions continued functioning mostly independently of each other.

===Split between Lenin and Bogdanov (1908–1910)===
With the defeat of the revolution in mid-1907 and the adoption of a new, highly restrictive election law, the Bolsheviks began debating whether to boycott the new parliament known as the [[Third Duma]]. Lenin, [[Grigory Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]] and others argued for participating in the Duma while [[Alexander Bogdanov]], [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Mikhail Pokrovsky]] and others argued that the social democratic faction in the Duma should be recalled.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The latter became known as [[recallists]] ("otzovists" in Russian). A smaller group within the Bolshevik faction demanded that the RSDLP central committee should give its sometimes unruly Duma faction an ultimatum, demanding complete subordination to all party decisions. This group became known as "[[ultimatists]]" and was generally allied with the recallists.

With most Bolshevik leaders either supporting Bogdanov or undecided by mid-1908 when the differences became irreconcilable, Lenin concentrated on undermining Bogdanov's reputation as a philosopher. In 1909 he published a scathing book of criticism entitled ''Materialism and Empiriocriticism'' (1909),<ref>First published in Moscow in May 1909 by Zveno Publishers, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1908/mec/ available online].</ref> assaulting Bogdanov's position and accusing him of philosophical idealism.<ref>See Alan Woods. ''Bolshevism: The Road to Revolution'', Wellred Publications, 1999, ISBN 1-900007-05-3 [http://www.marxist.com/bolshevism/part3-5.html Part Three: The Period of Reaction] available online.</ref> In June 1909, Bogdanov proposed the formation of Party Schools as "Proletarian Universities" at a Bolshevik mini-conference in [[Paris]] organised by the editorial board of the Bolshevik magazine ''[[Proletary]]'' in June 1909. However this was not accepted and Lenin tried to expel him from the Bolshevik faction.<ref>English language excerpts from the resolution are quoted in ''A Documentary History of Communism in Russia'', ed. Robert V. Daniels, UPNE, 1993, ISBN 0-87451-616-1 p. 33.</ref> Bogdanov was then involved with setting up [[Vpered]], which ran the Capri Party School from August to December 1909.<ref>{{cite journal

===Final attempt at party unity (1910)===
With both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks weakened by splits within their ranks and by [[Tsar]]ist repression, they were tempted to try to re-unite the party. In January 1910, Leninists, recallists and various Menshevik factions held a meeting of the party's Central Committee in Paris. Kamenev and Zinoviev were dubious about the idea, but were willing to give it a try under pressure from "conciliator" Bolsheviks like [[Victor Nogin]].

Lenin was firmly opposed to any re-unification, but was outvoted within the Bolshevik leadership. The meeting reached a tentative agreement and one of its provisions made Trotsky's [[Vienna]]-based ''[[Pravda]]'' a party-financed 'central organ'. Kamenev, Trotsky's brother-in-law, was added to the editorial board from the Bolsheviks, but the unification attempts failed in August 1910 when Kamenev resigned from the board amid mutual recriminations.

===Forming a separate party (1912)===
The factions permanently broke off relations in January 1912 after the Bolsheviks organised a Bolsheviks-only [[Prague Party Conference]] and formally expelled Mensheviks and recallists from the party. As a result, they ceased to be a faction in the RSDLP and instead declared themselves an independent party, called '''Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks)''' - or RSDLP(b). Unofficially the Party has been referred to as the "Bolshevik Party". Throughout the century, the Party adopted a number of different names. In 1918, RSDLP(b) became '''(All-)Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks)''' and remained so until 1925. From 1925-52 the name was '''All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)''', and from 1952-91 '''[[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]'''.

Although the Bolshevik leadership decided to form a separate party, convincing pro-Bolshevik workers within Russia to follow suit proved difficult. When the first meeting of the Fourth Duma was convened in late 1912, only one out of six Bolshevik deputies, [[Matvei Muranov]], (another one, Roman Malinovsky, was later exposed as an [[Okhrana]] [Tsarist secret police] agent) voted to break away from the [[Menshevik]] faction within the Duma on 15 December 1912.<ref>Robert B. McKean, ''St. Petersburg Between the Revolutions: workers and revolutionaries, June 1907-February 1917'', New Haven, [[Yale University Press]], 1990, pp. 140-1.</ref> The Bolshevik leadership eventually prevailed and the Bolsheviks formed their own Duma faction in September 1913.

=="Bolshevik" as an obsolete term==
In 1952, at the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]], Stalin declared: "There are no more Mensheviks. Why should we call ourselves Bolsheviks? We are not the majority, but the whole party."{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} According to his suggestion, the Bolshevik party was renamed the Communist Party of Soviet Union. Since that time, the term Bolshevik has been regarded as obsolete, and relevant only to the pre-Revolutionary times, during the Russian Revolution itself and the Russian Civil War which followed.

==Derogatory usage of "Bolshevik"==
"Bolo" was used as derogatory expression for Bolsheviks used by [[British Empire|British]] service personnel in the [[North Russian Expeditionary Force]] which intervened against the [[Red Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].<ref>[http://www.naval-history.net/WW1z05NorthRussia.htm North Russian Expeditionary Force 1919, Scrapbook Diary, Photographs, Mementoes] accessed 14 June 2012</ref> [[Adolf Hitler]], Joseph Goebbels and other Nazi leaders used it in reference to the worldwide political movement coordinated by the [[Comintern]].<ref>(''Collins Mini Dictionary'', 1998)</ref>  During the days of the [[Cold War]] in the [[United Kingdom]], labour union leaders and other leftists were sometimes derisively described as "Bolshies". The usage is roughly equivalent to the term "[[Commie]]", "[[Communist|Red]]" or "[[pinko]]" in the [[United States]] during the same period.  The term "Bolshie" later became a slang term for anyone who was rebellious, aggressive or truculent.<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bolshie bolshie, online dictionary]</ref>
