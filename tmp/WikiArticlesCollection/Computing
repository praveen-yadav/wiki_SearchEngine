'''Computing''' is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating [[computer]]s. For example, computing includes designing, developing and building hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; and creating and using communications and entertainment media. Sub-disciplines of computing include [[computer engineering]], [[software engineering]], [[computer science]], [[information systems]], and [[information technology]].

==Definitions==

The  [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] ''Computing Curricula 2005''<ref name=curricula>The Joint Task Force for Computing Curricula 2005. [http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report (pdf)]</ref> defined "computing" as follows:

<blockquote>"In a general way, we can define computing to mean any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating computers. Thus, computing includes designing and building hardware and software systems for a wide range of purposes; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific studies using computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; creating and using communications and entertainment media; finding and gathering information relevant to any particular purpose, and so on. The list is virtually endless, and the possibilities are vast."</blockquote>

and it defines five sub-disciplines of the ''computing'' field: [[Computer Science]], [[Computer Engineering]], [[Information Systems]], [[Information Technology]], and [[Software Engineering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations |title=Curricula Recommendations |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |year=2005 |accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref>

However, ''Computing Curricula 2005''<ref name=curricula/> also recognizes that the meaning of "computing" depends on the context:

<blockquote>''Computing also has other meanings that are more specific, based on the context in which the term is used. For example, an information systems specialist will view computing somewhat differently from a software engineer. Regardless of the context, doing computing well can be complicated and difficult. Because society needs people to do computing well, we must think of computing not only as a profession but also as a discipline.''</blockquote>

The term "computing" has sometimes been narrowly defined, as in a 1989 [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] report on ''Computing as a Discipline'':<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://cs.gmu.edu/cne/pjd/GP/CompDisc.pdf |title=Computing as a Discipline |format=PDF |date=January 1999 |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |work=[[Communications of the ACM]] |author=Peter J. Denning, et al. |accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref>

<blockquote>''The discipline of computing is the systematic study of algorithmic
processes that describe and transform information: their theory, analysis, design, efficiency, implementation, and application. The fundamental question underlying all computing is "What can be (efficiently) automated?"</blockquote>

The term "computing" is also synonymous with counting and calculating. In earlier times, it was used in reference to mechanical computing machines.

== History of computing ==
{{Main|History of computing|Timeline of computing}}

The history of computing is longer than the [[history of computing hardware]] and [[computer|modern computing technology]] and includes the history of methods intended for pen and paper or for chalk and slate, with or without the aid of tables.

Computing is intimately tied to the representation of [[number]]s. But long before [[abstraction]]s like ''the number'' arose, there were mathematical concepts to serve the purposes of civilization. These concepts include [[one-to-one correspondence]] (the basis of counting), comparison to a standard (used for measurement), and the ''3-4-5'' right triangle (a device for assuring a ''right angle'').

The earliest known tool for use in computation was the [[abacus]], and it was thought to have been invented in [[Babylon]] circa [[2400 BC]]. Its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles. Abaci, of a more modern design, are still used as calculation tools today. This was the first known computer and most advanced system of calculation known to date - preceding Greek methods by 2,000 years.

== Computer ==
{{Main|Computer|Outline of computers|Glossary of computer terms}}

A computer is a [[machine]] that manipulates [[Data (computing)|data]] according to a set of [[Source code|instructions]] called a [[computer program]].  The program has an [[Execution (computing)|executable]] form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions.  The same program in its human-readable [[source code]] form, enables a [[programmer]] to study and develop the [[Algorithm#Formalization|algorithm]]. Because the instructions can be carried out in different types of computers, a single set of source instructions converts to machine instructions according to the [[central processing unit]] type.

The execution [[process (computing)|process]] carries out the instructions in a computer program. Instructions express the [[computation]]s performed by the computer. They trigger sequences of simple actions on the executing machine. Those actions produce effects according to the [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]] of the instructions.

=== Computer software and hardware ===
{{Main|Software|Computer hardware}}

Computer software or just "software", is a collection of [[computer program]]s and related [[data]] that provides the instructions for telling a [[computer]] what to do and how to do it. Software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer for some purposes. In other words, software is a set of ''programs, procedures, algorithms'' and its ''documentation'' concerned with the operation of a data processing system. Program software performs the [[Function (engineering)|function]] of the [[Computer program|program]] it implements, either by directly providing [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] to the computer hardware or by serving as input to another piece of software. The [[Terminology|term]] was coined to contrast with the old term [[computer hardware|hardware]] (meaning physical devices). In contrast to hardware, software "cannot be touched".<ref>{{cite web
| title = Wordreference.com: WordNet 2.0
| publisher = Princeton University, Princeton, NJ
| url = http://www.wordreference.com/definition/software
| accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}</ref> Software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense, meaning [[application software]] only.

==== Application software ====
{{Main|Application software}}

Application software, also known as an "application" or an "app",<!-- for redirect from [[Software application]]--> is [[computer software]] designed to help the user to perform specific tasks. Examples include [[enterprise software]], [[accounting software]], [[office suite]]s, [[graphics software]] and [[media player (application software)|media player]]s.  Many application programs deal principally with [[Document file format|documents]].  Apps may be [[Product bundling|bundled]] with the computer and its system software, or may be published separately.  Some users are satisfied with the bundled apps and need never install one.

Application software is contrasted with [[system software]] and [[middleware]], which manage and integrate a computer's capabilities, but typically do not directly apply them in the performance of tasks that benefit the user.  The system software serves the application, which in turn serves the user.<ref>Similar relationships apply in other fields. For example, a shopping mall does not provide the merchandise a shopper is seeking, but provides space and services for retailers that serve the shopper. A bridge may similarly support rail tracks, which support trains, allowing the trains to transport passengers.</ref>

Application software applies the power of a particular [[computing platform]] or system software to a particular purpose.  Some apps such as [[Microsoft Office]] are available in versions for several different platforms; others have narrower requirements and are thus called, for example, a [[Geographic information system|Geography]] application for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] or an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] application for [[Educational software|education]] or [[Linux gaming]].  Sometimes a new and popular application arises that only runs on one platform, increasing the desirability of that platform.  This is called a [[killer application]].

====System software====
{{Main|System software}}

System software, or systems software, is computer software designed to operate and control the computer hardware and to provide a platform for running application software.  System software includes [[operating system]]s, [[utility software]],  [[device driver]]s, [[window system]]s, and [[firmware]].  Frequently development tools such as [[compiler]]s, [[linker (computing)|linker]]s, and [[debugger]]s are classified as system software.

=== Computer network ===
{{Main|Computer network}}

A computer network, often simply referred to as a network, is a collection of hardware components and computers interconnected by communication channels that allow sharing of resources and information.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.atis.org/glossary/definition.aspx?id=6555 |title=Computer network definition |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> Where at least one process in one device is able to send/receive data to/from at least one process residing in a remote device, then the two devices are said to be in a network.

Networks may be classified according to a wide variety of characteristics such as the medium used to transport the data, [[communications protocol]] used, scale, [[Network topology|topology]], and organizational scope.

[[Communications protocol]]s define the rules and data formats for exchanging information in a computer network, and provide the basis for [[computer network programming|network programming]]. Well-known communications protocols are [[Ethernet]], a hardware and [[Link Layer]] standard that is ubiquitous in [[local area network]]s, and the [[Internet Protocol Suite]], which defines a set of protocols for internetworking, i.e. for data communication between multiple networks, as well as host-to-host data transfer, and application-specific data transmission formats.

Computer networking is sometimes considered a sub-discipline of [[electrical engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[computer science]], [[information technology]] or [[computer engineering]], since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of these disciplines.

==== Internet ====
{{Main|Internet|Outline of the Internet|Glossary of Internet-related terms}}

The Internet is a global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s that use the standard [[Internet protocol suite]] (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a ''network of networks'' that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of [[information]] resources and services, such as the inter-linked [[hypertext]] documents of the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW) and the [[information infrastructure|infrastructure]] to support [[email]].

=== Computer user ===
{{Main|User (computing)}}

A user is an agent, either a human agent (end-user) or software agent, who uses a computer or network service. A user often has a user account and is identified by a username (also user name), screen name (also screenname), nickname (also nick), or handle, which derives from the identical Citizen's Band radio term.

In hacker-related terminology, users are divided into "lusers" and "power users"{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}.

In projects where the system actor is another system or a software agent, there may be no end-user. In that case, the end-users for the system is indirect end-users.

====End-user====
{{Main|End-user}}

The term end-user refers to the ultimate operator of a piece of software, but it is also a concept in [[software engineering]], referring to an [[abstraction]] of that group of [[end-user]]s of computers (i.e. the expected user or target-user). The term is used to distinguish those who only [[operator (profession)|operate]] the software from the developer of the system, who knows a [[programming language]] and uses it to create new functions for end-users.

=== Computer programming ===
{{Main|Computer programming|Software engineering}}

Computer programming in general is the process of writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the [[source code]] and documentation of [[computer program]]s. This source code is written in a [[programming language]], which is an [[artificial language]] often more restrictive or demanding than [[natural language]]s, but easily translated by the computer. The purpose of programming is to invoke the desired behavior (customization) from the machine. The process of writing high quality source code requires knowledge of both the application's domain  ''and'' the computer science domain.  The highest-quality software is thus developed by a team of various domain experts, each person a specialist in some area of development.  But the term ''programmer'' may apply to a range of program quality, from [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] to [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|open source contributor]] to professional. And a single programmer could do most or all of the computer programming needed to generate the [[proof of concept]] to launch a new [[Killer application|"killer" application]].

==== Computer programmer ====
{{Main|Programmer|Software engineer|Software developer}}

A programmer, computer programmer, or coder is a person who writes [[computer software]]. The term ''computer programmer'' can refer to a specialist in one area of [[computer programming]] or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software. One who practices or professes a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst. A programmer's primary computer language ([[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Python programming language|Python]], [[Smalltalk]], etc.) is often prefixed to the above titles, and those who work in a web environment often prefix their titles with ''web''. The term ''programmer'' can be used to refer to a [[software developer]], [[software engineer]], [[computer scientist]], or [[software analyst]]. However, members of these [[profession]]s typically{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} possess other [[software engineering]] skills, beyond programming; for this reason, the term ''programmer'' is sometimes considered an insulting or derogatory oversimplification of these other professions{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. This has sparked much debate amongst developers, analysts, computer scientists, programmers, and outsiders who continue to be puzzled at the subtle differences in the definitions of these occupations.<ref>{{cite news|title=No Programmers |url=http://www.ericsink.com/No_Programmers.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Developer versus programmer |url=http://codebetter.com/blogs/raymond.lewallen/archive/2005/02/22/55812.aspx}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Developers AND Programmers |url=http://weblogs.asp.net/miked/archive/2006/10/13/_2200_Developers_2200_-and-_2200_Programmers_2200_.aspx}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Programmer vs. Developer vs. Software Engineer |url=http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.112837.37}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Programmer vs. Developer vs. Software Engineer |url=http://www.xtremevbtalk.com/archive/index.php/t-233780.html}}</ref>

=== Computer industry ===
{{Main|Computer industry}}

The computer industry is made up of all of the businesses involved in developing [[computer software]], designing [[computer hardware]] and [[computer networking]] infrastructures, the manufacture of [[computer]] components and the provision of [[information technology]] services including [[System administrator|system administration]] and maintenance.

==== Software industry ====
{{Main|Software industry}}

The software industry includes businesses engaged in [[software development|development]], [[software maintenance|maintenance]] and [[software publisher|publication]] of [[software]]. The industry also includes software [[Service (economics)|service]]s, such as [[training]], [[software documentation|documentation]], and [[consultancy|consulting]].

=== Computer science ===
{{Main|Computer science|Computer scientist}}

Computer science or computing science (abbreviated CS or Comp Sci) is the [[science|scientific]] and practical approach to [[computation]] and its aomputer scientist]] specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=computer%20scientist |title=WordNet Search - 3.1 |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref>

Its subfields can be divided into  practical techniques for its implementation and application in [[computer system]]s and purely theoretical areas. Some, such as [[computational complexity theory]], which studies fundamental properties of [[computational problem]]s, are highly abstract, while others, such as [[Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]], emphasize real-world applications. Still others focus on the challenges in implementing computations. For example, [[programming language theory]] studies approaches to description of computations, while the study of [[computer programming]] itself investigates various aspects of the use of [[programming language]]s and [[complex systems]], and [[human-computer interaction]] focuses on the challenges in making computers and computations useful, usable, and universally accessible to [[human]]s.
