'''Ahmed Ibrahim al-Haznawi''' ({{lang-ar|احمد ابراهيم الحزناوي}}, {{transl|ar|''Aḥmad Ibrāhīm al-Ḥaznāwī''}}) (October 11, 1980 &ndash; September 11, 2001) was one of four [[Organizers of the September 11 attacks|hijackers]] of [[United Airlines Flight 93]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]]. 

A [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]], Haznawi had trained in [[Afghanistan]] after leaving his family to fight in [[Chechnya]] in 2000. He arrived in the [[United States]] in June 2001 under the direction of [[Al-Qaeda]] for terrorist attacks, on a tourist visa. Once he was in the U.S., he settled in [[Florida]] and helped plan out how the attacks would take place.

On September 11, 2001, Haznawi boarded [[United Airlines Flight 93]] and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which crashed into a field in [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]], after a passenger uprising.

==Early life==
Ahmed al-Haznawi was the son of a Saudi [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|imam]] from the [[Al-Bahah]] province,  a province in the south west of Saudi Arabia. It is the capital of Al Bahah Province nestled between the resorts of Mecca and Abha, Al Bahah is one of the Kingdom’s prime tourist attractions. Haznawi grew up in the village of Hazna, where his father was a cleric at the mosque in the central marketplace section of the village.  Haznawi belonged to a family that was part of the larger, al-Ghamdi tribe, sharing the same tribal affiliation with fellow hijackers [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]], and [[Ahmed al-Ghamdi]].<ref name="bg-20020303">{{cite news |title=Driving a Wedge - Bin Laden, the US and Saudi Arabia (Part 1) |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=2002-03-03}}</ref> He memorised the [[Quran]], giving him the title [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|Hafiz]].<ref name="martyr">Bell, Stewart. "The Martyr's Oath", 2005.</ref>

This group is noted as being some of the more religiously observant of the hijackers, and they are thought to have met each other some time in 1999. 

==History==
===1999&ndash;2000===
Haznawi announced he was leaving his family in 1999 to help fight in [[Chechnya]], although his father forbade him.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,685102,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Chilling, defiant: the video suicide message of a September 11 killer | first=Julian | last=Borger | date=April 16, 2002 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref> His father and brother, Abdul Rahman al-Haznawi, reportedly last heard from him in late 2000, after he made references to training in [[Afghanistan]].

On November 12, 2000, Haznawi applied for and received a two-year US [[B-1/B-2 Visa|B-1/B-2
(tourist/business) visa]] in [[Jeddah, Saudi Arabia]].<ref name="visa">{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Monograph.pdf |title=Staff Monograph on 9/11 and Terrorist Travel |publisher=9/11 Commission |year=2004|format=PDF}}</ref>

From November 27, 2000 through December 27, 2000, Haznawi was in [[Saudi Arabia]] for [[Ramadan]].  It is theorized that during this trip, he may have initially told [[Saeed al-Ghamdi|Saeed]] and [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]] about the operation.

Some time late in 2000, Haznawi traveled to the [[United Arab Emirates]], where he purchased [[traveler's cheque]]s presumed to have been paid for by [[Mustafa al-Hawsawi]].  Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including [[Majed Moqed]], [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]], [[Wail al-Shehri]] and [[Ahmed al-Nami]].

===2001===
He was one of four hijackers  believed to be staying at a [[Kandahar]] [[guest house (lodging)|guest house]] in March 2001, where they were seen by [[Mohammed Jabarah]]. Jabarah remembered [[File:Alhaznawi video aljazeera.jpg|thumb|left|Haznawi appeared in an [[al-Qaeda]] video, pledging to give his life to [[martyr]]dom.]] Haznawi specifically, saying that he was "very devout and could recite the entire Koran from memory".<ref name="seeds">Ressa, Maria. "Seeds of Terror", 2003. p. 165</ref>

On June 8 he arrived in [[Miami, Florida]] with fellow hijacker [[Wail al-Shehri]].  He was one of 9 hijackers to open a [[SunTrust]] bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001.  He is believed to have moved in with [[Ziad Jarrah]], who got a new apartment on Bougainvilla Dr. in [[Lauderdale-by-the-Sea]], after both men gave the landlord photocopies of their German passports, which he later turned over to the FBI.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20011019090410/www.miami.com/herald/special/news/worldtrade/digdocs/046328.htm |title=Miami Herald: Hijack plotters used S. Florida as a cradle for conspiracy |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2001-10-19 |accessdate=2012-01-06}}</ref>

On June 25, Jarrah took Haznawi to [[Holy Cross Hospital (Fort Lauderdale)|Holy Cross Hospital]] in [[Fort Lauderdale]] on advice of his landlord Charles Lisa.  Haznawi was treated by Dr. Christos Tsonas, who gave him antibiotics for a small gash on his left calf.  While he told staff that he had bumped into a suitcase,<ref>[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/memoroilsanthraxprobe.html Memo on Florida Case Roils Anthrax Probe] Washington Post, March 29, 2002</ref> the media briefly reported it as a sign of [[anthrax|cutaneous anthrax]] and a possible link to the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], although FBI later addressed the rumors stating that "Exhaustive testing did not support that anthrax was present anywhere the hijackers had been."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/03/23/anthrax/?related | work=CNN | title=Report raises question of anthrax, hijacker link | date=March 23, 2002 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref>

On July 10 Haznawi obtained a Florida driver's license, later obtaining another copy on September 7, 2001 by filling out a change-of-address form. Five other suspected hijackers also received duplicate Florida licenses in 2001, and others had licenses from different states. Some have speculated that this was to allow multiple persons to use the same identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040604015841/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sfl-worldtrade-suspectprofiles.story |title=Multiple identities of hijack suspects confound FBI: South Florida Sun-Sentinel |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2004-06-04 |accessdate=2012-01-06}}</ref>

Jarrah and Haznawi both received their one-way tickets for United Airlines Flight 93, on September 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_hr/092602mueller.html |title=Statement of Robert S. Mueller: Joint Investigation Into September 11: (published September 26, 2002) |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}</ref> On September 7, all four Flight 93 hijackers flew from [[Fort Lauderdale]] to [[Newark International Airport]] aboard [[Spirit Airlines]].

==Attacks==
{{Main|United Airlines Flight 93}}
On September 11, 2001, Haznawi arrived at [[Newark International Airport]] to board Flight 93.  Although he was selected for additional security by [[Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System|CAPPS]] and screened, he was able to board the flight without incident, with only his checked bags requiring extra screening for explosives.<ref name="staff">{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_3.pdf |title=The Aviation Security System and the 9/11 Attacks - Staff Statement No. 3 |publisher=9/11 Commission|format=PDF}}</ref>  

Due to the flight's delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings that day and were told to be on the alert.  Within minutes, Flight 93 was hijacked as well.

At least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas, which some believe may have signified an allegiance to the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]].  The calls also indicated that one of the men had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside - it is not known which hijacker this was.  Some passengers expressed doubt that the bomb was real.

[[Passengers]] on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes. A passenger uprising soon took place. Hijacker-pilot, [[Ziad Jarrah]], crashed the plane into an empty field near Shanksville, [[Pennsylvania]] in order to prevent the passengers from gaining control of the plane. The crash killed everyone on board.

==Aftermath==
After the attacks, before the release of the FBI pictures of the hijackers, [[Arab News]] reported that Haznawi's brother Abdul Rahman had told al-Madinah newspaper that a photograph published by local newspapers bore no resemblance to his brother.<ref>[http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&section=0&article=9490&d=1&m=10&y=2001 Hanjour family denies Hani’s involvement in crime] Arab News, October 1, 2001</ref>

A videotape released with The Wills of the New York and Washington Battle Martyrs, was aired on [[Al Jazeera]] on April 16, 2002. While the name beneath the speaker read ''al-Ghamdi'', the image is of Haznawi speaking.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Officials suggested that the name was merely a reference to his tribal affiliation.  The film was thought to have been made in March 2001.  In it, he talked about his plans to bring the "bloodied message" to America.  In September 2002, a similar tape made by [[Abdulaziz al-Omari]] appeared.

He has been portrayed by actors [[Omar Berdouni]] in [[United 93 (film)|United 93]], and Zak Santiago in [[Flight 93 (TV film)|Flight 93]].
