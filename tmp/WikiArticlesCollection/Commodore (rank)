'''Commodore''' is a [[military rank]] used in many [[navy|navies]] that is superior to a navy [[Captain (Navy)|captain]], but below a [[rear admiral]]. Non-English-speaking nations often use the rank of [[flotilla admiral]] or [[counter admiral]] as an equivalent, although the latter may also correspond to rear admiral. 

Traditionally, "commodore" is the title for any officer assigned to command more than one ship at a time, even temporarily, much as "captain" is the traditional title for the commanding officer of a single ship even if the officer's official title in the service is a lower rank. As an official rank, a commodore typically commands a [[flotilla]] or [[squadron (naval)|squadron]] of ships as part of a larger [[task force]] or [[naval fleet]] commanded by an [[admiral]].

It is often regarded as a [[one-star rank]] with a [[NATO]] code of [[OF-6]] (which is known in the U.S. as "[[rear admiral]] (lower half)"), but whether it is regarded as a [[flag rank]] varies between countries.<ref>Whether "commodore" is a [[flag rank]] (or not) varies by country. Often, "rear admiral" is the first of the "flag ranks". For example, it was not until 2001 that the UK made "commodore" a "flag rank", and changed the shoulder rank insignia (although not the cuff rings) of the higher ranking admirals accordingly. Australia made this change in the mid-1990s, and also changed the commodore rank insignia to include a star.</ref> 

It is sometimes abbreviated as ''Cdre'', ''CDRE'' or ''COMO''.<ref>The "Cdre" abbreviation for the OF-6 rank of commodore is sometimes confused with the "Cmdr" abbreviation for the OF-4 rank of "[[commander]]".</ref>

==Etymology==
The rank of commodore derives from the [[French language|French]] ''commandeur'', which was one of the highest ranks in orders of [[knight]]hood, and in military orders the title of the knight in charge of a ''commenda'' (a local part of the order's territorial possessions).

==History==
The [[Dutch Navy]] also used the rank of ''[[commandeur]]'' from the end of the 16th century for a variety of temporary positions, until it became a conventional permanent rank in 1955. The [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] has adopted the English spelling of ''commodore'' for an equivalent rank.

The rank of commodore was at first a position created as a temporary title to be bestowed upon captains who commanded [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]] of more than one vessel. In many navies, the rank of commodore was merely viewed as a [[senior captain]] position, whereas other naval services bestowed upon the rank of commodore the prestige of [[flag officer]] status; commodore is the highest rank in the [[Irish Naval Service]], for example, and is held by only one person. In the [[Royal Navy]], the position was introduced to combat the cost of appointing more admirals—a costly business with a fleet as large as the Royal Navy's at that time.

=== United States ===
{{main|Commodore (United States)}}
In 1899 the substantive rank of commodore was discontinued in the [[United States Navy]], but revived during World War II. It was discontinued as a rank in these services during the postwar period, but as an appointment, the title "commodore" was then used to identify senior U.S. Navy [[captain (U.S. Navy)|captain]]s who commanded squadrons of more than one vessel or functional air wings or air groups that were not part of a carrier air wing or air group. Concurrently, until the early 1980s, [[U.S. Navy]] and [[U.S. Coast Guard]] captains selected for promotion to the rank of [[rear admiral]] (lower half), would wear the same insignia as rear admiral (upper half), i.e., two silver stars for collar insignia or sleeve braid of one wide and one narrow gold stripe, even though they were actually only equivalent to one-star officers and paid at the one-star rate. 

To correct this inequity, the rank of commodore as a single star flag officer was reinstated by both services in the early 1980s. This immediately caused confusion with those senior U.S. Navy captains commanding destroyer squadrons, submarine squadrons, functional air wings and air groups, and so on, who held the temporary "title" of commodore while in their major command billet. As a result of this confusion, the services soon renamed the new one-star rank as [[commodore admiral]] (CADM) within the first six months following the rank's reintroduction. However, this was considered an awkward title and the one-star flag rank was renamed a few months later to its current title of rear admiral (lower half), later abbreviated by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard as RDML. 

The "title" of commodore continues to be used in the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard for those senior captains in command of organizations consisting of groups of ships or submarines organized into [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]]; air wings or air groups of multiple [[Squadron (aviation)|aviation squadrons]] other than carrier air wings (the latter whose commanders still use the title "CAG"); explosive ordnance disposal ([[Explosive Ordnance Disposal|EOD]]), mine warfare and special warfare ([[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL]]) groups; and construction battalion ([[SeaBee]]) regiments. Although not flag officers, modern day commodores in the U.S. Navy rate a blue and white command pennant that is normally flown at their headquarters facilities ashore or from ships that they are embarked aboard when they are the senior officer afloat.

===Argentina===
In the Argentine Navy,  the rank of commodore was created in the late 1990s, and is usually, but not always, issued to senior captains holding rear-admirals' positions. Its equivalent in the army is colonel-major, and has no equivalent in the air force. It is usually—but incorrectly—referred to as "navy commodore", to avoid confusion with the "air force commodore", which is equivalent to the navy's captain and army's colonel. The sleeve lace is identical to that of the Royal Navy, and wears one star on the shoulder strap.

==Air force ranks==
Commodore, in Spanish ''comodoro'', is a rank in the [[Argentine Air Force]]. This rank is the equivalent of a [[colonel]] in the [[Argentine Army]], and a colonel or [[group captain]] in other air forces of the world. The Argentine rank below commodore is the rank of vice-commodore (Spanish ''vicecomodoro'') equivalent to a [[lieutenant-colonel]] in the Argentine Army, and a lieutenant-colonel or [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] in other air forces.

Commodore is a rank in the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]]. It is a [[one-star rank]] and has essentially the same rank insignia as the British [[air commodore]].

Many air forces, use the rank of [[air commodore]]. This rank was first used by the [[Royal Air Force]] and is now used in many countries such as Australia, Bangladesh, Greece, India, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Thailand and Zimbabwe. It is the equivalent rank to the navy rank of "commodore", and the army ranks of [[brigadier]] and [[brigadier general]].

The German air force used the concept of a unit commodore, although this was a unit command appointment rather than a rank.

==Merchant and boating rank==
<!-- An internal link from [[RMS Titanic]] is targeted to this section. Please change the link on that pageif you change the section name here! Thanks. -->
Commodore is also a title held by the senior captain within a shipping company and by the senior officer of many yacht clubs and boating associations.

==Convoy commodore==

During wartime, a shipping [[convoy]] will have a ranking officer—sometimes an active-duty naval [[commissioned officer|officer]], at other times a [[civilian]] [[Master Mariner|master]] or retired naval officer—designated as the ''convoy commodore''. This title is not related to the individual{{'}}s military rank (if any), but instead is the title of the senior individual responsible for the overall operation of the [[merchant ship]]s and naval [[auxiliary ship]]s that make up the convoy. The convoy commodore does not command the convoy{{'}} escort forces (if any), which are commanded by a naval officer who serves as escort commander.

==Other uses==

In the [[United States Coast Guard Auxiliary]], the senior elected officer of the organization is the National Commodore, also there are commodores elected for the individual district commands of the Coast Guard Auxiliary. They hold the title of District Commodore. There are also appointed commodores who are the senior office holder for the areas within the organizational directorate.  

In the [[Philippine Coast Guard Auxiliary]]—PCGA—each of the directors in command of the ten Coast Guard Auxiliary districts are commodores, as well as most of the Deputy National Directors (some may be rear admirals). Commodore is appreviated to COMMO in the PCGA.

[[Vanderbilt University]]'s intercollegiate athletics teams are nicknamed the "[[Vanderbilt Commodores|Commodores]]", a reference to [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]'s self-appointed title (he was the master of a large shipping fleet).

In the U.S. [[Sea Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Sea Scouting]] program (which is part of the [[Boy Scouts of America]]), all National, Regional, Area, and Council committee chairs are titled as commodore, while senior committee members are addressed as vice commodore. Ship committee chairs do not hold this recognition.
