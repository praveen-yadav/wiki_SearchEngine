'''Concrete''' is a [[composite material|composite]] material composed of coarse granular material (the [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] or filler) embedded in a hard matrix of material (the [[cement]] or binder) that fills the space among the aggregate particles and glues them together.<ref>Zongjin Li; ''Advanced concrete technology''; 2011</ref>

Concrete is widely used for making [[architectural structure]]s, [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]], brick/[[Concrete masonry unit|block]] walls, [[Sidewalk|pavements]], bridges/[[overpass]]es, highways, runways, [[parking]] structures, [[dam]]s, pools/[[reservoirs]], pipes, [[foundation (engineering)|footings]] for gates, [[fence]]s and [[Utility pole|poles]] and even [[boat]]s.

Famous concrete structures include the [[Hoover Dam]], the [[Panama Canal]] and the Roman [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]].

Concrete technology was known by the [[ancient Romans]] and was widely used in the [[Roman Empire]]&mdash;the [[Colosseum]] was built largely of concrete and the concrete dome of the Pantheon is the world's largest. After the Empire was destroyed, use of concrete became scarce until the technology was re-pioneered in the mid-18th century.

== History ==
The word concrete comes from the Latin word "''concretus''" (meaning compact or condensed),<ref>{{cite web|title=concretus|url=http://latinlookup.com/word/12124/concretus|publisher=Latin Lookup |accessdate=October 1, 2012 }}</ref> the perfect passive participle of "''concrescere''", from "''con''-" (together) and "''crescere''" (to grow).

Perhaps the earliest known occurrence of cement was twelve million years ago, when a natural deposit formed after an occurrence of naturally combusting oil shale  adjacent to a bed of limestone. These ancient deposits were investigated in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=MAST>{{cite web|title=The History of Concrete|url=http://matse1.matse.illinois.edu/concrete/hist.html|publisher=Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref> 

On a human time-scale, lime mortars were used in Greece, Crete, and Cyprus in 800 BC.  The [[Assyria]]n Jerwan Aqueduct (688 BC) made use of fully waterproof concrete.<ref>Jacobsen T and Lloyd S, (1935) ''Sennacherib's Aqueduct at Jerwan,'' Oriental Institute Publications 24, Chicago University Press</ref> German archaeologist [[Heinrich Schliemann]] found concrete floors, which were made of lime and pebbles, in the royal palace of [[Tiryns]], Greece, which dates roughly to 1400-1200 BC.<ref>  Heinrich Schliemann with Wilhelm Dörpfeld and Felix Adler, ''Tiryns: The Prehistoric Palace of the Kings of Tiryns, The Results of the Latest Excavations'', (New York, New York:  Charles Scribner's Sons, 1885),  [http://books.google.com/books?id=pw4BAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA203#v=onepage&q&f=false pages 203-204], 215, and 190.</ref><ref>Amelia Carolina Sparavigna, [http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1110/1110.5230.pdf "Ancient concrete works"]</ref>  Concrete was used for construction in many ancient structures.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Ancient Concrete Structures|author=Stella L.

The Romans used concrete extensively from 300 BC to 476 AD, a span of more than seven hundred years.<ref name=MAST></ref>  During the [[Roman Empire]], [[Roman concrete]] (or ''[[opus caementicium]]'') was made from [[quicklime]], [[pozzolana]] and an aggregate of [[pumice]]. Its widespread use in many [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman structures]], a key event in the [[history of architecture]] termed the [[Roman Architectural Revolution]], freed [[Roman engineering|Roman construction]] from the restrictions of stone and brick material and allowed for revolutionary new designs in terms of both structural complexity and dimension.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Lancaster| first = Lynne| title = Concrete Vaulted Construction in Imperial Rome.

<blockquote>Concrete, as the Romans knew it, was a new and revolutionary material. Laid in the shape of [[arch]]es, [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] and [[List of Roman domes|domes]], it quickly hardened into a rigid mass, free from many of the internal thrusts and strains that troubled the builders of similar structures in stone or brick.<ref>D.S. Robertson: ''Greek and Roman Architecture'', Cambridge, 1969, p. 233</ref></blockquote>

Modern tests show that ''opus caementicium'' had as much compressive strength as modern Portland-cement concrete (ca. 200&nbsp;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>).<ref>Henry Cowan: The Masterbuilders, New York 1977, p. 56, ISBN 978-0-471-02740-9</ref> However, due to the absence of reinforcement, its tensile strength was far lower than modern [[reinforced concrete]], and its mode of application was also different:<ref>[http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1101/notes/concrete/section_2_history.html History of Concrete]. Ce.memphis.edu. Retrieved on 2013-02-19.</ref>

<blockquote>Modern structural concrete differs from Roman concrete in two important details. First, its mix consistency is fluid and homogeneous, allowing it to be poured into forms rather than requiring hand-layering together with the placement of aggregate, which, in Roman practice, often consisted of [[rubble]]. Second, integral reinforcing steel gives modern concrete assemblies great strength in tension, whereas Roman concrete could depend only upon the strength of the concrete bonding to resist tension.<ref>Robert Mark, Paul Hutchinson: "On the Structure of the Roman Pantheon", ''Art Bulletin'', Vol. 68, No. 1 (1986), p. 26, fn. 5</ref></blockquote>

The widespread use of concrete in many Roman structures ensured that many survive to the present day. The [[Baths of Caracalla]] in Rome are just one example. Many [[Roman aqueduct]]s and bridges have masonry cladding on a concrete core, as does the dome of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]].

After the Roman Empire, the use of burned lime and pozzolana was greatly reduced until the technique was all but forgotten between 500 AD and the 1300s. Between the 1300s until the mid-1700s, the use of cement gradually returned. The ''[[Canal du Midi]]'' was built using concrete in 1670,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20100505160054/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/2/0/1/2/p20122_index.html The Politics of Rediscovery in the History of Science: Tacit Knowledge of Concrete before its Discovery]. allacademic.com</ref> and there are concrete structures in Finland that date from the 16th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Perhaps the greatest driver behind the modern usage of concrete was the third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] in Devon, England. To create this structure, between 1756 and 1793, British engineer [[John Smeaton]] pioneered the use of [[hydraulic lime]] in concrete, using pebbles and powdered brick as aggregate.<ref name=InterNACHI>{{cite web|title=the History of Concrete|url=http://www.nachi.org/history-of-concrete.htm|publisher=The International Association of Certified Home Inspectors (InterNACHI)|author=Nick Gromicko and Kenton Shepard|accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref>

===Ancient additives===
Concrete additives have been used since Roman and Egyptian times, when it was discovered that adding [[Pozzolan|volcanic ash]] to the mix allowed it to set underwater. Similarly, the Romans knew that adding [[Horsehair|horse hair]] made concrete less liable to crack while it hardened, and adding blood made it more frost-resistant.<ref>[http://www.djc.com/special/concrete/10003364.htm Brief history of concrete]. Djc.com. Retrieved on 2013-02-19.</ref>

===Modern additives===
In modern times, researchers have experimented with the addition of other materials to create concrete with improved properties, such as higher strength or electrical conductivity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evaluation of Electrically Conductive Concrete Containing Carbon Products for Deicing|url=http://www.conductive-concrete.unomaha.edu/publications/papers/f101m32.pdf|publisher=ACI Materials Journal|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>

==Impact of modern concrete use==
The weight of concrete used worldwide is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.  Concrete's use in the modern world is exceeded only by that of naturally occurring water.<ref name="Cement Trust">{{cite web|title=What is the development impact of concrete?|url=http://cementtrust.wordpress.com/a-concrete-plan/|publisher=Cement Trust|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>

Concrete is also the basis of a large commercial industry. In the United States alone, concrete production is a $30-billion-per-year industry, considering only the value of the ready-mixed concrete sold each year.<ref name=NRMCA2>{{cite web|title=Ready Mixed Concrete Production Statistics|url=http://www.nrmca.org/concrete/data.asp|publisher=NRMCA-National Ready Mixed Concrete Association|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>  Given the size of the concrete industry, and the fundamental way concrete is used to shape the infrastructure of the modern world, it is difficult to overstate the role this material plays today.

==Composition of concrete==
There are many [[types of concrete]] available, created by varying the proportions of the main ingredients below. In this way or by substitution for the cementitious and aggregate phases, the finished product can be tailored to its application with varying strength, density, or chemical and thermal resistance properties.

"[[#Aggregates|Aggregate]]" consists of large chunks of material in a concrete mix, generally a coarse gravel or crushed rocks such as [[limestone]], or [[granite]], along with finer materials such as [[sand]].

"[[#Cement|Cement]]", commonly [[Portland cement]], and other cementitious materials such as [[fly ash]] and [[slag cement]], serve as a binder or a Ligare for the aggregate. 

[[Water]] is then mixed with this dry composite, which produces a semi-liquid that workers can shape (typically by pouring it into a form). The concrete solidifies and hardens to rock-hard strength through a [[Chemical reaction|chemical process]] called [[mineral hydration|hydration]]. The water reacts with the cement, which bonds the other components together, creating a robust stone-like material.

"[[#Chemical admixtures|Chemical admixtures]]" are added to achieve varied properties. These ingredients may speed or slow down the rate at which the concrete hardens, and impart many other useful properties.

"[[#Reinforcement|Reinforcements]]" are often added to concrete.  Concrete can be formulated with high [[compressive strength]], but always has lower [[tensile strength]].  For this reason it is usually reinforced with materials that are strong in tension (often steel).

"[[#Mineral admixtures and blended cements|Mineral admixtures]]" are becoming more popular in recent decades. The use of recycled materials as concrete ingredients has been gaining popularity because of increasingly stringent environmental legislation, and the discovery that such materials often have complimentary and valuable properties. The most conspicuous of these are [[fly ash]], a by-product of [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired power plants]], and [[silica fume]], a byproduct of industrial [[electric arc furnace]]s. The use of these materials in concrete reduces the amount of resources required, as the ash and fume act as a cement replacement. This displaces some cement production, an energetically expensive and environmentally problematic process, while reducing the amount of industrial waste that must be disposed of.

The ''[[types of concrete#Mix design|mix design]]'' depends on the type of structure being built, how the concrete is mixed and delivered, and how it is placed to form the structure.

===Cement===
{{main|Cement}}

[[File:Blocos.JPG|thumb|Blocks of concrete in [[Belo Horizonte]], Brazil.]]

Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general usage. It is a basic ingredient of concrete, [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and [[plaster]]. English masonry worker [[Joseph Aspdin]] patented Portland cement in 1824. It was named because of the similarity of its color to [[Portland stone|Portland limestone]], quarried from the English [[Isle of Portland]] and used extensively in London architecture. It consists of a mixture of oxides of [[calcium oxide|calcium]], [[silicon dioxide|silicon]] and [[aluminium oxide|aluminium]]. Portland cement and similar materials are made by heating [[limestone]] (a source of calcium) with clay and grinding this product (called ''[[clinker (cement)|clinker]]'') with a source of [[sulfate]] (most commonly [[gypsum]]).

In modern [[cement kiln]]s many advanced features are used to lower the fuel consumption per ton of clinker produced.  Cement kilns are extremely large, complex, and inherently dirty industrial installations, and have many undesirable emissions. Of the various ingredients used in concrete the cement is the most energetically expensive.  Even complex and efficient kilns require 3.3 to 3.6 gigajoules of energy to produce a ton of clinker and then grind it into cement.  Many kilns can be fueled with difficult-to-dispose-of wastes, the most common being used tires.  The extremely high temperatures and long periods of time at those temperatures allows cement kilns to efficiently and completely burn even difficult-to-use fuels.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cement Production|url=http://www.iea-etsap.org/web/E-TechDS/PDF/I03_cement_June%202010_GS-gct.pdf|publisher=IEA ETSAP- Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme|accessdate=9 January 2013|author=Evelien.Cochez and Wouter.Nijs|coauthors=Giorgio.Simbolotti and Giancarlo Tosato|location=IEA ETSAP – Technology Brief I03 – June 2010}}</ref>

In recent years, alternatives have been developed to help replace cement. Products such as PLC (Portland Limestone Cement),<ref>{{cite web|title=Lafarge Introduces Portland-Limestone Cement in Canada to Reduce Carbon Footprint, Help Customers Achieve High Standards in Sustainable Construction|url=http://www.lafargenorthamerica.com/wps/portal/na/en/1_8_1-Latest_NewsDetail?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connectlib_na/Site_na/AllPR/PressRelease_1314305417210/PR_Header|publisher=Lafarge North America}}</ref>  which incorporate limestone into the mix, are being tested. This is due to cement production being one of the largest producers (at about 5 to 10%) of global greenhouse gas emissions.<ref name=mit>[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/concrete-pavements-0829.html Paving the way to greenhouse gas reductions].

===Water===
Combining [[water]] with a cementitious material forms a cement paste by the process of hydration. The cement paste glues the aggregate together, fills voids within it, and makes it flow more freely.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gibbons|first=Jack|title=Measuring Water in Concrete|url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/concrete-construction/measuring-water-in-concrete.aspx|publisher=Concrete Construction|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>

Hydration involves many different reactions, often occurring at the same time. As the reactions proceed, the products of the cement hydration process gradually bond together the individual sand and gravel particles and other components of the concrete to form a solid mass.<ref name=Hydration>{{cite web|title=Cement hydration|url=http://www.understanding-cement.com/hydration.html|publisher=Understanding Cement|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>

===Aggregates===
[[File:Gravel 03375C.JPG|thumbnail|right|Crushed stone aggregate]]
{{main|Construction aggregate}}
Fine and coarse aggregates make up the bulk of a concrete mixture. [[Sand]], natural gravel and [[crushed stone]] are used mainly for this purpose. Recycled aggregates (from construction, demolition and excavation waste) are increasingly used as partial replacements of natural aggregates, while a number of manufactured aggregates, including air-cooled [[blast furnace]] slag and [[bottom ash]] are also permitted.

The presence of aggregate greatly increases the durability of concrete above that of cement, which is a brittle material in its pure state.  Thus concrete is a true composite material.<ref>[http://www.engr.psu.edu/ce/courses/ce584/concrete/library/materials/Aggregate/Aggregatesmain.htm The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete]. Engr.psu.edu. Retrieved on 2013-02-19.</ref>

Redistribution of aggregates after compaction often creates inhomogeneity due to the influence of vibration. This can lead to strength gradients.<ref>{{Cite conference

Decorative stones such as [[quartzite]], small river stones or crushed glass are sometimes added to the surface of concrete for a decorative "exposed aggregate" finish, popular among landscape designers.

In addition to being decorative, exposed aggregate adds robustness to a concrete driveway.<ref>[http://www.uniquepaving.com.au/exposed_aggregate.htm Exposed Aggregate]. Uniquepaving.com.au. Retrieved on 2013-02-19.</ref>

===Reinforcement===
{{main|reinforced concrete}}
[[File:Concrete rebar 0030.jpg|thumb|Installing [[rebar]] in a floor slab during a concrete pour.]]
Concrete is strong in [[compression (physical)|compression]], as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load. However, it is weak in [[Tension (physics)|tension]] as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack, allowing the structure to fail. [[Reinforced concrete]] adds either [[rebar|steel reinforcing bars]], steel fibers, glass fiber, or plastic fiber to carry [[tension (physics)|tensile loads]].

===Chemical admixtures===
''[[Chemistry|Chemical]] admixtures'' are materials in the form of powder or fluids that are added to the concrete to give it certain characteristics not obtainable with plain concrete mixes. In normal use, admixture dosages are less than 5% by mass of cement and are added to the concrete at the time of batching/mixing.<ref name = "FHWA Admixtures">{{cite web | author=U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Admixtures | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/admixture.html | accessdate =25 January 2007 | date = 14 June 1999}}</ref> The common types of admixtures<ref>{{cite web | author=Cement Admixture Association | url = http://www.admixtures.org.uk/types.asp | title = Admixture Types | accessdate =25 December 2010}}</ref> are as follows.
* [[Accelerant|Accelerators]] speed up the hydration (hardening) of the concrete. Typical materials used are [[calcium chloride|{{chem|CaCl|2}}]], [[Calcium nitrate|Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]] and [[Sodium nitrate|NaNO<sub>3</sub>]]. However, use of chlorides may cause corrosion in steel reinforcing and is prohibited in some countries, so that nitrates may be favored.
* [[Retarder (chemistry)|Retarders]] slow the hydration of concrete and are used in large or difficult pours where partial setting before the pour is complete is undesirable. Typical [[polyol]] retarders are [[sugar]], [[sucrose]], [[sodium gluconate]], [[glucose]], [[citric acid]], and [[tartaric acid]].
* [[Air entrainment]]s add and entrain tiny air bubbles in the concrete, which reduces damage during [[Weathering|freeze-thaw]] cycles, increasing durability. However, entrained air entails a trade off with strength, as each 1% of air may decrease compressive strength 5%.
* [[Plasticizer]]s increase the workability of plastic or "fresh" concrete, allowing it be placed more easily, with less consolidating effort. A typical plasticizer is lignosulfonate. Plasticizers can be used to reduce the water content of a concrete while maintaining workability and are sometimes called ''water-reducers'' due to this use. Such treatment improves its strength and durability characteristics. [[Superplasticizer]]s (also called ''high-range water-reducers'') are a class of plasticizers that have fewer deleterious effects and can be used to increase workability more than is practical with traditional plasticizers. Compounds used as superplasticizers include sulfonated naphthalene formaldehyde condensate, sulfonated melamine formaldehyde condensate, acetone formaldehyde condensate and polycarboxylate ethers.
* [[Pigment]]s can be used to change the color of concrete, for aesthetics.
* [[Corrosion inhibitor]]s are used to minimize the corrosion of steel and steel bars in concrete.
* Bonding agents are used to create a bond between old and new concrete (typically a type of polymer) .
* Pumping aids improve pumpability, thicken the paste and reduce separation and bleeding.

===Mineral admixtures and blended cements===
There are inorganic materials that also have [[pozzolan]]ic or latent hydraulic properties. These very [[Granularity|fine-grained]] materials are added to the concrete mix to improve the properties of concrete (mineral admixtures),<ref name = "FHWA Admixtures"/> or as a replacement for Portland cement (blended cements).<ref>{{cite book | author=Kosmatka, S.H. | coauthors = Panarese, W.C. | title = Design and Control of Concrete Mixtures | publisher=Portland Cement Association | year = 1988 | location = Skokie, IL, USA | pages = 17, 42, 70, 184 | isbn = 978-0-89312-087-0 }}</ref>
* [[Fly ash]]: A by-product of coal-fired [[power station|electric generating plants]], it is used to partially replace Portland cement (by up to 60% by mass). The properties of fly ash depend on the type of coal burnt. In general, siliceous fly ash is pozzolanic, while [[calcareous]] fly ash has latent hydraulic properties.<ref>{{cite web | author=U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Fly Ash | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/flyash.htm | accessdate =24 January 2007 | date = 14 June 1999 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5QDfIot5I | archivedate = 9 July 2007| deadurl=no}}</ref>
* [[Ground granulated blast furnace slag]] (GGBFS or GGBS): A by-product of steel production is used to partially replace Portland cement (by up to 80% by mass).

* [[Silica fume]]: A byproduct of the production of silicon and [[ferrosilicon]] alloys. Silica fume is similar to fly ash, but has a particle size 100 times smaller. This results in a higher surface-to-volume ratio and a much faster pozzolanic reaction. Silica fume is used to increase strength and durability of concrete, but generally requires the use of superplasticizers for workability.<ref>{{cite web | author=U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Silica Fume | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/silica.htm | accessdate =24 January 2007 }}</ref>
* High reactivity [[Metakaolin]] (HRM): Metakaolin produces concrete with strength and durability similar to concrete made with silica fume. While silica fume is usually dark gray or black in color, high-reactivity metakaolin is usually bright white in color, making it the preferred choice for architectural concrete where appearance is important.

==Concrete production==
[[File:Osthafen-lieferbeton-ffm001.jpg|thumb|Concrete plant facility (background) with concrete delivery trucks.]]

Concrete production is the process of mixing together the various ingredients&mdash;water, aggregate, cement, and any additives&mdash;to produce concrete.  Concrete production is time-sensitive. Once the ingredients are mixed, workers must put the concrete in place before it hardens.

There is a wide variety of equipment for processing concrete, from hand tools to heavy industrial machinery.  Whichever equipment builders use, however, the objective is to produce the desired building material; ingredients must be properly mixed, placed, shaped, and retained within time constraints.  Once the mix is where it should be, the curing process must be controlled to ensure that the concrete attains the desired attributes. During concrete preparation, various technical details may affect the quality and nature of the product.

When initially mixed, Portland cement and water rapidly form a [[gel]] of tangled chains of interlocking crystals, and components of the gel continue to react over time. Initially the gel is fluid, which improves workability and aids in placement of the material, but as the concrete sets, the chains of crystals join into a rigid structure, counteracting the fluidity of the gel and fixing the particles of aggregate in place. During curing, the cement continues to react with the residual water in a process of [[hydration reaction|hydration]]. In properly formulated concrete, once this curing process has terminated the product has the desired physical and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]]. Among the qualities typically desired, are [[Strength of materials|mechanical strength]], low moisture permeability, and chemical and volumetric stability.

===Mixing concrete===
{{See also|Volumetric concrete mixer}}
Thorough mixing is essential for the production of uniform, high-quality concrete. For this reason equipment and methods should be capable of effectively mixing concrete materials containing the largest specified aggregate to produce ''uniform mixtures'' of the lowest slump practical for the work.

''Separate paste mixing'' has shown that the mixing of cement and water into a paste before combining these materials with [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]] can increase the [[compressive strength]] of the resulting concrete.<ref>[http://www.concreteinternational.com/pages/featured_article.asp?ID=3491 Premixed cement paste]. Concreteinternational.com (1989-11-01). Retrieved on 2013-02-19.</ref> The paste is generally mixed in a ''high-speed'', shear-type mixer at a [[Water-cement ratio|w/cm]] (water to cement ratio) of 0.30 to 0.45 by mass. The cement paste premix may include admixtures such as accelerators or retarders, [[Plasticizer|superplasticizers]], [[pigment]]s, or [[silica fume]]. The premixed paste is then blended with aggregates and any remaining batch water and final mixing is completed in conventional concrete mixing equipment.<ref>[http://www.concrete.org/COMMITTEES/committeehome.asp?committee_code=0000304-00 Measuring, mixing, transporting and placing concrete]. Concrete.org. Retrieved on 2013-02-19.</ref>

High-energy mixed (HEM) concrete is produced by means of high-speed mixing of cement, water and sand with net [[Energy density|specific energy]] consumption of at least 5 kilojoules per kilogram of the mix. A [[plasticizer]] or a [[superplasticizer]] is then added to the activated mixture, which can later be mixed with aggregates in a conventional [[concrete mixer]]. In this process, sand provides dissipation of energy and creates high-shear conditions on the surface of cement particles. This results in the full volume of water interacting with cement. The liquid activated mixture can be used by itself or foamed (expanded) for lightweight concrete.<ref>{{US patent|5443313}} – Method for producing construction mixture for concrete</ref> HEM concrete hardens in low and subzero temperature conditions and possesses an increased volume of gel, which drastically reduces [[capillarity]] in solid and porous materials.

[[File:Concreteathruz.jpg|thumb|Pouring and smoothing out concrete at Palisades Park in Washington DC.]]
{{Main|Concrete slump test}}
''Workability'' is the ability of a fresh (plastic) concrete mix to fill the form/mold properly with the desired work (vibration) and without reducing the concrete's quality. Workability depends on water content, aggregate (shape and size distribution), cementitious content and age (level of [[hydration reaction|hydration]]) and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures, like superplasticizer. Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete workability. Excessive water leads to increased bleeding ([[surface water]]) and/or [[Segregation in concrete|segregation of aggregates]] (when the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump, which cannot readily be made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water.

Workability can be measured by the [[concrete slump test]], a simplistic measure of the plasticity of a fresh batch of concrete following the [[ASTM]] C 143 or EN 12350-2 test standards. Slump is normally measured by filling an "[[Duff Abrams|Abrams cone]]" with a sample from a fresh batch of concrete. The cone is placed with the wide end down onto a level, non-absorptive surface. It is then filled in three layers of equal volume, with each layer being tamped with a steel rod to consolidate the layer. When the cone is carefully lifted off, the enclosed material slumps a certain amount, owing to gravity. A relatively dry sample slumps very little, having a slump value of one or two inches (25 or 50&nbsp;mm) out of one foot (305&nbsp;mm). A relatively wet concrete sample may slump as much as eight inches. Workability can also be measured by the [[flow table test]].

Slump can be increased by addition of chemical admixtures such as plasticizer or [[superplasticizer]] without changing the [[water-cement ratio]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ferrari|first1=L|last2=Kaufmann|first2=J|last3=Winnefeld|first3=F|last4=Plank|first4=J|title=Multi-method approach to study influence of superplasticizers on cement suspensions|journal=Cement and Concrete Research|volume=41|page=1058|year=2011|doi=10.1016/j.cemconres.2011.06.010|issue=10}}</ref> Some other admixtures, especially air-entraining admixture, can increase the slump of a mix.

High-flow concrete, like [[self-consolidating concrete]], is tested by other flow-measuring methods. One of these methods includes placing the cone on the narrow end and observing how the mix flows through the cone while it is gradually lifted.

After mixing, concrete is a fluid and can be pumped to the location where needed.

===Curing===
[[File:Curing-concrete.jpg|thumb|A concrete slab ponded while curing.]]
In all but the least critical applications, care must be taken to properly ''cure'' concrete, to achieve best strength and hardness. This happens after the concrete has been placed. Cement requires a moist, controlled environment to gain strength and harden fully. The cement paste hardens over time, initially setting and becoming rigid though very weak and gaining in strength in the weeks following. In around 4 weeks, typically over 90% of the final strength is reached, though strengthening may continue for decades.<ref>{{cite web | title=Concrete Testing | url=http://technology.calumet.purdue.edu/cnt/rbennet/concrete%20lab.htm | accessdate=10 November 2008}}</ref> The conversion of [[calcium hydroxide]] in the concrete into [[calcium carbonate]] from absorption of [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] over several decades further strengthens the concrete and makes it more resistant to damage. However, this reaction, called [[carbonation]], lowers the pH of the cement pore solution and can cause the reinforcement bars to corrode.

Hydration and hardening of concrete during the first three days is critical. Abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased tensile stresses at a time when it has not yet gained sufficient strength, resulting in greater shrinkage cracking. The early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during the curing process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking. High-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster, often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking. The strength of concrete changes (increases) for up to three years. It depends on cross-section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation.<ref>Resulting strength distribution in vertical elements researched and presented at the article [http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf "Concrete inhomogeneity of vertical cast-in-place elements in skeleton-type buildings".]</ref>

During this period concrete must be kept under controlled temperature and humid atmosphere. In practice, this is achieved by spraying or ponding the concrete surface with water, thereby protecting the concrete mass from ill effects of ambient conditions. The pictures to the right show two of many ways to achieve this, ponding&nbsp;– submerging setting concrete in water and wrapping in plastic to contain the water in the mix. Additional common curing methods include wet burlap and/or plastic sheeting covering the fresh concrete, or by spraying on a water-impermeable temporary curing membrane.

Properly curing concrete leads to increased strength and lower permeability and avoids cracking where the surface dries out prematurely. Care must also be taken to avoid freezing or overheating due to the [[exothermic]] setting of cement. Improper curing can cause [[Spalling#Spalling in mechanical weathering|scaling]], reduced strength, poor [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] resistance and [[fracture|cracking]].

==Properties==
{{Main|Properties of concrete}}
Concrete has relatively high [[compressive strength]], but much lower [[tensile strength]].  For this reason it is usually reinforced with materials that are strong in tension (often steel). The elasticity of concrete is relatively constant at low stress levels but starts decreasing at higher stress levels as matrix cracking develops. Concrete has a very low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] and shrinks as it matures. All concrete structures crack to some extent, due to shrinkage and tension. Concrete that is subjected to long-duration forces is prone to [[Creep (deformation)|creep]].

Tests can be performed to ensure that the properties of concrete correspond to specifications for the application.

Different mixes of concrete ingredients produce different strengths, which are measured in psi or MPa.

Different strengths of concrete are used for different purposes.  Very low-strength (2000 psi or less) concrete may be used when the concrete must be lightweight.<ref name=lightweight>{{cite web|title=Structural lightweight concrete|url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Structural%20Lightweight%20Concrete_tcm45-345994.pdf|work=Concrete Construction|publisher=The Aberdeen Group|date=March, 1981}}</ref>  Lightweight concrete is often achieved by adding air, foams, or lightweight aggregates, with the side effect that the strength is reduced.  For most routine uses, 3000-psi to 4000-psi concrete is often used.  5000-psi concrete is readily commercially available as a more durable, although more expensive, option.  5000-psi concrete is often used for larger civil projects.<ref name=American>{{cite web|title=Ordering Concrete by PSI|url=http://www.americanconcreteofiowa.com/aspx/diy.aspx?id=30|publisher=American Concrete|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>  Strengths above 5000 psi are often used for specific building elements.  For example, the lower floor columns of high-rise concrete buildings may use concrete of 12,000 psi or more, to keep the size of the columns small.  Bridges may use long beams of 10,000 psi concrete to lower the number of spans required.<ref name=Russel /><ref name=NRMCA>{{cite web|title=Concrete in Practice: What, Why, and How?|url=http://www.nrmca.org/aboutconcrete/cips/33p.pdf|publisher=NRMCA-National Ready Mixed Concrete Association|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>  Occasionally, other structural needs may require high-strength concrete. If a structure must be very rigid, concrete of very high strength may be specified, even much stronger than is required to bear the service loads. Strengths as high as 19,000 psi have been used commercially for these reasons.<ref name=Russel>{{cite web|title=Why Use High Performance Concrete?|url=http://www.silicafume.org/pdf/reprints-whyhpc.pdf|work=Technical Talk|accessdate=10 January 2013|author=Henry G.

==Concrete degradation==
[[File:Betonrot Hippodroom.JPG|thumb|Concrete [[spalling]] caused by the [[corrosion]] of [[rebar]]]]
{{Main|Concrete degradation}}
Concrete can be damaged by many processes, such as the expansion of [[corrosion]] products of the steel [[rebar|reinforcement bars]], freezing of trapped water, fire or radiant heat, aggregate expansion, sea water effects, bacterial corrosion, leaching, erosion by fast-flowing water, physical damage and chemical damage (from [[carbonatation]], chlorides, sulfates and distillate water).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Environmental and health==
{{main|Environmental impact of concrete}}
The manufacture and use of concrete produce a wide range of environmental and social consequences. Some are harmful, some welcome, and some both, depending on circumstances.  A major component of concrete is [[cement]], which similarly exerts [[Cement#Environmental impacts|environmental and social effects]].

The cement industry is one of the three primary producers of [[carbon dioxide]], a major [[greenhouse gas]]. The other two are the energy production and transportation industries.

Concrete is used to create hard surfaces that contribute to [[surface runoff]], which can cause heavy soil erosion, water pollution, and flooding, but conversely can be used to divert, dam, and control flooding.
Concrete is a primary contributor to the [[urban heat island]] effect, though less so than asphalt.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Workers who cut, grind or polish concrete are at risk of inhaling airborne silica, which can lead to [[silicosis]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Shepherd and Woskie|title=Controlling Dust from Concrete Saw Cutting|url=http://www.cpwr.com/Key%20Findings/ShepherdWoskieConcreteCuttingKF.pdf|work=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>  Concrete dust released by building demolition and natural disasters can be a major source of dangerous air pollution.

The presence of some substances in concrete, including useful and unwanted additives, can cause health concerns due to toxicity and radioactivity.
Wet concrete is highly alkaline and must be handled with proper protective equipment.

[[File:Crushed Concrete Granular Fill.jpg|thumb|Recycled crushed concrete, to be reused as granular fill, is loaded into a semi-dump truck.]]

==Concrete recycling==
{{Main|Concrete recycling}}

Concrete recycling is an increasingly common method of disposing of concrete structures. Concrete debris was once routinely shipped to [[landfill]]s for disposal, but recycling is increasing due to improved environmental awareness, governmental laws and economic benefits.

Concrete, which must be free of trash, wood, paper and other such materials, is collected from demolition sites and put through a [[crusher|crushing machine]], often along with [[asphalt]], bricks and rocks.

Reinforced concrete contains [[rebar]] and other metallic reinforcements, which are removed with [[magnet]]s and recycled elsewhere. The remaining aggregate chunks are sorted by size. Larger chunks may go through the crusher again. Smaller pieces of concrete are used as gravel for new construction projects. [[Aggregate base]] gravel is laid down as the lowest layer in a road, with fresh concrete or asphalt placed over it. Crushed recycled concrete can sometimes be used as the dry aggregate for brand new concrete if it is free of contaminants, though the use of recycled concrete limits strength and is not allowed in many jurisdictions. On 3 March 1983, a government-funded research team (the VIRL research.codep) estimated that almost 17% of worldwide landfill was by-products of concrete based waste.

==Use of concrete in infrastructure==
[[File:TaumSaukReservoir underconstruction.jpg|right|thumb|Aerial photo of reconstruction at [[Taum Sauk Hydroelectric Power Station|Taum Sauk]] (Missouri) pumped storage facility in late November, 2009. After the original reservoir failed, the new reservoir was made of roller-compacted concrete.]]

===Mass concrete structures===
{{main|Mass concrete}}

Large concrete structures such as [[dam]]s, [[navigation lock]]s, large mat foundations, and large [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] generate excessive heat during cement hydration and associated expansion. To mitigate these effects [[post-cooling]]<ref name="BerkCE">[http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~paulmont/165/Mass_concrete2.pdf Mass Concrete]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2013-02-19.</ref> is commonly applied during construction. An early example at Hoover Dam, installed a network of pipes between vertical concrete placements to circulate cooling water during the curing process to avoid damaging overheating.  Similar systems are still used; depending on volume of the pour, the concrete mix used, and ambient air temperature, the cooling process may last for many months after the concrete is placed. Various methods also are used to pre-cool the concrete mix in mass concrete structures.<ref name="BerkCE"/>

Another approach to mass concrete structures that is becoming more widespread is the use of [[roller-compacted concrete]], which uses much lower amounts of cement and water than conventional concrete mixtures and is generally not poured into place.  Instead it is placed in thick layers as a semi-dry material and compacted into a dense, strong mass with rolling compactors.  Because it uses less cementitious material, roller-compacted concrete has a much lower cooling requirement than conventional concrete.

===Prestressed concrete structures===
[[File:Scott System cacti.jpg|40-foot cacti decorate a sound/retaining wall in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]|thumb]]
{{Main|Prestressed concrete}}
[[Prestressed concrete]] is a form of reinforced concrete that builds in [[compressive stress]]es during construction to oppose those experienced in use. This can greatly reduce the weight of beams or slabs, by
better distributing the stresses in the structure to make optimal use of the reinforcement. For example, a horizontal beam tends to sag. Prestressed reinforcement along the bottom of the beam counteracts this.
In pre-tensioned concrete, the prestressing is achieved by using steel or polymer tendons or bars that are subjected to a tensile force prior to casting, or for post-tensioned concrete, after casting.

===Concrete textures===
When one thinks of concrete, the image of a dull, gray concrete wall often comes to mind. With the use of [[form liner]], concrete can be cast and molded into different textures and used for [[decorative concrete]] applications. Sound/retaining walls, bridges, office buildings and more serve as the optimal canvases for concrete art. For example, the Pima Freeway/Loop 101 retaining and sound walls in Scottsdale, Arizona, feature desert flora and fauna, a {{convert|67|ft|m|adj=on}} lizard and {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} cacti along the {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch. The project, titled "The Path Most Traveled," is one example of how concrete can be shaped using elastomeric form liner.

==Building with concrete==
Concrete is one of the most durable building materials. It provides superior fire resistance compared with wooden construction and gains strength over time. Structures made of concrete can have a long service life. Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world<ref name=mit/> with annual consumption estimated at between 21 and 31&nbsp;billion tonnes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
[[File:Buffalo City Court Building, 1971-74, Pfohl, Roberts and Biggie (8448022295).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Buffalo City Court Building]] in [[Buffalo, NY]].]]
Concrete is used more than any other manmade material in the world.<ref name=Lomborg>{{cite book|title=The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World|authorlink=Bjørn Lomborg|last=Lomborg|first=Bjørn|year=2001|isbn=978-0-521-80447-9|page=138}}</ref> As of 2006, about 7.5 billion cubic meters of concrete are made each year, more than one cubic meter for every person on Earth.<ref>{{cite web | title = Minerals commodity summary – cement – 2007 | publisher=US [[United States Geological Survey]]|date=1 June 2007|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cement/index.html|accessdate=16 January 2008}}<!--Computed by taking 2007 figure for world concrete production and the mix at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete#Regular_concrete and computing the volume--></ref>

Concrete powers a {{US$|35 billion}} industry, employing more than two million workers in the United States alone.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} More than {{convert|55000|mi|km}} of highways in the United States are paved with this material. [[Reinforced concrete]], [[prestressed concrete]] and [[precast concrete]] are the most widely used types of concrete functional extensions in modern days.

===Energy efficiency===
Energy requirements for transportation of concrete are low because it is produced locally from local resources, typically manufactured within 100 kilometers of the job site. Similarly, relatively little energy is used in producing and combining the raw materials (although large amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> are produced by the chemical reactions in [[Cement#CO2 emissions|cement manufacture]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} The overall [[embodied energy]] of concrete is therefore lower than for most structural materials other than wood.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Once in place, concrete offers great energy efficiency over the lifetime of a building.<ref>John Gajda (2001) [http://www.arxx.com/Assets/CMS/WYSIWYGBase/file/5825%20PCA%20CD026.pdf Energy Use of Single Family Houses with Various Exterior Walls], Construction Technology Laboratories Inc.</ref> Concrete walls leak air far less than those made of wood frames{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. Air leakage accounts for a large percentage of energy loss from a home. The thermal mass properties of concrete increase the efficiency of both residential and commercial buildings. By storing and releasing the energy needed for heating or cooling, concrete's thermal mass delivers year-round benefits by reducing temperature swings inside and minimizing heating and cooling costs.<ref name="Features and Usage of Foam Concrete">{{cite web|title=Features and Usage of Foam Concrete|url=http://www.chinaconcretepump.com/Foam-Concrete-Machine.html/}}</ref> While insulation reduces energy loss through the building envelope, thermal mass uses walls to store and release energy. Modern concrete wall systems use both external insulation and thermal mass to create an energy-efficient building. Insulating concrete forms (ICFs) are hollow blocks or panels made of either insulating foam or [[rastra]] that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.

===Pervious concrete===
{{Main|Pervious concrete}}
Pervious concrete is a mix of specially graded coarse aggregate, cement, water and little-to-no fine aggregates. This concrete is also known as “no-fines” or porous concrete. Mixing the ingredients in a carefully controlled process creates a paste that coats and bonds the aggregate particles. The hardened concrete contains interconnected air voids totalling approximately 15 to 25 percent. Water runs through the voids in the pavement to the soil underneath. Air entrainment admixtures are often used in freeze&ndash;thaw climates to minimize
the possibility of frost damage.

===Fire safety===
[[File:1981 BostonCityHall byLebovich8 HABS MA1176 crop.jpg|thumb|A modern building: [[Boston City Hall]] (completed 1968) is constructed largely of concrete, both precast and poured in place. Of [[Brutalist]] architecture, it was voted "The World's Ugliest Building" in 2008.]]

Concrete buildings are more resistant to fire than those constructed using steel frames, since concrete has lower heat conductivity than steel and can thus last longer under the same fire conditions. Concrete is sometimes used as a fire protection for steel frames, for the same effect as above. Concrete as a fire shield, for example [[Fondu fyre]], can also be used in extreme environments like a missile launch pad.

Options for non-combustible construction include floors, ceilings and roofs made of cast-in-place and hollow-core precast concrete. For walls, concrete masonry technology and [[Insulating concrete forms|Insulating Concrete Forms]] (ICFs) are additional options. ICFs are hollow blocks or panels made of fireproof insulating foam that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.

Concrete also provides good resistance against externally applied forces such as high winds, hurricanes, and tornadoes owing to its lateral stiffness, which results in minimal horizontal movement. However this stiffness can work against certain types of concrete structures, particularly where a relatively higher flexing structure is require to resist more extreme forces.

===Earthquake safety===
As discussed above, concrete is very strong in compression, but weak in tension. Larger earthquakes can generate very large shear loads on structures. These shear loads subject the structure to both tensile and compressional loads. Concrete structures without reinforcement, like other unreinforced masonry structures, can fail during severe earthquake shaking. Unreinforced masonry structures constitute one of the largest earthquake risks globally.<ref>[http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=4067 Unreinforced Masonry Buildings and Earthquakes: Developing Successful Risk Reduction Programs], FEMA P-774 / October 2009</ref> These risks can be reduced through seismic retrofitting of at-risk buildings, (e.g. school buildings in Istanbul, Turkey<ref>[http://www.curee.org/architecture/docs/S08-034.pdf Seismic Retrofit Design Of Historic Century-Old School Buildings In Istanbul, Turkey], C.C. Simsir, A. Jain, G.C. Hart, and M.P. Levy, The 14th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering,  12–17 October 2008, Beijing, China</ref>).
