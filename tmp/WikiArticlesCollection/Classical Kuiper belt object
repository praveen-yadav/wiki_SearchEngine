{{TNO}}

A '''classical Kuiper belt object''', also called a '''cubewano''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|juː|b|iː|ˈ|w|ʌ|n|oʊ}} "QB1-o")<ref>Somewhat old-fashioned, but still used by the Minor Planet Center for their list of [http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/mpec/K10/K10S44.html Distant Minor Planets]</ref> is a low-eccentricity [[Kuiper belt]] object (KBO) that [[orbit]]s beyond [[Neptune]] and is not controlled by an [[Resonant trans-Neptunian object|orbital resonance with Neptune]]. Cubewanos have orbits with [[Semi-major axis|semi-major axes]] in the 40–50&nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]] range and, unlike [[Pluto]], do not cross Neptune’s orbit. That is, they have low-eccentricity and sometimes low-inclination orbits like the classical planets. 
  
The name "cubewano" derives from the first [[trans-Neptunian object]] (TNO) found after Pluto and [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], {{mpl|(15760) 1992 QB|1}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/kb/def_classical.html|title=Classical Kuiper Belt Objects|author=Dr. David Jewitt|publisher=David Jewitt/UCLA|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref> Similar objects found later were often called "QB1-o's", or "cubewanos", after this object, though the term "classical" is much more frequently used in the scientific literature.

Objects identified as cubewanos include:

==Orbits: 'hot' and 'cold' populations==
Most cubewanos are found between the 2:3 [[orbital resonance]] with Neptune (populated by [[plutino]]s) and the 1:2 resonance. [[50000 Quaoar]], for example, has a near-circular orbit close to the [[ecliptic]]. Plutinos, on the other hand, have more eccentric orbits bringing some of them closer to the Sun than [[Neptune]].

The majority of objects (the so-called 'cold population'), have low inclinations and near-circular orbits. A smaller population (the 'hot population') is characterised by highly inclined, more eccentric orbits.<ref name="JewittDelsanti2006">

=== Distribution ===
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt 55AU ClassicalAndPlutinos.svg|right|thumb|400px|This diagram plots the distribution of cubewanos and resonant trans-Neptunian objects (including plutinos). [[Histogram]]s are shown for orbit inclinations, eccentricity, and semi-major axes distribution. Inserts on the left compare the populations of cubewanos and plutinos using eccentricity versus inclination plots.]]

The vast majority of KBOs (more than two-thirds) have inclinations of less than 5° and eccentricities of less than 0.1. Their semi-major axes show a preference for the middle of the main belt; arguably, smaller objects close to the limiting resonances have been either captured into resonance or have their orbits modified by Neptune.

The 'hot' and 'cold' populations are strikingly different: more than 30% of all cubewanos are in low inclination, near-circular orbits. The parameters of the plutinos’ orbits are more evenly distributed, with a local maximum in moderate eccentricities in  0.15–0.2 range and low inclinations 5–10°.

When the orbital eccentricities of cubewanos and plutinos are compared, it can be seen that the cubewanos form a clear 'belt' outside Neptune's orbit, whereas the plutinos approach, or even cross Neptune's orbit. When orbital inclinations are compared, 'hot' cubewanos can be easily distinguished by their higher inclinations, as the plutinos typically keep orbits below 20°. (No clear explanation currently exists for the inclinations of 'hot' cubewanos.<ref>

== Cold and hot populations: physical characteristics ==
In addition to the distinct orbital characteristics, the two populations display different physical characteristics.

The difference in colour between the red cold population and more heterogeneous hot population was observed as early as in 2002.<ref name="Doressoundiram2002">

Recent studies, based on a larger data set, indicate the cut-off inclination of 12° (instead of 5°) between the cold and hot populations while confirming the distinction between the homogenous red cold population and the bluish hot population.<ref name="LacerdaJewitt2008">

Another difference between the low-inclination (cold) and high-inclination (hot) classical objects is the observed number of [[binary asteroid|binary objects]]. Binaries are quite common on low-inclination orbits and are typically similar-brightness systems. Binaries are less common on high-inclination orbits and their components typically differ in brightness. This correlation, together with the differences in colour, support further the suggestion that the currently observed classical objects belong to at least two different overlapping populations, with different physical properties and orbital history.<ref name="NollGrundy-binaries2008">

==Toward a formal definition==
There is no official definition of 'cubewano' or 'classical KBO'. However, the terms are normally used to refer to objects free from significant perturbation from Neptune, thereby excluding KBOs in orbital resonance with Neptune ([[resonant trans-Neptunian object]]s). The [[Minor Planet Center]] (MPC) and the [[Deep Ecliptic Survey]] (DES) do not list cubewanos (classical objects) using the same criteria. Many TNOs classified as cubewanos by the MPC are classified as ScatNear (possibly [[Perturbation (astronomy)|scattered]] by Neptune) by the DES.  Dwarf planet [[Makemake (dwarf planet)|Makemake]] is such a borderline classical cubewano/scatnear object. {{mpl|(119951) 2002 KX|14}} may be an inner cubewano near the [[plutino]]s. Furthermore, there is evidence that the Kuiper belt has an 'edge', in that an apparent lack of low-inclination objects beyond 47-49&nbsp;AU was suspected as early as 1998 and shown with more data in 2001.<ref name="Trujillo 2001">

 |bibcode=2001ApJ...554L..95T
 |doi=10.1086/320917
}}</ref> Consequently, the traditional usage of the terms is based on the orbit’s semi-major axis, and includes objects situated between the 2:3 and 1:2 resonances, that is between 39.4 and 47.8 AU (with exclusion of these resonances and the minor ones in-between).<ref name="JewittDelsanti2006"/>

These definitions lack precision: in particular the boundary between the classical objects and the [[scattered disk]] remains blurred. As of 2010, there are 377 objects with perihelion (q) > 40 AU and aphelion (Q) < 47AU.<ref name="JPL-SSD">

=== DES classification ===
Introduced by the report from the [[Deep Ecliptic Survey]] by J. L. Elliott ''et al.'' in 2005 uses formal criteria based on the mean orbital parameters.<ref name="DES_Elliot2006"/> Put informally, the definition includes the objects that have never crossed the orbit of Neptune. According to this definition, an object qualifies as a classical KBO if:
*it is not [[Resonant trans-Neptunian object|resonant]]
*its average [[Tisserand's parameter]] with respect to Neptune exceeds 3
*its average eccentricity is less than 0.2.

=== SSBN07 classification ===
An alternative classification, introduced by [[Brett J. Gladman|B. Gladman]], [[Brian G. Marsden|B. Marsden]] and C. VanLaerhoven in 2007, uses a 10-million-year orbit integration instead of the Tisserand's parameter. Classical objects are defined as not resonant and not being currently scattered by Neptune.<ref name="ArizonaBook_Gladman2007">

Formally, this definition includes as ''classical'' all objects with their ''current'' orbits that
*are non-resonant (see the [[Resonant trans-Neptunian object#Classification methods|definition of the method]])
*have a semi-major axis greater than that of Neptune (i.e. excluding centaurs) but less than 2000 AU (to exclude inner-Oort-cloud objects)
*have their eccentricity <math>e < 0.240</math> (to exclude detached objects)
Unlike other schemes, this definition includes the objects with major semi-axis less than 39.4 AU (2:3 resonance) – termed '''''inner classical belt''''', or more than 48.7 (1:2 resonance) – termed '''''outer classical belt''''', while reserving the term '''''main  classical belt''''' for the orbits between these two resonances.<ref name="ArizonaBook_Gladman2007"/>
