In [[organic chemistry]], an '''alkene''', '''olefin''', or '''olefine''' is an [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] [[chemical compound]] containing at least one [[carbon]]–carbon [[double bond]].<ref name="Wade">{{cite book | last = Wade | first = L.G. | title = Organic Chemistry | publisher = Pearson [[Prentice Hall]] | date = Sixth Ed., 2006 | pages = 279 | isbn = 1-4058-5345-X }}</ref> The simplest acyclic alkenes, with only one double bond and no other [[functional group]]s, known as mono-enes, form a [[homologous series]] of [[hydrocarbon]]s with the general formula {{Carbon}}<sub>n</sub>{{Hydrogen}}<sub>2n</sub>.<ref name="PAC1995">{{cite journal| title=Glossary of Class Names of Organic Compounds and Reactive Intermediates Based on Structure (IUPAC Recommendations 1995)  | last = Moss | first = G.

The simplest alkene is [[ethylene]] (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>), which has the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) name ''ethene''. In the [[petrochemical]] industry alkenes are often called ''olefins''. For bridged alkenes, the [[Bredt's rule]] states that a double bond cannot be placed at the bridgehead of a bridged ring system, unless the rings are large enough (8 or more atoms). [[Aromatic]] compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes, but their structure and properties are different and they are not considered to be alkenes.<ref name="PAC1995">{{cite journal| journal= [[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] | year=1995| volume=67 | pages=1307–1375

== Structure ==

===Bonding===
[[Image:Ethylene 3D.png|200px|thumb|Ethylene (ethene), showing the pi bond in green.]]
Like single [[covalent bond]]s, double bonds can be described in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals, except that, unlike a single bond (which consists of a single [[sigma bond]]), a carbon–carbon double bond consists of one [[sigma bond]] and one [[pi bond]]. This double bond is stronger than a single [[covalent bond]] (611&nbsp;[[joules|kJ]]/[[Mole (unit)|mol]] for C=C vs. 347&nbsp;kJ/mol for C–C)<ref name="Wade"/> and also shorter with an average [[bond length]] of 1.33 [[Angstrom]]s (133 [[picometre|pm]]).

Each carbon of the double bond uses its three ''sp²'' [[orbital hybridization|hybrid orbitals]] to form sigma bonds to three atoms. The unhybridized ''2p'' atomic orbitals, which lie perpendicular to the plane created by the axes of the three ''sp²'' hybrid orbitals, combine to form the pi bond. This bond lies outside the main C–C axis, with half of the bond on one side and half on the other.

Rotation about the carbon–carbon double bond is restricted because it involves breaking the pi bond, which requires a large amount of energy (264&nbsp;kJ/mol in ethylene). As a consequence, substituted alkenes may exist as one of two [[isomer]]s, called ''cis'' or ''trans'' isomers. More complex alkenes may be named using the [[E-Z notation]], used to describe molecules having three or four different [[substituent]]s (side groups). For example, of the [[Butene#Isomers|isomers of butene]], the two methyl groups of (''Z'')-but-2[[-ene]] (aka ''cis''-2-butene) face the same side of the double bond, and in (''E'')-but2-ene (aka ''trans''-2-butene) the methyl groups face the opposite side. These two isomers of butene are slightly different in their chemical and physical properties.

It is certainly not impossible to twist a double bond. In fact, a 90° twist requires an energy approximately equal to half the strength of a [[pi bond]]. The misalignment of the [[p orbital]]s is less than expected because [[pyramidalization]] takes place (See: [[pyramidal alkene]]). [[cyclooctene|''trans''-Cyclooctene]] is a stable strained alkene and the orbital misalignment is only 19° with a [[dihedral angle]] of 137° (normal 120°) and a degree of pyramidalization of 18°. This explains the [[dipole]] moment of 0.8 [[debye|D]] for this compound ([[cis-isomer]] 0.4 D) where a value of zero is expected.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Understanding Rotation about a C=C Double Bond| first2=Thomas H.| last2=Eberlein| last=Barrows| first=Susan E.| journal=J. Chem. Educ.| year=2005| volume=82| pages=1329| url=http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/Journal/Issues/2005/Sep/abs1329.html| doi=10.1021/ed082p1329| issue=9|bibcode = 2005JChEd..82.1329B }}</ref> The ''trans'' isomer of [[cycloheptene]] is only stable at low temperatures.

=== Shape ===
As predicted by the [[VSEPR theory|VSEPR]] model of [[electron]] pair repulsion, the [[molecular geometry]] of alkenes includes [[bond angle]]s about each carbon in a double bond of about 120°. The angle may vary because of [[steric strain]] introduced by [[nonbonded interactions]] created by [[functional group]]s attached to the carbons of the double bond. For example, the C-C-C bond angle in [[propylene]] is 123.9°.

==Physical properties==
The physical properties of alkenes are comparable with those of [[alkane]]s. The main differences between the two are that the [[acid]]ity levels of alkenes are much higher than the ones in alkanes. The [[physical state]] depends on [[molecular mass]]. The simplest alkenes, [[ethene]], [[propene]] and [[butene]] are gases. Linear alkenes of approximately five to sixteen carbons are liquids, and higher alkenes are waxy solids.

==Reactions==
Alkenes are relatively stable compounds, but are more reactive than [[alkane]]s due to the presence of a carbon–carbon pi-bond. It is also attributed to the presence of pi-electrons in the molecule. The majority of the reactions of alkenes involve the rupture of this pi bond, forming new [[sigma bond|single bonds]].

Alkenes serve as a feedstock for the [[petrochemical]] industry because they can participate in a wide variety of reactions.

===Addition reactions===
Alkenes react in many [[addition reaction]]s, which occur by opening up the double-bond. Most addition reactions to alkenes follow the mechanism of [[electrophilic addition]]. Examples of [[addition reaction]]s are [[hydrohalogenation]], [[halogenation]], [[halohydrin formation]], [[oxymercuration]], [[Hydroboration–oxidation reaction|hydroboration]], [[dichlorocarbene addition]], [[Simmons–Smith reaction]], [[catalytic hydrogenation]], [[epoxidation]], [[radical polymerization]] and [[hydroxylation]].
:[[File:Ear.png|400px|alt=Electrophilic addition|Electrophilic addition of X–Y to an alkene]]

====Hydrogenation====
[[Hydrogenation]] of alkenes produces the corresponding [[alkane]]s. The reaction is carried out under pressure at a temperature of 200 °C in the presence of a metallic [[catalyst]]. Common industrial catalysts are based on [[platinum]], [[nickel]] or [[palladium]]. For laboratory syntheses, [[Raney nickel]] (an [[alloy]] of nickel and aluminium) is often employed. The simplest example of this reaction is the catalytic hydrogenation of [[ethylene]] to yield [[ethane]]:
:CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> → CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>

====Hydration====
[[Hydration reaction|Hydration]], the addition of water across the double bond of alkenes, yields [[alcohols]]. The reaction is catalyzed by strong [[acids]] such as [[sulfuric acid]]. This reaction is carried out on an industrial scale to make [[ethanol]].

:CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> → CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>OH

Alkenes can also be converted into alcohols via [[oxymercuration reaction|oxymercuration]].

====Halogenation====
In [[electrophilic halogenation]] the addition of elemental [[bromine]] or [[chlorine]] to alkenes yields [[vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]] dibromo- and dichloroalkanes (1,2-dihalides or ethylene dihalides), respectively. The decoloration of a solution of bromine in water with dichloromethylene as catalyst is an analytical test for the presence of alkenes:

:CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub> + Br<sub>2</sub> → BrCH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>Br

It is also used as a quantitative test of unsaturation, expressed as the [[bromine number]] of a single compound or mixture. The reaction works because the high electron density at the double bond causes a temporary shift of electrons in the Br-Br bond causing a temporary induced dipole. This makes the Br closest to the double bond slightly positive and therefore an electrophile.

====Hydrohalogenation====
[[Hydrohalogenation]] is the addition of [[hydrohalic acid]]s such as [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]] or [[hydrogen iodide|HI]] to alkenes to yield the corresponding [[haloalkane]]s.
:CH<sub>3</sub>-CH=CH<sub>2</sub> + HI → CH<sub>3</sub>-CH'''I'''-CH<sub>2</sub>-'''H'''

If the two carbon atoms at the double bond are linked to a different number of hydrogen atoms, the halogen is found preferentially at the carbon with fewer hydrogen substituents ([[Markovnikov's rule]]).
The use of [[Free-radical addition|radical initiators]] or other chemicals can lead to the opposite product result, but the reactive-intermediate structures and mechanisms are different. [[Hydrobromic acid]] in particular is prone to forming radicals in the presence of various impurities or even atmospheric oxygen, leading to the reversal of the Markovnikov result:<ref>{{cite book |title= Introduction to Organic Chemistry |edition= 4th |first1= A. |last1= Streiwieser |authorlink1= Andrew Streitwieser |first2= C.H. |last2= Heathcock |authorlink2= Clayton Heathcock |first3= E.M. |last3= Kosower |publisher= Macmillan |location= New York |year= 1992 |chapter= 11.6.G. Alkenes: Reacttions: Free Radical Additions |page= 288 }}</ref>
:CH<sub>3</sub>-CH=CH<sub>2</sub> + HBr → CH<sub>3</sub>-CH'''H'''-CH<sub>2</sub>-'''Br'''

====Halohydrin formation====
Alkenes react with water and halogens to form [[halohydrin]]s by an addition reaction. [[Markovnikov's rule|Markovnikov regiochemistry]] and anti stereochemistry occur.

: CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub> + X<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> → XCH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>OH + HX

==== Oxidation ====
Alkenes are [[organic oxidation|oxidized]] with a large number of [[oxidizing agent]]s. In the presence of [[oxygen]], alkenes burn with a bright flame to produce [[carbon dioxide]] and water. [[Catalytic]] oxidation with oxygen or the reaction with [[Peroxy acid|percarboxylic acids]] yields [[epoxide]]s.
Reaction with ozone in [[ozonolysis]] leads to the breaking of the double bond, yielding two [[aldehyde]]s or [[ketone]]s. Reaction with concentrated, hot KMnO<sub>4</sub> (or other oxidizing salts) in an acidic solution will yield [[ketone]]s or [[carboxylic acid]]s.

:R<sub>1</sub>-CH=CH-R<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>3</sub> → R<sub>1</sub>-CHO + R<sub>2</sub>-CHO + H<sub>2</sub>O

This reaction can be used to determine the position of a double bond in an unknown alkene.

The oxidation can be stopped at the [[vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]] [[diol]] rather than full cleavage of the alkene by using milder (dilute,lower temperature) KMnO<sub>4</sub> or with [[osmium tetroxide]] or other oxidants.

==== Photooxygenation ====
In the presence of an appropriate [[photosensitiser]], such as [[methylene blue]] and light, alkenes can undergo reactions with reactive oxygen species generated by the photosensitiser, such as [[hydroxyl radical]]s, [[singlet oxygen]] or [[superoxide]] ion. These reactive [[photochemical]] intermediates are generated in what are known as Type I, Type II, and Type III processes, respectively.{{cn|date=October 2013}} These various alternative processes and reactions can be controlled by choice of specific reaction conditions, leading to a wide range of different products. A common example is the [4+2] [[cycloaddition]] of singlet oxygen with a [[diene]] such as [[cyclopentadiene]] to yield an [[endoperoxide]]:

[[File:4+2 cycloaddition cyclopentadiene O2.svg|350px|center|alt=Generation of singlet oxygen and it [4+2] cycloaddition with cyclopentadiene]]

Another example is the [[Ene reaction#Singlet-oxygen ene reaction|Schenck ene reaction]], in which singlet oxygen reacts with an [[allyl]]ic structure to give a transposed allyl [[peroxide]]:

[[File:Schenck ene reaction.svg|200px|center|alt=Reaction of singlet oxygen with an allyl structure to give allyl peroxide]]

===Polymerization===
{{main|polyolefin}}
[[Polymerization]] of alkenes is a reaction that yields [[polymer]]s of high industrial value at great economy, such as the plastics [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]]. Polymers from alkene [[monomer]]s are referred to in a general way as ''[[polyolefin]]s'' or in rare instances as ''polyalkenes''. A polymer from [[alpha-olefin]]s is called a polyalphaolefin (PAO). Polymerization can proceed via either a free-[[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] or an ionic mechanism, converting the double to a single bond and forming single bonds to join the other monomers. Polymerization of [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] [[diene]]s such as [[buta-1,3-diene]] or [[isoprene]] (2-methylbuta-1,3-diene) results in largely 1,4-addition with possibly some 1,2-addition of the diene monomer to a growing polymer chain.

===Metal complexation===
:[[Image:Ni(cod)2.png|thumb|right|220px|Structure of [[bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0)]], a metal–alkene complex]]
Alkenes can be [[ligand]]s in [[metal complex]]es. The two carbon centres bond to the metal using the C-C pi- and pi* orbitals. Mono- and diolefins are often used as ligands in stable complexes. [[Cyclooctadiene]] and [[norbornadiene]] are popular chelating agents, and even [[ethylene]] itself is sometimes used as a ligand, for example, in [[Zeise's salt]]. In addition, metal–alkene complexes are intermediates in many metal-catalyzed reactions including hydrogenation, hydroformylation, and polymerization.

==Synthesis==

===Industrial methods===
Alkenes are produced by hydrocarbon [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]]. Raw materials are mostly [[natural gas condensate]] components (principally ethane and propane) in the US and Mideast and [[naphtha]] in Europe and Asia. Alkanes are broken apart at high temperatures, often in the presence of a [[zeolite]] catalyst, to produce a mixture of primarily aliphatic alkenes and lower molecular weight alkanes. The mixture is feedstock and temperature dependent, and separated by fractional distillation. This is mainly used for the manufacture of small alkenes (up to six carbons).<ref name="Wade">{{cite book | last = Wade |  pages = 309 }}</ref>
[[Image:OctaneCracking.png|500px|center|Cracking of ''n''-octane to give pentane + propene]]

Related to this is catalytic [[dehydrogenation]], where an alkane loses hydrogen at high temperatures to produce a corresponding alkene.<ref name="Wade"/> This is the reverse of the [[catalytic hydrogenation]] of alkenes.
[[Image:ButaneDehydrogenation.png|600px|center|Dehydrogenation of butane to give butadiene and isomers of butene]]
This process is also known as reforming.  Both processes are endothermic and are driven towards the alkene at high temperatures by [[entropy]].

[[Catalytic]] synthesis of higher α-alkenes (of the type RCH=CH<sub>2</sub>) can also be achieved by a reaction of ethylene with the [[organometallic compound]] [[triethylaluminium]] in the presence of [[nickel]], [[cobalt]], or [[platinum]].

===Elimination reactions===
One of the principal methods for alkene synthesis in the laboratory is the [[elimination reaction|elimination]] of alkyl halides, alcohols, and similar compounds. Most common is the β-elimination via the E2 or E1 mechanism,<ref name="PataiBook1964">{{cite book | last = Saunders | first = W. H.  | editor = Patai, Saul | title = The Chemistry of Alkenes| publisher = Wiley Interscience | year = 1964 | pages = 149–150 }}</ref> but α-eliminations are also known.

The E2 mechanism provides a more reliable β-elimination method than E1 for most alkene syntheses. Most E2 eliminations start with an alkyl halide or alkyl sulfonate ester (such as a [[tosylate]] or [[triflate]]). When an alkyl halide is used, the reaction is called a [[dehydrohalogenation]]. For unsymmetrical products, the more substituted alkenes (those with fewer hydrogens attached to the C=C) tend to predominate (see [[Zaitsev's rule]]). Two common methods of elimination reactions are dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides and dehydration of alcohols. A typical example is shown below; note that if possible, the H is ''anti'' to the leaving group, even though this leads to the less stable Z-isomer.<ref name=Cram1956>{{cite journal

[[Image:E2EliminationExample.png|500px|center|An example of an E2 Elimination]]

Alkenes can be synthesized from alcohols via [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]], in which case water is lost via the E1 mechanism. For example, the dehydration of [[ethanol]] produces ethene:
:[[Ethanol|CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH]] + [[Sulfuric acid|H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]]  →  [[Ethene|H<sub>2</sub>C=CH<sub>2</sub>]] +  H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>

An alcohol may also be converted to a better leaving group (e.g., [[xanthate]]), so as to allow a milder ''syn''-elimination such as the [[Chugaev elimination]] and the [[Grieco elimination]]. Related reactions include eliminations by β-haloethers (the [[Boord olefin synthesis]]) and esters ([[ester pyrolysis]]).

Alkenes can be prepared indirectly from alkyl [[amine]]s. The amine or ammonia is not a suitable leaving group, so the amine is first either [[alkylation|alkylated]] (as in the [[Hofmann elimination]]) or oxidized to an [[amine oxide]] (the [[Cope reaction]]) to render a smooth elimination possible. The Cope reaction is a ''syn''-elimination that occurs at or below 150&nbsp;°C, for example:<ref name="CopeElimination1973">{{cite journal | author = Bach, R.D. | title=Mechanism of the Cope elimination | journal=J. Org. Chem. | year=1973| volume=38| pages=1742–3 | doi=10.1021/jo00949a029 | last2 = Andrzejewski | first2 = Denis | last3 = Dusold | first3 = Laurence R. | issue = 9 }}</ref>

[[Image:CopeEliminationExample.png|300px|center|Synthesis of cyclooctene via Cope elimination]]

The Hofmann elimination is unusual in that the ''less'' substituted (non-[[Saytzeff's rule|Saytseff]]) alkene is usually the major product.

Alkenes are generated from α-halo [[sulfone]]s in the [[Ramberg-Bäcklund reaction]], via a three-membered ring sulfone intermediate.

===Synthesis from carbonyl compounds===
Another important method for alkene synthesis involves construction of a new carbon–carbon double bond by coupling of a carbonyl compound (such as an [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]]) to a [[carbanion]] equivalent. Such reactions are sometimes called ''olefinations''. The most well-known of these methods is the [[Wittig reaction]], but other related methods are known.

The Wittig reaction involves reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a [[Wittig reagent]] (or phosphorane) of the type Ph<sub>3</sub>P=CHR to produce an alkene and [[Triphenylphosphine oxide|Ph<sub>3</sub>P=O]]. The Wittig reagent is itself prepared easily from [[triphenylphosphine]] and an alkyl halide. The reaction is quite general and many functional groups are tolerated, even esters, as in this example:<ref name="Snider2006">{{cite journal| last=Snider| first=Barry B. | title=Synthesis of ent-Thallusin | journal=Org. Lett.| year=2006| volume=8| pages=2123–6|doi=10.1021/ol0605777| pmid=16671797| last2=Matsuo| first2=Y| last3=Snider| first3=BB| issue=10| pmc=2518398 }}</ref>

[[Image:WittigReactionExample.png|350px|center|A typical example of the Wittig reaction]]

Related to the Wittig reaction is the [[Peterson olefination]]. This uses a less accessible silicon-based reagent in place of the phosphorane, but it allows for the selection of E or Z products. If an E-product is desired, another alternative is the [[Julia olefination]], which uses the carbanion generated from a [[phenyl]] [[sulfone]]. The [[Takai olefination]] based on an organochromium intermediate also delivers E-products. A titanium compound, [[Tebbe's reagent]], is useful for the synthesis of methylene compounds; in this case, even esters and amides react.

A pair of carbonyl compounds can also be reductively coupled together (with reduction) to generate an alkene. Symmetrical alkenes can be prepared from a single aldehyde or ketone coupling with itself, using Ti metal reduction (the [[McMurry reaction]]). If two different ketones are to be coupled, a more complex, indirect method such as the [[Barton–Kellogg reaction]] may be used.

A single ketone can also be converted to the corresponding alkene via its tosylhydrazone, using [[sodium methoxide]] (the [[Bamford–Stevens reaction]]) or an alkyllithium (the [[Shapiro reaction]]).

===Synthesis from alkenes: olefin metathesis and hydrovinylation===
{{main|Olefin metathesis}}
Alkenes can be prepared by exchange with other alkenes, in a reaction known as [[olefin metathesis]]. Frequently, loss of ethene gas is used to drive the reaction towards a desired product. In many cases, a mixture of geometric isomers is obtained, but the reaction tolerates many functional groups. The method is particularly effective for the preparation of cyclic alkenes, as in this synthesis of [[muscone]]:
[[Image:MusconeViaRCM.png|500px|center|Ring-closing metathesis used in synthesis of muscone]]

Transition metal catalyzed hydrovinylation is another important alkene synthesis process starting from alkene itself.<ref name=Vogt2010>{{cite journal  | author = Vogt, D.  | year = 2010  | pages = 7166–8  | title = Cobalt-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrovinylation  | issue = 40  | pmid = 20672269  | journal = Angew.

The hydrovinylation reaction was first reported by Alderson, Jenner, and Lindsey by using rhodium and ruthenium salts, other metal catalysts commonly employed nowadays included iron, cobalt, nickel, and palladium. The addition can be done highly regio- and stereo-selectively, the choices of metal centers, ligands, substrates and counterions often play very important role.<ref name=Vogt2006 >{{cite journal  | author = Grutters, M.

===From alkynes===
Reduction of [[alkyne]]s is a useful method for the [[stereoselectivity|stereoselective]] synthesis of disubstituted alkenes. If the ''cis''-alkene is desired, [[hydrogenation]] in the presence of [[Lindlar's catalyst]] (a heterogeneous catalyst that consists of palladium deposited on calcium carbonate and treated with various forms of lead) is commonly used, though hydroboration followed by hydrolysis provides an alternative approach. Reduction of the alkyne by [[sodium]] metal in liquid [[ammonia]] gives the ''trans''-alkene.<ref name="ZweifelNantz">{{cite book | last = Zweifel | first = George S. | coauthors = Nantz, Michael H.| title = Modern Organic Synthesis: An Introduction  |  publisher = W.

[[Image:AlkyneToAlkene.png|600px|center|Synthesis of ''cis''- and ''trans''-alkenes from alkynes]]

For the preparation multisubstituted alkenes, [[carbometalation]] of alkynes can give rise to a large variety of alkene derivatives.

===Rearrangements and related reactions===
Alkenes can be synthesized from other alkenes via [[rearrangement reaction]]s. Besides [[olefin metathesis]] (described [[#Olefin metathesis|above]]), a large number of [[pericyclic reaction]]s can be used such as the [[ene reaction]] and the [[Cope rearrangement]].

In the [[Diels-Alder reaction]], a [[cyclohexene]] derivative is prepared from a diene and a reactive or electron-deficient alkene.

==Nomenclature==

===IUPAC names===
To form the root of the [[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC]] names for alkenes, simply change the -an- infix of the parent to -en-. For example, '''CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>''' is the [[alkane]] ''ethANe''. The name of '''CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub>''' is therefore ''ethENe''.

In higher alkenes, where [[isomers]] exist that differ in location of the double bond, the following numbering system is used:
# Number the longest carbon chain that contains the double bond in the direction that gives the carbon atoms of the double bond the lowest possible numbers.
# Indicate the location of the double bond by the location of its first carbon.
# Name branched or substituted alkenes in a manner similar to [[alkane]]s.
# Number the carbon atoms, locate and name substituent groups, locate the double bond, and name the main chain.

===Cis-trans notation===
{{main|Cis-trans isomerism}}
In the specific case of disubstituted alkenes where the two carbons have one substituent each, [[Cis-trans isomerism|Cis-trans]] notation may be used. If both substituents are on the same side of the bond, it is defined as (cis-). If the substituents are on either side of the bond, it is defined as (trans-).

===E,Z notation===
{{main|E-Z notation}}
When an alkene has more than one substituent (especially necessary with 3 or 4 substituents), the double bond geometry is described using the labels ''E'' and ''Z''. These labels come from the German words "entgegen," meaning "opposite," and "zusammen," meaning "together." Alkenes with the higher priority groups (as determined by [[Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rule|CIP rules]]) on the same side of the double bond have these groups together and are designated ''Z''. Alkenes with the higher priority groups on opposite sides are designated ''E''. A mnemonic to remember this:  Z notation has the higher priority groups on "ze zame zide."

===Groups containing C=C double bonds===
IUPAC recognizes two names for hydrocarbon groups containing carbon–carbon double bonds, the [[vinyl]] group and the [[allyl]] group. .<ref name="PAC1995"/>
