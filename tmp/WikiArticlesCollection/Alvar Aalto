'''Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto''' (3 February 1898 – 11 May 1976) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[architect]] and [[designer]], as well as a [[sculptor]] and [[painter]].<ref name=Chilvers>Chilvers, Ian (2004)</ref> His work includes [[architecture]], [[furniture]], [[textiles]] and [[glassware]]. Aalto's early career runs in parallel with the rapid economic growth and industrialization of Finland during the first half of the twentieth century and many of his clients were industrialists; among these were the [[Ahlström-Gullichsen family]].<ref name="Ahlström">architect.architecture.sk (2013)</ref> The span of his career, from the 1920s to the 1970s, is reflected in the styles of his work, ranging from [[Nordic Classicism]] of the early work, to a rational [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] Modernism during the 1930s to a more organic modernist style from the 1940s onwards. What is typical for his entire career, however, is a concern for design as a [[Gesamtkunstwerk]], a ''total work of art''; whereby he – together with his first wife [[Aino Aalto]] – would design not just the building, but give special treatments to the interior surfaces and design furniture, lamps, and furnishings and glassware. The Alvar Aalto Museum, designed by Aalto himself, is located in what is regarded as his home city [[Jyväskylä]].<ref>www.alvaraalto.fi/ (2011)</ref>

Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto  was born in [[Kuortane]], [[Finland]].<ref>Thorne, John (1984)</ref> His father, Johan Henrik Aalto, was a Finnish-speaking land-surveyor and his mother, Selly (Selma) Matilda (née Hackstedt) was a Swedish-speaking postmistress. When Aalto was 5 years old, the family moved to [[Alajärvi]], and from there to [[Jyväskylä]] in [[Central Finland]]. Aalto studied at the Jyväskylä Lyceum school, completing his basic education in 1916. In 1916 he then enrolled to study architecture at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]]. His studies were interrupted by the [[Finnish War of Liberation]], which he fought in. He fought on the side of the ''[[White Guard (Finland)|White Army]]'' and fought at the [[Batttle of Lankiphja]] and the [[Battle of Tampere]].<ref>Pelkonen, Eeva-Liisa (2009); p. 12</ref> He built his first piece while still a student, a house for his parents, at [[Alajärvi]].<ref name=Labo1>Labò, Mario (1968); p. 1</ref> Afterwards, he continued his education, graduating in 1921.<ref name=EB>Hoiberg, Dale H. (2010)</ref>

After graduating, Alvar toured Sweden and Western Europe for two years, and for a period of time worked at the Office of Projects in [[Göteborg]], [[Sweden]].<ref name=Labo1/> In 1922, he accomplisehd his first independent piece at the Industrial Exposition in [[Tampere]].<ref name=Labo1/> In 1923 he returned to [[Jyväskylä]], where he opened his first architectural office.<ref name=Brown>Brown, Theodore S. (1969)</ref> Jyväskylä would become a notable city for his architecture, with more buildings designed by him than in any other city.<ref>www.infoa (2013)</ref>{{citation broken|date=November 2013}} In 1925, he married architect [[Aino Aalto|Aino Marsio]].<ref name=EB/> Their honeymoon journey to [[Italy]] sealed an intellectual bond with the culture of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] region that was to remain important to Aalto for the rest of his life. The Aaltos moved their office to [[Turku]] in 1927, and started collaborating with architect [[Erik Bryggman]]. The office moved again in 1933 to Helsinki.<ref name=Brown/>

The Aaltos designed and built a joint house-office (1935–36) for themselves in [[Munkkiniemi]], Helsinki, but later (1954–56) had a purpose-built office built in the same neighbourhood - the latter building nowadays houses the Alvar Aalto Academy. Aino and Alvar Aalto had 2 children, a daughter Johanna "Hanni" Alanen, born Aalto, 1925, and a son Hamilkar Aalto, 1928. In 1926 the young Aaltos designed and had built a summer cottage in Alajärvi, Villa Flora. In 1938, he visited the [[United States]].<ref name=Brown/> Aino Aalto died of cancer in 1949. In 1952 Aalto married architect [[Elissa Mäkiniemi]] (died 1994), who had been working as an assistant in his office. In 1952 Aalto designed and had built a summer cottage, the so-called Experimental House, for himself and his new wife in Muuratsalo in Central Finland. Alvar Aalto died on 11 May 1976, in [[Helsinki]].<ref name=EB/>

===Career===
====Early career: classicism====

Although he is sometimes regarded as among the first and most influential architects of Nordic [[modernism]], a closer examination of the historical facts reveals that Aalto (while a pioneer in Finland) closely followed and had personal contacts with other pioneers in Sweden, in particular [[Gunnar Asplund]] and [[Sven Markelius]]. What they and many others of that generation in the Nordic countries had in common was that they started off from a classical education and were first designing in the so-called [[Nordic Classicism]] style – a style that had been a reaction to the previous dominant style of [[National romantic style|National Romanticism]]– before moving, in the late 1920s, towards Modernism. On returning to Jyväskylä in 1923 to establish his own architect's office, Aalto busied himself with a number of single-family homes, all designed in the classical style, such as the manor-like house for his mother's cousin Terho Manner in Töysa in 1923, a summer villa for the Jyväskylä chief constable in 1923 and the Alatalo farmhouse in Tarvaala in 1924. During this period he also completed his first public buildings, the Jyväskylä Workers' Club in 1925, the Jyväskylä Defence Corps building in 1926 and the Seinajoki Defence Corp building in 1924-29. Aalto also entered several architectural competitions for prestigious state public buildings, both in Finland and abroad, including the two competitions for the Finnish Parliamentary building in 1923 and 1924, the extension to the [[University of Helsinki]] in 1931, and the building to house the [[League of Nations]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, in 1926-27. Furthermore, this was the period when Aalto was most prolific in his writings, with articles for professional journals and newspapers. Among his most well-known essays from this period are "Urban culture" 1924), "Temple baths on Jyväskylä ridge" (1925), "Abbé Coignard's sermon" (1925), and "From doorstep to living room" (1926).<ref>Aalto, Alvar (1998)</ref>

====Early career: functionalism====
The shift in Aalto's design approach from classicism to modernism is epitomised by the [[Vyborg Library|Viipuri Library]] (1927–35), which went through a transformation from an originally classical competition entry proposal to the completed high-modernist building. Yet his humanistic approach is in full evidence in the library: the interior displays natural materials, warm colours, and undulating lines. Due to problems over financing and a change of site, the Viipuri Library project lasted eight years, and during that same time he also designed the Turun Sanomat Building (1929–30){{refn | group = nb | The Turun Sanomat building heralded Aalto's entrance onto the international field as an architect.<ref name=Brown/>}} and Paimio Sanatorium (1929–32). Thus, the Turun Sanomat Building first heralded Aalto's move towards modernism, and this was then carried forward both in the Paimio Sanatorium and in the on-going design for the library. Although the Turun Sanomat Building and Paimio Sanatorium are comparatively pure modernist works, they too carried the seeds of his questioning of such an orthodox modernist approach and a move to a more daring, synthetic attitude. It has been said that his work on two of these three buildings (not the Viipuri Library) showed similarities to [[Walter Gropius]]' style, in particular his work on the [[Bauhaus_school#Dessau|Bauhaus school of design]] in [[Dessau]].<ref name=EB/> His work on the Viipuri building started to show his individuality in a departure from the European norms.

During the 20's he also focused a lot of his energy on his furniture designs, in particular his bent plywood chairs that were distributed and manufactured by [[Artek (company)|Artek]], starting in 1935.<ref name= Brown/>

Through Sven Markelius, Aalto became a member of the [[Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM), attending the second congress in Frankfurt in 1929 and the fourth congress in Athens in 1933, where he established a close friendship with [[László Moholy-Nagy]], [[Sigfried Giedion]] and [[Philip Morton Shand]]. It was during this time that he followed closely the work of the main driving force behind the new modernism, [[Le Corbusier]], and visited him in his Paris office several times in the following years.

It was not until the completion of the Paimio Sanatorium (1932) and Viipuri Library (1935) that Aalto first achieved world attention in architecture. His reputation grew in the USA following the critical reception of his design for the Finnish Pavilion at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], described by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] as a "work of genius". It could be said that Aalto's international reputation was sealed with his inclusion in the second edition of Sigfried Giedion's influential book on Modernist architecture, ''Space, Time and Architecture: The growth of a new tradition'' (1949), in which Aalto received more attention than any other Modernist architect, including [[Le Corbusier]]. In his analysis of Aalto, Giedion gave primacy to qualities that depart from direct functionality, such as mood, atmosphere, intensity of life and even national characteristics, declaring that "Finland is with Aalto wherever he goes".

In 1938, the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in [[New York]] organized an exhibit that eventually went on a 12-city tour. Afterwards he visited [[United States|America]] for the first time and gave a series of lectures at [[Yale]].<ref name=Labo1/>

====Mid career: experimentation====
During the 30's Alvar spent a lot of time experimenting with laminated wood, making sculptures, and abstract reliefs, characterized by irregular curved forms. Utilizing this knowledge he was able to solve technical problems concerning the flexibility of wood and also of working out spatial issues in his designs.<ref name=Chilvers/> Aalto's early experiments with wood and his move away from a purist modernism would be tested in built form with the commission to design Villa Mairea (1939) in [[Noormarkku]], the luxury home of the young industrialist couple [[Harry Gullichsen|Harry]] and [[Maire Gullichsen]]. It was Maire Gullichsen who acted as the main client, and she worked closely not only with Alvar but also Aino Aalto on the design, inspiring them to be more daring in their work. The original design was to include a private art gallery, but this was never built. The building forms a U-shape around a central inner "garden" the central feature of which is a kidney-shaped swimming pool. Adjacent to the pool is a sauna executed in a rustic style, alluding to both Finnish and Japanese precedents. The design of the house is a synthesis of numerous stylistic influences, from traditional Finnish vernacular to purist modernism, as well as influences from English and Japanese architecture. While the house is clearly intended for a wealthy family, Aalto nevertheless argued that it was also an experiment that would prove useful in the design of mass housing.<ref>Pallasmaa, Juhani (2005)</ref> It created zones for different activities within the structure.<ref name=Brown/>

His increased fame led to offers and commissions outside Finland. In 1941 he accepted an invitation as a visiting professor to [[MIT]],<ref name=Brown/> in the USA. This was during the [[World War II|Second World War]], and he involved his students in designing low-cost, small-scale housing for the reconstruction of war-torn Finland. While teaching at MIT, Aalto also designed the student dormitory, [[List of MIT undergraduate dormitories#Baker House|Baker House]], completed in 1948. The dormitory lay along the [[Charles River]] and its undulating form provided maximum view and ventilation for each resident.<ref name=Brown/> This building was the first building of Aalto's redbrick period. Originally used in Baker House to signify the Ivy League university tradition, on his return to Finland Aalto used it in a number of key buildings, in particular, in several of the buildings in the new [[Helsinki University of Technology]] campus (starting in 1950), [[Säynätsalo Town Hall]] (1952), Helsinki Pensions Institute (1954), [[Kulttuuritalo|Helsinki House of Culture]] (1958), as well as in his own summer house, the so-called Experimental House in Muuratsalo (1957).

In the 50's he immersed himself in his sculpting, be it with bronze, marble, or mixed media. This paid off as he produced an outstanding piece for the memorial of the [[Battle of Suomussalmi]] (1960), located on the battlefield. It consists of a leaning bronze pillrr on a pedestal.<ref name=Chilvers/>

====Mature career: monumentalism====
The early 1960s and 1970s (up until his death in 1976) were marked by key works in Helsinki, in particular the huge town plan for the void in centre of Helsinki adjacent to [[Töölö]] Bay and the vast [[VR warehouses|railway yards]], and marked on the edges by significant buildings such as the National Museum and the main railway station, both by [[Eliel Saarinen]]. In his town plan Aalto proposed a line of separate marble-clad buildings fronting the bay which would house various cultural institutions, including a concert hall, opera, museum of architecture and headquarters for the [[Finnish Academy]]. The scheme also extended into the [[Kamppi]] district with a series of tall office blocks. Aalto first presented his scheme in 1961, but it went through various modifications during the early 1960s. Only two fragments of the overall plan were ever realized: the [[Finlandia Hall]] concert hall (1976) fronting Töölö Bay, and an office building in the Kamppi district for the Helsinki Electricity Company (1975). The [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Miesian]] formal language of geometric grids employed in the buildings was also used by Aalto for other sites in Helsinki, including the [[Stora Enso|Enso-Gutzeit]] building (1962), the [[Stockmann|Academic Bookstore]] (1962) and the SYP Bank building (1969).

Following Aalto's death in 1976 his office continued to operate under the direction of his widow, Elissa, completing works already to some extent designed. These works include the Jyväskylä City Theatre and [[Aalto Theatre|Essen opera house]]. Since the death of Elissa Aalto the office has continued to operate as the Alvar Aalto Academy, giving advice on the restoration of Aalto buildings and organising the vast archive material.

==Awards==
Aalto's awards included the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture from the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (1957) and the [[AIA Gold Medal|Gold Medal]] from the [[American Institute of Architects]] (1963). He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1957.<ref name=AAAS>Tourney, Michele (2013)</ref> He also was a member of the [[Academy of Finland]], and was its president from 1963 to 1968. From 1925 to 1956 he was a member of the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]].<ref name=EB/>

==Works==
Aalto's career spans the changes in style from ([[Nordic Classicism]]) to purist [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] Modernism to a more personal, synthetic and idiosyncratic Modernism. Aalto's wide field of design activity ranges from the large scale of [[city planning]] and [[architecture]] to [[interior design]], [[furniture]] and [[glassware]] design and [[painting]]. It has been estimated that during his entire career Aalto designed over 500 individual buildings, approximately 300 of which were built, the vast majority of which are in Finland. He also has a few buildings in France, Germany, Italy and the USA.<ref>Schildt, Göran (1994)</ref>

Aalto's work with wood, was influenced by early Scandinavian architects; however, his experiments and departure from the norm brought attention to his ability to make wood do things not previously done. His techniques in the say he cut the [[beech]] tree, for example, and also his ability to use plywood as structural and aesthetic. Other examples include the rough-hewn vertical placement of logs at his pavilion at the [[Lapua]] expo, looking similar to a medieval barricade, at the orchestra platform at [[turku]] and the [[Paris]] expo at the World Fair, he used varying sizes and shapes of planks. Also at Paris and at [[Villa Mairea]] he utilized birch boarding in a vertical arrangement. Also his famous undulating walls and ceilings made of red pine. <ref name=Labo2>Labò, Mario (1968); p. 2</ref> In his roofing, he created massive spans (155 foot at the covered statium at [[Otaniemi]]) all without tie rods. His stairway at Villa Mairea, he evokes feelings of a natural forest by binding beech wood with withes into columns.<ref name=Labo3>Labò, Mario (1968); p. 3</ref>

Aalto claimed that his paintings were not made as individual artworks but as part of his process of architectural design, and many of his small-scale "sculptural" experiments with wood led to later larger architectural details and forms. These experiments also led to a number of patents: for example, he invented a new form of laminated bent-plywood furniture in 1932.{{refn |group =nb|The patent is dated 1933.<ref name=Chilvers/>}} His experimental method had been influenced by his meetings with various members of the [[Bauhaus]] design school, especially [[László Moholy-Nagy]], whom he first met in 1930. Aalto's furniture was exhibited in London in 1935, to great critical acclaim, and to cope with the consumer demand Aalto, together with his wife Aino, [[Maire Gullichsen]] and Nils-Gustav Hahl founded the company [[Artek (company)|Artek]] that same year. Aalto glassware (Aino as well as Alvar) is manufactured by [[Iittala]]. Aalto was one of the first architects outside of [[Germany]], [[France]], and [[Holland]] to master modern architecture.<ref name=Brown/>

Aalto's 'High Stool' and 'Stool E60' (manufactured by [[Artek (company)|Artek]]) are currently used in [[Apple Store|Apple stores]] across the world to serve as seating for customers. Finished in black lacquer, the stools are used to seat customers at the 'Genius Bar' and also in other areas of the store at times when seating is required for a product workshop or special event.

Aalto was influential in bringing [[modern art]] to the Finnish people, in particular the work of his friends, [[Alexander Milne Calder]] and [[Fernand Léger]].<ref name=Chilvers/>
