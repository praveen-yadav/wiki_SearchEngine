'''Abbas Mirza ''' (عباس میرزا in [[Persian language|Persian]]) born in [[Nava, Iran|Nava]] village of [[Mazandaran]] (September of 1789 – October 25, 1833),<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|title=Abbas Mirza |edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location= Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=10}}</ref> was a [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] [[crown prince]] of [[Iran|Persia]]. He developed a reputation as a military commander during wars with Russia and the [[Ottoman Empire]],<ref>[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 1</ref> as an early modernizer of [[Persia]]'s armed forces and institutions, and for his death before his father, [[Fath Ali Shah]]. Abbas was an intelligent prince, possessed some literary taste, and is noteworthy on account of the comparative simplicity of his life.

==Biography==
He was a younger son of [[Fath Ali Shah]], but on account of his mother's royal birth was destined by his father to succeed him. Entrusted with the government of the [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] region of [[Persia]],<ref name=EB/> he sought to rule it in European fashion, and employed officers to reorganize his army. He was soon at war with Russia ([[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)]]), and his aid was eagerly solicited by both England and [[Napoleon]], anxious to checkmate one another in the East. Preferring the friendship of France, Abbas Mirza continued the war against Russia's [[General Kotlyarevsky]], but his new ally could give him very little assistance. Kotlyarevsky defeated the numerically superior (30,000)<ref name=BE>{{cite web |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dUHhTPdJ6yIC&pg=PT424&lpg=PT424&dq=%E2%80%9DAbbas+Mirza%E2%80%9C+Kotlyarevsky+30000&source=bl&ots=LrR7L44GI9&sig=gQTWKgaHT6VCH-zNKZovbOc8xqo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=aQAiUpaVGsqu7AbcxYD4Dw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9DAbbas%20Mirza%E2%80%9C%20Kotlyarevsky%2030000&f=false |title=''Iran at War'' | first=Kaveh | last=Farrokh |publisher=Osprey Publishing |accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> Persian army in the [[Battle of Aslanduz]] and in October, 1813, Persia was compelled to make a disadvantageous peace, ceding some territory in the [[Caucasus]] (present-day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Dagestan]], and most of the what most recently became the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]).

These losses forced Abbas to rethink his strategy, and he started sending his students to Europe for military training. In 1811 and 1815, two groups were sent to Britain, and in 1812 a printing press was established in [[Tabriz]] to reprint European military handbooks. Tabriz also saw a gunpowder factory and a munitions depot.<ref name=EB/> The training continued with constant drilling by British advisers.

He gained some victories during the [[Ottoman–Persian War (1821–1823)]], resulting in a peace treaty signed in 1823 after the [[Battle of Erzurum (1821)|Battle of Erzurum]]. The war was a victory for Persia, especially considering they were outnumbered, and this gave much needed confidence to his forces. His [[Russo-Persian War, 1826-1828|second war with Russia]], which began in 1826, started off on a good note as he won back most of the territory lost in the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)]]; however it ended in a string of costly defeats after which Persia was forced to cede nearly all of its [[Armenia]]n territories and [[Nakhichevan Khanate|Nakhchivan]]. The losses affected Abbas Mirza severely and his health began to suffer. He also lost enthusiasm for any more military reform.<ref name=EB/> In 1833, he sought to restore order in the province of [[Khorasan (Province)|Khorasan]], which was nominally under Persian supremacy, and while engaged in the task died at [[Mashhad]] in 1833. In 1834 his eldest son, [[Mohammed Mirza]], succeeded [[Fath Ali Shah]] as the next king.  R. G. Watson (History of Persia, 128-9) describes him as “the noblest of the Qajar race”.<ref>Lockhart, L. "Abbas Mirza." Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E. Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2007</ref>

He is most remembered for his valor in battle and his failed attempts to modernize the Persian army. He was not successful in part due to the lack of government centralization in Iran during the era. Furthermore, it was Abbas Mirza who first dispatched Iranian students to Europe for a western education.<ref>[[Patrick Clawson]] and [[Michael Rubin (historian)|Michael Rubin]]. ''Eternal Iran''.
