Individuals with Down syndrome have a higher risk for many conditions. The medical consequences of the extra genetic material in Down syndrome are highly variable, may affect the function of any organ system or bodily process, and can contribute to a shorter life expectancy for people with Down syndrome. Following improvements to medical care, particularly with heart problems, the life expectancy among persons with Down syndrome has increased from 12 years in 1912, to 60 years.<ref name="Urbano2010108">{{cite book|author=Richard Urbano|title=Health Issues Among Persons With Down Syndrome|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QbHL8qrgfCoC&pg=PA100|accessdate=10 April 2012|date=9 September 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-374477-7|page=108}}</ref> The causes of death have also changed, with chronic [[neurodegenerative diseases]] becoming more common as the population ages. Most people with Down syndrome who live into their 40s and 50s begin to suffer from dementia like [[Alzheimer's|Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>{{cite book |author=McPhee, J; Tierney, Lawrence M; Papadakis, Maxine A |title=Current medical diagnosis & treatment 1999|publisher=Appleton & Lange |location=Norwalk, CT |year=1999 |isbn=0-8385-1550-9 |page=1546}}</ref>

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], among other health organizations, has issued a series of recommendations for [[screening (medicine)|screening]] individuals with Down syndrome for particular diseases.<ref name=AAP>{{cite journal | author = American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Genetics | year = 2001 | title = Health Supervision for Children With Down Syndrome. | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 107 | issue = 2| pages = 442–49 | url= http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;107/2/442 | accessdate=13 August 2006 }}</ref>

===Neurological effects===
Most individuals with Down syndrome have [[intellectual disability]] in the mild ([[IQ]] 50–70) to moderate (IQ 35–50) range,<ref name="Healthsupervision">{{cite journal |author=American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Genetics |title=American Academy of Pediatrics: Health supervision for children with Down syndrome |journal=Pediatrics |year=2001 |month=February |volume=107 |issue=2 |pages=442–49 |pmid=11158488 |doi=10.1542/peds.107.2.442}}</ref> with individuals having [[Mosaic (genetics)|Mosaic]] Down syndrome typically 10–30 points higher.<ref>{{cite web |author=Strom, C |url=http://www.mosaicdownsyndrome.com/faqs.htm |title=FAQ from Mosaic Down Syndrome Society |accessdate = 2006-06-03}}</ref> The methodology of the IQ tests has been criticised for not taking into account accompanying physical disabilities, such as hearing and vision impairment, that would slow performance.<ref name="Borthwick">Borthwick, C. (1996). Racism, IQ and Down's Syndrome. In Disability & Society, Vol 11, No. 3, 1996, pp.&nbsp;403–410</ref>

Language skills show a difference between understanding speech and expressing speech, and commonly individuals with Down syndrome have a [[speech delay]].<ref name="kumin30">{{cite journal| author =Bird, G; Thomas, S| year =2002| title = Providing effective speech and language therapy for children with Down syndrome in mainstream settings: A case example |journal =Down Syndrome News and Update |volume =2 |issue =1 |pages =30–31}} Also, {{cite book |last =Kumin |first=Libby |editor=Hassold, TJ; Patterson, D| title =Down Syndrome: A Promising Future, Together |year =1998 |publisher =Wiley-Liss |location =New York |chapter = Comprehensive speech and language treatment for infants, toddlers, and children with Down syndrome}}</ref> [[Fine motor skill]]s are delayed<ref>{{cite web |title=Development of Fine Motor Skills in Down Syndrome |url=http://www.about-down-syndrome.com/fine-motor-skills-in-down-syndrome.html |accessdate = 2006-07-03}}</ref> and often lag behind [[gross motor skill]]s and can interfere with cognitive development. Effects of the condition on the development of gross motor skills are quite variable. Some children will begin walking at around 2 years of age, while others will not walk until age four. Physical therapy, and/or participation in a program of adapted physical education (APE), may promote enhanced development of gross motor skills in Down syndrome children.<ref>{{cite web |author = Bruni M|url=http://www.ds-health.com/occther.htm |title=Occupational Therapy and the Child with Down Syndrome |accessdate = 2006-06-02}}</ref>

===Congenital heart disease===
The [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of [[congenital heart disease]] in newborn babies with Down syndrome is up to 50%.<ref name="Urbano2010169" /> An [[atrioventricular septal defect]] also known as [[endocardial cushion]] defect is the most common form with up to 40% of patients affected. This is closely followed by [[ventricular septal defect]] that affects approximately 35% of patients.<ref name="Urbano2010169">{{cite book|author=Richard Urbano|title=Health Issues Among Persons With Down Syndrome|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QbHL8qrgfCoC&pg=PA100|accessdate=10 April 2012|date=9 September 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-374477-7|page=169}}</ref>

===Cancer===
Although the general incidence of cancer amongst individuals with Down syndrome is the same as in the general population,<ref name="Urbano2010129">{{cite book|author=Richard Urbano|title=Health Issues Among Persons With Down Syndrome|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QbHL8qrgfCoC&pg=PA100|accessdate=10 April 2012|date=9 September 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-374477-7|page=129}}</ref> there are greatly reduced incidences of many common malignancies except leukemia and testicular cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yang, Q; Rasmussen, SA; Friedman, JM |title=Mortality associated with Down's syndrome in the USA from 1983 to 1997: a population-based study |journal=Lancet |volume=359 |issue=9311 |pages=1019–25 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=11937181|url=http://www.ds-health.com/abst/a0205.htm |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08092-3}}</ref> People with Down syndrome also have a much lower risk of [[atherosclerosis|hardening of the arteries]] and [[diabetic retinopathy]].<ref name="autogenerated2"/>

Hematologic malignancies such as leukemia are more common in children with DS.<ref name="Urbano2010131">{{cite book|author=Richard Urbano|title=Health Issues Among Persons With Down Syndrome|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QbHL8qrgfCoC&pg=PA100|accessdate=10 April 2012|date=9 September 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-374477-7|page=131}}</ref> In particular, [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] is at least 10 times more common in DS and the [[megakaryoblastic]] form of [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] is at least 50 times more common in DS. Transient leukemia is a form of leukemia that is rare in individuals without DS but affects up to 20 percent of newborns with DS.<ref name="Urbano2010138">{{cite book|author=Richard Urbano|title=Health Issues Among Persons With Down Syndrome|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QbHL8qrgfCoC&pg=PA100|accessdate=10 April 2012|date=9 September 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-374477-7|page=138}}</ref> This form of leukemia is typically benign and resolves on its own over several months, though it can lead to other serious illnesses.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zipursky | first1 = A | title = Transient leukaemia--a benign form of leukaemia in newborn infants with trisomy 21 | journal = British journal of haematology | volume = 120 | issue = 6 | pages = 930–38 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12648061 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04229.x }}</ref> In contrast to hematologic malignancies, solid tumor malignancies are less common in DS, possibly due to increased numbers of [[tumor suppressor gene]]s contained in the extra genetic material.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hasle | first1 = H | last2 = Clemmensen | first2 = IH | last3 = Mikkelsen | first3 = M | title = Risks of leukaemia and solid tumours in individuals with Down's syndrome | journal = Lancet | volume = 355 | issue = 9199 | pages = 165–69 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10675114 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(99)05264-2 }}</ref>

===Thyroid disorders===
Individuals with DS are at increased risk for dysfunction of the [[thyroid gland]], an organ that helps control [[metabolism]]. Low thyroid ([[hypothyroidism]]) is most common, occurring in almost a third of those with DS. This can be due to absence of the thyroid at birth ([[congenital hypothyroidism]]) or due to attack on the thyroid by the [[immune system]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Karlsson | first1 = B| last2 = Gustafsson | first2 = J | last3 = Hedov | first3 = G | last4 = Ivarsson | first4 = SA | last5 = Annerén | first5 = G | title = Thyroid dysfunction in Down's syndrome: relation to age and thyroid autoimmunity | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 79 |issue = 3 | pages = 242–45 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9875020 | pmc = 1717691 | doi = 10.1136/adc.79.3.242 }}</ref>

===Gastrointestinal===
Down syndrome increases the risk of [[Hirschsprung's disease]], in which the nerve cells that control the function of parts of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] are not present.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ikeda | first1 = K | last2 = Goto | first2 = S | title = Additional anomalies in Hirschsprung's disease: an analysis based on the nationwide survey in Japan | journal = Zeitschrift fur Kinderchirurgie : organ der Deutschen, der Schweizerischen und der Osterreichischen Gesellschaft fur Kinderchirurgie = Surgery in infancy and childhood | volume = 41 |issue = 5 | pages = 279–81 | year = 1986 | pmid = 2947399 | doi = 10.1055/s-2008-1043359 }}</ref> This results in severe constipation. Other congenital anomalies occurring more frequently in DS include [[duodenal atresia]], [[annular pancreas]], and [[imperforate anus]]. [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease]] and [[celiac disease]] are also more common among people with DS.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zachor |first1 = DA | last2 = Mroczek-Musulman | first2 = E | last3 = Brown | first3 = P | title = Prevalence of celiac disease in Down syndrome in the United States | journal = Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 275–79 | year = 2000 |pmid = 10997372 | doi = 10.1097/00005176-200009000-00014 }}</ref>

===Infertility===
Males with Down syndrome usually cannot father children, while females demonstrate significantly lower rates of conception relative to unaffected individuals.<ref name="fertility" /> Women with DS are less fertile and often have difficulties with [[miscarriage]], [[premature birth]], and difficult [[Childbirth|labor]]. Without [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]], approximately half of the offspring of someone with Down syndrome also have the syndrome themselves.<ref name="fertility">{{cite journal |author=Hsiang, YH; Berkovitz, GD; Bland, GL; Migeon, CJ; Warren, AC |title=Gonadal function in patients with Down syndrome |journal=Am.

===Eye disorders===
[[File:Brushfield eye crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Brushfield spots, visible in the irises of a baby with Down Syndrome.]]
Eye disorders are more common in people with DS. Almost half have [[strabismus]], in which the two eyes do not move in tandem. [[Refractive errors]] requiring glasses or contacts are also common. [[Cataract]]s (opacity of the lens), [[keratoconus]] (thin, cone-shaped corneas), and [[glaucoma]] (increased eye pressures) are also more common in DS.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Caputo | first1 = AR | last2 = Wagner |first2 = RS | last3 = Reynolds | first3 = DR | last4 = Guo | first4 = SQ | last5 = Goel | first5 = AK | title = Down syndrome.

The elevated occurrence of hearing loss in individuals with Down syndrome is not surprising. Every component in the auditory system is potentially adversely affected by Down syndrome.<ref name="Porter" />

[[Otitis media with effusion]] is the most common cause of hearing loss in Down children;<ref name="Sheehan" /> the infections start at birth and continue throughout the children's lives.<ref name="Shott">{{cite journal | author = Shott SR, Joseph A, Heithaus D | year = 2001 | month = Dec | title = Hearing loss in children with Down syndrome | url = | journal = International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology. | volume = 61 | issue = 3| pages = 199–205 }}</ref> The ear infections are mainly associated with [[Eustachian tube]] dysfunction due to alterations in the skull base.

Early intervention to treat the hearing loss and adapted education are useful to facilitate the development of children with Down syndrome, especially during the preschool period. For adults, social independence depends largely on the ability to complete tasks without assistance, the willingness to separate emotionally from parents and access to personal recreational activities.<ref name="Weijerman" /> Given this background it is always important to rule out hearing loss as a contributing factor in social and mental deterioration.<ref name="Porter" />

===Other complications===
Instability of the [[atlanto-axial joint]] occurs in approximately 15% of people with DS, probably due to [[ligamental laxity]]. It may lead to the neurologic symptoms of [[spinal cord compression]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pueschel | first1 = SM | last2 = Scola | first2 = FH| title = Atlantoaxial instability in individuals with Down syndrome: epidemiologic, radiographic, and clinical studies | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 80 | issue = 4 | pages = 555–60 | year = 1987 | pmid = 2958770 }}</ref>

Down syndrome disorders are based on having too many copies of the [[gene]]s located on chromosome 21.

The extra chromosomal material can come about in several distinct ways. A typical human karyotype is designated as 46,XX or 46,XY, indicating 46 chromosomes with an XX arrangement typical of females and 46 chromosomes with an XY arrangement typical of males.<ref>For a description of human karyotype see {{cite web |author=Mittleman, A (editor) |year=1995 |url=http://www.iscn1995.org/ |title=An International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomeclature |accessdate = 2006-06-04}}</ref> In  1–2% of the observed Down syndromes,<ref name="occurrence"/> some of the cells in the body are normal and other cells have trisomy 21.

===Trisomy 21===
Trisomy 21 (47,XX,+21) is caused by a [[Meiosis|meiotic]] [[nondisjunction]] event. With nondisjunction, a [[gamete]] (''i.e.'', a sperm or egg cell) is produced with an extra copy of chromosome 21; the gamete thus has 24 chromosomes. When combined with a normal gamete from the other parent, the [[embryo]] now has 47 chromosomes, with three copies of chromosome 21. Trisomy 21 is the cause of approximately 95% of observed Down syndromes, with 88% coming from nondisjunction in the maternal gamete and 8% coming from nondisjunction in the paternal gamete.<ref name="occurrence">{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/downsyndrome.cfm#TheOccurrence |title=Down syndrome occurrence rates (NIH) |accessdate = 2006-06-02}}</ref> The actual Down syndrome "critical region" encompasses chromosome bands 21q22.1-q22.3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/943216-overview |title=Genetics of Down Syndrome |accessdate = 2011-05-29}}</ref>

===Robertsonian translocation===
The extra chromosome 21 material that causes Down syndrome may be due to a [[Robertsonian translocation]] in the karyotype of one of the parents. In this case, the long arm of chromosome 21 is attached to another chromosome, often [[Chromosome 14 (human)|chromosome 14]] [45,XX,der(14;21)(q10;q10)]. A person with such a translocation is phenotypically normal. During reproduction, normal [[Meiosis#Nondisjunction|disjunction]]s leading to gametes have a significant chance of creating a gamete with an extra chromosome 21, producing a child with Down syndrome. Translocation Down syndrome is often referred to as ''familial Down syndrome''. It is the cause of 2–3% of observed cases of Down syndrome.<ref name="occurrence"/> It does not show the maternal age effect, and is just as likely to have come from fathers as mothers.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Prenatal testing===

Both [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|ACOG]] and [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|NICE]] guidelines recommend that screening for Down syndrome be offered to all pregnant women, regardless of age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/News_Room/News_Releases/2006/New_Recommendations_for_Down_Syndrome |title=New Recommendations for Down Syndrome Call for Offering Screening to All Pregnant Women |publisher=ACOG |date=2012-12-20 |accessdate=2013-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CG62: Antenatal care|url=http://publications.nice.org.uk/antenatal-care-cg62|publisher=London: National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|accessdate=16 February 2013|author=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|year=2008}}</ref>

A number of tests can be used to screen for Down syndrome, with varying levels of accuracy and invasiveness. They are usually used in combination to increase their detection rate, while maintaining a low false positive rate.

==== Ultrasound ====
Ultrasound imaging can be used to screen for Down syndrome. Increased fetal [[nuchal translucency]] (NT) is an indicator of increased risk of Down syndrome. A 2003 systematic review of 30 studies of NT in Down syndrome found an average sensitivity of 75-80% with a false positive rate of 5.8-6% (95% confidence intervals).<ref>{{Cite pmid|14672489}}</ref> Therefore, while the false positive rate is too high for NT to be used alone as a screening test, it is useful as part of a combined test. Ultrasound measurement of NT is usually performed between 11 and 14 weeks gestation.

Other ultrasound findings have been associated with Down syndrome. Absence of the fetal nasal bone has been associated with Down syndrome. A 2001 observational study suggested that there is an increased rate of absence of nasal bone in fetuses with Down syndrome.<ref>{{Cite pmid|11728540}}</ref> However, it is unclear how useful this would be as a screening test as the reproducibility and consistency of the procedure has not been demonstrated.

====Blood tests====
Several blood markers can be measured that can be used as part of combined tests to predict the risk of Down syndrome. These include [[α-fetoprotein]], [[β-hCG]], inhibin-A, [[PAPP-A]] and unconjugated estriol.

During the first trimester, a combination of β-hCG and PAPP-A levels can give a 60% detection rate at a 5% false positive rate.<ref>{{Cite pmid|10551789}}</ref>

In the second trimester, various markers including β-hCG, inhibin-A, α-fetoprotein and unconjugated estriol can be used to give detection rates between 60 and 70%.<ref>{{Cite pmid|22696388}}</ref>

Several non-invasive prenatal tests which employ DNA sequencing of fragments of fetal DNA in the mother's blood have been developed. The main method is to obtain maternal blood through [[venipuncture]] for analysis of [[cell-free fetal DNA]] (cffDNA). It can be performed at 10 weeks of [[gestational age]].<ref name=oxhp>[https://www.oxhp.com/secure/policy/noninvasive_prenatal_diagnosis_fetal_aneuploidy.pdf Noninvasive Prenatal Diagnosis of Fetal Aneuploidy Using Cell-Free Fetal Nucleic Acids in Maternal Blood: Clinical Policy (Effective 05/01/2013)] from Oxford Health Plans</ref> Methods to analyze cffDNA are mainly either [[massively parallel sequencing]] (MPSS) or ''directed DNA analysis'', wherein the former analyzes a random subset of cffDNA fragments.<ref name=oxhp/> MPSS is estimated to have a [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of between 96 and 100%, and a [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] between 94 and 100% for detecting Down syndrome.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmt001}}</ref> The International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis finds that this is an advanced screening test which may be of use, in conjunction with genetic counseling, in high-risk cases based upon existing screening strategies. While effective in the diagnosis of Down syndrome, it cannot assess other conditions which can be detected by invasive testing; (for pregnant women who are screen-positive using current screening protocols, Down syndrome represents about half of the fetal chromosomal abnormalities identified through amniocentesis and CVS).<ref>{{Cite journal

====Amniocentesis and CVS====
Where screening tests predict a high risk of the fetus having Down syndrome, more invasive diagnostic tests such as [[amniocentesis]] and [[chorionic villus sampling]] may be performed. These tests have a much lower false positive rate than the screening tests, therefore they are more reliable in establishing the diagnosis of Down syndrome. However, they are invasive, and carry a slightly increased risk of miscarriage.

====Abortion rates====
A 2002 literature review of elective [[abortion]] rates found that 91–93% of pregnancies in the United Kingdom and Europe with a diagnosis of Down syndrome were terminated.<ref name="Prenatal">{{cite journal |author=Caroline Mansfield, Suellen Hopfer, Theresa M Marteau |title=Termination rates after prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome, spina bifida, anencephaly, and Turner and Klinefelter syndromes: a systematic literature review |year=1999| journal=Prenatal Diagnosis |volume=19 |issue=9 |pages=808–12 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/65500197/ABSTRACT| doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0223(199909)19:9<808::AID-PD637>3.0.CO;2-B| pmid=10521836}} This is similar to 90% results found by {{cite journal |title=Determinants of parental decisions after the prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome: Bringing in context| journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=410–16 |year=1999 |author=Britt, David W; Risinger, Samantha T; Miller, Virginia; Mans, Mary K; Krivchenia, Eric  L; Evans, Mark I|doi=10.1002/1096-8628(20000828)93:5<410::AID-AJMG12>3.0.CO;2-F |pmid=10951466}}</ref> Data from the ''National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic Register'' in the United Kingdom indicates that from 1989 to 2006 the proportion of women choosing to terminate a pregnancy following prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome has remained constant at around 92%.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7746747.stm|title=Society 'more positive on Down's' |date=2008-11-24 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2008/12/changing_attitudes.html |title=Changing attitudes? |author=Horrocks Peter| date=2008-12-05}}</ref>

In the United States a number of studies have examined the abortion rate of fetuses with Down syndrome.  Three studies estimated the termination rates at 95%, 98%, and 87%.<ref name="Prenatal"/>

===Postnatal diagnosis===
In cases where prenatal tests have been negative or have not been performed, midwifery staff usually express the initial concern that a [[newborn]] has Down syndrome, such as by distinctive signs or by general appearance.<ref name=Hindley2002/> Clinical examination by a pediatrician can often confirm or refute this suspicion with confidence.<ref name=Hindley2002/> Systems of [[diagnostic criteria]] for such an examination include ''Fried's diagnostic index'', which includes the following 8 signs: flat face, ear dysplasia, tongue protrusion, corners of mouth turned down, hypotonia, neck skin excess, [[epicanthic fold]], and a gap between 1st and 2nd toes.<ref name=Hindley2002/> With 0 to 2 of these characteristics the newborn can likely be said to not have Down syndrome (with less than one in 100 [[false negative]]s), with 3 to 5 of these characteristics the situation is unclear (and genetic testing is recommended) and with 6 to 8 characteristics the newborn can confidently be said to have Down syndrome (with less than one in 100.000 [[false positive]]s).<ref name=Hindley2002/> In cases where there are no clinical grounds for making the diagnosis, it has been suggested that parents can reasonably be kept unaware of the initial suspicion.<ref name=Hindley2002/> When the diagnosis remains possible, it is recommended to perform karyotype testing and inform the parents.<ref name=Hindley2002>{{cite doi|10.1136/fn.87.3.F220}} [http://fn.bmj.com/content/87/3/F220]</ref>

===Plastic surgery===
[[Plastic surgery]] has sometimes been advocated and performed on children with Down syndrome, based on the assumption that surgery can reduce the facial features associated with Down syndrome, therefore decreasing social stigma, and leading to a better quality of life.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Olbrisch RR |title=Plastic surgical management of children with Down syndrome: indications and results |journal=British Journal of Plastic Surgery |year=1982 |volume=35 |pages=195–200 |doi=10.1016/0007-1226(82)90163-1 |pmid=6211206 |issue=2}}</ref> Plastic surgery on children with Down syndrome is uncommon,<ref>{{cite book |author=Parens E (editor) |year=2006 |title=Surgically Shaping Children : Technology, Ethics, and the Pursuit of Normality |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=0-8018-8305-9}}</ref> and continues to be controversial.

===Cognitive development===
Individuals with Down syndrome differ considerably in their language and communication skills. It is routine to screen for middle ear problems and hearing loss; low gain hearing aids or other amplification devices can be useful for language learning. Early communication intervention fosters linguistic skills. Language assessments can help profile strengths and weaknesses; for example, it is common for receptive language skills to exceed expressive skills. Individualized [[Speech-Language Pathology|speech therapy]] can target specific speech errors, increase speech intelligibility, and in some cases encourage advanced language and literacy. [[Augmentative and alternative communication]] (AAC) methods, such as pointing, body language, objects, or graphics are often used to aid communication. Relatively little research has focused on the effectiveness of communications intervention strategies.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=26–35 |title= Language and communication development in Down syndrome |author= Roberts, JE; Price, J; Malkin, C |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20136 |pmid=17326116}}</ref>

Children with Down syndrome may not age emotionally/socially and intellectually at the same rates as children without Down syndrome, so over time the intellectual and emotional gap between children with and without Down syndrome may widen. Complex thinking as required in sciences but also in history, the arts, and other subjects can often be beyond the abilities of some, or achieved much later than in other children.  Children with Down syndrome may benefit from mainstreaming (whereby students of differing abilities are placed in classes with their chronological peers) provided that some adjustments are made to the curriculum.<ref>{{cite web |author=Armstrong SE|url=http://www.altonweb.com/cs/downsyndrome/index.htm?page=ndssincl.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080420100218/http://www.altonweb.com/cs/downsyndrome/index.htm?page=ndssincl.html |archivedate=2008-04-20 |title=Inclusion: Educating Students with Down Syndrome with Their Non-Disabled Peers |accessdate = 2006-05-12}} Also, see {{cite web |url=http://www.altonweb.com/cs/downsyndrome/index.htm?page=bosworth.html |title=Benefits to Students with Down Syndrome in the Inclusion Classroom: K-3 |author=Bosworth Debra L |accessdate = 2006-06-12}}{{dead link|date=September 2010}} Finally, see a survey by NDSS on inclusion, {{cite web |url=http://www.altonweb.com/cs/downsyndrome/index.htm?page=wolpert.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080420100223/http://www.altonweb.com/cs/downsyndrome/index.htm?page=wolpert.html |archivedate=2008-04-20 |title=The Educational Challenges Inclusion Study |author=Wolpert Gloria|year=1996 |publisher=National Down Syndrome Society |accessdate = 2006-06-28}}</ref>

==History==
English physician [[John Langdon Down]] first characterized Down syndrome as a distinct form of mental disability in 1862, and in a more widely published report in 1866.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Down, JLH| year=1866| title=Observations on an ethnic classification of idiots|journal=Clinical Lecture Reports, London Hospital| volume=3| pages=259–62| url=http://www.neonatology.org/classics/down.html| accessdate = 2006-07-14}} For a history of the condition, see {{cite book | title= John Langdon Down, 1828–1896 |author=Conor, WO|publisher=Royal Society of Medicine Press |isbn=1-85315-374-5|year = 1998}} or {{cite web| last=Conor| first=Ward |url =http://www.intellectualdisability.info/values/history_DS.htm |archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20080328125636/http://www.intellectualdisability.info/values/history_DS.htm |archivedate =2008-03-28 |title =John Langdon Down and Down's syndrome (1828–1896)| accessdate = 2006-06-02}}</ref> Due to his perception that children with Down syndrome shared physical facial similarities (epicanthic folds) with those of [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|Blumenbach's Mongolian race]], Down used the term ''mongoloid'', derived from prevailing ethnic theory.<ref name="Conor">{{cite journal |author =Conor, WO|year =1999 |title =John Langdon Down: The Man and the Message |journal =Down Syndrome Research and Practice| volume =6 |issue =1 |pages =19–24 |doi =10.3104/perspectives.94}}</ref>  While the term "mongoloid" (also "mongol" or "mongoloid idiot") continued to be used until the early 1970s, it is now considered pejorative and inaccurate and is no longer in common use.<ref name="howard-jones" />

By the 20th century, Down syndrome had become the most recognizable form of mental disability. Most individuals with Down syndrome were institutionalized, few of the associated medical problems were treated, and most died in infancy or early adult life. With the rise of the [[eugenics movement]], 33 of the (then) 48 [[U.S. state]]s and several countries began programs of forced sterilization of individuals with Down syndrome and comparable degrees of disability. "[[Action T4]]" in [[Nazi Germany]] made public policy of a program of systematic [[Involuntary euthanasia|involuntary euthanization]].<ref name="Wright2011">{{cite book|author=David Wright|title=Downs:The history of a disability: The history of a disability|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0FMKNv_ALRYC&pg=PA200|accessdate=25 August 2012|date=25 August 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-956793-5|pages=104–108}}</ref>

Until the middle of the 20th century, the cause of Down syndrome remained unknown. However, the presence in all races, the association with older maternal age, and the rarity of recurrence had been noticed. Standard medical texts assumed it was caused by a combination of inheritable factors that had not been identified. Other theories focused on injuries sustained during birth.<ref>{{cite book |author=Warkany, J |title=Congenital Malformations |location=Chicago |publisher=Year Book Medical Publishers, Inc |year=1971 |pages=313–14|isbn=0-8151-9098-0}}</ref>

With the discovery of [[karyotype]] techniques in the 1950s, it became possible to identify abnormalities of chromosomal number or shape. In 1958, Jérôme Lejeune discovered that Down syndrome resulted from an extra chromosome.<ref>{{cite journal

In 1961, 18 geneticists wrote to the editor of ''[[The Lancet]]'' suggesting that ''Mongolian idiocy'' had "misleading connotations," had become "an embarrassing term," and should be changed.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Allen |last=Gordon |year=1961 |title=Mongolism (Correspondence) |journal=[[The Lancet]] |page=775 |volume=1 |issue=7180}}</ref> ''The Lancet'' supported ''Down's Syndrome''.

In 1975, the United States [[National Institutes of Health]] convened a conference to standardize the nomenclature of malformations. They recommended eliminating the possessive form: "The possessive use of an eponym should be discontinued, since the author neither had nor owned the condition."<ref>A planning meeting was held on 20 March 1974, resulting in a letter to ''The Lancet''.{{cite journal |year=1974|title=Classification and nomenclature of malformation (Discussion) |journal=[[The Lancet]] |page=798 |volume=303 |issue=7861 |pmid=4132724|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(74)92858-X}} The conference was held 10–11 February 1975, and reported to ''The Lancet'' shortly afterward.{{cite journal |year=1975 |title=Classification and nomenclature of morphological defects (Discussion) |journal=[[The Lancet]] |page=513 |volume=305|issue=7905 |pmid=46972 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(75)92847-0}}</ref> Although both the possessive and non-possessive forms are used in the general population, Down syndrome is the accepted term among professionals in the U.S., Canada and other countries; Down's syndrome is still used in the UK and other areas.<ref name=name>{{cite web |last=Leshin |first=Len |year=2003 |url=http://www.ds-health.com/name.htm|title=What's in a name |accessdate = 2006-05-12}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
In most developed countries, since the early 20th century many people with Down syndrome were housed in institutions or colonies and excluded from society. However, since the early 1960s parents and their organizations, educators and other professionals have generally advocated a policy of inclusion,<ref>{{cite book |title=Inclusion |publisher=National Down Syndrome Society |url=http://www.ndss.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1941&Itemid=236 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080608224241/http://www1.ndss.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1941&Itemid=236 |archivedate=2008-06-08 |accessdate = 2006-05-21}}</ref> bringing people with mental and/or physical disabilities into general society as much as possible. Organizations advocating for the inclusion of people with Down Syndrome include [[Mencap|MENCAP]] advocating for all people with mental disabilities, which was founded in the UK in 1946 by Judy Fryd;<ref>[http://www.mencap.org.uk/page.asp?id=1892 Timeline-Key dates in Mencap's history]</ref> the [[National Association for Down Syndrome]], the first known organization advocating for Down syndrome individuals in the United States, which was founded by [[Kathryn McGee]] in 1960;<ref>[http://www.nads.org/pages_new/news/mcgee_tribute.html NADS Honors our Founder: Kay McGee]</ref> the [[National Down Syndrome Congress]], the first truly national organization in the U.S. advocating for Down syndrome families, founded in 1973 by [[Kathryn McGee]] and others,<ref>[http://www.ndsccenter.org/about/history.php National Down Syndrome Congress - History]</ref> and the [[National Down Syndrome Society]], founded in 1979 in the U.S.<ref>[http://www.ndss.org/About-NDSS/NDSS-History/ NDSS History]</ref>

In May 2008, the [U.S.] [[Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus]] (CDSC) was formed under the leadership of congresswoman [[Cathy McMorris Rodgers]], to educate members of [[United States Congress|congress]] and their staff about Down syndrome and work with the [[National Down Syndrome Society]] to support legislative activities to improve Down syndrome research, education, and treatment, and promote public policies that would enhance the quality of life for those with Down syndrome.<ref name="ndss.org">http://www.ndss.org/About-NDSS/NDSS-History/#sthash.iYHmLQ83.dpuf</ref>

In September 2011, the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) established an NIH Down Syndrome Consortium.  The purpose of the Consortium is to foster the exchange of information on biomedical and biobehavioral research on Down syndrome being conducted by NIH institutes and centers working on Down syndrome-related topics and the national Down syndrome community.<ref name="ndss.org"/>

===Ethical issues===
Medical ethicist Ronald Green argues that parents have an obligation to avoid 'genetic harm' to their offspring,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Green |first=RM |year=1997|title=Parental autonomy and the obligation not to harm one's child genetically |journal=J Law Med Ethics |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=5–15 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-720X.1997.tb01389.x|pmid=11066476}}</ref> and [[Claire Rayner]], then a patron of the Down's Syndrome Association, defended testing and abortion saying <blockquote>
"The hard facts are that it is costly in terms of human effort, compassion, energy, and finite resources such as money, to care for individuals with handicaps&nbsp;... People who are not yet parents should ask themselves if they have the right to inflict such burdens on others, however willing they are themselves to take their share of the burden in the beginning."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/another-view-a-duty-to-choose-unselfishly-1588540.html |title=ANOTHER VIEW: A duty to choose unselfishly |last=Rayner |first=Clare |date=27 June 1995 |work=The Independent |accessdate=2009-10-30 | location=London}}</ref>

"neither [[haemophilia]] nor Down's syndrome is so crippling as to make life not worth living from the inner perspective of the person with the condition. To abort a fetus with one of these disabilities, intending to have another child who will not be disabled, is to treat fetuses as interchangeable or replaceable. If the mother has previously decided to have a certain number of children, say two, then what she is doing, in effect, is rejecting one potential child in favour of another. She could, in defence of her actions, say: the loss of life of the aborted fetus is outweighed by the gain of a better life for the normal child who will be conceived only if the disabled one dies."<ref>{{cite book |last=Singer|first=Peter |title=Practical ethics |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1993 |edition=2nd |page=395|chapter=Taking Life: Humans |isbn=0-521-43971-X}}</ref>

===World Down Syndrome Day===
The first [[World Down Syndrome Day]] (WDSD) was held on 21 March 2006. The day and month were chosen to correspond with 21 and trisomy respectively. It was proclaimed by European Down Syndrome Association during their European congress in Palma de Mallorca (February 2005). In the United States, the National Down Syndrome Society observes Down Syndrome Month every October as "a forum for dispelling stereotypes, providing accurate information, and raising awareness of the potential of individuals with Down syndrome."<ref>[http://www.ndss.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1962&Itemid=233 National Down Syndrome Society]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref> In [[South Africa]], Down Syndrome Awareness Day is held every October 20.<ref>[http://www.downsyndrome.org.za/main.aspx?artid=54 Down Syndrome South Africa].</ref>
