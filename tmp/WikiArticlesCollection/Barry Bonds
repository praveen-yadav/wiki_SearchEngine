On September 22, Bonds tied Henry Aaron's National League career home run record of 733. The home run came in the top of the 6th inning of a high-scoring game against the Milwaukee Brewers, at [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The achievement was notable for its occurrence in the very city where Aaron began (with the Milwaukee Braves) and concluded (with the Brewers, then in the American League) his career. With the Giants trailing 10–8, Bonds hit a blast to deep center field on a 2–0 pitch off the Brewers' [[Chris Spurling]] with runners on first and second and one out. Though the Giants were at the time clinging to only a slim chance of making the playoffs, Bonds' home run provided the additional drama of giving the Giants an 11–10 lead late in a critical game in the final days of a pennant race. The Brewers eventually won the game, 13–12, despite Bonds' going 3 for 5, with 2 doubles, the record-tying home run, and 6 runs batted in.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260922108|accessdate=2007-07-02|date=2006-09-22|title=Bonds ties Aaron's NL HR mark, but Giants fall to Brewers|work=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref>

==Controversies==

===BALCO scandal===
[[File:Barry bonds mug shot 1.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Mug shot taken after 2007 indictment]]
Since 2003, Bonds has been a key figure in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative ([[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative|BALCO]]) scandal. He was under investigation by a federal [[grand jury]] regarding his testimony in the BALCO case, and was indicted on [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]] charges on November 15, 2007.<ref>

In 2003, Bonds first became embroiled in a scandal when [[Greg Anderson (trainer)|Greg Anderson]] of the [[BALCO|Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative]] (BALCO), Bonds' trainer since 2000, was indicted by a federal [[grand jury]] in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] and charged with supplying [[anabolic steroids]] to athletes, including a number of baseball players. This led to speculation that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs during a time when there was no mandatory testing in Major League Baseball. Bonds declared his innocence, attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of bodybuilding, diet and legitimate supplements.<ref name=Bttsdw>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1937594|title=Bonds testified that substances didn't work|accessdate=2008-02-20|date=2004-12-04|work=[[ESPN.com]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080120163542/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1937594| archivedate= 20 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

During grand jury testimony on December 4, 2003,<ref name=BlEg2yip/> Bonds said that he used a clear substance and a cream that he received from his personal strength trainer, Greg Anderson, who told him they were the nutritional supplement flaxseed oil and a rubbing balm for arthritis.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/12/03/MNGGFA0UDU65.DTL|title=What Bonds told BALCO grand jury|date=2004-12-03|accessdate=2007-10-10 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Williams, Lance, Mark Fainaru-Wada| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071118085803/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/12/03/MNGGFA0UDU65.DTL| archivedate= 18 November 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> This testimony, as reported by [[Lance Williams]] and [[Mark Fainaru-Wada]], has frequently been misrepresented.

===Perjury investigation and federal indictment===
{{main|Barry Bonds perjury case}}
On November 15, 2007, Bonds was indicted on four counts of [[perjury]] and one count of [[obstruction of justice]] as it relates to the government investigation of BALCO.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7097583.stm|title=Baseball star Barry Bonds charged|publisher=BBC News|date=2007-11-16|accessdate=2008-02-15| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080226225527/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7097583.stm| archivedate= 26 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

On February 14, 2008 a [[typo]] in court papers filed by Federal prosecutors erroneously alleged that Bonds tested positive for steroids in November, 2001, a month after hitting his record 73rd home run.

===Players' Union===
Bonds withdrew from the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|MLB Players Association]]'s (MLBPA) [[license|licensing]] agreement because he felt independent marketing deals would be more lucrative for him. Bonds is the first player in the thirty-year history of the licensing program not to sign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1661883|title=Bonds will be individually licensed|accessdate=2008-02-20|work=[[ESPN.com]]|date=2003-11-17|author=Rovell, Darren}}</ref> Because of this withdrawal, his name and likeness are not usable in any merchandise licensed by the MLBPA. In order to use his name or likeness, a company must deal directly with Bonds. For this reason he does not appear in some baseball [[video games]], forcing game-makers to create generic athletes to replace him. For example, Bonds is replaced by "[[Jon Dowd]]" in ''[[MVP Baseball 2005]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/sportsbusiness/news/story?id=1777084|title=Bonds flexes his muscles|accessdate=2010-09-11|work=[[ESPN.com]]|author=Rovell, Darren|date=2007-04-07}}</ref> <!-- Unable to find refs "Wes Mailman" in ''[[All-Star Baseball 2005]]'', "Joe Young" in [[MLB 2K7]], Backyard Baseball 2007 and "Dean Gibeau" in ''All-Star Baseball 2006 ''and "Reggie Stocker" in ''[[MLB 07: The Show]]''.
