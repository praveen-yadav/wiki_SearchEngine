==History==
{{main|History of Andorra}}
[[File:Església de Sant Joan de Caselles - 10.jpg|left|thumb|Sant Joan de Caselles church, dating from the 11th century.]]
Tradition holds that Charles the Great ([[Charlemagne]]) granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for fighting against the [[Moors]]. [[Feudalism|Overlordship]] of the territory was by the [[Count of Urgell]] and eventually by the bishop of the [[Diocese of Urgell]]. In 988, [[Borrell II, Count of Barcelona|Borrell II]], Count of Urgell, gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in [[Cerdanya]].<ref name="histo1">{{Cite GREC|title=La formació d'Andorra|NDCHEC=0003864|en=1}}</ref> Since then the Bishop of Urgell, based in [[la Seu d'Urgell|Seu d'Urgell]], has owned Andorra.<ref name=elements>{{cite web |url=http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm |title=Elements de la història del Principat d'Andorra |language=Catalan |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100209181327/http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm |archivedate=9 February 2010}}</ref>

Before 1095, Andorra did not have any type of military protection and the Bishop of Urgell, who knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys,<ref name=elements/> asked for help and protection from the [[Lord of Caboet]]. In 1095, the Lord of Caboet and the Bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra. Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the Viscount of Castellbò and both became Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya. Years later their daughter, Ermessenda,<ref>{{Cite GREC|title=Ermessenda de Castellbò|NDCHEC=0024413|en=1}}</ref> married [[Roger-Bernard II, Count of Foix|Roger Bernat II]], the French [[Count of Foix]]. They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I, Counts of Foix, Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya, and co-sovereigns of Andorra (shared with the Bishop of Urgell).

In the 11th century, a dispute arose between the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix. The conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of [[Aragon]] by the signing of the first [[Paréage of Andorra 1278|paréage]] which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix<ref name=elements/> (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the Bishop of Urgell, in [[Catalonia]]. This gave the [[principality]] its territory and political form.

Over the years, the co-title to Andorra passed to the kings of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. After Henry of Navarre became King [[Henry IV of France]], he issued an edict in 1607 that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra. In 1812–13, the [[First French Empire]] annexed Catalonia and divided it in four [[département]]s, with Andorra being made part of the district of [[Puigcerdà]] (département of [[Sègre]]).

===20th century===
[[File:Borís Skósyrev.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boris Skossyreff]], briefly self-proclaimed "King of Andorra" in 1934.]]
Andorra declared war on [[Imperial Germany]] during World War I, but did not actually take part in the fighting. It remained in an official state of belligerency until 1939 as it was not included in the [[Treaty of Versailles]].<ref>http://www.idiotsguides.com/static/didyouknow/worldhistory/07-29-11-andorra-wwi.html</ref>

In 1933, France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before elections. On July 12th 1934, adventurer [[Boris Skossyreff]] issued a proclamation in Urgell, declaring himself "Boris I, King of Andorra", simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell. He was arrested by Spanish authorities on 20 July and ultimately expelled from Spain. From 1936 to 1940, a French detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and [[Francoist Spain]]. Francoist troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war. During World War II, Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between [[Vichy France]] and Spain.

Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than France and Spain. In recent times, however, its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation. Its political system was modernized in 1993, when it became a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Council of Europe]].

Andorra is a parliamentary [[co-principality]] with the [[President of the French Republic|President of France]] and the [[Bishop of Urgell]] ([[Catalonia]], Spain), as [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|co-princes]]. This peculiarity makes the President of France, in his capacity as [[Prince of Andorra]], an elected reigning monarch, even though he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the [[List of heads of government of Andorra|Head of Government]] is the [[head of government|chief executive]], and of a [[wiktionary:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.

The current Head of Government is [[Antoni Martí]] of the [[Democrats for Andorra]] (DA). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament.

The Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council. The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 Councillors, as the members of the legislative branch are called. The Councillors serve for four-year terms and elections are held between the thirtieth and fortieth days following the dissolution of the previous Council. The Councillors can be elected on two equal constituencies.

Half are elected in equal number from each of the seven administrative parishes and the other half of the Councillors are elected from a single national constituency. 15 days after the election, the Councillors hold their inauguration. During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected. Eight days later, the Council convenes once more. During this session the Head of Government is chosen from among the Councillors.

[[File:Casa de la Vall - 18.jpg|thumb|Casa de la Vall, Andorran Parliament]]

Candidates for the nomination can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the Councillors. The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be Head of Government. The Syndic General then notifies the Co-princes who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the Head of Government of Andorra. The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws. Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members' Bills by three of the Local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.

The Council also approves the annual budget of the principality. The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires. If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved. Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-princes so that they may sign and enact it.

If the Head of Government is not satisfied with the Council, he may request that the Co-princes dissolve the Council and order new elections. In turn, the Councillors have the power to remove the Head of Government from office. After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the Councillors, the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the Head of Government is removed.

==Law and criminal justice==
The judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court. The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the Head of Government, one each by the Coprinces, one by the Syndic General, and one by the Judges and Magistrates. It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms.

The Magistrates and Judges are appointed by the High Court, and so is the President of the Criminal Law Court. The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General. The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties. It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the Coprinces and two by the General Council. They serve eight-year terms. The Court is presided over by one of the Judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will be the leader of the Court.

==Foreign relations, defence, and security==
{{main|Foreign relations of Andorra}}
[[File:Bruxelles rue de la Montagne 10.jpg|thumb|The embassy of Andorra in [[Brussels]].]]
Andorra does not have its own armed forces,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/an.html |title=World Factbook |author=CIA |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-06-05}}</ref> although there is a small ceremonial Army.

===Military===
Andorra has a small army, which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates, but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army. The basic principle of Andorran defence is that all able-bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the ''Sometent''. Being a [[landlocked country]], Andorra has no [[navy]].

In the modern era, the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties. Uniforms were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities. Despite not being involved in any fighting, Andorra was technically the longest combatant in the First World War, as the country was left out of the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], and technically remained at war with Germany from 1914 until 1939.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idiotsguides.com/static/didyouknow/worldhistory/07_29_11_andorra_wwi.html |title=Did you know...? The country of Andorra fought World War 1 for 25 years |publisher=Idiotsguides.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref>

The army's role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the [[Police Corps of Andorra]] in 1931. Brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933, led to assistance being sought from the [[National Gendarmerie]],<!-- Reference removed, as site quoted is currently on WP blacklist --> with a detachment resident in Andorra for two months under the command of René-Jules Baulard.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ben Cahoon |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Andorra.html |title=Andorra |publisher=Worldstatesmen.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> The Andorran Army was reformed in the following year, with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1157484 |title=Andorra's 'ARMY' &ndash; Eleven Permanent Troops! |work=The Times |date=5 January 1934 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> The force consisted of six [[Corporal]]s, one for each parish (although there are currently seven parishes, there were only six until 1978), plus four junior staff officers to co-ordinate action, and a commander with the rank of Major. It was the responsibility of the six corporals, each in his own parish, to be able to raise a fighting force from among the able-bodied men of the parish.

Today a small, twelve-man ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the Andorran Army, but all able-bodied men remain technically available for military service,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3164.htm |title=Andorra |publisher=State.gov |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm. The army has not fought for more than 700 years, and its main responsibility is to present the [[Flag of Andorra]] at official ceremonial functions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aire.ad/documents/10200707_BOP14073Reglament_atm.pdf |title=Bop14073 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andorramania.com/histoire_gb.htm |title=History of the Principality of Andorra |publisher=Andorramania.com |date=11 December 1997 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> According to [[Marc Forné Molné]], Andorra's military budget is strictly from voluntary donations, and the availability of full-time voluntaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/webcast/ga/58/statements/andoeng030925.htm |title=Andorra |publisher=Un.org |date=25 September 2003 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref>

The myth that all members of the Andorran Army are ranked as officers, is popularly maintained in many works of reference.<ref>An example from the United States [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3164.htm State Department] website.</ref><ref>An alternative [http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/Andorra-POLITICS-GOVERNMENT-AND-TAXATION.html example] of the report.</ref> In reality, all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], or [[non-commissioned officer]]s, because the [[Enlisted rank|other ranks]] are considered to be the rest of the able-bodied male population, who may still be called upon by the ''Sometent'' to serve, although such a call has not been made in modern times.

===GIPA===
The ''Grup d'Intervenció Policia d'Andorra'' (GIPA) is a small special forces unit trained in [[counter-terrorism]], and [[Hostage negotiator|hostage recovery]] tasks. Although it is the closest in style to an active military force, it is part of the [[Police Corps of Andorra|Police Corps]], and not the [[Military of Andorra|Army]]. As terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the nation, the GIPA is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties, and at other times to routine policing.<ref>Police structures [http://www.policia.ad/estructura.html detailed here].</ref>

===Police Corps===
{{Main|Police Corps of Andorra}}
Andorra maintains a small, but modern and well-equipped internal police force with around 240 police officers, supported by civilian assistants. The principal services supplied by the Corps are uniformed community policing, criminal detection, border control, and traffic policing. There are also small specialist units including police dogs, mountain rescue, and bomb disposal.<ref>{{cite web|author=Carles Iglesias Carril |url=http://www.policia.ad/ |title=Andorran Police Service website |publisher=Policia.ad |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref>

===Fire Brigade===
The ''Andorran Fire Brigade'', with headquarters at [[Santa Coloma d'Andorra|Santa Coloma]], operates from four modern fire stations, and has a staff of around 120 firefighters. The service is equipped with 16 heavy appliances (fire tenders, turntable ladders, and specialist four-wheel drive vehicles), 4 light support vehicles (cars and vans), and 4 ambulances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=80&Itemid=64 |title=Vehicle details with extensive photo gallery here |publisher=Bombers.ad |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref>

Historically, the families of the six ancient parishes of Andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires. The first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in 1943. The serious fires (which lasted for two days) in parts of the principality in December 1959 led to calls for a permanent fire service, and the ''Andorran Fire Brigade'' was formed on 21 April 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=83&Itemid=44 |title=Fire Brigade history here (in Catalan) |publisher=Bombers.ad |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref>

The fire service maintains full-time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time – two at the brigade's headquarters in Santa Coloma, and one crew at each of the other three fire stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad |title=Andorran Fire Service site |publisher=Bombers.ad |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref>

Due to its location in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains, the highest being the [[Coma Pedrosa]] at {{convert|2942|m|ft|0}}, and the average elevation of Andorra is {{convert|1996|m|ft|0}}.<ref>Atlas of Andorra (1991), Andorran Government. ISBN 99913-9-063-4. {{ca icon}}</ref> These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the [[Gran Valira]] river, leaves the country for Spain (at Andorra's lowest point of {{convert|840|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Andorra's land area is {{convert|468|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|0}}.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Andorra belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests.

===Climate===
Andorra has an [[alpine climate]] and [[continental climate]]. Its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter, lower humidity, and it is slightly cooler in summer. There are, on average, 300&nbsp;days per year of sunshine.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Andorra}}

[[File:Tree map export 2009 Andorra.jpeg|thumb|Exports in 2009]]
Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 10.2&nbsp;million tourists visit annually,<ref name="es2"/> attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's relative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of adjoining France and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower [[tariff]]s.

The banking sector, with its [[tax haven]] status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is limited—only 2% of the land is arable—and most food has to be imported. Some tobacco is grown locally. The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra's natural resources include hydroelectric power, mineral water, timber, iron ore, and lead.<ref name="cia">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/an.html |title=CIA World Factbook entry: Andorra |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref>

Andorra is not a member of the European Union, but enjoys a [[Andorra – European Union relations|special relationship]] with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products. Andorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the [[French franc]] and the [[Spanish peseta]] in banking transactions until 31 December 1999, when both currencies were replaced by the EU's single currency, the euro. Coins and notes of both the franc and the peseta remained legal tender in Andorra until 31 December 2002. Andorra is negotiating to issue its own euro coins.

Andorra has traditionally had one of the world's lowest unemployment rates. In 2009, it stood at 2.9%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2129rank.html |title=CIA World Factbook: Andorra |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-06-05}}</ref>

Andorra has long benefited from its status as a tax haven, with revenues raised exclusively through import tariffs. However, during the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]] of the 21st century, its tourist economy suffered a decline, partly caused by a drop in the prices of goods in Spain, which undercut Andorran duty-free shopping. This led to a growth in unemployment. On 1 January 2012, a business tax of 10% was introduced,<ref>{{cite web|title=Andorra gets a taste of taxation|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/27/andorra-financial-crisis-tax|work=The guardian|accessdate=2013-03-30|date=27 December 2011}}</ref> followed by a [[sales tax]] of 2% a year later, which raised just over 14 million euros in its first quarter.<ref>{{cite news|title=Andorra Unveils First Indirect Tax Revenue Figures|url=http://www.tax-news.com/news/Andorra_Unveils_First_Indirect_Tax_Revenue_Figures____60703.html|newspaper=Tax News|date=9 May 2013}}</ref> On 31 May 2013, it was announced that Andorra intended to legislate for the introduction of [[income tax]] by the end of June, against a background of increasing dissatisfaction with the existence of tax havens among EU members.<ref>{{cite news|title=Andorra to introduce income tax for first time|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22745895|newspaper=BBC News|date=2 June 2013}}</ref> The announcement was made following a meeting in Paris between the Head of Government [[Antoni Marti]] and the French President and Prince of Andorra, [[François Hollande]]. Hollande welcomed the move as part of a process of Andorra "bringing its taxation in line with international standards".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.notretemps.com/argent/andorre-aligne-progressivement-sa,i29431|title=Andorre aligne progressivement sa fiscalité sur les standards internationaux (Elysée)|newspaper=Notre Temps|date=31 May 2011}}</ref>

{{main|Demographics of Andorra}}

===Population===
The population of Andorra is estimated to be 85,082 (July 2011).<ref name=cia /> The population has grown from 5,000 in 1900.

Andorran nationals form a plurality, but not a majority, in the country (31,363 / 33%);<ref name="de1">Departament d'Estadistica, 2008</ref> other nationalities include Spaniards (27,300 / 23%),<ref name="de1"/> Portuguese (13,794 / 21%),<ref name="de1"/> French (5,213 / 17%),<ref name="de1"/> Britons (1,085)<ref name="de1"/> and Italians.

Two-thirds of the population is made up of citizens without Andorran nationality, who do not have the right to vote (suffrage) in communal elections. Moreover, they are not allowed to be elected as president or to own more than 33% of the capital stock of a privately held company.<ref>[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/ANDORRA/Parlamento/andorrano/facilita/hijos/residentes/adquisicion/nacionalidad/elpepiint/19850801elpepiint_23/Tes/ El País 01/08/1985], [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/ANDORRA/examen/ser/andorrano/elpepiint/19851027elpepiint_18/Tes/ El País 27/10/1985], [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/RIBAS/_oSCAR/MARTi_ALANiS/_JOAN_/ARZOBISPO_DE_URGELL/ANDORRA/Constitucion/Andorra/seguira/limitando/derechos/poblacion/elpepiint/19920509elpepiint_5/Tes/ El País 09/05/1992], [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/Andorra/solo/inmigrantes/sanos/elpporint/20060714elpepisoc_8/Tes/ El País 14/07/2007]</ref>

===Languages===
{{main|Languages of Andorra}}
The historic and [[official language]] is [[Catalan language|Catalan]], a [[Romance language]]. The Andorran government is keen to encourage the use of Catalan. It funds a Commission for Catalan [[Toponymy]] in Andorra (Catalan: ''la Comissió de Toponímia d'Andorra''), and provides free Catalan classes to assist immigrants. Andorran television and radio stations use Catalan.

Because of immigration, historical links, and close geographic proximity, Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and French are also commonly spoken. Most Andorran residents can speak one or more of these, in addition to Catalan. English is less commonly spoken among the general population, though it is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts. Andorra is one of only three European countries (together with France and Monaco)<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/minorities/default_en.asp |title=Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (FCNM) : National Minorities, '&#39;Council of Europe'&#39;, 14 September 2010 |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> that have never signed the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities|Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=157&CM=&DF=&CL=ENG|title=Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities CETS No. 157 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref>

===Religion===
The population of Andorra is predominantly (90%) Roman Catholic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/an.html|title=CIA&nbsp;– The World Fact Book&nbsp;– Andorra}}</ref> Their patron saint is [[Our Lady of Meritxell]]. Though it is not an official state religion, the constitution acknowledges a special relationship with the Catholic Church, offering some special privileges to that group. Other Christian denominations include the [[Anglican Church]], the [[Reunification Church]], the [[New Apostolic Church]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. The [[Muslim]] community is primarily made up of North African immigrants. There is a small community of [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Bahá'í Faith in Andorra|Bahá'ís]].<ref name="ARDA05">{{cite web| title = Andorra | work = International > Regions > Southern Europe | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_6_2.asp | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}</ref><ref name="Wolfram">{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Andorra: population, capital, cities, GDP, map, flag, currency, languages, ... | encyclopedia = [[Wolfram Alpha]] | volume = Online | publisher = Wolfram – Alpha (curated data) | date = 13 March 2010 | url =http://www.wolframalpha.com/entities/countries/andorra/xy/p0/k6/ | accessdate = 2010-06-06}}</ref> Roughly 100 Jews live in Andorra.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51537.htm |title=US Dept of State information |publisher=State.gov |date=2005-11-08 |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref> (see [[History of the Jews in Andorra]]).

==Education==

===Schools===
Children between the ages of 6 and 16 are required by law to have full-time education. Education up to secondary level is provided free of charge by the government.

There are three systems of schools&nbsp;– Andorran, French and Spanish&nbsp;– which use Catalan, French and Spanish, respectively, as the main language of instruction. Parents may choose which system their children attend. All schools are built and maintained by Andorran authorities, but teachers in the French and Spanish schools are paid for the most part by France and Spain. About 50% of Andorran children attend the French primary schools, and the rest attend Spanish or Andorran schools.

===University of Andorra===
The [[Universitat d'Andorra]] (UdA) is the state public university and is the only university in Andorra. It was established in 1997. The University provides first-level degrees in nursing, computer science, business administration, and educational sciences, in addition to higher professional education courses. The only two graduate schools in Andorra are the Nursing School and the School of Computer Science, the latter having a PhD programme.

====Virtual Studies Centre====
The geographical complexity of the country as well as the small number of students prevents the University of Andorra from developing a full academic program, and it serves principally as a centre for virtual studies, connected to Spanish and French universities. The Virtual Studies Centre (''Centre d’Estudis Virtuals'') at the University runs in the region of twenty degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in fields including tourism, law, Catalan philology, humanities, psychology, political sciences, audiovisual communication, telecommunications engineering, and East Asia studies. The Centre also runs various postgraduate programs and continuing-education courses for professionals.

==Healthcare==
Healthcare in Andorra is provided to all employed persons and their families by the government-run social security system, [[Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social|CASS]] (Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social), which is funded by employer and employee contributions in respect of salaries.<ref name="travenand">''Travailler en Andorre'' (May 2006), Govern d'Andorra, Servei d'Ocupació, p.30. {{fr icon}}</ref> The cost of healthcare is covered by CASS at rates of 75% for out-patient expenses such as medicines and hospital visits, 90% for hospitalisation, and 100% for work-related accidents. The remainder of the costs may be covered by private health insurance. Other residents and tourists require full private health insurance.<ref name="travenand"/>

The main hospital, Meritxell, is in [[Escaldes-Engordany]].<ref name="cassps">{{cite web|url=http://online.cass.ad/web/lacass/professionalSalut/hospitals/Andorra |title=List of specialties with coverage by CASS at Hospital Nostra Senyora de Meritxell (2009) |publisher=Online.cass.ad |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> There are also 12 primary health care centres in various locations around the Principality.<ref name="cassps"/>

==Transport==

[[File:Latour-de-Carol station - 2004-02-02.jpg|thumb|A train at [[Latour-de-Carol]] (''La Tor de Querol''), one of the two stations serving Andorra. Andorra has no railways, although the line connecting Latour-de-Carol and [[Toulouse]], which in turn connects to France's [[TGV]]s at Toulouse, runs within two kilometres of the Andorran border.]]

Until the 20th century, Andorra had very limited transport links to the outside world, and development of the country was affected by its physical isolation. Even now, the nearest major airports at Toulouse and Barcelona are both three hours' drive from Andorra.

Andorra has a road network of {{convert|279|km|0|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|76|km|0|abbr=on}} is unpaved. The two main roads out of [[Andorra la Vella]] are the CG-1 to the Spanish border, and the CG-2 to the French border via the Envalira Tunnel near [[El Pas de la Casa]].<ref name="mobi">{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilitat.ad/CA/default.asp |title=Agència de Mobilitat, Govern d'Andorra |publisher=Mobilitat.ad |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> Bus services cover all metropolitan areas and many rural communities, with services on most major routes running half-hourly or more frequently during peak travel times. There are frequent long-distance bus services from Andorra to [[Barcelona]] and [[Toulouse]]. Bus services are mostly run by private companies, but some local ones are operated by the government.

There are no railways, ports, or airports for fixed-wing aircraft in Andorra. There are, however, heliports in [[La Massana]], [[Arinsal]] and [[Escaldes-Engordany]] with commercial helicopter services.<ref name="heliand">Heliand&nbsp;– Serveis (2009).

The closest public airport is [[Perpignan - Rivesaltes Airport]], which is {{convert|160|km|0|abbr=on}} away and has short-haul services to several destinations in the United Kingdom and France. [[La Seu d'Urgell Airport]], a small airfield {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Spain, near to Andorra, currently used only by private aeroplanes, is being studied as a possible future airport for public aviation services.<ref name="gdc2008">La Generalitat es reuneix amb els pobles afectats per l'aeroport (31 October 2008).

This line is operated by the [[SNCF]]. Latour-de-Carol has a scenic [[metre gauge]] [[Yellow Train|trainline]] to [[Villefranche-de-Conflent]], as well as the SNCF's {{RailGauge|1435mm}}-gauge line connecting to [[Perpignan]], and the [[RENFE|RENFE's]] {{RailGauge|1668mm}} [[Iberian gauge|-gauge]] line to [[Barcelona]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bueker.net/trainspotting/map.php?file=maps/french-network/french-network.gif |title=Sncf Map |language={{de icon}} |publisher=Bueker.net |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maplandia.com/france/languedoc-roussillon/pyrenees-orientales/prades/latour-de-carol/ |title=Google map |publisher=Maplandia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref>

==Media and telecommunications==
{{update|section|date=February 2011}}
{{Main|Telecommunications in Andorra}}
In Andorra, mobile and fixed telephone and internet services are operated exclusively by the Andorran national telecommunications company, SOM, also known as ''Servei de Telecomunicacions d'Andorra'' (STA). The same company also manages the technical infrastructure for national broadcasting of digital television and radio.

By the end of 2010, it is planned that every home in the country will have fibre-to-the-home for internet access at a minimum speed of 100&nbsp;Mbit/s.<ref name="somfo">SOM Newsletter, March 2009.</ref>

There is only one Andorran television station, ''[[Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra]]'' (RTVA). ''Radio Nacional d’Andorra'' operates two radio stations, ''[[Radio Andorra]]'' and ''Andorra Música''. There are three national newspapers, ''[[Diari d'Andorra]]'', ''[[El Periòdic d'Andorra]]'', and ''[[Bondia (newspaper)|Bondia]]'' as well as several local newspapers.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Andorra}}
{{see also|Music of Andorra}}
[[File:HPIM0309.JPG|thumb|right|Andorran flag on balcony, Ordino]]
The official and historic language is Catalan. Thus the culture is Catalan, with its own specificity.

Andorra is home to folk dances like the contrapàs ([[ca]]) and marratxa, which survive in [[Sant Julià de Lòria]] especially. Andorran folk music has similarities to the music of its neighbours, but is especially [[music of Catalonia|Catalan]] in character, especially in the presence of dances such as the [[sardana]]. Other Andorran folk dances include contrapàs in [[Andorra la Vella]] and Saint Anne's dance in Escaldes-Engordany. Andorra's national holiday is [[Our Lady of Meritxell]] Day, 8 September.<ref name="cia"/> American Folk Artist [[Malvina Reynolds]], intrigued by its defence budget of $4.90, wrote a song "Andorra". Pete Seeger added verses, and sang "Andorra" on his 1962 album "The Bitter and the Sweet.".

==Sports==
Andorra is famous for the practice of [[Winter Sports]] and [[Roller hockey (quad)|Roller Hockey]]. Andorra usually plays in [[CERH European Roller Hockey Championship|CERH Euro Cup]] and in [[FIRS Roller Hockey World Cup]].
In 2011, Andorra was the host country to the [[2011 European League Final Eight]].
The country is represented in association football by the [[Andorra national football team]]. However, the team has had little success internationally because of Andorra's small population.<ref name="fifa">{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/associations/association=and/ranking/gender=m/index.html |title=FIFA Rankings – Andorra |publisher=Fifa.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref>
In 2012 Andorra raised its first national cricket team and played an at home match against the Dutch Fellowship of Fairly Odd Places Cricket Club. The first match played in the history of Andorra at an altitude of {{convert|1300|m|sp=us}}. FFOP CC ended 187 for 5 wickets, while Andorra XI were all out at 105. Andorra XI has stated they want to keep on playing the game. Both at home and away. Cricket clubs in southern France may be challenged.<ref>{{cite web|title=Netherlands Based FFOP CC Beats Andorra National Team|url=http://www.cricketworld.com/netherlands-based-ffop-cc-beats-andorra-xi/32216.htm|work=Cricket World|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=3 September 2012}}</ref>
