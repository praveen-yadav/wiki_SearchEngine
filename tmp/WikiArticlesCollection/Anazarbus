'''Anazarbus ''' (med. '''Ain Zarba'''; mod. '''Anavarza''') was an ancient [[Cilicia]]n city, situated in [[Anatolia]] in modern [[Turkey]], in the present [[Ã‡ukurova]] (or classical [[Aleian plain]]) about 15&nbsp;km west of the main stream of the present [[Ceyhan River]] (or classical [[Pyramus river]]) and near its tributary the [[Sempas Su]].

A lofty isolated ridge formed its [[acropolis]]. Though some of the masonry in the ruins is certainly pre-Roman, the [[Suda]]'s identification of it with [[Cyinda]], famous as a treasure city in the wars of [[Eumenes of Cardia]], cannot be accepted in the face of [[Strabo]]'s express location of Cyinda in western Cilicia.

Under the early [[Roman empire]] the place was known as '''Caesarea''', and was the metropolis of [[Cilicia Secunda]]. Rebuilt by the emperor [[Justin I]] after an [[earthquake]] in the 6th century, it became '''Justinopolis''' (525); but the old native name persisted, and when [[Thoros I of Armenia|Thoros I]], king of [[Lesser Armenia]], made it his capital early in the 12th century, it was known as '''Anazarva'''.

Its great natural strength and situation, not far from the mouth of the [[Sis pass]], and near the great road which [[debouches|debouched]] from the [[Cilician Gates]], made Anazarbus play a considerable part in the struggles between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the early [[Muslim]] invaders. It had been rebuilt by [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 796, refortified at great expense by the [[Hamdanid]] [[Sayf al-Dawla]] (mid-10th century) but was then sacked by the Crusaders and returned to the Armenians.  Most of the remaining fortifications including the Curtain walls and [[Keep]] date to this period and were built by the Armenians. The [[Mamluk]] Empire of Egypt finally destroyed the city in 1374.

The present wall of the lower city is of late construction.  It encloses a mass of ruins conspicuous in which are a fine [[triumphal arch]], the colonnades of two streets, a [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], etc. A stadium and a theatre lie outside outside the walls to the south.  The remains of the acropolis fortifications are very interesting, including roads and ditches hewn in the rock; but beyond ruins of two churches, a [[gatehouse]], and a fine [[keep]] built by Thoros I There are no notable structures in the upper town.  For picturesqueness the site is not equalled in Cilicia, and it is worthwhile to trace the three fine [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s to their sources.  A necropolis on the escarpment to the south of the curtain wall can also be seen complete with signs of illegal modern excavations.   

A visit in December, 2002 showed that the three aqueducts mentioned above have been nearly completely destroyed. Only small, isolated sections are left standing with the largest portion lying in a pile of rubble that stretches the length of where the aqueducts once stood. A powerful earthquake that struck the area in 1945 is thought to be responsible for the destruction.

A modest Turkish farming village lies to the southwest of the ancient city.  A small outdoor museum with some of the artifacts collected in the area can be viewed for a small fee.  Also nearby are some beautiful mosaics discovered in a farmers field.  Inquire at the museum for a viewing.

Anazarbus/Anavarsa was one of a chain of Armenian fortifications stretching through Cilicia.  Sis Castle (modern [[Kozan, Adana]]) lies to the north while [[Tumlu Kale]] (Tumlu Castle) lies to the southwest and [[Amouda]] Castle to the Southeast.
