'''William Boyd "Bill" Watterson II''' (born July 5, 1958) is an American artist and the author of the [[comic strip]] ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'', which was syndicated from 1985 to 1995. Watterson stopped drawing ''Calvin and Hobbes'' at the end of 1995 with a short statement to newspaper editors and his readers that he felt he had achieved all he could in the medium. Watterson is known for his views on licensing and comic syndication and his move back into private life after drawing ''Calvin and Hobbes'' came to a close.

==Early years and education==
Bill Watterson was born in Washington, D.C. where his father, James G. Watterson (born 1932) worked as a [[patent attorney|patent attorney. ]]The family relocated to [[Chagrin Falls, Ohio]] in 1965 when Watterson was six years old because his mother, Kathryn, wanted to be closer to her family and felt the small town was a good place to raise children.

Watterson, who drew his first cartoon at age eight, spent much time in childhood alone, drawing and cartooning. This continued through his school years,<ref name="shortbiography">{{cite web

| title=A Short Biography of Bill Watterson

| author=Tim Hulsizer}}</ref> during which time he discovered comic strips like ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'', ''[[Krazy Kat]]'', and [[Charles M. Schulz|Charles Schulz]]' ''[[Peanuts]]'' which subsequently inspired and influenced his desire to become a professional cartoonist.<ref>Watterson, Bill (1995). ''The Calvin & Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book'', p. 17. Andrews McMeel Publishing, Kansas City, Missouri. ISBN 0-7407-7794-7</ref> On one occasion, when he was in fourth grade, he wrote a letter to Charles Schulz, who—to Watterson's surprise, responded, making a big impression on him at the time. His parents encouraged him in his artistic pursuits. Later they would recall him as a "conservative child"—imaginative, but "not in a fantasy way", and certainly nothing like the character of Calvin he would later create.<ref>Gene Williams (August 30, 1987), [http://ignatz.brinkster.net/calterego.html "Calvin's Other Alter Ego"], ''Cleveland Plain Dealer''</ref> Watterson found avenues for his cartooning talents throughout primary and secondary school, creating high school-themed super hero comics with his friends and contributing cartoons and art to the school paper, and yearbook.<ref>Nevin Martell (2009), ''Looking for Calvin and Hobbes: The Unconventional Story of Bill Watterson and His Revolutionary Comic Strip. ''Continuum.</ref>

From 1976 to 1980, Watterson attended [[Kenyon College]] and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. Although he had already decided upon a career in cartooning, he felt his studies would help him move into editorial cartooning. While at college he continued to develop his art skills—during his final year he painted [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Creation of Adam]]'' on the ceiling of his dorm room.<ref>Bill Watterson (20 May 1990), [http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cglimpsed.html "Some Thoughts On the Real World By One Who Glimpsed It and Fled"], ''Kenyon College Commencement Speech''</ref> He also contributed cartoons to the college newspaper, some of which included the original "Spaceman Spiff" cartoons.{{efn|Many of these early cartoons are archived online<ref>{{cite web|title=Rare Bill Watterson Art|url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cbillart.html}}</ref>}}

Later, when Watterson was creating names for the characters in his comic strip, he decided upon Calvin (after the Protestant reformer [[John Calvin]]) and Hobbes (after the social philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]]), allegedly as a "tip of the hat" to the [[political science]] department at Kenyon. In "The Complete Calvin And Hobbes," Watterson stated that Calvin is named for "a 16th-century theologian who believed in [[predestination]]," and Hobbes for "a 17th-century philosopher with a dim view of human nature."

==Early career==
[[Jim Borgman]] had graduated from Kenyon before Watterson arrived, and his work as a [[political cartoonist]] so impressed Bill that he decided to pursue a career as one himself. Borgman worked at ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' and encouraged and advised Watterson through his student years. When Watterson graduated in 1980, he was offered a 6-month trial as a political cartoonist for ''[[The Cincinnati Post]]''. Things didn't quite work out as expected. Watterson soon found himself out of his depth and unable to live up to the expectations of his editor. Having never been a resident prior to commencing work, he found the politics of the "weird, three-party, city manager government" to be a steep learning curve, and one that he never had a chance to fully understand before finding his employment abruptly terminated.<ref name="honk">{{cite web

==Rise to success==

===Inspiration===
Watterson has said he works for personal fulfillment. As he told the graduating class of 1990 at Kenyon College, "It's surprising how hard we'll work when the work is done just for ourselves." ''Calvin and Hobbes'' was first published on November 18, 1985. In ''Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book'', he wrote<ref>{{Cite book

Schulz|Charles Schulz]] for ''[[Peanuts]]''; [[Walt Kelly]] for ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' and [[George Herriman]] for ''[[Krazy Kat]]''. Watterson wrote the introduction to the first volume of ''The Komplete Kolor Krazy Kat''. Watterson's style also reflects the influence of [[Winsor McCay]]'s ''[[Little Nemo|Little Nemo in Slumberland]]''.<ref name="bob">{{cite web

Like many artists, Watterson incorporated elements of his life, interests, beliefs and values into his work—for example, his hobby as a cyclist,<ref>{{Cite book

Watterson spent much of his career trying to change the climate of newspaper comics. He believed that the artistic value of comics was being undermined, and that the space they occupied in newspapers continually decreased, subject to arbitrary whims of shortsighted publishers. Furthermore, he opined that art should not be judged by the medium for which it is created (i.e., there is no [[High culture|"high" art]] or [[Low culture|"low" art]]—just art).<ref name="tenthanniversary">{{Cite book

===Fight against merchandising the cartoon characters===
Watterson battled against pressure from publishers to merchandise his work, something he felt would cheapen his comic.<ref name="cheapcomic">{{cite web

===Reuben Award===
Watterson was awarded the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s Humor Comic Strip Award in 1988 and the society's Reuben Award in 1986;<ref name="reub">{{cite web

Watterson wrote a brief, tongue-in-cheek autobiography in the late 1980s.<ref name="bio">{{cite web

From September 10, 2001, to January 16, 2002, [[Ohio State University]]'s [[Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum]] exhibited 36 of his [[Sunday strip]]s, all of which can be seen in 2001's ''Calvin and Hobbes: The Sunday Pages 1985–1995''.

==End of ''Calvin and Hobbes''==
Watterson announced the end of ''Calvin and Hobbes'' on November 9, 1995, with the following letter to newspaper editors:

{{Quotation|
Dear Reader:<br/>
<br/>
I will be stopping ''Calvin and Hobbes'' at the end of the year. This was not a recent or an easy decision, and I leave with some sadness. My interests have shifted, however, and I believe I've done what I can do within the constraints of daily deadlines and small panels. I am eager to work at a more thoughtful pace, with fewer artistic compromises. I have not yet decided on future projects, but my relationship with Universal Press Syndicate will continue.<br/>
<br/>
That so many newspapers would carry ''Calvin and Hobbes'' is an honor I'll long be proud of, and I've greatly appreciated your support and indulgence over the last decade. Drawing this comic strip has been a privilege and a pleasure, and I thank you for giving me the opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Bill Watterson}}

The last strip of ''Calvin and Hobbes'' was published on December 31, 1995.

===Since the end of ''Calvin and Hobbes''===
Since the conclusion of ''Calvin and Hobbes'', Watterson has taken up painting, at one point drawing landscapes of the woods with his father. Watterson has kept away from the public eye and has given no indication of resuming the strip, creating new works based on the strip's characters, or embarking on other projects, though he has published several anthologies of ''Calvin and Hobbes'' strips. He will not sign autographs or license his characters, staying true to his stated principles.

In previous years, Watterson was known to sneak autographed copies of his books onto the shelves of the Fireside Bookshop, a family-owned bookstore in his hometown of [[Chagrin Falls, Ohio]]. However, after discovering that some were selling the autographed books online for high prices, he ended this practice as well.<ref name="2005 AP story">{{cite web | url = http://www.projo.com/yourlife/content/projo_20051024_calhobbes.885b8c7.html | title = Calvin and Hobbes creator stays out of view, even at debut of collected strips | date=October 24, 2005}}</ref> Valuing privacy, he is reluctant to give interviews or make public appearances. His lengthiest interview was featured as the cover story in ''The Comics Journal'' No. 127 in February 1989.<ref name="The Comics Journal No. 127, February 1989">{{cite web | url = http://www.tcj.com/the-comics-journal-no-127-february-1989/ | title = http://www.tcj.com/the-comics-journal-no-127-february-1989/ | date=November 4, 2013}}</ref> He drew a new ''Calvin and Hobbes'' cover for that issue of the magazine as well.

On December 21, 1999, a short piece written by Watterson to mark the forthcoming end of the iconic comic strip, ''[[Peanuts]]'', was published in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name="lat">{{Cite news

In the years that followed the end of ''Calvin and Hobbes'', many attempts were made to locate Watterson in his hometown of Chagrin Falls. Both ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' and the ''[[Cleveland Scene]]'' sent reporters in 1998 and 2003, respectively, but were unable to locate him.

In 2004, Watterson and his wife Melissa bought a home in the Cleveland suburb of [[Cleveland Heights, Ohio]]. In 2005, they completed the move from their home in Chagrin Falls to their new residence.<ref>{{citation | url = http://ignatz.brinkster.net/ctigerstrikes.html | first = Neely | last = Tucker | contribution = The Tiger Strikes Again | title = The Washington Post | date = October 4, 2005}}.</ref><ref>{{citation | url = http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cprivacy.html | first = Joe | last = Milicia | title = ''Calvin and Hobbes'' Creator Keeps Privacy | publisher = Associated Press | date = October 22, 2005}}.</ref>

In 2005, [[Gene Weingarten]] of the ''[[The Washington Post]]'' sent Watterson the first edition of the ''[[Barnaby (comic strip)|Barnaby]]'' book, as an incentive, hoping to land an interview. Weingarten passed the book, along with a message, to Watterson's parents, and declared he would wait in his hotel for as long as it took Watterson to contact him. Watterson's editor Lee Salem called the next day to tell Weingarten that the cartoonist would not be coming.

In October 2005, Watterson answered 15 questions submitted by readers.<ref name="faniv">{{cite web

In October 2007, Watterson wrote a review of ''Schulz and Peanuts'', a biography of Charles Schulz, in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.<ref name="wsj">{{Cite news

In 2008, he provided a foreword for the first book collection of [[Richard Thompson (cartoonist)|Richard Thompson's]] ''[[Cul de Sac (comic strip)|Cul De Sac]]'' comic strip.

In early 2010, Watterson was interviewed by ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' on the 15th anniversary of the end of ''Calvin and Hobbes''. Explaining his decision to discontinue the strip, he said,

{{Quotation|
This isn't as hard to understand as people try to make it. By the end of ten years, I'd said pretty much everything I had come there to say. It's always better to leave the party early. If I had rolled along with the strip's popularity and repeated myself for another five, ten, or twenty years, the people now "grieving" for ''Calvin and Hobbes'' would be wishing me dead and cursing newspapers for running tedious, ancient strips like mine instead of acquiring fresher, livelier talent. And I'd be agreeing with them. I think some of the reason ''Calvin and Hobbes'' still finds an audience today is because I chose not to run the wheels off it. I've never regretted stopping when I did.<ref>

In April 2011, a representative for [[Andrews McMeel]] received a package from a "William Watterson in Cleveland Heights, Ohio", which contained a 6" x 8" oil-on-board painting of ''[[Cul de Sac (comic strip)|Cul De Sac]]'' character Petey Otterloop, done by Watterson for the ''Team Cul de Sac'' fundraising project for [[Parkinson's Disease]]. His syndicate, which has since become [[Universal Uclick]], has said that the painting was the first new artwork from Watterson that the syndicate has seen since ''Calvin and Hobbes'' ended in 1995.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/this-just-in-first-new-art-from-calvin-and-hobbes-creator-in-16-years-syndicate-says/2011/04/22/AF7l7NQE_blog.html Washington Post: "THIS JUST IN: First new art from ‘Calvin and Hobbes’ creator in 16 years, syndicate says", April 22, 2011.]</ref>

In October 2013, the magazine [[Mental Floss]] published an interview with Watterson, only the second since the strip ended. Watterson again confirmed that he would not be revisiting Calvin and Hobbes, and that he was satisfied with his decision. Watterson also gave his opinion on the changes in the comic book industry and where it would be headed in future:

{{Quotation|
Personally, I like paper and ink better than glowing pixels, but to each his own. Obviously the role of comics is changing very fast. On the one hand, I don’t think comics have ever been more widely accepted or taken as seriously as they are now. On the other hand, the mass media is disintegrating, and audiences are atomizing. I suspect comics will have less widespread cultural impact and make a lot less money. I’m old enough to find all this unsettling, but the world moves on. All the new media will inevitably change the look, function, and maybe even the purpose of comics, but comics are vibrant and versatile, so I think they’ll continue to find relevance one way or another. But they definitely won’t be the same as what I grew up with.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/53216/mental-floss-exclusive-our-interview-bill-watterson |title=Mental Floss Exclusive: Our Interview with Bill Watterson! |date=October 17, 2013|publisher=[[Mental Floss]]}}</ref>}}

==Legacy==

===Changing the format of the Sunday strip===
Watterson opposed the structure publishers imposed on Sunday newspaper cartoons: the standard cartoon starts with a large, wide rectangle featuring the cartoon's logo or a throwaway panel tangential to the main area so that newspapers pressed for space can remove the top third of the cartoon if they wish; the rest of the strip is presented in a series of rectangles of different widths. In Watterson's opinion, this format limited the cartoonist's options of allowable presentation. After his sabbatical year in 1991 he managed to gain an exception to these constraints for ''Calvin and Hobbes'', allowing him to draw his [[Sunday strip]] the way he wanted. In many, panels overlap or contain their own panels; in some, the action progresses diagonally across the strip.<ref>{{Cite book
