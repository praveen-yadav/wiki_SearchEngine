'''Andrew Jackson''' (March 15, 1767&nbsp;– June 8, 1845) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|seventh]] [[President of the United States]] (1829–1837). Based in frontier [[Tennessee]], Jackson was a politician and army general who defeated the [[Muscogee people|Creek]] Indians at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] (1814), and the British at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] (1815). A polarizing figure who dominated the [[Second Party System]] in the 1820s and 1830s, as president he dismantled the [[Second Bank of the United States]] and initiated forced relocation and resettlement of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes from the Southeast to west of the Mississippi River. His enthusiastic followers created the modern [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The 1830–1850 period later became known as the era of [[Jacksonian democracy]].<ref>[[Sean Wilentz|Wilentz, Sean]]. ''Andrew Jackson'' (2005), p. 8, 35.</ref>

Jackson was nicknamed "'''Old Hickory'''" because of his toughness and aggressive personality; he fought in [[duel]]s, some fatal to his opponents.<ref name="miller">{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/president/jqadams/essays/biography/3 |title=John Quincy Adams: Campaigns and Elections |date=December 8, 2010 |work=American President: An Online Reference Resource |publisher=University of Virginia |first=Mary |last=Hargreaves |quote=In a masterstroke of popular politics, the Jacksonians made good use of the general's nickname, Old Hickory. He had earned the name because he was reputed to be as tough as hickory wood.}}</ref> He was a wealthy slaveholder. He fought politically against what he denounced as a closed, undemocratic [[aristocracy]], adding to his appeal to [[Commoner|common citizens]]. He expanded the [[spoils system]] during his presidency to strengthen his political base.

Elected president in 1828, Jackson supported a small and limited federal government. He strengthened the power of the presidency, which he saw as spokesman for the entire population, as opposed to Congressmen from a specific small district. He was supportive of [[states' rights]], but during the [[Nullification Crisis]], declared that states do not have the right to nullify federal laws. Strongly against the [[national bank]], he vetoed the renewal of its charter and ensured its collapse. Whigs and moralists denounced his aggressive enforcement of the [[Indian Removal Act]], which resulted in the forced relocation of thousands of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s to [[Indian Territory]] (now [[Oklahoma]]). Historians acknowledge his protection of popular democracy and individual liberty for [[Americans|American]] citizens, but criticize his support for [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and his role in [[Indian removal]].<ref name=legacy1>Finkelman, Paul (2006).

==Early life and education==
Jackson was born on March 15, 1767. His parents were [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] colonists Andrew and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson, [[Presbyterian]]s who had emigrated from [[Ireland]] two years earlier.<ref name="birthplace">{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson |work=Information Services Branch, State Library of North Carolina |url=http://statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us/nc/bio/public/jackson.htm}}</ref><ref name="Carrick">{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson Cottage and US Rangers Centre |work=[[Northern Ireland Tourist Board]] |url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/product.aspx?ProductID=2801}}</ref> Jackson's father was born in [[Carrickfergus]], [[County Antrim]], in current-day [[Northern Ireland]], around 1738.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gullan|first=Harold I. |title=First fathers: the men who inspired our Presidents|publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken, N.J. : J|date=c2004|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YSt1AAAAMAAJ&q=%22Andrew+Jackson,+Sr.%22+-inpublisher:icon&dq=%22Andrew+Jackson,+Sr.%22+-inpublisher:icon&cd=9|isbn=0-471-46597-6 |oclc=53090968 |pages= xii, 308 p. : ill. ; 25&nbsp;cm | accessdate=January 14, 2010|lccn=2003020625}}</ref> Jackson's parents lived in the village of [[Boneybefore]], also in County Antrim. 
[[File:Andrew Jackson mural.png|thumb|170px|left|Jackson's Scots-Irish heritage celebrated by a mural on [[Belfast]]'s [[Shankill Road]]]]

When they emigrated to America in 1765, Jackson's parents probably landed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They would have traveled overland down through the Appalachian Mountains to the Scots-Irish community in the [[Waxhaws]] region, straddling the border between [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]].<ref>Booraem, Hendrik (2001) ''Young Hickory : The Making of Andrew Jackson'' p.9</ref> They brought two children from Ireland, Hugh (born 1763) and Robert (born 1764).

Jackson's father died in an accident in February 1767, at the age of 29, three weeks before his son Andrew was born in the [[Waxhaws]] area. His exact birth site is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying Jackson's father. The area was so remote that the border between North and South Carolina had not officially been surveyed.<ref name="Old"/>

In 1824, Jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncle's plantation in [[Lancaster County, South Carolina]]. But he may have claimed to be a South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the [[Tariff of 1824]], which Jackson opposed. In the mid-1850s, second-hand evidence indicated that he may have been born at a different uncle's home in North Carolina.<ref name="Old">{{cite news |work=The Washington Post |date=March 7, 2011 |first=Jeffrey|last=Collings |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/06/AR2011030603406.html?wprss=rss_print/asection |title=Old fight lingers over Old Hickory's roots}}</ref>

Jackson received a sporadic education in the local "old-field" school.<ref>In the antebellum South, rural schools were often built in exhausted cotton or tobacco fields, hence the name.</ref> In 1781, he worked for a time in a saddle-maker's shop.<ref name=Paletta>{{cite book |last=Paletta|first=Lu Ann |coauthors=Worth, Fred L |title=The World Almanac of Presidential Facts |publisher=World Almanac Books |year=1988 |isbn=0-345-34888-5}}</ref> Later, he taught school and studied law in [[Salisbury, North Carolina]]. In 1787, he was admitted to the bar, and moved to [[Jonesborough, Tennessee|Jonesborough]], in what was then the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Western District]] of North Carolina. This area later became the [[Southwest Territory]] (1790), the precursor to the state of Tennessee.

==Early military service==
[[File:Andrew-Jackson-disobeys-British-officer-1780.png|thumb|left|''Young Jackson Refusing to Clean Major Coffin's Boots'' (1876 [[lithography|lithograph]]).]] <!-- official title, searching for author -->
During the [[American Revolutionary War]], Jackson, at age thirteen, joined a local militia as a courier.<ref>Remini 1:15–17</ref> His eldest brother, Hugh, died from heat exhaustion during the [[Battle of Stono Ferry]], on June 20, 1779. Jackson and his brother Robert were captured by the British and held as prisoners; they nearly starved to death in captivity. When Jackson refused to clean the boots of a British officer, the officer slashed at the youth with a sword, leaving Jackson with scars on his left hand and head, as well as an intense hatred for the British.<ref name="Remini 1:13">Remini 1:13</ref> While imprisoned, the brothers contracted [[smallpox]].

Robert Jackson died on April 27, 1781, a few days after their mother Elizabeth secured the brothers' release. After being assured Andrew would recover, Elizabeth Jackson volunteered to nurse prisoners of war on board two ships in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] harbor, where there had been an outbreak of [[cholera]]. She died from the disease in November 1781, and was buried in an unmarked grave. Jackson became an orphan at age 14.<ref name="Remini 1:13"/> Following the deaths of his brothers and mother during the war, Jackson blamed the British for his losses.

==Legal and political career==
Jackson began his legal career in Jonesborough, now northeastern Tennessee. Though his legal education was scanty, he knew enough to be a [[country lawyer]] on the [[American frontier|frontier]]. Since he was not from a distinguished family, he had to make his career by his own merits; soon he began to prosper in the rough-and-tumble world of frontier law. Most of the actions grew out of disputed land-claims, or from [[assault (tort)|assault]] and [[battery (tort)|battery]]. In 1788, he was appointed Solicitor (prosecutor) of the Western District and held the same position in the government of the [[Territory South of the River Ohio]] after 1791.

Jackson was elected as a delegate to the Tennessee [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] in 1796. When Tennessee achieved statehood that year, Jackson was elected its [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]]. The following year, he was elected [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] as a [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]], but he resigned within a year. In 1798, he was appointed a judge of the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]], serving until 1804.<ref>{{CongBio|j000005|inline=1|date=October 30, 2011}}</ref>

In addition to his legal and political career, Jackson prospered as [[plantation|planter]], slave owner, and merchant. He built a home and the first general store in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]] in 1803. The next year he acquired [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|the Hermitage]], a {{convert|640|acre|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} plantation in [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], near [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. Jackson later added {{convert|360|acre|0|abbr=on}} to the plantation, which eventually grew to {{convert|1050|acres|0|abbr=on}}. The primary crop was [[cotton]], grown by enslaved workers. Starting with nine slaves, Jackson held as many as 44 by 1820, and later held up to 150 slaves, making him among the planter elite. Throughout his lifetime Jackson may have owned as many as 300 slaves.<ref>Remini (2000), p.51 cites 1820 census; mentions later figures up to 150 without noting a source.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehermitage.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=36&Itemid=49 |title=Hermitage |publisher=Thehermitage.com |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100928173222/http://www.thehermitage.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=36&Itemid=49| archivedate= September 28, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Jackson was a major land speculator in West Tennessee after he had negotiated the sale of the land from the [[Chickasaw Nation]] in 1818 (termed the [[Jackson Purchase (U.S. historical region)|Jackson Purchase]]). He was one of the three original investors who founded [[Memphis, Tennessee]] in 1819 (see [[History of Memphis, Tennessee]]).<ref>Blythe Semmer, [http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=698 "Jackson Purchase"], ''[[Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture]]''</ref>

==Military career==

===War of 1812===
{{Main|Creek War|Battle of New Orleans}}
Jackson was appointed commander of the Tennessee militia in 1801, with the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. He was later elected major general of the Tennessee militia in 1802.<ref>Buchanan, John. (2001). ''Jackson's Way: Andrew Jackson and the People of the Western Waters. New York: John Wiley & Son, Inc. p. 165-166.</ref>

During the [[War of 1812]], the [[Shawnee]] [[Tribal chief|chief]] [[Tecumseh]] encouraged the "[[Red Stick]]" Creek Indians of northern Alabama and Georgia to attack white settlements. He had unified tribes in the [[Northwest Territory|Northwest]] to rise up against the Americans, trying to repel European American settlers from those lands north of the Ohio. Four hundred settlers were killed in the [[Fort Mims massacre]]. In the resulting [[Creek War]], Jackson commanded the American forces, which included Tennessee militia, U.S. [[Regular Army (United States)|regulars]], and [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], and [[Lower Creek]] warriors. [[Sam Houston]] and [[David Crockett]] served under Jackson in this campaign.

Jackson defeated the Red Sticks at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] in 1814. US forces and their allies killed 800 Red Stick warriors in this battle, but Jackson spared the chief [[William Weatherford|Red Eagle]], a mixed-race man also known as [[William Weatherford]]. After the victory, Jackson imposed the [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]] upon both the Upper Creek enemies and the Lower Creek allies, wresting twenty million acres (81,000&nbsp;km²) in present-day Georgia and Alabama from all the Creek for European-American settlement. Jackson was appointed Major General after this action.

According to author [[Gloria Jahoda]], the Creeks coined their own name for him, ''Jacksa Chula Harjo''  "Jackson, old and fierce".<ref>Jahoda, Gloria. ''The Trail of Tears: The Story of the American Indian Removals 1813-1855''. Holt, Rinehart and Winston. New York. 1975 ISBN 0-03-014871-5.</ref>

[[File:Battle of New Orleans.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Battle of New Orleans]]''. General Andrew Jackson stands on the parapet of his makeshift defenses as his troops repulse attacking [[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|Highlanders]], by painter [[Edward Percy Moran]] in 1910.]]
Jackson's service in the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom was conspicuous for bravery and success. When British forces threatened [[New Orleans]], Jackson took command of the defenses, including militia from several western states and territories. He was a strict officer but was popular with his troops. They said he was "tough as old hickory" wood on the battlefield, and he acquired the nickname of "Old Hickory". In the [[Battle of New Orleans]] on January 8, 1815, Jackson's 5,000 soldiers won a decisive victory over 7,500 British. At the end of the battle, the British had 2,037 casualties: 291 dead (including three senior generals), 1,262 wounded, and 484 captured or missing. The Americans had 71 casualties: 13 dead, 39 wounded, and 19 missing.<ref>Remini, Robert V. (1999). ''The Battle of New Orleans''. New York: Penguin Books. p. 285</ref>

==== Constitutional Crisis ====
{{original research|section|date=July 2013}}
Jackson ordered the arrest of U. S. District Court Judge Dominick Hall in March, 1815, after the judge signed a writ of [[habeas corpus]] on behalf of a Louisiana legislator that Jackson had arrested.<ref>See, e.g., Martin, François-Xavier ''The History of Louisiana, from the Earliest Period'', Vol. 2 p. 387-495 (New Orleans, 1829), http://books.google.com/books?id=209UAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=martin's+history+of+louisiana&hl=en&sa=X&ei=V1fVUa3hAsquqAGIxoGACw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false
</ref> Louis Louaillier had written an anonymous piece in the New Orleans newspaper, challenging Jackson's refusal to release the militia, after the British ceded the field of battle.<ref>See, e.g., Warshauer, Matthew, Andrew Jackson and the Politics of Martial Law, Univ. of Tenn. Press, 2006, p. 32 ff</ref> Jackson had claimed the authority to declare [[martial law]] over the entire City of New Orleans, not merely his "camp."<ref>See, e.g., ''The Appeal of Louis Louaillier, Sen., Against the Charge of High Treason'', (New Orleans), 1827 http://books.google.com/books?id=4bbU68Z1knEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=louis+louaillier&hl=en&sa=X&ei=I4_UUb2-L5Hg8AS9yoHwDQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA</ref> After ordering the arrest of a Louisiana legislator, a federal judge, a lawyer and after intervention of [[Joshua Lewis (judge)]], a State Judge, who was simultaneously serving under Jackson in the militia, and who also signed a writ of habeas corpus against Jackson, his commanding officer, seeking Judge Hall's release, Jackson relented.<ref>See, e.g., Eaton, Fernin, ''For Whom the Drone Tolls or What if Andrew Jackson had Drones at the Battle of New Orleans, A Bit of Bicentennial Mischief'', http://academia.edu/3701970/For_Whom_the_Drone_Tolls_or_What_if_Andrew_Jackson_Had_Drones_at_the_Battle_of_New_Orleans--A_bit_of_Bicentennial_Mischief</ref>

Civilian authorities in New Orleans had reason to fear Jackson. But they fared better than did the six members of the militia whose executions, ordered by Jackson, would surface as the [[Coffin Handbills]] during his 1828 Presidential campaign.<ref>See, e.g., http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2008661734/</ref> Nonetheless, Jackson became a national hero for his actions in this battle and the War of 1812. He received the [[Thanks of Congress]] and a gold medal by resolution of February 27, 1815. [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] later commented in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' that Jackson "...was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans."

===First Seminole War===
{{Main|Seminole Wars}}

Jackson served in the military again during the [[First Seminole War]]. He was ordered by President [[James Monroe]] in December 1817 to lead a campaign in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] against the [[Seminole]] and Creek Indians. Jackson was also charged with preventing [[Spanish Florida]] from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves. Critics later alleged that Jackson exceeded orders in his Florida actions. His directions were to "terminate the conflict".<ref>Remini, 118.</ref> Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida. Before going, Jackson wrote to Monroe, "Let it be signified to me through any channel&nbsp;... that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished."<ref>Ogg, 66.</ref> Monroe gave Jackson orders that were purposely ambiguous, sufficient for international denials.

[[File:Bustofandrewjackson.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Military governor Jackson was sworn in at [[Plaza Ferdinand VII]] in [[Pensacola, Florida]]]]

The Seminole attacked Jackson's Tennessee volunteers. The Seminole attack left their villages vulnerable, and Jackson burned their houses and the crops. He found letters that indicated that the Spanish and British were secretly assisting the Indians. Jackson believed that the United States could not be secure as long as Spain and the United Kingdom encouraged Indians to fight, and argued that his actions were undertaken in self-defense. Jackson captured [[Pensacola, Florida]], with little more than some warning shots, and deposed the Spanish governor. He captured and then tried and executed two British subjects, [[Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident|Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot]], who had been supplying and advising the Indians. Jackson's actions struck fear into the Seminole tribes as word spread of his ruthlessness in battle (he became known as "Sharp Knife").

The executions, and Jackson's invasion of territory belonging to Spain, a country with which the U.S. was not at war, created an international incident. Many in the Monroe administration called for Jackson to be [[Censure in the United States|censured]]. The [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[John Quincy Adams]], an early believer in [[Manifest Destiny]], defended Jackson. When the Spanish minister demanded a "suitable punishment" for Jackson, Adams wrote back, "Spain must immediately [decide] either to place a force in Florida adequate at once to the protection of her territory ... or cede to the United States a province, of which she retains nothing but the nominal possession, but which is, in fact ... a post of annoyance to them."<ref>{{cite web |title=Jefferson and His Colleagues |url=http://etext.virginia.edu/jefferson/grizzard/johnson/johnson13.html |accessdate=October 11, 2006 |last=Johnson |first=Allen |year=1920}}</ref> Adams used Jackson's conquest, and Spain's own weakness, to get Spain to cede Florida to the United States by the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]]. Jackson was subsequently named Florida's military governor and served from March 10, 1821, to December 31, 1821.

==Election of 1824==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1824}}
[[File:Andrew Jackson.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jackson in 1824, painting by [[Thomas Sully]]]]

The Tennessee legislature nominated Jackson for President in 1822. It also elected him U.S. Senator again.
By 1824, the Democratic-Republican Party had become the only functioning national party. Its Presidential candidates had been chosen by an informal [[Congressional nominating caucus]], but this had become unpopular. In 1824, most of the Democratic-Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus. Those who attended backed Treasury Secretary [[William H. Crawford]] for President and [[Albert Gallatin]] for Vice President. A Pennsylvania convention nominated Jackson for President a month later, stating that the irregular caucus ignored the "voice of the people" and was a "vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he [Crawford] was the regular democratic candidate".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rutland |first=Robert Allen |title=The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton |pages=48–49 |year=1995 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |isbn=0-8262-1034-1}}</ref> Gallatin criticized Jackson as "an honest man and the idol of the worshippers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for the office".<ref>Adams, Henry. ''The Life of Albert Gallatin'' (1879), 599.</ref>

Besides Jackson and Crawford, the Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and House Speaker [[Henry Clay]] were also candidates. Jackson received the most popular votes (but not a majority, and four states had no popular ballot). The [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] were split four ways, with Jackson having a plurality. Because no candidate received a majority, the election was decided by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], which chose Adams. Jackson supporters denounced this result as a "[[corrupt bargain]]" because Clay gave his state's support to Adams, who subsequently appointed Clay as Secretary of State. As none of Kentucky's electors had initially voted for Adams, and Jackson had won the popular vote, some Kentucky politicians criticized Clay for violating the will of the people in return for personal political favors. Jackson's defeat burnished his political credentials, however; many voters believed the "man of the people" had been robbed by the "corrupt aristocrats of the East".{{clear}}

==Election of 1828==
[[File:Andrew Jackson statue County Courthouse KC Missouri.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Equestrian statue]] of Gen. Jackson, Jackson County Courthouse, [[Kansas City, Missouri]]]]
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1828}}

Jackson resigned from the Senate in October 1825, but continued his quest for the Presidency. The Tennessee legislature again nominated Jackson for President. Jackson attracted Vice President [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Martin Van Buren]], and [[Thomas Ritchie]] into his camp (Van Buren and Ritchie were previous supporters of Crawford). Van Buren, with help from his friends in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], revived the old Republican Party, gave it a new name as the Democratic Party, "restored party rivalries", and forged a national organization of durability.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rutland |first=Robert Allen |title=The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton |pages=55–56 |year=1995 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |isbn=0-8262-1034-1}}</ref> The Jackson coalition handily defeated Adams in 1828.

During the election, Jackson's opponents referred to him as a "[[Donkey|jackass]]". Jackson liked the name and used the jackass as a symbol for a while, but it died out. However, it later became the symbol for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] when cartoonist [[Thomas Nast]] popularized it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/questions/week174.htm |last=Nickels|first=Ilona|title=How did Republicans pick the elephant, and Democrats the donkey, to represent their parties? |work=Capitol Questions |publisher=C-SPAN|date=September 5, 2000 |accessdate=September 6, 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20001021094719/http://c-span.org/questions/Week174.htm|archivedate=October 21, 2000}}</ref>

The campaign was very much a personal one. As was the custom at the time, neither candidate personally campaigned, but their political followers organized many campaign events. Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press, which reached a low point when the press accused Jackson's wife [[Rachel Jackson|Rachel]] of bigamy. Though the accusation was true, as were most personal attacks leveled against him during the campaign, it was based on events that occurred many years prior (1791 to 1794). Jackson said he would forgive those who insulted him, but he would never forgive the ones who attacked his wife. Rachel died suddenly on December 22, 1828, before his inauguration, and was buried on Christmas Eve.

===Inauguration===
{{Main|First inauguration of Andrew Jackson}}
Jackson was the first President to invite the public to attend the [[White House]] ball honoring his first inauguration. Many poor people came to the inaugural ball in their homemade clothes. The crowd became so large that Jackson's guards could not keep them out of the White House, which became so crowded with people that dishes and decorative pieces inside were eventually broken. Some people stood on good chairs in muddied boots just to get a look at the President. The crowd had become so wild that the attendants poured punch in tubs and put it on the White House lawn to lure people outside. Jackson's raucous populism earned him the nickname "King Mob".

==Election of 1832==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1832}}
In the 1832 presidential election, Jackson easily{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} won reelection as the candidate of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] against [[Henry Clay]], of the [[National Republican Party]], and [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]], of the [[Anti-Masonic Party]]. The Anti-Masonic Party used Northern sentiment against [[Freemasonry]] to attack Jackson,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} who was a [[Freemasonry|Mason]]. [[John C. Calhoun]], Vice President under John Quincy Adams and during part of Jackson's first term, had resigned over differences with Jackson, particularly over [[Nullification Crisis|nullification]] and the [[Petticoat affair]];{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Jackson replaced him with longtime confidant [[Martin Van Buren]] of New York.

===Federal debt===
{{See also|Panic of 1837}}

===Electoral College===
Jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to Congress as President.<ref name=firstaddress>{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson's First Annual Message to Congress |publisher=The American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29471 |accessdate=March 14, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080226130931/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29471| archivedate= February 26, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson's Second Annual Message to Congress |publisher=The American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29472 |accessdate=March 14, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080311113901/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29472| archivedate= March 11, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In his third annual message to Congress, he expressed the view "I have heretofore recommended amendments of the [[United States Constitution|Federal Constitution]] giving the election of President and Vice-President to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term.

===Spoils system===
{{Main|Spoils system}}
When Jackson became President, he implemented the theory of [[rotation in office]] for political appointments, declaring it "a leading principle in the republican creed".<ref name="firstaddress"/> He believed that rotation in office would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy. Opposed to this view however, were Jackson's supporters who in order to strengthen party loyalty wanted to give the posts to other party members. In practice, this would have meant the continuation of the patronage system by replacing federal employees with friends or party loyalists.<ref>The [[Spoils system]], as the rotation in office system was called, did not originate with Jackson. It originated with New York governors in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (most notably [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] and [[DeWitt Clinton]]). [[Thomas Jefferson]] brought it to the [[Executive Branch]] when he replaced Federalist office-holders after becoming President. [http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h965.html The Spoils System versus the Merit System.] Retrieved on November 21, 2006.</ref> By the end of his first four years, Jackson had dismissed nearly 20% of the Federal employees who were working at the start of his first term, replacing them with political appointees from his party. This resulted in the appointment of many functionaries who had no training or experience in the fields for which they were now responsible for administering.<ref>[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=637 Jacksonian Democracy: The Presidency of Andrew Jackson]. Retrieved on November 21, 2006.</ref> While Jackson did not start the "spoils system", the political realities of Washington did in the end force him to encourage its growth despite personal reservations.

===Opposition to the National Bank===
{{Main|Bank War}}
[[File:Andrew Jackson Slays a Monster Bank.jpg|thumb|Democratic cartoon shows Jackson fighting the monster Bank. "The Bank", Jackson told [[Martin Van Buren]], "is trying to kill me, but I will kill it!"]]
[[File:1832bank1.jpg|thumb|1833 Democratic cartoon shows Jackson destroying the [[Second Bank of the United States|devil's Bank]]]]

The [[Second Bank of the United States]] was authorized for a 20-year period during [[James Madison]]'s tenure in 1816. As President, Jackson worked to rescind the bank's federal charter. In Jackson's veto message, the bank needed to be abolished because:
* It concentrated the nation's financial strength in a single institution,
* It exposed the government to control by foreign interests,
* It served mainly to make the rich richer,
* It exercised too much control over members of Congress,
* It favored northeastern states over southern and western states,
* Banks are controlled by a few select families.

Following Jefferson, Jackson supported an "agricultural republic" and felt the Bank improved the fortunes of an "elite circle" of commercial and industrial entrepreneurs at the expense of farmers and laborers. After a titanic struggle, Jackson succeeded in destroying the Bank by vetoing its 1832 re-charter by Congress and by withdrawing U.S. funds in 1833. (See [[Banking in the Jacksonian Era]])

The bank's money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that sprang up. This increased credit and speculation. At first, as Jackson withdrew money from the Bank to invest it in other banks, land sales, canal construction, cotton production, and manufacturing boomed.<ref name="digitalhistory">{{cite web|author=Digital History, Steven Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=640 |title=Digital History |publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref> Then, in 1836, Jackson issued the [[Specie Circular]], which required buyers of government lands to pay in "specie" (gold or silver coins). The result was a great demand for specie, which many banks did not have enough of to exchange for their notes. These banks collapsed.<ref name="digitalhistory"/> This was a direct cause of the [[Panic of 1837]], which threw the national economy into a deep [[Depression (economics)|depression]]. It took years for the economy to recover from the damage.<ref>W. J. Rorabaugh, Donald T. Critchlow, Paula C. Baker (2004). "''[http://books.google.com/books?id=VL_6X5zWOokC&pg=PA210&dq=PA349&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false America's promise: a concise history of the United States]''". Rowman & Littlefield. p.210. ISBN 0-7425-1189-8</ref>

The U.S. Senate censured Jackson on March 28, 1834, for his action in removing U.S. funds from the Bank of the United States. When the Jacksonians had a majority in the Senate, the censure was expunged.

===Nullification crisis===
{{Main|Nullification Crisis}}
Another notable crisis during Jackson's period of office was the "[[Nullification Crisis]]", or "secession crisis", of 1828&nbsp;– 1832, which merged issues of sectional strife with disagreements over tariffs. Critics alleged that high tariffs (the "[[Tariff of Abominations]]") on imports of common manufactured goods made in Europe made those goods more expensive than ones from the northern U.S., raising the prices paid by planters in the South. Southern politicians argued that tariffs benefited northern industrialists at the expense of southern farmers.

The issue came to a head when Vice President Calhoun, in the [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]] of 1828, supported the claim of his home state, [[South Carolina]], that it had the right to "nullify"—declare void—the tariff legislation of 1828, and more generally the right of a state to nullify any Federal laws that went against its interests. Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he also vigorously supported a strong union, with effective powers for the central government. Jackson attempted to face down Calhoun over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men.

Particularly notable was an incident at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts. [[Robert Hayne]] began by toasting to "The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States". Jackson then rose, and in a booming voice added "Our federal Union: It must be preserved!"&nbsp;– a clear challenge to Calhoun. Calhoun clarified his position by responding "The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!"<ref>Ogg, 164.</ref>

[[File:Andrew Jackson Presidential $1 Coin obverse.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Presidential $1 Coin Program|Jackson Presidential Dollar]]]]
Jackson's alliance with Calhoun was further strained by what became known as the [[Petticoat affair]]; [[Floride Calhoun]], the Vice President's wife, led several other Cabinet members and their wives in the social ostracism of Secretary of War [[John H. Eaton]] and his wife, [[Margaret O'Neill Eaton]]. The internal roil eventually led Eaton to resign and caused the purge of the several pro-Calhoun cabinet members by Jackson. As a strategic move [[Martin Van Buren]] resigned (as Secretary of State) but remained a close confident of Jackson; he helped organize and played a leading role in the Jackson's unofficial [[Kitchen Cabinet]]<ref>Meacham, pages 171-175;</ref>

At the [[1832 Democratic National Convention|first Democratic National Convention]], which was privately engineered by members of the Kitchen Cabinet, Calhoun and Jackson broke from each other politically and Van Buren replaced Calhoun as Jackson's running mate in the [[United States presidential election, 1832|1832 presidential election]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Parton |first=James | author-link=James Parton |title=Life of Andrew Jackson |volume=3 |pages=381–385 |year=2006 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=1-4286-3929-2}}. First published in 1860.</ref> In December 1832, Calhoun resigned as Vice President to become a U.S. Senator for South Carolina.

In response to South Carolina's nullification claim, Jackson vowed to send troops to [[South Carolina]] to enforce the laws. In December, 1832, he issued a resounding proclamation against the "nullifiers", stating that he considered "the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed". South Carolina, the President declared, stood on "the brink of insurrection and treason", and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought. Jackson also denied the right of secession: "The Constitution... forms a ''government'' not a league... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation."<ref>Syrett, 36. See also: {{cite web |title=President Jackson's Proclamation Regarding Nullification, December&nbsp;10, 1832 |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/presiden/proclamations/jack01.htm |accessdate=August 10, 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060824095525/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/presiden/proclamations/jack01.htm| archivedate= August 24, 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Jackson asked Congress to pass a "[[Force Bill]]" explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff, but its passage was delayed until [[protectionism|protectionists]] led by Clay agreed to a reduced Compromise Tariff. The Force Bill and Compromise Tariff passed on March 1, 1833, and Jackson signed both. The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance. The Force Bill became moot because it was no longer needed.  On May 1, 1833, Jackson wrote, "the tariff was only the pretext, and [[Secession in the United States|disunion]] and [[Confederate States of America|southern confederacy]] the real object.  The next pretext will be the negro, or [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] question."<ref>[[Jon Meacham]] (2009), [[American Lion (book)|American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House]], New York:  Random House, p. 247; ''Correspondence of Andrew Jackson'', Vol. V, p. 72.</ref>

===Indian removal===
{{Main|Indian removal}}
Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Jackson's presidency was his policy regarding [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], which historians see as amounting to the [[ethnic cleansing]] of several Indian tribes.<ref>In particular, see Schama (2008) pp. 325–326</ref><ref>For an attack on Jackson see Cave (2003). 65(6): 1330–1353</ref><ref>For the defense of Jackson see Remini (2001), and F. P. Prucha, "Andrew Jackson's Indian Policy: A Reassessment", ''Journal of American History'', (1969) 56(3): 527–539 {{Jstor|1904204}}</ref> Jackson was a leading advocate of a policy known as Indian removal. Jackson had been negotiating treaties and removal policies with Indian leaders for years before his election as president. Many tribes and portions of tribes had been removed to Arkansas Territory and further west of the Mississippi River without the suffering of what later became known as the [[Trail of Tears]]. Further, many white Americans advocated total extermination of the "savages", particularly those who had experienced frontier wars. Jackson's support of removal policies can be best understood by examination of those prior cases he had personally negotiated, rather than those in post-presidential years. Nevertheless, Jackson is often held responsible for all that took place in the 1830s.

In his December 8, 1829, First Annual Message to Congress, Jackson stated:

{{quote|This emigration should be voluntary, for it would be as cruel as unjust to compel the aborigines to abandon the graves of their fathers and seek a home in a distant land. But they should be distinctly informed that if they remain within the limits of the States they must be subject to their laws. In return for their obedience as individuals they will without doubt be protected in the enjoyment of those possessions which they have improved by their industry.<ref name=firstaddress />}}

Before his election as president, Jackson had been involved with the issue of Indian removal for over ten years. The removal of the Native Americans to the west of the [[Mississippi River]] had been a major part of his political agenda in both the 1824 and 1828 presidential elections.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson and the Course of American Freedom, 1822–1832'' pp. 117, 200</ref> After his election he signed the [[Indian Removal Act]] into law in 1830. The Act authorized the President to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands further west, outside of existing U.S. state borders.

While frequently frowned upon in the North, and opposed by [[Jeremiah Evarts]] and [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]], the Removal Act was popular in the [[Southern United States|South]], where population growth and the discovery of gold on [[Cherokee]] land had increased pressure on tribal lands. The state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] became involved in a contentious jurisdictional dispute with the Cherokees, culminating in the 1832 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision (''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]''), which ruled that Georgia could not impose its laws upon Cherokee tribal lands. Jackson is often quoted (regarding the decision) as having said, "[[John Marshall]] has made his decision, now let him enforce it!" According to Remini, Jackson never said this, as the quote first appeared in [[Horace Greeley|Horace Greeley's]] ''The American Conflict'' in 1864.<ref>Robert V. Remini, ''The Life of Andrew Jackson'' (1988), p. 216</ref><ref>Cave (2003).</ref>

[[File:78yo Andrew Jackson.jpg|thumb|upright|Photograph of Jackson at age 78, 1844/45]]
In any case, Jackson used the Georgia crisis to pressure Cherokee leaders to sign a removal treaty. A small faction of Cherokees led by [[John Ridge]] negotiated the [[Treaty of New Echota]] with Jackson's representatives. Ridge was not a recognized leader of the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]], and this document was rejected by most Cherokees as illegitimate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicaldocuments.com/IndianRemovalAct.htm |title=Historical Documents – The Indian Removal Act of 1830 |publisher=Historicaldocuments.com |date= |accessdate=November 1, 2008}}</ref> Over 15,000 Cherokees signed a petition in protest of the proposed removal; the list was ignored by the Supreme Court and the U.S. legislature, in part due to delays and timing.<ref name=PBS-JDIR>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2959.html |title=Indian Removal|work=Judgment Day|publisher=PBS|accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref> The treaty was enforced by Jackson's successor, Van Buren, who ordered 7,000 armed troops to remove the Cherokees. Due to the infighting between political factions, many Cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered until troops arrived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synaptic.bc.ca/ejournal/jackson.htm |title=Andrew Jackson Speaks: Indian Removal |work=The Nomadic Spirit|accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref> This abrupt and forced removal resulted in the deaths of over 4,000 Cherokees on the "[[Trail of Tears]]".

[[File:A Jackson-restored.png|left|thumb|upright|A [[daguerreotype]] of Jackson.]]
By the 1830s, under constant pressure from settlers, each of the five southern tribes had ceded most of its lands, but sizable self-government groups lived in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. All of these (except the Seminoles) had moved far in the coexistence with whites, and they resisted suggestions that they should voluntarily remove themselves. Their nonviolent methods earned them the title the [[Five Civilized Tribes]].<ref name=PBS-JDIR />

More than 45,000 American Indians were relocated to the West during Jackson's administration. A few Cherokees escaped forced relocation, or walked back afterwards, escaping to the high [[Great Smoky Mountains|Smoky Mountains]] along the [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]] border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cherokee-nc.com/index.php?page=56 |title=Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians – History |publisher=Cherokee-nc.com |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref>

Jackson's administration bought about 100&nbsp;million acres (400,000&nbsp;km²) of Indian land for about $68&nbsp;million and 32&nbsp;million acres (130,000&nbsp;km²) of western land. Jackson was criticized at the time for his role in these events, and the criticism has grown over the years. U.S. historian [[Robert V. Remini]] characterizes the Indian Removal era as "one of the unhappiest chapters in American history".<ref>Remini (2001).</ref>

===Attack and assassination attempt===
[[File:JacksonAssassinationAttempt.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Lawrence (failed assassin)|Richard Lawrence]]'s attempt on Jackson's life, as depicted in an 1835 etching.]]

The first presidential attack was against Jackson. Jackson ordered the dismissal of Robert B. Randolph from the [[United States Navy|Navy]] for [[embezzlement]]. On May 6, 1833, Jackson sailed on USS ''Cygnet'' to [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of [[Mary Ball Washington]], [[George Washington]]'s mother. During a stopover near [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], Randolph appeared and struck the President. He fled the scene chased by several members of Jackson's party, including the well-known writer [[Washington Irving]]. Jackson decided not to press charges.<ref name=Paletta/>

On January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the [[United States Capitol]]. When Jackson was leaving through the East Portico after the funeral of [[South Carolina]] Representative [[Warren R. Davis]], [[Richard Lawrence (failed assassin)|Richard Lawrence]], an unemployed housepainter from England, aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired. Lawrence pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired. Historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring.<ref name="AmericanHeritage.com">{{cite web | title=Trying to Assassinate Andrew Jackson | author=Jon Grinspan | url=http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20070130-richard-lawrence-andrew-jackson-assassination-warren-r-davis.shtml| accessdate=November 11, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081024234731/http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20070130-richard-lawrence-andrew-jackson-assassination-warren-r-davis.shtml| archivedate= October 24, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Lawrence was restrained, and legend says that Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane. Others present, including [[Davy Crockett|David Crockett]], restrained and disarmed Lawrence.

Lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting. He blamed Jackson for the loss of his job. He claimed that with the President dead, "money would be more plenty" (a reference to Jackson's struggle with the Bank of the United States) and that he "could not rise until the President fell". Finally, he told his interrogators that he was a deposed English King—specifically, [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], dead since 1485—and that Jackson was his clerk. He was deemed insane and institutionalized.

Afterward, due to public curiosity concerning the double misfires, the pistols were tested and retested. Each time they performed perfectly. Many believed that Jackson had been protected by the same [[Divine providence|Providence]] that protected the young nation. This national pride was a large part of the Jacksonian cultural myth fueling American expansion in the 1830s.

===Judicial appointments===
{{Main|List of federal judges appointed by Andrew Jackson}}
In total Jackson appointed 24 federal judges: six Justices to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and eighteen judges to the [[United States district court]]s.

===Regrets===
On the last day of the presidency, Jackson admitted that he had but two regrets, that he "had been unable to shoot Henry Clay or to hang John C. Calhoun."<ref>Borneman, Walter R. ''Polk: The Man Who Transformed the Presidency and America''. New York: Random House, 2008 ISBN 978-1-4000-6560-8, p. 36.</ref>

==Family and personal life==
[[File:Andrew Jackson-1844-2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Daguerreotype]] of Andrew Jackson at age 77 or 78 (1844 or 1845)]]

Shortly after Jackson first arrived in Nashville in 1788, he lived as a boarder with Rachel Stockley Donelson, the widow of [[John Donelson]]. Here Jackson became acquainted with their daughter, [[Rachel Jackson|Rachel Donelson Robards]]. At the time, Rachel was in an unhappy marriage with Captain Lewis Robards; he was subject to fits of jealous rage.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kathleen Kennedy|author2=Sharon Rena Ullman|title=Sexual Borderlands: Constructing an American Sexual Past|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3sWFu3IchEMC&pg=PA99|year=2003|publisher=Ohio State University Press|pages=99–101}}</ref> The two were separated in 1790. According to Jackson, he married Rachel after hearing that Robards had obtained a divorce. However, the divorce had never been completed, making Rachel's marriage to Jackson bigamous and therefore invalid. After the divorce was officially completed, Rachel and Jackson remarried in 1794.<ref>Remini, 17–25</ref> To complicate matters further, evidence shows that Rachel had been living with Jackson and referred to herself as Mrs. Jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made.<ref>{{cite book

</ref> It was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially, as long as they were recognized by the community.

The controversy surrounding their marriage remained a sore point for Jackson, who deeply resented attacks on his wife’s honor.  By May 1806, [[Charles Dickinson (historical figure)|Charles Dickinson]] had published an attack on Jackson in the local newspaper, and it resulted in a written challenge from Jackson to a [[duel]]. Since Dickinson was considered an expert shot, Jackson determined it would be best to let Dickinson turn and fire first, hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness; Jackson would wait and take careful aim at Dickinson. Dickinson did fire first, hitting Jackson in the chest. Under the rules of dueling, Dickinson had to remain still as Jackson took aim and shot and killed him. However, the bullet that struck Jackson was so close to his heart that it could never be safely removed. Jackson's behavior in the duel outraged men of honor in Tennessee, who called it a brutal, cold-blooded killing and saddled Jackson with a reputation as a fearful, violent, vengeful man.  He became a social outcast.<ref>H.W. Brands, ''Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times'' (2005) pp 139-43</ref>

Rachel died of a heart attack on December 22, 1828, two weeks after her husband's victory in the election and two months before Jackson took office as President. Jackson blamed [[John Quincy Adams]] for Rachel's death because the episode ridiculing his wife was repeatedly used in the campaign of 1828. He felt that this had hastened her death and never forgave Adams.<ref>Robert Remini, ''John Quincy Adams'' (2002) p. 119</ref>

Jackson’s quick temper was notorious.  Brands says, "His audacity on behalf of the people earned him enemies who slandered him and defamed even his wife, Rachel.  He dueled in her defense and his own, suffering grievous wounds that left him with bullet fragments lodged about his body."<ref>H. W.  Brands, Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times (2005) p x</ref>

Jackson had three adopted sons: Theodore, an Indian about whom little is known,<ref name="Theodore">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U5_y_jPH-QMC&pg=PA198&dq=Andrew+Jackson+indian+theodore&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NtEZT6bnD4fyggfulajuCw&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Andrew%20Jackson%20indian%20theodore&f=false|title=Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times|author=Brands, H.W.|page=198|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2005|isbn=1-4000-3072-2}}</ref> Andrew Jackson Jr., the son of Rachel's brother Severn Donelson, and Lyncoya, a Creek Indian orphan adopted by Jackson after the Creek War. Lyncoya died of tuberculosis in 1828, at the age of sixteen.<ref>Remini 1:194</ref>

[[File:Tennessee Gentleman portrait of Andrew Jackson by Ralph E. W. Earl.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Tennessee Gentleman'', portrait of Jackson, ca. 1831, from the collection of [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]].]]
The Jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children. John Samuel Donelson, [[Daniel Smith Donelson]] and [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]] were the sons of Rachel's brother Samuel Donelson, who died in 1804. Andrew Jackson Hutchings was Rachel's orphaned grand nephew. Caroline Butler, Eliza Butler, Edward Butler, and Anthony Butler were the orphaned children of Edward Butler, a family friend. They came to live with the Jacksons after the death of their father.<ref>''The Papers of Andrew Jackson: 1821–1824'' ed. Sam B. Smith, (1996) p 71</ref>

The widower Jackson invited Rachel's niece [[Emily Donelson]] to serve as host at the White House. Emily was married to [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]], who acted as Jackson's private secretary and in 1856 would run for Vice President on the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] ticket. The relationship between the President and Emily became strained during the [[Petticoat affair]], and the two became estranged for over a year. They eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House host. [[Sarah Yorke Jackson]], the wife of Andrew Jackson Jr., became cohost of the White House in 1834. It was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial First Lady. Sarah took over all hosting duties after Emily died from tuberculosis in 1836. Jackson used [[Rip Raps]] as a retreat, visiting between August 19, 1829 through August 16, 1835.<ref>Meacham, page 109; 315</ref>

Jackson remained influential in both national and state politics after retiring to [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]] in 1837. Jackson remained a firm advocate of the federal union of the states, and rejected any talk of secession. "I will die with the Union", he always insisted.<ref>James C. Curtis, ''Andrew Jackson and the search for vindication'' (1976) p 145</ref>

[[File:Andrew Jackson Tomb.jpg|thumb|upright|The tomb of Andrew and [[Rachel Donelson Jackson]] located at their home, [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]].]]
Jackson was a lean figure standing at 6 feet, 1&nbsp;inch (1.85 m) tall, and weighing between 130 and 140 pounds (64&nbsp;kg) on average. Jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair, which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age 61. He had penetrating deep blue eyes. Jackson was one of the more sickly presidents, suffering from chronic headaches, abdominal pains, and a hacking cough, caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed, that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake. About a year after retiring the presidency,<ref>{{cite book |title=Andrew Jackson |first=Sean |last= Wilentz |publisher=Macmillan |year= 2005 |page=160}}</ref> Jackson became a member of the [[Downtown Presbyterian Church, Nashville|First Presbyterian Church]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. He enjoyed eight years of retirement until his death at [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]] on June 8, 1845, at the age of 78, of chronic tuberculosis, [[dropsy]], and [[heart failure]].

Jackson was a Freemason, having been initiated at Masonic Lodge, Harmony No. 1 in Tennessee; he also participated in chartering several other lodges in Tennessee. He was the only U.S. president to have been a Grandmaster of a State Lodge until [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1945. His Masonic apron is on display in the Tennessee State Museum. An obelisk and bronze Masonic plaque decorate his tomb at The Hermitage.<ref name="Tennessee State History">{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Andrew|title=Tennessee History|url=http://www.tennesseehistory.com/class/Jackson.htm|work=Masonic Research|publisher=tennesseehistory.com|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=GLBC&Y>[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/textfiles/famous.html Grand Lodge of British Columbia & Yukon's "A few famous freemasons" page]</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Masonic Presidents, Andrew Jackson| url=http://www.pagrandlodge.org/mlam/presidents/jackson.html| accessdate= 28 July 2012}}</ref>

In his will, Jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son, Andrew Jackson Jr., except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various other friends and family members.

==Jackson on U.S. postage==
Andrew Jackson is one of the few American presidents ever to appear on US Postage more than the usual two or three times. He died in 1845, but the U.S. Post Office did not release a [[US Presidents on US postage stamps|postage stamp]] in his honor until 18 years after his death, with the [[U.S. Presidents on U.S. Postage stamps#First appearances|issue of 1863]], a 2-cent black issue, commonly referred to by collectors as the '[[Black Jack (stamp)|Black Jack]]'. In contrast, the first [[Warren G. Harding]] stamp was released only one month after his death, Lincoln, one year exactly. As Jackson was a controversial figure in his day there is speculation that officials in Washington chose to wait a period of time before issuing a stamp with his portrait. In all, Jackson has appeared on [[US Presidents on US postage stamps#Andrew Jackson|thirteen different U.S. postage stamps]], more than that of most US presidents and second only to the number of times Washington, Franklin and Lincoln have appeared.<ref>Scotts US Stamp Catalogue</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Alexander&nbsp;T.&nbsp;Haimann,&nbsp;National Postal Museum |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&cmd=1&img=&mode=1&pg=1&tid=2027716 |title=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |publisher=Arago.si.edu |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}</ref> During the American Civil War the Confederate government also issued two [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States|Confederate postage stamps]] bearing Jackson's portrait, one a [[:File:Red Jack-2c.jpg|2-cent red stamp]] and the other a [[:File:Csa jackson 1862-2c.jpg|2-cent green stamp]], both issued in 1863.<ref>{{cite web|author=Patricia Kaufmann |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&cmd=1&mode=1&tid=2027898 |title=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |publisher=Arago.si.edu |date=2006-05-09 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}</ref>
