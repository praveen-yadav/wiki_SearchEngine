{{pp-move-indef}}{{Infobox chlorine}}
'''Chlorine''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&nbsp;'''Cl''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;17. Chlorine is in the [[halogen|halogen group (17)]] and is the second lightest halogen after [[fluorine]]. The element is a yellow-green gas under standard conditions, where it forms diatomic molecules. It has the highest [[electron affinity]] and the third highest [[electronegativity]] of all the reactive elements; for this reason, chlorine is a strong [[oxidizing agent]]. Free chlorine is rare on Earth, and is usually a result of direct or indirect [[oxidation]] by [[oxygen]].

The most common compound of chlorine, [[sodium chloride]] (common salt), has been known since ancient times. Around 1630 chlorine gas was first synthesized in a chemical reaction, but not recognized as a fundamentally important substance. Characterization of chlorine gas was made in 1774 by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], who supposed it to be an [[oxide]] of a new element. In 1809 chemists suggested that the gas might be a pure element, and this was confirmed by [[Sir Humphry Davy]] in 1810, who named it from {{lang-grc|χλωρóς|khlôros|pale green}}.

Nearly all chlorine in the Earth's crust occurs as chloride in various [[ion]]ic compounds, including [[table salt]]. It is the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|second most abundant halogen and 21<sup>st</sup> most abundant chemical element]] in Earth's crust. Elemental chlorine is commercially produced from [[brine]] by [[electrolysis]]. The high oxidizing potential of elemental chlorine led commercially to free chlorine's [[Bleach (chemical)|bleaching]] and disinfectant uses, as well as its many uses of an essential reagent in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products, about two-thirds of them organic chemicals such as [[polyvinyl chloride]], as well as many intermediates for production of [[plastics]] and other end products which do not contain the element. As a common disinfectant, elemental chlorine and chlorine-generating compounds are used more directly in [[swimming pool]]s to keep them clean and [[swimming pool sanitation|sanitary]].

In the form of [[chloride]] [[ions]], chlorine is necessary to all known species of life. Other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living organisms, and artificially produced chlorinated organics range from inert to toxic. In the [[upper atmosphere]], chlorine-containing organic molecules such as [[chlorofluorocarbons]] have been implicated in [[ozone depletion]]. Small quantities of elemental chlorine are generated by oxidation of chloride to [[hypochlorite]] in [[neutrophil]]s, as part of the immune response against bacteria. Elemental chlorine at high concentrations is extremely dangerous and [[poisonous]] for all living organisms, and was historically used in World War I as the first gaseous chemical warfare agent.

The boiling point at regular atmosphere is around −34 ˚C, but it can be liquefied at room temperature with pressures above 740 kPa (107 psi).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nist.gov/pml/div685/grp02/srd_134_chlorine.cfm |title=SRD134 Chlorine |publisher=NIST |accessdate=2012-09-12 }}</ref>

Although elemental chlorine is yellow-green, chloride ion, in common with other [[Halide|halide ions]], has no color in either minerals or solutions (example, table salt). Similarly, (again as with other halogens) chlorine atoms impart no color to organic chlorides when they replace hydrogen atoms in colorless organic compounds, such as [[tetrachloromethane]]. The melting point and density of these compounds is increased by substitution of hydrogen in place of chlorine. Compounds of chlorine with other halogens, however, as well as many chlorine oxides, are visibly colored.

=== Chemical characteristics ===
Along with [[fluorine]], [[bromine]], [[iodine]], and [[astatine]], chlorine is a member of the [[halogen]] series that forms the group 17 (formerly VII, VIIA, or VIIB) of the periodic table. Chlorine forms compounds with almost all of the elements to give compounds that are usually called chlorides. Chlorine gas reacts with most organic compounds, and will even sluggishly support the [[combustion]] of [[hydrocarbon]]s.<ref name=CRC/>

==== Hydrolysis of free chlorine or disproportionation in water ====
At 25&nbsp;°C and atmospheric pressure, one [[litre|liter]] of [[water]] dissolves 3.26&nbsp;g or 1.125&nbsp;L of gaseous chlorine.{{sfn|Wiberg|2001|p=409}} Solutions of chlorine in water contain chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>), [[hydrochloric acid]], and [[hypochlorous acid]]:

:Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} HCl + HClO

This conversion to the right is called [[disproportionation]], because the ingredient chlorine both increases and decreases in formal [[oxidation state]]. The solubility of chlorine in water is increased if the water contains dissolved alkali [[hydroxide]], and in this way, [[chlorine bleach]] is produced.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|pp=857–858}}

:Cl<sub>2</sub> + 2 OH<sup>–</sup> → ClO<sup>–</sup> + Cl<sup>–</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O

Chlorine gas only exists in a neutral or acidic solution.

==== Chemistry and compounds ====
{{Category see also|Chlorine compounds}}

Chlorine exists in all odd numbered [[oxidation states]] from −1 to +7, as well as the elemental state of zero and four in [[chlorine dioxide]] (see table below, and also structures in [[chlorite]]).{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=806}} Progressing through the states, hydrochloric acid can be oxidized using [[manganese dioxide]], or [[hydrogen chloride]] gas oxidized catalytically by air to form elemental chlorine gas.{{sfn|Wiberg|2001|p=408}}

===== Chlorides =====
{{main|Chloride}}

Chlorine combines with almost all elements to give chlorides. Compounds with [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[xenon]], and [[krypton]] are known, but do not form by direct reaction of the elements.<ref>{{cite book|title=Merck Index of Chemicals and Drugs, 9th ed.|publisher=Merck & Co.|location = Rahway, N.J.|year=1976|isbn=0-911910-26-3|editor=Windholz, Martha ''et al.''}}</ref> Chloride is one of the most common [[anion]]s in nature. [[Hydrogen chloride]] and its aqueous solution, [[hydrochloric acid]], are produced on megaton scale annually both as valued intermediates but sometimes as undesirable pollutants.

===== Chlorine oxides =====
Chlorine forms a variety of oxides, as seen above: [[chlorine dioxide]] (ClO<sub>2</sub>), [[dichlorine monoxide]] (Cl<sub>2</sub>O), [[dichlorine hexoxide]] (Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), [[dichlorine heptoxide]] (Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>). The anionic derivatives of these same oxides are also well known including [[chlorate]] ({{chem|ClO|3|-}}), [[chlorite]] ({{chem|ClO|2|-}}), [[hypochlorite]] (ClO<sup>−</sup>), and [[perchlorate]] ({{chem|ClO|4|-}}). The acid derivatives of these anions are [[hypochlorous acid]] (HOCl), [[chloric acid]] (HClO<sub>3</sub>) and [[perchloric acid]] (HClO<sub>4</sub>). The chloroxy cation [[chloryl]] (ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>) is known and has the same structure as [[chlorite]] but with a positive charge and chlorine in the +5 oxidation state.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|pp=844–850}} The compound "chlorine trioxide" does not occur, but rather in gas form is found as the dimeric [[dichlorine hexoxide]] (Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) with a +6 oxidation state. This compound in liquid or solid form disproportionates to a mixture of +5 and +7 oxidation states, occurring as the ionic compound chloryl perchlorate, {{chem|[ClO|2|]|+|[ClO|4|]|-}}.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=849}}

In hot concentrated alkali solution [[hypochlorite]] disproportionates:
:2 ClO<sup>−</sup> → Cl<sup>−</sup> + {{chem|ClO|2|-}}
:ClO<sup>−</sup> + {{chem|ClO|2|-}} → Cl<sup>−</sup> + {{chem|ClO|3|-}}
[[Sodium chlorate]] and [[potassium chlorate]] can be crystallized from solutions formed by the above reactions. If their crystals are heated to a high temperature, they undergo a further, final disproportionation:
:4 {{chem|ClO|3|-}} → Cl<sup>−</sup> + 3 {{chem|ClO|4|-}}

This same progression from chloride to perchlorate can be accomplished by electrolysis. The anode reaction progression is:<ref name="c_w">{{cite book|author=Cotton, F.

===== Interhalogen compounds =====
Chlorine oxidizes bromide and iodide salts to bromine and iodine, respectively. However, it cannot oxidize fluoride salts to fluorine. It makes a variety of [[interhalogen compound]]s, such as the chlorine fluorides, [[chlorine monofluoride]] ({{chem|ClF}}), [[chlorine trifluoride]] ({{chem|ClF|3}}), [[chlorine pentafluoride]] ({{chem|ClF|5}}). Chlorides of bromine and iodine are also known.<ref>{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=fEKbJrqKovUC&pg=PA133|pages = 133–143|title = Advances in inorganic chemistry and radiochemistry|isbn = 978-0-12-023603-9|author1 = Emeléus, H. J|year = 1961}}</ref>

===== Organochlorine compounds =====
{{main|Organochloride}}

Chlorine is used extensively in [[organic chemistry]] in [[substitution (chemistry)|substitution]] and [[addition reaction]]s. Chlorine often imparts many desired properties to an [[organic compound]], in part owing to its electronegativity.

Like the other halides, chlorine undergoes [[electrophilic addition]] reactions, the most notable one being the chlorination of [[alkenes]] and [[aromatic compound]]s with a [[Lewis acid]] [[catalyst]]. Organic chlorine compounds tend to be less reactive in [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions than the corresponding bromine or iodine derivatives, but they tend to be cheaper. They may be activated for reaction by substituting with a [[tosylate]] group, or by the use of a catalytic amount of [[sodium iodide]].{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=== Occurrence ===
{{Category see also|Halide minerals}}

In the interstellar medium, chlorine is produced in [[supernova]]e via the [[r-process]].<ref>{{cite journal|author= Cameron, A.G.W. |title=Stellar Evolution, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Nucleogenesis| journal=CRL-41|month=June| year=1957|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/CRL-41.pdf}}</ref>

In meteorites and on Earth, chlorine is found primarily as the [[chloride ion]] which occurs in minerals. In the Earth's crust, chlorine is present at average concentrations of about 126 parts per million,{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=795}} predominantly in such minerals as ''[[halite]]'' ([[sodium chloride]]), ''[[sylvite]]'' ([[potassium chloride]]), and ''[[carnallite]]'' (potassium magnesium chloride hexahydrate).

Chloride is a component of the salt that is deposited in the earth or dissolved in the [[ocean]]s — about 1.9% of the mass of seawater is chloride ions. Even higher concentrations of chloride are found in the [[Dead Sea]] and in underground [[brine]] deposits. Most chloride salts are soluble in water, thus, chloride-containing minerals are usually only found in abundance in dry climates or deep underground.

Over 2000 naturally occurring organic chlorine compounds are known.<ref name="Euro Chlor">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110726042917/http://www.eurochlor.org/upload/documents/document236.pdf|title=Risk assessment and the cycling of natural organochlorines|publisher=Euro Chlor|accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref>

=== Isotopes ===
{{Main|Isotopes of chlorine}}

Chlorine has a wide range of [[Isotopes of chlorine|isotopes]]. The two stable [[isotope]]s are <sup>35</sup>Cl (75.77%) and <sup>37</sup>Cl (24.23%).<ref name="NUBASE">{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| year = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.H.}}</ref> Together they give chlorine an [[atomic weight]] of 35.4527&nbsp;g/mol. The [[half-integer]] value for chlorine's weight caused some confusion in the early days of chemistry, when it had been postulated that atoms were composed of even units of hydrogen (see [[Proust's law]]), and the existence of chemical [[isotope]]s was unsuspected.<ref name=Gamow>{{cite book|last=Gamow|first=George|title=One Two Three... Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science|year=1967|publisher=Bantam|pages=151–154|edition=Bantam Science and Mathematics}}</ref>

Trace amounts of [[radioactive]] [[Chlorine-36|<sup>36</sup>Cl]] exist in the environment, in a ratio of about 7x10<sup>−13</sup> to 1 with stable isotopes. <sup>36</sup>Cl is produced in the atmosphere by [[spallation]] of <sup>36</sup>[[argon|Ar]] by interactions with [[cosmic ray]] [[proton]]s. In the subsurface environment, <sup>36</sup>Cl is generated primarily as a result of [[neutron capture]] by <sup>35</sup>Cl or [[muon capture]] by <sup>40</sup>[[calcium|Ca]]. <sup>36</sup>Cl decays to <sup>36</sup>[[sulfur|S]] and to <sup>36</sup>[[argon|Ar]], with a combined [[half-life]] of 308,000 years. The half-life of this [[hydrophilic]] nonreactive isotope makes it suitable for [[geologic dating]] in the range of 60,000 to 1&nbsp;million years. Additionally, large amounts of <sup>36</sup>Cl were produced by irradiation of [[seawater]] during atmospheric detonations of [[nuclear weapon]]s between 1952 and 1958. The residence time of <sup>36</sup>Cl in the atmosphere is about 1 week. Thus, as an event marker of 1950s water in [[soil]] and [[groundwater]], <sup>36</sup>Cl is also useful for dating waters less than 50 years before the present. <sup>36</sup>Cl has seen use in other areas of the geological sciences, including dating ice and sediments.<ref name="NUBASE"/>

== History ==
The most common compound of chlorine, sodium chloride, has been known since ancient times; archaeologists have found evidence that rock salt was used as early as 3000 BC and brine as early as 6000 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/weller/|title = The earliest salt production in the world: an early Neolithic exploitation in Poiana Slatinei-Lunca, Romania |accessdate=2008-07-10}}</ref> Around 1630, chlorine was recognized as a gas by the Belgian chemist and physician [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]].{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=790}}

[[File:PSM V31 D740 Carl Wilhelm Scheele.jpg|thumb|140px|Carl Wilhelm Scheele]]

Elemental chlorine was first prepared and studied in 1774 by Swedish chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], and, therefore, he is credited for its discovery.<ref name=krogt>{{cite web|url=http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=Cl |title=17 Chlorine |publisher=Elements.vanderkrogt.net |accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref> He called it "''dephlogisticated muriatic acid air''" since it is a gas (then called "airs") and it came from [[hydrochloric acid]] (then known as "muriatic acid").<ref name=krogt/> However, he failed to establish chlorine as an element, mistakenly thinking that it was the [[oxide]] obtained from the hydrochloric acid (see [[phlogiston theory]]).<ref name=krogt/> He named the new element within this oxide as ''muriaticum''.<ref name=krogt/> Regardless of what he thought, Scheele did isolate chlorine by reacting [[Manganese dioxide|MnO<sub>2</sub>]] (as the mineral [[pyrolusite]]) with HCl:{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=790}}

:4 HCl + MnO<sub>2</sub> → MnCl<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sub>2</sub>

Scheele observed several of the properties of chlorine: the bleaching effect on [[Litmus test (chemistry)|litmus]], the deadly effect on insects, the yellow green color, and the smell similar to [[aqua regia]].{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=793}}

At the time, common chemical theory was: any acid is a compound that contains oxygen (still sounding in the German and Dutch names of [[oxygen]]: ''sauerstoff'' or ''zuurstof'', both translating into English as ''acid stuff''), so a number of chemists, including [[Claude Berthollet]], suggested that Scheele's ''dephlogisticated muriatic acid air'' must be a combination of oxygen and the yet undiscovered element, ''muriaticum''.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=792}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=34KwmkU4LG0C&pg=PA158|page=158|title=The development of modern chemistry|author=Ihde, Aaron John|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1984|isbn=0-486-64235-6}}</ref><ref name="Weeks">{{cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ed009p1915|title = The discovery of the elements.

In 1809, [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and [[Louis-Jacques Thénard]] tried to decompose ''dephlogisticated muriatic acid air'' by reacting it with charcoal to release the free element ''muriaticum'' (and carbon dioxide).<ref name="krogt"/> They did not succeed and published a report in which they considered the possibility that ''dephlogisticated muriatic acid air'' is an element, but were not convinced.<ref>{{cite journal|title = On the nature and the properties of muriatic acid and of oxygenated muriatic acid|journal = Mémoires de Physique et de Chimie de la Société d'Arcueil|volume = 2|pages = 339–358|year = 1809|url = http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/thenard.html|quote = "In fact, oxygenated muriatic acid is not decomposed by charcoal, and it might be supposed, from this fact and those that are communicated in this Memoir, that this gas is a simple body.

In 1810, [[Sir Humphry Davy]] tried the same experiment again, and concluded that it is an element, and not a compound.<ref name=krogt/> He named this new element as chlorine, from the Greek word χλωρος (''chlōros''), meaning green-yellow.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Sir Humphry Davy |title = On a Combination of Oxymuriatic Gas and Oxygene Gas|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume = 101|pages = 155–162|year = 1811|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1811.0008|url=http://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Davy-Chlorine-1811.html}}</ref> The name '''[[halogen]]''', meaning "salt producer," was originally used for chlorine in 1811 by [[Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger]].

The resulting liquid, known as "''Eau de Javel''" ("[[Javel water]]"), was a weak solution of [[sodium hypochlorite]]. However, this process was not very efficient, and alternative production methods were sought. [[Scottish people|Scottish]] chemist and industrialist [[Charles Tennant]] first produced a solution of [[calcium hypochlorite]] ("chlorinated lime"), then solid calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder).<ref name=encyc/> These compounds produced low levels of elemental chlorine, and could be more efficiently transported than sodium hypochlorite, which remained as dilute solutions because when purified to eliminate water, it became a dangerously powerful and unstable oxidizer. Near the end of the nineteenth century, E. S. Smith patented a method of sodium hypochlorite production involving electrolysis of [[brine]] to produce [[sodium hydroxide]] and chlorine gas, which then mixed to form sodium hypochlorite.<ref>{{cite web | title=How Products Are Made Volume 2 |date = may 2011| url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-2/Bleach.html}}</ref>  This is known as the [[chloralkali process]], first introduced on an industrial scale in 1892, and now the source of essentially all modern elemental chlorine and sodium hydroxide production (a related low-temperature electrolysis reaction, the [[sodium hypochlorite|Hooker process]], is now responsible for bleach and [[sodium hypochlorite]] production).

Elemental chlorine solutions dissolved in [[base (chemistry)|chemically basic]] water (sodium and [[calcium hypochlorite]]) were first used as anti-putrification agents and disinfectants in the 1820s, in France, long before the establishment of the [[germ theory of disease]]. This work is mainly due to [[Antoine-Germain Labarraque]], who adapted Berthollet's "Javel water" bleach and other chlorine preparations for the purpose (for a more complete history, see below). Elemental chlorine has since served a continuous function in topical antisepsis (wound irrigation solutions and the like) as well as public sanitation (especially of swimming and drinking water).

{{Main|Chlorine production|Chloralkali process}}

In industry, elemental chlorine is usually produced by the electrolysis of sodium chloride dissolved in water. This method, the [[chloralkali process]] industrialized in 1892, now provides essentially all industrial chlorine gas.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=798}} Along with chlorine, the method yields [[hydrogen]] gas and [[sodium hydroxide]] (with sodium hydroxide actually being the most crucial of the three industrial products produced by the process). The process proceeds according to the following [[chemical equation]]:{{sfn|Wiberg|2001|p=408}}

:2 NaCl + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O → Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH

The electrolysis of chloride solutions all proceed according to the following equations:

:Cathode: 2 H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + 2 e<sup>−</sup> → H<sub>2</sub> (g)
:Anode: 2 Cl<sup>−</sup> (aq) → Cl<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2 e<sup>−</sup>

Overall process: 2 NaCl (or KCl) + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O → Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH (or KOH)

In diaphragm cell electrolysis, an [[asbestos]] (or polymer-fiber) diaphragm separates a cathode and an [[anode]], preventing the chlorine forming at the anode from re-mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode.<ref name="Euro Chlor3">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochlor.org/the-chlorine-universe/how-is-chlorine-produced/the-diaphragm-cell-process.aspx|title=The diaphragm cell process|publisher=Euro Chlor|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref> The salt solution (brine) is continuously fed to the anode compartment and flows through the diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the [[Causticity|caustic]] [[alkali]] is produced and the brine is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali but they are not burdened with the problem of preventing mercury discharge into the environment and they are more energy efficient. Membrane cell electrolysis employ [[Semipermeable membrane|permeable membrane]] as an [[ion exchange]]r. Saturated sodium (or potassium) chloride solution is passed through the anode compartment, leaving at a lower [[concentration]].<ref name="Euro Chlor4">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochlor.org/the-chlorine-universe/how-is-chlorine-produced/the-membrane-cell-process.aspx|title=The membrane cell process|publisher=Euro Chlor|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref> This method is more efficient than the diaphragm cell and produces very pure sodium (or potassium) hydroxide at about 32% concentration, but requires very pure brine.

=== Laboratory methods ===
Small amounts of chlorine gas can be made in the laboratory by combining hydrochloric acid and manganese dioxide. Alternatively a strong acid such as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid reacts with [[sodium hypochlorite]] solution to release chlorine gas but reacts with [[sodium chlorate]] to produce chlorine gas and [[chlorine dioxide]] gas as well. In the home, accidents occur when hypochlorite bleach solutions are combined with certain acidic drain-cleaners.

== Applications ==

=== Production of industrial and consumer products ===
Principal applications of chlorine are in the production of a wide range of industrial and consumer products.<ref name="Euro Chlor5">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110726042720/http://www.eurochlor.org/uses|title=What is chlorine used for? |publisher=Euro Chlor|accessdate=2007-08-20|date=October 2010}}</ref><ref name="Chlorine Tree">{{cite web|url=http://www.chlorinetree.org|title=Chlorine Tree|publisher=Chlorine Tree|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref> For example, it is used in making plastics, solvents for dry cleaning and metal degreasing, textiles, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, insecticides, dyestuffs, household cleaning products, etc.

Many important industrial products are produced via organochlorine intermediates. Examples include [[polycarbonate]]s, [[polyurethane]]s, [[silicone]]s, [[polytetrafluoroethylene]], [[carboxymethyl cellulose]], and [[propylene oxide]]. Like the other halogens, chlorine participates in [[free-radical substitution reaction]]s with hydrogen-containing organic compounds. When applied to organic substrates, reaction is often—but not invariably—non-regioselective, and, hence, may result in a mixture of isomeric products. It is often difficult to control the degree of substitution as well, so multiple substitutions are common. If the different reaction products are easily separated, e.g., by distillation, substitutive free-radical chlorination (in some cases accompanied by concurrent thermal dehydrochlorination) may be a useful synthetic route. Industrial examples of this are the production of [[methyl chloride]], [[methylene chloride]], [[chloroform]], and [[carbon tetrachloride]] from methane, [[allyl chloride]] from propylene, and [[trichloroethylene]], and [[tetrachloroethylene]] from [[ethylene dichloride|1,2-dichloroethane]].

Quantitatively, about 63% and 18% of all elemental chlorine produced is used in the manufacture of organic and inorganic chlorine compounds, respectively,.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=798}} About 15,000 chlorine compounds are being used commercially.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=793}} The remaining 19% is used for bleaches and disinfection products.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=798}} The most significant of organic compounds in terms of production volume are [[1,2-dichloroethane]] and [[vinyl chloride]], intermediates in the production of [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]. Other particularly important organochlorines are [[methyl chloride]], [[methylene chloride]], [[chloroform]], [[vinylidene chloride]], [[trichloroethylene]], [[perchloroethylene]], [[allyl chloride]], [[epichlorohydrin]], [[chlorobenzene]], [[dichlorobenzene]]s, and [[trichlorobenzene]]s. The major inorganic compounds include HCl, Cl<sub>2</sub>O, HOCl, NaClO<sub>3</sub>, chlorinated isocyanurates, AlCl<sub>3</sub>, SiCl<sub>4</sub>, SnCl<sub>4</sub>, PCl<sub>3</sub>, PCl<sub>5</sub>, POCl<sub>3</sub>, AsCl<sub>3</sub>, SbCl<sub>3</sub>, SbCl<sub>5</sub>, BiCl<sub>3</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, SCl<sub>2</sub>, SOCI<sub>2</sub>, CIF<sub>3</sub>, ICl, ICl<sub>3</sub>, TiCl<sub>3</sub>, TiCl<sub>4</sub>, MoCl<sub>5</sub>, FeCl<sub>3</sub>, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, etc.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=798}}{{sfn|Wiberg|2001|p=412}}

==== Combating putrefaction ====
[[File:A G Barraque.jpg|thumb|Antoine-Germain Labarraque]]

In France (as elsewhere) there was a need to process [[Catgut|animal guts]] in order to make musical instrument strings, [[Goldbeater's skin]] and other products. This was carried out in "gut factories" (''boyauderies'') as an odiferous and unhealthy business. In or about 1820, the [[:fr:Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale|Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale]] offered a prize for the discovery of a method, chemical or mechanical, that could be used to separate the peritoneal membrane of animal intestines without causing putrefaction.<ref name="nbu" /><ref name="knight">{{cite book |author=Knight, Charles |page=427 |title=Arts and sciences |volume=1 |publisher=Bradbury, Evans & Co. |year=1867}}</ref> It was won by [[Antoine-Germain Labarraque]], a 44 year-old French chemist and pharmacist who had discovered that Berthollet's chlorinated bleaching solutions ("''[[Javel water|Eau de Javel]]''") not only destroyed the smell of putrefaction of animal tissue decomposition, but also retarded the decomposition process itself.<ref name="knight"/><ref name="bouvet">{{cite journal |author=Maurice Bouvet |language=French |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/pharm_0035-2349_1950_num_38_128_8662 |trans_title=The great pharmacists: Labarraque (1777-1850) |title=Les grands pharmaciens: Labarraque (1777–1850) |journal=Revue d'histoire de la pharmacie |year=1950 |volume=38 |issue=128 |pages=97–107 |doi=10.3406/pharm.1950.8662 }}</ref>

Labarraque's research resulted in chlorides and hypochlorites of lime ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) and of sodium ([[sodium hypochlorite]]) being employed not only in the ''boyauderies'' but also for the routine disinfection and deodorisation of [[latrine]]s, [[sewerage|sewers]], markets, [[abattoir]]s, [[anatomical theatre]]s and morgues.<ref name="gedeon">{{cite book |author=Andras Gédéon |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vw9qq7Ghjp4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Science and technology in medicine |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |pages=181–2 |isbn=9780387278742 }}</ref> They were also used, with success, in hospitals, [[Lazaretto|lazarets]], prisons, infirmaries (both on land and at sea), [[Magnanery|magnaneries]], stables, cattle-sheds, etc.; and for [[exhumation]]s,<ref>{{cite book |title=On the disinfecting properties of Labarraque's preparations of chlorine |author=Antoine Germain Labarraque, James Scott (tr.) |year=1828 |page=8 |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=pD0XAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref> [[embalming]], during outbreaks of epidemic illness, fever, [[Blackleg (disease)|blackleg]] in cattle, etc.<ref name="nbu">{{cite book |editor=Jean Chrétien Ferdinand Hoefer |contribution=Labarraque, Antoine-Germain |title=Nouvelle biographie universelle |volume=28 |pages=323–324 |ol=24229911M }}</ref>

==== Against infection and contagion ====
Labarraque's chlorinated lime and soda solutions have been advocated since 1828 to prevent infection (called "contagious infection", and presumed to be transmitted by "[[miasma theory of disease|miasmas]]") and also to treat [[putrefaction]] of existing wounds, including septic wounds.<ref>Scott, James (trans.). ''[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pD0XAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false On the disinfecting properties of Labarraque's preparations of chlorine]'' (S. Highley, 1828) Accessed Nov 1, 2011.</ref> In this 1828 work, Labarraque recommended for the doctor to breathe chlorine, wash his hands with chlorinated lime, and even sprinkle chlorinated lime about the patient's bed, in cases of "contagious infection." In 1828, it was well known that some infections were contagious, even though the agency of the microbe was not to be realized or discovered for more than half a century.

During the [[July Monarchy#The 1832 cholera epidemic|Paris cholera outbreak]] of 1832, large quantities of so-called ''chloride of lime'' were used to disinfect the capital. This was not simply modern [[calcium chloride]], but contained chlorine gas dissolved in lime-water (dilute [[calcium hydroxide]]) to form [[calcium hypochlorite]] (chlorinated lime). Labarraque's discovery helped to remove the terrible stench of decay from hospitals and dissecting rooms, and, by doing so, effectively deodorised the [[Latin Quarter, Paris|Latin Quarter]] of Paris.<ref name="corbin">Corbin, Alain. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=LI1M4sLcvPAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false The Foul and the Fragrant: Odor and the French Social Imagination]'' (Harvard University Press, 1988) pp. 121–2.</ref> These "putrid miasmas" were thought by many to be responsible for the spread of "contagion" and "infection" – both words used before the germ theory of infection. The use of chloride of lime was based on destruction of odors and "putrid matter." One source has claimed that chloride of lime was used by Dr. John Snow to disinfect water from the cholera-contaminated well feeding the Broad Street pump in 1854 London.<ref>Black and Veatch Corp. (2010). ''White's Handbook of Chlorination and Alternative Disinfectants''. Hoboken, NJ:Wiley. first page, Chapter 9.</ref>  Three reputable sources that described the famous Broad Street pump cholera epidemic do not mention Snow performing any disinfection of water from that well.<ref name= Vinten>Vinten-Johansen, Peter, Howard Brody, Nigel Paneth, Stephen Rachman and Michael Rip.

==== Semmelweis and experiments with antisepsis ====
[[File:Ignaz Semmelweis 1860.jpg|thumb|Ignaz Semmelweis]]
Perhaps the most famous application of Labarraque's chlorine and [[base (chemistry)|chemical base]] solutions was in 1847, when [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] used (first) chlorine-water (simply chlorine dissolved in pure water), then cheaper chlorinated lime solutions, to deodorize the hands of Austrian doctors, which Semmelweis noticed still carried the stench of decomposition from the dissection rooms to the patient examination rooms. Semmelweis, still long before the germ theory of disease, had theorized that "cadaveric particles" were somehow transmitting decay from fresh medical cadavers to living patients, and he used the well-known "Labarraque's solutions" as the only known method to remove the smell of decay and tissue decomposition (which he found that soap did not). The solutions proved to be far more effective germicide antiseptics than soap (Semmelweis was also aware of their greater efficacy, but not the reason), and this resulted in Semmelweis's (later) celebrated success in stopping the transmission of [[childbed fever]] ("puerperal fever") in the maternity wards of [[Vienna General Hospital]] in Austria in 1847.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_chlorine/sec_content.asp?CID=1166&DID=4476&CTYPEID=109|title = Chlorine Story|publisher = americanchemistry|accessdate=2008-07-10}}</ref>

Much later, during World War I in 1916, a standardized and diluted modification of Labarraque's solution, containing hypochlorite (0.5%) and boric acid as an acidic stabilizer, was developed by [[Henry Drysdale Dakin]] (who gave full credit to Labarraque's prior work in this area). Called [[Dakin's solution]], the method of wound irrigation with chlorinated solutions allowed antiseptic treatment of a wide variety of open wounds, long before the modern antibiotic era. A modified version of this solution continues to be employed in wound irrigation in the modern era, where it remains effective against multiply antibiotic resistant bacteria (see [[Century Pharmaceuticals]]).

==== Public sanitation ====
By 1918, the [[US Department of Treasury]] called for all drinking water to be disinfected with chlorine. Chlorine is presently an important chemical for [[water purification]] (such as in water treatment plants), in [[disinfectant]]s, and in [[bleach]]. Chlorine in water is more than three times as effective as a disinfectant against ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' than an equivalent concentration of [[bromine]], and is more than six times more effective than an equivalent concentration of [[iodine]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Koski TA, Stuart LS, Ortenzio LF|title=Comparison of chlorine, bromine, iodine as disinfectants for swimming pool water|journal = Applied Microbiology|volume = 14|issue = 2|year = 1966|pages = 276–279|pmid=4959984|pmc=546668}}</ref>

Chlorine is usually used (in the form of [[hypochlorous acid]]) to kill [[bacteria]] and other microbes in [[drinking water]] supplies and public swimming pools. In most private swimming pools, chlorine itself is not used, but rather [[sodium hypochlorite]], formed from chlorine and [[sodium hydroxide]], or solid tablets of chlorinated isocyanurates. The drawback of using chlorine in swimming pools is that the chlorine reacts with a human's hair and skin because hair and skin are made from protein (see [[Hypochlorous acid#Reaction with protein amino groups]]). Once the chlorine reacts with the hair and skin, it becomes chemically bonded.  Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated.<ref name=CRC>{{cite book| author = Hammond, C. R.|title = The Elements, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition| publisher =CRC press| year = 2000| isbn = 0-8493-0481-4}}</ref>

It is often impractical to store and use poisonous chlorine gas for water treatment, so alternative methods of adding chlorine are used. These include [[hypochlorite]] solutions, which gradually release chlorine into the water, and compounds like [[sodium dichloro-s-triazinetrione]] (dihydrate or anhydrous), sometimes referred to as "dichlor", and [[trichloro-s-triazinetrione]], sometimes referred to as "trichlor". These compounds are stable while solid and may be used in powdered, granular, or tablet form. When added in small amounts to pool water or industrial water systems, the chlorine atoms hydrolyze from the rest of the molecule forming hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which acts as a general biocide, killing germs, micro-organisms, algae, and so on.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=860}}{{sfn|Wiberg|2001|p=411}}

=== Use as a weapon ===

==== World War I ====
{{Main|Poison gas in World War I}}

Chlorine gas, also known as '''bertholite''', was first [[chemical warfare|used as a weapon]] in [[World War I]] by Germany on April 22, 1915 in the [[Second Battle of Ypres]].<ref>"Battle of Ypres" ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''</ref> As described by the soldiers it had a distinctive smell of a mixture between pepper and pineapple. It also tasted metallic and stung the back of the throat and chest. Chlorine can react with water in the mucosa of the lungs to form [[hydrochloric acid]], an irritant that can be lethal. The damage done by chlorine gas can be prevented by the [[activated charcoal]] commonly found in [[gas mask]]s, or other filtration methods, which makes the overall chance of death by chlorine gas much lower than those of other chemical weapons. It was pioneered by a German scientist later to be a Nobel laureate, [[Fritz Haber]] of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, in collaboration with the German chemical conglomerate [[IG Farben]], who developed methods for discharging chlorine gas against an [[trench|entrenched]] enemy. It is alleged that Haber's role in the use of chlorine as a deadly weapon drove his wife, [[Clara Immerwahr]], to suicide.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=G9FljcEASycC&pg=PA226|page=226|title=Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production|isbn=978-0-262-69313-4|author1=Smil, Vaclav|date=2004-04-01}}</ref><!--Several books I (stone) looked into only claimed that this is a possibility while the Immerwahr article says there is source for the motive of here suicide--> After its first use, chlorine was utilized by both sides as a chemical weapon, but it was soon replaced by the more deadly [[phosgene]] and [[mustard gas]].<ref name="First World War">{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/gas.htm|title=Weapons of War: Poison Gas|publisher=First World War.com|accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref>

==== Iraq War ====
{{Main|2007 chlorine bombings in Iraq}}

Chlorine gas has also been used by insurgents against the local population and coalition forces in the [[Iraq War]] in the form of [[chlorine bomb]]s. On March 17, 2007, for example, three chlorine-filled trucks were detonated in the Anbar province killing two and sickening over 350.<ref name="cnnchlorine">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/03/17/iraq.main/index.html|last=Mahdi|first=Basim|publisher=CNN|date=2007-03-17|accessdate=2007-03-17|title= Iraq gas attack makes hundreds ill}}</ref> Other chlorine bomb attacks resulted in higher death tolls, with more than 30 deaths on two separate occasions.<ref name="Chlorine bomb BBC">{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6660585.stm|publisher = BBC News|date=2007-05-17|accessdate = 2007-05-17|title = 'Chlorine bomb' hits Iraq village}}</ref> Most of the deaths were caused by the force of the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine, since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. The Iraqi authorities have tightened security for elemental chlorine, which is essential for providing safe drinking water to the population.

=== Chlorine induced cracking in structural materials ===
<!-- Don't move this picture from this position or delete it, as the paragraph below refers to it. -->
[[File:Chlorine attack1.jpg|thumb|right|Chlorine "attack" on an acetal resin plumbing joint.]]

The element is widely used for purifying water owing to its powerful oxidizing properties, especially potable water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred owing to chlorine induced [[stress corrosion cracking]] of [[stainless steel]] rods used to suspend them.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cEmq232h1zcC&pg=PA148|page=148|title=Corrosion of steel in concrete: prevention, diagnosis, repair|author=Bertolini, Luca; Elsener, Bernhard; Pedeferri, Pietro; Polder, Rob B.|publisher=Wiley-VCH|year=2004|isbn=3-527-30800-8}}</ref> Some [[polymer]]s are also sensitive to attack, including [[acetal resin]] and [[polybutene]].

The picture on the right shows an acetal joint in a water supply system, which, when it fractured, caused substantial physical damage to computers in the labs below the supply. The cracks started at [[injection molding]] defects in the joint and slowly grew until finally triggered.

Chlorine is a toxic gas that irritates the respiratory system. Because it is heavier than air, it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials.<ref name="msds-cl">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070926183417/http://www.westlake.com/datasheets/MSDS_Chlorine.pdf |title=Chlorine MSDS|date=October 23, 1997 (Revised November 1999)}}</ref>

Chlorine is detectable with measuring devices in concentrations of as low as 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60&nbsp;ppm. About 1000&nbsp;ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=793}} Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system, and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes.<ref name=tox>{{cite journal|journal = Environmental Research|volume = 85|issue = 2|year = 2001 |doi = 10.1006/enrs.2000.4110 |title = The Toxicology of Chlorine|author = Winder, Chris|pages = 105–114|pmid = 11161660|bibcode = 2001ER.....85..105W }}</ref>
The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations above 30&nbsp;ppm, it begins to react with water and cells, which change it into [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) and [[hypochlorous acid]] (HClO).

When used at specified levels for water disinfection, the reaction of chlorine with water is not a major concern for human health. Other materials present in the water may generate disinfection by-products that are associated with negative effects on human health,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aces.uiuc.edu/news/stories/news4724.html|title=What's in your Water?: Disinfectants Create Toxic By-products|date=2009-03-31|work=ACES News|publisher=College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences – University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=2009-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2007.09.001 |title=Occurrence, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity of regulated and emerging disinfection by-products in drinking water: A review and roadmap for research |year=2007 |last1=Richardson |first1=Susan D. |last2=Plewa |first2=Michael J. |last3=Wagner |first3=Elizabeth D. |last4=Schoeny |first4=Rita |last5=DeMarini |first5=David M. |journal=Mutation Research/Reviews in Mutation Research |volume=636 |pages=178–242 |pmid=17980649 |issue=1–3}}</ref> however, the health risk is far lower than drinking undisinfected water.

== Organochlorine compounds as pollutants ==
Some organochlorine compounds are serious pollutants. These are produced either as by-products or end products of industrial processes which are persistent in the environment, such as certain chlorinated pesticides and [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s. Chlorine is added both to pesticides and pharmaceuticals to make the molecules more resistant to enzymatic degradation by bacteria, insects, and mammals, but this property also has the effect of prolonging the residence time of these compounds when they enter the environment. In this respect chlorinated organics have some resemblance to fluorinated organics.
