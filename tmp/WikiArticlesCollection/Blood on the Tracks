'''''Blood on the Tracks''''' is the fifteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter [[Bob Dylan]], released in January 1975 on [[Columbia Records]]. The album marked Dylan's return to Columbia after a two-album stint with [[Asylum Records]]. Most of the lyrics on the album revolve around heartache, anger, and loneliness.

The album, which followed on the resurgence of critical acclaim for Dylan's work after ''[[Planet Waves]]'', was greeted enthusiastically by fans and critics. In the years following its release it has come to be regarded as one of his best albums; it is  common for subsequent records to be labeled his "best since ''Blood on the Tracks''."<ref>

It is also commonly seen as a standard for confessional singer-songwriter albums; though Dylan has denied that the songs are autobiographical, his son [[Jakob Dylan]] has stated: "The songs are my parents talking."<ref name="Sounes">{{cite book| author = Howard Sounes| title = Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan| date = 2002-04-03| publisher = Random House| isbn = 978-0-552-99929-8 |page = 333 }}</ref> In 2003, the album was ranked number 16 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]], and in 2004, it was placed at number 5 on ''[[Pitchfork Media]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s list of the top 100 albums of the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/5932-top-100-albums-of-the-1970s/10/ |title=Staff Lists: Top 100 Albums of the 1970s |date=June 23, 2004 |accessdate=January 11, 2013 |work=[[Pitchfork Media]]}}</ref>

The album reached #1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts and #4 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].

==Recording==

===Pre-production===
Prior to recording, and while details regarding his return to Columbia Records were being fleshed out, Dylan previewed the songs that would make up ''Blood on the Tracks'' to a number of friends and peers in the music world. According to biographer [[Jimmy McDonough]], Dylan visited [[Neil Young]] in his home in [[Florida]] to showcase the songs on the album and seek out Young's opinion, and even run through some of the songs with Young's group [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]].<ref>[http://www.randomhouse.com/anchor/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780679750963 "Shakey: Neil Young's Biography" by Jimmy McDonough]</ref> Dylan also previewed the songs to [[David Crosby]], [[Graham Nash]], [[Stephen Stills]], [[Tim Drummond]], and [[Peter Rowan]].<ref name="st-42">''A Simple Twist of Fate: Bob Dylan and the Making of Blood on the Tracks'' by Andy Gill and Kevin Odegard. 2005. P. 42.</ref> Notably, Graham Nash recalled that Stephen Stills disliked Dylan's private performance of his new songs: immediately after Dylan left the room, Stills remarked to Nash, "He's a good songwriter...but he's no musician."<ref name="st-42" />

Initially, Dylan considered recording ''Blood on the Tracks'' with an electric backing group, and even contacted [[Mike Bloomfield]], a guitarist who had worked with him on ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]''. The two met, and Dylan showcased the songs he was planning to record, but he played them too quickly for Bloomfield to learn.<ref name="williamson">{{cite book

It was one of the strangest experiences of my life. He was sort of pissed off that I didn't pick it up". In the end, Dylan rejected the idea of recording the album with a band, and instead substituted stripped-down acoustic arrangements for all of his songs.<ref name=williamson/>

===Recording sessions===
Dylan arrived at [[Columbia Records]]' A&R Recording Studios in New York City on September 16, 1974, where it was soon realized that he was taking a "spontaneous" approach to recording.<ref name=williamson/> The session engineer at the time, [[Phil Ramone]], later said that he would "go from one song to another like a medley. Sometimes he will have several bars, and in the next version, he will change his mind about how many bars there should be in between a verse. Or eliminate a verse. Or add a chorus when you don't expect". [[Eric Weissberg]] and his band, Deliverance, originally recruited as session men, were rejected after two days of recording because they could not keep up with Dylan's pace.<ref name=williamson/> Dylan retained [[bass guitar|bassist]] Tony Brown from the band, and soon added [[organ (instrument)|organist]] [[Paul Griffin (musician)|Paul Griffin]] (who had also worked on ''Highway 61 Revisited'') and [[steel guitar]]ist [[Buddy Cage]].<ref name=williamson/> After ten days<ref name=williamson/> and four sessions<ref>Bjorner, [http://bjorner.com/74%201-6.htm#_Toc522515522 1974 On the Road Again: Calendar] Bjorner's As the Years Passed the Door. Retrieved September 3, 2010</ref> with the current lineup, Dylan had finished recording and mixing, and, by November, had cut a [[acetate disc|test pressing]] on the album. Columbia soon began to prepare for the album's imminent release, but, two months later, just before the scheduled launch, Dylan re-recorded several songs at the last minute, in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis']] Sound 80 Studios, utilizing local musicians organized by his brother, David Zimmerman.<ref name=williamson/> Even with this setback, Columbia managed to release ''Blood on the Tracks'' on January 17, 1975.

==Notes==
The songs that make up ''Blood on the Tracks'' are seen by most Dylan biographers as having been inspired by his personal turmoil at the time, particularly his separation from his then-wife [[Sara Dylan]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Andy Gill| coauthors = Kevin Odegard| title = A Simple Twist Of Fate: Bob Dylan and the Making of Blood On the Tracks| url = http://books.google.com/?id=k2d4FiAU2JcC| date = 2005-03-01| publisher = Da Capo Press| isbn = 978-0-306-81413-6| page = 187 }}</ref> However, Dylan has never said as much, and in his 2004 memoir, ''[[Chronicles, Vol. 1]]'', he stated that the songs have nothing to do with his own personal life, and that they were inspired by the [[List of short stories by Anton Chekhov|short stories]] of [[Anton Chekhov]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/special/section/all-things-reconsidered-the-35th-anniversary-of-bob-dylans-blood-on-the-/|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=August 13, 2011|title=All Things Reconsidered: The 35th Anniversary of Bob Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks}}</ref>

Dylan's fans theorize endlessly about his reasons for revamping the album, with one unconfirmed view being that the musical feel of the album had been monotonous, with too many songs in the same key and the same languid rhythm. It has also been said that, just two weeks before the release of ''Blood on the Tracks'', Dylan played an [[acetate disc]] pressing of the record for his brother,  whose ensuing comments lead Dylan to re-cut five of the songs.<ref>[http://www.salon.com/sept97/sharps/sharps2970919.html Salon | Sharps and Flats]</ref> Although the original test pressing is widely bootlegged, only one of the five original takes from it has seen official release ("[[You're a Big Girl Now]]", released on 1985's ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]''). Alternate takes of "[[Tangled Up in Blue]]", "[[Idiot Wind]]", and "[[If You See Her, Say Hello]]" from the same sessions were released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991|The Bootleg Series, Vol. 1–3]]'', which also includes "Call Letter Blues", an outtake. "Up to Me", another outtake from these sessions, was released on ''Biograph''. "[[Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts]]" is the only song from the New York sessions that has not been officially released.

Told of the album's lasting popularity, Dylan was later to say (in a radio interview by [[Mary Travers (singer)|Mary Travers]]): "A lot of people tell me they enjoy that album. It's hard for me to relate to that. I mean, it, you know, people enjoying that type of pain, you know?" When speaking as to how the album seems to speak of the artist's own personal pain, Dylan replied that he didn't write "confessional songs".<ref name=williamson/>
