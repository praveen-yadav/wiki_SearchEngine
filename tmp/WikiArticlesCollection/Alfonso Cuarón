'''Alfonso Cuarón Orozco''' ({{IPA-es|alˈfonso kwaˈɾon}}; born 28 November 1961) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[film director]], [[screenwriter]], [[film producer|producer]] and [[Film editor|editor]] best known for his films ''[[A Little Princess (1995 film)|A Little Princess]]'' (1995), ''[[Y Tu Mamá También]]'' (2001), ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' (2004), ''[[Children of Men]]'' (2006), and ''[[Gravity (film)|Gravity]]'' (2013). His fantasy adventure series'' [[Believe (TV series)|Believe]]'' is due to be broadcast in 2013–2014.

Most of his work has been praised by both audience and critics. He has been nominated for three [[Academy Award]]s: [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for ''Y Tu Mamá También'', and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]] for ''Children of Men''. He also won a [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|BAFTA Award for Best Film not in the English Language]], as one of the producers of [[Guillermo del Toro]]'s ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]''.

Cuarón's brother [[Carlos Cuarón|Carlos]], as well as his son [[Jonás Cuarón|Jonás]], are writers and directors as well and both acted as co-writers in some of his works. He is also friends with fellow Mexican directors Guillermo del Toro and [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]], with whom he is described as "The Three Amigos of Cinema."

==Early life==
Alfonso Cuarón was born in [[Mexico City]], and is the son of Alfredo Cuarón, a nuclear physicist who worked for the United Nations' [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] for many years. He has two brothers, [[Carlos Cuarón|Carlos]], also a filmmaker, and Alfredo, a conservation biologist.

Cuarón studied Philosophy at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM) and filmmaking at CUEC ([[Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos]]), a faculty of the same University. There, he met director Carlos Marcovich and [[cinematographer]] [[Emmanuel Lubezki]], and they made what would be his first [[short film]], ''Vengeance Is Mine''. The controversy caused by the fact that the film was shot in English was not the reason he was expelled from the [[film school]]; the reason was that he did not get the authorization to commercialize his film. He decided to drop out.{{Citation-needed|date=November 2013}}

==Career==
Cuarón began working in television in Mexico, first as a technician and then as a director. His television work led to assignments as an assistant director for several Latin American film productions including ''[[Gaby: A True Story]]'' and ''[[Romero (film)|Romero]]'', and in 1991, he landed his first big-screen directorial assignment.

===''Sólo con tu pareja''===
''[[Sólo con tu pareja]]'' was a sex comedy about a womanizing businessman (played by [[Daniel Giménez Cacho]]) who, after spurning an attractive nurse, is fooled into believing he's contracted [[AIDS]]. In addition to writing, producing and directing, Cuarón co-edited the film with Luis Patlán. It is somewhat unusual for directors to be credited co-editors, although the [[Coen Brothers]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]] have both directed and edited nearly all of their films. Cuarón continued this close involvement in editing on several of his later films.

The film, which also starred cabaret singer [[Astrid Hadad]] and model/actress Claudia Ramírez (with whom Cuarón was linked between 1989 and 1993), was a big hit in Mexico. After this success, director [[Sydney Pollack]] hired Cuarón to direct an episode of ''[[Fallen Angels (TV series)|Fallen Angels]]'', a series of neo-noir stories produced for the Showtime premium cable network in 1993; other directors who worked on the series included [[Steven Soderbergh]], [[Jonathan Kaplan]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]] and [[Tom Hanks]].

===International success===
In 1995, Cuarón released his first feature film produced in the United States, ''[[A Little Princess (1995 film)|A Little Princess]]'', an adaptation of [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]'s classic novel. Cuarón's next feature was also a literary adaptation, a modernized version of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Great Expectations (1998 film)|Great Expectations]]'' starring [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] and [[Robert De Niro]].

Cuarón's next project found him returning to Mexico with a Spanish-speaking cast to film ''[[Y Tu Mamá También]]'', starring [[Gael García Bernal]], [[Diego Luna]] and [[Maribel Verdú]]. It was a provocative and controversial road comedy about two sexually obsessed teenagers who take an extended road trip with an attractive married woman in her late twenties. The film's open portrayal of sexuality and frequent rude humor, as well as the politically and socially relevant asides, made the film an international hit and a major success with critics. Cuarón shared an [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Original Screenplay with co-writer and brother [[Carlos Cuarón]].

In 2003, Cuarón directed the third film in the successful ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''. Cuarón faced criticism from some of the more purist ''Harry Potter'' fans for his approach to the film. At the time of the movie's release, however, author [[J. K. Rowling]] said that it was her personal favorite from the series so far.<ref>[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=76 J.K. Rowling] Accessed 17 January 2007.</ref> Critically, the film was also better received than the first two installments, with some critics remarking that it was the first ''Harry Potter'' film to truly capture the essence of the novels.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban/ RT: Prisoner of Azkaban]</ref> It remained as the most critically acclaimed film of the ''Harry Potter'' film franchise until the release of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2]]''.

Cuarón's feature ''[[Children of Men]]'', an adaptation of the [[P. D. James]] novel starring [[Clive Owen]], [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Michael Caine]], received wide critical acclaim, including three [[Academy Award]] nominations. Cuarón himself received two nominations for his work on the film in both Editing (with [[Alex Rodríguez (film editor)|Alex Rodríguez]]) and Adapted Screenplay (with several collaborators).

He created the production and distribution company [[Esperanto Filmoj]] (''Esperanto Films'', named because of his support for the international language [[Esperanto]]<ref>[http://esperantodocumentary.com/blog/an-interview-with-director-alfonso-cuaron Interview] by [[Sam Green]] with Cuarón.</ref>), which has credits in the films ''[[Duck Season]]'', ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'', and ''[[Gravity (film)|Gravity]]''.

Cuarón also directed the controversial public service announcement "I Am Autism" for [[Autism Speaks]] that was sharply criticized by disability rights groups for its negative portrayal of autism.<ref>http://asansouthwestohio.blogspot.com/2009/09/autistic-community-condemns-autism.html</ref>

In 2010, Cuarón began to develop the film ''[[Gravity (film)|Gravity]]'', a drama set in space. He was joined by producer [[David Heyman]], with whom Cuarón worked on ''Harry Potter''. Starring [[Sandra Bullock]] and [[George Clooney]], the film was released in the fall of 2013<ref>[http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/05/14/sandra-bullock-gravity-2013 Sandra Bullock, George Clooney sci-fi drama 'Gravity' pushed to 2013]</ref> and opened the [[70th Venice International Film Festival]] in August.<ref>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2404711/Venice-Film-Festival-2013-Sandra-Bullock-stuns-scarlet-dress-George-Clooney.html</ref>

In 2013, Cuarón created ''Believe'', an upcoming science fiction/fantasy/adventure series due to be broadcast as part of the 2013–14 United States network television schedule on NBC as a mid-season entry. The series was created by Cuarón for Bad Robot Productions and Warner Bros. Television.
