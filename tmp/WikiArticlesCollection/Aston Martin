'''Aston Martin Lagonda Limited''' is a English manufacturer of luxury [[sports car]]s. It was founded in 1913 by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford.

From 1994 until 2007, Aston Martin was a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[Ford Motor Company]], becoming part of Ford's [[Premier Automotive Group]] when it was formed in 2000. In March 2007, a consortium of investors led by [[Prodrive]] boss David Richards purchased 90% of Aston Martin for £479&nbsp;million, with Ford retaining a £40&nbsp;million stake.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.egmcartech.com/2007/03/12/ford-sells-aston-martin-for-925-million/ |title=Ford sells Aston Martin for $925 million |publisher=CarTech |date=12 March 2007 |accessdate=14 January 2013 }}</ref>
In December 2012, the Italian private equity fund Investindustrial<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investindustrial.com/en/ |title=Industrial Solutions and Capital |publisher=Investindustrial |accessdate=14 December 2013}}</ref>
signed a deal to buy 37.5% of Aston Martin, investing £150 million as a capital increase.<ref name=BBC20640529/><ref name=Reuters21207/>

===Founding===
Aston Martin was founded in 1913 by Lionel Martin and [[Robert Bamford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astonmartin.com/the-company/history |title=Company History 1913 – 1920 |publisher=Astonmartin.com |accessdate=14 December 2013}}</ref> The two had joined forces as Bamford & Martin the previous year to sell cars made by [[Singer (car)|Singer]] from premises in Callow Street, London where they also serviced [[GWK (car)|GWK]] and [[Calthorpe cars|Calthorpe]] vehicles. Martin raced specials at [[Aston Hill]] near [[Aston Clinton]], and the pair decided to make their own vehicles.<ref>{{cite journal|first=E.M. |last=Inman-Hunter |title=Notes on the Original Aston-Martin Company |journal=Motor Sport |month=May |year=1944 |page= 92 }}</ref> The first car to be named ''Aston Martin'' was created by Martin by fitting a four-cylinder [[Coventry-Simplex]] engine to the chassis of a 1908 [[Isotta-Fraschini]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Aston Martin: Car Manufacturer: Great British Design Quest |url=http://www.designmuseum.org/design/aston-martin |publisher=Design Museum}}</ref><ref>

They acquired premises at Henniker Mews<ref>[http://www.lurotbrand.co.uk/images/mewsnews/MN%202009%2001%20Spring.pdf Mews News]. ''Lurot Brand''. Published Spring 2009. Retrieved 24 September 2013.</ref> in [[Kensington]] and produced their first car in March 1915. Production could not start because of the outbreak of [[World War I]], and Martin joined the [[Admiralty]] and Bamford the [[Royal Army Service Corps]]. All machinery was sold to the [[Sopwith Aviation Company]].

=== Inter war years ===
After the war, the company was refounded at Abingdon Road, Kensington and a new car designed to carry the Aston-Martin name. Bamford left in 1920 and the company was revitalised with funding from [[Count Louis Zborowski]]. In 1922, Bamford & Martin produced cars to compete in the [[French Grand Prix]], which went on to set world speed and endurance records at [[Brooklands]]. Three works Team Cars with 16-valve [[:File:Bla 5mr.jpg|twin cam engines]] were built for racing and record breaking: chassis number 1914, later developed as the Green Pea; chassis number 1915, the [[Razor Blade]] record car; and chassis number 1916, later developed as the [[Halford Special]].

Approximately 55 cars were built for sale in two configurations, [[:File:Side valve.jpg|long chassis]] and short chassis. The company went bankrupt in 1924 and was bought by Lady Charnwood, who put her son John Benson on the board. The company failed again in 1925 and the factory closed in 1926, with Lionel Martin leaving.

Later that year, Bill Renwick, Augustus (Bert) Bertelli and investors which included Lady Charnwood took control of the company. They renamed it Aston Martin Motors and moved it to the former Whitehead Aircraft Limited works in [[Feltham]]. Renwick and Bertelli had been in partnership some years and had developed an overhead-cam four-cylinder engine using Renwick's patented combustion chamber design, which they had tested in an Enfield Allday chassis. The only "Renwick and Bertelli" motor car made, it was known as "Buzzbox" and still survives.

The pair had planned to sell their engine to motor manufacturers, but having heard that the Aston Martin was no longer in production realised they could capitalise on its reputation to jump start the production of a completely new car.

Between 1926 and 1937 Bertelli was both technical director and designer of all new Aston Martins, since known as "Bertelli cars". They included the 1½-litre "T-type", "International", "Le Mans", "MKII" and its racing derivative, the "Ulster", and the 2-litre 15/98 and its racing derivative, the "Speed Model". Most were open two-seater sports cars bodied by Bert Bertelli's brother [[commons:Category:Bertelli coachwork|Enrico (Harry)]], with a small number of long-chassis four-seater tourers, dropheads and saloons also produced.

Bertelli was a competent driver keen to race his cars, one of few owner/manufacturer/drivers. The "LM" team cars were very successful in national and international motor racing including at Le Mans and the Mille Miglia.

Financial problems reappeared in 1932. The company was rescued for a year by L. Prideaux Brune before passing it on to Sir Arthur Sutherland. In 1936, Aston Martin decided to concentrate on road cars, producing just 700 until [[World War II]] halted work. Production shifted to aircraft components during the war.

=== David Brown era ===
[[File:1958-aston-martin-archives.jpg|right|thumb|1958 Aston Martin DB Mark III]]
In 1947, tractor manufacturer [[David Brown Limited]] bought the company under the leadership of managing director [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|Sir David Brown]]—its "post-war saviour". The company also acquired [[Lagonda]] that year for its 2.6-litre [[W. O. Bentley]]-designed engine. Both companies shared resources and workshops, birthing the classic "DB" series of cars. In 1950, the company announced the [[Aston Martin DB2|DB2]], followed by the [[Aston Martin DB2/4|DB2/4]] in 1953, the [[Aston Martin DB2/4|DB2/4 MkII]] in 1955, the [[Aston Martin DB Mark III|DB Mark III]] in 1957 and the Italian-styled 3.7&nbsp;L [[Aston Martin DB4|DB4]] in 1958. 

While these models help Aston Martin establish a good racing pedigree, the DB4 stood out and yielded the famous [[Aston Martin DB5|DB5]] in 1963. The company stayed true to its emerging "[[Grand tourer|grand touring]]" style with the [[Aston Martin DB6|DB6]] (1965–70), and [[Aston Martin DBS|DBS]] (1967–1972).

The six-cylinder engines of these cars from 1954 up to 1965 were designed by [[Tadek Marek]].

=== 1970s—changing ownership ===
The Aston Martin company was often financially troubled. In 1972, the firm was sold to Company Developments, a [[Birmingham]]-based consortium chaired by [[William Wilson (businessman)|William Wilson]], MBE.<ref name=Autocar1972>{{cite journal|title = News and Comment: Aston Martin changes hands| volume = 136| journal=Autocar| issue= 3960)| page = 2 |date=9 March 1972}}</ref>

The company was resold in 1975 by its receiver following a further bankruptcy to North American businessmen [[Peter Sprague]] and [[George Minden]] for £1.05&nbsp;million.<ref name=Car197809>{{cite journal| first=Mel |last=Nicols| title = The Aston Miracle| journal=Car Magazine| pages=35–362 |month=September |year= 1978}}</ref> A successful turn-around strategy led to the recruitment of 360 new employees and, by 1977, a trading profit of £750,000.<ref name=Car197809/> The new owners pushed the company into modernising its line, producing the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (1977)|V8 Vantage]] in 1977, the convertible [[Aston Martin V8|Volante]] in 1978, and the one-off [[William Towns]]-styled [[Aston Martin Bulldog|Bulldog]] in 1980. Towns also styled the futuristic new [[Aston Martin Lagonda|Lagonda]] saloon, based on the V8 model.

In 1980 Aston-Martin sought to buy [[MG (car)|MG]], planning to design a new model and offering their take on an updated 1981 model [[MG MGB|MGB]]. The acquisition never developed, as the company was badly hit by the economic contraction of the early 1980s. Worldwide sales shrank to three cars per week, prompting chairman Alan Curtis, Sprague, and Minden to consider shutting down production to concentrate on service and [[Automotive restoration|restoration]]. At this point Curtis attended the 1980 Pace sponsored [[Stirling Moss]] benefit day at [[Brands Hatch]], and met fellow [[Farnham]] resident [[Victor Gauntlett]].

=== 1980s—Victor Gauntlett ===
Gauntlett bought a 12.5% stake in Aston Martin for £500,000 via [[Pace Petroleum]] in 1980, with Tim Hearley of CH Industrials taking a similar share. Pace and CHI took over as joint 50/50 owners at the beginning of 1981, with Gauntlett as executive chairman. Gauntlett also led the sales team, and after some development and publicity when it became the world's fastest 4-seater production car, was able to sell the [[Aston Martin Lagonda]] in Oman, Kuwait, and Qatar.<ref name=VGOBIT>{{cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030409/ai_n12682539|title= Obituary: Victor Gauntlett |publisher=The Independent (London) |accessdate=3 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080203121039/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030409/ai_n12682539 |archivedate = 3 February 2008}}</ref>

In 1982, Aston Martin was granted a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment]] by the [[Prince of Wales]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} The company holds the warrant to this day.

Understanding that it would take some time to develop new Aston Martin products, they created an engineering service subsidiary to develop automotive products for other companies. It was decided to use the name of the coachbuilding company [[Tickford]] which Aston Martin had owned since 1955,  the name being already associated with quality cars in the public perception. Products included a Tickford [[Austin Metro]], a Tickford [[Ford Capri]] and even Tickford train interiors, particularly on the [[Jaguar XJS]].<ref name=VGOBIT/> Pace continued sponsoring racing events, and now sponsored all Aston Martin Owners Club events, taking a Tickford-engined Nimrod Group C car owned by AMOC President [[Viscount Downe]], which came third in the Manufacturers Championship in both 1982 and 1983. It also finished seventh in the [[1982 24 Hours of Le Mans]] race. However, sales of production cars were now at an all time low of 30 cars produced in 1982.<ref name=VGOBIT/>

As trading became tighter in the petroleum market, and Aston Martin was requiring more time and money, Gauntlett agreed to sell Hays/Pace to the Kuwait Investment Office in September 1983. As Aston Martin required greater investment, he also agreed to sell his share holding to American importer and Greek shipping tycoon [[Peter Livanos]], who invested via his joint venture company with Nick and John Papanicalou, ALL Inc. Gauntlett remained chairman of the AML company 55% owned by ALL, with Tickford a 50/50 venture between ALL and CHI. The uneasy relationship was ended when ALL exercised options to buy a larger share in AML; CHI's residual shares were exchanged for CHI's complete ownership of Tickford, which retained development of existing Aston Martin projects. In 1984, Titan the main shipping company of the Papanicolaou's was in trouble, so Livanos's father George bought out the Papanicolaou's shares in ALL, while Gauntlett again became a shareholder with a 25% holding in AML. The deal valued Aston Martin/AML at £2&nbsp;million, the year it built its 10,000th car.<ref name=VGOBIT/>

Although as a result Aston Martin had to make 60 members of the workforce redundant, Gauntlett bought a stake in Italian styling house [[Zagato]], and resurrected its collaboration with Aston Martin.
[[File:Aston Martin Volante.jpg|right|thumb|Aston Martin V8 Vantage from ''[[The Living Daylights]]'']]
In 1986, Gauntlett negotiated the return of fictional British secret agent [[James Bond]] to Aston Martin. [[Cubby Broccoli]] had chosen to recast the character using actor [[Timothy Dalton]], in an attempt to re-root the Bond-brand back to a more [[Sean Connery]]-like feel. Gauntlett supplied his personal pre-production [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (1977)|Vantage]] for use in the filming of ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', and sold a Volante to Broccoli for use at his home in America. Gauntlett turned down the role of a [[KGB]] colonel in the film, however: "I would have loved to have done it but really could not afford the time."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegoldengun.co.uk/tld/tldpress.html |title=TLD – Press (Allies/MI6) |publisher=thegoldengun.co.uk |accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref>

The company needed funds to survive in the long term. In May 1987, Gauntlett and [[Prince Michael of Kent]] were staying at the home of Contessa Maggi, the wife of the founder of the original [[Mille Miglia]], while watching the revival event. Another house guest was [[Walter Hayes]], vice-President of [[Ford of Europe]]. Despite problems over the previous acquisition of [[AC Cars]], Hayes saw the potential of the brand and the discussion resulted in [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] taking a share holding in September 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicdriver.com/upload/classicinside/archive/CIUK2003-14.htm |title=ClassicInside – The ClassicDriver Newsletter |publisher=Classicdriver.com |accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref> In 1988, having produced some 5,000 cars in 20 years, a revived economy and successful sales of limited edition [[Aston Martin Vantage|Vantage]], and 52 [[Aston Martin V8 Zagato|Volante Zagato]] coupes at £86,000 each; the company finally retired the ancient V8 and introduced the [[Aston Martin Virage|Virage]] range—the first new Aston launched in 20 years.

Although Gauntlett was contractually to stay as chairman for two years, his racing interests took Aston back into sports car racing in 1989 with limited European success. However, with engine rule changes for the 1990 season and the launch of the new [[Aston Martin Volante]] model, Ford provided the limited supply of [[Cosworth]] engines to the [[Jaguar cars]] racing team. As the [[Aston Martin DB7|"small Aston" DB7]] would require a large engineering input, Ford agreed to take full control of Aston Martin, and Gauntlett handed over the company chairmanship to Hayes in 1991.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/13/1050172472030.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Keeping the best of British running | date=14 April 2003}}</ref> In 1992, the [[Aston Martin Virage#Vantage|Vantage]] version was announced, and the following year the company renewed the DB range by announcing the [[Aston Martin DB7|DB7]].

=== Ford era ===
Ford placed Aston in the [[Premier Automotive Group]], invested in new manufacturing and ramped up production. In 1994, Ford opened a new factory at Banbury Road in [[Bloxham]]. In 1995, the company produced a record 700 vehicles. Until the Ford era, cars had been produced by hand coachbuilding craft methods, such as the [[English wheel]]. In 1998 the 2,000th DB7 was built, and in 2002 the 6,000th, exceeding production of all previous DB models. The DB7 range was boosted by the addition of [[Aston Martin DB7|V12 Vantage]] models in 1999, and in 2001 the company introduced the V12-engined [[Aston Martin Vanquish]].

At the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan in 2003, Aston Martin introduced the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2005)|AMV8 Vantage]] concept car. Expected to have few changes before its introduction in 2005, the Vantage brought back the classic V8 engine to allow the company to compete in a larger market. 2003 also saw the opening of the [[Gaydon]] factory, the first purpose-built factory in Aston Martin's history. Also introduced in 2003 was the [[Aston Martin DB9|DB9]] coupé, which replaced the ten-year-old [[Aston Martin DB7|DB7]]. A [[Roadster (automobile)|convertible]] version of the DB9, the [[DB9 Volante]], was introduced at the 2004 Detroit Auto Show.

In October 2004, the company set up the dedicated {{convert|12500|m2}} [[Aston Martin Engine Plant|AMEP]] engine production plant within the [[Ford Germany]] [[Niehl, Cologne]] plant. With capacity to produce up to 5,000 engines a year by 100 specially trained personnel, like traditional Aston Martin engine production from Newport Pagnell, assembly of each unit is entrusted to a single technician from a pool of 30, with V8 and V12 variants assembled in under 20 hours. By bringing engine production back to within the company, the promise was that Aston Martin would be able to produce small runs of higher performance variants engines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astonmartins.com/factory/amep.htm |title=Aston Martin s . com – Aston Martin Engine Plant Cologne |publisher=Astonmartins.com |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref> This expanded engine capacity allowed in 2006, the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2005)|V8 Vantage]] sports car to enter production at the Gaydon factory, joining the DB9 and DB9 Volante.

In December 2003 Aston Martin announced it would return to motor racing in 2005. A new division was created, called [[Aston Martin Racing]], which became responsible, together with [[Prodrive]], for the design, development, and management of the DBR9 program. The DBR9 competes in the GT class in [[sports car racing|sports car races]], including the world-famous [[24 Hours of Le Mans]].

In 2006, an internal audit led Ford to consider divesting itself of parts of its [[Premier Automotive Group]]. After suggestions of selling [[Jaguar Cars]], [[Land Rover]], or [[Volvo Cars]] were weighed, Ford announced in August 2006 it had engaged [[UBS AG]] to sell all or part of Aston Martin at auction.<ref>Martinez J [http://www.motorauthority.com/cars/aston-martin/aston-martin-the-past-the-present-and-tomorrow/ motorauthority.com Ford confirms Aston Martin is for sale] at MotorAuthority, 31 August 2006</ref>

===2007—the Richards era===
On 12 March 2007, a consortium led by [[Prodrive]] chairman [[David Richards (racing)|David Richards]] purchased Aston Martin for £475m (US$848m).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30000-1254955,00.html |title=00-Heaven!

Ford kept a stake in the company valued at £40m (US$70m).

To demonstrate the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2005)|V8 Vantage]]'s durability across hazardous terrain and promote the car in China, the first east-west crossing of the [[Asian Highway Network#First car crossing|Asian Highway]] was undertaken between June and August 2007. A pair of Britons drove {{convert|12089|km|mi|abbr=in}} from Tokyo to [[Istanbul]] before joining the European motorway network for another {{convert|3259|km|mi|abbr=in}} to London. The promotion was so successful the company opened dealerships in Shanghai and Beijing within three months.<ref>{{cite press release
