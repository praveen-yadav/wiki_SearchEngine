==Career==

===Early career===
[[File:President Reagan with Drew Barrymore at a ceremony launching the Young Astronauts program on the south lawn. October 17, 1984.jpg|thumb|upright|With President [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]], 1984]]
Barrymore's career began when she was auditioned for a dog food commercial at 11 months old.<ref name="ActorsStudio" /> When she was bitten by her canine co-star, the producers were afraid she would cry, but she merely laughed, and was hired for the job.<ref name="ActorsStudio" /> She made her film debut in ''[[Altered States]]'' (1980), in which she had a small part.<ref name="Hello-Profile" /> A year later, she landed the role of Gertie, the younger sister of Elliott, in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', which made her one of the most famous child stars of the time and earned her the [[Young Artist Award]] as [[4th Youth in Film Awards#Best Young Performer in a Feature Film|Best Young Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture]] in 1982.<ref name="ActorsStudio" /><ref name="Young Artist Awards 4">{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms4.htm|title=4th Annual Youth in Film Awards|accessdate=March 31, 2011|work=YoungArtistAwards.org}}</ref> She received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination as [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress&nbsp;– Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture]] in 1984 for her role in ''[[Irreconcilable Differences]]'', in which she starred as a young girl divorcing her parents.<ref name="ActorsStudio" /><ref name="gg">{{cite web |title=HFPA&nbsp;– Awards Search |url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/28761 |accessdate=July 3, 2008 |publisher=Golden Globes}}</ref> In a review in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] states: "Barrymore is the right actress for this role precisely because she approaches it with such grave calm."<ref>{{cite web |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19840101/REVIEWS/401010349/1023 |title=Irreconciable Differences film review |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |date=January 1, 1984 |publisher=Roger Ebert.com |work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref>

===Rebellious era===
In the wake of this sudden stardom, Barrymore endured a notoriously troubled childhood. She was already a regular at the famed [[Studio 54]] when she was a little girl, smoking cigarettes at age nine, drinking alcohol by the time she was 11, smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] at 12, and snorting [[cocaine]] at 13.<ref name="Hello-Profile" /><ref name="ActorsStudio" /> Her nightlife and constant partying became a popular subject with the media.<ref name="Hello-Profile" /> She was in rehab at age 14.<ref name="Hello-Profile" /><ref name="ActorsStudio" /> A suicide attempt at age 14 put her back in rehab, followed by a three-month stay with singer [[David Crosby]] and his wife.<ref name="People-Bio" /> The stay was precipitated, Crosby said, because she "needed to be around some people that were committed to sobriety."<ref name="People-Bio" /> Barrymore later described this period of her life in her autobiography, ''Little Girl Lost.'' The next year, following a successful juvenile court petition for [[Emancipation of minors|emancipation]], she moved into her own apartment.<ref name="People-Bio" />

In her late teens, her rebelliousness played itself out on screen and in print. Barrymore forged an image as a manipulative teenage seductress, beginning with the film ''[[Poison Ivy (film)|Poison Ivy]]'' (1992), which was a box office failure, but was popular on video and [[Cable television|cable]].<ref name="Hello-Profile" /><ref>{{cite web |first=Owen |last=Gleiberman |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310405,00.html|title=Poison Ivy Review |accessdate=July 25, 2008 |date=May 8, 1992 |work=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref> That same year, at the age of 17, she posed nude for the cover of the July issue of ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine with her then-fiancé, actor [[Jamie Walters (American entertainer)|Jamie Walters]], as well as appearing nude in pictures inside the issue.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Bronwen|last=Hruska|title=Summer Sneaks Drew, We Hardly Knew Ye The littlest Barrymore finally seems back on track in solid film roles.

{{quote|"I really love my body and the way it is right now. There's something very awkward about women and their breasts because men look at them so much. When they're huge, you become very self-conscious. Your back hurts. You find that whatever you wear, you look heavy in. It's uncomfortable.
