'''Algae''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|dʒ|iː}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ɡ|iː}}; singular ''alga'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ɡ|ə}}, [[Latin language|Latin]] for "seaweed") are a very large and diverse group of simple, typically [[autotrophic]] organisms, ranging from [[unicellular]] to [[multicellular]] forms, such as the [[Macrocystis pyrifera|giant kelp]] (large brown alga), that may grow up to 50&nbsp;meters in length. Most are [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] and "simple" because they lack many of the distinct cell [[organelles]] and cell types found in [[embryophyte|land plants]]. The largest and most complex marine forms are called [[seaweed]]s.

Algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants, such as the phyllids (leaf-like structures) of [[bryophytes]], [[rhizoid]]s in [[nonvascular plants]], and the [[root]]s, [[leaf|leaves]], and other [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] that are found in [[tracheophyte]]s ([[vascular plants]]). Most are [[phototroph]]ic, although some groups contain members that are [[mixotroph]]ic, deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by [[osmotrophy]], [[myzocytosis|myzotrophy]], or [[phagocytosis|phagotrophy]]. Some unicellular [[species]] such as the green algae ''[[Prototheca]]'' and ''[[Helicosporidium]]'' have become parasitic heterotrophs, relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus<ref>Tartar, A., Boucias, D.

Algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from [[cyanobacteria]] that produce [[oxygen]] as a by-product of photosynthesis, unlike other photosynthetic [[bacteria]] such as [[Purple sulfur bacteria|purple]] and [[green sulfur bacteria]]. Fossilized filamentous algae from the [[Vindhya]] basin have been dated back to 1.6 to 1.7 billion years ago.<ref>{{cite pmid|19416859}}</ref>

==Etymology and study==
[[File:Gmelin - Historia Fucorum (Titelblatt).png|thumb|left|190px|Title page of [[Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin]], ''Historia Fucorum'', dated 1768.]] The singular ''alga'' is the Latin word for a particular seaweed and retains that meaning in English.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=alga, algae|encyclopedia=Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged with Seven Language Dictionary|volume=1|year=1986|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc}}</ref> The [[etymology]] is obscure. Although some speculate that it is related to Latin ''algēre'', "be cold",<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Eric|last=Partridge|title=algae|encyclopedia=Origins|year=1983}}</ref> there is no known reason to associate seaweed with temperature. A more likely source is ''alliga'', "binding, entwining."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=alga|first=Charlton T.|last=Lewis|coauthors=Charles Short|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1879|isbn=978-0-19-864201-5|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?layout.reflang=la;layout.refdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059;layout.reflookup=Alga;layout.refcit=;doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%231812}}</ref>

The [[Ancient Greek]] word for seaweed was ''φῦκος'' (fūkos or phykos), which could mean either the seaweed (probably red algae) or a red dye derived from it. The Latinization, ''fūcus'', meant primarily the cosmetic rouge. The etymology is uncertain, but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the Biblical ''פוך'' (pūk), "paint" (if not that word itself), a cosmetic eye-shadow used by the ancient Egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern Mediterranean. It could be any color: black, red, green, blue.<ref>{{cite book| author = Thomas Kelly Cheyne| coauthors = John Sutherland Black| title = Encyclopædia biblica: a critical dictionary of the literary, political and religious history, the archæology, geography, and natural history of the Bible| url = http://books.google.com/?id=GccVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA3525| year = 1902| publisher = Macmillan Company| isbn = | page = 3525 }}</ref>

Accordingly the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either [[phycology]] or algology, depending on whether the Greek or Latin root is used. The name ''Fucus'' appears in a number of [[taxon|taxa]].

==Classification==
[[File:Gephyrocapsa oceanica color.jpg|thumb|300px|False-color [[Scanning electron micrograph]] of the unicellular [[coccolithophore]] ''[[Gephyrocapsa]] oceanica''.]]
While [[cyanobacteria]] were traditionally considered algae, they are now classified as [[bacteria]] and therefore [[prokaryotes]] due to large differences such as the lack of a [[cell nucleus]] or membrane-bound [[organelle]]s, the presence of a single circular [[chromosome]], the presence of [[peptidoglycan]] in the cell walls, and [[ribosome]]s different in size and content from those of the [[eukaryote]]s.<ref name="BioRaven">{{cite book|title=Biology|edition=8|last=Losos|first=Jonathan B.|coauthors=Mason, Kenneth A.; Singer, Susan R.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year= 2007|isbn=978-0-07-304110-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jochemnet.de/fiu/bot4404/BOT4404_12.html|title=Botany 4404 Lecture Notes|first=Frank J|last=Jochem|publisher=Florida International University (FIU)|accessdate=2008-12-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081225083828/http://www.jochemnet.de/fiu/bot4404/BOT4404_12.html| archivedate= 25 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Rather than in [[chloroplast]]s, they conduct photosynthesis on specialized infolded cytoplasmic membranes called [[thylakoid membranes]]. Therefore, they differ significantly from algae despite occupying similar [[ecological niche]]s.

By modern definitions, algae are eukaryotes that conduct photosynthesis within membrane-bound organelles called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain circular [[DNA]] and are similar in structure to cyanobacteria, presumably representing reduced cyanobacterial [[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbionts]]. The exact nature of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae, reflecting different endosymbiotic events. The table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae. Their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right. Many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic. Some retain [[plastid]]s, but not chloroplasts, while others have lost plastids entirely.

|Cyanobacteria
|These algae have ''primary'' [[chloroplast]]s, i.e. the chloroplasts are surrounded by ''two membranes'' and probably developed through a single endosymbiotic event. The chloroplasts of red algae have [[chlorophyll]]s ''a'' and ''c'' (often), and [[phycobilin]]s, while those of green algae have chloroplasts with chlorophyll ''a'' and ''b''. Higher plants are pigmented similarly to green algae and probably developed from them, and thus [[Chlorophyta]] is a sister [[taxon]] to the plants; sometimes they are grouped as [[Viridiplantae]].

* [[Euglenids]]
|Green algae
|
These groups have green chloroplasts containing chlorophylls ''a'' and ''b''.<ref name="BioRaven"/> Their chloroplasts are surrounded by ''four and three membranes'', respectively, and were probably retained from ingested green algae.

'''Chlorarachniophytes''', which belong to the phylum [[Cercozoa]], contain a small [[nucleomorph]], which is a [[relict]] of the algae's [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].

'''Euglenids''', which belong to the phylum [[Euglenozoa]], live primarily in freshwater and have chloroplasts with only three membranes. It has been suggested that the endosymbiotic green algae were acquired through [[myzocytosis]] rather than [[phagocytosis]].

These groups have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls ''a'' and ''c'', and phycobilins.The shape varies from plant to plant. they may be of discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon shaped. They have one or more pyrenoids to preserve protein and starch.

In the first three of these groups ('''Chromista'''), the chloroplast has four membranes, retaining a [[nucleomorph]] in [[Cryptomonad]]s, and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor, although other evidence casts doubt on whether the [[Heterokonts]], [[Haptophyta]], and [[Cryptomonad]]s are in fact more closely related to each other than to other groups.<ref name="parfrey">{{cite journal | title = Evaluating Support for the Current Classification of Eukaryotic Diversity | author = Laura Wegener Parfrey, Erika Barbero, Elyse Lasser, Micah Dunthorn, Debashish Bhattacharya, David J Patterson, and Laura A Katz | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020220 | journal = PLoS Genet. |date=December 2006| volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = e220 | pmid = 17194223 | pmc = 1713255 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Burki F, Shalchian-Tabrizi K, Minge M, Skjæveland Å, Nikolaev SI, et al. | year = 2007 | title = Phylogenomics Reshuffles the Eukaryotic Supergroups | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 8: e790 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000790 | pages = e790 | pmid = 17726520 | pmc = 1949142 | editor1-last = Butler | editor1-first = Geraldine|bibcode = 2007PLoSO...2..790B }}</ref>

[[W.H.Harvey]] (1811—1866) was the first to divide algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation. This is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics. Harvey's four divisions are: red algae (Rhodophyta), brown algae (Heteromontophyta), green algae (Chlorophyta) and Diatomaceae.<ref name="Dixon 73">{{cite book| last = Dixon| first = P S| title = Biology of the Rhodophyta| year = 1973| publisher = Oliver & Boyd| location = Edinburgh| isbn = 978-0-05-002485-0| page = 232 }}</ref>

==Relationship to higher plants==
The first plants on earth probably evolved from shallow freshwater algae much like ''[[Chara (alga)| Chara]]'' almost 500 million years ago. These probably had an isomorphic [[alternation of generations]] and were probably filamentous. Fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as 475 million years ago.<ref>{{cite news | title = When plants conquered land | author = Ivan Noble | date = 18 September 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3117034.stm | publisher = BBC }}</ref><ref name="Wellman2003">{{cite journal

Most of the simpler algae are [[unicellular]] [[flagellate]]s or [[amoeboid]]s, but colonial and non-motile forms have developed independently among several of the groups. Some of the more common organizational levels, more than one of which may occur in the [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] of a species, are

* ''Palmelloid'': non-motile cells embedded in mucilage
* ''Filamentous'': a string of non-motile cells connected together, sometimes branching
* ''Parenchymatous'': cells forming a [[thallus (tissue)|thallus]] with partial differentiation of tissues

[[Phytohormone]]s are found not only in higher plants, but in algae too.<ref>[Tarakhovskaya, E. R.; Maslov, Yu, I.; Shishova, M. F., 200: Phytohormones in algae. Russian Journal of Plant Physiology 54(2): 163-170]</ref>

==Symbiotic algae==
Some species of algae form [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]] with other organisms. In these [[symbioses]], the algae supply photosynthates (organic substances) to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells. The host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae. Examples are as follows.

===Lichens===
{{Main|Lichens}}
[[File:Lichens near Clogher Head (stevefe).jpg|thumb|left|Rock lichens in Ireland.]]''[[Lichen]]s'' are defined by the International Association for Lichenology to be "an association of a [[fungus]] and a photosynthetic [[symbiont]] resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure."<ref>{{cite book| last = Brodo| first = Irwin M| last2 = Sharnoff| first2 = Sylvia Duran| last3 = Sharnoff| first3 = Stephen| last4 = Laurie-Bourque| first4 = Susan| title = Lichens of North America| year = 2001| publisher = Yale University Press| location = New Haven| isbn = 978-0-300-08249-4| page = 8 }}</ref> The fungi, or mycobionts, are from the [[Ascomycota]] with a few from the [[Basidiomycota]].

A photobiont may be associated with many specific mycobionts or live independently; accordingly, lichens are named and classified as fungal species.<ref>Brodo et al. (2001), page 6: "A species of lichen collected anywhere in its range has the same lichen-forming fungus and, generally, the same photobiont. (A particular photobiont, on the other hand, may associate with scores of different lichen fungi)."</ref> The association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone (they can be experimentally isolated). It is possible that the photobiont triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont.<ref>Brodo et al. (2001), page 8.</ref>

===Coral reefs===
{{Main|Coral|Coral reef|Symbiodinium}}
[[File:Coral Reef.jpg|thumb|left|Floridian coral reef]] [[Coral reef]]s are accumulated from the [[calcareous]] [[exoskeleton]]s of [[marine invertebrate]]s of the order [[Scleractinia]] (stony [[coral]]s). As [[Animal#Food and energy sourcing|animals]] they [[Metabolism|metabolize]] [[Sugar#Chemistry|sugar]] and [[oxygen]] to obtain [[energy]] for their cell-building processes, including [[secretion]] of the exoskeleton, with [[water]] and [[carbon dioxide]] as byproducts. As the reef is the result of a favorable equilibrium between construction by the corals and destruction by marine [[erosion]], the rate at which metabolism can proceed determines the growth or deterioration of the reef.

[[Dinoflagellate]]s (algal [[protist]]s) are often [[endosymbiont]]s in the cells of marine invertebrates, where they accelerate host-cell metabolism by generating immediately available sugar and oxygen through [[photosynthesis]] using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced by the host. Stony corals that are reef-building corals ([[hermatypic coral]]s) require [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] algae from the genus ''[[Symbiodinium]]'' to be in a healthy condition.<ref>{{cite book| last = Taylor| first = Dennis L| editor-last = Goff| editor-first = Lynda J| title = Algal Symbiosis: A Continuum of Interaction Strategies| year = 1983| publisher = CUP Archive| isbn = 978-0-521-25541-7| pages = 19–20| contribution = The coral-algal symbiosis }}</ref> The loss of ''Symbiodinium'' from the host is known as [[coral bleaching]], a condition which leads to the deterioration of a reef.

===Sea sponges===
{{Main|Sea sponge}}
Green algae live close to the surface of some sponges, for example, breadcrumb sponge (''[[Halichondria panicea]]''). The alga is thus protected from predators; the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80% of sponge growth in some species.<ref>http://uwsp.edu/cnr/UWEXlakes/laketides/vol26-4/vol26-4.pdf</ref>

==Life-cycle==
[[Rhodophyta]], [[Chlorophyta]] and [[Heterokontophyta]], the three main algal [[phylum|phyla]], have life-cycles which show tremendous variation with considerable complexity. In general there is an asexual phase where the seaweed's cells are [[diploid]], a sexual phase where the cells are [[haploid]] followed by fusion of the male and female [[gametes]]. Asexual reproduction is advantageous in that it permits efficient population increases, but less variation is possible. Sexual reproduction allows more variation, but is more costly.

The ''Algal Collection of the US National Herbarium'' (located in the [[National Museum of Natural History]]) consists of approximately 320,500 dried specimens, which, although not exhaustive (no exhaustive collection exists), gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species (that number remains unknown).<ref>{{cite web|title=Algae Herbarium|publisher=National Museum of Natural History, Department of Botany|year=2008|url=http://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/herbarium.htm|accessdate=2008-12-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081201112552/http://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/herbarium.htm| archivedate= 1 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Estimates vary widely. For example, according to one standard textbook,<ref name="John 02">John (2002), page 1.</ref> in the British Isles the ''UK Biodiversity Steering Group Report'' estimated there to be 20000 algal species in the UK. Another checklist reports only about 5000 species. Regarding the difference of about 15000 species, the text concludes: "It will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of species&nbsp;..."

Regional and group estimates have been made as well:
* 5000–5500 species of red algae worldwide
* "some 1300 in Australian Seas"<ref name="Huisman 00">Huisman (2000), page 25.</ref>
* 400 seaweed species for the western coastline of South [[Africa]],<ref name="Stegenga 97">Stegenga (1997).</ref> and 212 species from the coast of KwaZulu-Natal.<ref>{{cite book| last = Clerck| first = Olivier| title = Guide to the seaweeds of KwaZulu-Natal| year = 2005| isbn = 978-90-72619-64-8 }}</ref> Some of these are duplicates as the range extends across both coasts, and the total recorded is probably about 500 species. Most of these are listed in [[List of seaweeds of South Africa]]. These exclude phytoplankton and crustose corallines.
* 669 marine species from California (US)<ref name="Abbott and Hollenberg 76">Abbott and Hollenberg (1976), page 2.</ref>
* 642 in the check-list of Britain and Ireland<ref name="Hardy nad Guiry 06">Hardy and Guiry (2006).</ref>
and so on, but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources, these numbers have no more credibility than the British ones mentioned above. Most estimates also omit microscopic algae, such as [[phytoplankton]].

The most recent estimate suggests a total number of 72,500 algal species worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Guiry | first1 = M.

==Distribution==
The topic of distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of [[phytogeography]] in the mid-19th century AD.<ref>Round (1981), Chapter 8, Dispersal, continuity and phytogeography.</ref> Algae spread mainly by the dispersal of [[spore]]s analogously to the dispersal of Plantae by seeds and spores. Spores are everywhere in all parts of the Earth: the waters fresh and marine, the atmosphere, free-floating and in precipitation or mixed with dust, the [[humus]] and in other organisms, such as humans. Whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions of where the spore lands.

The spores of fresh-water algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind, as well as by living carriers.<ref>Round (1981), page 360.</ref> The bodies of water into which they are transported are chemically selective. Marine spores are spread by currents. Ocean water is temperature selective, resulting in phytogeographic zones, regions and provinces.<ref>Round (1981), page 362.</ref>

To some degree the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features, such as [[Antarctica]], long distances of ocean or general land masses. It is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality, such as "Pacific Algae" or "North Sea Algae". When they occur out of their localities, it is usually possible to hypothesize a transport mechanism, such as the hulls of ships. For example, ''Ulva reticulata'' and ''Ulva fasciata'' travelled from the mainland to [[Hawaii]] in this manner.

Mapping is possible for select species only: "there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns."<ref>Round (1981), Page 357.</ref> For example, ''Clathromorphum'' is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there.<ref>Round (1981), page 371.</ref> On the other hand, scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the "difficulties of undertaking such studies."<ref>Round (1981), page 366.</ref>

[[File:Phytoplankton Lake Chuzenji.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Phytoplankton, [[Lake Chuzenji]]]]
==Locations==
Algae are prominent in bodies of water, common in terrestrial environments and are found in unusual environments, such as [[Snow algae|on snow]] and [[Ice algae|on ice]]. Seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters, under {{convert|100|m|ft|abbre=on}}; however some have been recorded to a depth of {{convert|360|m|ft}}.<ref>Round (1981), page 176.</ref>

The various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology. Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column ([[phytoplankton]]) provide the food base for most marine [[food chain]]s. In very high densities ([[algal bloom]]s) these algae may discolor the water and outcompete, poison, or [[asphyxiate]] other life forms.

Algae are variously sensitive to different factors, which has made them useful as biological indicators in the [[Ballantine Scale]] and its modification.

==Cultural associations==
In [[Classical Chinese]], the word {{lang|zh|{{linktext|藻}}}} is used both for "algae" and (in the modest tradition of the [[scholar-official|imperial scholars]]) for "literary talent". The third island in [[Kunming Lake]] beside the [[Summer Palace]] in [[Beijing]] is known as the Zaojian Tang Dao which thus simultaneously means "Island of the Algae-Viewing Hall" and "Island of the Hall for Reflecting on Literary Talent".

To be competitive and independent from fluctuating support from (local) policy on the long run, biofuels should equal or beat the cost level of fossil fuels. Here, algae based fuels hold great promise, directly related to the potential to produce more biomass per unit area in a year than any other form of biomass. The break-even point for algae-based biofuels is estimated to occur in about ten to fifteen years.<ref>Barbosa & Wijffels</ref>{{when|date=November 2011}}

===Pollution control===
* Sewage can be treated with algae, reducing the usage of large amounts of toxic chemicals that would otherwise be needed.
* Algae can be used to capture [[fertilizers]] in runoff from farms. When subsequently harvested, the enriched algae itself can be used as fertilizer.
* Aquariums and ponds can be filtered using algae, which absorb nutrients from the water in a device called an [[algae scrubber]], also known as an "ATS".<ref>[http://www.reefbase.org/resource_center/publication/main.aspx?refid=10859 Nutrient Cycling In The Great Barrier Reef Aquarium. Proceedings of the 6th International Coral Reef Symposium, Australia, 1988, Vol. 2]</ref><ref>[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=NogyAAAAEBAJ&dq=U.S.+Patent+4333263 U.S. Patent 4333263, Issue Date June 8, 1982]</ref><ref>[http://www.hydromentia.com/Products-Services/Algal-Turf-Scrubber/Product-Documentation/Assets/ATS-Technical-Brochure.pdf Hydromentia Water Treatment Technologies]</ref><ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120083425/abstract Algal Response To Nutrient Enrichment In Forested Oligotrophic Stream. Journal of Phycology, June 2008]</ref>

[[Agricultural Research Service]] scientists found that 60-90% of nitrogen runoff and 70-100% of phosphorus runoff can be captured from [[manure effluents]] using an [[algal turf scrubber]] (ATS). Scientists developed the ATS, which are shallow, 100-foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form, and studied its efficacy for three years. They found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers, streams, and oceans. The enriched algae itself also can be used as a fertilizer. Researchers collected and dried the nutrient-rich algae from the ATS and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer. They found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ATS organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers.<ref>{{cite web
