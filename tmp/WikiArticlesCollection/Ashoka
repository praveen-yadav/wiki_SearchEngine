'''Ashoka Maurya''' (304–232 BCE), commonly known as '''Ashoka''' and also as '''Ashoka the Great''', was an [[Greater India|Indian]] emperor of the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya Dynasty]] who ruled almost all of the [[Indian subcontinent]] from ca. 269 BCE to 232 BCE.<ref>Thapur (1973), p. 51.</ref> One of India's greatest emperors, Ashoka reigned over most of present-day India after a number of military conquests. His empire stretched from the parts of the ancient territories of Khorasan, Sistan and Balochistan (unpartitioned) in what is now Afghanistan and possibly eastern Iran, through the  [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in Afghanistan, to present-day Bangladesh and the Indian state of [[Assam]] in the east, and as far south as northern [[Kerala]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]]. The empire had [[Taxila]], [[Ujjain]] and [[Pataliputra]] as its capital.

In about 260 BCE Ashoka waged a bitterly destructive war against the state of [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]] (modern [[Odisha]]).<ref name="Jerry Bentley 1993">Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 44.</ref> He conquered Kalinga, which none of his ancestors (starting from [[Chandragupta Maurya]]) had done. His reign was headquartered in [[Magadha]] (present-day [[Bihar]]). He embraced [[Buddhism]] after witnessing the mass deaths of the [[Kalinga War]], which he himself had waged out of a desire for conquest. "Ashoka reflected on the war in Kalinga, which reportedly had resulted in more than 100,000 deaths and 150,000 deportations."<ref>Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 45.</ref> Ashoka converted gradually to Buddhism beginning about 263 BCE at the latest.<ref name="Jerry Bentley 1993"/> He was later dedicated to the propagation of Buddhism across Asia, and established monuments marking several significant sites in the life of [[Gautama Buddha]]. "Ashoka regarded Buddhism as a doctrine that could serve as a cultural foundation for political unity."<ref>Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 46.</ref> Ashoka is now remembered as a philanthropic administrator.  In the Kalinga edicts, he addresses his people as his "children", and mentions that as a father he desires their good.

Ashoka is referred to as ''[[Samraat]] [[Chakravartin]] Ashoka'' – the "Emperor of Emperors Ashoka." His name "{{IAST|aśoka}}" means "painless, without sorrow" in [[Sanskrit]] (the [[a privativum|''a'' privativum]] and ''śoka'' "pain, distress"). In his [[Edicts of Asoka|edicts]], he is referred to as ''{{IAST|Devānāmpriya}}'' (Pali ''{{IAST|Devānaṃpiya}}'' or "The Beloved of the Gods"), and ''{{IAST|Priyadarśin}}'' (Pali ''{{IAST|Piyadasī}}'' or "He who regards everyone with affection"). His fondness for his name's connection to the [[Saraca asoca]] tree, or the "Asoka tree" is also referenced in the [[Ashokavadana]].

[[H.G. Wells]] wrote of Ashoka in his book ''[[The Outline of History]]'': "Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like, the name of Asoka shines, and shines, almost alone, a star." Along with the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], his legend is related in the 2nd-century ''[[Ashokavadana]]'' ("''Narrative of Asoka''," a part of ''[[Divyavadana]]''), and in the Sri Lankan text ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' ("''Great Chronicle''"). Ashoka played a critical role in helping make Buddhism a world religion.<ref>Bruce Rich.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ashoka was born to the [[Mauryan]] emperor [[Bindusara]] and a relatively lower ranked wife of his, Dharmā [or Dhammā]. He was the grandson of [[Chandragupta Maurya]], founder of Mauryan dynasty. The [[Avadana]] texts mention that his mother was queen Subhadrangī. According to [[Ashokavadana]], she was the daughter of a Brahmin from the city of Champa.<ref name="John1989"/>{{rp|205}} Empress Subhadrangī was a Brahmin of the [[Ajivika]] sect,<ref>''History And Doctrines of the Ajivikas A Vanished Indian Religion'' By A. L. Basham</ref> and was found to be a suitable match for Emperor Bindusara. Though a palace intrigue kept her away from the emperor, this eventually ended, and she bore a son. It is from her exclamation "I am now without sorrow," that Ashoka got his name. The [[Divyavadana|''Divyāvadāna'']] tells a similar story, but gives the name of the queen as Janapadakalyānī.<ref>{{cite book | title = A text book of the history of Theravāda Buddhism | author = K.

Ashoka had several elder siblings, all of whom were his half-brothers from other wives of Bindusara. His fighting qualities were apparent from an early age and he was given royal military training.  He was known as a fearsome hunter, and according to a legend, killed a lion with just a wooden rod. Because of his reputation as a frightening warrior and a heartless general, he was sent to curb the riots in the [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]] province of the Mauryan empire.<ref>Prachin bharoter itihas by Sunil Chatterjee</ref>

===Rise to Power===
[[File:Maurya Dynasty in 265 BCE.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maurya Empire]] at the age of  Ashoka. The empire stretched from Afghanistan to Bangladesh/[[Assam]] and from Central Asia (Afghanistan) to [[South India]].]]
The Buddhist text ''[[Divyavadana]]'' describes Ashoka putting down a revolt due to activities of wicked ministers. This may have been an incident in [[Bindusara]]'s times. [[Taranatha]]'s account states that [[Chanakya]], one of Bindusara's great lords, destroyed the nobles and kings of 16 towns and made himself the master of all territory between the eastern and the western seas. Some historians consider this as an indication of Bindusara's conquest of the Deccan while others consider it as suppression of a revolt. Following this, Ashoka was stationed at Ujjayini as governor.<ref name="Singh"/>

Bindusara's death in 273 BCE led to a war over succession. According to Divyavandana, Bindusara wanted his son Sushim to succeed him but Ashoka was supported by his father's ministers, who found Sushim to be arrogant and disrespectful towards them.<ref name="Swarup1999">{{cite book | author=Gyan Swarup Gupta | title=India: From Indus Valley Civilisation to Mauryas | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jbjT9GG__nEC&pg=PA268 | accessdate=30 October 2012 | date=1 January 1999 | publisher=Concept Publishing Company | isbn=978-81-7022-763-2 | pages=268–}}</ref> A minister named Radhagupta seems to have played an important role in Ashoka's rise to the throne. The Ashokavadana recounts Radhagupta's offering of an old royal elephant to Ashoka for him to ride to the Garden of the Gold Pavilion where King Bindusara would determine his successor. Ashoka later got rid of the legitimate heir to the throne by tricking him into entering a pit filled with live coals. Radhagupta, according to the Ashokavadana, would later be appointed prime minister by Ashoka once he had gained the throne. The ''[[Dipavansa]]'' and ''[[Mahavansa]]'' refer to Ashoka's killing 99 of his brothers, sparing only one, named [[Vitashoka]] or [[Vitashoka|Tissa]],<ref name="Singh"/> although there is no clear proof about this incident (many such accounts are saturated with mythological elements). The [[coronation]] happened in 269 BCE, four years after his succession to the throne.

===Early life as Emperor===
[[File:Asoka's Queen.jpg|thumb|An imaginary painting of Ashoka's Queen by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871–1951)]] 
Buddhist legends state that Ashoka was of a wicked nature and bad temper. He submitted his ministers to a test of loyalty and had 500 of them killed. He also kept a harem of around 500 women. When a few of these women insulted him for his "rough skin" after he fondly compared himself with the beauty of the Asoka tree (which according to the Ashokavadana, the women defiled by plucking off all of the flowers), he had the whole lot of them burnt to death. He also built  [[Ashoka's Hell]], an elaborate [[torture chamber]], deemed the "Paradisal Hell" because of its beautiful exterior contrasted with the acts carried out inside by his appointed executioner Girikaa,<ref name="Pradip2002">{{cite web | author=Pradip Bhattacharya |title=The Unknown Ashoka | url=http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&sd=Articles&ArticleID=758 | accessdate=30 November 2012 | year=2002 | publisher=Boloji.com}}</ref> which earned him the name of "çanḍa Ashoka" or "Chandaashoka," meaning "Ashoka the Fierce" in Sanskrit. Professor Charles Drekmeier cautions that the Buddhist legends intend to dramatise the change that Buddhism wrought in him, and therefore, exaggerate Ashoka's past wickedness and his piousness after the conversion.<ref name="Charles1962">{{cite book | author=Charles Drekmeier | title=Kingship and Community in Early India | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZmurAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA173 | accessdate=30 October 2012 | year=1962 | publisher=Stanford University Press | isbn=978-0-8047-0114-3 | pages=173–}}</ref>

Ascending the throne, Ashoka expanded his empire over the next eight years, from the present-day boundaries and regions of Burma–Bangladesh and the state of Assam in India in the east to the territory of present-day Iran / Persia and Afghanistan in the west; from the Pamir Knots in the north almost to the peninsula of southern India (i.e. Tamil Nadu / Andhra Pradesh).<ref name="Singh"/>

==Conquest of Kalinga==

While the early part of Ashoka's reign was apparently quite bloodthirsty, he became a follower of the [[Buddha]]'s teachings after his conquest of [[Kalinga, India|Kalinga]] on the east coast of India in the present-day states of [[Odisha]] and North Coastal [[Andhra Pradesh]]. Kalinga was a state that prided itself on its sovereignty and democracy. With its monarchical parliamentary democracy it was quite an exception in ancient Bharata where there existed the concept of [[Rajdharma]]. Rajdharma means the duty of the rulers, which was intrinsically entwined with the concept of bravery and dharma. The Kalinga War happened  eight years after his coronation. From his 13th inscription, we come to know that the battle was a massive one and caused the deaths of more than 100,000 soldiers and many civilians who rose up in defence; over 150,000 were deported.<ref>prachin bharater itihas by sunil chattopadhyay</ref> When he was walking through the grounds of Kalinga after his conquest, rejoicing in his victory, he was moved by the number of bodies strewn there and the wails of the kith and kin of the dead.

===Buddhist conversion===

Edict 13 on the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] Rock Inscriptions reflect the great remorse the king felt after observing the destruction of Kalinga:

{{quote|           His Majesty feels remorse on account of the conquest of Kalinga because, during the subjugation of a previously unconquered country, slaughter, death, and taking away captive of the people necessarily occur, whereat His Majesty feels profound sorrow and regret.}}

The Edict goes on to address the even greater degree of sorrow and regret resulting from Ashoka's understanding that the friends and families of deceased would suffer greatly too.<ref>{{cite book | last=Smith | first=Vincent A. | title=Rulers of India: Asoka: The Buddhist Emperor of India | publisher=Oxford at the Clarendon Press | year=1901 | pages=130}}</ref>

Legend says that one day after the war was over, Ashoka ventured out to roam the city and all he could see were burnt houses and scattered corpses. This sight made him sick and he cried the famous monologue:<ref>{{cite web | last= Kamath | first=Prabhakar | title=How Ashoka the Great Gave Brahmins A Song With Which They Conquered India | publisher=Nirmukta | url=http://nirmukta.com/2010/01/10/how-ashoka-the-great-gave-brahmins-the-gift-of-a-song-with-which-they-conquered-india/}}</ref>{{dubious|date=March 2013}}

{{quote|What have I done? If this is a victory, what's a defeat then? Is this a victory or a defeat?  Is this justice or injustice? Is it gallantry or a rout? Is it valor to kill innocent children and women? Did I do it to widen the empire and for prosperity or to destroy the other's kingdom and splendor?  One has lost her husband, someone else a father, someone a child, someone an unborn infant.... What's this debris of the corpses? Are these marks of victory or defeat? Are these vultures, crows, eagles the messengers of death or evil?}}

The lethal war with Kalinga transformed the vengeful Emperor Ashoka to a stable and peaceful emperor and he embraced Buddhism. This led to the expansion of Buddhism in the Mauryan empire and other kingdoms during his rule, and worldwide from about 250 BCE.<ref>{{cite book | last=Buckley | first=Edmund | title=Universal Religion | publisher=The University Association | url=http://books.google.com.ar/books/p/pub-4297897631756504?id=4Xs4Yb0FBaQC&pg=PA272&dq=ashoka&hl=es&cd=1&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=ashoka&f=false}}</ref> Prominent in this cause were his son [[Mahinda]] (Mahendra) and daughter [[Sanghamitra]] (whose name means "friend of the Sangha"), who established Buddhism in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).

===Death and legacy===
[[Image:Ashoka Rock Edict at Junagadh.jpg|thumb|[[Ashoka's Major Rock Edict]] at [[Junagadh]] contains inscriptions by Ashoka (fourteen of the [[Edicts of Ashoka]]), [[Rudradamanna I]] and [[Skandagupta]].]]
Ashoka ruled for an estimated forty years. Legend states that during his cremation, his body burned for seven days and nights.<ref name="Strong">{{cite book | title =Relics of the Buddha | author =John S. Strong | year =2007 | page =149 | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=xqAB6PKyP98C&pg=PA133&lpg=PA133&dq=relics+of+the+buddha+ashoka+mechanical&source=bl&ots=Xk-YpUX8yK&sig=VXIGdgZ6YLQg0XJ9BbrFi34kp2c&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FdxUUuC8CeqSyAHg_ICIBQ&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=relics%20of%20the%20buddha%20ashoka%20mechanical&f=false}}</ref> After his death, the Mauryan dynasty lasted just fifty more years until his empire stretched over almost all of the Indian subcontinent. Ashoka had many wives and children, but many of their names are lost to time. His supreme consort and first wife was Vidisha Mahadevi Shakyakumari Asandhimitra. Mahindra and Sanghamitra were twins born by her, in the city of [[Ujjain]]. He had entrusted to them the job of making Buddhism more popular across the known and the unknown world. Mahindra and Sanghamitra went into Sri Lanka and converted the King, the Queen and their people to Buddhism.

In his old age, he seems to have come under the spell of his youngest wife [[Tishyaraksha]]. It is said that she had got Ashoka's son [[Kunala]], the regent in [[Taxila|Takshashila]] and the heir presumptive to the throne, blinded by a wily [[wiktionary:stratagem|stratagem]]. The official executioners spared Kunala and he became a wandering singer accompanied by his favourite wife [[Kanchanmala]]. In [[Pataliputra]], Ashoka heard Kunala's song, and realised that Kunala's misfortune may have been a punishment for some past sin of the emperor himself. He condemned Tishyaraksha to death, restoring Kunala to the court. In the Ashokavadana, Kunala is portrayed as forgiving Tishyaraksha, having obtained enlightenment through Buddhist practice. While he urges Ashoka to forgive her as well, Ashoka does not respond with the same forgiveness.<ref name="Pradip2002">{{cite web | author=Pradip Bhattacharya |title=The Unknown Ashoka | url=http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&sd=Articles&ArticleID=758 | accessdate=30 November 2012 | year=2002 | publisher=Boloji.com}}</ref> Kunala was succeeded by his son, [[Samprati]], but his rule did not last long after Ashoka's death.

The reign of Ashoka Maurya might have disappeared into history as the ages passed by, had he not left behind records of his reign. These records are in the form of sculpted pillars and rocks inscribed with a variety of actions and teachings he wished to be published under his name. In the process, Ashoka left behind the first written language in India since the ancient civilisation of [[Harappa]]. The language used for inscription was [[Prakrit]].

In the year 185 BCE, about fifty years after Ashoka's death, the last Maurya ruler, [[Brihadratha Maurya|Brihadratha]], was assassinated by the commander-in-chief of the Mauryan armed forces, [[Pusyamitra Sunga]], while he was taking the Guard of Honor of his forces. Pusyamitra Sunga founded the [[Sunga dynasty]] (185 BCE-78 BCE) and ruled just a fragmented part of the Mauryan Empire. Many of the northwestern territories of the Mauryan Empire (modern-day Afghanistan and Northern Pakistan) became the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]].

In 1992, Ashoka was ranked No. 53 on [[Michael H. Hart]]'s [[The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History|list of the most influential figures in history]]. In 2001, a semi-fictionalized portrayal of Ashoka's life was produced as a motion picture under the title ''[[Asoka (2001 film)|Asoka]]''.

King Ashoka, the third monarch of the Indian Mauryan dynasty, has come to be regarded as one of the most exemplary rulers in world history.

====Buddhist kingship====
{{Main|History of Buddhism|History of Buddhism in India}} {{Further|Buddhism in Nepal|Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Buddhism in Burma}}
One of the more enduring legacies of Ashoka Maurya was the model that he provided for the relationship between Buddhism and the state. Throughout Theravada Southeastern Asia, the model of rulership embodied by Ashoka replaced the notion of divine kingship that had previously dominated (in the [[Angkor]] kingdom, for instance). Under this model of 'Buddhist kingship', the king sought to legitimise his rule not through descent from a divine source, but by supporting and earning the approval of the Buddhist ''[[sangha]]''. Following Ashoka's example, kings established monasteries, funded the construction of stupas, and supported the ordination of monks in their kingdom. Many rulers also took an active role in resolving disputes over the status and regulation of the sangha, as Ashoka had in calling a conclave to settle a number of contentious issues during his reign. This development ultimately lead to a close association in many Southeast Asian countries between the monarchy and the religious hierarchy, an association that can still be seen today in the state-supported [[Buddhism in Thailand|Buddhism of Thailand]] and the traditional role of the Thai king as both a religious and secular leader. Ashoka also said that all his courtiers always governed the people in a moral manner.

According to the legends mentioned in the 2nd-century CE text ''[[Ashokavadana]]'', Asoka was not non-violent after adopting Buddhism. In one instance, a non-Buddhist in [[Pundravardhana]] drew a picture showing the Buddha bowing at the feet of [[Nirgrantha Jnatiputra]] (identified with [[Mahavira]], the founder of [[Jainism]]). On complaint from a Buddhist devotee, Asoka issued an order to arrest him, and subsequently, another order to kill all the [[Ajivika]]s in Pundravardhana. Around 18,000 followers of the Ajivika sect were executed as a result of this order.<ref name="John1989">{{cite book | author=John S. Strong | authorlink = John S.

==Historical sources==
{{Main|Edicts of Ashoka|Ashokavadana|Mahavamsa|Dipavamsa}}

Ashoka was almost forgotten by the historians of the early British India, but [[James Prinsep]] contributed in the revelation of historical sources. Another important historian was British [[archaeologist]] [[John Hubert Marshall]], who was director-General of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]]. His main interests were [[Sanchi]] and [[Sarnath]], in addition to [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjodaro]]. Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]], a British archaeologist and army engineer, and often known as the father of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]], unveiled heritage sites like the [[Bharhut]] Stupa, Sarnath, Sanchi, and the Mahabodhi Temple. [[Mortimer Wheeler]], a British archaeologist, also exposed Ashokan historical sources, especially the [[Taxila]].

[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|Bilingual inscription (in Greek and [[Aramaic]]) by King Ashoka, discovered at [[Kandahar]] ({{small|[[National Museum of Afghanistan]]}}).]]
Information about the life and reign of Ashoka primarily comes from a relatively small number of Buddhist sources. In particular, the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Ashokavadana]]'' ('Story of Ashoka'), written in the 2nd century, and the two [[Pāli]] chronicles of Sri Lanka (the [[Dipavamsa]] and [[Mahavamsa]]) provide most of the currently known information about Ashoka. Additional information is contributed by the [[Edicts of Asoka]], whose authorship was finally attributed to the Ashoka of Buddhist legend after the discovery of dynastic lists that gave the name used in the edicts (''Priyadarsi''&nbsp;–  'He who regards everyone with affection') as a title or additional name of Ashoka Maurya. Architectural remains of his period have been found at [[Kumhrar]], [[Patna]], which include an 80-pillar [[hypostyle]] hall.

[[Edicts of Ashoka]] -The Edicts of Ashoka are a collection of 33 inscriptions on the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], as well as boulders and cave walls, made by Ashoka during his reign. These inscriptions are dispersed throughout modern-day Pakistan and India, and represent the first tangible evidence of Buddhism. The edicts describe in detail the first wide expansion of Buddhism through the sponsorship of one of the most powerful kings of Indian history, offering more information about  Ashoka's proselytism, moral precepts, religious precepts, and his notions of social and animal welfare.<ref name="Singh2012">{{cite journal | author=Upinder Singh |title=Governing the State and the Self: Political Philosophy and Practice in the Edicts of As´oka | journal=South Asian Studies | issue=28.2 | year=2012 | publisher=Routledge}}</ref>

[[Ashokavadana]] – The Ashokavadana is a 2nd-century CE text related to the legend of Ashoka. The legend was translated into Chinese by [[Fa Hien]] in 300 CE. It is essentially a Hinayana text, and its world is that of Mathura and North-west India. The emphasis of this little known text is on exploring the relationship between the king and the community of monks (the [[Sangha]]) and setting up an ideal of religious life for the [[laity]] (the common man) by telling appealing stories about religious exploits. The most startling feature is that Ashoka’s conversion has nothing to do with the Kalinga war, which is not even mentioned, nor is there a word about his belonging to the Maurya dynasty. Equally surprising is the record of his use of state power to spread Buddhism in an uncompromising fashion. The legend of Veetashoka provides insights into Ashoka’s character that are not available in the widely known Pali records.<ref name="Pradip2002">{{cite web | author=Pradip Bhattacharya |title=The Unknown Ashoka | url=http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&sd=Articles&ArticleID=758 | accessdate=30 November 2012 | year=2002 | publisher=Boloji.com}}</ref>

[[Mahavamsa]] -The Mahavamsa ("Great Chronicle") is a historical poem written in the [[Pali]] language of the kings of Sri Lanka. It covers the period from the coming of King Vijaya of [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]] (ancient Odisha) in 543 BCE to the reign of King Mahasena (334–361). As it often refers to the royal dynasties of India, the Mahavamsa is also valuable for historians who wish to date and relate contemporary royal dynasties in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is very important in dating the consecration of Ashoka.

[[Dipavamsa]] -The Dipavamsa, or "Deepavamsa", (i.e., Chronicle of the Island, in Pali) is the oldest historical record of Sri Lanka. The chronicle is believe to be compiled from [[Atthakatha]] and other sources around the 3rd or 4th century. King Dhatusena (4th century CE) had ordered that the Dipavamsa be recited at the [[Mahinda]] festival held annually in Anuradhapura.

==Perceptions==
The use of Buddhist sources in reconstructing the life of Ashoka has had a strong influence on perceptions of Ashoka, as well as the interpretations of his Edicts. Building on traditional accounts, early scholars regarded Ashoka as a primarily Buddhist monarch who underwent a conversion to Buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the Buddhist monastic institution. Some scholars have tended to question this assessment. The only source of information not attributable to Buddhist sources are the Ashokan Edicts, and these do not explicitly state that Ashoka was a Buddhist. In his edicts, Ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of his time: [[Buddhism]], [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Ajivika]]ism, and his edicts addressed to the population at large (there are some addressed specifically to Buddhists; this is not the case for the other religions) generally focus on moral themes members of all the religions would accept.

However, there is strong evidence in the edicts alone that he was a Buddhist. In one edict he belittles rituals, and he banned Vedic animal sacrifices; these strongly suggest that he at least did not look to the Vedic tradition for guidance. Furthermore, there are many edicts expressed to Buddhists alone; in one, Ashoka declares himself to be an "[[upasaka]]", and in another he demonstrates a close familiarity with Buddhist texts. He erected rock pillars at Buddhist holy sites, but did not do so for the sites of other religions. He also used the word [[Dharma (Buddhism)|"dhamma"]] to refer to qualities of the heart that underlie moral action; this was an exclusively Buddhist use of the word. Finally, the ideals he promotes correspond to the first three steps of the Buddha's graduated discourse.<ref>Richard Robinson, Willard Johnson, and Thanissaro Bhikkhu, ''Buddhist Religions'', fifth ed., Wadsworth 2005, page 59.</ref>

Interestingly, the Ashokavadana presents an alternate view of the faimilar Ashoka; one in which his conversion does not have anything to do with the Kalinga war or about his descent from the Maurya dynasty. Instead, Ashoka's reason for adopting non-violence appears much more personal. The Ashokavadana shows that the main source of Ashoka's conversion and the acts of welfare that followed are rooted instead in intense personal anguish at its core, from a wellspring inside himself (not so much necessarily spurred by a specific event). It thereby illuminates Ashoka as more humanly ambitious and passionate, with both greatness and flaws. ''This'' Ashoka is very different from the "shadowy do-gooder" of later Pali chronicles.<ref name="Pradip2002">{{cite web | author=Pradip Bhattacharya |title=The Unknown Ashoka | url=http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&sd=Articles&ArticleID=758 | accessdate=30 November 2012 | year=2002 | publisher=Boloji.com}}</ref>

Much of the knowledge about Ashoka comes from the [[Edicts of Ashoka|several inscriptions]] that he had carved on pillars and rocks throughout the empire. All his inscriptions present him as compassionate loving. In the Kalinga rock edits, he addresses his people as his "children" and mentions that as a father he desires their good.<ref name="VenSDhammika_1993"/> These inscriptions promoted Buddhist morality and encouraged nonviolence and adherence to [[dharma]] (duty or proper behaviour), and they talk of his fame and conquered lands as well as the neighbouring kingdoms holding up his might. One also gets some primary information about the Kalinga War and Ashoka's allies plus some useful knowledge on the civil administration. The Ashoka Pillar at [[Sarnath]] is the most notable of the relics left by Ashoka. Made of sandstone, this pillar records the visit of the emperor to Sarnath, in the 3rd century BCE. It has a four-lion capital (four lions standing back to back) which was adopted as the emblem of the modern Indian republic. The lion symbolises both Ashoka's imperial rule and the kingship of the [[Buddha]]. In translating these monuments, historians learn the bulk of what is assumed to have been true fact of the Mauryan Empire. It is difficult to determine whether or not some actual events ever happened, but the stone etchings clearly depict how Ashoka wanted to be thought of and remembered.

===Foci of Debate===
Recently scholarly analysis has determined that the three major foci of debate regarding Ashoka involve the nature of the Maurya empire; the extent and impact of Ashoka's pacifism, and what is referred to in the Inscriptions as ''dhamma'' or [[dharma]], which connotes goodness, virtue, and charity. Some historians{{Who|date=February 2013}} have argued that Ashoka's pacifism undermined the "military backbone" of the Maurya empire, while others have suggested that the extent and impact of his pacifism have been "grossly exaggerated. The ''dhamma'' of the Edicts has been understood as concurrently a Buddhist lay ethic, a set of politico-moral ideas, a "sort of universal religion," or as an Ashokan innovation. On the other hand, it has also been interpreted as an ''essentially political'' ideology that sought to knit together a vast and diverse empire. Scholars are still attempting to analyse both the expressed and implied political ideas of the Edicts (particularly in regard to imperial vision), and make inferences pertaining to how that vision was grappling with problems and political realities of a "virtually subcontinental, and culturally and economically highly variegated, 3rd century BCE Indian empire. Nonetheless, it remains clear that Ashoka's Inscriptions represent the earliest corpus of royal inscriptions in the Indian subcontinent, and therefore prove to be a very important innovation in royal practices.<ref name="Singh2012">{{cite journal | author=Upinder Singh |title=Governing the State and the Self: Political Philosophy and Practice in the Edicts of As´oka | journal=South Asian Studies | issue=28.2 | year=2012 | publisher=Routledge | pages=131–132}}</ref>

==Contributions==

===Global spread of Buddhism===
[[File:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|left|Stupa of [[Sanchi]].]]
As a [[Buddhist]] emperor, Ashoka believed that [[Buddhism]] is beneficial for all human beings as well as animals and plants, so he built a number of [[stupas]], [[Sangharama]], [[viharas]], [[chaitya]], and residences for Buddhist monks all over South Asia and Central Asia. According to the Ashokavadana, he ordered the construction of 84,000 stupas to house the Buddhas relics.<ref name="Strong">{{cite book | title =Relics of the Buddha | author =John S.

He sent his only daughter [[Sanghamitra]] and son [[Mahinda|Mahindra]] to spread Buddhism in Sri Lanka (then known as Tamraparni). Ashoka also sent many prominent Buddhist monks (bhikshus) Sthaviras like Madhyamik Sthavira to modern [[Kashmir]] and Afghanistan; Maharaskshit Sthavira to Syria, [[Persia]] / Iran, Egypt, Greece, Italy and Turkey; Massim Sthavira to Nepal, Bhutan, China and Mongolia; Sohn Uttar Sthavira to modern Cambodia, Laos, Burma (old name Suvarnabhumi for Burma and Thailand), Thailand and Vietnam; Mahadhhamarakhhita stahvira to [[Maharashtra]] (old name Maharatthha); Maharakhhit Sthavira and Yavandhammarakhhita Sthavira to [[South India]].

Ashoka also invited Buddhists and non-Buddhists for religious conferences. He inspired the Buddhist monks to compose the  sacred religious texts, and also gave all types of help to that end. Ashoka also helped to develop viharas (intellectual hubs) such as [[Nalanda]] and [[Taxila]]. Ashoka helped to construct  [[Sanchi]] and [[Mahabodhi Temple]]. Ashoka also gave donations to non-Buddhists. As his reign continued his even-handedness was replaced with special inclination towards Buddhism.<ref>N.V. Isaeva, ''Shankara and Indian philosophy''. SUNY Press, 1993, page 24.</ref> Ashoka helped and respected both Sramans (Buddhists monks) and Brahmins (Vedic monks). Ashoka also helped to organise the [[Third Buddhist council]] (c. 250 BCE) at Pataliputra (today's [[Patna]]). It was conducted by the monk [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] who was the spiritual teacher of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka.''

It is well-known that Ashoka sent ''dütas'' or emissaries to convey messages or letters, written or oral (rather both), to various people. The VIth Rock Edict about "oral orders" reveals this. It was later confirmed that it was not unusual to add oral messages to written ones, and the content of Ashoka's messages can be inferred likewise from the XIIIth Rock Edict: They were meant to spread his ''dhammavijaya,'' which he considered the highest victory and which he wished to propagate everywhere (including far beyond India). There is obvious and undeniable trace of cultural contact through the adoption of the Kharosthi script, and the idea of installing inscriptions might have travelled with this script, as [[Achaemenid]] influence is seem in some of the formulations used by Ashoka in his inscriptions. This indicates to us that Ashoka was indeed in contact with other cultures, and was an active part in mingling and spreading new cultural ideas beyond his own immediate walls.<ref name="Hinuber2012">{{cite journal | author=Oskar von Hinüber |title=Did Hellenistic Kings Send Letters to As´oka? | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | issue=130.2 | year=2010 | publisher=Freiburg | pages=262–265}}</ref>

In his edicts, Ashoka mentions some of the people living in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic countries]] as converts to Buddhism, although no Hellenic historical record of this event remain:

{{quote|Now it is conquest by Dhamma that Beloved-of-the-Gods considers to be the best conquest. And it (conquest by Dhamma) has been won here, on the borders, even six hundred yojanas away, where the Greek king Antiochos rules, beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the Cholas, the Pandyas, and as far as Tamraparni. Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the Kambojas, the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in Dhamma. Even where Beloved-of-the-Gods' envoys have not been, these people too, having heard of the practice of Dhamma and the ordinances and instructions in Dhamma given by Beloved-of-the-Gods, are following it and will continue to do so. | [[Edicts of Ashoka]], [[Ashoka's Major Rock Edict|Rock Edict]] (S.

Access to Insight: Readings in Theravāda Buddhism. Last accessed 01 Sep 2011.</ref>}}

It is not too farfetched to imagine, however, that Ashoka received letters from Greek rulers and was acquainted with the Hellenistic royal orders in the same way as he perhaps knew of the inscriptions of the Achaemenid kings, given the presence of ambassadors of Hellenistic kings in India (as well as the ''dütas'' sent by Ashoka himself).<ref name="Hinuber2012">{{cite journal | author=Oskar von Hinüber |title=Did Hellenistic Kings Send Letters to As´oka? | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | issue=130.2 | year=2010 | publisher=Freiburg | pages=262–265}}</ref>

The Greeks in India even seem to have played an active role in the propagation of Buddhism, as some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as [[Dharmaraksita]], are described in [[Pāli|Pali]] sources as leading Greek ([[Yona]]) Buddhist monks, active in spreading Buddhism (the [[Mahavamsa]], XII<ref name = "plgotw">Full text of the Mahavamsa [http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chapters.html Click chapter XII]</ref>).

Ashoka's military power was strong, but after his conversion to Buddhism, he maintained friendly relations with kingdoms in the South like [[Cholas]], [[Pandya]], [[Keralaputra]], the post Alexandrian empire, [[Tamraparni]], and [[Suvarnabhumi]]. His [[Ashoka's Major Rock Edict|edicts]] state that he made provisions for medical treatment of humans and animals in his own kingdom as well as in these neighbouring states. He also had wells dug and trees planted along the roads for the benefit of the common people.<ref name="VenSDhammika_1993">[http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/ashoka.html The Edicts of King Ashoka], English translation (1993) by  Ven.

===Ashoka Chakra===
{{main|Ashoka Chakra}}
[[File:Ashoka Chakra.svg|thumb|The [[Ashoka Chakra]], ''"the wheel of Righteousness" (Dharma in [[Sanskrit]] or Dhamma in [[Pali]])"'']]

The [[Ashoka Chakra]] (the wheel of Ashoka) is a depiction of the Dharmachakra (see [[Dharmacakra]]) or Dhammachakka in [[Pali]], the Wheel of Dharma ([[Sanskrit]]: Chakra means wheel). The wheel has 24 spokes which represent the 12 Laws of Dependent Origination and the 12 Laws of Dependent Termination. The Ashoka Chakra has been widely inscribed on many relics of the [[Mauryan]] Emperor, most prominent among which is the Lion Capital of [[Sarnath]] and The [[Ashoka Pillar]]. The most visible use of the Ashoka Chakra today is at the centre of the National flag of the Republic of India (adopted on 22 July 1947), where it is rendered in a Navy-blue color on a White background, by replacing the symbol of Charkha ([[Spinning wheel]]) of the pre-independence versions of the flag. The Ashoka Chakra can also been seen on the base of Lion Capital of Ashoka which has been adopted as the National Emblem of India.

The Ashoka Chakra was built by Ashoka during his reign. [[Chakra]] is a [[Sanskrit]] word which also means "cycle" or "self-repeating process." The process it signifies is the cycle of time- as in how the world changes with time.

A few days before India became independent on August 1947, the specially formed [[Constituent Assembly]] decided that the [[flag of India]] must be acceptable to all parties and communities.<ref name="FOTW">{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/in.html|title=India|accessdate= 2006-10-11|last=Heimer|first=Željko|date=2 July 2006|work=Flags of the World| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061018060420/http://crwflags.com/fotw/flags/in.html| archivedate= 18 October 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> A flag with three colours, Saffron, White and Green with the Ashoka Chakra was selected.

===Pillars of Ashoka (Ashokstambha)===
{{Main|Pillars of Ashoka}}
The pillars of Ashoka are a series of columns dispersed throughout the northern Indian subcontinent, and erected by Ashoka during his reign in the 3rd century BCE. Originally, there must have been many pillars of Ashoka although only ten with inscriptions still survive. Averaging between forty and fifty feet in height, and weighing up to fifty tons each, all the pillars were quarried at Chunar, just south of Varanasi and dragged, sometimes hundreds of miles, to where they were erected. The first Pillar of Ashoka was found in the 16th century by Thomas Coryat in the ruins of ancient Delhi. The wheel represents the sun time and Buddhist law, while the [[swastika]] stands for the cosmic dance around a fixed center and guards against evil.
There is no evidence of a swastika, or manji, on the pillars.

===Lion Capital of Asoka (Ashokmudra)===
{{Main|Lion Capital of Asoka}}
<!--  Commented out: [[File:Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka.jpg|thumb|This is the famous original sandstone sculpted [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] preserved at [[Sarnath Museum]] which was originally erected around 250 BCE atop an [[Ashoka Pillar]] at [[Sarnath]]. The angle from which this picture has been taken, minus the [[inverted bell]]-shaped [[Indian lotus|lotus]] flower, has been adopted as the [[National Emblem of India]] showing the Horse on the left and the Bull on the right of the [[Ashoka Chakra]] in the circular base on which the four [[Indian lion]]s are standing back to back. On the far side there is an Elephant and a Lion instead. The wheel "Ashoka Chakra" from its base has been placed onto the center of the [[National Flag of India]].]] -->

The Lion capital of Ashoka is a sculpture of four "Indian lions" standing back to back. It was originally placed atop the Aśoka pillar at [[Sarnath]], now in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], India. The pillar, sometimes called the Aśoka Column is still in its original location, but the Lion Capital is now in the [[Sarnath Museum]]. This Lion Capital of Ashoka from Sarnath has been adopted as the National Emblem of India and the wheel "[[Ashoka Chakra]]" from its base was placed onto the center of the [[National Flag of India]].

The capital contains four lions (Indian / Asiatic Lions), standing back to back, mounted on an abacus, with a frieze carrying sculptures in high relief of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull, and a lion, separated by intervening spoked chariot-wheels over a bell-shaped lotus. Carved out of a single block of polished sandstone, the capital was believed to be crowned by a 'Wheel of Dharma' (Dharmachakra popularly known in India as the "Ashoka Chakra").

The Ashoka Lion capital or the Sarnath lion capital is also known as the national symbol of India. The Sarnath pillar bears one of the Edicts of Ashoka, an inscription against division within the Buddhist community, which reads, "No one shall cause division in the order of monks." The Sarnath pillar is a column surmounted by a capital, which consists of a canopy representing an inverted bell-shaped lotus flower, a short cylindrical abacus with four 24-spoked Dharma wheels with four animals (an elephant, a bull, a horse, a lion).

The four animals in the Sarnath capital are believed to symbolise different steps of Lord [[Buddha]]'s life.
* The Elephant represents the Buddha's idea in reference to the dream of Queen Maya of a white elephant entering her womb.
* The Bull represents desire during the life of the Buddha as a prince.
* The Horse represents Buddha's departure from palatial life.
* The Lion represents the accomplishment of Buddha.

Besides the religious interpretations, there are some non-religious interpretations also about the symbolism of the Ashoka capital pillar at Sarnath. According to them, the four lions symbolise Ashoka's rule over the four directions, the wheels as symbols of his enlightened rule (Chakravartin) and the four animals as symbols of four adjoining territories of India.
