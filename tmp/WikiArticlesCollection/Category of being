In [[metaphysics]] (in particular, [[ontology]]), the different kinds or ways of [[being]] are called '''categories of being''' or simply '''categories.''' To investigate the categories of being is to determine the most fundamental and the broadest [[class (philosophy)|class]]es of entities. A distinction between such categories, in making the categories or applying them, is called an '''ontological distinction'''.

==Categorical distinctions==
The common or dominant ways to view categories as of the end of the 20th century.
#via [[bundle theory]] as bundles of properties – categories reflect differences in these
#via peer-to-peer comparisons or [[dialectic]]s – categories are formed by conflict/debate
#via [[value theory]] as leading to specific ends – categories are formed by choosing ends
#via [[conceptual metaphor]]s as arising from characteristics of human [[cognition]] itself – categories are found via [[cognitive science]] and other study of that biological system

Any of these ways can be criticized for...
*for seeking to make distinctions that aren't as universal as claimed ([[greedy reductionism]])
*for serious [[bias]] in [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]] ([[subject-object problem]] or [[God's eye view]])
*for relying on theological or spiritual claims [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]], for relying too much on surface conflict or current investigative priorities to point out differences
*for ignoring [[action (philosophy)|action]]
*for ignoring [[environmentalism (psychology)|the perceived]] or [[Gaia philosophy|biospheric]] context, or [[embodied philosophy|the cognitive mechanisms that perceive and invent categories]]
*or for relying on a complex empirical process of investigation that is poorly understood and only recently embarked upon.
In [[process philosophy]], this last is the only possibility, but historically philosophers have been loath to conclude that nothing exists but process.

==Categorization of existence==

===As bundles of properties===
[[Bundle theory]] is an ontological theory about objecthood proposed by the 18th century Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]], which states that objects only subsist as a collection (bundle) of properties, relations or tropes. In an ''epistemological'' sense, bundle theory says that all that can be known about objects are the properties which they are composed of, and that these properties are all that can be truly said to exist.

For example, if we take the concept of a black square, bundle theory would suggest that all that can be said to exist are the properties of a black square.

The properties of a black square are: '''Black,''' '''Regular''' and '''Quadrilateral. '''

However, from these properties alone, we cannot deduce any kind of underlying essence of a "black square", or some object called a "black square", except as a bundle of properties which constitute the object that we then go on to label as a ''"black square"'', but the object ''itself'' is really nothing more than a system of relations (or bundle) of properties. To defend this, Hume asks us to imagine an object without properties, if we strip the black square of it's properties (being black, regular and quadrilateral) we end up reducing the object  to literal non-existence.

===As formed by debate===

===Intuition as evasion===
A seemingly simpler way to view categories is as arising only from intuition.  Philosophers argue this evades the issue.  What it means to take the category [[physical object]] seriously as a category of being is to assert that the concept of physical objecthood cannot be reduced to or explicated in any other terms – not, for example, in terms of [[bundle theory|bundles of properties]] but only in terms of other items in that category.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In this way, many ontological controversies can be understood as controversies about exactly which categories should be seen as fundamental, irreducible, or primitive.  To refer to intuition as the source of distinctions and thus categories doesn't resolve this.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

====Ideology, dogma, theory====
Modern theories give weight to intuition, perceptually observed properties, comparisons of categories among persons, and the direction of investigation towards known specified ends, to determine what [[human]]ity in its present state of being needs to consider irreducible.  They seek to explain why certain beliefs about categories would appear in [[political science]] as [[ideology]], in [[religion]] as [[dogma]], or in [[science]] as [[theory]].

===As metaphors===
A set of ontological distinctions related by a single [[conceptual metaphor]] was called an [[ontological metaphor]] by [[George Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]], who claimed that such metaphors arising from [[experience]] were more basic than any properties or symbol-based comparisons.  Their [[cognitive science of mathematics]] was a study of the embodiment of basic symbols and properties including those studied in the [[philosophy of mathematics]], via [[embodied philosophy]], using [[cognitive science]].  This theory comes after several thousand years of inquiry into patterns and [[cognitive bias]] of humanity.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Categories of being==
Philosophers have many differing views on what the fundamental categories of being are. In no particular order, here are at least ''some'' items that have been regarded as categories of being by someone or other:{{who|date=December 2011}}

===Physical objects===
[[Physical object]]s are beings; certainly they are said to ''be'' in the simple sense that they ''exist'' all around us. So a house is a being, a person's body is a being, a tree is a being, a cloud is a being, and so on. They are beings because, and in the sense that, they are physical objects. One might also call them [[Physical body|bodies]], or physical [[particular]]s, or [[concrete]] things, or [[matter]], or maybe [[Substance theory|substance]]s (but bear in mind the word 'substance' has some special philosophical meanings).{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Minds===
[[Mind]]s – those "parts" of us that think and perceive—are considered beings by some philosophers. Each of us, according to [[common sense]] anyway, "has" a mind. Of course, philosophers rarely just assume that minds occupy a different category of beings from physical objects. Some, like [[René Descartes]], have thought that this is so (this view is known as [[dualism]], and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] also considers the mind as distinct from the body), while others have thought that concepts of the mental can be [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduced]] to physical concepts (this is the view of [[physicalism]] or [[materialism]]). Still others maintain though "mind" is a noun, it is not necessarily the "name of a thing" distinct within the whole person. In this view the relationship between mental properties and physical properties is one of [[supervenience]] &ndash; similar to how "banks" supervene upon certain buildings.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Classes===
We can talk about all human beings, and the planets, and all engines as belonging to [[class (philosophy)|class]]es. Within the class of human beings are all of the human beings, or the [[extension (semantics)|extension]] of the term 'human being'. In the class of [[planet]]s would be Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and all the other planets that there might be in the universe. Classes, in addition to each of their members, are often taken to be beings. Surely we can say that in some sense, the class of planets ''is'', or has being. Classes are usually taken to be [[abstract objects]], like sets; 'class' is often regarded as equivalent, or nearly equivalent, in meaning to '[[Set (mathematics)|set]]'. Denying that classes and sets exist is the contemporary meaning of [[nominalism]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Properties===
The redness of a red apple, or more to the point, the redness all red things share, is a ''[[property (philosophy)|property]]''. One could also call it an ''attribute'' of the apple. Very roughly put, a property is just a quality that describes an object. This will not do as a definition of the word 'property' because, like 'attribute', 'quality' is a near-synonym of 'property'. But these synonyms can at least help us to get a fix on the concept we are talking about. Whenever one talks about the size, color, weight, composition, and so forth, of an object, one is talking about the properties of that object. Some—though this is a point of severe contention in the [[problem of universals]] – believe that properties are beings; the redness of all apples is something that ''is.'' To deny that universals exist is the [[Scholastic philosophy|scholastic]] variant of [[nominalism]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Note that the color red is an objective property of an object. The intrinsic property is that it reflects radiation (including light) in a certain way. A human perceives that as the color red in his or her brain. An object thus has two types of properties, intrinsic (physical) and objective (observer specific).

===Relations===
An apple sitting on a table is in a [[logic of relatives|relation]] to the table it sits on. So we can say that there is a relation between the apple and the table: namely, the relation of sitting-on. So, some say, we can say that that relation has being. For another example, the [[Washington Monument]] is taller than the [[White House]]. Being-taller-than is a relation between the two structures. We can say that ''that'' relation has being as well. This, too, is a point of contention in the [[problem of universals]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Space and time===
Space and time are what physical objects are extended into. There is debate as to whether time exists [[presentism (philosophy of time)|only in the present]] or whether far away times are [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|just as real as far away spaces]], and there is debate (among who?) as to whether [[Curved space|space is curved]]. Many (nearly all?) contemporary thinkers actually suggest that [[spacetime|time is the fourth dimension]], thus reducing space and time to one distinct ontological entity, the [[spacetime|space-time continuum]].

===Propositions===
[[Proposition (philosophy)|Proposition]]s are units of meaning. They should not be confused with [[declarative sentence]]s, which are just sets of words in languages that refer to propositions. Declarative sentences, ontologically speaking, are thus ideas, a property of substances (minds), rather than a distinct ontological category. For instance, the English declarative sentence "snow is white" refers to the same proposition as the equivalent French declarative sentence "la neige est blanche"; two sentences, one proposition. Similarly, one declarative sentence can refer to many propositions; for instance, "I am hungry" changes meaning (i.e. refers to different propositions) depending on the person uttering it.

===Events===
Events are that which can be said to occur. To illustrate, consider the claim "John went to a ballgame"; if true, then we must ontologically account for every entity in the sentence. "John" refers to a substance. But what does "went to a ballgame" refer to? It seems wrong to say that "went to a ballgame" is a property that instantiates John, because "went to a ballgame" does not seem to be the same ontological kind of thing as, for instance, redness. Thus, events arguably deserve their own ontological category.

Properties, relations, and classes are supposed to be ''[[Abstraction|abstract]],'' rather than ''[[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]].'' Many philosophers say that properties and relations have an abstract existence, and that physical objects have a concrete existence. That, perhaps, is the [[paradigm case]] of a difference in ways in which items can be said to ''be,'' or to have being.

Many philosophers have attempted to reduce the number of distinct ontological categories. For instance,  [[David Hume]] famously regarded Space and Time as nothing more than psychological facts about human beings, which would effectively reduce Space and Time to ideas, which are properties of humans (substances). [[Nominalists]] and [[Philosophical realism|realists]] argue over the existence of properties and relations. Finally, events and propositions have been argued to be reducible to sets (classes) of substances and other such categories.

==History==

===Aristotle===
{{Main|Categories (Aristotle)}}

''Category'' came into use with [[Aristotle]]'s essay ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'', in which he discussed univocal and [[equivocal]] terms, predication, and ten categories:<ref>''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2412/2412-h/2412-h.htm Categories]'', translated by [[Ella Mary Edghill|E. M. Edghill]]. For the Greek terms, see ''[http://meta.montclair.edu/ancient/greek/aristotle_greek/ The Complete Works of Aristotle in Greek]'' (requires DjVu), Book 1 (''Organon''), ''Categories'' Section 4 (DjVu file's page 6).</ref>
*'''[[Substance theory|Substance]]''', essence (''<span lang=grc>[[ousia]]</span>'') — examples of primary substance: this man, this horse; secondary substance (species, genera): man, horse
*'''[[Quantity]]''' (''<span lang=grc>poson</span>'', how much), discrete or continuous — examples: two cubits long, number, space, (length of) time.
*'''[[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]]''' (''<span lang=grc>poion</span>'', of what kind or description) — examples: white, black, grammatical, hot, sweet, curved, straight.
*'''[[Finitary relation|Relation]]''' (''<span lang=grc>pros ti</span>'', toward something) — examples: double, half, large, master, knowledge.
*'''[[Place (mathematics)|Place]]''' (''<span lang=grc>pou</span>'', where) — examples: in a marketplace, in the Lyceum
*'''[[Time]]''' (''<span lang=grc>pote</span>'', when) — examples: yesterday, last year
*'''[[Human position|Position]]''', posture, attitude (''<span lang=grc>keisthai</span>'', to lie) — examples: sitting, lying, standing
*'''State''', condition (''<span lang=grc>echein</span>'', to have or be) — examples: shod, armed
*'''[[Action (philosophy)|Action]]''' (''<span lang=grc>poiein</span>'', to make or do) — examples: to lance, to heat, to cool (something)
*'''[[Affection (philosophy)|Affection]]''', passion (''<span lang=grc>paschein</span>'', to suffer or undergo) — examples: to be lanced, to be heated, to be cooled

===Kant===
In his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] proposed the following system:
*[[Quantity]]
**Unity
**Plurality
**[[Absolute (philosophy)|Totality]]
*[[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]]
**[[Reality]]
**[[Negation]]
**Limitation
*[[Relation of Ideas|Relation]]
**[[Inherence]] and [[Subsistence]] ([[Substance theory|substance]] and [[accident]])
**[[Causality]] and Dependence ([[cause]] and [[Result|effect]])
**Community (reciprocity)
*[[Modal logic|Modality]]
**[[Logical possibility|Possibility]]
**[[Existence]]
**[[Necessity]]

===Peirce and Husserl===
[[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who had read Kant closely and who also had some knowledge of Aristotle, proposed a system of merely three phenomenological categories: ''Firstness'', ''Secondness'', and ''Thirdness'', which he repeatedly invoked in his subsequent writings.

[[Edmund Husserl]] (1962, 2000) wrote extensively about categorial systems as part of his [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

For [[Gilbert Ryle]] (1949), a category (in particular a "[[category mistake]]") is an important semantic concept, but one having only loose affinities to an ontological category.

===Others===
Contemporary systems of categories have been proposed by [[John G. Bennett]] (The Dramatic Universe, 4 vols., 1956–65), [[Wilfrid Sellars]] (1974), [[Reinhardt Grossmann]] (1983, 1992), Johansson (1989), Hoffman and Rosenkrantz (1994), [[Roderick Chisholm]] (1996), [[Barry Smith (ontologist)]] (2003), and [[Jonathan Lowe]] (2006).
