'''Cuisine''' (from [[French language|French]] ''cuisine'', "cooking; culinary art; kitchen"; ultimately from [[Latin]] ''coquere'', "to cook") is a characteristic style of [[cooking]] practices and traditions,<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cuisine "Cuisine."] [http://www.thefreedictionary.com Thefreedictionary.com]. Accessed June 2011.</ref> often associated with a specific [[culture]]. Cuisines are often named after the geographic areas or regions from which they originate.<ref name="cuisine">[http://www.eldrbarry.net/hatr/eldrcuis.htm "The American Food Revolutions: Cuisines in America."] [http://www.eldrbarry.net Eldrbarry.net]. Accessed June 2011.</ref> A cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade. [[Religion|Religious]] food laws, such as [[Islamic dietary laws]] and [[Kashrut|Jewish dietary laws]], can also exercise a strong influence on cuisine. Regional [[food]] preparation traditions, customs and ingredients often combine to create dishes unique to a particular region.<ref>[http://whatscookingamerica.net/AmericanRegionalFoods/RegionalAmericanIndex.htm "Rediscover the flavors and traditions of true American cuisine!"] [http://whatscookingamerica.net Whatscookingamerica.net].

== History ==
Cuisine can be stated as the foods and methods of [[Outline of food preparation|food preparation]] traditional to a region or population.<ref name="cuisine"/> The major factors shaping a cuisine are [[climate]], which in large measure determines the native raw materials that are available, [[Economy|economic]] conditions, which affect [[trade]] and can affect food distribution, imports and exports, and religiousness or sumptuary laws, under which certain foods are required or proscribed.

Climate also affects the supply of fuel for cooking; a common Chinese food preparation method was cutting food into small pieces to cook foods quickly and conserve scarce firewood and charcoal. Foods preserved for winter consumption by [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]], [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]], and [[pickling]] have remained significant in [[List of cuisines|world cuisines]] for their altered gustatory properties even when these preserving techniques are no longer strictly necessary to the maintenance of an adequate food supply.

New cuisines continue to evolve in contemporary times. An example is [[fusion cuisine]], which combines elements of various [[Culinary art|culinary]] traditions while not being categorized per any one cuisine style, and generally refers to the innovations in many contemporary restaurant cuisines since the 1970s.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news | first=Robert | last= Lindsey| url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E0DD1F38F93BA2575BC0A963948260&sec=travel&pagewanted=print | title= California Grows Her Own Cuisine. | publisher=[[New York Times]] | date= 1985-08-18) }}</ref>

[[Global cuisines]] is a cuisine that is practiced around the world, and can be categorized by various regions according to the common use of major foodstuffs, including [[grain]]s, [[produce]] and cooking [[fat]]s. [[Regional cuisine]]s may vary based upon food availability and trade, cooking traditions and practices, and [[culture|cultural]] differences.<ref name="cuisine"/> For example, in Central and South America, corn ([[maize]]), both fresh and dried, is a [[staple food]]. In northern Europe, [[wheat]], [[rye]], and fats of animal origin predominate, while in southern Europe [[olive oil]] is ubiquitous and [[rice]] is more prevalent. In Italy the cuisine of the north, featuring [[butter]] and rice, stands in contrast to that of the south, with its wheat [[pasta]] and olive oil. China likewise can be divided into rice regions and [[noodle]] & [[bread]] regions. Throughout the Middle East and Mediterranean there is a common thread marking the use of [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], olive oil, [[lemon]]s, [[chili pepper|peppers]], and rice. The [[vegetarianism]] practiced in much of India has made [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]] (crops harvested solely for the dry seed) such as [[chickpea]]s and [[lentil]]s as significant as wheat or rice. From India to Indonesia the use of [[spice]]s is characteristic; [[coconut]]s and [[seafood]] are used throughout the region both as foodstuffs and as [[seasoning]]s.
