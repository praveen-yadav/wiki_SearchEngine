'''Conan the Barbarian''' (also known as '''Conan the Cimmerian''') is a fictional [[sword and sorcery]] hero that originated in [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] magazines and has since been adapted to [[Conan (books)|books]], [[Conan (comics)|comics]], several films (including ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' and ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]''), television programs ([[Conan the Adventurer (animated series)|cartoon]] and [[Conan the Adventurer (TV series)|live-action]]), [[Conan (game)#Video games|video games]], [[role-playing game]]s and other media. The character was created by writer [[Robert E. Howard]] in 1932 via a series of [[fantasy]] stories published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine.

==Publication history==
Conan the Barbarian was created by Howard in a series of [[fantasy]] stories published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine in 1932.<ref>Herron (1984). p. 149: "Robert E. Howard of Cross Plains, Texas, created one of the great mythic figures in modern popular culture, the Dark Barbarian… [which] put Howard in the select ranks of the literary legend-makers"</ref> For months, Howard had been in search of a new character to market to the burgeoning pulp outlets of the early 1930s. In October 1931, he submitted the short story "People of the Dark" to Clayton Publications' new magazine, ''[[Strange Tales of Mystery and Terror]]'' (June 1932). "People of the Dark" is a remembrance story of "[[past lives]]", and in its first-person narrative the protagonist describes one of his previous incarnations: Conan, a black-haired [[barbarian]] hero who swears by a deity called [[Crom (fictional deity)|Crom]]. Some Howard scholars believe this Conan to be a forerunner of the more famous character.<ref name="Hyborian Genesis">Louinet, pp. 429-453</ref>

In February 1932, Howard vacationed at a border town on the lower [[Rio Grande]]. During this trip, he further conceived the character of Conan and also wrote the poem "[[Cimmeria (poem)|Cimmeria]]", much of which echoes specific passages in [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} According to some scholars, Howard's conception of Conan and the Hyborian Age may have originated in [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''[[Thomas Bulfinch|The Outline of Mythology]]'' (1913) which inspired Howard to "coalesce into a coherent whole his literary aspirations and the strong physical, autobiographical elements underlying the creation of Conan."<ref name="Hyborian Genesis"/>

Having digested these prior influences after he returned from his trip, Howard rewrote the rejected story "[[By This Axe I Rule!]]" (May 1929), replacing his existing character [[Kull of Atlantis]] with his new hero, and retitling it "[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]". Howard also wrote "[[The Frost-Giant's Daughter]]", inspired by the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] of [[Daphne]],{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} and submitted both stories to ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine. Although "[[The Frost-Giant's Daughter]]" was rejected, the magazine accepted "[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]" after it received the requested polishing.<ref name="Hyborian Genesis"/>

"The Phoenix on the Sword" appeared in ''Weird Tales'' [[cover-date]]d December 1932. Editor [[Farnsworth Wright]] subsequently prompted Howard to write an 8,000 word essay for personal use detailing "the [[Hyborian Age]]," the fictional setting for Conan. Using this essay as his guideline, Howard began plotting "[[The Tower of the Elephant]]", a new Conan story that would be the first to truly integrate his new conception of the Hyborian world.<ref name="Hyborian Genesis"/>

The publication and success of "The Tower of the Elephant" would spur Howard to write many more Conan stories for ''Weird Tales''. By the time of Howard's suicide in 1936, he had written 21 complete stories, 17 of which had been published, as well as a number of unfinished fragments.<ref name="Hyborian Genesis"/>

Following Howard's death, the copyright of the Conan stories passed through several hands. Eventually, under the guidance of [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]], the stories were edited, revised and sometimes rewritten. For roughly forty years, the original versions of Howard's Conan stories remained out of print. The book publisher Berkley in 1977 issued three volumes using the earliest published form of the texts from ''Weird Tales'',{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} but these failed to displace the edited versions. In the 1980s and 1990s, the copyright holders of the Conan franchise permitted Howard's stories to go out of print entirely,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} while continuing to sell Conan works by other authors.

In 2000, the British publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz Science Fiction]] issued a two-volume, complete edition of Howard's Conan stories as part of its Fantasy Masterworks imprint, which including several stories that had never seen print in their original form. The Gollancz edition mostly used the versions of the stories as published in ''Weird Tales''.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In 2003, another British publisher, Wandering Star Books,<ref>[http://www.wanderingstarbooks.com/ Wandering Star Books], official website</ref> made an effort both to restore Howard's original manuscripts and to provide a more scholarly and historical view of the Conan stories. It published hardcover editions in England, which were republished in the United States by the Del Rey imprint of [[Ballantine Books]]. The first book, ''Conan of Cimmeria: Volume One (1932–1933)'' (2003; published in the US as ''[[The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian]]'') includes Howard's notes on his fictional setting, as well as letters and poems concerning the genesis of his ideas. This was followed by ''Conan of Cimmeria: Volume Two (1934)'' (2004; published in the US as ''[[The Bloody Crown of Conan]]'') and ''Conan of Cimmeria: Volume Three (1935–1936)'' (2005; published in the US as ''[[The Conquering Sword of Conan]]''). These three volumes combined include all of the original, unedited Conan stories.

==Setting==
[[Image:Chrysagon Hyboria 1024.jpg|thumb|A map of Robert E. Howard's ''Hyborian Age''.]]
{{main|Hyborian Age}}

The various stories of Conan the Barbarian occur in the fictional "[[Hyborian Age]]", set after the destruction of [[Atlantis]] and before the rise of the known [[Ancient history|ancient civilizations]]. This is a specific epoch in a fictional timeline created by Howard for many of the [[low fantasy]] tales of his [[artificial mythology|artificial legendary]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://hyboria.xoth.net/history/hyborian_age.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110525135846/http://hyboria.xoth.net/history/hyborian_age.htm | archivedate=May 25, 2011|title=The Hyborian Age|author=Howard, Robert E., adapted by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Walt Simonson]]|work=Conan Saga |issue= 50-54, 56|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The reasons behind the invention of the Hyborian Age were perhaps commercial: Howard had an intense love for history and historical dramas; however, at the same time, he recognized the difficulties and the time-consuming research work needed in maintaining historical accuracy. By conceiving a timeless setting &mdash; "a ''vanished'' age" &mdash; and by carefully choosing names that resembled human history, Howard shrewdly avoided the problem of historical anachronisms and the need for lengthy exposition.<ref name="Hyborian Genesis"/>

According to "The Phoenix on the Sword", the adventures of Conan take place ''"...Between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of the rise of the [[Aryan race|Sons of Aryas]]..."''<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink=Robert E.

==Personality and character==
{{original research|section|date=November 2011}}

Conan is a [[Cimmeria_(Conan)|Cimmerian]]. From Robert E. Howard's writings ([[The Hyborian Age]] among others) it is known that the Cimmerians were based on the [[Celts]] or [[Gaels]]. He was born on a battlefield and is the son of a village [[blacksmith]]. Conan matured quickly as a youth and, by age fifteen, he was already a respected [[warrior]] who had participated in the destruction of the [[Aquilonia (Conan)|Aquilonian]] outpost of Venarium. After its demise, he was struck by wanderlust and began the adventures chronicled by Howard, encountering skulking monsters, evil [[Magicians in fantasy|wizard]]s, tavern wenches, and beautiful [[princess]]es. He roamed throughout the [[Hyborian Age]] nations as a [[thief]], [[outlaw]], [[mercenary]] and [[pirate]]. As he grew older, he began commanding larger units of men and escalating his ambitions. In his forties, he seized the crown of the tyrannical [[monarch|king]] of Aquilonia, the most powerful kingdom of the Hyborian Age, having strangled the previous ruler on the steps of the throne. Conan's adventures often result in him performing heroic feats, though his motivation for doing so is largely to protect his own survival or for personal gain.

=== Appearance ===
{{Quote box

Howard]], ''[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]'', 1932.|width = 40%|bgcolor =}}
Conan has "sullen", "smoldering" and "volcanic" blue eyes with a black "square-cut mane". Howard once describes him as having a hairy chest and, while comic book interpretations often portray Conan as wearing a loincloth or other minimalist clothing, Howard describes the character as wearing whatever garb is typical for the land and culture in which Conan finds himself. Howard never gave a strict height or weight for Conan in a story, only describing him in loose terms like "giant" and "massive".<ref>Howard, Robert E. "[[A Witch Shall Be Born]]": "the man was almost a giant in stature"; "Knots and bunches of muscle started out of the massive arms".</ref> In the tales no human is ever described as being stronger than Conan, although several are mentioned as taller (such as the strangler Baal-pteor) or of larger bulk. In a letter to [[P. Schuyler Miller]] and [[John D. Clark]] in 1936 only three months before Howard's death, Conan is described as standing {{convert|6|ft|m}} and weighing {{convert|180|lb}} when he takes part in an attack on Venarium at only 15 years old, though being far from fully grown. 

Although Conan is muscular, Howard frequently compares his agility and way of moving to that of a panther (see, for instance, "[[Jewels of Gwahlur]]", "[[Beyond the Black River]]" or "[[Rogues in the House]]"). His skin is frequently characterized as bronzed from constant exposure to the sun. In his younger years, he is often depicted wearing a light [[Chainmail|chain]] shirt and a horned helmet, though appearances vary with different stories.

During his reign as king of Aquilonia, Conan was "... a tall man, mightily shouldered and deep of chest, with a massive corded neck and heavily muscled limbs. He was clad in silk and velvet, with the royal lions of Aquilonia worked in gold upon his rich jupon, and the crown of Aquilonia shone on his square-cut black mane; but the great sword at his side seemed more natural to him than the regal accoutrements. His brow was low and broad, his eyes a volcanic blue that smoldered as if with some inner fire. His dark, scarred, almost sinister face was that of a fighting-man, and his velvet garments could not conceal the hard, dangerous lines of his limbs."<ref>Howard, Robert E. . ''[[The Hour of the Dragon]]'', reprinted ''The Bloody Crown of Conan'', pp. 89-90</ref>

Howard imagined the Cimmerians as a proto-[[Celt]]ic people with mostly black hair and blue or grey eyes. Ethnically the Cimmerians to which Conan belongs are descendants of the Atlanteans, though they do not remember their ancestry. In his fictional historical essay "[[The Hyborian Age]]", Howard describes how the people of Atlantis — the land where his character [[King Kull]] originated — had to move east after a great cataclysm changed the face of the world and sank their island, settling where [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]] would eventually be located, Thus they are (in Howard's work) the ancestors of the Irish and Scottish (the Celtic Gaels) and not the Picts, the other ancestor of modern Scots who also appear in Howard's work. In the same work, Howard also described how the Cimmerians eventually moved south and east after the age of Conan (presumably in the vicinity of the [[Black Sea]], where the historical [[Cimmerians]] dwelt).

===Abilities===
{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
Despite his brutish appearance, Conan uses his brains as well as his brawn. The Cimmerian is a talented fighter, but his travels have given him vast experience in other trades, especially as a [[Thief (character class)|thief]]; he is also a talented commander, tactician and strategist, as well as a born leader. In addition, Conan speaks many languages, including advanced reading and writing abilities: in certain stories, he is able to recognize, or even decipher, certain ancient or secret signs and writings; for example, in "[[Jewels of Gwahlur]]" Howard states, "In his roaming about the world the giant adventurer had picked up a wide smattering of knowledge, particularly including the speaking and reading of many alien tongues.  Many a sheltered scholar would have been astonished at the Cimmerian's linguistic abilities..."  He also has incredible stamina, enabling him to go without sleep for a few days.  In "[[A Witch Shall be Born]]", Conan fights armed men until he is overwhelmed, captured, and [[crucifixion|crucified]], and goes a night and a day without water, but still possesses the strength to pull the nails from his feet, then to hoist himself into a horse's saddle and ride ten miles.

Another noticeable trait is his sense of humor, largely absent in the comics and movies but very much a part of Howard's original vision of the character, particularly apparent in "[[Xuthal of the Dusk]]", also known as "The Slithering Shadow." His sense of humor can also be rather grimly ironic, as was demonstrated by how he meted out justice to the treacherous - and ill-fated - innkeeper Aram Baksh in "[[Shadows in Zamboula]]."

He is a loyal friend to those true to him, with a barbaric code of conduct that often marks him as more honorable than the more sophisticated people he meets in his travels. Indeed, his straightforward nature and barbarism are constants in all the tales.

Conan is a formidable armed and unarmed combatant. With his back to the wall Conan is capable of engaging and killing opponents by the score. This is seen in several stories, such as "[[Queen of the Black Coast]]", "[[The Scarlet Citadel]]" and "[[A Witch Shall be Born]]". Conan is not superhuman, though; he did need the providential help of Zelata's wolf to defeat four Nemedian soldiers in the story ''[[The Hour of the Dragon]]''. Some of his hardest victories have come from fighting single opponents of inhuman strength: one such as Thak, the ape man from "[[Rogues in the House]]", or the strangler Baal-Pteor in "[[Shadows in Zamboula]]". Conan is far from untouchable and has been captured and defeated several times (on one occasion knocking himself out drunkenly running into a wall).

===Influences===
{{main|Robert E. Howard}}
Howard frequently corresponded with [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and the two would sometimes insert references or elements of each other's settings in their works. Later editors reworked many of the original Conan stories by Howard, thus diluting this connection. Nevertheless, many of Howard's unedited Conan stories are arguably part of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]].<ref>Louinet, p. 436</ref> Additionally, many of the Conan stories by Howard, de Camp and Carter used geographical place names from [[Clark Ashton Smith]]'s [[Hyperborean Cycle]].

==Book editions==
{{main|Conan (books)}}
[[Image:Conan usurper.jpg|thumb|''[[Conan the Usurper]]'' (1967). Cover art by [[Frank Frazetta]].]]
The character of Conan has proven durably popular, resulting in Conan stories by later writers such as [[Poul Anderson]], [[Leonard Carpenter]], [[Lin Carter]], [[L. Sprague de Camp]], [[Roland J. Green]], [[John C. Hocking]], [[Robert Jordan]], [[Sean A. Moore]], [[Björn Nyberg]], [[Andrew J. Offutt]], [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]], [[John Maddox Roberts]], [[Harry Turtledove]], and [[Karl Edward Wagner]]. Some of these writers have finished incomplete Conan manuscripts by Howard. Others were created by rewriting Howard stories which originally featured entirely different characters from entirely different milieus. Most, however, are completely original works. In total, more than fifty novels and dozens of short stories featuring the Conan character have been written by authors other than Howard.

[[Image:Tales of Conan.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Tales of Conan]]'' (Gnome Press, 1955). Cover art by [[Ed Emshwiller]].]]
The [[Conan (books)#Gnome Press editions, 1950-1957|Gnome Press edition]] (1950–1957) was the first hardcover collection of Howard's Conan stories, including all the original Howard material known to exist at the time, some left unpublished in his lifetime. The later volumes contain some stories rewritten by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] (like "The Treasure of Tranicos"), including several non-Conan Howard stories, mostly historical exotica situated in the [[Levant]] at the time of the crusades, which he turned into Conan yarns. The Gnome edition also issued the first Conan story written by an author other than Howard — the final volume published, which is by [[Björn Nyberg]] and revised by de Camp.

The [[Conan (books)#Lancer/Ace paperback editions, 1966-1977|Lancer/Ace editions]] (1966–1977), under the direction of de Camp and [[Lin Carter]], were the first comprehensive paperbacks, compiling the material from the Gnome Press series together in chronological order with all the remaining original Howard material, including that left unpublished in his lifetime and fragments and outlines. These were completed by de Camp and Carter, and new stories written entirely by the two were added as well. Lancer Books went out of business before bringing out the entire series, the publication of which was completed by Ace Books. Its covers featured dynamic images by [[Frank Frazetta]] that, for many fans,{{who|date=November 2011}} presented the definitive impression of Conan and his world. For decades to come, most other portrayals of the Cimmerian and his imitators were heavily influenced by the cover paintings of this series.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Editions after the Lancer/Ace series have been of either the original Howard stories or Conan material by others, but not both. Notable later editions of the Howard stories include the [[Conan (books)#Donald M. Grant editions, 1974-1989|Donald M. Grant editions]] (1974–1989); [[Conan (books)#Berkley editions, 1977|Berkley editions]] (1977); [[Conan (books)#Gollancz editions, 2000-2006|Gollancz editions]] (2000–2006), and [[Conan (books)#Wandering Star/Del Rey editions, 2003-2005|Wandering Star/Del Rey editions]] (2003–2005). Later series of new Conan material include the [[Conan (books)#Bantam editions, 1978-1982|Bantam editions]] (1978–1982), [[Conan (books)#Ace Maroto editions, 1978-1981|Ace Maroto editions]] (1978–1981), and [[Conan (books)#Tor editions, 1982-2004|Tor editions]] (1982–2004).

Several of the Lancer/Ace Conan versions are rewrites by de Camp and Carter of non Conan stories. For example, at least one El Borak in which the protagonist infiltrates the City of the assassins was rewritten with Conan replacing Francis Xavier Gordon and a supernatural element added.

==Conan chronologies==
{{main|Conan chronologies}}

In an attempt to provide a coherent timeline which fit the numerous adventures of Conan penned by Robert E. Howard and later writers, various "Conan chronologies" have been prepared by many people from the 1930s onward. Note that no consistent timeline has yet accommodated every single Conan story. The following are the principal theories that have been advanced over the years.
* [[Conan chronologies#Miller/Clark chronology|Miller/Clark chronology]] — ''A Probable Outline of Conan's Career'' (1936) was the first effort to put the tales in chronological order. Completed by [[P. Schuyler Miller]] and [[John D. Clark]], the chronology was later revised by Clark and [[L. Sprague de Camp]] in ''An Informal Biography of Conan the Cimmerian'' (1952).
* [[Conan chronologies#Robert Jordan chronology|Robert Jordan chronology]] — ''A Conan Chronology by Robert Jordan'' (1987) was a new chronology written by Conan writer [[Robert Jordan]] that included all written Conan material up to that point. It was heavily influenced by the Miller/Clark/de Camp chronologies, though it departed from them in a number of idiosyncratic instances.
* [[Conan chronologies#William Galen Gray chronology|William Galen Gray chronology]] — ''Timeline of Conan's Journeys'' (1997, rev. 2004), was fan William Galen Gray's attempt to create "a chronology of all the stories, both Howard and pastiche." Drawing on the earlier Miller/Clark and Jordan chronologies, it represents the ultimate expression of their tradition to date.
* [[Conan chronologies#Joe Marek chronology|Joe Marek chronology]] — Joe Marek's chronology is limited to stories written (or devised) by Howard, though within that context it is essentially a revision of the Miller/Clark tradition to better reflect the internal evidence of the stories and avoid forcing Conan into what he perceives as a "mad dash" around the Hyborian world within timeframes too rapid to be credible.
* [[Conan chronologies#Dale Rippke chronology|Dale Rippke chronology]] — ''The Darkstorm Conan Chronology'' (2003) was a completely revised and heavily researched chronology, radically repositioning a number of stories and including only those stories written or devised by Howard. The [[Conan (Dark Horse comic)|Dark Horse comic series]] follows this chronology.

====Conan the Barbarian (1982) and Conan the Destroyer (1984)====
{{main|Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Destroyer}}
[[Image:Conan the Barbarian 1982 film poster.jpg|thumb|''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982) poster.]]

The very first Conan cinematic project was planned by [[Edward Summer]]. Summer envisioned a series of Conan movies, much like the [[James Bond]] franchise. He outlined six stories for this film series, but none were ever made. An original screenplay by Summer and [[Roy Thomas]] was written, but their lore-authentic screen story was never filmed. However, the resulting film, ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982), was a combination of director [[John Milius]]' ideas and plots from Conan stories (written also by Howard's successors, notably [[Lin Carter]] and [[L. Sprague de Camp]]). The addition of [[Nietzschean]] motto and Conan's life philosophy were crucial for bringing the spirit of Howard's literature to the screen.

The plot of ''Conan the Barbarian'' (1982) begins with Conan being enslaved by the Vanir raiders of [[Thulsa Doom (character)|Thulsa Doom]], a malevolent [[warlord]] who is responsible for the slaying of Conan's parents and the genocide of his people. Later, Thulsa Doom becomes a cult leader of a [[religion]] that worships Set, a Snake God. The vengeful Conan, the [[Archery|archer]] Subotai and the [[thief]] Valeria set out on a quest to rescue a princess held captive by Thulsa Doom. The film was directed by John Milius and produced by [[Dino De Laurentiis]]. The character of Conan was played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and was his break-through role as an actor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Katz |first=Ephraim |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Film Encyclopedia |year=2006 |publisher=HarperCollins |location= |isbn=0-06-074214-3}}</ref>

This film was followed by a less popular sequel, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' in 1984.<ref name="tessay">{{cite news | first=Clark | last=Collis | coauthors= | title=Empire Essay: The Terminator | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 | work =Empire magazine | pages = | accessdate = 2007-04-22 | language = }}</ref> This sequel was a more typical [[fantasy]]-genre film and was even less faithful to Howard's Conan stories.

====''Conan the Conqueror'' (cancelled)====
The third film in the Conan trilogy was planned for 1987 to be titled ''Conan the Conqueror''. The director was to be either [[Guy Hamilton]] or [[John Guillermin]]. Since Arnold Schwarzenegger was committed to the film ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' and De Laurentiis's contract with the star had expired after his obligation to ''[[Red Sonja (1985 film)|Red Sonja]]'' and ''[[Raw Deal (1986 film)|Raw Deal]]'', he wasn't keen to negotiate a new one; thus the third Conan movie sank into [[development hell]]. The script was eventually turned into ''[[Kull the Conqueror]]''.

====Conan the Barbarian (2011)====
{{main|Conan the Barbarian (2011 film)}}
There were rumours in the late 1990s of another second Conan sequel, a story about an older Conan titled ''King Conan: Crown of Iron'', but Schwarzenegger's election in 2003 as governor of [[California]] ended this project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/453/453828p1.html |title=Goodbye Hollywood, Hello Sacramento |author=Brian Linder |date=October 8, 2003 |work=[[IGN|IGN.com]] |publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc. |accessdate=March 7, 2010}}</ref> [[Warner Bros.]] spent seven years trying to get the project off the ground, with development attempts made by [[The Wachowskis]], [[John Milius]], and [[Robert Rodriguez]], who left the project for ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]''. [[Boaz Yakin]] was hired in 2006 to start again. However, in June 2007 the rights reverted to [[Paradox Entertainment]], though all drafts made under Warner remained with them. Paradox's [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], Fredrik Malmberg, told ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' "we have great respect for Warner Bros., but after seven years, we came to the point where we needed to see progress to production." Paradox were auctioning the rights after and various groups took interest in producing, including [[New Line Cinema]], Hollywood Gang, and Millennium Films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967759.html |title='Barbarian's' at the gate for New Line |first==Michael|last= Fleming |date=June 27, 2007 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=March 9, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110629065353/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967759 | archivedate=June 29, 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Due to development-time frustrations felt when the rights were with Warner, Malmberg made deal terms where he was asking for $1 million for a one-year option, with another $1 million for each year's renewal. In August 2007, it was announced that Millennium had acquired the right to the project in an unrevealed seven-figure deal, with Malmberg and Millennium's [[Avi Lerner]], [[Boaz Davidson]], Joe Gatta and George Furla set to [[film producer|produce]]. The deal was brokered by Gatta, who originally made the deal between Paradox and Warner in 2002. Production was aimed for a Spring 2006 start, with the intention of having stories more faithful to the [[Robert E. Howard]] creation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117970116.html |title=Millennium wins rights to 'Conan' |first=Michael|last= Fleming |date=August 12, 2007 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Reed Elsevier|Reed Elsevier Inc.]] |accessdate=March 9, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110605200158/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117970116|archivedate=June 5, 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Television===
There have been three television series related to Conan: A live-action TV series and animated cartoon series — both entitled ''Conan the Adventurer'', as well as a second animated series entitled ''[[Conan and the Young Warriors]]''.
* '''[[Conan the Adventurer (animated series)|Conan The Adventurer]]''' was the name of a popular [[animated television series]]. Produced by ''Jetlag Productions'' and ''Sunbow Productions'', the series debuted on October 1, 1992, ran for 64 episodes and concluded exactly two years later, on October 1, 1994. The series involved Conan chasing [[Serpent Men]] across the world in an attempt to release his parents from eternal imprisonment as living statues.
* '''[[Conan and the Young Warriors]]''' was an [[animated television series]] which premiered in 1994 and ran for 13 episodes. [[DiC Entertainment]] produced the show and [[CBS]] aired this series as a spin-off to the previous [[Conan the Adventurer (animated series)|Conan the Adventurer]] animated series. This cartoon took place after the finale of ''Conan the Adventurer'' with Wrath-Amon vanquished and Conan's family returned to life from living stone. Conan soon finds that the family of one of his friends are being turned into wolves by an evil sorceress and he must train three warriors in order to aid him in rescuing them.
* '''[[Conan the Adventurer (TV series)|Conan: The Adventurer]]''' was a [[television series]] loosely based on Conan. The TV show premiered on September 22, 1997, and ran for 22 episodes. This live-action series starred German bodybuilder [[Ralf Möller]] as Conan and [[Danny Woodburn]] as his sidekick Otli. The storyline was quite different from the Conan lore of [[Robert E. Howard]]. In this adaptation, Conan is a pleasant and jovial person. Also in this version, Conan is not a loner but one member in a merry band of adventurers.

===Comics===
[[Image:Savagesword24 07.jpg|thumb|''[[The Tower of the Elephant|Tower of the Elephant]]'' comic by [[Roy Thomas|R. Thomas]], [[John Buscema|J. Buscema]] and [[Alfredo Alcala|A. Alcala]].]]
{{main|Conan (comics)}}
Conan the Barbarian has appeared in comics nearly non-stop since 1970. The comics are arguably, apart from the books, the vehicle that had the greatest influence on the longevity and popularity of the character. Aside from an earlier and unofficial Conan comic published in Mexico,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/conan/29-2438/ |title=Conan (comic book character) |publisher=Comicvine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref> the two main publishers of Conan comics have been [[Marvel Comics]] and [[Dark Horse Comics]]. Marvel Comics launched ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1970–1993) and the classic ''[[Savage Sword of Conan]]'' (1974–1995). Dark Horse launched their ''[[Conan (Dark Horse Comics)#Conan|Conan]]'' series in 2003. Dark Horse Comics is currently publishing compilations of the 1970s Marvel Comics series in [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] format.

The current president of the United States, [[Barack Obama]], is a collector of Conan the Barbarian comic books and a big fan of the character<ref>{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Swaine |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/3401168/Barack-Obama-The-50-facts-you-might-not-know.html |title=Barack Obama: The 50 facts you might not know |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=November 7, 2008 |accessdate=November 11, 2008 }}</ref> and appeared [[Barack Obama in comics|as a character]] in a comic book called ''[[Barack the Barbarian]]'' from [[Devil's Due]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Mail Foreign Service |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1168213/Barack-Barbarian-takes-scantily-clad-nemesis-Sarah-Palin-new-comic-superhero-role.html |title=Meet Barack the Barbarian taking on scantily clad nemesis Sarah Palin in new comic superhero role |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=April 7, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Spillius |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/5120374/Barack-Obama-and-Sarah-Palin-appear-in-comic-series.html |title=Barack Obama and Sarah Palin appear in comic series |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=April 7, 2009 |accessdate=November 26, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Alison |last=Flood |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/apr/08/obama-comic-palin |title=Obama battles Red Sarah in comic clash |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=November 26, 2009 }}</ref>

====Marvel Comics====
{{main|Conan (Marvel Comics)}}
[[Marvel Comics]] introduced a relatively lore-faithful version of Conan the Barbarian in 1970 with ''Conan the Barbarian'', written by [[Roy Thomas]] and illustrated by [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]. Smith was succeeded by [[penciller]] [[John Buscema]], while Thomas continued to write for many years. Later writers included [[J.M. DeMatteis]], [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]], [[Michael Fleisher]], [[Doug Moench]], [[Jim Owsley]], [[Alan Zelenetz]], [[Chuck Dixon]] and Don Kraar. In 1974, ''Conan the Barbarian'' series spawned the more adult-oriented, black-and-white comics magazine ''Savage Sword of Conan'', written by  Thomas with art mostly by Buscema or [[Alfredo Alcala]]. Marvel also published several [[graphic novels]] starring the character.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The Marvel Conan stories were also adapted as a newspaper [[comic strip]] which appeared daily and Sunday from 4 September 1978 to 12 April 1981. Originally written by Roy Thomas and illustrated by John Buscema, the strip was continued by several different Marvel artists and writers.

====Dark Horse Comics====
{{main|Conan (Dark Horse Comics)}}
[[Dark Horse Comics]] began their comic adaptation of the Conan saga in 2003. Entitled simply ''Conan'', the series was first written by [[Kurt Busiek]] and pencilled by [[Cary Nord]]. [[Tim Truman]] replaced Busiek when Busiek signed an exclusive contract with [[DC Comics]]; however, Busiek issues were sometimes used for filler. This series is an interpretation of the original Conan material by Robert E. Howard with no connection whatsoever to the earlier Marvel comics or any Conan story not written or envisioned by Howard supplemented by wholly original material.

A second series, ''[[Conan the Cimmerian (comics)|Conan the Cimmerian]]'' was released in 2008 by [[Tim Truman]] (writer) and [[Tomás Giorello]] (artist).  The series ran for twenty-six issues, including an introductory "zero" issue.

Dark Horse's third series, ''[[Conan: Road of Kings]]'', began in December 2010 by [[Roy Thomas]] (writer) and [[Mike Hawthorne]] (artist) and ran for twelve issues.

A fourth series, ''Conan the Barbarian'', began in February 2012 by [[Brian Wood (comic creator)|Brian Wood]] (writer) and [[Becky Cloonan]] (artist).  It is stated to run for twenty-five issues, and expand on Robert E. Howard's ''[[Queen of the Black Coast]]''.

==Copyright and trademark dispute==
The name Conan and the names of Robert E. Howard's other principal characters are claimed as trademarked by [[Paradox Entertainment]] of Stockholm, Sweden, through its US subsidiary Paradox Entertainment Inc.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Paradox copyrights stories written by other authors under license from Conan Properties Inc.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

However, since Robert E. Howard published his Conan stories at a time when the date of publication was the marker (1932 through 1963), and any new owners failed to renew them to maintain the copyrights,<ref>[http://www.robert-e-howard.org/AnotherThought4rerevised.html Paul Herman's research on the copyright status of Robert Howard's work]</ref> the exact copyright status of all of Howard's 'Conan' works is in question.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.cornell.edu/training/Hirtle_Public_Domain.htm |title=Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States at Cornell University}}</ref>  In practice, most of the Conan stories exist in at least two versions subject to different copyright standards: The original ''Weird Tales'' publications before or shortly after Howard's death, which are generally understood to be [[public domain]], and "restored" versions based on manuscripts that were unpublished in Howard's lifetime.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The Australian site of [[Project Gutenberg]] has many Robert E. Howard stories, including several Conan stories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/plusfifty-a-m.html#letterH |title=Robert Ervin HOWARD (1906-1936) |publisher= (archived stories) Project Gutenberg}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, works fall into the [[public domain]] 70 years after the death of an author. Therefore, with Howard having died in 1936, his works have been in the public domain since 2006.
