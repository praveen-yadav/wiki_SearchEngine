</ref> was an American [[computer science|computer scientist]] who "helped shape the digital era."<ref name=NYTimes/>  He created the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] and, with long-time colleague [[Ken Thompson]], the [[Unix]] [[operating system]].<ref name=NYTimes/>  Ritchie and Thompson received the [[Turing Award]] from the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] in 1983, the [[IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal|Hamming Medal]] from the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] in 1990 and the [[National Medal of Technology]] from [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] in 1999.  Ritchie was the head of [[Lucent Technologies]] [[System software|System Software]] Research Department when he retired in 2007.  He was the 'R' in [[The C Programming Language|K&R C]] and commonly known by his [[User (computing)|username]] '''<tt>dmr</tt>'''.

==Early life==
Ritchie was born in [[Bronxville, New York]]. His father was Alistair E. Ritchie, a longtime [[Bell Labs]] scientist and co-author of ''The Design of Switching Circuits'' on [[switching circuit theory]]. He moved with his family to [[Summit, New Jersey]], as a child, where he graduated from [[Summit High School (New Jersey)|Summit High School]].<ref>Keill, Liz. [http://www.nj.com/independentpress/index.ssf/2011/02/japan_prize_for_unix_was_a_sur.html "Berkeley Heights man wins Japan Prize for inventing UNIX operating system"], ''Independent Press'', February 1, 2011. Accessed October 17, 2011. "Ritchie, 69, has lived in Berkeley Heights for 15 years. He was born in Bronxville, New York, grew up in Summit and attended Summit High School before going to Harvard University."</ref>

==Career==
Ritchie graduated from [[Harvard University]] with [[academic degree|degree]]s in [[physics]] and [[applied mathematics]]. In 1967, he began working at the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center, and in 1968, he received a PhD from Harvard under the supervision of [[Patrick C. Fischer]], his doctoral dissertation being "Program Structure and Computational Complexity".<ref>{{mathgenealogy|name=Dennis M. Ritchie|id=155881}}</ref>
[[File:Ken n dennis.jpg|left|thumb|Ken Thompson (left) and Dennis Ritchie (right)]]
Ritchie was best known as the creator of the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], a key developer of the [[Unix]] operating system, and co-author of the book ''[[The C Programming Language]]'', and was the 'R' in ''K&R'' (a common reference to the book's authors [[Brian Kernighan|Kernighan]] and Ritchie).  Ritchie worked together with [[Ken Thompson]], the scientist credited with writing the original Unix; one of Ritchie's most important contributions to Unix was its porting to different machines and platforms.<ref>[Pioneer Programmer Shaped the Evolution of Computers, Wall Street Journal, October 14, 2011, p.A7]</ref>

The C language is widely used today in application, [[operating system]], and [[embedded system]] development, and its influence is seen in most modern programming languages. Unix has also been influential, establishing concepts and principles that are now precepts of computing.

==Awards==
[[File:Medal lg.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Ken Thompson|Thompson]] (left) and Ritchie (center) receiving the National Medal of Technology from President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] in 1999]]
In 1983, Ritchie and Thompson received the [[Turing Award]]<cite> for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system.</cite> Ritchie's Turing Award lecture was titled "Reflections on Software Research".<ref>{{Citation

In 1997, both Ritchie and Thompson were made Fellows of the [[Computer History Museum]], "for co-creation of the UNIX operating system, and for development of the C programming language."

On April 21, 1999, Thompson and Ritchie jointly received the [[National Medal of Technology]] of 1998 from President [[Bill Clinton]] for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, according to the citation for the medal, "led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age".<ref name="NationalMedalAnnouncement">''[http://www.bell-labs.com/news/1998/december/9/1.html Ritchie and Thompson &#091;to&#093; Get National Medal of Technology]'' Bell Labs pre-announcement</ref><ref name="NationalMedalPressRelease">''[http://www.bell-labs.com/news/1999/april/28/1.html Ritchie and Thompson Receive National Medal of Technology from President Clinton]'' Bell Labs press release</ref>

In 2005, the [[Industrial Research Institute]] awarded Ritchie with its [[IRI Achievement Award|Achievement Award]] in recognition of his contribution to science and technology, and to society generally, with his development of the Unix operating system.<ref>[http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/!ut/p/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd4x3cg_SL8h2VAQAv8HY9g!!?LMSG_CABINET=Docs_and_Resource_Ctr&LMSG_CONTENT_FILE=News_Releases_LU_2005/LU_News_Article_005372.xml "Dennis Ritchie, Bell Labs Researcher and Co-Inventor of Unix, Receives 2005 Industrial Research Institute Achievement Award"], Alcatel/Lucent Press Release, Nov. 15, 2005, accessed Feb. 8, 2012.</ref>

In 2011, Ritchie, along with Thompson, was awarded the [[Japan Prize|Japan Prize for Information and Communications]] for his work in the development of the Unix operating system.<ref>Evangelista, Benny, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/01/24/BUTI1HDJSA.DTL#ixzz1C5LtXdf3 "Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie win Japan Prize"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', January 25, 2011</ref>
