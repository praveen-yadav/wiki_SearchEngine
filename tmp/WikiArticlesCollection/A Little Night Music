'''''A Little Night Music''''' is a [[Musical theatre|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and book by [[Hugh Wheeler]]. Inspired by the [[Ingmar Bergman]] film ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'', it involves the romantic lives of several couples. Its title is a literal English translation of the German name for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Eine kleine Nachtmusik|Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major]], ''Eine kleine Nachtmusik''. The musical includes the popular song "[[Send in the Clowns]]".

Since its original 1973 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, the musical has enjoyed professional productions in the [[West End theatre|West End]], by opera companies, in a 2009 Broadway revival, and elsewhere, and it is a popular choice for regional groups.  It was [[A Little Night Music (1977 film)|adapted for film in 1977]], with [[Harold Prince]] directing and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Lesley-Anne Down]] and [[Diana Rigg]] starring.

==Synopsis==

===Act One===
The setting is Sweden, around the year 1900. One by one, the Quintet – five singers who comment like a  [[Greek chorus]] throughout the show – enter, tuning up. Gradually, their vocalizing becomes an overture blending fragments of "Remember," "Soon," and "The Glamorous Life," leading into the first "Night Waltz". The other characters enter [[waltz]]ing, each uncomfortable with their particular partner. After they drift back off, the aging and severe Madame Armfeldt and her solemn granddaughter, Fredrika, enter. Madame Armfeldt tells the child that the summer night "smiles" three times: first on the young, second on fools, and third on the old. Fredrika vows to watch the smiles occur. Middle aged Fredrik Egerman is a successful lawyer. He has recently married an 18-year-old [[trophy wife]], Anne, a vain girl who is in love with Fredrik, but too immature to grasp the concept of marriage. The two have been married for eleven months, but Anne still protects her [[virginity]]. Fredrik laments his inability to [[sexual intercourse|make love]] to his wife ("Now"). Meanwhile, his son Henrik, a year older than his stepmother, is feeling extremely frustrated. He is a [[seminary]] student and everyone is always teasing him, never taking him seriously or letting him talk ("Later"). Anne is intrigued by him, but fails to understand his real meaning. Anne promises her husband that she will consent to have sex shortly ("Soon"). Anne's [[maidservant]] Petra, an experienced and forthright girl, slightly older than the teen herself, offers her worldly but crass advice.

Desiree Armfeldt is a prominent and glamorous actress who is now reduced to touring in small towns. Madame Armfeldt, Desiree's mother, has taken over the care of Desiree's daughter Fredrika. Fredrika misses her mother, but Desiree continually puts off going to see her, preferring, somewhat ironically, "The Glamorous Life". She is performing near Fredrik's home, and he brings Anne to see the play. While there, Desiree notices Fredrik; the two were lovers years before. Anne, suspicious and annoyed because of Desiree's amorous glances, demands that Fredrik bring her home immediately. Meanwhile, Petra has been trying to seduce Henrik.

That night, as Fredrik remembers his past with Desiree, he sneaks out to see her; the two share a happy but strained reunion, as they "Remember". They reflect on their new lives, and Fredrik tries to explain how much he loves Anne ("You Must Meet My Wife"). Desiree responds sarcastically, boasting of her own adultery, as she has been seeing the married [[dragoon]], Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm. Upon learning that Fredrik has gone for eleven months without sex, she agrees to accommodate him as a favor for an old friend.

Madame Armfeldt offers advice to young Fredrika. The elderly woman reflects poignantly on her own checkered past, and wonders what happened to her refined "Liaisons". Back in Desiree's apartment, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm proclaims his unannounced arrival in his typical booming voice. Fredrik and Desiree fool the gullible Count into believing that their disheveled appearance was entirely innocent, but he is still suspicious. He instantly dislikes Fredrik and returns to his wife, Countess Charlotte. Charlotte is quite aware of her husband's infidelity, but Carl-Magnus is too absorbed in his suspicions of Desiree to talk to her ("In Praise of Women"). When she persuades him to blurt out the whole story, a twist is revealed&mdash;Charlotte's little sister is a school friend of Anne's.

Charlotte visits Anne, who is talking with Petra. Charlotte describes Fredrik's meeting with Desiree; Anne reacts with shock and horror. The older woman explains to Anne that such is the lot of a wife, and that marriage brings pain ("Every Day A Little Death"). Meanwhile, Desiree asks Madame Armfeldt to host a party for Fredrik, Anne, and Henrik. Though reluctant, Madame Armfeldt agrees. She sends out a personal invitation; its receipt sends the women into a frenzy, imagining "A Weekend in the Country". Anne does not want to accept the invitation, but Charlotte convinces her to do so to heighten the contrast between the older woman and the young teenager. Meanwhile, the Count has plans of his own — as a birthday present to his wife, the pair will attend the party uninvited. Carl-Magnus plans to challenge Fredrik to a [[duel]], while Charlotte hopes to seduce the lawyer to make her husband jealous and end his philandering. The day of the party dawns.

===Act Two===
Armfeldt's country estate is bathed in the golden glow of perpetual summer sunset at this high latitude ("Night Waltz One and Two"). Everyone arrives, each carrying their own amorous purposes and desires&mdash;even Petra, who catches the eye of Armfeldt's fetching [[manservant]], Frid. The women begin to act against each other. Fredrik is astonished to learn the name of Desiree's daughter. Henrik meets Fredrika, and confesses his deep love for Anne to her. Meanwhile, in the garden, Fredrik and Carl-Magnus reflect on how difficult it is to be annoyed with Desiree, agreeing "It Would Have Been Wonderful" had she not been quite so wonderful. Dinner is served, and the characters' "Perpetual Anticipation" enlivens that meal.

At dinner, Charlotte attempts to flirt with Fredrik, while Anne and Desiree trade insults. Soon, everyone is shouting and scolding everyone else, except for Henrik, who finally stands up for himself. He shrieks at them for being completely [[amorality|amoral]], and flees the scene. Stunned, everyone reflects on the situation and wanders away. Fredrika tells Anne of Henrik's secret love, and the two dash off searching for him. Meanwhile, Desiree meets Fredrik and asks if he still wants to be "rescued" from his life. Fredrik answers honestly that he loves Desiree, but only as a dream. Hurt and bitter, Desiree can only reflect on the nature of her life ("Send in the Clowns"). Anne finds Henrik, who is attempting to commit suicide. The clumsy boy cannot complete the task, and Anne tells him that she has feelings for him, too. The pair begins to kiss, which leads to Anne's first sexual encounter. Meanwhile, not far away, Frid sleeps in Petra's lap. The maid thinks of the joy and freedom that she longs for before becoming trapped in marriage ("The Miller's Son"). Henrik and Anne, happy together, run away to start their new life. Charlotte confesses her plan to Fredrik, and the two commiserate on a bench. Carl-Magnus, preparing to romance Desiree, sees this and challenges Fredrik to [[Russian Roulette]], at which a nervous Fredrik misfires and simply grazes his own ear. Victorious, Carl-Magnus begins to romance Charlotte, granting her wish at last.

After the Count and Countess leave, Fredrika and Madame Armfeldt discuss the chaos of the recent turns-of-events. The elderly woman then asks Fredrika a surprising question: "What is it all for?" Fredrika thinks about this, and decides that it "must be worth it". Madame Armfeldt is surprised, ruefully noting that she rejected love for material wealth at Fredrika's age. She praises her granddaughter and remembers true love's fleeting nature.

Fredrik finally confesses his love for Desiree, acknowledges that Fredrika is his daughter, and the two promise to start a new life together ("Finale"). Armfeldt sits alone with Fredrika. Fredrika tells her grandmother that she has watched carefully, but still has not seen the night smile. Armfeldt laughs and points out that the night has indeed smiled twice: Henrik and Anne, the young, and Desiree and Fredrik, the fools. As the two wait for the "third smile", on the old, Armfeldt closes her eyes, and dies peacefully.

==Film adaptation==
{{Main|A Little Night Music (1977 film)}}
In 1977, a film version of ''[[A Little Night Music (1977 film)|A Little Night Music]]'' was released, starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Lesley-Anne Down]] and [[Diana Rigg]], with [[Len Cariou]], [[Hermione Gingold]] and [[Laurence Guittard]] reprising their Broadway roles.  The setting for the film was moved from Sweden to Austria. [[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote lyrics for the "Night Waltz" theme ("Love Takes Time") and wrote an entirely new version of "The Glamorous Life", which has been incorporated into several subsequent productions of the stage musical. However, other songs, including "In Praise of Women", "The Miller's Son" and "Liaisons", were cut and remain heard only as background orchestrations. The film marked Broadway director [[Hal Prince]]'s second time as a motion picture director. Critical reaction to the film was mostly negative, with much being made of Taylor's wildly fluctuating weight from scene to scene.<ref>Canby, Vincent. [http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CEEDA1F3EE632A2575BC0A9659C946990D6CF "Review: A Little Night Music (1977)"], ''The New York Times'', March 8, 1978</ref> Some critics talked more positively of the film, with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' calling it "an elegant looking, period romantic charade".<ref>[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117792646.html?categoryid=31&cs=1] variety.com</ref> There was praise for Diana Rigg's performance, and orchestrator [[Jonathan Tunick]] received an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for his work on the score.  A soundtrack recording was released on LP, and a DVD release was issued in June 2007.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0076319|title=A Little Night Music}}</ref>

==Music analysis==
The score for ''A Little Night Music'' has elements not often found in musical theater, presenting challenges for performers, with complex meters, pitch changes, polyphony, and high notes for both males and females. The difficulty is heightened when songs merge, as in "Now"/"Later"/"Soon", because all three have to be performed in the same key, limiting the ability to pick a comfortable key for each singer. Critic [[Rex Reed]] noted that "The score of 'Night Music' ...contains patter songs, contrapuntal duets and trios, a quartet, and even a dramatic double quintet to puzzle through. All this has been gorgeously orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick; there is no rhythm section, only strings and woodwinds to carry the melodies and harmonies aloft."<ref>Deutsch, Didier C.[http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/a-little-night-music "'A Little Night Music' Liner Notes, Song List and Synopsis"] masterworksbroadway.com, retrieved June 9, 2010</ref>

Sondheim's engagement with threes extends to his lyrics. He organizes trios with the singers separated, while his duets are sung together, about a third person.<ref name=tunick/>

Another of the show's signature elements is that many songs end on a single brief note played by one or more instruments.

===Counterpoint and polyphony===
At several points, Sondheim has multiple performers each sing a different song simultaneously. This use of [[counterpoint]] maintains coherence even as it extends the notion of a [[round (music)|round]], familiar in songs such as the traditional "[[Frère Jacques]]", into something more complex. Sondheim said: "As for the three songs... going together well, I might as well confess. In those days I was just getting into contrapuntal and choral writing...and I wanted to develop my technique by writing a trio. What I didn't want to do is the [[quodlibet]] method...wouldn't it be nice to have three songs you don't think are going to go together, and they do go together... The trick was the little [[vamp (music)|vamp]] on "Soon" which has five-and six-note chords."<ref name=swayne>Swayne, Steve. ''How Sondheim Found His Sound'', University of Michigan Press, 2007, ISBN 0-472-03229-1, p. 251</ref> Steve Swayne comments that the "contrapuntal episodes in the extended ensembles... stand as testament to his interest in Counterpoint."<ref name=swayne/>

==="Send In The Clowns"===
The show's best-known and Sondheim's biggest hit song was almost an afterthought, written several days before the start of out of town tryouts.<ref>Citron, p. 207</ref>  Sondheim initially conceived Desiree as a role for a more-or-less non-singing actress.  When he discovered that the original Desiree, [[Glynis Johns]], was able to sing (she had a "small, silvery voice"<ref name=secrest>Secrest, Meryle. "Stephen Sondheim: A Life" (1998). Dell Publishing. ISBN 0-385-33412-5, pp. 251-252</ref>) but could not "sustain a phrase", he devised the song "[[Send in the Clowns]]" for her in a way that would work around her vocal weakness, e.g., by ending lines with consonants that made for a short cut-off.<ref name=secrest/> "It is written in short phrases in order to be acted rather than sung...tailor-made for Glynis Johns, who lacks the vocal power to sustain long phrases."<ref>Sondheim, S., Shevelove, B., Gelbart, L., Wheeler, H., and Lapine, J.  "Four by Sondheim, Wheeler, Lapine, Shevelove and Gelbart" (2000). Hal Leonard Corporation. ISBN 1-55783-407-5, p. 170</ref>

In analyzing the text of the song, [[Max Cryer]] wrote that it "is not intended to be sung by the young in love, but by a mature performer who has seen it all before. The song remains an anthem to regret for unwise decisions in the past and recognition that there's no need to send in the clowns-they're already here."<ref>Cryer, Max. ''Love Me Tender: The Stories Behind the World's Best-loved Frances Lincoln Ltd, 2008, ISBN 0-7112-2911-2, p. 171</ref>

===Influences===
There is a [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] reference in the title&mdash;''A Little Night Music'' is an occasionally used translation of ''[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]'', the nickname of Mozart's [[Serenade No. 13 (Mozart)|Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major]], [[Köchel catalogue|K.]] 525. The elegant, [[harmony|harmonically]]-advanced music in this musical pays indirect homage to the compositions of [[Maurice Ravel]], especially his ''[[Valses nobles et sentimentales (Ravel)|Valses nobles et sentimentales]]''<ref>Citron, Stephen. pp. 200, 203</ref> (whose opening chord is "borrowed" for the opening chord of the song "Liaisons"); part of this effect stems from the style of orchestration that [[Jonathan Tunick]] used.

==Cast recordings==

In addition to the original Broadway and London cast recordings, and the motion picture soundtrack (no longer available), there are recordings of the 1990 studio cast, the 1995 [[Royal National Theatre]] revival (starring [[Judi Dench]]), and the 2001 Barcelona cast recording sung in [[Catalan language|Catalan]].  In 1997 an all-jazz version of the score was recorded by [[Terry Trotter]].<ref>[http://www.sondheimguide.com/nightrecs.html "Recordings, 'A Little Night Music'"] sondheimguide.com, retrieved June 8, 2010</ref>

==Critical response==
In his review of the original 1973 Broadway production, [[Clive Barnes]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' called the musical "heady, civilized, sophisticated and enchanting." He noted that "the real triumph belongs to Stephen Sondheim...the music is a celebration of 3/4 time, an orgy of plaintively memorable waltzes, all talking of past loves and lost worlds...There is a peasant touch here." He commented that the lyrics are "breathtaking".<ref>Barnes, Clive, "The Theater:'A Little Night Music", ''The New York Times'', February 26, 1973, p. 26</ref>

In its review of the 1989 London revival, the reviewer for ''The Guardian'' wrote that the "production also strikes me as infinitely superior to Harold Prince's 1975 version at the Adelphi. Mr Judge's great innovation is to transform the Liebeslieder Singers from the evening-dressed, after-dinner line-up into 18th century ghosts weaving in and out of the action...But Mr Judge's other great realisation is that, in Sondheim, the lyrics are not an adornment to a song but their very essence: understand them and the show will flow. Thus Dorothy Tutin as Desiree, the touring thesp eventually reunited with her quondam lover, is not the melting romantic of previous productions but a working mother with the sharpness of a hat-pin."<ref>Billington, Michael. "Arts: Night of the short memories - 'A Little Night Music'", ''The Guardian'' (London)., October 23, 1989 (no page number)</ref>

The ''Independent'' review of the 1995 National Theatre revival praised the production, writing "For three hours of gloriously barbed bliss and bewitchment, Sean Mathias's production establishes the show as a minor miracle of astringent worldly wisdom and one that is haunted by less earthy intimations." The review went on to state that "The heart of the production, in both senses, is Judi Dench's superb Desiree Armfeldt...Her husky-voiced rendering of "Send in the Clowns" is the most moving I've ever heard."<ref>Taylor, Paul and Seckerson, Edward.[http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/double-take-reviews-a-little-night-music-1603205.html "Double Take: Reviews: 'A Little Night Music'"]''Independent', September 1995</ref>

In reviewing the 2008 Menier Chocolate Factory production, ''The Telegraph'' reviewer wrote that "Sondheim's lyrics are often superbly witty, his music here, mostly in haunting waltz-time, far more accessible than is sometimes the case. The score positively throbs with love, regret and desire." But of the specific production, the reviewer went on to note: "But Nunn's production, on one of those hermetic sets largely consisting of doors and tarnished mirrors that have become such a cliché in recent years, never penetrates the work's subtly erotic heart. And as is often the case with this director's work, the pace is so slow and the mood so reverent, that initial enchantment gives way to bored fidgeting."<ref name=telegraph/>

In his ''[[New York Times]]'' review of the 2009 Broadway production, [[Ben Brantley]] noted that "the expression that hovers over Trevor Nunn's revival...feels dangerously close to a smirk...It is a smirk shrouded in shadows. An elegiac darkness infuses this production."  The production is "sparing on furniture and heavy on shadows", with "a scaled-down orchestra at lugubriously slowed-down tempos..." He goes on to write that "this somber, less-is-more approach could be effective were the ensemble plugged into the same rueful sensibility. But there is only one moment in this production when all its elements cohere perfectly. That moment, halfway through the first act, belongs to Ms. Lansbury, who has hitherto been perfectly entertaining, playing Madame Armfeldt with the overripe aristocratic condescension of a Lady Bracknell. Then comes her one solo, "Liaisons", in which her character thinks back on the art of love as a profession in a gilded age, when sex 'was but a pleasurable means to a measurable end.' Her face, with its glamour-gorgon makeup, softens, as Madame Armfeldt seems to melt into memory itself, and the wan stage light briefly appears to borrow radiance from her. It's a lovely example of the past reaching out to the present..."<ref>Brantley, Ben.[http://theater.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/theater/reviews/14little.htm "A Weekend in the Country With Eros and Thanatos"] ''The New York Times'', December 14, 2009</ref>

Steven Suskin, reviewing the new Broadway cast for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', wrote "What a difference a diva makes. Bernadette Peters steps into the six-month-old revival of 'A Little Night Music' with a transfixing performance, playing it as if she realizes her character's onstage billing -- "the one and only Desiree Armfeldt"—is cliched hyperbole. By figuratively rolling her eyes at the hype, Peters gives us a rich, warm and comedically human Desiree, which reaches full impact when she pierces the facade with a nakedly honest, tears-on-cheek 'Send in the Clowns.'"<ref>Suskin, Steven. "'A Little Night Music' Review", ''Variety'', August 2, 2010</ref>
