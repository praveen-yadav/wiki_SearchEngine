The '''clitoris''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Clitoris pronunciation 1.ogg|ˈ|k|l|ɪ|t|ər|ɨ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|audio=Clitoris pronunciation 2.ogg|k|l|ɨ|ˈ|t|ɔər|ɨ|s}}) is a female [[sex organ]] present in [[mammal]]s, [[ostrich]]es and a limited number of other animals. In humans, the visible button-like portion is near the front junction of the [[labia minora]] (inner lips), above the opening of the [[urethra]]. Unlike the [[penis]], the male [[Homology (biology)|homologue]] (male equivalent) to the clitoris, it usually does not contain the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] portion (or opening) of the urethra and is therefore not used for urination. While few animals urinate through the clitoris, the [[spotted hyena]], which has a particularly well-developed clitoris, urinates, mates and gives birth via the organ. Some other [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] animals and mammals, such as [[lemur]]s and [[spider monkey]]s, also have a well-developed clitoris.<ref name="Goodman_Roughgarden_Wingfield" />

The clitoris is the human female's most sensitive [[erogenous zone]] and the primary source of female sexual pleasure.<ref name="Chalker_Marmor_Greenberg_Weiten" /><ref name="O'Connell" /><ref name="Carroll 2012 pp110-111, 252"/> In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the [[embryo]] called the [[genital tubercle]]. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a penis or a clitoris, depending on the presence or absence of the protein [[testis determining factor|tdf]], which is codified by a single gene on the [[Y chromosome]]. The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary. The [[clitoral glans|glans]] (head) of the human clitoris is roughly the size and shape of a pea, and is estimated to have more [[Sensory nerve|sensory]] [[Nerve|nerve endings]] than any other part of the human body.<ref name="Carroll 2012 pp110-111, 252" /><ref name="Harvey" />

Extensive [[Sociology|sociological]], [[sexology|sexological]] and medical debate have focused on the clitoris, primarily concerning anatomical accuracy, [[orgasm]]ic factors and their physiological explanation for the [[G-Spot]], and whether the clitoris is [[vestigiality|vestigial]], an [[adaptation]], or serves a reproductive function.<ref name="O'Connell" /><ref name="Koedt" /><ref name="Kilchevsky" /> Social perceptions of the clitoris range from the significance of its role in female sexual pleasure, assumptions about its true size and depth, and varying beliefs regarding [[Genital modification and mutilation|genital modification]] such as [[clitoris enlargement]], [[clitoris piercing]] and [[clitoridectomy]]; genital modification may be for [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], medical or cultural reasons.<ref name="Chalker_Momoh" /><ref name="Ogletree" /><ref name="Stirn" /> 

Cultural perceptions also impact on knowledge of the clitoris. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison to that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could help alleviate [[social stigma]]s associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and [[vulva]] in general are visually unappealing, that female [[masturbation]] is [[taboo]], or that men should be expected to master and control women's orgasms.<ref name="Ogletree" /><ref name="Wade" /><ref name="Waskul"/>

== Pronunciation and etymology ==
<!-- NOTE: Though the "Historical and modern perceptions" section partially deals with terms for the clitoris, it seems the information there and therefore these two sections are better kept separate, considering that the terms in the latter section are thoroughly intertwined with historical beliefs about the clitoris's structure. Below, this section directs readers to that sort of material. -->

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives the pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|aɪ|t|ɒr|ɨ|s}} for [[British English]], adding that the word likely has its origin in the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|κλειτορίς}}, ''kleitoris'', perhaps derived from the verb {{lang|grc|κλείειν}}, ''kleiein'', "to shut". It also states that the shortened form "clit", the first occurrence of which was noted in the United States, has been used in print since 1958: until then, the common abbreviation was "clitty".<ref>{{OED|clitoris}}</ref> ''Clitoris'' is also Greek for the word ''key'', "indicating that the ancient anatomists considered it the key" to female sexuality.<ref name="Sloane 2002 pp32-33"/><ref name="Basavanthappa"/> In addition to ''key,'' the ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'' suggests other Greek candidates for the word's etymology include a noun meaning "latch" or "hook"; a verb meaning "to touch or titillate lasciviously", "to tickle" (one German synonym for the clitoris is ''der Kitzler'', "the tickler"), although this verb is more likely derived from "clitoris"; and a word meaning "side of a hill", from the same root as "climax".<ref name="OEtymD">{{OEtymD|clitoris}}</ref>

The plural forms are ''clitorises'' in English and ''clitorides'' in Latin. The Latin [[genitive]] is ''clitoridis'', as in "[[clitoral glans|glans clitoridis]]". In medical and sexological literature, the clitoris is sometimes referred to as "the female penis" or [[pseudo-penis]],<ref name="Puppo"/> and the term ''clitoris'' is commonly used to refer to the glans alone;<ref name="O'Connell" /> partially because of this, there have been various terms for the organ that have historically confused its anatomy ([[#Historical and modern perceptions|see below]]).

== Anatomy and structure ==

=== Embryonic development ===
[[File:Stages in the development of the external sexual organs in the female (from Gray1119).png|thumb|left|225px|[[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|Stages in the development of the clitoris]]]]
In mammals, [[sexual differentiation]] is determined by the [[sperm]] that carries either an [[X chromosome|X]] or a [[Y chromosome|Y]] (male) chromosome.<ref name="Llord" /> The Y chromosome contains a [[SRY|sex-determining gene]] (SRY) that encodes a [[transcription factor]] for the protein tdf ([[testis determining factor]]) and triggers the creation of [[testosterone]] and [[Anti-Müllerian hormone]] for the [[embryo]]'s development into a male.<ref name="Merz_Schünke" /><ref name="Hake"/> This differentiation begins about eight or nine weeks after conception.<ref name="Merz_Schünke" /> Some sources state that it continues until the 12th week,<ref name="Merz"/> while others state that it is clearly evident by the 13th week and that the sex organs are fully developed by the 16th week.<ref name="Schünke" />

The clitoris develops from a [[Primordial phallus|phallic]] outgrowth in the embryo called the [[genital tubercle]]. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a clitoris or penis during [[development of the urinary and reproductive organs]] depending on exposure to [[androgen]]s (male hormones). The clitoris forms from the same tissues that become the glans and upper shaft of the penis, and this shared embryonic origin makes these two organs [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] (different versions of the same structure).<ref name="Merz_Schünke" /><ref name="Sloane 2002 p148"/> 

If exposed to testosterone, the genital tubercle elongates to form the penis. By fusion of the urogenital folds&nbsp;– elongated spindle-shaped structures that contribute to the formation of the urethral groove on the [[Ventral|belly aspect]] of the genital tubercle&nbsp;– the [[Definitive urogenital sinus|urogenital sinus]] closes completely and forms the [[spongy urethra]], and the [[labioscrotal swelling]]s unite to form the [[scrotum]].<ref name="Merz_Schünke" /><ref name="Sloane 2002 p148"/> In the absence of testosterone, the genital tubercle allows for formation of the clitoris; the initially rapid growth of the phallus gradually slows and the clitoris is formed. The urogenital sinus persists as [[Vulval vestibule|the vestibule]] of the [[vagina]], the two urogenital folds form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora, completing the female genitalia.<ref name="Merz_Schünke" /><ref name="Sloane 2002 p148"/> A rare condition that can develop from higher than average androgen exposure is [[clitoromegaly]] ([[#Modification and mutilation|see below]]).<ref name="Hořkejškí" /><ref name="Copcu" />
===General structure and histological evaluation===
The clitoris is a complex structure, containing external and internal components. It consists of the [[clitoral glans|glans]], the clitoral body or shaft (with the shaft being external and internal), the [[clitoral hood]], two [[Erectile tissue|erectile]] bodies known as the [[Corpus cavernosum of clitoris|corpora cavernosa]], two [[Crus of clitoris|clitoral crura]] and the [[Bulb of vestibule|vestibular or clitoral bulbs]].<ref name="Sloane_O'Connell_Greenberg_Crooks_Ginger" /> Research indicates that clitoral tissue extends into the vagina's anterior wall.<ref name="O'Connell" /><ref name="Kilchevsky"/><ref name="O'Connell 2006" /> Researcher Atilla Şenaylı said that the [[Histology|histological]] evaluation of the clitoris, "especially of the corpora cavernosa, is incomplete because for many years the clitoris was considered a rudimentary and nonfunctional organ." He added that Baskin and colleagues examined the clitoris's [[Virilization|masculinization]] after dissection and, using imaging software after [[Masson's trichrome stain|Masson chrome staining]], put the serial dissected specimens together; this revealed that the nerves of the clitoris surround the whole clitoral body (corpus).<ref name="Şenaylı" />

The clitoris, vestibular bulbs, [[labia minora]], and urethra consist of two histologically distinct types of vascular tissue, the first of which is [[trabecula]]ted, erectile tissue present in the clitoris and the bulbs, which have large, dilated vascular spaces filled with blood and are spongy in appearance. By contrast, although the clitoral glans becomes engorged with blood upon [[sexual arousal]], and erectile tissue is commonly defined as tissue that may become engorged with blood, some sources state that the clitoral glans and labia minora are composed of non-erectile tissue, in which the blood vessels are dispersed within a fibrous matrix with only a minimal amount of smooth muscle,<ref name="Ginger" /> or that "[t]he glans is a midline, densely neural, non-erectile structure".<ref name="O'Connell" />

With regard to the urethral lumen (the inner open space or cavity of the urethra), Yang et al. state that it is surrounded by spongy tissue and that the tissue "is grossly distinct from the vascular tissue of the clitoris and bulbs, and on macroscopic observation, is paler than the dark tissue of the bulbs and clitoris. The bulbs arch over the distal urethra, outlining what might be appropriately called the 'bulbar urethra' in women".<ref name="Yang" />

===Glans and body===

The glans of the clitoris is usually the size and shape of a pea, although it is sometimes much larger or smaller. It, or the clitoris as a whole, is estimated to have around 8,000 [[Sensory nerve|sensory]] [[Nerve|nerve ending]]s&nbsp;– more than any other part of the human body.<ref name="Carroll 2012 pp110-111, 252"/><ref name="Harvey" /><ref name="Cornforth"/> A 1992 article in ''[[Obstetrics & Gynecology (journal)|Obstetrics & Gynecology]]'' gives clitoral glans widths of {{convert|2.5|to|4.5|mm|in|abbr=on}}, with the average size smaller than a pencil-top eraser, and the total clitoral length including glans and body as {{convert|16.0|+/-|4.3|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Verkauf" /> The authors concluded that there is no identified correlation between the size of a clitoris and a woman's age, height, weight, use of [[hormonal contraception]], or being [[menopause|post-menopausal]], although women who had given birth had significantly larger measurements.<ref name="Verkauf" />  [[File:EdSim Clitoris anatomy.jpg|thumb|The [[clitoral glans]], [[Clitoral body|body/shaft]], [[Crus of clitoris|crura]], [[Bulb of vestibule|vestibular bulbs]] and [[Corpus cavernosum of clitoris|corpus cavernosa]]]]

Yang et al. challenge the conclusion that the glans is not formed of erectile tissue, stating that their dissections clearly show glanular vascular spaces, although not as prominent as those in the corpora. "The erectile tissue of the glans is slightly different from that of the body and crura. The vascular spaces are separated more by smooth muscle than in the body and crura," they concluded. They stated that there is a thick layer of tissue that supports the tissue between the [[epithelium]] "and the vascular spaces. In the epithelium and supporting tissue, there is a dense distribution of nerves and sensory receptors".<ref name="Yang" />

The clitoral body (internal shaft) forms a [[Furcula|wishbone]]-shaped structure containing the corpora cavernosa&nbsp;– a pair of sponge-like regions of erectile tissue which contain most of the blood in the clitoris during [[clitoral erection]]. The two corpora forming the clitoral body are surrounded by thick fibro-elastic tunica albuginea, literally meaning "white covering," [[connective tissue]]. These corpora are separated incompletely from each other in the midline by a fibrous pectiniform septum&nbsp;– a comblike band of connective tissue extending between the corpora cavernosa. Each crura ("leg") is attached to the corresponding [[Ischium|ischial ramus]]&nbsp;– extensions of the copora beneath the descending pubic rami.<ref name="Yang" /><ref name="Şenaylı" /><ref name="Ginger" />

The clitoral body extends up to several centimeters before reversing direction and branching, resulting in an inverted "V" shape that extends as a pair of crura.<ref name="Yang"/><ref name="Sloane_Crooks_Ginger" /> The crura are the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] portions of the arms of the wishbone. Ending at the glans of the clitoris, the tip of the body bends anteriorly away from the pubis.<ref name="Yang" /> Concealed behind the labia minora, the crura terminate with attachment to the pubic arch (according to some),<ref name="medicalook Vulva" /> or follow interior to the labia minora to meet at the [[frenulum labiorum pudendi|fourchette]] (according to others).<ref name="Chalker 2002 p201" /> "The clitoral body and the crura can be {{convert|10|cm|in}} or more in length with the body measuring {{convert|5|-|7|cm|in}} in length."<ref name="Ginger" /> Associated are the [[urethral sponge]], [[perineal sponge]], a network of nerves and blood vessels, suspensory ligaments, muscles and pelvic diaphragm.<ref name="Francoeur" />

===Hood and bulbs===
The clitoral hood projects at [[Anterior commissure of labia majora|the front of the labia commissure]], where the edges of the [[labia majora]] (outer lips) meet at the base of the pubic mound; it forms as part of the external folds of the labia minora (inner lips) and covers the glans and external shaft.<ref name="Sloane_Kahn_Crooks"/> There is considerable variation in how much of the glans protrudes from the hood and how much is covered by it, ranging from completely covered to fully exposed,<ref name="Verkauf" /> and tissue of the labia minora also encircles the base of the glans.<ref name="O'Connell 2006" />

The vestibular bulbs are more closely related to the clitoris than the vestibule because of the similarity of the trabecular and erectile tissue within the clitoris and bulbs, and the absence of trabecular tissue in other genital organs, with the erectile tissue's trabecular nature allowing engorgement and expansion during sexual arousal.<ref name="Yang" /><ref name="Ginger" /> The vestibular bulbs lie close to the crura on either side of the vaginal opening; internally, they are beneath the labia majora. When engorged with blood, they cuff the vaginal opening and cause the vulva to expand outward.<ref name="Yang" /><ref name="Ginger" /> Though some texts state that they surround the vaginal opening, this does not appear to be the case and tunica albuginea does not envelope the erectile tissue of the bulbs.<ref name="Yang" /><ref name="Ginger" />

=== Clitoral and penile similarities and differences ===
The clitoris and penis are generally the same anatomical structure, although the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] portion (or opening) of the urethra is absent in the clitoris of humans and most other animals. The first researcher to suggest the existence of clitorises in males was anatomist and sexologist Josephine Lowndes Sevely in 1987, theorizing that the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|male corpora cavernosa]] (a pair of sponge-like regions of erectile tissue which contain most of the blood in the penis during penile [[erection]]) are the true counterpart of the clitoris.<ref name="Frayser_Chalker" /> By contrast, science shows that the clitoris displays a hood that is the equivalent of the penis's [[foreskin]], which covers the glans, and a shaft that is attached to the glans; the male corpora cavernosa are homologous to the corpus cavernosum clitoridis (the female cavernosa); the [[Corpus spongiosum penis|corpus spongiosum]] is homologous to the vestibular bulbs beneath the labia minora, and the [[scrotum]] is homologous to the labia minora and labia majora.<ref name="Chapple_Schuenke_Saladin" />

Upon anatomical study, the penis can be described as a clitoris that has been mostly pulled out of the body and grafted on top of a significantly smaller piece of spongiosum containing the urethra.<ref name="Chapple_Schuenke_Saladin" /> Contrasting the human clitoris's estimated 8,000 nerve endings (for its glans or clitoral body as a whole), estimates for the number of nerve endings in the [[human penis]] (for its [[glans penis|glans]] or body as a whole) are more varied. Some sources estimate 4,000 for the human penis,<ref name="Carroll 2012 pp110-111, 252"/><ref name="Harvey" /><ref name="Cornforth" /> while other sources state that the glans or the entire penile structure have the same amount of nerve endings as the clitoral glans,<ref name="Crooks Baur 2010 p54" /><ref name="Can't feel" /> or discuss whether the [[Circumcision|uncircumcised]] penis has thousands more than the circumcised penis or is generally more sensitive.<ref name="Boyle 2002"/><ref name="AAFP"/><ref name="Waskett"/><ref name="CPSBC" />

At the tip of the clitoral body, the glans of the clitoris rests as a fibrovascular cap. Some scholars assert that in contrast to the glans of the penis, the glans of the clitoris lacks smooth muscle within its fibrovascular cap and is thus differentiated from the erectile tissues of the clitoris and bulbs.<ref name="Ginger" /> Additionally, bulb size varies and may be dependent on age and [[estrogen]]ization.<ref name="Ginger" /> Though the bulbs are considered the equivalent of the male spongiosum, they do not completely encircle the urethra.<ref name="Ginger" />

Internally, the penis is composed of two kinds of tissue. The thin corpus spongiosum runs along the underside of the shaft, enveloping the urethra, and expands at the end to form the glans. It partially contributes to erection, which are primarily caused by the two corpora cavernosa that comprise the bulk of the shaft; like the female cavernosa, the male cavernosa soak up blood and become erect when sexually excited.<ref name="Libertino_Morganstern_Saladin" /> The male corpora cavernosa taper off internally on reaching the spongiosum head.<ref name="Libertino_Morganstern_Saladin" /> With regard to the Y-shape of the cavernosa&nbsp;– crown, body, and legs&nbsp;– the body accounts for much more of the structure in men, and the legs are stubbier; typically, the cavernosa are longer and thicker in males than in females.<ref name="Yang" /><ref name="Saladin" />

== Sexual stimulation, findings and debates ==

=== General stimulation, practices, and arousal===
The abundance of [[blood vessel]]s and nerve endings in the clitoris, the majority of the nerve endings existing specifically for sexual enjoyment, make it the human female's most sensitive [[erogenous zone]] and the primary source of female sexual pleasure.<ref name="Chalker_Marmor_Greenberg_Weiten" /><ref name="O'Connell" /><ref name="Carroll 2012 pp110-111, 252"/> [[Sexual stimulation]] of it can produce female [[sexual arousal]] and [[orgasm]], and may be achieved by [[masturbation]] or with a [[sexual partner]].<ref name="Carroll 2012 pp110-111, 252"/><ref name="Clitoris" /><ref name="Francoeur_Rosenthal" /> The most effective sexual stimulation of the organ is usually through [[Fingering (sexual act)|manual]] or [[Oral sex|oral]] stimulation ([[cunnilingus]]), often referred to as direct clitoral stimulation;<!-- NOTE: Reliable sources often give clarification as to what direct clitoral stimulation is; also, this line is sourced with the following combined line because placing the references beside both lines is considered unnecessary over-referencing. See Wikipedia:Citation overkill, which is also why a lot of the sources in this article are bundled/merged. --> in cases involving [[sexual penetration]], these activities may also be referred to as additional or assisted clitoral stimulation.<ref name="Clitoris" /><ref name="Rosenthal_Weiten_Greenberg_Lloyd_Flaherty_Kaplan" /> Direct clitoral stimulation involves physical stimulation to the external anatomy of the clitoris&nbsp;– glans, hood, external shaft.<ref name="O'Connell"/><ref name="Carroll 2012 pp110-111, 252"/><ref name="BWH_Krychman_Greenberg" /> Stimulation of the labia minora (inner lips), due to its external connection with the glans and hood, may have the same effect as direct clitoral stimulation.<ref name="Kahn" /> Though these areas may also receive indirect physical stimulation during sexual activity, such as when in friction with the labia majora (outer lips),<ref name="Carroll 2012 pp110-111, 252"/><ref name="Casper_Crooks" /> indirect clitoral stimulation is more commonly attributed to [[Sexual intercourse|penile-vaginal penetration]].<ref name="Clitoris" /><ref name="Kaplan_Lloyd" /> [[Anal sex|Penile-anal]] penetration may also indirectly stimulate the clitoris, either by the shared [[sensory nerve]]s (especially the [[pudendal nerve]], which gives off the [[inferior anal nerves]] and divides into two terminal branches: the [[perineal nerve]] and the [[Dorsal nerve of clitoris|dorsal nerve of the clitoris]]) or by the crura ("legs") extending beneath and along the labia minora back to the anus.<ref name="Answer"/><ref name="Doin' the butt"/>

Due to the glans's high sensitivity, direct stimulation to it is not always pleasurable; instead, direct stimulation to the hood or the areas near the glans are often more pleasurable, with the majority of females preferring to use the hood to stimulate the glans, or to have the glans rolled between the lips of the labia, for indirect touch.<ref name="Carroll_Crooks_Hooper_Reinisch_Roberts"/> The majority of women also "enjoy a light caressing of the shaft of the clitoris" combined with the occasional circling of the clitoral glans, with or without manual penetration of the vagina, while others enjoy having the entire area of the vulva caressed.<ref name="Carroll 2012 pp110-111, 252"/> As opposed to use of dry fingers, stimulation from fingers that have been well-lubricated, either by [[vaginal lubrication]] or a [[personal lubricant]], is usually more pleasurable for the external anatomy of the clitoris.<ref name="Carroll 2009 p264"/><ref name="Rosenthal 2012 p271" />

As the clitoris's external location does not allow for direct stimulation by sexual penetration, any external clitoral stimulation while in the [[missionary position]] usually results from the pubic bone area, the movement of the groins when in contact. As such, some couples may engage in the [[Woman on top (sex position)|woman-on-top]] position or the [[coital alignment technique]], a technique combining the "riding high" variation of the missionary position with pressure-counterpressure movements performed by each partner in rhythm with sexual penetration, to maximize clitoral stimulation.<ref name="Roberts 2006 p145" /><ref name="Greenberg p96" /><ref name="Hurlbert"/> [[Lesbian]] couples may engage in [[tribadism]] for ample clitoral stimulation or for mutual clitoral stimulation during whole-body contact.{{#tag:ref|"A common variation is 'tribadism,' where two women lie face to face, one on top of the other. The genitals are pressed tightly together while the partners move in a grinding motion. Some rub their clitoris against their partner's pubic bone."<ref name="Westheimer" />|group="N"|name="quote_Westheimer"}}<ref name="Carroll 2009 p272" /><ref name="Crooks Baur 2010 p239" /> Pressing the penis or a [[dildo]] in a gliding or circular motion against the clitoris ([[intercrural sex]]), or stimulating it by movement against another body part, during any number of [[sex position]]s, may also be practiced.<ref name="Hite 2003 pp277-284" /><ref name="Halberstam_Greenberg" /> A [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]], or specifically a [[clitoral vibrator]], or other [[sex toy]]s, may be used during or absent of any of the aforementioned practices.<ref name="Hite 2003 pp277-284" /><ref name="Taormino"/> Other women stimulate the clitoris by use of a pillow or other inanimate object, by a jet of water from the faucet of a bathtub or shower, or by closing their legs and rocking.<ref name="Hooper 2001 p68" /><ref name="Hite 2003 p99" /><ref name="Hyde" />

During sexual arousal, the clitoris and the whole of the genitalia engorge and change color as the [[erectile tissue]]s fill with blood ([[vasocongestion]]), and the individual experiences vaginal contractions.<ref name="Yang" /><ref name="Sloane_Archer" /><ref name="Heiman"/> The [[ischiocavernosus muscle|ischiocavernosus]] and [[Bulbospongiosus muscle|bulbocavernosus muscles]], which insert into the corpora cavernosa, "contract and compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris, the only vein that drains the blood from the spaces in the corpora cavernosa" and the arterial blood "continues to pour in and, having no way to drain out, fills the venous spaces until they become turgid and engorged with blood". It is this mechanism that "causes the stiffening and erection of the clitoris".<ref name="Sloane 2002 pp32-33"/>

The clitoral glans doubles in diameter upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible as it is covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood.<ref name="Sloane_Archer" /><ref name="Roberts 2006 p42" /> The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable.<ref name="Roberts 2006 p42" /><ref name="Reinisch_McAnulty" /> Vasocongestion eventually "sets off a muscular reflex" which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm.<ref name="Rosenthal 2012 p133" /> A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state,<ref name="Reinisch" /> with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its normal position and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size.{{#tag:ref|"Within a few seconds the clitoris returns to its normal position, and after 5 to 10 minutes shrinks to its normal size."<ref name="Dennerstein" />|group="N"|name="quote_Dennerstein"}}<ref name="Roberts 2006 p42" /><ref name="Fogel" /> If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable.<ref name="Roberts 2006 p145" /><ref name="Rathus" /> Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women.<ref name="Rathus" /><ref name="Carroll_Rosenthal_Archer_Dennerstein" /> [[Masters and Johnson]] documented the [[Human sexual response cycle|sexual response cycle]], which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm,<ref name="Archer" /><ref name="FFWHC" /><ref name="Lloyd" /> but knowledge of the measurement of physiologic parameters of sexual function in women is lacking "and far behind that in men".<ref name="Şenaylı" />

Prominent debate over the quantity of vaginal nerve endings began with [[Alfred Kinsey]]; although [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory that clitoral orgasms are a prepubertal or adolescent phenomenon and that vaginal (or [[G-Spot]]) orgasms are something that only physically mature females experience had been criticized by few researchers before, Kinsey was the first researcher to harshly criticize the theory.<ref name="Koedt"/><ref name="Tavris" /><ref name="Irvine 2005 pp37–38" /> Through his observations of female masturbation and interviews with thousands of women,<ref name="Archer" /><ref name="Williams 2008 p162" /><ref name="Andersen" /> Kinsey found that most of the women he observed and surveyed could not have vaginal orgasms,<ref name="Irvine 2005 pp37–38" /><ref name="Williams 2008 p162" /><ref name="Pomeroy 1982 p8" /> a finding that was also supported by his knowledge of sex organ anatomy.<ref name="Pomeroy 1982 p8" /> He "criticized Freud and other theorists for projecting male constructs of sexuality onto women" and "viewed the clitoris as the main center of sexual response". He considered the vagina to be "relatively unimportant" for sexual satisfaction, relaying that "few women inserted fingers or objects into their vaginas when they masturbated". Believing that vaginal orgasms are "a physiological impossibility" because the vagina has insufficient nerve endings for sexual pleasure or climax, he "concluded that satisfaction from penile penetration [is] mainly psychological or perhaps the result of referred sensation".<ref name="Irvine 2005 pp37–38" />
[[File:Clit.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An exposed [[clitoral glans]]]]
Masters and Johnson's research, as well as [[Shere Hite]]'s, generally supported Kinsey's findings about the female orgasm.<ref name="FFWHC" /><ref name="Pomeroy_Archer_Hite_Irvine_Williams" /> Masters and Johnson were the first to determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. They observed that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms. On that basis, they argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms,<ref name="FFWHC" /><ref name="Archer_Williams_Rosenthal" /><ref name="Cairney" /> reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood.<ref name="Lloyd p53" /> The research came at the time of the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist movement]], which inspired feminists to reject the distinction made between clitoral and vaginal orgasms.<ref name="Koedt" /><ref name="Fahs 2011 pp38-45" /> Feminist [[Anne Koedt]] argued that because men "have orgasms essentially by friction with the vagina" and not the clitoral area, this is why women's biology had not been properly analyzed. "Today, with extensive knowledge of anatomy, with [C. Lombard Kelly], Kinsey, and Masters and Johnson, to mention just a few sources, there is no ignorance on the subject [of the female orgasm]," she stated in her 1970 article ''[[The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm]].'' She added, "There are, however, social reasons why this knowledge has not been popularized. We are living in a male society which has not sought change in women's role."<ref name="Koedt" />

Supporting an anatomical relationship between the clitoris and vagina is a study published in 2005, which investigated the size of the clitoris; Australian [[Urology|urologist]] Helen O'Connell, described as having initiated discourse among mainstream medical professionals to refocus on and redefine the clitoris, noted a direct relationship between the legs or roots of the clitoris and the erectile tissue of the clitoral bulbs and corpora, and the distal urethra and vagina while using [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] technology.<ref name="O'Connell" /><ref name="Archer" /><ref name="Graves"/> While some studies, using [[ultrasound]], have found physiological evidence of the G-Spot in women who report having orgasms during vaginal intercourse,<ref name="CNNreal" /><ref name="Gravina" /> O'Connell argues that this interconnected relationship is the physiological explanation for the conjectured G-Spot and experience of vaginal orgasms, taking into account the stimulation of the internal parts of the clitoris during vaginal penetration. "The vaginal wall is, in fact, the clitoris," she said. "If you lift the skin off the vagina on the side walls, you get the bulbs of the clitoris&nbsp;– triangular, crescental masses of erectile tissue."<ref name="O'Connell"/> O'Connell et al., having performed dissections on the female genitals of [[cadaver]]s and used photography to map the structure of nerves in the clitoris, made the assertion in 1998 that there is more erectile tissue associated with the clitoris than is generally described in anatomical textbooks, and were thus already aware that the clitoris is more than just its glans.<ref name="Sloane_Archer" /> They concluded that some females have more extensive clitoral tissues and nerves than others, especially having observed this in young cadavers compared to elderly ones,<ref name="Sloane_Archer" /> and therefore whereas the majority of females can only achieve orgasm by direct stimulation of the external parts of the clitoris, the stimulation of the more generalized tissues of the clitoris via vaginal intercourse may be sufficient for others.<ref name="O'Connell"/>

French researchers Odile Buisson and Pierre Foldès reported similar findings to that of O'Connell's. In 2008, they published the first complete 3D [[Medical ultrasonography|sonography]] of the stimulated clitoris,<ref name="Buisson and Foldès 2008" /> and republished it in 2009 with new research, demonstrating the ways in which erectile tissue of the clitoris engorges and surrounds the vagina. On the basis of their findings, they argued that women may be able to achieve vaginal orgasm via stimulation of the G-Spot, because the highly innervated clitoris is pulled closely to the anterior wall of the vagina when the woman is sexually aroused and during vaginal penetration. They assert that since the front wall of the vagina is inextricably linked with the internal parts of the clitoris, stimulating the vagina without activating the clitoris may be next to impossible. In their 2009 published study, the "coronal planes during perineal contraction and finger penetration demonstrated a close relationship between the root of the clitoris and the anterior vaginal wall". Buisson and Foldès suggested "that the special sensitivity of the lower anterior vaginal wall could be explained by pressure and movement of clitoris's root during a vaginal penetration and subsequent perineal contraction".<ref name="Buisson and Foldès 2009" /><ref name="Carroll 2013 p103"/><ref name="Pappas" />

Researcher Vincenzo Puppo, who, while agreeing that the clitoris is the center of female sexual pleasure and believing that there is no anatomical evidence of the vaginal orgasm, disagrees with O'Connell and other researchers' terminological and anatomical descriptions of the clitoris (such as referring to the vestibular bulbs as the "clitoral bulbs") and states that "the inner clitoris" does not exist because the penis cannot come in contact with the congregation of multiple nerves/veins situated until the angle of the clitoris, detailed by [[Georg Ludwig Kobelt|Kobelt]], or with the roots of the clitoris, which do not have sensory receptors or erogenous sensitivity, during vaginal intercourse.<ref name="Puppo" /> Puppo's belief contrasts the general belief among researchers that vaginal orgasms are the result of clitoral stimulation; they reaffirm that clitoral tissue extends even in the area most commonly reported to be the G-Spot.<ref name="Kilchevsky" /><ref name="Cavendish 2010 p590" /><ref name="Alexander/MSNBC 2012" />

The G-Spot being analogous to the base of the male penis has additionally been theorized, with the sentiment that because female fetal development is the "default" state in the absence of substantial exposure to male hormones and therefore the penis is essentially a clitoris enlarged by such hormones, there is no evolutionary reason why females would have an entity in addition to the clitoris that can produce orgasms.<ref name="Alexander/MSNBC 2012" /> The general difficulty of achieving vaginal orgasms, which is a predicament that is likely due to nature easing the process of child bearing by drastically reducing the number of vaginal nerve endings,<ref name="Weiten" /><ref name="Rosenthal 2012 p76" /> challenge arguments that vaginal orgasms help encourage sexual intercourse in order to facilitate reproduction.<ref name="Kilchevsky"/><ref name="Lloyd" /> However, supporting a distinct G-Spot is a study by [[Rutgers University]], published in 2011, which was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain;<ref name="Komisaruk" /> brain scans showed that the brain registered distinct feelings between stimulating the clitoris, the cervix and the vaginal wall&nbsp;– where the G-Spot is reported to be&nbsp;– when several women stimulated themselves in a [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional magnetic resonance]] (fMRI) machine.<ref name="Pappas" /><ref name="Komisaruk" /> Barry Komisaruk, head of the research findings, stated that he feels that "the bulk of the evidence shows that the G-Spot is not a particular thing" and that it is "a region, it's a convergence of many different structures".<ref name="Kilchevsky" />

===Sexual disorders===
[[Persistent genital arousal disorder]] (PGAD) results in a spontaneous, persistent, and uncontrollable genital arousal in women, with or without orgasm, unrelated to any feelings of sexual desire.<ref name="Battaglia"/><ref name="Thubert"/> Clitoral [[priapism]], also known as clitorism, is a rare, potentially painful medical condition and aspect of PGAD,<ref name="Battaglia"/><ref name="Gharahbaghian"/> in which the erect clitoris does not return to its relaxed state for an unusually extended period of time (ranging from minutes to days), despite the absence of both physical and psychological stimulation; it can also be associated with [[morphometrics|morphometric]] and vascular modifications of the clitoris.<ref name="Battaglia"/>

Some drugs, such as [[trazodone]], may cause priapism as a side effect,<ref name="Finger"/> in which case discontinuing the medication may give relief; additionally, the condition can sometimes start only after the discontinuation of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs).<ref name="Goldmeier"/> In some recorded cases, the syndrome was caused by or can cause a pelvic arterial-venous malformation with arterial branches to the penis or clitoris; surgical treatment was effective in these cases.<ref name="Boston"/>

=== Historical and modern perceptions ===
<!-- NOTE: This section is a subsection of "Sexual stimulation, findings and debates" because it significantly concerns those topics. Though "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Medicine-related articles" suggests that this section ("Historical and modern perceptions") be titled "Society and culture," it also notes that it is not necessary to follow that title or its other suggested titles. This section includes a "Modification and mutilation" subsection, which could be combined with the "Sexual disorders" section under a "Clinical relevance" title, but the "Modification and mutilation" section relates heavily to society's views about the clitoris; it is a medical topic, but it is mostly a social topic, thus the hesitance about putting it under a "Clinical relevance" heading as though it ss not a social matter or putting it under a "Society and culture" heading as though it is not a medical matter. -->

====Ancient Greek–16th century knowledge and vernacular ====

With regard to historical and modern perceptions of the clitoris and associated sexual stimulation, for more than 2,500 years there were scholars who considered the clitoris and the penis equivalent in all respects except their arrangement.<ref name="Chalker"/> However, the clitoris was subject to "discovery" and "rediscovery" through empirical documentation by male scholars, due to it being frequently omitted from, or misrepresented, in historical and contemporary anatomical texts.<ref name="O'Connell" /><ref name="Laqueur_Harvey_Ginger" /> The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], and Greek and Roman generations up to and throughout the [[Renaissance]], were aware that male and female sex organs are anatomically similar,<ref name="Chalker 2002 p77" /><ref name="Raab" /> but prominent anatomists, notably [[Galen]] (129 AD&nbsp;– 200 AD) and [[Andreas Vesalius|Vesalius]] (1514–1564), regarded the vagina as the structural equivalent of the penis, except for being inverted. Vesalius argued against the existence of the clitoris in normal women, and his anatomical model showing how the penis corresponds with the vagina displayed no role for the clitoris.<ref name="O'Connell" />

Ancient Greek and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|Roman sexuality]] additionally designated penetration as "male-defined" sexuality. The term ''[[Tribadism|tribas]]'', or ''tribade'', was used to refer to a woman or [[intersex]] individual who actively penetrated another person (male or female) through use of the clitoris or a [[dildo]]. As any sexual act was believed to require that one of the partners be "[[Phallus|phallic]]" and that therefore sexual activity between women was impossible without this feature, popular mythology pictured lesbians as either having enlarged clitorises or as incapable of sexual enjoyment without the substitution of a phallus.<ref name="Swancutt_Halberstam_Sihvola" /><ref name="Norton"/>

In 1545, [[Charles Estienne]] was the first writer to identify the clitoris in a work based on dissection, but he concluded that it had a urinary function.<ref name="O'Connell" /> Following this study, [[Realdo Colombo]] (also known as Matteo Renaldo Colombo), a lecturer in surgery at the [[University of Padua]], Italy, published a book called ''De re anatomica'' in 1559,<ref name="OEtymD"/><ref name="Colombo 1559" /> in which he describes the "seat of woman's delight".<ref name="Colombo 1559" /><ref name="Pitts-Taylor"/> In his role as researcher, Colombo concluded, "Since no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it should be called the love or sweetness of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]."<ref name="Harvey" /><ref name="OEtymD"/> Colombo's claim was disputed by his successor at Padua, [[Gabriele Falloppio]] (who discovered the [[fallopian tube]]), who claimed that he was the first to discover the clitoris. In 1561, Falloppio stated, "Modern anatomists have entirely neglected it&nbsp;... and do not say a word about it&nbsp;... and if others have spoken of it, know that they have taken it from me or my students." This caused an upset in the European medical community, and, having read Colombo and Falloppio's detailed descriptions of the clitoris, Vesalius stated, "It is unreasonable to blame others for incompetence on the basis of some sport of nature you have observed in some women and you can hardly ascribe this new and useless part, as if it were an organ, to healthy women." He concluded, "I think that such a structure appears in [[hermaphrodite]]s who otherwise have well formed genitals, as [[Paul of Aegina]] describes, but I have never once seen in any woman a penis (which [[Avicenna]] called albaratha and the Greeks called an enlarged nympha and classed as an illness) or even the rudiments of a tiny phallus."<ref name="O'Connell" />

It was difficult for the average anatomist to argue against Galen or Vesalius's research; Galen was the most famous physician of the Greek era and his works were considered the standard of medical understanding up to and throughout the Renaissance (i.e. for almost two [[Millennium|millennia]]),<ref name="O'Connell" /><ref name="Raab" /> and various terms being used to describe the clitoris seemed to have further confused the issue of its structure. In addition to Avicenna's naming it the albaratha or virga (''rod'') and Colombo's calling it sweetness of Venus, [[Hippocrates]] used the term columella (''little pillar''), and [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi|Albucasis]], an Arabic medical authority, named it tentigo (''tension''). The names indicated that each description of the structures was about the body and glans of the clitoris, but usually the glans.<ref name="O'Connell" /> It was additionally known to the Romans, who named it (vulgar slang) ''[[landica]]''.<ref name="Adams" /> However, [[Albertus Magnus]], one of the most prolific writers of the Middle Ages, emphasized the "homologies between male and female structures and function" by adding "a psychology of sexual arousal" not found in [[Aristotle]]'s descriptions of the clitoris. Magnus devoted "equal space to his description of the male and female—whereas in [[Constantine the African|Constantine]]'s treatise ''Liber de coitu'', references to the female are quite incidental."<ref name="O'Connell" />

Like Avicenna, Magnus also used the word ''virga'' for the clitoris, but employed it for the male and female genitals; despite his efforts to give equal ground to the clitoris, the cycle of suppression and rediscovery of the organ continued, and a 16th-century justification for [[clitoridectomy]] appears to have been confused by hermaphroditism and the imprecision created by the word ''nymphae'' substituted for the word ''clitoris''. [[Nymphotomy|Nymphotomia]] was a medical operation to excise an unusually large clitoris, but what was considered "unusually large" was often a matter of perception.<ref name="O'Connell" /> The procedure was routinely performed on [[Egypt]]ian women,<ref name="Momoh" /><ref name="Koroma"/> due to physicians such as [[Jacques Daléchamps]] who believed that this version of the clitoris was "an unusual feature that occurred in almost all Egyptian women [and] some of ours, so that when they find themselves in the company of other women, or their clothes rub them while they walk or their husbands wish to approach them, it erects like a male penis and indeed they use it to play with other women, as their husbands would do&nbsp;... Thus the parts are cut".<ref name="O'Connell" />

====17th century–present day knowledge and vernacular====
[[Caspar Bartholin the Younger|Caspar Bartholin]], a 17th-century Danish anatomist, dismissed Colombo and Falloppio's claims that they discovered the clitoris, arguing that the clitoris had been widely known to medical science since the second century.<ref name="Chalker 2002 p78" /> Although 17th-century midwives recommended to men and women that women should aspire to achieve orgasms to help them get pregnant for general health and well-being and to keep their relationships healthy,<ref name="Raab" /> debate about the importance of the clitoris persisted, notably in the work of [[Regnier de Graaf]] in the 17th century<ref name="O'Connell 2006" /><ref name="Jocelyn"/> and [[Georg Ludwig Kobelt]] in the 19th.<ref name="O'Connell" /><ref name="Kobelt" />

Like Falloppio and Bartholin, De Graaf criticized Colombo's claim of having discovered the clitoris; his work appears to have provided the first comprehensive account of clitoral anatomy.<ref name="O'Connell" /><ref name="O'Connell 2006" /> "We are extremely surprised that some anatomists make no more mention of this part than if it did not exist at all in the universe of nature," he stated. "In every [[cadaver]] we have so far dissected we have found it quite perceptible to sight and touch." De Graaf stressed the need to distinguish ''nympha'' from ''clitoris'', choosing to "always give [the clitoris] the name clitoris" to avoid confusion; this resulted in frequent use of the correct name for the organ among anatomists, but considering that ''nympha'' was also varied in its use and eventually became the term specific to the labia minora, more confusion ensued.<ref name="O'Connell" /> Debate about whether orgasm was even necessary for women began in the [[Victorian era]], and Freud's 1905 theory about the immaturity of clitoral orgasms ([[#Clitoral and vaginal orgasmic factors and relationships|see above]]) negatively affected women's sexuality throughout most of the 20th century.<ref name="Raab" /><ref name="Chalker 2002 p83" /> From the 18th&nbsp;– 20th century, especially during the 20th, details of the clitoris from various genital diagrams presented in earlier centuries were omitted from later texts.<ref name="Raab"/><ref name="Chalker_O'Connell_Ginger" />
[[File:Clitoris disséqué par Kobelt en 1844.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Georg Ludwig Kobelt]] illustration of the anatomy of the clitoris]]
The full extent of the clitoris was alluded to by Masters and Johnson in 1966, but in such a muddled fashion that the significance of their description became obscured; in 1981, the Federation of Feminist Women's Health Clinics (FFWHC) continued this process with anatomically precise illustrations identifying 18 structures of the clitoris.<ref name="Carroll 2012 pp110-111, 252"/><ref name="Raab" /> Despite the FFWHC's illustrations, Josephine Lowndes Sevely, in 1987, described the vagina as more of the counterpart of the penis.<ref name="Frayser" />

With regard to other beliefs about the clitoris, Hite (1976 and 1981) found that, during sexual intimacy with a partner, clitoral stimulation was more often described by women as [[foreplay]] than as a primary method of sexual activity and orgasm.<ref name="Hite 2003 pp261-264" /> Further, although the FFWHC's work created "fertile ground for feminist reformation of anatomical texts" and "revolutionized existing descriptions and renderings of the clitoris," it did not have a general impact on anatomical texts;<ref name="Graves"/><ref name="Seidman" /> it took Helen O'Connell's late 1990s research for the medical community to start changing the way the clitoris is anatomically defined.<ref name="Graves"/> O'Connell describes typical textbook descriptions of the clitoris as lacking detail and including inaccuracies, such as older and modern anatomical descriptions of the female human urethral and genital anatomy having been based on dissections performed on elderly cadavers whose erectile (clitoral) tissue had shrunk.<ref name="Sloane_Archer" /> She instead credits the work of Georg Ludwig Kobelt as the most comprehensive and accurate description of clitoral anatomy.<ref name="O'Connell" /> [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] measurements, which provide a live and multi-planar method of examination, now complement the FFWHC's, as well as O'Connell's, research efforts regarding the clitoris, showing that the volume of clitoral erectile tissue is ten times that which is shown in doctors' offices and in anatomy text books.<ref name="O'Connell 2006" /><ref name="Graves" />

In [[Bruce Bagemihl]]'s survey of ''[[The Zoological Record]]'' (1978–1997)&nbsp;– which contains over a million documents from over 6,000 scientific journals&nbsp;– 539 articles focusing on the penis were found, while 7 were found focusing on the clitoris.<ref name="Balcombe" /> In 2000, researchers Shirley Ogletree and Harvey Ginsberg concluded that there is a general neglect of the word ''clitoris'' in common vernacular. They looked at the terms used to describe genitalia in the [[PsycINFO]] database from 1887 to 2000 and found that ''penis'' was used in 1,482 sources, ''vagina'' in 409, while ''clitoris'' was only mentioned in 83. They additionally analyzed 57 books listed in a computer database for sex instruction. In the majority of the books, ''penis'' was the most commonly discussed body part&nbsp;– mentioned more than ''clitoris'', ''vagina'', and ''uterus'' put together. They last investigated terminology used by college students, ranging from Euro-American (76%/76%), Hispanic (18%/14%), and African American (4%/7%), regarding the students' beliefs about sexuality and knowledge on the subject. The students were overwhelmingly educated to believe that the vagina is the female counterpart of the penis. The authors found that the students' belief that the inner portion of the vagina is the most sexually sensitive part of the female body correlated with negative attitudes toward masturbation and strong support for sexual myths.<ref name="Ogletree" /><ref name="Waskul"/>

A 2005 study reported that, among a sample of undergraduate students, the most frequently cited sources for knowledge about the clitoris were school and friends, and that this was associated with the least amount of tested knowledge. Knowledge of the clitoris by self-exploration was the least cited, but "respondents correctly answered, on average, three of the five clitoral knowledge measures". The authors stated, "Knowledge correlated significantly with the frequency of women's orgasm in masturbation but not partnered sex. Our results are discussed in light of gender inequality and a social construction of sexuality, endorsed by both men and women, that privileges men's sexual pleasure over women's, such that orgasm for women is pleasing, but ultimately incidental." They concluded that part of the solution to remedying "this problem" requires that males and females are taught more about the clitoris than is currently practiced.<ref name="Wade" />

In 2012, New York artist Sophia Wallace started work on a multimedia project to challenge misconceptions about the clitoris. Based on O'Connell's 1998 work, Wallace's work emphasizes the sheer scope and size of the human clitoris. She says that ignorance of this still seems to be pervasive in modern society. "It is a curious dilemma to observe the paradox that on the one hand the female body is the primary metaphor for sexuality, its use saturates advertising, art and the mainstream erotic imaginary," she said. "Yet, the clitoris, the true female sexual organ, is virtually invisible." The project is called ''Cliteracy'' and it includes a "clit rodeo", which is an interactive, climb-on model of a giant golden clitoris, including its inner parts, produced with the help of sculptor Kenneth Thomas. "It's been a showstopper wherever its been shown. People are hungry to be able to talk about this," Wallace said. "I love seeing men standing up for the clit [...] Not having access to the pleasure that is your birthright is a deeply political act."<ref name="Mosbergen"/>

In May 2013, [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] group [[Clitoraid]] launched the first annual International Clitoris Awareness Week, from May 6 to May 12. Clitoraid spokesperson Nadine Gary stated that the group's mission is to raise public awareness about the clitoris because it has "been ignored, vilified, made taboo, and considered sinful and shameful for centuries".<ref name="The Wall Street Journal"/><ref name="Moye"/>

==== Modification and mutilation ====
{{main|Genital modification and mutilation|Female genital mutilation|Clitoromegaly}}
[[File:Большой клитор.jpg|thumb|upright|An enlarged clitoris due to clitoromegaly]]
Motivations for clitoral modification and mutilation vary, as well as their effects on sexual stimulation. One modification is [[Clitoral enlargement methods|clitoris enlargement]].<ref name="Şenaylı" /><ref name="Perovic" /><ref name="Meyer" /> Those taking hormones or other medications as part of [[female-to-male]] [[transitioning (transgender)|transition]] usually experience dramatic clitoral growth; individual desires and the difficulties of [[phalloplasty]] (construction of a penis) often result in the retention of the original genitalia with the enlarged clitoris as a penis analogue.<ref name="Şenaylı" /><ref name="Perovic" /><ref name="Meyer" /> However, the clitoris cannot reach the size of the penis through hormones.<ref name="Meyer" /> Surgery to add function to the clitoris, such as [[metoidioplasty]] or clitoral release, are alternatives to phalloplasty that permit retention of sexual sensation in the clitoris.<ref name="Perovic" /> Use of [[anabolic steroid]]s by bodybuilders and other athletes can also result in significant enlargement of the clitoris in concert with other masculinizing effects on their bodies.<ref name="Freberg" /><ref name="DEA"/> Abnormal enlargement of the clitoris may also be referred to as ''clitoromegaly'', but clitoromegaly is more commonly seen as a [[Congenital anomalies of the genitalia|congenital anomaly of the genitalia]].<ref name="Hořkejškí" /><ref name="Copcu" />

Parts of the clitoris may be partially or completely removed during female genital mutilation (FGM); this may be additionally known as a [[clitoridectomy]], female circumcision, or female genital cutting (FGC), and great controversy surrounds the procedures.<ref name="Crooks Baur 2010 pp54–56" /><ref name="WHO, FGM"/> These practices have existed at one point or another in almost all human civilizations,<ref name="Momoh" /> usually to exert control over the sexual behavior, including masturbation, of girls and women, but also to change the clitoris's appearance.<ref name="Koroma"/><ref name="WHO, FGM"/><ref name="Momoh_Greenberg" /> It is carried out in several countries, especially in [[Africa]], with 85 percent of genital mutilations performed in Africa consisting of clitoridectomy or excision,<ref name="Koroma"/><ref name="Fuller" /> and to a lesser extent in other parts of the [[Middle East]] and [[Southeast Asia]], on girls from a few days old to mid-adolescent, often to reduce sexual desire in an effort to preserve vaginal [[virginity]].<ref name="Koroma"/><ref name="WHO, FGM"/><ref name="Momoh_Greenberg" /> In the United States, it is sometimes practiced on girls "born with a larger than normal clitoris".<ref name="Crooks Baur 2010 pp54–56" />

Custom and tradition are the most frequently cited reasons for FGM, with some cultures believing that not performing it has the possibility of disrupting the cohesiveness of their social and political systems, such as FGM also being a part of a girl's initiation into adulthood. Often, a girl is not considered an adult in a FGM-practicing society unless she has undergone FGM, and the "removal of the clitoris and labia&nbsp;– viewed by some as the ''male parts'' of a woman's body&nbsp;– is thought to enhance the girl's femininity, often synonymous with docility and obedience".<ref name="Koroma"/><ref name="WHO, FGM"/> Some authors believe that it was also "practiced in ancient Egypt as a sign of distinction among the aristocracy, and have reported that traces of [[infibulation]] can be found on Egyptian mummies".<ref name="Momoh" /> It is still routinely practiced in Egypt.<ref name="Koroma"/><ref name="Greenberg p95" /> "[O]ne study found that 97% of married women in Egypt had had some form of genital mutilation performed."<ref name="Greenberg p95" /> [[Amnesty International]] estimated in 1997 that more than two million FGM procedures are performed every year.<ref name="Koroma"/> The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is one of many health organizations that have campaigned against the procedures on behalf of [[human rights]], stating that "FGM has no health benefits" and that it is "a violation of the human rights of girls and women" and "reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes".<ref name="WHO, FGM"/>

Removing the glans of the clitoris does not mean that the whole structure is lost, since the clitoris reaches deep into the genitals.<ref name="O'Connell" /> The largest group requiring surgical genital correction are females with [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].<ref name="Şenaylı" /> Researcher Atilla Şenaylı stated, "The main expectations for the operations are to create a normal female anatomy, with minimal complications and improvement of life quality. Cosmesis, structural integrity, and coital capacity of the vagina, and absence of pain during sexual activity are the parameters to be judged by the surgeon." Atilla added that although "expectations can be standardized within these few parameters, operative techniques have not yet become homogeneous. Investigators have preferred different operations for different ages of patients".<ref name="Şenaylı" />

Gender assessment and surgical treatment are the two main steps in [[intersex]] operations. "The first treatments for clitoromegaly were simply resection of the clitoris. Later, it was understood that the clitoris glans and sensory input are important to facilitate orgasm," stated Atilla. The clitoral glans's epithelium "has high cutaneous sensitivity, which is important in sexual responses" and it is because of this that "recession clitoroplasty was later devised as an alternative, but reduction clitoroplasty is the method currently performed. In this operation, the glans is preserved and parts of the erectile bodies are excised".<ref name="Şenaylı" /> Problems with this technique include loss of sensation, sexual function, and sloughing of the glans.<ref name="Şenaylı" /> One way to preserve the clitoris with its innervations and function is to imbricate and bury the clitoral glans; however, "pain during stimulus because of trapped tissue under the scarring is nearly routine. In another method, 50&nbsp;percent of the ventral clitoris is removed through the level base of the clitoral shaft, and it is reported that good sensation and clitoral function are observed in follow up"; additionally, it has "been reported that the complications are from the same as those in the older procedures for this method".<ref name="Şenaylı" />

What is often referred to as "[[clitoris piercing|clit piercing]]" is actually the more common (and significantly less complicated) [[clitoral hood piercing]]. Since clitoral piercing is difficult and very painful, piercing of the clitoral hood is more common than piercing the clitoral shaft, owing to the small percentage of people who are anatomically suited for it; furthermore, most piercing artists are reluctant to attempt such a delicate procedure.<ref name="Stirn"/><ref name="Millner"/> This is especially the case in the United States; in various cultures, however, the clitoris is sometimes pierced directly.<ref name="Stirn"/><ref name="Millner"/> Clitoral piercing or clitoral hood piercing are sometimes channeled in the form of horizontal and vertical piercings. The triangle is a very deep horizontal hood piercing, and is done behind the clitoris as opposed to in front of it. Some styles, such as the [[Isabella piercing|Isabella]], pass through the clitoris but are placed deep at the base, where they provide unique stimulation; they still require the proper genital build, but are more common than general shaft piercings.<ref name="Stirn"/><ref name="Millner"/>

==== Vestigiality, adaptionist and reproductive views ====

Whether the clitoris is [[vestigiality|vestigial]], an [[adaptation]], or serves a [[Reproduction|reproductive]] function has also been debated.<ref name="Angier_Gould_Lloyd_Miller"/><ref name="Chivers" /> [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] states that [[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen Fisher]], [[Meredith Small]] and [[Sarah Blaffer Hrdy]] "have viewed the clitoral orgasm as a legitimate adaptation in its own right, with major implications for female sexual behavior and sexual evolution".<ref name="Miller" /> Like [[Lynn Margulis]] and [[Natalie Angier]], Miller believes, "The human clitoris shows no apparent signs of having evolved directly through male mate choice. It is not especially large, brightly colored, specifically shaped or selectively displayed during courtship." He contrasts this with other female species such as [[spider monkey]]s and [[spotted hyena]]s that have clitorises as long as their male counterparts. He suggests that the human clitoris "could have evolved to be much more conspicuous if males had preferred sexual partners with larger brighter clitorises and that its "inconspicuous design combined with its exquisite sensitivity suggests that the clitoris is important not as an object of male mate choice, but as a mechanism of female choice".<ref name="Miller" />

While Miller states that male scientists such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Donald Symons]] "have viewed the female clitoral orgasm as an evolutionary side-effect of the male capacity for penile orgasm" and that they "suggested that clitoral orgasm cannot be an adaptation because it is too hard to achieve,"<ref name="Miller" /> Gould acknowledged that "most female orgasms emanate from a clitoral, rather than vaginal (or some other), site" and that his nonadaptive belief "has been widely misunderstood as a denial of either the adaptive value of female orgasm in general, or even as a claim that female orgasms lack significance in some broader sense". He explained that although he accepts that "clitoral orgasm plays a pleasurable and central role in female sexuality and its joys," "[a]ll these favorable attributes, however, emerge just as clearly and just as easily, whether the clitoral site of orgasm arose as a [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]] or an adaptation". He said that the "male biologists who fretted over [the adaptionist questions] simply assumed that a deeply vaginal site, nearer the region of fertilization, would offer greater selective benefit" due to their [[Darwinism|Darwinian]], ''[[summum bonum]]'' beliefs about enhanced reproductive success.<ref name="Gould" />

Similar to Gould's beliefs about adaptionist views and that "females grow nipples as adaptations for suckling, and males grow smaller unused nipples as a spandrel based upon the value of single development channels,"<ref name="Gould" /> [[Elisabeth Lloyd]] suggests that there is little evidence to support an adaptionist account of female orgasm.<ref name="Lloyd" /><ref name="Chivers" /> "Lloyd views female orgasm as an [[Ontogeny|ontogenetic]] leftover; women have orgasms because the urogenital neurophysiology for orgasm is so strongly selected for in males that this developmental blueprint gets expressed in females without affecting fitness, just as males have nipples that serve no fitness-related function," stated Meredith L. Chivers.<ref name="Chivers" />

At the 2002 conference for ''Canadian Society of Women in Philosophy'', Dr. Nancy Tuana asserted that the clitoris is unnecessary in reproduction; she states that it has been ignored because of "a fear of pleasure. It is pleasure separated from reproduction. That's the fear". She reasoned that this fear causes ignorance, which veils female sexuality.<ref name="Cairney" /> O'Connell states, "It boils down to rivalry between the sexes: the idea that one sex is sexual and the other reproductive. The truth is that both are sexual and both are reproductive." She reiterates that the vestibular bulbs appear to be part of the clitoris and that the distal urethra and vagina are intimately related structures, although they are not erectile in character, forming a tissue cluster with the clitoris that appears to be the location of female sexual function and orgasm.<ref name="O'Connell" /><ref name="Yang" />

== Other animals ==

===General===
<!-- NOTE: As this section relays, the clitoris has not been extensively studied with regard to non-human animals. A section has not been created for each of the animals mentioned because there is not a lot of detail about each animal; as Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout#Paragraphs states, "The number of single-sentence paragraphs should be minimized" and "Short paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading." This is why this section has been divided in the way that it has. If the material is a small piece (a sentence, or a paragraph of only a couple or few sentences) about an animal that does not yet have its own section, consider adding it here in the "General" section instead of creating a subsection for it. -->

Although the clitoris exists in all female mammalian species,<ref name="Balcombe" /> few detailed studies of the anatomy of the clitoris in non-human animals exist.<ref name="Martin-Alguacil" /> The clitoris is especially developed in [[ape]]s, [[lemur]]s, and, like the penis, often contains a small bone, the [[Baculum|os clitoridis]].<ref name="Angier_Hall_Goodman" /> The clitoris exists in [[ostrich]]es,<ref name="Kotpal" /> and it erects in female squirrels not necessarily for reproduction but rather for dominance; this dominance indirectly leads to the squirrels' reproductive success.<ref name="Wingfield 2006 p2023" /> In female [[galago]]s (bush babies), the clitoris is long and pendulous with a urethra extending through the tip for urination.<ref name="Bagemihl" /><ref name="Roughgarden 2004 pp37-40" /> [[Intersex]] female [[grizzly bear]]s, [[brown bear]]s, [[American black bear]]s and [[polar bear]]s "mate and give birth through the tip of [the] clitoris"; although they have been described as having "a birth canal that runs through the clitoris rather than forming a separate vagina" (a feature that is estimated to make up 10 to 20 percent of the bears' population),<ref name="Girshick_Roughgarden" /> scientists state that female [[spotted hyena]]s, which are not [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]], are the only female mammalian species devoid of an external vaginal opening.<ref name="Glickman" />

===Spider monkeys and bonobos===
In [[spider monkey]]s, the clitoris is especially developed and has an interior passage, or urethra, that makes it almost identical to the penis, and it retains and distributes urine droplets as the female spider monkey moves around. This urine "is voided at the bases of the clitoris, flows down the shallow groove on its perineal surface, and is held by the skin folds on each side of the groove".<ref name="Dixson" /> Because spider monkeys of South America have pendulous and erectile clitorises long enough to be mistaken for a penis, researchers and observers of the species look for a scrotum to determine the animal's sex; a similar approach is to identify [[Territory (animal)#Scent marking|scent-marking]] glands that may also be present on the clitoris.<ref name="Roughgarden 2004 pp37-40" />

The clitoris of [[bonobo]]s is larger and more externalized than in most mammals;<ref name="Balcombe 2011" /> a young adolescent "female bonobo is maybe half the weight of a human teenager, but her clitoris is three times bigger than the human equivalent, and visible enough to waggle unmistakably as she walks".<ref name="Angier" /> Female bonobos often engage in the practice of genital-genital (GG) rubbing, which is the non-human form of [[tribadism]] that human females engage in. Female bonobos rub their clitorises together rapidly for ten to twenty seconds, and this behavior, "which may be repeated in rapid succession, is usually accompanied by grinding, shrieking, and clitoral engorgement"; on average, they engage in this practice "about once every two hours".<ref name="Balcombe 2011" /> As bonobos, like humans, mate face-to-face, "evolutionary biologist Marlene Zuk has suggested that the position of the clitoris in bonobos and some other primates has evolved to maximize stimulation during sexual intercourse".<ref name="Balcombe 2011" />

{{Anchor|Spotted hyena}}

===Spotted hyenas===
[[File:Spotted hyena in Kenya.jpg|thumb|left|With a [[Genitourinary system|urogenital system]] in which the female urinates, mates and gives birth via an enlarged, erectile clitoris, female spotted hyenas are the only female mammalian species devoid of an external vaginal opening.<ref name="Glickman" />]]
While female [[spotted hyena]]s are sometimes referred to as [[hermaphrodite]]s or as [[intersex]],<ref name="Roughgarden 2004 pp37-40" /> and scientists of antiquity (ancient and later historical times) believed that spotted hyenas were hermaphrodites,<ref name="Roughgarden 2004 pp37-40" /><ref name="Glickman" /><ref name="Rosenzweig" /> modern scientists do not refer to them as hermaphrodites.<ref name="Glickman" /><ref name="Blumberg" /> That designation is typically reserved for those who simultaneously exhibit features of both sexes;<ref name="Blumberg" /> the genetic makeup of female spotted hyenas "are clearly distinct" from male spotted hyenas.<ref name="Glickman" /><ref name="Blumberg" />

Female spotted hyenas have a clitoris 90&nbsp;percent as long and the same diameter as a male penis (171 millimeters long and 22 millimeters in diameter),<ref name="Roughgarden 2004 pp37-40" /> and this [[pseudo-penis]]'s formation seems largely [[androgen]]-independent because it appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and [[adrenal gland]].<ref name="Glickman"/> The spotted hyenas have a highly erectile clitoris, complete with a false scrotum, and "the resemblance to male genitalia is so close that sex can be determined with confidence only by palpation of the scrotum".<ref name="Wingfield 2006 p2023" /> The pseudo-penis can also be distinguished from the males' genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded glans.<ref name="Glickman" /> The female possesses no external vagina, as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. In the females, this scrotum consists of soft adipose tissue.<ref name="Wingfield 2006 p2023" /><ref name="Glickman" /><ref name="Kruuk"/><ref name="Szykman"/> Like male spotted hyenas with regard to their penises, the female spotted hyenas have small [[penile spines]] "on the glans, or head, of [their clitorises], making the clitoris tip feel like soft sandpaper".<ref name="Blackledge 2003 p90" /> The clitoris "extends away from the body in a sleek and slender arc, measuring, on average, over 17 cm from root to tip. Just like a penis, [it] is fully erectile, raising its head in hyena greeting ceremonies, social displays, games of rough and tumble or when sniffing out peers".<ref name="Blackledge 2003 p90" />

Due to their higher levels of androgen exposure, the female hyenas are significantly more muscular and aggressive than their male counterparts; social-wise, they are of higher rank than the males, being [[Dominance (ethology)|dominant]] or dominant and [[Alpha (ethology)|alpha]], and the females who have been exposed to higher levels of androgen than average become higher-ranking than their female peers. Subordinate females lick the clitorises of higher-ranked females as a sign of submission and obedience, but females also lick each other's clitorises as a greeting or to strengthen social bonds; in contrast, while all males lick the clitorises of dominant females, the females will not lick the penises of males because males are considered to be of lowest rank.<ref name="Kruuk"/><ref name="Szykman"/><ref name="Carey"/>

The urethra and vagina of the female spotted hyena exit through the clitoris, allowing the females to urinate, copulate and give birth through this organ.<ref name="Wingfield 2006 p2023" /><ref name="Glickman" /><ref name="Blackledge 2003 p90" /><ref name="Baskin"/> This trait makes mating more laborious for the male than in other mammals, and also makes attempts to [[Sexual coercion|sexually coerce]] (physically force sexual activity on) females futile.<ref name="Kruuk"/><ref name="Szykman"/> Because the hyena's clitoris is higher on the belly than the vagina in most mammals, the male hyena "must slide his rear under the female when mating so that his penis lines up with [her clitoris]". In an action similar to pushing up a shirtsleeve, the "female retracts the [pseudo-penis] on itself, and creates an opening into which the male inserts his own penis".<ref name="Roughgarden 2004 pp37-40" /> The male must practice this act, which can take a couple of months to successfully perform.<ref name="Carey"/> Female spotted hyenas exposed to larger doses of androgen have significantly damaged ovaries, making it difficult to conceive.<ref name="Carey"/> After giving birth, the pseudo-penis is stretched and loses much of its original aspects; it becomes a slack-walled and reduced prepuce with an enlarged orifice with split lips.<ref name="Rosevear 1974 pp357–358" /> Approximately 15% of the females die during their first time giving birth, and over 60% of their species' firstborn young die.<ref name="Roughgarden 2004 pp37-40" />

A 2006 Baskin et al. study concluded, "The basic anatomical structures of the corporeal bodies in both sexes of humans and spotted hyenas were similar. As in humans, the dorsal nerve distribution was unique in being devoid of nerves at the 12 o'clock position in the penis and clitoris of the spotted hyena" and that "[d]orsal nerves of the penis/clitoris in humans and male spotted hyenas tracked along both sides of the corporeal body to the corpus spongiosum at the 5 and 7 o'clock positions. The dorsal nerves penetrated the corporeal body and distally the glans in the hyena" and, in female hyenas, "the dorsal nerves fanned out laterally on the clitoral body. Glans morphology was different in appearance in both sexes, being wide and blunt in the female and tapered in the male".<ref name="Baskin" />

===Cats, sheep, and mice===

Researchers studying the peripheral and central afferent pathways from the feline clitoris concluded that "Afferent neurons projecting to the clitoris of the cat were identified by WGA-HRP tracing in the S1 and S2 dorsal root ganglia. An average of 433 cells were identified on each side of the animal. 85&nbsp;percent and 15&nbsp;percent of the labeled cells were located in the S1 and S2 dorsal root ganglia, respectively. The average cross sectional area of clitoral afferent neuron profiles was 1.479±627 μm2." They also stated that light "constant pressure on the clitoris produced an initial burst of single unit firing (maximum frequencies 170–255 Hz) followed by rapid adaptation and a sustained firing (maximum 40 Hz), which was maintained during the stimulation. Tonic firing increased to an average maximum of 145 Hz at 6–8 g/mm2 pressure" and "[t]hese results indicate that the clitoris is innervated by mechano-sensitive myelinated afferent fibers in the pudental nerve which project centrally to the region of the dorsal commissure in the L7-S1 spinal cord".<ref name="Kawatani" />

The external phenotype and reproductive behavior of 21 [[freemartin]] sheep and two male pseudohermaphrodite sheep were recorded with the aim of identifying any characteristics that could predict a failure to breed. Among things recorded were the size and shape of the vulva and clitoris, the length of the vagina, the size of the teats, the presence or absence of inguinal gonads, and the ultrasonographic characteristics of the inguinal gonads: "A subjective assessment of the masculinity of each animal's body form was also made, and its behavioural responses to a virile ram and to an oestrus ewe were recorded. A number of physical and behavioural abnormalities were detected but the only consistent finding in all 23 animals was a short vagina which varied in length from 3.1 to 7.0 cm, compared with 10 to 14 cm in normal animals."<ref name="Smith" />

In a study documenting the clitoral structure of mice, it was found that the mouse perineal urethra is surrounded by erectile tissue forming the bulbs of the clitoris, similar to the anatomy of human females:<ref name="Martin-Alguacil" /> "In the mouse, as in human females, tissue organization in the corpora cavernosa of the clitoris is essentially similar to that of the penis except for the absence of a subalbugineal layer interposed between the tunica albuginea and the erectile tissue."<ref name="Martin-Alguacil" />
