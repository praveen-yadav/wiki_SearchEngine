'''Mouthwash''' or '''mouth rinse''' is an [[antiseptic]] solution used as an effective home care system by the patient to enhance [[oral hygiene]]. Some manufacturers of mouthwash claim that [[antiseptic]] and anti-plaque mouth rinse kill the [[Dental plaque|bacterial plaque]] causing [[Dental caries|cavities]], [[gingivitis]], and [[bad breath]]. Anti-cavity mouth rinse uses [[fluoride]] to protect against [[tooth decay]]. It is, however, generally agreed that the use of mouthwash does not eliminate the need for both [[toothbrush|brushing]] and [[flossing]].<ref name="Gunsolley">{{cite journal |pmid=17138709 |year=2006 |last1=Gunsolley |first1=JC |title=A meta-analysis of six-month studies of antiplaque and antigingivitis agents |volume=137 |issue=12 |pages=1649–57 |journal=Journal of the American Dental Association}}</ref><ref name="Tal">{{cite journal |pmid=2366142 |year=1990 |last1=Tal |first1=H |last2=Rosenberg |first2=M |title=Estimation of dental plaque levels and gingival inflammation using a simple oral rinse technique |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=339–42 |journal=Journal of periodontology |doi=10.1902/jop.1990.61.6.339}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6799764 |title=Listerine no replacement for flossing?|work=NBC News | date=7 January 2005 | accessdate=14 October 2013 }}</ref> As per the [[American Dental Association]], regular brushing and proper flossing are enough in most cases although the ADA has placed its Seal of Approval on many mouthwashes that do not contain alcohol (in addition to regular dental check-ups).<ref>[https://www.ada.org/prof/resources/pubs/jada/patient/patient_01.pdf Simple Routine for Basic Oral Care]</ref>

==History==
The first known references to mouth rinsing is in [[Ayurveda]] and [[Chinese medicine]], about 2700 BC, for treatment of [[gingivitis]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Later, in the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] periods, mouth rinsing following mechanical cleansing became common among the upper classes, and [[Hippocrates]] recommended a mixture of salt, [[alum]], and vinegar.<ref name="Fischman">{{cite journal |pages=7–14 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0757.1997.tb00099.x |title=The history of oral hygiene products: How far have we come in 6000 years? |year=1997 |last1=Fischman |first1=Stuart L. |journal=Periodontology 2000 |volume=15 |pmid=9643227}}</ref> The Jewish [[Talmud]], dating back about 1800 years, suggests a cure for gum ailments containing "dough water" and olive oil.<ref name="Shifman">{{cite journal |pmid=12389360 |year=2002 |last1=Shifman |first1=A |last2=Orenbuch |first2=S |last3=Rosenberg |first3=M |title=Bad breath--a major disability according to the Talmud |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=843–5 |journal=The Israel Medical Association journal}}</ref>

[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], the famous 17th century [[microscopist]], discovered living organisms (living, because they were motile) in deposits on the teeth (what we now call [[dental plaque]]). He also found organisms in water from the canal next to his home in Delft. He experimented with samples by adding vinegar or brandy and found that this resulted in the immediate immobilization or killing of the organisms suspended in water. Next he tried rinsing the mouth of himself and somebody else with a mouthwash containing vinegar or brandy and found that living organisms remained in the dental plaque. He concluded&mdash;correctly&mdash;that the mouthwash either did not reach, or was not present long enough, to kill the plaque organisms.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lax |first=Alistair |date=Oct 27, 2005 |title=Toxin: The cunning of bacterial poisons |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IuvRClJOT5EC&lpg=PT27&dq=Leeuwenhoek%20dental%20plaque%20mouthwash&pg=PT27#v=onepage&q=Leeuwenhoek%20dental%20plaque%20mouthwash&f=false |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191578502 |accessdate=November 26, 2013}}</ref>

That remained the state of affairs until the late 1960s when Harald Loe (at the time a professor at the [[Aarhus University|Royal Dental College]] in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]]) demonstrated that a [[chlorhexidine]] compound could prevent the build-up of dental plaque. The reason for chlorhexidine effectiveness is that it strongly adheres to surfaces in the mouth and thus remains present in effective concentrations for many hours.<ref name="Loe">{{cite journal |pmid=4575037 |year=1972 |last1=Budtz-Jörgensen |first1=E |last2=Löe |first2=H |title=Chlorhexidine as a denture disinfectant in the treatment of denture stomatitis |volume=80 |issue=6 |pages=457–64 |journal=Scandinavian journal of dental research}}</ref>

Since then commercial interest in mouthwashes has been intense and several newer products claim effectiveness in reducing the build-up in dental plaque and the associated severity of gingivitis (inflammation of the gums), in addition to fighting bad breath. Many of these solutions aim to control the Volatile Sulfur Compound (VSC)-creating anaerobic bacteria that live in the mouth and excrete substances that lead to bad breath and unpleasant mouth taste.<ref name="Bosy">{{cite journal |pmid=8133414 |year=1994 |last1=Bosy |first1=A |last2=Kulkarni |first2=GV |last3=Rosenberg |first3=M |last4=McCulloch |first4=CA |title=Relationship of oral malodor to periodontitis: Evidence of independence in discrete subpopulations |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=37–46 |journal=Journal of periodontology |doi=10.1902/jop.1994.65.1.37}}</ref><ref name="Loesche">{{cite journal |pages=256–79 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0757.2002.280111.x |title=Microbiology and treatment of halitosis |year=2002 |last1=Loesche |first1=Walter J. |last2=Kazor |first2=Christopher |journal=Periodontology 2000 |volume=28 |pmid=12013345}}</ref>

==Use==
Common use involves rinsing the mouth with about 20[[milliliter|ml]] (2/3 [[fluid ounce|fl oz]]) of mouthwash two times a day after brushing. The wash is typically swished or [[gargling|gargled]] for about half a minute and then spat out. Most companies suggest not drinking water immediately after using mouthwash. In some brands, the [[expectorate]] is stained, so that one can see the bacteria and debris.<ref name="Kozlovsky">{{cite journal |pmid=8794967 |year=1996 |last1=Kozlovsky |first1=A |last2=Goldberg |first2=S |last3=Natour |first3=I |last4=Rogatky-Gat |first4=A |last5=Gelernter |first5=I |last6=Rosenberg |first6=M |title=Efficacy of a 2-phase oil: Water mouthrinse in controlling oral malodor, gingivitis, and plaque |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=577–82 |journal=Journal of periodontology}}</ref><ref name="Rosenberg1">{{cite journal |pmid=1552460 |year=1992 |last1=Rosenberg |first1=M |last2=Gelernter |first2=I |last3=Barki |first3=M |last4=Bar-Ness |first4=R |title=Day-long reduction of oral malodor by a two-phase oil:water mouthrinse as compared to chlorhexidine and placebo rinses |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=39–43 |journal=Journal of periodontology}}</ref> Some may suggest that it is probably advisable to use mouthwash at least an hour after brushing with toothpaste when the toothpaste contains [[sodium lauryl sulfate]], since the anionic compounds in the SLS [[toothpaste]] can deactivate cationic agents present in the mouthrinse.<ref name="Rosenberg2">{{cite journal |pages=72–9 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0402-72 |title=The Science of Bad Breath |year=2002 |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Mel |journal=Scientific American |volume=286 |issue=4 |pmid=11905111}}</ref> However, many would disagree with this hypothesis; in fact, many of the popular mouthwashes contain sodium lauryl sulfate as an ingredient (e.g., Listerine Total Care).{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Alternative mouthwash ingredients===
A '''salt mouthwash''' is a home treatment for mouth infections and/or injuries, or post extraction, and is made by dissolving a teaspoon of [[Edible salt|salt]] in a cup of warm water.

Recently, the use of herbal mouthwashes such as [[Salvadora persica|persica]] is increasing, due to the perceived discoloration effects and unpleasant taste of chlorhexidine.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Salehi |first1=P. |last2=Momeni Danaie |first2=Sh. |year=2006 |title=Comparison of the antibacterial effects of persica mouthwash with chlorhexidine on streptococcus mutans in orthodontic patients |journal=DARU Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=178–82 |url=http://journals.tums.ac.ir/abs/3015}}</ref> Research has also indicated that [[Oil pulling#Scientific assessment|sesame and sunflower oils]] might be alternatives to chlorhexidine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iadr.confex.com/iadr/2008Toronto/techprogram/abstract_105440.htm |title=Efficacy of Oil Pulling on Oral Health Status |publisher=Iadr.confex.com |date=2008-07-03 |accessdate=2012-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johcd.org/pdf/Effect_of_Oil_Pulling_on_Plaque_and_Gingivitis.pdf |title=JOHCD Jan.pmd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31}}</ref> Other products like [[hydrogen peroxide]] have been tried out as stand-alone<ref name="Hasturk">{{cite journal |pages=57–65 |doi=10.1902/jop.2004.75.1.57 |title=Efficacy of a Fluoridated Hydrogen Peroxide-Based Mouthrinse for the Treatment of Gingivitis: A Randomized Clinical Trial |year=2004 |last1=Hasturk |first1=Hatice |last2=Nunn |first2=Martha |last3=Warbington |first3=Martha |last4=Dyke |first4=Thomas E.

Custom mouthwashes, called "[[magic mouthwash]]" may be prescribed by dentists for post oral surgeries. Variations are common, and some are done with [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] products.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Health risks==
A literature review by Michael McCullough and Camile Farah, published in the ''Australian Dental Journal'' in 2008, focused on a possible connection between mouthwashes that contain alcohol, and an increased risk of oral cancer.
{{quote|There is now sufficient evidence to accept the proposition that developing oral cancer is increased or contributed to by the use of alcohol-containing mouthwashes. Whilst many of these products may have been shown to be effective in penetrating oral microbial biofilms in vitro and reducing oral bacterial load, it would be wise to restrict their use to short-term therapeutic situations if needed. Perhaps the use of mouthwashes that do not contain alcohol may be equally effective. Further, mouthrinses should be prescribed by dentists, like any other medication. There may well be a reason for the use of alcohol-containing mouthrinses, but only for a particular situation and for a limited and controlled period of time. As such, patients should be provided with written instructions for mouthwash use, and mouthwash use should be restricted to adults for short durations and specific, clearly defined reasons. It is the opinion of the authors that, in light of the evidence currently available of the association of alcohol-containing mouthwashes with the development of oral cancer, it would be inadvisable for oral healthcare professionals to recommend the long-term use of alcohol-containing mouthwashes.|McCullough and Farah|''Australian Dental Journal''<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1834-7819.2008.00070.x |title=The role of alcohol in oral carcinogenesis with particular reference to alcohol-containing mouthwashes |year=2008 |last1=McCullough |first1=MJ |last2=Farah |first2=CS |journal=Australian Dental Journal |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=302–5 |pmid=19133944}}</ref>}}
McCullough and Farah also state that the risk of acquiring cancer rises almost five times for users of alcohol-containing mouthwash who neither smoke nor drink (with a higher rate of increase for those who do).<ref>Farah, C; McIntosh, L; McCullough, M (2009).

==Microbiome research and future products==
Research in the field of [[microbiome]]s shows that only a limited set of microbes cause tooth decay, with most of the bacteria in the human mouth being harmless. Focused attention on cavity-causing bacteria such as ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' has led research into new mouthwash treatments that prevent these bacteria from initially growing. While current mouthwash treatments must be used with a degree of frequency to prevent this bacteria from regrowing, future treatments could provide a viable long term solution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2012/02/02/hacking-the-microbiome-for-fun-and-profit-can-killing-just-one-mouth-bacterium-stop-cavities/ |title=Hacking the Microbiome for Fun and Profit: Can Killing Just One Mouth Bacterium Stop Cavities? &#124; 80beats &#124; Discover Magazine |publisher=Blogs.discovermagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31}}</ref>
