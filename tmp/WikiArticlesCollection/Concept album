A '''concept album''' is a studio album where all musical or lyrical ideas contribute to [[narrative|a single overall theme or unified story]].<ref>Shuker, Roy: ''Popular Music: The Key Concepts'', page 5. ISBN 0-415-28425-2. 2002.</ref> In contrast, typical studio albums consist of a number of unconnected songs (lyrically and otherwise) performed by the artist. It has been argued<ref name=Shute>{{cite book|last=Shute|first=Gareth|title=Concept Albums|year=2013|publisher=Investigations Publishing|location=Auckland|page=13|url=}}</ref> that concept albums should only refer to albums that bring in themes or story lines from outside of music, given that a collection of love songs or songs from within a certain genre are not usually considered to be a "concept album."

==History==

===1940s and 1950s===
[[Woody Guthrie]]'s ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]'' (1940) is considered one of the first concept albums, consisting of semi-autobiographical songs about the hardships of American migrant labourers during the 1930s.<ref>{{cite news|title=The return of concept album|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-return-of-concept-album-1796064.html|accessdate=16 November 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=2 October 2009}}</ref>

In the early 1950s, before the advent of rock and roll, concept albums were prevalent in jazz music. Singer [[Frank Sinatra]] recorded several concepts albums, including ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'' (1955; songs about loneliness and heartache) and ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly with Me]]'' (1958; songs about world travel).<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=5Ny7Z1c-4zEC&pg=PA98#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Restless in the promised land |author=Jim Cullen |page=98 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield, 2001 |accessdate=9 April 2011 |isbn= 978-1-58051-093-6 |date= 1 June 2001}}</ref> Singer/pianist [[Nat King Cole]]'s concept albums include ''Everytime I Feel The Spirit'' (1958; gospel and spiritual songs) and ''After Midnight'' (1956; collaborations with jazz instrumentalists in the style of late-night jam sessions).

After finding success with stand-alone singles, country icon [[Johnny Cash]] turned to themed albums, such as ''[[Songs of Our Soil]]'' (1959; songs about death and mortality) and ''[[Blood, Sweat and Tears (album)]]'' (1963; songs about blue-collar workers).

===1960s===
Since ''Colorful Ventures'' (1961), [[The Ventures]] became known for releasing concept albums, including surf music, country, outer space, television themes, and psychedelic music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandcastlevi.com/ventures/venthst.htm |title=The Fabulous Ventures – Band History |publisher=Sandcastle V.I. |date= |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref>

In 1966, several albums were deemed as concept albums by their thematically-linked songs, and became inspiration for other artists to follow. [[The Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' portrayed [[Brian Wilson]]'s state of mind at the time, and was in turn a major inspiration to [[Paul McCartney]]. Album writers Brian Wilson and Tony Asher insist that the narrative was not intended, though Wilson has stated that the idea of the record being a "concept album" is mainly within the way the album was produced and structured.<ref>Laura Tunbridge, The Song Cycle, (Cambridge University Press, 2011), ISBN 0-521-72107-5, p.173.</ref> Later in 1966, Wilson began work on ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'', an intentional narrative, though it was scrapped and later revived in November 2011. ''[[Freak Out!]]'', [[Frank Zappa]] and the [[Mothers of Invention]]'s sardonic farce about rock music and America as a whole, and ''[[Face to Face (The Kinks album)|Face to Face]]'' by [[The Kinks]], the first collection of [[Ray Davies]]'s idiosyncratic character studies of ordinary people, are conceptually oriented albums. However, of the three, only ''Pet Sounds'' attracted a large commercial audience.

[[The Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967) would later bring about the notion of the concept album, with the earlier prototypes and examples from [[traditional pop music]] and other genres sometimes forgotten. Original reception described the album as a concept by select definitions of the term. There was, at some stage during the making of the album an attempt to relate the material to firstly the idea of aging, then as an obscure radio play about the life of an ex-army bandsman and his shortcomings. These concepts were lost in the final production. While debate exists over the extent to which ''Sgt. Pepper'' qualifies as a true concept album, there is no doubt that its reputation as such helped inspire other artists to produce concept albums of their own, and inspired the public to anticipate them. [[John Lennon|Lennon]] and McCartney distanced themselves from the "concept album" tag as applied to that album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6595610/1_sgt_peppers_lonely_hearts_club_band |title=Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: Rolling Stone |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1 November 2003 |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref>

''[[Days of Future Passed]]'', released the same year as ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'', was fellow British musicians [[The Moody Blues]]' first concept album. Originally presented with an opportunity to rock out [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|Symphony No. 9 "From the New World"]] by their new stereophonic label, the band instead forged ahead to unify their own orchestral-based threads of a day in the life of a common man.<ref>{{cite web|last = Eder|first = Bruce|authorlink = |coauthors = |title = The Moody Blues: Biography| work = |publisher = AMG [All Music Group, a subsidiary of Macrovision]| year = 2009|url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4948/biography|pure_url=yes}}| format = |doi = |accessdate =28 July 2009}}</ref>

''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' by [[The Who]] followed with its concept of a [[pirate radio]] broadcast. Within the record, joke commercials recorded by the band and actual [[jingle]]s from recently outlawed pirate radio station [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]] were interspersed between the songs, ranging from pop songs to [[hard rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]], culminating with a mini-opera titled "Rael."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6598681/113_the_who_sell_out |title=113) The Who Sell Out: Rolling Stone |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1 November 2003 |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref>

In October 1967, British psychedelic rock group [[Nirvana (UK band)|Nirvana]] released their debut album, ''[[The Story of Simon Simopath]]'', to moderate commercial success. The songs' lyrics depict the life and death of the titular hero, blending various [[Mythology|mythological themes]], such as the existence of [[centaur]]s and [[goddess]]es, with those of [[science fiction]].

The album ''[[S.F. Sorrow]]'' (released in December 1968) by British group the [[Pretty Things]] is generally considered to be among the first creatively successful rock concept albums – in that each song is part of an overarching unified concept – the life story of the main character, Sebastian Sorrow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/reviews/article/24787/prettythings-sf |title=The Pretty Things: S.F. Sorrow – PopMatters Music Review |publisher=PopMatters |date=6 January 2009 |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref>

Released in April 1969, was the [[rock opera]] ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' composed by [[Pete Townshend]] and performed by The Who. This acclaimed work was presented over [[Double album|two LPs]] and it took the idea of thematically based albums to a much higher appreciation by both critics and the public. It was also the first ''story-based'' concept album of the rock era (as distinct from the ''song-cycle'' style album) to enjoy commercial success. The Who went on to further explorations of the concept album format with their follow-up project ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'', which was abandoned before completion, and with their 1973 rock opera, ''[[Quadrophenia]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004122/Pete-Townshend.html |title=Pete Townshend Biography – Discography, Music, Lyrics, Album, CD, Career, Famous Works, and Awards |publisher=Musicianguide.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref>

Five months after the release of ''Tommy'', [[The Kinks]] released another concept album, ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]]'' (September 1969), written by [[Ray Davies]]; though considered by some a rock opera, it was originally conceived as the score for a proposed but never realised BBC television drama. It was the first of several concept albums released by the band through the first few years of the 1970s. These were: ''[[Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One]]'' (1970), ''[[Muswell Hillbillies]]'' (1971), ''[[Preservation: Act 1]]'' (1973), ''[[Preservation: Act 2]]'' (1974), ''[[Soap Opera (album)|Soap Opera]]'' (1975) and ''[[Schoolboys in Disgrace]]'' (1976).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608001298/Ray-Davies.html |title=Ray Davies Biography – Discography, Music, Lyrics, Album, CD, Career, Famous Works, and Awards |publisher=Musicianguide.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref>

=== 1970s ===

[[Elton John]]'s 1970 album ''[[Tumbleweed Connection]]'' is a concept album based on country and western/Americana themes. ''[[Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy]]'', from 1975, chronologically tells the story of his and lyricist [[Bernie Taupin]]'s meeting to the record their first album, ''[[Empty Sky]]''. Hugely successful, it became the first album to enter the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] at No. 1 (similarly entering at No. 1 on the '' [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' national album chart in Canada).

[[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]]'s 1971 release ''[[Tarkus]]'' reached #1 in the UK Albums Chart with the side long title track condemning the "futility of war."

[[David Bowie]] released two concept albums during the 1970s; 1972's ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars]]'', about the fictional character Ziggy Stardust and his band, and the post-apocalyptic ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' in 1974.

[[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull's]] 1972 studio album, ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'', was crafted as a "bombastic" and "over the top" parody of the ideological concept album, and reached #1 on the Billboard Top 200. Contrary to popular belief, Jethro Tull's previous album, [[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|''Aqualung'']], is not a concept album. (Its supposed concept is an indictment of the church for interfering with man's relationship with God).

[[Pink Floyd]] released 4 concept albums during the 1970s; ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973),'' [[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975), [[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|''Animals'']] (1977), and ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979). The most notable of these is ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', which achieved a level of commercial success far beyond that of any other progressive rock album before or since.

Following the success of ''[[Close to the Edge (Yes album)|Close To The Edge]]'' (1972), [[Yes (band)|Yes]] released ''[[Tales from Topographic Oceans]]'' in 1973. With four movements spread over four sides of a double LP, and the sprawling lyrical and instrumental interpretation of Indian Shastric scriptures, the album pushed as far from the "three-minute pop song" as rock had ever ventured, redefining progressive rock in the process. Its critical backlash, however, would contribute to an eventual decline in the genre's popularity, and to the rise of punk rock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warr.org/yes.html |title=Yes |publisher=Warr.org |date= |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/punkhistory/whendinosaursromaedtheearth.htm |title=History of Punk – Genesis, ELP & Yes |publisher=Punk77.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref> The group's keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] released many concept albums during his solo career, including ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (album)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'', ''[[Journey to the Centre of the Earth (album)|Journey to the Centre of the Earth]]'', ''[[The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table]]'', ''[[1984 (Rick Wakeman album)|1984]]'' and ''[[Return to the Centre of the Earth]]'', and were often accompanied by lavish dramatic stage productions during live performances.

[[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], like [[Yes (band)|Yes]], gradually progressed from moderate-length compositions (around six to eight minutes), to eventually occupying a full side of an LP with the 23 minute [[Supper's Ready]] on their fourth album, ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'' (1972). In 1974, the band released their grandest concept: ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]''. The double album tells the surreal story of a New York City juvenile delinquent named Rael, who is swept underground to face bizarre creatures and nightmarish dangers in order to rescue his brother John.

[[Gentle Giant]] released several concept albums in the 1970s, beginning with ''[[Three Friends]]'' (1972), their first album to achieve chart success in America. ''[[In A Glass House]]'' would follow in 1973, ''[[The Power and the Glory (Gentle Giant album)|The Power and the Glory]]'' in 1974, and ''[[Interview (album)|Interview]]'' in 1976. The band's intricate compositions would lend themselves to concept album hallmarks with theme and texture often recurring throughout an LP to create a cohesive and interrelated whole.

In 1974, [[Electric Light Orchestra]] released ''[[Eldorado (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Eldorado]]''; an orchestral narrative, and the band's first complete concept album. The album charted at #16 in the US and #7 in Canada in 1975.

[[The Alan Parsons Project]] released 4 concept albums during the 1970s; ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Alan Parsons Project album)|Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'' (1976), ''[[I Robot (album)|I Robot]]'' (1977), ''[[Pyramid (The Alan Parsons Project album)|Pyramid]]'' (1978), and ''[[Eve (The Alan Parsons Project album)|Eve]]'' (1979).

In addition to Britain, bands from the European mainland were pushing the limitations of the three-minute song format, regularly requiring two sides of a single LP to complete a statement.

[[Magma (band)|Magma]], from France, debuted in 1970 with an eponymous concept album, ''[[Magma (album)|Magma]]'', about refugees fleeing a doomed Earth to settle on the fictional planet Kobaïa. From Greece, [[Aphrodite's Child]], helmed by keyboardist [[Vangelis]], released ''[[666 (Aphrodite's Child album)|666]]'' in 1972. The double album, based on various passages from [[The Bible]], was controversial for its title and sleeve notes. Italy's [[Banco del Mutuo Soccorso]] released ''[[Darwin!]]'' in 1972, a success that lead to the band to signing with [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]]'s [[Manticore Records]]. [[Triumvirat]], a German progressive rock band signed with [[EMI]] to produce several concept albums including ''[[Mediterranean Tales]]'', ''[[Pompeii (album)|Pompeii]]'' and in 1975, what is considered by many{{Who|date=August 2013}} to be a masterpiece of the genre, ''[[Spartacus (Triumvirat album)|Spartacus]]''.

The Americas also produced their share of concept albums during this period.

From 1975 to 1979, Canadian progressive power trio [[Rush (band)|Rush]] released three albums containing sidelong epics, regarded by some as concept albums (though not actually concept albums by strict definition of the term; that is, none of the other songs on the album have anything to do with each other or the 20-minute sidelong epic, so there is no pervasive concept or story). The first of these was released in 1975, titled ''[[Caress of Steel]]''. The second was their breakthrough album, ''[[2112 (album)|2112]]'', released the following year in 1976. Their third was released in 1978, ''[[Hemispheres (Rush album)|Hemispheres]]''.

[[Kansas (band)|Kansas]] released ''Leftoverture'' in 1976 and '' Monolith'' in 1977.

[[Styx (band)]] began its series of successful concept albums in 1977 with ''[[The Grand Illusion (album)|The Grand Illusion]]'', followed by ''[[Pieces of Eight]]'' in 1978.

Concept albums were hardly the exclusive product of progressive rock bands in the 1970s. From Country to Glam, artists from all genres would embrace the popularity of the LP to explore broader concepts that the 45 would have made impossible.

[[Michael Nesmith]] blossomed creatively after quitting [[The Monkees]], as an originator of what would become [[Country rock]]  and in 1974 released the elaborately packaged concept album ''[[The Prison: A Book with a Soundtrack]]''.

[[Willie Nelson]] is a pioneer of concept albums within country music.<ref>Stimeling, T.D. (2011). "‘Phases and stages, circles and cycles’: Willie Nelson and the concept album". ''Journal of Popular Music, 30''(3),389-408.</ref>  In 1974 he released ''[[Phases and Stages]]'' describing a divorce from the viewpoint of the woman on Side One and the man on Side Two. His 1975 album, ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]'', about the fatal estrangement of a cowboy from his unfaithful wife, followed and would reach #1 on the American country charts.

[[Alice Cooper]] released ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'' in 1975, about the dreams of a disturbed child. 1978's concept ''[[From the Inside (Alice Cooper album)|From the Inside]]'' was based on Cooper's stay in a New York sanitarium.

=== 1980s ===
Though the progressive rock genre had begun to decline in popularity, concept albums were still proving successful for well-established progressive rock bands.

[[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] reinvented themselves as a sleek trio with the release 1980's ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]''. This tale of fame, wealth, success and lost love was the band's first full LP concept since 1974's ''The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway''. It was a huge commercial success and begun a new, pop-oriented era for the band. "[[Turn It On Again]]" and "[[Misunderstanding (Genesis song)|Misunderstanding]]", both became top 20 hits.

Inspired by ''[[The Wall]]'', glam rock band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] recruited Lou Reed for lyrical assistance and released ''[[Music from "The Elder"]]'' in 1981. Due to the album's radical departure in musical style compared to Kiss's previous offerings, ''Music From "The Elder"'' became the group's poorest selling and charting album in their history. It has, however, grown in cult status since its release.

[[Roger Waters]] of [[Pink Floyd]] continued his use of the concept album format with his 1980's solo albums ''[[The Pros And Cons Of Hitch Hiking]]'' and ''[[Radio K.A.O.S.]]''.

[[Bruce Springsteen]]'s 1987 album, ''[[Tunnel of Love (Bruce Springsteen song)|Tunnel of Love]]'', is unified under the concept of love and the struggles of love. Written at a time where he was going through a divorce, ''Tunnel of Love'' is considered to be one of his best and most lyrically sound albums.

Singer-songwriter [[Kim Carnes]] and her husband David Ellingson wrote and produced [[Kenny Rogers]]'s 1980 album ''[[Gideon (album)|Gideon]]'', which was based on the theme of a Texas cowboy.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgxI_J5e6k "Don't Fall In Love With A Dreamer"], [[Kim Carnes]] performs live in Santiago, [[Chile]]. Retrieved 15 August 2012.</ref>

In 1985, the British [[neo-progressive rock]] band [[Marillion]] achieved their only [[List of UK Albums Chart number ones of the 1980s|UK Number One album]] – and the best-selling album of their career – with ''[[Misplaced Childhood]]'', a concept album featuring lyrics by frontman [[Fish (singer)|Fish]] which were partly autobiographical. The album was played as two continuous pieces of music on the two sides of the vinyl and produced the band's two biggest hit singles, "[[Kayleigh]]" and "[[Lavender (Marillion song)|Lavender]]".

[[Styx (band)|Styx]] continued to have multiplatinum albums with their 1981 release ''[[Paradise Theater (album)|Paradise Theater]]'' (a concept album about a decaying theater in Chicago which became a metaphor for childhood and American culture) and 1983's ''[[Kilroy Was Here (album)|Kilroy Was Here]]'' (a science fiction rock opera about a future where moralists imprison rockers).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/features/article/8636/concept-albums-are-once-again-in-vogue-in-the-digital-age/ |title=Music Feature &#124; Concept Albums Are Once Again in Vogue in the Digital Age |publisher=PopMatters |date= |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref> The elaborate concept would produce the bands last top ten hit in the U.S. with  "Mr. Roboto", but arguments over the direction of the band toward increasingly dramatic concept productions led to breakup in 1984.

The British group [[A Flock of Seagulls]], released their self-titled concept album based on an alien invasion.

French [[Euro disco]] singer [[Amanda Lear]] released the concept album ''[[Incognito (Amanda Lear album)|Incognito]]'' in 1981. The nine track album was based on the Christian classification of vices, the [[seven deadly sins]], with Lear adding two vices of her own: bureaucracy and nostalgia.

Members of the British [[alternative comedy]] group [[The Comic Strip]] have released concept albums. In 1984, [[Alexei Sayle]] released ''[[The Fish People Tapes]]'', an episodic serial based on his [[Capital FM]] series ''Alexei Sayle and the Fish People''. The same year, [[Nigel Planer]], in character as hippy Neil Pye, his character on ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'', released ''[[Neil's Heavy Concept Album]]'', a parody of late 1960s psychedelic concept albums.

[[Queensrÿche]] fared better later the decade, releasing the rock opera  ''[[Operation: Mindcrime]]'' in 1988, which tells a story of a young man, Nikki, awoken from a coma suddenly remembering work done as a political assassin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/columns/begrand/060316.shtml |title=Columns &#124; Adrien Begrand &#124; Blood and Thunder &#124; The Queen Isn't Dead |publisher=PopMatters |date=16 March 2006 |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref> The comedy group [[Buckner & Garcia]] released a novelty concept album, ''[[Pac-Man Fever (album)|Pac-Man Fever]]'', that went gold and produced a hit single of the same name; all of the songs on the album pertained to popular video games of the time.

The [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]] gained cult status during the 1980s releasing mostly all concept albums. Releases such as ''[[Abigail (album)|Abigail]]'', ''[[Them (King Diamond album)|"Them,"]]'' and ''[[The Eye (King Diamond album)|The Eye]]'' told elaborate sagas of horror and the [[supernatural]].

In 1985 Kerrang! magazine ran a coverstory on [[Phenomena (band)|Phenomena]],<ref>[http://www.projectphenomena.com Welcome to Phenomena<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> announcing "the return of the concept album". Tom Galley had started the project, and together with his brother Mell and Metalhammer magazine founder Wilfried Rimensberger developed it into an international multi-media rock music project with contributions from a string of rock superstars, that, apart from so far a total of 5 albums, produced the Dreamrunner album and an ongoing following around the world. Phenomena's main story lines are dealing with the supernatural and unexplained, that were also turned in to scripts for musical, rock opera stage productions, feature films and video games. [[Iron Maiden]] also released ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]'', which follows the folklore and myths of a seventh son of a seventh son having mystical powers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maidenfans.com/imc/?url=album07_ssoass/commentary07_ssoass&link=albums&lang=eng |title=The Iron Maiden Commentary |publisher=Maidenfans.com |date=11 April 1988 |accessdate=18 January 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

[[The Stranglers]] released two concept albums in 1981: in February, ''[[The Gospel According to the Meninblack|The gospel according to the Meninblack]]'' which deals with the Men in black and their link to religion and at the end of the year, ''[[La Folie (album)|La folie]]'' which explores all the facets of love.<ref>Buckley, David (1997) : "No mercy" (biography of the Stranglers). Coronet books.</ref>

[[Bolland & Bolland]] released ''The Domino Theory'' in 1981, a concept album critically covering war and US intervention politics, spinning off the minor hit single [[In the Army Now (song)|''In the Army Now'']] which was subsequently successfully covered by other artists such as [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]].

===1990s===
In the 1990s prog rock had all but faded from popular music. With the advent of [[alternative rock]], however, a number of artists still continued to use the format.

[[Roger Waters]] returned once again to the concept album format for his third solo album, ''[[Amused to Death]]'' in 1992. On this he explores the influence of television and the mass media featuring [[Jeff Beck]] on lead guitar. A segment of the album,  "[[What God Wants, Part 1]]" would reach #4 in the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] released ''[[The Sisters EP]]'', in which the first two tracks of the four have a linking narrative surrounding two sisters.

In this decade, the rock band [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] created three [[rock opera]] concept albums, namely ''[[Antichrist Superstar]]'' (1996), ''[[Mechanical Animals]]'' (1998) and ''[[Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)|Holy Wood]]'' (2000), which formed an ambitious concept trilogy. Though each one came with individual conceptual backgrounds, they are also meant to be taken together to form a larger abstract storyline. The albums were released in reverse order thus in the larger overarching 'fourth storyline' is divulged in reverse chronological order.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Tom|last=Lanham |date=2000-11 |title=Marilyn Manson: Absinthe Makes The Heart Grow Fonder |trans_title= |journal=[[Alternative Press]] |issue=#148 |pages=76‐86 |publisher=Alternative Press Magazine, Inc. |accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Basham |first=David |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431695/19991216/marilyn_manson.jhtml|title= Manson To Walk in The "Valley of Death" For Next LP |work=MTV News |publisher=MTV Networks (Viacom) |date= 16 December 1999|accessdate=17 November 2010}}</ref><ref name="MTV Marilyn Manson Tweaks Holy Wood Plans">{{cite web|last=Basham |first=David |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431690/marilyn-manson-tweaks-holy-wood-plans.jhtml |title=Marilyn Manson Tweaks "Holy Wood" Plans |work=MTV News |publisher=MTV Networks (Viacom) |date=29 February 2000|accessdate=22 March 2011}}</ref>

In 1994, industrial metal band [[Nine Inch Nails]] released ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' which focuses on a life going in a downward spiral.<ref>[http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/3312/Nine-Inch-Nails-The-Downward-Spiral/ Nine Inch Nails – The Downward Spiral (album review) | Sputnikmusic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1996, [[Meat Loaf]] released ''[[Welcome to the Neighborhood]]'', a concept album that tells the story of a relationship. Heavy metal band [[Iced Earth]], released their 1996 album [[The Dark Saga]] which is based upon the comic book character [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]], created by [[Todd McFarlane]]. Alternative metal band [[Fear Factory]], released several concept albums in the 90s. Also, in 1994 Charly García recorded "La hija de la Lágrima". He was the first musician in Argentina to record a concept album.

In 1995, [[RZA]] and his various Wu solo projects took on concept form. In his work on [[Raekwon]]'s [[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]], featuring [[Ghostface Killah]], RZA orchestrated something of a hiphop opus reliving the tales of Mafioso, street hustlers rhyming and gaming their way to the top. The album sparked further impressions of others on the New York rap scene at the time. Though tracks had been done as concept, the mix of sampling films, rap, and street life were combined in this particular Wu solo effort.

In 1999, progressive metal band [[Dream Theater]] released ''[[Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory]]'', a story concept album. This was a specific follow-up to a song called "Metropolis Pt. 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper", which was released on the band's 1992 breakthrough album, ''[[Images and Words]]'', and is followed by the 2002 album "[[Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence]]". While "Pt. 1" introduced a story, further parts of the "Metropolis" story were unseen on that album or subsequent releases for seven years. Although the band had created a twenty-minute follow-up to Part 1 in the mid-nineties, it hadn't been released. After the band gained complete creative control from their record company, they decided to expand their follow-up of the Metropolis story into a full album: ''Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory''. This album builds on concepts introduced in "Part 1", both lyrically and musically. Although it did not achieve the same levels of commercial success as the band's later releases (it reached #73 on the [[Billboard 200]]), it has been hailed by many fans and critics as Dream Theater's masterpiece and the band's defining album.
