'''Adobe Systems, Inc.''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|d|oʊ|b|iː}} {{Respell|ə|DOH|bee}}), is an American [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] computer software company headquartered in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California, United States. The company has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more-recent foray towards [[rich Internet application]] [[software development]].

Adobe was founded in December 1982<ref name="fastfacts"/> by [[John Warnock]] and [[Charles Geschke]], who established the company after leaving [[Xerox PARC]] in order to develop and sell the [[PostScript]] [[page description language]]. In 1985, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] licensed PostScript for use in its [[LaserWriter]] [[computer printer|printers]], which helped spark the [[desktop publishing]] revolution. The company name ''Adobe'' comes from [[Adobe Creek (near Los Altos)|Adobe Creek]] in [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]], California, which ran behind the houses of both of the company's founders.<ref name="fastfacts"/> Adobe acquired its former competitor, [[Macromedia]], in December 2005, which added newer software products and platforms such as [[Adobe ColdFusion|ColdFusion]], [[Adobe Dreamweaver|Dreamweaver]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] and [[Adobe Flex|Flex]] to its product portfolio.

As of 2010, Adobe Systems has 9,117 employees,<ref name="fastfacts">{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pdfs/fastfacts.pdf | title = Adobe Fast Facts|date=March 9, 2009|accessdate=April 4, 2009|format=PDF| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090326033602/http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pdfs/fastfacts.pdf| archivedate= 26 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], Massachusetts; [[New York City, New York|New York City]], New York; [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida; [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota; [[Lehi, Utah|Lehi]], Utah; [[Seattle]], Washington; [[San Francisco]] and [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]], California in the United States; [[Ottawa]], Canada; [[Hamburg]], Germany; [[Noida]] and [[Bangalore]], India; [[Bucharest]], Romania; [[Basel]], Switzerland; and [[Beijing]], China.

==History==
[[File:Adobe HQ.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Adobe Systems headquarters complex|Adobe Systems headquarters]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California, U.S.]]
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Main_building_3.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Adobe R&D Centre in Noida, India.]] -->
Adobe's corporate logo, featuring the stylized "A", was designed by Marva Warnock, wife of John Warnock, who is also a graphic designer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famouslogos.net/adobe-logo/|title=Adobe Logo: Design and History| publisher=Famouslogos.net|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}</ref>

Adobe's first products after [[PostScript]] were [[digital font]]s, which they released in a proprietary format called [[Type 1 font|Type 1]]. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] subsequently developed a competing standard, [[TrueType]], which provided full scalability and precise control of the [[pixel]] pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to [[Microsoft]]. Adobe responded by publishing the Type 1 specification and releasing [[Adobe Type Manager]], software that allowed [[WYSIWYG]] scaling of Type 1 fonts on screen, like TrueType, although without the precise pixel-level control. But these moves were too late to stop the rise of TrueType. Although Type 1 remained the standard in the graphics/publishing market, TrueType became the standard for business and the average Windows user. In 1996, Adobe and Microsoft announced the [[OpenType]] font format, and in 2003 Adobe completed converting its Type 1 font library to OpenType.

In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer [[Computer software|software]] market with [[Adobe Illustrator]], a [[vector graphics|vector]]-based drawing program for the [[Apple Macintosh]]. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers. Unlike [[MacDraw]], the then standard Macintosh vector drawing program, Illustrator described shapes with more flexible [[Bézier curve]]s, providing unprecedented accuracy. Font rendering in Illustrator, however, was left to the Macintosh's [[QuickDraw]] libraries and would not be superseded by a PostScript-like approach until Adobe released Adobe Type Manager.

In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its [[flagship]] product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.<ref name="siliconuser">{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconuser.com/?q=node/10|title= How Adobe's Photoshop Was Born|accessdate=June 12, 2007|last=Hormby|first=Thomas|publisher=[[SiliconUser]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070611134528/http://siliconuser.com/?q=node/10| archivedate= 11 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 1993, Adobe introduced [[PDF]], the Portable Document Format, and its [[Adobe acrobat|Adobe Acrobat and Reader]] software. PDF is now an International Standard: [[PDF|ISO 32000-1:2008]]. The technology is adopted worldwide as a common medium for electronic documents.

Arguably, one of Adobe's few missteps on the Macintosh platform was their failure to develop their own [[desktop publishing]] (DTP) program. Instead, [[Aldus]] with [[Adobe PageMaker|PageMaker]] in 1985 and [[Quark, Inc.|Quark]] with [[QuarkXPress]] in 1987 gained early leads in the DTP market. Adobe was also slow to address the emerging [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] DTP market. However, Adobe made great strides in that market with the release of [[Adobe InDesign|InDesign]] and its bundled [[Adobe Creative Suite|Creative Suite]] offering. In a failure to predict the direction of computing, Adobe released a complete version of Illustrator for [[Steve Jobs]]' ill-fated [[NeXT]] system, but a poorly produced version for Windows.

Despite these missteps, licensing fees from the PostScript interpreter allowed Adobe to outlast or acquire many of its rivals in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded to [[Adobe Premiere Pro]] in 2003.  In 1994, Adobe acquired Aldus and added [[Adobe PageMaker]] and [[Adobe After Effects]] to its product line later in the year; it also controls the [[TIFF]] file format. In 1995, Adobe added [[Adobe FrameMaker]], the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added [[Ares]] Software Corp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18422328.html |title= Adobe gets font technology. (Adobe Systems Inc. acquires Ares Software Corp.)  |date=June 3, 1996 |accessdate=Jul 12, 2013}}</ref> In 1999, Adobe introduced [[Adobe InCopy]] as a direct competitor to QuarkCopyDesk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/199910/19991011InCopy.html|title=About Adobe – Press Room – For Immediate Release|publisher=Adobe|accessdate=November 9, 2010}}</ref>

==Criticism==

===Pricing===
Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39497760,00.htm?r=1|title=Adobe responds to CS4 pricing criticism}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.builderau.com.au/news/soa/Adobe-defends-CS4-pricing/0,339028227,339292472,00.htm|title=Adobe defends CS4 pricing}}</ref> with retail prices being as much as twice as high in non-US countries as in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creativepro.com/article/creative-suite-pricing-varies-throughout-world|title=Adobe responds to customer protests against perceived unfair pricing.}}</ref> As pointed out by many, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.<ref>[http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2013/02/dont-believe-the-adobe-price-cut-hype-its-still-gauging-you-silly/ Don’t Believe The Adobe Price Cut Hype, It’s Still Gouging You Silly], Gizmodo</ref><ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/adobe-has-its-head-in-the-clouds-over-pricing-20130215-2ehat.html Adobe has its head in the clouds over pricing], The Age - Technology</ref>

After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,<ref>[http://www.zdnet.com/uk-will-pay-1000-more-for-adobe-cs3-3039286561/ UK will pay £1,000 more for Adobe CS3 | ZDNet]</ref> a petition to protest over "unfair pricing" was published and signed by 10,000 users.<ref>[http://photo.net/photography-news-forum/00LDbS 10,000 sign Adobe CS3 European pricing petition | Photo.net]</ref> In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/254173/adobe-hikes-uk-prices-by-10.html|title=Adobe hikes UK prices by 10% &#124; News|publisher=PC Pro|date=June 1, 2009|accessdate=May 29, 2010}}</ref> and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jun/04/adobe-software Adobe widens the price gap | The Guardian]</ref>

In 2011, after the company announced that it will only allow owners of the most recent versions of [[Creative Suite]] to upgrade to new versions, [[Scott Kelby]], The President of The [[National Association of Photoshop Professionals]], wrote an open letter to Adobe requesting it re-thinks its product upgrade policy.<ref>[http://www.dpreview.com/news/2011/11/22/AdobeUpgradeCriticism Adobe faces criticism for change of upgrade policy | Digital Photography Review]</ref><ref>[http://scottkelby.com/2011/an-open-letter-to-adobe-systems/ An Open Letter To Adobe Systems | Scott Kelby's Photoshop Insider]</ref>

===Customer service===
The company has been criticized by users for bad customer service.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it-old/adobe-delays-anger-users/story-e6frgamo-1225765761841 Adobe delays anger users | The Australian]</ref> In August 2009 Adobe apologized on their main support web page for poor customer service.<ref>[http://www.creativepro.com/article/adobe-apologizes-world-poor-customer-service, Adobe Apologizes to World for Poor Customer Service | CreativePro]</ref><ref>[http://www.macworld.co.uk/mac-creative/news/?newsid=27049 Adobe repairing broken customer services | MacWorld UK]</ref>

===Security===
For years hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/08/technology/security/adobe-security/ Adobe has an epically abysmal security record - CNNMoney]</ref> Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see [[Flash player#Criticism|criticism of Flash Player]]). A report by security researchers from [[Kaspersky Lab]] criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.<ref>[http://windowsitpro.com/blog/adobe-fares-poorly-kaspersky-lab-security-report Adobe Fares Poorly in Kaspersky Lab Security Report | WindowsITPro]</ref>

Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including [[spyware]] in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named [[Omniture]].<ref>[http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20071228/020818.shtml Adobe Spying On Its Customers | Techdirt]</ref> When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they "could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account".<ref>[http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2007/12/adobe_ate_me_baby.html John Nack on Adobe: Adobe ate me baby!!]</ref> When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade.<ref>[http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/adobe-creative-suite-patch-backtrac-77760 Adobe Backtracks On Patching ‘PR Disaster’ | TechWeekEurope]</ref> Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.<ref>[http://blogs.csoonline.com/data-protection/2178/was-stupid-adobe That was stupid, Adobe | CSO Blogs]</ref>

===Marketing ethics===
Adobe has been criticized for pushing [[foistware]] - third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] update process,<ref>[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/adobe-and-skype-top-my-foistware-hall-of-shame/3195 Adobe and Skype top my Foistware Hall of Shame | ZDNet]</ref> and for pushing a third-party [[scareware]] program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.<ref>[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/adobes-latest-critical-security-update-pushes-scareware/4681 Adobe's latest critical security update pushes scareware | ZDNet]</ref>

===Criticism of Creative Cloud===
{{main|Adobe Creative Cloud}}
Adobe has caused concerns within the photography and filmmaking community, especially long term users.<ref>[http://castroller.com/podcasts/LensworkPhotography/3569325 The Real Lesson in the Adobe Announcement | Lenswork Daily]</ref><ref>[http://www.graphics.com/modules.php?name=Sections&op=viewarticle&artid=1047 The Creative Cloud Chronicles: Adobe is Not Microsoft | Graphics.com]</ref> In May 2013, Adobe Systems announced plans to end perpetual software licensing for its [[Adobe Creative Suite|Creative Suite]] products in favor of a subscription-based service model called Creative Cloud, which had been introduced as an alternative licensing model in May 2012.

Shifting to a [[software as a service]] model, Adobe announced more frequent feature updates to its products and the eschewing of their traditional [[release cycle]]s.<ref>Summers, Nick. (2013-05-06) [http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/05/06/after-nearly-10-years-adobe-abandons-its-creative-suite-entirely-to-focus-on-creative-cloud/ Adobe Abandons Its Creative Suite to Focus on Creative Cloud].
