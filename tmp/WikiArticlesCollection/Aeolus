'''Aeolus'''<ref>Chaucer's ''Eolus'' ([http://www.columbia.edu/dlc/garland/deweever/E/eolus.htm de Weever, Jacqueline (1996).  ''Chaucer Name Dictionary'', ''s.v.'' "Eolus". (Garland Publishing)] Retrieved on 2009-10-06</ref> ({{IPAc-en|iː|ˈ|oʊ|l|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc|Αἴολος}}, ''Aiolos'' {{IPA-el|ajolos|}}, [[Greek language|Modern Greek]]: {{IPA-el|ˈe.olos||Ell-Aiolos.ogg}}), a name shared by three mythic characters, was the ruler of the winds in [[Greek mythology]]. These three personages are often difficult to tell apart, and even the ancient mythographers appear to have been perplexed about which Aeolus was which. [[Diodorus Siculus]] made an attempt to define each of these three (although it is clear he also became muddled), and his opinion is followed here.<ref name="dgrbm">{{Citation

But instead his men thought it was filled with riches, so they opened it which is why the journey was extended. All three men named Aeolus appear to be connected genealogically, although the precise relationship, especially regarding the second and third Aeolus, is often ambiguous.

==Son of Hellen==
This Aeolus was son of [[Hellen]] and the [[nymph]] [[Orseis]], and a brother of [[Dorus]], [[Xuthus]] and, in some sources, of [[Amphictyon]] (who is otherwise a brother of Hellen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0158.html|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology|last=Smith|first=William|authorlink=William Smith (lexicographer)|publisher=The Ancient Library|accessdate=March 14, 2013}}</ref> Described as the ruler of [[Thessaly|Aeolia]] (later called [[Thessaly]]) and held to be the founder of the [[Aeolic]] branch of the Greek nation, this Aeolus married [[Enarete]], daughter of Deimachus (otherwise unknown). Aeolus and Enarete had many children, although the precise number and identities of these children vary from author to author in the ancient sources.<ref>''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' i. 7. §3; Scholium on Pindar's ''Pythian Ode'' iv. 190. In the Hesiodic ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'' (fr. 10(a)), his children are: Cretheus, Athamas, Sisyphus, Salmoneus, Deioneus, Perieres, Peisidice, Alcyone, Calyce, Canace and Perimede; one other son's name, perhaps Magnes, is lost in a [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacuna]].</ref> The great extent of country which this race occupied, and the desire of each part of it to trace its origin to some descendant of Aeolus, probably gave rise to the varying accounts about the number of his children. Some scholars contend that the most ancient and genuine story told of only four sons of Aeolus: [[Sisyphus]], [[Athamas]], [[Cretheus]], and [[Salmoneus]], as the representatives of the four main branches of the Aeolic race.<ref name="dgrbm"/> Other sons included [[Deioneus]], [[Perieres]], Cercaphas and perhaps [[Magnes (mythology)|Magnes]] (usually regarded as a brother of [[Makednos|Macedon]]) and [[Aethlius]]. Another son is named Mimas, who provides a link to the third Aeolus in a genealogy that seems very contrived. [[Calyce (mythology)|Calyce]], [[Pisidice|Peisidice]], [[Perimede (mythology)|Perimede]] and [[Alcyone]] were counted among the daughters of Aeolus and [[Enarete]].<ref>[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022&layout=&loc=1.7.3 i. 7. ~ 3])</ref> This Aeolus also had an illegitimate daughter named [[Arne (mythology)|Arne]], begotten on [[Melanippe]], daughter of the Centaur [[Cheiron]]. This Arne became the mother of the second Aeolus, by the god [[Poseidon]].

==Son of Poseidon==
[[File:Yakovlev Eoles.jpg|145px|left|thumb|''Aeolus'' by [[Alexandre Jacovleff]] shows Aeolus as an embodiment of [[Wind]] himself.]]

This Aeolus was a son of Poseidon by [[Arne (mythology)|Arne]], daughter of Aeolus. He had a twin brother named [[Boeotus]]. Arne confessed to her father that she was with child by the god Poseidon; her father, however, did not believe her, and handed her over to a man named Metapontus, King of [[Icaria]]. When Bœotus and Aeolus were born, they were raised by Metapontus; but their stepmother (Autolyte, wife of Metapontus) quarrelled with their mother Arne, prompting Bœotus and Aeolus to kill Autolyte and flee from Icaria. Bœotus (accompanied by Arne) went to southern Thessaly, and founded [[Boeotia]]; but Aeolus went to a group of islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea, which received from him the name of the [[Aeolian Islands]]; according to some accounts this Aeolus founded the town of [[Lipara]]. Although his home has been traditionally identified as one of the Aeolian Islands (there is little consensus as to which), near [[Sicily]], an alternative location has been suggested at Gramvousa off the northwest coast of [[Crete]]. Aeolus had six sons and six daughters, whom in Homer he wed to one another and the family lived happily together. Later writers were shocked by the [[incest]]: in [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]],<ref>[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]]. ''Fabulae'', 238, 242.</ref> the day Aeolus learned that one of his sons, [[Macareus (son of Aeolus)|Macareus]], had committed incest with his sister [[Canace]] he expelled Macareus and threw the child born of this incestuous union to the dogs,<ref>[[Ovid]]. ''[[Heroides]]'', 11.</ref> and sent his daughter a sword by which she was to kill herself.<ref>[[Pseudo-Plutarch]]. ''Parallel Lives'', 28</ref> Other late accounts claim that Macareus had a daughter named [[Amphissa (mythology)|Amphissa]], beloved by [[Apollo]].

==Son of Hippotes==
This Aeolus is most frequently [[conflated]] with Aeolus, the son of [[Poseidon]], god of the sea. It is difficult to differentiate this Aeolus from the second Aeolus, as their identities seem to have been merged by many ancient writers. The father of this third Aeolus is given as [[Hippotes]], son of [[Mimas (Aeneid)|Mimas]], a son of the first Aeolus (son of Hellen). According to some accounts, Hippotes married the same [[Melanippe]] who was the mother of [[Arne (mythology)|Arne]].<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library of History'' 4. 67. 3 (trans. Oldfather)</ref> This Aeolus lived on the floating island of [[Aeolia (floating island)|Aeolia]] and was visited by [[Odysseus]] and his crew in the ''[[Odyssey]].'' He gave hospitality for a month and provided for a west wind to carry them home. He also provided a gift of a bag containing all winds but the west, which Odysseus's crew members unwittingly opened just before they were to reach Ithaca. Unfortunately, they were blown back to Aeolia, where Aeolus refused to provide any further help,<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' x, 2</ref> because he believed that their short and unsuccessful voyage meant that the gods did not favour them. This Aeolus was perceived by post-Homeric authors as a god, rather than as a mortal and simple Keeper of the Winds (as in the ''Odyssey''). 

Like the previous, this Aeolus was said to have had twelve children - six sons and six daughters. According to Diodorus, he was father of six sons by Cyane, daughter of Liparus (the eponym of the island [[Lipara]], whom Aeolus assisted in conquering lands above [[Surrentum]], Italy). The sons' names were Agathyrnus, Astyochus, Androcles, Iocastus, Pheraemon, Xuthus, whereas the daughters are not mentioned at all. The sons were said to have become kings: Iocastus of the region in southern Italy as far as [[Rhegium]]; Pheraemon and Androcles of the part of Sicily between the [[Strait of Messina]] and [[Lilybaeum]]; Xuthus of [[Leontini]]; Agathyrnus of what was known as Agathyrnitis, having founded [[Agathyrnum]]; and Astyochus of Lipara. All were said to have been remembered as just and pious rulers.<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library of History,'' 4. 7. 6 - 8. 3</ref> Another list of Aeolus' children is found in [[scholia]] on the ''[[Odyssey]]''.<ref>Scholia on ''Odyssey'', 10. 6</ref> The latter source gives the sons' names as Androcles, Chrysippus, Iocastus, Phalacrus, Pheraemon, Xuthus, and the daughters' as Aeole, Astycrateia, Dia, Hephaestia, Iphthe, Periboea; their mother in this account is Telepora or Telepatra, daughter of Laestrygon.

[[Parthenius of Nicaea]]<ref>''Love Romances'', 2</ref> recorded a love affair between Odysseus and Aeolus' daughter [[Polymele]]; the latter was said to have ended up betrothed to her own brother Diores. 

In the ''[[Aeneid]]'' by [[Virgil]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] offers Aeolus the [[nymph]] [[Deiopea (Cyrenid)|Deiopea]] as a wife if he will release his winds upon the fleet of [[Aeneas]].<ref>[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 71-75</ref>
