'''Business statistics''' is the science of good decision making in the face of uncertainty and is used in many disciplines such as [[financial analysis]], [[econometrics]], [[auditing]], production and operations including services improvement, and marketing research.<ref>•

These sources feature regular repetitive publication of series of data. This makes the topic of [[time series]] especially important for business statistics. It is also a branch of [[applied statistics]] working mostly on data collected as a by-product of doing business or by government agencies. It provides knowledge and skills to interpret and use statistical techniques in a variety of business applications. A typical business statistics course is intended for business majors, and 
covers statistical study, descriptive statistics (collection, description, analysis, and summary of data), probability, and the binomial and [[normal distribution]]s, test of hypotheses and confidence intervals, [[linear regression]], and correlation.<ref>• E. Pekoz,
