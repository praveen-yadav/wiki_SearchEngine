A '''cairn''' is a man-made pile (or stack) of stones. The word ''cairn'' comes from the {{lang-gd|càrn}} (plural {{lang|gd|''càirn''}}).{{CN|date=October 2013}} Cairns are found all over the world in [[Upland (geology)|uplands]], on [[moorland]], on [[Summit (topography)|mountaintops]], near [[waterway]]s and on sea cliffs, and also in barren [[desert]] and [[tundra]] areas. They vary in size from small stone markers to entire artificial hills, and in complexity from loose, conical rock piles to delicately balanced sculptures and elaborate feats of [[megalith]]ic engineering. Cairns may be painted or otherwise decorated, e.g. for increased visibility or for religious reasons.

In modern times, cairns are often erected as [[landmark]]s, a use they have had since ancient times. Since [[prehistory]], they have also been built as [[Sepulchre|sepulchral]] monuments, or used for defensive, hunting, ceremonial, astronomical and other purposes.

==Modern cairns==
[[File:Lion's Head snow.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Line of cairns used to mark the way above the treeline on [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington, New Hampshire]], [[United States|USA]].]]
Today, cairns are built for many purposes.  The most common use in [[North America]] and [[Northern Europe]] is to mark [[mountain bike]] and [[hiking trail]]s and other cross-country [[trail blazing]], especially in mountain regions at or above the [[tree line]]. For example, the extensive trail network maintained by the DNT, the [[Norwegian Trekking Association]], extensively uses cairns in conjunction with T-painted rock faces to mark trails.  Other examples of these can be seen in the lava fields of [[Volcanoes National Park]] in [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] to mark several hikes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/hike_bc.htm |title=Backcountry Hikes - Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref> Placed at regular intervals, a series of cairns can be used to indicate a path across stony or barren terrain, even across [[glacier]]s. Such cairns are often placed at junctions or in places where the trail direction is not obvious, and may also be used to indicate an obscured danger, such as a sudden drop, or a noteworthy point such as the summit of a mountain.  Most trail cairns are small, a foot or less in height, but may be built taller so as to protrude through a layer of snow. Hikers passing by often add a stone, as a small bit of maintenance to counteract the erosive effects of severe weather. North American trail marks are sometimes called "ducks" or "duckies", because they sometimes have a "beak" pointing in the direction of the route. The expression "two rocks do not make a duck" reminds hikers that just one rock resting upon another could be the result of accident or nature rather than intentional trail marking.

The building of cairns for recreational purposes along trails, to mark one's personal passage through the area, can result in an overabundance of rock piles.  This distracts from cairns used as genuine navigational guides, and also conflicts with the Leave No Trace Ethic.  This ethic of outdoor practice advocates for leaving the outdoors undisturbed and in its natural condition.

Coastal cairns, or "sea marks", are also common in the northern latitudes, especially in the island-strewn waters of [[Scandinavia]] and eastern [[Canada]]. Often indicated on navigation charts, they may be painted white or lit as beacons for greater visibility offshore.

[[File:Isandlwanamassgrave.JPG|left|thumb|200px|One of many cairns marking British mass graves at the site of the [[Battle of Isandlwana]], [[South Africa]].]]Modern cairns may also be erected for historical or memorial commemoration or simply for decorative or artistic reasons.  One example is a series of many cairns marking [[United Kingdom|British]] soldiers' [[mass graves]] at the site of the [[Battle of Isandlwana]], [[South Africa]]. Another is the [[Matthew Flinders]] Cairn on the side of [[Arthur's Seat, Victoria|Arthur's Seat]], a small mountain on the shores of [[Port Phillip Bay]], [[Australia]]. A large cairn, commonly referred to as "the igloo" by the locals, was built atop a hill next to the [[I-476]] highway in [[Radnor, Pennsylvania]] and is a part of a series of large rock sculptures initiated in 1988 to symbolize the township's [[Wales|Welsh]] heritage and to beautify the visual imagery along the highway.<ref>[http://www.radnor.com/department/division.asp?fDD=9-108 Radnor Township website], Gateway Enhancement Strategy.</ref> Some are merely places where farmers have collected stones removed from a field. These can be seen in the [[Catskill Mountains]], [[North America]] where there is a strong Scottish heritage, and may also represent places where livestock were lost. In locales exhibiting fantastic rock formations, such as the [[Grand Canyon]], tourists often construct simple cairns in reverence of the larger counterparts.<ref>File:Http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cairns at Grand Canyon North Rim 2013.jpg file</ref> By contrast, cairns may have a strong aesthetic purpose, for example in the art of [[Andy Goldsworthy]].

==History==

===Europe===
The building of cairns for various purposes goes back into [[prehistory]] in Eurasia, ranging in size from small rock sculptures to substantial man-made hills of stone (some built on top of larger, natural hills). The latter are often relatively massive [[Bronze Age]] or earlier structures which, like kistvaens and [[dolmens]], frequently contain burials; they are comparable to [[Tumulus|tumuli]] ([[kurgan]]s), but of stone construction instead of [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]. ''Cairn'' originally could more broadly refer to various types of hills and natural stone piles, but today is used exclusively of artificial ones.

The word ''cairn'' derives from [[Scots language|Scots]] ''{{lang|gd|cairn}}'' (with the same meaning), in turn from [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''{{lang|gd|càrn}}'', which is essentially the same as the corresponding words in other native [[Celtic language]]s of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]], including [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''{{lang|cy|carn}}'' (and ''{{lang|cy|carnedd}}''), [[Irish language|Irish]] ''{{lang|ga|carn}}'', and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''{{lang|kw|karn}}'' or ''{{lang|kw|carn}}''.  Cornwall (''{{lang|kw|Kernow}}'') itself may actually be named after the cairns that dot its landscape, such as Cornwall's highest point, [[Brown Willy Cairns|Brown Willy Summit Cairn]], a 5&nbsp;m (16&nbsp;ft) high and 24&nbsp;m (79&nbsp;ft) diameter mound atop [[Brown Willy]] hill in [[Bodmin Moor]], an area with many ancient cairns.  Burial cairns and other [[megaliths]] are the subject of a variety of legends and folklore throughout Britain and Ireland. In [[Scotland]], it is traditional to carry a stone up from the bottom of a hill to place on a cairn at its top. In such a fashion, cairns would grow ever larger. An old Scottish Gaelic blessing is ''{{lang|gd|Cuiridh mi clach air do chàrn}}'', "I'll put a stone on your cairn".  In Highland folklore it is believed that the Highland Clans, before they fought in a battle, each man would place a stone in a pile. Those who survived the battle returned and removed a stone from the pile. The stones that remained were built into a cairn to honour the dead. Cairns in the region were also put to vital practical use. For example, [[Dún Aonghasa]], an all-stone [[Iron Age]] Irish [[hill fort]] on [[Inishmore]] in the [[Aran Islands]], is still surrounded by small cairns and strategically placed jutting rocks, used collectively as an alternative to [[Defensive wall|defensive earthworks]] because of the [[karst]] landscape's lack of soil.

In [[Scandinavia]], cairns have been used for centuries as trail and sea marks, among other purposes. In [[Iceland]], cairns were often used as markers along the numerous single-file roads or paths that crisscrossed the island; many of these ancient cairns are still standing, although the paths have disappeared. In [[Norse Greenland]], cairns were used as a hunting implement, a game-driving "lane", used to direct reindeer towards a [[game jump]].<ref>Arneborg 2004</ref>

In the mythology of ancient Greece, cairns were associated with [[Hermes]], the god of overland travel. According to one legend, Hermes was put on trial by [[Hera]] for slaying her favorite servant, the monster [[Argus Panoptes|Argus]]. All of the other gods acted as a jury, and as a way of declaring their verdict they were given pebbles, and told to throw them at whichever person they deemed to be in the right, Hermes or Hera. Hermes argued so skillfully that he ended up buried under a heap of pebbles, and this was the first cairn.
In [[Croatia]], in areas of ancient [[Dalmatia]], such as [[Herzegovina]] and the [[Krajina]], they are known as ''gromila''.

In [[Portugal]] a cairn is called  ''{{lang|pt|moledro}}''. In a legend the stones, moledros, are enchanted soldiers, and if one stone is taken from the pile and put under a pillow in the morning a soldier will appear for a brief moment, then will change back to a stone and magically return to the pile.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Genética e a Teoria da Continuidade Paleolítica aplicada à Lenda da Fundação de Portugal e Escócia Apenas Livros|year=2008|isbn=978-989-618-180-2|url=http://www.continuitas.org/texts/morais_genetica.pdf}} {{pt icon}}</ref> The cairns that mark the place where someone died or cover the graves alongside the roads where in the past people were buried are called ''{{lang|pt|Fiéis de Deus}}''.

===North and Northeast Africa===
[[File:Qableh3.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Ancient cairns in [[Qa’ableh]], [[Somalia]].]]
Cairns (''taalo'') are a common feature at [[Elaayo]], [[Haylaan]], [[Qa’ableh]] and [[Qombo'ul]], among other places. Northern [[Somalia]] in general is home to a lot of such historical settlements and [[archaeological site]]s wherein are found numerous ancient ruins and buildings, many of obscure origins. However, many of these old structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity.<ref name="Hodd">Michael Hodd, ''East African Handbook'', (Trade & Travel Publications: 1994), p.640.</ref>

Since [[Neolithic]] times, the climate of [[North Africa]] has become drier. A reminder of the [[desertification]] of the area is provided by [[megalith]]ic remains, which occur in a great variety of forms and in vast numbers in presently arid and uninhabitable wastelands: cairns (''kerkour''), [[dolmen]]s and circles like [[Stonehenge]], underground cells excavated in rock, [[Long barrow|barrows]] topped with huge slabs, and step [[pyramid]]-like mounds.

===Asia and the Pacific===

Starting in the [[Bronze Age]],{{clarify|date=March 2011|reason=WHERE?!? "Asia" is huge.}} burial [[cist]]s were sometimes interred into cairns, which would be situated in conspicuous positions, often on the skyline above the village of the deceased. The stones may have been thought to deter grave robbers and scavengers. A more sinister explanation is that they were to [[Revenant (folklore)|stop the dead from rising]]. There remains a [[Judaism|Jewish]] tradition of placing small stones on a person's grave as a token of respect, though this is generally to relate the longevity of stone to the eternal nature of the soul and is not usually done in a cairn fashion. [[Stupa]]s in India and [[Tibet]] probably started out in a similar fashion, although they now generally contain the ashes of a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] saint or [[lama]].

[[File:TallOvoo.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Mongolian ceremonial cairn (''[[ovoo]]'')]]A traditional and often decorated, heap-formed cairn called an ''[[ovoo]]'' is made in [[Mongolia]]. It primarily serves religious purposes, and finds use in both [[Tengriism|Tengriist]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ceremonies.

In [[Hawaii]], cairns are called by the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word {{lang|haw|''ahu''}}.{{clarify|date=March 2011|reason=So what? Is this an ancient thing? If so, tell us about it and cite sources.

In [[South Korea]] cairns are quite prevalent, often found along roadsides and trails, up on mountain peaks, and adjacent to Buddhist temples.  Hikers frequently add stones to existing cairns trying to get just one more on top of the pile, to bring good luck.  This tradition has its roots in the worship of San-shin, or Mountain Spirit, so often still revered in Korean culture.<ref name="san">{{cite book | title=Spirit of the Mountains - Korea's San-Shin and Traditions of Mountain Worship| last=Mason| first=David| year=1999| page=41| publisher=Hollym International Corp.| location=Seoul, South Korea and Elizabeth, New Jersey| isbn=1-56591-107-5}}</ref>

===The Americas===
[[File:Cairn5.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A cairn marking the peak of Bald Mountain, the [[Adirondack Mountains]], [[USA]].]]
Throughout what today are the [[continental United States]] and [[Canada]], cairns still mark [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]]' game-driving "lanes" leading to [[buffalo jump]]s, some of which may date to 12,000 years ago.

Natives of arctic North America (i.e. northern Canada, [[Alaska]] and indigenous [[Greenland]]) have built carefully constructed cairns and stone sculptures, called by names such as {{lang|iu|[[Inuksuk|''inuksuit'' and ''inunnguat'']]}}, as landmarks and directional markers since [[European colonization of the Americas|before contact with Europeans]].  They are iconic of the region (an ''{{lang|iu|inuksuk}}'' even features on the flag of the Canadian far-northeastern territory, [[Nunavut]]), and are increasingly used as a symbol of Canadian national identity.

In North America, cairns are often [[petroforms]] in the shapes of turtles or other animals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Cairns have been used since [[pre-Columbian]] times throughout [[Latin America]] to mark trails. Even today in the [[Andes]] of [[South America]], the [[Quechuan]] peoples use cairns as religious shrines to the indigenous [[Inca]] goddess [[Pachamama]], often as part of a [[Synchretism|synchretic]] form of [[Roman Catholicism]].

The building of cairns in the American Southwest has proliferated in the last decade and has caused much controversy regarding the conflict between providing navigational trail markers and protecting the remaining natural condition of the landscape.  In many cases the greatest numbers of cairns appear along trails which are themselves well trodden and unmistakable paths, frequently with official signage and not needing further markers.  In some areas park rangers and land managers must routinely disassemble recreational cairns which have become eyesores or misleading markers.  There is evidence that New Age spiritualism is a motivation for the construction of personal cairns throughout the landscape.{{cn|date=October 2013}}

==Cairns and anthropomorphism==
[[File:Inuksugalait Foxe-PI 2002-07-26.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''[[Inuksuit]]'' at the [[Inuksuk Point]] ([[Baffin Island]]), Canada]]
Although the practice is not common in [[Modern English language|English]], cairns are sometimes referred to by their [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] qualities. In [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], a cairn is known as {{lang|de|''steinmann''}} and {{lang|nl|''steenman''}} respectively, meaning literally "stone man".  A form of the [[Inuit]] {{lang|iu|''[[inuksuk]]''}} is also meant to represent a human figure, and is called an ''{{lang|iu|inunguak}}'' ("imitation of a person"). In Italy, especially the [[Italian Alps]], a cairn is an ''{{lang|it|ometto}}'', or a "small man".

Coastal cairns called [[sea mark]]s are also common in the northern latitudes, and are placed along shores and on islands and islets. Usually painted white for improved offshore visibility, they serve as [[Navigational aid|navigation aid]]s. In [[Scandinavia]] they are called ''{{lang|sv|kummel}}'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and ''{{lang|fi|kummeli}}'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and are indicated in navigation charts and maintained as part of the nautical marking system.<ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url= http://portal.fma.fi/portal/page/portal/589032C37AAC7314E040B40A0A016368 |title=Legend (INT Symbology) |format=PDF |location=[[Helsinki, Finland]] |publisher=Finnish Transport Agency and Finnish Transport Safety Agency (TraFi) |work=Merenkulku.fi}} Three-language key to reading Finnish navigation charts.</ref> Inversely, they are used on land as sea cliff warnings in rugged and hilly terrain in the foggy [[Faroe Islands]]. In the [[Maritimes|Canadian Maritimes]], cairns have been used as beacons like small [[lighthouse]]s to guide boats, as depicted in the novel ''[[The Shipping News]]''.
