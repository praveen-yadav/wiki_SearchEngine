Chekhov renounced the theatre after the disastrous reception of ''[[The Seagull]]'' in 1896, but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by [[Constantin Stanislavski]]'s [[Moscow Art Theatre]], which subsequently also produced Chekhov's ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and premiered his last two plays, ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]''. These four works present a challenge to the acting ensemble<ref>"Actors climb up Chekhov like a mountain, roped together, sharing the glory if they ever make it to the summit".

Anton Chekhov was born on the feast day of St. [[Anthony the Great]] (17 January Old Style) 29 January 1860, the third of six surviving children, in [[Taganrog, Russia|Taganrog]], a port on the [[Sea of Azov]] in southern [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. His father, Pavel Yegorovich Chekhov, the son of a former [[serfdom|serf]], was from a village Vilkhovatka near [[Kobeliaky]] ([[Poltava Oblast|Poltava region]]) and ran a grocery store. A director of the parish choir, devout [[Orthodox Christian]], and physically abusive father, Pavel Chekhov has been seen by some historians as the model for his son's many portraits of hypocrisy.<ref name = "Wood 78">Wood, 78.</ref> Chekhov's mother, Yevgeniya, was an excellent storyteller who entertained the children with tales of her travels with her cloth-merchant father all over Russia.<ref>Payne, XVII.</ref><ref name = "Simmons 18">Simmons, 18.</ref> "Our talents we got from our father," Chekhov remembered, "but our soul from our mother."<ref name = "Bio">From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mihail, which prefaces [[Constance Garnett]]'s translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920.</ref>
In adulthood, Chekhov criticized his brother [[Alexander Chekhov|Alexander's]] treatment of his wife and children by reminding him of Pavel's tyranny:
{{bquote|Let me ask you to recall that it was despotism and lying that ruined your mother's youth. Despotism and lying so mutilated our childhood that it's sickening and frightening to think about it. Remember the horror and disgust we felt in those times when Father threw a tantrum at dinner over too much salt in the soup and called Mother a fool.<ref>Letter to brother Alexander, 2 January 1889, in Malcolm, p. 102.</ref><ref name = "Suvoring 1894">Another insight into Chekhov's childhood came in a letter to his publisher and friend Alexei Suvorin: "From my childhood I have believed in progress, and I could not help believing in it since the difference between the time when I used to be thrashed and when they gave up thrashing me was tremendous." Letter to Suvorin, 27 March 1894. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]</ref>}}

Chekhov attended a [[Greek Church and Greek School in Taganrog|school for Greek boys]], followed by the Taganrog ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'', now renamed the [[Chekhov Gymnasium]], where he was kept down for a year at fifteen for failing a Greek exam.<ref name = "Bartlett 4-5">Bartlett, 4–5.</ref> He sang at the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] monastery in Taganrog and in his father's choirs. In a letter of 1892, he used the word "suffering" to describe his childhood and recalled:

{{bquote|When my brothers and I used to stand in the middle of the church and sing the trio "May my prayer be exalted", or "The Archangel's Voice", everyone looked at us with emotion and envied our parents, but we at that moment felt like little convicts.<ref name="multiref1">Letter to I.L. Shcheglov, 9 March 1892. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]</ref>}}

Despite having a religious background and education, he later lost his faith.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tabachnikova|first=Olga|title=Anton Chekhov Through the Eyes of Russian Thinkers: Vasilii Rozanov, Dmitrii Merezhkovskii and Lev Shestov|year=2010|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-1-84331-841-5|page=26|quote=For Rozanov, Chekhov represents a concluding stage of classical Russian literature at the turn of the centuries, caused by the 'fading' of a thousand' years old Christian tradition which was spiritually feeding this literature.

In 1876, Chekhov's father was declared bankrupt after over-extending his finances building a new house,<ref>He had been cheated by a contractor called Mironov. Rayfield, 31.</ref> and to avoid the [[debtor's prison]] fled to Moscow, where his two eldest sons, [[Alexander Chekhov|Alexander]] and [[Nikolai Chekhov|Nikolay]], were attending university. The family lived in poverty in Moscow, Chekhov's mother physically and emotionally broken.<ref>Letter to cousin Mihail, 10 May 1877. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]</ref> Chekhov was left behind to sell the family possessions and finish his education.

Chekhov remained in Taganrog for three more years, boarding with a man called Selivanov who, like Lopakhin in ''The Cherry Orchard'', had bailed out the family for the price of their house.<ref name = "Malcolm 25">Malcolm, 25.</ref> Chekhov had to pay for his own education, which he managed by—among other jobs—private tutoring, catching and selling [[European Goldfinch|goldfinches]], and selling short sketches to the newspapers.<ref name="Payne XX">Payne, XX.</ref> He sent every [[ruble]] he could spare to [[Moscow]], along with humorous letters to cheer up the family.<ref name="Payne XX" /> During this time, he read widely and analytically, including [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]], [[Ivan Goncharov|Goncharov]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]];<ref name = "Mihail 1876">Letter to brother Mihail, 1 July 1876. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]</ref><ref name = "Simmons 26">Simmons, 26.</ref> and he wrote a full-length comedy drama, ''Fatherless'', which his brother Alexander dismissed as "an inexcusable though innocent fabrication."<ref>Simmons, 33.</ref> Chekhov also enjoyed a series of love affairs, one with the wife of a teacher.<ref name="Payne XX" />

In 1879, Chekhov completed his schooling and joined his family in [[Moscow]], having gained admission to the medical school at [[Moscow State University|Moscow University]].<ref>Rayfield, 69.</ref>

===Early writings===
Chekhov now assumed responsibility for the whole family.<ref>Wood, 79.</ref> To support them and to pay his tuition fees, he wrote daily short, humorous sketches and vignettes of contemporary Russian life, many under pseudonyms such as "Antosha Chekhonte" (Антоша Чехонте) and "Man without a Spleen" (Человек без селезенки). His prodigious output gradually earned him a reputation as a [[satire|satirical]] chronicler of Russian street life, and by 1882 he was writing for ''Oskolki'' (''[[Fragments (magazine)|Fragments]]''), owned by [[Nikolai Leykin]], one of the leading publishers of the time.<ref name = "Rayfield 91">Rayfield, 91.</ref> Chekhov's tone at this stage was harsher than that familiar from his mature fiction.<ref name="Obs">"There is in these miniatures an arresting potion of cruelty... The wonderfully compassionate Chekhov was yet to mature."

In 1884, Chekhov qualified as a physician, which he considered his principal profession though he made little money from it and treated the poor free of charge.<ref name = "Malcolm 26">Malcolm, 26.</ref> In 1884 and 1885, Chekhov found himself coughing blood, and in 1886 the attacks worsened; but he would not admit [[tuberculosis]] to his family and friends,<ref name = "Bio"/> confessing to Leykin, "I am afraid to submit myself to be sounded by my colleagues."<ref>Letter to N.A.Leykin, 6 April 1886. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]</ref> He continued writing for weekly periodicals, earning enough money to move the family into progressively better accommodation. Early in 1886 he was invited to write for one of the most popular papers in [[St. Petersburg]], ''[[Novoye Vremya (newspaper)|Novoye Vremya]]'' (''New Times''), owned and edited by the millionaire magnate [[Alexey Suvorin]], who paid per line a rate double Leykin's and allowed him three times the space.<ref name = "Rayfield 128">Rayfield, 128.</ref> Suvorin was to become a lifelong friend, perhaps Chekhov's closest.<ref>They only ever fell out once, when Chekhov objected to the [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] attacks in ''New Times'' against [[Alfred Dreyfus|Dreyfus]] and [[Émile Zola|Zola]] in 1898. Rayfield, 448–50.</ref><ref name = "Wood 79">In many ways, the right-wing Suvorin, whom [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] later called "The running dog of the [[Tsar|Tzar]]" (Payne, XXXV), was Chekhov's opposite; "Chekhov had to function like Suvorin's kidney, extracting the businessman's poisons." Wood, 79.</ref>

Before long, Chekhov was attracting literary as well as popular attention. The sixty-four-year-old [[Dmitry Grigorovich]], a celebrated Russian writer of the day, wrote to Chekhov after reading his short story ''The Huntsman'',<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1944 ''The Huntsman''.]. Retrieved 16 February 2007.</ref> "You have ''real'' talent—a talent which places you in the front rank among writers in the new generation." He went on to advise Chekhov to slow down, write less, and concentrate on literary quality.

Chekhov replied that the letter had struck him "like a thunderbolt" and confessed, "I have written my stories the way reporters write up their notes about fires—mechanically, half-consciously, caring nothing about either the reader or myself."<ref name = "Malcolm 32-3">Malcolm, 32–3.</ref> The admission may have done Chekhov a disservice, since early manuscripts reveal that he often wrote with extreme care, continually revising.<ref name="Payne XXIV">Payne, XXIV.</ref> Grigorovich's advice nevertheless inspired a more serious, artistic ambition in the twenty-six-year-old. In 1887, with a little string-pulling by Grigorovich, the short story collection ''At Dusk'' (''V Sumerkakh'') won Chekhov the coveted [[Pushkin Prize]] "for the best literary production distinguished by high artistic worth."<ref>Simmons, 160.</ref>

===Turning points===
That year, exhausted from overwork and ill health, Chekhov took a trip to [[Ukraine]] which reawakened him to the beauty of the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe|steppe]].<ref name = "Masha 1887">"There is a scent of the steppe and one hears the birds sing. I see my old friends the ravens flying over the steppe." Letter to sister Masha, 2 April 1887. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]</ref> On his return, he began the [[novella]]-length short story ''[[s:The Steppe|The Steppe]]'', "something rather odd and much too original," eventually published in ''[[Severny Vestnik]]'' (''The Northern Herald'').<ref>Letter to Grigorovich, 12 January 1888. Quoted by Malcolm, 137.</ref> In a narrative which drifts with the thought processes of the characters, Chekhov evokes a [[chaise]] journey across the steppe through the eyes of a young boy sent to live away from home, his companions a priest and a merchant. ''The Steppe'', which has been called a "dictionary of Chekhov's poetics", represented a significant advance for Chekhov, exhibiting much of the quality of his mature fiction and winning him publication in a literary journal rather than a newspaper.<ref>"''The Steppe'', as Michael Finke suggests, is 'a sort of dictionary of Chekhov's poetics,' a kind of sample case of the concealed literary weapons Chekhov would deploy in his work to come." Malcolm, 147.</ref>

In autumn 1887, a theatre manager named Korsh commissioned Chekhov to write a play, the result being ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'', written in a fortnight and produced that November.<ref name=autogenerated3>From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mikhail, which prefaces [[Constance Garnett]]'s translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920.</ref> Though Chekhov found the experience "sickening", and painted a comic portrait of the chaotic production in a letter to his brother Alexander, the play was a hit and was praised, to Chekhov's bemusement, as a work of originality.<ref name = "Alexander 1887">Letter to brother Alexander, 20 November 1887. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]</ref> Mikhail Chekhov considered ''Ivanov'' a key moment in his brother's intellectual development and literary career.<ref name = "Bio"/> From this period comes an observation of Chekhov's which has become known as "[[Chekhov's gun]]", noted by Ilia Gurliand from a conversation: "If in Act I you have a pistol hanging on the wall, then it must fire in the last act."<ref>Rayfield, 203.</ref><ref name = "Simmons 190">Simmons, 190.</ref>

The death of Chekhov's brother Nikolay from tuberculosis in 1889 influenced ''A Dreary Story'', finished that September, about a man who confronts the end of a life which he realises has been without purpose.<ref name = "Dreary">[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1883 ''A Dreary Story''.].

===Sakhalin===
In 1890, Chekhov undertook an arduous journey by train, horse-drawn carriage, and river steamer to the far east of Russia and the [[katorga]], or penal colony, on [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]], north of Japan, where he spent three months interviewing thousands of convicts and settlers for a census. The letters Chekhov wrote during the two-and-a-half month journey to Sakhalin are considered to be among his best.<ref>Malcolm, 129.</ref> His remarks to his sister about [[Tomsk]] were to become notorious.<ref>Simmons, 223.</ref><ref name = "Rayfield 224">Rayfield, 224.</ref>

{{quote|"Tomsk is a very dull town. To judge from the drunkards whose acquaintance I have made, and from the intellectual people who have come to the hotel to pay their respects to me, the inhabitants are very dull, too."<ref name = "Masha 1890">Letter to sister, Masha, 20 May 1890. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]</ref>}}

The inhabitants of Tomsk later retaliated by erecting a mocking statue of Chekhov.

Chekhov witnessed much on Sakhalin that shocked and angered him, including floggings, embezzlement of supplies, and [[sexual slavery|forced prostitution]] of women. He wrote,  "There were times I felt that I saw before me the extreme limits of man's degradation."<ref>Wood, 85.</ref><ref name = "Rayfield 230">Rayfield 230.</ref> He was particularly moved by the plight of the children living in the penal colony with their parents. For example:

{{quote|"On the [[Amur River|Amur]] steamer going to Sakhalin, there was a convict who had murdered his wife and wore fetters on his legs. His daughter, a little girl of six, was with him. I noticed wherever the convict moved the little girl scrambled after him, holding on to his fetters. At night the child slept with the convicts and soldiers all in a heap together."<ref>Letter to A.F.Koni, 16 January 1891. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]</ref>}}

Chekhov later concluded that charity and subscription were not the answer, but that the government had a duty to finance humane treatment of the convicts. His findings were published in 1893 and 1894 as ''Ostrov Sakhalin'' (''The Island of Sakhalin''), a work of social science – not literature – worthy and informative rather than brilliant.<ref name = "Malcolm 125">Malcolm, 125.</ref><ref name = "Simmons 229">Such is the general critical view of the work, but Simmons calls it a "valuable and intensely human document." Simmons, 229.</ref> Chekhov found literary expression for the "Hell of Sakhalin" in his long short story ''[[s:The Murder|The Murder]]'',<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13419 ''The Murder''.]. Retrieved 16 February 2007.</ref> the last section of which is set on Sakhalin, where the murderer Yakov loads coal in the night, longing for home. Chekhov's writing on Sakhalin is the subject of brief comment and analysis in Japanese writer [[Haruki Murakami| Haruki Murakami's]] novel [[1Q84]].

===Melikhovo===
In 1892, Chekhov bought the small country estate of [[Melikhovo]], about forty miles south of Moscow, where he lived until 1899 with his family. "It's nice to be a lord," he joked to his friend Ivan Leontyev (who wrote humorous pieces under the pseudonym Shcheglov),<ref name="multiref1"/> but he took his responsibilities as a landlord seriously and soon made himself useful to the local peasants. As well as organising relief for victims of the [[famine]] and [[cholera]] outbreaks of 1892, he went on to build three schools, a fire station, and a clinic, and to donate his medical services to peasants for miles around, despite frequent recurrences of his tuberculosis.<ref name = "Wood 78"/><ref name = "Malcolm 26" /><ref name = "Payne XXXI">Payne, XXXI.</ref>

Mikhail Chekhov, a member of the household at Melikhovo, described the extent of his brother's medical commitments:

{{quote|From the first day that Chekhov moved to Melikhovo, the sick began flocking to him from twenty miles around. They came on foot or were brought in carts, and often he was fetched to patients at a distance. Sometimes from early in the morning peasant women and children were standing before his door waiting.<ref name=autogenerated1>From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mikhail, which prefaces Constance Garnett's translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920.</ref>}}

Chekhov's expenditure on drugs was considerable, but the greatest cost was making journeys of several hours to visit the sick, which reduced his time for writing.<ref name=autogenerated2>From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mihail, which prefaces Constance Garnett's translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920.</ref> Chekhov's work as a doctor, however, enriched his writing by bringing him into intimate contact with all sections of Russian society: for example, he witnessed at first hand the peasants' unhealthy and cramped living conditions, which he recalled in his short story ''Peasants''. Chekhov visited the upper classes as well, recording in his notebook: "Aristocrats? The same ugly bodies and physical uncleanliness, the same toothless old age and disgusting death, as with market-women."<ref name = "note">[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/12494 ''Note-Book''.]. Retrieved 16 February 2007.</ref>

Chekhov began writing his play ''The Seagull'' in 1894, in a lodge he had built in the orchard at Melikhovo. In the two years since moving to the estate, he had refurbished the house, taken up agriculture and horticulture, tended orchard and pond, and planted many trees, which, according to Mikhail, he "looked after... as though they were his children. Like Colonel Vershinin in his ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'', as he looked at them he dreamed of what they would be like in three or four hundred years."<ref name = "Bio"/>

The first night of ''The Seagull'' on 17 October 1896 at the [[Alexandrinsky Theatre]] in <!--Saint?-->Petersburg was a fiasco, booed by the audience, and the play's reception stung Chekhov into renouncing the theatre.<ref>Rayfield, 394–8.</ref> But the play so impressed the theatre director [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]] that he convinced his colleague [[Constantin Stanislavski]] to direct it for the innovative [[Moscow Art Theatre]] in 1898.<ref name = "Ben">Benedetti, ''Stanislavski: An Introduction'', 25.</ref> Stanislavski's attention to psychological realism and ensemble playing coaxed the buried subtleties from the text and restored Chekhov's interest in playwriting.<ref>Chekhov and the Art Theatre, in Stanislavski's words, were united in a common desire "to achieve artistic simplicity and truth on the stage." Allen, 11.</ref> The Art Theatre commissioned more plays from Chekhov and the following year staged ''Uncle Vanya'', which Chekhov had completed in 1896.<ref>Rayfield, 390–1. Rayfield draws from his critical study ''Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya" and the "Wood Demon"'' (1995), which anatomised the evolution of the ''Wood Demon'' into ''Uncle Vanya''—"one of Chekhov's most furtive achievements."</ref>

===Yalta===
In March 1897 Chekhov suffered a major haemorrhage of the lungs while on a visit to Moscow.  With great difficulty he was persuaded to enter a clinic, where the doctors diagnosed tuberculosis on the upper part of his lungs and ordered a change in his manner of life.<ref>Letter to Suvorin, 1 April 1897.

After his father's death in 1898, Chekhov bought a plot of land on the outskirts of [[Yalta]] and built a [[White Dacha|villa]] there, into which he moved with his mother and sister the following year. Though he planted trees and flowers in Yalta, kept dogs and tame cranes, and received guests such as [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Maxim Gorky]], Chekhov was always relieved to leave his "hot [[Siberia]]" for Moscow or travels abroad. He vowed to move to Taganrog as soon as a water supply was installed there.<ref>Olga Knipper, "Memoir", in Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress'', 37, 270.</ref><ref name = "Bartlett 2">Bartlett, 2.</ref> In Yalta he completed two more plays for the Art Theatre, composing with greater difficulty than in the days when he "wrote serenely, the way I eat pancakes now"; he took a year each over ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]''.<ref>Malcolm, 170–71.</ref>

On 25 May 1901 Chekhov married [[Olga Knipper]]—quietly, owing to his horror of weddings—a former protegée and sometime lover of Nemirovich-Danchenko whom he had first met at rehearsals for ''The Seagull''.<ref>"I have a horror of weddings, the congratulations and the champagne, standing around, glass in hand with an endless grin on your face." Letter to Olga Knipper, 19 April 1901.</ref><ref name = "Benedetti 125">Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress'', 125.</ref><ref name = "Rayfield 500">"Olga's relations with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko were more than professional." Rayfield, 500.</ref> Up to that point, Chekhov, called "Russia's most elusive literary bachelor",<ref>Harvey Pitcher in ''Chekhov's Leading Lady'', quoted in Malcolm, 59.</ref> had preferred passing liaisons and visits to brothels over commitment;<ref>"Chekhov had the temperament of a philanderer. Sexually, he preferred brothels or swift liaisons." Wood, 78.</ref> he had once written to Suvorin:

{{quote|By all means I will be married if you wish it. But on these conditions: everything must be as it has been hitherto—that is, she must live in Moscow while I live in the country, and I will come and see her ... give me a wife who, like the moon, won't appear in my sky every day.<ref>Letter to Suvorin, 23 March 1895. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]</ref>}}

The letter proved prophetic of Chekhov's marital arrangements with Olga: he lived largely at Yalta, she in Moscow, pursuing her acting career. In 1902, Olga suffered a miscarriage; and [[Donald Rayfield]] has offered evidence, based on the couple's letters, that conception may have occurred when Chekhov and Olga were apart, although Russian scholars have refuted that claim.<ref>Rayfield also tentatively suggests, drawing on obstetric clues, that Olga suffered an [[ectopic pregnancy]] rather than a miscarriage. Rayfield, 556–57.</ref><ref name = "Simmons Benedetti">There was certainly tension between the couple after the miscarriage, though Simmons, 569, and Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress'', 241, put this down to Chekhov's mother and sister blaming the miscarriage on Olga's late-night lifestyle of socialising with her actor friends.</ref> The literary legacy of this long-distance marriage is a correspondence which preserves gems of theatre history, including shared complaints about Stanislavski's directing methods and Chekhov's advice to Olga about performing in his plays.<ref>Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress: The Love Letters of Olga Knipper and Anton Chekhov''.</ref>

In Yalta, Chekhov wrote one of his most famous stories, "[[The Lady with the Dog (short story)|The Lady with the Dog]]"<ref>{{cite news|author=Rosamund, Bartlett|title=The House That Chekhov Built |journal=Evening Standard|date= 2 February 2010|page=31|accessdate=November 2011}}</ref> (also called "Lady with Lapdog"),<ref>Greenberg, Yael. "The Presentation Of The Unconscious In Chekhov's Lady With Lapdog." ''Modern Language Review'' 86.1 (1991): 126–130. Academic Search Premier.

Neither expects anything lasting from the encounter, but they find themselves drawn back to each other, risking the security of their family lives.<ref>"Overview: 'The Lady with the Dog'."

===Death===
By May 1904, Chekhov was terminally ill with [[tuberculosis]]. Mikhail Chekhov recalled that "everyone who saw him secretly thought the end was not far off, but the nearer [he] was to the end, the less he seemed to realise it."<ref name = "Bio"/> On 3 June he set off with Olga for the German spa town of [[Badenweiler]] in the [[Black Forest]], from where he wrote outwardly jovial letters to his sister Masha describing the food and surroundings and assuring her and his mother that he was getting better. In his last letter, he complained about the way the German women dressed.<ref>Letter to sister Masha, 28 June 1904. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]</ref>

Chekhov's death has become one of "the great set pieces of literary history",<ref>Malcolm, 62.</ref> retold, embroidered, and fictionalised many times since, notably in the short story "Errand" by [[Raymond Carver]]. In 1908, Olga wrote this account of her husband's last moments:

{{quote|Anton sat up unusually straight and said loudly and clearly (although he knew almost no German): ''Ich sterbe'' ("I'm dying"). The doctor calmed him, took a syringe, gave him an injection of [[camphor]], and ordered [[champagne]]. Anton took a full glass, examined it, smiled at me and said: "It's a long time since I drank champagne." He drained it, lay quietly on his left side, and I just had time to run to him and lean across the bed and call to him, but he had stopped breathing and was sleeping peacefully as a child...<ref>Olga Knipper, ''Memoir'', in Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress'', 284.</ref>}}

Chekhov's body was transported to Moscow in a refrigerated railway car for fresh [[oyster]]s, a detail which offended [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]].<ref>"Banality revenged itself upon him by a nasty prank, for it saw that his corpse, the corpse of a poet, was put into a railway truck 'For the Conveyance of Oysters'." Maxim Gorky in [http://www.eldritchpress.org/ac/gorky.htm ''Reminiscences of Anton Chekhov''.].

==Legacy==
A few months before he died, Chekhov told the writer [[Ivan Bunin]] he thought people might go on reading him for seven years. "Why seven?" asked Bunin. "Well, seven and a half," Chekhov replied. "That's not bad. I've got six years to live."<ref>Payne, XXXVI.</ref>
[[File:Chekhov-bios1-1024.jpg|thumb|Chekhov biographies]]
Always modest, Chekhov could hardly have imagined the extent of his posthumous reputation. The ovations for the play, ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'', in the year of his death showed him how high he had risen in the affection of the Russian public—by then he was second in literary celebrity only to Tolstoy,<ref>Tolstoy, a great admirer of Chekhov's short stories, divided them into two groups of "first quality" and "second quality." In the first category were: "Children", "The Chorus Girl", "A Play", "Home", "Misery", "The Runaway", "In Court", "Vanka", "Ladies", "The Malefactors", "The Boys", "Darkness", "Sleepy", "The Helpmate", and "The Darling"; in the second: "A Transgression", "Sorrow", "The Witch", "Verochka", "In a Strange Land", "The Cook's Wedding", "A Tedious Business", "An Upheaval", "Oh! The Public!", "The Mask", "A Woman's Luck", "Nerves", "The Wedding", "A Defenseless Creature", and "Peasant Wives". He had these stories bound into a book, which he read repeatedly with great satisfaction. – Simmons, p. 595.</ref> who outlived him by six years—but after his death, Chekhov's fame soon spread further afield. [[Constance Garnett]]'s translations won him an English-language readership and the admiration of writers such as [[James Joyce]], [[Virginia Woolf]], and [[Katherine Mansfield]]. The issues surrounding the close similarities between Mansfield's 1910 story "The Child Who Was Tired" and Chekhov's "Sleepy" are summarised in William H. New's ''Reading Mansfield and Metaphors of Reform''<ref>{{cite book|title=Reading Mansfield and Metaphors of Reform|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=1999|ISBN= 978-0-7735-1791-2|pages=15–17}}</ref> The Russian critic [[D.S. Mirsky]], who lived in England, explained Chekhov's popularity in that country by his "unusually complete rejection of what we may call the heroic values."<ref>Wood, 77.</ref> In Russia itself, Chekhov's drama fell out of fashion after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|revolution]] but was later adapted to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agenda, with the character Lopakhin, for example, reinvented as a hero of the new order, taking an axe to the cherry orchard.<ref>Allen, 88.</ref><ref name = "Danchenko">"They won't allow a play which is seen to lament the lost estates of the gentry." Letter of [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]], quoted by Anatoly Smeliansky in "Chekhov at the Moscow Art Theatre", from ''The Cambridge Companion to Chekhov'', 31–2.</ref>

One of the first non-Russians to praise Chekhov's plays was [[George Bernard Shaw]], who subtitled his ''Heartbreak House'' "A Fantasia in the Russian Manner on English Themes" and noted similarities between the predicament of the British landed class and that of their Russian counterparts as depicted by Chekhov: "the same nice people, the same utter futility."<ref>Anna Obraztsova in "Bernard Shaw's Dialogue with Chekhov", from Miles, 43–4.</ref>

In America, Chekhov's reputation began its rise slightly later, partly through the influence of [[Stanislavski's system]] of acting, with its notion of [[subtext]]: "Chekhov often expressed his thought not in speeches," wrote Stanislavski, "but in pauses or between the lines or in replies consisting of a single word... the characters often feel and think things not expressed in the lines they speak."<ref>Reynolds, Elizabeth (ed), ''Stanislavski's Legacy'', Theatre Arts Books, 1987, ISBN 978-0-87830-127-0, 81, 83.</ref><ref name = "Eßlin">"It was Chekhov who first deliberately wrote dialogue in which the mainstream of emotional action ran underneath the surface. It was he who articulated the notion that human beings hardly ever speak in explicit terms among each other about their deepest emotions, that the great, tragic, climactic moments are often happening beneath outwardly trivial conversation." [[Martin Esslin]], from ''Text and Subtext in Shavian Drama'', in ''1922: Shaw and the last Hundred Years'', ed. Bernard. F. Dukore, Penn State Press, 1994, ISBN 978-0-271-01324-4, 200.</ref> The [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]], in particular, developed the subtextual approach to drama, influencing generations of [[Theater in the United States|American playwrights]], screenwriters, and actors, including [[Clifford Odets]], [[Elia Kazan]] and, in particular, [[Lee Strasberg]]. In turn, Strasberg's [[Actors Studio]] and the [[Method acting|"Method" acting]] approach influenced many actors, including [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Robert De Niro]], though by then the Chekhov tradition may have been distorted by a preoccupation with realism.<ref>"Lee Strasberg became in my opinion a victim of the traditional idea of Chekhovian theatre... [he left] no room for Chekhov's imagery." Georgii Tostonogov on Strasberg's production of ''Three Sisters'' in ''The Drama Review'' (winter 1968), quoted by Styan, 121.</ref> In 1981, the playwright [[Tennessee Williams]] adapted ''The Seagull'' as ''[[The Notebook of Trigorin]]''. One of Anton's nephews, [[Michael Chekhov]] would also contribute heavily to modern theatre, particularly through his unique acting methods which differed from Stanislavski's.

Despite Chekhov's eminence as a playwright, some writers believe his short stories represent the greater achievement.<ref name = "Boyd">"The plays lack the seamless authority of the fiction: there are great characters, wonderful scenes, tremendous passages, moments of acute melancholy and sagacity, but the parts appear greater than the whole." [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,6000,1261403,00.html ''A Chekhov Lexicon,''] by [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], ''The Guardian'', 3 July 2004. Retrieved 16 February 2007.</ref> [[Raymond Carver]], who wrote the short story "Errand" about Chekhov's death, believed Chekhov the greatest of all short story writers:

{{quote|Chekhov's stories are as wonderful (and necessary) now as when they first appeared. It is not only the immense number of stories he wrote—for few, if any, writers have ever done more—it is the awesome frequency with which he produced masterpieces, stories that shrive us as well as delight and move us, that lay bare our emotions in ways only true art can accomplish.<ref>Bartlett, [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,,1261382,00.html ''From Russia, with Love''], ''The Guardian'', 15 July 2004. Retrieved 17 February 2007.</ref>}}

[[Ernest Hemingway]], another writer influenced by Chekhov, was more grudging: "Chekhov wrote about 6 good stories. But he was an amateur writer."<ref>Letter from [[Ernest Hemingway]] to [[Archibald MacLeish]], 1925 (from ''Selected Letters'', p. 179), in ''Ernest Hemingway on Writing'', Ed Larry W. Phillips, Touchstone, (1984) 1999, ISBN 978-0-684-18119-6, 101.</ref> And [[Vladimir Nabokov]] once complained of Chekhov's "medley of dreadful prosaisms, ready-made epithets, repetitions."<ref>Wood, 82.</ref> But he also declared "[[The Lady with the Dog]]" "one of the greatest stories ever written" and described Chekhov as writing "the way one person relates to another the most important things in his life, slowly and yet without a break, in a slightly subdued voice."<ref>From [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''Lectures on Russian Literature'', quoted by [[Francine Prose]] in ''Learning from Chekhov'', 231.</ref>

For the writer [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], Chekhov's breakthrough was to abandon what [[William Gerhardie]] called the "event plot" for something more "blurred, interrupted, mauled or otherwise tampered with by life."<ref>"For the first time in literature the fluidity and randomness of life was made the form of the fiction. Before Chekhov, the event-plot drove all fictions." [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], referring to the novelist [[William Gerhardie]]'s analysis in ''Anton Chekhov: A Critical Study'', 1923. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,6000,1261403,00.html ''A Chekhov Lexicon,''] by William Boyd, ''The Guardian'', 3 July 2004. Retrieved 16 February 2007.</ref>

Virginia Woolf mused on the unique quality of a Chekhov story in ''The Common Reader'' (1925):

{{quote|But is it the end, we ask? We have rather the feeling that we have overrun our signals; or it is as if a tune had stopped short without the expected chords to close it. These stories are inconclusive, we say, and proceed to frame a criticism based upon the assumption that stories ought to conclude in a way that we recognise. In so doing we raise the question of our own fitness as readers. Where the tune is familiar and the end emphatic—lovers united, villains discomfited, intrigues exposed—as it is in most [[Victorian literature|Victorian fiction]], we can scarcely go wrong, but where the tune is unfamiliar and the end a note of interrogation or merely the information that they went on talking, as it is in Tchekov, we need a very daring and alert sense of literature to make us hear the tune, and in particular those last notes which complete the harmony.<ref>Woolf, Virginia, ''The Common Reader: First Series, Annotated Edition'', Harvest/HBJ Book, 2002, ISBN 0-15-602778-X, 172.</ref>}}
