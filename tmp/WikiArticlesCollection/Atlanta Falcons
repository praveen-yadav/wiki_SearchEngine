The '''Atlanta Falcons''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. They are a member of the [[NFC South|South Division]] of the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The Falcons play their home games at the [[Georgia Dome]] in downtown Atlanta, but construction is likely to begin in 2014 on a [[New Falcons Stadium|new stadium]] with play beginning in the 2017 season. Their headquarters and practice facilities are located at a 50-acre site in [[Flowery Branch, Georgia]].<ref>'''Atlanta Falcons Corporate Headquarters and Training Facility''' http://www.claycorp.com/p/369/atlanta-falcons-corporate-headquarters-training/</ref> The Falcons joined the NFL in 1965<ref name="atlantafalcons1">[http://media.atlantafalcons.com/assets/History_Section.pdf ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> as an [[expansion team]], after the NFL offered then-owner [[Rankin Smith]] a franchise to keep him from joining the rival [[American Football League]] (AFL). The AFL instead granted a franchise to [[Miami]], [[Florida]] (the [[Miami Dolphins]]).  In their 47 years of existence, the Falcons have compiled a record of 312–402–6 with division championships in 1980, 1998, 2004, 2010 and 2012.  Their only Super Bowl appearance was during the 1998 season in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]].

Over the past five years, the Falcons, under General Manager [[Thomas Dimitroff]], Head Coach [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]], and Quarterback [[Matt Ryan]], have been one of the best franchises in the NFC. Since the start of the 2008 season, the Falcons have recorded five consecutive winning seasons for the first time in franchise history. They led the NFC in number of wins during that period with 57. Mike Smith’s 56–24 regular-season record in that span is the fifth-best in the league.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/giants/gotham_own_CmFwTAiMOkWmDWAEdYcD4N?CMP=OTC-rss&FEEDNAME= | work=New York Post | first=Bart | last=Hubbuch | title=Queens-born owner models Falcons after hometown team | date=January 7, 2012}}</ref> The Falcons had the NFL's second best winning percentage at home during the period of 2008 to 2010 with a .833 percentage.

==Franchise history==
{{details|History of the Atlanta Falcons}}

In 1965, after a stadium ([[Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium]]), was built, the city of Atlanta felt the time was right to start pursuing professional football. One independent group which had been active in NFL exhibition promotions in Atlanta applied for franchises in both the [[American Football League]] and the NFL, acting entirely on its own with no guarantee of stadium rights. Another group reported it had deposited earnest money for a team in the AFL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nflteamhistory.com/nfl_teams/atlanta_falcons/team_history.html |title=Atlanta Falcons Team History |publisher=Nflteamhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03}}</ref>

With everyone running in different directions, some local businessmen worked out a deal and were awarded an AFL franchise on June 7, 1965, contingent upon acquiring exclusive stadium rights from city officials. NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who had been moving slowly in Atlanta matters, was spurred by the AFL interest and headed on the next plane down to Atlanta to block the rival league's claim on the city of Atlanta.<ref name="atlantafalcons1"/> He forced the city to make a choice between the two leagues. By June 30, the city picked Rankin Smith and the NFL.

The Atlanta Falcons franchise began on June 30, 1965 when [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Pete Rozelle]] granted ownership to 41 year-old [[Rankin Smith Sr.]]. Smith an Executive Vice President of Life Insurance Company of Georgia at the time, paid $8.5 million the highest price in NFL history at the time 1965 for an NFL franchise.<ref name="atlantafalcons1"/> Former commissioner Pete Rozelle and Smith made the deal in about five minutes and the Atlanta Falcons brought the largest and most popular sport to the city of Atlanta. The Atlanta expansion franchise became the 15th NFL franchise, and they were awarded the first pick in the [[1966 NFL Draft]] as well as the final pick in each of the first five rounds.<ref name=HOF1966>{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/story.jsp?story_id=1998|title=1966 NFL Draft|accessdate =September 27, 2008 |publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame}}</ref> The Falcons drafted [[All-American]] [[Linebacker]] [[Tommy Nobis]] from the [[Texas Longhorns football|University of Texas]] with the first pick of the [[1966 NFL Draft|draft]], making him the first-ever Falcon. The [[National Football League|league]] also held the [[1966 NFL Expansion Draft]] six weeks later in which the Falcons selected unprotected players from existing franchises. Although the Falcons selected many good players in those drafts, they still were not able to win right away.<ref name="atlantafalcons1"/>

The Atlanta Falcons Football Club received its nickname on August 29, 1965.  Miss Julia Elliott, a school teacher from Griffin, Georgia was singled out from many people who suggested "Falcons" as the Nickname for the new Georgia NFL franchise. She wrote: "the Falcon is proud and dignified, with great courage and fight. It never drops its prey. It is deadly and has a great sporting tradition."<ref>Nicknames http://www.profootballhof.com/history/nicknames.aspx</ref>

==Notable Seasons==

===1966 – 1977: The Beginning===
The Falcons had their first season in {{nfly|1966}}, and their first preseason game on August 1, {{nfly|1966}}, losing to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Under Head Coach [[Norb Hecker]] they lost their first nine regular-season games in 1966 and secured their first victory on the road against the [[New York Giants]]. The team finished the 1960s with only 12 wins. The Falcons had their first [[Monday Night Football]] game in [[Atlanta]] during the 1970 season. The 1971 season was their first with a winning record.

===1978 – 1980: The Playoffs===
In the 1978 season, the Falcons qualified for the playoffs for the first time and won the Wild Card game against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] 14–13. The following week, they lost to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] 27–20 in the Divisional Playoffs.

In 1980, after a nine-game winning streak, the Falcons posted a franchise then-best record of 12–4 and captured their first NFC West division title. The next week, their dream season ended at home with a loss to the Cowboys 30–27 in the divisional playoffs. In the strike-shortened 1982 season, the Falcons made the playoffs but lost to the Minnesota Vikings, 30–24. Falcons coach [[Leeman Bennett]] was fired after the loss.

===1989===
In 1989, the Falcons drafted CB [[Deion Sanders]] in the first round, who helped them for the next four years, setting many records for the franchise. "Neon Deion" (a.k.a. "Prime Time") had a flashy appeal and helped bring media attention to one of the league's most anonymous franchises. Sanders was also famous for playing on major league baseball teams ([[the New York Yankees]] and the [[Atlanta Braves]]) while simultaneously playing in the NFL.

===1991 – 1992===
The Falcons' 1991 season ended in a divisional playoff loss to the [[Washington Redskins]]. In 1991, the Falcons drafted [[Brett Favre]] as the thirty-third overall pick. During his rookie season, he played in two games where he amassed a record of 5 passing attempts with 0 receptions and 2 interceptions. The following February, Favre was traded to the [[Green Bay Packers]].  

In 1992, the Atlanta Falcons opened a new chapter in their history moving into the newly constructed Georgia Dome.

===1997 – 2000: The Dan Reeves Era===

====1998====
{{main|1998 Atlanta Falcons season}}
In 1998, under recently acquired head coach [[Dan Reeves]], quarterback [[Chris Chandler]] and running back [[Jamal Anderson]] the "Dirty Bird" Falcons had their greatest season to date. On November 8, they beat the [[New England Patriots]] 41–10, ending a streak of 22 losses at cold-weather sites. The team finished with a franchise-best 14–2 regular season record and the NFC West division championship. On January 18, 1999, the Falcons upset the top-seeded [[Minnesota Vikings|Vikings]] at [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Minnesota]] in the NFC Championship Game 30–27, in an exciting overtime victory. However, in their first-ever Super Bowl appearance, they lost 34–19 to the defending champion [[Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]].

====1999====
{{main|1999 Atlanta Falcons season}}
In the second game of the Falcons 1999 season, running back [[Jamal Anderson]], who had been a key player in the Falcons' 1998 success, suffered a season-ending knee injury.  The Falcons finished the season with a very disappointing 5–11 regular season record.<ref name="atlantafalcons1"/>

====2000====
{{main|2000 Atlanta Falcons season}}
In 2000, the Falcons suffered through another horrendous season finishing 4–12 and once again missing the playoffs.

===2001 – 2006: The Michael Vick era===
In the [[2001 NFL Draft]], the Falcons orchestrated a trade with the [[San Diego Chargers]], acquiring the first overall pick (which was used on quarterback [[Michael Vick]]) in exchange for wide receiver / return specialist [[Tim Dwight]] and the fifth overall pick (used on running back [[LaDainian Tomlinson]]).

====2001====
{{main|2001 Atlanta Falcons season}}
The Falcons finished the 2001 season with a record of 7–9 and missed the playoffs. Longtime fan favorite LB [[Jessie Tuggle]] retired following 14 seasons in Atlanta. On December 6, 2001, [[Arthur M. Blank]], the co-founder and retired co-chairman of Atlanta-based [[Home Depot]], reached a preliminary agreement with the Falcons’ [[Taylor Smith]] to purchase the team. In a special meeting prior to [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] in New Orleans on February 2, 2002, NFL owners voted unanimously to approve the purchase.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2001/12/17/weekinbiz.html | title=Arthur Blank buys Falcons from Smith family | date=December 17, 2001}}</ref>

====2002====
{{main|2002 Atlanta Falcons season}}
The Atlanta Falcons began the [[Arthur Blank]] era of ownership with a 9–6–1 record and a berth in the playoffs as
a Wild Card participant. Blank helped resurrect the excitement in the Georgia Dome with added value to the fans with increased tailgating, parking, and entertainment and lower ticket prices. Every game during the 2002 season was sold out. After beginning the season at 1–3, head coach [[Dan Reeves]] and quarterback Michael Vick led the Falcons to an NFL-best eight-game unbeaten streak (7–0–1).  The Falcons finished off the season with a team-record 23 rushing touchdowns and a franchise-best eight games with 30 or more
points. Linebacker [[Keith Brooking]] set a Falcons career-high with 212 total tackles.

Vick saw minimal playing time in 2001, playing backup and learning the system under then-starting quarterback [[Chris Chandler]], and was designated starting quarterback for the 2002 season. The 2002 season was the Falcons' first in the more geographically-accurate NFC South upon NFL realignment. In 2002, Vick set many records and supplied the media with numerous highlights for the season, including rushing for 173 yards in an overtime win at Minnesota, the highest ever single-game rushing total for an NFL quarterback (surpassed only in post-season play by Colin Kaepernick in 2013—Vick's footwear from this game are currently enshrined in the NFL Hall of Fame). The Falcons became the first team in NFL history to claim a playoff win over the Green Bay Packers at [[Lambeau Field]], beating them 27–7.<ref>{{cite web|author=8:00 PM ET, January 4, 2003&nbsp; |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=230104009 |title=Atlanta Falcons vs. Green Bay Packers – Recap – January 04, 2003 – ESPN |publisher=Scores.espn.go.com |date=2003-01-04 |accessdate=2012-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://football.about.com/library/weekly/aa010403a.htm |title=2002–03 NFL Playoffs – Atlanta Falcons Green Bay Packers |publisher=Football.about.com |date=2012-04-10 |accessdate=2012-09-03}}</ref> Their season ended with a loss to [[Donovan McNabb]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] 20–6 in the NFC divisional playoffs.<ref name="atlantafalcons1"/> Michael Vick and Keith Brooking were elected to the NFC Pro Bowl for their performances in the 2002 regular season.<ref>Falcons' Vick skipping Pro Bowl http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2003/01/23/vick_probowl.html</ref>

====2003====
{{main|2003 Atlanta Falcons season}}
On March 19, 2003, the Falcons presented their new logo.<ref>“The new Atlanta Falcons logo is fresh, strong and dynamic, and yet appreciates the tradition and history of this franchise,” said Falcons owner and CEO Arthur Blank. “The new logo depicts a more powerful, aggressive Falcon – one of fast movement. It is also representative of the evolution and direction of our team.”</ref> During the 2003 preseason Michael Vick broke his leg and missed the first twelve games of the season. After losing 7 straight games, the decision was made to release head coach Dan Reeves. [[Wade Phillips]] acted as interim coach for the final 3 games. Although the Falcons won 3 of their last 4 games after the return of Michael Vick, they ended up with a dismal 5–11 record that year.

====2004====
{{main|2004 Atlanta Falcons season}}
In 2004, a new head coach, [[Jim L. Mora]], was hired and Michael Vick returned for the [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|full season]]. The Falcons went 11–5, winning their third division title and earning a first-round bye into the playoffs. In the divisional playoffs, the Falcons defeated the [[St. Louis Rams]] 47–17 in the [[Georgia Dome]], advancing to the [[NFC Championship]], which they lost to the [[2004 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] 27–10.

====2005====
{{main|2005 Atlanta Falcons season}}
The [[2005 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] again fell short of achieving back-to-back winning seasons in {{nfly|2005}}, going 8–8.

====2006====
{{main|2006 Atlanta Falcons season}}
In {{nfly|2006}}, Michael Vick became the first quarterback in league history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season, with 1,039. After finishing the season 7–9, however, coach Jim Mora was dismissed and [[Bobby Petrino]], the [[University of Louisville]]'s football coach, replaced him. Before the [[2007 NFL season|2007]] season began, Vick was suspended indefinitely by the NFL after pleading guilty to charges involving dog fighting in the state of Virginia. On December 10, 2007, Vick received a 23-month prison sentence and was officially cut from the Atlanta roster.

===2007: The Lost Year===
{{main|2007 Atlanta Falcons season}}
For the 2007 season, the [[2007 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] were forced to start [[Joey Harrington]] at quarterback. On December 11, 13 games into his first NFL season as head coach, [[Bobby Petrino]] resigned without notice to coach at the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|University of Arkansas]], leaving the beleaguered players only a note in the locker room. Secondary Coach [[Emmitt Thomas]] was named interim coach for the final three games of the season on December 12. The Falcons ended the year with a dismal 4–12 record.

===2008 – Present: Mike Smith/Matt Ryan era===
After the tumultuous and disappointing 2007 season, the Falcons made a number of moves, hiring a new General Manager and head coach, drafting a new starting quarterback, and signing a starting running back.

On January 13, 2008, the Falcons named former Patriots director of college football scouting [[Thomas Dimitroff]] General Manager.<ref>[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/People/Staff/Executive/Thomas_Dimitroff.aspx Atlantafalcons.com]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> On January 23, [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] defensive coach and former linebackers coach for the 2000 Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]] was named the Falcons' new head coach.<ref>[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/People/Coaches/Mike_Smith.aspx Atlantafalcons.com]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> Chargers back-up RB [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] agreed to a 6-year deal worth $30 million on March 2.<ref>[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/People/Players/Active/Michael_Turner.aspx Atlantafalcons.com]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> On April 26, [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] (quarterback from [[Boston College]]) was drafted third overall in the [[2008 NFL Draft]] by the Falcons.

====2008====
{{main|2008 Atlanta Falcons season}}
The Falcons finished the 2008 regular season with a record of 11–5, and the #5 seed in the playoffs.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/teams/atlantafalcons/statistics?team=ATL NFL.com]</ref> On December 21, 2008, Atlanta beat the Minnesota Vikings 24–17 to clinch a wild card spot, earning a trip to the playoffs for the first time since 2004. The Falcons would go on to lose in the wild-card round of the 2008 NFL playoffs to the eventual NFC champion [[2008 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]], 30–24.

Matt Ryan started all 16 games in his rookie season and was named the Associated Press Offensive Rookie of the Year.<ref>[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/People/Players/Active/Matt_Ryan.aspx Atlantafalcons.com]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>  First-year head coach Mike Smith was named 2008 NFL Coach of the Year.

====2009====
{{main|2009 Atlanta Falcons season}}
The Atlanta Falcons hold the record among all major American sports leagues for the longest streak of seasons without consecutive winning seasons, a streak that lasted from 1966–2008. Although they failed to make the playoffs in 2009, the streak ended when the team rallied to win their final three regular season games to record back-to-back winning seasons for the first time in franchise history. The Falcons defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 20–10 in the final game of the season to improve their record to 9–7.<ref name="atlantafalcons2"/>

====2010====
{{main|2010 Atlanta Falcons season}}
In 2010, with a regular season record of 13–3, their best regular season record since the [[1998 Super Bowl]] season, the Falcons secured a third straight winning season, their fourth overall divisional title, and the top overall seed in the NFC playoffs; however, the Falcons were overpowered by the eventual [[Super Bowl XLV]] champion [[Green Bay Packers]] in the NFC Divisional Playoffs 48–21. The Falcons scored 414 points – third-most in franchise history in 2010.<ref name="atlantafalcons2"/> The Falcons 2010–2011 team sent an NFL-high and franchise-best nine players to the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl.

====2011====
{{main|2011 Atlanta Falcons season}}
The Falcons made a surprise trade up with the [[Cleveland Browns]] in the [[2011 NFL Draft]] to select Alabama wide receiver [[Julio Jones]] sixth overall. In exchange, the Falcons gave up their first-, second- and fourth-round draft picks in 2011, and their first and fourth draft picks in 2012. Jones, along with teammates [[Tony Gonzalez (American football)|Tony Gonzalez]] and [[Roddy White]], have since been dubbed Atlanta's "Big Three" (based on their total number of reception yards).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/blog/nfl-rapidreports/21177209/atlantas-jacquizz-rodgers-emerging-as-falcons-top-back|title=Atlanta's Jacquizz Rodgers emerging as Falcons top back|last=Singer|first=Mike|date=28 November 2012|work=CBSSports.com|accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref> On August 30, 2011, [[Sports Illustrated]] senior writer [[Peter King (sportswriter)|Peter King]], who correctly predicted the 2011 Super Bowl, made his predictions for the 2011 season and picked the Falcons to defeat the San Diego Chargers in the 2012 Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1190002/index.htm?eref=mySI&eref=sisf | work=CNN | title=Galleries | date=September 5, 2011}}</ref> The Falcons finished the season at 10–6, securing the fifth seed after a Week 17 beatdown of Tampa Bay in which the Falcons pulled their starters after leading 42–0 just twenty-three minutes into the game.

The Falcons then went on to play the [[New York Giants]] in a 2011 NFC Wild Card Game at [[New Meadowlands Stadium|Metlife Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. The first half was a defensive struggle, with the first points coming off of a safety by the Falcons, giving Atlanta a 2–0 lead. In the 2nd quarter, though, [[Eli Manning]] connected with [[Hakeem Nicks]] for a short touchdown pass to make it 7–2 Giants heading into the 2nd half. Then the Giants took control, as Manning threw for two more TD passes to [[Mario Manningham]] and Nicks and the defense completed its shutout of the Falcons to give the [[New York Giants]] the win, 24–2, and the Falcons their third straight playoff loss with [[Matt Ryan]] and [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]]. After the season Defense Coordinator [[Brian VanGorder]] accepted a coaching job at [[Auburn University]], and the offensive coordinator [[Mike Mularkey]] took the head coaching job in Jacksonville.

====2012====
 {{main|2012 Atlanta Falcons season}}
Atlanta exploded out of the gate, going a franchise best 8–0 and remaining the last unbeaten team in the NFL that year. Their hopes to get an undefeated season came to an end with a 27–31 loss to the [[New Orleans Saints]]. Julio Jones had a remarkable second year, grabbing ten touchdowns and 1,198 yards. The Falcons finished the season 13–3, and clinched the number one seed in the NFC playoffs.

The Falcons played the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in their first playoff game. Although they went down 28–27 with only 31 seconds left on the clock, [[Matt Ryan]] led the team to their first playoff victory, 30–28. It was the first playoff victory in the Mike Smith era.

The Atlanta Falcons then advanced to face the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. The Falcons seized control of the game early with a [[Matt Bryant]] field goal, a trio of Matt Ryan touchdown passes caught by [[Julio Jones]] and [[Tony Gonzalez (tight end)|Tony Gonzalez]] coupled with outstanding defensive play. By the end of the half, the score was 24–14.The tides of the game began to shift in the second half as the 49ers rallied back with a pair of [[Frank Gore]] touchdown runs. Atlanta's offense attempted to reply but were ultimately shut down by the 49er defense. A few series later, late in the 4th quarter with little time remaining, Atlanta found themselves in a 4th and 7 situation at the 10-yard line. The Falcons needed just 10 more yards to secure victory and advance to their first Super Bowl berth in nearly 15 years. Matt Ryan fired a pass to [[Roddy White]] which was ultimately broken up by outside linebacker [[NaVorro Bowman]],  resulting in a 28–24 defeat.

[[Image:NFC-Throwback-Uniform-ATL.PNG|thumb|left|150px|Atlanta Falcons uniform: 1997–2002]]
When the team debuted in [[1966 Atlanta Falcons season|1966]], the Falcons wore red helmets with a black falcon crest logo. In the center of the helmet was a center black stripe surrounded by 2 gold stripes and 2 white stripes. These colors represented the two college rival schools in the state of Georgia; rival schools [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] (White and Gold) and the [[Georgia Bulldogs]] (Red and Black) Although the gold was later taken out, the white remains to this day. They wore white pants and either black or white jerseys. At first, the falcon crest logo was also put on the jersey sleeves, but it was replaced by a red and white stripe pattern four years later. They switched from black to red jerseys in 1971, and the club began to wear silver pants in 1978.

A prototype white helmet was developed for the team prior to the [[1974 Atlanta Falcons season|1974 season]] but was never worn.

In [[1990 Atlanta Falcons season|1990]], the uniform design changed to black helmets, silver pants, and either black or white jerseys. The numbers on the white jerseys were black, but were changed to red in [[1997 Atlanta Falcons season|1997]].<ref>[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/People/Alumni/Uniform_History.aspx "Falcons Uniform History"]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}, NFL</ref> (The red numerals could be seen on the away jerseys briefly in 1990.)

Both the logo and uniforms changed in [[2003 Atlanta Falcons season|2003]]. The logo was redesigned with red and silver accents to depict a more powerful, aggressive falcon, which now more closely resembles the capital letter ''F''.<ref>[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/fans/article.jsp?id=699 "Falcons Unveil New Logo"]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}, NFL</ref> Although the Falcons still wore black helmets, the new uniforms featured jerseys and pants with red trim down the sides. The uniform design consisted of either black or white jerseys, and either black or white pants. During that same year, a red alternate jersey with black trim was also introduced. The Falcons also started wearing black cleats with these uniforms.

In [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|2004]], the red jerseys became the primary jerseys, and the black ones became the alternate, both worn with white pants. In select road games, the Falcons wear black pants with white jerseys. The Falcons wore an all-black combination for home games against their archrivals, the [[New Orleans Saints]], winning the first two contests (24–21 in {{nfly|2004}} and 36–17 in {{nfly|2005}}), but losing 31–13 in {{nfly|2006}}. The Falcons wore the all black combination against the New Orleans Saints for 4 straight seasons starting in 2004, With the last time being in 2007, losing 34–14. They wore the combination again in 2006, against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in Week 2. The Falcons won that game, 14–3. The Falcons also wore their all-black uniform in 2007 against the New York Giants, and in 2008 against the Carolina Panthers and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (for the second time).

In the 1980s, the Falcons wore their white uniforms at home most of the time because of the heat. When the Falcons started playing in a dome, the team switched to their dark uniforms for home games but have worn their white uniforms at home a few times since switching to the dome.  It was announced at the 2009 state of the franchise meeting that the Falcons would wear 1966 throwback uniforms for a couple games during the 2009 season. The Atlanta Falcons wore 1966 throwback jerseys for 2 home games in 2009 – against the Carolina Panthers on September 20 and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 29. The Falcons won both of those games. They donned the throwbacks again for 2 games in 2010, against Baltimore and San Francisco, winning both of those games as well.

==Training Facilities==
The Falcons 78,000 square foot headquarters and training facilities or located on a 50-acre site in Flowery Branch, Ga.,<ref>Atlanta Falcons Headquarters & Training Facility http://www.exploregeorgia.org/Georgia/Attractions/Atlanta-Falcons-Headquarters-And-Training-Facility/20811</ref> the complex which was one of the first of its kind was completed in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boards.atlantafalcons.com/topic/3852493-the-history-of-falcons-training-camp-including/ |title=The history of Falcons training camp including – Falcons Life Forums |publisher=Boards.atlantafalcons.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03}}</ref><ref name="ponder1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ponder2.com/office-falcons.php |title=Ponder & Ponder, Architects – Norcross, Georgia |publisher=Ponder2.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03}}</ref> The Falcons’ corporate offices, state-of-the-art training and locker room facilities, a 140-seat auditorium and associated meeting rooms, are located in the two-story headquarters.

* Five dormitory-style units for players, coaches and administration.
* Each housing unit has living space that includes individual bedrooms, a common area, kitchen, and two bathrooms.
* Amenities building equipped with pool tables, a video room complete with a big screen television, and a large leisure area.
* The five dormitories are just beyond the practice fields for easy access for players and coaches to the locker room, meeting rooms and offices.

As of 2011, the Falcons' radio flagship station is [[WSTR (FM)|WSTR]] Star 94 FM, and [[WQXI (AM)|WQXI]] 790 AM "The Zone", previously held since 2006 by [[WZGC]] 92.9 "Dave FM." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ajc.com/radio-tv-talk/2011/03/07/790the-zonestar-94-becomes-new-falcons-radio-partners-cbs-atlanta-picks-up-pre-season-games/?cxntfid=blogs_radio_tv_talk|title=790/The Zone and Star 94 become new Falcons radio partners; CBS Atlanta picks up pre-season games|work=AJC}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2011/03/07/falcons-move-to-star-94-790-the-zone.html|title=Falcons move to Star 94, 790 The Zone|work=Atlanta Business Chronicle | date=March 7, 2011}}</ref> [[Wes Durham]], voice of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] and son of longtime [[North Carolina Tar Heels]] voice [[Woody Durham]], is the Falcons' play-by-play announcer. Preseason games not shown nationally television (except NBC-aired games) are seen on [[NBC]] affiliate [[WXIA]], also known as "11 Alive." In 2008, preseason games aired on [[WATL-TV]] due to WXIA's commitment to the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. Both stations are owned by [[Gannett Company]].

Fox affiliate [[WAGA-TV]] aired most preseason games through the 2004 season. WAGA continues to have a relationship with the Falcons as their primary broadcaster of regular season games (serving in this capacity since the Falcons started play), which dates back to when WAGA was a [[CBS]] affiliate and the NFL/NFC games were on CBS. WATL aired most Falcons games in 1994, as WAGA did not switch to Fox until December 1994.

Atlanta Falcons fans are more prevalent in western North Carolina due to the fact the Carolina Panthers only existed since 1996. Historically, they can be found generally west of Interstate 26 from Asheville to Murphy. East of Interstate 26 is considered a neutral zone, but the majority are Carolina Panthers fans.
