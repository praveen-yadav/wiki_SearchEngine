Currently, the '''People's Revolutionary Armed Forces''' (FARP) of '''[[Cape Verde]]''' are undergoing major reorganisation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The force has two independent branches, the Army and the Coast Guard. Both branches have their own air arm made up of mostly [[surveillance]] and transport aircraft. The combined force comprises about 1,200 soldiers, [[marine (military)|marines]] and [[coast guard]] personnel.

In the future, however, the military will be reduced to about 1,000 men. The Branches are to be reshuffled as well. The Army is going to be called the [[Cape Verdean National Guard]], and it will be divided into three semi-autonomous branches: 
#The Military Police, 
#[[Cape Verdean Marines|Os Fuzileiros]] ([[marine (military)|Marines]]), and
#the Infantry Battalion of the National Guard. 
A Special Operation Unit is being created and is going to be attached to the marine [[brigade]]. The Cape Verdean government aims to make the Armed Forces more flexible and able to deal with [[terrorism]], [[drug trafficking]], [[disaster relief]], and control its [[territorial waters]].

The former Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Solomon Passy]] proposed, Cape Verde may enter the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] and the [[NATO]].<ref>[http://davidnoack.net/v2/2010/01/sprungbrett-nach-westafrika sprungbrett-nach-westafrika]</ref>

Military equipment includes [[BRDM-2]] and [[T-55]] armoured vehicles, [[ZU-23-2]] and [[ZPU-4]] anti-aircraft guns, and [[AKM]]
and [[RPK]] small arms.

== Air Contingent ==
The Army also has its own air arm; after personnel training received from the [[USSR]] in 1982, three [[Antonov An-26]] aircraft were delivered to Cape Verde – these were believed to be the only military aircraft possessed by the nation.<ref>* ''World Aircraft Information Files.'' Brightstar Publishing, London. File 337 Sheet 02</ref> However these three aircraft were supplemented in 1991 by a [[Dornier Do 228]] light aircraft equipped for use by the Coastguard, and, in the late 1990s by an [[EMB-110]] aircraft from Brazil, similarly equipped for maritime operations. The government has been in negotiations with China to acquire multirole helicopters for both military and civilian use.
