The '''Chandrasekhar limit''' {{IPAc-en|tʃ|ʌ|n|d|r|ə|ˈ|ʃ|eɪ|k|ɑr}} is the maximum mass of a [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|stable]] [[white dwarf]] [[star]].  The limit was first published by [[Wilhelm Anderson]] and [[Edmund Clifton Stoner|E. C. Stoner]], and was named after [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], the Indian-American [[astrophysicist]] who improved upon the accuracy of the calculation in 1930, at the age of 19.  This limit was initially ignored by the community of scientists because such a limit would logically require the existence of black holes, which were considered a scientific impossibility at the time.  White dwarfs, unlike [[main sequence]] stars, resist [[gravitational collapse]] primarily through [[electron degeneracy pressure]], rather than [[Pressure#Pressure of an ideal gas|thermal pressure]].  The Chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction.  Consequently, white dwarfs with masses greater than the limit undergo further gravitational collapse, [[Stellar evolution|evolving]] into a different type of [[Compact star|stellar remnant]], such as a [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]].  Those with masses under the limit remain stable as white dwarfs.<ref name = DarkMatter> Sean Carroll, Ph.D., Cal Tech, 2007, The Teaching Company, ''Dark Matter, Dark Energy: The Dark Side of the Universe'', Guidebook Part 2 page 44, Accessed Oct. 7, 2013, “...Chandrasekhar limit: The maximum mass of a white dwarf star, about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.

==Physics==
Electron degeneracy pressure is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] effect arising from the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Since [[electron]]s are [[fermion]]s, no two electrons can be in the same state, so not all electrons can be in the minimum-energy level. Rather, electrons must occupy a band of energy levels. Compression of the electron gas increases the number of electrons in a given volume and raises the maximum energy level in the occupied band. Therefore, the energy of the electrons will increase upon compression, so pressure must be exerted on the electron gas to compress it, producing electron degeneracy pressure. With sufficient compression, electrons are forced into nuclei in the process of [[electron capture]], relieving the pressure.

In the nonrelativistic case, electron degeneracy pressure gives rise to an [[equation of state]] of the form <math>P = K_1 \rho^{5\over 3}</math>, where ''P'' is the [[pressure]], <math>\rho</math> is the [[mass density]], and <math>K_1</math> is a constant.  Solving the hydrostatic equation then leads to a model white dwarf which is a [[polytrope]] of index 3/2 and therefore has radius inversely proportional to the cube root of its mass, and volume inversely proportional to its mass.<ref name="chandra3">The Density of White Dwarf Stars, S. Chandrasekhar, ''Philosophical Magazine'' (7th series) '''11''' (1931), pp. 592–596.</ref>

As the mass of a model white dwarf increases, the typical energies to which degeneracy pressure forces the electrons are no longer negligible relative to their rest masses. The velocities of the electrons approach the speed of light, and [[special relativity]] must be taken into account. In the strongly relativistic limit, the equation of state takes the form <math>P = K_2 \rho^{4\over 3}</math>. This will yield a polytrope of index 3, which will have a total mass, M<sub>limit</sub> say, depending only on <var>K</var><sub>2</sub>.<ref name="chandra4">[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1931ApJ....74...81C The Maximum Mass of Ideal White Dwarfs], S. Chandrasekhar, ''Astrophysical Journal'' '''74''' (1931), pp. 81–82.</ref>

For a fully relativistic treatment, the equation of state used will interpolate between the equations <math>P = K_1 \rho^{5\over 3}</math> for small ρ and <math>P = K_2 \rho^{4\over 3}</math> for large ρ.
When this is done, the model radius still decreases with mass, but becomes zero at M<sub>limit</sub>. This is the Chandrasekhar limit.<ref name="chandra2"/>  The curves of radius against mass for the non-relativistic and relativistic models are shown in the graph. They are colored blue and green, respectively. μ<sub>e</sub> has been set equal to 2.
Radius is measured in standard solar radii<ref name="stds">[http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/doc/catstd-3.2.htx ''Standards for Astronomical Catalogues, Version 2.0''], section 3.2.2, web page, accessed 12-I-2007.</ref> or kilometers, and mass in standard solar masses.

==History==
In 1926, the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[physicist]] [[Ralph H. Fowler]] observed that the relationship among the density, energy and temperature of white dwarfs could be explained by viewing them as a gas of nonrelativistic, non-interacting electrons and nuclei which obeyed [[Fermi-Dirac statistics]].<ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1926MNRAS..87..114F On Dense Matter], R. H. Fowler, ''Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society'' '''87''' (1926), pp. 114–122.</ref>  This [[Fermi gas]] model was then used by the British physicist [[Edmund Clifton Stoner|E. C. Stoner]] in 1929 to calculate the relationship among the mass, radius, and density of white dwarfs, assuming them to be homogenous spheres.<ref>The Limiting Density of White Dwarf Stars, Edmund C. Stoner, ''Philosophical Magazine'' (7th series) '''7''' (1929), pp. 63–70.</ref> [[Wilhelm Anderson]] applied a relativistic correction to this model, giving rise to a maximum possible mass of approximately 1.37{{e|30}} kg.<ref>[http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01340146 Über die Grenzdichte der Materie und der Energie], Wilhelm Anderson, ''Zeitschrift für Physik'' '''56''', #11–12 (November 1929), pp. 851–856. DOI 10.1007/BF01340146.</ref> In 1930, Stoner derived the [[internal energy]]-[[density]] [[equation of state]] for a Fermi gas, and was then able to treat the mass-radius relationship in a fully relativistic manner, giving a limiting mass of approximately (for μ<sub>e</sub>=2.5) 2.19 · 10<sup>30</sup> kg.<ref>The Equilibrium of Dense Stars, Edmund C.

A series of papers published between 1931 and 1935 had its beginning on a trip from [[India]] to [[England]] in 1930,
where the [[ethnic Indian|Indian]] [[physicist]] [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] worked on the calculation of the statistics of a degenerate Fermi gas.<ref name="nasbio">[http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/schandrasekhar.html Chandrasekhar's biographical memoir at the National Academy of Sciences], web page, accessed 12-I-2007.</ref> In these papers, Chandrasekhar solved

'''1''' (1932), 285.</ref> who, however, did not apply it to white dwarfs.

Chandrasekhar's work on the limit aroused controversy, owing to the opposition of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[astrophysicist]] [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]]. Eddington was aware that the existence of [[black hole]]s was theoretically possible, and also realized that the existence of the limit made their formation possible. However, he was unwilling to accept that this could happen. After a talk by Chandrasekhar on the limit in 1935, he replied:

{{quote|The star has to go on radiating and radiating and contracting and contracting until, I suppose, it gets down to a few km radius, when gravity becomes strong enough to hold in the radiation, and the star can at last find peace. … I think there should be a law of Nature to prevent a star from behaving in this absurd way!|<ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1935Obs....58...33.

==Applications==
The core of a star is kept from collapsing by the heat generated by the [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of lighter [[chemical element|elements]] into heavier ones. At various stages of [[stellar evolution]], the nuclei required for this process will be exhausted, and the core will collapse, causing it to become denser and hotter. A critical situation arises when [[iron]] accumulates in the core, since iron nuclei are incapable of generating further energy through fusion. If the core becomes sufficiently dense, electron degeneracy pressure will play a significant part in stabilizing it against gravitational collapse.<ref name="evo2">[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002RvMP...74.1015W The evolution and explosion of massive stars], S. E. Woosley, A. Heger, and T. A. Weaver, ''Reviews of Modern Physics'' '''74''', #4 (October 2002), pp. 1015–1071.</ref>

If a main-sequence star is not too massive (less than approximately 8 [[solar mass]]es), it will eventually shed enough mass to form a white dwarf having mass below the Chandrasekhar limit, which will consist of the former core of the star. For more massive stars, electron degeneracy pressure will not keep the iron core from collapsing to very great density, leading to formation of a [[neutron star]], [[black hole]], or, speculatively, a [[quark star]].  (For very massive, low-[[metallicity]] stars, it is also possible that instabilities will destroy the star completely.)<ref name="ifmr1">[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996A%26A...313..810K White dwarfs in open clusters.

[[Type Ia supernova]]e derive their energy from runaway fusion of the nuclei in the interior of a [[white dwarf]]. This fate may befall [[carbon]]-[[oxygen]] white dwarfs that accrete matter from a companion [[giant star]], leading to a steadily increasing mass. It has been inferred that as the white dwarf's mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, its central density increases, and, as a result of [[compression (physical)|compression]]al heating, its temperature also increases. This results in an increasing rate of [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactions, eventually igniting a [[thermonuclear]] flame ([[carbon detonation]]) which causes the supernova.<ref name="sniamodels">[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ARA&A..38..191H Type IA Supernova Explosion Models], Wolfgang Hillebrandt and Jens C. Niemeyer, ''Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics'' '''38''' (2000), pp. 191–230.</ref><sup>, §5.1.2</sup>

A strong indication of the reliability of Chandrasekhar's formula is that the absolute magnitudes of supernovae of Type Ia are all approximately the same; at maximum luminosity, M<sub>V</sub> is approximately -19.3, with a [[standard deviation]] of no more than 0.3.<ref name="sniamodels"/><sup>, (1)</sup>  A [[Confidence interval|1-sigma interval]] therefore represents a factor of less than 2 in luminosity. This seems to indicate that all type Ia supernovae convert approximately the same amount of mass to energy.

==Super-Chandrasekhar mass Supernovae==
{{main|SN 2003fg|l1=Champagne Supernova}}
In April 2003, the [[Supernova Legacy Survey]] observed a type Ia supernova, designated [[SNLS-03D3bb]], in a galaxy approximately 4 billion [[light year]]s away. According to a group of astronomers at the [[University of Toronto]] and elsewhere, the observations of this supernova are best explained by assuming that it arose from a white dwarf which grew to twice the mass of the [[Sun]] before exploding. They believe that the star, dubbed the "[[SN 2003fg|Champagne Supernova]]" by University of Oklahoma astronomer David R. Branch, may have been spinning so fast that [[Centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] allowed it to exceed the limit. Alternatively, the supernova may have resulted from the merger of two white dwarfs, so that the limit was only violated momentarily. Nevertheless, they point out that this observation poses a challenge to the use of type Ia supernovae as [[standard candles]].<ref>[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-09/dbnl-twt092006.php The weirdest Type Ia supernova yet], LBL press release, web page accessed 13-I-2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Champagne_Supernova_Challenges_Ideas_about_How_Supernovae_Work_999.html Champagne Supernova Challenges Ideas about How Supernovae Work], web page, spacedaily.com, accessed 13-I-2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7109/abs/nature05103.html The type Ia supernova SNLS-03D3bb from a super-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf star], D.

Since the observation of the Champagne Supernova in 2003, more very bright type Ia [[supernova]]e are thought to have originated by [[white dwarf]]s whose masses exceeded the Chandrasekhar limit. These include [[SN 2006gz]], [[SN 2007if]] and [[SN 2009dc]].<ref name="Machisu">{{cite journal|last=Hachisu|first=Izumi|coauthors=Kato, M. et al.|title=A single degenerate progenitor model for type Ia supernovae highly exceeding the Chandrasekhar mass limit|bibcode=2012ApJ...744...69H|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/744/1/69|arxiv=1106.3510|volume=744|issue=1|year=2012|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|at=Article ID 69}}</ref> The super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs that have originated these supernovae are believed to have had masses up to 2.4–2.8 [[solar mass]]es.<ref name="Machisu" /> One way to potentially explain the problem of the Champagne Supernova was considering it the result of an aspherical explosion of a white dwarf. However, spectropolarimetric observations of [[SN 2009dc]] showed it had a [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] smaller than 0.3, making the large asphericity theory unlikely.<ref name="Machisu" />

==Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit==

After a supernova explosion, a [[neutron star]] may be left behind.  Like white dwarfs these objects are extremely compact and are supported by degeneracy pressure, but a neutron star is so massive and compressed that electrons and protons have combined to form neutrons, and the star is thus supported by neutron degeneracy pressure instead of electron degeneracy pressure.  The limit of neutron degeneracy pressure, analogous to the Chandrasekhar limit, is known as the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]].
