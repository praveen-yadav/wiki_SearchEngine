{{Politics of Armenia}}
Since its independence, '''Armenia''' has maintained a policy of complementarism by trying to have friendly relations both with [[Iran]], Russia, and the West, including the United States and Europe.<ref>[http://times.am/2010/03/29/armenian-foreign-policy-between-russia-iran-and-u-s/ – "Armenian Foreign Policy Between Russia, Iran And U.S." – 29 March 2010]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> However, the dispute over the [[Armenian Genocide]] and the recent war over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] have created tense relations with two of its immediate neighbors, [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Turkey]]. Armenia is a member of more than 40 different international organizations including the United Nations, the [[Council of Europe]], the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]], [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]], the [[North Atlantic Cooperation Council]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], the [[World Trade Organization]] and [[La Francophonie]]. It is also an observer member of the [[Eurasian Economic Community]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. [[Eduard Nalbandyan]] currently serves as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Armenia)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] of Armenia.

==Armenian Genocide recognition==

Parliaments of countries that recognize the Armenian genocide include [[Argentina]], Armenia, [[Austria]], Belgium, Canada, Chile, [[Cyprus]], France, Germany, Greece, [[Italy]], Lebanon, [[Lithuania]], the [[Netherlands]], Poland, [[Russia]], Slovakia, [[Sweden]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Owe Nilsson/TT |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/riksdagen-erkande-folkmord-pa-armenier-1.1059812 |title=Riksdagen erkände folkmord på armenier |publisher=DN.SE |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> [[Switzerland]], [[Uruguay]], [[Vatican City]] and [[Venezuela]]; additionally, some regional governments of countries recognize the Armenian genocide too, such as [[New South Wales]] in Australia and [[Wales]] in the United Kingdom. [[US House Resolution 106]] was introduced on 30 January 2007, and later referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. The bill currently has 225 co-sponsors.<ref>[http://www3.capwiz.com/y/issues/bills/?billnum=H.RES.106&congress=110 ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> The bill called for former President [[George W. Bush]] to recognize and use the word genocide in his annual 24 April speech which he never used. His successor President [[Barack Obama]] has expressed his desire to recognize the Armenian Genocide during the electoral campaigns, but after being elected, has not used the word genocide in his first annual 24 April speech in 2009.

==Disputes==

===Nagorno-Karabakh/Azerbaijan===
{{see also|Nagorno-Karabakh conflict}}
[[Armenia]] supports ethnic Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of [[Azerbaijan]] in the longstanding and very bitter separatist conflict against the Azerbaijani Government.

The current conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) began in 1988 when Armenian demonstrations against Azerbaijani rule broke out in both Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh [[Supreme Soviet]] voted to secede from Azerbaijan and join Armenia. Soon, violence broke out against ethnic Azeris in Armenia and ethnic Armenians in Azerbaijan. In 1990, after violent episodes in Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, [[Baku]] and [[Sumgait]], Moscow declared a state of emergency in Karabakh, sent troops to the region, and [[Black January|forcibly occupied Baku]], killing over a hundred civilians. In April 1991, Azerbaijani militia and Soviet forces targeted Armenian paramilitaries operating in Karabakh. Moscow also deployed troops to [[Yerevan]]. Following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], conflict escalated into a full-scale war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Military action was heavily influenced by the Russian military, which inspired and manipulated the rivalry between the two neighbouring nations in order to keep both under control.

More than 30,000 people were killed in the fighting from 1992 to 1994. In May 1992, Armenian forces seized [[Shusha]] and [[Lachin]] (thereby linking Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia). By October 1993, Armenian forces succeeded in occupying almost all of former NKAO, Lachin and large areas in southwestern Azerbaijan. In 1993, the [[UN Security Council]] adopted [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions on the Nagorno-Karabakh War|four resolutions]] calling for the cessation of hostilities, unimpeded access for international humanitarian relief efforts, and the eventual deployment of a peacekeeping force in the region. Fighting continued, however, until May 1994 when [[Russia]] brokered a cease-fire.

Negotiations to resolve the conflict peacefully have been ongoing since 1992 under the aegis of the Minsk Group of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]]. The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by Russia, France, and the United States and has representation from [[Turkey]], the U.S., several European nations, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Despite the 1994 cease-fire, sporadic violations, [[sniper]]-fire and [[land mine|landmine]] incidents continue to claim over 100 lives each year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Since 1997, the Minsk Group Co-Chairs have presented three proposals to serve as a framework for resolving the conflict. One side or the other rejected each of those proposals. Beginning in 1999, the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia initiated a direct dialogue through a series of face-to-face meetings, often facilitated by the Minsk Group Co-Chairs. Most recently the OSCE sponsored a round of negotiations between the Presidents in [[Key West]], Florida. U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] launched the talks on 3 April 2001, and the negotiations continued with mediation by the U.S., Russia and France until 6 April 2001. The Co-Chairs are continuing to work with the two Presidents in the hope of finding a lasting peace.

The two countries are still technically at war. Citizens of the Republic of Armenia, as well as citizens of any other country who are of [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian descent]], are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan. If a person's passport shows any evidence of travel to Nagorno-Karabakh, they are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan.<ref>[http://www.ncsj.org/Azerbaijan.shtml Azerbaijan Country Page].

In 2008, in what became known as the [[2008 Mardakert Skirmishes]], Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed over Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting between the two sides was brief, with few casualties on either side.<ref name="regnum.ru">{{cite news | url= http://www.regnum.ru/english/943595.html | title= Azerbaijani president: Armenians are guests in Yerevan | publisher= [[REGNUM News Agency]] | date=2008-01-17 | accessdate=2010-04-21}}</ref>

Greece was one of the first countries to recognize Armenia's independence on 21 September 1991, and one of those that have officially recognized the Armenian Genocide. Since the independence of Armenia the two countries have been partners within the framework of international organizations (United Nations, OSCE, Council of Europe, BSEC), whilst Greece firmly supports the community programs aimed at further developing relations between the EU and Armenia.

Continuous visits of the highest level have shown that both countries want to continue to improve the levels of friendship and cooperation (Visit by the President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrossian to Greece in 1996, visit by the President of the Hellenic Republic Costis Stephanopoulos in 1999, visit by the President of Armenia Robert Kocharyan to Greece in 2000 and 2005 and visit by Greek president [[Karolos Papoulias]] to Armenia in June 2007).

Greece is, after Russia, the major military partner of Armenia. Armenian officers are trained in Greek military academies, and various technical assistance is supplied by Greece. Since 2003, an Armenian platoon has been deployed in Kosovo as part of [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]], where they operate as a part of the Greek battalion of KFOR.

Armenia's most notable recent foreign policy success came with the 29 August treaty with Russia on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance, in which Moscow committed itself to the defense of Armenia should it be attacked by a third party. Russia is the key regional security player, and has proved a valuable historical ally for Armenia. Although it appeared as a response to Aliyev's US trip, the treaty had probably long been under development. However, it is clear from the wider context of Armenian foreign policy that—while Yerevan welcomes the Russian security guarantee—the country does not want to rely exclusively on Moscow, nor to become part of a confrontation between Russian and US-led alliances in the Transcaucasus.

Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize Armenia's independence in 1991. Despite this, for most of the 20th century and early 21st century, relations remain tense and there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries for numerous reasons. Some bones of contention include the unresolved Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan (which has resulted in Turkey imposing a blockade on Armenia that is still in effect today), the treatment of Armenians in Turkey, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, and the Armenian claim of Turkey's holding of historic Armenian lands (ceded to them in the [[Treaty of Kars]], a treaty which Armenia refuses to recognize to this day since it was signed between the Soviet Union and Turkey, and not between Armenia and Turkey proper). At the forefront of all disputes, however, is the issue surrounding the Armenian Genocide. The killing and deportation of between one and one-and-a-half million Armenians from eastern [[Anatolia]]n lands of the [[Ottoman Empire]] orchestrated by the [[Young Turks]] is a taboo subject in Turkey itself as the Turkish government refuses to acknowledge that a genocide ever happened. However, since Turkey has become a candidate to join the European Union, limited discussion of the event is now taking place in Turkey. Some in the European Parliament have even suggested that one of the provisions for Turkey to join the E.U. should be the full recognition of the event as genocide.

On 5 June 2005, Armenian President Robert Kocharian announced that he was ready to "continue dialogue with Azerbaijan for the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and with Turkey on establishing relations without any preconditions."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=18307 |title=Yerevan Ready to Continue Dialogue with Baku for Karabakh Settlement |publisher=Panarmenian.net |date=5 June 2006 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> Armenia has also stated that as a legal successor to the [[Armenian SSR]], it is loyal to the Treaty of Kars and all agreements inherited by the former Soviet Armenian government.<ref>{{cite news

In the wake of the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] between Russia and Georgia, Armenia and Turkey have shown signs of an inclination to reconsider their relationship. According to ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine, 70% of Armenia's imports enter via Georgia. Because of the apparently belligerent posture of the Russian state, economic ties with Turkey appear especially attractive.<ref>"Turkey and Armenia; Friends and Neighbors, rising hopes of better relations between two historic enemies", ''The Economist'', 27 September 2008, p. 67.</ref>

|{{flag|Azerbaijan}}||<!--Date Started--> No diplomatic relations
||See [[Armenia–Azerbaijan relations]], [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], [[Khojaly Massacre]], [[Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan]]
The two nations have fought two wars in [[Armenian–Azerbaijani War|1918–20 (Armenian–Azerbaijani War)]] and in [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|1988–94 (Nagorno-Karabakh War)]], in the past century, with last one ended with provisional [[Bishkek Protocol|cease fire agreement signed in Bishkek]]. There are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, because of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and dispute. 
The neighboring nations of Armenia and Azerbaijan have had formal governmental relations since 1918. The two nations have fought two wars in [[Armenian–Azerbaijani War|1918–20]] and in [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|1988–94]] in the past century, with last one ended with provisional [[Bishkek Protocol|cease fire agreement signed in Bishkek]]. 
During the Soviet period, many Armenians and Azeris lived side by side in peace. However, when [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the policies of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]], the majority of Armenians from the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] began a movement to unify with the [[Armenian SSR]]. In 1988, the Armenians of Karabakh voted to secede and join Armenia. This, along with sporadic massacres in Azerbaijan against Armenians resulted in the conflict that became known as the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. The violence resulted in ''de facto'' Armenian control of former NKAO and seven surrounding Azerbaijani regions which was effectively halted when both sides agrees to observe a cease-fire which has been in effect since May 1994, and in late 1995 both also agreed to mediation of the [[OSCE Minsk Group]]. The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by the U.S., France and Russia, and comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and several Western European nations. Despite the cease fire, up to 40 clashes are reported along the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict lines of control each year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The two countries are still technically at war. Citizens of the Republic of Armenia, as well as citizens of any other country who are of [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian descent]], are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan.<ref name="panarmenian.net"/> If a person's passport shows any evidence of travel to Nagorno-Karabakh, they are forbidden to enter the Republic of Azerbaijan.<ref>[http://www.ncsj.org/Azerbaijan.shtml Azerbaijan Country Page]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}.

|{{flag|Georgia}}||<!--start date --> 1992-07-17
||See [[Armenia–Georgia relations]]

Armenians and Georgians have a lot in common. Both are ancient Christian civilizations with their own distinct alphabets. Both use the terms "Apostolic" and "Orthodox" in the full titles of their respective churches. They also use the term "[[Catholicos]]" to refer to their church patriarchs. Despite all this, however, Armenians and Georgians have tended to have a tenuous relationship (at times, sharing close bonds while at other times regarding each other as rivals).

Today, relations with Georgia are of particular importance for Armenia because, under the economic blockade imposed by Turkey and Azerbaijan due to the ongoing [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Karabakh conflict]], Georgia offers Armenia its only land connection with Europe and access to its [[Black Sea]] ports. However, because of Armenia's reliance on Russia and Georgia, both of whom fought the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] and severed diplomatic and economic relations as a result; and as 70% of Armenia's imports entered via Georgia especially from Russia which has imposed an economic blockade on Georgia, Armenia also has been indirectly affected from this blockade as well. The development of close relations between Turkey and Georgia (such as the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline]] and [[South Caucasus Pipeline|South Caucasus natural gas pipeline]]) have also weighed on the mutual relations and lead to the prevention of the country recognizing the Armenian Genocide. On occasion, however, Georgian politicians have sympathized with the Armenian cause. For example, on 20 March 2006, Georgian Ambassador to Armenia [[Revaz Gachechiladze]] stated, "We sympathize with the sister nation but taking decisions of the kind we should take into account the international situation. When the time comes Georgia will do everything within the limits of the possible for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the international community including Georgia."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=16958 |title="When Time Comes Georgia Will Do Its Best for Armenian Genocide Recognition" – 20 March 2006 |publisher=Panarmenian.Net |date=20 March 2006 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> However, Armenian-Georgian relations have begun to improve. On 10 May 2006, Armenia and Georgia agreed on the greater part of the lines of the state border between the two countries.<ref>[http://www.arka.am/en/archive/n05/n1005/100510.html Armenia, Georgia Agree On Greater Part of Border Lines]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> The [[Samtskhe-Javakheti|Javakheti]] region in southern Georgia contains a large Armenian population and although there have been local civic organizations (such as [[United Javakhk]]) pushing for autonomy, there has been no violence between Armenians and Georgians in the area.

The first Armenians migrated to Australia in the 1850s, during the gold rush.
The majority came to Australia in the 1960s, starting with the Armenians of Egypt after Nasser came to power then, in the early 1970s, from Cyprus after the Turkish occupation of the island and from 1975 until 1992, a period of civil unrest in Lebanon.
Person-to-person governmental links are increasing although they are still modest. In September 2003, The Hon Mr Philip Ruddock MP visited Armenia in his former capacity as Australian Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. In October 2005, the Armenian Foreign Minister, H.E. Mr [[Vardan Oskanyan]], visited Australia. In November 2005, The Hon Mr Joe Hockey MP, Minister for Human Services, visited Armenia.
The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia refuses to recognise the mass murder of Armenians in 1915 as Genocide, although the State of N.S.W passed a law recognising this several years earlier. The Australian Government elections of 2007 created an atmosphere in which the Opposition Labor party declared it will push for the Recognition of the Armenian Genocide in Australian Parliament if Labor wins the Elections.
