In [[Cape Verde]], most of the transportation between islands is done by plane. There are regular flights to and from the major islands (Santiago, Sal and São Vicente), with less frequent flights to the other islands. Boat transportation is also available, though not widely used nor dependable. In the major cities, public bus transport runs periodically and taxis are common. In smaller towns, there are mostly hiaces and/or taxis.<ref name=pc>[http://www.peacecorps.gov/welcomebooks/cvwb655.pdf ''The Peace Corps Welcomes You to Cape Verde'']. [[Peace Corps]] (April 2006).

== Types of transport ==
'''[[Railway]]s:'''
0&nbsp;km - There are no railways in Cape Verde, although there was a short overhead conveyor system for salt from the open salt lake on Sal to the port at [[Pedro de Lume]] and a short stretch of rail track to the pier at [[Santa Maria, Cape Verde|Santa Maria]] used for a similar purpose. Both are now disused.

'''Roadways:'''
<br />''total:''
10,000&nbsp;km including unpaved tracks accessible only to four wheel drive vehicles
<br />''asphalt:''
360&nbsp;km
<br />''cobbled:''
5,000&nbsp;km (2007 estimates)

The majority of Cape Verdean roads are paved with cobblestones cut from local [[basalt]]. Recent international aid has allowed the asphalting of a few roads, such as part of the highway between [[Tarrafal, Cape Verde|Tarrafal]] and [[Praia]] on [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] and the dual carriageway between [[Santa Maria, Cape Verde|Santa Maria]] and [[Espargos]] on Sal. A new ring road has been built from [[Praia International Airport]] around the city of Praia.

The primary method of intercity and inter-village transport for Cape Verdeans is by [[aluguer]] shared taxis, commonly called ''Iass''. Few Cape Verdeans own cars, but ownership is rising rapidly with increasing prosperity, particularly on [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago Island]].

'''Ports and [[harbor]]s:'''
[[Mindelo]] on [[São Vicente, Cape Verde|São Vicente]] is the main port for cruise liners and the terminus for the ferry service to Santo Antão. A marina for yachts is undergoing enlargement (2007). [[Praia]] on [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] is a main hub for local ferry services to other islands. [[Palmeira, Cape Verde|Palmeira]] on [[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal]] supplies fuel for the main airport on the island, [[Amílcar Cabral International Airport]], and is important for the hotel construction taking place on the island. [[Porto Novo, Cape Verde|Porto Novo]] on [[Santo Antão, Cape Verde|Santo Antão]] is the only source for imports and exports of produce from the island as well as passenger traffic since the closure of the airstrip at Ponta do Sol. There are smaller harbors, essentially single jetties at [[Tarrafal de São Nicolau, Cape Verde (municipality)#Tarrafal de São Nicolau (town)|Tarrafal]] on [[São Nicolau, Cape Verde|São Nicolau]], [[Sal Rei]] on [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]], [[Vila do Maio, Cape Verde|Vila do Maio]] (Porto Inglês) on [[Maio, Cape Verde|Maio]], [[São Filipe, Cape Verde (municipality)#São Filipe(city)|São Filipe]] on [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]] and [[Furna (Brava), Cape Verde|Furna]] on [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]]. These act as terminals for the inter island ferry services which carry both freight and passengers. There are very small harbors, with protective breakwaters, essentially used by fishing boats at Tarrafal on Santiago, Pedra de Lume on Sal and Ponta do Sol on Santo Antão. Some offer suitable protection for small yachts on passage. The pier at Santa Maria on Sal used by both fishing and dive boats has been rehabilitated.
