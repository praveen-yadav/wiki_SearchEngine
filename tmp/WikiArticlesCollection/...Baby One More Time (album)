'''''...Baby One More Time''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by American recording artist [[Britney Spears]]. It was released on January 12, 1999, by [[Jive Records]]. In June 1997, while Spears negotiated with manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join female pop group [[Innosense]], her mother asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] [[karaoke]] song. Rudolph decided to pitch her to record labels, sending them a demo tape with an unused song from [[Toni Braxton]]. Jive was interested and appointed the singer to work with producer Eric Foster White. After hearing the recorded material, Jive signed Spears to a multi-album deal.

Spears traveled to Sweden to work with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz Pop]] and [[Rami Yacoub]], among others. Martin showed Spears and her management a track titled "Hit Me Baby One More Time", which was originally written for American R&B group [[TLC (band)|TLC]]; however, they rejected the track. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when she heard it and knew it was going to be a hit record. By June 1998, the album had been finished.

Critics gave the album mixed reviews, describing the singer as a [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] next door, considering it silly and premature. The album was successful on the charts, reaching the top five in several countries, while reaching number one in Canada and the United States. It also received several certifications around the world, including a [[RIAA certification|fourteen-times platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), for shipments of over 12 million units in the country. ''...Baby One More Time'' is Spears' most successful album, selling over 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]] and the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist.

Five singles came from the album. "[[...Baby One More Time]]" became a worldwide success and one of the [[List of best-selling singles worldwide|best-selling singles of all time]], at over ten million copies. The album was promoted with appearances on live television, and also by the [[...Baby One More Time Tour]] in 1999, with a second leg titled [[...Baby One More Time Tour|Crazy 2k Tour]] in 2000. Spears claimed she wasn't able to explore her vocal ability on the album. This album set Spears' international [[Pop icon|pop culture icon]] image and launched her career. The album earned Spears [[Grammy]] nominations for [[Best New Artist]] and [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for "...Baby One More Time."

In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided to pitch her to record labels, which required a professional [[demo (music)|demo]]. He sent Spears an unused song from Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded in a studio with a [[Audio engineering|sound engineer]]. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] and the [[Spice Girls]], and "there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another [[Debbie Gibson]] or another [[Tiffany (singer)|Tiffany]]." Two weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph.<ref name="hughes145">{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=145}}</ref> Senior vice president of [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] Jeff Fenster stated, "It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal.

==Composition==

Spears had originally envisioned "[[Sheryl Crow]] music, but younger more adult contemporary", but felt all right with her label's producers, since "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me."<ref name="rs1" /> The album opens with the first single "[[...Baby One More Time]]", a [[teen pop]] and [[dance-pop]] song that begins with a three-note [[motif (music)|motif]] in the bass range of the [[piano]]. The opening was compared to many other songs, such as "[[We Will Rock You]]" (1977), "[[Start Me Up]]" (1981) and the theme song of the film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' due to the fact the track "makes its presence known in exactly one second".<ref name="blender" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdVPE.asp?ppn=MN0027207|title=Britney Spears Baby One More Time - Sheet Music|work=Music Notes|publisher=[[Alfred Music Publishing]]|accessdate=November 21, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/baby-one-more-time-us-cd-single-r377377|title=...Baby One More Time (US CD Single) - Britney Spears|publisher=[[Allmusic]].

"I Will Be There" features a guitar riff similar to [[Natalie Imbruglia]]'s "[[Torn (Natalie Imbruglia song)|Torn]]" (1997), with a "rousing chorus about standing by your man (or a best friend or a house pet)", as noted by Kyle Anderson of [[MTV]].

Spears was credited with leading the revival of [[teen pop]].

Spears became an international [[pop icon|pop culture icon]] immediately after launching her recording career.
