The '''BeBox''' was a short-lived dual processor [[personal computer]], offered by [[Be Inc.]] to run the company's own [[operating system]], [[BeOS]]. Notable aspects of the system include its CPU configuration, I/O board with "GeekPort", and "[[Blinkenlights]]" on the front bezel.

The BeBox made its debut in October 1995 (BeBox Dual603-66). The processors were upgraded to 133&nbsp;MHz in August 1996 (BeBox Dual603e-133). Production was halted in January 1997,<ref>[http://www.bebox.nu/history.php?s=history/1997 BeBox History] The BeBox Zone</ref> following the port of BeOS to the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], in order for the company to concentrate on software. Be sold around 1000 66&nbsp;MHz BeBoxes and 800 133&nbsp;MHz BeBoxes.

== CPU configuration ==

Initial prototypes were equipped with two [[AT&T Hobbit]] processors and three AT&T 9308S [[digital signal processor|DSP]]s.

Production models used two [[PowerPC 600#PowerPC 603|PowerPC 603]] [[Central processing unit|processors]] running at 66 or 133 [[Hertz|MHz]] to power the BeBox. Prototypes having dual 200&nbsp;MHz CPUs or four CPUs exist, but these were never publicly available.<ref>[http://www.bebox.nu/news.php?lookat=65] Interview with Joseph Palmer</ref>

== I/O board ==
[[File:BeBox.Le dos.jpg|thumb|connectors of the I/O board]]
* Four serial ports (9-pin D-shell)
* One mouse port, PS/2-type
* Two joystick ports (15-pin D-shell)
* Two MIDI out ports
* Two MIDI in ports
* Three infrared (IR) I/O ports (6-pin mini DIN)
* One internal CD audio line-level input (5-pin strip)
* One internal microphone audio input (4-pin strip)
* One internal headphone audio output (4-pin strip)
* Two line-level RCA inputs (L/R)
* Two line-level outputs (L/R)
* One microphone input 3.5&nbsp;mm stereo phono jack
* One headphone output 3.5&nbsp;mm stereo phono jack
* A 16-bit stereo sound system @ 48 and 44.1&nbsp;kHz
* One "GeekPort" (37-pin D-shell)
** An experimental-electronic-development oriented port, backed by three fuses on the mainboard.
** Digital and analog [[Input/output|I/O]] and [[Direct current|DC power]] connector, 37-pin connector on the [[ISA bus]].
** Two independent, bidirectional 8-bit ports
** Four A/D pins routing to a 12-bit [[Analog-to-digital converter|A/D converter]]
** Four D/A pins connected to an independent 8-bit [[Digital-to-analog converter|D/A converter]]
** Two signal [[ground (electricity)|ground]] reference pins
** Eleven power and ground pins:
*** Two at +5 V, one at +12 V, one at -12 V, seven ground pins.

== "Blinkenlights" ==

Two yellow/green vertical LED arrays, dubbed the "[[blinkenlights]]", were built into the front bezel to illustrate the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] load. The bottommost LED on the right side indicated hard disk activity.
