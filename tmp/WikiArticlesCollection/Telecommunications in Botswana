'''Communications in Botswana'''

{{Refimprove|date=March 2007}}

A [[fiber-optic]] telecommunications network has been completed in [[Botswana]] connecting all major population centers.

In addition to the government-owned newspaper and national [[radio]] network, there is an active, independent [[mass media|press]] (six weekly newspapers). Two privately owned radio stations began operations in 1999. At the end of July 2000, the government-owned Botswana Television (BTV) was launched, which is Botswana's first national television station. It began broadcasting with 3 hours of programming on weekdays and 5 on weekends, and offers news ([[Setswana]] and [[English language|English]]), entertainment, and [[sport]]s, with plans eventually to produce 60% of its programming locally. Foreign publications are sold without restriction in Botswana, and there are three commercial [[Internet service provider]]s. Two [[cellular phone]] providers cover most of the country.
