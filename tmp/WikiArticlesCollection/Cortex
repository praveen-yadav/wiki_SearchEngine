* [[Cortical inheritance]], structural inheritance was discovered by Tracy Sonneborn, and other researchers, during his study on protozoa in the late 1930s
* [[Cortical lobule]], a part of a renal lobe. It consists of the nephrons grouped around a single medullary ray, and draining into a single collecting duct
* [[Cortical magnification]], describes how many neurons in an area of the visual cortex are 'responsible' for processing a stimulus of a given size, as a function of visual field location
* [[Cortical map]], collections (areas) of minicolumns in the brain cortex that have been identified as performing a specific information processing function (texture maps, color maps, contour maps, etc.)
* [[Cortical minicolumn]], a vertical column through the cortical layers of the brain, comprising perhaps 80â€“120 neurons, except in the primate primary visual cortex (V1), where there are typically more than twice the number
* [[Cortical pseudolaminar necrosis]], the (uncontrolled) death of cells in (cerebral) cortex of the brain in a band-like pattern, with a relative perservation of cells immediately adjacent to the meninges
* [[Cortical reaction]], occurs when a sperm cell unites with the egg's plasma membrane, altering the zona pellucida which prevents other sperm from binding to and entering the egg
* [[Cortical stimulation mapping]], a type of electrocorticography which is used a method to determine the location in the brain where information of a certain kind is processed
