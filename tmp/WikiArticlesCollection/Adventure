An '''adventure''' is an exciting or unusual experience. It may also be a bold, usually [[risk]]y undertaking, with an uncertain outcome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adventure |title=Adventure |work=dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}</ref> Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as [[skydiving]], [[mountain climbing]],[[river rafting]]  or participating in [[extreme sports]]. The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial or psychological risk, such as a business venture, a love affair, or other major life undertakings.

Adventurous experiences create psychological  [[arousal]],<ref>{{citation |url=http://books.google.com/?id=6YjcgAn8TfsC&pg=PA187 |title=On the psychobiology of personality |chapter=Sensation Seeking and Participation in Physical Risk Sports |author=M Gomà-i-Freixanet |year=2004 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-044209-9 |page=187}}</ref> which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. [[fear]]) or positive (e.g. [[flow (psychology)|flow]]), and which can be detrimental as stated by the [[Yerkes-Dodson law]].  For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer [[André Malraux]], in his ''La Condition Humaine'' (1933), "If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?".{{full|date=June 2013}} Similarly, [[Helen Keller]] stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."<ref>{{cite book|last=Keller|first=Helen|title=The Open Door|year=1957}}</ref>

Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of [[recreation]] or [[excitement]]: examples are  [[adventure racing]] and [[Adventure travel|adventure tourism]]. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers. [[Adventure education]] intentionally uses challenging experiences for [[learning]].

==Adventure in mythology==
Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[The Odyssey]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/books/review/Mansbach-t.html|title=Odysseus Remixed|author=Adam Mansbach|date=February 12, 2010|newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Jenkyns |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/31/reviews/fagles-odyssey.html |title=Heroic Enterprise – (Book review: The Odyssey translated by Robert Fagles) |publisher=nytimes.com |date=1996-12-22 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}</ref><ref>Zweig, P. (1974). ''The adventurer: The fate of adventure in the Western world'', New York: Basic Books.</ref> Mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] discussed his notion of the [[monomyth]] in his book, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. Campbell proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the "call to adventure", followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph. 
The [[knight errant]] was the form the "adventure seeker" character took in the late Middle Ages.
The [[adventure novel]] exhibits these "protagonist on adventurous journey" characteristics as do many popular feature films, such as ''[[Star Wars]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/26/movies/moviesspecial/26STAR.html|title=A Trip to a Far Galaxy That's Fun and Funny|author=Vincent Canby|date=May 26, 1977|newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}</ref> and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173AA42CA1494CC6B6799D836896|title=Movie Review: Raiders of the Lost Ark|author=Vincent Canby|date=June 12, 1981|newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}</ref>
