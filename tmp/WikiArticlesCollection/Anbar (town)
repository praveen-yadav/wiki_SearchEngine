'''Anbar''' ('''{{lang|ar|الأنبار}}''') was a town in [[Iraq]], at lat. 33 deg.  22' N., long. 43 deg.  49' E, on the east bank of the [[Euphrates]], just south of the Nahr 'Isa, or Sakhlawieh [[canal]], the northernmost of the canals connecting that river with the [[Tigris]].

==History==
Anbar was originally called '''Pērōz-šāpūr''' (a [[Middle Persian]] name which means ''Victorious Shapur''), it was also known '''Peroz Shabur''' ({{lang-arc|פירוז שבור}}), and became known as '''Perisapora''' to the Greeks and Romans. The city was founded ca. 350 by [[Shapur II]], [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] king of [[Persia]]. Perisapora was sacked and burned by Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] in April 363, during his invasion of the [[Sassanid Empire]].<ref>G. W. Bowersock, ''Julian the Apostate'', (Harvard University Press, 1978), 112.</ref>  The town became a refuge for the [[Arab]], [[Christianity|Christian]], and [[Jew]]ish colonies of that region.{{sfn|Peters|1911}} According to medieval Arabic sources, most of the inhabitants of the town migrated north to find the city of [[Hdatta]] south of [[Mosul]].<ref name=EOI>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Lewis | first = Bernard | authorlink = Bernard Lewis | editor = Hertzfeld, E | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of Islam | isbn = 9789004081185 | title = Ḥadīt̲a  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=d9JSXwAACAAJ | accessdate = 12 October 2012 | edition = Second | year = 1986 | publisher = BRILL | volume = 3 | pages = 29 }}</ref>

Anbar was adjacent or identical to the [[History of the Jews in Iraq#Babylonia as the center of Judaism|Babylonian Jewish]]  center of [[Nehardea]] ({{lang-arc|נהרדעא}}), and lies a short distance from the present-day town of [[Fallujah]], formerly the [[History of the Jews in Iraq#Babylonia as the center of Judaism|Babylonian Jewish]] center of [[Pumbeditha]] ({{lang-arc|פומבדיתא}}).

The name of the town was then changed to Anbar ("[[granaries]]"). [[As-Saffah|Abu al-Abbas as-Saffah]], the founder of the [[Abbasid]] caliphate, made it his capital, and such it remained until the founding of [[Baghdad]] in 762. It continued to be a place of much importance throughout the Abbasid period.{{sfn|Peters|1911}}

==Today==
It is now it is entirely deserted, occupied only by ruin mounds. The great number of these indicates the former importance of the city.{{sfn|Peters|1911}}
