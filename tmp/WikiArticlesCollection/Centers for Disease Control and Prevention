The '''Centers for Disease Control and Prevention''' ('''CDC''') is the national public health institute of the United States. The CDC is a [[federal agency]] under the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] and is headquartered in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[DeKalb County, Georgia]], in [[Greater Atlanta]].<!--The CDC IS located in Atlanta.

The CDC focuses national attention on developing and applying disease control and prevention. It especially focuses its attention on [[infectious disease]], [[Foodborne illness|food borne pathogens]], [[environmental health]], [[occupational safety and health]], [[health promotion]], [[injury prevention]] and educational activities designed to improve the health of [[United States citizens]]. In addition, the CDC researches and provides information on [[non-infectious diseases]] such as [[obesity]] and [[diabetes]] and is a founding member of the [[International Association of National Public Health Institutes]].

==History==
{{See also|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention timeline}}

The Communicable Diseases Center was founded July 1, 1946 as the successor to the [[World War II]] [[Malaria Control in War Areas]] program<ref name="pmid8955706">{{cite journal |author=Parascandola J |title=From MCWA to CDC—origins of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |journal=Public Health Reports |year=1996 |month=November/December |pmid=8955706 |volume=111 |issue=6 |pages=549–51 |pmc=1381908}}</ref> of the Office of National Defense Malaria Control Activities.<ref name=NARA>{{cite web |title=Records of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Record Group 442) 1921–2004 |work=Guide to Federal Records |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |location=United States |date=November 9, 2010 |url=http://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/442.html |accessdate=2009-10-04 |deadurl=no

The new agency was a branch of the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] and Atlanta was chosen as the location because [[malaria]] was endemic in the Southern United States. The agency changed names (see infobox on top right) before adopting the name ''Communicable Disease Center'' in 1946. Offices were located on the sixth floor of the Volunteer Building on Peachtree Street. With a budget at the time of about $1 million, 59 percent of its personnel were engaged in [[mosquito]] abatement and habitat control with the objective of control and eradication of malaria in the United States<ref>{{cite web |author=Division of Parasitic Diseases |title=Malaria Control in War Areas (MCWA) (1942–1945) |work=The History of Malaria, an Ancient Disease (2004) |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |location=[[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] |date=February 8, 2010 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/index.htm#mcwa |accessdate=2011-03-21}}</ref> (see [[National Malaria Eradication Program]]). Among its 369 employees, the main jobs at CDC were originally [[entomology]] and engineering. In CDC's initial years, more than six and a half million homes were sprayed, mostly with [[DDT]].  In 1946, there were only seven medical officers on duty and an early organization chart was drawn, somewhat fancifully, in the shape of a mosquito.

Under Dr. [[Joseph Mountin]] the CDC continued to advocate for public health issues and pushed to extend its responsibilities to many other [[Infectious disease|communicable diseases]]. In 1947, CDC made a token payment of $10 to [[Emory University]] for {{convert|15|acre|m2}} of land on Clifton Road in DeKalb County, still the home of CDC headquarters today. CDC employees collected the money to make the purchase. The benefactor behind the “gift” was [[Robert W. Woodruff|Robert Woodruff]], [[chairman of the board]] of [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. Woodruff had a long-time interest in [[malaria]] control, which had been a problem in areas where he went hunting.  The same year, the PHS transferred its San Francisco based plague laboratory into the CDC as the Epidemiology Division, and a new Veterinary Diseases Division was established.<ref name="pmid8955706"/>

The mission of CDC expanded beyond its original focus on malaria to include [[sexually transmitted disease]]s when the Venereal Disease Division of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) was transferred to the CDC in 1957. Shortly thereafter, Tuberculosis Control was transferred (in 1960) to the CDC from PHS, and then in 1963 the Immunization program was established.<ref>{{cite book |author=Beth E. Meyerson, Fred A. Martich, Gerald P. Naehr |year=2008 |title=Ready to Go: The History and Contributions of U.S. Public Health Advisors |location=Research Triangle Park |publisher=American Social Health Association}}</ref>

It became the ''National Communicable Disease Center (NCDC)'' effective July 1, 1967.<ref name=NARA/> The organization was renamed the ''Center for Disease Control (CDC)'' on June 24, 1970, and ''Centers for Disease Control'' effective October 14, 1980.<ref name=NARA/> An act of the [[United States Congress]] appended the words "and Prevention" to the name effective October 27, 1992.

Currently the CDC focus has broadened to include [[Chronic (medical)|chronic diseases]], [[Disability|disabilities]], injury control, [[Occupational safety and health|workplace hazards]], [[environmental health]] threats, and terrorism preparedness. CDC combats emerging diseases and other health risks, including [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]], [[West Nile virus]], [[obesity]], [[Avian influenza|avian]], [[Swine influenza|swine]], and [[pandemic flu]], [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]], and [[bioterrorism]], to name a few.  The organization would also prove to be an important factor in preventing the abuse of [[penicillin]].

In May 1994 the CDC admitted to having sent several biological warfare agents to the Iraqi government from 1984 through 1989, including [[Botulinum toxin]], [[West Nile virus]], [[Yersinia pestis]] and [[Dengue fever]] virus.<ref>"The eleventh plague: the politics of biological and chemical warfare" (p. 84-86) by [http://www.leonardcole.com Leonard A. Cole] (1993)</ref>

The CDC has one of the few [[Biosafety Level 4]] laboratories in the country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/disinfo.htm|title=CDC Special Pathogens Branch|accessdate=2010-01-19}}</ref> as well as one of only two official repositories of [[smallpox]] in the world. The second smallpox store resides at the [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR]] in the Russian Federation.

==Budget and workforce==
CDC’s FY2008 budget was $9.2 billion. As of 2008, staff numbered approximately 15,000 (including 6,000 contractors and 840 [[United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps|Commissioned Corps]] officers) in 170 occupations. Eighty percent have earned bachelor's degrees or higher; almost half have advanced degrees (a master's degree or a doctorate such as a PhD, [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]], or [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]).<ref>{{cite web |author=Office of the Associate Director for Communication |title=State of CDC: Budget and Workforce |format=[[XHTML]] |work=CDC Impact Story Topics |publisher='''Centers for Disease Control and Prevention''' |date=May 19, 2010 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/about/stateofcdc/html/budget-workforce.htm |accessdate=2011-03-21}} For more data on 2008, click on the "2008" link.</ref> CDC job titles also include engineer, [[entomologist]], [[epidemiologist]], biologist, physician, [[veterinarian]], [[Behavioural sciences|behaviorial scientist]], nurse, [[medical technologist]], economist, [[Public Health Advisor]], health communicator, [[toxicologist]], chemist, [[computer scientist]], and statistician.<ref>{{cite web |title=Top Jobs at the CDC |work=Employment Information Homepage |publisher='''CDC''' |date=April 1, 2008 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/employment/menu_topjobs.html|accessdate=2011-03-21}}</ref>

In addition to its Atlanta headquarters, the CDC has other locations in the United States and Puerto Rico. Those locations include [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]]; [[Cleveland]]; [[Cincinnati]]; [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]]; [[Hyattsville, Maryland|Hyattsville]]; [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]]; [[Pittsburgh]]; [[Research Triangle Park]]; [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]; [[Spokane, Washington]]; [[Detroit]]; and Washington, D.C.

The CDC offers [[Federal grants in the United States|grants]] that help many organizations each year bring health, safety and awareness to surrounding communities throughout the entire United States.  As a government-run department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention awards over 85 percent of its annual budget through these grants to accomplish its ultimate goal of disease control and quality health for all.<ref>{{cite web

==Diseases with which the CDC is involved==
[[File:Smallpox eradication team.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Donald Henderson]] as part of the CDC's smallpox eradication team in 1966.]]
===Influenza===

The CDC has launched campaigns targeting the transmission of [[influenza]], including the [[H1N1]] swine flu.  The CDC has launched websites including [flu.gov] to educate people.

===Other infectious diseases===

The CDC's website (see below) has information on other infectious diseases, including [[smallpox]], [[measles]], and others.

===Non-infectious disease===

The CDC also combats non-infectious diseases, including [[obesity]].

==Investigations by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG)==

On the June 15, 2011, the OIG published a report critical of the CDC's failure to oversee recipients’ use of President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) funds.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region4/41004006.pdf | title = Review of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Oversight of the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief Funds for Fiscal Years 2007 Through 2009 (A-04-10-04006) | accessdate = 2011-06-25 | date = June 2011}}</ref> The report read in part:

{{Quote box |quote =Our review found that CDC did not always monitor recipients’ use of President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) funds in accordance with departmental and other Federal requirements. CDC implements PEPFAR, working with ministries of health and other public health partners to combat HIV/AIDS by strengthening health systems and building sustainable HIV/AIDS programs in more than 75 countries in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. HHS receives PEPFAR funds from the Department of State through a memorandum of agreement.

There was evidence that CDC performed some monitoring of recipients’ use of PEPFAR funds. However, most of the award files did not include all required documents or evidence to demonstrate that CDC performed required monitoring on all cooperative agreements. Of the 30 cooperative agreements in our sample, the award file for only 1 agreement contained all required documents. The remaining 29 award files were incomplete. In addition, 14 of 21 files were missing audit reports. (A report was not yet due for 9 of the 30 cooperative agreements.) The lack of required documentation demonstrates that CDC has not exercised proper stewardship over Federal PEPFAR funds because it did not consistently follow departmental and other Federal requirements in monitoring PEPFAR recipients.

On June 5, 2012, the OIG published a report identifying vulnerabilities in vaccine management in the CDC's domestic 'Vaccines for Children' (VFC) program.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-10-00430.pdf | title = Vaccines for Children Program: Vulnerabilities in Vaccine Management (Report OEI-04-10-00430) | accessdate = 2012-06-06 | date = June 2012}}</ref> The report read in part:

{{Quote box |quote =Although the majority of storage temperatures we independently measured during a 2-week period were within the required ranges, VFC vaccines stored by 76 percent of the 45 selected providers were exposed to inappropriate temperatures for at least 5 cumulative hours during that period. Exposure to inappropriate temperatures can reduce vaccine potency and efficacy, increasing the risk that children are not provided with maximum protection against preventable diseases. Thirteen providers stored expired vaccines together with non-expired vaccines, increasing the risk of mistakenly administering the expired vaccine. Finally, the selected providers generally did not meet vaccine management requirements or maintain required documentation. Similarly, none of the five selected grantees met all VFC program oversight requirements, and grantee site visits were not effective in ensuring that providers met vaccine management requirements over time.

On the November 19, 2012, the OIG published a report critical of the CDC Namibia Office's failure to properly monitor recipients' use of PEPFAR funds.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region4/41204020.pdf | title = The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Namibia Office Did Not Always Properly Monitor Recipients' Use of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief Funds (A-04-12-04020) | accessdate = 2012-12-07 | date = November 2012}}</ref> The report read in part:

{{Quote box |quote =CDC's office in Windhoek, Namibia (CDC Namibia), is responsible for PEPFAR funds awarded to government agencies and for-profit and non-profit organizations (recipients) in Namibia.

Our audit found that CDC Namibia did not always monitor recipients' use of PEPFAR funds in accordance with HHS and other Federal requirements. There was evidence that CDC Namibia performed some monitoring of recipients' use of PEPFAR funds. However, most of the recipient cooperative agreement files did not include required documents or evidence that CDC Namibia had monitored all cooperative agreements. CDC Namibia did not consistently monitor the cooperative agreements in accordance with HHS and other Federal requirements because it did not have written policies and procedures for the monitoring process. As a result, CDC Namibia did not have assurance that PEPFAR funds were used as intended by law.

We recommended that CDC Namibia implement standard operating procedures for monitoring recipients' use of PEPFAR funds. CDC concurred with our recommendation.

==CDC zombie apocalypse video contest==
{{Main|Preparedness 101: Zombie Apocalypse}}

On May 18, 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's blog published an article instructing the public on what to do to prepare for a zombie invasion. While the article did not claim that such a scenario was possible, it did use the popular culture appeal as a means of having individuals prepare for all potential hazards, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and floods.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kraven|first=Vlad|title=CDC Zombie Warning|url=http://emergency.cdc.gov/socialmedia/zombies_blog.asp|work="Earlier today the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) issued a preparedness guide on their blog, informing citizens on how to be ready for the rise of the undead."|accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref>  The recent proliferation of Zombie media provided a medium to contact citizens usually unaccustomed to dealing with the CDC.

Once the article became popular, the CDC  announced an open contest for YouTube submissions of the most creative and effective videos covering preparedness for a [[zombie apocalypse]] (or apocalypse of any kind), to be judged by the "CDC Zombie Task Force".  Submissions were open until October 11, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prepare.challenge.gov |title=Are You Prepared?
