'''Bayezid I''' ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman]]: بايزيد اول, [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Beyazıt'', nicknamed ''Yıldırım'' (Ottoman: ییلدیرم), "'''Thunderbolt'''"; 1354 – March 8, 1403) was the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1389 to 1402. He was the son of [[Murad I]]<ref name=Lowry>Lowry, Heath W. (2003) ''The Nature of the Early Ottoman State''. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, p. 153</ref><ref name=Runciman>Runciman, Steven ''The Fall of Constantinople''.

==Biography==
[[File:Bayezid I - Manyal Palace Museum.JPG|thumb|left|175px|Image of Bayezit I, who defeated the Crusaders at [[Battle of Nicopolis|Nicopolis]].]]
Bayezid ascended to the throne following the death of his father Murad I, who was killed by Serbian knight [[Miloš Obilić]] during (June 15), or immediately after (June 16), the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389, by which Serbia became a vassal of the Ottoman Empire. Immediately after obtaining the throne, he had his younger brother strangled to avoid a plot. In 1390, Bayezid took as a wife Princess [[Olivera Despina]], the daughter of Prince [[Lazar of Serbia]],<ref>''Bayezid I'', Halil Inalcik,'''The Encyclopedia of Islam''', Vol. I, Ed. H.A.R.Gibb, J.H.Kramers, E. Levi-Provencal and J.Schacht, (Brill, 1986), 1118.</ref> who also lost his life in Kosovo. Bayezid recognized [[Stefan Lazarević]], the son of Lazar, as the new Serbian leader (later despot), with considerable autonomy.

From 1389 to 1395 he conquered [[Bulgaria]] and northern [[Greece]]. In 1394 he crossed the River [[Danube]] to attack [[Wallachia]], ruled at that time by [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea the Elder]]. The Ottomans were superior in number, but on October 10, 1394 (or 17 May 1395), in the [[Battle of Rovine]], on forested and swampy terrain, the [[Wallachians|Wallachian]]s won the fierce battle and prevented Bayezid from conquering the country.

Meanwhile, he begin the reunification of the Turkish Anatolia, conquering the beyliks of [[Aydin]], [[Saruhan]]  in 1390, the beyliks of [[Mentese]], [[Germiyan]] and [[Kastamonu]] in 1391; and finally the great emirate of [[Karaman]]  and the ex-emirate of [[Burhan-ad-Din]] in Tokat, [[Sivas]] and Kayseri(1397–98). Next he occuped the cities of [[Malatya]] and [[Elbistan]], in a war with the mamluk sultan of Egypt.

In 1394, Bayezid laid siege to [[Constantinople]],<ref>Mango, Cyril. ''The Oxford History of Byzantium''. 1st ed. New York: Oxford UP, 2002. p. 273-4</ref> the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Anadoluhisarı]] fortress was built between 1393 and 1394 as part of preparations for the Second Ottoman Siege of Constantinople, which took place in 1395. On the urgings of the Byzantine emperor [[Manuel II Palaeologus]] a new [[crusade]] was organized to defeat him. This proved unsuccessful: in 1396 the [[Christianity|Christian]] allies, under the leadership of the King of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and future [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (in 1433) [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], were defeated in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]]. Bayezid built the magnificent [[Bursa, Turkey#Mosques of Bursa|Ulu Camii]] in Bursa, to celebrate this victory.

Thus, the siege of Constantinople continued, lasting until 1402.<ref>Nancy Bisaha, ''Creating East And West: Renaissance Humanists And the Ottoman Turks'', (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004), 98.</ref> The beleaguered Byzantines had their reprieve when Bayezid fought the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] in the East.<ref>Dimitris J. Kastritsis, ''The Sons of Bayezid: Empire Building and Representation in the Ottoman Civil War of 1402-13'', (Brill, 2007), 5.</ref> At this time, the empire of Bayezid included [[Thrace]] (except [[Constantinople]]), [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]], and parts of [[Serbia]] in Europe. In Asia, his domains extended to the [[Taurus Mountains]]. His army was considered one of the best in the Islamic world. In 1400, the [[Central Asia]]n warlord [[Timur]] succeeded in rousing the local Turkic [[Anatolian beyliks|beyliks]] that had been vassals of the Ottomans to join him in his attack on Bayezid, who was also considered one of the most powerful rulers in the Muslim world during that period. In the fateful [[Battle of Ankara]], on 20 July 1402, Bayezid was captured by Timur and the Ottoman army was defeated. Many writers claim that Bayezid was mistreated by the Timurids. However, writers and historians from Timur's own court reported that Bayezid was treated well, and that Timur even mourned his death. One of Bayezid's sons, [[Mustafa Çelebi]], was captured with him and held captive in [[Samarkand]] until 1405.

Four of Bayezid's sons, specifically [[Süleyman Çelebi]], [[İsa Çelebi]], [[Mehmed Çelebi]], and [[Musa Çelebi]], however, escaped from the battlefield and later started a civil war for the Ottoman throne known as the [[Ottoman Interregnum]].<ref>Dimitris J. Kastritsis,1-3.</ref> After Mehmed's victory, his coronation as [[Mehmed I]], and the death of all four but Mehmed, Bayezid's other son [[Mustafa Çelebi]] emerged from hiding and began two failed rebellions against his brother Mehmed and, after Mehmed's death, his nephew [[Murat II]].

==In fiction==
[[File:1396-Battle of Nicopolis-Hunername-2.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Nicopolis]], as depicted by Turkish miniaturist in 1588.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lokman |url=http://warfare.atwebpages.com/Ottoman/Ottoman.htm |title=Battle of Nicopolis (1396) |year=1588 |work=Hünernâme}}</ref>]]

The defeat of Bayezid became a popular subject for later Western writers, composers, and painters. They embellished the legend that he was taken by Timur to [[Samarkand]] with a cast of characters to create an oriental fantasy that has maintained its appeal. [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s play ''Tamburlane the Great'' was first performed in [[London]] in 1587, three years after the formal opening of English-Ottoman trade relations when [[William Harborne]] sailed for Constantinople as an agent of the [[Levant Company]]. In 1648, the play ''Le Gran Tamerlan et Bejezet'' by [[Jean Magnon]] appeared in London, and in 1725, [[Handel|Handel's]] ''[[Tamerlano]]'' was first performed and published in London;<ref>London: Printed & sold by J. Cluer, [1725]</ref> [[Vivaldi|Vivaldi's]] version of the story, ''[[Bajazet (opera)|Bajazet]]'', was written in 1735. Magnon had given Bayezid an intriguing wife and daughter; the Handel and Vivaldi renditions included, as well as Tamerlane and Bayezid and his daughter, a prince of Byzantium and a princess of [[Trebizond]] ([[Trabzon]]) in a passionate love story. A cycle of paintings in [[Schloss Eggenberg]], near [[Graz]] in [[Austria]], translated the theme to a different medium; this was completed in the 1670s shortly before the Ottoman army attacked the [[Habsburgs]] in central [[Europe]].<ref>Finkel, C. (2006) ''The History of the Ottoman Empire: Osman's Dream''. New York: Basic Books; p. 30</ref> Bayezid (spelled Bayazid) is a central character in the [[Robert E. Howard]] story ''Lord of Samarcand.''<ref>Howard, Robert E. (1973) ''Sowers of the Thunder,'' Ace Science Fiction</ref>
