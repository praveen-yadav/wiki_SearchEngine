A '''black hole''' is a region of [[spacetime]] from which gravity prevents anything, including [[light]], from escaping.<ref>{{harvnb|Wald|1984|pp=299–300}}</ref>  The theory of [[general relativity]] predicts that a sufficiently compact [[mass]] will deform spacetime to form a black hole. Around a black hole, there is a mathematically defined surface called an [[event horizon]] that marks the point of no return. The hole is called "black" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect [[black body]] in [[thermodynamics]].<ref>{{cite book

This temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, making it difficult to observe this radiation for [[stellar black hole|black holes of stellar mass]] or greater.

Objects whose [[gravity field]]s are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by [[John Michell]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]. The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by [[Karl Schwarzschild]] in 1916, although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by [[David Finkelstein]] in 1958. Long considered a mathematical curiosity, it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed black holes were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of [[neutron star]]s sparked interest in [[gravitational collapse|gravitationally collapsed]] compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality.

[[Stellar black hole|Black holes of stellar mass]] are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, [[supermassive black hole]]s of millions of solar masses may form. There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most [[galaxy|galaxies]].

Despite its invisible interior, the presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other [[matter]] and with [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as light. Matter falling onto a black hole can form an [[accretion disk]] heated by friction, forming some of the brightest objects in the universe. If there are other stars orbiting a black hole, their orbit can be used to determine its mass and location. These data can be used to exclude possible alternatives (such as neutron stars). In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in [[binary star|binary systems]], and established that the core of our [[Milky Way]] galaxy contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million [[solar mass]]es.

The idea of a body so massive that even light could not escape was first put forward by [[geologist]] [[John Michell]] in a letter written to [[Henry Cavendish]] in 1783 of the [[Royal Society]]:

{{quote|If the semi-diameter of a sphere of the same density as the Sun were to exceed that of the Sun in the proportion of 500 to 1, a body falling from an infinite height towards it would have acquired at its surface greater velocity than that of light, and consequently supposing light to be attracted by the same force in proportion to its vis inertiae, with other bodies, all light emitted from such a body would be made to return towards it by its own proper gravity.|John Michell<ref name="Michell1784">

In 1915, [[Albert Einstein]] developed his theory of [[general relativity]], having earlier shown that gravity does influence light's motion. Only a few months later, [[Karl Schwarzschild]] found a [[Schwarzschild metric|solution]] to [[Einstein field equations]], which describes the [[gravitational field]] of a [[point mass]] and a spherical mass.<ref name="Schwarzschild1916">

Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped.

These properties are special because they are visible from outside a black hole. For example, a charged black hole repels other like charges just like any other charged object. Similarly, the total mass inside a sphere containing a black hole can be found by using the gravitational analog of [[Gauss's law]], the [[ADM mass]], far away from the black hole.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|p=253}}</ref> Likewise, the angular momentum can be measured from far away using [[frame dragging]] by the [[gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic field]].

When an object falls into a black hole, any [[physical information|information]] about the shape of the object or distribution of charge on it is evenly distributed along the horizon of the black hole, and is lost to outside observers.

The information that is lost includes every quantity that cannot be measured far away from the black hole horizon, including [[Conservation law|approximately conserved]] [[quantum number]]s such as the total [[baryon number]] and [[lepton number]].

The simplest black holes have mass but neither electric charge nor angular momentum. These black holes are often referred to as [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild black hole]]s after Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this [[Solutions of the Einstein field equations|solution]] in 1916.<ref name="Schwarzschild1916"/> According to [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]], it is the only [[Vacuum solution (general relativity)|vacuum solution]] that is [[Spherically symmetric spacetime|spherically symmetric]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=Appendix B}}</ref> This means that there is no observable difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and that of any other spherical object of the same mass. The popular notion of a black hole "sucking in everything" in its surroundings is therefore only correct near a black hole's horizon; far away, the external gravitational field is identical to that of any other body of the same mass.<ref>{{Cite book

Solutions describing more general black holes also exist. [[Charged black hole]]s are described by the [[Reissner–Nordström metric]], while the [[Kerr metric]] describes a [[rotating black hole]].

While the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, the charge and angular momentum are constrained by the mass. In [[Planck units]], the total electric charge&nbsp;''Q'' and the total angular momentum&nbsp;''J'' are expected to satisfy
:<math>Q^2+\left ( \tfrac{J}{M} \right )^2\le M^2\, </math>
for a black hole of mass ''M''. Black holes saturating this inequality are called [[extremal black hole|extremal]]. Solutions of Einstein's equations that violate this inequality exist, but they do not possess an event horizon. These solutions have so-called [[naked singularity|naked singularities]] that can be observed from the outside, and hence are deemed ''unphysical''. The [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]] rules out the formation of such singularities, when they are created through the gravitational collapse of [[energy conditions|realistic matter]].<ref>{{cite arXiv

Black holes are commonly classified according to their mass, independent of angular momentum ''J'' or electric charge ''Q''. The size of a black hole, as determined by the radius of the event horizon, or [[Schwarzschild radius]], is roughly proportional to the mass ''M'' through

The defining feature of a black hole is the appearance of an event horizon—a boundary in [[spacetime]] through which matter and light can only pass inward towards the mass of the black hole. Nothing, not even light, can escape from inside the event horizon. The event horizon is referred to as such because if an event occurs within the boundary, information from that event cannot reach an outside observer, making it impossible to determine if such an event occurred.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheeler|2007|p=179}}</ref>

As predicted by general relativity, the presence of a mass deforms spacetime in such a way that the paths taken by particles bend towards the mass.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|loc=Ch. 5.4 and 7.3}}</ref> At the event horizon of a black hole, this deformation becomes so strong that there are no paths that lead away from the black hole.

To a distant observer, clocks near a black hole appear to tick more slowly than those further away from the black hole.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|p=217}}</ref> Due to this effect, known as [[gravitational time dilation]], an object falling into a black hole appears to slow down as it approaches the event horizon, taking an infinite time to reach it.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|p=218}}</ref> At the same time, all processes on this object slow down, for a fixed outside observer, causing emitted light to appear redder and dimmer, an effect known as [[gravitational redshift]].<ref>{{cite web

 |work=Knowing the universe and its secrets
 |accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> Eventually, at a point just before it reaches the event horizon, the falling object becomes so dim that it can no longer be seen.

On the other hand, an observer falling into a black hole does not notice any of these effects as he crosses the event horizon. According to his own clock, he crosses the event horizon after a finite time without noting any singular behaviour. In particular, he is unable to determine exactly when he crosses it, as it is impossible to determine the location of the event horizon from local observations.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|p=222}}</ref>

The shape of the event horizon of a black hole is always approximately spherical.{{#tag:ref|This is true only for 4-dimensional spacetimes.

===Singularity===
{{Main|Gravitational singularity}}
At the center of a black hole as described by general relativity lies a [[gravitational singularity]], a region where the spacetime curvature becomes infinite.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|p=205}}</ref> For a non-rotating black hole, this region takes the shape of a single point and for a [[rotating black hole]], it is smeared out to form a [[ring singularity]] lying in the plane of rotation.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|pp=264–265}}</ref> In both cases, the singular region has zero volume. It can also be shown that the singular region contains all the mass of the black hole solution.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|p=252}}</ref> The singular region can thus be thought of as having infinite [[mass density|density]].

Observers falling into a Schwarzschild black hole (''i.e.,'' non-rotating and not charged) cannot avoid being carried into the singularity, once they cross the event horizon. They can prolong the experience by accelerating away to slow their descent, but only up to a point; after attaining a certain ideal velocity, it is best to [[free fall]] the rest of the way.<ref>{{Cite journal

In the case of a charged (Reissner–Nordström) or rotating (Kerr) black hole, it is possible to avoid the singularity. Extending these solutions as far as possible reveals the hypothetical possibility of exiting the black hole into a different spacetime with the black hole acting as a [[wormhole]].<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|pp=257–259 and 265–266}}</ref> The possibility of traveling to another universe is however only theoretical, since any perturbation will destroy this possibility.<ref>{{Cite journal

To date, it has not been possible to combine quantum and gravitational effects into a single theory, although there exist attempts to formulate such a theory of [[quantum gravity]]. It is generally expected that such a theory will not feature any singularities.<ref>{{cite web

===Photon sphere===
{{Main|Photon sphere}}
The photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness such that [[photon]]s moving along [[tangent]]s to the sphere will be trapped in a circular orbit. For non-rotating black holes, the photon sphere has a radius 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius. The orbits are [[instability|dynamically unstable]], hence any small perturbation (such as a particle of infalling matter) will grow over time, either setting it on an outward trajectory escaping the black hole or on an inward spiral eventually crossing the event horizon.<ref name=prd84_6>{{Cite journal

While light can still escape from inside the photon sphere, any light that crosses the photon sphere on an inbound trajectory will be captured by the black hole. Hence any light reaching an outside observer from inside the photon sphere must have been emitted by objects inside the photon sphere but still outside of the event horizon.<ref name=prd84_6/>

===Ergosphere===
{{Main|Ergosphere}}
[[File:Ergosphere.svg|thumb|right|ergosphere of a rotating black hole|The ergosphere is an oblate spheroid region outside of the event horizon, where objects cannot remain stationary.]]
Rotating black holes are surrounded by a region of spacetime in which it is impossible to stand still, called the ergosphere. This is the result of a process known as [[frame-dragging]]; general relativity predicts that any rotating mass will tend to slightly "drag" along the spacetime immediately surrounding it. Any object near the rotating mass will tend to start moving in the direction of rotation. For a rotating black hole, this effect becomes so strong near the event horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light in the opposite direction to just stand still.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|loc=Ch. 6.6}}</ref>

The ergosphere of a black hole is bounded by the (outer) event horizon on the inside and an [[oblate spheroid]], which coincides with the event horizon at the poles and is noticeably wider around the equator. The outer boundary is sometimes called the ''ergosurface''.

Objects and radiation can escape normally from the ergosphere. Through the [[Penrose process]], objects can emerge from the ergosphere with more energy than they entered. This energy is taken from the rotational energy of the black hole causing it to slow down.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|loc=Ch. 6.7}}</ref>

==Formation and evolution==
Considering the exotic nature of black holes, it may be natural to question if such bizarre objects could exist in nature or to suggest that they are merely pathological solutions to Einstein's equations. Einstein himself wrongly thought that black holes would not form, because he held that the angular momentum of collapsing particles would stabilize their motion at some radius.<ref>{{Cite journal

Once an event horizon forms, Penrose proved that a singularity will form somewhere inside it.<ref name=penrose1965/> Shortly afterwards, Hawking showed that many cosmological solutions describing the [[Big Bang]] have singularities without scalar fields or other exotic matter (see [[Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems]]). The [[Kerr solution]], the [[no-hair theorem]] and the laws of [[black hole thermodynamics]] showed that the physical properties of black holes were simple and comprehensible, making them respectable subjects for research.<ref name=HawkingPenrose1970>{{Cite journal

===Gravitational collapse===
{{Main|Gravitational collapse}}
Gravitational collapse occurs when an object's internal [[pressure]] is insufficient to resist the object's own gravity. For stars this usually occurs either because a star has too little "fuel" left to maintain its temperature through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], or because a star that would have been stable receives extra matter in a way that does not raise its core temperature. In either case the star's temperature is no longer high enough to prevent it from collapsing under its own weight.<ref name="Carroll5.8">{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|loc=Section 5.8}}</ref>
The collapse may be stopped by the [[degeneracy pressure]] of the star's constituents, condensing the matter in an exotic [[Degenerate matter|denser state]]. The result is one of the various types of [[compact star]]. The type of compact star formed depends on the mass of the remnant—the matter left over after the outer layers have been blown away, such from a [[supernova]] explosion or by pulsations leading to a [[planetary nebula]]. Note that this mass can be substantially less than the original star—remnants exceeding 5 solar masses are produced by stars that were over 20 solar masses before the collapse.<ref name="Carroll5.8"/>

If the mass of the remnant exceeds about 3–4 solar masses (the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]]<ref name="OV1939"/>)—either because the original star was very heavy or because the remnant collected additional mass through accretion of matter—even the degeneracy pressure of [[neutrons]] is insufficient to stop the collapse. No known mechanism (except possibly quark degeneracy pressure, see [[quark star]]) is powerful enough to stop the implosion and the object will inevitably collapse to form a black hole.<ref name="Carroll5.8"/>

The gravitational collapse of heavy stars is assumed to be responsible for the formation of [[stellar mass black hole]]s. [[Star formation]] in the early universe may have resulted in very massive stars, which upon their collapse would have produced black holes of up to 10<sup>3</sup> solar masses. These black holes could be the seeds of the supermassive black holes found in the centers of most galaxies.<ref name="ReesVolonteri">{{Cite book

While most of the energy released during gravitational collapse is emitted very quickly, an outside observer does not actually see the end of this process. Even though the collapse takes a finite amount of time from the [[frame of reference|reference frame]] of infalling matter, a distant observer sees the infalling material slow and halt just above the event horizon, due to [[gravitational time dilation]]. Light from the collapsing material takes longer and longer to reach the observer, with the light emitted just before the event horizon forms delayed an infinite amount of time. Thus the external observer never sees the formation of the event horizon; instead, the collapsing material seems to become dimmer and increasingly red-shifted, eventually fading away.<ref>{{cite journal

====Primordial black holes in the Big Bang====
Gravitational collapse requires great density. In the current epoch of the universe these high densities are only found in stars, but in the early universe shortly after the [[big bang]] densities were much greater, possibly allowing for the creation of black holes. The high density alone is not enough to allow the formation of black holes since a uniform mass distribution will not allow the mass to bunch up. In order for [[primordial black holes]] to form in such a dense medium, there must be initial density perturbations that can then grow under their own gravity. Different models for the early universe vary widely in their predictions of the size of these perturbations. Various models predict the creation of black holes, ranging from a [[Planck mass]] to hundreds of thousands of solar masses.<ref>{{cite book

Gravitational collapse is not the only process that could create black holes. In principle, black holes could be formed in [[high-energy physics|high-energy]] collisions that achieve sufficient density. As of 2002, no such events have been detected, either directly or indirectly as a deficiency of the mass balance in [[particle accelerator]] experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Growth===
Once a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing additional matter. Any black hole will continually absorb gas and [[interstellar dust]] from its direct surroundings and omnipresent [[cosmic background radiation]]. This is the primary process through which supermassive black holes seem to have grown.<ref name="ReesVolonteri"/> A similar process has been suggested for the formation of [[intermediate-mass black hole]]s in [[globular cluster]]s.<ref>{{cite journal

Another possibility is for a black hole to merge with other objects such as stars or even other black holes.

By their very nature, black holes do not directly emit any signals other than the hypothetical Hawking radiation; since the Hawking radiation for an astrophysical black hole is predicted to be very weak, this makes it impossible to directly detect astrophysical black holes from the Earth. A possible exception to the Hawking radiation being weak is the last stage of the evaporation of light (primordial) black holes; searches for such flashes in the past have proven unsuccessful and provide stringent limits on the possibility of existence of light primordial black holes.<ref>{{Cite journal

Astrophysicists searching for black holes thus have to rely on indirect observations. A black hole's existence can sometimes be inferred by observing its gravitational interactions with its surroundings. [[Event Horizon Telescope|A project]] run by MIT's [[Haystack Observatory]] is attempting to observe the event horizon of a black hole directly. Initial results are encouraging.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.haystack.mit.edu/ast/uvlbi/mm/eht.html |title= Event Horizon Telescope |publisher= MIT Haystack Observatory |accessdate= 6 April 2012 }}</ref>

[[File:A star is consumed by a black hole.ogv|thumb|upright=1.2|A computer simulation of a star being consumed by a black hole. The blue dot indicates the location of the black hole.]]

Due to [[conservation of angular momentum]], gas falling into the [[gravitational well]] created by a massive object will typically form a disc-like structure around the object. Friction within the disc causes angular momentum to be transported outward, allowing matter to fall further inward, releasing potential energy and increasing the temperature of the gas.<ref name=McClintockRemillard2006>{{Cite book

}} section 4.1.5.</ref> In the case of [[compact object]]s such as [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and black holes, the gas in the inner regions becomes so hot that it will emit vast amounts of radiation (mainly X-rays), which may be detected by telescopes. This process of accretion is one of the most efficient energy-producing processes known; up to 40% of the rest mass of the accreted material can be emitted in radiation.<ref name=McClintockRemillard2006/> (In nuclear fusion only about 0.7% of the rest mass will be emitted as energy.) In many cases, accretion discs are accompanied by [[relativistic jets]] emitted along the poles, which carry away much of the energy. The mechanism for the creation of these jets is currently not well understood.

As such many of the universe's more energetic phenomena have been attributed to the accretion of matter on black holes.

===X-ray binaries===
{{See also|X-ray binary}}

[[X-ray binaries]] are [[binary star]] systems that are luminous in the [[X-ray]] part of the spectrum. These X-ray emissions are generally thought to be caused by one of the component stars being a compact object accreting matter from the other (regular) star. The presence of an ordinary star in such a system provides a unique opportunity for studying the central object and determining if it might be a black hole.

If such a system emits signals that can be directly traced back to the compact object, it cannot be a black hole. The absence of such a signal does, however, not exclude the possibility that the compact object is a neutron star. By studying the companion star it is often possible to obtain the orbital parameters of the system and obtain an estimate for the mass of the compact object. If this is much larger than the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (that is, the maximum mass a neutron star can have before collapsing) then the object cannot be a neutron star and is generally expected to be a black hole.<ref name="CMS1999">{{Cite journal

Moreover, these systems are only active in X-ray for several months once every 10–50 years. During the period of low X-ray emission (called quiescence), the accretion disc is extremely faint allowing for detailed observation of the companion star during this period. One of the best such candidates is [[V404 Cyg]].

====Quiescence and advection-dominated accretion flow====
The faintness of the accretion disc during quiescence is suspected to be caused by the flow entering a mode called an [[advection-dominated accretion flow]] (ADAF). In this mode, almost all the energy generated by friction in the disc is swept along with the flow instead of radiated away. If this model is correct, then it forms strong qualitative evidence for the presence of an event horizon.<ref>{{cite journal

{{main|Quasi-periodic oscillations}}

The X-ray emission from accretion disks sometimes flickers at certain frequencies. These signals are called [[quasi-periodic oscillations]] and are thought to be caused by material moving along the inner edge of the accretion disk (the innermost stable circular orbit). As such their frequency is linked to the mass of the compact object. They can thus be used as an alternative way to determine the mass of potential black holes.<ref>{{cite press release

Astronomers use the term "[[active galaxy]]" to describe galaxies with unusual characteristics, such as unusual [[spectral line]] emission and very strong radio emission.

The models of these AGN consist of a central black hole that may be millions or billions of times more massive than the [[Sun]]; a disk of [[interstellar gas|gas]] and [[interstellar dust|dust]] called an accretion disk; and two [[relativistic jet|jets]] that are perpendicular to the accretion disk.<ref name="krolik1999">{{Cite book

From the orbital data they were able to place better constraints on the mass and size of the object causing the orbital motion of stars in the Sagittarius A* region, finding that there is a spherical mass of 4.3 million solar masses contained within a radius of less than 0.002 lightyears.<ref name="Gillessen"/> While this is more than 3000 times the Schwarzschild radius corresponding to that mass, it is at least consistent with the central object being a supermassive black hole, and no "realistic cluster [of stars] is physically tenable".<ref name="Ghez1998"/>

===Effects of strong gravity===
Another way that the black hole nature of an object may be tested in the future is through observation of effects caused by strong gravity in their vicinity. One such effect is [[gravitational lensing]]: The deformation of spacetime around a massive object causes light rays to be deflected much like light passing through an optic [[Lens (optics)|lens]].  Observations have been made of weak gravitational lensing, in which light rays are deflected by only a few [[arcseconds]]. However, it has never been directly observed for a black hole.<ref name="Bozza"/> One possibility for observing gravitational lensing by a black hole would be to observe stars in orbit around the black hole. There are several candidates for such an observation in orbit around [[Sagittarius A*]].<ref name="Bozza">{{cite journal

Another option would be the direct observation of gravitational waves produced by an object falling into a black hole, for example a compact object falling into a supermassive black hole through an [[extreme mass ratio inspiral]]. Matching the observed waveform to the predictions of general relativity would allow precision measurements of the mass and angular momentum of the central object, while at the same time testing general relativity.<ref>{{cite journal

The evidence for stellar black holes strongly relies on the existence of an upper limit for the mass of a neutron star.

New exotic [[Phase (matter)|phases of matter]] could push up this bound.<ref name="CMS1999"/> A phase of free [[quark]]s at high density might allow the existence of dense [[quark star]]s,<ref>{{cite journal

Since the average density of a black hole inside its Schwarzschild radius is inversely proportional to the square of its mass, supermassive black holes are much less dense than stellar black holes (the average density of a 10<sup>8</sup> solar mass black hole is comparable to that of water).<ref name="CMS1999"/> Consequently, the physics of matter forming a supermassive black hole is much better understood and the possible alternative explanations for supermassive black hole observations are much more mundane. For example, a supermassive black hole could be modelled by a large cluster of very dark objects. However, such alternatives are typically not stable enough to explain the supermassive black hole candidates.<ref name="CMS1999"/>

The evidence for stellar and supermassive black holes implies that in order for black holes not to form, general relativity must fail as a theory of gravity, perhaps due to the onset of [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] corrections. A much anticipated feature of a theory of quantum gravity is that it will not feature singularities or event horizons (and thus no black holes).<ref>{{cite journal

===Entropy and thermodynamics===
{{Further2|[[Black hole thermodynamics]]}}
[[File:BHentropy.svg|thumb|right|alt=S=1/4 k c<sup>3</sup>ħ<sup>−1</sup>G<sup>−1</sup> A.|The formula for the [[Bekenstein–Hawking entropy]] (S) of a black hole, which depends on the area of the black hole (A). The constants are the [[speed of light]] (c), the [[Boltzmann constant]] (k), [[Newton's constant]] (G), and the [[reduced Planck constant]] (ħ).]]
In 1971, Hawking showed under general conditions<ref group=Note>In particular, he assumed that all matter satisfies the [[weak energy condition]].</ref> that the total area of the event horizons of any collection of classical black holes can never decrease, even if they collide and merge.<ref>{{cite journal

}}</ref> This result, now known as the [[second law of black hole mechanics]], is remarkably similar to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which states that the total [[entropy]] of a system can never decrease. As with classical objects at [[absolute zero]] temperature, it was assumed that black holes had zero entropy. If this were the case, the second law of thermodynamics would be violated by entropy-laden matter entering a black hole, resulting in a decrease of the total entropy of the universe. Therefore, Bekenstein proposed that a black hole should have an entropy, and that it should be proportional to its horizon area.<ref name="wald99">{{cite journal

 |ref=harv }}</ref>

The link with the laws of thermodynamics was further strengthened by Hawking's discovery that [[quantum field theory]] predicts that a black hole radiates [[blackbody radiation]] at a constant temperature. This seemingly causes a violation of the second law of black hole mechanics, since the radiation will carry away energy from the black hole causing it to shrink. The radiation, however also carries away entropy, and it can be proven under general assumptions that the sum of the entropy of the matter surrounding a black hole and one quarter of the area of the horizon as measured in [[Planck units]] is in fact always increasing. This allows the formulation of the [[first law of black hole mechanics]] as an analogue of the [[first law of thermodynamics]], with the mass acting as energy, the surface gravity as temperature and the area as entropy.<ref name="wald99"/>

One puzzling feature is that the entropy of a black hole scales with its area rather than with its volume, since entropy is normally an [[extensive quantity]] that scales linearly with the volume of the system. This odd property led [[Gerard 't Hooft]] and [[Leonard Susskind]] to propose the [[holographic principle]], which suggests that anything that happens in a volume of spacetime can be described by data on the boundary of that volume.<ref>{{cite book

Although general relativity can be used to perform a semi-classical calculation of black hole entropy, this situation is theoretically unsatisfying. In [[statistical mechanics]], entropy is understood as counting the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have the same macroscopic qualities (such as [[mass]], [[Charge (physics)|charge]], [[pressure]], etc.). Without a satisfactory theory of [[quantum gravity]], one cannot perform such a computation for black holes. Some progress has been made in various approaches to quantum gravity. In 1995, [[Andrew Strominger]] and [[Cumrun Vafa]] showed that counting the microstates of a specific [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] black hole in [[string theory]] reproduced the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy.<ref>{{cite journal

===Information loss paradox===
{{Main|Black hole information paradox}}
{{unsolved|physics|Is [[physical information]] lost in black holes?}}
Because a black hole has only a few internal parameters, most of the information about the matter that went into forming the black hole is lost. Regardless of the type of matter which goes into a black hole, it appears that only information concerning the total mass, charge, and angular momentum are conserved. As long as black holes were thought to persist forever this information loss is not that problematic, as the information can be thought of as existing inside the black hole, inaccessible from the outside. However, black holes slowly evaporate by emitting [[Hawking radiation]]. This radiation does not appear to carry any additional information about the matter that formed the black hole, meaning that this information appears to be gone forever.<ref name="PlayDice000">{{cite web

The question whether information is truly lost in black holes (the [[black hole information paradox]]) has divided the theoretical physics community (see [[Thorne–Hawking–Preskill bet]]). In quantum mechanics, loss of information corresponds to the violation of vital property called [[unitarity (physics)|unitarity]], which has to do with the conservation of probability. It has been argued that loss of unitarity would also imply violation of conservation of energy.<ref name="giddings1995">{{cite conference
