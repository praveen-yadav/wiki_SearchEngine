In addition, the cycle provides [[precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] of certain amino acids as well as the [[reducing agent]] [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]] that is used in numerous other biochemical reactions.

The name of this metabolic pathway is derived from [[citric acid]] (a type of [[tricarboxylic acid]]) that is consumed and then regenerated by this sequence of reactions to complete the cycle.  In addition, the cycle consumes acetate (in the form of [[acetyl-CoA]]) and [[water]], reduces [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sup>]] to NADH, and produces carbon dioxide as a waste byproduct.  The NADH generated by the TCA cycle is fed into the [[oxidative phosphorylation]] (electron transport) pathway.  The net result of these two closely linked pathways is the oxidation of nutrients to produce usable chemical energy in the form of [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

In [[eukaryotic]] cells, the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the [[mitochondrion]].  In prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria which lack mitochondria, the TCA reaction sequence is performed in the [[cytosol]] with the proton gradient for ATP production being across the cell's surface ([[plasma membrane]]) rather than the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.

Several of the components and reactions of the citric acid cycle were established in the 1930s by the research of the Nobel laureate [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]], for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1937 for his discoveries pertaining to [[fumaric acid]], a key component of the cycle.<ref name="Nobel_Prize_1937">{{cite web | url =  http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1937/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1937 | accessdate = 2011-10-26 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation }}</ref>

== Overview ==
The citric acid cycle is a key component of the metabolic pathway by which all [[aerobic organism]]s generate energy.  Through [[catabolism]] of sugars, fats, and proteins, a two-carbon organic product acetate in the form of [[acetyl-CoA]] is produced. Acetyl-CoA along with two [[equivalent (chemistry)|equivalents]] of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is consumed by the citric acid cycle producing two equivalents of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and one equivalent of [[Coenzyme A|HS-CoA]].  In addition, one complete turn of the cycle converts three equivalents of [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD<sup>+</sup>) into three equivalents of reduced NAD<sup>+</sup> (NADH), one equivalent of [[ubiquinone]] (Q) into one equivalent of reduced ubiquinone (QH<sub>2</sub>), and one equivalent each of [[guanosine diphosphate]] (GDP) and inorganic [[phosphate]] (P<sub>i</sub>) into one equivalent of [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP). The NADH and QH<sub>2</sub> generated by the citric acid cycle are in turn used by the [[oxidative phosphorylation]] pathway to generate energy-rich [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP).

One of the primary sources of acetyl-CoA is sugars that are broken down by [[glycolysis]] to produce [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] that in turn is decarboxylated by the enzyme [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] generating acetyl-CoA according to the following reaction scheme:<ref name="MehtaS" />

* [[pyruvic acid|CH<sub>3</sub>C(=O)C(=O)O<sup>–</sup>]] (pyruvate) + [[Coenzyme A|HSCoA]] + [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sup>]] → [[acetyl-CoA|CH<sub>3</sub>C(=O)SCoA]] (acetyl-CoA) + NADH + CO<sub>2</sub>

The product of this reaction, acetyl-CoA, is the starting point for the citric acid cycle.  Below is a schematic outline of the cycle:<ref name="MehtaS" />

* The [[citric acid]] cycle begins with the transfer of a two-carbon [[acetyl]] group from [[acetyl-CoA]] to the four-carbon acceptor compound (oxaloacetate) to form a six-carbon compound (citrate).
* The citrate then goes through a series of chemical transformations, losing two [[carboxyl]] groups as CO<sub>2</sub>. The carbons lost as CO<sub>2</sub> originate from what was oxaloacetate, not directly from acetyl-CoA. The carbons donated by acetyl-CoA become part of the oxaloacetate carbon backbone after the first turn of the citric acid cycle. Loss of the acetyl-CoA-donated carbons as CO<sub>2</sub> requires several turns of the citric acid cycle. However, because of the role of the citric acid cycle in [[anabolic|anabolism]],  they may not be lost, since many TCA cycle intermediates are also used as precursors for the biosynthesis of other molecules.<ref name="pmid2106256">{{cite journal | author = Wolfe RR, Jahoor F | title = Recovery of labeled CO2 during the infusion of C-1- vs C-2-labeled acetate: implications for tracer studies of substrate oxidation | journal = Am. J. Clin. Nutr. | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 248–52 | year = 1990 | month = February | pmid = 2106256 | doi = }}</ref>
* Most of the energy made available by the oxidative steps of the cycle is transferred as energy-rich [[electrons]] to NAD<sup>+</sup>, forming NADH. For each acetyl group that enters the citric acid cycle, three molecules of NADH are produced.
* Electrons are also transferred to the electron acceptor Q, forming QH<sub>2</sub>.
* At the end of each cycle, the four-carbon oxaloacetate has been regenerated, and the cycle continues.

== Steps ==
Two [[carbon]] atoms  are [[oxidation|oxidized]] to [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]], the energy from these reactions being transferred to other metabolic processes by [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] (or [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), and as electrons in [[NADH]] and [[Ubiquinol|QH<sub>2</sub>]]. The  NADH generated in the TCA cycle may later donate its electrons in [[oxidative phosphorylation]] to drive ATP synthesis; [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FADH<sub>2</sub>]] is covalently attached to [[succinate dehydrogenase]], an enzyme functioning both in the TCA cycle and the mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]] in oxidative phosphorylation. FADH<sub>2</sub>, therefore, facilitates transfer of electrons to [[coenzyme Q]], which is the final electron acceptor of the reaction catalyzed by the Succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex, also acting as an intermediate in the electron transport chain.<ref name="Stryer">{{cite book | author = Stryer L, Berg J, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H.

The GTP that is formed by GDP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase may be utilized by [[nucleoside-diphosphate kinase]] to form ATP (the catalyzed reaction is GTP + ADP → GDP + ATP).<ref name="Stryer"/>

== Products ==
Products of the first turn of the cycle are: ''one GTP (or ATP), three NADH, one QH<sub>2</sub>, two CO<sub>2</sub>''.

Because two acetyl-CoA [[molecules]] are produced from each [[glucose]] molecule, two cycles are required per glucose molecule. Therefore, at the end of two cycles, the products are: two GTP, six NADH, two QH<sub>2</sub>, and four CO<sub>2</sub>''

The above reactions are balanced if P<sub>i</sub> represents the H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> ion, ADP and GDP the ADP<sup>2-</sup> and GDP<sup>2-</sup> ions, respectively, and ATP and GTP the ATP<sup>3-</sup> and GTP<sup>3-</sup> ions, respectively.

The total number of ATP obtained after complete oxidation of one glucose in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and [[oxidative phosphorylation]] is estimated to be between 30 and 38.<ref name="pmid7654171"/>

== Efficiency ==
The theoretical maximum yield of ATP through oxidation of one molecule of glucose  in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and [[oxidative phosphorylation]] is 38 (assuming 3 [[molar equivalent]]s of ATP per equivalent NADH and 2 ATP per FADH<sub>2</sub>).  In eukaryotes, two equivalents of NADH are generated in [[glycolysis]], which takes place in the cytoplasm. Transport of these two equivalents into the mitochondria consumes two equivalents of ATP, thus reducing the net production of ATP to 36. Furthermore, inefficiencies in [[oxidative phosphorylation]] due to leakage of protons across of the mitochondrial membrane and slippage of the [[ATP synthase]]/proton pump commonly reduces the ATP yield from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> to less than the theoretical maximum yield.<ref name="pmid7654171">{{cite journal | author = Porter RK, Brand MD | title = Mitochondrial proton conductance and H+/O ratio are independent of electron transport rate in isolated hepatocytes | journal = Biochem.

== Regulation ==
The regulation of the TCA cycle is largely determined by product inhibition and substrate availability. The major eventual substrate of the cycle is ADP which gets converted to ATP. A reduced amount of ADP causes accumulation of precursor NADH which in turn can inhibit a number of enzymes.<ref name="MehtaS" /> NADH, a product of all dehydrogenases in the TCA cycle with the exception of [[succinate dehydrogenase]], inhibits [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]], [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]],  [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]], and also [[citrate synthase]]. [[Acetyl-coA]] inhibits [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]], while [[succinyl-CoA]] inhibits alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and [[citrate synthase]]. When tested in vitro with TCA enzymes,  ATP inhibits [[citrate synthase]] and [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]]; however, ATP levels do not change more than 10% in vivo between rest and vigorous exercise. There is no known [[allosteric]] mechanism that can account for large changes in reaction rate from an [[allosteric]] effector whose concentration changes less than 10%.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Voet D, Voet JG | year = 2004 | title = Biochemistry | edition = 3rd | publisher = John Wiley & Sons, Inc. | location = New York | page = 615}}</ref>

Citrate is used for feedback inhibition, as it inhibits [[phosphofructokinase]], an enzyme involved in [[glycolysis]] that catalyses formation of [[fructose 1,6-bisphosphate]],a precursor of pyruvate. This prevents a constant high rate of flux when there is an accumulation of citrate and a decrease in substrate for the enzyme.

Recent work has demonstrated an important link between intermediates of the citric acid cycle and the regulation of [[hypoxia-inducible factors]] ([[HIF1A|HIF]]). HIF plays a role in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis, and is a transcription factor that targets angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, glucose utilization, iron transport and apoptosis. HIF is synthesized consititutively, and hydroxylation of at least one of two critical proline residues mediates their interaction with the von Hippel Lindau [[E3 ubiquitin ligase]] complex, which targets them for rapid degradation. This reaction is catalysed by [[prolyl hydroxylase|prolyl 4-hydroxylase]]s. Fumarate and succinate have been identified as potent inhibitors of prolyl hydroxylases, thus leading to the stabilisation of HIF.<ref name="pmid17182618">{{cite journal | author = Koivunen P, Hirsilä M, Remes AM, Hassinen IE, Kivirikko KI, Myllyharju J | title = Inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) hydroxylases by citric acid cycle intermediates: possible links between cell metabolism and stabilization of HIF | journal = J.

== Major metabolic pathways converging on the TCA cycle ==
Several [[catabolic]] pathways converge on the TCA cycle. Reactions that form intermediates of the TCA cycle in order to replenish them (especially during the scarcity of the intermediates) are called [[anaplerotic reactions]].

The citric acid cycle is the third step in [[carbohydrate catabolism]] (the breakdown of sugars). Glycolysis breaks glucose (a six-carbon-molecule) down into [[pyruvate]] (a three-carbon molecule). In [[eukaryote]]s, pyruvate moves into the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. It is converted into acetyl-CoA by [[pyruvate decarboxylation|decarboxylation]] and enters the citric acid cycle.

In [[protein catabolism]], [[protein]]s are broken down by [[protease]]s into their constituent amino acids. The carbon backbone of these [[amino acid]]s can become a source of energy by being converted to acetyl-CoA and entering into the citric acid cycle.

In [[fat catabolism]], [[triglyceride]]s are [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] to break them into [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]]. In the liver the glycerol can be converted into glucose via [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] and [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] by way of [[gluconeogenesis]]. In many tissues, especially heart tissue, fatty acids are broken down through a process known as [[beta oxidation]], which results in acetyl-CoA, which can be used in the citric acid cycle. Beta oxidation of fatty acids with an odd number of [[methylene bridge]]s produces [[propionyl CoA]], which is then converted into [[succinyl-CoA]] and fed into the citric acid cycle.<ref name="pmid2647392">{{cite journal | author = Halarnkar PP, Blomquist GJ | title = Comparative aspects of propionate metabolism | journal = Comp. Biochem. Physiol., B | volume = 92 | issue = 2 | pages = 227–31 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2647392 | doi = 10.1016/0305-0491(89)90270-8 }}</ref>

The total energy gained from the complete breakdown of one molecule of glucose by [[glycolysis]], the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation equals about 30 ATP molecules, in eukaryotes. The citric acid cycle is called an [[amphibolic]] pathway because it participates in both [[catabolism]] and [[anabolism]].
