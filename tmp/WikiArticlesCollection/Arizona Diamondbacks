The '''Arizona Diamondbacks''' are a [[professional baseball|professional baseball team]] based in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. They play in the [[National League West|West Division]] of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[National League]]. Since the team's inception in 1998, they have played at [[Chase Field]]. Also known as the '''D-Backs,''' Arizona has one [[World Series]] title, in [[2001 World Series|2001]], becoming the fastest [[expansion team]] in the majors to win a championship, doing it in only the fourth season since their expansion in [[1998 Major League Baseball season|1998]].

==Franchise history==
{{Main|History of the Arizona Diamondbacks}}

Baseball had a rich tradition in Arizona long before talk of bringing a big-league team even started. The state has been a frequent [[spring training]] site since [[1946 Major League Baseball season|1946]]. With a large number of people relocating to the state from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], as well as from California, many teams (most notably the [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Chicago White Sox]], [[New York Yankees]], [[New York Mets]], [[San Francisco Giants]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]) have normally had large followings in Arizona.

On March 9, 1995, Arizona was [[1998 Major League Baseball expansion|awarded a franchise]] to begin play for the 1998 season. A $130&nbsp;million franchise fee was paid to Major League Baseball and on January 16, 1997, the Diamondbacks were officially voted into the National League.<ref>{{cite news|title=Baseball Expansion Teams Put in Leagues|date=January 17, 1997|unused_data=Southeastern Missourian}}</ref>

Since their debut, the Diamondbacks have won five [[National League West]] titles, one National League Championship pennant and the [[2001 World Series]].

==Logos==
{{expand section|date=May 2012}}

The Diamondbacks' original colors were [[purple]], [[black]], [[turquoise (color)|turquoise]] and [[copper (color)|copper]].<ref name="purplesedonared">[http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20061108&content_id=1737471&vkey=pr_ari&fext=.jsp&c_id=ari "D-backs shed their skin after unveiling new uniforms, colors on runway," Arizona Diamondbacks press release, Wednesday, November 8, 2006.]</ref> Their first logo was an italicized block letter "A" with a diamond pattern and a snake's tongue. Prior to their inaugural season, they released their baseball caps. The home cap had a cream color crown with a purple visor and button. The road cap was black and had a turquoise visor and button. Their alternate cap had a turquoise crown with a purple visor and button. Depending on the cap, the "A" logo on the front of the cap had different color variations.

In the Diamondbacks second season, they introduced a new logo which was a copper color snake in the shape of a letter "D". It was used on a solid black cap, which in the beginning, was worn as a road cap.

The franchise unveiled new uniforms and colors of Sedona Red, Sonoran Sand and black on November 8, 2006. The [[red]] shade is named for the [[sandstone]] [[canyon]] at [[Red Rock State Park]] near [[Sedona, Arizona|Sedona]], while the [[beige]] (sand) shade is named for the [[Sonoran Desert]].<ref name="purplesedonared"/> A sleeve patch was added featuring a lowercase "d" and "b" configured to look like a snake's head.<ref name="purplesedonared"/>  The team also kept the "D" logo, but was slightly altered and put on an all red cap to be used as their game cap. They also kept the "A" logo with the new colors applied to it, with a solid black cap used as the alternate cap.

==Media==
The primary television play-by-play voice for the team's first nine seasons of play was [[Thom Brennaman]], who also broadcasts baseball and [[college football]] games nationally for [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox Television]]. Brennaman was the TV announcer for the [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Cincinnati Reds]] (along with his father [[Marty Brennaman]]) before being hired by Diamondbacks founder Jerry Colangelo in 1996, two years before the team would begin play.

In October 2006, Brennaman left the Diamondbacks to call games with his father for the Reds beginning in 2007, signing a four-year deal (his FOX duties remained unchanged).

The English language flagship radio station is [[KTAR (AM)|KTAR]]. [[Greg Schulte]] is the regular radio play-by-play voice, a 25-year veteran of sports radio in the Phoenix market, also well known for his previous work on [[Phoenix Suns]], [[Arizona Cardinals]] and [[Arizona State University]] (ASU) broadcasts.

[[Jeff Munn]] is a backup radio play-by-play announcer; he served as the regular public address announcer at [[Chase Field]] in the early days of the franchise. He is well-known to many Phoenix area sports fans, having also served as the public address announcer for the Suns at America West Arena (now [[US Airways Center]]) in the 1990s. He is also the play-by-play radio voice for ASU women's basketball.

On November 1, 2006, the team announced that the TV voice of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] since 2002, [[Daron Sutton]], would be hired as the Diamondbacks primary TV play-by-play voice. Sutton was signed to a five-year contract with a team option for three more years. Sutton is considered one of the best of the younger generation of baseball broadcasters. His signature chants include "lets get some runs" when the D'Backs trail in late innings. Sutton's father is [[Major League Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitcher and current [[Atlanta Braves]] broadcaster [[Don Sutton]].<ref name="mlb3">{{cite web|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20061101&content_id=1729190&vkey=pr_ari&fext=.jsp&c_id=ari|title=MLB.com|publisher=Arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com|date=|accessdate=September 7, 2010}}</ref>

Former Diamondback and Chicago Cub [[Mark Grace]] and former Major League [[knuckleball]] pitcher [[Tom Candiotti]] were the Diamondbacks primary color analysts for the 2006 and 2007 seasons. Former Diamondback player [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] also does color commentary on occasion, as does former [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]] and [[NBC]] broadcast legend [[Joe Garagiola, Sr.]], a longtime Phoenix-area resident and father of [[Joe Garagiola, Jr.]], the first GM of the Diamondbacks (as head of the Maricopa County Sports Authority in the early 1990s, Garagiola, Jr. was one of the primary people involved in Phoenix obtaining a Major League Baseball franchise).

The Diamondbacks announced in July 2007<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20070713&content_id=2084028&vkey=pr_ari&fext=.jsp&c_id=ari|title=FSN Arizona to become exclusive TV home for the D'Backs starting next season &#124; Dbacks.com: Official Info|publisher=Arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com|date=|accessdate=September 7, 2010}}</ref> that for the 2008 season, all regionally broadcast Diamondback TV games will be shown exclusively on [[Fox Sports Arizona]]; and a few could possibly be shown on the national [[Major League Baseball on Fox|MLB on Fox]] telecasts. Fox Sports Arizona (or '''FS'''Arizona) is currently seen in 2.8&nbsp;million households in Arizona & New Mexico. The previous flagship station, since the inaugural 1998 season, was [[KTVK]], a popular over-the-air independent station in Phoenix.

From 2009 to 2012, Mark Grace and Daron Sutton were tagged as the main broadcasters of the Diamondbacks with pre-game and post-game shows on '''FS'''Arizona, being hosted by former big-league closer [[Joe Borowski (baseball)|Joe Borowski]].

On June 21, 2012, Daron Sutton was suspended indefinitely, amidst rumors of insubordination.<ref>{{cite web|last=Piecoro|first=Nick|title=Arizona Diamondbacks SS Stephen Drew's ankle holds up|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/20120627arizona-diamondbacks-ss-stephen-drews-ankle-holds-up.html|publisher=azcentral.com|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref> Then on August 24, the team announced that Mark Grace had requested an indefinite leave of absence after being arrested for his second DUI in less than two years.<ref>{{cite web|last=Boivin|first=Paola|title=Arizona Diamondbacks hit hard again in the public eye|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/20120824arizona-diamondbacks-hit-hard-again-public-eye.html|publisher=azcentral|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref> (Grace was later indicted on four DUI counts<ref>{{cite web|last=Merrill|first=Laurie|title=Mark Grace indicted on 4 DUI counts|url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/20121025mark-grace-indicted-dui-counts.html|work=The Republic|publisher=azcentral.com|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref>) For the remainder of the 2012 season, Sutton was replaced by Greg Schulte (Jeff Munn replaced Schulte on the radio broadcast) and Grace was replaced by Luis Gonzalez. At the end of the 2012 season, the team announced that neither Sutton nor Grace would be returning for the 2013 season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Marotta|first=Vince|title=Daron Sutton, Mark Grace out as Arizona Diamondbacks broadcasters|url=http://arizonasports.com/42/1579872/Darron-Sutton-Mark-Grace-out-as-Arizona-Diamondbacks-broadcasters|work=Arizona Sports|publisher=arizonasports.com|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref>

On October 18, 2012, the team announced that [[Bob Brenly]] would be returning as a broadcaster, and that he would be joined by then-[[ESPN]] personality [[Steve Berthiaume]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Piecoro|first=Nick|title=Arizona Diamondbacks name Steve Berthiaume, Bob Brenly as TV announcing team|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/20121018arizona-diamondbacks-announcers-bob-brenly-steve-berthiaume.html|work=azcentral sports|publisher=azcentral.com|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref>

;Spanish broadcasts
The flagship Spanish language radio station is [[KBMB|AM 710]] with Miguel Quintana, Richard Saenz and Oscar Soria.

Games were televised in Spanish on [[KPHE-LD|KPHE-LP]]â€”with Oscar Soria and Jerry Romo as the announcersâ€”but this arrangement ended prior to the 2009 season due to the team switching fully to [[Fox Sports Arizona]] and the lack of carriage of KHPE-LP on the Cox cable system.<ref name="azc1">{{cite web|last=Piecoro|first=Nick|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/2009/01/22/20090122spt-dbackstv.html|title=No Spanish TV broadcasts for D'Backs|publisher=Azcentral.com|date=January 22, 2009|accessdate=September 7, 2010}}</ref>
