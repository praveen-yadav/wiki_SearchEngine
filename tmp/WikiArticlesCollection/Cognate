In [[linguistics]], '''cognates''' are words that have a common [[etymology|etymological]] origin. This learned term derives from the Latin ''[[:wikt:cognatus|cognatus]]'' (blood relative).<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/cognate "cognate"], ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', 4th ed.: "Latin ''cognātus'': ''co-'', co- + ''gnātus'', born, past participle of ''nāscī'', to be born." Other definitions of the English word include "[r]elated by blood; having a common ancestor" and "[r]elated or analogous in nature, character, or function". ''Ibid.''</ref> 

For example, the English words ''shirt'' and ''skirt'' are [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]]; the former derives from the [[Old English]] ''sċyrte'', while the latter is [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|loaned from Old Norse]] ''skyrta'', both of which derive from the [[Proto-Germanic]] ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/skurtijǭ|*skurtijǭ]]''. Additional cognates of the same word in other [[Germanic languages]] include the German ''Schürze'' and Dutch ''schort'' (which both mean "apron").

==Characteristics of cognate words==
Cognates do not need to have the same meaning, which [[semantic drift|may have changed]] as the languages developed separately. For example, consider [[English language|English]] ''[[wikt:starve#English|starve]]'' and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''[[wikt:sterven#Dutch|sterven]]'' or [[German language|German]] ''[[wikt:sterben|sterben]]'' ("to die"); these three words all derive from the same [[Proto-Germanic]] root, ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/sterbaną|*sterbaną]]'' ("die"). [[English language|English]] ''[[wikt:dish#English|dish]]'' and [[German language|German]] ''[[wikt:Tisch#German|Tisch]]'' ("table"), with their flat surfaces, both come from [[Latin Language|Latin]] ''[[wikt:discus#Latin|discus]]'', but it would be a mistake to identify their later meanings.<ref>''Discus'' is itself from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''δίσκος'' (from the verb ''δικεῖν'' "to throw"). A later and ''separate'' English reflex of ''discus'', probably through [[medieval Latin]] ''desca'', is ''[[wikt:desk#English|desk]]'' (see [[OED]] s.v. ''desk'').</ref>

==Cognates across languages==
Examples of cognates in [[Indo-European languages]] are the words ''night'' ([[English language|English]]), ''nuit'' ([[French language|French]]), ''Nacht'' ([[German language|German]]), ''nacht'' ([[Dutch Language|Dutch]]), ''nag'' ([[Afrikaans Language|Afrikaans]]), ''nicht'' ([[Scots language|Scots]]), ''natt'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''nat'' ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''nátt'' ([[Faroese language|Faroese]]), ''nótt'' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]), ''noc'' ([[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Polish language|Polish]]), ночь, ''noch'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]), ноќ, ''noć'' ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]), нощ, ''nosht'' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]), ''ніч'', ''nich'' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]), ''ноч'', ''noch''/''noč'' ([[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]), ''noč'' ([[Slovene language|Slovene]]), ''noć'' ([[Serbo-Croatian]]), νύξ, ''nyx'' ([[Ancient Greek]], ''νύχτα''/''nychta'' in [[Modern Greek]]), ''nox/nocte'' ([[Latin]]), ''nakt-'' ([[Sanskrit]]), ''natë'' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]), ''noche'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''nos'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]), ''nueche'' ([[Asturian language|Asturian]]), ''noite'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]), ''notte'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''nit'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''nuèch/nuèit'' ([[Occitan language|Occitan]]), ''noapte'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]), ''nakts'' ([[Latvian Language|Latvian]]) and  ''naktis'' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), all meaning "night" and derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ([[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]]) {{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/nókʷts|*nókʷts]]}}, "night".   

Another Indo-European example is ''star'' ([[English language|English]]), ''str-'' ([[Sanskrit]]), ''tara'' ([[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]), ''étoile'' ([[French language|French]]), ''ἀστήρ (astēr)'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] or ''ἀστέρι''/''ἄστρο'', ''asteri''/''astro'' in [[Modern Greek]]), ''stella'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''aster'' ([[Latin]]) ''stea'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]]), ''stairno'' ([[Gothic language|Gothic]]), ''astl'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]), ''Stern'' ([[German language|German]]), ''ster'' (Dutch and [[Afrikaans]]), ''starn'' (Scots), ''stjerne'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and Danish), ''stjarna'' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]), ''stjärna'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), ''stjørna'' ([[Faroese language|Faroese]]), ''setāre'' ([[Persian language|Persian]]), ''stoorei'' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]), ''seren'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]), ''steren'' ([[Cornish language|Cornish]]), ''estel'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''estela'' ([[Occitan language|Occitan]]) ''estrella'' and ''astro'' [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''estrella'' [[Asturian language|Asturian]] and [[Leonese language|Leonese]], ''estrela'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]) and ''estêre'' or ''stêrk'' ([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]), from the PIE {{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/h₂stḗr|*h₂stḗr]]}}, "star". 

The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{lang|he|שלום}} ''shalom'', the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|سلام}} ''salām'' and the [[Amharic language|Amharic]] ''selam'' ("peace") are also cognates, derived from [[Proto-Semitic]] [[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Semitic/šalām-|*šalām-]].

Cognates may often be less easily recognised than the above examples and authorities sometimes differ in their interpretations of the evidence. The English word ''[[wikt:milk#English|milk]]'' is clearly a cognate of German ''[[wikt:Milch#German|Milch]]'', Dutch ''[[wikt:melk#Dutch|melk]]'', Russian ''[[wikt:mолоко#Russian|молоко (moloko)]]'' and Croatian ''[[wikt:mlijeko#Serbo-Croatian|mlijeko]]''.<ref>Cf. also Greek [[wikt:ἀμέλγω#Ancient_Greek|ἀμέλγω]] ''amelgō'' "to milk".</ref> On the other hand, French ''[[wikt:lait#French|lait]]'' and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''[[wikt:leche#Spanish|leche]]'' (both meaning "milk") are less obviously cognates of [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|[[wikt:γάλακτος#Ancient_Greek|γάλακτος]]}}'' ''gálaktos'' (genitive singular of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:γάλα#Ancient_Greek|γάλα]]}} ''gála'', "milk"), a relationship more evidently seen through the intermediate Latin ''[[wikt:lac#Latin|lac]]'' "milk", as well as the English word ''[[wikt:lactic#English|lactic]]'' and other terms borrowed from Latin. At times, cognates may even be opposites. For instance, while the Hebrew word {{lang|he|חוצפה}} ''[[chutzpah]]'' means "impudence," its Classical Arabic cognate {{lang|ar|حصافة}} ''ḥaṣāfah'' means "sound judgment;"<ref>{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Hans|authorlink=Hans Wehr |editor= J. Milton Cowan| title=[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]] |origyear=1979 |year=1994 |publisher=Spoken Language Services, Inc. |location=[[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], [[Illinois]] |isbn=0-87950-003-4}}
</ref> even more contradictorily, the English word ''[[wikt:black|black]]'' and Polish ''[[wikt:biały|biały]]'', meaning [[white]], both derive from the PIE {{PIE|[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/bʰleg-|*bʰleg-]]}}, meaning, "to burn or shine."

A word may also [[loanword|enter another language]], develop a new form or meaning there, and be re-borrowed into the original language; this is called a ''Rückwanderer'' (German for "one who wanders back"). For example, the Greek word ''κίνημα'' (''kinēma'', "movement") became French ''cinéma'' (cf. American English ''movie'') and then later returned to Greece as ''σινεμά'' (''sinema'', "the art of film", "movie theater"). Now in Greece ''κίνημα'' (''kinēma'', "movement") and ''σινεμά'' (''sinema'', "filmmaking, cinema") exist together as a doublet (see next section).<ref>In fact, ''σινεμά'' stands beside a Greek [[neologism]] based on the original form of the same root: ''κινηματογράφος'' (''kinimatoγráfos''), with the same two meanings as ''cinéma''/''σινεμά''. (The film or movie itself is the unrelated ''ταινία'' (''tainia'').</ref>

==Cognates within the same language==
Cognate [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] can exist within the same language, with meanings which may be anything from slightly to totally different.  For example, English ''ward'' and ''guard'' (<PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/wer-|*wer-]]'', "to perceive, watch out for") are cognates, as are ''shirt'' (garment on top) and ''skirt'' (garment on bottom) (<PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/sker-|*sker-]]'', "to cut").  In some cases, such as "shirt" and "skirt", one of the cognate pairs has an ultimate source in another language related to English, while the other one is native, as happened with many loanwords from [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] borrowed during the [[Danelaw]]. Sometimes, both cognates come from other languages, often the same one but at different times. For example, the word ''chief'' (meaning the leader of any group) comes from the [[Middle French]] ''chef'' ("head"), and its modern pronunciation preserves the Middle French consonant sound; the word ''chef'' (the leader of the cooks) was borrowed from the same source centuries later, by which time the consonant had changed to a "sh"-sound in French.  Such word sets can also be called [[etymological twins]], and of course they may come in groups of higher numbers, as with, for example, the words ''wain'' (native) ''waggon/wagon'' (Dutch) and ''vehicle'' (Latin) in English.

An example of very different and non-obvious English-language cognates is ''grammar'' and ''glamour''.

==False cognates==
{{Main|False cognate}}
[[False cognate]]s are words that are commonly thought to be related (have a common origin) whereas linguistic examination reveals they are unrelated. Thus, for example, on the basis of superficial similarities one might suppose that the Latin verb ''habere'' and German ''haben'', both meaning 'to have', were cognates. However, an understanding of the way words in the two languages evolve from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) roots shows that they cannot be cognate (see for example [[Grimm's law]]).  German ''haben'' (like English ''have'') in fact comes from PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/kh₂pyé-|*kh₂pyé-]]''{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} 'to grasp', and its real cognate in Latin is ''capere'', 'to seize, grasp, capture'.  Latin ''habere'', on the other hand, is from PIE ''*gʰabʰ''{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}, 'to give, to receive', and hence cognate with English ''give'' and German ''geben''.  English ''much'' and Spanish ''mucho'' also look similar and even have a similar meaning yet are not cognates, with ''much'' < Proto-Germanic ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/mikilaz|*mikilaz]]'' < PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/meg-|*meg-]]'', while ''mucho'' < Latin ''multum'' < PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/mel-|*mel-]]''.<ref>[http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/ling001/3-22.pdf Ringe, Don. ''A quick introduction to language change'', 22 March 2010]</ref>

Similarity of words between languages does not prove that the words are related, in much the same way as  facial resemblance does not prove relatedness of people. Over the course of hundreds and thousands of years, words may change their sound completely. For example, English ''over'' and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''′avar'' are not cognates, and neither are English ''dog'' and [[Mbabaram language|Mbabaram]] ''dog''. False cognates arise in the same way as [[False etymology|false or folk etymology]], spurious explanations for the origin of words.

Contrast this with [[false friend]]s, which frequently ''are'' cognate.
