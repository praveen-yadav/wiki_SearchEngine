The '''Apiaceae''' (or '''Umbelliferae'''), commonly known as '''carrot''' or '''parsley family''', are a family of mostly aromatic [[plant]]s with hollow stems. The family is large, with more than 3,700 [[species]] spread across 434 [[genus|genera]]; it is the 16th-largest family of [[flowering plant]]s.<ref name=Stevens>Stevens, P.F. (2001 onwards). [http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/ Angiosperm Phylogeny Website]. Version 9, June 2008.</ref> Included in this family are the well-known plants: [[angelica]], [[anise]], [[arracacha]], [[asafoetida]], [[caraway]], [[carrot]], [[celery]], ''[[Centella asiatica]]'', [[chervil]], [[cicely]], [[coriander]] (including [[cilantro]]), [[cumin]], [[dill]], [[fennel]], [[conium|hemlock]], [[lovage]], [[Queen Anne's lace]], [[parsley]], [[parsnip]], [[Eryngium maritimum|sea holly]], and the now extinct [[silphium]].

== Description ==

Most Apiaceae are [[annual plant|annual]], [[biennial plant|biennial]] or [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[herbaceous plant|herbs]] (frequently with the leaves aggregated toward the base), though a minority are [[shrub]]s or [[tree]]s. Their leaves are of variable size and [[phyllotaxis|alternately arranged]], or alternate with the upper leaves becoming nearly opposite. In some taxa, the texture is leathery, fleshy, or even rigid, but always with [[stoma]]ta. They are [[petiole (botany)|petiolate]] or perfoliate and more or less sheathing, the blade usually dissected and [[pinnate|pinnatifid]], but entire in some genera. Most commonly, crushing their leaves emits a marked smell, aromatic to foetid, but absent in some members. The flowers are nearly always aggregated in terminal [[umbel]]s, simple or compound, often umbelliform cymes, rarely in heads.

The defining characteristic of this family is the [[inflorescence]]: a simple or compound [[umbel]]. Flowers across the Apiaceae are fairly uniform and are usually perfect ([[hermaphroditic]]) and [[Floral symmetry|actinomorphic]], but some are [[plant sexual morphology|andromonoecious, polygamomonoecious, or even dioecious]] (as in ''[[Acronema]]''), with a distinct [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] and [[corolla (flower)|corolla]], but the calyx if often highly reduced, to the point of being undetectable in many species, while the corolla can be white, yellow, pink or purple. The flowers are nearly perfectly pentamerous, with 5 [[petals]], [[sepals]], and [[stamens]].
The [[androecium]] contains of 5 stamens, but there is often variation in the functionality of the [[stamen]]s even within a single inflorescence. Some flowers are functionally staminate (where a pistil may be present but has no ovules capable of being fertilized) while others are functionally pistillate (where stamens are present but their anthers do not produce viable pollen). Pollination of one flower by the pollen of a different flower of the same plant ([[geitonogamy]]) is common. The [[gynoecium]] consists of two carpels fused into a single, bicarpellate pistil with an inferior ovary. When mature, the fused carpels separate into two [[schizocarp|mericarps]]. 
Stylopodiums secrete nectar, attracting pollinators like flies, mosquitoes, gnats, beetles, moths, and bees.

The fruits are nonfleshy [[schizocarp]] of two mericarps, each with a single seed; they separate at maturity and are dispersed by wind. Some fruit segments (like those in [[''Daucus'' spp.]] are covered in bristles and spread via external transport. The seeds have an oily [[endosperm]]<ref name=Watson>Watson, L., Dallwitz, M.J. (1992 onwards) [http://delta-intkey.com/angio/ The families of flowering plants: descriptions, illustrations, identification, and information retrieval]. Version: 4 March 2011.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=She, M., Pu, F., Pan, Z., Watson, M., Cannon, J.F.M., Holmes-Smith, I., Kljuykov, E.V., Phillippe, L.R., Pimenov, M.G. |year=2005|title= Apiaceae|journal=Flora of China|volume=14|pages=1–205|url= http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=10052}}</ref> and generally contain large quantities of fatty oils, with the fatty acid petroselinic acid occurring universally throughout the family while rarely being found outside of the Apiaceae.

== Systematics ==

The family is solidly placed within the [[Apiales]] order in the [[APG III system|APG III classification system]]. It is closely related to [[Araliaceae]] and the boundaries between these families remain unclear. Traditionally groups within the family have been delimited largely based on fruit [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], and the results from this have not been congruent with the more recent molecular [[phylogenetic]] analyses. The subfamilial and tribal classification for the family is currently in a state of flux, with many of the groups being found to be grossly [[paraphyletic]] or [[polyphyletic]].<ref name=Stevens/>

== Etymology ==

Apiaceae was first described by [[John Lindley]] in 1836.<ref>Lindley, J. (1836) An Introduction to the Natural System of Botany, 2nd Edition. Longman, London.</ref> The name is derived from the type genus ''[[Apium]]'', which was originally used by [[Pliny the Elder]] circa 50 AD for a [[celery]]-like plant.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael G. Simpson|title=Plant Systematics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dj8KRImgyf4C|accessdate=14 April 2012|date=20 July 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-374380-0}}</ref> The alternative name for the family, Umbelliferae, derives from the [[inflorescence]] being generally in the form of a compound [[umbel]]. 
The family was one of the first to be recognized as a distinct group in Jacques Daleschamps' 1586 ''Historia generalis plantarum''. With [[Robert Morison|Robert Morison’s]] 1672 ''Plantarum umbelilliferarum distribution nova'' it became the first group of plants for which a systematic study was published.

== Ecology ==
The black swallowtail butterfly, ''[[Papilio polyxenes]]'', utilizes the Apiaceae family for food and host plants during [[oviposition]].<ref>Hall, Donald W. 2011 "Featured Creatures - Eastern Black Swallowtail." Entomology and Nematology Department, University of Florida. http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/bfly/bfly2/eastern_black_swallowtail.htm#life </ref>

== Uses ==

=== Cultivation ===

Many members of this family are cultivated for various purposes. The plant structure includes a [[tap root]], which can be large enough to be useful in food, as with [[parsnip]]s (''Pastinaca sativa''), [[carrot]]s (''Daucus carota''), and [[Hamburg parsley#Root parsley|Hamburg parsley]] (''Petroselinum crispum''). Many plants of this group are also adapted to conditions that encourage heavy concentrations of [[essential oil]]s, and as a result some are flavourful aromatic herbs. Examples are [[parsley]] (''Petroselinum crispum''), [[coriander]] (''Coriandrum sativum''), and [[dill]] (''Anethum graveolens''). The plentiful seeds of the umbels, likewise, are sometimes used in cuisine, as with, coriander (''Coriandrum sativum''), [[fennel]] (''Foeniculum vulgare''), [[cumin]] (''Cuminum cyminum''), and [[caraway]] (''Carum carvi'').

Other notable cultivated Apiaceae include [[chervil]] (''Anthriscus cerefolium''), [[angelica]] (''Angelica'' spp.), [[celery]] (''Apium graveolens''), [[arracacha]] (''Arracacia xanthorrhiza''), [[conium|poison hemlock]] (''Conium maculatum''), [[Eryngium maritimum|sea holly]] (''Eryngium'' spp.), [[asafoetida]] (''Ferula asafoetida''), [[galbanum]] (''Ferula gummosa''), [[cicely]] (''Myrrhis odorata''), [[anise]] (''Pimpinella anisum''), [[lovage]] (''Levisticum officinale''), and [[Hacquetia epipactis|hacquetia]] (''Hacquetia epipactis'').<ref name=Watson/>

=== Companion plants ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
Almost every widely cultivated plant of this group is a [[companion plant]]. In large part, this is because the tiny flowers forming the umbels, are perfectly suited for [[ladybug]]s, [[parasitic wasp]]s, and predatory [[flies]], which actually drink nectar when not reproducing. They then will prey upon insect pests on nearby plants.

Some of the plants are herbs that produce enough scent to possibly dilute the odours of nearby plants, or the [[pheromone]]s emitted by insects that find those plants, which would otherwise attract more pests.

=== Folk medicine ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
Many plants in this family, such as [[wild carrot]], have [[estrogen]]ic properties and have been used as a [[folk medicine]] for [[birth control]]. Most notable for this use is the extinct giant fennel, [[silphium]].
''[[Conium#Conicum malculatum|Conium maculatum]]'' has been used as a sedative and in treatments for arthritis and asthma in addition to its most famous use: as a “humane” method of killing criminals and philosophers. 
''[[Daucus carota]]'' has been used as a diuretic, as a stimulant, to aid in uterine ailments, and one time as a treatment for [[jaundice]].
According to the Greek physician and botanist [[Dioscorides]], “[[Parsley|[Parsley] ]]—especially Bastard or Wild Parsley—provokes venery and bodily lust and erection of the parts.” [[Fennel]] has been used to treat nausea; species of [[Ferula]] have been used to ease constipation and coughs; [[cumin]] has been used as a treatment for diarrhea; [[coriander]] for halitosis; ''[[Eryngium]]'' spp. to treat genitourinary problems; [[Centella asiatica]] to treat [[syphilis]]; and ''[[Asafoetida|Ferula assa-foetida]]'' has been used as a carminative, antispasmodic, and stimulant.

=== Other uses ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
The poisonous members of the Apiaceae have been used for a variety of purposes globally. The poisonous ''[[Water dropwort|Oenanthe crocata]]'' has been used to stupefy fish, ''[[Cicuta douglasii]]'' has been used as an aid in suicides, and arrow poisons have been made from various other family species.

''[[Daucus carota]]'' has been used as coloring for butter and its roots used as a coffee substitute.

''[[Dorema ammoniacum]]'', ''[[Ferula galbaniflua]]'', and ''[[Ferula sumbul]]'' are sources of [[incense]]. 

The woody [[Yareta|''Azorella compacta'' Phil.]] has been used in South America for fuel.

== Chemistry ==
[[Polyacetylene]]s can be found in Apiaceae vegetables like [[carrot]], [[celery]], [[fennel]], [[parsley]] and [[parsnip]] where they show cytotoxic activities.<ref>Polyacetylenes from the Apiaceae Vegetables Carrot, Celery, Fennel, Parsley, and Parsnip and Their Cytotoxic Activities. Christian Zidorn, Karin Jöhrer, Markus Ganzera, Birthe Schubert, Elisabeth Maria Sigmund, Judith Mader, Richard Greil, Ernst P. Ellmerer and Hermann Stuppner, J. Agric. Food Chem., 2005, 53 (7), pages 2518–2523, {{doi|10.1021/jf048041s}}</ref> Many species contain [[coumarin]]s or coumarin derivatives, such as [[furanocoumarin]]s.
