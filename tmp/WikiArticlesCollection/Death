'''Death''' is the cessation of all [[biological process|biological function]]s that sustain a [[life|living]] [[organism]]. [[Phenomenon|Phenomena]] which commonly bring about death include [[Senescence|biological aging]] ([[Wiktionary:senescence|senescence]]), [[predation]], [[malnutrition]], [[disease]], [[suicide]], [[murder]] and [[accident]]s or trauma resulting in terminal [[Trauma (medicine)|injury]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Zimmerman|first=Leda|title=Must all organisms age and die?|url=http://engineering.mit.edu/live/news/1223-must-all-organisms-age-and-die|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Engineering|accessdate=5 February 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101101081710/http://engineering.mit.edu/live/news/1223-must-all-organisms-age-and-die|archivedate=1 November 2010|date=19 October 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> Bodies of living organisms begin to [[Decomposition|decompose]] shortly after death.

In human societies, the nature of death and humanity's awareness of its own mortality has for millennia been a concern of the world's [[religious traditions]] and of [[philosophy|philosophical inquiry]]. This includes belief in [[resurrection]] (associated with [[Abrahamic religions]]), [[reincarnation]] or rebirth (associated with [[Dharmic religions]]), or that consciousness permanently ceases to exist, known as [[oblivion (eternal)|oblivion]] (often associated with [[atheism]]).<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fuKB8MPMdG4C&pg=PA18&dq=&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WjUtT9yhJY268gPCwMz_Dg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false Handbook to the Afterlife] retrieved 12 April 2012</ref>

Commemoration ceremonies after death may include various [[mourning]] or [[funeral]] practices. The physical remains of a person, commonly known as a ''corpse'' or ''body'', are usually [[burial|interred]] whole or [[cremated]], though among the world's cultures there are a variety of other methods of [[Disposal of human corpses|mortuary disposal]]. In the English language, blessings directed towards a dead person include ''[[rest in peace]]'', or its [[Acronym#Nomenclature|initialism]] RIP.

The most common cause of [[human]] deaths in the world is [[Ischaemic heart disease|heart disease]], followed by [[stroke]] and other [[cerebrovascular diseases]], and in the third place [[Lower respiratory tract infection|lower respiratory infections]].<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/index.html The top 10 causes of death] updated June 2011, retrieved 16 October 2012</ref>

== Etymology ==
The word death comes from [[Old English]] deað, which in turn comes from Proto-Germanic *dauþaz (reconstructed by etymological analysis).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=5 November 2013}}</ref> This comes from the Proto-Indo-European stem *dheu- meaning the "Process, act, condition of dying".

== Associated terms ==

The concept and symptoms of death, and varying degrees of delicacy used in discussion in public forums, have generated numerous scientific, legal, and socially acceptable terms or euphemisms for death.  When a person has died, it is also said they have ''passed away'', ''passed on'', or ''expired'', among numerous other socially accepted, religiously specific, slang, and irreverent terms. Bereft of life, the dead person is then a ''corpse'', ''[[cadaver]]'', a ''body'', a ''set of remains'', and finally a [[skeleton]].  The terms ''[[carrion]]'' and ''carcass'' can also be used, though these more often connote the remains of non-human animals.  As a polite reference to a dead person, it has become common practice to use the [[participle]] form of "decease", as in ''the deceased''; the noun form is ''decedent''.  The ashes left after a [[cremation]] are sometimes referred to by the [[neologism]] ''cremains'', a blend of "cremation" and "remains".

== Senescence ==
[[File:Dead magpie.jpg|thumb|A dead [[Eurasian Magpie]]]]

Almost all [[animal]]s who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from [[Senescence|biological aging]], known in life sciences as “[[Wiktionary:senescence|senescence]]”. One of the very few known possible exceptions is the jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', thought to be, in effect, [[biological immortality|immortal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/turritopsis-nutricula-immortal-jellyfish.html |title=Turritopsis nutricula (Immortal jellyfish) |publisher=Jellyfishfacts.net}}</ref> Unnatural causes of death include [[suicide]] and [[homicide]].

== Signs of biological death ==
[[File:Dead rat blood.JPG|thumb|upright|A dead [[Rat]]]]

Signs of death or strong indications that an animal is no longer alive are:
* Cessation of breathing
* [[Cardiac arrest]] (no [[heart rate|pulse]])
* {{lang|la|''[[Pallor mortis]]''}}, paleness which happens in the 15–120 minutes after death
* {{lang|la|''[[Livor mortis]]''}}, a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body
* {{lang|la|''[[Algor mortis]]''}}, the reduction in body temperature following death. This is generally a steady decline until matching ambient temperature
* {{lang|la|''[[Rigor mortis]]''}}, the limbs of the corpse become stiff (Latin ''rigor'') and difficult to move or manipulate
* [[Decomposition]], the reduction into simpler forms of matter, accompanied by a strong, unpleasant odor.

The concept of death is a key to human understanding of the phenomenon.<ref name="MohammadSamir">Mohammad Samir Hossain and Peter Gilbert. 2010. Concepts of Death: A key to our adjustment. ''Illness, Crisis and Loss'', Vol 18. No 1</ref> There are many scientific approaches to the concept. For example, [[brain death]], as practiced in medical science, defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceases.<ref name="MohammadSamir" /><ref>[http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf Additional Lifespan Development Topics] McGraw-Hill Companies</ref><ref>[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Fenwick%20Book%20Review%20Human%20Immortality;%20%20Death%20and%20Adjustment%20Hypotheses%20Elaborated.x.x.pdf Human Immortality; Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated.] Book Review by Dr. Peter Fenwick</ref><ref>[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf Facing the finality – Death and Adjustment Hypotheses] Dr. Mohammad Samir Hossain, 2009</ref>

One of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from [[life]]. As a point in time, death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends. However, determining when death has occurred requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is problematic because there is little consensus over how to define life. This general problem applies to the particular challenge of defining death in the context of medicine.

It is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died. One of the notable flaws in this approach, however, is that there are many organisms which are alive but probably not conscious (for example, single-celled organisms). Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers.  Additionally, many religious traditions, including [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] and [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic]] traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness.  In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event.  It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.<ref>1991 Metcalf, Peter & Richard Huntington.  Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual. Cambridge Press, New York. Print.</ref>

Other definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of something.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary</ref> In this context "death" describes merely the state where something has ceased, for example, life. Thus, the definition of "life" simultaneously defines death.

Historically, attempts to define the exact moment of a human's death have been problematic. Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt defibrillation have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events which were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.

Today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to "[[brain death]]" or "biological death" to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of [[consciousness]]. However, suspension of consciousness must be permanent, and not transient, as occurs during certain [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|sleep]] stages, and especially a [[coma]]. In the case of sleep, [[electroencephalography|EEGs]] can easily tell the difference.

However, the category of "brain death" is seen by some scholars to be problematic. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: "By the late 1990s, however, the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant "brain-dead" women)."<ref name=Miller>FG Miller "Death and organ donation: back to the future" Journal of Medical Ethics 2009;35:616-620</ref>

Those people maintaining that only the [[neo-cortex]] of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of [[cognition|cognitive]] function, as evidenced by the death of the [[cerebral cortex]]. All hope of recovering human thought and [[personality psychology|personality]] is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology. However, at present, in most places the more conservative definition of death – irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex – has been adopted (for example the [[Uniform Determination Of Death Act]] in the [[United States]]). In 2005, the [[Terri Schiavo case]] brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].

Even by whole-brain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated. EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain [[drugs]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], or [[hypothermia]] can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis. Because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving EEGs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.

In the United States, a person is dead by law if a Statement of Death or [[Death certificate]] is approved by a licensed medical practitioner. Various legal consequences follow death, including the removal from the person of what in legal terminology is called [[personhood]].

The possession of brain activities, or capability to resume brain activity, is a [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary condition]] to legal personhood in the United States. "It appears that once brain death has been determined&nbsp;... no criminal or civil liability will result from disconnecting the life-support devices." (Dority v. Superior Court of [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], 193 Cal.Rptr. 288, 291 (1983))

=== Misdiagnosed ===
{{See also|Premature burial}}

There are many anecdotal references to people being declared dead by physicians and then "coming back to life", sometimes days later in their own coffin, or when [[embalming]] procedures are about to begin. From the mid-18th century onwards, there was an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive,<ref>{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=77}}</ref> and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before [[burial]], ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet or into the [[rectum]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|pp=56,&nbsp;71.}}</ref> Writing in 1895, the physician J.C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700&nbsp;people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=239}}</ref>

In cases of [[electric shock]], [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) for an hour or longer can allow stunned [[nerve]]s to recover, allowing an apparently dead person to survive. People found unconscious under icy water may survive if their faces are kept continuously cold until they arrive at an [[emergency department|emergency room]].<ref name=Limmer>Limmer, D. et al. (2006). Emergency care (AHA update, Ed. 10e). [[Prentice Hall]].</ref> This "diving response", in which [[metabolism|metabolic activity]] and oxygen requirements are minimal, is something humans share with [[cetacea]]ns called the [[mammalian diving reflex]].<ref name=Limmer/>

As medical technologies advance, ideas about when death occurs may have to be re-evaluated in light of the ability to restore a person to vitality after longer periods of apparent death (as happened when CPR and defibrillation showed that cessation of heartbeat is inadequate as a decisive indicator of death). The lack of electrical brain activity may not be enough to consider someone scientifically dead. Therefore, the concept of [[information-theoretic death]] has been suggested as a better means of defining when true death occurs, though the concept has few practical applications outside of the field of [[cryonics]].

There have been some scientific attempts to bring dead organisms back to life, but with limited success.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,160903,00.html |title=Blood Swapping Reanimates Dead Dogs |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=2005-06-28 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}</ref> In [[science fiction]] [[scenario]]s where such technology is readily available, real death is distinguished from reversible death.

== Causes ==

The leading cause of death in [[developing countries]] is [[infectious disease]]. The leading causes of death in [[developed countries]] are [[atherosclerosis]] ([[heart disease]] and [[stroke]]), [[cancer]], and other diseases related to [[obesity]] and [[aging]]. By extremely wide margin, the largest unifying cause of death in the developed world is biological aging,<ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/> leading to various complications known as [[aging-associated diseases]]. These conditions cause loss of [[homeostasis]], leading to [[cardiac arrest]], causing loss of [[oxygen]] and nutrient supply, causing irreversible deterioration of the [[Human brain|brain]] and other [[tissue (biology)|tissues]].

=== Autopsy ===

An [[autopsy]], also known as a ''postmortem examination'' or an ''obduction'', is a [[medical procedure]] that consists of a thorough [[examination]] of a human [[dead body|corpse]] to determine the cause and manner of a person's death and to evaluate any [[disease]] or [[injury]] that may be present. It is usually performed by a specialized [[physician|medical doctor]] called a [[pathologist]].

[[File:The Anatomy Lesson.jpg|thumb|upright|An autopsy is portrayed in ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]
Autopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from [[next of kin]] may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together. Autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices.

A "necropsy" is an older term for a postmortem examination, unregulated, and not always a medical procedure. In modern times the term is more often used in the postmortem examination of the corpses of animals.

== Life extension ==
{{Main|Life extension}}

Life extension refers to an increase in [[maximum life span|maximum]] or [[life expectancy|average lifespan]], especially in humans, by slowing down or reversing the [[senescence|processes of aging]]. Average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age or lifestyle-related afflictions such as [[cancer]], or [[cardiovascular disease]]. Extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]. Maximum lifespan is determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s. Currently, the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is [[calorie restriction]]. Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], or by [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues.

A United States poll found that religious people and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension, while black people and Hispanics have higher rates of support than white people. <ref>http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/</ref> 38 percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured.

Researchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as "biomedical [[gerontologist]]s". They try to understand the nature of aging and they develop treatments to reverse aging processes or to at least slow them down, for the improvement of health and the maintenance of youthful vigor at every stage of life. Those who take advantage of life extension findings and seek to apply them upon themselves are called "life extensionists" or "longevists". The primary life extension strategy currently is to apply available anti-aging methods in the hope of living long enough to benefit from a complete cure to aging once it is developed.

"Infinite Life" refers to the notion that if the universe and time are infinite then all things over a long amount of time would happen again. All matter would cycle and interchange and eventually create exactly the same situations we live in today and possibly other infinite possibilities.

Death is the center of many traditions and organizations; customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world. Much of this revolves around the care of the dead, as well as the [[afterlife]] and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death. The [[disposal of human corpses]] does, in general, begin with the [[last offices]] before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or [[cremation]]. This is not a unified practice; in [[Tibet]], for instance, the body is given a [[sky burial]] and left on a mountain top. Proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer one's spiritual attainments into another body ([[reincarnation]]) are subjects of detailed study in Tibet.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mullin|1999|p=}}</ref> [[Mummification]] or [[embalming]] is also prevalent in some cultures, to retard the rate of [[Decomposition|decay]].

Legal aspects of death are also part of many cultures, particularly the settlement of the deceased [[estate (law)|estate]] and the issues of [[inheritance]] and in some countries, [[inheritance tax]]ation.

[[Capital punishment]] is also a culturally divisive aspect of death. In most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today, the death penalty is reserved for premeditated [[murder]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of [[military justice]]. In some countries, sexual crimes, such as [[adultery]] and [[sodomy]], carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[apostasy]], the formal renunciation of one's religion. In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|retentionist]] countries, [[drug trafficking]] is also a capital offense. In China, [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[political corruption|corruption]] are also punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world [[courts-martial]] have imposed death sentences for offenses such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], and [[mutiny]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |title=Shot at Dawn, campaign for pardons for British and Commonwealth soldiers executed in World War I |accessdate=2006-07-20 |publisher=Shot at Dawn Pardons Campaign}}</ref>

Death in warfare and in [[suicide attack]] also have cultural links, and the ideas of [[dulce et decorum est pro patria mori]], [[mutiny]] punishable by death, grieving relatives of dead soldiers and [[death notification]] are embedded in many cultures. Recently in the western world, with the increase in terrorism following the [[September 11 attacks]], but also further back in time with suicide bombings, [[kamikaze]] missions in [[World War II]] and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history, death for a cause by way of suicide attack, and [[martyrdom]] have had significant cultural impacts.

[[Suicide]] in general, and particularly [[euthanasia]], are also points of cultural debate. Both acts are understood very differently in different cultures. In [[Japan]], for example, ending a life with honor by [[seppuku]] was considered a desirable death, whereas according to traditional Christian and Islamic cultures, [[suicide]] is viewed as a sin. Death is [[death (personification)|personified]] in many cultures, with such symbolic representations as the [[Grim Reaper]], [[Azrael]] and [[Father Time]].

In [[Brazil]], a human death is counted officially when it is registered by existing family members at a cartório, a government-authorized registry.  Before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cartório.  Though a Public Registry Law guarantees all Brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means, of their family members (often children), the Brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs and fees, of filing for a death. For many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, cultural burial, which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate [[mortality rates]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nations|first=Marilyn|coauthors=Amaral, Mara|title=Flesh, Blood, Souls, and Households: Cultural Validity in Mortality Inquiry|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|year=1999|month=Sept|volume=5|issue=3|pages=204–220}}</ref>

Talking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures. Western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect, with an official embalmer and associated rites. Eastern societies (like Indian) may be more open to accepting it as a ''fait accompli'', with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an open air burning-to-ashes of the same.

== Death and consciousness ==

Due to the [[Mind-body problem|mind-body dichotomy]], much interest and debate surround the question of what happens to one's consciousness as one's body dies. The belief in the permanent loss of [[consciousness after death]] is often called "[[Oblivion (eternal)|eternal oblivion]]". Faith or belief that consciousness is preserved after physical death is described by the term "[[afterlife]]." For the scientific aspect of consciousness after death, see the article [[Consciousness after death]].

== In biology ==

After death, the remains of an organism become part of the [[biogeochemical cycle]]. Animals may be [[necrophagy|consumed]] by a [[predator]] or a [[scavenger]]. [[Organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms which recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]]. Examples of detritivores include [[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]] and [[dung beetles]].

[[Microorganism]]s also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. Not all materials need to be decomposed fully, however. [[Coal]], a [[fossil fuel]] formed over vast tracts of time in [[swamp]] ecosystems, is one example.

=== Natural selection ===
{{Main|Competition (biology)|Natural selection|Extinction}}

Contemporary [[history of evolutionary thought|evolutionary theory]] sees death as an important part of the process of [[natural selection]]. It is considered that organisms less [[adaptation|adapted]] to their environment are more likely to die having produced fewer offspring, thereby reducing their contribution to the [[gene pool]]. Their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to [[extinction]] and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as [[speciation]]. Frequency of [[biological reproduction|reproduction]] plays an equally important role in determining species survival: an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] criteria, much greater [[Darwinian fitness|fitness]] than a long-lived organism leaving only one.

=== Extinction ===
{{Main|Extinction}}
[[File:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|upright|A [[dodo]], the bird that became a [[byword]] in the English language for the extinction of a species<ref name="Diamond">{{cite book |last=Diamond |first=Jared |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title= [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]] |publisher=[[W. W. Norton]] |year=1999 |isbn=0-393-31755-2 |pages=43–44 |chapter=Up to the Starting Line}}</ref>]]

Extinction is the cessation of existence of a species or group of [[Taxon|taxa]], reducing [[biodiversity]]. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species (although the [[population bottleneck|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point). Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where species presumed extinct abruptly "reappear" (typically in the [[fossil|fossil record]]) after a period of apparent absence. New species arise through the process of [[speciation]], an aspect of [[evolution]]. New varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]] – and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.

=== Evolution of aging and mortality ===
{{Main|Evolution of aging}}

Inquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age (notable exceptions being ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and the already cited jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', which research shows to be [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]). The evolutionary origin of [[senescence]] remains one of the fundamental puzzles of biology. [[Gerontology]] specializes in the science of human aging processes.

Organisms showing only [[asexual reproduction]] (e.g. [[bacteria]], some [[protists]], like the [[euglenoid]]s and many [[amoebozoan]]s) and [[unicellular]] organisms with [[sexual reproduction]] ([[Colony (biology)|colonial]] or not, like the [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae ''[[Pandorina]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'') are "immortal" at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident. However, in [[multicellular]] organisms, with a division of labor between mortal [[somatic cells|somatic (body) cells]] and "immortal" [[germ cell|germ (reproductive) cells]], death becomes an essential part of life.<ref name=Gilbert>Gilbert SF (2003). Developmental biology, 7th ed., Sunderland, Mass: Sinauer Associates, 34-5. ISBN 0-87893-258-5.</ref>

The ''[[Volvox]]'' algae are among the simplest organisms to exhibit that division of labor between two completely different cell types, and as a consequence include death as a regular, genetically regulated part of its [[Biological life cycle|life history]].<ref name=Gilbert></ref><ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3098969/</ref>
