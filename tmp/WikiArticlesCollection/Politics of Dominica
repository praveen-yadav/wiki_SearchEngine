{{Politics of Dominica}}
'''Politics of Dominica''' takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of Dominica]] is the [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government.  [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[House of Assembly of Dominica|House of Assembly]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

A president and prime minister make up the executive branch. Nominated by the prime minister in consultation with the leader of the opposition party, the president is elected for a 5-year term by the parliament. The president appoints as prime minister the person who command the majority of elected representatives in the parliament and also appoints, on the prime minister's recommendation, members of the parliament  as cabinet ministers. The prime minister and cabinet are responsible to the parliament and can be removed on a no-confidence vote.

==Legislative branch==
{{main|House of Assembly of Dominica}}
The [[House of Assembly of Dominica|House of Assembly]] has 32 members. 21 members are elected for a five-year term in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]]. 9 members are senators appointed by the President; 5 on the advice of the Prime Minister and 4 on the advice of the leader of the opposition. A Speaker is elected by the elected members after an election. There is also 1 ex-officio member, the clerk of the house. The [[head of state]] - the [[president]] -is elected by the House of Assembly. The regional representatives decide whether senators are to be elected or appointed. If appointed, five are chosen by the president with the advice of the prime minister and four with the advice of the opposition leader. If elected, it is by vote of the regional representatives. Elections for representatives and senators must be held at least every 5 years, although the prime minister can call elections any time. 
Dominica has a [[two-party system]], which means that there are two dominant [[political parties]], with extreme difficulty for anybody to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party. Dominica was once a three-party system, but in the past few years the [[Dominica Labour Party]] and the greatly diminished [[Dominica Freedom Party]] have built a coalition.

==Judicial branch==
Dominica's legal system is based on English common law. There are three magistrate's courts, with appeals made to the Eastern Caribbean court of appeal and, ultimately, to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in [[London]].<ref name="Dominican criminal court system">[http://www.acclawyers.org/resources/dominica/ Dominican criminal court system]{{deadlink|date=September 2013}}</ref>

The Court of Appeal of the [[Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court]] is headquartered in Saint Lucia, but at least one of its 16 High Court judges must reside in Dominica and preside over the High Court of Justice. Dominica's current High Court judges are The Hon. [[Brian Cottle]] and The Hon. [[M. E. Birnie Stephenson-Brooks]].<ref name="High Court judges">[http://www.eccourts.org/commonwealth-of-dominica/ Judicial Officers of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court in the Commonwealth of Dominica]</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
Councils elected by universal suffrage govern most towns. Supported largely by property taxation, the councils are responsible for the regulation of markets and sanitation and the maintenance of secondary roads and other municipal amenities. The island also is divided into 10 [[Parishes of Dominica|parishes]], whose governance is unrelated to the town governments: [[Saint Andrew Parish, Dominica|Saint Andrew]], [[Saint David Parish, Dominica|Saint David]],  [[Saint George Parish, Dominica|Saint George]], [[Saint John Parish, Dominica|Saint John]], [[Saint Joseph Parish, Dominica|Saint Joseph]], [[Saint Luke Parish, Dominica|Saint Luke]], [[Saint Mark Parish, Dominica|Saint Mark]], [[Saint Patrick Parish, Dominica|Saint Patrick]], [[Saint Paul Parish, Dominica|Saint Paul]], and [[Saint Peter Parish, Dominica|Saint Peter]].
