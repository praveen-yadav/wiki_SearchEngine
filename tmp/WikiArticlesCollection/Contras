The '''contras''' (some references use the capitalized form, "'''Contras'''") is a label given to the various rebel groups opposing the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] government in [[Nicaragua]] that were active from 1979 through to the early 1990s. Among the separate contra groups, the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]] (FDN) emerged as the largest by far. In 1987, virtually all contra organizations were united, at least nominally, into the [[Nicaraguan Resistance]].

From an early stage, the rebels received financial and military support from the U.S. government, and their military significance decisively depended on it. After U.S. support was banned by [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[Reagan administration]] covertly continued it. These covert activities culminated in the [[Iran–Contra affair]].

The term "contra" comes from the Spanish ''contra'', which means ''against'' but in this case is short for {{lang|es|''la contrarrevolución''}}, in English "the [[counter-revolution]]".  Some rebels disliked being called contras, feeling that it defined their cause only in negative terms, or implied a desire to restore the old order. Rebel fighters usually referred to themselves as {{lang|es|''comandos''}} ("commandos"); peasant sympathizers also called the rebels {{lang|es|''los primos''}} ("the cousins"). From the mid-1980s, as the Reagan administration and the rebels sought to portray the movement as the "democratic resistance", members started describing themselves as {{lang|es|''la resistencia''}}.

During the war against the Sandinista government, the contras carried out many human rights violations, and evidence suggests that these were systematically committed as an element of warfare strategy. Contra supporters often tried to downplay these violations, or countered that the Sandinista government carried out much more. In particular, the Reagan administration engaged in a campaign to alter public opinion on the contras which has been denoted as "white propaganda".

==History==

===Origins===
The Contras were not a monolithic group, but a combination of three distinct elements of Nicaraguan society:<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 29"/>

* Ex-guardsmen of the [[Nicaraguan National Guard]] and other right-wing figures who had fought for Nicaragua's ex-dictator [[Somoza]]<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 29">Lee et al. 1987, p. 29</ref>—these later were especially found in the military wing of the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force|FDN]].<ref>"The contras are made up of a combination of: ex-National Guardsmen (especially the military wing of the FDN),..." As seen at: Gill 1984, p. 204</ref> The [[Carter administration]] had viewed the US-trained Nicaraguan National Guard as a means to keep the Sandinistas from exclusive power,<ref>As explained by [[Robert Pastor]], President Carter's National Security Advisor on Latin America, there was complete agreement that the U.S.-trained National Guard must be kept intact and it was not until 29 June 1979, shortly before the end of Somoza's rule, that anyone in N.S.C. meetings "suggested the central U.S. objective was something other than preventing a Sandinista victory". Pastor questioned "whether one could realistically expect to win over the military leaders of the Sandinistas in the last days of their revolution after they had been fighting U.S. imperialism for two decades... As long as there was any possibility of placing a buffer between them and exclusive power, should we not reach for it?"

===Main groups===
[[File:Contra commandas 1987.jpg|thumb|Contra Commandos from [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force|FDN]] and [[ARDE Frente Sur]], [[Nueva Guinea]] area in 1987]]
[[File:Smoke break el serrano 1987.jpg|thumb|Members of ARDE Frente Sur taking a smoke break after routing the [[FSLN]] garrison at [[El Serrano]] in southeast Nicaragua in 1987.]]

The [[CIA]] and [[Argentine intelligence]], seeking to unify the anti-Sandinista cause before initiating large-scale aid, persuaded 15 September Legion, the UDN and several former smaller groups to merge in September 1981 as the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]] (''Fuerza Democrática Nicaragüense'', FDN).<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/orgs.html</ref> Although the FDN had its roots in two groups made up of former National Guardsmen (of the Somoza regime), its joint political directorate was led by businessman and former anti-Somoza activist [[Adolfo Calero|Adolfo Calero Portocarrero]].<ref>"Although Calero had opposed Somoza, the FDN had its roots in two insurgent groups made up of former National Guardsmen..." As seen at: Lee et al. 1987, p. 29</ref> [[Edgar Chamorro]] later stated that there was strong opposition within the UDN against working with the Guardsmen and that the merging only took place because of insistence by the CIA.<ref>"The UDN, including Cardenal, initially opposed any linkage with the Guardsmen. The CIA, and high-ranking United States Government officiais, insisted that we merge with the Guardsmen. Lt. General Vernon Walters, then a special assistant to the United States Secretary of State (and formerly Deputy Director of the CIA) met with Cardenal to encourage him to accept the CIA's proposal. We were well aware of the crimes the Guardsmen had committed against the Nicaraguan people while in the service of President Somoza and we wanted nothing to do with them. However, we recognized that without help from the United States Government we had no chance of removing the Sandinistas from power, so we eventually acceded to the CIA's, and General Walters', insistence that we join forces with the Guardsmen. Some UDN memhers resigned because they would not associate themselves with the National Guard under any circumstances, but Cardenal and I and others believed the CIA's assurances that we, the civilians, would control the Guardsmen in the new organization that was to he created." As seen at: International Court of Justice (IV) 1986, p. 446</ref>

Based in [[Honduras]], Nicaragua's northern neighbor, under the command of former [[Guardia Nacional (Nicaragua)|National Guard]] Colonel [[Enrique Bermúdez]], the new FDN commenced to draw in other smaller insurgent forces in the north.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Largely financed, trained, equipped, armed and organized by the U.S.,<ref>"On the basis of the available information, the Court is not able to satisfy itself that the Respondent State "created" the contra force in Nicaragua, but holds it established that it largely financed, trained, equipped, armed and organized the FDN, one element of the force."

In April 1982, [[Edén Pastora]] (''Comandante Cero''), one of the heroes in the fight against Somoza, organized the Sandinista Revolutionary Front (FRS) – embedded in the [[Democratic Revolutionary Alliance]] (ARDE)<ref name="Williams">{{Cite news| last = Williams| first = Adam| title = Edén Pastora: A wanted man| work = The Tico Times| accessdate =22 May 2011| date = 26 November 2010| url = http://www.ticotimes.net/News/Top-Story/News/Eden-Pastora-A-wanted-man_Friday-November-26-2010}}</ref> – and declared war on the Sandinista government.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 32">Lee et al. 1987, p. 32</ref> Himself a former Sandinista who had held several high posts in the government, he had resigned abruptly in 1981 and defected,<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 32"/> believing that the newly found power had corrupted the Sandinista's original ideas.<ref name="Williams"/> A popular and charismatic leader, Pastora initially saw his group develop quickly.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 32"/> He confined himself to operate in the southern part of Nicaragua;<ref>"He insisted on operating in the southern part of Nicaragua."

A third force, Misurasata, appeared among the [[Miskito people|Miskito]], [[Sumo (people)|Sumo]] and Rama [[Amerindian]] peoples of Nicaragua's Atlantic coast, who in December 1981 found themselves in conflict with the authorities following the government's efforts to nationalize [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Indian]] land. In the course of this conflict, forced removal of at least 10,000 Indians to relocation centers in the interior of the country and subsequent burning of some villages took place.<ref>The Americas Watch Committee. "Human Rights in Nicaragua 1986" (print), Americas Watch, February 1987.</ref> The Misurasata movement split in 1983, with the breakaway Misura group of [[Stedman Fagoth Muller]] allying itself more closely with the FDN, and the rest accommodating themselves with the Sandinistas: On 8 December 1984 a ceasefire agreement known as the Bogota Accord was signed by Misurasata and the Nicaraguan government.<ref>http://www.incore.ulst.ac.uk/services/cds/agreements/pdf/nic2.pdf</ref> A subsequent autonomy statute in September 1987 largely defused Miskito resistance.<ref>http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/docs/info-ngos/mrginicaragua39wg.pdf</ref>

===Unity efforts===
U.S. officials were active in attempting to unite the Contra groups. In June 1985 most of the groups reorganized as the [[United Nicaraguan Opposition]] (UNO), under the leadership of [[Adolfo Calero]], [[Arturo Cruz]] and [[Alfonso Robelo]], all originally supporters of the anti-Somoza revolution. After UNO's dissolution early in 1987, the [[Nicaraguan Resistance]] (RN) was organized along similar lines in May.

==U.S. military and financial assistance==

In front of the [[International Court of Justice]], Nicaragua claimed that the contras were altogether a creation of the U.S.<ref name="Gill 1989, p. 328">Gill 1989, p. 328</ref> This claim was rejected.<ref name="Gill 1989, p. 328"/> However, the evidence of a very close relationship between the contras and the United States was considered overwhelming and incontrovertible.<ref>Gill 1989, p. 329</ref> The U.S. played a very large role in financing, training, arming, and advising the contras over a long period, and the contras only became capable of carrying out significant military operations as a result of this support.<ref>"The United States has played a very large role in financing, training, arming, and advising the contras over a long period.

On 4 January 1982, Reagan signed the [[top secret]] National Security Decision Directive 17 (NSDD-17),<ref name="Fas.org"/> giving the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] the authority to recruit and support the contras with $19 million in military aid. The effort to support the contras was one component of the [[Reagan Doctrine]], which called for providing military support to movements opposing [[Soviet Union|Soviet-supported]], communist [[communist state|governments]].

By December 1981, however, the United States had already begun to support armed opponents of the Sandinista regime. From the beginning, the CIA was in charge.<ref>Lee et al. 1987, p.3</ref> The arming, clothing, feeding and supervision of the contras<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 3">Lee et al. 1987, p. 3</ref> became the most ambitious paramilitary and political action operation mounted by the agency in nearly a decade.<ref>"In December 1982, the ''New York Times'' reported intelligence officials as saying that Washington's ‘covert activities have... become the most ambitious paramilitary and political action operation mounted by the C.I.A. in nearly a decade...‘" As seen at: Lee et al. 1987, p. 33</ref> One of the purposes the CIA hoped to achieve by these operations was an aggressive and violent response from the Sandinista government which in turn could be used as a pretext for proper military actions.<ref>"The principal actions to be undertaken were paramilitary which hopefully would provoke cross-border attacks by Nicaraguan forces and thus serve to demonstrate Nicaragua's aggressive nature and possibly call into play the [[Organization of American States]]' provisions (regarding collective self-defense). It was hoped that the Nicaraguan Government would clamp down on civil liberties within Nicaragua itself, arresting its opposition, so demonstrating its allegedly inherent totalitarian nature and thus increase domestic dissent within the country, and further that there would be reaction against United States citizens, particularly against United States diplomatic personnel within Nicaragua and thus to demonstrate the hostility of Nicaragua towards the United States."

On 1 May 1985 President Reagan announced that his administration perceived Nicaragua to be "an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States", and declared a "national emergency" and a [[United States embargo against Nicaragua|trade embargo]] against Nicaragua to "deal with that threat".<ref>[http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12513.html "Executive Order 12513--Prohibiting trade and certain other transactions involving Nicaragua"] National Archives</ref> After the U.S. enforced the embargo, Nicaragua was isolated from the West, forcing the Sandinistas to rely more on Eastern bloc military and economic assistance even though Moscow declined to offer the quantity of aid it provided to close communist allies.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?ei=z1J9TJCBEIOB8gaM2NTqBg&ct=result&id=JN0ZAAAAMAAJ&dq=When+Nicaraguan+President+Daniel+Ortega+traveled+to+Moscow+after+the+US+trade+embargo%2C+the+Soviet+bloc+extended+%24202+million+in+economic+credits+and+trade+concessions.+While+Soviet+assistance+played+an+increasingly+vital+role+in+what+Ortega+called+Nicaragua%27s+%22economy+of+survival%2C%22+the+USSR+declined+to+offer+the+quantity+of+aid+it+provided+to+close+communist+allies&q=When+Nicaraguan+President+Daniel+Ortega+traveled+to+Moscow+after+the+US+trade+embargo%2C+the+Soviet+bloc+extended+%24202+million+in+economic+credits+and+trade+concessions.+While+Soviet+assistance+played+an+increasingly+vital+role+in+what+Ortega+called+Nicaragua%27s+%22economy+of+survival%2C%22+the+USSR+declined+to+offer+the+quantity+of+aid+it+provided+to+close+communist+allies.#search_anchor "Nicaragua, the price of intervention: Reagan's wars against the Sandinistas"] By Peter Kornbluh, 1987</ref>

According to the [[National Security Archive]], [[Oliver North]] had been in contact with [[Manuel Noriega]], the military leader of [[Panama]] later convicted on drug charges, whom he personally met. The issue of drug money and its importance in funding the Nicaraguan conflict was the subject of various reports and publications.

The Reagan administration's support for the Contras continued to stir controversy well into the 1990s.

On top of that, [[Oliver North]] helped Carl Channell's tax-exempt organization, the "National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty", to raise $10 million, by arranging numerous briefings for groups of potential contributors at the premises of the White House and by facilitating private visits and photo sessions with President Reagan for major contributors.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 6">Lee et al. 1987, p. 6</ref> Channell, in turn, used part of that money to run a series of television advertisements directed at home districts of [[congressman|Congressmen]] considered to be swing votes on contra aid.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 6"/> Out of the $10 million raised, more than $1 million was spent on pro-contra publicity.<ref name="Lee et al. 1987, p. 6"/>

===International Court of Justice ruling===
{{Main|Nicaragua v. United States}}
In 1984 the Sandinista government filed a suit in the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) against the United States (''Nicaragua v. United States''), which resulted in a 1986 judgment against the United States. The ICJ held that the U.S. had violated [[international law]] by supporting the contras in their rebellion against the Nicaraguan government and by [[Naval mine|mining]] Nicaragua's harbors. Regarding the alleged human rights violations by the contras, however, the ICJ took the view that the United States could only be held accountable for them if it would have been proven that the U.S. had effective control of the contra operations resulting in these alleged violations.<ref>"Having reached the above conclusion, the Court takes the view that the contras remain responsible for their acts, in particular the alleged violations by them of humanitarian law. For the United States to be legally responsible, it would have to be proved that that State had effective control of the operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed." As seen at: International Court of Justice 1986, VII (5)</ref> Nevertheless, the ICJ found that the U.S. encouraged acts contrary to general principles of humanitarian law by producing the manual ''[[Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare]] (Operaciones sicológicas en guerra de guerrillas'') and disseminating it to the contras.<ref>"...Finds that the United States of America, by producing in 1983 a manual entitled "Operaciones sicológicas en guerra de guerrillas", and disseminating it to contra forces, has encouraged the commission by them of acts contrary to general principles of humanitarian law." As seen at: International Court of Justice 1986, (9)</ref> The manual, amongst other things, advised on how to rationalize killings of civilians<ref name="ReferenceC">"In the case of shooting "a citizen who was trying to leave the town or city in which the guerrillas are carrying out armed propaganda or political proselytism", the manual suggests that the contras "explain that if that citizen had managed to escape, he would have alerted the enemy."

The United States, which did not participate in the merits phase of the proceedings, maintained that the ICJ's power did not supersede the [[Constitution of the United States]] and argued that the court did not seriously consider the Nicaraguan role in El Salvador, while it accused Nicaragua of actively supporting armed groups there, specifically in the form of supply of arms.<ref>International Court of Justice 1986, VIII (1)</ref> The ICJ had found that evidence of a responsibility of the Nicaraguan government in this matter was insufficient.<ref>"In any event the evidence is insufficient to satisfy the Court that the Government of Nicaragua was responsible for any flow of arms at either period." As seen at: International Court of Justice 1986, VIII (1)</ref> The U.S. argument was affirmed, however, by the dissenting opinion of ICJ member U.S. Judge Schwebel,<ref>"But the Court, remarkably enough, while finding the United States responsible for intervention in Nicaragua, failed to recognize Nicaragua's prior and continuing intervention in El Salvador." As seen at: International Court of Justice 1986, Dissenting Opinion of Judge Schwebel</ref> who concluded that in supporting the contras, the United States acted lawfully in collective self-defence in El Salvador's support.<ref>"...concluded that the United States essentially acted lawfully in exerting armed pressures against Nicaragua, both directly and through its support of the contras, because Nicaragua's prior and sustained support of armed insurgency in El Salvador was tantamount to an armed attack upon El Salvador against which the United States could react in collective self-defence in El Salvador's support."

They were killed by slitting their throats and pulling the tongue out through the slit."<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?ei=07iHT5y1KYaftwfHo7H1CQ&id=g6kwAQAAIAAJ&dq=Rosa+had+her+breasts+cut+off.+Then+they+cut+into+her+chest+and+took+out+her+heart.+The+men+had+their+arms+broken%2C+their+testicles+cut+off.+They+were+killed+by+slitting+their+throats+and+pulling+the+tongue+out+through+the+slit.&q=%22Rosa+had+her+breasts+cut+off.+Then+they+cut+into+her+chest+and+took+out+her+heart.+The+men+had+their+arms+broken%2C+their+testicles+cut+off.+They+were+killed+by+slitting+their+throats+and+pulling+the+tongue+out+through+the+slit.%22#search_anchor "The Contras' litany of destruction"] The Guardian</ref>

Human Rights Watch released a report on the situation in 1989, which stated: "[The] contras were major and systematic violators of the most basic standards of the laws of armed conflict, including by launching indiscriminate attacks on civilians, selectively murdering non-combatants, and mistreating prisoners."<ref name="NICARAGUA">[http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1989/WR89/Nicaragu.htm "NICARAGUA"] Human Rights Watch, 1989</ref>

Similarly, the [[Progressio (organization)|Catholic Institute for International Relations]] (CIIR, now known as "Progressio"), a human rights organization which identifies itself with [[liberation theology]], had summarized Contra operating procedures in their 1987 human rights report: "The record of the contras in the field, as opposed to their official professions of democratic faith, is one of consistent and bloody abuse of human rights, of murder, torture, mutilation, rape, arson, destruction and kidnapping."<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Av6GAAAAMAAJ&q=The+record+of+the+contras+in+the+field,+as+opposed+to+their+official+professions+of+democratic+faith,+is+one+of+consistent+and+bloody+abuse+of+human+rights,+of+murder,+torture,+mutilation,+rape,+arson,&dq=The+record+of+the+contras+in+the+field,+as+opposed+to+their+official+professions+of+democratic+faith,+is+one+of+consistent+and+bloody+abuse+of+human+rights,+of+murder,+torture,+mutilation,+rape,+arson,&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8rKHT9vrKJSE8AS68-3uCQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA "Right to survive: human rights in Nicaragua"] Catholic Institute for International Relations, 1987</ref> Earlier, in December 1984, the [[Council on Hemispheric Affairs]] had issued a report condemning the Contras and the United States government as being among the worst human rights violators in Latin America: "The CIA directed forces are among the worst human rights violators in Latin America, responsible for systematic brutality against a civilian population. For its critical role in facilitating the Contra violence, the [United States] Administration must share responsibility as a hemispheric violator of human rights.

===Human rights violations as a strategy===

[[Nicaragua v. United States#Third witness: Professor Michael Glennon|A fact finding mission of 1985]] – sponsored by the [[International Human Rights Law Group]] and the [[Washington Office on Latin America]], and carried out independently of any Nicaraguan government interference or direction - found that the contras with some frequency deliberately targeted Nicaraguan citizens in acts of terroristic violence.<ref>"We found that there is substantial credible evidence that the contras engaged with some frequency in acts of terroristic violence directed at Nicaraguan civilians... These are individuals who are not caught in the cross-fire between government and contra forces, but...deliberately targeted by the contras for acts of terror."

An influential report on Contra atrocities was issued by lawyer [[Reed Brody]] shortly before the 1985 U.S. Congressional vote on Contra aid. It disclosed a "distinct pattern" of abuses by the contras, including: "attacks on purely civilian targets resulting in the killing of unarmed men, woman, children and the elderly—premeditated acts of brutality including rapes, beatings, mutilations and torture—and individual and mass kidnappings of civilians for the purpose of forced recruitment into the Contra forces and the creation of a hostage refugee population in Honduras; – assaults on economic and social targets such as farms, cooperatives and on vehicles carrying volunteer coffee harvesters; – intimidation of civilians who participate or cooperate in government or community programs such as distribution of subsidized food products, education and local self-defense militias; – and kidnapping, intimidation, and even murder of religious leaders who support the government, including priests and clergy- trained lay pastors."<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=EjgG12L3uAEC&pg=PA21&dq=Those+incidents+that+have+been+investigated,+however,+reveal+a+distinct+pattern,+indicating+that+contra+activities+often+include:&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dbuHT9T6Lo6y8QS6num3CQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Those%20incidents%20that%20have%20been%20investigated%2C%20however%2C%20reveal%20a%20distinct%20pattern%2C%20indicating%20that%20contra%20activities%20often%20include%3A&f=false "Contra terror in Nicaragua: report of a fact-finding mission, September 1984 – January 1985"] By Reed Brody, 1985</ref>

Similarly, [[Human Rights Watch]] pointed out that "the Contras systematically engage in violent abuses...so prevalent that these may be said to be their principal means of waging war" in a 1989 report.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/1989/WR89/Nicaragu.htm |title=Nicaragua |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1989 |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref>

In his affidavit to the World Court, former contra Edgar Chamorro testified that "The CIA did not discourage such tactics. To the contrary, the Agency severely criticized me when I admitted to the press that the FDN had regularly kidnapped and executed agrarian reform workers and civilians. We were told that the only way to defeat the Sandinistas was to...kill, kidnap, rob and torture..."<ref>[http://www.williamgbecker.com/chamorroaffidavit.pdf "Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua V. United States of America): Affidavit of Edgar Chamarro"] International Court of Justice, 5 September 1985</ref>

These deliberate acts of violence against civilians were acknowledged by the CIA as early as late 1983, when [[Duane Clarridge]], Latin America division chief of the CIA’s Directorate for Operations, reported in a secret briefing to the Senate subcommittee that his contras had murdered "civilians and Sandinista officials in the provinces, as well as heads of cooperatives, nurses, doctors and judges". But that didn't contradict the presidential directive, Dewey said. "These events don’t constitute assassinations because as far as we are concerned assassinations are only those of heads of state. I leave definitions to the politicians. After all, this is a war—a paramilitary operation".<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?ei=iZX_T_e0H4-i8AShpvCVCA&id=P1cMAAAAYAAJ&dq=Dewey+said+at+a+secret+briefing+in+%22Tate+1983+that+%22civilians+and+Sandinista+officials+in+the+provinces%2C+as+well+as+heads+of+cooperatives%2C+nurses%2C+doctors+and+judges%22+had+been+killed+by+his+rebels.+But+that+didn%27t+contradict+the+presidential+directive%2C&q=Dewey+said+at+a+secret+briefing+in+%22Tate+1983+that+%22civilians+and+Sandinista+officials+in+the+provinces%2C+as+well+as+heads+of+cooperatives%2C+nurses%2C+doctors+and+judges%22+had+been+killed+by+his+rebels.+But+that+didn%27t+contradict+the+presidential+directive%2C+Dewey+said.+%22These+events+don%27t+constitute+assassinations+because+as+far+as+we+are+concerned+assassinations+are+only+those+of+heads+of+state%2C%22+Dewey+reportedly+told+the+committees.+%22I+leave+definitions+to+the+politicians%2C%22+he+said.+ "With the Contras: a reporter in the wilds of Nicaragua"] By Christopher Dickey, 1987</ref>

Furthermore, the contras attacked and sabotaged economic and social targets such as lumber yards, coffee processing plants, electrical generating stations, farms, cooperatives, food storage facilities, health centers, including a particular effort to dusrupt the coffee harvests through attacks on coffee cooperatives and on vehicles carrying volunteer coffee harvesters. They also attacked and intimidated civilians deemed to be contributors to the country's economy such as telephone workers, coffee pickers, teachers, and technicians as well as civilians who participated or cooperated in government or community programs such as distribution of subsidized food products, rural cooperatives, and education.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=MGgWWT9fWYQC&pg=PA32&dq=The+Contras+have+killed,+tortured,+raped,+mutilated+and+abducted+hundreds+of+civillians+they+suspect+of+sympathizing+with+the+Sandinistas.+Victims+have+included+peasants,+teachers,+doctors+and+agricultural+workers&hl=en&ei=hihOTMqkLIHKONCUtKkP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false "Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua V.

The CIA manual, [[s:Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare|"Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare"]] (''Operaciones sicológicas en guerra de guerrillas''), had been written in 1983 to be used by the contras.<ref name="books.google.com">[http://books.google.com/books?id=dA0PAAAAYAAJ&q=The+United+States+has+aided+and+abetted+the+contras+in+committing+abuses+by+organizing,+training,+supplying+and+financing+them,+and+by+serving+as+their+vigorous+and+enthusiastic+public+relations+advocate.+In+addition,+by+publishing+and+distributing+the+CIA%E2%80%99s+Manual+the+United+States+has+directly+solicited+the+contras+to+engage+in+violations+of+the+laws+of+war.&dq=The+United+States+has+aided+and+abetted+the+contras+in+committing+abuses+by+organizing,+training,+supplying+and+financing+them,+and+by+serving+as+their+vigorous+and+enthusiastic+public+relations+advocate.+In+addition,+by+publishing+and+distributing+the+CIA%E2%80%99s+Manual+the+United+States+has+directly+solicited+the+contras+to+engage+in+violations+of+the+laws+of+war.&hl=en&sa=X&ei=upiHT7uRIYq28AG3xcC1CA&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw "Violations of the laws of war by both sides in Nicaragua, 1981–1985"] Americas Watch Committee, 1985</ref> The manual talks about killing civilians who try to leave an occupied town and to rationalize their killing,<ref name="ReferenceC"/> hiring professional assassins,<ref name="Sklar 1988, p. 181"/> blackmailing citizens into working for the contras, and inciting violence during demonstrations.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Fq8OAAAAYAAJ&q=The+manual+talks+of+%E2%80%9Cneutralizing%E2%80%9D+Sandinista+officials+and+creating+martyrs.+This+raises+the+question+of+whether+Executive+Order+12333,+which+prohibits+assassinations,+was+violated.+The+manual+also+talks+of+shooting+civilians+trying+to+leave+a+captured+town,+blackmailing+others+to+work+for+the+contras,+and+endangering+innocent+people+by+inciting+violence+in+mass+demonstrations.&dq=The+manual+talks+of+%E2%80%9Cneutralizing%E2%80%9D+Sandinista+officials+and+creating+martyrs.+This+raises+the+question+of+whether+Executive+Order+12333,+which+prohibits+assassinations,+was+violated.+The+manual+also+talks+of+shooting+civilians+trying+to+leave+a+captured+town,+blackmailing+others+to+work+for+the+contras,+and+endangering+innocent+people+by+inciting+violence+in+mass+demonstrations.&hl=en&sa=X&ei=G42HT9m1O5Gr0AGyl5TFCA&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA "Nicaragua: the human rights record"] Amnesty International, 1986</ref>

The International Court of Justice ruled on 27 June 1986 that by disseminating the manual to the contras, the United States of America had "encouraged ... acts contrary to general principles of humanitarian law."<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=iwnwAAAAMAAJ&q=The+United+States+of+America,+by+producing+in+1983+a+manual+entitled+%27Operaciones+sicol%C3%B3gicas+en+guerra+de+guerrillas%27,+and+disseminating+it+to+contra+forces,+has+encouraged+the+commission+by+them+of+acts+contrary+to+general+principles+of+humanitarian+law.&dq=The+United+States+of+America,+by+producing+in+1983+a+manual+entitled+%27Operaciones+sicol%C3%B3gicas+en+guerra+de+guerrillas%27,+and+disseminating+it+to+contra+forces,+has+encouraged+the+commission+by+them+of+acts+contrary+to+general+principles+of+humanitarian+law.&hl=en&sa=X&ei=W0-IT_e1FaL40gHQsuHXCQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAzgK "Yearbook , Issue 40"] International Court of Justice, 1 January 1985</ref> Americas Watch had come to a similar conclusion in 1985.<ref name="books.google.com"/>

===U.S. justification===
{{Further|Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration#Nicaragua}}
''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' editor [[Michael Kinsley]] argued that critics should not simply dismiss State Department justifications for contra attacks on "soft targets": "The State Department has defended bloody contra attacks on government-sponsored farm cooperatives, saying that these civilian facilities have military aspects. And, of course, that's true. In a Marxist society geared up for war, there are no clear lines separating officials, soldiers and civilians. A guerrilla struggle can't be won by attacking only card-carrying Sandinistas. The goal is to undermine morale and confidence in the government: a perfectly legitimate goal if you believe in the cause, but impossible to achieve without vast civilian suffering. Any sensible policy must meet the test of cost-benefit analysis. The amount of blood and misery that will be poured in, and the likelihood that democracy will emerge at the other end."<ref>Michael Kinsley, ''Wall Street Journal'', 26 March 1987.</ref>

In line with this, contra leader [[Adolfo Calero]] denied that his forces deliberately targeted civilians:  "What they call a cooperative is also a troop concentration full of armed people. We are not killing civilians. We are fighting armed people and returning fire when fire is directed at us."<ref>''New York Times'', 23 November 1984.</ref>

===Controversy===
U.S. news media published several articles accusing Americas Watch and other bodies of ideological bias and unreliable reporting. It alleged that Americas Watch gave too much credence to alleged Contra abuses and systematically tried to discredit Nicaraguan human rights groups such as the [[Permanent Commission on Human Rights]], which blamed the major human rights abuses on the Sandinistas.<ref>''[[The New Republic]]'', 20 January 1986; ''[[The New Republic]]'', 22 August 1988; ''[[The National Interest]]'', Spring 1990.</ref>

In 1985, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported:
:Three weeks ago, Americas Watch issued a report on human rights abuses in Nicaragua. One member of the Permanent Commission for Human Rights commented on the Americas Watch report and its chief investigator [[Juan E. Méndez|Juan Mendez]]: "The Sandinistas are laying the groundwork for a totalitarian society here and yet all Mendez wanted to hear about were abuses by the contras. How can we get people in the U.S. to see what's happening here when so many of the groups who come down are pro-Sandinista?"<ref>David Asman, "Despair and fear in Managua", ''[[Wall Street Journal]],'' 25 March 1985.</ref>

[[Human Rights Watch]], the umbrella organization of Americas Watch, replied to these allegations: "Almost invariably, U.S. pronouncements on human rights exaggerated and distorted the real human rights violations of the Sandinista regime, and exculpated those of the U.S.-supported insurgents, known as the contras...The Bush administration is responsible for these abuses, not only because the contras are, for all practical purposes, a U.S. force, but also because the Bush administration has continued to minimize and deny these violations, and has refused to investigate them seriously."<ref name="NICARAGUA"/>

U.S. political scientist [[Rudolph Rummel]] estimated that by 1987, the contras had murdered about 500 people while the Sandinistas had murdered 4,000 to 7,000 people in [[democide]].<ref>[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.TAB15.1E.GIF Power Kills] Hawaii.edu. Line 2558</ref> In contrast, [[Witness for Peace]] and the Sandinista government claimed at least 736 civilians were murdered by the contras between March 1987 and October 1988 alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianwillson.com/u-s-waged-low-intensity-warfare-in-nicaragua|title=ADDENDUM A: Casualties from Contra Attacks–Nicaragua|accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref>

After a cutoff in U.S. military support and with both sides facing international pressure to bring an end to the conflict, the contras agreed to negotiations with the FSLN. With the help of five Central American Presidents, including Ortega, it was agreed that a voluntary demobilization of the contras should start in early December 1989, in order to facilitate free and fair elections in Nicaragua in February 1990 (even though the Reagan administration had pushed for a delay of contra disbandment).<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73891981.html?dids=73891981:73891981&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+09%2C+1989&author=John+M.+Goshko%3B+Ann+Devroy&pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=U.S.+Endorses+Contra+Plan+as+Prod+to+Democracy+in+Nicaragua&pqatl=google "U.S. Endorses Contra Plan as Prod to Democracy in Nicaragua"] The Washington Post, 9 August 1989</ref>

In the resulting February 1990 elections, [[Violeta Chamorro]] and her party the [[National Opposition Union|UNO]] won an upset victory of 55% to 41% over Daniel Ortega,<ref>{{cite news

Possible explanations include that the Nicaraguan people were disenchanted with the Ortega regime as well as the fact that already in November 1989, the White House had announced that the economic embargo against Nicaragua would continue unless Violeta Chamorro won.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1222025.html "Bush Vows to End Embargo if Chamorro Wins"], ''The Washington Post,'' 9 November 1989</ref> Also, there had been reports of intimidation from the side of the contras,<ref>"The policy of keeping the contras alive ... also has placed in jeopardy the holding of elections by encouraging contra attacks on the electoral process. Thus, while the Bush administration proclaims its support for human rights and free and fair elections in Nicaragua, it persists in sabotaging both."

Both by critics and supporters of the Reagan administration, this was seen as a direct result of the administration's efforts concerning the contras.<ref>"It is true that partly because of the confrontation with the U.S., Nicaragua's economy suffered terribly, setting the stage for the widespread public discontent with the Sandinistas reflected in Sunday's balloting. But few governments become moderate during a war; the contra war strengthened Sandinista hard-liners and probably contributed to their oppressive policies. The way to resolution opened only when Congress suspended the war, in effect, to give the Sandinistas a chance to proceed democratically...Thus, Nicaragua's election has vindicated Washington's fledgling program of providing public, above-board funding to help democratic procedures take root in countries with authoritarian regimes."

Since 1985 Washington has strangled Nicaraguan trade with an embargo. It has cut off Nicaragua's credit at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The contra war cost Managua tens of millions and left the country with wrecked bridges, sabotaged power stations and ruined farms. The impoverishment of the people of Nicaragua was a harrowing way to give the National Opposition Union (U.N.O.) a winning issue. Nicaragua had been devastated by a 40% drop in GNP, an inflation rate running at 1,700% a year and constant shortages of food and basic necessities. At least 30,000 people had been killed in the war, and 500,000 more had fled."
