'''Bjørn Lomborg''' ({{IPA-da|bjɶɐ̯n ˈlʌmbɒˀw|lang}}; born 6 January 1965) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] author, academic, and writer. He is an [[adjunct professor]] at the [[Copenhagen Business School]], director of the [[Copenhagen Consensus]] Centre and a former director of the [[Environmental Assessment Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]]. He became internationally known for his best-selling and controversial book ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'' (2001).

In 2002, Lomborg and the [[Environmental Assessment Institute]] founded the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], which seeks to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methodologies based on the theory of [[welfare economics]].

Lomborg campaigned against the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and other measures to cut carbon emissions in the short-term, and argued for adaptation to short-term temperature rises as they are inevitable, and for spending money on research and development for longer-term environmental solutions, and on other important world problems such as AIDS, malaria and malnutrition. In his critique of the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]], Lomborg stated: "Global warming is by no means our main environmental threat." <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/wrongheaded-in-rio | title=Wrongheaded in Rio|year=2012 |work=[[Project Syndicate]] | first1=Bjørn | last1=Lomborg}}</ref>

In the chapter on climate change in his 2001 book ''A Skeptical Environmentalist'' he states; "This chapter accepts the reality of man-made global warming but questions the way in which future scenarios have been arrived at and finds that forecasts of climate change of 6 degrees by the end of the century are not plausible".{{sfn|Lomborg|2001|p=259}} [[Cost–benefit analyses]], calculated by the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], ranked climate mitigation initiatives low on a list of international development initiatives when first done in 2004.<ref>[http://lomborg.com/faq/?PHPSESSID=672dae7b19de522714a471db5235cf3c claims]</ref>{{vs|date=July 2013}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}} In a 2010 interview with the ''[[New Statesman]]'', Lomborg summarized his position on climate change: "Global warming is real – it is man-made and it is an important problem. But it is not the end of the world."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Elmhirst|first=Sophie|date=2010-09-24|title=The NS Interview: Bjørn Lomborg|journal=New Statesman|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/environment/2010/09/interview-gay-climate}}</ref>

== Academic career ==
Lomborg spent a year as an undergraduate at the [[University of Georgia]], earned an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] degree in [[political science]] at the [[University of Aarhus]] in 1991, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in political science at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1994.

He lectured in [[statistics]] in the Department of Political Science at the University of Aarhus as an [[assistant professor]] (1994&ndash;1996) and [[associate professor]] (1997&ndash;2005).  He left the university in February 2005 and in May of that year became an [[Professors in the United States#Adjunct professor|Adjunct Professor]] at [[Copenhagen Business School]].

Early in his career his professional areas of interest lay in the simulation of strategies in [[collective action]] [[Ethical dilemma|dilemmas]], simulation of [[political party|party]] behavior in [[Party-list proportional representation|proportional voting systems]], and the use of surveys in [[public administration]].  In 1996, Lomborg's paper, "Nucleus and Shield: Evolution of [[Social structure|Social Structure]] in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma", was published in the [[academic journal]], ''[[American Sociological Review]]''.<ref name=1996Nucleus>{{Cite journal

Later Lomborg's interests shifted to the use of statistics in the [[Environmental movement|environmental arena]].  His most famous book in this area is ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', whose English translation was published as a work in [[environmental economics]] by Cambridge University Press in 2001. He later edited ''Global Crises, Global Solutions'', which presented the first conclusions of the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], published in 2004 by the Cambridge University Press. In 2007, he authored a book entitled ''Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming.''

== ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' ==
:''Main article:'' ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]''

In 1998, Lomborg published four [[essay]]s about the state of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in the leading Danish newspaper ''[[Politiken]]'', which according to him "resulted in a firestorm debate spanning over 400 articles in major metropolitan newspapers."<ref>[http://www.lomborg.com/about/biography/ Bjørn Lomborg Biography], www.lomborg.com. Retrieved 26 February 2006.</ref> <!-- Why are these essays mentioned? Were they a trial run or short version of THE BOOK THIS SECTION IS ABOUT? -->

In 2001, he attained significant attention by publishing ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', a controversial book whose main thesis is that many of the most-publicized claims and predictions on environmental issues are wrong.

=== Accusations of scientific dishonesty ===
After the publication of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', Lomborg was accused of scientific dishonesty. Several environmental scientists brought a total of three complaints against Lomborg to the [[Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty]] (DCSD), a body under Denmark's [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Denmark|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]]. The charges claimed that ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' contained deliberately misleading data and flawed conclusions. Due to the similarity of the complaints, the DCSD decided to proceed on the three cases under one investigation.

==== DCSD investigation ====
On 6 January 2003 the DCSD reached a decision on the complaints. The ruling sent a mixed message, deciding the book to be scientifically dishonest, but Lomborg himself not guilty because of lack of expertise in the fields in question:<ref>[http://fivu.dk/en/publications/2004/annual-report-2003-the-danish-committees-on-scientific-dishonesty The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty: 2003 Annual Report]. Retrieved 13 February 2008.</ref>

: ''Objectively speaking, the publication of the work under consideration is deemed to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty. ...In view of the subjective requirements made in terms of intent or gross negligence, however, Bjørn Lomborg's publication cannot fall within the bounds of this characterization. Conversely, the publication is deemed clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice.''

The DCSD cited ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' for:

#Fabrication of data;
#Selective discarding of unwanted results (selective citation);
#Deliberately [[systemic bias|misleading use of statistical methods]];
#Distorted interpretation of conclusions;
#[[Plagiarism]];
#Deliberate misinterpretation of others' results.

==== MSTI review ====
On 13 February 2003, Lomborg filed a complaint against the DCSD's decision, with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MSTI), which has oversight over the DCSD.  On 17 December 2003, the Ministry annulled the decision made by DCSD. In doing so, MSTI cited several procedural errors, including:
* The DCSD did not provide specific statements on actual errors. On this point the MSTI stated "the DCSD has not documented where [Dr. Lomborg] has allegedly been biased in his choice of data and in his argumentation, and&nbsp;... the ruling is completely void of argumentation for why the DCSD find that the complainants are right in their criticisms of [his] working methods. It is not sufficient that the criticisms of a researcher's working methods exist; the DCSD must consider the criticisms and take a position on whether or not the criticisms are justified, and why."<ref>{{Cite web

* The DCSD did not use a precise standard for deciding "good scientific practice" in the [[social sciences]];
* The DCSD's definition of "objective scientific dishonesty" was not clear about whether "distortion of statistical data" had to be deliberate or not;
* The DCSD had not properly documented that ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' was a scientific publication on which they had the right to intervene in the first place;

The Ministry remitted the case to the DCSD. In doing so the Ministry indicated that it regarded the DCSD's previous findings of scientific dishonesty in regard to the book as invalid.<ref name=forskdk>{{Cite web

On 12 March 2004, the Committee formally decided not to act further on the complaints, reasoning that renewed scrutiny would, in all likelihood, result in the same conclusion.<ref name=forskdk />

==== Response of the scientific community ====
The original DCSD decision about Lomborg provoked a [[petition]]<ref>[http://www.math.ku.dk/~dlando/indsamling.htm "Underskriftsindsamling i protest mod afgørelsen om Bjørn Lomborg fra - Udvalgene Vedrørende Videnskabelig Uredelighed"].

=== The top 50 sustainability books ===
The alumni network of the [[Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership]] (CPSL) voted ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' among its list of the top 50 sustainability books.<ref>{{Cite book|last1= Visser |first1= Wayne |title=The Top 50 Sustainability Books |year= 2009 |publisher= Greenleaf Publishing |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-1-906093-32-7|pages=256 }}</ref>

== Continued debate and criticism ==
The rulings of the Danish authorities in 2003-2004 left Lomborg's critics frustrated. Lomborg claimed vindication as a result of MSTI's decision to set aside the original finding of DCSD.

''The Lomborg Deception'', a book by [[Howard Friel]], claims to offer a "careful analysis" of the ways in which Lomborg has "selectively used (and sometimes distorted) the available evidence".<ref name=pk>

|accessdate=13 October 2013 }}</ref>

A Dutch [[think tank]], HAN, [[Heidelberg Appeal|Heidelberg Appeal the Netherlands]], published a report in which they claimed 25 out of 27 accusations against Lomborg to be unsubstantiated or not to the point.<ref>Rörsch, Arthur, et al. [http://www.stichting-han.nl/Commentaren/algemeen/2.critical%20concideration1.doc "A Critical Consideration of the Verdict of the Danish Committee on Scientific Dishonesty on the Book by Bjorn Lomborg 'The Skeptical Environmentalist'"]. Heidelberg Appeal the Netherlands, 4-April-2003. Retrieved 26 February 2006.</ref>
A group of scientists with relation to this think tank also published an article in 2005 in the ''[[Journal of Information Ethics]]'',<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Rörsch, A. et al. |title=On the opposition against the book The Skeptical Environmentalist by B. Lomborg |journal=Journal of Information Ethics |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=16–28 |year=2005 |month=Spring |doi=10.3172/JIE.14.1.16}}</ref> in which they concluded that most criticism against Lomborg was unjustified, and that the scientific community misused their authority to suppress Lomborg.

=== Kåre Fog ===
The claim that the accusations against Lomborg were unjustified was challenged in the next issue of ''Journal of Information Ethics''<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Fog, K. |title=The real nature of the opposition against B. Lomborg |journal=Journal of Information Ethics |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=66–76 |year=2005 |month=Fall |doi=10.3172/JIE.14.2.66}}</ref> by Kåre Fog, one of the original plaintiffs. Fog reasserted his contention that, despite the ministry's decision, most of the accusations against Lomborg were valid. He also rejected what he called "the [[Galileo affair|Galileo]] hypothesis", which he describes as the conception that Lomborg is just a brave young man confronting old-fashioned opposition.

Kåre Fog has established a catalogue of criticisms against Lomborg on the ''Lomborg-errors'' website, established in 2004.<ref>{{cite web

In each section, Fog lists and details what he believes to be flaws and errors in Lomborg's work. Fog explicitly indicates if there are any details which he believes support the interpretation that the particular error may have been made deliberately by Lomborg, in order to mislead. Although Lomborg previously has defended himself against the critique raised by a group of opponents in 1999 and 2002, especially in the web-book "Godhedens Pris".,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lomborg.com/dyn/files/basic_items/102-file/Reply_to_Skeptical_Questions.pdf|title=Short reply to Skeptical Questions, Sustainable Answers|last=Lomborg|first=Bjørn|date=2002-06-27|work=lomborg.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web

== Further career ==

=== Government work ===
In March 2002, the newly elected [[Centre-right|center-right]] [[prime minister]], [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], appointed Lomborg to run Denmark's new [[Environmental Assessment Institute]] (EAI). On 22 June 2004, Lomborg announced his decision to resign from this post to go back to the University of Aarhus, saying his work at the Institute was done and that he could better serve the public debate from the academic sector.

In 2002, Lomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], which seeks to establish priorities for advancing [[world|global]] welfare using methodologies based on the theory of [[welfare economics]]. A panel of prominent [[economics|economists]] was assembled to evaluate and rank a series of problems every four years. The project was funded largely by the Danish government, and co-sponsored by ''[[The Economist]]''. A book summarizing the conclusions of the economists' first assessment, ''[[Global Crises, Global Solutions]]'', edited by Lomborg, was published in October 2004 by [[Cambridge University Press]].

=== Further books ===
''Solutions for the World's Biggest Problems'', published in 2007, offers an "...&nbsp;overview of twenty-three of the world's biggest problems relating to the environment, governance, economics, and health and population. Leading economists provide a short survey of the state-of-the-art analysis and sketch out some policy solutions for which they provide cost-benefit ratios."<ref>{{citation|title=Solutions for the World's Biggest Problems: costs and benefits|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-521-71597-3|oclc=165408072}}</ref>

''[[Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming]]'', also published in 2007, argues against taking immediate and "drastic" action to curb greenhouse gases while simultaneously stating that "Global warming is happening. It's a serious and important problem&nbsp;...". He argues that "...&nbsp;the cost and benefits of the proposed measures against global warming. ...&nbsp;is the worst way to spend our money. Climate change is a 100-year problem&nbsp;&mdash; we should not try to fix it in 10 years."<ref>{{citation|title=Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming|publisher=Cyan and Marshall Cavendish|year=2007|isbn=978-0-462-09912-5|oclc=271251227}}</ref>

[[Howard Friel]] wrote a book entitled ''The Lomborg Deception'', which criticizes Lomborg, claiming that the sources Lomborg provides in the footnotes do not support—and in some cases are in direct contradiction to—Lomborg's assertions in the text of the book;<ref>{{cite web

== Recognitions and awards ==
In November 2001, Lomborg was selected "Global Leader for Tomorrow" by the [[World Economic Forum]].
In June 2002, ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' named Lomborg one of the "50 Stars of Europe" (17 June), in the category of Agenda Setters.

== Discussions in the media ==
After the release of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' in 2001, Lomborg was subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism in the [[News media|media]], where his scientific qualifications and integrity were both attacked and defended. The verdict of the Danish Committees for Scientific Dishonesty fueled this debate and brought it into the spotlight of international [[mass media]]. By the end of 2003 Lomborg had become an international celebrity, with frequent appearances on radio, television and [[Publishing|print media]] around the world.
* ''[[Scientific American]]'' published strong criticism of Lomborg's book. Lomborg responded on his own [[website]], quoting the article at such length that ''Scientific American'' threatened to sue for [[copyright infringement]]. Lomborg eventually removed the rebuttal from his website; it was later published in [[PDF]] format on ''Scientific American'''s site.<ref>[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00000B96-9517-1CDA-B4A8809EC588EEDF "Bjørn Lomborg’s comments to the 11-page critique in January 2002 Scientific American (SA)"].

* ''[[The Economist]]'' defended Lomborg, claiming the panel of experts that had criticised Lomborg in ''Scientific American'' was both biased and did not actually counter Lomborg's book. ''The Economist'' argued that the panel's opinion had come under no scrutiny at all, and that Lomborg's responses had not been reported.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=1522706 "Thought control"].

* ''[[Penn & Teller: Bullshit!]]''&nbsp;&mdash; the U.S. [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] television programme featured an episode entitled "Environmental Hysteria" in which Lomborg criticised what he claimed was environmentalists' refusal to accept a [[cost-benefit analysis]] of environmental questions, and stressed the need to prioritise some issues above others.<ref>[http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/topics.do?topic=eh ''Bullshit'', "Environmental Hysteria"].

Cambridge University Press. Retrieved 26 February 2006.</ref>
* The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] strongly criticised ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', claiming it to be "seriously flawed and failing to meet basic standards of credible scientific analysis", accusing Lomborg of presenting data in a fraudulent way, using flawed logic and selectively citing non-peer-reviewed literature.<ref name="UCS">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/global_warming_contrarians/ucs-examines-the-skeptical.html|title=UCS Examines 'The Skeptical Environmentalist' |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=11 February 2010}}</ref> The review was conducted by [[Peter Gleick]], [[Jerry D.
