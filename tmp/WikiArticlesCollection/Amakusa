'''Amakusa''' (天草), which means "Heaven's Grass," is a series of islands belonging to [[Japan]], off the west coast of [[Kyushu]], the southernmost of the four main islands of Japan. The largest island of the Amakusa group is Shimoshima, which is 26.5 miles long and 13.5 miles in extreme width ({{convert|26.5|x|13.5|mi|km|disp=out|1}}). It is situated at 32°20'N, 130°E, separated from the rest of  [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] by the [[Yatsushiro Sea]].

It has no high mountains, but its surface is very hilly—four of the peaks rise to a height of over {{convert|1500|ft|m}}.  The population resorts to the [[terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] system of [[Tillage|cultivation]] to cope with the lack of flat arable land.

Amakusa, along with the neighboring Shimabara Peninsula, became the site of a [[Shimabara rebellion|Christian rebellion]] in the 17th century.  Following the rebellion, those [[Kakure Kirishitan|Christians who survived]] continued to practice their faith in secret, despite persecution.

Amakusa produces a little [[coal]] and fine [[kaolin]], which was used in former times largely by the [[pottery|potters]] of [[Hirado]] and [[Satsuma Province]].  Many kilns remain on the islands today, and pottery is still an export.   Hidenoshin Koyama, who built [[Thomas Blake Glover]]'s House in [[Glover Garden]], came from this island.

At present, the islands are organized as [[Amakusa District, Kumamoto|Amakusa District]], [[Amakusa, Kumamoto|Amakusa City]], and [[Kami-Amakusa, Kumamoto|Kami-amakusa City]], all of which are under the administration of [[Kumamoto Prefecture]].

The islands are served by [[Amakusa Airfield]], located on the north end of Shimoshima.  The islands are connected to the mainland by the [[Five Bridges of Amakusa]] and by ferry from [[Hondo, Kumamoto|Hondo]] and [[Matsushima, Kumamoto|Matsushima]].

There are also [[ferry|ferries]] between the islands and the neighboring prefectures of [[Kagoshima Prefecture]] and [[Nagasaki Prefecture]].  The ferry from Oniike on the north Shimoshima to [[Kuchinotsu, Nagasaki|Kuchinotsu]], at the southern tip of the [[Shimabara Peninsula]], is run by the [[Shimabara Railway]] and operates hourly each day.<ref>
