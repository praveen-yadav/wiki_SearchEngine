'''Amblygonite''' is a fluorophosphate mineral, (Li,Na)AlPO<sub>4</sub>(F,OH), composed of [[lithium]], [[sodium]], [[aluminium]], [[phosphate]], [[fluoride]] and [[hydroxide]]. The mineral occurs in [[pegmatite]] deposits and is easily mistaken for [[albite]] and other [[feldspar]]s. Its density, cleavage and flame test for lithium are diagnostic. Amblygonite forms a series with ''montebrasite'', the low fluorine endmember. Geologic occurrence is in [[granite]] pegmatites, high-temperature [[tin]] veins, and [[greisen]]s. Amblygonite occurs with [[spodumene]], [[apatite]], [[lepidolite]], [[tourmaline]], and other lithium-bearing minerals in pegmatite veins.  It contains about 10% lithium, and has been utilized as a source of lithium. The chief commercial sources have historically been the deposits of California and France.

==History==
The mineral was first discovered in [[Saxony]] by [[August Breithaupt]] in 1817, and named by him from the Greek ''amblus'', blunt, and ''gouia'', angle, because of the obtuse angle between the cleavages. Later it was found at Montebras, Creuse, [[France]], and at Hebron in [[Maine]]; and because of slight differences in optical character and chemical composition the names montebrasite and hebronite have been applied to the mineral from these localities.  It has been discovered in considerable quantity at Pala in San Diego county, [[California]];  Caceres, [[Spain]]; and the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]]. The largest documented single crystal of amblygonite measured 7.62x2.44x1.83 m<sup>3</sup> and weighed ~102 tons.<ref>{{cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| pages = 885â€“907| year= 1981| title= The largest crystals| author = P.

==Gemology==
Transparent amblygonite has been faceted and used as a gemstone. As a gemstone set into jewelry it is vulnerable to breakage and abrasion from general wear, as its hardness and toughness are poor.<ref name="GRG"/> The main sources for gem material are [[Brazil]] and the [[U.S.]]. [[Australia]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Namibia]], [[Norway]], and [[Spain]] have also produced gem quality amblygonite.<ref name="GRG"/>
