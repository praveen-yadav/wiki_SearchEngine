'''Aarhus''' or '''Århus''' ({{IPA-da|ˈɒːhuːˀs|-|Århus.ogg}}) is the second-largest city in [[Denmark]]. The principal [[port]] of [[Denmark]], Aarhus is on the east side of the peninsula of [[Jutland]] in the geographical centre of Denmark. Aarhus is the seat of the council of [[Aarhus municipality]] with 323,644<ref name="dst.dk"/> inhabitants and 256,018 (1 January 2013)<ref name="BEF44"/> in the inner urban area.
According to Aarhus municipality, the "Greater Aarhus" area has a population of about 1.25&nbsp;million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/da/omkommunen/english.aspx |title=English: Aarhus Kommune |publisher=Aarhus.dk |date=2012-09-17 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.information.dk/309427|title=Information.dk: En stor by holder stor fest i storbyen – kan det blive større?, 2012|publisher=Information.dk|archivedate=29 August 2012|archiveurl=http://www.information.dk/309427}}</ref><ref>http://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Subsites/Aarhus-Wind-Energy/Dokumenter/Working-and-living.ashx</ref><ref>[http://www.businessaarhus.dk/~/media/Subsites/Business-Aarhus/Powerpoint-praesentationer/Aarhus-som-vkstby-english-new.ashx ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>  The city claims the unofficial title "Capital of Jutland".<ref name=CVDE>Bridgwater, W. & Beatrice Aldrich.

Aarhus is the main and biggest city in the [[East Jutland metropolitan area]] ({{lang-da|Byregion Østjylland}}), which is a co-operation in eastern [[Jutland]] with 17 municipalities.<ref name="Vis">[http://www.blst.dk/NR/rdonlyres/D57AF934-C471-41E6-A8B0-389AF80A94A6/0/Visionsoplaeg20082008.pdf "Vision Østjylland"], Miljøministeriet, 20. august 2008 {{dk icon}}</ref> With more than 1.2&nbsp;million people living in the East Jutland metropolitan area it represents approximately 23% of the population of Denmark.

==Name==
[[File:AarhusDomkirke.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Aarhus Cathedral]]; rebuilt to its current size in 1500, with the longest [[nave]] in Denmark]]
The city was mentioned for the first time by [[Adam of Bremen]] who stated that "Reginbrand, bishop of the church of Aarhus (Harusa)" participated in a church meeting in the city of [[Ingelheim]] in [[Germany]].<ref>''Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae'' 2.4.</ref>

During the [[Middle Ages]] the city was called ''Arus'', and in Icelandic chronicles, it was known as ''Áróss''. It is a compound of the two words ''ār'', genitive of ''ā'' ("river", Modern Danish ''å'') and ''ōss'' ("mouth", Modern Danish ''munding''; in Modern Icelandic this word is still used for "river delta").{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The name originates from the city's location around the mouth of the stream ''Aarhus Å'' (English: [[Aarhus River]]<ref name="The Aarhus River">VisitAarhus (2011). [http://www.visitaarhus.com/international/en-gb/menu/turist/om-aarhus/the_history_of_the_city/aarhusaa/aarhusaa.htm The Aarhus River]</ref>),<ref>VisitAarhus (2011). [http://www.visitaarhus.com/international/en-gb/menu/turist/om-aarhus/the_history_of_the_city/history_of_the_city.htm History of the city]</ref> ''Å'' being the Danish word for a small river.<ref>Wiktionary (2011). [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%A5#Noun å: Noun]</ref>

Through regular sound development, Medieval Danish ''Arus'' became ''Aars'' or ''Oes'', a form which persisted in the dialects of the surrounding parishes until the 20th century. In 1406, ''Aarhus'' became prevalent in the written sources, and gradually became the norm in the 17th century. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}}
Today, the city is also called "The City of Smiles" among people in Denmark.

===Aarhus/Århus spelling===
With the [[Å#Origin|Danish spelling reform of 1948]] ''Aa'' was changed to ''Å''. Some Danish cities resisted the new spelling of their names, notably [[Aalborg]] and [[Aabenraa]]. Contrarily, Århus city council explicitly embraced the new spelling, thought to enhance an image of progressiveness.

In 2010, a majority of the city council voted for a name change from ''Århus'' back to ''Aarhus'', and the renaming came into effect on January 1, 2011.<ref>jp.dk (2010). [http://jp.dk/aarhus/politik/article2226754.ece Århus skifter navn]</ref><ref>Politiken.dk (2010) [http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE1094748/aarhus-skifter-navn/ Århus skifter navn]</ref><ref>Børsen (2010) [http://borsen.dk/nyheder/politik/artikel/1/194315/aarhus_skifter_navn.html Århus skifter navn]</ref> Mayor at that time [[Nicolai Wammen]] argued that the ''Aa'' spelling would strengthen the city's international profile, help private enterprise and make it easier to access Aarhus on the Internet.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/48499-arhus-mayor-prefers-aarhus.html|title=Århus mayor prefers Aarhus|date=2010-03-15|newspaper=Copenhagen Post}}</ref> The ''Aarhus'' spelling has, however, always had some use in non-Scandinavian languages. There is considerable opposition to the ''Aa'' spelling and according to a May 2011 poll 59.8% of the city's inhabitants preferred the ''Å'' spelling.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://jp.dk/aarhus/article2421688.ece|title=Dobbelt-a i modvind i Aarhus|date=2011-05-05|newspaper=Jyllands-Posten}} {{da icon}}</ref>

Although the name on many signs and other physical media still reads ''Århus'', official informational websites have effectively altered occurrences of ''Århus'' to ''Aarhus''. Furthermore, certain geographically affiliated names have been updated to reflect the name of the city. An example is the [[Aarhus River]] for which the Danish name has been altered from ''Århus Å'' to ''Aarhus Å''.<ref name="The Aarhus River"/> However, in Danish it is always correct to write geographical names with the letter Å, while local councils since 1984 have been allowed to use the Aa spelling as an alternative option. When a local authority decides so, most newspapers and state institutions will re-adopt the pre-1948 Aa spelling and the Å spelling will in practice become second-place. However, the official authorities are the [[Danish Placename Commission]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stednavneudvalget.ku.dk/ |title=Danish Placename Commission |publisher=Stednavneudvalget.ku.dk |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref> and the [[Dansk Sprognævn|Danish Language Committee]], publisher of the [[Retskrivningsordbogen|Danish Orthographic Dictionary]], which will keep ''Århus'' as the main name and have ''Aarhus'' as a new, second option, in brackets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dsn.dk/nyt/nyheder/2011/aarhus-eller-aarhus|title=Århus eller Aarhus?|year=2011|publisher=Danish Language Committee}} {{da icon}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Hørning-kirke1.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Interlacing knotwork designs and stylised dragon [[Roof construction#Construction of a ridged roof|ridge plates]] on a reconstruction of an early church at [[Moesgaard Museum]]]]
The bishopric of Aarhus dates back to at least 948,<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians}}</ref> and archaeological findings date back some 1,300&nbsp;years to [[Viking]] times. The city itself is presumably older than 770&nbsp;AD, making Aarhus the oldest big city in Scandinavia.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The favourable central position of the city within Denmark afforded it trade from [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]], the [[Balts|Baltic countries]], the greater peninsula of [[Jutland]] and the communities on the many smaller islands in its vicinity, which meant that trade always had a great significance to the town – a significance which is still true today.

The city did not expand outwards until the late 19th century, and [[Aalborg]] remained the largest city on the peninsula until the 1920s. The relatively fast, albeit late, growth of the city can be ascribed to the general tendencies of a population moving from rural to urban areas during the [[industrial revolution]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}Industrialisation meant that proximity to trade routes became more important, giving the harbour city some advantages over other nearby cities as new industries came into existence.

===Viking Age and before===
[[File:Aros viking town.jpg|thumb|180px|left|fortified Viking Town Aros (Aarhus) 950&nbsp;AD]]
[[File:Aroa viking town 1.jpg|thumb|180px|fortified Viking Town Aros]]
The oldest [[Archaeology|archaeological]] findings in Aarhus are glass pearls, which date to the end of the 7th century. Half buried [[longhouse]]s, used both as homes and workshops for the Vikings have also been found.<ref>Hans Skov, "Aros 700–1000", in: ''Vikingernes Aros'' Århus 2005, 15–39.</ref> In the houses and the adjoining archaeological layers, combs, jewellery and basic multi-purpose tools have been found that indicate the settlement is from approximately year 900. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The finding of six [[runestone]]s in and around Aarhus indicates the city had some significance around year 1000 as only wealthy nobles traditionally used them.<ref>Gundhild Øeby Nissen, "Runesten", in: ''Vikingernes Aros'' Århus 2005, 46–51.</ref> The centre of Aarhus was once a [[Germanic paganism|pagan burial site]] until Aarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a timber structure, was built upon it during the reign of [[Frode]], King of Jutland, around 900.<ref name=VIKINGAROS>Damm, Annette. ''Viking Aros'' (2005) ISBN 87-87334-63-1</ref>

===17th–18th centuries===
[[File:Århus segl 1421 1608 jth.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The Aarhus city seal from 1421 and 1608.]]
During the wars of the 17th century, it is probable that the city suffered in a significant way. Fortifications still exist south of the city as a reminder of the [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] imperial campaigns between 1627 and 1629. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In spite of these and other misfortunes, such as plague and city-wide fires, Aarhus was still quite a significant city in [[Denmark-Norway|Denmark]] due to its favourable geographical position which was of significant importance for trading.

===19th century===
In the 19th century, the city gained more independence from the dominance of [[Copenhagen]] and [[Hamburg]]. While it had been the third largest city in Jutland during the early 19th century, its population surpassed [[Randers]] in 1840 {{citation needed|date=June 2013}} and in 1850, [[Aalborg]], thus becoming the largest city in Jutland and the second largest in Denmark.

The city's material prosperity continued to increase as the harbour expanded and the railway network grew. Culturally, it marketed itself as the "Capital of Jutland" and expanded many of its cultural institutions like the national library, universities, the [[Aarhus Theatre]] and hospitals.

==Geography==
<!-- please find photo of the Aarhus Main Railwaystation, and insert it here -->
The city lies roughly at the geographical centre of Denmark on the peninsula of [[Jutland]]. Forests reach from the south into the city to within a kilometre (0.6&nbsp;mi) of the city centre, because the city has grown around the forest, and some forest areas are completely surrounded by the city, such as [[Riis Skov]]. The city is built mostly around the harbour, which is predominantly industrial, although a large recreational marina is situated south of it as an extension.
[[File:South Aarhus.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Aerial view of Aarhus from the north.]]

While some of the highest points in Denmark are close to the city, the general landscape is typically hilly, interspersed with forests and meadows; the city itself is very hilly north of the centre (by Danish standards, that is; see [[Highest hill, Denmark|Highest hill]], Denmark).

The city lies at the junction of [[railway]] lines from all parts of the country. To the south west (about {{convert|21|km|mi|abbr=on}}, by rail) lies a picturesque region that contains the [[Gudenaa|Gudenå]]. Several larger lakes extend West from the [[Skanderborg]] railway junction and rise to heights exceeding {{convert|152|m|ft}} at [[Himmelbjerget]]. The railway traverses this district of moorland and woodland to [[Silkeborg]].

===Administrative divisions===
Aarhus is divided into several districts and suburbs with its own postal code (Postdistrikter).

Districts (boroughs) inside the second city beltway:
*[[Aarhus C]]
*[[Aarhus N]]
*[[Aarhus V]]
*[[Højbjerg]]
*[[Åbyhøj]]
*[[Viby J|Viby]]
*[[Brabrand]]
{{Suburbs of Aarhus}}

==Demographics==
More than 300,000 people live within the city limits of Aarhus,<ref>[http://www2.aarhuskommune.dk/m0/struktur05/Befolkning/indexlevel1/indexAldersinddelinger.html Aarhus Kommunes Statistiske Årbog, 2005]{{Dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> while an additional 500,000 live in the surrounding local area of the [[Jutland|East Jutland]] region.
Aarhus is also a major part of the larger [[East Jutland metropolitan area]] with 1,200,000 inhabitants, which makes East Jutland the second most-populated area in Denmark, after the [[Copenhagen]] area.<ref>[http://www.dst.dk/TilSalg/Boghandel/Befolkning.aspx Danmarks Statistik] 2006a {{da icon}}</ref><ref name="Ojylbu">{{cite web|url=http://vbn.aau.dk/en/publications/fremtidens-byudvikling-i-oestjylland%2874466d00-7cf0-11dc-97b9-000ea68e967b%29.html|format=PDF|title=Fremtidens Byudvikling i Østjylland|year=2007|author=Peter Bro, Ph.D.-studerende, M.Sc., Aalborg Universitet, Henrik Harder, Lektor, Ph.D. HD.O MAA, Aalborg Universitet}} {{da icon}}</ref>

The population of Aarhus is both younger and better-educated than the national average.<ref name=Ojylbu/> This is often attributed to the high concentration of educational institutions and facilities in the area.

Nearly 12% of the population are immigrants, which is high for Denmark, but modest when compared to some other European cities. The largest immigrant groups (January 1, 2008) are Palestinians (4,644), Turks (4,089), Somalis (3,476), Iraqis (3,140), Vietnamese (2,382), and Iranians (2,199). {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} These groups live mainly in the western parts of Aarhus, where the [[Gellerup]] area is infamous for its high concentration of immigrants (88%, 2006). The vast majority of the immigrants in Gellerup are [[Arabs]], [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Somali people|Somalis]]. Other large immigrant groups in Aarhus include Germans (1,573), Poles (1,555), Norwegians (1,050), Afghans (958), and Britons (763).

==Economy==
[[File:Emma Mærsk2.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Emma Mærsk]], at the time the world's largest container ship, in Aarhus Harbour, 5 September 2006. Aarhus' central location within Denmark facilitates transport throughout the country and beyond]]<!-- Please find good picture of the harbour here, and insert -->
The harbour is one of the largest industrial harbours in [[Northern Europe]]. It has the largest container terminal in Denmark and accommodates the largest container vessels in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maerskbrokeragency.com/OFFICES/DENMARK/OTHER_DANISH_PORTS.aspx |title= OTHER DANISH PORTS|publisher=Maerskbrokeragency.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> The facilities are very modern and handle approximately 12&nbsp;million tonnes of cargo (2006) and are therefore among the 100 biggest containerports in the world.<ref>[http://www.aarhushavn.dk/pages/regnskab/XII.htm XII.Godsomsætning], Århus Havn, 2000 {{da icon}}</ref> Much agricultural produce is exported, while [[coal]] and [[iron]] are among the chief imports. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} The harbour itself is maintained by [[Århus Stevedore Kompagni A/S]] originally based in Aarhus but currently operating several harbours around the world.

The region is a major producer of [[agriculture|agricultural products]] with many large farms in the outlying districts. Cattle, pork and grain are the main products with a sizable related refinement industry present. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The [[Ceres Brewery]], part of [[Royal Unibrew]], was originally founded in Aarhus. Royal Unibrew announced the closure of Ceres in 2008.

==Culture==
[[File:DGB2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Old Town Open Air Museum; one of two museums in the area, and four in Denmark, with open air displays of period architecture. See [[The Old Town, Aarhus]]]]
Aarhus is a centre for education on the peninsula of [[Jutland]]. It draws students from a large area, especially from the western and southern parts of the peninsula. The relatively large influx of young people and students creates a natural base for cultural activities. There are many cafes and restaurants as well as discothèques, cinemas, museums, amusement parks, and various other entertainment venues. Each year, the town hosts several festivals and concerts, including [[NorthSide Festival (Denmark)|NorthSide Festival]], [[Aarhus International Jazz Festival]] and [[Aarhus Festuge]] the biggest festival in Scandinavia. The [[Vestereng]] park facility is also a site for large popular-music concerts.

One major tourist attraction in Aarhus is [[The Old Town, Aarhus|The Old Town]] ({{lang-da|Den Gamle By}}), which is not actually an old part of the city itself, but a collection of historic Danish buildings gathered from all around the country. The city also hosts the [[Tivoli Friheden]] amusement park as well as the [[Medieval deer park|deer park]] situated in the large nearby public forest.

Architecturally impressive sights include the 13th century [[cathedral]] in the centre of the city; [[Århus Domkirke]] is the tallest cathedral in Denmark, as well as the second longest in [[Northern Europe]], being only {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}} shorter than its counterpart in [[Trondheim]]. The [[Aarhus City Hall]] is a uniquely designed building drawn by renowned architect [[Arne Jacobsen]], located in the city centre. The city hall is included in the national educational canon for culture as an example of important architectural work.

There are many museums scattered around the city with [[ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum|ARoS]] being the newest and largest featuring daily exhibits of contemporary art. Other museums include [[Aarhus Kunstbygning]] which also features contemporary art, [[Frihedsmuseet]] which focuses on the occupation and resistance movement during [[World War II]] and [[Kvindemuseet]] which showcases feminist history and culture.

Being a comparatively large Danish city, Aarhus has received a fair share of immigrants from various other cultures and is as such also home to one of the few [[ghetto]]s in Denmark, [[Gellerup]]. The international cultures present in the community are an obvious and visible part of the city's daily life and contribute to many cultural flavours uncommon for the North, such as the [[Arabic]] themed [[Bazar West]], a market with shopkeepers predominantly of foreign descent. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The city has an active and visible gay and lesbian community which the city officially attempts to promote and nurture.<ref>[http://www.aarhus.dk/aa/portal/temaer/s_homo Homo i Århus] at ''Aarhus.dk'' {{da icon}}</ref> The [[Aarhus Festuge]] festival usually includes several exhibits, concerts or events specifically designed for these communities. There are several clubs, discos and cafes aimed at gays and lesbians: Danish D-lite (sports), G bar (disco) or Gaia Vandreklub (hiking club) are a few examples.

It is common for tourist brochures and local politicians to refer to the town with the tongue-in-cheek slogan "The world's smallest big city"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sologstrand.com/holiday-denmark/djursland-mols.htm |title=Holiday Djursland and Mols |publisher=Sologstrand.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref> reflecting the fact that the city has everything a city needs despite not being a metropolis like London. Another popular, and perhaps better known, phrase to describe the city is "City of Smiles" – a slogan first coined by the city council in the 1930s as an advertising slogan, and which subsequently is used widely in popular culture today.

Several sport clubs have their home ground in Atletion, including [[AGF Århus]], the Danish superliga football team, and [[Aarhus GF Håndbold|Aarhus GF]] [[Team handball|handball]] team, the 1960 European Cup runner-up. Although [[basketball]] is a minor sport in Denmark, Aarhus is considered the main Danish hub of the sport {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}, with the local team [[Bakken Bears]] being the most successful team in Denmark for the past decade. There are also two [[American football]] clubs: [[Aarhus Frogs]] and [[Århus Tigers]]. Aarhus also have a [[Danish Division 1|Division 1]] ranked [[ice hockey]] team called [[IK Århus]].

Aarhus (and especially Atletion) has served or will serve as the host of many sport events in recent years including:

It is possible to receive higher education in many areas, from [[engineering]] and [[dentistry]] to [[language]] and [[theology]].

As of January 1, 2012 [[Aarhus University]] was the largest university in Denmark if measured by the amount of students enlisted.<ref name="businessaarhus.dk">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessaarhus.dk/da/NewsList/2011/4-kvartal/Aarhus-Universitet-runder-40-000-studerende.aspx |title=Aarhus Universitet runder 40.000 studerende: Business Aarhus |publisher=Businessaarhus.dk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref> The university has approximately 41,500 [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]] and [[Master's degree|Master]] students enlisted and further about 1,500 [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] students.<ref name="businessaarhus.dk"/>

==Politics==
The city council consists of 31 members elected for 4-year terms. Anybody eligible to vote and residing in [[Aarhus municipality]] can run for a seat on the city council. After elections have determined the members of the city council, the council elects a mayor, 2 deputy mayors and 5 councilmen.<ref>[http://www.aarhuskommune.dk/portal/politik/byraad Byråd], [[Aarhus Municipality]], July 15, 2003 {{da icon}}</ref> The current [[Mayor]] of Aarhus is [[Jacob Bundsgaard]] of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]], who took over after [[Nicolai Wammen]] in August 2011. Wammen wanted to focus on the upcoming election for Parliament.

The city is divided into 6 minor administrative bodies which together constitute the [[magistrate]] led by the mayor and the 5 elected councilmen as political and administrative directors. The 6 magistrate departments of the city are the "Mayor's Magistrate", "Social and Employment Magistrate", "Technology and Environment Magistrate", "Health and Social Magistrate", "Culture and Service Magistrate" and "Children and Youth Magistrate" and handle all the day-to-day operations of the city.

Aarhus is the seat of [[Aarhus Municipality]]. Until the 2007 Danish Municipal Reform, which replaced the Danish counties with five regions, it was also the seat of [[Aarhus County]], which has now been disbanded in favour of the new [[Region Midtjylland]], its seat located in [[Viborg County|Viborg]].

==Transport==
[[File:Bycykler i stativ i Århus.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Aarhus City Bikes.]]
[[Aarhus Airport]] is located {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-east of Aarhus in [[Tirstrup]], the bigger [[Billund Airport]] is situated {{convert|95|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-west of Aarhus. There have been plans for constructing a new, bigger airport for a long time, but so far, the plans have not been realised.

Aarhus is served by commuter rail that connects the city itself with neighbouring towns. The main station in Aarhus is [[Aarhus Central Station]], which is located in the city centre. Most city bus lines go through the inner city and pass through either Park Alle or Banegårdspladsen (lit. English: "Central Station Square") or both. County and Inter-city buses terminate at Aarhus Bus Terminal which is located 900&nbsp;meters north-west of Banegårdspladsen, and in front of the [[Radisson SAS]] Scandinavia hotel at Margrethepladsen. The long-distance busses of ''linie888'' connect Aarhus to other cities in Jutland and [[Zealand]].<ref>[http://www.abildskou.dk/en "linie888"]. Retrieved 30 July 2012.</ref>

The Danish ferry company [[Mols-Linien]] connects Aarhus with [[Copenhagen]] (located on the isle of Zealand). The fastest ferries in the world (100&nbsp;km/h) operate up to 10 times daily from the port of Aarhus to the port city of [[Sjællands Odde]]. The ferries transport both private vehicles and the line888 busses. The German based ferry company [[Förde Reederei Seetouristik]] has since 2011 been a competitor with a line from Aarhus to [[Kalundborg]] on Zealand, the competition with Mols-linien was extended in summer 2012 as they inserted a fast ferry on the line.

Aarhus has a free bike sharing system, ''Aarhus Bycykler'' (Aarhus City Bikes). The bicycles are available from 1 April to 30 October at 57 stands throughout the city and can be obtained by placing a DKK 20 coin in the release slot, just like caddies in a supermarket. The coin can be retrieved when the bike is returned.<ref>[http://bycykler.foundry.aarhuskommune.dk/ "Aarhus Bycyckel"]. Retrieved 30 July 2012.</ref> Bicycles can also be hired from many shops.

The [[Aarhus Letbane]] is a planned [[tram-train]] project which will link two railway lines with a new light rail route through the city.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/aarhus-tram-train-project-gets-the-go-ahead.html |title=Aarhus tram-train project gets the go-ahead |date=10 May 2012 |publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}</ref>

==Twin towns — Sister cities==
Aarhus is [[town twinning|twinned]] with seven cities:
Originally the cities had most co-operation within the public school, culture and welfare sectors, but now the co-operation is extended to also cover commercial interests.

The cities are:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/da/omkommunen/organisation/aarhus-kommune-generelt/Venskabsbyer.aspx |title=Venskabsbyer: Aarhus Kommune |publisher=Aarhus.dk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
In Denmark, an "Aarhus story" — similar to a [[Molbo story]] — is a kind of derogatory [[ethnic joke]]. Such stories about the citizens of Aarhus began in the early 20th century and the term continues to be used colloquially. For example, one popular Aarhus story goes as follows. "Have you heard about the Aarhus citizen who was leafing through a phonebook and remarked: 'Jensen, Jensen, Jensen, Jensen, Jensen... How many phones does this guy have?'".<ref>H.A. Yearhouse, "De første 59 Aarhus-historier", Chr. Erichsens Forlag 1973.</ref> And a story referring to the local beer TOP goes like this "Why does the crown caps of the beers in Aarhus says TOP? Then the Aarhusians knows which end of the bottle should be opened!". The majority of the Aarhus stories are trying to convey the Aarhus citizens as stupid and many of them plays with the specialities of the city or the old and somewhat friendly cultural feud between the citizens of Aarhus (representing the [[Jutland|Jutes]]) and the citizens of [[Copenhagen]] (representing the [[Zealand]]ers).<ref>[http://www.dengamleby.dk/aarhus-vittigheder/ Aarhus stories] Den Gamle By</ref>
