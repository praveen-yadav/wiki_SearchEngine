'''Arteriovenous malformation''' or '''AVM''' is an abnormal connection between [[arteries]] and [[veins]], bypassing the [[capillary system]]. This [[vascular anomaly]] is widely known because of its occurrence in the [[central nervous system]], but can appear in any location. Although many AVMs are asymptomatic, they can cause intense pain or bleeding or lead to other serious medical problems.

AVMs are usually [[congenital]] and belong to the [[RASopathy|RASopathies]].
The genetic transmission patterns of AVM, if any, are unknown. AVM is not generally thought to be an inherited disorder, unless in the context of a specific hereditary [[syndrome]].

==History==

Emmanuel, Luschka and Virchow first described arteriovenous malformations in the mid-1800s. Olivecrona performed the first surgical excision of an intracranial AVM in 1932.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of AVM vary according to the location of the malformation. Roughly 88%<ref>[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/avms/detail_avms.htm#102083052 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]</ref> of people affected with AVM are asymptomatic; often the malformation is discovered as part of an [[autopsy]] or during treatment of an unrelated disorder (called in medicine "an incidental finding"); in rare cases its expansion or a micro-bleed from an AVM in the brain can cause epilepsy, deficit or pain.

The most general symptoms of a cerebral AVM include [[headache]] and [[epilepsy]], with more specific symptoms occurring that normally depend on the location of the malformation and the individual. Such possible symptoms include:<ref name=NINDS>{{NINDS|avms|Arteriovenous Malformation Information Page}}</ref>

* Difficulties with movement or coordination, including [[muscle weakness]] and even [[paralysis]];
* [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] (dizziness);
* Difficulties of speech ([[dysarthria]]) and communication, such as [[aphasia]];
* Difficulties with everyday activities, such as [[apraxia]];
* Abnormal sensations (numbness, tingling, or spontaneous [[pain]]);
* Memory and thought-related problems, such as [[confusion]], [[dementia]] or [[hallucination]]s.

Cerebral AVMs may present in a number of ways

*Hemorrhage (45% of cases)
**Acute onset of severe headache. May be described as the worst headache of the patient's life. Depending on the location of hemorrhage, may be associated with new fixed neurologic deficit. In unruptured brain AVMs, the risk of spontaneous hemorrhage may be as low as 1% per year. After a first rupture, the annual bleeding risk may increase to more than 5%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stapf C, Mast H, Sciacca RR, ''et al.'' |title=Predictors of hemorrhage in patients with untreated brain arteriovenous malformation |journal=Neurology |volume=66 |issue=9 |pages=1350–5 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16682666 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000210524.68507.87 |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16682666}}</ref>

*Seizure (46%)

*Headache (34%)

*Progressive neurologic deficit (21%)
**May be caused by mass effect or venous dilatations. Presence and nature of deficit depend on location of lesion and the draining veins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Choi JH, Mast H, Hartmann A, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical and morphological determinants of focal neurological deficits in patients with unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation |journal=J.

*Pediatric patients
**Heart failure
**Macrocephaly
**Prominent scalp veins

== Genetics ==
Can occur due to autosomal dominant diseases, such as [[Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Pathophysiology==
In a normal functioning human body, arteries carry blood away from the heart to the lungs or the rest of the body, where the blood passes through capillaries, and veins return the blood to heart. An AVM interferes with this process by forming a direct connection of the arteries and veins. AVMs can cause intense pain and lead to serious medical problems. Although AVMs are often associated with the brain and spinal cord, they can develop in any part of the body.

Arteries and veins are part of the [[Circulatory system|human cardiovascular system]]. Normally, the arteries in the vascular system carry oxygen-rich blood, except in the case of the pulmonary artery. Structurally, arteries divide and sub-divide repeatedly, eventually forming a sponge-like [[capillary bed]]. Blood moves through the [[Capillary|capillaries]], giving up oxygen and taking up waste products, including {{chem|link=Carbon dioxide|CO|2}}, from the surrounding cells. Capillaries in turn successively join together to form veins that carry blood away. The heart acts to pump blood through arteries and uptake the venous blood.

An AVM lacks the dampening effect of capillaries on the blood flow; it also causes the surrounding area to be deprived of the functions of the capillaries — removal of {{CO2}} and delivery of nutrients to the cells. The resulting tangle of blood vessels, often called a ''nidus'' (Latin for "nest"), has no capillaries. It can be extremely fragile and prone to bleeding because of the abnormally direct connections between high-pressure arteries and low-pressure veins. The resultant sign, audible via stethoscope, is a rhythmic, whooshing sound caused by excessively rapid blood flow through the arteries and veins. It has been given the term "bruit", French for noise. On some occasions a patient with a brain AVM may become aware of the noise, which can compromise hearing and interfere with sleep in addition to causing psychological distress.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:PleftkidneyAVM1.png|thumb|An arterial venous malformation of the left kidney and a simple cyst of the right kidney]]
AVMs are diagnosed primarily by the following methods:
* [[Computerized tomography|Computerized Tomography (CT)]] scan is a noninvasive X-ray to view the anatomical structures within the brain to detect blood in or around the brain. A newer technology called CT angiography involves the injection of contrast into the blood stream to view the arteries of the brain. This type of test provides the best pictures of blood vessels through angiography and soft tissues through CT.
* [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)]] scan is a noninvasive test, which uses a magnetic field and radio-frequency waves to give a detailed view of the soft tissues of your brain. 
* An MRA ([[Magnetic resonance angiogram|Magnetic Resonance Angiogram]]) is the same non-invasive study, except it is also an angiogram, which means it also examines the blood vessels, as well as the structures of the brain. Angiogram is an invasive procedure, where a catheter is inserted into an artery and passed through the blood vessels to the brain. Once the catheter is in place, a contrast dye is injected into the bloodstream and the X-ray images are taken.<ref>http://www.mayfieldclinic.com/PE-AVM.htm#.UjXFdGFKSmc</ref>

AVMs may occur in isolation or as a part of another disease (for example, [[Von Hippel-Lindau disease]] or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia).

AVMs have been shown to be associated with [[Aortic Stenosis]].<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12912718 | doi=10.1001/archinte.163.15.1821|title=Increased Prevalence of Aortic Stenosis in Patients with Arteriovenous Malformations of the Gastrointestinal Tract in Heyde Syndrome|year=2003|last1=Batur|first1=P.|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|volume=163|issue=15|pages=1821–4|last2=Stewart|first2=WJ|last3=Isaacson|first3=JH}}</ref>

Bleeding from an AVM can be relatively mild or devastating. It can cause severe and less often fatal [[stroke]]s. If a cerebral AVM is detected before a stroke occurs, usually the arteries feeding blood into the nidus can be closed off to avert the danger. However, interventional therapy may also be relatively risky. <!-- The cerebral arteriovenous malformation article states that benefits of such intervention have not been proven to outweigh risk; ongoing international study mentioned below. -->

<!-- == Screening == -->

== Treatment ==
Treatment for brain AVMs can be symptomatic, and patients should be followed by a neurologist for any seizures, headaches or focal deficits. AVM-specific treatment may also involve endovascular embolization, neurosurgery or radiation therapy.<ref name=NINDS/>
Embolization, that is, cutting off the blood supply to the AVM with coils or particles or [[glue]] introduced by a radiographically guided catheter, can be used in addition to either, but is rarely successful in isolation except for in smaller AVMs. The neurological risk of any such intervention is roughly 10%.

The Spetzler-Martin grading system developed at the [[Barrow Neurological Institute]] is utilized by neurosurgeons to determine operative versus nonoperative management of AVMs.

== Epidemiology ==

The estimated detection rate of AVM in the US general population is 1.4/100,000 per year.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stapf C, Mast H, Sciacca RR, ''et al.'' |title=The New York Islands AVM Study: design, study progress, and initial results |journal=Stroke |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=e29–33 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12690217 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000068784.36838.19 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12690217}}</ref> This is approximately one fifth to one seventh the incidence of intracranial aneurysms. An estimated 300,000 [[United States|Americans]] have AVMs, of whom 12% (approximately 36,000) will exhibit symptoms of greatly varying severity.<ref name=NINDS/>

== Research directions ==
Despite many years of research, the central question of whether to treat AVMs has not been answered. All treatments, whether involving surgery, radiation, or drugs, have risks and side-effects. Therefore, it might be better in some cases to avoid treatment altogether and simply accept a small risk of coming to harm from the AVM itself. This question is currently being addressed in clinical trials.<ref>[http://www.cliniclog.com/arterio-venous_malformations.php Research trials in arterio-venous malformations; Rustam Al-Shahi Salman]</ref>{{dead link|date=October 2012}}
