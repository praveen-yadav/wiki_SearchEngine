The Romans also settled in the area during the time of the [[Roman empire]]. [[Caucasian Albania]]ns, the original inhabitants of the area, established an independent kingdom around the 4th century BC. During this period, Zoroastrianism spread in the Caucasus and Atropatene. Ancient Azerbaijanis spoke the [[Old Azari language]].

===Feudal era===
[[File:Maiden Tower in Baku, Azerbaijan.jpg|thumb|The [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]] in [[Old Baku]] is a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in the 11th–12th century.]]
The Persian [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] turned Caucasian Albania into a [[vassal state]] in AD 252, while King Urnayr officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century. Despite numerous conquests by the Sassanids and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], Albania remained an entity in the region until the 9th century. The Islamic [[Umayyad Caliphate]] repulsed both the Sassanids and Byzantines from the region and turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state after the Christian resistance, led by King [[Javanshir]], was suppressed in 667. The power vacuum left by the decline of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the [[Sallarid]]s, [[Sajids]], [[Shaddadid]]s, [[Rawadid]]s and [[Buyid dynasty|Buyids]]. At the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by waves of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] tribes from Central Asia. The first of these Turkic dynasties established was the [[Ghaznavid Empire|Ghaznavids]], which entered the area now known as Azerbaijan by 1030.

The pre-Turkic Azerbaijani population spoke an [[Iranian language]] called the [[Old Azari language]], which was gradually replaced by a [[Turkic language]], now known as the [[Azerbaijani language]] from the 11th century onward until it became completely extinct in the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Yarshater|first=E.|chapter=The Iranian Language of Azerbaijan|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica|volume=III/2|year=1987|chapter-url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/azerbaijan-vii}}</ref> To distinguish it from the Turkic Azerbaijani or Azeri language, this Iranian language, is designated as the Azari language (or Old Azari language), because the Turkic language and people are also designated as "Azari" in the [[Persian language]]. However some linguists have also designated the [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tati dialects]] of [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]] and the Republic of Azerbaijan, like those spoken by the [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tats]], as a remnant of Azari.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ludwig |first=Paul|year=1998|location= Cambridge|title=Proceedings of the Third European Conference of Iranian Studies|volume= 1 |edition= Nicholas Sims-Williams (ed.) |publisher= Wiesbaden: Reichert |isbn=978-3-89500-070-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Olivier |year=2007|title=The new Central Asia: geopolitics and the birth of nations|page= 6 |edition= reprint |publisher=I.B.

Under the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], local poets such as [[Nizami Ganjavi]] and [[Khaqani|Khagani Shirvani]] gave rise to a blossoming of [[Persian literature]] on the territory of present-day Azerbaijan. The next ruling state of the [[Jalayirids]] was short-lived and fell under the conquests of [[Timur]].

The local dynasty of [[Shirvanshah]]s became a vassal state of [[Timurid dynasty|Timur's Empire]], and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the [[Golden Horde]] [[Tokhtamysh]]. Following Timur's death two independent and rival states emerged: [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]]. The Shirvanshahs returned, maintaining a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals from 861 until 1539.

After the collapse of the Russian Empire during [[World War I]], Azerbaijan, together with [[Armenia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] became part of the short-lived [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]]. When the republic dissolved in May 1918, Azerbaijan declared independence as the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] (ADR).

By March 1920, it was obvious that Soviet Russia would attack the much-needed Baku.

On October 13, 1921, the Soviet republics of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia signed an agreement with Turkey known as the [[Treaty of Kars]]. The previously independent Naxicivan SSR would also become an autonomous ASSR within the Azerbaijan SSR by the treaty of Kars. On the other hand, Armenia was awarded the region of [[Syunik Province|Zangezur]] and Turkey agreed to return [[Gyumri]] (then known as Alexandropol).

During [[World War II]], Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of Soviet Union, with most of the Soviet Union's oil on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] being supplied by Baku. By the Decree of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] in February 1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the [[petroleum industry|oil industry]] of Azerbaijan was awarded orders and medals.
[[Operation Edelweiss]] carried out by the German [[Wehrmacht]] targeted Baku because of its importance as the energy ([[petroleum]]) dynamo of the USSR.<ref name="Swietochowski Borderland"/> A fifth of all Azerbaijanis fought in the Second World War from 1941 to 1945.

The main water sources are the surface waters.

Azerbaijan's four main islands in the Caspian Sea have a combined area of over thirty square kilometer.

Since the independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, the [[Politics of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani government]] has taken drastic measures to preserve the environment of Azerbaijan. But national protection of the environment started to truly improve after 2001 when the state budget increased due to new revenues provided by the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline]]. Within four years protected areas doubled and now make up eight percent of the country's territory. Since 2001 the government has set up seven large reserves and almost doubled the sector of the budget earmarked for environmental protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enrin.grida.no/htmls/azer/soe/ecology/html/ecology.html |title=Ecological problems in Azerbaijan |publisher=Enrin.grida.no |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref>

The formation of climate in Azerbaijan is influenced particularly by cold [[arctic]] [[air mass]]es of [[Scandinavia]]n [[anticyclone]], temperate of [[Siberia]]n anticyclone, and Central Asian anticyclone.<ref name="CLIM">{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan – Climate| publisher = Heydar Aliyev Foundation| url = http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Geography/_Climate/_climate_e.html| accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref> Azerbaijan's diverse landscape affects the ways air masses enter the country.<ref name="CLIM"/> The Greater Caucasus protects the country from direct influences of cold air masses coming from the north. That leads to the formation of [[Subtropics|subtropical climate]] on most foothills and plains of the country. Meanwhile, plains and foothills are characterized by high [[Sunlight|solar radiation]] rates.

9 out of 11 existing [[Köppen climate classification|climate zones]] are present in Azerbaijan.<ref name="KL">{{cite web| title =Climate| work = Water Resources of the Azerbaijan Republic| publisher = Institute of Hydrometeorology, Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources | url = http://www.azhydromet.com/SRIH/Water%20Resurs.html| accessdate = 2007-05-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070524005453/http://www.azhydromet.com/SRIH/Water%20Resurs.html| archivedate= 24 May 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Both the absolute minimum temperature (<span style="white-space:nowrap"> {{convert|-33|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} </span>) and the absolute maximum temperature (<span style="white-space:nowrap"> {{convert|46|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} </span>) were observed in [[Julfa Rayon|Julfa]] and [[Ordubad Rayon|Ordubad]].<ref name="KL"/> The maximum annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falls in [[Lankaran]] ({{convert|1600|to|1800|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and the minimum in Absheron ({{convert|200|to|350|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}).<ref name="KL"/>

Rivers and lakes form the principal part of the water systems of Azerbaijan, they were formed over a long geological timeframe and changed significantly throughout that period. This is particularly evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country. The country's water systems are continually changing under the influence of natural forces and human introduced industrial activities. Artificial rivers (canals) and ponds are a part of Azerbaijan's water systems. From the [[water supply]] point, Azerbaijan is below the average in the world with approximately {{convert|100000|m3|0|abbr=off}} per year of water per square kilometer.<ref name="KL"/> All big [[Reservoir|water reservoirs]] are built on Kur. The hydrography of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the [[Caspian Sea basin]].

There are 8,350 rivers of various lengths within Azerbaijan. Only 24 rivers are over 100&nbsp;kilometers long.<ref>{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan: Geography| publisher = Central Asia and Caucasus Institute| url = http://www.cac-biodiversity.org/aze/aze_geography.htm}}</ref> The [[Kura River|Kura]] and [[Aras River|Aras]] are the most popular rivers in Azerbaijan, they run through the [[Kura-Aras Lowland]]. The rivers that directly flow into the Caspian Sea, originate mainly from the north-eastern slope of the Major Caucasus and [[Talysh Mountains]] and run along the Samur–Devechi and Lankaran lowlands.

[[Yanar Dag]], translated as "burning mountain"), is a [[natural gas]] fire which blazes continuously on a hillside on the [[Absheron Peninsula]] on the [[Caspian Sea]] near [[Baku]], which itself is known as the "land of fire." Flames jet out into the air from a thin, porous sandstone layer.  It is a tourist attraction to visitors to the Baku area.

The first reports on the richness and diversity of animal life in Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers. Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks and stones survived up to the present times. The first information on the animal kingdom of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of naturalists to Azerbaijan in 17th century.<ref name="GEO"/> Unlike fauna, the concept of animal kingdom covers not only the types of animals, but also the number of individual species.

There are 106 species of mammals, 97 species of fish, 363 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians and 52 species of reptiles which have been recorded and classified in Azerbaijan.<ref name="GEO"/> The national animal of Azerbaijan is the [[Karabakh horse]], a mountain-steppe racing and riding horse endemic to Azerbaijan. The Karabakh horse has a reputation for its good temper, speed, elegance and intelligence. It is one of the oldest breeds, with ancestry dating to the ancient world. However today the horse is an endangered species.<ref>{{cite web| title =The Karabakh Horse | publisher = Karabakh Foundation| url = http://www.karabakhfoundation.org/pages/history-and-culture/karabakh-region/the-karabakh-horse/}}</ref>

Azerbaijan's flora consists of more than 4,500 species of [[higher plants]]. Due the unique climate in Azerbaijan, the flora is much richer in the number of species than the flora of the other republics of the South Caucasus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Geography/_Planting/_planting_e.html |title=Azerbaijan – Flora |publisher=Heydar Aliyev Foundation|accessdate=2010-03-05 }}</ref> About 67 percent of the species growing in the whole [[Caucasus]] can be found in Azerbaijan.

[[File:Munich Security Conference 2010 - dett aliyew 0014.jpg|thumb|[[President of Azerbaijan]] [[Ilham Aliyev]] at Security Conference 2010 in [[Munich]].]]
The structural formation of Azerbaijan's political system was completed by the adoption of the new [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] on 12 November 1995. According to the Article 23 of Constitution, the [[National symbol|state symbols]] of the Azerbaijan Republic are the [[Flag of Azerbaijan|flag]], the [[Coat of arms of Azerbaijan|coat of arms]] and the [[National Anthem of the Republic of Azerbaijan|national anthem]]. The state power in Azerbaijan is limited only by law for internal issues, but for international affairs is additionally limited by the provisions of international agreements.

The government of Azerbaijan is based on the [[separation of powers]] among the [[Legislature|legislative]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches. The legislative power is held by the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly]] and the Supreme National Assembly in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. Parliamentary elections are held every five years, on the first Sunday of November. The [[New Azerbaijan Party|Yeni Azerbaijan Party]], and independents loyal to the ruling government, currently hold almost all of the Parliament's 125 seats. During the [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010|2010 Parliamentary election]], the opposition parties, [[Musavat]] and [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party]], failed to win a single seat.  European observers [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010#Campaign irregularities|found numerous irregularities]] in the run up to the election and [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010#Election|on election day]].<ref>{{cite web| title =Monitors criticize Azeri elections | publisher = [[Al Jazeera]]| url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/11/2010118152810836488.html| accessdate = November 8, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101111072636/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/11/2010118152810836488.html| archivedate= 11 November 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The executive power is held by the [[President of Azerbaijan|President]], who is elected for a 5-year term by [[direct election]]s. The president is authorized to form the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]], an inferior executive body, subordinated to him. The Cabinet of Azerbaijan consists primarily of the [[Prime Minister of Azerbaijan|Prime Minister]], his Deputies and Ministers. The president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly, but he has the right to [[veto]] its decisions. To override the presidential veto, the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes. The judicial power is vested in the Constitutional Court, [[Supreme Court of Azerbaijan|Supreme Court]] and the [[Economic Court of Azerbaijan|Economic Court]]. The President nominates the judges in these courts.

The Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution. It was established on 10 April 1997. The administrative department is not a part of the president's office but manages the financial, technical and pecuniary activities of both the president and his office.

Although Azerbaijan has held several elections since regaining its independence and it has many of the formal institutions of democracy, it remains classified as "not free" (on border with "partly free") by [[Freedom House]].<ref>{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan - Freedom House | publisher = FreedomHouse.org | url =http://www.freedomhouse.org/country/azerbaijan| accessdate = August 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name="frh">{{cite web| title =Combined Average Ratings: Independent Countries 2009 | publisher = FreedomHouse.org| year =2009 | url = http://old.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=475&year=2009| accessdate = 2012-07-10}}</ref>

Azerbaijan is an active member of international coalitions fighting international terrorism. The country is contributing to peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. Azerbaijan is an active member of [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] program. It also maintains good relations with the [[European Union]] and could potentially one day apply for membership.<ref name="NSC AZ"/>

According to Soviet data, 100 percent of males and females (ages nine to forty-nine) were literate in 1970.<ref name="AZ study"/> According to the [[United Nations Development Program]] Report 2009, the literacy rate in Azerbaijan is 99.5 percent.<ref>{{cite web| title = Human Development Report 2009 | publisher = United Nations Development Program 2009| url = http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2009_EN_Complete.pdf| accessdate = 2009|format=PDF }}</ref>

Initial alterations have included the reestablishment of religious education (banned during the Soviet period) and curriculum changes that have reemphasized the use of the Azerbaijani language and have eliminated ideological content. In addition to elementary schools, the education institutions include thousands of [[preschool]]s, general secondary schools, and [[vocational schools]], including specialized secondary schools and technical schools. Education through the eighth grade is compulsory.

The acclaimed [[Book of Dede Korkut]] consists of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century,<ref name="Meeker">Michael E. Meeker, "The Dede Korkut Ethic", International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Aug., 1992), 395–417. excerpt: The Book of Dede Korkut is an early record of oral Turkic folktales in Anatolia, and as such, one of the mythic charters of Turkish nationalist ideology. The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves "Turcoman" rather than "Oghuz," had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen. Some had abandoned their nomadic way of life altogether.</ref> was not written earlier than the 15th century.<ref name="Kafadar">Cemal Kafadar(1995), "in Between Two Worlds: Construction of the Ottoman states", University of California Press, 1995.

Benefiting immensely from the fine literary traditions of his environment, and building upon the legacy of his predecessors, Fizuli was destined to become the leading literary figure of his society. His major works include ''The Divan of Ghazals'' and ''The Qasidas''. In the same century, Azerbaijani literature further flourished with the development of [[Ashik]] ({{lang-az|Aşıq}}) poetic genre of bards. During the same period, under the pen-name of Khatāī ({{lang-ar|خطائی}} for ''sinner'') Shah Ismail I wrote about 1400 verses in Azeri,<ref name="minorsky1">{{cite journal |last=Minorsky |first=Vladimir |year=1942 |title=The Poetry of Shah Ismail |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |volume=10 |issue=4 |page=1053  |url= |quote= |doi=10.1017/S0041977X00090182 }}</ref> which were later published as his ''Divan''. A unique literary style known as ''qoshma'' ({{lang-az|qoşma}} for ''improvization'') was introduced in this period, and developed by Shah Ismail and later by his son and successor, Shah [[Tahmasp I]].

In the span of the 17th and 18th centuries, Fizuli's unique genres as well [[Ashik]] poetry were taken up by prominent poets and writers such as [[Qovsi of Tabriz]], [[Abbas II of Persia|Shah Abbas Sani]], [[Agha Mesih Shirvani]], [[Nishat]], [[Molla Vali Vidadi]], [[Molla Panah Vagif]], [[Amani (poet)|Amani]], [[Zafar (poet)|Zafar]] and others.

Modern literature in Azerbaijan is based on the Shirvani dialect mainly, while in Iran it is based on the Tabrizi one. The first newspaper in Azerbaijani, ''[[Akinchi]]'' was published in 1875. In mid-19th century, it was taught in the schools of [[Baku]], [[Ganja (city)|Ganja]], [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]], [[Tbilisi]], and [[Yerevan]]. Since 1845, it has also been taught in the [[University of Saint Petersburg]] in Russia.

===Folk art===
{{Main|Azerbaijani folk art}}
[[File:Azerbaijan tradition.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Traditional Azerbaijani clothing and musical instruments.]]
Azerbaijanis have a rich and distinctive culture, a major part of which is [[decorative art|decorative]] and [[applied art]]. This form of art is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jeweler, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone and bone, carpet-making, lasing, pattern weaving and printing, knitting and embroidery. Each of these types of decorative art, evidence of the and endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very much in favor here. Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers and diplomats who had visited these places at different times.

The [[Azerbaijani rug|Azerbaijani carpet]] is a traditional handmade textile of various sizes, with dense texture and a pile or pile-less surface, whose patterns are characteristic of Azerbaijan’s many carpet-making regions. In November 2010 the Azerbaijani carpet was proclaimed a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&pg=00011&RL=00389 |title=The traditional art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving in the Republic of Azerbaijan |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=2011-01-04| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101205005739/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&pg=00011&RL=00389| archivedate= 5 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=134436 |title=Azerbaijani carpet entered UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage |publisher=Azerbaijan Press Agency |accessdate=2011-01-04}}</ref> Azerbaijan has been since the ancient times known as a center of a large variety of crafts. The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well developed agriculture, stock raising, metal working, pottery and ceramics, and last but not least carpet-weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC. Azerbaijani carpets can be categorized under several large groups and a multitude of subgroups. The true scientific research of the Azerbaijani carpet is connected with the name of [[Latif Kerimov]], a prominent scientist and artist. It was his classification that related the four large groups of carpets with the four geographical zones of Azerbaijan, Guba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh and Tabriz.<ref>{{cite web| title =Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura | publisher = [[UNESCO]] | url = http://portal.unesco.org/es/ev.php-URL_ID=31108&URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&URL_SECTION=201.html}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Azerbaijani cuisine}}
The traditional cuisine is famous for an abundance of vegetables and greens used seasonally in the dishes. Fresh herbs, including mint, cilantro (coriander), dill, basil, parsley, tarragon, leeks, chives, thyme, marjoram, green onion, and watercress, are very popular and often accompany main dishes on the table. Climatic diversity and fertility of the land are reflected in the national dishes, which are based on fish from the [[Caspian Sea]], local meat (mainly mutton and beef), and an abundance of seasonal vegetables and greens. Saffron-rice [[plov]] is the flagship food in Azerbaijan and [[black tea]] is the national beverage.<ref>{{cite web| last = Akhmedov| first = IA| title =Азербайджанская кухня | publisher = Издательство "Ишыг"| url = http://www.azeri.ru/az/cuisine/azerbaydjanskaya_kuhnya}}{{ru icon}}</ref> Azerbaijanis often use traditional [[armudu]] (pear-shaped) glass as Azerbaijan have very strong [[Azerbaijani tea culture|tea culture]].<ref name="aze">{{cite web | url =http://aze.info/azerbaijan_traditions/chaihana_baku/| title = Chaihana: culture in action|publisher =Aze.info| accessdate = 14 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sZVN2MwWZVAC&pg=PA244&dq=tea+in+Azerbaijan.&hl=ru&ei=eVC0TqfZEJHcsgaL5uXSAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=chaykhanas&f=false |title=The Azerbaijani Turks: power and identity under Russian rule.

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Azerbaijan}}
Azerbaijani architecture typically combines elements of [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western culture|West]].<ref>{{cite web| last = Khanlou | first = Pirouz | title =Baku's Architecture A Fusion of East and West | publisher = Azerbaijan International| url = http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/24_folder/24_articles/24_architecture.html| accessdate = Winter 1994}}</ref> Many ancient architectural treasures such as the [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]] and [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs]] in the [[Baku|Walled City of Baku]] survive in modern Azerbaijan. Entries submitted on the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] tentative list include the [[Ateshgah of Baku]], [[Momine Khatun Mausoleum]], [[Hirkan National Park]], [[Binegadi National Park]], [[Lok-Batan Mud Volcano]], [[Baku Stage Mountain]], [[Caspian Shore Defensive Constructions]], [[Shusha National Reserve]], [[Ordubad National Reserve]] and the [[Palace of Shaki Khans]].<ref>{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan Properties inscribed on the World Heritage List | publisher = [[UNESCO]] | url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/az}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title =World Heritage Sites in Azerbaijan | publisher = World Heritage Site | url = http://www.worldheritagesite.org/countries/azerbaijan.html}}</ref>

Among other architectural treasures are [[Quadrangular castle (Mardakan)|Quadrangular Castle]] in [[Mardakan]], [[Parigala]] in [[Yuxarı Çardaqlar|Yukhary Chardaglar]], a number of bridges spanning the Aras River, and several mausoleums. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, little monumental architecture was created, but distinctive residences were built in Baku and elsewhere. Among the most recent architectural monuments, the [[Baku Metro|Baku subway]]s are noted for their lavish decor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Over 70 underground stations to be built in Baku|url=http://news.az/articles/economy/25958|publisher=News.Az|accessdate=February 18, 2011}}</ref>

The task for modern Azerbaijani architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics, the search for an architect's own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment. Major projects such as [[Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center]], [[Flame Towers]], [[Baku Crystal Hall]], [[Baku White City]] and [[SOCAR Tower]] have transformed the country's skyline and promotes its contemporary identity.<ref>{{cite web|author=1 Feb 2012 Jon Walton |url=http://www.constructiondigital.com/under_construction/100-billion-khazar-islands-taking-shape |title=$100 Billion Khazar Islands Taking Shape |publisher=Construction Digital |date=2012-02-01 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Glass|first=Nick|title=Flame Towers light up Baku's historic skyline|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/26/world/asia/great-buildings-barry-hughes|work=[[CNN]]|publisher=CNN.com|accessdate=14 April 2013|authorlink=Nick Glass}}</ref>

[[File:Petroglyphs in Gobustan 01.jpg|thumb|right|Rock paintings in Gobustan]]
Azerbaijani art includes one of the oldest art objects in the world, which were discovered as [[Gamigaya Petroglyphs]] in the territory of [[Ordubad Rayon]] are dated back to the 1st to 4th centuries BC. About 1500 dislodged and carved rock paintings with images of deer, goats, bulls, dogs, snakes, birds, fantastic beings and also people, carriages and various symbols had been found out on basalt rocks.<ref>[http://irs-az.com/pdf/090621154956.pdf Наскальные рисунки Гямигая]</ref> Norwegian [[ethnographer]] and [[adventurer]] [[Thor Heyerdahl]] was convinced that people from the area went to [[Scandinavia]] in about 100 AD and took their boat building skills with them, and transmuted them into the Viking boats in Northern Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=ORNAMENTS COMING FROM GOBUSTAN|url=http://divainternational.ch/spip.php?article169|work=Diva International}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gobustan Rock Art|url=http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/gobustan.html|work=www.worldheritagesite.org|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>

Over the centuries, Azerbaijani art has gone through many stylistic changes. Azerbaijani painting is traditionally characterized by a warmth of colour and light, as exemplified in the works of [[Azim Azimzade]] and [[Bahruz Kangarli]], and a preoccupation with religious figures and cultural motifs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Azerbaijani Artists|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/soviet/Azerbaijani-Artists.html|work=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref> Azerbaijani painting enjoyed preeminence in Caucasus for hundreds of years, from the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] periods, and through the [[Socialist realism|Soviet]] and [[Baroque]] periods, the latter two of which saw fruition in Azerbaijan. Other notable artists who fall within these periods include [[Sattar Bahlulzade]], [[Togrul Narimanbekov]], [[Tahir Salahov]], [[Alakbar Rezaguliyev]], [[Mirza Gadim Iravani]], [[Mikayil Abdullayev]] and [[Boyukagha Mirzazade]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Steps of Time & Art is not only ugly|url=http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/nafas/articles/2008/azerbaijan_art|work=universes-in-universe.org|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>

===Cinematography===
{{Main|Cinema of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani animation|Television in Azerbaijan}}
The film industry in Azerbaijan dates back to 1898. In fact, Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in [[cinematography]].<ref name="mishon">{{cite news |url= http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/53_folder/53_articles/53_100years.html|title=Cinema in Azerbaijan: Pre-Soviet Era|date=Autumn 1997|publisher="Azerbaijan International"|accessdate=Autumn 1997}}</ref> Therefore It's not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in [[Baku]] – at the start of the 20th century, this bay town on the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] was producing more than 50 percent of the world's supply of oil. Just like today, the oil industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to work.<ref name="cinemainazerbaijan">[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/53_folder/53_articles/53_100years.html Celebrating 100 Years in Film, not 80] by Aydin Kazimzade. Azerbaijan International, Autumn 1997</ref> In 1919, during the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], a documentary ''The Celebration of the Anniversary of Azerbaijani Independence'' was filmed on Azerbaijan's independence day, May 28, and premiered in June 1919 at several theatres in Baku.<ref name="ocaz">{{cite web| title =Azerbaijani cinema in 1920–1935: Silent films | publisher = OCAZ.eu| url = http://www.ocaz.eu/cinema-theatre.html}}</ref> After the Soviet power was established in 1920, Nariman Narimanov, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan, signed a decree nationalizing Azerbaijan's cinema. This also influenced the creation of [[Azerbaijani animation]].<ref name="ocaz"/>

In 1991, after Azerbaijan gained its independence from the Soviet Union, the first Baku International Film Festival East-West was held in Baku. In December 2000, the former President of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, signed a decree proclaiming August 2 to be the professional holiday of filmmakers of Azerbaijan. Today Azerbaijani filmmakers are again dealing with issues similar to those faced by cinematographers prior to the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1920. Once again, both choice of content and sponsorship of films are largely left up to the initiative of the filmmaker.<ref name="mishon"/>

There are three state-owned television channels: [[AzTV]], [[Idman Azerbaijan TV|Idman TV]] and [[Medeniyyet TV]]. One public channel, [[İctimai Television|Ictimai TV]] and 7 private channels: [[ANS TV]], [[Space TV]], [[Lider TV]], [[Azad Azerbaijan TV]], [[Xazar TV]] and [[Caspian Broadcasting Company|CBC]].

Sport in Azerbaijan has ancient roots, and even now, both traditional and modern sports are still practiced. [[Freestyle wrestling]] has been traditionally regarded as Azerbaijan's [[national sport]], in which Azerbaijan won up to fourteen medals, including four golds since joining the [[National Olympic Committee]]. Even though today, the most popular sports in Azerbaijan are [[association football|football]] and [[chess]].

The [[Azerbaijan national football team|national football team]] of Azerbaijan demonstrates relatively low performance in the international arena compared to the nation football clubs.
