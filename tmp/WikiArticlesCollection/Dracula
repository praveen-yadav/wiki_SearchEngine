'''''Dracula''''' is an  1897 Gothic horror novel by Irish author [[Bram Stoker]].<ref>First published as a hardcover in 1897  by Archibald Constable  and Co.  See http://www.bramstoker.org/novels.html Bibliography of Stoker's novels at Bram Stoker Online.</ref> 

Famous for introducing the character of the [[vampire]] [[Count Dracula]], the novel tells the story of Dracula's attempt to move from [[Transylvania]] to [[England]], and the battle between Dracula and a small group of men and women led by Professor [[Abraham Van Helsing]]. 

''Dracula'' has been assigned to many [[literary genre]]s including [[vampire literature]], [[horror fiction]], the [[gothic fiction|gothic novel]] and [[invasion literature]]. The novel touches on themes such as the role of women in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] culture, sexual conventions, immigration, [[colonialism]], and [[Post colonialism|post-colonialism]]. Although Stoker did not invent the vampire, he defined its modern form, and the novel has spawned numerous theatrical, film and television interpretations.

==Plot summary==
[[File:Stoker Dracula Notes Personal.jpg|thumb|Stoker's handwritten notes on the personnel of the novel.]]
The novel is told in [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]] format, as a series of letters, [[diary]] entries, ships' log entries, and so forth. The main writers of these items are also the novel's protagonists. The story is occasionally supplemented with newspaper clippings that relate events not directly witnessed by the story's characters. The events portrayed in the novel take place largely in England and Transylvania during 1893. 

The tale begins with [[Jonathan Harker]], a newly qualified English [[solicitor]], journeying by train and [[carriage]] from England to [[Count Dracula]]'s crumbling, remote castle (situated in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] on the border of [[Transylvania]], [[Bukovina]], and [[Moldavia]]). The purpose of his mission is to provide legal support to Dracula for a [[real estate]] transaction overseen by Harker's employer, Peter Hawkins, of [[Exeter]] in England. At first enticed by Dracula's gracious manner, Harker soon discovers that he has become a prisoner in the castle. He also begins to see disquieting facets of Dracula's nocturnal life. One night while searching for a way out of the castle, and against Dracula's strict admonition not to venture outside his room at night, Harker falls under the spell of three wanton female vampires, [[Brides of Dracula]] (referred to only as "the sisters" in the novel). He is saved at the last second by the Count, because he wants to keep Harker alive just long enough to obtain needed legal advice and teachings about England and London (Dracula's planned travel destination so as to be among the "teeming millions"). After the preparations are made, Dracula leaves the castle and abandons Harker to the brides. He barely escapes from the castle with his life. 

Not long afterward, a Russian ship, the ''Demeter'', having weighed anchor at [[Varna]], runs aground on the shores of [[Whitby]], England, during a fierce tempest. All of the crew are missing and presumed dead, and only one body is found, that of the captain tied to the ship's helm. The captain's [[Logbook|log]] is recovered and tells of strange events that had taken place during the ship's journey. These events led to the gradual disappearance of the entire crew apparently owing to a malevolent presence on board the ill-fated ship. An animal described as a large dog is seen on the ship leaping ashore. The ship's cargo is described as silver sand and boxes of "mould", or earth, from Transylvania.

Soon Dracula is tracking Harker's devoted fiancée, [[Mina Harker|Wilhelmina "Mina" Murray]], and her friend, [[Lucy Westenra]]. Lucy receives three marriage proposals in one day, from Dr. [[John Seward]]; [[Quincey Morris]]; and the Hon. [[Arthur Holmwood]] (later Lord Godalming). Lucy accepts Holmwood's proposal while turning down Seward and Morris, but all remain friends. Dracula has a notable encounter with Seward's patient [[Renfield]], an insane man who means to consume insects, spiders, birds, and other creatures &mdash; in ascending order of size &mdash; in order to absorb their "life force". Renfield acts as a motion sensor, detecting Dracula's proximity and supplying clues accordingly.

Lucy begins to waste away suspiciously. All of her suitors fret, and Seward calls in his old teacher, Professor [[Abraham Van Helsing]] from [[Amsterdam]]. Van Helsing immediately determines the cause of Lucy's condition but refuses to disclose it, knowing that Seward's faith in him will be shaken if he starts to speak of vampires. Van Helsing tries multiple [[blood transfusion]]s, but they are clearly losing ground. On a night when Van Helsing must return to Amsterdam (and his message to Seward asking him to watch the Westenra household is delayed), Lucy and her mother are attacked by a wolf. Mrs. Westenra, who has a heart condition, dies of fright, and Lucy apparently dies soon after.

Lucy is buried, but soon afterward the newspapers report children being stalked in the night by, in their words, a "bloofer lady" (i.e., "beautiful lady").<ref>[[Leonard Wolf]] (2004). ''The Essential Dracula'', Chapter 13, Note 31. "Bloofer lady" is explained as baby-talk for "beautiful lady".</ref> Van Helsing, knowing that this means Lucy has become a vampire, confides in Seward, Lord Godalming, and Morris. The suitors and Van Helsing track her down, and after a disturbing confrontation between her vampiric self and Arthur, they stake her heart, [[decapitation|behead]] her, and fill her mouth with garlic.

Around the same time, Jonathan Harker arrives home from recuperation in [[Budapest]] (where Mina joined and married him after his escape from the castle); he and Mina also join the coalition, who turn their attentions to dealing with Dracula.

After Dracula learns of Van Helsing's and the others' plot against him, he takes revenge by visiting – and feeding from – Mina at least three times. Dracula also feeds Mina his blood, creating a spiritual bond between them to control her. The only way to forestall this is to kill Dracula first. Mina slowly succumbs to the blood of the vampire that flows through her veins, switching back and forth from a state of consciousness to a state of semi-trance during which she is telepathically connected with Dracula. This telepathic connection is established to be two-way, in that the Count can influence Mina, but in doing so betrays to her awareness of his surroundings.

After the group sterilizes all of his lairs in London by putting pieces of consecrated host in each box of earth, Dracula flees back to his castle in Transylvania, transported in a box with transfer and portage instructions forwarded, pursued by Van Helsing's group, who themselves are aided by Van Helsing hypnotizing Mina and questioning her about the Count. The group splits in three directions. Van Helsing and Mina camp in the forest outside the Count's castle, where the vampire "sisters" appear and attempt to entice Mina to join them entirely. Van Helsing manages to drive them away, and during daylight, goes to the castle and kills them. Shortly afterwards all converge on the Count just at sundown under the shadow of the castle. Harker and Quincey rush to Dracula's box, which is being transported by [[Romani people|Gypsies]]. Harker shears Dracula through the throat with a [[Kukri]] while the mortally wounded Quincey, slashed by one of the crew, stabs the Count in the heart with a [[Bowie knife]]. Dracula crumbles to dust, and Mina is freed from his curse.

The book closes with a note about Mina's and Jonathan's married life and the birth of their first-born son, whom they name after all four members of the party, but refer to only as Quincey in remembrance of their American friend.

==Background==
Between 1879 and 1898, Stoker was a business manager for the world-famous [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in London, where he supplemented his income by writing a large number of sensational novels, his most famous being the vampire tale ''Dracula'' published on 26 May 1897.<ref name="Belford2002"/>{{rp|269}} Parts of it are set around the town of [[Whitby]], where he spent summer holidays. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, authors such as [[Henry Rider Haggard|H. Rider Haggard]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], and [[H. G. Wells]] wrote many tales in which fantastic creatures threatened the British Empire. [[Invasion literature]] was at a peak, and Stoker's formula of an invasion of England by continental European influences was by 1897 very familiar to readers of fantastic adventure stories. Victorian readers enjoyed it as a good adventure story like many others, but it would not reach its iconic legendary status until later in the 20th century when film versions began to appear.<ref>[[Nina Auerbach]] and [[David Skal]], editors. ''Dracula''. Norton Critical Edition. 1997. ISBN 0-393-97012-4. Preface, first paragraph.</ref> 
 
[[File:Henry Irving portrait.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Shakespearean actor and friend of Stoker's, [[Henry Irving|Sir Henry Irving]] was a possible real-life inspiration for the character of Dracula, the role was tailor-made to his dramatic presence, gentlemanly mannerisms and affinity for playing villain roles. Irving, however, never agreed to play the part on stage.]]

Before writing ''Dracula'', Stoker spent seven years researching European folklore and stories of vampires, being most influenced by [[Emily Gerard]]'s 1885 essay "Transylvania Superstitions". 

Despite being the most widely known vampire novel, ''Dracula'' was not the first. It was preceded and partly inspired by [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s 1871 "[[Carmilla]]", about a [[lesbian vampire]] who preys on a lonely young woman, and by ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'', a lengthy [[penny dreadful]] serial from the mid-Victorian period by [[James Malcolm Rymer]]. The image of a vampire portrayed as an aristocratic man, like the character of Dracula, was created by [[John Polidori]] in "[[The Vampyre]]" (1819), during the summer spent with ''[[Frankenstein]]'' creator [[Mary Shelley]], her husband, the poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and [[Lord Byron]] in 1816. The Lyceum Theatre, where Stoker worked between 1878 and 1898, was headed by the actor-manager [[Henry Irving]], who was Stoker's real-life inspiration for Dracula's mannerisms and who Stoker hoped would play Dracula in a stage version.<ref name="warren">Lewis S Warren, [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/107.4/ah0402001124.html''Buffalo Bill Meets Dracula: William F. Cody, Bram Stoker, and the Frontiers of Racial Decay''], [[American Historical Review]], Vol. 107, No. 4, October 2002, paragraph 18</ref> Although Irving never did agree to do a stage version, Dracula's dramatic sweeping gestures and gentlemanly mannerisms drew their living embodiment from Irving.<ref name="warren"/>

''The Dead Un-Dead'' was one of Stoker's original titles for ''Dracula'', and up until a few weeks before publication, the manuscript was titled simply ''The Un-Dead''. Stoker's notes for ''Dracula'' show that the name of the count was originally "Count Wampyr", but while doing research, Stoker became intrigued by the name "Dracula", after reading [[William Wilkinson (diplomat)|William Wilkinson]]'s book ''Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia with Political Observations Relative to Them'' (London 1820),<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=RogMAQAAMAAJ An account of the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia] - William Wilkinson, Longman, 1820 (Google Free eBook)</ref> which he found in the Whitby Library, and consulted a number of times during visits to Whitby in the 1890s.<ref>[[Radu R. Florescu]] and [[Raymond T. McNally]] ''Dracula, Prince of Many Faces''. Little Brown. 1989. ISBN 316286567. pp. 229-31.</ref> The name Dracula was the [[Patronymic|patronym]] (''Drăculea'') of the descendants of [[Vlad II Dracul|Vlad II]] of [[Wallachia]], who took the name "Dracul" after being invested in the [[Order of the Dragon]] in 1431. In the Romanian language, the word ''dracul'' (Romanian ''drac'' "dragon" + ''-ul'' "the") can mean either "the dragon" or, especially in the present day, "the devil".<ref>[[Raymond T. McNally]] and [[Radu R. Florescu]] ''In Search of Dracula, The History of Dracula and Vampires (Completely Revised)''. Houghton Mifflin. 1994. ISBN 0-395-65783-0. pp. 8-9.</ref> 

The novel has been in the [[public domain]] in the United States since its original publication because Stoker failed to follow proper copyright procedure. In the United Kingdom and other countries following the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] on copyrights, however, the novel was under copyright until April 1962, fifty years after Stoker's death.<ref>''Lugosi v. Universal Pictures'', 70 Cal.App.3d 552 (1977), note 4.</ref> When [[F. W. Murnau]]'s unauthorized film adaptation ''[[Nosferatu]]'' was released in 1922, the popularity of the novel increased considerably, owing to the controversy caused when Stoker's widow tried to have the film removed from public circulation.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/vampires/classicstory/dracula_p1.shtml —Article at the BBC Cult website.]</ref>

==Reaction and scholarly criticism==
[[File:Dracamer99.jpg|thumb|1899 first American edition, Doubleday & McClure, New York.]]
When it was first published, in 1897, ''Dracula'' was not an immediate [[bestseller]], although reviewers were unstinting in their praise. The contemporary ''[[Daily Mail]]'' ranked Stoker's powers above those of [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] as well as [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''.<ref>Cited in Paul Murray's "From the Shadow of Dracula: A Life of Bram Stoker" 2004. pp. 363-4.</ref>

According to literary historians [[Nina Auerbach]] and David Skal in the Norton Critical Edition, the novel has become more significant for modern readers than it was for contemporary Victorian readers, most of whom enjoyed it just as a good adventure story; it only reached its broad iconic legendary classic status later in the 20th century when the movie versions appeared.<ref>Nina Auerbach and David Skal, editors. ''Dracula''. Norton Critical Edition. 1997. ISBN 0-393-97012-4. Preface, first paragraph.</ref> It did not make much money for Stoker; the last year of his life he was so poor that he had to petition for a compassionate grant from the Royal Literary Fund,<ref>[http://www.todayinliterature.com/stories.asp?Event_Date=4/20/1912 Bram Stoker - Stoker, Irving & Count Vlad - Today in Literature]</ref> and in 1913 his widow was forced to sell his notes and outlines of the novel at a [[Sotheby’s]] auction, where they were purchased for a little over 2 pounds.<ref>[http://irishphiladelphia.com/2011/06/bram-stokers-dracula-by-gothic-candlelight/ Bram Stoker's “Dracula” by Gothic Candlelight]</ref> But when W. Murnau's unauthorized adaptation of the story in the form of ''[[Nosferatu]]'' was released in theatres in 1922, Stoker's widow took affaire, and during the legal battle that followed, the novel's popularity started to grow. ''Nosferatu'' was followed by a highly successful stage adaptation, touring the UK for three years before arriving in US where Stoker's creation caught Hollywood's attention, and after the American 1931 movie version was released, the book has never been out of print.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/vampires/classicstory/dracula_p1.shtml BBC - Cult Vampires - Extract from Dracula by Bram Stoker]</ref> However, some Victorian fans were ahead of the time, describing it as "the sensation of the season" and "the most blood-curdling novel of the paralysed century".<ref>Richard Dalby "Bram Stoker", in Jack Sullivan (ed) ''The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural'', 1986, Viking, pp. 404-6, 405.</ref> [[Sherlock Holmes]] author [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] wrote to Stoker in a letter, "I write to tell you how very much I have enjoyed reading ''Dracula''. I think it is the very best story of diablerie which I have read for many years."<ref>Klinger, page xxxii</ref> The ''Daily Mail'' review of 1 June 1897 proclaimed it a classic of [[Gothic horror]], "In seeking a parallel to this weird, powerful, and horrorful story our mind reverts to such tales as ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'', ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]'' ... but Dracula is even more appalling in its gloomy fascination than any one of these."<ref>Cited in Nina Auerbach and David Skal, editors, ''Dracula'', Norton Critical Edition, 1997, pp. 363-4.</ref>

Similarly good reviews appeared when the book was published in the U.S. in 1899. The first American edition was published by Doubleday and McClure in New York.

In the last several decades, literary and cultural scholars have offered diverse analyses of Stoker's novel and the character of Count Dracula.  C.F. Bentley reads Dracula as an embodiment of the Freudian id.<ref>C.F. Bentley’s. ''The Monster in the Bedroom: Sexual Symbolism in Bram Stoker’s Dracula''</ref> Carol A. Senf reads the novel as a response to the powerful New Woman.<ref>Senf, Carol A. ''The Vampire in Nineteenth-Century English Literature''.

''"Kiss Me with Those Red Lips": Gender and Inversion in Bram Stoker's Dracula''</ref> Stephen D. Arata interprets the events of the novel as anxiety over colonialism and racial mixing,<ref>Arata, Stephen D.

==Historical and geographical references==
Although ''Dracula'' is a work of fiction, it does contain some historical references. The historical connections with the novel and how much Stoker knew about the history are a matter of conjecture and debate.

Following the publication of ''In Search of Dracula'' by [[Radu Florescu]] and Raymond McNally in 1972, the supposed connections between the historical [[Transylvania]]n-born [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad III Dracula]] of [[Wallachia]] and Bram Stoker's fictional Dracula attracted popular attention. During his main reign (1456–1462), "Vlad the Impaler" is said to have killed from 40,000 to 100,000 European civilians (political rivals, criminals and anyone else he considered "useless to humanity"), mainly by using his favourite method of impaling them on a sharp pole. The main sources dealing with these events are records by [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] settlers in neighbouring Transylvania, who had frequent clashes with Vlad III. Vlad III is revered as a folk hero by [[Romanians]] for driving off the invading Turks. His [[impalement|impaled]] victims are said to have included as many as 100,000 [[Ottoman Turks]].<ref name=Andreescu>{{cite book|title = Vlad the Impaler (Dracula)|author = Andreescu, Stefan|year = 1999|publisher = The Romanian Cultural Foundation Publishing House|isbn = 973-577-197-7}}</ref>

[[File:Vlad Tepes 002.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Vlad the Impaler]]; also known as Vlad Dracula.]]

Historically, the name "Dracula" is derived from a [[Chivalric order]] called the [[Order of the Dragon]], founded by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]] (then king of [[Hungary]], later also [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) to uphold [[Christianity]] and defend the Empire against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]]. [[Vlad II Dracul]], father of Vlad III, was admitted to the order around 1431 because of his bravery in fighting the Turks. From 1431 onward, Vlad II wore the emblem of the order and later, as ruler of Wallachia, his [[coin]]age bore the dragon symbol. The name Dracula means "Son of Dracul".

Stoker came across the name Dracula in his reading on [[History of Romania|Romanian history]], and chose this to replace the name (''Count Wampyr'') that he had originally intended to use for his villain. However, some Dracula scholars, led by [[Elizabeth Miller (academic)|Elizabeth Miller]], have questioned the depth of this connection. They argue that Stoker in fact knew little of the historic Vlad III except for the name "Dracula". There are sections in the novel where Dracula refers to his own background, and these speeches show that Stoker had some knowledge of Romanian history. Stoker mentions the Dracula who fought against the Turks, and was later betrayed by his brother, historical facts which unequivocally point to Vlad III: 

{{quote|Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! (Chapter 3, pp 19)}}

The Count's intended identity is later speculated on by Professor Van Helsing: 

{{quote|He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey-land. (Chapter 18, pp 145)}}

The Dracula legend as he created it, and as it has been portrayed in films and television shows, may be a compound of various influences. Many of Stoker's biographers and literary critics have found strong similarities to the earlier Irish writer [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s classic of the vampire genre, ''[[Carmilla]]''. In writing ''Dracula'', Stoker may also have drawn on stories about the [[Aos Sí|sídhe]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} some of which feature blood-drinking women. The folkloric figure of [[Abhartach]] has also been suggested as a source.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In 1983, McNally additionally suggested that Stoker was influenced by the history of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] Countess [[Elizabeth Bathory]], who tortured and killed between 36 and 700 young women over a period of many years.<ref>McNally, Raymund. ''Dracula was a Woman''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1983</ref> It was later commonly believed that she committed these crimes in order to bathe in their blood, believing that this preserved her youth.<ref>[http://bathory.org/miller02.html Báthory Erzsébet - Elizabeth Bathory: Bram Stoker, Elizabeth Bathory, and Dracula (Elizabeth Miller)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In her book ''The Essential Dracula'', Clare Haword-Maden opined the castle of Count Dracula was inspired by [[New Slains Castle|Slains Castle]], at which Bram Stoker was a guest of the 19th [[Earl of Erroll]].<ref>Haword-Maden, Clare. ''The Essential Dracula''. London: Bison Books, 1992</ref> According to Miller, he first visited Cruden Bay in 1893, three years after work on ''Dracula'' had begun. Haining and Tremaine maintain that during this visit, Stoker was especially impressed by Slains Castle's interior and the surrounding landscape. Miller and Leatherdale question the stringency of this connection.<ref>Haining, Peter and Tremayne, Peter. The Un-Dead: The Legend of Bram Stoker and Dracila. London: Constable 1997, quoted by Miller, Elizabeth. Dracula - Sense & Nonsense, 2nd ed. Westcliff-on-Sea, UK: Desert Island Books, 2006, p. 19. See also Leatherdale, Clive. Dracula Unearthed. Westcliff-on-Sea, UK: Desert Island Books, 1998, p. 13</ref> Possibly, Stoker was not inspired by a real edifice at all, but by Jules Vernes's novel ''The Castle of the Carpathians'' or Anne Radcliffe's ''The Mysteries of Udolpho'' (1794).<ref>Elizabeth Miller, ''Dracula: Sense & Nonsense''. 2nd ed. Westcliff-on-Sea, UK: Desert Island Books, 2006, p. 141</ref> A third possibility is that he copied information about a castle at Vécs from one of his sources on Transylvania, the book by Major E.C. Johnson.<ref>Major E.C. Johnson, ''On the Track of the Crescent: Erratic Notes from the Piraeus to Pesth.'' London: Hurst and Blackett, 1885. p. 256-257, quoted by Marius Crișan, ''The Models for Castle Dracula in Stoker’s Sources on Transylvania'', Journal of Dracula Studies Nr 10 (2008); also referred to by Miller, 2006, p. 141</ref> A further option is that Stoker saw an illustration of Castle Bran (Törzburg) in the book on Transylvania by Charles Boner, or read about it in the books by Mazuchelli or Crosse.<ref>Charles Boner, ''Transylvania: Its Product and Its People.'' London: Longmans, 1865. Referred to by Marius Crișan, ''The Models for Castle Dracula in Stoker’s Sources on Transylvania'', Journal of Dracula Studies Nr 10 (2008). As indicated by Crişan, Crosse's book . ''Round About the Carpathians'' and Mazuchelli's ''Magyarland'' describe Törzburg as well.</ref> 
Many of the scenes in [[Whitby]] and London are based on real places that Stoker frequently visited, although in some cases he distorts the geography for the sake of the story.

Daniel Farson, Leonard Wolf and Peter Haining have suggested that Stoker received much historical information from [[Ármin Vámbéry]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] professor he met at least twice. Miller argues "there is nothing to indicate that the conversation included Vlad, vampires, or even Transylvania" and that, "furthermore, there is no record of any other correspondence between Stoker and Vámbéry, nor is Vámbéry mentioned in Stoker's notes for Dracula."<ref>Elizabeth Miller, [http://www.blooferland.com/drc/images/Divorce.rtf Filing for Divorce Count Dracula vs Vlad Tepes] Dracula: The Shade and the Shadow, ed.

[[File:Bela Lugosi as Dracula, anonymous photograph from 1931, Universal Studios.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]] (1931)]]
The story of ''Dracula'' has been the basis for numerous films and plays. Stoker himself wrote the first theatrical adaptation, which was presented at the Lyceum Theatre under the title ''Dracula, or The Undead'' shortly before the novel's publication and performed only once. Popular films include ''[[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]]'' (1931), ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (alternative title: ''The Horror of Dracula'') (1958), and ''[[Dracula (1992 film)|Dracula]]'' (also known as ''Bram Stoker's Dracula'') (1992). ''Dracula'' was also adapted as ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922), a film directed by the German director [[F. W. Murnau]], without permission from Stoker's widow; the filmmakers attempted to avoid copyright problems by altering many of the details, including changing the name of the villain to "[[Count Orlok]]".

The character of Count Dracula has remained popular over the years, and many films have used the character as a villain, while others have named him in their titles, including ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'', ''[[The Brides of Dracula]]'', and ''[[Zoltan, Hound of Dracula (film)|Zoltan, Hound of Dracula]]''. As of 2009, an estimated 217 films feature Dracula in a major role,<ref>{{imdb character|0002561|Count Dracula}}</ref> a number second only to [[Sherlock Holmes]] (223 films).<ref>{{imdb character|0026631|Sherlock Holmes}}</ref>

Most adaptations do not include all the major characters from the novel. The Count is always present, and [[Jonathan Harker|Jonathan]] and [[Mina Harker]], [[John Seward|Dr. Seward]], [[Abraham Van Helsing|Dr. Van Helsing]], and [[Renfield]] usually appear as well. The characters of Mina and Lucy are often combined into a single female role. Jonathan Harker and Renfield are also sometimes reversed or combined. [[Quincey Morris]] and [[Arthur Holmwood]] are usually omitted entirely (''[[Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' being a notable exception).

=="Dracula's Guest"==
In 1914, two years after Stoker's death, the short story "[[Dracula's Guest]]" was posthumously published. It was, according to most contemporary critics, the deleted first (or second) chapter from the original manuscript<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0313292159&id=As8cClbbGqgC&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=%22dracula%27s+guest%22&ie=ISO-8859-1|author=James Craig Holte |page=27 |title=''Dracula Film Adaptations'' |accessdate=2010-06-04}}</ref> and the one which gave the volume its name,<ref name="Belford2002">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0306810980&id=hfzy5UPjAr0C |author=Barbara Belford |title=Bram Stoker and the Man Who Was Dracula |isbn=0-306-81098-0 |year=2002|accessdate=2010-06-04}}</ref>{{rp|325}} but which the original publishers deemed unnecessary to the overall story.

"Dracula's Guest" follows an unnamed Englishman traveller as he wanders around [[Munich]] before leaving for Transylvania. It is [[Walpurgis Night]], and in spite of the coachman's warnings, the young Englishman foolishly leaves his hotel and wanders through a dense forest alone. Along the way he feels he is being watched by a tall and thin stranger (possibly Count Dracula).

The short story climaxes in an old graveyard, where in a marble tomb (with a large iron stake driven into it), the Englishman encounters a sleeping female vampire called ''Countess Dolingen''. This malevolent and beautiful vampire awakens from her marble [[bier]] to conjure a snowstorm before being struck by lightning and returning to her eternal prison. However, the Englishman's troubles are not quite over, as he is dragged away by an unseen force and rendered unconscious. He awakes to find a "gigantic" wolf lying on his chest and licking at his throat; however, the wolf merely keeps him warm and protects him until help arrives.

When the Englishman is finally taken back to his hotel, a telegram awaits him from his expectant host Dracula, with a warning about "dangers from snow and wolves and night".
