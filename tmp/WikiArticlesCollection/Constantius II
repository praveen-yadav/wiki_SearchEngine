'''Constantius II''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Julius Constantius Augustus}};<ref>In [[Classical Latin]], Constantius' name would be inscribed as FLAVIVS IVLIVS CONSTANTIVS AVGVSTVS.</ref><ref>CIL 06, 40776 = AE 1934, 00158 = AE 1950, 00174 = AE 1951, 00102 = AE 1982, 00011</ref> 7 August 317 – 3 November 361) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 337 to 361. The second son of [[Constantine I]] and [[Fausta]], he ascended to the throne with his brothers [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]] and [[Constans]] upon their father's death.

In 340, Constantius' brothers clashed over the western provinces of the empire. The resulting conflict left Constantine II dead and Constans as ruler of the west until he was overthrown and assassinated in 350 by the [[usurper]] [[Magnentius]]. Unwilling to accept Magnentius as co-ruler, Constantius defeated him at the battles of [[Battle of Mursa Major|Mursa Major]] and [[Battle of Mons Seleucus|Mons Seleucus]].  Magnentius committed suicide after the latter, leaving Constantius as sole ruler of the empire.

His subsequent military campaigns against Germanic tribes were successful: he defeated the [[Alamanni]] in 354 and campaigned across the [[Danube]] against the [[Quadi]] and [[Sarmatians]] in 357. In contrast, the war in the east against the [[Sassanids]] continued with mixed results.

In 351, due to the difficulty of managing the empire alone, Constantius elevated his cousin [[Constantius Gallus]] to the subordinate rank of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', but had him executed three years later after receiving scathing reports of his violent and corrupt nature. Shortly thereafter, in 355, Constantius promoted his last surviving cousin, Gallus' younger half-brother, [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], to the rank of ''Caesar''.

However, Julian claimed the rank of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] in 360, leading to war between the two. Ultimately, no battle was fought as Constantius became ill and died late in 361, though not before naming his opponent as his successor.

Constantius was born in 317 at [[Sirmium]], [[Pannonia]]. He was the third son of [[Constantine the Great]], and second by his second wife [[Fausta]], the daughter of [[Maximian]]. Constantius was made [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] by his father on 13 November 324.<ref>DiMaio Jr., M. & Frakes, R.

In 336, religious unrest in [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] and tense relations between Constantine and king [[Shapur II]] caused war to break out between Rome and [[Sassanid Persia]].<ref name="Dodgeon, M.H p152-153">Dodgeon, M.H. and Lieu, N.C.

In early 337, Constantius hurried to [[Constantinople]] after receiving news that his father was near death.<ref>''Chronicon Paschale'' p.533, 5–17</ref> After Constantine died, Constantius buried him  with lavish ceremony in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].<ref>Julian, ''or''.

The massacre left Constantius, his older brother [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], his younger brother [[Constans]], and three cousins [[Constantius Gallus|Gallus]], [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] and [[Nepotianus]] as the only surviving male relatives of Constantine the Great. Soon after, Constantius met his brothers in [[Pannonia]] at [[Sirmium]] to formalize the partition of the empire.<ref>Odahl, C.M., ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'' (2004), p. 275</ref> Constantius received the eastern provinces, including Constantinople, [[Roman Thrace|Thrace]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Cyrenaica]]; Constantine received [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], [[Hispania]], and [[Mauretania Tingitana|Mauretania]]; and Constans, initially under the supervision of Constantine II, received [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italy]], [[Africa Province|Africa]], [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], [[Pannonia]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], and [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]].<ref>[[Zosimus]], ''New History'' II.57</ref>

Constantius then hurried east to [[Antioch]] to resume the war with Persia.<ref>Theodoret, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' II, 30, 1–14, GCS</ref> While Constantius was away from the eastern frontier in early 337, Shapur assembled a large army, including war elephants, and launched an attack on Roman territory, laying waste to Mesopotamia<ref>Jerome, ''Chronicon, s. a.'' 338 p. 234, 17–18</ref> and putting Nisibis under siege.<ref>Theodoret, ''Historia religiosa'' I, 11–12, edd.

Constantius repeatedly defended the eastern border against invasions by the aggressive [[Sassanid Empire]] under king [[Shapur II]]. These conflicts were mainly limited to Sassanid sieges of the major fortresses of [[Roman Mesopotamia]], including [[Nisibis]] ([[Nusaybin]]), [[Singara]], and [[Diyarbakir|Amida]] ([[Diyarbakir]]). Although Shapur seems to have been victorious in most of these confrontations, the Sassanids were able to achieve little.<ref name="ReferenceB">[[Festus (historian)|Festus]], ''Brevarium'' XXVII</ref><ref name="Dignas, B. 2007 p. 89">Dignas, B. & Winter, E., ''Rome and Persia in Late Antiquity'' (2007), p. 89</ref> However, the Romans won a decisive victory at the Battle of Narasara, killing Shapur's brother, Narses.<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref>[[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]], ''Chronicle'' A.M. 5815</ref> Ultimately, Constantius was able to push back the invasion, and Shapur failed to make any significant gains.<ref name="Dignas, B. 2007 p. 89"/>

Meanwhile, Constantine II desired to retain control of Constans' realm, leading the brothers into open conflict. Constantine was killed in 340 near [[Aquileia]] during an ambush.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> As a result, Constans took control of his deceased brother’s realms and became sole ruler of the Western two-thirds of the empire. This division lasted until 350, when Constans was assassinated by forces loyal to the [[Roman usurper|usurper]] [[Magnentius]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>[[Zosimus]] ''New History'' II.58-9</ref>

===War against Magnentius===
[[File:Bronze coin of Contantius II 337 361 found in Karghalik.jpg|thumb|Bronze coin of Constantius II (337–361), found in [[Karghalik]], modern [[China]].]]

As the only surviving son of [[Constantine the Great]], Constantius felt that the position of [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] was his alone,<ref name="Zosimus, New History II.60">Zosimus, ''New History'' II.60</ref> and he determined to march west to fight the usurper, [[Magnentius]]. However, feeling that the east still required some sort of imperial presence, he elevated his cousin [[Constantius Gallus]] to Caesar of the eastern provinces. As an extra measure to ensure the loyalty of his cousin, he married the elder of his two sisters, [[Constantina]], to him.<ref name="Zosimus, New History II.60"/>

Before facing Magnentius, Constantius first came to terms with [[Vetranio]], a loyal general in [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] who had recently been acclaimed emperor by his soldiers. Vetranio immediately sent letters to Constantius pledging his loyalty, which Constantius may have accepted simply in order to stop Magnentius from gaining more support. These events may have been spurred by the action of Constantina, who had since traveled east to marry Gallus. Constantius subsequently sent Vetranio the imperial diadem and acknowledged the general‘s new position as ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]''. However, when Constantius arrived, Vetranio willingly resigned his position and accepted Constantius’ offer of a comfortable retirement in [[Bithynia]].<ref>Zosimus, ''New History'' II.59</ref>

[[Image:Double Centenionalis Magnentius-XR-s4017.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The defeat of [[Magnentius]] in 353 left Constantius as sole [[Roman Emperor]].]]

In 351, Constantius clashed with Magnentius in [[Pannonia]] with a large army. The ensuing [[Battle of Mursa Major]] was one of the largest and bloodiest battles ever between two Roman armies.<ref>[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XIII.8.5–13</ref><ref>[[Julian the Apostate]], ''The Caesars'' XLII.9–10</ref><ref>[[Zosimus]], ''New History'' II.46.2</ref><ref>[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Roman History'' X.12</ref> The result was a victory for Constantius, but a costly one. Magnentius survived the battle and, determined to fight on, withdrew into northern Italy. Rather than pursuing his opponent, however, Constantius turned his attention to securing the Danubian border, where he spent the early months of 352 campaigning against the [[Sarmatians]] along the middle [[Danube]]. After achieving his aims, Constantius advanced on Magnentius in Italy. This action led the cities of Italy to switch their allegiance to him and eject the usurper's garrisons. Again, Magnentius withdrew, this time to southern [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]].<ref name="Potter, D.S. 2004 p. 474">Potter, D.S., ''The Roman Empire at Bay: AD 180–395'' (2004), p. 474</ref>

In 353, Constantius and Magnentius met for the final time at the [[Battle of Mons Seleucus]] in southern Gaul, and again Constantius emerged the victor.<ref name="Potter, D.S. 2004 p. 474"/> Magnentius, realizing the futility of continuing his position, committed suicide on 10 August 353.<ref>[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Historiae Romanae Breviarium'' X.12</ref>

==Sole ruler of the empire==
Constantius spent much of the rest of 353 and early 354 on campaign against the [[Alamanni]] on the Danube frontier. The campaign was successful and raiding by the Alamanni ceased temporarily. In the meantime, Constantius had been receiving disturbing reports regarding the actions of his cousin Gallus.<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' 14.1.10</ref> Possibly as a result of these reports, Constantius concluded a peace with the Alamanni and traveled to [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]).<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.10.16</ref>

[[Image:Solidus-Constantius Gallus-thessalonica RIC 149.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Constantius Gallus was a paternal cousin of Constantius. In 350, he was made [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] by Constantius and was married to the Emperor's sister, [[Constantina]]. However, his mismanagement of the eastern provinces led to his downfall and death in 354.]]

In Mediolanum, Constantius first summoned [[Ursicinus (Roman general)|Ursicinus]], Gallus’ ''magister equitum'', for reasons that remain unclear.<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.3–5</ref> Constantius then summoned Gallus and Constantina.<ref name="ReferenceC">[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.6</ref> Although Gallus and Constantina complied with the order at first, when Constantina died in [[Bithynia]],<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Gallus began to hesitate. However, after some convincing by one of Constantius’ agents,<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.11–12</ref> Gallus continued his journey west, passing through [[Constantinople]] and [[Thracia (Roman province)|Thrace]] to [[Poetovio]] ([[Ptuj]]) in [[Pannonia]].<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.19</ref><ref name="roman-emperors.org">[http://www.roman-emperors.org/gallus.htm Banchich, T.M., 'DIR-Gallus' from De Imperatoribus Romanis]</ref>

In Poetovio, Gallus was arrested by the soldiers of Constantius under the command of [[Barbatio]].<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.20</ref> Gallus was then moved to [[Pula|Pola]] and interrogated. Gallus claimed that it was Constantina who was to blame for all the trouble while he was in charge of the eastern provinces.<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.22</ref> This angered Constantius so greatly that he immediately ordered Gallus' execution.<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.23</ref> He soon changed his mind, however, and recanted the order.<ref>[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XIII.9.20</ref><ref>[[Libanius]], ''Orations'' XVIII.152</ref> Unfortunately for Gallus, this second order was delayed by [[Eusebius (praepositus sacri cubiculi)|Eusebius]], one of Constantius' eunuchs, and Gallus was executed.<ref name="roman-emperors.org"/>

===More usurpers and Julian===
On 11 August 355, the [[magister militum]] [[Claudius Silvanus]] revolted in Gaul. Silvanus had surrendered to Constantius after the [[Battle of Mursa Major]]. Constantius had made him magister militum in 353 with the purpose of blocking the German threats, a feat that Silvanus achieved by bribing the German tribes with the money he had collected. A plot organized by members of Constantius' court led the emperor to recall Silvanus. After Silvanus revolted, he received a letter from Constantius recalling him to Milan, but which made no reference to the revolt. [[Ursicinus (Roman general)|Ursicinus]], who was meant to replace Silvanus, bribed some troops, and Silvanus was killed.

Constantius realised that too many threats still faced the Empire, however, and he could not possibly handle all of them by himself. So on 6 November 355,<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.17</ref> he elevated his last remaining relative, [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], to the rank of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]].<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.5–16</ref> A few days later, Julian was married to [[Helena, wife of Julian|Helena]], the last surviving sister of Constantius.<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.18</ref> Constantius soon sent Julian off to Gaul.<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.18</ref>

[[File:07 constantius2Chrono354.png|thumb|right|300px|Constantius II depicted in the [[Chronography of 354]] dispensing largesse (a [[Renaissance]] copy of a [[Carolingian]] copy).]]

Constantius spent the next few years overseeing affairs in the western part of the empire primarily from his base at Mediolanum. In 357 he visited [[Rome]] for the first and only time in his life. The same year, he forced [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] and [[Quadi]] invaders out of Pannonia and [[Moesia|Moesia Inferior]], then led a successful counter-attack across the Danube.<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVI.12</ref>

In the winter of 357–58, Constantius received ambassadors from [[Shapur II]] who demanded that Rome restore the lands surrendered by [[Narseh]].<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVII.5.3–8</ref><ref>[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XII.9.25-7</ref> Despite rejecting these terms,<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVII.5.9–14</ref><ref>[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XII.9.28-9</ref> Constantius tried to avert war with the [[Sassanid Empire]] by sending two embassies to Shapur II.<ref>[[Libanius]], ''Epistle'' 331</ref><ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVII.14.1–3 & XVIII.6.17-8</ref><ref>[[Eunapius]], ''Lives of the Sophists'' VI. 5.1–10</ref> Shapur II nevertheless launched another invasion of Roman Mesopotamia. In 360, when news reached Constantius that Shapur II had destroyed [[Singara]],<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.6</ref> and taken [[Hasankeyf|Kiphas]] ([[Hasankeyf]]), [[Diyarbakır|Amida]],<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIX</ref> and [[Cizre|Ad Tigris]] ([[Cizre]]),<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.7.1–16</ref> he decided to travel east to face the re-emergent threat.

===Usurpation of Julian and crises in the east===
In the meantime, Julian had won some victories against the [[Alamanni]], who had once again invaded [[Roman Gaul]]. However, when Constantius requested reinforcements from Julian’s army for the eastern campaign, the Gallic legions revolted and proclaimed Julian ''Augustus''.<ref>[[Julian the Apostate]], ''Letter To The Senate And People of Athens'', X.12–17</ref><ref>[[Libanius]], ''Orations'' XII.58 & XVIII.90-1</ref><ref>[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Historiae Romanae Breviarium'' X.15.1</ref><ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.4.1–2</ref>

However, on account of the immediate Sassanid threat, Constantius was unable to directly respond to his cousin’s usurpation, other than by sending missives in which he tried to convince Julian to resign the title of ''Augustus'' and be satisfied with that of ''Caesar''. By 361, Constantius saw no alternative but to face the usurper with force; and yet the threat of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] remained. Constantius had already spent part of early 361 unsuccessfully attempting to re-take the fortress of Ad Tigris.<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.11.6–25</ref> After a time he had withdrawn to [[Antioch]] to regroup and prepare for a confrontation with [[Shapur II]].<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XXI.7.7 & 13.1–5</ref> The campaigns of the previous year had inflicted heavy losses on the Sassanids, however, and they did not attempt another round of campaigns that year. This temporary respite in hostilities allowed Constantius to turn his full attention to facing Julian.<ref name="Vagi, D.L. 2001 p. 508">Vagi, D.L. & Coquand, T., ''Coinage and History of the Roman Empire'' (2001), p. 508</ref>

==Death==
[[Image:Byzantine - Belt Section with Medallions of Constantius II and Faustina - Walters 57527 - Back.jpg|left|thumb|This section of a belt contains two gold medallions.  The larger coin depicts the triumphant emperor in his chariot.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]
 |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/#
 |title= Belt Section with Medallions of Constantius II and Faustina}}</ref> The Walters Art Museum.]]
Constantius immediately gathered his forces and set off west. However, by the time he reached [[Mopsuestia]] in Cilicia, it was clear that he was fatally ill and would not survive to face Julian. Apparently, realising his death was near, Constantius had himself baptised by [[Arianism|Euzoius]], the [[Semi-Arianism|Semi-Arian]] bishop of [[Antioch]], and then declared that Julian was his rightful successor.<ref name="Vagi, D.L. 2001 p. 508"/> Constantius II died of fever on 3 November 361.<ref>The manuscript of Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' 21.15.2 reads ''tertium nonarum Octobrium'', which is the equivalent of 5 October. The latest editor of the ''Res Gestae'' accepts Otto Seeck's emendation ''tertium nonarum Novembrium'' which is the equivalent of 3 November. T.D. Barnes (''Classical Philology'', 88 [1993], p. 64f) provides indirect evidence showing 3 November is a better fit.</ref>

==Marriages and children==
Constantius II was married three times:

First to a [[Daughter of Julius Constantius|daughter]] of his half-uncle [[Julius Constantius]], whose name is unknown. She was a full-sister of Gallus and a half-sister of Julian. She died c. 352/3.

Second, to Eusebia, a woman of [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] originally from the city of [[Thessaloniki]], whom Constantius married before his defeat of Magnentius in 353. She died in 360.

Third and lastly, in 360, to [[Faustina (empress)|Faustina]], who gave birth to Constantius' only child, a posthumous daughter named [[Flavia Maxima Constantia]], who later married Emperor [[Gratian]].

==Religious issues==
Constantius seems to have had a particular interest in the religious state of the [[Roman Empire]]. As a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Roman Emperor]], Constantius made a concerted effort to promote [[Christianity]] at the expense of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman polytheism]] (‘paganism’). He issued a number of edicts designed to carry out this agenda (see below). Constantius also took an active part in attempting to shape the [[Christianity|Christian]] church.

===Paganism===
In spite of the some of the edicts issued by Constantius, he was not fanatically anti-pagan – he never made any attempt to disband the various Roman priestly colleges or the [[Vestal Virgin]]s,<ref name="Vasiliev, A.A 1958 p. 68">Vasiliev, A.A, ''History of the Byzantine Empire 324–1453'' (1958), p. 68</ref> he never acted against the various pagan schools, and, at times, he actually made some effort to protect paganism. In fact, he even ordered the election of a priest for Africa.<ref name="Vasiliev, A.A 1958 p. 68"/> Also, he remained [[pontifex maximus]] and was deified by the Roman Senate after his death. His relative moderation toward paganism is reflected by the fact that it was over twenty years after his death, during the reign of [[Gratian]], that any pagan senator protested his treatment of their religion.<ref>Salzman, M.R., ''The Making of a Christian Aristocracy: Social and Religious Change in the Western Roman Empire'' (2002), p. 182</ref>

'''Pagan-related edicts''' issued by Constantius (by himself or with others) included:
* The banning of sacrifices;<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.10.2 & 16.10.6</ref>
* The closing of pagan temples;<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.10.4 & 16.10.6</ref>
* Edicts against soothsayers and magicians.<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 9.16.4, 9.16.5 & 9.16.6</ref>

===Christianity===
Although often considered an [[Arianism|Arian]],<ref>Jones, A.H.M, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: a Social, Economic and Administrative Survey'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1986), p. 118</ref> Constantius ultimately preferred a third, compromise version that lay somewhere in between [[Arianism]] and the [[Nicene Creed]], retrospectively called [[Semi-Arianism]].<ref>Pelikan, J.J., ''The Christian Tradition'' (1989), pp. 209–10</ref><ref>Gaddis, M., ''There is No Crime for Those who Have Christ'' (2005), p. 92</ref> During his reign he attempted to mold the Christian church to follow this compromise position, convening several Christian councils. The most notable of these were the [[Council of Rimini]] and its twin at [[Silifke|Seleuca]], which met in 359 and 360 respectively. "Unfortunately for his memory the theologians whose advice he took were ultimately discredited and the malcontents whom he pressed to conform emerged victorious," writes the historian [[A.H.M. Jones]]. "The great councils of 359–60 are therefore not reckoned [[Ecumenical council|ecumenical]] in the tradition of the church, and Constantius II is not remembered as a restorer of unity, but as a [[Arianism|heretic]] who arbitrarily imposed his will on the church."<ref name="Jones, A.H.M 1986 p. 118">Jones, A.H.M, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: a Social, Economic and Administrative Survey'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1986), p. 118.</ref>

'''Christian-related edicts''' issued by Constantius (by himself or with others) included:
* Exemption from compulsory public service for the clergy;<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.9</ref>
* Exemption from compulsory public service for the sons of clergy;<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.11</ref>
* Tax exemptions for clergy and their servants,<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.8</ref> and later for their family;<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.14</ref>
* Clergy and the issue of private property;<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.15, 12.1.49 & 8.4.7</ref>
* Bishops exempted from being tried in secular courts;<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.12</ref>
* Christian prostitutes only able to be bought by Christians.<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 15.8.1</ref>

===Judaism===
Judaism faced some severe restrictions under Constantius, who seems to have followed an anti-Jewish policy in line with that of his father.<ref name="Schäfer, P. 2003 pp. 180-1">Schäfer, P., ''The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World'' (2003), pp. 180–1</ref> Early in his reign, Constantius issued a double edict in concert with his brothers limiting the ownership of slaves by Jewish people<ref name="Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2">[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.9.2</ref> and banning marriages between Jews and Christian women.<ref name="Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2"/> A later edict issued by Constantius after becoming sole emperor decreed that a person who was proven to have converted from Christianity to Judaism would have all of his property confiscated by the state.<ref name="Codex Theodosianus 16.8.7">[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.8.7</ref> However, Constantius' actions in this regard may not have been so much to do with Jewish religion as with Jewish business—apparently, privately owned Jewish businesses were often in competition with state-owned businesses. As a result, Constantius may have sought to provide an advantage to state-owned businesses by limiting the skilled workers and slaves available to Jewish businesses.<ref name="Schäfer, P. 2003 pp. 180-1"/>

'''Jew-related edicts''' issued by Constantius (by himself or with others) included:
* Weaving women who moved from working for the government to working for Jews, must be restored to the government; Jews may not marry Christian women; Jews may not attempt to convert Christian women;<ref name="Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2"/>
* Any non-Jewish slave bought by a Jew will be confiscated by the state; if a Jew attempts to circumcise a non-Jewish slave, the slave will be freed and the Jew shall face capital punishment; any Christian slaves owned by a Jew will be taken away and freed;<ref name="Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2"/>
* A person who is proven to have converted from Christianity to Judaism shall have their property confiscated by the state.<ref name="Codex Theodosianus 16.8.7"/>

==Reputation==
Constantius II is a particularly difficult figure to judge properly due to the hostility of most sources toward him. A.H.M Jones writes that Constantius "appears in the pages of [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] as a conscientious emperor but a vain and stupid man, an easy prey to flatterers. He was timid and suspicious, and interested persons could easily play on his fears for their own advantage."<ref>Jones, A.H.M., ''Later Roman Empire'', p. 116.</ref> However, Kent & M. and A. Hirmer suggest that Constantius "has suffered at the hands of unsympathetic authors, ecclesiastical and civil alike. To orthodox churchmen he was a bigoted supporter of the Arian heresy, to [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]] and the many who have subsequently taken his part he was a murderer, a tyrant and inept as a ruler".<ref name="Kent, J.P.C. 1978 p. 54">Kent, J.P.C., Hirmer, M. & Hirmer, A. ''Roman Coins'' (1978), p. 54</ref> They go on to add, "Most contemporaries seem in fact to have held him in high esteem, and he certainly inspired loyalty in a way his brother could not".<ref name="Kent, J.P.C. 1978 p. 54"/> In the military sphere, the campaigns of Constantius and his subordinates on the Rhine and Danube frontiers in the late 350s restored stability to those regions after the troubles caused by Magnentius' revolt.
