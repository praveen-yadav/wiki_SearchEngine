'''Anaïs Nin''' ({{IPA-es|anaˈis ˈnin|lang}}; born '''Angela Anaïs Juana Antolina Rosa Edelmira Nin y Culmell''', February 21, 1903 – January 14, 1977) was an American author born to Spanish-Cuban parents in France, where she was also raised.  She spent some time in Spain and Cuba but lived most of her life in the United States where she became an established author.  She published [[diary|journal]]s (which span more than 60 years, beginning when she was 11 years old and ending shortly before her death), [[novel]]s, critical studies, [[essay]]s, [[short story|short stories]], and [[erotic literature|erotica]]. A great deal of her work, including ''[[Delta of Venus]]'' and ''[[Little Birds]]'', was published posthumously.

==Early life==
Anaïs Nin was born in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine|Neuilly]], [[France]], to artistic parents. Her father, [[Joaquín Nin]], was a Spanish-Cuban pianist and composer, when he met her mother Rosa Culmell,<ref name="kir">{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/anaisnin.htm |title=Anaïs Nin: 1903–1977|publisher=Kirjasto.sci.fi|year=2008|accessdate=2011-02-15|author=Liukkonen, Petri}}</ref> a classically trained singer of [[French people|French]] and [[Danes|Danish]] descent who was working in Cuba.<ref>[http://www.morbidoutlook.com/nonfiction/articles/2001_03_anaisnin.html The Unique Anaïs Nin]"</ref> Her father's grandfather had fled France during the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], going first to [[Saint-Domingue]], then [[New Orleans]], and finally to Cuba where he helped build that country's first railway.<ref>''Diaries, Volume 1, 1931–1934''</ref>

Nin was raised a [[Roman Catholic]]<ref>{{cite book|title=A Spy In The House Of Love (Foreword)|author=Stuhlmann, Gunther|page=3|publisher=Swallow Press}}</ref> and spent her childhood and early life in Europe. After her parents separated, her mother moved Anaïs and her two brothers, Thorvald Nin and [[Joaquin Nin-Culmell]], to [[Barcelona]], and then to [[New York City]]. According to her diaries, ''Volume One, 1931–1934'', Nin abandoned formal schooling at the age of sixteen years and later began working as an artist's [[model (person)|model]]. After being in America for several years, Nin had forgotten how to speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]], but retained her French and became fluent in English.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nin, Anaïs|title=The diary of Anaïs Nin: 1931–1934, Volume 1|publisher=Houghtin Mifflin Harcourt|year=1966|page=183}}</ref>

On March 3, 1923, in [[Havana, Cuba]], Nin married her first husband, [[Hugh Parker Guiler]] (1898–1985), a banker and artist, later known as "Ian Hugo" when he became a maker of [[experimental film]]s in the late 1940s. The couple moved to [[Paris]] the following year, where Guiler pursued his [[banking]] career and Nin began to pursue her interest in writing; in her diaries she also mentions having trained as a [[flamenco]] dancer in Paris in the mid-to-late 1920s. Her first published work was a critical evaluation of [[D. H. Lawrence]] called ''[[D. H. Lawrence: An Unprofessional Study]]'', which she wrote in sixteen days.<ref name="kir" /> 

She was transformed by her therapy with [[Otto Rank]], who broke with Freud over Freud's failure to appreciate the power of women's sexuality, the value of art, and the meaning of the mother-child relationship. On her second visit to Rank, Nin reflects on her desire to be “re-born,” feelingly, as a woman and artist. Rank, she observes, helped her move back and forth between what she could verbalize in her journals and what remained unarticulated. She discovered the quality and depth of her feelings in the wordless transitions between what she could say and what she could not say.  “As he talked, I thought of my difficulties with writing, my struggles to articulate feelings not easily expressed.  Of my struggles to find a language for intuition, feeling, instincts which are, in themselves, elusive, subtle, and wordless”.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nin, Anaïs|title=The diary of Anaïs Nin: 1931–1934, Volume 1|publisher=Houghtin Mifflin Harcourt|year=1966|page=276}}</ref>

In the late summer of 1939, when residents from overseas were urged to leave France due to the approaching war, Nin left Paris and returned to New York City with her husband.  (Guiler was, according to his own wishes, all but edited out of the diaries published during Nin's lifetime; his role in her life is therefore difficult to gauge).<ref>"Several persons, when faced with the question of whether they wanted to remain in the diary 'as is'... chose to be deleted altogether from the manuscript (including her husband and some members of her family)." ''The Diary of Anaïs Nin'', ed. by Gunther Stuhlmann. Harcourt, 1966, p. xi.</ref> During the war, Nin sent her books to Frances Steloff of the [[Gotham Book Mart]] in New York for safekeeping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anaisnin.com/history/Steloff.html |title=Frances Steloff |publisher=Anaisnin.com |date=1920-01-01 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}</ref>

==Personal life==
According to her diaries, ''Vol.1, 1931–1934'', Nin shared a [[bohemian style|bohemian]] lifestyle with [[Henry Miller]] during her time in Paris. Her husband Guiler is not mentioned anywhere in the published edition of the 1930s parts of her diary (Vol. 1–2) although the opening of Vol. 1 makes it clear that she is married, and the introduction suggests her husband refused to be included in the published diaries. Nin appeared in the [[Kenneth Anger]] film ''[[Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome]]'' (1954) as [[Astarte]]; in the [[Maya Deren]] film ''Ritual in Transfigured Time'' (1946); and in ''Bells of Atlantis'' (1952), a film directed by Guiler under the name "Ian Hugo" with a soundtrack of [[electronic music]] by [[Louis and Bebe Barron]].
The diaries edited by her second husband, after her death, tell that her union with Henry Miller was very passionate and physical, and that she believed that it was a pregnancy by him that she aborted in 1934.

In 1947, at the age of 44, she met former actor [[Rupert Pole]] in a Manhattan elevator on her way to a party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/magazine/31pole.t.html?_r=1|work=New York Times|title=The Lover Who Always Stays|date=2006-12-31|accessdate=2011-02-16|author=Corbett, Sara}}</ref><ref name="pole">{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5591676|work=National Public Radio (NPR)|title=Anais Nin Husband, Rupert Pole, Dies in L.A.|date=2006-07-29|accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref> The two ended up dating and traveled to California together; Pole was sixteen years her junior. On March 17, 1955, she married him at [[Quartzsite, Arizona]], returning with Pole to live in California.<ref>Bair biography, 1995 and IMDB.</ref> Guiler remained in New York City and was unaware of Nin's second marriage until after her death in 1977, though biographer [[Deirdre Bair]] alleges that Guiler knew what was happening while Nin was in California, but consciously "chose not to know".<ref name="pole" />

Nin referred to her simultaneous marriages as her "bicoastal trapeze".<ref name="pole" /> According to Deidre Bair: {{quote|[Anaïs] would set up these elaborate façades in Los Angeles and in New York, but it became so complicated that she had to create something she called the lie box. She had this absolutely enormous purse and in the purse she had two sets of checkbooks. One said Anaïs Guiler for New York and another said Anaïs Pole for Los Angeles. She had prescription bottles from California doctors and New York doctors with the two different names. And she had a collection of file cards. And she said, "I tell so many lies I have to write them down and keep them in the lie box so I can keep them straight."<ref name="pole" />}}

In 1966, Nin had her marriage with Pole annulled, due to the legal issues arising from both Guiler and Pole having to claim her as a dependent on their federal [[Tax return (United States)|tax return]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2006/07/27/rupert_pole_executor_of_exotic_works_by_anas_nin/|work=Boston Globe|title=Rupert Pole, executor of exotic works by Anaïs Nin|author=Woo, Elaine|date=2006-07-27|accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref> Though the marriage was annulled, Nin and Pole continued to live together as if they were married, up until her death in 1977.

After Guiler's death in 1985, the [[expurgation|unexpurgated]] versions of her journals were commissioned by Pole.<ref>{{cite news|last=Woo|first=Elaine|title=The Ranger Who Told All About Anais Nin's Wild Life|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/26/local/me-pole26|accessdate=8 August 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 26, 2006}}</ref> Pole died in July 2006.

Nin often cited authors [[Djuna Barnes]] and D. H. Lawrence as inspirations.  She states in Volume One of her diaries that she drew inspiration from [[Marcel Proust]], [[André Gide]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Paul Valéry]], and [[Arthur Rimbaud]].

Nin once worked at Lawrence R. Maxwell Books located at [[45 Christopher Street]] in New York City.<ref>Recollections of Anaïs Nin, Ohio University Press, 1996, p. 6.</ref>

==Literary career==

===Journals===
Anaïs Nin is perhaps best remembered as a [[diarist]]. Her journals, which span several decades, provide a deeply explorative insight into her personal life and relationships. Nin was acquainted, often quite intimately, with a number of prominent authors, artists, [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]], and other figures, and wrote of them often, especially [[Otto Rank]]. Moreover, as a female author describing a primarily masculine constellation of celebrities, Nin's journals have acquired importance as a counterbalancing perspective.

Previously unpublished works are coming to light in ''A Café in Space, the Anaïs Nin Literary Journal'', which most recently includes "Anaïs Nin and Joaquín Nin y Castellanos: Prelude to a Symphony—Letters between a father and daughter."

So far fifteen volumes of her journals have been published.

===Erotic writings===
Nin is hailed by many critics as one of the finest writers of [[Women's erotica|female erotica]]. She was one of the first women known to explore fully the realm of erotic writing, and certainly the first prominent woman in the modern West known to write erotica. Before her, erotica acknowledged to be written by women was rare, with a few notable exceptions, such as the work of [[Kate Chopin]].

According to Volume I of her diaries, 1931–1934, published in 1966 (Stuhlmann), Nin first came across erotica when she returned to Paris with her husband, mother and two brothers in her late teens. They rented the apartment of an American man who was away for the summer, and Nin came across a number of French paperbacks: "One by one, I read these books, which were completely new to me.  I had never read erotic literature in America… They overwhelmed me.  I was innocent before I read them, but by the time I had read them all, there was nothing I did not know about sexual exploits… I had my degree in erotic lore."

[[Image:Anais Nin.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Anaïs Nin in the 1970s by [[Elsa Dorfman]]]]
Faced with a desperate need for money, Nin, Miller and some of their friends began in the 1940s to write erotic and pornographic narratives for an anonymous "collector" for a dollar a page, somewhat as a joke.<ref>{{cite web|title=DELTA OF VENUS, by Anaïs Nin<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://www.geocities.com/arsenio_grilo/a_nin_1.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5knBgSwxc|archivedate=2009-10-25|deadurl=yes}}</ref> (It is not clear whether Miller actually wrote these stories or merely allowed his name to be used.<ref>[[Noël Riley Fitch]], ''Anaïs: The Erotic Life of Anaïs Nin'' (Boston: [[Little, Brown and Company]], 1993) ISBN 0-316-28428-9</ref>)  Nin considered the characters in her erotica to be extreme caricatures and never intended the work to be published, but changed her mind in the early 1970s and allowed them to be published as ''[[Delta of Venus]]''<ref>Elizabeth Kowaleski-Wallace, ''Encyclopedia of feminist literary theory'', [[Taylor & Francis]], 1997, ISBN 0-8153-0824-8, p.190</ref><ref>Andrew Gibson, ''Postmodernity, ethics and the novel: from Leavis to Levinas'', Routledge, 1999, ISBN 0-415-19895-X, p.177</ref> and ''[[Little Birds]]''.

Nin was a friend, and in some cases lover, of many leading literary figures, including [[Henry Miller]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Gore Vidal]], [[James Agee]], [[James Leo Herlihy]], and [[Lawrence Durrell]]. Her passionate love affair and friendship with Miller strongly influenced her both sexually and as an author. Nin wrote about her infatuation with the [[Surrealist]] artist [[Bridget Bate Tichenor]] in her diaries.<ref>''Diaries, Volume 3, 1939–1944''</ref><ref name="www.bridgetbatetichenor.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgetbatetichenor.com |title=Bridget Bate Tichenor Website |publisher=Bridgetbatetichenor.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}</ref> The rumor that Nin was [[bisexual]] was given added circulation by the [[Philip Kaufman]] film ''[[Henry & June]]''. This rumor is dashed by at least two encounters Nin writes about in her third unexpurgated journal, ''Fire''. The first is with a patient of Nin's (Nin was working as a psychoanalyst in [[New York]] at the time), Thurema Sokol, with whom nothing physical occurs. She also describes a ménage à trois in a hotel, and while Nin is attracted to the other woman, she does not respond completely (229–31). Nin confirms that she is not bisexual in her unpublished 1940 diary when she states that although she could be attracted erotically to some women, the sexual act itself made her uncomfortable. What is irrefutable is her sexual attraction to men.

Nin's first unexpurgated journal, ''[[Henry and June]]'', makes it clear, despite the notion to the contrary, that she did not have sexual relations with Miller's wife, June. While Nin was stirred by June to the point where she says (paraphrasing), "I have become June," she did not consummate her erotic feelings for her. Still, to both Anaïs and Henry, June was a femme fatale—irresistible, cunning, erotic. Nin gave June money, jewelry, clothes, often leaving herself broke. In her second unexpurgated journal, ''Incest'', she wrote that she had an [[incest]]uous relationship with her father, which was graphically described (207–15). When Nin's father learned of the title of her first book of fiction, ''[[House of Incest]]'', he feared that the true nature of their relationship would be revealed, when, in fact, it was heavily veiled in Nin's text.

==Later life and legacy==
The explosion of the [[feminist movement]] in the 1960s gave feminist perspectives on Nin's writings of the past twenty years, which made Nin a popular lecturer at various universities; contrarily, Nin disassociated herself from the political activism of the movement.<ref name="kir" />

In 1973 Anaïs Nin received an honorary [[doctorate]] from the [[Philadelphia College of Art]]. She was elected to the United States [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] in 1974.  She died in [[Los Angeles, California]] on January 14, 1977 after a three-year battle with [[cancer]].<ref>Nin, Anaïs. Rauner Library Letters (September 1975): "I suppose you know I have been fighting cancer for 9 months – just recovering very slowly."</ref> Her body was [[cremation|cremated]], and her ashes were scattered over [[Santa Monica Bay]] in Mermaid Cove. Her first husband, Hugh Guiler, died in 1985, and his ashes were scattered in the cove as well.<ref name="pole" /> Rupert Pole was named Nin's [[literary executor]], and he arranged to have new unexpurgated editions of Nin's books and diaries published between 1985 and his death in 2006.

[[Philip Kaufman]] directed the 1990 film ''[[Henry & June]]'' based on Nin's novel ''[[Henry and June|Henry and June: From the Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin]]''. She was portrayed in the film by [[Maria de Medeiros]].

On September 27th, 2013, screenwriter and author [[Kim Krizan]] published an article on [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-krizan/gore-vidals-secret-unpubl_b_4004916.html?utm_hp_ref=books The Huffington Post] revealing she had found a previously unpublished love letter written by [[Gore Vidal]] to Nin. This letter contradicts Gore Vidal's previous characterization of his relationship with Nin, showing that Vidal did have feelings for Nin that he later heavily disavowed in his autobiography, ''Palimpsest''. Krizan did this research in the run up to the release of the latest volume of Anaïs Nin's uncensored diary, [http://www.amazon.com/Mirages-Unexpurgated-Diary-Anais-1939-1947/dp/080401146X Mirages], for which Krizan provided the foreword.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-krizan/gore-vidals-secret-unpubl_b_4004916.html?utm_hp_ref=books|title=Gore Vidal's Secret, Unpublished Love Letter To Anaïs Nin|date=September 27, 2013|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=2013-09-20}}</ref>
