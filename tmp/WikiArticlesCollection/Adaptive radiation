{{Evolutionary biology}}
In [[evolutionary biology]], '''adaptive radiation''' is a process in which organisms diversify rapidly into a multitude of new forms, particularly when a change in the environment makes new resources available and opens environmental niches.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Larsen|first=Clark S.|title= Our Origins: Discovering Physical Anthropology|edition=2|year=2011|publisher=Norton|page=A11}}</ref><ref name="Schluter2000">{{cite book

Adaptive radiation, a characteristic example of [[cladogenesis]], can be graphically illustrated as a "bush", or [[clade]], of coexisting species (on the [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]).

== Identification ==
Four features can be used to identify an adaptive radiation:<ref name="Schluter2000" />
# A common ancestry of component species: specifically a ''recent'' ancestry. Note that this is not the same as a [[monophyly]] in which ''all'' descendants of a common ancestor are included.
# A phenotype-environment correlation: a ''significant'' association between environments and the morphological and physiological traits used to exploit those environments.
# Trait utility: the performance or fitness advantages of trait values in their corresponding environments.
# Rapid speciation: presence of one or more ''bursts'' in the emergence of new species around the time that ecological and phenotypic divergence is underway.

===Innovation===
The evolution of a novel feature may permit a clade to diversify by making new areas of morphospace accessible. A classic example is the evolution of a fourth cusp in the mammalian tooth. This trait permits a vast increase in the range of foodstuffs which can be fed on. Evolution of this character has thus increased the number of [[ecological niche]]s available to mammals. The trait arose a number of times in different groups during the [[Cenozoic]], and in each instance was immediately followed by an adaptive radiation.<ref name=Jernvall1996>{{cite doi|10.1126/science.274.5292.1489}}</ref> Birds find other ways to provide for each other, i.e. the evolution of flight opened new avenues for evolution to explore, initiating an adaptive radiation.<ref>{{cite book

Other examples include [[placental]] gestation (for [[eutheria]]n mammals), or [[Bipedalism|bipedal locomotion]] (in [[hominins]]).<ref name="Levin-21" />

===Opportunity===
Adaptive radiations often occur as a result of an organism arising in an environment with unoccupied niches, such as a newly formed lake or isolated island chain. The colonizing population may diversify rapidly to take advantage of all possible niches.

In [[Lake Victoria]], an isolated lake which formed recently in the African rift valley, over 300 species of [[cichlid]] fish adaptively radiated from one parent species in just 15,000 years.

Adaptive radiations commonly follow [[mass extinction]]s: following an extinction, many niches are left vacant. A classic example of this is the replacement of the non-avian dinosaurs with mammals at the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|end of the Cretaceous]], and of [[brachiopod]]s by bivalves at the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permo-Triassic boundary]].
