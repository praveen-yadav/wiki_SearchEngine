{{classic element}}
'''Air''' is often seen as a universal power or pure substance. Its supposed fundamental importance to life can be seen in words such as ''aspire'', ''inspire'', ''perspire'' and ''spirit'', all derived from the [[Latin]] ''spirare''.

==Greek and Roman tradition==
Air is one of the four [[classical element]]s in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] and science.  According to [[Plato]], it is associated with the [[octahedron]]; air is considered to be both hot and wet. The ancient Greeks used two words for air: ''aer'' meant the dim lower atmosphere, and ''[[aether (mythology)|aether]]'' meant the bright upper atmosphere above the clouds.<ref>[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], ''A History of Greek Philosophy'', vol. 1, pp. 466, 470-71.</ref> [[Plato]], for instance writes that "So it is with air: there is the brightest variety which we call ''aether'', the muddiest which we call mist and darkness, and other kinds for which we have no name...."<ref>Plato, ''Timaeus'', ch. 27, p. 83.</ref> Among the early Greek [[Pre-Socratic]] philosophers, [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] (mid-6th century BCE) named air as the ''[[arche]]''.<ref>Guthrie, ''History of Greek Philosophy'', vol. 1, pp. 115-16, 120-32; Jonathan Barnes, ''Early Greek Philosophy'', pp. 77-80.</ref> A similar belief was attributed by some ancient sources to [[Diogenes Apolloniates]] (late 5th century BCE), who also linked air with intelligence and soul (''psyche''), but other sources claim that his ''arche'' was a substance between air and fire.<ref>Guthrie, vol. 2, pp. 362-81; Barnes, pp. 289-94.</ref> [[Aristophanes]] parodied such teachings in his play ''[[The Clouds]]'' by putting a prayer to air in the mouth of [[Socrates]].

Air was one of many ''archai'' proposed by the Pre-socratics, most of whom tried to reduce all things to a single substance. However, [[Empedocles]] of Acragas (c. 495-c. 435 BCE) selected four ''archai'' for his four roots: Air, [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[water (classical element)|water]], and [[earth (classical element)|earth]]. Ancient and modern opinions differ as to whether he identified air by the divine name [[Hera]], [[Hades|Aidoneus]] or even [[Zeus]]. Empedocles’ roots became the four classical elements of Greek philosophy.<ref>Guthrie, vol. 2, pp. 138-46. Guthrie suggests that Hera is the safest identification for air.</ref> [[Plato]] (427-347 BCE) took over the four elements of Empedocles. In the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', his major cosmological dialogue, the [[Platonic solid]] associated with air is the [[octahedron]] which is formed from eight equilateral triangles. This places air between fire and water which Plato regarded as appropriate because it is intermediate in its mobility, sharpness, and ability to penetrate.  He also said of air that its minuscule components are so smooth that one can barely feel them.<ref>Plato, ''Timaeus'', chap. 22-23; Gregory Vlastos, ''Plato’s Universe'', pp. 66-82.</ref> 

Plato's student [[Aristotle]] (384-322 BCE) developed a different explanation for the elements based on pairs of qualities. The four elements were arranged concentrically around the center of the universe to form the [[sublunary sphere]]. According to Aristotle, air is both hot and wet and occupies a place between fire and water among the elemental spheres. Aristotle definitively separated air from [[aether (classical element)|aether]]. For him, aether was an unchanging, almost divine substance that was found only in the heavens, where it formed [[celestial spheres]].<ref>[[G. E. R. Lloyd]], ''Aristotle'', chapters 7-8.</ref>

In [[Medicine in ancient Greece|ancient Greek medicine]], each of the [[four humours]] became associated with an element. [[Blood]] was the humor identified with air, since both were hot and wet. Other things associated with air and blood in ancient and medieval medicine included the season of [[spring (season)|spring]], since it increased the qualities of heat and moisture; the sanguine temperament (of a person dominated by the blood humour); [[hermaphrodite]] (combining the masculine quality of heat with the feminine quality of moisture); and the northern point of the compass.<ref>Londa Schiebinger, p. 162.</ref>

==Indian tradition==
{{Main|Vayu}}
In [[Hinduism]], '''Vayu''' ([[Sanskrit]] वायु  ), ''also known as'' '''Vāta''' वात, '''Pavana''' पवन (meaning the Purifier),<ref>The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning By Eva Rudy Jansen p. 68</ref> or '''Prāna,''' is a primary deity, who is the father of [[Bhima]] and the spiritual father of Lord [[Hanuman]]. As the words for air (Vāyu) or wind (Pavana) it is one of the ''[[Classical elements#Classical elements in Hinduism|Panchamahābhuta]]'' the "five great elements" in Hinduism. The [[Sanskrit]] word 'Vāta' literally means "[[:wikt:blown|blown]]", 'Vāyu' "[[:wikt:blower|blower]]", and 'Prāna' "[[:wikt:breathing|breathing]]" (viz. the breath of life, cf. the *an- in '[[:wikt:animate|animate]]').

==Chinese tradition==
Air is not one of the traditional five [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Chinese classical elements]].  Nevertheless, the ancient Chinese concept of ''Qi'' or ''chi'' is believed to be close to that of air. '''[[Qi]]''' ({{IPA-cmn|tɕʰî}}; spelled ''qì'' in [[Pinyin]] [[romanization]] and ''ch'i4'' in [[Wade-Giles]]) or '''ki''' (in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[romanization of Japanese|romanization]]), is a fundamental concept of traditional [[China|Chinese]] culture. Qi is believed to be part of every living thing that exists, as a kind of "[[Vitalism|life force]]" or "[[energy (spirituality)|spiritual energy]]". It is frequently translated as "energy flow", or literally as "air" or "breath". (For example, "tiānqì", literally "sky breath", is the ordinary Chinese word for "[[weather]]"). In Mandarin Chinese it is pronounced something like "chee" in English, but the tongue position is different.  (See [[Media:Difficult Sounds.GIF]].) The concept of qi is often [[Reification (fallacy)|reified]], however no scientific evidence supports its existence. 

The element air also appears as a concept in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] religion which has an ancient history in China.

Some Western modern occultists equate the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Chinese classical element]] of [[metal (classical element)|metal]] with ''air'',<ref>Donald Michael Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', p. 115.</ref> others with [[Wood (Wu Xing)|wood]] due to the elemental association of wind and wood in the [[bagua]].

==Astrological personalities==
People born under the astrological signs of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]], [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] and [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] are thought to have dominant air personalities. Air personalities tend to be kind, intellectual, communicative and social; however, they can also be selfish, superficial, vicious and very insensitive to other people's emotions.

==Ceremonial magic==
The [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], founded in 1888, incorporates air and the other Greek classical elements into its teachings.<ref>Israel Regardie, ''The Golden Dawn'', pp. 154-65.</ref> The [[magical weapon|elemental weapon]] of air is the dagger which must be painted yellow with magical names and sigils written upon it in violet.<ref>Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p.322; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 149-53.</ref> Each of the elements has several associated spiritual beings. The archangel of air is [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], the angel is Chassan, the ruler is Aral, the king is Paralda, and the air [[elemental]]s (following [[Paracelsus]]) are called [[sylph]]s.<ref>Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p. 80.</ref> Air is considerable and it is referred to the upper left point of the pentagram in the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram.<ref>Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', pp. 280-286; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 206-209.</ref> Many of these associations have since spread throughout the occult community.

In the Golden Dawn and many other magical systems, each element is associated with one of the [[cardinal point]]s and is placed under the care of guardian Watchtowers. The Watchtowers derive from the [[Enochian magic|Enochian system of magic]] founded by Dee. In the Golden Dawn, they are represented by the Enochian elemental tablets.<ref>Doreen Valiente, ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', p. 64.</ref> Air is associated with the east, which is guarded by the First Watchtower.<ref>Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p. 631.</ref>

==Modern witchcraft==
Air is one of the five elements that appear in most [[Wicca]]n and Pagan traditions. [[Wicca]] in particular was influenced by the Golden Dawn system of magic, and [[Aleister Crowley]]'s mysticism.<ref>Hutton, pp. 216-23; Valiente, Witchcraft for Tomorrow, p. 17.</ref> Common Wiccan attributions include:
* Cardinal direction: [[East]]
* Season: [[Spring (season)|Spring]]
* Time of life: Childhood
* Time of day: Sunrise
* Regent Planet: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]
* Elemental being: [[Sylph]]
* Colors: Light blue, white, bright yellow
* Magical tools: [[Sword]]
* [[Tarot reading]]: Wands or Swords in the [[Minor Arcana]]. Swords are traditionally associated with air and still are in most tarot decks, however, increasingly decks are being published with the Wands association. This is still a matter of debate within the esoteric and Wiccan community.<ref>See Philip and Stephanie Carr-Gomm DruidCraft Tarot Handbook, or http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/learn/meanings/suits.shtml</ref>
* Altar tool: Incense
* Masculine energy
* Other: [[As Above, So Below|Correspondences]] include mind, intellect, study, consciousness and communications.

==Other traditions==
[[Enlil]] was the god of air in ancient [[Sumer]]. [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] was the [[ancient Egypt]]ian god of air and the husband of [[Tefnut]], goddess of moisture. He became an emblem of strength by virtue of his role in separating [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] from [[Geb]]. He played a primary role in the [[Coffin Texts]], which were spells intended to help the deceased reach the realm of the afterlife safely. On the way to the sky, the spirit had to travel through the air as one spell indicates: "I have gone up in Shu, I have climbed on the sunbeams."<ref>Bob Brier, ''Ancient Egyptian Magic'', p.128.</ref>

In [[East Asia]], air is seen as the equivalent of wood. Air is represented in the [[Aztec]] religion by a snake to the [[Scythians]], a yoke to the [[Hindu]]s and for [[Culture of Greece|Greeks]] as a sword{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and in [[Christian]] [[iconography]] as [[Human|mankind]].{{Clarify|reason=sentence structure unclear/incomplete|date=March 2012}}
