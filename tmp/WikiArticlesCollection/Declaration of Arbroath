The '''Declaration of Arbroath''' is a declaration of [[Scottish independence]], made in 1320. It is in the form of a letter submitted to [[Pope John XXII]], dated 6 April 1320, intended to confirm [[Scotland]]'s status as an [[sovereign state|independent, sovereign state]] and defending Scotland's right to use military action when unjustly attacked.

Generally believed to have been written in the [[Arbroath Abbey]] by [[Bernard of Kilwinning]], then [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland|Chancellor of Scotland]] and [[Abbot of Arbroath]],<ref>Ronald McNair Scott: ''Robert the Bruce, King of Scots'', Canongate 1996, p 196, ISBN 0-86241-616-7</ref> and sealed by fifty-one [[magnate]]s and [[nobles]], the letter is the sole survivor of three created at the time. The others were a letter from the [[King of Scots]], [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert I]], and a letter from four Scottish bishops which all presumably made similar points.

== Overview ==
The Declaration was part of a broader diplomatic campaign which sought to assert Scotland's position as an independent kingdom,<ref name="barrow">Robert the Bruce and the Scottish Identity, G.Barrow, 1984</ref> rather than being a feudal land controlled by England's Norman kings, as well as lift the [[excommunication]] of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]].<ref name="Lynch">Scotland: A New History, M. Lynch, 1992</ref> The Pope had recognised [[Edward I of England]]'s claim to overlordship of Scotland in 1305 and Bruce was excommunicated by the Pope for murdering [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]] before the altar in Greyfriars Church in Dumfries in 1306.<ref name="Lynch" />

The Declaration made a number [[rhetoric]]al points: that Scotland had always been independent, indeed for longer than England; that [[Edward I of England]] had unjustly attacked Scotland and perpetrated atrocities; that Robert the Bruce had delivered the Scottish [[nation]] from this peril; and, most controversially, that the independence of Scotland was the prerogative of the Scottish people, rather than the King of Scots. In fact it stated that the nobility would choose someone else to be king if Bruce proved to be unfit in maintaining Scotland's independence. Some have interpreted this last point as an early expression of '[[popular sovereignty]]'<ref>{{cite book|last=McLean|first=Iain|title=State of the Union: Unionism and the Alternatives in the United Kingdom Since 1707|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-925820-8|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H2u9uOEYruYC&pg=PA247&dq=Declaration+of+Arbroath+not+%22popular+sovereignty%22#v=onepage&q=Declaration%20of%20Arbroath%20not%20%22popular%20sovereignty%22&f=false|coauthors=Alistair McMillan|page=247}}</ref> &ndash; that government is contractual and that kings can be chosen by the community rather than by [[God]] alone.

It has also been argued that the Declaration was not a statement of popular sovereignty (and that its signatories would have had no such concept)<ref>{{cite book|last=Kellas|first=James G.|title=The politics of nationalism and ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Palgrave|isbn=978-0-312-21553-8|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=m542R9ygB3QC&pg=PA147&dq=Declaration+of+Arbroath+%22popular+sovereignty%22#v=onepage&q=Declaration%20of%20Arbroath%20%22popular%20sovereignty%22&f=false|page=35}}</ref>

The reason given in the Declaration is that Bruce was able to defend Scotland from English aggression whereas, by implication, King John could not.<ref name="newpeng">The New Penguin History of Scotland, edited by R.A.

To this man, in as much as he saved our people, and for upholding our freedom, we are bound by right as much as by his merits, and choose to follow him in all that he does.

Whatever the true motive, the idea of a contract between King and people was advanced to the Pope as an excuse for Bruce's coronation whilst John de Balliol still lived in Papal custody.<ref name="barrow" />

There are 39 names (eight [[earl]]s and thirty one [[baron]]s) at the start of the document, all of whom may have had their seals appended, probably over the space of some weeks and months, with nobles sending in their seals to be used. (On the extant copy of the Declaration there are only 19 seals, and of those 19 people only 12 are named within the document.) It is thought likely that at least 11 more seals than the original 39 might have been appended.)<ref>{{Cite web | title = The seals on the Declaration of Arbroath | publisher = National Archives of Scotland  | url = http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/doaSeals.asp | accessdate = 2 September 2011}}</ref> The Declaration was then taken to the [[papal court]] at [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]] by Bishop Kininmund, Sir Adam Gordon and Sir Odard de Maubuisson.<ref name="barrow"/>

The Pope heeded the arguments contained in the Declaration, influenced by the offer of support from the Scots for his long-desired crusade if they no longer had to fear English invasion. He exhorted Edward II in a letter to make peace with the Scots, but the following year was again persuaded by the English to take their side and issued six bulls to that effect.<ref>Ronald McNair Scott: ''Robert the Bruce, King of Scots'', Canongate 1996, p 197, ISBN 0-86241-616-7</ref> It was only in  October 1328, after a short-lived [[peace treaty]] between Scotland and [[Kingdom of England|England]], the [[Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton]] (which renounced all English claims to Scotland and was signed by the new [[English king]], [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], on 1 March 1328), that the interdict on Scotland and the excommunication of its king were finally removed.<ref>Ronald McNair Scott: ''Robert the Bruce, King of Scots'', Canongate 1996, p 225, ISBN 0-86241-616-7</ref>

The original copy of the Declaration that was sent to Avignon is lost. A copy of the Declaration survives among Scotland's state papers, held by the [[National Archives of Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]].<ref>[http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/090401.asp National Archives of Scotland website feature]</ref> The most widely known English language translation was made by [[Sir James Fergusson, 8th Baronet|Sir James Fergusson]], formerly [[Keeper of the Records of Scotland]], from text that he reconstructed using this extant copy and early copies of the original draft. One passage in particular is often quoted from the Fergusson translation:

{{quote|...for, as long as but a hundred of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be brought under English rule. It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom &ndash; for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.}}
