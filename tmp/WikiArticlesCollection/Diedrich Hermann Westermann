[[Image:Westermann 1911 Sudansprachen cover.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Westermann's 1911 ''Die [[Sudanic languages|Sudansprachen]]''.]]'''Diedrich Hermann Westermann''' (June 24, 1875&ndash;May 31, 1956) was a [[Germany|German]] missionary, [[African studies|Africanist]], and [[linguistics|linguist]]. He substantially extended and revised the work of [[Carl Meinhof]], his teacher, although he rejected some of Meinhof's theories only implicitly. Westermann is seen as one of the founders of modern [[Africa]]n linguistics. 

He carried out extensive linguistic and anthropological research in the area ranging from Senegal eastwards to the Upper Nile. His linguistic publications cover a wide range of African languages, including the [[Gbe languages]], [[Nuer language|Nuer]], [[Kpelle language|Kpelle]], [[Shilluk language|Shilluk]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], and [[Guang language|Guang]]. 

Westermann's comparative work, begun in 1911, initially brought together much of today's [[Niger–Congo]] and [[Nilo-Saharan]] language phyla under the name [[Sudanic languages]]. His most important later publication ''Die westlichen Sudansprachen'' [[1927a]] divided these into East and West [[Sudanic languages]] and laid the basis for what would become Niger–Congo. In this book and a series of associated articles between 1925 and 1928, Westermann both identified a large number of roots that form the basis of our understanding of Niger–Congo and set out the evidence for the coherence of many of the families that constitute it. Much of the classification of African languages associated with Joseph Greenberg actually derives from the work of Westermann.
 
In 1927 Westermann published a ''Practical Orthography of [[African Languages]]'' which became later known as the ''Westermann script''. Subsequently he published the influential and oft-reprinted ''[[Practical Phonetics for Students of African Languages]]'' in collaboration with [[Ida C. Ward]] (1933).

He was born in [[Baden, Lower Saxony|Baden]] near [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] and also died there.
