The '''Baroque''' ({{IPAc-en|US|b|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|UK|b|ə|ˈ|r|ɒ|k}}) is a period of artistic [[Style (visual arts)|style]] that used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, exuberance, and grandeur in sculpture, painting, architecture, literature, dance, and music. The style began around 1600 in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] and spread to most of Europe.<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul|last=Fargis|title=The New York Public Library Desk Reference|year=1998|edition=third|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan General Reference|page=262|isbn=0-02-862169-7}}</ref>

The popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], which had decided at the time of the [[Council of Trent]], in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]], that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement.<ref>Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'' (Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2005), p. 516.</ref>  The [[nobility|aristocracy]] also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumph, power and control. Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts, grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence.

==Etymology==
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word ''baroque'' is derived from the Portuguese word "barroco", Spanish "barroco", or French "baroque", all of which refer to a "rough or imperfect pearl", though whether it entered those languages via Latin, Arabic, or some other source is uncertain.<ref>''OED'' Online. Accessed 6 June 2008.</ref> The 1911 [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 11th edition]], thought the term was derived from the Spanish ''barrueco'', a large, irregularly-shaped pearl, and that it had for a time been confined to the craft of the jeweller.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/b/baroque.html |title=Baroque |work=Encyclopædia Britannica 1911 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref> Others derive it from the [[mnemonic]] term [[Syllogism#Baroco (AOO-2)|"Baroco", a supposedly laboured form of syllogism]] in logical ''Scholastica''.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Panofsky | first=Erwin | contribution=What is Baroque? |  title=Three Essays on Style| publisher=The MIT Press | year=1995 | page=19 | ref=harv | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> The Latin root can be found in ''bis-roca''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etimo.it/?term=barocco |title=Baroque |work=Vocabolario Etimologico della Lingua Italiana di Ottorino Pianigiani |accessdate=26 Luglio 2012}}</ref>

In informal usage, the word ''baroque'' can simply mean that something is "elaborate", with many details, without reference to the Baroque styles of the 17th and 18th centuries.

The word "Baroque", like most [[Periodization|periodic]] or stylistic designations, was invented by later critics rather than practitioners of the arts in the 17th and early 18th centuries. It is a French transliteration of the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] phrase "pérola barroca", which means  "irregular [[pearl]]", and natural pearls that deviate from the usual, regular forms so they do not have an [[axis of rotation]] are known as "[[baroque pearl]]s".<ref>{{cite web|author=Diogo Mayo |url=http://scalaregia.blogspot.ca/2011_06_01_archive.html |title=Scale Regia |publisher=Scalaregia.blogspot.ca |date=1967-09-15 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}</ref>

The term "Baroque" was initially used in a derogatory sense, to underline the excesses of its emphasis. In particular, the term was used to describe its eccentric redundancy and noisy abundance of details, which sharply contrasted the clear and sober rationality of the [[Renaissance]]. Although it was long thought that the word as a critical term was first applied to architecture, in fact it appears earlier in reference to music, in an anonymous, satirical review of the première in October 1733 of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]]'', printed in the ''[[Mercure de France]]'' in May 1734. The critic implied that the novelty in this opera was "du barocque", complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was filled with unremitting dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.<ref>Claude V. Palisca, "Baroque". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).</ref>

==Modern usage==
In modern usage, the term "Baroque" may still be used, usually pejoratively, describing works of art, craft, or design that are thought to have excessive ornamentation or complexity of line, or, as a [[synonym]] for "[[Derogatory use of "Byzantine"|Byzantine]]", to describe literature, computer software, contracts, or laws that are thought to be excessively complex, indirect, or obscure in language, to the extent of concealing or confusing their meaning.

The word was first rehabilitated by the [[Switzerland|Swiss-born]] [[Art History|art historian]], [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945) in his ''Renaissance und Barock'' (1888); Wölfflin identified the Baroque as "movement imported into mass," an art antithetic to Renaissance art. He did not make the distinctions between [[Mannerism]] and Baroque that modern writers do, and he ignored the later phase, the academic Baroque that lasted into the 18th century. Writers in French and English did not begin to treat Baroque as a respectable study until Wölfflin's influence had made German scholarship pre-eminent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Development==
[[File:Aeneas' Flight from Troy by Federico Barocci.jpg|thumb|''Aeneas flees burning Troy,'' [[Federico Barocci]], 1598]]

The Baroque originated around 1600, several decades after the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–63), by which the [[Roman Catholic Church]] answered many questions of internal reform, addressed the representational arts by demanding that paintings and sculptures in church contexts should speak to the illiterate rather than to the well-informed.  This turn toward a populist conception of the function of ecclesiastical art is seen by many [[Art history|art historians]] as driving the innovations of [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]] and brothers [[Agostino Carracci|Agostino]] and [[Annibale Carracci]], all of who were working (and competing for commissions) in Rome around 1600.

The appeal of Baroque style turned consciously from the witty, intellectual qualities of 16th century [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] art to a visceral appeal aimed at the senses. It employed an iconography that was direct, simple, obvious, and theatrical (''illustration, right''). Baroque art drew on certain broad and heroic tendencies in [[Annibale Carracci]] and his circle, and found inspiration in other artists like [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]] and [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]] and [[Federico Barocci]] (''illustration, left''), nowadays sometimes termed 'proto-Baroque'.  Germinal ideas of the Baroque can also be found in the work of [[Michelangelo Buonarroti|Michelangelo]]. Some general parallels in music make the expression "[[Baroque music]]" useful: there are contrasting phrase lengths, harmony and [[counterpoint]] have ousted [[polyphony]], and orchestral color makes a stronger appearance. Even more generalized parallels perceived by some experts in philosophy, prose style and poetry, are harder to pinpoint.

Though Baroque was superseded in many centers by the [[Rococo]] style, beginning in France in the late 1720s, especially for interiors, paintings and the decorative arts, the Baroque style continued to be used in architecture until the advent of [[Neoclassicism]] in the later 18th century. See the Neapolitan palace of [[Caserta]], a Baroque palace (though in a chaste exterior) whose construction began 1752.
[[File:Prager Burg - Nikolauskirche Kuppel.jpg|thumb|250px|St. Nicholas Church in [[Malá Strana|Lesser Town]] in [[Prague]] was founded in 1703 under lead of Baroque architect [[Christoph Dientzenhofer]].]]

In paintings Baroque gestures are broader than Mannerist gestures: less ambiguous, less arcane and mysterious, more like the stage gestures of [[opera]], a major Baroque art form. Baroque poses depend on ''contrapposto'' ("counterpoise"), the tension within the figures that move the planes of shoulders and hips in counterdirections. See Bernini's ''David''.

The dryer, less dramatic and coloristic, chastened later stages of 18th century Baroque architectural style are often seen as a separate '''Late Baroque''' manifestation, for example in buildings by [[Claude Perrault]]. Academic characteristics in the neo-[[Palladian]] style, epitomized by [[William Kent]], are a parallel development in Britain and the British colonies: within interiors, Kent's furniture designs are vividly influenced by the Baroque furniture of Rome and Genoa, hierarchical tectonic sculptural elements, meant never to be moved from their positions, completed the wall decoration. Baroque is a style of unity imposed upon rich, heavy detail.

The Baroque was defined by [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] as the age where the oval replaced the circle as the center of composition, that centralization replaced balance, and that coloristic and "painterly" effects began to become more prominent.
Art historians, often [[Protestant]] ones, have traditionally emphasized that the Baroque style evolved during a time in which the [[Roman Catholic Church]] had to react against the many revolutionary cultural movements that produced a new science and new forms of [[religion]]— [[Reformation]].  It has been said that the monumental Baroque is a style that could give the [[Papacy]], like  [[political absolutism|secular absolute monarchies]], a formal, imposing way of expression that could restore its prestige, at the point of becoming somehow symbolic of the [[Counter-Reformation]].

Whether this is the case or not, it was successfully developed in [[Rome]], where Baroque architecture widely renewed the central areas with perhaps the most important urbanistic revision.

===Periods===
The Baroque era is sometimes divided into roughly [[Italian Baroque art|three phases]] for convenience:<ref>[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]], 6th ed. 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/438648/Western-painting/69563/Early-and-High-Baroque-in-Italy |title=Encyclopedia Brittanica: Western painting |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}</ref><ref>Shearer West (ed.)

* Early Baroque, c.1590–c.1625
* High Baroque, c.1625–c.1660

Late Baroque is also sometimes used synonymously with the succeeding [[Rococo]] movement.

==Painting==
{{Main|Baroque painting}}
[[File:JosefaObidos4.jpg|thumb|''Still-life'', by Portuguese painter [[Josefa de Óbidos]], c.1679, [[Santarém, Portugal]], Municipal Library]]

A defining statement of what ''Baroque'' signifies in painting is provided by the series of paintings executed by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] for [[Marie de Medici]] at the [[Luxembourg Palace]] in Paris (now at the [[Louvre]]),<ref>[http://www.students.sbc.edu/vandergriff04/mariedemedici.html Peter Paul Rubens ''The Life of Marie de' Medici''].</ref> in which a Catholic painter satisfied a Catholic patron: Baroque-era conceptions of monarchy, iconography, handling of paint, and compositions as well as the depiction of space and movement.

Baroque style featured "exaggerated lighting, intense emotions, release from restraint, and even a kind of artistic sensationalism". Baroque art did not really depict the life style of the people at that time; however, "closely tied to the Counter-Reformation, this style melodramatically reaffirmed the emotional depths of the Catholic faith and glorified both church and monarchy" of their power and influence.<ref>Hunt, Martin, Rosenwein, and Smith (2010). The Making of the West (third ed.). Boston: Bedford/ St. Martin's. pp. 469</ref>

There were highly diverse strands of Italian baroque painting, from [[Caravaggio]] to [[Pietro da Cortona|Cortona]]; both approaching emotive dynamism with different styles. Another frequently cited work of Baroque art is [[Bernini]]'s ''[[Saint Theresa in Ecstasy]]'' for the Cornaro chapel in Saint Maria della Vittoria, which brings together architecture, sculpture, and theatre into one grand conceit.<ref>[http://www.boglewood.com/cornaro/xteresa.html "Cornaro Chapel" at Bogelwood.com].</ref>

The later Baroque style gradually gave way to a more decorative [[Rococo]].

A rather different art developed out of northern realist traditions in 17th century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], which had very little religious art, and little [[history painting]], instead playing a crucial part in developing secular genres such as [[still life]], [[genre painting]]s of everyday scenes, and [[landscape painting]]. While the Baroque nature of [[Rembrandt]]'s art is clear, the label is less often used for [[Vermeer]] and many other Dutch artists. [[Flemish Baroque painting]] shared a part in this trend, while also continuing to produce the traditional categories.

In a similar way the French classical style of painting exemplified by [[Poussin]] is often classed as Baroque, and does share many qualities of the Italian painting of the same period, although the poise and restraint derived from following classical ideas typically give it a very different overall mood.

==Sculpture==
{{Main|Baroque sculpture}}
[[File:Pierre Le Gros (II) - The Death of St Stanislas Kostka - WGA12562.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Stanislas Kostka]] on his deathbed'' by [[Pierre Le Gros the Younger]]]]

In Baroque sculpture, groups of figures assumed new importance and there was a dynamic movement and energy of human forms— they spiraled around an empty central vortex, or reached outwards into the surrounding space. For the first time, Baroque sculpture often had multiple ideal viewing angles. The characteristic Baroque sculpture added extra-sculptural elements, for example, concealed lighting, or water [[fountains]]. [[Aleijadinho]] in Brazil was also one of the great names of baroque sculpture, and his master work is the set of statues of the ''Santuário de Bom Jesus de Matosinhos'' in [[Congonhas]]. The soapstone sculptures of old testament prophets around the terrace are considered amongst his finest work.

The architecture, sculpture and fountains of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] (1598–1680) give highly charged characteristics of Baroque style. Bernini was undoubtedly the most important sculptor of the Baroque period. He approached [[Michelangelo Buonarroti|Michelangelo]] in his omnicompetence:  Bernini sculpted, worked as an architect, painted, wrote plays, and staged spectacles. In the late 20th century Bernini was most valued for his sculpture, both for his virtuosity in carving marble and his ability to create figures that combine the physical and the spiritual. He was also a fine sculptor of bust portraits in high demand among the powerful.

===Bernini's Cornaro chapel: the complete work of art===
A good example of Bernini's Baroque work is his ''[[Ecstasy of St Theresa|St. Theresa in Ecstasy]]'' (1645–52), created for the Cornaro Chapel of the church of [[Santa Maria della Vittoria]], Rome. Bernini designed the entire chapel, a subsidiary space along the side of the church, for the Cornaro family.

[[File:Estasi di Santa Teresa.jpg|thumb|[[Bernini]]'s ''[[Ecstasy of St Theresa|Ecstasy of St. Teresa]]'']]
[[File:Santa Maria della Vittoria - 4.jpg|thumb|Wider view, including the Cornaro portraits, but omitting the lower parts of the chapel]]
Saint Theresa, the focal point of the chapel, is a soft white marble statue surrounded by a polychromatic marble architectural framing. This structure conceals a window which lights the statue from above. Figure-groups of the Cornaro family sculpted in shallow relief inhabit opera boxes on the two side walls of the chapel. The setting places the viewer as a spectator in front of the statue with the Cornaro family leaning out of their box seats and craning forward to see the mystical ecstasy of the saint.

St. [[Teresa of Ávila|Theresa]] is highly idealized and in an imaginary setting. She was a popular saint of the [[Catholic Reformation]].  She wrote of her mystical experiences for an audience of the nuns of her [[Carmelite Order]];  these writings had become popular reading among lay people interested in spirituality. In her writings, she described the love of God as piercing her heart like a burning arrow. Bernini materializes this by placing St. Theresa on a cloud while a Cupid figure holds a golden arrow made of metal and smiles down at her. The angelic figure is not preparing to plunge the arrow into her heart— rather, he has withdrawn it. St. Theresa's face reflects not the anticipation of ecstasy, but her current fulfillment.

This work is widely considered a masterpiece of the Baroque, although the mix of religious and erotic imagery (faithful to St Teresa's own written account) may raise modern eyebrows.  However, Bernini was a devout Catholic and was not attempting to satirize the experience of a [[celibacy|chaste]] nun. Rather, he aimed to portray religious experience as an intensely physical one. Theresa described her bodily reaction to spiritual enlightenment in a language of ecstasy used by many mystics, and Bernini's depiction is earnest.

The Cornaro family promotes itself discreetly in this chapel;  they are represented visually, but are placed on the sides of the chapel, witnessing the event from balconies. As in an [[opera house]], the Cornaro have a privileged position in respect to the viewer, in their private reserve, closer to the saint; the viewer, however, has a better view from the front. They attach their name to the chapel, but St. Theresa is the focus. It is a private chapel in the sense that no one could say mass on the altar beneath the statue (in 17th century and probably through the 19th) without permission from the family, but the only thing that divides the viewer from the image is the altar rail. The spectacle functions both as a demonstration of mysticism and as a piece of family pride.

==Architecture==

[[File:Elewacja wschodnia.jpg|thumb|330px|Wilanów Palace in [[Warsaw]], Poland]]
In Baroque architecture, new emphasis was placed on bold [[massing]], [[colonnade]]s, [[dome]]s, light-and-shade (''[[chiaroscuro]]''), 'painterly' color effects, and the bold play of volume and void. In interiors, Baroque movement around and through a void informed monumental staircases that had no parallel in previous architecture. The other Baroque innovation in worldly interiors was the state apartment, a sequence of increasingly rich interiors that culminated in a presence chamber or throne room or a state bedroom. The sequence of monumental stairs followed by a state apartment was copied in smaller scale everywhere in aristocratic dwellings of any pretensions.

Baroque architecture was taken up with enthusiasm in central Germany (see, e.g., [[Ludwigsburg Palace]] and [[Zwinger]] Dresden), [[Austria]] and [[Russia]] (see, e.g., [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]]). In England the culmination of Baroque architecture was embodied in work by Sir [[Christopher Wren]], Sir [[John Vanbrugh]] and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], from ca. 1660 to ca. 1725. Many examples of Baroque architecture and town planning are found in other European towns, and in Latin America. Town planning of this period featured radiating avenues intersecting in squares, which took cues from [[History of gardening|Baroque garden plans]]. In Sicily, Baroque developed new shapes and themes as in Noto, [[Ragusa, Italy|Ragusa]] and [[Acireale]] "Basilica di San Sebastiano".

Another example of Baroque architecture is the Cathedral of Morelia Michoacan in Mexico. Built in the 17th century by Vincenzo Barrochio, it is one of the many Baroque cathedrals in Mexico. Baroque churches are also seen in the Philippines, which were built during the Spanish period.

Francis Ching described Baroque architecture as "a style of architecture originating in Italy in the early 17th century and variously prevalent in Europe and the New World for a century and a half, characterized by free and sculptural use of the classical orders and ornament, dynamic opposition and interpenetration of spaces, and the dramatic combined effects of architecture, sculpture, painting, and the decorative arts."<ref>Francis DK Ching, ''A Visual Dictionary of Architecture'', p.&nbsp;133</ref>

==Theatre==
[[File:Pietro Domenico Oliviero - The Royal Theater in Turin.jpg|thumb|200px|left|18th-century painting of the [[Teatro Regio (Turin)|Royal Theatre of Turin]]]]
In theatre, the elaborate conceits, multiplicity of plot turns, and variety of situations characteristic of [[Mannerism]] ([[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's tragedies]], for instance) were superseded by opera, which drew together all the arts into a unified whole.

Theatre evolved in the Baroque era and became a [[multimedia]] experience, starting with the actual architectural space. In fact, much of the technology used in current Broadway or commercial plays was invented and developed during this era. The stage could change from a romantic garden to the interior of a palace in a matter of seconds. The entire space became a framed selected area that only allows the users to see a specific action, hiding all the machinery and technology – mostly ropes and pulleys.

This technology affected the content of the narrated or performed pieces, practicing at its best the [[Deus ex Machina]] solution. Gods were finally able to come down – literally – from the heavens and rescue the hero in the most extreme and dangerous, even absurd situations.

The term Theatrum Mundi – the world is a stage – was also created. The social and political realm in the real world is manipulated in exactly the same way the actor and the machines are presenting/limiting what is being presented on stage, hiding selectively all the machinery that makes the actions happen.

The films ''[[Vatel (film)|Vatel]]'', ''[[Farinelli (film)|Farinelli]]'', and the staging of [[Monteverdi]]'s ''Orpheus'' at the [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]] in Barcelona, give a good idea of the style of productions of the Baroque period. The American musician [[William Christie (musician)|William Christie]] and [[Les Arts Florissants (ensemble)|Les Arts Florissants]] have performed extensive research on all the French Baroque Opera, performing pieces from [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier|Charpentier]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], among others that are extremely faithful to the original 17th century creations.

==Music==

[[File:Johann Sebastian Bach.jpg|thumb|[[Johann Sebastian Bach]], 1748]]

The term ''Baroque'' is also used to designate the style of music composed during a period that overlaps with that of Baroque art, but usually encompasses a slightly later period.

It is a still-debated question as to what extent Baroque music shares aesthetic principles with the visual and literary arts of the Baroque period. A fairly clear, shared element is a love of [[Ornament (art)|ornamentation]], and it is perhaps significant that the role of ornament was greatly diminished in both music and architecture as the Baroque gave way to the Classical period.

The application of the term "Baroque" to music is a relatively recent development, although it has recently been pointed out that the first use of the word "baroque" 
in criticism of any of the arts related to music, in an anonymous, satirical review of the première in October 1733 of Rameau’s ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]],'' printed in the ''Mercure de France'' in May 1734. The critic implied that the novelty in this opera was "du barocque," complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was filled with unremitting dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.{{sfn|Palisca|2001}}

However this was an isolated reference, and consistent use was only begun in 1919, by [[Curt Sachs]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sachs |first1=Curt |authorlink1=Curt Sachs |title=Barockmusik |trans_title=Baroque Music |series=Jahrbuch der Musikbibliothek Peters |volume=26 |year=1919 |publisher=Edition Peters |location=Leipzig |language=Deutsch |pages=7–15 }}</ref> and it was not until 1940 that it was first used in English (in an article published by [[Manfred Bukofzer]]).{{sfn|Palisca|2001}}

Many musical forms were born in that era, like the [[concerto]] and [[sinfonia]]. Forms such as the [[sonata]], [[cantata]] and [[oratorio]] flourished. Also, opera was born out of the experimentation of the [[Florentine Camerata]], the creators of [[monody]], who attempted to recreate the theatrical arts of the Ancient Greeks. An important technique used in baroque music was the use of [[ground bass]], a repeated bass line. ''Dido's Lament'' by [[Henry Purcell]] is a famous example of this technique.
