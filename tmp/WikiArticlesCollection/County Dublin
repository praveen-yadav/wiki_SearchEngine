'''County Dublin''' ({{lang-ga|Contae Bhaile Átha Cliath}} or ''Contae Átha Cliath'') is a [[Counties of Ireland|county]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is part of the [[Dublin Region]] and is in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Leinster]]. It is named after the city of [[Dublin]], which is the [[Capital city|capital]] of Ireland. County Dublin was one of the first parts of Ireland to be [[shire]]d by King [[John of England]] following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. The area of the county no longer has a single [[local authority]]; local government is now split between three authorities. The population of the county at large, which includes Dublin city, was 1,270,603 according to the census of 2011.<ref>[http://www.cso.ie/en/census/census2011preliminaryreport/ Census of Population 2011: Preliminary Results], Central Statistics Office. Retrieved 30 October 2011</ref>

==Dissolution==
It is no longer used for [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local government]] purposes in Ireland. In 1994, the [[administrative county]] (which did not include the [[county borough]] of Dublin) was dissolved and the area divided among the administrative counties of [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown]], [[Fingal]] and [[South Dublin]] each with its [[county town|county seat]]. To these areas may be added the area of Dublin city which collectively comprise the Dublin Region<ref name="r1">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZSI394Y1993.html|title=Local Government Act, 1991 (Regional Authorities) (Establishment) Order, 1993|accessdate=31 July 2009}}</ref> (''{{lang|ga|Réigiúin Átha Cliath}}'') and come under the remit of the Dublin Regional Authority.

The area lost its administrative [[county]] status in 1994, with Section 9 Part 1(a) of the ''Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993'' stating that "the county shall cease to exist."<ref>[[Act of the Oireachtas]]: [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0031/print.html#sec9 Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993 (Section 9 Part 1(a))]</ref><ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0031/print.html#sec2 Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993 Section 2] specifies: ''“the county”, in relation to any time before the establishment day, means the administrative county of Dublin.''</ref> At that time, and in response to a European Council report highlighting Ireland as the most centralised{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} country in the [[European Union]], it was decided that a single County Dublin was unmanageable and undemocratic from a [[local government]] perspective. In discussing the legislation to dissolve Dublin County Council, [[Avril Doyle]] [[Teachta Dála|TD]] said, "The Bill before us today effectively abolishes County Dublin, and as one born and bred in these parts of Ireland I find it rather strange that we in this House are abolishing County Dublin. I am not sure whether Dubliners realise that that is what we are about today, but in effect that is the case."<ref>[[Dáil Éireann]]: [http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0435/D.0435.199311030007.html Parliamentary Debates (3 November 1993)]</ref>

Despite the legal status of the Dublin Region, the term "County Dublin" is still in common usage. Many organisations and sporting teams continue to organise on a "County Dublin" or "Dublin Region" basis. The area formerly known as "County Dublin" is now defined in legislation solely as the "Dublin Region" under the ''Local Government Act, 1991 (Regional Authorities) (Establishment) Order, 1993'',<ref name="r1" /> and this is the terminology officially used by the four Dublin administrative councils in press releases concerning the former county area. The term ''[[Greater Dublin Area]]'', which might consist of some or all of the Dublin Region along with counties of [[County Kildare|Kildare]], [[County Meath|Meath]] and [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]], has no legal standing.

The latest [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] "Discovery Series" (Third Edition 2005) 1:50,000 map of the Dublin Region, Sheet 50, shows the boundaries of the city and three surrounding counties of the region. Extremities of the Dublin Region, in the north and south of the region, appear in other sheets of the series, 43 and 56 respectively.

==Irish language==
There are 10,469 Irish speakers in County Dublin attending the 31 [[Gaelscoil]]s (Irish language primary schools) and eight [[Gaelcholáiste]] (Irish language secondary schools).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/assets/Staitistic%C3%AD-2010-2011_Gaeilge.pdf|title=Oideachas Trí Mheán na Gaeilge in Éirinn sa Ghalltacht 2010-2011|year=2011|publisher=gaelscoileanna.ie|language=Irish|accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref> There may be up to another 10,000 Irish speakers from the Gaeltacht living and working in Dublin also.

Prior to the [[Act of the Oireachtas|enactment]] of the [[Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993]], the county was a unified whole even though its was administered by two [[Local authority|local authorities]] - [[Dublin County Council]] and [[Dublin Corporation]]. Since the enactment of the [[Local Government Act 2001]] in particular, the geographic area of the county has been divided between three entities at the level of "county" and a further entity at the level of "city". They rank equally as first level [[local administrative unit]]s of the [[NUTS 3 statistical regions of the Republic of Ireland|NUTS 3]] Dublin Region for [[Eurostat]] purposes. There are 34 [[NUTS of the Republic of Ireland#Local administrative units|LAU 1]] entities in the Republic of Ireland. Each [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] is responsible for certain local [[Public services|services]] such as [[sanitation]], [[planning]] and [[Real estate development|development]], [[library|libraries]], the collection of [[automobile|motor]] [[tax]]ation, local [[road]]s and [[social housing]]. 

The county is part of the [[Dublin (European Parliament constituency)|Dublin]] constituency for the purposes of [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]]. For elections to [[Dáil Éireann]], the area of the county is today divided into twelve constituencies: [[Dublin Central (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin Central]], [[Dublin Mid–West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin Mid–West]], [[Dublin North (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin North]], [[Dublin North–Central (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin North–Central]], [[Dublin North–East (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin North–East]], [[Dublin North–West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin North–West]], [[Dublin South (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin South]], [[Dublin South–Central (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin South–Central]], [[Dublin South–East (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin South–East]], [[Dublin South–West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin South–West]], [[Dublin West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin West]] and [[Dún Laoghaire (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dún Laoghaire]].  Together they return 47 deputies ([[Teachta Dála|TDs]]) to the Dáil.
