The timbre of musical instruments can be considered in the light of [[Fourier series|Fourier theory]] to consist of multiple [[harmonic]] or inharmonic ''[[harmonic series (music)|partials]]'' or [[overtones]]. Each partial is a sine wave of different [[frequency]] and [[amplitude]] that swells and decays [[ADSR envelope|over time]].

Additive synthesis generates sound by adding the output of multiple sine wave generators. It may also be implemented using pre-computed [[Wavetable synthesis|wavetables]] or inverse [[Fast Fourier transform]]s.

Harmonic additive synthesis is closely related to the concept of a [[Fourier series]] which is a way of expressing a [[periodic function]] as the sum of [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] functions with [[frequencies]] equal to integer multiples of a common [[fundamental frequency]].  These sinusoids are called [[harmonic]]s, [[overtone]]s, or generally, [[Harmonic_series_(music)#Partial|partials]].  In general, a Fourier series contains an infinite number of sinusoidal components, with no upper limit to the frequency of the sinusoidal functions and includes a [[direct current|DC]] component (one with frequency of 0 [[Hertz|Hz]]).  [[Equal-loudness contour|Frequencies outside of the human audible range]] can be omitted in additive synthesis.  As a result only a finite number of sinusoidal terms with frequencies that lie within the audible range are modeled in additive synthesis.

A waveform or function is said to be [[periodic function|periodic]] if

: <math> y(t) = y(t+P) \ </math>

for all <math> t \,</math> and for some period <math> P \,</math>.

The [[Fourier series]] of a periodic function is mathematically expressed as:

: <math> \begin{align}
  y(t) &= \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left[ a_k \cos(2 \pi k f_0 t ) - b_k \sin(2 \pi k f_0 t ) \right] \\
       &= \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} r_k \cos\left(2 \pi k f_0 t + \phi_k \right) \\
   \end{align} </math>

where

:: <math>f_0 = 1/P\,</math> is the [[fundamental frequency]] of the waveform and is equal to the reciprocal of the period,
:: <math>a_k = r_k \cos(\phi_k) = 2 f_0 \int_{0}^P y(t) \cos(2 \pi k f_0 t)\, dt, \quad k \ge 0\,</math>
:: <math>b_k = r_k \sin(\phi_k) = -2 f_0 \int_{0}^P y(t) \sin(2 \pi k f_0 t)\, dt, \quad k \ge 1\,</math>
:: <math>r_k = \sqrt{a_k^2 + b_k^2}\,</math> is the [[amplitude]] of the <math>k\,</math>th harmonic,
:: <math>\phi_k = \operatorname{atan2}(b_k, a_k)\,</math> is the [[phase (waves)|phase offset]] of the <math>k\,</math>th harmonic. [[atan2]](&nbsp;) is the four-quadrant [[arctangent]] function,

Being inaudible, the [[direct current|DC]] component, <math>a_0/2\,</math>, and all components with frequencies higher than some finite limit, <math>K f_0\,</math>, are omitted in the following expressions of additive synthesis.

===Harmonic form===
The simplest harmonic additive synthesis can be mathematically expressed as:

: {{NumBlk|:|<math>y(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k \cos\left(2 \pi k f_0 t + \phi_k \right)</math>,|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where <math>y(t)\,</math> is the synthesis output, <math>r_k\,</math>, <math>k f_0\,</math>, and <math>\phi_k\,</math> are the amplitude, frequency, and the phase offset, respectively, of the <math>k\,</math>th harmonic partial of a total of <math>K\,</math> harmonic partials, and <math>f_0\,</math> is the [[fundamental frequency]] of the waveform and the [[Piano key frequencies|frequency of the musical note]].

===Time-dependent amplitudes===

|}
More generally, the amplitude of each harmonic can be prescribed as a function of time, <math>r_k(t)\,</math>, in which case the synthesis output is

: {{NumBlk|:|<math>y(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(t) \cos\left(2 \pi k f_0 t + \phi_k \right)</math>.|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Each [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] <math>r_k(t)\,</math> should vary slowly relative to the frequency spacing between adjacent sinusoids.  The [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of <math>r_k(t)\,</math> should be significantly less than <math>f_0\,</math>.

===Inharmonic form===
Additive synthesis can also produce [[Inharmonicity|inharmonic]] sounds (which are [[aperiodic]] waveforms) in which the individual overtones need not have frequencies that are integer multiples of some common fundamental frequency.<ref name=smith05>

===Time-dependent frequencies===
In the general case, the [[instantaneous frequency]] of a sinusoid is the [[derivative]] (with respect to time) of the argument of the sine or cosine function.  If this frequency is represented in [[hertz]], rather than in [[angular frequency]] form, then this derivative is divided by <math>2 \pi\,</math>.  This is the case whether the partial is harmonic or inharmonic and whether its frequency is constant or time-varying.

In the most general form, the frequency of each non-harmonic partial is a non-negative function of time, <math>f_k(t)\,</math>, yielding

: {{NumBlk|:|<math>y(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(t) \cos\left(2 \pi \int_0^t f_k(u)\ du + \phi_k \right).</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

===Broader definitions===
''Additive synthesis'' has been used as an umbrella term for the class of sound synthesis techniques that sum simple elements to create more complex timbres, even when the elements are not sine waves.<ref>{{cite book

==Additive analysis/resynthesis==
It is possible to analyze the frequency components of a recorded sound giving a "sum of sinusoids" representation. This representation can be re-synthesized using additive synthesis. One method of decomposing a sound into time varying sinusoidal partials is [[Fourier Transform]]-based McAulay-Quatieri Analysis.<ref>R. J. McAulay and T. F. Quatieri (Aug 1986), "Speech analysis/synthesis based on a sinusoidal representation", IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, Signal Processing ASSP-34: 744-754
</ref><ref>[http://www.clear.rice.edu/elec301/Projects02/lorisFor/mqmethod2.html McAulay-Quatieri Method]</ref>

By modifying the sum of sinusoids representation, timbral alterations can be made prior to resynthesis. For example, a harmonic sound could be restructured to sound inharmonic, and vice versa. Sound hybridisation or "morphing" has been implemented by additive resynthesis.<ref name="XSerraPhD">

Additive synthesis is used in electronic musical instruments.

===Speech synthesis===

{{main|Speech synthesis}}

In [[linguistics]] research, harmonic additive synthesis was used in 1950s to play back modified and synthetic speech spectrograms.<ref name="cooper1951" /> Later, in early 1980s, listening tests were carried out on synthetic speech stripped of acoustic cues to assess their significance. Time-varying [[formant]] frequencies and amplitudes derived by [[linear predictive coding]] were synthesized additively as pure tone whistles. This method is called [[sinewave synthesis]].<ref name=remez81>

==Discrete-time equations==
In digital implementations of additive synthesis, [[discrete signal|discrete-time]] equations are used in place of the continuous-time synthesis equations.  A notational convention for discrete-time signals uses brackets i.e. <math>y[n]\,</math> and the argument <math>n\,</math> can only be integer values.  If the continuous-time synthesis output <math>y(t)\,</math> is expected to be sufficiently [[bandlimited]]; below half the [[sampling rate]] or <math>f_\mathrm{s}/2\,</math>, it suffices to directly sample the continuous-time expression to get the discrete synthesis equation. The continuous synthesis output can later be [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|reconstructed]] from the samples using a [[digital-to-analog converter]]. The sampling period is <math>T=1/f_\mathrm{s}\,</math>.

Beginning with ({{EquationNote|3}}),

: <math>y(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(t) \cos\left(2 \pi \int_0^t f_k(u)\ du + \phi_k \right)</math>

and sampling at discrete times <math> t = nT = n/f_\mathrm{s} \,</math> results in

:<math> \begin{align}
 y[n] & = y(nT) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(nT) \cos\left(2 \pi \int_0^{nT} f_k(u)\ du + \phi_k \right) \\
      & = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(nT) \cos\left(2 \pi \sum_{i=1}^{n} \int_{(i-1)T}^{iT} f_k(u)\ du + \phi_k \right) \\
      & = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(nT) \cos\left(2 \pi \sum_{i=1}^{n} (T f_k[i]) + \phi_k \right) \\
      & = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k[n] \cos\left(\frac{2 \pi}{f_\mathrm{s}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_k[i] + \phi_k \right) \\
       \end{align} </math>
where

: <math>r_k[n] = r_k(nT) \,</math> is the discrete-time varying amplitude envelope
: <math>f_k[n] = \frac{1}{T} \int_{(n-1)T}^{nT} f_k(t)\ dt \,</math> is the discrete-time [[Finite difference|backward difference]] instantaneous frequency.

This is equivalent to

: <math> y[n] = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k[n] \cos\left( \theta_k[n] \right) </math>

where

:<math> \begin{align}
    \theta_k[n] &= \frac{2 \pi}{f_\mathrm{s}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_k[i] + \phi_k \\
                &= \theta_k[n-1] + \frac{2 \pi}{f_\mathrm{s}} f_k[n] \\
       \end{align} </math> for all <math>n>0\,</math><ref name="RodetDepalle_FFTm1"/>
and
: <math> \theta_k[0] = \phi_k. \,</math>
