'''Berber''' or the '''Berber''' languages or dialects (Berber name: ''Tamaziɣt'', ''Tamazight'', {{lang|ber|ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵜ}} {{IPA-tam|tæmæˈzɪɣt], [θæmæˈzɪɣθ|}}) are a family of similar and closely related languages and dialects indigenous to [[North Africa]]. They are spoken by large populations in [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]], and by smaller populations in [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]],<ref>Mughal, Muhammad Aurang Zeb. 2012. Tunisia. Steven Danver (ed.), ''Native Peoples of the World: An Encyclopedia of Groups, Cultures, and Contemporary Issues'', Vol. 3. Armonk, NY: M. E. Sharpe, pp. 688-689.</ref> northern [[Mali]], western and northern [[Niger]], northern [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mauritania]], and in the [[Siwa Oasis]] of Egypt. Large Berber-speaking migrant communities have been living in Western Europe since the 1950s. In 2001, Berber became a constitutional national language of Algeria, and in 2011 Berber became a constitutionally official language of Morocco.

Berber constitutes a branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language family]],<ref>Hayward, Richard J., chapter ''Afroasiatic'' in Heine, Bernd & Nurse, Derek, editors, ''African Languages: An Introduction'' Cambridge 2000. ISBN 0-521-66629-5.</ref> and has been attested since ancient times. The number of [[Berber people|ethnic Berbers]] is much higher than the number of Berber speakers. The bulk of the populations of the [[Maghreb]] countries are considered to have Berber ancestors. In Algeria, for example, a majority of the population consists of [[Arabized Berber]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3509799.stm |title=BBC NEWS. Q&A: The Berbers |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-03-12 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>

There is a movement among speakers of the closely related varieties of Northern Berber to unite them under a [[standard language]]. The name ''Tamazight'', originally the self-name in the Atlas and the [[Rif]] regions, is being increasingly used for this Standardized Berber, and even for Berber as a whole, including Tuareg-Berber.

About 90 percent of the Berber-speaking population speak one of six major varieties of Berber, each with at least two million speakers. They are, in the order of demographic weight: [[Shilha language|Tashelhit]] (''Tacelḥit''), [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]] (''Taqbaylit''), [[Central Atlas Tamazight|Atlas Tamazight]] (''Tamaziɣt''), [[Riffian language|Riffian]] (''Tamaziɣt/Tarifit''), [[Shawiya language|Shawi]] (''Tacawit''), [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]] (''Tamahaq/Tamaceq'').

The Berber languages and dialects have had a written tradition, on and off, for over 2,200 years, although the tradition has been frequently disrupted by invasions. They were first written in the [[Tifinagh]] alphabet, still used by the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]. The oldest dated inscription is from about 200 BCE. Later, between about 1000 CE and 1500 CE, they were written in the [[Arabic script]], and since the 20th century in the [[Berber Latin alphabet]], especially among the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] and Riffian communities of Morocco and Algeria. The Berber Latin alphabet was also used by most European and Berber linguists during the 19th and 20th centuries. 

A modernized form of the Tifinagh alphabet was made official in Morocco in 2003. Algerians mostly use the Berber Latin alphabet. Mali and Niger recognize a Tuareg Berber Latin alphabet customized to the Tuareg phonological system. However, traditional Tifinagh is still used in those countries. Both Tifinagh and Berber-Latin alphabets are being increasingly used in Morocco and parts of Algeria, while the Arabic script has been abandoned by Berber writers.

==Terminology==
The term ''Berber'' has been used in Europe since at least the 17th century, and is still used today. It was borrowed from either the Arabic designation for these populations, البربر, ''al-Barbar'', see [[Berber (name)]]; or from the Roman and Greek denominations of the Berber people "Barbaricae".

Etymologically, the Berber root ''Mazigh'' (singular noun ''Amazigh'', feminine ''Tamazight'') means "free man", "noble man", or "defender". The feminine ''Tamazight'' traditionally referred specifically to the [[Riffian]] and [[Central Morocco Tamazight]] dialects. Many Berber linguists prefer to consider the term "Tamazight" as a pure Berber word to be used only in Berber text; while using the European word "Berber/ Berbero/ Berbère" in European texts to follow the traditions of European writings about the Berbers. European languages distinguish between the words "Berber" and "barbaric", while Arabic has the same word "al-barbari" for both meanings.

Some other Berber writers, especially in Morocco, prefer to refer to Berber with "Amazigh" when writing about it in French or English.

Traditionally, the term "Tamazight" (in various forms: "thamazighth", "tamasheq", "tamajeq", "tamahaq") was used by many Berber groups to refer to the language they spoke, including the Middle Atlas, the [[Riffian people|Riffians]], the [[Sened language|Sened]] in Tunisia, and the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]].
However, other terms were used by other groups; for instance,  some parts of  Algeria called their language "Taznatit"( [[Zenata|Zenati]]) or 'Shelha', while the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]]s called theirs "Taqbaylit", the inhabitants of [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] "Siwi". In Tunisia, the local Amazigh language is  usually referred to as "Shelha", a term which has been observed in Morocco as well.<ref>[http://www.rosettaproject.org/live/search/showpages?ethnocode=ZEN&doctype=detail&version=0&scale=six ]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref>

One group, the [[Linguasphere Observatory]], has attempted to introduce the [[neologism]] "Tamazic languages" to refer to the Berber languages.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Origin==
{{main|Proto-Berber}}
Berber is a member of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language family]].

Since modern Berber languages are relatively homogeneous, the date of the [[Proto-Berber]] language from which the modern group is derived was probably comparatively recent, comparable to the age of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] or [[Romance languages|Romance]] families.
By contrast, the split of the group from the other Afro-Asiatic sub-phyla is much earlier, and is sometimes associated with the Mesolithic [[Capsian culture]].<ref>

{{Main|Berber orthography}}
There are a number of different scripts with which Berber languages may be written. The choice of writing system is often based on politics rather than practical considerations.{{Citation needed|reason=this claim is plausible but unsourced|date=June 2013}}

==Status==
After independence, all the [[Maghreb]] countries to varying degrees pursued a policy of [[Arabization]], aimed partly at displacing French from its colonial position as the dominant language of education and literacy. Under this policy the use of the Amazigh / Berber languages was suppressed or even banned. This state of affairs has been contested by Berbers in Morocco and Algeria—especially [[Kabylie]]—and is now being addressed in both countries by introducing the Berber language in some schools and by recognizing Berber as a "[[national language]]" in Algeria,<ref>{{fr icon}} – [http://www.apn-dz.org/apn/french/constitution96/loi02_03.htm « Loi n° 02-03 portent révision constitutionnelle »], adopted on April 10, 2002, allotting in particular to "Tamazight" the status of national language.</ref> though not as an [[official language|official]] one. The 2011 constitution of Morocco makes "Amazight" an official language alongside Arabic. In Mali and Niger, there are a few schools that teach partially in [[Tamasheq languages|Tamasheq]].

Although Algeria considers Tamazight to be a national language, and regional councils in Libya's [[Nafusa Mountains]] affiliated with the [[National Transitional Council]] reportedly use the Berber dialect of [[Nafusi language|Nafusi]] and have called for it to be granted co-official status with Arabic in a prospective new constitution,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/26/libya-berber-idUKLDE74O19G20110526|agency=Reuters|date=26 May 2011|title=Libya's mountain Berber see opportunity in war|accessdate=5 July 2011|first=Matt|last=Robinson}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/world/africa/09berbers.html|date=8 August 2011|title=Amid a Berber Reawakening in Libya, Fears of Revenge|accessdate=10 August 2011|first=C.J.|last=Chivers|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Morocco is the only country where Tamazight is an [[official language]].

As areas of Libya south and west of [[Tripoli]] such as the Nafusa Mountains were liberated from the control of forces loyal to [[Muammar Gaddafi|Colonel Gaddafi]] in early summer 2011, Berber workshops and exhibitions sprang up to share and spread the Tamazight culture and language, after four decades during which there were severe punishments for speaking and writing Tamazight openly.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14026216 Waiting game for rebels in western Libya], BBC News, John Simpson, 5 July 2011</ref>

On June 17, 2011, King [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|Mohammed VI]] announced in a speech of new constitutional reform that "Tamazight" became an official language of Morocco alongside Arabic and will be used in all the administrations in the future.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110617/wl_africa_afp/moroccopoliticsunrest ]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref>

On April 30, 2012, Fatima Chahou, alias Tabaamrant, member of Morocco House of Representatives and famous former singer became the first one to [[Question time|ask questions]] and discuss the minister's answer in Tamazight inside the Parliament of Morocco.

== Population ==
<!-- NOTE: this section is intended only for estimates backed up by a referenced academic or academic organization. Many sites (eg<ref>http://www.libyamazigh.org/</ref> for Libya) make claims about population backed up neither by data nor by academic reputation. -->

The exact population of Berber speakers is hard to ascertain, since most North African countries do not record language data in their censuses. The [[Ethnologue]] provides a useful academic starting point; however, its bibliographic references are inadequate, and it rates its own accuracy at only B-C for the area. Early colonial censuses may provide better documented figures for some countries; however, these are also very much out of date.

: ''Few census figures are available; all countries (Algeria and Morocco included) do not count Berber languages. The 1972 Niger census reported Tuareg, with other languages, at 127,000 speakers. Population shifts in location and number, effects of urbanization and education in other languages, etc., make estimates difficult. In 1952, André Basset (LLB.4) estimated the number of Berberophones at 5,500,000. Between 1968 and 1978 estimates ranged from eight to thirteen million (as reported by Galand, LELB 56, pp. 107, 123-25); Voegelin and Voegelin (1977, p. 297) call eight million a conservative estimate. In 2006, {{Ill|fr|Salem Chaker}} estimated that the Berberophone populations of Kabylie and the three Moroccan groups numbered more than one million each; and that in Algeria, 12,650,000, or one out of three Algerians, speak a Berber language (Chaker 1984, pp. 8–9).''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isp.msu.edu/AfrLang/Berber-root.html |title=African Languages at Michigan State University (ASC) &#124; Michigan State University |publisher=Isp.msu.edu |date=2010-10-08 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>

[[File:Berber dialects in Morocco.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Map of Berber-speaking areas in Morocco]]
* '''Morocco''': In 1952, André Basset ("La langue berbère", ''Handbook of African Languages'', Part I, Oxford) estimated that a "small majority" of Morocco's population spoke Berber. The 1960 census claimed that 34 percent of Moroccans spoke Berber, including bi-, tri-, and quadrilinguals.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In 2000, [[Karl Prasse]] cited "more than half" in an interview conducted by Brahim Karada at Tawalt.com. According to the Ethnologue (by deduction from its Moroccan Arabic figures), the Berber-speaking population should be estimated at 35 percent or around 10.5 million speakers.<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/14/show_country.asp?name=Morocco The Ethnologe, Languages of Morocco]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> However, the figures it gives for individual languages only add up to 7.5 million, divided into three dialects:
** [[Riffian language|Rif Tamazight]] in North Morocco: 1.5 million speakers (1991)<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/14/show_language.asp?code=RIF The Ethnologue]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> ([[INALCO]] estimates the number at 3 million)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/rifain.html |title=Inalco Crb |publisher=Centrederechercheberbere.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>

** [[Central Morocco Tamazight|Atlas Tamazight]]: 3 million (1998)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=tzm |title=The Ethnologue |publisher=The Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref> (INALCO estimates the number at 4–5 million)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/tamazit.html |title=Inalco Crb |publisher=Centrederechercheberbere.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>

A survey included in the official Moroccan census of 2004 and published by several Moroccan newspapers gave the following figures: 34 percent of people in rural regions spoke a Berber language and 21 percent in urban zones did, the national average would be 28.4 percent or 8.52 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bladi.net/9229-marocain-berbere.html |title=Bladinet |publisher=Bladi.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref> It is possible, however, that the survey asked for the language "used in daily life" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://cfieljadida2009.blogvie.com/2008/12/11/les-derniers-chiffres-du-recensement-28-de-la-population-parlent-une-langue-amazighe/ |title=Al Bayane Newspaper, 10/07/2005 |publisher=Cfieljadida2009.blogvie.com |date=2005-10-07 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref> which would result of course in figures clearly lower than those of native speakers, as the language is not recognized for official purposes and many Berbers who live in an Arabic-speaking environment cannot use it in daily life; also the use of Berber in public was frowned upon until the 1990s and might affect the result of the survey.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Adding up the population (according to the official census of 2004) of the Berber-speaking regions as shown on a 1973 [[Languages of Morocco|map of the CIA]] results in at least 10 million speakers, not counting the numerous Berber population which lives outside these regions in the bigger cities.

[[Mohamed Chafik]] claims 80 percent of Moroccans are Berbers. It is not clear, however, whether he means "speakers of Berber languages" or "people of Berber descent".

The division of Moroccan Berber dialects in three groups, as used by The Ethnologue is common in linguistic publications, but is significantly complicated by local usage: thus Shilha is subdivided into Shilha of the Dra valley, Tasusit (the language of the Souss) and several other (mountain)-dialects. Moreover, linguistic boundaries are blurred, such that certain dialects cannot accurately be described as either Central Morocco Tamazight (spoken in the Central and eastern Atlas area) or Shilha.
* '''Algeria''': In 1906, the total population speaking Berber languages in Algeria (excluding the thinly populated Sahara) was estimated at 1,305,730 out of 4,447,149, i.e. 29 percent. [[File:Aires linguistiques du nord-est algérien.svg|180px|thumb|right| Central / East part of Algeria.]](Doutté & Gautier, ''Enquête sur la dispersion de la langue berbère en Algérie, faite par l'ordre de M. le Gouverneur Général'', Alger 1913.) The 1911 census, however, found 1,084,702 speakers out of 4,740,526, i.e. 23 percent; Doutté & Gautier suggest that this was the result of a serious undercounting of [[Shawiya language|Shawiya]] in areas of widespread [[bilingualism]]. A trend was noted for Berber groups surrounded by Arabic (as in [[Blida]]) to adopt Arabic, while Arabic speakers surrounded by Berber (as in Sikh ou Meddour near [[Tizi Ouzou]]) tended to adopt Berber. In 1952, André Basset estimated that about a third of Algeria's population spoke Berber. According to historian Charles-Robert Ageron in 1886, Algeria had around 1,2 million of Berber speakers and 1,1 million of Arab speakers. The Algerian census of 1966 found 2,297,997 out of 12,096,347 Algerians, or 19 percent, to speak "Berber". In 1980, Salem Chaker estimated that "in Algeria, 3,650,000, or one out of five Algerians, speak a Berber language" (Chaker 1984, pp.&nbsp;8–9). According to the Ethnologue,<ref>{{cite web|author=Ethnologue |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=DZ |title=Algeria |publisher=Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref> more recent estimates include 14 percent (corresponding to the total figures it gives for each Berber language added together, 4 million) and (by deduction from its Algerian Arabic figures) 29 percent (Hunter 1996). Most of these are accounted for by three dialects (percentages based on historical population data from appropriate dates):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.populstat.info/Africa/algeriac.htm |title=ALGERIA: population growth of the whole country |publisher=Populstat.info |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>
[[File:Berbères en Algérie occidentale.svg|180px|thumb|right| West / Central part of Algeria.]]
:* [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]: 2,540,000 = 9 percent (Ethnologue, 1995) – 6,000,000 = 20 percent (Ethnologue, 1998). Total for all countries (Ethnologue): 3,126,000. (Needless to say, the latter two figures, though cited by the same source, are mutually contradictory.) Mainly in Algiers, Bejaia, Tizi-Ouzou, Bouira, Setif and Boumerdes.
:* [[Shawiya language|Shawiya]]: ~ 2 million as of 2005,<ref>http://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/chaouia.html</ref> equivalent to 8.5 percent of the population. Mainly in Batna, Khenchela, Sétif, Souk Ahras, Oum-El-Bouaghi, Tebessa.
:* [[Shenwa language|Shenwa]], in the Dahra region, more precisely Jebel Chenoua in Algeria, just west of Algiers in the wilayas of Tipasa, the Chlef and Ain Defla. It is estimated at 56,300 speakers. Two main dialects: Beni Menacer, west and south of Mount Chenoua area, in Mount Chenoua area, 55,250 speakers.

: A fourth group, despite a very small population, accounts for most of the land area where Berber is spoken:
:* [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] 25,000 in Algeria (Ethnologue, 1987), mainly in the Ahaggar mountains of the Sahara. Most Tuareg live in Mali and Niger (see below). <!-- It is however not clear if those numbers actually include the Berber speakers of [[Tlemcen]] and [[Blida]] provinces. -->

Other Berber dialects spoken in Algeria include: the [[Blida|Tamazight of Blida]], the dialects of the Beni Snouss and Beni Bousaid villages in the wilaya of [[Tlemcen]], the Matmata Berber spoken in the [[Ouarsenis]] region, the [[Mozabite language]] spoken in the wilaya of Mzab region, the dialect of the [[Ouargla]] oasis.
* '''Tunisia''': Basset (1952) estimated about 1 percent, as did Penchoen (1968). According to the Ethnologue, there are only 26,000 speakers (1998) of a Berber language it calls "Djerbi", but which Tunisians call "Shelha", in Tunisia, all in the south around [[Djerba]] and [[Matmata, Tunisia|Matmata]]. The more northerly enclave of [[Sened (town)|Sened]] apparently no longer speaks Berber. This would make 0.3 percent of the population.
* '''Libya''': According to the Ethnologue (by deduction from its combined Libyan Arabic and Egyptian Arabic figures) the non-Arabic-speaking population, most of which would be Berber, is estimated at 4 percent (1991, 1996). However, the individual language figures it gives add up to 162,000, i.e. about 3 percent. This is mostly accounted for by the languages:
** [[Nafusi language|Nafusi]] in  Jabal [[Nafusa Mountains|Nafusa]] and [[Zuwara Berber]] in [[Zuwara]] in [[Tripolitania]] region:  184,000.<ref>{{cite web

** Tahaggart [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]] of [[Ghat, Libya|Ghat]]: 17,000 (Johnstone 1993).
* '''Egypt''': The oasis of [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] near the Libyan border speaks a Berber language; according to the Ethnologue, there are 5,000 speakers there (1995). Its population in 1907 was 3884 (according to the 1911 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''); the claimed lack of increase seems surprising.
* '''Mauritania''': According to the Ethnologue, only 200-300 speakers of [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] remain (1998). It also mentions [[Tamasheq]], but does not provide a population figure for it. Most non-Arabic speakers in Mauritania speak [[Niger–Congo languages]].
* '''Mali''': The Ethnologue counts 440,000 [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] (1991) speaking:
:: [[Tamasheq]]: 250,000
:: [[Tawallammat Tamajaq language|Tamajaq]]: 190,000
* '''Niger''': The Ethnologue counts 720,000 [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] (1998) speaking:
:: [[Tawallamat Tamajaq]]: 450,000
:: [[Tayart Tamajeq]]: 250,000
:: [[Tamahaq language|Tamahaq]]: 20,000
* '''Burkina Faso''': The Ethnologue counts 20,000–30,000 [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] ([[SIL International|SIL]] 1991), speaking {{Ill|fr|Kel Tamasheq}}. However the Ethnologue is very inaccurate here appearing to miss the largest group of Tamasheq in Burkina in the province of Oudalan. The Tamasheq speaking population of Burkina is nearer to 100,000 (2005), with around 70,000 Tamasheq speakers in the province of Oudalan, the rest mainly in Seno, Soum, Yagha, Yatenga and Kadiogo provinces. About 10 percent of Burkina Tamasheq speak a version of the Tawallamat dialect.
* '''Nigeria''': The Ethnologue notes the presence of "few" [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], speaking [[Tawallamat Tamajaq]].
* '''France''': The Ethnologue lists 860,000 speakers for Riffian and 537,000 speakers for Kabyle, 150,000 for [[Central Morocco Tamazight]], and no figures for Shilha. For the rest of Europe, it has no figures.
* '''Spain''': Tamazight is spoken amongst [[Melilla]]'s 80,000 inhabitants but there has been no census as to the percentage of its speakers. A minority of [[Ceuta]]'s inhabitants speak Berber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/document/berber/an/i1/i1.html#1 |title=Euromosaic -Berber (Tamazight) in Spain |publisher=Uoc.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>
* '''Israel''': Around two thousand mostly elderly Moroccan-born Israelis of [[Berber Jews|Berber Jewish]] descent use [[Judeo-Berber]] dialects (as opposed to Moroccan Jews who trace descent from Spanish-speaking [[Sephardi Jews]] [[Alhambra decree|expelled from Spain]], or Arabic-speaking Moroccan Jews).

Thus, judging by the not necessarily reliable Ethnologue, the total number of speakers of Berber languages in the [[Maghreb]] proper appears to lie anywhere between 16 and 25 million, depending on which estimate is accepted; if we take Basset's estimate, it could be as high as 30 million. The vast majority are concentrated in Morocco and Algeria. The Tuareg of the [[Sahel]] add another million or so.

While the masculine is unmarked, the feminine (also used to form [[diminutive]]s and [[singulative]]s, like an ear of wheat) is marked with the [[circumfix]] ''t...t''. Feminine plural takes a prefix ''t...'':
::afus → tafust
::udem → tudemt
::ixef → tixeft
::ifassen → tifassin

Berber languages have two types of [[Grammatical number|number]]: singular and [[plural]], of which only the latter is marked. Plural has three forms according to the type of nouns. The first, "regular" type is known as the "external plural"; it consists in changing the initial vowel of the noun, and adding a [[suffix]] ''-n'':
::afus → ifassen "hands"
::argaz → irgazen "men"
::ixef → ixfawen "heads"
::ul → ulawen "hearts"
The second form of the plural is known as the "broken plural". It involves only a change in the vowels of the word:
::adrar → idurar "mountain"
::agadir → igudar "wall / castle"
::abaghus → ibughas "monkey"
The third type of plural is a mixed form: it combines a change of vowels with the suffix ''-n'':<!--Sorry I can't see the difference with the first type! -->
::izi → izan "(the) fly"
::azur → izuran "roof"
::iziker → izakaren "rope"

Berber languages also have two types of states or [[grammatical case|cases]] of the [[noun]], organized [[Ergative case|ergatively]]: one is unmarked, while the other serves for the subject of a transitive verb and the object of a preposition, among other contexts. The former is often called ''free state'', the latter ''construct state''. The construct state of the noun derives from the free state through one of the following rules:
The first involves a vowel alternation, whereby the vowel ''a'' becomes ''u'':
::argaz → urgaz
::amghar → umghar
::adrar → udrar
The second involves the loss of the initial vowel, in the case of some feminine nouns:
::tamghart → temghart "woman / mature woman"
::tamdint → temdint "town"
::tarbat → terbat "girl"
The third involves the addition of a semi-vowel (''w'' or ''y'') word-initially:
::asif → '''w'''asif "river"
::aḍu → '''w'''aḍu "wind"
::iles → '''y'''iles "tongue"
::uccen → '''w'''uccen "wolf"
Finally, some nouns do not change for free state:
::taddart → taddart "house / village"
::tuccent → tuccent "female wolf"

The following table gives the forms for the noun ''amghar'' "old man / leader":

==Subclassification==
[[Image:Berber-map.png|right|450px|thumb|Modern Berber languages]]
There is so little data available on [[Guanche language|Guanche]] that any classification is necessarily uncertain; however, it is almost universally acknowledged as Afro-Asiatic on the basis of the surviving glosses, and widely suspected to be Berber. Much the same can be said of the language, sometimes called "[[Numidian language|Numidian]]", used in the Libyan or Libyco-Berber inscriptions around the turn of the Common Era, whose alphabet is the ancestor of [[Tifinagh]].

A listing of the other Berber languages is complicated by their closeness; there is little distinction between language and dialect. The primary difficulty of subclassification, however, list in the eastern Berber languages, where there is little agreement. Otherwise there is consensus on the outlines of the family:
* [[Eastern Berber]] (scope debated)
* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]]
** [[Zenati languages|Zenati]] (incl. Riff, Shawiya)
** [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]
** [[Atlas languages|Atlas]] (incl. Shilha, Tamazight)
* [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]
* [[Western Berber]] ([[Zenaga language|Zenaga]])

The various classifications differ primarily in what they consider to be Eastern Berber, and in how many varieties they recognize as distinct languages.

===Kossman (1999)===
[[Maarten Kossmann]] (1999) describes Berber as two [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]],
* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]] and
* [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]],
plus a few peripheral languages, spoken in isolated pockets largely surrounded by Arabic, that fall outside these continua, namely
* [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] and
* the Libyan and Egyptian varieties.
Within Northern Berber, however, he recognizes a break in the continuum between [[Zenati languages|Zenati]] and their non-Zenati neighbors; and in the east, he recognizes a division between [[Ghadamès language|Ghadamès]] and [[Awjila language|Awjila]] on the one hand and [[Sokna language|Sokna]] ([[Fuqaha, Libya]]), [[Siwa language|Siwa]], and [[Nafusi language|Djebel Nefusa]] on the other. The implied tree is:
* [[Nafusi language|Nafusi]]–[[Siwi language|Siwi]] languages (including Sokna)
* [[Ghadamès language|Ghadamès]]–[[Awjila language|Awjila]] languages
* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]]
** [[Zenati languages|Zenati]]
** [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]] and [[Atlas languages|Atlas]]
* [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]
* [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]]

===''Ethnologue''===
The Ethnologue, mostly following Aikhenvald and Militarev (1991), treats the eastern varieties differently:
* [[Guanche language|Guanche]]
* [[Eastern Berber languages|Eastern Berber]]
** [[Siwi language|Siwi]]
** [[Awjila–Sokna languages|Awjila–Sokna]]
* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]] (including Nafusi and Ghadames within Zenati)
* [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]
* [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]]

===Blench (2006)===
[[Roger Blench|Blench]] (ms, 2006) has the following classification:<ref>[http://rogerblench.info/Language/Afroasiatic/General/AALIST.pdf AA list], Blench, ms, 2006</ref>
* [[Guanche language|Guanche]]†
* [[East Numidian language|East Numidian]] † [= Old Libyan]
* '''Berber'''

and within Berber,
* [[Eastern Berber]]
** [[Siwa language|Siwa]]
** [[Awjila language|Awjila]]
** [[Sokna language|Sokna]]
** [[Ghadames language|Ghadames]]
* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]] (including Nafusi within Zenati)
* [[Tuareg languages|Twareg]]
* [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]]

==Influence on other languages==
The Berber languages have influenced [[Maghrebi Arabic]] dialects, such as Moroccan, Algerian and Tunisian Arabic. Their influence is also seen in some languages in Sub-Saharan Africa. F. W. H. Migeod<ref>Migeod, F. W. H., ''The Languages of West Africa''. Kegan, Paul, Trench & Trübner, London 1913. pages 232, 233.</ref> pointed to strong resemblances between Berber and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] in such words and phrases as these: Berber: '''ya mut'''; Hausa ''ya mutu'' (he died); Berber: '''obanis'''; Hausa ''obansa'' (his father); Berber: '''a bat'''; Hausa ''ya bata'' (he was lost); Berber: '''eghare'''; Hausa ''ya kirra'' (he called). In addition he notes that the genitive in both languages is formed with '''n''' = "of".

==Examples of basic Berber words==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
The Berber letter "'''c'''" is pronounded like the English "'''sh'''".

The Berber "'''x'''" is pronounced like the Spanish "'''j'''" or the German "'''ch'''" in ''doch''.

The Berber "'''ɣ'''" is pronounced like the French or German "'''r'''".
