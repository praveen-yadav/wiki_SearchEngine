The '''Celtic languages''' (usually [[Pronunciation of Celtic|pronounced]] {{IPAc-en||ˈ|k|ɛ|l|t|ɪ|k}} but sometimes {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|l|t|ɪ|k}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/celtic|title=American Heritage Dictionary. Celtic: kel-tik, sel |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref> are descended from [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]], or "Common Celtic"; a branch of the greater [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]]. The term "Celtic" was first used to describe this language group by [[Edward Lhuyd]] in 1707.<ref>Cunliffe, Barry W. 2003. ''The Celts: a very short introduction.'' pg.48</ref>

Celtic languages are most commonly spoken on the north-western edge of [[Europe]], notably in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Brittany]], [[Cornwall]], and the [[Isle of Man]], and can be found spoken on [[Cape Breton Island]]. There are also a substantial number of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] speakers in the Patagonia area of Argentina. Some people speak Celtic languages in the other [[Celtic diaspora]] areas of the United States,<ref name="mla">[http://www.mla.org/map_data_states&mode=lang_tops&lang_id=636 "Language by State – Scottish Gaelic"] on ''Modern Language Association'' website.

Retrieved 5 August 2008</ref> In all these areas, the Celtic languages are now only spoken by minorities though there are continuing efforts at [[Language revitalization|revitalization]]. Welsh is the only Celtic language that isn't classified as "endangered" by [[UNESCO]].

During the 1st millennium BC, they were spoken across Europe, in the Iberian Peninsula, from the Atlantic and [[North Sea]] coastlines, up the [[Rhine]] valley and down the [[Danube]] valley to the [[Black Sea]], the [[Balkans|Upper Balkan Peninsula]], and in [[Galatia]] in [[Asia Minor]]. The spread to Cape Breton and Patagonia occurred in modern times. Celtic languages, particularly Irish, were spoken in Australia before federation in 1901 and are still used there to some extent.<ref>G. Leitner, Australia's Many Voices: Australian English--The National Language, 2004, pg. 74</ref>

==Living languages==
[[SIL Ethnologue]] lists six "living" Celtic languages, of which four have retained a substantial number of native speakers. These are the [[Goidelic]] [[Irish language|Irish]] (Gaeilge) and [[Scottish Gaelic]] (Gàidhlig) descended from [[Old Irish]], and the [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]] [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Breton language|Breton]] descended from the [[Common Brittonic|British language]].

The other two, [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Manx language|Manx]], were spoken into modern times but later died as spoken community languages.<ref>{{cite book|last=Koch|first=John T.|title= Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia|publisher= ABC-CLIO|year= 2006|pages=34, 365–366, 529, 973, 1053|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Celtic+Culture:+A+Historical+Encyclopedia#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A brief history of the Cornish language|url=http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=38590#Revival|publisher=Maga Kernow}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Beresford Ellis|first=Peter|title=The Story of the Cornish Language|year=1990, 1998, 2005|publisher=Tor Mark Press|isbn=0-85025-371-3|pages=20–22}}</ref> For both these languages, however, [[Language revitalization|revitalization]] movements have led to the adoption of these languages by adults and children and produced some native speakers.<ref name="iomtoday.co.im">{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/manx-language/Fockle-ny-ghaa-schoolchildren-take.3901786.jp|title=Fockle ny ghaa: schoolchildren take charge|publisher=Iomtoday.co.im|accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='South West:TeachingEnglish:British Council:BBC|url=http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/uk-languages/south-west|accessdate=9 February 2010|publisher=BBC|year=2010|work=BBC/British Council website}}</ref>

* [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]], including the living languages [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Manx language|Manx]], and [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]].

Scholarly handling of the Celtic languages has been rather argumentative owing to scarceness of primary source data. Some scholars (such as Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; and Schrijver 1995) distinguish [[Continental Celtic languages|Continental Celtic]] and [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]], arguing that the differences between the Goidelic and Brythonic languages arose after these split off from the Continental Celtic languages. Other scholars (such as Schmidt 1988) distinguish between [[#P-Celtic and Q-Celtic|P-Celtic and Q-Celtic]], putting most of the Gaulish and Brythonic languages in the former group and the Goidelic and Celtiberian languages in the latter. The P-Celtic languages (also called [[Gallo-Brittonic]]) are sometimes seen (for example by Koch 1992) as a central innovating area as opposed to the more conservative peripheral Q-Celtic languages.

The Breton language is Brythonic, not Gaulish, though there may be some input from the latter.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Barbour and Carmichael|first=Stephen and Cathie |title=Language and nationalism in Europe|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=56|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1ixmu8Iga7gC&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=Breton+Gaulish+words&q=Breton%20Gaulish%20words|isbn=978-0-19-823671-9}}</ref> When the [[Anglo-Saxons]] moved into [[Great Britain]], several waves of the native [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] crossed the [[English Channel]] and landed in [[Brittany]]. They brought with them their Brythonic language, which evolved into Breton – still partially intelligible by modern Welsh and Cornish speakers.

In the P/Q classification schema, the first language to split off from Proto-Celtic was Gaelic. It has characteristics that some scholars see as archaic, but others see as also being in the Brythonic languages (see Schmidt). In the Insular/Continental classification schema, the split of the former into Gaelic and Brythonic is seen as being late.

The distinction of Celtic into these four sub-families most likely occurred about 900 BC according to Gray and Atkinson<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature02029|last=Gray and Atkinson|first1=RD|last2=Atkinson|first2=QD|title=Language-tree divergence times support the Anatolian theory of Indo-European origin|journal=Nature|volume=426|issue=6965|pages=435–439|year=2003|pmid=14647380|bibcode=2003Natur.426..435G}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2003.tb00299.x|last=Rexova|first=K.|coauthors= Frynta, D and Zrzavy, J.|year=2003|title=Cladistic analysis of languages: Indo-European classification based on lexicostatistical data|journal=Cladistics|volume=19|issue=2|pages=120–127}}</ref> but, because of estimation uncertainty, it could be any time between 1200 and 800 BC. However, they only considered Gaelic and Brythonic. The controversial paper by Forster and Toth<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Forster|first=Peter |coauthors=Toth, Alfred |year=2003|title=Toward a phylogenetic chronology of ancient Gaulish, Celtic, and Indo-European|publisher=The National Academy of Sciences}}</ref> included Gaulish and put the break-up much earlier at 3200 BC ± 1500 years. They support the Insular Celtic hypothesis. The early Celts were commonly associated with the archaeological [[Urnfield culture]], the [[Hallstatt culture]], and the [[La Tène culture]], though the earlier assumption of association between language and culture is now considered to be less strong.<ref name=Renfrew>{{cite book|last1=Renfrew|first1=Colin|title=Archaeology and Language: The Puzzle of Indo-European Origins|year=1987|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|isbn=0224024957|language=English}}</ref><ref name=James>{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Simon|title=The Atlantic Celts: Ancient People or Modern Invention?|year=1999|publisher=British Museum Press|location=London|isbn=0714121657|language=English}}</ref>

[[Image:Celtic Nations.svg|right|thumb|175px|The [[Celtic nations]] where most Celtic speakers are now concentrated]]
{{anchor|P-Celtic}}{{anchor|Q-Celtic}}{{anchor|P-Celtic and Q-Celtic}}There are two main competing schemata of categorization. The older schema, argued for by Schmidt (1988) among others, links Gaulish with Brythonic in a '''P-Celtic''' node, originally leaving just Goidelic as '''Q-Celtic'''. The difference between P and Q languages is the treatment of [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] *''kʷ'', which became *''p'' in the P-Celtic languages but *''k'' in Goidelic. An example is the Proto-Celtic verb root *''kʷrin-'' "to buy", which became ''pryn-'' in Welsh but ''cren-'' in [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]]. However, a classification based on a single feature is seen as risky by its critics, particularly as the sound change occurs in other language groups (especially the [[Osco-Umbrian languages|Osco-Umbrian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]).

The other schema, defended for example by McCone (1996), links Goidelic and Brythonic together as an [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] branch, while Gaulish and Celtiberian are referred to as [[Continental Celtic languages|Continental Celtic]]. According to this theory, the "P-Celtic" sound change of {{IPA|[kʷ]}} to {{IPA|[p]}} occurred independently or [[areal feature|areally]]. The proponents of the Insular Celtic hypothesis point to other shared innovations among Insular Celtic languages, including inflected prepositions, VSO word order, and the lenition of intervocalic {{IPA|[m]}} to {{IPA|[β̃]}}, a [[nasalization|nasalised]] [[voiced bilabial fricative]] (an extremely rare sound{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}). There is, however, no assumption that the Continental Celtic languages descend from a common "Proto-Continental Celtic" ancestor. Rather, in the Insular/Continental schema, Celtiberian is usually considered to be the first branch to split from Proto-Celtic, and the remaining group would later have split into Gaulish and Insular Celtic.

There are legitimate scholarly arguments in favour of both the Insular Celtic hypothesis and the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic hypothesis. Proponents of each schema dispute the accuracy and usefulness of the other's categories. However, since the 1970s the division into Insular and Continental Celtic has become the more widely held view (Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; Schrijver 1995), but in the middle of the 1980s, the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic hypothesis found new supporters (Lambert 1994), because of the inscription on the Larzac piece of lead (1983), the analysis of which reveals another common phonetical innovation ''-nm-'' → ''-nu'' (Gaelic ''ainm'' / Gaulish ''anuana'', Old Welsh ''enuein'' "names"), that is less accidental than only one. The discovery of a third common innovation, would allow the specialists to come to the conclusion of a [[Gallo-Brittonic|Gallo-Brythonic]] dialect (Schmidt 1986; Fleuriot 1986).

The interpretation of this and further evidence is still quite contested, and the main argument in favour of Insular Celtic is connected with the development of the verbal morphology and the syntax in Irish and British Celtic, which Schumacher regards as convincing, while he considers the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic division unimportant and treats Gallo-Brittonic as an outdated hypothesis.<ref name=Schumacher>{{cite book|last1=Schumacher|first1=Stefan|last2=Schulze-Thulin|first2=Britta|last3=aan de Wiel|first3=Caroline|title=Die keltischen Primärverben.

When referring only to the modern Celtic languages, since no Continental Celtic language has living descendants, "Q-Celtic" is equivalent to "Goidelic" and "P-Celtic" is equivalent to "Brythonic".

Within the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family, the Celtic languages have sometimes been placed with the [[Italic languages]] in a common [[Italo-Celtic]] subfamily, a hypothesis that is now largely discarded, in favour of the assumption of [[language contact]] between pre-Celtic and pre-Italic communities.

How the family tree of the Celtic languages is ordered depends on which hypothesis is used:

==Characteristics of Celtic languages==
{{Technical|date=March 2008}}
Although there are many differences between the individual Celtic languages, they do show many family resemblances. While none of these characteristics are necessarily unique to the Celtic languages, there are few if any other languages which possess them all. They include:

*[[consonant mutation]]s (Insular Celtic only)
*[[inflected preposition]]s (Insular Celtic only)
*two [[grammatical gender]]s (modern Insular Celtic only; Old Irish and the Continental languages had three genders){{citation needed|date=September 2012}} 
*a [[vigesimal]] number system (counting by twenties)
**e.g. Cornish ''whetek ha dew ugens'' "fifty-six" (literally "sixteen and two twenty")
*verb–subject–object (VSO) word order (probably Insular Celtic only)
*an interplay between the subjunctive, future, imperfect, and habitual, to the point that some tenses and moods have ousted others
*an impersonal or autonomous verb form serving as a [[passive voice|passive]] or [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]]
**Welsh ''dysgaf'' "I teach" vs. ''dysgir'' "is taught, one teaches", Irish "déanaim" "I do/make" vs. "déantar" "is done"
*no [[infinitive]]s, replaced by a quasi-nominal verb form called the verbal noun or verbnoun
*frequent use of vowel mutation as a morphological device, e.g. formation of plurals, verbal stems, etc.
*use of preverbal particles to signal either subordination or illocutionary force of the following clause
**mutation-distinguished subordinators/relativisers
**[[Grammatical particle|particle]]s for [[Negation (linguistics)|negation]], interrogation, and occasionally for affirmative declarations
*[[infix]]ed pronouns positioned between particles and verbs
*lack of simple verb for the [[Imperfective aspect|imperfective]] "have" process, with possession conveyed by a composite structure, usually BE + preposition
**Cornish ''yma kath dhymm'' "I have a cat", literally "there is a cat to me"
*use of [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] phrases to express verbal tense, voice, or [[Grammatical aspect|aspectual]] distinctions
*distinction by function of the two versions of BE verbs traditionally labelled substantive (or existential) and [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]
*bifurcated [[demonstrative]] structure
*suffixed pronominal supplements, called confirming or supplementary pronouns
*use of singulars and/or special forms of counted nouns, and use of a singulative suffix to make singular forms from plurals, where older singulars have disappeared

Examples:<br>
(Irish) ''Ná bac le mac an bhacaigh is ní bhacfaidh mac an bhacaigh leat.''<br>
(Literal translation) Don't bother with son the beggar's and not will-bother son the beggar's with-you.
*''bhacaigh'' is the genitive of ''bacach''. The ''igh'' the result of [[affection (linguistics)|affection]]; the ''bh'' is the [[lenition|lenited]] form of ''b''.
*''leat'' is the second person singular inflected form of the preposition ''le''.
*The order is verb–subject–object (VSO) in the second half. Compare this to English or French (and possibly Continental Celtic) which are normally subject–verb–object in word order.

(Welsh) ''pedwar ar bymtheg a phedwar ugain''<br>
(literally) four on fifteen and four twenties
*''bymtheg'' is a mutated form of ''pymtheg'', which is ''pump'' ("five") plus ''deg'' ("ten"). Likewise, ''phedwar'' is a mutated form of ''pedwar''.
*The multiples of ten are ''deg, ugain, deg ar hugain, deugain, hanner cant, trigain, deg a thrigain, pedwar ugain, deg a phedwar ugain, cant''.
