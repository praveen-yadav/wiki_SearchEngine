In [[collagen]], the '''collagen helix''', or type-2 helix, is a major shape in [[secondary structure]]. It consists of a [[triple helix]] made of the repetitious [[amino acid]] sequence [[glycine]] - X - Y, where X and Y are frequently [[proline]] or [[hydroxyproline]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bhattacharjee A, Bansal M |title=Collagen structure: the Madras triple helix and the current scenario |journal=IUBMB Life |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=161–72 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=16036578 |doi=10.1080/15216540500090710}}</ref>
Each of the three chains is stabilized by the [[steric repulsion]] due to the [[pyrrolidine]] rings of [[proline]] and [[hydroxyproline]] [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]s. The pyrrolidine rings keep out of each other’s way when the [[polypeptide]] chain assumes this extended [[helical]] form, which is much more open than the tightly coiled form of the [[alpha helix]].
The three chains are [[hydrogen bond]]ed to each other. The [[Hydrogen_bonding#Bonding|hydrogen bond donors]] are the [[peptide]] NH groups of [[glycine]] residues. The [[Hydrogen_bonding#Bonding|hydrogen bond acceptors]] are the CO groups of residues on the other chains. The OH group of [[hydroxyproline]] also participates in hydrogen bonding. The rise of the collagen helix ([[superhelix]]) is 2.9 Å (0.29&nbsp;nm) per residue.
