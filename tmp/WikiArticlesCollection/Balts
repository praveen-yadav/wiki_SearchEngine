The '''Balts''' or '''Baltic''' peoples ({{lang-lt|baltai}}, {{lang-lv|balti}}) are an [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[ethnolinguistics|ethno-linguistic]] group who speak the [[Baltic languages]], a branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] family, which was originally spoken by tribes living in area east of [[Jutland]] peninsula in the west and [[Moscow River|Moscow]], [[Oka River|Oka]] and [[Volga]] rivers basins in the east. One of the features of Baltic languages is the number of conservative or archaic features retained.<ref>Bojtár page 18.</ref> Among the Baltic peoples are modern [[Lithuanians]], [[Latvians]] (including [[Latgalians (modern)|Latgalians]]) — all Eastern Balts — as well as the [[Old Prussians]], [[Yotvingians]] and [[Galindians]] — the Western Balts — whose people also survived, but their languages and cultures are now extinct, and are now being assimilated into the Eastern Baltic community.

==Etymology==

[[Adam of Bremen]] was the first writer to use the term Baltic in its modern sense to mean the sea of that name.<ref name=Bot_9>Bojtár page 9.</ref> Although he must have been familiar with the ancient name, Balcia,<ref>Balcia, Abalcia, Abalus, Basilia, Balisia. The linguistic problem with these names is that Balcia cannot become Baltia by known rule.</ref>  meaning a supposed island in the Baltic Sea,<ref name=Bot_9/> and although he may have been aware of the Baltic words containing the stem balt-, "white",<ref>{{lang-lv|balti}}; {{lang-lt|baltai}}; [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]]: ''bolti'', lit. ''"white"''.</ref> as "swamp", he reports that he followed the local use of balticus from baelt ("belt") because the sea stretches to the east "in modum baltei" ("in the manner of a belt"). This is the first reference to "the Baltic or Barbarian Sea, a day's journey from [[Hamburg]]."<ref>Bojtár cites ''Bremensis'' I,60 and IV,10.</ref>

The Germanics, however, preferred some form of "East Sea" (in different languages) until after about 1600, when they began to use forms of "Baltic Sea." Around 1840 the German nobles of the [[Governorate of Livonia]] devised the term "Balts" to mean themselves, the German upper classes of Livonia, excluding the Latvian and Estonian lower classes. They spoke an exclusive dialect, Baltic German. For all practical purposes that was the Baltic language until 1919.<ref>Bojtár page 10.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The New Eastern Europe|first=Ralph|last=Butler|year=1919|pages=3, 21, 22, 23, 24|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|location=London}}</ref>
[[Scandinavia]]ns begin settling in Western Baltic lands in [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]].

Meanwhile in 1845 [[Georg Heinrich Ferdinand Nesselmann]] proposed a distinct language group for [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] to be called Baltic.<ref>{{cite journal|first=William R.|last=Schmalstieg|title=A. Sabaliauskas. Mes Baltai (We Balts)|journal=Lituanus: Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences|volume=33|date=Fall 1987|publisher=Lituanus Foundation Incorporated|url=http://www.lituanus.org/1987/87_3_09.htm|accessdate=2008-09-06|issue=3| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080907231232/http://www.lituanus.org/1987/87_3_09.htm| archivedate= 7 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} Book review.</ref> It found some credence among linguists but was not generally adopted until the creation of the [[Baltic states]] as part of the settlement of [[World War I]] in 1919. Gradually the non-Baltic [[Estonian language|Estonian]] was excluded from the [[linguistic meaning]] of Baltic, as was [[Livonians|Livonian]], a now rare [[Finnic languages|Finnic language]] in Latvia, while [[Old Prussian]] — long recognized as close to Lithuanian and Latvian — was added. [[Estonia]] and [[Finland]] (the states of [[Baltic Finns]]), however, also became counted among the [[Baltic states]] in the geopolitical sense.  (Finland was dropped from this definition after [[World War II]], though Estonia remains within the definition.)

==History==

===Origins===
The Balts or Baltic peoples, defined as speakers of one of the Baltic languages, a branch of the Indo-European language family, are descended from a group of Indo-European tribes who settled the area between the lower Vistula and upper Daugava and Dnieper rivers on the southeast shore of the Baltic Sea. Because the thousands of lakes and swamps in this area contributed to the Balts' geographical isolation, the Baltic languages retain a number of conservative or archaic features.

It is possible that around 3,500–2,500 B.C., there was massive migration of peoples representing the [[Corded Ware culture]]. They came from the southeast and spread all across Eastern and Central Europe, reaching even southern Finland. It is believed that [[Corded Ware culture]] peoples were [[Indo-European]] ancestors of many Europeans, including Balts. It is thought that those Indo-European newcomers were quite numerous and in the Eastern Baltic assimilated earlier indigenous cultures (Europidic cultures – [[Narva culture]] and [[Neman culture]]). Over time the new people formed the Baltic peoples and they spread in the area from the Baltic sea in the west to the [[Volga]] in the east.

Some of the major authorities on Balts, such as [[Kazimieras Būga|Būga]], [[Max Vasmer|Vasmer]], [[Toporov]] and Trubachov, in conducting etymological studies of eastern European river names, were able to identify in certain regions names of specifically Baltic provenance, which most likely indicate where the Balts lived in prehistoric times. This information is summarized and synthesized by [[Marija Gimbutas]] in ''The Balts'' (1963) to obtain a likely proto-Baltic homeland. Its borders are approximately: from a line on the [[Pomerania]]n coast eastward to include or nearly include the present-day sites of [[Berlin]], [[Warsaw]], [[Kiev]], and [[Kursk]], northward through [[Moscow]] to the River Berzha, westward in an irregular line to the coast of the Gulf of Riga, north of [[Riga]].

===Proto-history===
In 98 AD [[Tacitus]] described one of the tribes living near the Baltic Sea (''Mare Svebicum'') as ''Aestiorum gentes'' and [[amber]] gatherers. It is believed that these peoples were inhabitants of the [[Sambia (Baltic)|Sambian]] peninsula, although no other contemporary sources exist.

This homeland includes all historical Balts, and every location where Balts are thought to have been at different periods in time. Over time, the huge area of Baltic habitation shrank, due to assimilation by other groups, and invasions. According to one of the theories which has gained considerable traction over the years, one of the western Baltic tribes, [[Galindians]], [[Galindae]], or Goliad, migrated to the Eastern end of Baltic realm around the 4th century AD, and settled around modern day Moscow, Russia. Finally, according to Slavic chronicles of the time, they warred with [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], and perhaps, were defeated and assimilated some time in the 11th to 13th centuries.

Balts became differentiated into Western and Eastern Balts in the late centuries BC. The eastern Baltic region was inhabited by ancestors of [[Western Balts]] – [[Old Prussians]], [[Sudovians]]/[[Jotvingians]], [[Scalvians]], [[Nadruvians]], and [[Curonians]]. Meanwhile, Eastern Balts were living in modern day Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Subsequent [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] and [[Goths|Gothic]] domination in the first half of the first millennium AD in Northern and Eastern Europe, as well as later Slavic expansion, caused large migrations of the Balts — first, [[Galindae]] or [[Galindians]] to the east, and later, Eastern Balts to the west — until they reached the ethnographic area of the Balts as we know it, since 13th and 14th centuries. Many other Eastern and Southern Balts either assimilated with other Balts, or contributed to the formation of the Slavs in the 4th–7th centuries, and were gradually slavicized.

===Middle Ages===
In the 12th and the 13th centuries, internal struggles, as well as invasions by [[Ruthenians]] and [[Poles]] and later the expansion of the [[Teutonic Order]] resulted in an almost complete annihilation of the Galindians, Curonians, and Yotvingians. Gradually Old Prussians became [[Germanization|Germanized]] or some Lithuanized during period from the 15th to the 17th centuries, especially after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in [[Prussia]]. The cultures of the Lithuanians and Latgalians/Latvians survived and became the ancestors of the populations of the modern countries of [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].

Old Prussian was closely related to the other extinct Western [[Baltic language]]s, [[Curonian language|Curonian]], [[Galindian language|Galindian]] and [[Sudovian language|Sudovian]]. It is more distantly related to the surviving Eastern [[Baltic language]]s, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]]. Compare the Prussian word ''seme'' (''zemē''),<ref name="Lie">Mikkels Klussis. ''Bāziscas prûsiskai-laîtawiskas wirdeîns per tālaisin laksikis rekreaciônin [http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/prussian/Lie.pdf Donelaitis.vdu.lt] (Lithuanian version of [http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/prussian/Engl.pdf Donelaitis.vdu.lt).]</ref> the Latvian ''zeme'', the Lithuanian ''žemė''.

Old Prussian contained a few borrowings specifically from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] (e.g., Old Prussian ''ylo'' "awl," as with Lithuanian ''ýla'', Latvian ''īlens'') and even [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]].
