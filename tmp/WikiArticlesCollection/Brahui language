'''Brahui''' or '''Bráhuí'''<ref name="University of Balochistan"/> {{IPAc-en|b|r|ə|ˈ|h|uː|ɪ}}<ref>{{OED|Brahui}}</ref> (Brahui: براہوی ''brāhvī'') is a [[Dravidian language]] spoken by the [[Brahui people]] in the central [[Balochistan]] region of [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and by expatriate Brahui communities in [[Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Iraq]], and [[Iran]]. It is isolated from the nearest Dravidian-speaking neighbour population of [[South India]] by a distance of more than {{convert|1500|km}}.<ref name="Parkin37">{{harvnb|Parkin|1989|p=37}}</ref> [[Kalat District|Kalat]] and [[Mastung District|Mastung]] districts of Balochistan are predominantly Brahui-speaking.

==Distribution==
Brahui is spoken in the central part of Pakistani Balochistan, mainly in [[Kalat District|Kalat]] and [[Mastung District|Mastung]] districts but also in smaller numbers in neighboring districts, as well as in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iran]] which border Pakistani Balochistan; however, many members of the ethnic group [[language attrition|no longer speak]] Brahui.<ref name="Parkin37"/> The 2013 edition of [[Ethnologue]] reports that there are some 4.2 million speakers; 4 million live in Pakistan, mainly in the province of Balochistan.<ref name="e17"/>

==Classification==
Brahui belongs, with [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]] (Oraon) and [[Malto language|Malto]], to the northern subfamily of the Dravidian family of languages. It has been influenced by the [[Iranian languages]] spoken in the area, especially [[Balochi language|Balochi]].<ref>{{harvnb|Emeneau|1962}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

==Dialects==
Kalat, Jhalawan, and Sarawan, with Kalat as the standard dialect.<ref name="e17"/>

==Orthography==
Brahui is the only [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]] which has not been written in a [[Brahmic family of scripts|Brahmi]]-based script in the recent past; instead, it is written in the [[Arabic script]]. More recently, a Roman-based orthography named [[Brolikva]] which is short form of '''Brahui Roman Likvar'''  has been developed by the Brahui Language Board of the [[University of Balochistan]] in Quetta, and adopted by Talár.

Below is the new promoted Bráhuí Báşágal Brolikva orthography:<ref name="University of Balochistan">{{citation|publisher=Brahui Language Board, University of Balochistan|publication-place=Quetta|url=https://sites.google.com/site/brahuilb/home|title=Bráhuí Báşágal|month=April|year=2009|accessdate=2010-06-29}}</ref>

==Endangerment==
{{See also|List of endangered languages in Asia}}
According to a 2009 [[UNESCO]] report, Brahui is one of the 27 [[languages of Pakistan]] that are facing the [[endangered language|danger]] of [[extinct language|extinction]]. They classify it in "unsafe" status, the least endangered level out of the five levels of concern (Unsafe, Definitely Endangered, Severely Endangered, Critically Endangered, and Extinct).<ref>{{harvnb|Moseley|2009}}</ref>

===Publications===
Haftaí Talár recently became the first ever daily newspaper in Brahui language.  It uses the new Roman orthography, and is "an attempt to standardize and develop Brahui language to meet the requirements of modern political, social and scientific discourse."<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.talarpub.tk/|publisher=Talár Publications|title=Haftaí Talár|accessdate=2010-06-29}}</ref>

==History==
There is no consensus as to whether Brahui is a relatively recent language introduced into Balochistan or remnant of an older widespread Dravidian language family. Some scholars see it as a recent migrant language to its present region. They postulate, that Brahui could only have migrated to Balochistan from [[central India]] after 1000 CE. The absence of any older Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui supports this hypothesis. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a [[Northwestern Iranian language]], and moved to the area from the west only around 1000 CE.<ref>{{harvnb|Witzel|1998|p=1}}, which cites {{harvnb|Elfenbein|1987}}</ref> One scholar places the migration аs late as the 13th or 14th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Sergent|1997|pp=129–130}}</ref> However, a few scholars have hypothesised that Brahui is a remnant of a formerly widespread Dravidian language family that is believed to have been reduced or replaced during the influx of Iranian/Indo-Aryan languages upon their arrival in South Asia.{{fact|date=September 2013}}
