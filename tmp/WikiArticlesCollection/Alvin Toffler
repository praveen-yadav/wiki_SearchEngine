'''Alvin Toffler''' (born October 4, 1928) is an American writer and [[futurist]], known for his works discussing the [[digital revolution]], [[Telecommunication|communication revolution]] and [[technological singularity]].

Toffler is a former associate editor of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine. In his early works he focused on technology and its impact through effects like [[information overload]]. He moved on to examining the reaction to [[Social change|changes in society]]. His later focus has been on the increasing power of 21st-century military hardware, the proliferation of new technologies, and capitalism.

He founded Toffler Associates, a management consulting company, and was a visiting scholar at the [[Russell Sage Foundation]], visiting professor at [[Cornell University]], faculty member of the [[The New School|New School for Social Research]], a White House correspondent, an editor of Fortune magazine, and a business consultant.<ref name="MI">[http://www.milkeninstitute.org/events/events.taf?function=show&cat=allconf&EventID=GC03&SPID=898&level1=speakers&level2=bio “Alvin Toffler Speaker Biography”]—[[Milken Institute]], 2003.</ref>

Toffler is married to Heidi Toffler, also a writer and futurist. They live in the [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel Air]] section of Los Angeles, California, just north of [[Sunset Boulevard]].

The couple’s only child, Karen Toffler, (1954–2000), died at the age of 46 after more than a decade suffering from [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Paid Notice: Deaths TOFFLER, KAREN|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/11/classified/paid-notice-deaths-toffler-karen.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 11, 2000}}</ref><ref>http://www.flickr.com/photos/urbanphotos/2415309182/</ref>

==Early life and career==
Alvin Toffler was born in New York city in 1928. He met his future wife, Heidi, at [[New York University]] where he was an English major and she was starting a graduate course in linguistics. Being radical students, they decided against further graduate work, moved to the [[Midwestern United States]], and married, spending the next five years as blue-collar workers on assembly lines while studying industrial mass production in their daily work. Heidi became a union shop steward in the aluminum foundry where she worked. Alvin became a millwright and welder.<ref name="ATWPARTNERSHIP">[http://www.alvintoffler.net/?fa=biospartnership “Alvin and Heidi Toffler: Partnership]—Toffler website</ref>

Their hands-on practical labor experience got Toffler a position on a union-backed newspaper, a transfer to its Washington bureau, then three years as a [[White House Correspondent]] covering Congress and the White House for a Pennsylvania daily. Meanwhile his wife worked at a specialized library for business and behavioral science.<ref name="ATWPARTNERSHIP"/>

They returned to New York City when ''Fortune'' magazine invited Alvin to become its labor columnist, later having him write about business and management.<ref name="ATWPARTNERSHIP"/>

After leaving ''Fortune'' magazine, Alvin Toffler was hired by IBM to do research and write a paper on the social and organizational impact of computers, leading to his contact with the earliest computer "gurus" and artificial intelligence researchers and proponents. [[Xerox]] invited him to write about its research laboratory and [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] consulted him for strategic advice. This AT&T work led to a study of telecommunications which advised its top management for the company to break up more than a decade before the government forced AT&T to break up.<ref name="ATWPARTNERSHIP"/>

In the mid-’60s the Tofflers began work on what would later become ''[[Future Shock]]''.<ref name="ATWPARTNERSHIP"/>

In 1996, with Tom Johnson, an American business consultant, they co-founded Toffler Associates, an advisory firm designed to implement many of the ideas the Tofflers had written on. The firm worked with businesses, NGOs, and governments in the U.S., South Korea, Mexico, Brazil, Singapore, Australia and other countries.<ref name="ATWPARTNERSHIP"/>

==His ideas==
Toffler explains, "Society needs people who take care of the elderly and who know how to be compassionate and honest. Society needs people who work in hospitals. Society needs all kinds of skills that are not just cognitive; they’re emotional, they’re affectional. You can’t run the society on data and computers alone."<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/lm/stories/s10440.htm Alvin Toffler interviewed by Norman Swann], Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio National, "Life Matters,” March 5, 1998.</ref> Toffler is also frequently cited as stating: "Tomorrow's illiterate will not be the man who can't read; he will be the man who has not learned how to learn." The words came from Herbert Gerjuoy, whom Toffler cites in full as follows: "The new education must teach the individual how to classify and reclassify information, how to evaluate its veracity, how to change categories when necessary, how to move from the concrete to the abstract and back, how to look at problems from a new direction — how to teach himself."<ref>{{cite book|last=Toffler|first=Alvin|title=Future Shock|year=1970|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=367}}</ref> 

In his book ''[[The Third Wave (book)|The Third Wave]]'' Toffler describes three types of societies, based on the concept of "waves"—each wave pushes the older societies and cultures aside.
* '''First Wave''' is the society after [[Neolithic Revolution|agrarian revolution]] and replaced the first [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures.
* '''Second Wave''' is the society during the [[Industrial Revolution]] (ca. late 17th century through the mid-20th century). The main components of the Second Wave society are [[nuclear family]], factory-type education system and the corporation. Toffler writes: “The Second Wave Society is industrial and based on [[mass production]], [[mass distribution]], [[mass consumption]], [[mass education]], mass media, mass [[recreation]], mass entertainment, and [[weapons of mass destruction]]. You combine those things with [[standardization]], [[centralization]], concentration, and synchronization, and you wind up with a style of organization we call [[bureaucracy]].”
* '''Third Wave''' is the [[post-industrial society]]. According to Toffler, since the late 1950s most nations have been moving away from a Second Wave Society into what he would call a Third Wave Society, one based on actionable knowledge as a primary resource. His description of this ([[super-industrial society]]) dovetails into other writers' concepts (like the [[Information Age]], [[Space Age]], [[Electronic computer|Electronic]] Era, [[Global village (term)|Global Village]], [[technetronic]] age, scientific-technological revolution), which to various degrees predicted demassification, diversity, knowledge-based production, and the acceleration of change (one of Toffler’s key maxims is "change is non-linear and can go backwards, forwards and sideways").

In this post-industrial society, there is a wide diversity of [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] (“[[subcultures]]”). [[Adhocracy|Adhocracies]] (fluid organizations) adapt quickly to changes. Information can substitute most of the material resources (see [[ersatz]]) and becomes the main material for workers ([[cognitarian]]s instead of [[proletarian]]s), who are loosely affiliated. [[Mass customization]] offers the possibility of cheap, personalized, production catering to small niches (see [[just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] production).

The gap between producer and consumer is bridged by technology using a so-called [[configuration system]]. “[[Prosumer]]s" can fill their own needs (see [[open source]], [[assembly kit]], [[freelance]] work). This was the notion that new technologies are enabling the radical fusion of the producer and consumer into the ''prosumer''. In some cases ''prosuming'' entails a "third job" where the corporation "outsources" its labor not to other countries, but to the unpaid consumer, such as when we do our own banking through an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] instead of a teller that the bank must employ, or trace our own postal packages on the internet instead of relying on a paid clerk.

Since the 1960s, people have been trying to make sense out of the impact of new technologies and social change. Toffler’s writings have been influential beyond the confines of scientific, economic and public policy discussions. [[Techno music]] pioneer [[Juan Atkins]] cites Toffler’s phrase "techno rebels" in ''The Third Wave'' as inspiring him to use the word "techno" to describe the [[musical genre|musical style]] he helped to create<ref>{{cite news|last=Ferguson|first=Benjamin|title=Label of love: Metroplex|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/jun/15/label-love-metroplex|newspaper=The Guardian|date=June 15, 2010}}</ref>
Toffler’s works and ideas have been subject to various criticisms, usually with the same argumentation used against [[future studies|futurology]]: that foreseeing the future is nigh impossible. In the 1990s, his ideas were publicly lauded by [[Newt Gingrich]].

The development Toffler believes may go down as this era’s greatest turning point is the creation of wealth in [[outer space]]. Wealth today, he argues, is created everywhere ([[globalisation]]), nowhere ([[cyberspace]]), and out there (outer space). [[Global positioning satellites]] are key to synchronising precision time and data streams for everything from cellphone calls to [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] withdrawals. They allow [[just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] (JIT) [[productivity]] because of precise tracking. GPS is also becoming central to [[air traffic control]]. And satellites increase agricultural productivity through tracking weather, enabling more accurate [[weather prediction|forecasts]].

==Critical acclaim==
[[Accenture]], the management consultancy firm, has dubbed him the third most influential voice among business leaders, after [[Bill Gates]] and [[Peter Drucker]]. He has also been described in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' as the "world’s most famous futurologist." ''[[People's Daily]]'' classes him among the 50 foreigners that shaped modern China.<ref name="PeoplesDaily">[http://english.people.com.cn/200608/03/eng20060803_289510.html 50 foreigners shaping China’s modern development], August 30, 2006. [http://www.alvintoffler.net/?fa=china_top50 Coverage at the Tofflers’ site]</ref> One author characterizes him as an important early influence on [[Radical center (politics)|radical centrist]] political thought.<ref>Satin, Mark (2004).  ''Radical Middle: The Politics We Need Now''.  Westview Press and Basic Books, p.&nbsp;30.  ISBN 978-0-8133-4190-3.</ref>

==Selected awards==
He is the recipient of several prestigious prizes, including the [[McKinsey & Company|McKinsey Foundation]] Book Award for Contributions to Management Literature, Officier de [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|L’Ordre des Arts et Lettres]], and appointments, including Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]].<ref name="MI"/>
