'''Chaos theory''' is a field of study in [[mathematics]], with applications in several disciplines including [[meteorology]], [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[economics]] and [[biology]]. Chaos theory studies the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s that are highly sensitive to initial conditions—an effect which is popularly referred to as the [[butterfly effect]]. Small differences in initial conditions (such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation) yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction impossible in general.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kellert |first=Stephen H. |title=In the Wake of Chaos: Unpredictable Order in Dynamical Systems |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-226-42976-8 |page=32 |ref=harv}}</ref> This happens even though these systems are [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]], meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no [[randomness|random]] elements involved.<ref>{{harvnb|Kellert|1993|p=56}}</ref> In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable.<ref>{{harvnb|Kellert|1993|p=62}}</ref><ref name="WerndlCharlotte">{{cite journal |author=Werndl, Charlotte |title=What are the New Implications of Chaos for Unpredictability? |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=195–220 |year=2009 |url=http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/60/1/195 |doi=10.1093/bjps/axn053}}</ref>  This behavior is known as '''deterministic chaos''', or simply ''chaos''.

In common usage, "chaos" means "a state of disorder".<ref>Definition of {{linktext|chaos}} at [[Wiktionary]];</ref> However, in chaos theory, the term is defined more precisely. Although there is no universally accepted mathematical definition of chaos, a commonly used definition says that, for a dynamical system to be classified as chaotic, it must have the following properties:<ref>{{cite book|title=A First Course in Dynamics: With a Panorama of Recent Developments|last=Hasselblatt|first=Boris|coauthors=Anatole Katok|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-58750-6}}</ref>

# it must be sensitive to initial conditions;
# it must be [[topological mixing|topologically mixing]]; and
# its [[periodic orbit]]s must be [[dense set|dense]]{{where|date=July 2013}}.

The requirement for sensitive dependence on initial conditions implies that there is a set of initial conditions of positive measure which do not converge to a cycle of any length.

===Sensitivity to initial conditions===
''Sensitivity to initial conditions'' means that each point in such a system is arbitrarily closely approximated by other points with significantly different future trajectories. Thus, an arbitrarily small perturbation of the current trajectory may lead to significantly different future behaviour.  However, it has been shown that the last two properties in the list above actually imply sensitivity to initial conditions<ref>{{cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman & Hall/CRC |year=1999 |isbn=1-58488-002-3 |page=117 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Basener, William F. |title=Topology and its applications |publisher=Wiley |year=2006 |isbn=0-471-68755-3 |page=42 }}</ref> and if attention is restricted to [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]], the second property implies the other two<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vellekoop, Michel; Berglund, Raoul |title=On Intervals, Transitivity = Chaos |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=353–5 |date=April 1994 |jstor=2975629 |doi=10.2307/2975629}}</ref> (an alternative, and in general weaker, definition of chaos uses only the first two properties in the above list).<ref>{{cite book |author=Medio, Alfredo; Lines, Marji |title=Nonlinear Dynamics: A Primer |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-55874-3 |page=165 }}</ref> It is interesting that the most practically significant condition, that of sensitivity to initial conditions, is actually redundant in the definition, being implied by two (or for intervals, one) purely [[Topology|topological]] conditions, which are therefore of greater interest to mathematicians.

Sensitivity to initial conditions is popularly known as the "[[butterfly effect]]", so called because of the title of a paper given by [[Edward Lorenz]] in 1972 to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in Washington, D.C. entitled ''Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly’s Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?'' The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events leading to large-scale phenomena. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different.

A consequence of sensitivity to initial conditions is that if we start with only a finite amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system will no longer be predictable. This is most familiar in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead.<ref name="RGW">{{cite book |author=Watts, Robert G. |title=Global Warming and the Future of the Earth |publisher=Morgan & Claypool |year=2007 |page=17 }}</ref>

The [[Lyapunov exponent]] characterises the extent of the sensitivity to initial conditions. Quantitatively, two [[trajectory|trajectories]] in [[phase space]] with initial separation <math>\delta \mathbf{Z}_0</math> diverge

:<math> | \delta\mathbf{Z}(t) | \approx e^{\lambda t} | \delta \mathbf{Z}_0 |\ </math>

where λ is the Lyapunov exponent.  The rate of separation can be different for different orientations of the initial separation vector. Thus, there is a whole spectrum of Lyapunov exponents — the number of them is equal to the number of dimensions of the phase space. It is common to just refer to the largest one, i.e. to the Maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE), because it determines the overall predictability of the system. A positive MLE is usually taken as an indication that the system is chaotic.

There are also measure-theoretic mathematical conditions (discussed in [[ergodicity|ergodic]] theory) such as mixing or being a K-system which relate to sensitivity of initial conditions and chaos.<ref name="WerndlCharlotte" />

===Topological mixing===
[[File:Chaos Topological Mixing.png|thumb|right|The map defined by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')</span> and <span style="white-space: nowrap;">''y'' → ''x'' + ''y'' if ''x'' + ''y'' < 1 (''x'' + ''y'' – 1 otherwise)</span> also displays [[topological mixing]]. Here the blue region is transformed by the dynamics first to the purple region, then to the pink and red regions, and eventually to a cloud of points scattered across the space.]]
''[[Topological mixing]]'' (or topological ''transitivity'') means that the system will evolve over time so that any given region or [[open set]] of its [[phase space]] will eventually overlap with any other given region. This mathematical concept of "mixing" corresponds to the standard intuition, and the mixing of colored [[dye]]s or fluids is an example of a chaotic system.

Topological mixing is often omitted from popular accounts of chaos, which equate chaos with sensitivity to initial conditions. However, sensitive dependence on initial conditions alone does not give chaos. For example, consider the simple dynamical system produced by repeatedly doubling an initial value. This system has sensitive dependence on initial conditions everywhere, since any pair of nearby points will eventually become widely separated. However, this example has no topological mixing, and therefore has no chaos. Indeed, it has extremely simple behaviour: all points except 0 will tend to positive or negative infinity.

===Density of periodic orbits===
''[[Dense set|Density]] of [[periodic orbit]]s'' means that every point in the space is approached arbitrarily closely by periodic orbits.<ref>{{harvnb|Devaney|2003}}</ref> The one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')</span> is one of the simplest systems with density of periodic orbits.  For example, <math>\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}</math>&nbsp;→ <math>\tfrac{5+\sqrt{5}}{8}</math>&nbsp;→ <math>\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}</math> (or approximately 0.3454915&nbsp;→ 0.9045085&nbsp;→ 0.3454915) is an (unstable) orbit of period 2, and similar orbits exist for periods 4, 8, 16, etc. (indeed, for all the periods specified by [[Sharkovskii's theorem]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Alligood|Sauer|Yorke|1997}}</ref>

Sharkovskii's theorem is the basis of the Li and Yorke<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=T.Y. |last2=Yorke |first2=J.A. |title=Period Three Implies Chaos |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=82 |pages=985–92 |year=1975 |url=http://pb.math.univ.gda.pl/chaos/pdf/li-yorke.pdf |format=PDF |author-link=Tien-Yien Li |doi=10.2307/2318254 |issue=10 |author2-link=James A. Yorke}}</ref> (1975) proof that any one-dimensional system which exhibits a regular cycle of period three will also display regular cycles of every other length as well as completely chaotic orbits.

===Strange attractors===
[[File:TwoLorenzOrbits.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lorenz attractor]] displays chaotic behavior.  These two plots demonstrate sensitive dependence on initial conditions within the region of phase space occupied by the attractor.]]
Some dynamical systems, like the one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x''),</span> are chaotic everywhere, but in many cases chaotic behaviour is found only in a subset of phase space. The cases of most interest arise when the chaotic behaviour takes place on an [[attractor]], since then a large set of initial conditions will lead to orbits that converge to this chaotic region.

An easy way to visualize a chaotic attractor is to start with a point in the [[basin of attraction]] of the attractor, and then simply plot its subsequent orbit. Because of the topological transitivity condition, this is likely to produce a picture of the entire final attractor, and indeed both orbits shown in the figure on the right give a picture of the general shape of the Lorenz attractor.  This attractor results from a simple three-dimensional model of the [[Edward Lorenz|Lorenz]] weather system. The Lorenz attractor is perhaps one of the best-known chaotic system diagrams, probably because it was not only one of the first, but it is also one of the most complex and as such gives rise to a very interesting pattern which looks like the wings of a butterfly.

Unlike [[Attractor#Fixed point|fixed-point attractors]] and ''[[limit cycle]]s'', the attractors which arise from chaotic systems, known as ''[[strange attractor]]s'', have great detail and complexity.  Strange attractors occur in both [[continuous function|continuous]] dynamical systems (such as the Lorenz system) and in some [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] systems (such as the [[Hénon map]]). Other discrete dynamical systems have a repelling structure called a [[Julia set]] which forms at the boundary between basins of attraction of fixed points – Julia sets can be thought of as strange ''repellers''. Both strange attractors and Julia sets typically have a [[fractal]] structure, and a [[fractal dimension]] can be calculated for them.

===Minimum complexity of a chaotic system===
[[File:LogisticMap BifurcationDiagram.png|thumb|right|[[Bifurcation diagram]] of the [[logistic map]] <span style="white-space: nowrap;">''x'' → ''r'' ''x'' (1 – ''x'').</span>  Each vertical slice shows the attractor for a specific value of ''r''.  The diagram displays [[Period-doubling bifurcation|period-doubling]] as ''r'' increases, eventually producing chaos.]]
Discrete chaotic systems, such as the logistic map, can exhibit strange attractors whatever their [[dimension]]ality. In contrast, for [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] dynamical systems, the [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] shows that a strange attractor can only arise in three or more dimensions.  [[Dimension (vector space)|Finite dimensional]] [[linear system]]s are never chaotic; for a dynamical system to display chaotic behaviour it has to be either [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]], or infinite-dimensional.

The [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] states that a two dimensional differential equation has very regular behavior. The Lorenz attractor discussed above is generated by a system of three differential equations with a total of seven terms on the right hand side, five of which are linear terms and two of which are quadratic (and therefore nonlinear). Another well-known chaotic attractor is generated by the [[Rossler map|Rossler equations]] with seven terms on the right hand side, only one of which is (quadratic) nonlinear. Sprott<ref>

An early proponent of chaos theory was [[Henri Poincaré]]. In the 1880s, while studying the [[three-body problem]], he found that there can be orbits which are nonperiodic, and yet not forever increasing nor approaching a fixed point.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poincaré, Jules Henri |title=Sur le problème des trois corps et les équations de la dynamique.

Despite initial insights in the first half of the twentieth century, chaos theory became formalized as such only after mid-century, when it first became evident for some scientists that [[linear theory]], the prevailing system theory at that time, simply could not explain the observed behaviour of certain experiments like that of the [[logistic map]]. What had been beforehand excluded as measure imprecision and simple "[[noise]]" was considered by chaos theories as a full component of the studied systems.

The main catalyst for the development of chaos theory was the electronic computer. Much of the mathematics of chaos theory involves the repeated [[iteration]] of simple mathematical formulas, which would be impractical to do by hand. Electronic computers made these repeated calculations practical, while figures and images made it possible to visualize these systems.

Studies of the critical point beyond which a system creates turbulence were important for Chaos theory, analyzed for example by the [[Soviet physicists|Soviet physicist]] [[Lev Landau]] who developed the [[Landau-Hopf theory of turbulence]]. [[David Ruelle]] and [[Floris Takens]] later predicted, against Landau, that [[fluid turbulence]] could develop through a [[strange attractor]], a main concept of chaos theory.]]

An early pioneer of the theory was [[Edward Lorenz]] whose interest in chaos came about accidentally through his work on [[meteorology|weather prediction]] in 1961.<ref name=Lorenz1961>{{cite journal |author=Lorenz, Edward N. |title=Deterministic non-periodic flow |journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |volume=20 |pages=130–141 |year=1963 |doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020<0130:DNF>2.0.CO;2 |issue=2 |bibcode=1963JAtS...20..130L}}</ref> Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]], to run his weather simulation. He wanted to see a sequence of data again and to save time he started the simulation in the middle of its course. He was able to do this by entering a printout of the data corresponding to conditions in the middle of his simulation which he had calculated last time.

To his surprise the weather that the machine began to predict was completely different from the weather calculated before. Lorenz tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 was printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have had practically no effect. However Lorenz had discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in the long-term outcome.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Chaos: Making a New Science]]|last=Gleick|first=James|year=1987|publisher=Cardinal|location=London|page=17|isbn=0-434-29554-X}}</ref> Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to [[Lorenz attractor]]s, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot in general make long-term weather predictions.

In December 1977, the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] organized the first symposium on Chaos, attended by David Ruelle, [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Robert May]], [[James A. Yorke]] (coiner of the term "chaos" as used in mathematics), [[Robert Shaw (physicist)|Robert Shaw]] (a physicist, part of the [[Eudaemons]] group with [[J. Doyne Farmer]] and [[Norman Packard]] who tried to find a mathematical method to beat [[roulette]], and then created with them the [[Dynamical Systems Collective]] in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], [[California]]), and the meteorologist Edward Lorenz.

The following year, independently the French [[Pierre Coullet]] and [[Charles Tresser]] with the article "Iterations d'endomorphismes et groupe de renormalisation" and the American [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] with the article "Quantitative Universality for a Class of Nonlinear Transformations" described logistic maps.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Mitchell |last=Feigenbaum |title=Quantitative universality for a class of nonlinear transformations |journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=25–52 |date=July 1978 |doi=10.1007/BF01020332 |bibcode=1978JSP....19...25F}}</ref><ref>Coullet, Pierre, and Charles Tresser. "Iterations d'endomorphismes et groupe de renormalisation." Le Journal de Physique Colloques 39.C5 (1978): C5-25</ref>  They notably discovered the universality in chaos, permitting an application of chaos theory to many different phenomena.

In 1979, [[Albert J. Libchaber]], during a symposium organized in Aspen by [[Pierre Hohenberg]], presented his experimental observation of the [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] cascade that leads to chaos and turbulence in [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection]] systems. He was awarded the [[Wolf Prize in Physics]] in 1986 along with [[Mitchell J. Feigenbaum]] "for his brilliant experimental demonstration of the transition to turbulence and chaos in dynamical systems".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.wolffund.org.il/cat.asp?id=25&cat_title=PHYSICS|title = The Wolf Prize in Physics in 1986.}}</ref>

Then in 1986, the New York Academy of Sciences co-organized with the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] and the [[Office of Naval Research]] the first important conference on Chaos in biology and medicine. There, [[Bernardo Huberman]] presented a mathematical model of the [[eye tracking disorder]] among [[schizophrenics]].<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Bernardo Huberman |author=Huberman, B.A. |title=A Model for Dysfunctions in Smooth Pursuit Eye Movement |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=504 Perspectives in Biological Dynamics and Theoretical Medicine |pages=260–273 |date=July 1987 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb48737.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb48737.x/abstract|bibcode = 1987NYASA.504..260H }}</ref> This led to a renewal of [[physiology]] in the 1980s through the application of chaos theory, for example in the study of pathological [[cardiac cycle]]s.

In 1987, [[Per Bak]], [[Chao Tang]] and [[Kurt Wiesenfeld]] published a paper in ''[[Physical Review Letters]]''<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bak, Per; Tang, Chao; Wiesenfeld, Kurt |title=Self-organized criticality: An explanation of the 1/f noise |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=381–4 |date=27 July 1987 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381 |bibcode=1987PhRvL..59..381B}} However, the conclusions of this article have been subject to dispute. {{cite web |url=http://www.nslij-genetics.org/wli/1fnoise/1fnoise_square.html |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}. See especially: {{cite journal |author=Laurson, Lasse; Alava, Mikko J.; Zapperi, Stefano |title=Letter: Power spectra of self-organized critical sand piles |journal=Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment |volume=0511 |id=L001 |date=15 September 2005 }}</ref> describing for the first time [[self-organized criticality]] (SOC), considered to be one of the mechanisms by which [[complexity]] arises in nature.

Alongside largely lab-based approaches such as the [[Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile]], many other investigations have focused on large-scale natural or social systems that are known (or suspected) to display [[scale invariance|scale-invariant]] behaviour. Although these approaches were not always welcomed (at least initially) by specialists in the subjects examined, SOC has nevertheless become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including: [[earthquake]]s (which, long before SOC was discovered, were known as a source of scale-invariant behaviour such as the [[Gutenberg–Richter law]] describing the statistical distribution of earthquake sizes, and the [[Aftershock|Omori law]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Omori, F. |title=On the aftershocks of earthquakes |journal=Journal of the College of Science, Imperial University of Tokyo |volume=7 |pages=111–200 |year=1894 }}</ref> describing the frequency of aftershocks); [[solar flare]]s; fluctuations in economic systems such as [[financial market]]s (references to SOC are common in [[econophysics]]); [[landscape formation]]; [[forest fire]]s; [[landslide]]s; [[epidemic]]s; and [[biological evolution]] (where SOC has been invoked, for example, as the dynamical mechanism behind the theory of "[[punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibria]]" put forward by [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]). Given the implications of a scale-free distribution of event sizes, some researchers have suggested that another phenomenon that should be considered an example of SOC is the occurrence of [[war]]s. These "applied" investigations of SOC have included both attempts at modelling (either developing new models or adapting existing ones to the specifics of a given natural system), and extensive data analysis to determine the existence and/or characteristics of natural scaling laws.

This same year 1987, [[James Gleick]] published ''Chaos: Making a New Science'', which became a best-seller and introduced the general principles of chaos theory as well as its history to the broad public, (though his history under-emphasized important Soviet contributions){{Citation needed|reason=please share missing contributions with "such as..."|date=May 2013}}. At first the domain of work of a few, isolated individuals, chaos theory progressively emerged as a transdisciplinary and institutional discipline, mainly under the name of [[nonlinear system]]s analysis. Alluding to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s concept of a [[paradigm shift]] exposed in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), many "chaologists" (as some described themselves) claimed that this new theory was an example of such a shift, a thesis upheld by J. Gleick.

The availability of cheaper, more powerful computers broadens the applicability of chaos theory. Currently, chaos theory continues to be a very active area of research,<ref>Motter A. E. and  Campbell D. K., [http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v66/i5/p27_s1?bypassSSO=1 Chaos at fifty], Phys. Today 66(5), 27-33 (2013).</ref> involving many different disciplines ([[mathematics]], [[topology]], [[physics]], [[social systems]], [[population biology]], [[biology]], [[meteorology]], [[astrophysics]], [[information theory]], [[computational neuroscience]], etc.).

==Distinguishing random from chaotic data==
It can be difficult to tell from data whether a physical or other observed process is random or chaotic, because in practice no [[time series]] consists of pure 'signal.' There will always be some form of corrupting noise, even if it is present as round-off or truncation error. Thus any real time series, even if mostly deterministic, will contain some randomness.<ref name=prov>{{cite journal |author=Provenzale, A., ''et al.'' |title=Distinguishing between low-dimensional dynamics and randomness in measured time-series |journal=Physica D |volume=58 |pages=31–49 |year=1992 |doi=10.1016/0167-2789(92)90100-2 |bibcode = 1992PhyD...58...31P }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Brock, W.A. |title=Distinguishing random and deterministic systems: Abridged version |journal=[[Journal of Economic Theory]] |volume=40 |pages=168–195 |date=October 1986 |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(86)90014-1 }}</ref>

All methods for distinguishing deterministic and stochastic processes rely on the fact that a deterministic system always evolves in the same way from a given starting point.<ref name=prov /><ref>{{cite journal | author = Sugihara G., May R. | year = 1990 | title = Nonlinear forecasting as a way of distinguishing chaos from measurement error in time series | url = http://deepeco.ucsd.edu/~george/publications/90_nonlinear_forecasting.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 344 | issue = 6268| pages = 734–741 |doi=10.1038/344734a0 | pmid = 2330029|bibcode = 1990Natur.344..734S }}</ref> Thus, given a time series to test for determinism, one can:
# pick a test state;
# search the time series for a similar or 'nearby' state; and
# compare their respective time evolutions.

Define the error as the difference between the time evolution of the 'test' state and the time evolution of the nearby state. A deterministic system will have an error that either remains small (stable, regular solution) or increases exponentially with time (chaos). A stochastic system will have a randomly distributed error.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Casdagli |first=Martin |title=Chaos and Deterministic ''versus'' Stochastic Non-linear Modelling |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=303–328 |year=1991 |jstor=2346130}}</ref>

Essentially, all measures of determinism taken from time series rely upon finding the closest states to a given 'test' state (e.g., correlation dimension, Lyapunov exponents, etc.). To define the state of a system one typically relies on phase space embedding methods.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Broomhead, D.S.; King, G.P. |title=Extracting qualitative dynamics from experimental data |journal=Physica D |volume=20 |issue=2–3 |pages=217–236 |date=June–July 1986 |doi=10.1016/0167-2789(86)90031-X |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016727898690031X|bibcode = 1986PhyD...20..217B }}</ref>
Typically one chooses an embedding dimension, and investigates the propagation of the error between two nearby states. If the error looks random, one increases the dimension. If you can increase the dimension to obtain a deterministic looking error, then you are done. Though it may sound simple it is not really. One complication is that as the dimension increases the search for a nearby state requires a lot more computation time and a lot of data (the amount of data required increases exponentially with embedding dimension) to find a suitably close candidate. If the embedding dimension (number of measures per state) is chosen too small (less than the 'true' value) deterministic data can appear to be random but in theory there is no problem choosing the dimension too large – the method will work.

When a non-linear deterministic system is attended by external fluctuations, its trajectories present serious and permanent distortions. Furthermore, the noise is amplified due to the inherent non-linearity and reveals totally new dynamical properties. Statistical tests attempting to separate noise from the deterministic skeleton or inversely isolate the deterministic part risk failure. Things become worse when the deterministic component is a non-linear feedback system.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kyrtsou C | year = 2008 | title = Re-examining the sources of heteroskedasticity: the paradigm of noisy chaotic models | journal = Physica A | volume = 387 | issue = 27| pages = 6785–9 | doi = 10.1016/j.physa.2008.09.008 |bibcode = 2008PhyA..387.6785K }}</ref> In presence of interactions between nonlinear deterministic components and noise, the resulting nonlinear series can display dynamics that traditional tests for nonlinearity are sometimes not able to capture.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kyrtsou, C. |title=Evidence for neglected linearity in noisy chaotic models |journal=International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=3391–4 |year=2005 |doi=10.1142/S0218127405013964 |bibcode = 2005IJBC...15.3391K }}</ref>

The question of how to distinguish deterministic chaotic systems from stochastic systems has also been discussed in philosophy. It has been shown that they might be
observationally equivalent.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Werndl, Charlotte |title=Are Deterministic Descriptions and Indeterministic Descriptions Observationally Equivalent? |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=40 |pages=232–242 |year=2009 |doi= 10.1016/j.shpsb.2009.06.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VH6-4X1GG4G-1&_user=10&_coverDate=08%2F31%2F2009&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=gateway&_origin=gateway&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=4433c2dcaed0b2a60cc7cbcfae7664ff&searchtype=a |issue=3}}</ref>
