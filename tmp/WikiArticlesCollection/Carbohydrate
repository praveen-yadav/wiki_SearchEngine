The term is most common in [[biochemistry]], where it is a synonym of '''saccharide'''. The carbohydrates (saccharides) are divided into four chemical groupings: [[monosaccharide]]s, [[disaccharide]]s, [[oligosaccharide]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s. In general, the monosaccharides and disaccharides, which are smaller (lower [[molecular weight]]) carbohydrates, are commonly referred to as [[sugar]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/421219a|title=Sugars tied to the spot|year=2003|last1=Flitsch|first1=Sabine L.|last2=Ulijn|first2=Rein V|journal=Nature|volume=421|issue=6920|pages=219–20|pmid=12529622}}</ref> The word ''saccharide'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''σάκχαρον'' (''sákkharon''), meaning "[[sugar]]." While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex, the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix [[-ose]]. For example, [[grape sugar]] is the monosaccharide [[glucose]], [[cane sugar]] is the disaccharide [[sucrose]], and milk sugar is the disaccharide [[lactose]] (see illustration).

Carbohydrates perform numerous roles in living organisms. Polysaccharides serve for the storage of [[energy]] (e.g., [[starch]] and [[glycogen]]), and as structural components (e.g., [[cellulose]] in plants and [[chitin]] in arthropods). The 5-carbon monosaccharide [[ribose]] is an important component of [[coenzyme]]s (e.g., [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[FAD]], and [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]) and the backbone of the genetic molecule known as [[RNA]]. The related deoxyribose is a component of DNA. Saccharides and their derivatives include many other important [[biomolecules]] that play key roles in the [[immune system]], [[fertilization]], preventing [[pathogenesis]], [[blood clotting]], and [[developmental biology|development]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Maton|first=Anthea|coauthors=Jean Hopkins, Charles William McLaughlin, Susan Johnson, Maryanna Quon Warner, David LaHart, Jill D. Wright|title=Human Biology and Health|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1993|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, USA|pages=52–59|isbn=0-13-981176-1}}</ref>

In [[food science]] and in many informal contexts, the term carbohydrate often means any [[food]] that is particularly rich in the complex carbohydrate [[starch]] (such as [[cereal]]s, [[bread]], and [[pasta]]) or simple carbohydrates, such as [[sugar]] (found in [[candy]], [[jam]]s, and [[dessert]]s).

==Structure==
Formerly the name "carbohydrate" was used in [[chemistry]] for any compound with the formula C<sub>''m''</sub> (H<sub>2</sub>O) <sub>''n''</sub>. Following this definition, some chemists considered [[formaldehyde]] (CH<sub>2</sub>O) to be the simplest carbohydrate,<ref name="coulter">
 John Merle Coulter, Charler Reid Barnes, Henry Chandler Cowles (1930), [http://books.google.com.br/books?id=WyZnVpCiTHIC&pg=PA375&dq=simplest+carbohydrate A Textbook of Botany for Colleges and Universities]"
</ref> while others claimed that title for [[glycolaldehyde]].<ref name="tietz">
 Carl A. Burtis, Edward R. Ashwood, Norbert W. Tietz (2000), ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=l5hqAAAAMAAJ&q=simplest+carbohydrate Tietz fundamentals of clinical chemistry]''
</ref> Today the term is generally understood in the biochemistry sense, which excludes compounds with only one or two carbons.

Natural saccharides are generally built of simple carbohydrates called [[monosaccharide]]s with general formula (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>''n''</sub> where ''n'' is three or more. A typical monosaccharide has the structure H-(CHOH)<sub>''x''</sub>(C=O)-(CHOH)<sub>''y''</sub>-H, that is, an [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]] with many [[hydroxyl]] groups added, usually one on each [[carbon]] [[atom]] that is not part of the aldehyde or ketone [[functional group]]. Examples of monosaccharides are [[glucose]], [[fructose]], and [[glyceraldehyde]]s. However, some biological substances commonly called "monosaccharides" do not conform to this formula (e.g., [[uronic acids]] and deoxy-sugars such as [[fucose]]), and there are many chemicals that do conform to this formula but are not considered to be monosaccharides (e.g., formaldehyde CH<sub>2</sub>O and [[inositol]] (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>).<ref>
 Matthews, C. E.; K. E. Van Holde; K. G. Ahern (1999) ''Biochemistry''. 3rd edition. Benjamin Cummings. ISBN 0-8053-3066-6
</ref>

The [[open-chain]] form of a monosaccharide often coexists with a [[heterocyclic compound|closed ring form]] where the [[aldehyde]]/[[ketone]] [[carbonyl]] group carbon (C=O) and [[hydroxyl]] group (-OH) react forming a [[hemiacetal]] with a new C-O-C bridge.

Monosaccharides can be linked together into what are called [[polysaccharide]]s (or [[oligosaccharide]]s) in a large variety of ways. Many carbohydrates contain one or more modified monosaccharide units that have had one or more groups replaced or removed. For example, [[deoxyribose]], a component of [[DNA]], is a modified version of [[ribose]]; [[chitin]] is composed of repeating units of [[N-acetyl glucosamine]], a [[nitrogen]]-containing form of glucose.

==Monosaccharides==
{{Main|Monosaccharide}}
[[Image:D-glucose color coded.png|130px|right|thumb|[[Glucose|D-glucose]] is an aldohexose with the formula (C·H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>. The red atoms highlight the [[aldehyde]] group, and the blue atoms highlight the [[chirality (chemistry)|asymmetric center]] furthest from the aldehyde; because this -OH is on the right of the [[Fischer projection]], this is a D sugar.]]
Monosaccharides are the simplest carbohydrates in that they cannot be [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] to smaller carbohydrates. They are aldehydes or ketones with two or more hydroxyl groups. The general [[chemical formula]] of an unmodified monosaccharide is (C•H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub> n</sub>, literally a "carbon hydrate." Monosaccharides are important fuel molecules as well as building blocks for nucleic acids. The smallest monosaccharides, for which n=3, are dihydroxyacetone and D- and L-glyceraldehydes.

===Classification of monosaccharides===

</div>
</div>
</div>
Monosaccharides are classified according to three different characteristics: the placement of its [[carbonyl]] group, the number of [[carbon]] atoms it contains, and its [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] handedness. If the carbonyl group is an [[aldehyde]], the monosaccharide is an [[aldose]]; if the carbonyl group is a [[ketone]], the monosaccharide is a [[ketose]]. Monosaccharides with three carbon atoms are called [[triose]]s, those with four are called [[tetrose]]s, five are called [[pentose]]s, six are [[hexose]]s, and so on.<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Neil A.|coauthors=Brad Williamson; Robin J. Heyden|title=Biology: Exploring Life|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2006|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=|url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html|isbn=0-13-250882-6}}</ref> These two systems of classification are often combined. For example, [[glucose]] is an [[aldohexose]] (a six-carbon aldehyde), [[ribose]] is an [[aldopentose]] (a five-carbon aldehyde), and [[fructose]] is a [[ketohexose]] (a six-carbon ketone).

Each carbon atom bearing a [[hydroxyl group]] (-OH), with the exception of the first and last carbons, are [[Chirality (chemistry)|asymmetric]], making them [[Stereogenic|stereo center]]s with two possible configurations each (R or S). Because of this asymmetry, a number of [[isomer]]s may exist for any given monosaccharide formula. The aldohexose D-glucose, for example, has the formula (C·H<sub>2</sub>O) <sub>6</sub>, of which all but two of its six carbons atoms are stereogenic, making D-glucose one of 2<sup>4</sup>=16 possible [[stereoisomer]]s. In the case of [[glyceraldehydes]], an aldotriose, there is one pair of possible stereoisomers, which are [[enantiomers]] and [[epimer]]s. [[Dihydroxyacetone|1, 3-dihydroxyacetone]], the ketose corresponding to the aldose glyceraldehydes, is a symmetric molecule with no stereo centers. The assignment of D or L is made according to the orientation of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl group: in a standard Fischer projection if the hydroxyl group is on the right the molecule is a D sugar, otherwise it is an L sugar. The "D-" and "L-" prefixes should not be confused with "d-" or "l-", which indicate the direction that the sugar  [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotates]] plane [[Polarization (waves)|polarized light]]. This usage of "d-" and "l-" is no longer followed in carbohydrate chemistry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pigman|first=Ward|coauthors=Horton, D.|title=The Carbohydrates: Chemistry and Biochemistry Vol 1A|editor=Pigman and Horton|edition=2nd|year=1972|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages=1–67|chapter=Chapter 1: Stereochemistry of the Monosaccharides}}</ref>

===Ring-straight chain isomerism===
[[Image:Glucose Fisher to Haworth.gif|thumb|200px|right||[[Glucose]] can exist in both a straight-chain and ring form.]]
The aldehyde or ketone group of a straight-chain monosaccharide will react reversibly with a hydroxyl group on a different carbon atom to form a [[hemiacetal]] or [[hemiketal]], forming a [[heterocyclic]] ring with an oxygen bridge between two carbon atoms. Rings with five and six atoms are called [[furanose]] and [[pyranose]] forms, respectively, and exist in equilibrium with the straight-chain form.<ref name=pigman>{{cite book|last=Pigman|first=Ward|coauthors=Anet, E.F.L.J.|title=The Carbohydrates: Chemistry and Biochemistry Vol 1A|editor=Pigman and Horton|edition=2nd|date=|year=1972|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages=165–194|chapter=Chapter 4: Mutarotations and Actions of Acids and Bases}}</ref>

During the conversion from straight-chain form to the cyclic form, the carbon atom containing the carbonyl oxygen, called the [[anomeric carbon]], becomes a stereogenic center with two possible configurations: The oxygen atom may take a position either above or below the plane of the ring. The resulting possible pair of stereoisomers is called [[anomer]]s. In the ''α anomer'', the -OH substituent on the anomeric carbon rests on the opposite side ([[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]) of the ring from the CH<sub>2</sub>OH side branch. The alternative form, in which the CH<sub>2</sub>OH substituent and the anomeric hydroxyl are on the same side (cis) of the plane of the ring, is called the ''β anomer''.

===Use in living organisms===
Monosaccharides are the major source of fuel for [[metabolism]], being used both as an energy source (glucose being the most important in nature) and in [[biosynthesis]]. When monosaccharides are not immediately needed by many cells they are often converted to more space-efficient forms, often [[polysaccharide]]s. In many animals, including humans, this storage form is [[glycogen]], especially in liver and muscle cells. In plants, [[starch]], is used for the same purpose.

==Disaccharides==
[[Image:sucrose 3Dprojection.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Sucrose]], also known as table [[sugar]], is a common disaccharide. It is composed of two monosaccharides: [[glucose|D-glucose]] (left) and [[fructose|D-fructose]] (right).]]
{{Main|Disaccharide}}
Two joined monosaccharides are called a [[disaccharide]] and these are the simplest polysaccharides. Examples include [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]. They are composed of two monosaccharide units bound together by a [[covalent]] bond known as a [[glycosidic linkage]] formed via a [[dehydration reaction]], resulting in the loss of a [[hydrogen]] atom from one monosaccharide and a [[hydroxyl group]] from the other. The [[chemical formula|formula]] of unmodified disaccharides is C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>. Although there are numerous kinds of disaccharides, a handful of disaccharides are particularly notable.

[[Sucrose]], pictured to the right, is the most abundant disaccharide, and the main form in which carbohydrates are transported in [[plant]]s. It is composed of one [[glucose|D-glucose]] molecule and one [[fructose|D-fructose]] molecule. The [[systematic name]] for sucrose, ''O''-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-D-fructofuranoside, indicates four things:
* Its monosaccharides: glucose and fructose
* Their ring types: glucose is a [[pyranose]], and fructose is a [[furanose]]
* How they are linked together: the oxygen on carbon number 1 (C1) of α-D-glucose is linked to the C2 of D-fructose.
* The ''-oside'' suffix indicates that the [[anomeric carbon]] of both monosaccharides participates in the glycosidic bond.

[[Lactose]], a disaccharide composed of one [[galactose|D-galactose]] molecule and one [[glucose|D-glucose]] molecule, occurs naturally in mammalian [[milk]]. The [[systematic name]] for lactose is ''O''-β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucopyranose. Other notable disaccharides include [[maltose]] (two D-glucoses linked α-1,4) and cellulobiose (two D-glucoses linked β-1,4).
Disaccharides can be classified into two types.They are reducing and non-reducing disaccharides. If the functional group is present in bonding with another sugar unit, it is called a reducing disaccharide or biose.

==Nutrition==
[[Image:starchy-foods..jpg|thumb|[[cereal|Grain]] products: rich sources of carbohydrates]]

Pure digestible carbohydrate, on average, yields 4 [[Calories]] of energy per [[gram]].<ref>http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5022e/y5022e04.htm</ref> Foods with high carbohydrate are often highly processed or refined foods made from plants; including sweets, cookies and candy, table sugar, honey, soft drinks, breads and crackers, jams and fruit products, pastas and breakfast cereals.  Unrefined foods usually contain lower amounts of carbohydrate; including beans, tubers, rice, and unrefined fruit.<ref>http://www.diabetes.org.uk/upload/How%20we%20help/catalogue/carb-reference-list-0511.pdf</ref>  Foods from animal carcass have the lowest carbohydrate but mammalian milk does contain lactose. 

Carbohydrates are a common source of energy in living organisms; however, no carbohydrate is an [[essential nutrient]] in humans.<ref name="r1">{{cite journal|title=Is dietary carbohydrate essential for human nutrition? |pmid=11976176|year=2002|last1=Westman|first1=EC|volume=75|issue=5|pages=951–3; author reply 953–4|journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition}}</ref> Carbohydrates are not essential for the synthesis of other molecules.

Following a diet consisting of very low amounts of daily carbohydrate for several days will usually result in higher levels of blood [[ketone bodies]] than an isocaloric diet with similar protein content.<ref>http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/83/5/1055.full.pdf+html</ref> This relatively high level of ketone bodies is commonly known as [[ketosis]] and is very often confused with the potentially fatal condition often seen in [[Type 1 diabeties|type 1 diabetics]] known as Diabetic [[ketoacidosis]].  Somebody suffering ketoacidosis will have much higher levels of blood ketone bodies  along with high blood sugar, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketones. However the medium-chain fatty acids octanoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain, which normally relies upon glucose for its energy.<ref>[http://www.jneurosci.org/content/23/13/5928.full]</ref><ref>[http://www.nature.com/jcbfm/journal/v33/n2/abs/jcbfm2012151a.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.medbio.info/Horn/IntMet/integration_of_metabolism%20v4.htm MedBio.info > Integration of Metabolism]  Professor em.

[[Gluconeogenesis]] allows humans to synthesize some glucose from specific amino acids, from the [[glycerol]] backbone in [[triglyceride]]s and in some cases from fatty acids. 

Organisms typically cannot metabolize all types of carbohydrate to yield energy. Glucose is a nearly universal and accessible source of [[calories]]. Many organisms also have the ability to metabolize other [[monosaccharide]]s and [[disaccharide]]s but glucose is often metabolized first. In ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', for example, the [[lac operon]] will express enzymes for the digestion of lactose when it is present, but if both lactose and glucose are present the ''lac'' operon is repressed, resulting in the glucose being used first (see: [[Diauxie]]). [[Polysaccharide]]s are also common sources of energy. Many organisms can easily break down starches into glucose, however, most organisms cannot metabolize cellulose or other polysaccharides like [[chitin]] and [[arabinoxylans]]. These carbohydrates types can be metabolized by some bacteria and protists. [[Ruminant]]s and [[termite]]s, for example, use microorganisms to process [[cellulose]]. Even though these complex carbohydrates are not very digestible, they represent an important dietary element for humans, called [[dietary fiber]]. Fiber enhances digestion, among other benefits.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16614413|year=2006|last1=Pichon|first1=L|last2=Huneau|first2=JF|last3=Fromentin|first3=G|last4=Tomé|first4=D|title=A high-protein, high-fat, carbohydrate-free diet reduces energy intake, hepatic lipogenesis, and adiposity in rats|volume=136|issue=5|pages=1256–60|journal=The Journal of nutrition}}</ref>

===Classification===
Nutritionists often refer to carbohydrates as either simple or complex. However, the exact distinction between these groups can be ambiguous. The term ''complex carbohydrate'' was first used in the [[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs]] publication ''Dietary Goals for the United States'' (1977) where it was intended to distinguish sugars from other carbohydrates (which were perceived to be nutritionally superior).<ref>Joint WHO/FAO expert consultation (1998), ''Carbohydrates in human nutrition'', [http://www.fao.org/docrep/W8079E/w8079e07.htm chapter 1]. ISBN 92-5-104114-8.</ref> However, the report put "fruit, vegetables and whole-grains" in the complex carbohydrate column, despite the fact that these may contain sugars as well as polysaccharides. This confusion persists as today some nutritionists use the term complex carbohydrate to refer to any sort of digestible saccharide present in a whole food, where fiber, vitamins and minerals are also found (as opposed to processed carbohydrates, which provide calories but few other nutrients). The standard usage, however, is to classify carbohydrates chemically: simple if they are sugars ([[monosaccharide]]s and [[disaccharide]]s) and complex if they are [[polysaccharide]]s (or [[oligosaccharide]]s).<ref name=NutSource>{{cite web|title=Carbohydrates|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/|work=The Nutrition Source|publisher=Harvard School of Public Health|accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>

In any case, the simple vs. complex chemical distinction has little value for determining the nutritional quality of carbohydrates.<ref name=NutSource /> Some simple carbohydrates (e.g. [[fructose]]) raise blood glucose slowly, while some complex carbohydrates (starches), especially if processed, raise blood sugar rapidly. The speed of digestion is determined by a variety of factors including which other nutrients are consumed with the carbohydrate, how the food is prepared, individual differences in metabolism, and the chemistry of the carbohydrate.<ref name=Jenkins>{{cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=David|coauthors=Alexandra L. Jenkins, Thomas M.S. Woleve, Lilian H. Thompson and A. Venkat Rao|title=Simple and Complex Carbohydrates|journal=Nutrition Reviews|year=1986|month=February|volume=44|issue=2}}</ref>

The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA's]] ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010'' call for moderate- to high-carbohydrate consumption from a balanced diet that includes six one-ounce servings of grain foods each day, at least half from [[whole grain]] sources and the rest from [[Enriched grain|enriched]].<ref>[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|DHHS]] and [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], [http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/DietaryGuidelines.htm ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010''].</ref>

The [[glycemic index|glycemic index (GI)]] and [[glycemic load]] concepts have been developed to characterize food behavior during human digestion. They rank carbohydrate-rich foods based on the rapidity and magnitude of their effect on [[blood glucose]] levels. Glycemic index is a measure of how quickly food [[glucose]] is absorbed, while glycemic load is a measure of the total absorbable glucose in foods. The [[insulin index]] is a similar, more recent classification method that ranks foods based on their effects on [[insulin|blood insulin]] levels, which are caused by glucose (or starch) and some amino acids in food.

==Metabolism==
{{Main|Carbohydrate metabolism}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

===Catabolism===
Catabolism is the metabolic reaction which cells undergo to extract energy. There are two major [[metabolic pathway]]s of monosaccharide [[catabolism]]: [[glycolysis]] and the [[citric acid cycle]].

In glycolysis, oligo/polysaccharides are cleaved first to smaller monosaccharides by enzymes called [[glycoside hydrolase]]s. The monosaccharide units can then enter into monosaccharide catabolism. In some cases, as with humans, not all carbohydrate types are usable as the digestive and metabolic enzymes necessary are not present.
