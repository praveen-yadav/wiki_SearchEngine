'''Bipolar disorder''', also known as '''bipolar affective disorder''', '''manic-depressive disorder''', or '''manic depression''', is a [[mental disorder|mental illness]] classified by [[psychiatry]] as a [[mood disorder]].  Individuals with bipolar disorder experience episodes of an elevated or agitated mood known as [[mania]] (or [[hypomania]], depending on the severity) alternating with [[Major depressive episode|episodes of depression]].

Mania can occur with different levels of severity.  At milder levels of mania, or "hypomania", individuals appear energetic, excitable, and may be highly productive. As mania becomes more severe, individuals begin to behave erratically and impulsively, often making poor decisions due to unrealistic ideas about the future, and may have great difficulty with sleep. At the most severe level, individuals can experience very distorted beliefs about the world known as [[psychosis]].

Individuals who experience manic episodes also commonly experience depressive episodes; some experience a [[mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed state]] in which features of both mania and depression are present at the same time. Manic and depressive episodes last from a few days to several months.

About 4% of people suffer from bipolar disorder.  Prevalence is similar in men and women and, broadly, across different cultures and ethnic groups. [[Genetics|Genetic factors]] contribute substantially to the likelihood of developing bipolar disorder, and environmental factors are also implicated.  Bipolar disorder is often treated with [[mood stabilizing medication]]s and [[psychotherapy]]. In serious cases, in which there is a risk of harm to oneself or others, [[involuntary commitment]] may be used. These cases generally involve severe manic episodes with dangerous behavior or depressive episodes with [[suicidal ideation]]. There are widespread problems with [[social stigma]], [[stereotypes]], and [[prejudice]] against individuals with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. People with bipolar disorder exhibiting psychotic symptoms can sometimes be misdiagnosed as having [[schizophrenia]].

The current term ''bipolar disorder'' is of fairly recent origin and refers to the cycling between high and low episodes (poles). The term "manic–depressive illness" or psychosis was coined by German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] in the late nineteenth century, originally referring to all kinds of mood disorder. German psychiatrist [[Karl Leonhard]] split the classification in 1957, employing the terms [[unipolar disorder]] ([[major depressive disorder]]) and bipolar disorder.

== Signs and symptoms ==
In bipolar disorder, people experience abnormally elevated (manic or hypomanic) mood states which interfere with the functions of ordinary life.  Many people with bipolar disorder also experience periods of depressed mood, but this is not universal.  There is no simple physiological test to confirm the disorder.  Diagnosing bipolar disorder is often difficult, even for mental health professionals.  In particular, it can be difficult to distinguish depression caused by bipolar disorder from pure unipolar depression.

The earlier the age of onset, the more likely the first few episodes are to be depressive.<ref name="Bowden">{{cite  pmid|11141528}}</ref> Because a bipolar diagnosis requires a manic or hypomanic episode, many patients are initially diagnosed and treated as having major depression.<ref name=Muzina2007>{{cite journal|last=Muzina|first=DJ|coauthors=Kemp, DE; McIntyre, RS|title=Differentiating bipolar disorders from major depressive disorders: treatment implications|journal=Annals of Clinical Psychiatry|date=2007 Oct–Dec|volume=19|issue=4|pages=305–12|pmid=18058287|doi=10.1080/10401230701653591}}</ref>

=== Manic episodes ===
[[Mania]] is the defining feature of bipolar disorder. Mania is a distinct period of elevated or irritable mood, which can take the form of euphoria, and lasts for at least a week (less if hospitalization is required).<ref>{{cite web |title=Bipolar disorder: Tests and diagnosis |author=Mayo Clinic staff |publisher=MayoClinic.com |accessdate=2010-07-19 |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bipolar-disorder/DS00356/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis}}</ref> People with mania commonly experience an increase in energy and a decreased need for sleep, with many often getting as little as three or four hours of sleep per night.  Some can go days without sleeping.{{sfn|''DSM-IV''|1994|p=357}} A manic person may exhibit [[pressured speech]], with [[racing thoughts|thoughts experienced as racing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bipolar.about.com/od/maniahypomani1/a/mania.htm |title=Warning Signs of Mania |last=Read |first=Kimberly |publisher=About.com |date=2010-02-27 |accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref> Attention span is low, and a person in a manic state may be easily distracted. Judgment may be impaired, and sufferers may go on spending sprees or engage in risky behavior that is not normal for them. They may indulge in substance abuse, particularly alcohol or other depressants, cocaine or other stimulants, or sleeping pills. Their behavior may become aggressive, intolerant, or intrusive. They may feel out of control or unstoppable, or as if they have been "chosen" and are "on a special mission", or have other grandiose or delusional ideas. Sexual drive may increase. At more extreme levels, a person in a manic state can experience [[psychosis]], or a break with reality, where thinking is affected along with mood.<ref name="NIHpublication08-3679">{{cite web | title =Bipolar Disorder | url = http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/bipolar-disorder/complete-index.shtml | publisher =National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) | date = Revised 2012 | accessdate = 6 July 2012 }}</ref> This can occasionally lead to violent behaviors.<ref name=Dean2007>{{cite journal|last=Dean|first=k|coauthors=Walsh E, Morgan C, et al.|title=Aggressive behaviour at first contact with services: findings from the AESOP First Episode Psychosis Study|journal=Psychological Medicine|year=2007|volume=37|pages=547–57|pmid=17018170|doi=10.1017/S003329170600892|issue=4}}</ref> Some people in a manic state experience severe [[anxiety]] and are irritable (to the point of rage), while others are [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoric]] and grandiose.  The severity of manic symptoms can be measured by rating scales such as the [[Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale]]<ref>{{cite pmid|9359982}}</ref> and clinician-based  [[Young Mania Rating Scale]].<ref name="YMRS_paper">{{cite pmid|728692}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|20488276}}</ref>

The onset of a manic episode is often foreshadowed by sleep disturbances.  Mood changes, [[Psychomotor agitation|psychomotor]] and appetite changes, and an increase in anxiety can also occur up to three weeks before a manic episode develops.<ref name="Mansell2008" />

=== Hypomanic episodes ===
[[Hypomania]] is a mild to moderate level of elevated mood, characterized by optimism, pressure of speech and activity, and decreased need for sleep. Generally, hypomania does not inhibit functioning as mania does.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/hypomania-mania-symptoms|title=Hypomania and Mania Symptoms in Bipolar Disorder|publisher=WebMD.com|date=January 10, 2010}}</ref> Many people with hypomania are actually more productive than usual, while manic individuals have difficulty completing tasks due to a shortened attention span. Some hypomanic people show increased creativity, although others demonstrate poor judgment and irritability. Many experience [[hypersexuality]].  Hypomanic people generally have increased energy and increased activity levels. They do not, however, have [[delusions]] or hallucinations.

Hypomania may feel good to the person who experiences it. Thus, even when family and friends recognize mood swings, the individual often will deny that anything is wrong.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/health/bipolar/bipolar.htm |title=Bipolar Disorder: NIH Publication No. 95-3679|publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health|date=September 1995 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080429204140/http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/health/bipolar/bipolar.htm |archivedate = 2008-04-29}}</ref>   What might be called a "hypomanic event", if not accompanied by depressive episodes, is often not deemed as problematic, unless the mood changes are uncontrollable, volatile or mercurial.  If left untreated, an episode of hypomania can last anywhere from a few days to several years. Most commonly, symptoms continue for a few weeks to a few months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/bipolar-2-disorder|title=Bipolar II Disorder Symptoms and Signs|publisher=Web M.D.|accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref>

=== Depressive episodes ===
Signs and symptoms of the [[Major depressive episode|depressive phase]] of bipolar disorder include persistent feelings of [[sadness]], [[anxiety]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anger]], [[Solitude|isolation]], or [[hopelessness]]; disturbances in sleep and appetite; fatigue  and loss of interest in usually enjoyable activities; problems concentrating; loneliness, self-loathing, apathy or indifference; [[depersonalization]]; loss of interest in sexual activity; shyness or [[social anxiety]]; irritability, chronic pain (with or without a known cause); lack of motivation; and morbid suicidal thoughts. In severe cases, the individual may become [[psychotic]], a condition also known as severe bipolar depression with psychotic features. These symptoms include [[delusion]]s or, less commonly, [[hallucination]]s, usually unpleasant. A major depressive episode persists for at least two weeks, and may continue for over six months if left untreated.<ref>{{cite journal|title=APA Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders: Comprehensive Guidelines and Guideline Watches |volume=1 |year=2006 |doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890423363.50051|chapter=Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Bipolar Disorder Second Edition|isbn=978-0-89042-336-3}}</ref>

=== Mixed affective episodes ===
In the context of bipolar disorder, a [[Mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed state]] is a condition during which symptoms of mania and depression occur simultaneously.  Typical examples include weeping during a manic episode or racing thoughts during a depressive episode. Individuals may also feel very frustrated in this state, for example thinking grandiose thoughts while at the same time feeling like a failure.  Mixed states are often the most dangerous period of mood disorders, during which the risks of [[substance abuse]], [[panic disorder]], suicide attempts, and other complications increase greatly.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goldman E |title=Severe Anxiety, Agitation are Warning Signals of Suicide in Bipolar Patients |journal=Clin Psychiatr News |page=25 |year=1999}}</ref>

=== Associated features ===
{{main|Associated features of bipolar disorder}}
Associated features are clinical phenomena that often accompany the disorder but are not part of the diagnostic criteria. In adults with the condition, bipolar disorder is often accompanied by changes in [[Cognition|cognitive]] processes and abilities. These include reduced [[attention]]al and [[Executive functions|executive]] capabilities and impaired [[memory]]. How the individual processes the world also depends on the phase of the disorder, with differential characteristics between the manic, hypomanic and depressive states.<ref name="Mansell2008">{{cite pmid|17825463}}</ref> Some studies have found a significant association between bipolar disorder and [[creativity]].<ref name="pmid20936438">{{cite pmid|20936438}}</ref> Some patients may have difficulty in maintaining relationships.{{sfn|Jamison|Goodwin|2007|p=338}}

There are several common childhood precursors seen in children who later receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. These include mood abnormalities, full major depressive episodes, and [[ADHD]].<ref name="pmid2504732">{{cite pmid|2504732}}</ref>

== Causes ==
The causes of bipolar disorder likely vary between individuals. [[Twin studies]] have been limited by relatively small sample sizes but have indicated a substantial genetic contribution, as well as environmental influence. For bipolar I, the (probandwise) [[concordance (genetics)|concordance]] rates in modern studies have been consistently put at around 40% in [[monozygotic]] twins (same genes), compared to 0 to 10% in [[dizygotic]] twins.<ref name="Kieseppa_2004">{{cite pmid|15465978}}</ref> A combination of bipolar I, II and [[cyclothymia]] produced concordance rates of 42% vs 11%, with a relatively lower ratio for bipolar II that likely reflects [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneity]]. The overall [[heritability]] of the bipolar spectrum has been put at 0.71.<ref name="Edvardsen2008">{{cite pmid|17692389}}</ref> There is overlap with [[unipolar depression]] and if this is also counted in the co-twin the concordance with bipolar disorder rises to 67% in monozygotic twins and 19% in dizigotic.<ref>{{cite pmid|12742871}}</ref> The relatively low concordance between dizygotic twins brought up together suggests that shared family environmental effects are limited, although the ability to detect them has been limited by small sample sizes.<ref name="Edvardsen2008" />

=== Genetic ===
Genetic studies have suggested many [[chromosomal]] regions and [[candidate gene]]s appearing to relate to bipolar disorder's development, but the results are not consistent and often not replicated.<ref>{{cite pmid|17239033}}</ref>

Although the first [[genetic linkage]] finding for mania was in 1969,<ref>{{cite pmid|5304735}}</ref> the linkage studies have been inconsistent.<ref name="Burmeister2008" /> Meta-analyses of linkage studies detected either no significant genome-wide findings or, using a different methodology, only two genome-wide significant peaks, on chromosome 6q and on 8q21.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Neither have genome-wide [[genetic association|association]] studies brought a consistent focus—each has identified new loci.<ref name="Burmeister2008">{{cite pmid|18560438}}</ref> Nonparametric linkage analysis using rank based methods did not detect genome-wide significant linkage findings<ref name="pmid12802785">{{cite journal|last=Segurado|first=R|coauthors=Detera-Wadleigh, SD; Levinson, DF; Lewis, CM; Gill, M; Nurnberger JI, Jr; Craddock, N; DePaulo, JR; Baron, M; Gershon, ES; Ekholm, J; Cichon, S; Turecki, G; Claes, S; Kelsoe, JR; Schofield, PR; Badenhop, RF; Morissette, J; Coon, H; Blackwood, D; McInnes, LA; Foroud, T; Edenberg, HJ; Reich, T; Rice, JP; Goate, A; McInnis, MG; McMahon, FJ; Badner, JA; Goldin, LR; Bennett, P; Willour, VL; Zandi, PP; Liu, J; Gilliam, C; Juo, SH; Berrettini, WH; Yoshikawa, T; Peltonen, L; Lönnqvist, J; Nöthen, MM; Schumacher, J; Windemuth, C; Rietschel, M; Propping, P; Maier, W; Alda, M; Grof, P; Rouleau, GA; Del-Favero, J; Van Broeckhoven, C; Mendlewicz, J; Adolfsson, R; Spence, MA; Luebbert, H; Adams, LJ; Donald, JA; Mitchell, PB; Barden, N; Shink, E; Byerley, W; Muir, W; Visscher, PM; Macgregor, S; Gurling, H; Kalsi, G; McQuillin, A; Escamilla, MA; Reus, VI; Leon, P; Freimer, NB; Ewald, H; Kruse, TA; Mors, O; Radhakrishna, U; Blouin, JL; Antonarakis, SE; Akarsu, N|title=Genome scan meta-analysis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, part III: Bipolar disorder.|journal=American journal of human genetics|date=2003 Jul|volume=73|issue=1|pages=49–62|doi=10.1086/376547|pmid=12802785|pmc=1180589|displayauthors=30}}</ref>

Findings point strongly to heterogeneity, with different genes being implicated in different families.<ref>{{cite pmid|12802785}}</ref> Individual genes are likely to have only a small effect and to be involved in some aspect related to the disorder (and a broad range of "normal" human behavior) rather than the disorder per se.<ref name="Serretti" />  Robust and replicable genome-wide significant associations showed several common polymorphisms, including variants within the genes [[CACNA1C]], [[ODZ4]], and [[NCAN]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60855-7}}</ref>

[[Paternal age effect|Advanced paternal age]] has been linked to a somewhat increased chance of bipolar disorder in offspring, consistent with a hypothesis of increased new [[genetic mutations]].<ref>{{cite pmid|18762589}}</ref>

=== Physiological ===
[[File:GFPneuron.png|alt=microscopic image of a neuron|thumb|Brain imaging studies have revealed differences in the volume of various brain regions between BD patients and healthy control subjects]]
Abnormalities in the structure and/or function of certain brain circuits could underlie bipolar. Meta-analyses of structural MRI studies in bipolar disorder report an increase in the volume of the [[lateral ventricles]], [[globus pallidus]] and increase in the rates of deep white matter [[hyperintensities]].<ref>{{cite pmid|18762588}}</ref><ref name="pmid19721106">{{cite pmid|19721106}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/bipolardatabase/ |title=Bipolar MRI Database |format= |work=Bipolar Disorder Neuroimaging Database (BiND) |accessdate=}}</ref> Functional MRI findings suggest that abnormal modulation between ventral [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] and [[limbic system|limbic]] regions, especially the [[amygdala]], likely contribute to poor emotional regulation and mood symptoms.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1399-5618.2012.01022.x}}</ref>

According to the "kindling" hypothesis, when people who are genetically predisposed toward bipolar disorder experience stressful events, the stress threshold at which mood changes occur becomes progressively lower, until the episodes eventually start (and recur) spontaneously. There is evidence of [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) abnormalities in bipolar disorder due to [[stress (biological)|stress]].<ref name="Post-1992">{{Cite pmid|1353322 }}</ref><ref name="Monroe-2005">{{Cite pmid|15783292}}</ref><ref name="Daban-2005">{{Cite pmid|15826743}}</ref><ref name="Bender-2011">{{Cite pmid|21334286}}</ref>

Other brain components which have been proposed to play a role are the [[mitochondria]],<ref name="pmid16027739">{{cite pmid|16027739}}</ref> and a sodium ATPase pump,{{sfn|Brown|Basso|2004|p=16}} causing cyclical periods of poor neuron firing (depression) and hypersensitive neuron firing (mania). This may only apply for type one, but type two apparently results from a large confluence of factors.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} [[Circadian rhythm]]s and melatonin activity also seem to be altered.<ref name="pmid19909672">{{cite pmid|19909672}}</ref>

=== Environmental ===
Evidence suggests that environmental factors play a significant role in the development and course of bipolar disorder, and that individual psychosocial variables may interact with genetic dispositions.<ref name="Serretti">{{cite pmid|18332878}}</ref> There is fairly consistent evidence from prospective studies that recent life events and interpersonal relationships contribute to the likelihood of onsets and recurrences of bipolar mood episodes, as they do for onsets and recurrences of unipolar depression.<ref name="Alloy2005">{{cite pmid|16140445}}</ref> There have been repeated findings that between a third and a half of adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder report traumatic/abusive experiences in childhood, which is associated on average with earlier onset, a worse course, and more co-occurring disorders such as [[PTSD]].<ref>{{cite pmid|16581389}}</ref> The total number of reported stressful events in childhood is higher in those with an adult diagnosis of bipolar spectrum disorder compared to those without, particularly events stemming from a harsh environment rather than from the child's own behavior.<ref>{{cite pmid|18606036}}</ref>

=== Neurological ===
Less commonly bipolar disorder or a bipolar-like disorder may occur as a result of or in association with a neurological condition or injury.  Such conditions and injuries may include (but are not limited to) [[stroke]], [[traumatic brain injury]], [[HIV]] infection, [[multiple sclerosis]], [[porphyria]] and rarely [[temporal lobe epilepsy]].<ref>Murray ED, Buttner N, Price BH. (2012) Depression and Psychosis in Neurological Practice. In: Neurology in Clinical Practice, 6th Edition. Bradley WG, Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J (eds.) Butterworth Heinemann. April 12, 2012. ISBN 1437704344 | ISBN 978-1437704341</ref>

=== Evolutionary ===
Because bipolar disorder affects an individual’s ability to function in society and has a high morbidity rate, [[evolutionary theory]] would suggest that the genes responsible would have been naturally selected against, effectively culling the disorder. Yet there continue to be high rates of bipolar disorder in many populations, suggesting an evolutionary benefit to the genes responsible.

Proponents of [[evolutionary medicine]] hypothesize that the genes that cause severe bipolar disorder when inherited in large doses may actually increase fitness when inherited in small doses.<ref>Phelps, J. "Chapter 5: The Big Picture--There Must Be Some Evolutionary Advantage?" ''The Biological Basis of Bipolar Disorder''. Retrieved from http://www.psycheducation.org/BipolarMechanism/5BigPicture.htm</ref> High rates of bipolar disorder throughout history suggest that the ability to switch between depressive and manic moods conveyed some evolutionary advantage on ancestral humans. Theories put forward to explain the [[Evolutionary approaches to depression|evolutionary advantages of major depressive disorder]] may also explain the adaptiveness of the depressive episodes of bipolar disorder. For example, in individuals under increased stress, depressive mood may serve as a defensive strategy that causes the individual to retreat from the external stressor, increase sleep, and preserve resources and energy for better times.<ref>{{cite pmid|16236231}}</ref> Additionally, manic moods may convey advantage in some situations. Creativity, confidence, and high energy have all been linked to mania and hypomania.<ref>Jamison, K. R. (1993). ''Touched With Fire: Manic-depressive illness and the artistic temperament''. New York, NY: The Free Press.</ref><ref>Carey, B. (2005, April 6). "Hypomania's up side distinct but linked to bipolar disorder." ''New York Times News Service''. Retrieved from http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050406/news_1c06hypo.html</ref> The ability to utilize mild manic symptoms to be more productive and think more creatively during stress-free times may have increased the fitness of ancestral humans. . Being able to employ both hypomania and mild depression convey advantages that benefit individuals in a variable environment. However, if the genes enabling the manipulation of both of these moods are over activated, the manic and/or severe depressive moods of full bipolar disorder may be triggered instead.

Evolutionary biologists have hypothesized that bipolar disorder could have come from an adaptation to extreme climactic conditions in the northern [[temperate zone]] during the [[Pleistocene]]. The Evolutionary Origin of Bipolar Disorder (EOBD) hypothesis states that during the short summers of extreme climactic zones, hypomania would be adaptive, allowing the completion of many tasks necessary for survival within a short period of time. During long winters the lethargy, [[hypersomnia]], lack of interest in social activities, and overeating of depression would be adaptive to group cohesion and survival.<ref>Sherman, J. (2001). "Evolutionary Origin of Bipolar Disorder (EOBD)". ''Psycoloquy'', 12(028), Retrieved from http://www.cogsci.ecs.soton.ac.uk/cgi/psyc/newpsy?12.028</ref> Evidence for the EOBD hypothesis include an association between bipolar disorder and a cold-adapted build, correlation between seasonality and mood changes in those with bipolar disorder, and low rates of bipolar disorder in African Americans.<ref>{{cite pmid|22036090}}</ref> The EOBD hypothesis suggests that in the absence of the extreme climactic conditions that fostered the success of bipolar disorder genes, many bipolar disorder behaviors are maladaptive and can often severely impair normal functioning.

== Prevention ==
[[Mental disorder#Prevention|Prevention]] of bipolar has focused on stress (such as childhood adversity or highly conflictual families) which, although not a diagnostically specific causal agent for bipolar, does place genetically and biologically vulnerable individuals at risk for a more pernicious course of illness.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18606036</ref> There has been debate regarding the causal relationship between usage of [[cannabis]] and bipolar disorder.<ref>{{Cite journal| pmc = 2811144| last1 = Khan| first1 = MA| last2 = Akella| first2 = S| title = Cannabis-Induced Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features: A Case Report| volume = 6| issue = 12| pages = 44–48| journal = Psychiatry (Edgmont) }}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is based on the self-reported experiences of an individual as well as [[Abnormality (behavior)|abnormalities in behavior]] reported by family members, friends or co-workers, followed by secondary signs observed by a [[psychiatrist]], [[nurse]], [[social worker]], [[clinical psychologist]] or other clinician in a clinical assessment.  There are lists of criteria for someone to be so diagnosed. These depend on both the presence and duration of certain signs and symptoms. Assessment is usually done on an outpatient basis; admission to an inpatient facility is considered if there is a risk to oneself or others. The most widely used criteria for diagnosing bipolar disorder are from the American Psychiatric Association's [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], the current version being DSM-IV-TR, and the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization's]] [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]], currently the ICD-10. The latter criteria are typically used in Europe and other regions while the DSM criteria are used in the USA and other regions, as well as prevailing in research studies. The [[DSM-V]], to be published in 2013, will likely include further and more accurate sub-typing.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1002/0470017953.ch11}}</ref>

An initial assessment may include a physical exam by a physician. Although there are no biological tests which confirm bipolar disorder, tests may be carried out to exclude medical illnesses such as [[hypothyroidism|hypo-]] or [[hyperthyroidism]], metabolic disturbance, a systemic infection or chronic disease, and [[syphilis]] or [[HIV]] infection. An [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] may be used to exclude [[epilepsy]], and a [[Computed tomography|CT scan]] of the head to exclude brain lesions. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific ''medical'' indication.

Several [[rating scale]]s for the [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] and evaluation of bipolar disorder exist, such as the [[Bipolar spectrum diagnostic scale]].<ref name="pmid19122534"/> The use of evaluation scales can not substitute a full clinical interview but they serve to systematize the recollection of symptoms.<ref name="pmid19122534"/>  On the other hand instruments for the screening of bipolar disorder have low sensitivity{{clarify|date=April 2012|reason=Sensitivity to change as in ref abstract or of detection or what?

=== Bipolar spectrum ===
Bipolar spectrum refers to a category of [[mood disorders]] that feature abnormally elevated or depressed mood. These disorders range from [[bipolar I disorder]], featuring full-blown [[Mania|manic]] episodes, to [[cyclothymia]], featuring less prominent [[hypomanic]] episodes, to "subsyndromal" conditions where only some of the criteria for mania or hypomania are met. These disorders typically also involve [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]] symptoms or episodes that alternate with the elevated mood states, or with [[mixed episodes]] that feature symptoms of both.<ref>

The concept of the bipolar [[spectrum disorder|spectrum]] is similar to that of [[Emil Kraepelin]]'s original concept of manic depressive illness.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/441617 Across the Bipolar Spectrum: From Practice to Research]</ref> Currently, manic depressive illness is usually referred to as bipolar disorder or simply bipolar.  A simple nomenclature system was introduced in 1978 to classify more easily individuals' affectedness within the spectrum.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Angst | first1 = J | last2 = Felder |first2 = W | last3 = Frey | first3 = R | last4 = Stassen | first4 = HH | title = The course of affective disorders. I.

Points on the spectrum using this nomenclature are denoted using the following codes:
* ''M''—severe [[mania]]
* ''D''—[[severe depression]] (unipolar depression)
* ''m''—less severe mania ([[hypomania]])
* ''d''—less severe depression

Thus, ''mD'' represents a case with hypomania and major depression.  A further distinction is sometimes made in the ordering of the letters, to represent the order of the episodes, where the patient's normal state is [[Euthymia (medicine)|euthymic]], interrupted by episodes of mania followed by depression (''MD'') or vice versa (''DM'').

Employing this schema, major depression would be denoted ''D''. Unipolar mania (''M'') is, depending on the authority cited, either very rare,<ref>[http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/neuro/neuro00/web3/Wachterman.html Why No "Unipolar Mania" Listing in DSM-IV? | Serendip's Exchange<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> or nonexistent with such cases actually being ''Md''.

Unipolar hypomania (''m'') without accompanying depression has been noted in the medical literature.<ref>Mood episodes and mood disorders: patterns of incidence and conversion in the first three decades of life, Katja  Beesdo et al.,Bipolar Disorders Volume 11 Issue 6, Pages 637 - 64http://www3.interscience.wiley.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/journal/122542146/abstract</ref> There is speculation as to whether this condition may occur with greater frequency in the general, untreated population; successful social function of these potentially high-achieving individuals may lead to being labeled as normal, rather than as individuals with substantial dysregulation.

=== Criteria and subtypes ===
There is no clear consensus as to how many types of bipolar disorder exist.<ref>{{cite pmid|16488021}}</ref> In [[DSM-IV-TR]] and [[ICD-10]], bipolar disorder is conceptualized as a spectrum of disorders occurring on a continuum. The DSM-IV-TR lists three specific subtypes and one for non-specified:{{sfn|''DSM-IV''|2000}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://behavenet.com/bipolar-disorder#301 |title=Bipolar Disorder |format= |work=BehaveNet |accessdate= }}</ref>

[[Bipolar I disorder]]: One or more [[manic episodes]]. Subcategories specify whether there has been more than one episode, and the type of the most recent episode.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://behavenet.com/bipolar-i-disorder#301 |title=Bipolar I Disorder |format= |work=BehaveNet |accessdate= }}</ref> A depressive or hypomanic episode is not required for diagnosis, but it frequently occurs.

[[Bipolar II disorder]]: No manic episodes, but one or more [[hypomanic]] episodes and one or more [[major depressive episode]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://behavenet.com/bipolar-ii-disorder#301 |title=Bipolar II Disorder |format= |work=BehaveNet |accessdate= }}</ref>  Hypomanic episodes do not go to the full extremes of mania (''i.e.'', do not usually cause severe social or occupational impairment, and are without [[psychosis]]), and this can make bipolar II more difficult to diagnose, since the hypomanic episodes may simply appear as a period of successful high productivity and is reported less frequently than a distressing, crippling depression.

[[Cyclothymia]]: A history of hypomanic episodes with periods of [[Clinical depression|depression]] that do not meet criteria for [[major depressive episode]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://behavenet.com/cyclothymic-disorder#301 |title=Cyclothymic Disorder |format= |work=BehaveNet |accessdate= }}</ref> There is a low-grade cycling of mood which appears to the observer as a personality trait, and interferes with functioning.

[[Bipolar NOS|Bipolar disorder NOS]] (not otherwise specified): This is a catchall category, diagnosed when the disorder does not fall within a specific subtype.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://behavenet.com/not-otherwise-specified |title=Not Otherwise Specified |format= |work=BehaveNet |accessdate= }}</ref> [[Bipolar NOS]] can still significantly impair and adversely affect the quality of life of the patient.

The bipolar I and II categories have specifiers that indicate the presentation and course of the disorder. For example, the "with full interepisode recovery" specifier applies if there was full remission between the two most recent episodes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://behavenet.com/longitudinal-course-specifiers-mood-disorders-0#301 |title=Longitudinal Course Specifiers for Mood Disorders |format= |work=BehaveNet |accessdate= }}</ref>

==== Rapid cycling ====
Most people who meet criteria for bipolar disorder experience a number of episodes, on average 0.4 to 0.7 per year, lasting three to six months.<ref>{{cite pmid|11018218}}</ref> ''Rapid cycling'', however, is a course specifier that may be applied to any of the above subtypes. It is defined as having four or more episodes per year and is found in a significant proportion of individuals with bipolar disorder. The definition of rapid cycling most frequently cited in the literature (including the DSM) is that of Dunner and Fieve: at least four major depressive, manic, hypomanic or mixed episodes are required to have occurred during a 12-month period.<ref name=Bauer2008>{{cite journal|last=Bauer|first=M|coauthors=Beaulieu, S; Dunner, DL; Lafer, B; Kupka, R|title=Rapid cycling bipolar disorder&nbsp;– diagnostic concepts|journal=Bipolar Disorders|date=2008 Feb|volume=10|issue=1 Pt 2|pages=153–62|pmid=18199234|doi=10.1111/j.1399-5618.2007.00560.x}}</ref> Ultra-rapid (days) and ultra-ultra rapid or [[ultradian]] (within a day) cycling have also been described.<ref name="pmid14642014">{{cite pmid|14642014}}</ref> The literature examining the pharmacological treatment of rapid cycling is sparse and there is no clear consensus with respect to its optimal pharmacological management.<ref name=Fountoulakis2013>{{cite journal|last=Fountoulakis|first=KN|coauthors=Kontis, D; Gonda, X;  Yatham, LN|title=A systematic review of the evidence on the treatment of rapid cycling bipolar disorder|journal=Bipolar Disorders|date=2013 March|volume=15|issue=2|pages=115–227|doi=10.1111/bdi.12045}}</ref>

=== Differential diagnosis ===
There are several other mental disorders which may involve similar symptoms to bipolar disorder. These include [[schizophrenia]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), and some personality disorders, including [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline personality]].<ref name="Sood2005">{{cite pmid|15802085}}</ref><ref name="Magill2004">{{cite pmid|15453104}}</ref><ref name="Bassett2012">{{cite pmid|22508593}}</ref>

It has been noted that the bipolar disorder diagnosis is officially characterised in historical terms such that, technically, anyone with a history of (hypo)mania and depression has bipolar disorder whatever their current or future functioning and vulnerability. This has been described as "an ethical and methodological issue", as it means no one can be considered as being recovered (only "in [[remission (medicine)|remission]]") from bipolar disorder according to the official criteria. This is considered especially problematic given that brief hypomanic episodes are widespread among people generally and not necessarily associated with dysfunction.<ref name="Mansell2008" />

== Comorbid conditions ==
The diagnosis of bipolar disorder can be complicated by coexisting (comorbid) psychiatric conditions such as [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]], [[panic disorder]] and [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]]. [[Substance abuse]] may predate the appearance of bipolar symptoms, further complicating the diagnosis. A careful longitudinal analysis of symptoms and episodes, enriched if possible by discussions with friends and family members, is crucial to establishing a treatment plan where these comorbidities exist.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sagman D and Tohen M |title=Comorbidity in Bipolar Disorder: The Complexity of Diagnosis and Treatment |journal=Psychiatric Times |year=2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1391541}}</ref>

== Management ==
{{main|Treatment of bipolar disorder}}
[[File:Light Therapy Lamp.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Light therapy]] is one of several approaches to treating bipolar disorder. No one method is universally successful and most persons suffering from the illness need several forms of support.]]
There are a number of [[pharmacological]] and [[psychotherapeutic]] techniques used to treat bipolar disorder. Individuals may use [[self-help groups for mental health|self-help]] and pursue [[recovery model|recovery]].

Hospitalization may be required especially with the manic episodes present in bipolar I. This can be voluntary or (if mental health legislation allows and varying state-to-state regulations in the USA) involuntary (called civil or [[involuntary commitment]]). Long-term inpatient stays are now less common due to [[deinstitutionalization]], although these can still occur.<ref name="BeckerKilian2006">{{cite pmid|16445476}}</ref> Following (or in lieu of) a hospital admission, support services available can include drop-in centers, visits from members of a community mental health team or [[Assertive Community Treatment]] team, supported employment and patient-led support groups, intensive outpatient programs.  These are sometimes referred to partial-inpatient programs.<ref>{{cite pmid|17329468}}</ref>

=== Psychosocial ===
[[Psychotherapy]] is aimed at alleviating core symptoms, recognizing episode triggers, reducing negative expressed emotion in relationships, recognizing [[prodromal]] symptoms before full-blown recurrence, and, practicing the factors that lead to maintenance of [[remission (medicine)|remission]]<ref>Lam et al., 1999; Miklowitz & Goldstein, 1997; Frank, 2005.{{full|date=February 2012|reason=no citations for these references}}</ref>{{sfn|Leahy|Johnson|2003}}{{sfn|Basco|Rush|2005}} [[Cognitive behavioural therapy]], [[family therapy|family-focused therapy]], and [[psychoeducation]] have the most evidence for efficacy in regard to relapse prevention, while [[interpersonal and social rhythm therapy]] and cognitive-behavioural therapy appear the most effective in regard to residual depressive symptoms. Most studies have been based only on bipolar I, however, and treatment during the acute phase can be a particular challenge.<ref>{{cite pmid|17444074}}</ref> Some clinicians emphasize the need to talk with individuals experiencing mania, to develop a [[therapeutic alliance]] in support of [[recovery model|recovery]].<ref>{{cite pmid|16170918}}</ref>

== Prognosis ==
For many individuals with bipolar disorder a good [[prognosis]] results from good treatment, which, in turn, results from an accurate [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. Because bipolar disorder can have a high rate of both under-diagnosis and [[misdiagnosis]],<ref name="Bowden"/> it is often difficult for individuals with the condition to receive timely and competent treatment.

Bipolar disorder can be a severely disabling medical condition. However, many individuals with bipolar disorder can live full and satisfying lives. Quite often, medication is needed to enable this. Persons with bipolar disorder may have periods of normal or near normal functioning between episodes.{{sfn|Bergen|1999}}

=== Functioning ===
A recent 20-year prospective study on bipolar I and II found that functioning varied over time along a spectrum from good to fair to poor. During periods of [[major depression]] or mania (in BPI), functioning was on average poor, with depression being more persistently associated with disability than mania. Functioning between episodes was on average good&nbsp;— more or less normal. Subthreshold symptoms were generally still substantially impairing, however, except for hypomania (below or above threshold) which was associated with improved functioning.<ref>{{cite pmid|16330720}}</ref>

Another study confirmed the seriousness of the disorder as "the standardized all-cause mortality ratio among patients with bipolar disorder is increased approximately two-fold." Bipolar disorder is currently regarded "as possibly the most costly category of mental disorders in the United States." Episodes of abnormality are associated with distress and disruption, and an elevated risk of [[suicide]], especially during depressive episodes.<ref>{{cite pmid|11545667}}</ref>

=== Recovery and recurrence ===
A naturalistic study from first admission for mania or mixed episode (representing the hospitalized and therefore most severe cases) found that 50% achieved syndromal recovery (no longer meeting criteria for the diagnosis) within six weeks and 98% within two years. Within two years, 72% achieved symptomatic recovery (no symptoms at all) and 43% achieved functional recovery (regaining of prior occupational and residential status). However, 40% went on to experience a new episode of mania or depression within 2 years of syndromal recovery, and 19% switched phases without recovery.<ref>{{cite pmid|14638578}}</ref>

Symptoms preceding a relapse ([[prodromal]]), specially those related to mania, can be reliably identified by people with bipolar disorder.<ref name="pmid12738039">{{cite pmid|12738039}}</ref> There have been intents to teach patients [[coping strategies]] when noticing such symptoms with encouraging results.<ref name="pmid16125292">{{cite pmid|16125292}}</ref>

=== Mortality ===
Bipolar disorder can cause suicidal ideation that leads to [[suicidal]] attempts. One out of three people with bipolar disorder report past attempts of suicide or complete it,<ref name="pmid20148862">{{cite pmid|20148862}}</ref> and the annual average suicide rate is 0.4%, which is 10 to 20 times that of the general population.{{sfn|Sadock|Kaplan|Sadock|2007|p=388}} The [[standardized mortality ratio]] from [[suicide]] in bipolar disorder is between 18 and 25.<ref name="MortBio_2006">{{cite web|title=Bipolar Disorder: Defining Remission and Selecting Treatment| author=Roger S.

Lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder type I, which includes at least one manic episode during a lifetime, has generally been estimated at 2%.<ref name="Soldani2005">{{cite pmid|15777359}}</ref> However, a reanalysis of data from the National Epidemiological Catchment Area survey in the United States suggested that 0.8% of the population experience a [[manic episode]] at least once (the diagnostic threshold for [[bipolar I]]) and a further 0.5% have a [[hypomanic]] episode (the diagnostic threshold for bipolar II or cyclothymia). Including sub-threshold diagnostic criteria, such as one or two symptoms over a short time-period, an additional 5.1% of the population, adding up to a total of 6.4%, were classified as having a bipolar spectrum disorder.<ref name="Judd_and_Akiskal_2003">{{cite pmid|12507745}}</ref> A more recent analysis of data from a second US [[National Comorbidity Survey]] found that 1% met lifetime prevalence criteria for bipolar I, 1.1% for bipolar II, and 2.4% for subthreshold symptoms.<ref>{{cite pmid|17485606}}</ref> There are conceptual and methodological limitations and variations in the findings. Prevalence studies of bipolar disorder are typically carried out by lay interviewers who follow fully structured/fixed interview schemes; responses to single items from such interviews may suffer limited validity. In addition, diagnoses (and therefore estimates of prevalence) vary depending on whether a categorical or [[spectrum approach]] is used. This consideration has led to concerns about the potential for both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Phelps J |title=Bipolar Disorder: Particle or Wave?

Rates are similar in men and women and, broadly, across different cultures and ethnic groups.{{sfn|Goodwin|Jamison|1990|loc=Chapter 7}} A 2000 study by the [[World Health Organization]] found that prevalence and incidence of bipolar disorder are very similar across the world. Age-standardized prevalence per 100,000 ranged from 421.0 in South Asia to 481.7 in Africa and Europe for men and from 450.3 in Africa and Europe to 491.6 in Oceania for women.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global burden of bipolar disorder in the year 2000|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/bod_bipolar.pdf|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|last=Ayuso-Mateos|first=Jose Luis|accessdate=December 9, 2012}}</ref> However, severity may differ widely across the globe. Disability-adjusted life year rates, for example, appear to be higher in developing countries, where medical coverage may be poorer and medication less available.

Within the United States, [[African American|African]] and [[European American]]s have similar rates of bipolar disorder, while [[Asian American]]s have lower rates.<ref name="kurasaki">{{cite book|title=Asian American Mental Health: Assessment Theories and Methods|last=Kurasaki|first=Karen S.|year=2002|pages=14–15}}</ref>

Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak years for the onset of bipolar disorder.<ref name="Christie88">{{cite pmid|3394882}}</ref>{{sfn|Goodwin|Jamison|2007|p=1945}} One study also found that in 10% of bipolar cases, the onset of mania had happened after the patient had turned 50.<ref>{{cite pmid|21188315}}</ref>

== History ==
{{main|History of bipolar disorder}}
[[File:E. Kraepelin.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|upright|German psychologist Emil Kraeplin first distinguished between manic–depressive illness and "dementia praecox" (now known as [[schizophrenia]]) in the late 19th century]]
Variations in moods and energy levels have been observed as part of the human experience since time immemorial.{{Weasel-inline|date=February 2013}} The words "[[melancholia]]" (an old word for [[depression (mood)|depression]]) and "mania" originated in [[Ancient Greek]]. The word melancholia is derived from ''melas''/μελας, meaning "black", and ''chole''/χολη, meaning "bile" or "gall",{{sfn|Liddell|Scott|1980}} indicative of the term's origins in pre-[[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] [[humoral]] theories. Within the humoral theories, mania was viewed as arising from an excess of [[yellow bile]], or a mixture of black and yellow bile. The [[linguistics|linguistic]] origins of mania, however, are not so clear-cut. Several etymologies are proposed by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] physician [[Caelius Aurelianus]], including the Greek word ''ania'', meaning "to produce great mental anguish", and ''manos'', meaning "relaxed" or "loose", which would contextually approximate to an excessive relaxing of the mind or soul.<ref name="Angst-2001">{{Cite  pmid|11869749}}</ref> There are at least five other candidates, and part of the confusion surrounding the exact etymology of the word mania is its varied usage in the pre-Hippocratic [[poetry]] and [[mythology|mythologies]].<ref name="Angst-2001"/>

In the early 1800s, French psychiatrist [[Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol]]'s lypemania, one of his affective [[monomania]]s, was the first elaboration on what was to become modern depression.<ref>''"at the beginning of the 19th century with Esquirol’s ‘affective monomanias’ (notably ‘lypemania’, the first elaboration of what was to become our modern depression)"'', Which came first, the condition or the drug?, London Review of Books, Vol. 32 No. 19,  7 October 2010, pages 31–33, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n19/mikkel-borch-jacobsen/which-came-first-the-condition-or-the-drug]</ref> The basis of the current conceptualisation of manic–depressive illness can be traced back to the 1850s; on January 31, 1854, [[Jules Baillarger]] described to the French Imperial [[Académie Nationale de Médecine|Academy of Medicine]] a [[Stereotypy|biphasic]] [[mental illness]] causing recurrent oscillations between mania and depression, which he termed ''folie à double forme'' ("dual-form insanity").<ref>{{cite pmid|15506718}} {{fr icon}}.</ref> Two weeks later, on February 14, 1854, [[Jean-Pierre Falret]] presented a description to the Academy on what was essentially the same disorder, and designated ''folie circulaire'' ("circular [[insanity]]") by him.<ref name="Sedler">{{cite pmid|6351641}}</ref>

These concepts were developed by the German [[psychiatrist]] [[Emil Kraepelin]] (1856–1926), who, using [[Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum|Kahlbaum]]'s concept of [[cyclothymia]],{{sfn|Millon|1996|p=290}} categorized and studied the natural course of untreated bipolar patients. He coined the term ''manic depressive [[psychosis]]'', after noting that periods of acute illness, manic or depressive, were generally punctuated by relatively symptom-free intervals where the patient was able to function normally.<ref>[[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelin, Emil]] (1921) ''Manic–depressive Insanity and Paranoia'' ISBN 0-405-07441-7</ref>

The term "manic–depressive ''reaction''" appeared in the first [[American Psychiatric Association]] Diagnostic Manual in 1952, influenced by the legacy of [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] who had introduced the paradigm illness as a reaction of biogenetic factors to psychological and social influences.{{sfn|Goodwin|Jamison|2007| loc=Chapter 1}} Subclassification of bipolar disorder was first proposed by German psychiatrist [[Karl Leonhard]] in 1957; he was also the first to introduce the terms ''bipolar'' (for those with mania) and ''unipolar'' (for those with depressive episodes only).{{sfn|Goodwin|Jamison|2007| loc=Introduction}}

Several dramatic works have portrayed characters with traits suggestive of the diagnosis that has been the subject of discussion by psychiatrists and film experts alike. A notable example is ''[[Mr. Jones (film)|Mr. Jones]]'' (1993), in which Mr. Jones ([[Richard Gere]]) swings from a manic episode into a depressive phase and back again, spending time in a psychiatric hospital and displaying many of the features of the syndrome.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=78–81}} In ''[[The Mosquito Coast]]'' (1986), Allie Fox ([[Harrison Ford]]) displays some features including recklessness, grandiosity, increased goal-directed activity and mood lability, as well as some paranoia.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=84–85}} Psychiatrists have suggested that [[Willy Loman]], the main character in [[Arthur Miller]]'s classic play ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', suffers from bipolar disorder,<ref>{{cite news|last=McKinley|first=Jesse|title=Get That Man Some Prozac; If the Dramatic Tension Is All in His Head|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/weekinreview/ideas-trends-get-that-man-some-prozac-if-the-dramatic-tension-is-all-in-his-head.html|accessdate=3 March 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 28, 1999}}</ref> though that specific term for the condition did not exist when the play was written.

{{main|Bipolar disorder in children}}
[[File:Lithium carbonate.jpg|thumb| [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] is the only medication approved for treating mania in children by the FDA]]

In the 1920s, [[Emil Kraepelin]] noted that manic episodes are rare before puberty.<ref name="pmid17195735"/> In general, bipolar disorder in children was not recognized in the first half of the twentieth century. This issue diminished with an increased following of the DSM criteria in the last part of the twentieth century.<ref name="pmid17195735"/><ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1469-7610.1960.tb01979.x}}</ref>

While in adults the course of bipolar disorder is characterized by discrete episodes of depression and mania with no clear symptomatology between them, in children and adolescents very fast mood changes or even chronic symptoms are the norm.<ref name="pmid17716034"/> On the other hand, pediatric bipolar disorder, instead of [[euphoria|euphoric]] [[mania]], commonly develops with outbursts of anger, irritability and [[psychosis]], less common in adults.<ref name="pmid17195735"/><ref name="pmid17716034"/>

The diagnosis of childhood bipolar disorder is controversial,<ref name="pmid17716034"/> although it is not under discussion that the typical symptoms of bipolar disorder have negative consequences for minors suffering them.<ref name="pmid17195735"/> The debate is mainly centered on whether what is called bipolar disorder in children refers to the same disorder as when diagnosing adults,<ref name="pmid17195735"/> and the related question of whether the criteria for diagnosis for adults are useful and accurate when applied to children.<ref name="pmid17716034"/> Regarding diagnosis of children, some experts recommend following the DSM criteria.<ref name="pmid17716034"/> Others believe that these criteria do not correctly separate children with bipolar disorder from other problems such as ADHD, and emphasize fast mood cycles.<ref name="pmid17716034"/> Still others argue that what accurately differentiates children with bipolar disorder is irritability.<ref name="pmid17716034"/> The practice parameters of the [[American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|AACAP]] encourage the first strategy.<ref name="pmid17195735"/><ref name="pmid17716034"/> American children and adolescents diagnosed with bipolar disorder in community hospitals increased 4-fold reaching rates of up to 40% in 10 years around the beginning of the 21st century, while in [[outpatient]] clinics it doubled reaching 6%.<ref name="pmid17716034"/> Studies using DSM criteria show that up to 1% of youth may have bipolar disorder.<ref name="pmid17195735"/>

Treatment involves medication and psychotherapy.<ref name="pmid17716034">{{cite pmid|17716034}}</ref> Drug prescription usually consists in [[mood stabilizer]]s and [[atypical antipsychotic]]s.<ref name="pmid17716034"/> Among the former, [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]] is the only compound approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for children.<ref name="pmid17195735">{{cite pmid|17195735}}</ref> Psychological treatment combines normally [[Psychoeducation|education on the disease]], [[Group psychotherapy|group therapy]] and [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].<ref name="pmid17716034"/> [[Chronic (medicine)|Chronic]] medication is often needed.<ref name="pmid17716034"/>

Current research directions for bipolar disorder in children include optimizing treatments, increasing the knowledge of the genetic and neurobiological basis of the pediatric disorder and improving diagnostic criteria.<ref name="pmid17716034"/> The [[DSM-V]] has proposed a new diagnosis which is considered to cover some presentations currently thought of as childhood-onset bipolar.<ref>{{cite web |date=2010-01-28 |author=DSM-5 Childhood and Adolescent Disorders Work Group |title=Proposed change: ...to the Mood Disorders Section of DSM-V |url=http://www.dsm5.org/Proposed%20Revision%20Attachments/Justification%20for%20Temper%20Dysregulation%20Disorder%20with%20Dysphoria.pdf |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |accessdate=2012-02-18}}<br />• {{cite press release |date=10 February 2010 |title=APA Announces Draft Diagnostic Criteria for DSM-5 |url=http://www.dsm5.org/Newsroom/Documents/Diag%20%20Criteria%20General%20FINAL%202.05.pdf |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |accessdate=2012-02-18}}</ref>

=== Elderly ===
There is a relative lack of knowledge about bipolar disorder in late life. There is evidence that it becomes less prevalent with age but nevertheless accounts for a similar percentage of psychiatric admissions; that older bipolar patients had first experienced symptoms at a later age; that later onset of mania is associated with more neurologic impairment; that substance abuse is considerably less common in older groups; and that there is probably a greater degree of variation in presentation and course, for instance individuals may develop new-onset mania associated with vascular changes, or become manic only after recurrent depressive episodes, or may have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at an early age and still meet criteria. There is also some weak evidence that mania is less intense and there is a higher prevalence of mixed episodes, although there may be a reduced response to treatment. Overall, there are likely more similarities than differences from younger adults.<ref name=Vasudev2010>{{cite journal|last=Vasudev|first=A|coauthors=Thomas, A|title='Bipolar disorder' in the elderly: what's in a name?|journal=Maturitas|date=2010 Jul|volume=66|issue=3|pages=231–5|pmid=20307944|doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2010.02.013}}</ref><ref name="pmid15383127">{{cite pmid|15383127}}</ref> In the elderly, recognition and treatment of bipolar disorder may be complicated by the presence of [[dementia]] or the side effects of medications being taken for other conditions.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Trinh NH, Forester B|title=Bipolar Disorder in the Elderly: Differential Diagnosis and Treatment |journal=Psychiatric Times|volume=24 |issue=14 |year=2007 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/bipolar-disorder/article/10168/54481}}</ref>
