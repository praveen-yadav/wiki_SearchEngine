'''''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum''''' is a [[Musical theatre|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and book by [[Burt Shevelove]] and [[Larry Gelbart]].

Inspired by the [[farce]]s of the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] playwright [[Plautus]] (251&ndash;183 BC), specifically ''[[Pseudolus]]'', ''[[Miles Gloriosus (play)|Miles Gloriosus]]'' and ''[[Mostellaria]]'', the musical tells the bawdy story of a [[slavery|slave]] named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door. The plot displays many classic elements of [[farce]], including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of [[mistaken identity]] (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from the line that [[vaudeville]] comedians often used to begin a story: "A funny thing happened on the way to the theater".

The musical's original 1962 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run won several [[Tony Award]]s, including Best Musical and Best Book. ''A Funny Thing'' has enjoyed several Broadway and [[West End theatre|West End]] revivals and was made into a successful film starring the original lead of the musical, [[Zero Mostel]].

==Productions==
===Original Broadway===
''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on May 8, 1962 at the [[Neil Simon Theatre|Alvin Theatre]], and then transferred to the [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]] and the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]], where the show closed on August 29, 1964, after 964 performances and 8 previews.

The show's creators originally wanted [[Phil Silvers]] in the lead role of [[Pseudolus]], but he turned them down, allegedly because he would have to perform onstage without his glasses, and his vision was so poor that he feared tripping into the orchestra pit. He is also quoted as turning down the role for being "[[The Phil Silvers Show|Sgt. Bilko]] in a toga". (Silvers went on to play the role—wearing his glasses—in a 1972 revival.) [[Milton Berle]] also passed on the role. Eventually, [[Zero Mostel]] was cast.<ref name=green>Green, Stanley and Green, Kay.[http://books.google.com/books?id=KDKFHniTy1YC&lpg=PA198&dq=%22Phil%20Silvers%22%20%22A%20Funny%20Thing%20Happened%20on%20the%20Way%20to%20the%20Forum%22%20Sondheim&pg=PA198#v=onepage&q=%22Phil%20Silvers%22%20%22A%20Funny%20Thing%20Happened%20on%20the%20Way%20to%20the%20Forum%22%20Sondheim&f=false "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way To the Forum"] ''Broadway Musicals, Show By Show'' (1996), (books.google) Hal Leonard Corporation, ISBN 0-7935-7750-0, p. 198</ref>

During the out of town pre-Broadway tryouts the show was attracting little business and not playing well. [[Jerome Robbins]] was called in by director [[George Abbott]] and producer [[Hal Prince]] to give advice and make changes. The biggest change Robbins made was a new opening number to replace "Love Is in the Air" and introduce the show as a bawdy, wild comedy. Stephen Sondheim wrote the song "Comedy Tonight" for this new opening.<ref name=green /> From that point on, the show was a success.

It was directed by George Abbott and produced by Hal Prince, with choreography by [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]] and uncredited staging and choreography by Jerome Robbins. The scenic and costume design was by [[Tony Walton]]. This wardrobe is on display at the Costume World Broadway Collection in Pompano Beach, Florida. The lighting design was by [[Jean Rosenthal]]. Along with Mostel, the musical featured a cast of seasoned performers, including [[Jack Gilford]] (Mostel's friend and fellow blacklist member), [[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]], [[John Carradine]], [[Ruth Kobart]] and [[Raymond Walburn]]. The young lovers were played by [[Brian Davies (actor)|Brian Davies]] and Preshy Marker. [[Karen Black]], originally cast as the ingenue, was replaced out of town.

The show won several [[Tony Award]]s: best musical, best actor, best supporting actor (Burns), best book, and best director. The score, Sondheim's first time on Broadway writing both words and music, was coolly received, however, not even garnering a nomination.

===London===
The show was presented two times in London's [[West End theatre|West End]]. The 1963 production and its 1986 revival were staged at the [[Novello Theatre|Strand Theatre]] and the [[Piccadilly Theatre]] respectively,<ref>[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/london_shows_chronology/1963.htm "Listing, 1963 production"] Guidetomusicaltheatre.com, retrieved December 9, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.thisistheatre.com/shows/piccadilly111.html "Listing, 1986 production"] Thisistheatre.com, retrieved December 9, 2009</ref> and featured [[Frankie Howerd]] starring as Pseudolus, [[Kenneth Connor]] as Hysterium, [['Monsewer' Eddie Gray]] as [[Senex]], [[Jon Pertwee]] as Marcus Lycus and [[Leon Greene]] as Miles Gloriosus. (Howerd went on to star in ''[[Up Pompeii!]]'', a 1969 British television comedy series set in ancient Pompeii, as the slave Lurcio, whose character was based on Pseudolus.)

In 2004 there was a limited-run revival at the [[Royal National Theatre]] starring [[Desmond Barrit]] as Pseudolus, [[Philip Quast]] as Miles Gloriosus, [[Hamish McColl]] as Hysterium and [[Isla Blair]] as Domina (who had previously played Philia in the 1963 production).<ref>Inverne, James.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/86645-Thoroughly_Modern_Millie_Closes_in_London_as_New_Musicals_Prepare_to_Open "Thoroughly Modern Millie Closes in London as New Musicals Prepare to Open"] Playbill.com, June 7, 2004</ref>

===Motion picture adaptation===
{{main|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)}}
''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' was made into a [[musical film]] in 1966, directed by [[Richard Lester]], with [[Zero Mostel]] and [[Jack Gilford]] re-creating their Broadway stage roles, [[Leon Greene]] reprising his West End stage role and [[Phil Silvers]] starred in an expanded role as "Marcus Lycus". [[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]] did not return for the film role of Senex, which was played in the film by [[Michael Hordern]]. [[Buster Keaton]] made his final film appearance in the role of Erronius.

===Broadway revivals===
In 1972 there was a critically well-received Broadway [[Revival (theatre)|revival]], directed by co-author [[Burt Shevelove]] and starring [[Phil Silvers]] as Pseudolus (followed later by [[Tom Poston]] in the role), [[Lew Parker]] as Senex and [[Reginald Owen]] as Erronius. [[Larry Blyden]], who played Hysterium, the role created by Jack Gilford, also co-produced. Two songs were dropped from the show, and two new Sondheim songs were added. The new songs included in this production had been added during a 1971 Los Angeles production: "Echo Song" (sung by Hero and Philia), and "Farewell" (added for [[Nancy Walker]] playing the role of Domina as she and Senex depart for the country). The production ran 156 performances, but had to close soon after Phil Silvers suffered a stroke. The show won Tonys for Silvers and Blyden.

The musical was also revived with great success in 1996, starring [[Nathan Lane]] as Pseudolus (replaced later in the run by [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and also by [[David Alan Grier]]), [[Mark Linn-Baker]] as Hysterium, [[Ernie Sabella]] as Lycus, [[Jim Stanek]] as Hero, [[Lewis J. Stadlen]] as Senex, and Cris Groenendaal as Miles Gloriosus. The production, directed by [[Jerry Zaks]], ran for 715 performances. Lane won the Best Actor Tony.

Every actor who has opened in the role of Pseudolus on Broadway (Zero Mostel, Phil Silvers and Nathan Lane) won a Best Actor Tony Award for their performance. In addition, [[Jason Alexander]], who performed as Pseudolus in one scene in [[Jerome Robbins' Broadway]], also won a Tony for Best Actor in a Musical.

==Plot==
[[File:Forum LP cover.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Graphic from the original Broadway cast album]]
In ancient Rome, some neighbors live in three adjacent houses. In the center is the house of Senex, who lives there with wife Domina, son Hero, and several slaves, including head slave Hysterium and the musical's main character Pseudolus. A slave belonging to Hero, Pseudolus wishes to buy, win, or steal his freedom. One of the neighboring houses is owned by Marcus Lycus, who is a buyer and seller of beautiful women; the other belongs to the ancient Erronius, who is abroad searching for his long-lost children (stolen in [[infant|infancy]] by [[Piracy|pirates]]).

One day, Senex and Domina go on a trip and leave Pseudolus in charge of Hero. Hero confides in Pseudolus that he is in love with the lovely Philia, one of the courtesans in the House of Lycus. Pseudolus promises to help him win Philia's love in exchange for his freedom. Unfortunately (as the two find out when they pay a visit on Lycus), Philia has been promised to the renowned warrior [[Miles Gloriosus]], who is on his way to claim her. Pseudolus, an excellent liar, uses Philia's cheery disposition to convince Lycus that she has picked up a [[Yersinia pestis|plague]] from [[Crete]], which causes its victims to smile endlessly in its terminal stages. By offering to isolate her in Senex's house, he is able to give Philia and Hero some time alone together, and the two fall in love. But Philia insists that, even though she is in love with Hero, she must honor her contract with the Captain, for "that is the way of a courtesan." To appease her, he tells her to wait ("that's what virgins do best, isn't it?") inside, and that he will have the captain knock three times when he arrives. Pseudolus comes up with a plan to slip Philia a sleeping potion that will render her unconscious. He will then tell Lycus that she has died of the Cretan plague, and will offer to remove the body. Hero will come along, and they will stow away on a ship headed for Greece. Satisfied with his plan, Pseudolus steals Hysterium's book of potions and has Hero read him the recipe for the sleeping potion; the only ingredient he lacks is "mare's sweat," and Pseudolus goes off in search of some.

Unexpectedly, Senex returns home early from his trip, and knocks three times on his own door. Philia comes out of the house, and, thinking that Senex is the Captain, offers herself up to him. Surprised but game, Senex instructs Philia to wait in the house for him, and she does. Hysterium arrives to this confusion, and tells Senex that Philia is the new maid that he has hired. Pseudolus returns, having procured the necessary mare's sweat; seeing that Senex has returned unexpectedly and grasping the need to keep him out of the way, Pseudolus discreetly sprinkles some of the horse-sweat onto him, then suggests that the road trip has left Senex in dire need of a bath. Taking the bait, Senex instructs Hysterium to draw him a bath in the long-abandoned house of Erronius. But while this is happening, Erronius returns home, finally having given up the search for his long-lost children. Hysterium, desperate to keep him out of the house where his master is bathing, tells the old man that his house has become haunted – a story seemingly confirmed by the sound of Senex singing in his bath. Erronius immediately determines to have a soothsayer come and banish the spirit from his house, and Pseudolus obligingly poses as one, telling Erronius that in order to banish the spirit, he must travel seven times around the seven hills of Rome (thus keeping the old man occupied and out of the way for quite a while).

When Miles Gloriosus arrives to claim his courtesan-bride, Pseudolus hides Philia on the roof of Senex's house; told that she has "escaped," Lycus is terrified to face the Captain's wrath. Pseudolus offers to impersonate Lycus and talk his way out of the mess but, his ingenuity flagging, he ends up merely telling the Captain that Philia has disappeared, and that he, "Lycus," will set out in search of her. Displeased and suspicious, Miles insists that his soldiers accompany Pseudolus, but the wily slave is able to lose them in Rome's winding streets.

Complicating matters further, Domina returns from her trip early, suspicious that her husband Senex is "up to something low." She disguises herself in virginal white robes and a veil (much like Philia's) to try to catch Senex being unfaithful. Pseudolus convinces Hysterium to help him by dressing in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] and pretending to be Philia, "dead" from the plague. Unfortunately, it turns out that Miles Gloriosus has just returned from Crete, where there is of course no actual plague. With the ruse thus revealed, the main characters run for their lives, resulting in a madcap chase across the stage with both Miles and Senex pursuing all three "Philia"s (Domina, Hysterium, and the actual Philia – all wearing identical white robes and veils). Meanwhile, the courtesans from the house of Marcus Lycus &ndash; who had been recruited as mourners at "Philia"'s ersatz funeral &ndash; have escaped, and Lycus sends his [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]]s out to bring them all back, adding to the general pandemonium.

Finally, the Captain's troops are able to round everyone up. His plot thoroughly unraveled, Pseudolus appears to be in deep trouble – but Erronius, completing his third circuit of the Roman hills, shows up fortuitously to discover that Miles Gloriosus and Philia are wearing matching rings which mark them as his long-lost children. Philia's betrothal to the Captain is obviously nullified by the unexpected revelation that he's her brother. Philia weds Hero; Pseudolus gets his freedom and the lovely slave girl Gymnasia; Gloriosus receives twin courtesans to replace Philia; Erronius gets his children, and a happy ending prevails for all – except for poor Senex, stuck with his shrewish wife Domina.

Notes: The song "Love Is in the Air" was originally intended as the opening number. The song was cut from the show and replaced with "Comedy Tonight".<ref>(no author).[http://www.sondheim.com/shows/a_funny_thing_happened/#cut_songs "Cut songs, 'A Funny Thing Happened'"] Sondheim.com, accessed August 16, 2011</ref> The song was later featured in the film ''[[The Birdcage]]'' (1996) and performed by [[Robin Williams]] and [[Christine Baranski]]. Another draft of the opening number, "Invocation and Instructions to the Audience," has been used in subsequent revues of Sondheim songs and was sung by Nathan Lane in the musical ''[[The Frogs (musical)|The Frogs]]''. "Pretty Little Picture" is frequently dropped from productions of the show, and one verse of "I'm Calm" is also frequently trimmed.
