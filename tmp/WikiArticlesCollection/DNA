'''Deoxyribonucleic acid''' ('''DNA''') is a molecule that encodes the [[genetics|genetic]] instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living [[organism]]s and many [[virus]]es. DNA is a [[nucleic acid]]; alongside [[protein]]s and [[carbohydrates]], nucleic acids compose the three major [[macromolecules]] essential for all known forms of [[life]]. Most DNA molecules are [[Nucleic acid double helix|double-stranded helices]], consisting of two long [[biopolymer]]s made of [[monomer|simpler units]] called [[nucleotide]]s—each nucleotide is composed of a [[nucleobase]] ([[guanine]], [[adenine]], [[thymine]], and [[cytosine]]), recorded using the letters G, A, T, and C, as well as a [[backbone chain|backbone]] made of alternating [[Monosaccharide|sugar]]s ([[deoxyribose]]) and [[phosphate]] groups (related to [[phosphoric acid]]), with the nucleobases (G, A, T, C) attached to the sugars.

DNA is well-suited for biological information storage.  The DNA backbone is resistant to cleavage, and both strands of the double-stranded structure store the same biological information.  Biological information is replicated as the two strands are separated.

The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are therefore [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|anti-parallel]], one backbone being 3′ (three prime) and the other 5′ (five prime). This refers to the direction the 3rd and 5th carbon on the sugar molecule is facing. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of molecules called nucleobases (informally, ''bases''). It is the [[Nucleic acid sequence|sequence]] of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information.  Under the [[genetic code]], [[RNA]] strands are translated to specify the sequence of [[amino acid]]s within proteins. These RNA strands are initially created using DNA strands as a template in a process called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].

Within cells, DNA is organized into long structures called [[chromosome]]s. During [[cell division]] these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of [[DNA replication]], providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic organisms]] ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s) store most of their DNA inside the [[cell nucleus]] and some of their DNA in [[organelle]]s, such as [[mitochondria]] or [[chloroplasts]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Russell | first = Peter | title = iGenetics | publisher = Benjamin Cummings | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-8053-4553-1 }}</ref> In contrast, [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]) store their DNA only in the [[cytoplasm]]. Within the chromosomes, [[chromatin]] proteins such as [[histone]]s compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

Scientists use DNA as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the [[ergodic theorem]] and the theory of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and nano-fabrication. Among notable advances in this field are [[DNA origami]] and DNA-based hybrid materials.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mashaghi A, Katan A | url= http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2545v1.pdf |title=A physicist's view of DNA |journal=De Physicus|volume=24e |issue=3 |pages=59–61 |year=2013}}</ref>

The obsolete synonym "'''desoxyribonucleic acid'''" may occasionally be encountered, for example, in pre-1953 genetics.

===Nucleobase classification===
The nucleobases are classified into two types: the [[purine]]s, A and G, being fused five- and six-membered [[heterocyclic compound]]s, and the [[pyrimidine]]s, the six-membered rings C and T.<ref name=berg/> A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, [[uracil]] (U), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a [[methyl group]] on its ring. In addition to RNA and DNA a large number of artificial [[nucleic acid analogues]] have also been created to study the properties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Verma S, Eckstein F |title=Modified oligonucleotides: synthesis and strategy for users |journal=Annu.

Uracil is not usually found in DNA, occurring only as a breakdown product of cytosine. However in a number of bacteriophages – ''Bacillus subtilis'' bacteriophages PBS1 and PBS2 and ''Yersinia'' bacteriophage piR1-37 – thymine has been replaced by uracil.<ref name=Kiljunen2005>{{cite journal | author = Kiljunen S, Hakala K, Pinta E, Huttunen S, Pluta P, Gador A, Lönnberg H, Skurnik M | year = 2005 | title = Yersiniophage phiR1-37 is a tailed bacteriophage having a 270 kb DNA genome with thymidine replaced by deoxyuridine | pmid=16339954 | journal = Microbiology | volume = 151 | issue = 12| pages = 4093–4102 | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.28265-0 }}</ref>

===Grooves===
Twin helical strands form the DNA backbone. Another double helix may be found tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may provide a [[binding site]]. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22&nbsp;Å wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12&nbsp;Å wide.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wing R, Drew H, Takano T, Broka C, Tanaka S, Itakura K, Dickerson R |title=Crystal structure analysis of a complete turn of B-DNA |journal=Nature |volume=287 |issue=5784 |pages=755–8 |year=1980 |pmid=7432492 |doi=10.1038/287755a0|bibcode = 1980Natur.287..755W }}</ref> The narrowness of the minor groove means that the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove.

===Base pairing===
{{Further2|[[Base pair]]}}

In a DNA double helix, each type of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called complementary [[base pair]]ing. Here, purines form [[hydrogen bond]]s to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a base pair. As hydrogen bonds are not [[covalent bond|covalent]], they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can therefore be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high [[temperature]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clausen-Schaumann H, Rief M, Tolksdorf C, Gaub H |title=Mechanical stability of single DNA molecules |pmc=1300792 |journal=Biophys J |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=1997–2007 |year=2000 |pmid=10733978 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76747-6 |bibcode=2000BpJ....78.1997C}}</ref> As a result of this complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. Indeed, this reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.<ref name=Alberts/>

The two types of base pairs form different numbers of hydrogen bonds, AT forming two hydrogen bonds, and GC forming three hydrogen bonds (see figures, right).
DNA with high [[GC-content]] is more stable than DNA with low GC-content.

As noted above, most DNA molecules are actually two polymer strands, bound together in a helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double stranded structure ('''dsDNA''') is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart&nbsp;– a process known as melting&nbsp;– to form two single-stranded DNA molecules ('''ssDNA''') molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).

The stability of the dsDNA form depends not only on the GC-content (% G,C basepairs) but also on sequence (since stacking is sequence specific) and also length (longer molecules are more stable). The stability can be measured in various ways; a common way is the "melting temperature", which is the temperature at which 50% of the ds molecules are converted to ss molecules; melting temperature is dependent on ionic strength and the concentration of DNA.
As a result, it is both the percentage of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines the strength of the association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting strands.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chalikian T, Völker J, Plum G, Breslauer K |title=A more unified picture for the thermodynamics of nucleic acid duplex melting: A characterization by calorimetric and volumetric techniques |pmc=22151 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=96 |issue=14 |pages=7853–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10393911 |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.14.7853|bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.7853C }}</ref> In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT [[Pribnow box]] in some [[promoter (biology)|promoter]]s, tend to have a high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.<ref>{{cite journal |author=deHaseth P, Helmann J |title=Open complex formation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase: the mechanism of polymerase-induced strand separation of double helical DNA |journal=Mol Microbiol |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=817–24 |year=1995 |pmid=7476180 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.1995.tb02309.x}}</ref>

In the laboratory, the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds, their [[DNA melting|melting temperature]] (also called ''T<sub>m</sub>'' value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These {{Anchor|ssDNA}}single-stranded DNA molecules (''ssDNA'') have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Isaksson J, Acharya S, Barman J, Cheruku P, Chattopadhyaya J |title=Single-stranded adenine-rich DNA and RNA retain structural characteristics of their respective double-stranded conformations and show directional differences in stacking pattern |journal=Biochemistry |volume=43 |issue=51 |pages=15996–6010 |year=2004 |pmid=15609994 | doi = 10.1021/bi048221v}}</ref>

===Sense and antisense===
{{Further2|[[Sense (molecular biology)]]}}

A DNA sequence is called "sense" if its sequence is the same as that of a [[messenger RNA]] copy that is translated into protein.<ref>[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/newsletter/misc/DNA.html Designation of the two strands of DNA] JCBN/NC-IUB Newsletter 1989. Retrieved 7 May 2008</ref> The sequence on the opposite strand is called the "antisense" sequence. Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e. both strands can contain both sense and antisense sequences). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hüttenhofer A, Schattner P, Polacek N |title=Non-coding RNAs: hope or hype? |journal=Trends Genet |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=289–97 |year=2005 |pmid=15851066 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2005.03.007}}</ref> One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating [[gene expression]] through RNA-RNA base pairing.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Munroe S |title=Diversity of antisense regulation in eukaryotes: multiple mechanisms, emerging patterns |journal=J Cell Biochem |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=664–71 |year=2004 |pmid=15389973 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20252}}</ref>

A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in [[plasmid]]s and [[virus]]es, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having [[overlapping gene]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Makalowska I, Lin C, Makalowski W |title=Overlapping genes in vertebrate genomes |journal=Comput Biol Chem |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |year=2005 |pmid=15680581 |doi=10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2004.12.006}}</ref> In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand.

===Supercoiling===
{{Further2|[[DNA supercoil]]}}
DNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called [[DNA supercoil]]ing.

===Quadruplex structures===
{{Further2|[[G-quadruplex]]}}

At the ends of the linear chromosomes are specialized regions of DNA called [[telomere]]s.

These guanine-rich sequences may stabilize chromosome ends by forming structures of stacked sets of four-base units, rather than the usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules.

In addition to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Griffith J, Comeau L, Rosenfield S, Stansel R, Bianchi A, Moss H, de Lange T |title=Mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop | journal=Cell |volume=97 |issue=4 | pages=503–14 |year=1999 |pmid=10338214 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80760-6}}</ref> At the very end of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands.

===Branched DNA===
{{Further2|[[Branched DNA]] and [[DNA nanotechnology]]}}

In DNA [[DNA end#Frayed ends|fraying]] occurs when non-complementary regions exist at the end of an otherwise complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Seeman NC |title=DNA enables nanoscale control of the structure of matter |journal=Q.

===Base modifications and DNA packaging===
{{Further2|[[DNA methylation]], [[Chromatin remodeling]]}}
The expression of genes is influenced by how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called [[chromatin]]. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of [[methylation]] of [[cytosine]] bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the [[histone]] protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see [[Chromatin remodeling]]).  There is, further, [[Crosstalk (biology)|crosstalk]] between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.<ref>Hu Q, Rosenfeld MG.

Many mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base pairs, this is called ''[[intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]]''. Most intercalators are [[aromaticity|aromatic]] and planar molecules; examples include [[ethidium bromide]], [[acridine]]s, [[Daunorubicin|daunomycin]], and [[doxorubicin]]. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix.

==Biological functions==
DNA usually occurs as linear [[chromosome]]s in [[eukaryote]]s, and circular chromosomes in [[prokaryote]]s. The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its [[genome]]; the [[human genome]] has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Venter J |title=The sequence of the human genome | journal=Science |volume=291 |issue=5507 | pages=1304–51 |year=2001 |pmid=11181995 |doi=10.1126/science.1058040 |last2=Adams |first2=MD |last3=Myers |first3=EW |last4=Li |first4=PW |last5=Mural |first5=RJ |last6=Sutton |first6=GG |last7=Smith |first7=HO |last8=Yandell |first8=M |last9=Evans|first9=CA |bibcode = 2001Sci...291.1304V|display-authors=9 }}</ref> The information carried by DNA is held in the [[DNA sequence|sequence]] of pieces of DNA called [[gene]]s. [[Transmission (genetics)|Transmission]] of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then used to make a matching [[Peptide sequence|protein sequence]] in a process called [[Translation (biology)|translation]], which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here we focus on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.

===Genes and genomes===
{{Further2|[[Cell nucleus]], [[Chromatin]], [[Chromosome]], [[Gene]], [[Noncoding DNA]]}}
Genomic DNA is tightly and orderly packed in the process called [[DNA condensation]] to fit the small available volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA is located in the [[cell nucleus]], as well as small amounts in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the [[nucleoid]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thanbichler M, Wang S, Shapiro L |title=The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal=J Cell Biochem |volume=96 |issue=3 | pages=506–21 |year=2005 |pmid=15988757 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20519}}</ref> The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its [[genotype]]. A gene is a unit of [[heredity]] and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an [[open reading frame]] that can be transcribed, as well as [[regulatory sequence]]s such as [[promoter (biology)|promoter]]s and [[enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], which control the transcription of the open reading frame.

In many [[species]], only a small fraction of the total sequence of the [[genome]] encodes protein. For example, only about 1.5% of the human genome consists of protein-coding [[exon]]s, with over 50% of human DNA consisting of non-coding [[repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive sequences]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wolfsberg T, McEntyre J, Schuler G |title=Guide to the draft human genome | journal=Nature |volume=409 |issue=6822 | pages=824–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11236998 | doi = 10.1038/35057000}}</ref> The reasons for the presence of so much [[noncoding DNA]] in eukaryotic genomes and the extraordinary differences in [[genome size]], or ''[[C-value]]'', among species represent a long-standing puzzle known as the "[[C-value enigma]]".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gregory T |title=The C-value enigma in plants and animals: a review of parallels and an appeal for partnership | journal=Annals of Botany |volume=95 |issue=1 | pages=133–46 |year=2005 |pmid=15596463 |doi=10.1093/aob/mci009}}</ref> However, some DNA sequences that do not code protein may still encode functional [[non-coding RNA]] molecules, which are involved in the [[regulation of gene expression]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=The ENCODE Project Consortium |title=Identification and analysis of functional elements in 1% of the human genome by the ENCODE pilot project |journal=Nature |volume=447 |issue=7146 | pages =799–816 |year=2007 |doi=10.1038/nature05874 |pmid=17571346 |pmc=2212820 |bibcode=2007Natur.447..799B}}</ref>

===Transcription and translation===
{{Further2|[[Genetic code]], [[Transcription (genetics)]], [[Protein biosynthesis]]}}
A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the [[phenotype]] of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a [[messenger RNA]] sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the [[amino acid|amino-acid]] sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of [[Translation (biology)|translation]], known collectively as the [[genetic code]]. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called ''codons'' formed from a sequence of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).

In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by [[RNA polymerase]]. This RNA copy is then decoded by a [[ribosome]] that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to [[transfer RNA]], which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (<math>4^3</math> combinations). These encode the twenty [[list of standard amino acids|standard amino acids]], giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAA, TGA and TAG codons.

[[File:DNA replication en.svg|thumb|450px|right|DNA replication. The double helix is unwound by a [[helicase]] and [[topoisomerase]]. Next, one [[DNA polymerase]] produces the [[Replication fork|leading strand]] copy. Another DNA polymerase binds to the [[Replication fork|lagging strand]]. This enzyme makes discontinuous segments (called [[Okazaki fragment]]s) before [[DNA ligase]] joins them together.]]

===Replication===
{{Further2|[[DNA replication]]}}

[[Cell division]] is essential for an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for [[DNA replication]]. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's [[complementary DNA]] sequence is recreated by an [[enzyme]] called [[DNA polymerase]]. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing, and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Albà M |title=Replicative DNA polymerases | journal=Genome Biol |volume=2 |issue=1 | pages=reviews3002.1–reviews3002.4|year=2001 |pmid=11178285 |pmc=150442|doi=10.1186/gb-2001-2-1-reviews3002 |nopp=true}}</ref> In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.

==Interactions with proteins==
All the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These [[protein interactions]] can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.

Structural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called [[chromatin]]. In eukaryotes this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called [[histone]]s, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sandman K, Pereira S, Reeve J |title=Diversity of prokaryotic chromosomal proteins and the origin of the nucleosome | journal=Cell Mol Life Sci |volume=54 |issue=12 | pages=1350–64 |year=1998 |pmid=9893710 |doi=10.1007/s000180050259}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dame RT |title=The role of nucleoid-associated proteins in the organization and compaction of bacterial chromatin |journal=Mol.

A distinct group of DNA-binding proteins are the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication [[protein A]] is the best-understood member of this family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination and DNA repair.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Iftode C, Daniely Y, Borowiec J |title=Replication protein A (RPA): the eukaryotic SSB | journal=Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol |volume=34 |issue=3 | pages=141–80 |year=1999 |pmid=10473346 |doi=10.1080/10409239991209255}}</ref> These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming [[stem-loop]]s or being degraded by [[nuclease]]s.

In contrast, other proteins have evolved to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various [[transcription factor]]s, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Myers L, Kornberg R |title=Mediator of transcriptional regulation | journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=69 | pages=729–49 |year=2000 |pmid=10966474 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.729}}</ref> Alternatively, transcription factors can bind [[enzyme]]s that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Spiegelman B, Heinrich R |title=Biological control through regulated transcriptional coactivators | journal=Cell |volume=119 |issue=2 | pages=157–67 |year=2004 |pmid=15479634 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2004.09.037}}</ref>

As these DNA targets can occur throughout an organism's genome, changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li Z, Van Calcar S, Qu C, Cavenee W, Zhang M, Ren B |title=A global transcriptional regulatory role for c-Myc in Burkitt's lymphoma cells | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=100 |issue=14 | pages=8164–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12808131 |pmc=166200 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1332764100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.8164L }}</ref> Consequently, these proteins are often the targets of the [[signal transduction]] processes that control responses to environmental changes or [[cellular differentiation]] and development. The specificity of these transcription factors' interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases, allowing them to "read" the DNA sequence. Most of these base-interactions are made in the major groove, where the bases are most accessible.<ref name="Pabo1984" />

===DNA-modifying enzymes===

====Nucleases and ligases====
[[Nuclease]]s are [[enzyme]]s that cut DNA strands by catalyzing the [[hydrolysis]] of the [[phosphodiester bond]]s. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands are called [[exonuclease]]s, while [[endonuclease]]s cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in [[molecular biology]] are the [[restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]], which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ and makes a cut at the vertical line. In nature, these enzymes protect [[bacteria]] against [[Bacteriophage|phage]] infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting as part of the [[restriction modification system]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bickle T, Krüger D |title=Biology of DNA restriction |pmc=372918 | journal=Microbiol Rev |volume=57 |issue=2 | pages=434–50 |year=1993 |pmid=8336674}}</ref> In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in [[molecular cloning]] and [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA fingerprinting]].

Enzymes called [[DNA ligase]]s can rejoin cut or broken DNA strands.<ref name=Doherty>{{cite journal |author=Doherty A, Suh S |title=Structural and mechanistic conservation in DNA ligases | journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=28 |issue=21 | pages=4051–8 |year=2000 |pmid=11058099 |pmc=113121 |doi=10.1093/nar/28.21.4051}}</ref> Ligases are particularly important in [[Replication fork|lagging strand]] DNA replication, as they join together the short segments of DNA produced at the [[replication fork]] into a complete copy of the DNA template. They are also used in [[DNA repair]] and [[genetic recombination]].<ref name=Doherty/>

====Topoisomerases and helicases====
[[Topoisomerase]]s are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase activity. These proteins change the amount of [[DNA supercoil|supercoiling]] in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break.<ref name=Champoux/> Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schoeffler A, Berger J |title=Recent advances in understanding structure-function relationships in the type II topoisomerase mechanism | journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=33 |issue=Pt 6 | pages=1465–70 |year=2005 |pmid=16246147 |doi=10.1042/BST20051465}}</ref> Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.<ref name=Wang/>

[[Helicase]]s are proteins that are a type of [[molecular motor]]. They use the chemical energy in [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s, predominantly [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tuteja N, Tuteja R |title=Unraveling DNA helicases. Motif, structure, mechanism and function | doi= 10.1111/j.1432-1033.2004.04094.x | journal=Eur J Biochem |volume=271 |issue=10 | pages=1849–63 |year=2004 |pmid=15128295}}</ref> These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.

====Polymerases====
[[Polymerase]]s are [[enzyme]]s that synthesize polynucleotide chains from [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s. The sequence of their products are created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called ''templates''. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ [[hydroxyl|hydroxyl group]] at the end of the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction.<ref name=Joyce>{{cite journal |author=Joyce C, Steitz T |title=Polymerase structures and function: variations on a theme? |pmc=177480 | journal=J Bacteriol |volume=177 |issue=22 | pages=6321–9 |year=1995 |pmid=7592405}}</ref> In the [[active site]] of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.

In DNA replication, DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]s make copies of DNA polynucleotide chains.  In order to preserve biological information, it is essential that the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand.  Many DNA polymerases have a [[Proofreading (Biology)|proofreading]] activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ [[exonuclease]] activity is activated and the incorrect base removed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hubscher U, Maga G, Spadari S |title=Eukaryotic DNA polymerases | journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=71 | pages=133–63 |year=2002 |pmid=12045093 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.71.090501.150041}}</ref> In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the [[replisome]] that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the [[DNA clamp]] or [[helicase]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johnson A, O'Donnell M |title=Cellular DNA replicases: components and dynamics at the replication fork | journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=74 | pages=283–315 |year=2005 |pmid=15952889 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073859}}</ref>

RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a specialized class of polymerases that copy the sequence of an RNA strand into DNA. They include [[reverse transcriptase]], which is a [[virus|viral]] enzyme involved in the infection of cells by [[retrovirus]]es, and [[telomerase]], which is required for the replication of telomeres.<ref name=Greider/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Tarrago-Litvak L, Andréola M, Nevinsky G, Sarih-Cottin L, Litvak S |title=The reverse transcriptase of HIV-1: from enzymology to therapeutic intervention | journal=FASEB J |volume=8 |issue=8 | pages=497–503 |date=1 May 1994|pmid=7514143 }}</ref> Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure.<ref name=Nugent/>

Transcription is carried out by a DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a [[messenger RNA]] transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the [[terminator (genetics)|terminator]], where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, [[RNA polymerase II]], the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates as part of a large [[protein complex]] with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martinez E |title=Multi-protein complexes in eukaryotic gene transcription | journal=Plant Mol Biol |volume=50 |issue=6 | pages=925–47 |year=2002 |pmid=12516863 |doi=10.1023/A:1021258713850}}</ref>

[[File:Chromosomal Recombination.svg|thumb|250px|left|Recombination involves the breakage and rejoining of two chromosomes (M and F) to produce two re-arranged chromosomes (C1 and C2).]]

A DNA helix usually does not interact with other segments of DNA, and in human cells the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas in the nucleus called "chromosome territories".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cremer T, Cremer C |title=Chromosome territories, nuclear architecture and gene regulation in mammalian cells | journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=2 |issue=4 | pages=292–301 |year=2001 |pmid=11283701 | doi = 10.1038/35066075}}</ref> This physical separation of different chromosomes is important for the ability of DNA to function as a stable repository for information, as one of the few times chromosomes interact is during [[chromosomal crossover]] when they [[genetic recombination|recombine]].

Recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, which increases the efficiency of [[natural selection]] and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pál C, Papp B, Lercher M |title=An integrated view of protein evolution | journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=7 |issue=5 | pages=337–48 |year=2006 |pmid=16619049 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1838}}</ref> Genetic recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell's response to double-strand breaks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Driscoll M, Jeggo P |title=The role of double-strand break repair&nbsp;– insights from human genetics | journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=7 |issue=1 | pages=45–54 |year=2006 |pmid=16369571 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1746}}</ref>

The most common form of chromosomal crossover is [[homologous recombination]], where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce [[chromosomal translocation]]s and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as [[recombinase]]s, such as [[RAD51]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vispé S, Defais M |title=Mammalian Rad51 protein: a RecA homologue with pleiotropic functions |journal=Biochimie |volume=79 |issue=9–10 |pages=587–92 |year=1997 |pmid=9466696 |doi=10.1016/S0300-9084(97)82007-X}}</ref> The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an [[endonuclease]] or damage to the DNA.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Neale MJ, Keeney S |title=Clarifying the mechanics of DNA strand exchange in meiotic recombination |journal=Nature |volume=442 |issue=7099 |pages=153–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16838012 | doi = 10.1038/nature04885|bibcode = 2006Natur.442..153N }}</ref> A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one [[Holliday junction]], in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix.

The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dickman M, Ingleston S, Sedelnikova S, Rafferty J, Lloyd R, Grasby J, Hornby D |title=The RuvABC resolvasome | journal=Eur J Biochem |volume=269 |issue=22 | pages=5492–501 |year=2002 |pmid=12423347 |doi=10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03250.x}}</ref>

{{Further2|[[Molecular biology]], [[nucleic acid methods]] and [[genetic engineering]]}}
Methods have been developed to purify DNA from organisms, such as [[phenol-chloroform extraction]], and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as [[restriction digest]]s and the [[polymerase chain reaction]]. Modern [[biology]] and [[biochemistry]] make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology.

===Forensics===
{{Further2|[[DNA profiling]]}}

[[Forensic science|Forensic scientists]] can use DNA in [[blood]], [[semen]], [[skin]], [[saliva]] or [[hair]] found at a [[crime scene]] to identify a matching DNA of an individual, such as a perpetrator. This process is formally termed [[DNA profiling]], but may also be called "[[genetic fingerprinting]]". In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as [[short tandem repeat]]s and [[minisatellite]]s, are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Collins A, Morton N |title=Likelihood ratios for DNA identification | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=91 |issue=13 | pages=6007–11 |year=1994 |pmid=8016106 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.13.6007|pmc=44126|bibcode = 1994PNAS...91.6007C }}</ref> However, identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weir B, Triggs C, Starling L, Stowell L, Walsh K, Buckleton J |title=Interpreting DNA mixtures | journal=J Forensic Sci |volume=42 |issue=2 | pages=213–22 |year=1997 |pmid=9068179}}</ref> DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jeffreys A, Wilson V, Thein S |title=Individual-specific 'fingerprints' of human DNA | journal=Nature |volume=316 |issue=6023 | pages=76–9 |year=1985|pmid=2989708 |doi=10.1038/316076a0|bibcode = 1985Natur.316...76J }}</ref> and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 [[Colin Pitchfork|Enderby murders]] case.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20061214004903/http://www.forensic.gov.uk/forensic_t/inside/news/list_casefiles.php?case=1 Colin Pitchfork&nbsp;— first murder conviction on DNA evidence also clears the prime suspect] Forensic Science Service Accessed 23 December 2006</ref>

The development of forensic science, and the ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva or hair has led to a re-examination of a number of cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was not scientifically possible at the time of the original examination.  Combined with the removal of the [[double jeopardy]] law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where previous trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury.   People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defence to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has taken place. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime.
DNA profiling is also used to identify victims of mass casualty incidents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://massfatality.dna.gov/Introduction/ |title=DNA Identification in Mass Fatality Incidents |month=September | year=2006 |publisher=National Institute of Justice}}</ref> As well as positively identifying bodies or body parts in serious accidents, DNA profiling is being successfully used to identify individual victims in mass war graves&nbsp;– matching to family members.

Experimental evidence supporting the Watson and Crick model was published in a series of five articles in the same issue of ''Nature''.<ref name=NatureDNA50>Nature Archives [http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/archive.html Double Helix of DNA: 50 Years]</ref> Of these, Franklin and Gosling's paper was the first publication of their own X-ray diffraction data and original analysis method that partially supported the Watson and Crick model;<ref name=NatFranGos/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/pictures/franklin-typeBphoto.html |title=Original X-ray diffraction image |publisher=Osulibrary.oregonstate.edu |accessdate=6 February 2011}}</ref> this issue also contained an article on DNA structure by [[Maurice Wilkins]] and two of his colleagues, whose analysis and ''in vivo'' B-DNA X-ray patterns also supported the presence ''in vivo'' of the double-helical DNA configurations as proposed by Crick and Watson for their double-helix molecular model of DNA in the previous two pages of ''Nature''.<ref name="NatWilk" /> In 1962, after Franklin's death, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins jointly received the Nobel Prize in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]].<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1962] Nobelprize .org Accessed 22 December 06</ref> Nobel Prizes were awarded only to living recipients at the time. A debate continues about who should receive credit for the discovery.<ref>{{cite journal | title=The double helix and the 'wronged heroine' | author= Brenda Maddox| journal= Nature | volume= 421 | pages= 407–408 | date=23 January 2003 | url=http://www.biomath.nyu.edu/index/course/hw_articles/nature4.pdf | pmid=12540909 | doi = 10.1038/nature01399 |format=PDF | issue=6921|bibcode = 2003Natur.421..407M }}</ref>

In an influential presentation in 1957, Crick laid out the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], which foretold the relationship between DNA, RNA, and proteins, and articulated the "adaptor hypothesis".<ref>Crick, F.H.C. [http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/assets/wtx030893.pdf On degenerate templates and the adaptor hypothesis (PDF).] genome.wellcome.ac.uk (Lecture, 1955). Retrieved 22 December 2006.</ref> Final confirmation of the replication mechanism that was implied by the double-helical structure followed in 1958 through the Meselson–Stahl experiment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meselson M, Stahl F| journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=44 |issue=7 | pages=671–82 |year=1958 |pmid=16590258 |doi=10.1073/pnas.44.7.671 |pmc=528642|bibcode = 1958PNAS...44..671M |title=The replication of DNA in Escherichia coli }}</ref> Further work by Crick and coworkers showed that the genetic code was based on non-overlapping triplets of bases, called codons, allowing [[Har Gobind Khorana]], [[Robert W. Holley]] and [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg]] to decipher the genetic code.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1968/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1968] Nobelprize.org Accessed 22 December 06</ref> These findings represent the birth of molecular biology.
