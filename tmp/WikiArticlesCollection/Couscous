It is traditionally served with a meat or vegetable stew spooned over it. Couscous is a [[staple food]] throughout the North African cuisines of [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Mauritania]] and [[Libya]].

Couscous served with fish is also a staple food in Western [[Sicily]], and is featured as a [[Prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale|traditional food product]] officially recognized by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies]].

Couscous was voted as the third favourite dish of [[France|French]] people in 2011 in a study by TNS Sofres for magazine Vie Pratique Gourmand  and the first in east of France.<ref>[http://www.tns-sofres.com/points-de-vue/79A4BE8A098F4BBFA11B939A135302CA.aspx Les plats préférés des Français], enquête réalisée en août 2011 pour le magazine Vie Pratique Gourmand auprès d'un échantillon national de {{formatnum:999}} personnes représentatif de l'ensemble de la population âgée de 18 ans et plus, interrogées en face à face.

==Etymology==
The original name  is derived from  Berber language ([[Berbers|Berber]]:seksu [meaning ''well rolled'', ''well formed'', ''rounded'']).
Numerous different names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. Couscous is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʊ|s|k|ʊ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|uː|s|k|uː|s}} in the [[United Kingdom]] and only the latter in the [[United States]]. In [[Berber language|Berber]] it is known as ''Seksu'' or ''Kesksu'' and in {{lang-ar|كسكس}} pronounced ''Kuskus''. It is also known as: taam (طعام)  in [[Algeria]], "Seksu" or "Kesksu" in  [[Morocco]]; ''Kuseksi''-in [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]] and ''Kuskusi'' (كسكسي) in [[Egypt]]. ''Keskes'' in [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]].<ref>FOUCAULD Charles de : ''Dictionnaire touareg-français'', Paris, Imprimerie Nationale, 1950–52, p. 919</ref>

==History==
One of the first written references is from an [[anonymous work|anonymous]] 13th-century North African [[cookbook]], ''Kitāb al-tabǐkh fǐ al-Maghrib (North Africa) wa'l-Andalus'' ([[Arabic]]) "The cookbook of the Maghreb and [[Al-Andalus]]", with a [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Medieval/Cookbooks/Andalusian/andalusian8.htm recipe] for couscous that was 'known all over the world'. To this day, couscous is known as 'the North Africa national dish'.<ref>'Traditional North Africa Cooking, by Madame Guinaudeau. p.81. ISBN 1-897959-43-5</ref>  Couscous was known to the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] royalty in [[Granada#Nasrid Emirate of Granada|Granada]] as well. And in the 13th century a [[Syria (region)|Syria]]n historian from [[Aleppo]] includes four references for couscous. These early mentions show that couscous spread rapidly, but generally that couscous was common from [[Tripolitania]] to the west, while from [[Cyrenaica]] to the east the main cuisine was Egyptian, with couscous as an occasional dish. Today, in Egypt and the Middle East, couscous is known, but in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Libya couscous is a staple. It is the national dish of Algeria.<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8804/ |title = Luce Ben Aben, Moorish Women Preparing Couscous, Algiers, Algeria |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1899 |accessdate = 2013-09-26 }}</ref> Couscous was taken from Syria to [[Turkey]] in the 16th century and is eaten in most of the southern [[province]]s.

Couscous is a traditional meal of the cuisine from [[Trapani]]. In Rome [[Bartolomeo Scappi]]'s culinary guide of 1570 describes a Moorish dish, ''succussu''; in [[Tuscany]].<ref>John Dickie, ''Delizia! The Epic History of the Italians and Their Food'' (New York, 2008) pp. 15, 115, 264f.</ref>

One of the earliest references to couscous in France is in [[Brittany]], in a letter dated January 12, 1699. But it made an earlier appearance in [[Provence]], where the traveler [[Jean-Jacques Bouchard]] wrote of eating it in [[Toulon]] in 1630.
Couscous was originally made from [[millet]].<ref>See numerous books describing couscous as boiled millet: http://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=millet+couscous&tbs=,cdr:1,cd_min:Jan%203_2%201,cd_max:Dec%2031_2%201922&num=10#q=millet+couscous&hl=en&tbs=bks:1,cdr:1,cd_min:Jan+3_2+1,cd_max:Dec+31_2+1922&ei=vGxCTdLYEcPbgQeFnc2JAg&start=0&sa=N&fp=64aa18c4243f0c16</ref> Historians have different opinions as to when [[wheat]] began to replace the use of millet. The conversion seems to have occurred sometime in the 20th century, although many regions continue to use the traditional millet. Couscous seems to have a North African origin. Archaeological evidence dating back to the 10th century, consisting of kitchen utensils needed to prepare this dish, has been found in this part of the world.

In some regions couscous is made from coarsely ground [[barley]] or [[pearl millet]]. In [[Brazil]], the traditional couscous is made from [[cornmeal]].<ref>[http://revistagloborural.globo.com/GloboRural/0,6993,EEC533123-1488-4,00.html Receitas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Preparation==
[[File:Couscous-1.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Couscous with vegetables]]
The semolina is sprinkled with water and rolled with the hands to form small pellets, sprinkled with dry flour to keep them separate, and then sieved. Any pellets which are too small to be finished granules of couscous and fall through the sieve are again rolled and sprinkled with dry semolina and rolled into pellets. This process continues until all the semolina has been formed into tiny granules of couscous. This process is very labour-intensive. In the traditional method of preparing couscous, groups of women came together to make large batches over several days.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} These were then dried in the sun and used for several months. Couscous was traditionally made from the hard part of the durum, the part of the grain that resisted the grinding of the relatively primitive millstone. In modern times, couscous production is largely mechanized, and the product is sold in markets around the world.

In the [[Sahel]]ian countries of West Africa, such as [[Mali]] and [[Senegal]], [[pearl millet]] is pounded or milled to the size and consistency necessary for the couscous.<ref>Sivak MN. Starch: Basic Science to Biotechnology. Academic Press, 1998, ISBN 0-12-016441-8, p. 132</ref>

[[File:Couscoussier.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A ''[[couscoussier]]'', a traditional steamer for couscous.]]

Properly cooked couscous is light and fluffy, not gummy or gritty. Traditionally, North Africans use a [[food steamer]] (called a كِسْكَاس ''kiskas'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or a ''[[Couscoussier|couscoussière]]'' in [[French language|French]]). The base is a tall metal pot shaped rather like an oil jar in which the meat and vegetables are cooked as a stew. On top of the base, a steamer sits where the couscous is cooked, absorbing the flavours from the stew. The lid to the steamer has holes around its edge so steam can escape. It is also possible to use a pot with a steamer insert. If the holes are too big the steamer can be lined with damp [[cheesecloth]]. There is little [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence of early diets including couscous, possibly because the original ''couscoussière'' was probably made from organic materials which could not survive extended exposure to the elements.

==Instant couscous==
The couscous that is sold in most [[Western culture|Western]] supermarkets has been pre-steamed and dried, the package directions usually instruct to add 1.5 measures of ''boiling'' water or stock and butter to each measure of couscous and to cover tightly for 5 minutes. The couscous swells and within a few minutes it is ready to fluff with a fork and serve. Pre-steamed couscous takes less time to prepare than regular couscous, most dried [[pasta]], or dried grains (such as [[rice]]).

==Local variations==
[[Image:MoroccanCouscous.jpg|thumb|Couscous with [[raisin]] and [[onion]] topping]]
In Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya couscous is generally served with vegetables ([[carrot]]s, [[potato]]es, [[turnip]]s, ''[[wikt:etc.|etc.]]'') cooked in a spicy or mild [[broth]] or stew, and some meat (generally, [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[lamb and mutton|mutton]]).

In Algeria and Morocco it is also served, sometimes at the end of a meal or just by itself, as a delicacy called ''"seffa"''. The couscous is usually steamed several times until it is very fluffy and pale in color. It is then sprinkled with [[almond]]s, [[cinnamon]] and [[sugar]]. Traditionally, this dessert is served with milk perfumed with [[orange flower water]], or it can be served plain with [[buttermilk]] in a bowl as a cold light soup for supper.

In Libya, it is mostly served with meat, specifically [[beef]], lamb, or [[Camel#Food_uses|camel]], in Tripoli and the western parts of Libya, but not during official ceremonies or weddings. Another way to eat couscous is as a dessert; it is prepared with dates, sesame, and pure honey, and locally referred to as "maghrood".

In Tunisia, it is made mostly spicy with [[harissa]] sauce and served with almost everything, including lamb, beef, camel, and poultry. Fish couscous is a Tunisian specialty and can also be made with octopus in hot, red, spicy sauce. Couscous in Tunisia is served on every occasion; it is also served, mostly during [[Ramadan]], sweetened as a dessert called masfouf.

In [[Egypt]], couscous is eaten more as a dessert. It is prepared with butter, sugar, cinnamon, raisins, and nuts and topped with cream.

Couscous is also very popular in France, where it is now considered a traditional dish, and has also become popular in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Indeed, many polls have indicated that it is often a favorite dish.<ref name="2emeprefere">[http://www.tns-sofres.com/etudes/pol/230306_platspreferes_r.htm "Notre Temps"] Study conducted on January 11 and 12, 2006, for the magazine Notre Temps based on face-to-face interviews with a sample of {{formatnum:1000}} people representative of the adult French population, stratified by age, sex, profession of the head of household, region and type of municipality.</ref> Although introduced in France by the ''[[Pied-noir|pieds noirs]]'' (people of European descent who used to live in Algeria), many couscous restaurants are now owned by people originating from Algeria. In France, Spain, Italy, and Portugal, the word "couscous" (''cuscús'' in Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian) usually refers to couscous together with the stew. Packaged sets containing a box of quick-preparation couscous and a can of vegetables and, generally, meat are sold in French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese [[grocery store]]s and [[supermarket]]s. In France, it is generally served with [[harissa]] sauce.

In [[North America]], [[Australia]], and the [[United Kingdom]], couscous is available most commonly either plain or pre-flavoured in quick-preparation boxes. In the United States, it is widely available, normally found in the [[ethnic group|ethnic]] or [[health food|health-food]] section of larger grocery stores.

There are [[recipe]]s from [[Brazil]] and other [[Latin America]]n countries that use boiled couscous molded into a [[Timbale (food)|timbale]] with other ingredients. In [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]] and among the diaspora of its population in other Brazilian regions, ''cuscuz'' ({{IPA-pt|kusˈkus}} locally, {{IPA|kuʃˈkujʃ}} in Rio de Janeiro, {{IPA|kujsˈkujs}} in São Paulo), a steamed cake of couscous and corn flour (a mixture called fubá, pronounced {{IPA-pt|fuˈba}}, said to be of African origin from the slave trade), is a popular meal, served in many forms: With sugar and milk, with varied meats, with cheese and eggs, and so on. In [[Mexico]], there are two dishes called the ''couscous [[taco]]'' (''taco de cuscús'') and ''couscous [[burrito]]'' (''burrito de cuscús''), which consist of a traditional taco or burrito, respectively, with couscous added, to produce a product similar to a North African pita.
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Palestinian couscous.jpg|thumb|Palestinian Couscous (also known as maftoul) with chickpeas and chicken]] -->

[[Palestine|Palestinians]] typically serve it on occasions and holidays. It was brought by Moroccan migrants to Palestine, where it has been modified to what’s called maftoul.  Although maftoul is considered as a special type of couscous but  made from different ingredients and a different shape. Maftoul is an Arabic word derived from the root “fa-ta-la” which means to roll or to twist, which is exactly describing the used method to make maftoul by hand rolling bulgur  with wheat flour.<ref>[http://www.kitchenofpalestine.com/palestinian-couscous-maftoul] Palestinian Couscous: Kitchen of Palestine</ref>
