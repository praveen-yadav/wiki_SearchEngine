{{Ancient Greek religion}}

In [[Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism|Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]],  '''Athena''' or '''Athene''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|n|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|n|iː}}; [[Attic Greek|Attic]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀθηνᾶ}}, ''Athēnā'' or {{lang|grc|Ἀθηναία}}, ''Athēnaia''; [[Epic Greek|Epic]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀθηναίη}}, ''Athēnaiē''; [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀθήνη}}, ''Athēnē''; [[Doric Greek|Doric]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀθάνα}}, ''Athānā''), also referred to as '''Pallas Athena/Athene''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|l|ə|s}}; Παλλὰς Ἀθηνᾶ; Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη), is the goddess of wisdom, courage, inspiration, civilization, law and justice, just warfare, mathematics, strength, strategy, the arts, crafts, and skill. [[Minerva]] is the [[Roman god]]dess [[Interpretatio graeca|identified with]] Athena.<ref name="Deacy, Susan 2001">Deacy, Susan, and Alexandra Villing. ''Athena in the Classical World''. Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill, 2001. Print.</ref>

Athena is also a shrewd companion of [[hero]]es and is the [[goddess]] of heroic endeavour. She is the [[Virginity|virgin]] patroness of [[Athens]]. The Athenians founded the [[Parthenon]] on the [[Acropolis]] of her namesake city, [[Athens]] (Athena Parthenos), in her honour.<ref name="Deacy, Susan 2001"/>

Athena's veneration as the patron of Athens seems to have existed from the earliest times, and was so persistent that archaic myths about her were recast to adapt to cultural changes. In her role as a protector of the city (''[[polis]]''), many people throughout the Greek world worshiped Athena as ''Athena Polias'' (Ἀθηνᾶ Πολιάς "Athena of the city"). The city of [[Athens]] and the goddess Athena essentially bear the same name (''Athena'' the Goddess, ''Athenai'' the city) while it is not known which of the two words is derived from the other.<ref>"Whether the goddess was named after the city or the city after the goddess is an ancient dispute" (Burkert 1985:139)</ref>

==Origin traditions==
The Greek philosopher [[Plato]] (428–347 BC) identified her with the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] deity [[Neith]], which, they say was worshiped at the city of [[Sais]], located at the Delta of Egypt, as the founder of the city.<ref>Plato, Timaeus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DTim.%3Asection%3D21e#note-link2 21e]</ref> She was the war goddess and huntress deity of the Egyptians since the ancient Pre-Dynastic period, who was also identified with [[weaving]]. The ancient Greeks believed that Athena had visited many mythological places such as Libya's  Triton River in North Africa and the Phlegraean plain.<ref>Aeschylus ''Eumenides'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0006:card=276&highlight=triton#note-link295 292–293]. Cf. the tradition that she was the daughter of Neilos: see, e.g. Clement of Alexandria ''Protr.'' 2.28.2; Cicero, ''[[De Natura Deorum]]''. 3.59.</ref> Scholar [[Martin Bernal]] created the controversial<ref>Mary R.

==Patroness==
[[File:Tétradrachme athénien représentant Athéna.jpg|thumb|right|Athenian [[tetradrachm]] representing the goddess Athena.]]

Athena as the goddess of philosophy became an aspect of the cult in Classical Greece during the late 5th century BC.<ref>[[Walter Burkert]], ''Greek Religion'' 1985:VII "Philosophical Religion" treats these transformations.</ref> She is the patroness of various crafts, especially of [[weaving]], as ''Athena Ergane'', and was honored as such at festivals such as [[Chalceia]]. The metalwork of weapons also fell under her patronage. She led battles (''[[Athena Promachos]]'' or the warrior maiden ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'')<ref name="C.J. Herrington 1955">C.J. Herrington, ''Athena Parthenos and [[Athena Polias]]''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1955</ref> as the disciplined, strategic side of war, in contrast to her brother [[Ares]], the patron of violence, bloodlust and slaughter—"the raw force of war".<ref>Darmon."Athena and Ares". Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1978.</ref> Athena's wisdom includes the cunning intelligence (''metis'') of such figures as [[Odysseus]]. Not only was this version of Athena the opposite of Ares in combat, it was also the polar opposite of the serene earth goddess version of the deity, ''Athena Polias''.<ref name="C.J. Herrington 1955"/>

Athena appears in Greek mythology as the patron and helper of many heroes, including [[Odysseus]], [[Jason]], and [[Heracles]]. In [[Classical Greek]] myths, she never consorts with a lover, nor does she ever marry,<ref>S. Goldhill. ''Reading Greek Tragedy''(Aesch.Eum.737). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986.</ref> earning the title ''Athena Parthenos''. A remnant of archaic myth depicts her as the adoptive mother of [[Erechtheus]]/[[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]] through the foiled rape by [[Hephaestus]].<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 3.14.6.</ref> Other variants relate that Erichthonius, the serpent that accompanied Athena,  was born to [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]: when the rape failed, the semen landed on Gaia and impregnated her. After Erechthonius was born, Gaia gave him to Athena.

Though Athena is a goddess of war strategy, she disliked fighting without purpose and preferred to use wisdom to settle predicaments.<ref name="Loewen">{{cite book|last=Loewen|first=Nancy|title=Athena|isbn=0-7368-0048-4}}</ref> The goddess only encouraged fighting for a reasonable cause or to resolve conflict. As patron of Athens she fought in the Trojan war on the side of the Achaeans.<!--any citation for the following psychology? not just because she lost the beauty contest, but because she wanted to punish the Trojans for abducting Helen.-->

==Mythology==

===Birth===
[[File:NAMA Diosa Hera.JPG|thumb|upright|Image from the [[temple of Athena]] at [[Mycenae]], c. 625 BC ([[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]])]]

====Olympian version====
[[File:Amphora birth Athena Louvre F32.jpg|thumb|After he swallowed her pregnant mother, [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], Athena is "born" from Zeus' forehead as he grasps the clothing of [[Eileithyia]] on the right —[[black-figure pottery|black-figured]] [[amphora]], 550–525 BC, Louvre.]]

Although Athena appears before [[Zeus]] at [[Knossos]] —in [[Linear B]], as ''a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja'', "Mistress Athena"<ref>Knossos tablet V 52 ([[John Chadwick]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=RMj7M_tGaNMC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA88#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Mycenaean World''] [Cambridge] 1976:88 fig 37.) ''Athana Potnia'' does not appear at Mycenaean [[Pylos]], where the mistress goddess is ''ma-te-re te-i-ja'', ''Mater [[Theia]], literally "Mother Goddess".</ref>—in the Classical [[Olympian gods|Olympian pantheon]], Athena was remade as the favorite daughter of Zeus, born fully armed from his forehead.<ref>Jane Ellen Harrison's famous characterisation of this myth-element as, "a desperate theological expedient to rid an earth-born Kore of her matriarchal conditions" has never been refuted (Harrison 1922:302).</ref> The story of her birth comes in several versions. In the one most commonly cited, Zeus lay with Metis, the goddess of crafty thought and wisdom, but he immediately feared the consequences. It had been prophesied that Metis would bear children more powerful than the sire,<ref>Compare the prophecy concerning [[Thetis]].</ref> even Zeus himself. In order to forestall these dire consequences, after lying with Metis, Zeus "put her away inside his own belly;" he "swallowed her down all of a sudden."<ref>Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'' 890ff and 924ff.</ref>  He was too late: Metis had already conceived.

Eventually Zeus experienced an enormous headache; [[Prometheus]], [[Hephaestus]], [[Hermes]], [[Ares]], or Palaemon (depending on the sources examined) cleaved Zeus's head with the double-headed [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[axe]], the ''[[labrys]]''. Athena leaped from Zeus's head, fully grown and armed, with a shout— "and pealed to the broad sky her clarion cry of war. And Ouranos trembled to hear, and Mother Gaia..." ([[Pindar]], ''Seventh Olympian Ode''). Plato, in the ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', attributes the cult of Athena to the culture of [[Crete]], introduced, he thought, from Libya during the dawn of Greek culture.

Classical myths thereafter note that [[Hera]] was so annoyed at Zeus for having produced a child that she conceived and bore [[Hephaestus]] by [[parthenogenesis|herself]].

Plato, in ''[[Cratylus]]'' (407B)  gave the etymology of her name as signifying "the mind of god", ''theou noesis''. The Christian apologist of the 2nd century [[Justin Martyr]] takes issue with those pagans who erect at springs images of [[Persephone|Kore]], whom he interprets as Athena:
<blockquote>"They said that Athena was the daughter of Zeus not from intercourse, but when the god had in mind the making of a world through a word (''[[logos]]'') his first thought was Athena".<ref>Justin, ''Apology'' 64.5. quoted in Robert McQueen Grant, ''Gods and the One God'', vol 1 :155, who observes that it is [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] "who similarly identifies Athena with "forethought".</ref></blockquote>

====Other origin tales====
Some origin stories tell of Athena having been born outside of Olympus and raised by the god Triton.
Fragments attributed by the Christian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] to the semi-legendary [[Phoenicia]]n historian [[Sanchuniathon]], which Eusebius thought had been written before the [[Trojan war]], make Athena instead the daughter of [[Cronus]], a king of [[Byblos]] who visited 'the inhabitable world' and bequeathed [[Attica]] to Athena.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/af/af01.htm |title='&#39;Sacred Texts: Ancient Fragments'&#39;, ed. and trans. I. P. Cory, 1832: "The Theology of the Phœnicians from Sanchoniatho" |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100905172619/http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/af/af01.htm| archivedate= 5 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Sanchuniathon's account would make Athena the sister of Zeus and Hera, not Zeus' daughter.

===Pallas Athena===
The major competing tradition regarding Athena's parentage involves some of her more mysterious [[epithet]]s: Pallas, as in the ancient-Greek {{lang|grc|Παλλάς Άθήνη}} (also Pallantias) and Tritogeneia (also Trito, Tritonis, Tritoneia, Tritogenes). A distant archaic separate entity named [[Pallas (daughter of Triton)|Pallas]] is invoked as Athena's father, sister, foster sister, companion, or opponent in battle. Pallas is often a nymph, a daughter of [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] (a sea god), and a childhood friend of Athena.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NymphePallas.html |title=Pallas |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110628180319/http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NymphePallas.html| archivedate= 28 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> 

In every case, Athena kills Pallas, accidentally, and thereby gains the name for herself. In one telling, they practice the arts of war together until one day they have a falling out. As Pallas is about to strike Athena, Zeus intervenes. With Pallas stunned by a blow from Zeus, Athena takes advantage and kills her. Distraught over what she has done, Athena takes the name Pallas for herself.

When Pallas is Athena's father the events, including her birth, are located near a body of water named Triton or [[Lake Tritonis|Tritonis]]. When Pallas is Athena's sister or foster-sister, Athena's father or foster-father is [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]], the son and herald of [[Poseidon]]. But Athena may be called the daughter of Poseidon and a nymph named Tritonis, without involving Pallas. Likewise, Pallas may be Athena's father or opponent, without involving Triton.<ref>Graves, Robert, ''The Greek Myths I'', "The Birth of Athena", 8.a., p. 51. The story comes from [[Libya]]n (modern [[Berber people|Berbers]]) where the Greek Athena and the Egyptian [[Neith]] blend into one deity. The story is not often referenced because some of the details are contradicted by other, better-documented theories. Frazer, vol. 2 p.41</ref> On this topic, Walter Burkert says "she is the Pallas of Athens, ''Pallas Athenaie'', just as Hera of Argos is ''Here Argeie''.<ref>Burkert, p. 139.</ref> For the Athenians, Burkert notes, Athena was simply "the Goddess", ''hē theós'', certainly an ancient title.

===''Athena Parthenos'': Virgin Athena===
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:RiddleAthena.jpg|thumb|The modern ''Athena Parthenos'', a replica of the statue that stood in her temple on the [[Acropolis]], including the Nike in her hand and the serpent, Erichthonius, behind her shield which stands in the replicated [[Parthenon]] in [[Centennial Park (Nashville)|Centennial Park]], [[Nashville]] [[Tennessee]]]] -->

Athena never had a consort or lover and is thus known as ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'', "Virgin Athena". Her most famous temple, the [[Parthenon]], on the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]] in [[Athens]] takes its name from this title. It is not merely an observation of her virginity, but a recognition of her role as enforcer of rules of sexual modesty and ritual mystery. Even beyond recognition, the Athenians allotted the goddess value based on this pureness of virginity as it upheld a rudiment of female behavior in the patriarchal society. Kerenyi's study and theory of Athena accredits her virginal toponym to be a result of the relationship to her father Zeus and a vital, cohesive piece of her character throughout the ages.<ref>K.Kerenyi,''Die Jungfrau und Mutter der griechischen Religion. Eine Studie uber Pallas Athene''.Zurich:Rhein Verlag, 1952.</ref>

This role is expressed in a number of stories about Athena. [[Marinus of Neapolis]] reports that when Christians removed the statue of the Goddess from the [[Parthenon]], a beautiful woman appeared in a dream to [[Proclus]], a devotee of Athena, and announced that the ''"Athenian Lady"'' wished to dwell with him.<ref>Marinus of Samaria, ''"The Life of Proclus or Concerning Happiness"'', Translated by Kenneth S. Guthrie (1925), pp.15–55:30, retrieved 21 May 2007.[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/marinus_01_life_of_proclus.htm Marinus, ''Life of Proclus'']</ref>

====Erichthonius====
[[File:Gandharan Athena.jpg|thumb|Athena in the art of [[Gandhara]], [[India]]]]
[[Hephaestus]] attempted to [[rape]] Athena, but she eluded him. His [[semen]] fell to the earth and impregnated the soil, and [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]] was born from the Earth, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. Athena then raised the baby as a foster mother.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, [[Bibliotheke]]'' 3.14.6.</ref>

Athena puts the infant Erichthonius into a small box (''cista'') which she entrusts to the care of three sisters, [[Herse]], [[Pandrosus]], and [[Aglaulus, daughter of Cecrops|Aglaulus]] of Athens. The goddess does not tell them what the box contains, but warns them not to open it until she returns. One or two sisters opens the ''cista'' to reveal Erichthonius, in the form (or embrace) of a [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]. The serpent, or insanity induced by the sight, drives Herse and Aglaulus to throw themselves off the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]].<ref>Graves, Robert, ''The Greek Myths I'', "The Nature and Deeds of Athena" 25.d.</ref>  Jane Harrison (''Prolegomena'') finds this to be a simple cautionary tale directed at young girls carrying the ''cista'' in the [[Thesmophoria]] rituals, to discourage them from opening it outside the proper context.

<!-- Her role as the virgin mother of [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]] was a relic of an archaic myth of the patron goddess of ''Athenai'' that preceded her placement among the Olympian pantheon. -->
Another version of the myth of the Athenian maidens is told in ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' by the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (43 BC – 17 AD); in this late variant [[Hermes]] falls in love with Herse. Herse, Aglaulus, and Pandrosus go to the temple to offer sacrifices to Athena. Hermes demands help from Aglaulus to seduce Herse. Aglaulus demands money in exchange. Hermes gives her the money the sisters have already offered to Athena. As punishment for Aglaulus's greed, Athena asks the goddess [[Invidia|Envy]] to make Aglaulus jealous of Herse. When Hermes arrives to seduce Herse, Aglaulus stands in his way instead of helping him as she had agreed. He turns her to stone.<ref>[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'', X. Aglaura, Book II, 708–751; XI. The Envy, Book II, 752–832.</ref>

With this mythic origin, Erichthonius became the founder-[[king of Athens]], and many beneficial changes to Athenian culture were ascribed to him. During this time, Athena frequently protected him.

====Medusa and Tiresias====
In a late myth, [[Medusa]], unlike her sister [[Gorgon]]s, came to be viewed by the Greeks of the 5th century as a beautiful mortal that served as priestess in Athena's temple. Poseidon liked Medusa, and decided to rape her in the temple of Athena, refusing to allow her vow of chastity to stand in his way.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/bogan/medusamyth.htm |title= Medusa in Myth and Literary History |accessdate= 2010-01-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100123102204/http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/bogan/medusamyth.htm| archivedate= 23 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Upon discovering the desecration of her temple, Athena changed Medusa's form to match that of her sister Gorgons as punishment. Medusa's hair turned into snakes, her lower body was transformed also, and meeting her gaze would turn any living man to stone. In the earliest myths, there is only one [[Gorgon]], but there are two snakes that form a belt around her waist.

In one version of the [[Tiresias]] myth, Tiresias stumbled upon Athena bathing, and he was struck blind by her to ensure he would never again see what man was not intended to see. But having lost his eyesight, he was given a special gift—to be able to understand the language of the birds (and thus to foretell the future).

===Lady of Athens===
Athena competed with [[Poseidon]] to be the patron deity of Athens, which was yet unnamed, in a version of one [[founding myth]]. They agreed that each would give the Athenians one gift and that the Athenians would choose the gift they preferred. Poseidon struck the ground with his [[trident]] and a salt water spring sprang up; this gave them a means of trade and water—Athens at its height was a significant sea power, defeating the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] fleet at the [[Battle of Salamis]]—but the water was salty and not very good for drinking.<ref name="Graves 1960:16.3p 62">Graves 1960:16.3p 62.</ref>

Athena, however, offered them the first domesticated [[olive tree]]. The Athenians (or their king, [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]]) accepted the olive tree and with it the patronage of Athena, for the olive tree brought wood, oil, and food. [[Robert Graves]] was of the opinion that "Poseidon's attempts to take possession of certain cities are political myths" which reflect the conflict between matriarchal and patriarchal religions.<ref name="Graves 1960:16.3p 62"/>

====Other sites of cult====
Athena also was the patron goddess of several other Greek cities, notably Sparta, where the archaic cult of [[Athena Alea]] had its sanctuaries in the surrounding villages of [[Mantineia]] and, notably, [[Tegea]].  In Sparta itself, the temple of Athena ''Khalkíoikos'' (Athena "of the Brazen House", often [[latin]]ized as ''Chalcioecus'') was the grandest and located on the Spartan acropolis; presumably it had a roof of bronze. The forecourt of the Brazen House was the place where the most solemn religious functions in Sparta took place.

Tegea was an important religious center of ancient Greece,<ref>"This sanctuary had been respected from early days by all the [[Peloponnesian]]s, and afforded peculiar safety to its suppliants" (Pausanias, ''Description of Greece''  iii.5.6)</ref> containing the Temple of [[Athena Alea]]. The ''temenos'' was founded by [[Aleus]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was informed.<ref>Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' viii.4.8.</ref> Votive bronzes at the site from the Geometric and Archaic periods take the forms of horses and deer; there are [[sealstone]] and [[fibula]]e. In the Archaic period the nine villages that underlie Tegea banded together in a [[synoecism]] to form one city.<ref>Compare the origin of [[Sparta]].</ref> Tegea was listed in [[Homer]]'s [[Catalogue of Ships]] as one of the cities that contributed ships and men for the [[War of Troy|Achaean assault on Troy]].

<!--Another interesting and arguable reason for why the Athenians chose Athena's olive tree over Poseidon's horses and spring was because Poseidon was known to be a very difficult deity to please and often wrought havoc even upon his cities. Athena was a better choice because of her less violent personality and the Athenians did not wish to have to encounter Poseidon's wrath in future. Poseidon and Athena may also be viewed as foils for one another; Athena girding order and civility in approaching conflicts and Poseidon unleashing rage without moderation. Poseidon lords over the horses and lets them run rampant while Athena produces the bridle and chariot so that the horse may be tamed.<ref>M.Detienne,"Athena and the Mastery of the Horse",History of Religions(161-184).Hassocks:Harvester Press,1991.</ref> Civilization needed the tranquility and resourcefulness of Athena much more than an uninhibited temper.

===Counselor===
Later myths of the Classical Greeks relate that Athena guided [[Perseus (mythology)|Perseus]] in his quest to behead [[Medusa (mythology)|Medusa]]. She instructed [[Heracles]] to skin the [[Nemean Lion]] by using its own claws to cut through its thick hide. She also helped Heracles to defeat the [[Stymphalian Birds]], and to navigate the underworld so as to capture [[Cerberus]].

In ''[[The Odyssey]]'', [[Odysseus]]' cunning and shrewd nature quickly won Athena's favour. In the realistic epic mode, however, she largely is confined to aiding him only from ''afar'', as by implanting thoughts in his head during his journey home from Troy. Her guiding actions reinforce her role as the "protectress of heroes" or as mythologian [[Walter Friedrich Otto]] dubbed her the "goddess of nearness" due to her mentoring and motherly probing.<ref>W.F.Otto,''Die Gotter Griechenlands(55-77)''.Bonn:F.Cohen,1929</ref> It is not until he washes up on the shore of an island where [[Nausicaa]] is washing her clothes that Athena arrives personally to provide more tangible assistance. She appears in Nausicaa's dreams to ensure that the princess rescues Odysseus and plays a role in his eventual escort to Ithaca.

Athena appears in disguise to Odysseus upon his arrival, initially lying and telling him that Penelope, his wife, has remarried and that he is believed to be dead; but Odysseus lies back to her, employing skillful prevarications to protect himself.<ref>Trahman in ''Phoenix'', p. 35.</ref> Impressed by his resolve and shrewdness, she reveals herself and tells him what he needs to know in order to win back his kingdom. She disguises him as an elderly man or beggar so that he cannot be noticed by the suitors or Penelope, and helps him to defeat the suitors.

She also plays a role in ending the resultant feud against the suitors' relatives. She instructs Laertes to throw his spear and to kill the father of Antinous, Eupeithes.

===Judgment of Paris===
{{Main|Judgement of Paris}}
One interpretation of a myth and icons related to it, relate that all the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]] (the eventual parents of [[Achilles]]). Only [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], goddess of discord, was not invited. She was annoyed at this, so she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word καλλίστῃ (kallistēi, "for the fairest"), which she threw among the goddesses. Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.

[[File:Mengs, Urteil des Paris.jpg|thumb|bottom|Paris is awarding the apple to Aphrodite ''Urteil des Paris'' by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], ca. 1757]]

The goddesses chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris, a [[Troy|Trojan]] prince. After bathing in the spring of [[Mount Ida]] where Troy was situated, the goddesses appeared before Paris for his decision. The goddesses undressed before him to be evaluated, either at his request or by their own choice.

Still, Paris could not decide, as all three were ideally beautiful, so they resorted to bribes. Hera tried to bribe Paris with control over all [[Asia]] and [[Europe]], while Athena offered wisdom, fame and glory in battle, but Aphrodite came forth and whispered to Paris that if he were to choose her as the fairest he would have the most beautiful mortal woman in the world as a wife, and he accordingly chose her. This woman was [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], who was, unfortunately for Paris, already married to King [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta#Prehistory|Sparta]]. The other two goddesses were enraged by this and through Helen's abduction by Paris they brought about the [[Trojan War]].

[[File:Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem - The Judgment of Paris - WGA05252.jpg|thumb|The apple is being given to Paris in alternative interpretations - [[Cornelis van Haarlem]], 1628]]
Another interpretation is that the apple was being given to the man by the three goddesses, instead of to one of the goddesses. This is the interpretation mythologists and writers delving into more ancient Greek myths that date from before the classical period. The later interpretation is considered a variant interpretation of icons of great antiquity, to conform to the changes in the evolution of the Greek pantheon in myths. 

It is suspected that the icons relate to a religious ritual in which a "king" was selected who would serve for a year (or a specified period) before being sacrificed and that the cycle would be renewed upon his death. [[Robert Graves]] was a strong proponent of this theory and it is written about in many of his publications, such as ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' and ''[[The White Goddess]]''. This also was suggested in the early versions of an extensive analysis of Greek mythology, ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' by [[James George Frazer]]. In a later editions Frazer completely revised the book and left out his research and discussion of these rituals in the abbreviated edition that is known by that title today.

These interpretations relate to a concept of a ''Great Goddess'', a ''[[Mother Goddess]]'', and the religious worship of such a deity in very ancient Greek culture. It took a triad form, one phase being Athena along with Hera and Aphrodite and others in her matrilineal line (grandmother, mother, etc.) such as ([[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], [[Hera]], [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]]), and myths that arose through interpretations (or misinterpretations) of icons from earlier cultural periods. The apple would have been given to the "king" the three goddesses selected.

===Roman fable of Arachne===
The [[fable]] of [[Arachne]] is a late Roman addition to Classical [[Greek mythology]]<ref>The Arachne narrative is in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (vi.5-54 and 129-145) and mentioned in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Georgics]]'', iv, 246.</ref> but does not appear in the myth repertoire of the Attic vase-painters. Arachne's name simply means ''spider'' (αράχνη). Arachne was the daughter of a famous dyer in [[Tyrian purple]] in Hypaipa of [[Lydia]], and a weaving student of Athena. She became so conceited of her skill as a weaver that she began claiming that her skill was greater than that of Athena herself.

Athena gave Arachne a chance to redeem herself by assuming the form of an old woman and warning Arachne not to offend the deities. Arachne scoffed and wished for a weaving contest, so she could prove her skill.

Athena wove the scene of her victory over [[Poseidon]] that had inspired her patronage of Athens. According to Ovid's Latin narrative, Arachne's tapestry featured twenty-one episodes of the infidelity of the deities, including [[Zeus]] being unfaithful with [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], with [[Europa (mythical)|Europa]], and with [[Danaë]]. Athena admitted that Arachne's work was flawless, but was outraged at Arachne's offensive choice of subjects that displayed the failings and transgressions of the deities. Finally, losing her temper, Athena destroyed Arachne's tapestry and loom, striking it with her shuttle.

Athena then struck Arachne with her staff, which changed her into a spider. In some versions, the destruction of her loom leads Arachne to hang herself in despair; Athena takes pity on her, and transforms her into a spider. In the aforementioned version, Arachne weaved scenes of joy while Athena weaved scenes of horror.

The fable suggests that the origin of weaving lay in imitation of spiders and that it was considered to have been perfected first in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].<!--no citation required: this is merely the superficial reading-->

==Cult and attributes==
[[File:Athena ciste.jpg|thumb|alt=Athena with the cista|Helmeted Athena with the ''cista'' and Erichthonius in his serpent form. Roman, first century ([[Louvre Museum]]).]]
[[File:Littleowl.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Little Owl]], sacred bird of the Goddess ([[Owl of Athena]]).]]

Athena's [[epithet]]s include {{lang|grc|Άτρυτώνη}}, '''Atrytone''' (= the unwearying), {{lang|grc|Παρθένος}}, '''Parthénos''' (= virgin), and {{lang|grc|Πρόμαχος}}, '''Promachos''' (the First Fighter, i.e. ''she who fights in front'').

In poetry from Homer, an oral tradition of the eighth or seventh century BC, onward, Athena's most common [[epithets in Homer|epithet]] is '''Glaukopis''' (γλαυκώπις), which usually is translated as, ''bright-eyed'' or ''with gleaming eyes''.<ref>Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, 1940, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', ISBN 0-19-864226-1, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3D%236935 online version] at the [[Perseus Project]].</ref> The word is a combination of ''glaukos'' (γλαύκος, meaning ''gleaming'', ''silvery'', and later, ''bluish-green'' or ''gray'') and ''ops'' (ώψ, ''eye'', or sometimes, ''face''). It is interesting to note that ''glaux'' (γλαύξ, "owl") is from the same root, presumably because of the bird's own distinctive eyes. The bird which sees well in the night is closely associated with the goddess of [[wisdom]]: in archaic images, Athena is frequently depicted with an [[Owl of Athena|owl]] (or "owl of Athena" and later under the [[Roman Empire]], "owl of [[Minerva]]") perched on her hand. This pairing evolved in tangent so that even in present day the owl is upheld as a symbol of perspicacity and erudition.<ref name="Deacy, Susan 2001"/> 

Unsurprisingly, the owl became a sort of Athenian mascot. The [[olive]] tree is likewise sacred to her. In earlier times, Athena may well have been a [[bird goddess]], similar to the unknown goddess depicted with owls, wings, and bird talons on the [[Burney relief]], a Mesopotamian terracotta relief of the early second millennium BC.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Other epithets include: '''Aethyia''' under which she was worshiped in [[Megara]].<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], i. 5. § 3; 41. § 6</ref>  The word ''aethyia'' ({{lang|grc|αἴθυια}}) signifies a ''diver'', and figuratively, a ''ship'', so the name must reference Athena teaching the art of shipbuilding or navigation.<ref>[[John Tzetzes]], ''ad Lycophr.'', ''l.c.''</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Schmitz |first=Leonhard |contribution=Aethyta |editor-last=Smith |editor-first = William |title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |volume=1 |page=51 |place=Boston, MA |year=1867 |contribution-url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0060.html }}</ref> In a temple at Phrixa in [[Elis]], which was reportedly built by Clymenus, she was known as '''Cydonia'''.<ref>Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology''.</ref>

The various Athena subgroups, or cults, all branching from the central goddess herself often proctored various initiation rites of Grecian youth, for example, the passage into citizenship by young men and for women the elevation to the status of citizen wife. Her various cults were portals of a uniform socialization, even beyond mainland Greece.<ref>P.Schmitt,"Athena Apatouria et la ceinture: Les aspects feminis des apatouries a Athenes"in ''Annales:Economies, Societies, Civilisations''(1059-1073).London:Thames and Hudson,2000.</ref>

==Epithets==
[[File:Peplos scene BM EV.JPG|thumb|A new ''[[peplos]]'' was woven for Athena and ceremonially brought to dress her [[cult image]] ([[British Museum]]).]]

In the ''[[Iliad]]'' (4.514), the [[Homeric Hymns]], and in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Athena is given the curious epithet '''Tritogeneia.'''  The meaning of this term is unclear. It seems to mean "[[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]-born", perhaps indicating that the sea-deity was her parent according to some early myths.<ref>Karl Kerenyi suggests that "Tritogeneia did not mean that she came into the world on any particular river or lake, but that she was born of the water itself; for the name Triton seems to be associated with water generally." (Kerenyi, p. 128).</ref> In Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' Athena is occasionally referred to as "Tritonia".

Another possible meaning may be ''triple-born'' or ''third-born'', which may refer to a triad or to her status as the third daughter of Zeus or the fact she was born from Metis, Zeus, and herself; various legends list her as being the first child after Artemis and Apollo, though other legends{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} identify her as Zeus' first child. The latter would have to be drawn from Classical myths, however, rather than earlier ones.

In her role as judge at [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes']] trial on the murder of his mother, [[Clytemnestra]] (which he won), Athena won the epithet '''Athena Areia'''.

Other epithets were [[Ageleia]] and [[Itonia]].

[[File:Ac.parthenon5.jpg|thumb|[[The Parthenon]], Temple of Athena Parthenos]]

Athena was given many other cult titles. She has the epithet '''Athena Ergane''' as the patron of craftsmen and artisans. With the epithet ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' ("virgin") she was especially worshipped in the festivals of the [[Panathenaea]] and [[Pamboeotia]] where both militaristic and athletic displays took place.<ref>Robertson,Noel.''Festivals and Legends:The Formation of Greek Cities in the Light of Public Ritual.''Toronto:University of Toronto Press,1992.</ref> With the epithet ''[[Athena Promachos]]'' she led in battle (see [[Promachos]]). With the epithet '''Athena Polias''' ("of the city"), Athena was the protector of not only Athens but also of many other cities, including [[Argos]], [[Sparta]], [[Gortyn]], [[Lindos]], and [[Larisa]].

She was given the epithet '''[[Hippeia|Athena Hippeia]]''' or ''Athena Hippia'' ("horse"), as the inventor of the [[chariot]], and was worshiped under this title at Athens, [[Tegea]] and [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. As Athena Hippeia she was given an alternative parentage: [[Poseidon]] and [[Polyphe]], daughter of [[Oceanus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NymphePolyphe.html |title=POLYPHE: Oceanid nymph of Rhodes in the Aegean; Greek mythology |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100815011529/http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NymphePolyphe.html| archivedate= 15 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Cult/AthenaTitles.html |title=TITLES OF ATHENA: Ancient Greek religion |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100811080707/http://www.theoi.com/Cult/AthenaTitles.html| archivedate= 11 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In each of these cities her temple frequently was the major temple on the acropolis.<ref>Burkert, p. 140.</ref>

Athena often was equated with [[Aphaea]], a local goddess of the island of [[Aegina]], located near [[Athens]], once Aegina was under Athenian's power. The Greek historian [[Plutarch]] (46–120 AD) also refers to an instance during the Parthenon's construction of her being called '''Athena [[Hygieia]]''' ("healer"):

{{quote|A strange accident happened in the course of building, which showed that the goddess was not averse to the work, but was aiding and co-operating to bring it to perfection. One of the artificers, the quickest and the handiest workman among them all, with a slip of his foot fell down from a great height, and lay in a miserable condition, the physicians having no hope of his recovery. When [[Pericles]] was in distress about this, the goddess [Athena] appeared to him at night in a dream, and ordered a course of treatment, which he applied, and in a short time and with great ease cured the man. And upon this occasion it was that he set up a brass statue of Athena Hygeia, in the citadel near the altar, which they say was there before. But it was [[Phidias]] who wrought the goddess's image in gold, and he has his name inscribed on the pedestal as the workman of it.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Pericles'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pericles*.html#13 13.8]</ref>}}

In classical times the [[Plynteria]], or “Feast of Adorning”, was observed every May, it was a festival lasting five days. During this period the Priestesses of Athena, or “Plyntrides”, performed a cleansing ritual within “the Erecththeum”, the personal sanctuary of the goddess. Here Athena's statue was undressed, her clothes washed, and body purified.

In [[Arcadia]], she was assimilated with the ancient goddess Alea and worshiped as [[Athena Alea]].

==In Classical art==
[[File:PallasGiustiniani.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Athena Giustiniani]]'', a Roman copy of a Greek statue of Pallas Athena with her serpent, [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]]]]
[[File:AttalusICorrected.jpg|thumb|Athena depicted on a coin of [[Attalus I]], ruler of [[Pergamon]]; ca. 200 BC.]]
[[Image:StonePaletteMythologicalScene.jpg|thumb|Mythological scene with Athena (left) and [[Herakles]] (right), on a [[stone palette]] of the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], [[India]]]]

Classically, Athena is portrayed wearing a full- length [[chiton (costume)|chiton]],  and sometimes in armor, with her helmet raised high on the forehead to reveal the image of [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]. Her shield bears at its centre the aegis with the head of the gorgon (gorgoneion) in the center and snakes around the edge. It is in this standing posture that she was depicted in [[Phidias]]'s famous lost [[Chryselephantine|gold and ivory]] statue of her, 36 m tall, the ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' in the [[Parthenon]]. Athena also often is depicted with an [[owl]] sitting on one of her shoulders.<ref>The owl's role as a symbol of wisdom originates in this association with Athena.</ref> 

The ''[[Mourning Athena]]'' is a relief sculpture that dates around 460 BC and portrays a weary Athena resting on a staff.<!--better interpretation?-->
In earlier, archaic portraits of Athena in [[Black-figure pottery]], the goddess retains some of her Minoan-Mycenaean character, such as great bird wings although this is not true of archaic sculpture such as those of [[Aphaean Athena]], where Athena has subsumed an earlier, invisibly numinous—''[[Aphaea]]''—goddess with Cretan connections in her ''mythos''.

Other commonly received and repeated types of Athena in sculpture may be found in [[:Category:Athena types|this list]].

Apart from her attributes, there seems to be a relative consensus in late sculpture from the Classical period, the 5th century onward, as to what Athena looked like. Most noticeable in the face is perhaps the full round strong, chin with a high nose that has a high bridge as a natural extension of the forehead. The eyes typically are somewhat deeply set. The unsmiling lips are usually full, but the mouth is depicted fairly narrow, usually just slightly wider than the nose. The neck is somewhat long. The net result is a serene, serious, somewhat aloof, and very classical beauty.

==Name, etymology, and origin==
Athena had a special relationship with [[Athens]], as is shown by the etymological connection of the names of the goddess and the city. She competed with Poseidon and she won by creating the olive tree; the Athenians accepted her gift and named the city after her. The citizens of Athens built a statue of Athena as a temple to the goddess, which had piercing eyes, a helmet on her head, attired with an [[aegis]] or [[cuirass]], and an extremely long spear. It also had a crystal shield with the head of the Gorgon on it. A large snake accompanied her and she held the goddess of victory in her hand.

[[File:Bust Athena Velletri Glyptothek Munich 213.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Athena in the [[Glyptothek]]]]
Athena is associated with [[Athens]], a plural name because it was the place where she presided over her sisterhood, the ''Athenai'', in earliest times: [[Mycenae]] was the city where the Goddess was called Mykene, and Mycenae is named in the plural for the sisterhood of females who tended her there. At [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] she was called Thebe, and the city again a plural, Thebae (or Thebes, where the "s" is the plural formation). Similarly, at Athens she was called Athena, and the city Athenae (or Athens, again a plural)."<ref>Ruck and Staples 1994:24.</ref>  Whether her name is attested in [[Eteocretan]] or not will have to wait for decipherment of [[Linear A]].

Günther Neumann has suggested that Athena's name is possibly of [[Lydian language|Lydian]] origin;<ref>Günther Neumann, "Der lydische Name der Athena. Neulesung der lydischen Inschrift Nr. 40" ''Kadmos'' '''6''' (1967).</ref> it may be a compound word derived in part from [[Tyrrhenian languages|Tyrrhenian]] "ati", meaning ''mother'' and the name of the [[Hurrian]] goddess "[[Hannahannah]]" shortened in various places to "Ana" {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. In [[Mycenaean Greek]], at [[Knossos]] a single inscription ''A-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja'' ''/Athana potniya/'' appears in the [[Linear B]] tablets from the Late Minoan II-era "Room of the Chariot Tablets"; these comprise the earliest Linear B archive anywhere.<ref>Kn V 52 (text 208 in Ventris and Chadwick).</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&wid=797 |title=Palaeolexicon, Word study tool of ancient languages |publisher=Palaeolexicon.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref>

Although ''Athana potniya'' often is translated ''Mistress Athena'', it literally means "the ''potnia'' of At(h)ana", which perhaps, means ''the Lady of Athens'';<ref>Palaima, p. 444.</ref> Any connection to the city of Athens in the Knossos inscription is uncertain.<ref>Burkert, p. 44.</ref> We also find ''A-ta-no-dju-wa-ja'' ''/Athana diwya/'', the final part being the Linear B spelling of what we know from Ancient Greek as ''Diwia'' (Mycenaean ''di-u-ja'' or ''di-wi-ja''): '''''divine''''' Athena also was a weaver and the deity of crafts (see ''[[dyeus]]'').<ref>Ventris and Chadwick [page missing]</ref>

In a [[Mycenea]]n fresco, there is a composition of two women extending their hands towards a central figure who is covered by an enormous figure-eight shield. The central figure is the war-goddess with her palladium, or her palladium in an aniconic representation. Mylonas believes that she was a Mycenaean creation.<ref> G. Mylonas (1965) ''Mycenae and the Mycenaean world'' p.159 ,Princeton University Press.</ref> Nilsson claims that she was the goddess of the palace who protected the king, and that the origin of Athena was the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] domestic snake-goddess.<ref> Athena is closely related with the snakes and the birds: Μ.Nilsson (1967) ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion'' C.F.Beck Verlag, Munchen, pp 347,433 </ref> In the so-called Procession-fresco in [[Knossos]] which was reconstructed by the Mycenaeans, two rows of figures carrying vessels, seem to meet in front of a central figure.

''Thera and the Aegean world I'', Thera and the Aegean world London. </ref>     

In his dialogue ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', the Greek philosopher [[Plato]], 428/427 BC – 348/347 BC, gives the etymology of Athena's name, based on the view of the ancient Athenians:

{{quote|That is a graver matter, and there, my friend, the modern interpreters of Homer may, I think, assist in explaining the view of the ancients. For most of these in their explanations of the poet, assert that he meant by Athena "mind" [''[[nous]]''] and "intelligence" [''[[dianoia]]''], and the maker of names appears to have had a singular notion about her; and indeed calls her by a still higher title, "divine intelligence" [''Theou noesis - θεοῦ νόησις''], as though he would say: This is she who has the mind of God (a theonoa - ἁ θεονόα). Perhaps, however, the name Theonoe may mean "she who knows divine things" (ta theia noousa - τὰ θεῖα νοοῦσα) better than others. Nor shall we be far wrong in supposing that the author of it wished to identify this Goddess with moral intelligence [''en ethei noesin''], and therefore gave her the name etheonoe; which, however, either he or his successors have altered into what they thought a nicer form, and called her Athena''.|Plato, ''Cratylus'', 407b}}

Thus for Plato her name was to be derived from Greek Ἀθεονόα, ''Atheonóa''—which the later Greeks rationalised as from the deity's (''theos'') mind (''nous'').

Plato noted that the Egyptian citizens of [[Sais]] in Egypt worshipped a goddess whose Egyptian name was [[Neith]];<ref>"''The citizens have a deity for their foundress; she is called in the Egyptian tongue Neith, and is asserted by them to be the same whom the Hellenes call Athena; they are great lovers of the Athenians, and say that they are in some way related to them"''. ('' [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 21e)</ref> and they identified her with Athena. (''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 21e), (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 2:170–175).

Some authors{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} believe that, in early times, Athena was either an [[owl]] herself or a [[bird goddess]] in general: in Book 3 of the [[Odyssey]], she takes the form of a [[Sea eagle (bird)|sea-eagle]]. These authors argue that she dropped her prophylactic owl-mask before she lost her wings. "Athena, by the time she appears in art," Jane Ellen Harrison had remarked, "has completely shed her animal form, has reduced the shapes she once wore of snake and bird to attributes, but occasionally in [[Black figure pottery|black-figure vase-paintings]] she still appears with wings."<ref>Harrison 1922:306. ([http://people.uncw.edu/kozloffm/Winged_Athena.jpg Harrison 1922:307 fig. 84: detail of a cup in the Faina collection]).</ref>

Some Greek authors{{who|date=April 2010}} have derived natural symbols from the etymological roots of Athena's names to be aether, air, earth, and moon. This was one of the primary developments of scholarly exploration in the ancient world.<ref>Johrens.Athenahymnus,438-452.</ref>

==Post-classical culture==
A brief summary of Athena's evolution of myriad motifs after her dominance in Greece may be seen as follows: The rise of Christianity in Greece largely ended the worship of Greek deities and polytheism in general, but she resurfaced in the Middle Ages as a defender of sagacity and virtue so that her warrior status was still intact. (She may be found on some family crests of nobility.) During the Renaissance she donned the mantle of patron of the arts and human endeavor and finally although not ultimately, Athena personified the miracles of freedom and republic during the French Revolution. (A statue of the goddess was centered on the Place de la Revolution in Paris.)<ref name="Deacy, Susan 2001"/>

For over a century [[Parthenon (Nashville)|a full-scale replica of the Parthenon]] has stood in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], which is known as ''the Athens of the South''. In 1990, a gilded 41 feet (12.5 m) tall [[Athena Parthenos|replica of Phidias' statue]] of Athena Parthenos was added. The state [[seal of California]] features an image of Athena (or Minerva) kneeling next to a brown grizzly bear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=97 |title=Symbols of the Seal of California |publisher=LearnCalifornia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref>

Athena is a natural patron of universities: she is the symbol of the [[Darmstadt University of Technology]], in Germany, and the [[Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro|Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]], in Brazil. Her image can be found in the shields of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters and the Faculty of Sciences of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], where her owl is the symbol of the Faculty of Chemistry.  At [[Bryn Mawr College]] in Pennsylvania a statue of Athena (a replica of the original bronze one in the arts and archaeology library) resides in the Great Hall. It is traditional at exam time for students to leave offerings to the goddess with a note asking for good luck, or to repent for accidentally breaking any of the college's numerous other traditions. Athena's owl also serves as the mascot of the college, and one of the college hymns is "Pallas Athena". Pallas Athena is the tutelary goddess of the international social fraternity [[Phi Delta Theta]].<ref name="pdt">{{cite web |url=http://www.phideltatheta.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=20&Itemid=122 |title=Phi Delta Theta International - Symbols |accessdate=2008-06-07 |publisher=phideltatheta.org |date= | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080607045215/http://www.phideltatheta.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=20&Itemid=122| archivedate= 7 June 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Her owl is also a symbol of the fraternity.<ref name="pdt"/>

[[Jean Boucher (artist)|Jean Boucher]]'s statue of the seated skeptical thinker [[Ernest Renan]], shown to the left, caused great controversy when it was installed in Tréguier, [[Brittany]] in 1902. Renan's 1862 biography of Jesus had denied his divinity, and he had written the "[http://www.lexilogos.com/document/renan/acropolis.htm Prayer on the Acropolis]" addressed to the goddess Athena. The statue was placed in the square fronted by the cathedral. Renan's head was turned away from the building, while Athena, beside him, was depicted raising her arm, which was interpreted as indicating a challenge to the church during an anti-clerical phase in French official culture. The installation was accompanied by a mass protest from local Roman Catholics and a religious service against the growth of [[skepticism]] and [[secularism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeanboucher.net/?d=monuments&p=monuments |title=Musee Virtuel Jean Boucher |publisher=Jeanboucher.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref>

Athena has been used numerous times as a symbol of a republic by different countries and appears on currency as she did on the ancient [[drachma]] of Athens.
Athena (Minerva) is the subject of the $50 1915-S Panama-Pacific [[commemorative coin]]. At 2.5 troy oz (78 g) gold, this is the largest (by [[weight]]) coin ever produced by the [[United States Mint|U.S. Mint]]. This was the first $50 coin issued by the U.S. Mint and no higher was produced until the production of the $100 platinum coins in 1997. Of course, in terms of face-value in adjusted dollars, the 1915 is the highest denomination ever issued by the U.S. Mint.

Athena was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the Greek 100 [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] banknote of 1978-2001.<ref>[http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en Bank of Greece]. Drachma Banknotes & Coins: [http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en/Banknotes/banknote_selection.asp?Value=100 100 drachmas]. – Retrieved on 27 March 2009.</ref> Another recent example is the [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2005 coinage|60 Years of the Second Republic commemorative coin]] issued by Austria in 2005. Athena is depicted in the obverse of the coin, representing the Austrian Republic.

==Changed status in classical mythology==
In [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] mythology the role of Athena changed as the pantheon became organized under the leadership of Zeus. In earlier mythology she is identified as a [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenic]] daughter of a goddess, but the classical myths fashion for her a peculiar "birth from the head of Zeus" that assigns a father for Athena and eliminates a mother for her, identifying the father as a deity who at one time was portrayed as her brother. Athens may have fallen in 404 B.C. but the cult of Athena was so dominant in the culture that it survived the transitions seen in the mythic roles of other goddesses, albeit with a juggling of "family" relationships.  

J.J. Bachofen advocated that Athena was originally a maternal figure stable in her security and poise but was caught up and perverted by a patriarchal society; this was especially the case in Athens. The goddess adapted but could very easily be seen as a god. He viewed it as "motherless paternity in the place of fatherless maternity" where once altered, Athena's character was to be crystallized as that of a patriarch.<ref>J.J. Bachofen."Mother Right:An investigation of religious and juridicial character of matriarchy in the ancient world",''Myth, Religion and Mother Right''.London:Routledge and Kegan Paul,1967.</ref>

Whereas Bachofen saw the switch to paternity on Athena's behalf as an increase of power, Freud on the contrary perceived Athena as an "original mother goddess divested of her power". In this interpretation, Athena was demoted to be only Zeus's daughter, never allowed the expression of motherhood. Still more different from Bachofen's perspective is the lack of role permanency in Freud's view: Freud held that time and differing cultures would mold Athena to stand for what was necessary to them.<ref>Shearer,''Athene'',224-235.</ref>

Some modern authors classify the changes as an "androgynous compromise" that allowed her traits and what she stood for to be attributed to male and female rulers alike over the course of history (such as Marie de' Medici, Anne of Austria, Christina of Sweden, and Catherine the Great).<ref>F.Zeitlin,"The Dynamics of Misogyny:Myth and Mythmaking in the Oresteia",''Arethusa''15(1978), 182.</ref>
