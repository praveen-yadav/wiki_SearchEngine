'''Bigfoot''', also known as '''sasquatch''', is the name given to an [[ape]]- or [[Hominidae|hominid]]-like creature that some people believe inhabits forests, mainly in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of [[North America]]. Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] [[humanoid]]. The term ''sasquatch'' is an anglicized derivative of the [[Halkomelem language|Halkomelem]] word ''sásq’ets''.<ref name="Bright">Bright, William (2004). ''Native American Place Names of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 422</ref><ref>{{Dictionary.com|Sasquatch|accessdate=February 15, 2012}}</ref>

Most scientists discount the existence of Bigfoot and consider it to be a combination of [[folklore]], misidentification, and [[hoax]],<ref>[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], pp. 62–63.</ref> rather than a living animal, because of the lack of physical evidence and the large numbers of creatures that would be necessary to maintain a breeding population.<ref name="skepdic" /><ref name="breedingpop">{{cite web |url= http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/news/bfhunting.html |title= Bigfoot hunting |author= Earls, Stephanie |accessdate= January 2, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100129061319/http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/news/bfhunting.html| archivedate= January 29, 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> A few scientists, such as [[Jane Goodall]],<ref name="NPR">{{cite web |title=[[National Public Radio]]'s ''Science Friday,'' September 27, 2002, [[Ira Flatow]] interviews Dr. Jane Goodall}}</ref><ref name="Goodall2012"/> [[Grover Krantz]], and [[Jeffrey Meldrum]], have expressed interest and some measure of belief in the creature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isu.edu/~meldd/fxnlmorph.html |title= Evaluation of Alleged Sasquatch Footprints and their Inferred Functional Morphology |accessdate=October 18, 2010 }}</ref>

==Description==
Bigfoot is described in reports as a large hairy ape-like creature, in a range of 2–3 m (6.6-9.8&nbsp;ft) tall, weighing in excess of {{convert|500|lb|kg}}, and covered in dark brown or dark reddish hair.<ref name="skepdic">{{cite web |url=http://www.skepdic.com/bigfoot.html |title=Bigfoot [a.k.a.

==History==

===Before 1958===
Wildmen stories are found among the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|indigenous population]] of the Pacific Northwest. The legends existed prior to a single name for the creature.<ref name="Dae04_p28">[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 28</ref> They differed in their details both regionally and between families in the same community. Similar stories of wildmen are found on every continent except Antarctica.<ref name="Dae04_p28" /> Ecologist [[Robert Michael Pyle]] argues that most cultures have human-like giants in their folk history: "We have this need for some larger-than-life creature."<ref name="Goodavage">{{cite web|last=Goodavage |first=Maria |title=Hunt for Bigfoot Attracts True Believers |publisher=''USA TODAY''/bz050 |date=May 24, 1996 |url=http://web.ncf.ca/bz050/HomePage.usatbf.html}}</ref>

Members of the [[Lummi]] tell tales about ''Ts'emekwes'', the local version of Bigfoot. The stories are similar to each other in terms of the general descriptions of ''Ts'emekwes'', but details about the creature's diet and activities differed between the stories of different families.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rasmus |first=S. Michelle |title=Repatriating Words: Local Knowledge in a Global Context |journal=American Indian Quarterly |volume=26 |issue=2 |year=200 |month=Spring |jstor=4128463 |pages=286–307 [292] |doi=10.1353/aiq.2003.0018 }}</ref>

Some regional versions contained more nefarious creatures. The ''stiyaha'' or ''kwi-kwiyai'' were a nocturnal race that children were told not to say the names of lest the monsters hear and come to carry off a person—sometimes to be killed.<ref name="Rigsby">{{cite web |last=Rigsby |first=Bruce |title=Some Pacific Northwest Native Language Names for the Sasquatch Phenomenon |publisher=Bigfoot: Fact or Fantasy? |url=http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/papers/rigsby.html |accessdate=August 18, 2008}}</ref> In 1847, Paul Kane reported stories by the native people about ''skoocooms'': a race of cannibalistic wild men living on the peak of [[Mount St. Helens]].<ref name="SI_Nickell" /> The ''skoocooms'' appear to have been regarded as supernatural, rather than natural.<ref name="SI_Nickell" />

Less menacing versions such as the one recorded by Reverend Elkanah Walker exist. In 1840, Walker, a Protestant missionary, recorded stories of giants among the Native Americans living in [[Spokane, Washington]]. The Indians claimed that these giants lived on and around the peaks of nearby mountains and stole salmon from the fishermen's nets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfootencounters.com/classics/walker.htm |title=The Diary of Elkanah Walker |publisher=Bigfoot Encounters |accessdate=August 1, 2007 }}</ref>

Various local legends were compiled by J. W. Burns in a series of Canadian newspaper articles in the 1920s. Each language had its own name for the local version. Many names meant something along the lines of "wild man" or "hairy man" although other names described common actions it was said to perform (e.g. eating clams).<ref name="Mil07" /> Burns coined the term Sasquatch, which is from the [[Halkomelem language|Halkomelem]] ''sásq’ets'' ({{IPA-sal|ˈsæsqʼəts|IPA}}),<ref name="Bright" /> and used it in his articles to describe a hypothetical single type of creature reflected in these various stories.<ref name="SI_Nickell" /><ref name="Mil07">{{cite book |last=Meldrum |first=Jeff |title=Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science |publisher=Macmillan |year=2007|page=50 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=ggeQHFa5E7AC&lpg=PA50&dq=salish%20sasquatch&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=salish%20sasquatch |accessdate=February 19, 2010 |isbn=978-0-7653-1217-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sasquatch |title=Sasquatch |accessdate=August 7, 2007 |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] }}</ref> Burns's articles popularized both the legend and its new name, making it well known in western [[Canada]] before it gained popularity in the United States.<ref name="missingLinks">{{cite web|url=http://www.parascope.com/en/cryptozoo/missingLinks.htm |title=Bigfoot |accessdate=August 17, 2008 |publisher=Missing Links Primate Center |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990420004631/http://www.parascope.com/en/cryptozoo/missingLinks.htm |archivedate=April 20, 1999}}</ref>

===After 1958===
In 1951, [[Eric Shipton]] had photographed what he described as a [[Yeti]] footprint.<ref name="missingLinks" /> This photograph generated considerable attention and the story of the Yeti entered into popular consciousness. The notoriety of ape-men grew over the decade, culminating in 1958 when large footprints were found in [[Del Norte County, California]] by bulldozer operator Gerald Crew. Sets of large tracks appeared multiple times around a road-construction site in Bluff Creek. After not being taken seriously about what he was seeing, Crew brought in his friend, Bob Titmus, to cast the prints in plaster. The story was published in the ''[[Times-Standard|Humboldt Times]]'' along with a photo of Crew holding one of the casts.<ref name="SI_Nickell" />

Locals had been calling the unseen track-maker "Big Foot" since the late summer, which ''Humboldt Times'' columnist Andrew Genzoli shortened to "Bigfoot" in his article.<ref>[[#Buhs|Blu Buhs 2009]], pp. 69, 75</ref> Bigfoot gained international attention when the story was picked up by the [[Associated Press]].<ref name="SI_Nickell" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Big Footprints: A Scientific Inquiry into the Reality of Sasquatch |last=Krantz |first=Grover |authorlink=Grover Krantz |year=1992 |publisher=Johnson Books |isbn=1-55566-099-1 |page=5 }}</ref> Following the death of [[Raymond L. Wallace|Ray Wallace]] – a local logger – his family attributed the creation of the footprints to him.<ref name="skepdic" /> The wife of L.W. “Scoop” Beal, the editor of the ''Humboldt Standard'', which later combined with the ''Humboldt Times'', in which Genzoli's story had appeared,<ref>[[#Buhs|Blu Buhs 2009]], p. 241</ref> has stated that her husband was in on the hoax with Wallace.<ref>{{Cite news | last=Driscoll | first=John  | title=Birth of Bigfoot | newspaper=The Times-Standard | publication-place=Eureka, CA | date=October 30, 2008 | url=http://www.times-standard.com/ci_10853838 }}</ref>

1958 was a watershed year not just for the Bigfoot story itself but also for the culture that surrounds it. The first Bigfoot hunters appeared following the discovery of footprints at Bluff Creek, California. Within a year, Tom Slick, who had funded searches for Yeti in the Himalayas earlier in the decade, organized searches for Bigfoot in the area around Bluff Creek.<ref>[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 35</ref>

As Bigfoot has become better known and a [[Bigfoot in popular culture|phenomenon in popular culture]], sightings have spread throughout North America. In addition to the Pacific Northwest, the [[Great Lakes region]] and the [[Southeastern United States]] have had many reports of Bigfoot sightings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bfro.net/GDB/ |title=Geographical Database of Bigfoot/Sasquatch Sightings & Reports |publisher=[[BFRO]] |accessdate=April 10, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090228213753/http://www.bfro.net/GDB/| archivedate= February 28, 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Prominent reported sightings==

*'''1958''': Bulldozer operator Jerry Crew took to a newspaper office a cast of one of the enormous footprints he and other workers had seen at an isolated work site at Bluff Creek, California. The crew was overseen by Wilbur L. Wallace, brother of [[Raymond L. Wallace]].

*'''1967''': Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin reported that on October 20 they had captured a purported Sasquatch on film at Bluff Creek, California.

Many years later, Bob Heironimus, an acquaintance of Patterson's, said that he had worn an ape costume for the making of the film.<ref name="SI_Nickell" /> However, Patterson and Gimlin claimed that they sought various experts to examine the film. Patterson claimed to have screened the film for unnamed technicians "in the special effects department at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Hollywood]] ...

==Proposed explanations for sightings==
Various types of creatures have been suggested to explain both the sightings and what type of creature Bigfoot would be if it existed. The scientific community typically attributes sightings to either hoaxes or misidentification of known animals and their tracks. While [[cryptozoologists]] generally explain Bigfoot as an unknown ape, some believers in Bigfoot attribute the phenomenon to [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]] or other [[paranormal]] causes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/scenes_from_a_bigfoot_conference |last=Boston |first=Rob |title=Scenes from a Bigfoot Conference |publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |year=2003 |month=December |accessdate=August 19, 2008 }}</ref>

===Misidentification===

In 2007, the [[Pennsylvania Game Commission]] said that photos the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization claimed showed a juvenile Bigfoot were probably of a bear with [[mange]].<ref name = "ap_bigfoot">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-490638/Is-Bigfoot---bear-bad-skin.html|title=Is this Bigfoot ... or is it a bear with bad skin?|publisher=[[Mail Online]]|date=October 30, 2007 |accessdate=August 16, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21518056/ |title=Hunter's pics revive lively Bigfoot debate |publisher=MSNBC |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> [[Jeffrey Meldrum]], on the other hand, said the limb proportions of the suspected juvenile in question were not bear-like, and stated that he felt they were "more like a chimpanzee."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthfiles333.com/earthfiles/Episode27mp3.html |title=Young Sasquatch?

===Hoaxes===
Both scientists and Bigfoot believers agree that many of the sightings are hoaxes or misidentified animals.<ref name="SI_Radford" />

Bigfoot sightings or footprints are often demonstrably hoaxes. Author Jerome Clark argues that the [[Jacko Hoax|Jacko Affair]], involving an 1884 newspaper report of an apelike creature captured in British Columbia, was a hoax. Citing research by John Green, who found that several contemporary British Columbia newspapers regarded the alleged capture as very dubious, Clark notes that the ''Mainland Guardian'' of [[New Westminster, British Columbia]], wrote, "Absurdity is written on the face of it."<ref>{{cite book |page=195 |last=Clark |first=Jerome |title=Unexplained! 347 Strange Sightings, Incredible Occurrences and Puzzling Physical Phenomena |publisher=Visible Ink |year=1993 |isbn=0-8103-9436-7}}</ref>

On July 14, 2005, [[Tom Biscardi]], a long-time Bigfoot enthusiast and CEO of Searching for Bigfoot Inc., appeared on the [[Coast to Coast AM]] paranormal radio show and announced that he was "98% sure that his group will be able to capture a Bigfoot which they have been tracking in the [[Happy Camp, California]] area."<ref name="Biscardi_C2C">{{cite web|url= http://www.oregonbigfoot.com/georgia_bigfoot_dead_body_in_freezer_dyer_whitton_biscardi.php |title= Georgia Bigfoot body in freezer |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref> A month later, Biscardi announced on the same radio show that he had access to a captured Bigfoot and was arranging a [[pay-per-view]] event for people to see it. Biscardi appeared on Coast to Coast AM again a few days later to announce that there was no captive Bigfoot. Biscardi blamed an unnamed woman for misleading him and the show's audience for being gullible.<ref name="Biscardi_C2C" />

On July 9, 2008, Rick Dyer and Matthew Whitton posted a video to [[YouTube]] claiming that they had discovered the body of a dead Sasquatch in a forest in northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Tom Biscardi was contacted to investigate. Dyer and Whitton received $50,000 from Searching for Bigfoot, Inc., as a [[good faith]] gesture.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.ajc.com/search/content/metro/clayton/stories/2008/08/20/bigfoot_hoax_lawsuit.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081206031312/http://www.ajc.com/search/content/metro/clayton/stories/2008/08/20/bigfoot_hoax_lawsuit.html |archivedate=December 6, 2008|title=Searching for Bigfoot group to sue Georgia hoaxers |publisher=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |date=August 20, 2008 |first=Christian |last=Boone |coauthors=Kathy Jefcoats}}</ref> The story of the men's claims was covered by many major news networks, including [[BBC]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7564635.stm | work=BBC News | title=Americans 'find body of Bigfoot' | date=August 15, 2008 | accessdate=March 31, 2010}}</ref> [[CNN]],<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/bigfoot.body/ |title= Body proves Bigfoot no myth, hunters say | work=CNN |date=August 15, 2008 | accessdate=March 31, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100318004729/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/bigfoot.body/| archivedate= March 18, 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> [[ABC News]],<ref>{{cite news|url= http://a.abcnews.com/Technology/story?id=5590180 |title= Legend of Bigfoot: Discovery or Hoax? |work=ABC News |date=August 15, 2008 |author= Ki Mae Heusser |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref> and [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Aug16/0,4670,BigfootClaim,00.html |title= Georgia men claim hairy, frozen corpse is Bigfoot |date=September 16, 2008 |first= Malia |last= Wollan |accessdate=April 1, 2010 | work=Fox News}}</ref> Soon after a press conference, the alleged Bigfoot body arrived in a block of ice in a freezer with the Searching for Bigfoot team.

===''Gigantopithecus''===
[[File:Gigantopithecus blacki mandible 010112.jpg|250px|thumb|Fossil jaw of ''Gigantopithecus blacki'', an extinct primate]]
Bigfoot proponents [[Grover Krantz]] and [[Geoffrey Bourne (anatomist)|Geoffrey Bourne]] believed that Bigfoot could be a [[relict|relict population]] of ''[[Gigantopithecus]]''. Bourne contends that as all ''Gigantopithecus'' fossils were found in Asia, and as many species of animals migrated across the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]], it is not unreasonable to assume that ''Gigantopithecus'' might have as well.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gentle Giants: The Gorilla Story |last=Bourne |first=Geoffrey H. |coauthors=Cohen, Maury |year=1975 |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |isbn=0-399-11528-5 |page=296 }}</ref>

The ''Gigantopithecus'' hypothesis is generally considered entirely speculative. ''Gigantopithecus'' fossils are not found in the Americas.  As the only recovered fossils are of [[mandible]]s and teeth, there is some uncertainty about ''Gigantopithecus's'' locomotion. Krantz has argued, based on his extrapolation of the shape of its mandible, that ''[[Gigantopithecus blacki]]'' could have been bipedal.  However, the relevant part of mandible is not present in any fossils.<ref>[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 14</ref> The mainstream view is that ''Gigantopithecus'' was [[quadruped]]al, and it has been argued that ''Gigantopithecus's'' enormous mass would have made it difficult for it to adopt a bipedal gait.

Matt Cartmill presents another problem with the ''Gigantopithecus'' hypothesis: "The trouble with this account is that ''Gigantopithecus'' was not a hominin and maybe not even a crown-group hominoid; yet the physical evidence implies that Bigfoot is an upright biped with buttocks and a long, stout, permanently adducted hallux. These are hominin autapomorphies, not found in other mammals or other bipeds. It seems unlikely that ''Gigantopithecus'' would have evolved these uniquely [[hominini|hominin]] traits in parallel."<ref>[[#Car08|Cartmill 2008]], p. 117</ref>

Bernard G. Campbell wrote: "That ''Gigantopithecus'' is in fact extinct has been questioned by those who believe it survives as the Yeti of the Himalayas and the Sasquatch of the north-west American coast. But the evidence for these creatures is not convincing."<ref>{{cite book |title=Humankind Emerging |last=Campbell |first=Bernard G.|year=1979 |publisher= Little, Brown and Company |id=Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 78-78234 |page=100 |isbn=0-673-52170-2 }}</ref>

===Extinct hominidae===
A species of ''[[Paranthropus]]'', such as ''[[Paranthropus robustus]]'', with its crested skull and bipedal gait, was suggested by primatologist [[John Napier (primatologist)|John Napier]] and anthropologist Gordon Strasenburg as a possible candidate for Bigfoot's identity,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bfro.net/REF/scinafaq.htm |title=Scientific Names for Bigfoot |last=Coleman |first=Loren |publisher=BFRO |accessdate=August 19, 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080909091922/http://www.bfro.net/REF/scinafaq.htm| archivedate= September 9, 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> despite the fact that fossils of ''Paranthropus'' are found only in Africa.

Michael Rugg, of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum, presented a comparison between human, ''Gigantopithecus'' and ''[[Meganthropus]]'' skulls (reconstructions made by [[Grover Krantz]]) in episodes 131 and 132 of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum Show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfootdiscoveryproject.com/media.php |title=Bigfoot Discovery Project Media |accessdate=April 4, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100419030214/http://www.bigfootdiscoveryproject.com/media.php| archivedate= April 19, 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> He favorably compares a modern tooth suspected of coming from a Bigfoot to the ''Meganthropus'' fossil teeth, noting the worn enamel on the [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlusal]] surface.  The ''Meganthropus'' fossils originated from Asia, and the tooth was found near Santa Cruz, California.

Some suggest [[Neanderthal]], ''[[Homo erectus]]'', or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' to be the creature, but no remains of any of those species have  been found in the [[Americas]].<ref>[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 16</ref>

==Scientific view==
{{see also|Formal studies of Bigfoot}}

The scientific community discounts the existence of Bigfoot, as there is no evidence supporting the survival of such a large, prehistoric ape-like creature. The evidence that does exist points more towards a hoax or delusion than to sightings of a genuine creature.<ref name="skepdic" /> In a 1996 ''[[USA Today]]'' article, Washington State zoologist John Crane said, "There is no such thing as Bigfoot. No data other than material that's clearly been fabricated has ever been presented."<ref name="Goodavage"/> In addition to the lack of evidence, scientists cite the fact that Bigfoot is alleged to live in regions unusual for a large, nonhuman primate, i.e., temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere; all recognized nonhuman apes are found in the [[tropics]] of Africa and Asia.

As with other proposed megafauna cryptids, climate and food supply issues would make such a creature's survival in reported habitats unlikely.<ref name="Sjögren, Bengt 1980">{{cite book |author= Sjögren, Bengt |title= ''Berömda vidunder'' |publisher= Settern |year= 1980 |isbn= 91-7586-023-6}}{{sv icon}}</ref> Great apes are not found in the fossil record in the Americas, and no Bigfoot remains are known to have been found. Scientific consensus is that the breeding population of such an animal would be so large that it would account for many more purported sightings than currently occur, making the existence of such an animal an almost certain impossibility.<ref name="breedingpop"/> In the 1970s, when Bigfoot "experts" were frequently given high-profile media coverage, the scientific community generally avoided lending credence to the theories by debating them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Anatomy of a beast: obsession and myth on the trail of Bigfoot|last=McLeod|first=Michael|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25571-5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_6FmjJYd13wC&pg=PA4|page=4|year=2009|location=Berkley}}</ref>

A few scientists have been less skeptical about the claims of the existence of Sasquatch. Idaho university professor [[Jeffrey Meldrum]] characterizes the search for Sasquatch as "a valid scientific endeavor",{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} and says that the fossil remains of an ancient giant ape called ''Gigantopithecus'' could turn out to be ancestors of today’s commonly known Bigfoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=When Legend Meets Science: A Scientific analysis to the Sasquatch – or Bigfoot – debate|last=Meldrum |first=Jeffrey |authorlink=Jeffrey Meldrum |year=2006 |publisher=Johnson Books |isbn= 0-7653-1216-6 |page=320 }}</ref> John Napier asserts that the scientific community's attitude towards Bigfoot stems primarily from insufficient evidence.<ref>[[#Nap73|Napier 1973]]</ref> Other scientists who have shown varying degrees of interest in the legend are anthropologist David Daegling,<ref>[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]]</ref> field biologist [[George Schaller]],<ref name="Goodavage"/><ref name="latimes">{{cite news | last =Bailey | first =Eric | title =Bigfoot's Big Feat: New Life; A prankster's deeds revealed posthumously appeared to doom the legend. | pages =section A.1 | publisher =''The Los Angeles Times'' | date =April 19, 2003 | url =http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/325851481.html?dids=325851481:325851481&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+19%2C+2003&author=Eric+Bailey&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=A.1&desc=The+State%3B+COLUMN+ONE%3B+Bigfoot%27s+Big+Feat%3A+New+Life%3B+A+prankster%27s+deeds+revealed+posthumously+appeared+to+doom+the+legend.+But+Sasquatch+still+looms+large%2C+and+scientists+are+intrigued. | accessdate =October 5, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[[#Nap73|Napier 1973]], p. 197</ref> [[Russell Mittermeier]], [[Daris Swindler]], [[Esteban Sarmiento]],<ref>{{cite news |last = Stein |first = Theo |title = Bigfoot Believers |work = The Denver Post |date =January 5, 2003 }}</ref> and [[Carleton S.

[[Jane Goodall]], in a September 27, 2002, interview on National Public Radio's "Science Friday", expressed her ideas about the existence of Bigfoot. First stating "I'm sure they exist", she later went on to say, chuckling, "Well, I'm a romantic, so I always wanted them to exist", and finally: "You know, why isn't there a body? I can't answer that, and maybe they don't exist, but I want them to."<ref name="NPR" /> In 2012, Goodall said, "I'm fascinated and would actually love them to exist."<ref name=Goodall2012>{{cite news|last=Moye|first=David|title=Jane Goodall 'Fascinated' By Bigfoot (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/01/jane-goodall-bigfoot_n_1927876.html|accessdate=August 7, 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=October 1, 2012}}</ref>

==Bigfoot DNA claim==
After what [[The Huffington Post]] described as "a five-year study of purported Bigfoot (also known as Sasquatch) DNA samples,"<ref name=HuffingtonPost>{{cite web|last=Speigel|first=Lee|title=Bigfoot DNA Tests: Science Journal's Credibility Called Into Question|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/bigfoot-dna-results-final_n_2681135.html|date=February 14, 2013|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref> Texas veterinarian Melba Ketchum  and her team announced that they had found proof that the Sasquatch "is a human relative that arose approximately 15,000 years ago as a hybrid cross of modern Homo sapiens with an unknown primate species." Ketchum called for this to be recognized officially, saying that "Government at all levels must recognize them as an indigenous people and immediately protect their human and Constitutional rights against those who would see in their physical and cultural differences a 'license' to hunt, trap, or kill them."<ref name="Nicholson">{{cite news|last=Nicholson|first=Eric|title=A Texas Geneticist Apparently Invented a Science Journal to Publish Her DNA Proof of Bigfoot|url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/unfairpark/2013/02/a_texas_geneticist_apparently.php|accessdate=March 2, 2013|newspaper=Dallas Observer|date=February 15, 2013}}</ref>

Failing to find a [[scientific journal]] that would publish their results, Ketchum announced on February 13, 2013 that their research had been published in the ''DeNovo Journal of Science''. The Huffington Post discovered that the domain had been registered anonymously only nine days before the announcement. The only edition of DeNovo was listed as Volume 1, Issue 1, and its only content was the Bigfoot research.<ref name="Nicholson"/><ref name=Discovery.com>{{cite news|last=Radford|first=Benjamin|title='Bigfoot DNA' Study Seeks Yeti Rights|url=http://news.discovery.com/adventure/bigfoot-dna-study-goal-govt-protection-for-creatures-130214.htm|accessdate=March 1, 2013|newspaper=Discovery.com|date=February 14, 2013}}</ref>

==Bigfoot organizations==
There are several organizations dedicated to the research and investigation of Bigfoot sightings in the United States. The oldest and largest{{citation needed |date=December 2012}} is the [http://www.bfro.net/ Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO)]. The BFRO also provides a free database to individuals and other organizations. Their internet website includes reports from across North America that have been investigated by researchers to determine credibility.<ref>{{cite book |title=Bigfoot!:The True Story of Apes in America |last=Coleman |first=Loren |year=2003 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |page=233|isbn=1439187789 }}</ref>

==Popular culture==
{{main|Bigfoot in popular culture}}
Bigfoot has had a demonstrable impact as a [[popular culture]] phenomenon. It has "become entrenched in American popular culture and it is as viable an icon as Michael Jordan" with more than forty-five years having passed since reported sightings in California, and neither an animal nor "a satisfying explanation as to why folks see giant hairy men that don't exist".<ref>[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 4.</ref>
