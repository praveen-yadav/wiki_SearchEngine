'''Amputation''' is the removal of a body extremity by [[Physical trauma|trauma]], prolonged constriction, or [[surgery]]. As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb, such as [[cancer|malignancy]] or [[gangrene]]. In some cases, it is carried out on individuals as a preventative surgery for such problems. A special case is that of [[congenital amputation]], a [[congenital disorder]], where [[fetus|fetal]] limbs have been cut off by constrictive bands. In some countries, amputation of the hands, feet or other body parts is or was used as a form of [[punishment]] for people who committed crimes. Amputation has also been used as a tactic in war and acts of terrorism; it may also occur as a war injury. In some cultures and religions, minor amputations or mutilations are considered a ritual accomplishment. Unlike some non-mammalian animals (such as [[lizard]]s that shed their tails, [[salamanders]] that can regrow many missing body parts, and [[hydras]], [[flatworms]], and [[starfish]] that can regrow entire bodies from small fragments), once removed, human extremities do not grow back, unlike portions of some organs, such as the [[liver]]. A [[Organ transplant|transplant]] or a [[prosthesis]] are the only options for recovering the loss.

In the US, the majority of new amputations occur due to complications of the vascular system (the blood vessels), especially from diabetes. Between 1988 and 1996, there were an average of 133,735 hospital discharges for amputation per year in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amputee-coalition.org/fact_sheets/amp_stats_cause.html |title=Amputee Coalition Factsheet |publisher=Amputee-coalition.org |date=2012-07-23 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>

==Types==

===Leg amputations===
:* amputation of [[toe|digits]]
:* partial foot amputation (Chopart, [[Tarsometatarsal articulations|Lisfranc]], Ray)
:* ankle disarticulation (Syme,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pinzur |first=M.S. |authorlink=  |year=2003 |month=September |title=Syme ankle disarticulation in patients with diabetes |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=85-A |issue=9 |pages=1667–1672 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=12954823 |last2=Stuck |first2=RM |last3=Sage |first3=R |last4=Hunt |first4=N |last5=Rabinovich |first5=Z }}</ref> Pyrogoff)
:* below-knee amputation, abbreviated as {{visible anchor|BKA}}. Intentionally performed surgical below-knee amputation can be performed by transtibial techniques such as Burgess and Kingsley Robinson.
:* knee disarticulation (Gritti or Gritti-Stokes)
:* above-knee amputation (transfemoral)
:* Van-ness rotation/[[rotationplasty]] (foot being turned around and reattached to allow the ankle joint to be used as a knee)
:* hip disarticulation
:* [[hemipelvectomy]]/hindquarter amputation

===Arm amputations===
[[File:Amputations 18c.jpg|thumb|250px|The 18th century guide to amputations]]
* amputation of [[finger|digits]]
* [[metacarpal]] amputation
* wrist disarticulation
* forearm amputation (transradial)
* elbow disarticulation
* above-elbow amputation (transhumeral)
* shoulder disarticulation and [[forequarter amputation]]
* [[Krukenberg procedure]]

===Other amputations===
* Face:
** amputation of the ears
** amputation of the nose ([[rhinotomy]])
** amputation of the tongue ([[glossectomy]]).
** amputation of the eyes ([[blinding]]). Many of these facial disfigurings were and still are done in some parts of the world as punishment for some crimes, and as individual shame and population terror practices.
** amputation of the teeth.  Removal of teeth, mainly incisors, is or was practiced by some cultures for ritual purposes (for instance in the [[Iberomaurusian]] culture of [[Prehistoric Central North Africa|Neolithic North Africa]]).
* Breasts:
** amputation of the breasts ([[mastectomy]]).
* [[Genitals]] amputation
** amputation of the scrotum.
** amputation of the testicles ([[castration]]).
** amputation of the penis ([[penectomy]]).
** amputation of the [[foreskin]] ([[circumcision]]).
** amputation of the clitoris ([[clitoridectomy]]).

[[Hemicorporectomy]], or amputation at the waist, and [[decapitation]], or amputation at the neck, are the most radical amputations.

[[Genital modification and mutilation]] may involve amputating tissue, although not necessarily as a result of injury or disease.

As a rule, partial amputations are preferred to preserve joint function, but in oncological surgery, disarticulation is favored.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===Self-amputation===
{{See also|Autotomy|Body integrity identity disorder}}

In some rare cases when a person has become trapped in a deserted place, with no means of communication or hope of rescue, the victim has amputated his or her own limb:

* In 2003, an Australian coal miner amputated his own arm with a [[Stanley knife]] after it became trapped when the [[front-end loader]] he was driving overturned three kilometers underground. The amputation proved to be unnecessary as emergency services arrived and recovered the trapped arm, but were unable to reattach it.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/29/1056825279321.html | title=Arm trapped, and fearing fire, tough miner knew what to do | work=The Sydney Morning Herald|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKenlzUO |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}</ref>
* In the 1990s, a crab fisherman got his arm caught in the winch during a storm and had to amputate it at the shoulder, as reported in [[The New Englander]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Even rarer are cases where self-amputation is performed for criminal or political purposes:
* On March 7, 1998, Daniel Rudolph, the elder brother of the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|1996 Olympics bomber]] [[Eric Robert Rudolph]], videotaped himself cutting off one of his own hands with an electric saw to "send a message to the FBI and the media."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/US/9803/09/briefs.pm/rudolph.amputation/ |title = Bombing suspect's brother cuts hand off with saw | date = March 9, 1998 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKep10x6 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}</ref>

[[Body integrity identity disorder]] is a psychological condition in which an individual feels compelled to remove one or more of their body parts, usually a limb.  In some cases, that individual may take drastic measures to remove the offending appendages, either by causing irreparable damage to the limb so that medical intervention cannot save the limb, or by causing the limb to be severed.

==Causes==

===Circulatory disorders===
* [[Diabetes|Diabetic]] foot infection or [[gangrene]] (the most frequent reason for infection-related amputations)
* [[Sepsis]] with peripheral necrosis

===Neoplasm===
[[Image:1daypost.jpg|thumb|right|Transfemoral amputation due to [[liposarcoma]]]]
* Cancerous bone or soft tissue tumors (e.g. [[osteosarcoma]], [[osteochondroma]], [[fibrosarcoma]], [[epithelioid sarcoma]], [[Ewing's sarcoma]], [[synovial sarcoma]], [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]], [[liposarcoma]])
* [[Melanoma]]

===Trauma===
[[Image:World War I radiography amputee.jpg|thumb|Three fingers from a soldier's right hand were traumatically amputated during [[World War I]].]]

* Severe limb [[injury|injuries]] in which the limb cannot be saved or efforts to save the limb fail.
* [[Physical trauma|Traumatic]] amputation (an unexpected amputation that occurs at the scene of an accident, where the limb is partially or entirely severed as a direct result of the accident, for example a finger that is severed from the blade of a table saw).
* Amputation in utero ([[Amniotic band]])

===Deformities===
* Deformities of digits and/or limbs (e.g., [[proximal femoral focal deficiency]])
* Extra digits and/or limbs (e.g., [[polydactyly]])

===Infection===
* Bone infection ([[osteomyelitis]])
* [[diabetes]]
* [[frostbite]]

===Athletic performance===
* Sometimes professional [[Sportsperson|athletes]] may choose to have a non-essential digit amputated to relieve chronic pain and impaired performance. Australian Rules footballer [[Daniel Chick]] elected to have his left [[ring finger]] amputated as chronic pain and injury was limiting his performance.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/sport/2002/0122/aussierules.html RTE: Aussie Rules star has finger removed]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> [[Rugby union]] player [[Jone Tawake]] also had a finger removed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Australian Rugby Union |url=http://www.sportsaustralia.com/articles/oct06/artid6659.html |title=Tawake undergoes surgery to remove finger |publisher=SportsAustralia.com |date=2006-10-17 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref> [[National Football League]] [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|safety]] [[Ronnie Lott]] had the tip of his little finger removed after it was damaged in the [[1985 NFL season]].

===Legal punishment===
* Amputation is used as a [[physical punishment|legal punishment]] in a number of countries, among them [[Iran]], [[Yemen]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], and Islamic regions of Nigeria.<ref>{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,4565c2252,45d0822f2,478b625016062,0.html |title=UNHCR article on amputation as a punishment in Iran |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=2008-01-07 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>

== Surgical amputation ==

===Method===
[[File:Curvy amputation knife DSC09451.jpg|thumb|200px|Curved knives such as this one were used, in the past, for some kinds of amputations.]]
The first step is [[ligature (medicine)|ligating]] the supplying [[artery]] and [[vein]], to prevent [[hemorrhage]] (bleeding). The muscles are transected, and finally the [[bone]] is sawed through with an [[oscillating saw]]. Sharp and rough edges of the bone(s) are filed down, skin and muscle flaps are then transposed over the stump, occasionally with the insertion of elements to attach a [[prosthesis]].

== Traumatic amputation ==
Traumatic amputation is the partial or total avulsion of a part of a body during a serious accident, like traffic, labor, or combat.<ref>Current Surgical Diagnosis and Treatment: "Amputations", editions Lange, USA, 2009</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">Harry Gouvas: "Accidents and Massive Disasters", editions of Greek Red Cross, 2000</ref><ref>Neil Watson: "Hand Injuries and Infections" Cower Medical Publishing, London, New York, 1996, ISBN 0-906923-80-8</ref>

Traumatic amputation of a human limb, either partial or total, creates the immediate danger of death from blood loss.<ref name="ReferenceB">Harry Gouvas: "Accidents and massive Disasters", Editions of Greek Red Cross, 2000</ref>

===Causes===
[[File:3372709503 10dc75d783 oSéquelleAmputation.jpg|thumb|170px|Private Lewis Francis was wounded July 21, 1861, at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] by a bayonet to the knee.]]
Traumatic amputation is rare in humans (1 per 20 804 population per year). Loss of limb usually happens immediately during the accident, but some times a few days later after medical complications. Statistically the most common causes of traumatic amputations are:<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
* Amputations in traffic accidents (cars, motorcycles, bicycles, trains, etc.)
* Amputations in labor accidents (equipments, instruments, cylinders, chain saws, press machines, meat machines, wood machines, etc.)
* Amputations in agricultural accidents, with machines and mower equipments.
* Amputations from electric shock hazard
* Amputations from guns, weapons, and explosives, dynamite, bombs, fireworks, etc.
* Amputations from violent rupture of ship rope or industry wire rope.
* Amputations from ring traction (ring amputation, de-gloving injuries)
* Amputations from building doors and car doors.
* Amputations from other rare accidents.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Treatment===
On the base of last evolution of the science of [[microsurgery]] in last 40 years, a Traumatic amputation can be confronted with these choices, depending from patient's trauma and clinical situation:
* 1st choice: Surgical amputation - break - prosthesis
* 2nd choice: Surgical amputation - transplantation of other tissue - plastic reconstruction.
* 3rd choice: [[Replantation]] - reconnection - revascularisation of amputated limb, by microscope (after 1969)
* 4th choice: Transplantation of cadaveric hand (after year 2000),<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>Neil Watson: "Hand Injuries and Infections"Cower Medical Publishing,ISBN 0-906923-80-8</ref>

===Epidemiology===
* In the [[United States]], in 1999 there were 14,420 non-fatal traumatic amputations according to the [[American Statistical Association]]. Of these, 4,435 occurred as a result of traffic and transportation accidents, and 9,985 were due to labor accidents. Of all traumatic amputations, the distribution percentage is 30.75% for traffic accidents, and 69.24% for labor accidents.<ref name="amstat.org">[http://www.amstat.org/ American Statistical Association: Amputations in USA, 2000]</ref>
* The population of USA in 1999 was about 300,000,000, so, the conclusion is that there is one amputation per year per 20,804 persons. In the group of labor amputations, 53% occurred in laborers and technicians, 30% in production and service workers, 16% in silviculture and fishery workers.<ref name="amstat.org"/>
* A study found that in 2010, 22.8% of patients undergoing amputation of a lower extremity in the United States were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days.<ref> Weiss AJ, Elixhauser A, Steiner C. ''Readmissions to U.S. Hospitals by Procedure, 2010.'' HCUP Statistical Brief #154. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. April 2013. [http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb154.jsp]</ref>

==Prevention==
Amputations are usually traumatic experiences. They can reduce the quality of life for patients in addition to being expensive. In the USA, a typical prosthetic limb costs in the range of $10,000–15,000 according to the American Diabetic Association. In some populations, preventing amputations is a critical task. 

Methods in preventing amputation depend on the problems that might cause amputations to be necessary. Chronic infections, often caused by diabetes or decubitus ulcers in bedridden patients, are common causes of infections that lead to gangrene, which would then necessitate amputation. 

There are two key challenges: first, many patients have impaired circulation in their extremities, and second, they have difficulty curing infections in limbs with poor vasculation (blood circulation).
 
Crush injuries where there is extensive tissue damage and poor circulation also benefit from [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] (HBOT). The high level of oxygenation and revascularization speed up recovery times and prevent infections.

A study found that the patented method called Circulator Boot achieved significant results in prevention of amputation in patients with diabetes and arterioscleorosis.<ref name=dillon1>{{cite journal |journal= Angiology |date= May 1997 |volume= 48 |issue= 5 (part 2) |title= Fifteen Years of Experience in Treating 2177 Episodes of Foot and Leg Lessions with the Circulator Boot |author= Richard S.

For victims of trauma, advances in [[microsurgery]] in the 1970s have made replantations of severed body parts possible.

The establishment of laws, rules and guidelines, and employment of modern equipment help protect people from traumatic amputations.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

==Prognosis==
The individual may experience psychological trauma and emotional discomfort. The stump will remain an area of reduced mechanical stability. Limb loss can present significant or even drastic practical limitations.

A large proportion of amputees (50–80%) experience the phenomenon of [[phantom limb]]s;<ref>{{cite journal | month = January | year = 2005 | title = Phantom Input | author = Heidi Schultz | title = The Science of Things | journal = National Geographic Magazine |url=http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0501/resources_who.html }} {{Dead link|date=November 2009}}</ref> they feel body parts that are no longer there. These limbs can itch, ache, burn, feel tense, dry or wet, locked in or trapped or they can feel as if they are moving. Some scientists believe it has to do with a kind of neural map that the brain has of the body, which sends information to the rest of the brain about limbs regardless of their existence. Phantom sensations and phantom pain may also occur after the removal of body parts other than the limbs, e.g. after amputation of the breast, extraction of a tooth (phantom tooth pain) or removal of an eye ([[phantom eye syndrome]]).

A similar phenomenon is unexplained sensation in a body part unrelated to the amputated limb. It has been hypothesized that the portion of the brain responsible for processing stimulation from amputated limbs, being deprived of input, expands into the surrounding brain, (Phantoms in the Brain: V. S. Ramachandran and Sandra Blakeslee) such that an individual who has had an arm amputated will experience unexplained pressure or movement on his face or head{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

In many cases, the phantom limb aids in adaptation to a prosthesis, as it permits the person to experience [[proprioception]] of the prosthetic limb. To support improved resistance or usability, comfort or healing, some type of [[stump sock]]s may be worn instead of or as part of wearing a prosthesis.

Another side effect can be [[heterotopic ossification]], especially when a bone injury is combined with a head injury. The brain signals the bone to grow instead of scar tissue to form, and nodules and other growth can interfere with prosthetics and sometimes require further operations. This type of injury has been especially common among soldiers wounded by [[improvised explosive device]]s in the [[Iraq war]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/26/MNSOLDIERS26.DTL | title=War without end / Damaged soldiers start their agonizing recoveries | first=Joan | last=Ryan | date=March 25, 2006 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKeplkmD |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Due to technologic advances in prosthetics, many amputees live active lives with little restriction. Organizations such as the [[Challenged Athletes Foundation]] have been developed to give amputees the opportunity to be involved in athletics and [[adaptive sports]] such as [[Team Zaryen|Amputee Soccer]].

==History==
The word amputation is derived from the [[Latin]] ''amputare'', "to cut away", from ''ambi-'' ("about", "around") and ''putare'' ("to prune"). The Latin word has never been recorded in a surgical context, being reserved to indicate punishment for criminals. The English word "amputation" was first applied to surgery in the 17th century, possibly first in Peter Lowe's ''A discourse of the Whole Art of Chirurgerie'' (published in either 1597 or 1612); his work was derived from 16th-century French texts and early English writers also used the words "extirpation" (16th-century French texts tended to use ''extirper''), "[[disarticulation]]", and "[[dismemberment]]" (from the Old French ''desmembrer'' and a more common term before the 17th century for limb loss or removal), or simply "cutting", but by the end of the 17th century "amputation" had come to dominate as the accepted medical term.
