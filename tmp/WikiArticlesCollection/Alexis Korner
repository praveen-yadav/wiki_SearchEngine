'''Alexis Korner''' (19 April 1928 – 1 January 1984) was a [[blues]] musician and radio broadcaster, who has sometimes been referred to as "a founding father of [[British Blues]]".<ref>{{Google books|iDE0dH6ZLwUC|Then, now and rare British beat 1960–1969 by Terry Rawlings|page=115}}</ref> A major influence on the sound of the British music scene in the 1960s,<ref>[http://radiorewind.co.uk/alexis_korner_page.htm  "Korner, a pioneer and influential musician" retrieved 26 August 2007]</ref> Korner was instrumental in bringing together various English blues musicians.

==Early career==
'''Alexis Andrew Nicholas Koerner''' was born in Paris to an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Jew]]ish father and a half-[[Turkish people|Turkish]] half-[[Greeks|Greek]] mother.<ref>{{cite web |author=iTunes|title=Alexis Korner Biography|url=http://itunes.apple.com/gb/artist/alexis-korner/id3194103|accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Rolling Stone|title=Fricke's Picks: Free, Bluesman Alexis Korner, "Scandinavia Action Jazz"|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/alternate-take/frickes-picks-free-bluesman-alexis-korner-scandinavia-action-jazz-20061117|accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref> He spent his childhood in France, Switzerland and North Africa and arrived in London in 1940 at the start of [[World War II]]. One memory of his youth was listening to a record by black pianist [[Jimmy Yancey]] during a German [[Strategic bombing|air raid]]. Korner said, "From then on all I wanted to do was play the blues."<ref name="tsxbpf">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p412/biography|pure_url=yes}} Bio at Allmusic.com]</ref>

After the war, Korner played piano and guitar (his first guitar was built by friend and author Sydney Hopkins, who wrote ''[[Mister God, This Is Anna]]'') and in 1949 joined [[Chris Barber]]'s Jazz Band<ref>[[John Pidgeon (Writer, radio producer)|John Pidgeon]]'s Rock'sbackpagesblog: http://www.rocksbackpagesblogs.com/2009/09/chris-barber-father-of-british-rb/</ref> where he met blues harmonica player [[Cyril Davies]]. They started playing together as a duo, started the influential London Blues and Barrelhouse Club in 1955 and made their first record together in 1957. Korner made his first official record on [[Decca Records]] DFE 6286 in the company of [[Ken Colyer]]'s [[Skiffle]] Group. His talent extended to playing [[mandolin]] on one of the tracks of this rare British [[Extended play|EP]], recorded in London on 28 July 1955. Korner brought many American blues artists, previously virtually unknown in Britain, to perform.<ref>{{Google books|4y-oDmH2YzYC|The Beatles, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by Allan F. Moore|page=9}}</ref>

==The 1960s==
{{Main|Blues Incorporated}}
In 1961, Korner and Davies formed [[Blues Incorporated]],<ref>[[John Pidgeon (Writer, radio producer)|John Pidgeon]]'s Rock'sbackpages blog: http://www.rocksbackpagesblogs.com/2009/09/blues-incorporated-how-british-rb-trashed-trad</ref> initially a loose-knit group of musicians with a shared love of [[electric blues]] and [[R&B]] music. The group included, at various times, such influential musicians as [[Charlie Watts]], [[Jack Bruce]], [[Ginger Baker]], [[Long John Baldry]], [[Graham Bond]], [[Danny Thompson]] and [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]]. It also attracted a wider crowd of mostly younger fans, some of whom occasionally performed with the group, including [[Mick Jagger]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Brian Jones]], [[Geoff Bradford (musician)|Geoff Bradford]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[John Mayall]] and [[Jimmy Page]].<ref name=Shapiro1997>{{cite book|last = Shapiro |first = Harry  |title = Alexis Korner: The Biography |year =1997|isbn = 0-7475-3163-3}}</ref>

One story is that [[the Rolling Stones]] went to stay at Korner's house late one night, in the early 1960s, after a performance. They entered in the accepted way, by climbing in through the kitchen window, to find [[Muddy Waters]]' band sleeping on the kitchen floor. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Although Cyril Davies left the group in late-1962, Blues Incorporated continued to record, with Korner at the helm, until 1966. However, by that time its originally stellar line-up (and crowd of followers) had mostly left to start their own bands. "While his one-time acolytes the Rolling Stones and [[Cream (band)|Cream]] made the front pages of music magazines all over the world, Korner was relegated to the role of 'elder statesman'."<ref name = "tsxbpf"/>

Although he himself was a blues purist, Korner criticised better-known British blues musicians during the blues boom of the late 1960s for their blind adherence to [[Chicago blues]], as if the music came in no other form. He liked to surround himself with [[jazz]] musicians and often performed with a [[horn section]] drawn from a pool that included, among others, saxophone players [[Art Themen]], [[Mel Collins]], [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]], [[Lol Coxhill]],<ref>[http://reocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palladium/9932/chodg_s.htm "COLIN HODGKINSON sessions"retrieved 29 August 2011]</ref> [[Dick Morrissey]], [[John Surman]] and [[trombonist]] [[Mike Zwerin]].

== Broadcasting ==

In the 1960s Korner began a media career, working initially as a show business interviewer and then on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''Five O'Clock Club'', a children's TV show. Korner also wrote about blues for the music papers, and continued to maintain his own career as a blues artist, especially in Europe.

On 17 October 1967, Korner interviewed [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]] for the [[BBC]] radio show''[[Top Gear (radio show)|Top Gear]]''. Some of these tracks, including audio of Korner himself, appear on the Hendrix double-CD ''[[BBC Sessions (The Jimi Hendrix Experience album)|BBC Sessions]]'', including Korner playing slide guitar on "[[(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man]]".

While touring [[Scandinavia]] he first joined forces with guitarist and singer [[Peter Thorup]], together forming the band New Church, who were one of the support bands at the [[Stones in the Park|Rolling Stones Free Concert]] in [[Hyde Park, London]], on 5 July 1969. [[Jimmy Page]] reportedly found out about a new singer, [[Robert Plant]], who had been jamming with Korner, who wondered why Plant had not yet been discovered. Plant and Korner were in the process of recording a full album with Plant on vocals until Page had asked him to join "the New [[Yardbirds]]", aka [[Led Zeppelin]]. Only two songs are in circulation from these recordings: "Steal Away" and "Operator".<ref name="Shapiro1997"/> Alexis Korner gave one of his last radio interviews to BBC Midlands on the ''Record Collectors Show'' with Mike Adams and the Late Chris Savory.

===1970s===
{{Main|C. C. S. (pop group)}}
[[Image:Alexis Korner 1968 Bremen.jpg|thumb|160px|Korner and [[Peter Thorup]] in [[Bremen]]]]
In 1970 Korner and Thorup formed a big-band ensemble, [[C. C. S. (pop group)|C.C.S.]] – short for "The Collective Consciousness Society" – which had several hit singles produced by [[Mickie Most]], including a version of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Whole Lotta Love]]", which was used as the theme for BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' between 1971 and 1981. Another instrumental called "Brother" was used as the theme to the [[BBC Radio 1]] Top 20/40 when [[Tom Browne (broadcaster and actor)|Tom Browne]]/[[Simon Bates]] presented the programme in the 1970s. It was also used in the 1990s on Radio Luxembourg for the Top 20 Singles chart and was hosted by [[Shaun Tilley]].  This was the period of Korner's greatest commercial success in the UK.<ref name="Shapiro1997"/>

===1970s to 1984===
[[Image:Alexis Korner musician.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Korner with Snape]]
In 1973, he formed another group, Snape, with [[Boz Burrell]], [[Mel Collins]], and [[Ian Wallace (drummer)|Ian Wallace]], who were previously together in [[King Crimson]]. Korner also played on [[B.B. King]]'s ''In London'' album, and cut his own, similar "supersession" album; ''Get Off My Cloud'', with [[Keith Richards]], [[Peter Frampton]], [[Nicky Hopkins]] and members of [[Joe Cocker]]'s [[The Grease Band|Grease Band]]. In the mid-1970s, while touring Germany, Korner established an intensive working relationship with bassist [[Colin Hodgkinson]] who played for the support act [[Back Door (jazz trio)|Back Door]]. They would continue to collaborate right up until Korner's death.<ref name="Shapiro1997"/>

In the 1970s Korner's main career was in broadcasting. In 1973 he presented a unique 6-part documentary on [[BBC Radio 1]], ''The Rolling Stones Story'',<ref name = "ibndjr">[http://radiorewind.co.uk/alexis_korner_page.htm Radiorewind.co.uk –  retrieved 26 August 2007]</ref> and in 1977 he established a Sunday-night blues and soul show on Radio 1, ''Alexis Korner's Blues and Soul Show'', which ran until 1981. He also used his gravelly voice to great effect as an advertising voice-over artist. In 1978, for Korner's 50th birthday, an all-star concert was held featuring many of his above-mentioned friends, as well as [[Eric Clapton]], [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]], [[Chris Farlowe]], [[Zoot Money]] and others, which was later released as ''[[The Party Album (Alexis Korner album)|The Party Album]]'', and as a video.

In 1981, Korner joined another "supergroup", [[Rocket 88 (band)|Rocket 88]], a project led by [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] based on [[boogie-woogie]] keyboard players, which featured a [[rhythm section]] comprising [[Jack Bruce]] and [[Charlie Watts]], among others, as well as a [[horn section]]. They toured Europe and released an album on [[Atlantic Records]]. He played in Italy with [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]] and the Blues Society of Italian bluesman Guido Toffoletti.
