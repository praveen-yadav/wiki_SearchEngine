'''Canes Venatici''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|n|iː|z|_|v|ɨ|ˈ|n|æ|t|ɨ|s|aɪ}} is one of the 88 official modern [[constellation]]s.  It is a small northern constellation that was created by [[Johannes Hevelius]] in the 17th century. Its name is [[Latin]] for "[[hunting dog]]s", and the constellation is often depicted in illustrations as representing the dogs of [[Boötes]] the Herdsman, a neighboring constellation.

==History==

The stars of Canes Venatici are not bright. In classical times, they were included by [[Ptolemy]] within the constellation [[Ursa Major]] in his [[star catalogue]].  α CVn was Ptolemy's "28th of Ursa Major", and β CVn was his "29th of Ursa Major".{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In the [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], the identification of these stars with the dogs of Boötes arose through a mistranslation.  Some of Boötes' stars were traditionally described as representing the [[Club (weapon)|club]] ([[Greek language|Greek]], Κολλοροβος) of Boötes. When the Greek astronomer Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' was translated from Greek to [[Arabic]], the translator [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq|Johannitius]] (following [[Al Biruni|Alberuni]]) did not know the Greek word and rendered it as the nearest-looking Arabic word, writing العصى ذات الكلاب in ordinary unvowelled Arabic text "''al-`aşā dhāt al-kullāb''", which means "the spearshaft having a hook". When the Arabic text was translated into [[Latin]], the translator [[Gerard of Cremona]] (probably in Spain) mistook the Arabic word كلاب for ''kilāb'' (the plural of  كلب ''kalb''), meaning "dogs", writing ''hastile habens canes'' ("spearshaft having dogs").<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1963|p=105}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Kunitzsch|1959|pp=123–124}}</ref>
<br /><ref>{{Harvnb|Kunitzsch|1974|pp=227–228}}</ref>
<br /><ref>{{Harvnb|Kunitzsch|1990|pp=48–49}}</ref>
In 1533, the German astronomer [[Peter Apian]] depicted Boötes as having two dogs with him.<ref name=apian1>{{Harvnb|Apianus|1533}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1963|p=157}}</ref>

[[Image:Canes Venatici.gif|left|200px|thumb|Canes Venatici depicted in Hevelius' star atlas.]]

These spurious dogs floated about the astronomical literature until [[Johannes Hevelius|Hevelius]] decided to specify their presence in the sky by making them a separate constellation in 1687.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/canesvenatici.htm |work = Star Tales |title = Canes Venatici |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |accessdate = 9 June 2012}}</ref><ref name="ridpath">{{Harvnb|Ridpath|2001|pp=96–97}}</ref> Hevelius chose the name ''Asterion'' (from the Greek 'αστέριον, meaning the "little star",<ref>{{Harvnb|Kunitzsch|Smart|2006|p=22}}</ref> the [[diminutive]] of 'αστηρ the "star", or adjective meaning "starry"<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1963|p=115}}</ref>) for the northern dog and ''Chara'' (from the Greek χαρά, meaning "joy") for the southern dog, as ''Canes Venatici'', the Hunting Dogs, in his [[star atlas]].<ref name="ridpath"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Hevelius|1690}}</ref>
In his star catalogue, the Czech astronomer [[Antonín Bečvář|Becvar]] assigned ''Asterion'' to β CVn and ''Chara'' to α CVn.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bečvář|1951}}</ref>

Canes Venatici contains no bright stars, α and β CVn being only of 3rd and 4th [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] respectively.

*'''[[Alpha Canum Venaticorum|α CVn]] (Asterion, Cor Caroli)''' is the constellation's brightest [[star]], named by Sir [[Charles Scarborough]] in memory of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], the deposed king of Britain.<ref name="ridpath"/><ref>According to R. H. Allen (''Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning''), the star was named by Halley for Charles II "at the suggestion of the court physician Sir Charles Scarborough, who said it had shone with special brilliance on the eve of the king's return to London, May 29, 1660". According to Deborah J. Warner (''The Sky Explored: Celestial Cartography 1500-1800''), it was originally named "Cor Caroli Regis Martyris" ("The Heart of King Charles the Martyr") for Charles I. According to Robert Burnham, Jr. (''Burnham's Celestial Handbook'', Volume 1), "the attribution of the name to Halley appears in a report published by [[Johann Elert Bode|J. E. Bode]] at Berlin in 1801, but seems to have no other verification".</ref> Legend has it that α CVn was brighter than usual during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], as [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] returned to England to take the throne. Cor Caroli is a wide [[double star]], with a primary of magnitude 2.9 and a secondary of magnitude 5.6; the primary is 110 light-years from Earth. The primary also has an unusually strong variable magnetic field.<ref name="ridpath"/> 

*'''[[Beta Canum Venaticorum|β CVn]] (Chara)''' is a yellow-hued [[main sequence star]] of magnitude 4.2, 27 light-years from Earth. Its common name comes from the word for "joy".<ref name="ridpath"/>

*'''[[Y Canum Venaticorum|Y CVn]] (La Superba)''' is a [[semiregular variable star]] that varies between magnitudes 5.0 and 6.5 over a period of around 158 days.  It is a [[carbon star]] and is famous for being deep red.<ref name="ridpath"/>

*'''[[AM Canum Venaticorum|AM CVn]]''', a very blue star of magnitude 14, is the prototype of a special class of [[cataclysmic variable star]]s, in which the companion star is a [[white dwarf]], rather than a [[main sequence star]]. 

*'''[[RS Canum Venaticorum|RS CVn]]''' is the prototype of a [[RS Canum Venaticorum variable|special class of binary stars]]<ref>{{cite web |url = http://simbad3.u-strasbg.fr/sim-id.pl?protocol=html&Ident=RS+CVn |publisher = SIMBAD  |title = RS CVn -- Variable of RS CVn type |accessdate = 9 June 2012}}</ref> of [[chromosphere|chromospherically]] active and optically [[variable star|variable]] components.

Canes Venatici contains five [[Messier object]]s, including four [[galaxy|galaxies]]. One of the more significant galaxies in Canes Venatici is the [[Whirlpool Galaxy]] (M51, NGC 5194) and [[NGC 5195]], a small barred [[spiral galaxy]] that is seen face on. This was the first galaxy recognised as having a spiral structure, this structure being first observed by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]] in 1845.<ref name="ridpath"/> It is a face-on spiral galaxy 37 million light-years from Earth. Widely considered to be one of the most beautiful galaxies visible, M51 has many [[star formation|star-forming regions]] and [[nebula]]e in its arms, coloring them pink and blue in contrast to the older yellow core. M51 has a smaller companion, [[NGC 5195]], that has very few star-forming regions and thus appears yellow. It is passing behind M51 and may be the cause of the larger galaxy's prodigious star formation.<ref name="objects">{{Harvnb|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}</ref>

[[File:NGC 4631 HST.jpg|thumb|[[NGC 4631]] taken by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]
Other notable spiral galaxies in Canes Venatici are the [[Sunflower Galaxy]] (M63, NGC 5055), [[Messier 94|M94]] (NGC 4736), and [[Messier 106|M106]] (NGC 4258). M63, the Sunflower Galaxy, was named for its appearance in large amateur telescopes. It is a spiral galaxy with an integrated magnitude of 9.0. M94 is a small face-on spiral galaxy with an approximate magnitude of 8.0, about 15 million light-years from Earth.<ref name="ridpath"/> [[NGC 4631]] is a barred spiral galaxy, which is one of the largest and brightest edge-on galaxies in the sky.<ref>O'Meara, Stephen James: The Caldwell Objects, Sky Publishing Corporation ISBN 0-933346-97-2 page 126</ref>

[[Messier 3|M3]] (NGC 5272) is a [[globular cluster]] 32,000 light-years from Earth.  It is 18' in diameter, and at magnitude 6.3 is bright enough to be seen with [[binoculars]]. It can even be seen with the naked eye under particularly dark skies.<ref name="ridpath"/>

M94, also classified as NGC 4736, is a face-on spiral galaxy 15 million light-years from Earth. It has very tight spiral arms and a bright core. The outskirts of the galaxy are incredibly luminous in the [[ultraviolet]] because of a ring of [[star formation|new stars]] surrounding the core, 7,000 light-years in diameter. Though astronomers are not sure what has caused this ring of new stars, some hypothesize that it is from shock waves caused by a [[barred spiral galaxy|bar]] that is thus far invisible.<ref name="objects"/>
