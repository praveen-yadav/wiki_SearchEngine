A '''cave''' or '''cavern''' is a natural underground space large enough for a human to enter. Caves form naturally by the [[weathering]] of rock and often extend deep underground. The word "cave" can also refer to much smaller openings such as [[sea cave]]s, [[rock shelter]]s, and [[grotto]]s.

[[Speleology]] is the science of exploration and study of all aspects of caves and the environment that surrounds the caves. Exploring a cave for recreation or science may be called ''[[caving]]'', ''potholing'', or ''spelunking''.

==Types and formation==
The formation and development of caves is known as ''[[speleogenesis]]''. Caves are formed by various geologic processes and can be variable sizes. These may involve a combination of chemical processes, erosion from water, tectonic forces, microorganisms, pressure, and atmospheric influences.

It is estimated that the maximum depth of the cave can not be more than {{convert|3000|m}} due to the pressure of overlying rocks.<ref>authors И. Кудрявцева, Д. Люри. name Geography. publishing house Аванта+. year 1994. volume 3. page 472. isbn 5-86529-015-0</ref> For [[karst]] caves the maximum depth is determined on the basis of the lower limit of [[karst]] forming processes, coinciding with the base of the soluble carbonate rocks.<ref>[http://www.rgo-speleo.ru/books/termin/termin1.htm#a9 Комиссия спелеологии и карстоведения.

Most caves are formed in [[limestone]] by [[Solvation|dissolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/earth/how-caves-form.html|publisher=[[Nova (TV series)]]|title=How Caves Form|accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref>

===Solutional cave===
{{Main|Solutional cave}}
'''Solutional caves''' are the most frequently occurring caves and such caves form in rock that is soluble, such as [[limestone]], but can also form in other rocks, including [[chalk]], [[dolomite]], marble, salt, and [[gypsum]]. Rock is dissolved by natural acid in groundwater that seeps through [[Bed (geology)|bedding-planes]], [[Geological fault|faults]], joints and so on. Over geological epochs cracks expand to become caves and cave systems.

The largest and most abundant solutional caves are located in limestone. Limestone dissolves under the action of rainwater and groundwater charged with H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> ([[carbonic acid]]) and naturally occurring [[organic acid]]s. The dissolution process produces a distinctive landform known as ''[[karst]]'', characterized by [[sinkhole]]s, and underground drainage. Limestone caves are often adorned with [[calcium carbonate]] formations produced through slow precipitation. These include [[flowstone]]s, [[stalactite]]s, [[stalagmite]]s, [[helictite]]s, [[soda straw]]s and columns. These secondary mineral deposits in caves are called ''[[speleothem]]s''.

The portions of a solutional cave that are below the [[water table]] or the local level of the groundwater will be flooded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazingcaves.com/learn_formed.html |title=Learning about caves; how caves are formed |accessdate=September 8, 2009 |author=John Burcham |work=Journey into amazing caves |publisher=Project Underground}}</ref>

[[Lechuguilla Cave]] in [[New Mexico]] and nearby [[Carlsbad Cavern]] are now believed to be examples of another type of solutional cave. They were formed by H<sub>2</sub>S ([[hydrogen sulfide]]) gas rising from below, where reservoirs of oil give off sulfurous fumes. This gas mixes with ground water and forms H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> ([[sulfuric acid]]). The acid then dissolves the limestone from below, rather than from above, by acidic water percolating from the surface.

===Primary cave===
<!--{{main|Primary cave}}-->
[[File:hawaiian lava tube.jpg|thumb|300px|Exploring a [[lava tube]] in [[Hawaii]].]]
Some caves are formed at the same time as the surrounding rock. These are  called '''primary caves'''.

[[Lava tube]]s are formed through [[volcanic]] activity and are the most common 'primary' caves. The [[lava]] flows downhill and the surface cools and solidifies. The hotter lava continues to flow under that crust, and if most of the liquid lava beneath the crust flows out, a hollow tube remains, thus forming a cavity. Examples of such caves can be found on the [[Canary Islands]], [[Jeju Province|Jeju-do]] and other places. [[Kazumura Cave]] near [[Hilo]], [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]] is a remarkably long and deep lava tube; it is {{convert|65.6|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}}.

Lava caves include but are not limited to lava tubes. Other caves formed through volcanic activity include rift caves, lava mold caves, open vertical volcanic conduits, and inflationary caves.

===Sea cave or littoral cave===
{{Main|Sea cave}}
[[File:Painted cave.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Painted Cave, a large [[sea cave]], [[Santa Cruz Island]], [[California]]]]
Sea caves are found along coasts around the world. A special case is littoral caves, which are formed by wave action in zones of weakness in sea cliffs. Often these weaknesses are faults, but they may also be dykes or bedding-plane contacts. Some wave-cut caves are now above sea level because of later uplift. Elsewhere, in places such as Thailand's [[Phang Nga Bay]], solutional caves have been flooded by the sea and are now subject to littoral erosion. Sea caves are generally around {{convert|5|to|50|m|sp=en}} in length, but may exceed {{convert|300|m|sp=en}}.

===Corrasional cave or erosional cave===
Corrasional or erosional caves are those that form entirely by erosion by flowing streams carrying rocks and other sediments. These can form in any type of rock, including hard rocks such as granite. Generally there must be some zone of weakness to guide the water, such as a fault or joint. A subtype of the erosional cave is the wind or aeolian cave, carved by wind-born sediments. Many caves formed initially by solutional processes often undergo a subsequent phase of erosional or vadose enlargement where active streams or rivers pass through them.

===Glacier cave===
{{Main|Glacier cave}}
[[File:Big Four Glacier Ice cave.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[Glacier cave]] in Big Four Glacier, [[Big Four Mountain]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[circa|ca.]] 1920]]
Glacier caves occur in ice and under glaciers. They are formed by melting. They are also influenced by the very slow flow of the ice, which tends to close the caves again. (These are sometimes called ''[[ice cave]]s'', though this term is properly reserved for caves that contain year-round ice formations).

===Fracture cave===
Fracture caves are formed when layers of more soluble minerals, such as gypsum, dissolve out from between layers of less soluble rock. These rocks fracture and collapse in blocks of stone.

===Talus cave===
Talus caves are the openings between rocks that have fallen down into a pile, often at the bases of cliffs (called "[[Scree|talus]]").

===Anchialine cave===
{{Main|Anchialine cave}}
Anchialine caves are caves, usually coastal, containing a mixture of freshwater and saline water (usually sea water). They occur in many parts of the world, and often contain highly specialized and endemic fauna.

==Physical patterns==
*''Branchwork caves'' resemble surface dendritic stream patterns; they are made up of passages that join downstream as tributaries. Branchwork caves are the most common of cave patterns and are formed near [[sinkhole]]s where [[groundwater recharge]] occurs. Each passage or branch is fed by a separate recharge source and converges into other higher order branches downstream.<ref name=Easterbrook>Easterbrook, Don, 1999, ''Surface Processes and Landforms [2nd edition]'', New Jersey, Prentice Hall, p. 207</ref>
*''Angular Network caves'' form from intersecting fissures of carbonate rock that have had fractures widened by chemical erosion. These fractures form high, narrow, straight passages that persist in widespread closed loops.<ref name=Easterbrook />
*''Anastomotic caves'' largely resemble surface braided streams with their passages separating and then meeting further down drainage. They usually form along one bed or structure, and only rarely cross into upper or lower beds.<ref name=Easterbrook />
*''Spongework caves'' are formed when solution cavities are joined by mixing of chemically diverse water. The cavities form a pattern that is three-dimensional and random, resembling a sponge.<ref name=Easterbrook />
*''Ramiform caves'' form as irregular large rooms, galleries, and passages. These randomized three-dimensional rooms form from a rising water table that erodes the carbonate rock with hydrogen-sulfide enriched water.<ref name=Easterbrook />
*''[[Pit cave]]s'' (vertical caves, potholes, or simply "pits") consist of a vertical shaft rather than a horizontal cave passage. They may or may not be associated with one of the above structural patterns.

==Geographic distribution==
[[Image:Domica Cave 22.jpg|thumb|[[Domica|Domica Cave]] in [[Slovak Karst]] ([[Slovakia]])]]
Caves are found throughout the world, but only a portion of them have been explored and documented by cavers. The distribution of documented cave systems is widely skewed toward countries where caving has been popular for many years (such as France, Italy, Australia, the UK, the United States, and so on.). As a result, explored caves are found widely in Europe, Asia, North America and Oceania, but are sparse in South America, Africa, and Antarctica. This is a great generalization, as large expanses of North America and Asia contain no documented caves, whereas areas such as the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]] and parts of Brazil contain many documented caves. As the world's expanses of soluble bedrock are researched by cavers, the distribution of documented caves is likely to shift. For example, China, despite containing around half the world's exposed limestone—more than {{convert|1000000|km2|sp=en}}—has relatively few documented caves.

==Records and superlatives==
*The cave system with the '''greatest total length''' of surveyed passage is [[Mammoth Cave National Park|Mammoth Cave]] ([[Kentucky]], United States) at {{convert|628|km|abbr=on}} in length. This record is unlikely to be surpassed in the near future, as the next most extensive known cave is [[Jewel Cave]] near [[Custer, South Dakota]], at {{convert|257|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name="NSS-GEO2">[http://www.caverbob.com/wlong.htm World’s Longest Caves List from The National Speleological Society]</ref>

*The longest surveyed '''underwater cave''' is [[Sistema Ox Bel Ha]] in [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]], Mexico at {{convert|242|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name="NSS-GEO2" /> The record has been exchanged several times with [[Sistema Sac Actun]], currently at {{convert|220|km|abbr=on}}.

*The '''deepest known cave''' (measured from its highest entrance to its lowest point) is [[Voronya Cave]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], with a depth of {{convert|2,191|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.caverbob.com/wdeep.htm World's Deepest Caves List from The National Speleological Society]</ref> This was the first cave to be explored to a depth of more than {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}}. (The first cave to be descended below {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} was the famous [[Gouffre Berger]] in France.) The [[Illyuzia-Mezhonnogo-Snezhnaya]] cave in Georgia, ({{convert|1753|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and the [[Lamprechtsofen Vogelschacht]] Weg Schacht in Austria ({{convert|1,632|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are the current second- and third-deepest caves, respectively.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

*The '''deepest vertical shaft''' in a cave is {{convert|603|m|abbr=on}} in [[Vrtoglavica Cave]] in [[Slovenia]]. The second deepest is [[Velebit caves|Patkov Gušt]] at {{convert|553|m|abbr=on}} in the [[Velebit]] mountain, [[Croatia]].

*The '''largest room''' ever discovered is the [[Sarawak Chamber]], in the [[Gunung Mulu National Park]] ([[Miri]], [[Sarawak]], [[Borneo]], [[Malaysia]]), a sloping, boulder strewn chamber with an area of approximately {{Gconvert|700|by|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a height of {{convert|80|m|abbr=on}}. The nearby [[Clearwater Cave System]] is believed to be the world's largest cave by volume, with a calculated volume of {{convert|30347540|m3|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

*The '''largest passage''' ever discovered is in the [[Son Doong Cave]] in [[Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park]] in [[Quảng Bình Province]], [[Vietnam]]. Explored by joint Vietnamese-British cave scientists of the [[British Cave Research Association]], it is {{convert|4.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length, {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and wide over most of its length, but over {{convert|140|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and wide for part of its length.<ref>{{cite web

==Ecology==
[[File:townsends in music hall.jpg|thumb|[[Townsend's big-eared bat]]s in a cave in California]]
[[File:Proteus anguinus Postojnska Jama Slovenija.jpg|thumb|Blind cave salamanders in a Slovenian cave]]
Cave-inhabiting animals are often categorized as [[troglobite]]s (cave-limited species), [[troglophile]]s (species that can live their entire lives in caves, but also occur in other environments), [[trogloxene]]s (species that use caves, but cannot complete their life cycle fully in caves) and accidentals (animals not in one of the previous categories). Some authors use separate terminology for aquatic forms (for example, [[stygobite]]s, [[stygophile]]s, and [[stygoxene]]s).

Of these animals, the troglobites are perhaps the most unusual organisms. Troglobitic species often show a number of characteristics, termed troglomorphic, associated with their adaptation to subterranean life. These characteristics may include a loss of pigment (often resulting in a pale or white coloration), a loss of eyes (or at least of optical functionality), an elongation of appendages, and an enhancement of other senses (such as the ability to sense vibrations in water). Aquatic troglobites (or stygobites), such as the endangered [[Alabama cave shrimp]], live in bodies of water found in caves and get nutrients from detritus washed into their caves and from the feces of bats and other cave inhabitants. Other aquatic troglobites include [[cave fish]], and [[cave salamander]]s such as the [[olm]] and the [[Texas blind salamander]].

[[Cave insects]] such as Oligaphorura (formerly Archaphorura) schoetti are troglophiles, reaching {{convert|1.7|mm|sp=en}} in length. They have extensive distribution and have been studied fairly widely. Most specimens are female, but a male specimen was collected from [[St Cuthberts Swallet]] in 1969.

[[Bat]]s, such as the [[gray bat]] and [[Mexican free-tailed bat]], are trogloxenes and are often found in caves; they forage outside of the caves. Some species of [[cave cricket]]s are classified as trogloxenes, because they roost in caves by day and forage above ground at night.

Because of the fragile nature of the cave ecosystem, and the fact that cave regions tend to be isolated from one another, caves harbor a number of endangered species, such as the [[Tooth cave spider]], [[Liphistiidae|liphistius trapdoor spider]], and the gray bat.

Caves are visited by many surface-living animals, including humans. These are usually relatively short-lived incursions, due to the lack of light and sustenance.

Cave entrances often have typical florae. For instance, in the eastern temperate United States, cave entrances are most frequently (and often densely) populated by the bulblet fern, ''[[Cystopteris bulbifera]]''.

==Archaeological and cultural importance==
[[File:taino.jpg|thumb|[[Taíno people|Taíno]] [[petroglyph]]s in a cave in Puerto Rico]]
Throughout history, primitive peoples have made use of caves for shelter, burial, or as religious sites. Among the known sacred caves are China's [[Cave of a Thousand Buddhas]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Olsen|first=Brad|title=Sacred Places Around the World: 108 Destinations|year=2004|publisher=CCC Publishing|isbn=9781888729160|page=16|url=http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=7FS40w2nrqQC&pg=PA16&dq=sacred+caves&hl=en&sa=X&ei=L3g-UuDmDKijiAfJjoHQCQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=sacred%20caves&f=false}}</ref> and the [[Sacred caves of Crete]]. Since items placed in caves are protected from the climate and scavenging animals, this means caves are an archaeological treasure house for learning about these people. [[Cave painting]]s are of particular interest. One example is the [[Niah Caves|Great Cave of Niah]], in Malaysia, which contains evidence of human habitation dating back 40,000 years.<ref>''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''.
