The '''Colonna family''' is an [[Italian nobility|Italian noble]] family; it was powerful in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] [[Rome]], supplying one [[Pope]] and many other [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] and political leaders. Their family is notable for their bitter feud with the [[Orsini family]] over influence in Rome until it was stopped by [[Papal Bull]] in 1511; in 1571 the Chiefs of both families married nieces of [[Pope Sixtus V]]. Thereafter, historians recorded that, ''"no peace had been concluded between the princes of Christendom, in which they had not been included by name"''.

==Family history==

=== Early history ===

According to tradition, the Colonna are a branch of the [[Counts of Tusculum]] — by Peter (1099–1151) son of [[Gregory III, Count of Tusculum|Gregory III]], called Peter "de Columna" from his property, the Columna Castle, in Colonna, Alban Hills.

The first [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] from the family was appointed in 1206 when [[Giovanni Colonna di Carbognano]] was made [[Cardinal Deacon]] of SS. Cosma e Damiano.<ref>Werner Maleczek, ''Papst und Kardinalskolleg von 1191 bis 1216'', Vienna 1984, p. 154-155</ref> For many years, cardinal [[Giovanni di San Paolo]] (elevated in 1193) was identified as member of the Colonna family and therefore its first representative in the [[College of Cardinals]], but modern scholars have established that this was based on the false information from the beginning of 16th century.<ref>Helene Tillmann, "Ricerche sull'origine dei membri del collegio cardenalizio nel XII secolo. II/2. Identificazione dei cardinali del secolo XII di provenienza Romana", Rivista di Storia della Chiesa in Italia, 1975, p. 401-402</ref>

Giovanni Colonna (1206 c.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=AIFCN2Smn9cC&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q&f=false  Accessed 2-24-2013</ref>- ), nephew of Cardinal Giovanni Colonna di Carbognano, made his solemn vows as a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] c. 1228  and received his theological and philosophical training at the Roman ''studium'' of [[Santa Sabina]], the forerunner of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum]].  He served as the Provincial of the Roman province of the [[Dominican Order]] and led the provincial chapter of 1248 at Anagni.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=bM6wwPZorcAC&pg=PA267#v=onepage&q&f=false  Accessed 2-25-2013</ref>  Colonna was appointed as Archbishop of [[Messina]] in 1255.<ref>Fra Giovanni Colonna By Antonio N. Di Stefano, 1995, 30-31, http://books.google.com/books?id=AIFCN2Smn9cC&pg=PA31#v=onepage&q&f=false Accessed 2-24-2013</ref>

At this time a rivalry began with the pro-papal Orsini family, leaders of the Guelph faction. This reinforced the pro-Emperor Ghibelline course that the Colonna family followed throughout the period of conflict between the Papacy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

In 1297, Cardinal Jacopo ([[Giacomo Colonna]]) disinherited his brothers Ottone, Matteo, and Landolfo of their lands. The latter three appealed to [[Pope Boniface VIII]] who ordered Jacopo to return the land, and furthermore hand over the family's strongholds of Colonna, [[Palestrina]], and other towns to the [[Papacy]]. Jacopo refused; in May, Boniface removed him from the [[College of Cardinals]] and excommunicated him and his followers for four generations.

The Colonna family (aside from the three brothers allied with the Pope) declared that Boniface had been elected illegally following the unprecedented [[papal abdication|abdication]] of [[Pope Celestine V]] three years previously. The dispute lead to open warfare, and in September Boniface appointed Landolfo to the command of his army, to put down the revolt of Landolfo's own Colonna relatives. This he did, and by the end of 1298 [[Colonna]], [[Palestrina]], and other towns had been captured and razed to the ground. The family's lands were distributed among Landolfo and his loyal brothers; the rest of the family fled Italy.

Family enmity with Pope Boniface VIII led to destruction of the fortress at Palestrina and to the seizure of the Pope at [[Anagni]] by [[Sciarra Colonna]] in 1303. Sciarra, apparently, smacked the Pope publicly in his face.  It was he who, in old age, crowned [[Louis IV of Bavaria]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1328. In honor of this event, the Colonna family was granted the privilege of using the imperial pointed crown on top of their coat of arms.

The family remained at the centre of civic and religious life throughout the late Middle Ages. In 1248, after having dedicated her entire life to serving God and the poor, Margherita Colonna died. A member of the Franciscan Order, she was beatified by Pope [[Pius IX]] in 1848.

=== From the 14th century ===

In the 14th century, the family sponsored the decoration of the Church of [[San Giovanni]]{{dn|date=October 2013}}, most notably the floor mosaics.  In 1314, Cardinal [[Egidio Colonna]] died at [[Avignon]], now in [[France]], where the Popes had withdrawn. An Augustinian, he had studied theology in Paris under St. [[Thomas of Aquinas]] to become one of the most authoritative thinkers of his time, and tutor to French king [[Philip IV the Fair]], (1268 - 29 November 1314).  The celebrated poet [[Petrarch]], was a great friend of the family, in particular of [[Giovanni Colonna (cardinal)|Giovanni Colonna]] and often lived in Rome as a guest of the family. He composed a number of sonnets for special occasions within the Colonna family, including "Colonna the Glorious, the great Latin name upon which all our hopes rest". In this period, the Colonna started claiming they were descendants of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] (similar spurious claims are common among the old Roman nobility, the [[Massimo (family)|Massimo]] case probably being the best known).

[[Vittoria Colonna]] became famous in the sixteenth century as a poet and a figure in literate circles.

In 1627 [[Anna Colonna]], daughter of [[Filippo I Colonna]], married [[Taddeo Barberini]] of the family [[Barberini]]; nephew of [[Pope Urban VIII]].

In 1728, the Carbognano branch (Colonna di Sciarra) of the Colonna family added the name [[Barberini]] to its family name<ref>[http://worldroots.com/foundation/families/taddeobarberinidesc.htm Worldroots - Barberini]</ref> when Giulio Cesare Colonna di Sciarra married Cornelia Barberini, daughter of the last male Barberini to hold the name and granddaughter of [[Maffeo Barberini (1631-1685)|Maffeo Barberini]] (son of [[Taddeo Barberini]]).

=== Later history ===

The Colonna family have been [[Prince Assistants to the Papal Throne]]<ref>[http://www.chivalricorders.org/vatican/pplcourt.htm Article by Guy de Stair Sainty on Papal Court]</ref> since 1710, though their papal princely title only dates from 1854.

The family residence in Rome, the [[Palazzo Colonna]], is open to the public every Saturday morning.

The main 'Colonna di Paliano' family is represented today by Prince Marcantonio Colonna di Paliano, Prince and Duke of Paliano (b. 1948), whose heir is Don Giovanni Andrea Colonna di Paliano (b. 1975), and by Don Prospero Colonna di Paliano, Prince of Avella (b. 1956), whose heir is Don Filippo Colonna di Paliano (b. 1995).

The 'Colonna di Stigliano' line is represented by Don Prospero Colonna di Stigliano, Prince of Stigliano (b. 1938), whose heir is his nephew Don Stefano Colonna di Stigliano (b. 1975).<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/gotha/colonna.html Theroff's Gotha, with references to current, legitimate members of the princely family<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
