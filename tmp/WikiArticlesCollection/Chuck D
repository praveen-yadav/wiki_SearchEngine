Chuck D made a rare appearance at the [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]], presenting the [[Video Vanguard Award]] to the [[Beastie Boys]], whilst commending their musicianship. In November 1998, he [[settlement (law)|settled out of court]] with Christopher "[[The Notorious B.I.G.]]" Wallace's estate over the latter's [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] of his voice in the song "Ten Crack Commandments". The specific sampling is Ridenhour counting off the numbers one to nine on the track "Shut 'Em Down".<ref>{{cite web|last=Reiss |first=Randy |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/504067/chuck-d-settles-big-copyright-suit.jhtml |title=Public Enemy's Chuck D Settles B.I.G. Copyright Suit |publisher=MTV |date=November 17, 1998 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref>

In September 1999, he launched a multi-format "supersite" on the web site [http://www.rapstation.com Rapstation.com]. A home for the vast global hip hop community, the site boasts a TV and radio station with original programming, many of hip hop's most prominent DJs, celebrity interviews, free [[MP3]] downloads (the first was contributed by multi-platinum rapper [[Coolio]]), downloadable [[ringtone]]s by [[ToneThis]], social commentary, current events, and regular features on turning rap careers into a viable living.  Since 2000, he has been one of the most vocal supporters of [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] in the music industry.

He loaned his voice to ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' as DJ Forth Right MC for the radio station [[Playback FM]].  In 2000, he collaborated with Public Enemy's Gary G-Whiz and MC Lyte on the theme music to the television show ''[[Dark Angel (TV series)|Dark Angel]]''.

In 2009, Ridenhour wrote the foreword to the book ''The Love Ethic: The Reason Why You Can't Find and Keep Beautiful Black Love'' by Kamau and Akilah Butler.  He also appeared on [[Brother Ali]]'s album, ''[[Us (Brother Ali album)|Us]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Williams, Kam |title=The Love Ethic |url=http://www.kamwilliams.com/2009/06/by-kamau-and-akilah-butler-foreword-by.html|date=June 30, 2009 |publisher=KamWilliams.com |accessdate=June 30, 2009}}</ref>

In March 2011, Chuck D re-recorded vocals with [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]] for a cover of "[[Fight the Power]]".

Chuck D duetted with Rock singer [[Meat Loaf]] on his 2011 album ''[[Hell in a Handbasket]]'' on the song "Mad Mad World/The Good God Is a Woman and She Don't Like Ugly".

== Rapping technique and creative process ==
Chuck D is known for his powerful [[rapping]] voice - ''How to Rap'' says, “Chuck D of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] has a powerful, resonant voice that is often acclaimed as one of the most distinct and impressive in [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]]”.<ref name="autogenerated248">Edwards, p. 248.</ref> Chuck D says this was based on listening to [[Melle Mel]] and sportscasters such as Marv Albert.<ref name="autogenerated248"/>

Chuck D often comes up with a title for a song first<ref>Edwards, p. 31.</ref><ref>Coleman, Brian. ''[[Check the Technique: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies]]''. New York: Villard/Random House, 2007, ISBN 978-0-8129-7775-2. p. 360.</ref> and that he writes on paper, though he sometimes edits using a computer.<ref>Edwards, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZemzPXFgeEoC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA143#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 143.]</ref> He also prefers to not [[Punch in/out|punch in]] vocals,<ref>Edwards, p. 280.</ref> and he prefers to not [[overdub]] vocals.<ref>Edwards, p. 282.</ref>

== Politics ==
Ridenhour is politically active; he co-hosted ''[[Unfiltered]]'' on [[Air America Radio]], testified before [[United States Congress|Congress]] in support of [[peer-to-peer]] MP3 sharing, and was involved in a 2004 rap political convention.  He continues to be an [[activism|activist]], publisher, lecturer, and producer. Addressing the negative views associated with rap music, he co-wrote the essay book ''Fight the Power: Rap, Race, and Reality'', along with Yusuf Jah. He argues that "music and art and culture is escapism, and escapism sometimes is healthy for people to get away from reality", but sometimes the distinction is blurred and that's when "things could lead a young mind in a direction."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/04648327/chuck_d_the_d_is_for_dangerous.html |title=Chuck D: The D is for Dangerous |publisher=Crave Online |date=August 6, 2007 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref> He also founded the record company Slam Jamz and acted as narrator in Kareem Adouard's short film ''Bling: Consequences and Repercussions'', which examines the role of [[conflict diamonds]] in [[bling]] fashion. Despite Chuck D and Public Enemy's success, Chuck D claims that popularity or public approval was never a driving motivation behind their work. He is admittedly skeptical of celebrity status, revealing in a 1999 interview with [[BOMB Magazine]] that, "The key for the record companies is to just keep making more and more stars, and make the ones who actually challenge our way of life irrelevant. The creation of celebrity has clouded the minds of most people in America, Europe and Asia. It gets people off the path they need to be on as individuals." <ref>Thorpe, David. [http://bombsite.com/issues/68/articles/2251 "Chuck D"], ‘’[[BOMB Magazine]]’’ Summer, 1999. Retrieved on June 13, 2012</ref>

In an interview with ''[[Le Monde]]'' published January 29, 2008,<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2008/01/29/chuck-d-le-rap-sans-strass_1004960_3246.html#ens_id=1005052 LeMonde.fr : Chuck D Le rap sans strass]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> Chuck D stated that rap is devolving so much into a commercial enterprise, that the relationship between the rapper and the record label is that of slave to a master.  He believes that nothing has changed for African-Americans since the debut of Public Enemy and, although he thinks that an Obama-Clinton alliance is great, he does not feel that the establishment will allow anything of substance to be accomplished. He also stated that French President Sarkozy is like any other European elite: he has profited through the murder, rape, and pillaging of those less fortunate and he refuses to allow equal opportunity for those men and women from Africa.  In this article, he also defended a comment made by [[Professor Griff]] in the past that he says was taken out of context by the media.  The real statement was a critique of the Israeli government and its treatment of the Palestinian people.  Chuck D stated that it is Public Enemy's belief that all human beings are equal.

In an interview with the magazine ''N'Digo'' published in late June 2008, he spoke of today's mainstream urban music seemingly relishing the addictive euphoria of materialism and sexism, perhaps being the primary cause of many people harboring resentment towards the genre and its future. However he has expressed hope for its resurrection, saying "It’s only going to be dead if it doesn’t talk about the messages of life as much as the messages of death and non-movement", citing artists such as [[NYOil]], [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]] and the [[The Roots]] as socially conscious artists who push the envelope creatively. "A lot of cats are out there doing it, on the Web and all over. They’re just not placing their career in the hands of some major corporation."<ref>Muhammad, Cinque. "[http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:1jc28ghXquEJ:www.ndigo.com/coverstory.asp+Chuck+D+N'DIGO&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=uk Hip-Hop Conspiracy? Critics charge conscious rap is silenced.]" ''N'Digo Online''. June 26 - July 2, 2008. Retrieved July 5, 2008.</ref>

Most recently Chuck D became involved in ''Let Freedom Sing: The Music of the Civil Rights'', a 3-CD box set from Time Life.  He wrote the introduction to the liner notes and is visiting colleges across the nation discussing the significance of the set.  He's also set to appear in a follow up movie called ''Let Freedom Sing:  The Music That Inspired the Civil Rights Movement''.

In 2010, Chuck D released a track entitled "Tear Down That Wall". He said, “I talked about the wall not only just dividing the U.S. and Mexico but the states of California, New Mexico and Texas. But Arizona, it's like, come on. Now they're going to enforce a law that talks about basically racial profiling.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957694/chuck-d-takes-aim-at-arizona-public-enemy-in-the-studio |title=Chuck D Takes Aim at Arizona; Public Enemy In the Studio |publisher=Billboard.com |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2012-05-08}}</ref>
