The '''Council of the European Union''' (sometimes just called the '''Council''' and sometimes still referred to as the '''Council of Ministers''') is the third of the seven [[institutions of the European Union]] (EU) as listed in the [[Treaty on European Union]].<ref>http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF</ref> It is part of the essentially [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature of the European Union|EU legislature]], representing the [[executive (government)|executives]] of [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]], the other legislative body being the [[European Parliament]].<ref name="Legislative power"/> The Council is composed of several configurations of twenty-eight [[Minister (government)|national ministers]] (one per [[Member state of the European Union|state]]). The exact membership of the configuration depends upon the topic; for example, when discussing [[Common Agricultural Policy|agricultural policy]] the Council is formed by the twenty-eight national ministers whose portfolio includes this policy area (with the related [[European Commissioner]] contributing but not voting).

The [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency]] of the Council rotates every six months among the governments of EU member states, with the relevant ministers of the respective country holding the Presidency at any given time ensuring the smooth running of the meetings and setting the daily agenda.<ref name="Consilium - Council"/> The continuity between presidencies is provided by an arrangement under which three successive presidencies, known as ''Presidency trios'', share common political programmes. The [[Foreign Affairs Council]] (national foreign ministers) is however chaired by the Union's [[High Representative]].<ref name="Const Info">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The Union's institutions: The Council of Ministers|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/council_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-01}}</ref> The Council is administered by the [[Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union|Council's Secretary General]].

Its decisions are made by [[qualified majority voting]] in most areas, unanimity in others. Usually where it operates unanimously, it need only consult the Parliament. However, in most areas the [[ordinary legislative procedure]] applies meaning both Council and Parliament share legislative and budgetary powers equally, meaning both have to agree for a proposal to pass. In a few limited areas the Council may initiate new [[European Union law|EU law]] itself.<ref name="Consilium - Council">{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = Council of the European Union|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?lang=EN|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Politics of the European Union}}
{{Further|History of the European Union}}
The Council first appeared in the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) as the "Special Council of Ministers", set up to counterbalance the High Authority (the supranational executive, now the Commission). The original Council had limited powers as issues relating only to coal and steel were in the Authority's domain, whereas the Council only had to give its consent to decisions outside coal and steel. As a whole, it only scrutinised the [[High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community|High Authority]] (the executive). In 1957, the [[Treaties of Rome]] established two new communities, and with them two new Councils: the Council of the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (EAEC) and the Council of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC). However due to objections over the supranational power of the Authority, their Councils had more powers with the new executive bodies being known as "Commissions".<ref name="ENA history">{{cite web|publisher = [[European NAvigator]]|title = Council of the European Union|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=5604|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref>

In 1965 the Council was hit by the "empty chair crisis". Due to disagreements between [[French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] and the Commission's agriculture proposals, among other things, France boycotted all meetings of the Council bringing work to a halt until it was resolved the following year by the [[Luxembourg compromise]]. Although initiated by a gamble of then-President of the Commission, [[Walter Hallstein]], who lost the Presidency after the crisis, it exposed flaws in the Council's workings.<ref name="LSE Chair">{{cite web|last=Ludlow|first=N|year=2006|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|title = De-commissioning the Empty Chair Crisis : the Community institutions and the crisis of 1965–6|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2422/01/Decommisioningempty.pdf|accessdate = 2007-09-24|format=PDF|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071025203706/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2422/01/Decommisioningempty.pdf |archivedate = 25 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

With the [[Merger Treaty]] of 1967, the ECSC's Special Council of Ministers and the Council of the EAEC (together with their other independent institutions) were merged into the Council of the EEC which would act as a single Council of the [[European Communities]]. In 1993, the Council adopted the name 'Council of the European Union', following the establishment of the European Union by the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. That treaty strengthened the Council with the addition of more intergovernmental elements in the [[Three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] system. However, at the same time the Parliament and Commission had been strengthened inside the [[European Community|Community pillar]] curbing the ability of the Council to act independently.<ref name="ENA history"/>

The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] abolished the pillar system and gave further powers to Parliament. It also merged the Council's [[High Representative]] with the [[European Commissioner for External Relations|Commission's foreign policy head]], with this new figure chairing the foreign affairs Council rather than the rotating presidency. The [[European Council]] was declared a separate institution from the Council, also chaired by a permanent president, and the different Council configurations were mentioned in the treaties for the first time.<ref name="Const Info"/>

The development of the Council has been characterised by the rise in power of the Parliament, with which the Council has had to share its legislative powers. The Parliament has often provided opposition to the Council's wishes. This has in some cases led to clashes between the two bodies with the Council's system of intergovernmentalism contradicting the developing parliamentary system and supranational principles.<ref name="Hoskyns">{{cite book| last = Hoskyns | first = Catherine | coauthors = Michael Newman | title = Democratizing the European Union: Issues for the twenty-first Century (Perspectives on Democratization | publisher = [[Manchester University Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-7190-5666-6 }}</ref>

== Powers and functions ==
The primary purpose of the Council is to act as one of the two chambers of the [[Legislature of the European Union|EU's legislative branch]], the other chamber being the [[European Parliament]]. It also holds, jointly with the Parliament, the budgetary power of the Union and has greater control than the Parliament over the more intergovernmental areas of the EU, such as foreign policy and macroeconnomic co-ordination. Finally, before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, it formally held the executive power of the EU which it conferred upon the [[European Commission]].<ref name="Treaty">{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Treaty on the European Union (Nice consolidated version)|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf|accessdate = 2007-06-24|format=PDF}}</ref>{{Request quotation|date=January 2010}}<ref name="Legislative power">{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|title=Legislative power|url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&pageRank=2&language=EN|accessdate = 2007-07-11}}</ref>{{Request quotation|date=January 2010}}

=== Legislative procedure ===
{{Main|European Union legislative procedure}}
[[File:Ordinary legislative procedure majorityrules.svg|thumb|300px|Simplified illustration of the voting rules that apply within the ordinary legislative procedure. The actual procedure involves various stages of consultations aimed at achieving compromise between the positions of the two legislative chambers.]]
The EU's legislative authority is divided between the Council and the Parliament. As the relationships and powers of these institutions have developed, various legislative procedures have been created for adopting laws.<ref name="Legislative power"/> The vast majority of laws are now subject to the [[ordinary legislative procedure]], which works on the principle that consent from both the Council and Parliament are required before a law may be adopted.<ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = The Codecision Procedure|url=http://ec.europa.eu/codecision/procedure/index_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-07-11}}</ref>

Under this procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council. Following its first [[Reading (legislature)|reading]] the Parliament may propose amendments. If the Council accepts these amendments then the legislation is approved. If it does not then it adopts a "common position" and submits that new version to the Parliament. At its second reading, if the Parliament approves the text or does not act, the text is adopted, otherwise the Parliament may propose further amendments to the Council's proposal. It may be rejected out right by an [[absolute majority]] of MEPs. If the Council still does not approve the Parliament's position, then the text is taken to a "Conciliation Committee" composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs. If a Committee manages to adopt a joint text, it then has to be approved in a third reading by both the Council and Parliament or the proposal is abandoned.<ref name="Parliament's powers">{{cite web|title=Codecision procedure|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&pageRank=4&language=EN|accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref>

The few other areas that operate the ''special legislative procedures'' are justice & home affairs, budget and taxation and certain aspects of other policy areas: such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy. In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone.<ref name="lisbon explain"/><ref name="decision making">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Decision-making in the European Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://www.europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref> The procedure used also depends upon which type of [[European Union law#Legislation|institutional act]] is being used. The strongest act is a [[Regulation (European Union)|regulation]], an [[Act of Parliament|act]] or [[Statutory law|law]] which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are [[Directive (European Union)|directives]] which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve, but they do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A [[European Union decision|decision]] is an instrument which is focused at a particular person or group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue [[European Union recommendation|recommendations and opinions]] which are merely non-binding declarations.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Community legal instruments|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/community_legal_instruments_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>

The Council votes in one of three ways; [[unanimity]], [[Majority|simple majority]], or [[qualified majority]]. In most cases, the Council votes on issues by [[Voting in the Council of the European Union|qualified majority voting]], meaning that there must be a minimum of 255 votes out of 345 (73.9%) and a majority of member states (sometimes a two–third majority). A majority representing 62% of the EU's population may also be taken into account.<ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = The decision making triangle|url=http://europa.eu/abc/12lessons/lesson_4/index_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref> Unanimity is nearly always used where foreign policy is concerned, and in a number of cases under police and judicial co-operation.<ref>{{cite web|publisher = 2005 UK Presidency website|title = Council of the European Union |url=http://www.eu2005.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1109176488805|accessdate = 2007-10-14}}</ref>

=== Foreign affairs ===
The legal instruments used by the Council for the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] are different from the legislative acts. Under the CFSP they consist of "common positions", "joint actions", and "common strategies". Common positions relate to defining a European foreign policy towards a particular third-country such as the promotion of human rights and democracy in [[Burma]], a region such as the stabilisation efforts in the [[African Great Lakes]], or a certain issue such as support for the [[International Criminal Court]]. A common position, once agreed, is binding on all EU states who must follow and defend the policy, which is regularly revised. A joint action refers to a co-ordinated action of the states to deploy resources to achieve an objective, for example for mine clearing or to combat the spread of [[small arms]]. Common strategies defined an objective and commits the EUs resources to that task for four years.<ref name="FR instru">{{cite web|publisher = [[French Foreign Ministry]]|title=Joint actions, common positions and common strategies|url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/european-union_157/eu-in-the-world_1491/common-foreign-and-security-policy_5463/operation-of-the-cfsp_5467/cfsp-decision-making-processes-and-instruments_5473/joint-actions-common-positions-and-common-strategies_8752.html|accessdate = 2007-10-14}}</ref>

=== Budgetary authority ===
Furthermore, the legislative branch officially holds the Union's budgetary authority. The [[Budget of the European Union|EU's budget]] (which is around 116.4 billion [[euro]])<ref name="budget glance">{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Where fors the money come from?|url=http://ec.europa.eu/budget/budget_glance/where_from_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-10-14}}</ref> is subject to a form of the ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving Parliament power over the entire budget (prior to 2009, its influence was limited to certain areas) on an equal footing to the Council. If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. But if the joint conciliation text is not approved, the Parliament may adopt the budget definitively.<ref name="lisbon explain">{{cite web|title = Explaining the Treaty of Lisbon|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/09/531|accessdate = 2009-12-04 }}</ref> In addition to the budget, the Council coordinates the economic policy of members.<ref name="Consilium - Council"/>

== Organisation ==
=== Presidency ===
{{Main|Presidency of the Council of the European Union}}
The Presidency of the Council is not a single post, but is held by a member state's government. Every six months the presidency rotates between the states, in an order predefined by the Council's members, allowing each state to preside over the body. From 2007, every three-member states co-operate for their combined eighteen months on a common agenda, although only one formally holds the presidency for the normal six-month period. For example the President for the second half of 2007, Portugal, was the second in a trio of states alongside Germany and [[Slovenia]] with whom Portugal had been co-operating. The Council meets in various configurations (as outlined below) so its membership changes depending upon the issue. The person chairing the Council will always be the member from the state holding the Presidency. A delegate from the following Presidency also assists the presiding member and may take over work if requested.<ref name="Pres DE">{{cite web|publisher = 2007 German Presidency website|title = What is the Presidency?|url=http://www.eu2007.de/en/The_Council_Presidency/What_is_the_Presidency/index.html|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref><ref name="Pres PT">{{cite web|publisher = 2007 Portuguese Presidency website|title = The Presidency|url=http://www.eu2007.pt/UE/vEN/Presidencia_Conselho/A_Presidencia/default_.htm|accessdate = 2007-10-14|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071020220019/http://www.eu2007.pt/UE/vEN/Presidencia_Conselho/A_Presidencia/default_.htm |archivedate = 20 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The exception however is the foreign affairs council, which has been chaired by the [[High Representative]] since the entry into force of the [[Lisbon Treaty]].<ref name="Const Info"/>

The role of the Presidency is administrative and political. On the administrative side it is responsible for procedures and organising the work of the Council during its term. This includes summoning the Council for meetings along with directing the work of COREPER and other committees and working groups. The political element is the role of successfully dealing with issues and mediating in the Council. In particular this includes setting the agenda of the council, hence giving the Presidency substantial influence in the work of the Council during its term. The Presidency also plays a major role in representing the Council within the EU and representing the EU internationally, for example at the United Nations.<ref name="Pres PT"/><ref name="Pres FI">{{cite web|publisher = 2007 Finnish Presidency website|title = The presidency in general|url=http://www.eu2006.fi/the_presidency/en_GB/the_presidency_in_general/|accessdate = 2007-10-14|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061003140815/http://www.eu2006.fi/the_presidency/en_GB/the_presidency_in_general/ |archivedate = 3 October 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Council Decision of 15 September 2006 adopting the Council's Rules of Procedure |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:285:0047:0048:EN:PDF|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-11-26}}</ref>

=== Configurations ===
Legally speaking, the Council is a single entity, but it is in practice divided into several different council configurations (or ‘(con)formations’). Article 16(6) of the [[Treaty on European Union]] provides:
{{quote|The Council shall meet in different configurations, the list of which shall be adopted in accordance with Article 236 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

The General Affairs Council shall ensure consistency in the work of the different Council configurations. It shall prepare and ensure the follow-up to meetings of the European Council, in liaison with the President of the European Council and the Commission.

The Foreign Affairs Council shall elaborate the Union's external action on the basis of strategic guidelines laid down by the European Council and ensure that the Union's action is consistent.}}

Each council configuration deals with a different functional area, for example agriculture and fisheries. In this formation, the council is composed of ministers from each state government who are responsible for this area: the agriculture and fisheries ministers. The [[Chair (official)|chair]] of this council is held by the member from the state holding the presidency (see section above). Similarly, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council is composed of national finance ministers, and they are still one per state and the chair is held by the member coming from the presiding country. The Councils meet irregularly throughout the year except for the three major configurations (top three below) which meet once a month. There are currently ten formations:<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = Council configurations|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=427&lang=en&mode=g|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref><ref name="Council Booklet">{{cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Information handbook of the Council of the European Union|publisher=Office of Official Publications of the European Communities|year=2007|location =Brussels|pages=|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=978-92-824-2203-8}}</ref>
* '''[[General Affairs Council|General Affairs]] (GAC):''' General affairs co-ordinates the work of the Council, prepares for [[European Council]] meetings and deals with issues crossing various council formations.
* '''[[Foreign Affairs Council|Foreign Affairs]] (FAC):''' Chaired by the [[High Representative]], rather than the Presidency, it manages the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP]], [[Common Security and Defence Policy|CSDP]], trade and development co-operation.

* '''Justice and Home Affairs Council (JHA):''' This configuration brings together Justice ministers and Interior Ministers of the Member States. Includes civil protection.
* '''Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO):''' Composed of employment, social protection, consumer protection, health and equal opportunities ministers.
* '''Competitiveness (COCOM):''' Created in June 2002 through the merging of three previous configurations (Internal Market, Industry and Research). Depending on the items on the agenda, this formation is composed of ministers responsible for areas such as European affairs, industry, tourism and scientific research. With the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the EU acquired competence in space matters,<ref>Art.4 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF</ref> and space policy has been attributed to the Competitiveness Council<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consilium.europa.eu/showpage.aspx?id=412&lang=en |title=CONSILIUM – Page redirection |publisher=Consilium.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}</ref>

* '''Environment (ENVI):''' Composed of environment ministers, who meet about four times a year.
* '''Education, Youth, Culture and Sport (EYC):''' Composed of education, culture, youth, communications and sport ministers, who meet around three or four times a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consilium.europa.eu/showpage.aspx?id=416&lang=en |title=CONSILIUM – Page redirection |publisher=Consilium.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}</ref> Includes audiovisual issues.

Complementing these, the Political and Security Committee (PSC) brings together ambassadors to monitor international situations and define policies within the CSDP, particularly in crises.<ref name="Council Booklet"/> The [[European Council]] is similar to a configuration of the Council, it operates in a similar way and but is composed of the national leaders ([[head of government|heads of government]] [[head of state|or state]]) and has its own President,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.european-council.europa.eu/the-institution.aspx?lang=EN |title=European Council – The institution |publisher=European-council.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}</ref> currently [[Herman Van Rompuy]].

The [[General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union|General Secretariat of the Council]] provides the continuous infrastructure of the council, carrying out preparation for meetings, draft reports, translation, records, documents, agendas and assisting the presidency.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = FAQ: General Secretariat of the Council|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/faqHomePage.Asp?command=details&node=19&lang=en&cmsId=1|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref> The [[Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union|Secretary General of the Council]] is head of the General Secretariat, Uwe Corsepius since June 2011; previously the post holder was also the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]],<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = Javier Solana|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_applications/applications/solana/index.asp?lang=EN&cmsid=246|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref> President of the [[European Defence Agency]]<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Defence Agency]]|title = European Defence Agency|url=http://www.eda.europa.eu/|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref> and the [[Western European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher = Western European Union|title = Western European Union|url=http://www.weu.int/index.html|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref>

The [[Committee of Permanent Representatives]] (COREPER) is a body composed of representatives from the states (ambassadors, civil servants etc.) who meet each week to prepare the work and tasks of the Council. It monitors and co-ordinates work and deals with the Parliament on co-decision legislation (along with leading the non–EU defence organisation, the [[Western European Union]]).<ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Glossary|url=http://ec.europa.eu/codecision/stepbystep/glossary_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref> It is divided into two groups of the representatives (Coreper II) and their deputies (Coreper I). Agriculture is dealt with separately by the Special Committee on Agriculture (SCA). The numerous working groups submit their reports to the Council through Coreper or SCA.<ref name="Council Booklet"/>

=== Voting system ===
{{Further|Voting in the Council of the European Union}}
The Council is composed of national ministers for the relevant topic of discussion, with each minister representing their national government. The currently effective [[qualified majority voting]] rules are defined in the [[Treaty of Nice]].<ref name=NiceTreaty>{{cite web|title=Treaty of Nice|work=Amending the Treaty on the European Union, the Treaties establishing the European Communities and certain Related Acts|publisher=Official Journal of the European Communities|date=10 March 2001|url =http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/12001C/pdf/12001C_EN.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> Accordingly, for a proposal to pass, the supporting side needs to surpass three criteria:
# 50% (if proposal was made by the [[European Commission|Commission]]) or 67% (all other cases) of the members states,
# 74% of the voting weights,
# 62% of the EU population (this criterion is only checked upon request by a Council member).
The following table is ranked for the power the member states exert on Council decisions, and lists their population figures (criterion three) and voting weights (criterion two) along with their ruling parties and affiliations to European parties.<ref name="Consilium - Council"/>

{{Map - Party affiliations in the European Council}}
The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] mandates a change in voting system from 1 November 2014 for most cases to double majority [[Qualified Majority Voting]], replacing the voting weights system. Decisions made by the council have to be taken by 55% of member states representing at least 65% of the EU's population.<ref name="Const Info"/>

Almost all members of the Council are members of a political party at national level, and most of these are members of a [[European political party|European-level political party]]. However the Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties<ref name="Consilium - Council"/> and the nature of coalition governments in a number of states means that individual configurations would vary on which domestic party was assigned the portfolio. However the broad ideological alignment of each state does have a bearing on the nature of the law the Council produces and the extent to which the link between domestic parties puts pressure on the members in the European Parliament to vote a certain way.

== Comparisons ==
{{Further|Institutions of the European Union#Comparisons}}
[[File:Bundesrat Chamber.jpg|thumb|left|The Council and the German Bundesrat, are both composed by representatives of the states governments]]
Although common in executive intergovernmental systems, as a legislature the Council has few institutions of comparison. The composition of the council can only be compared with the quite unique and unusual composition of the German upper house, the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]. Membership of the Bundesrat is limited to members of the governments of the [[states of Germany]] and can be recalled by those governments in the same manner as the EU's Council. They retain their state role while sitting in the Bundesrat and if their term ends when they are recalled by their state governments (who are solely responsible for their appointment) or they cease to sit in their state government. Elections are not coordinated among states, so government can come and go at any time, and the assembly can not be dissolved. Those members vote in their state blocks and can not cast fractioned votes, hence they do not act as individual members but as representatives of their state governments to that government's agreed line.<ref name="Bundesrat Memb">{{cite web|title = Organisation: Bundesrat members|publisher=Bundesrat|url=http://www.bundesrat.de/nn_11006/EN/organisation-en/mitglieder-en/mitglieder-en-inhalt.html?__nnn=true|accessdate = 2008-10-07}}</ref> The states have unequal voting powers, and decisions are taken by an absolute majority. Likewise, the presidency rotates equally between members, though each year rather than every six months like in the EU Council.<ref name="Bundesrat Pres">{{cite web|title = Organisation: The Presidency|publisher=Bundesrat|url=http://www.bundesrat.de/cln_099/nn_11400/EN/organisation-en/praesident-en/praesident-en-node.html?__nnn=true|accessdate = 2008-10-15}}</ref> However, unlike the EU's Council, the Bundesrat does not formally vary its composition depending on the topic being discussed, though in practice, the leading spokesman for each Land does vary according to the subject matter.<ref name="Bundesrat Memb"/>

== Seat ==
{{Further|Location of European Union institutions|Justus Lipsius building}}

By a decision of the European Council at Edinburgh in December 1992, the Council has its seat in Brussels but in April, June, and October, it holds its meetings in Luxembourg.<ref>{{cite web|last = European Council|title = European Council in Edinburgh: 11–12 December 1992, Annex 6 to Part A| date=12 December 1992|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/summits/edinburgh/a6_en.pdf|accessdate = 2007-06-24|format=PDF}}</ref> Between 1952 and 1967 the ECSC Council held its Luxembourg meetings in the Cercle Municipal on Place d’Armes. Its secretariat moved on numerous occasions but between 1955 and 1967 it was housed in the Verlorenkost district of the city. In 1957 with the creation of two new Communities with their own Councils, discretion on location was given to the current President. In practice this was to be in the [[Castle of the Valley of the Duchess]] until the autumn of 1958, at which point it moved to 2 Rue Ravensteinstraat in Brussels.<ref name="ENA Council seat">{{cite web|first=|title=Seat of the Council of the European Union|date=|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=5631|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref>

The 1965 agreement (finalised by the Edinburgh agreement and annexed to the treaties) on the location of the newly merged institutions, the Council was to be in Brussels but would meet in Luxembourg during April, June, and October. The ECSC secretariat moved from Luxembourg to the merged body Council secretariat in the Ravenstein building of Brussels. In 1971 the Council and its secretariat moved into the [[Charlemagne building]], next to the Commission's [[Berlaymont]], but the Council rapidly ran out of space and administrative branch of the Secretariat moved to a building at 76 Rue Joseph II/Jozef II-straat and during the 1980s the language divisions moved out into the Nerviens, Frère Orban, and Guimard buildings.<ref name="ENA Council seat"/>

In 1995 the Council moved once more, into the [[Justus Lipsius building]], across the road from Charlemagne. However, its staff was still increasing, so it continued to rent the Frère Orban building to house the Finnish and Swedish language divisions. Staff continued to increase and the Council rented, in addition to owning Justus Lipsius, the Kortenberg, Froissart, Espace Rolin, and Woluwe Heights buildings. Since acquiring the [[Lex building]], the three aforementioned buildings are not used by the Council services any more as of 2008. [[Résidence Palace]]<ref name="ENA Council seat"/> has been acquired and is currently being renovated; it will house the new press centre of the European Council, which uses the same facilities as the Council.<ref>{{cite web|publisher = UIA Architectes|title = Call for Candidatures|year=2004|url=http://www.uia-architectes.org/texte/england/Residence/2residence.html|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref>

When the Council is meeting in Luxembourg, it meets in the Kirchberg Conference Centre<ref name="ENA Council seat"/> and its offices are based at the European Centre on the plateau du Kirchberg.<ref name="Council Booklet"/> The Council has also met occasionally in Strasbourg, in various other cities, and also outside the Union: for example in 1974 when it met in Tokyo  and Washington while trade and energy talks were taking place. Under the Council's present rules of procedures the Council can, in extraordinary circumstances, hold one of its meetings outside Brussels and Luxembourg.<ref name="ENA Council seat"/>

=== Public access ===
Within the Council's debates, delegates may speak in any of the [[Languages of the European Union|24 official EU languages]]. Official documents are also translated into [[Catalan language|Catalan/Valencian]], [[Basque language|Basque]], and [[Galician language|Galician]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = FAQ: Application of the rules governing languages at the Council|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_applications/faqHomePage.Asp?command=details&node=21&lang=en&cmsId=1|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref> Prior to the Lisbon Treaty, only minutes and voting records were made available when the Council is acting as a legislator (published in the ''Official Journal of the European Union'').<ref name="Council Booklet"/> Since then all meetings where the Council is legislating are open to public viewing.<ref name="Const Info"/>
