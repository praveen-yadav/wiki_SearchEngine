The '''Cuba Libre''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|juː|b|ə|_|ˈ|l|iː|b|r|eɪ}}; {{IPA-es|ˈkuβa ˈliβɾe}}, "Free Cuba") is a [[highball]] made of [[cola]], [[Lime (Citrus aurantifolia)|lime]], and [[Light rum|white rum]]. This highball is often referred to as a '''Rum and Coke''' in the [[United States of America|United States]], [[Canada]], the [[UK]], [[Ireland]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] where the lime juice may or may not be included.

==History==
Accounts of the invention of the Cuba Libre vary. One account claims that the drink ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for ''Free [[Cuba]]'') was invented in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] around 1901/1902. Patriots aiding Cuba during the [[Spanish-American War]]—and, later, expatriates avoiding [[Prohibition]]—regularly mixed rum and cola as a highball and a toast to this Caribbean island.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Original BACARDI Cuba Libre Celebrates 110th Anniversary|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100803005466/en/Original-BACARDI-Cuba-Libre-Celebrates-110th-Anniversary|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=24 January 2011|date=3 August 2010}}</ref>

According to [[Bacardi]]:

<blockquote>The world's second most popular drink was born in a collision between the United States and [[Spain]]. It happened during the Spanish-American War at the turn of the century when [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]], the [[Rough Riders]], and [[United States|Americans]] in large numbers arrived in Cuba. One afternoon, a group of off-duty soldiers from the U.S. Signal Corps were gathered in a bar in Old Havana. Fausto Rodriguez, a young messenger, later recalled that Captain Russell came in and ordered Bacardi (Gold) rum and Coca-Cola on ice with a wedge of lime. The captain drank the concoction with such pleasure that it sparked the interest of the soldiers around him. They had the bartender prepare a round of the captain's drink for them. The Bacardi rum and Coke was an instant hit. As it does to this day, the drink united the crowd in a spirit of fun and good fellowship. When they ordered another round, one soldier suggested that they toast ''¡Por Cuba Libre!'' in celebration of the newly freed Cuba. The captain raised his glass and sang out the battle cry that had inspired Cuba's victorious soldiers in the War of Independence.<ref name="cuba-libre">{{cite web|title=Cuba Libre History|url=http://www.havana-club.com/INT/EN/club.html#/467|publisher=Havana Club|accessdate=24 January 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

However, there are some problems with Bacardi's account, as the Spanish-American war was fought in 1898, Cuba's liberation was in 1898, and the Rough Riders left Cuba in September 1898,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rough Riders and Colonel Roosevelt |url=http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/Rough_Riders.htm|publisher=Theodore Roosevelt Association|accessdate=24 January 2011}}</ref> but Coca-Cola was not available in Cuba until 1900.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Chronicle Of Coca-Cola|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/the-chronicle-of-coca-cola-a-man-named-woodruff#TCCC|work=Heritage|publisher=The Coca-Cola Company|accessdate=24 January 2011}}</ref> According to a 1965 deposition by [[Fausto Rodriguez]], the Cuba Libre was first mixed at a Cuban bar in August 1900 by a member of the U.S. Signal Corps, referred to as "[[John Doe]]".<ref name="coulombe">{{cite book

According to [[Havana Club]]:

<blockquote>Along with the [[Mojito]] and the [[Daiquiri]], the Cuba Libre shares the mystery of its exact origin. The only certainty is that this cocktail was first sipped in Cuba. The year? 1900. 1900 is generally said to be the year that cola first came to Cuba, introduced to the island by American troops. But “Cuba Libre!” was the battle cry of the Cuba Liberation Army during the war of independence that ended in 1898.<ref name="cuba-libre"/></blockquote>

==Popularity==
This drink was once viewed as exotic, with its dark syrup, made (at that time) from [[kola nut]]s and [[coca]].

Soon, as [[Charles H. Baker, Jr.]] points out in his ''Gentlemen's Companion'' of 1934, the Cuba Libre "caught on everywhere throughout [[U.S. Southern States|the [American] South]] ... filtered through the North and West," aided by the ample supply of its ingredients. In ''The American Language'', 1921, [[H.L. Mencken]] writes of an early variation of the drink: "The [[caveman|troglodytes]] of western [[South Carolina]] coined 'jump stiddy' for a mixture of Coca-Cola and [[denatured alcohol]] (usually drawn from automobile radiators); connoisseurs reputedly preferred the taste of what had been aged in [[Model-T|Model-T Fords]]."<ref name="coulombe"/>

The drink gained further popularity in the United States after [[The Andrews Sisters]] recorded a song (in 1945) named after the drink's ingredients, "[[Rum and Coca-Cola]]". Cola and rum were both cheap at the time and this also contributed to the widespread popularity of the concoction.<ref name="coulombe"/>

== Recipe variations ==
[[File:Cuba Libre.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Two Cuba Libres]]

'''Cubata''' is a Cuba Libre made from [[Havana Club|Havana Club Especial]] instead of Havana Club Blanco, giving it a deeper, more complex flavour.

The '''Cuba Pintada''' ("stained Cuba") is one part rum with two parts [[club soda]] and just enough cola so that it tints the club soda. The '''Cuba Campechana''' ("half-and-half Cuba") contains one part rum topped off with equal parts of club soda and cola. They are both popular refreshments, especially among young people.

Other recent variations are the '''Cuba Light''' made with rum and [[Diet Coke]], and the '''Witch Doctor''' made with [[dark rum]] and [[Dr. Pepper]].

Another variation of the Cuba Libre is the '''Cuban Missile Crisis'''. Compared to a normal Cuba Libre, it uses a higher proof rum, such as [[Bacardi 151]] (75.5%).

A variation of the Cuba Libre popular in the West Indies is a '''“Hot” Cuba Libre''' which includes a splash of Caribbean [[hot sauce]] (for example, Capt'n Sleepy's Quintessential Habanero, or Matouk's).

Some people substitute Cream Soda and spiced rum to create a bright gold drink, often referred to as a [[Midas]].

Another recent variation is the '''Venezuela Libre''', inspired by the increasing cooperation between the governments of [[Venezuela]] and Cuba. It has {{convert|1.5|USfloz|ml}} of Venezuelan White Rum, {{convert|1.5|USfloz|ml}} of Venezuelan Gold Rum, {{convert|3|USfloz|ml}} of lemon mix, 1 lemon wedge and a dash of angostura bitters, and diet cola in place of normal cola.

The drink's name has evolved somewhat in both Cuba and the United States, where some choose to refer to it as a '''Mentirita''' ("a little lie"), in an opinionated reference to Cuban politics.

*In [[Australia]], the more popularly known drink is simply '''Rum and Coke''' or "Rumbo", which contains no lime, commonly uses a local dark rum and can be purchased in cans as a ready-to-drink. However, the combination of light rum, brown sugar and cola is commonly ordered at cocktail bars as a ''Cuba Libre''.
*In [[Brazil]], there is another variation, made with "[[cachaça]]" and lemon without peeling.
*In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the drink is most commonly served without the lime juice and ordered simply as a '''Bacardi and Coke''' {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. When the lime juice is included and rubbed around the rim of the glass it can be known as a [[Lou Bega]], after the popular singer. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Often the drink is called Cuban for the original mix and White Cuban when coke is replaced with Sprite or 7up.
*In [[Chile]] and [[Spain]],  Cuba Libre is also called "Ron-Cola" and "Cubata".
*In [[Costa Rica]], it is normally known as "Ron-Coca", although a low calorie variation called '''Tico Libre''' is made with gold or dark rum, diet cola and garnished with lemon for a refreshing finish.
*In [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], [[Kofola]], a popular local soft drink, is frequently used instead of coke. Also, the rum is often substituted by [[Tuzemak]].
*In [[India]], the more popularly known drink is simply '''Rum and Coke''', which contains no lime, commonly uses a local rum (such as [[Old Monk]]). Mixing cola with hard alcoholic beverages other than rum is quite popular in India.
*In the [[Dominican Republic]] it is a popular drink poured with a generous amount of locally produced Dominican Rum (i.e. Brugal, Bermúdez, etc.) and cola, topped off with a slice of lime. 
*In Greece [[Thessaloniki]], there is another variant, that consists of "[[retsina]]" and cola, named "tumba libre". "Tumba" is the name of a neighborhood in Thessaloniki.
*In the [[Netherlands]] the drink is usually served without lime and commonly referred to as '''Baco''', from the two ingredients of [[Bacardi]] rum and cola (even though many bars don't serve Bacardi, the term baco is widely used.)
*In [[Mexico]], it is one of the most popular alcoholic drinks and it is usually referred to simply as a "Cuba".
*In [[Nicaragua]], when it is mixed using [[Flor de Caña]] (the national brand of rum) and cola, it is called a '''Nica Libre'''.
*In [[Puerto Rico]], a variation called "Spicy cherry" or "Spicy vanilla" is made of [[spiced rum]], cherry coke or vanilla coke, and garnished with a lime.
*In [[Peru]], a variation called '''Peru Libre''' is made with [[pisco]] rather than [[rum]].<ref name="perulibre">{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutdrinks.com/en/drinks/peru-libre/|accessdate=19 July 2012|title=Peru Libre Cocktail Recipe}}</ref>
*In [[Poland]], when it is mixed using [[Burn (energy drink)|Burn]] and rum, it is called a '''Poland Libre'''. This, because Burn is a popular drink to mix in Poland and the drink turns red (the color of Poland).
*In [[Russia]] Cuba Libre without the lime juice is called '''Rock-n-Roll Star''', after a popular song that features the recipe. Any distilled spirit could be substituted for a rum in a pinch, but these variations generally do not have any specific names.
*In [[Venezuela]] the '''Cuba Libre Preparado''' ("Prepared Cuba Libre") includes a dash of [[gin]] and a dash of [[Angostura bitters]].
*In [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], there has been a long history of trading dried salted codfish to the West Indies, usually for rum, molasses and spices. [[Newfoundland Screech]], a rum which is actually made in Jamaica, is popularly mixed with coke - without lime. One variation to this drink is called the '''Tom Morry''' - which involves equal parts dark rum, water and coke.
