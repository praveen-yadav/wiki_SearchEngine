===Ancient Greece===
[[Kottabos]] is one of the earliest known drinking games from [[ancient Greece]], dated to the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Players would use dregs to hit targets across the room with their wine. Often, there were special prizes and penalties for one's performance in the game.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/greece/hetairai/kottabos.html Kottabos]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref>

===Ancient China===
Drinking games were enjoyed in ancient [[China]], usually incorporating the use of [[dice]] or verbal exchange of [[riddle]]s.<ref name="benn 145">Benn, 145.</ref> During the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907), the Chinese used a [[silver]] canister where written lots could be drawn that designated which player had to drink and specifically how much; for example, from 1, 5, 7, or 10 measures of drink that the youngest player, or the last player to join the game, or the most talkative player, or the host, or the player with the greatest alcohol tolerance, etc. had to drink<ref name="benn 145 146">Benn, 145-146.</ref>  There were even drinking game [[referee]] officials, including a 'registrar of the rules' who knew all the rules to the game, a 'registrar of the horn' who tossed a silver flag down on calling out second offenses, and a 'governor' who decided one's third call of offense.<ref name="benn 146"/>  These referees were used mainly for maintaining order (as drinking games often became rowdy) and for reviewing faults that could be punished with a player drinking a penalty cup.<ref name="benn 146">Benn, 146.</ref>  If a guest was considered a 'coward' for dropping out of the game, he could be branded as a 'deserter' and not invited back to further drinking bouts.<ref name="benn 146"/> There was another game where little puppets and dolls dressed as western foreigners with blue eyes ([[Iranian peoples]]) were set up and when one fell over, the person it pointed to had to empty his cup of wine.<ref name="schafer 23">Schafer, 23.</ref>

==Types==
[[File:Beer bong 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Bonging is popular among college students.]]

===Endurance===
The simplest drinking games are endurance games in which players compete to out-drink each other. Players take turns taking shots, and the last person standing is the winner. Some games have rules involving the "cascade", "fountain" or "waterfall", which encourages each player to drink constantly from their cup so long as the player before him does not stop drinking. Such games can also favor speed over quantity, in which players race to drink a case of beer the fastest. Often drinking large amounts will be combined with a stylistic element or an abnormal method of drinking, as with the [[boot of beer]], [[yard of ale]] or a [[keg stand]].

Tolerance games are simply about seeing which player can last the longest. It can be as simple as two people matching each other drink for drink until one of the participants "passes out". [[Power hour]] and its variant, [[centurion (game)|centurion]], fall under this category.

===Speed===
Many pub or bar games involve competitive drinking for speed. Examples of such drinking games are [[Edward Fortyhands]], [[Boat race (game)|boat races]], [[funneling|beer bonging]], [[shotgunning]], [[flippy cup]] (a team-based speed game), and [[Yard glass|yard]]. Some say that the most important skill to improving speed is to relax and take fewer but larger gulps.  There are a variety of individual tactics to accomplishing this, such as bending the knees in anticipation, or when drinking from a plastic cup, squeezing the sides of the cup to form a more perfect funnel.

Athletic races involving alcohol including the [[beer mile]], which consists of a mile run with a can of beer consumed before each of the four laps. A variant is known in German speaking countries as ''[[kastenlauf|Bierkastenlauf]]'' (beer crate running) where a team of two carries a crate of beer along a route of several kilometers and must consume all of the bottles prior to crossing the finish line.

===Skill===
Some party and pub games focus on the doing of a particular act of skill, rather than on either the amount a participant drinks or the speed with which they do so. Examples include [[beer pong]], [[Quarters (drinking game)|quarters]], chandeliers, [[caps (drinking game)|caps]], [[polish horseshoes]], [[Beer pong (paddles)|pong]], and [[beerdarts|beer darts]].

[[Pub Golf]] involves [[orienteering]] and [[pub crawl]]ing together.

===Thinking===
Thinking games rely on the players' powers of observation, recollection, logic and articulation.

Numerous types of thinking games exist, including Think or Drink, [[21 (drinking game)|21]], [[beer checkers]], [[bizz buzz]], [[buffalo (drinking game)|buffalo]], [[bullshit (drinking game)|bullshit]], tourettes, [[matchbox (drinking game)|matchboxes]], [[never have I ever]], [[roman numerals (game)|roman numerals]], [[Fuzzy Duck (drinking game)|fuzzy duck]], [[pennying]], wine games, and [[Zoom Schwartz Profigliano]]. [[Trivia]] games, such as [[Trivial Pursuit]], are sometimes played as drinking games.

===Card and dice===

Dice games include [[beer die]], [[dudo]], [[kinito]], [[liar's dice]], [[mexico (game)|Mexico]], [[mia (game)|mia]], [[pounce!]], [[ship, captain, and crew]], and [[three man]].

===Arts===
Film drinking games are played while watching a [[movie]] (sometimes a TV show or a sporting event) and have a set of rules for who drinks when and how much based on on-screen events and dialogue.  The rules may be the same for all players, or alternatively players may each be assigned rules related to particular characters. The rules are designed so that rarer events require larger drinks.  Rule sets for such games are usually arbitrary and local, although they are sometimes published by fan clubs. Matching the characters in the film [[Withnail and I drinking game|Withnail and I]] is such a game.<ref name="WithnailWeb">{{cite web|url=http://www.withnail-links.com/drinking.htm|title=The Withnail and I Drinking Game|publisher=withnail-links.com|accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref><ref name="WithnailCD">The ''Withnail and I'' Drinking Game, DVD featurette. Anchor Bay 2006.</ref>

Live drinking games such as Los Angeles-based "A Drinking Game"<ref name="LA Weekly">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/arts/2011/11/a_drinking_game_at_molly_malones_natalie_lynch.php|title=A Drinking Game at Molly Malone's: Actors Perform Live Readings of Classic Movies.

A suggestion to "do six shots for SEAL Team 6" following every mention of Osama bin Laden at the 2012 Democratic National Convention necessitated a prominent disclaimer on the satire site that posted it, as the quantity of alcohol ingested would probably have been lethal.<ref name="ddgtidubo20120906">{{Citation

"Datsyuk Game" involves a [[Pavel Datsyuk|Datsyuk]] highlight reel being played and contestants drink every time the word ''Datsyuk'' is mentioned. The ceremonial playing of the Russian national anthem before the game is another tradition.

Music can also be used as a basis for drinking games. The song "Thunderstruck" by [[AC/DC]] is used in which a player begins drinking when the word thunder is sung and switches to the next player the next time it is sung.

Sport related drinking games involve the participants each selecting a scenario of the game resulting in their drink being downed. Examples of this include participants each picking a footballer in a game while other versions require multiple players to be selected. Should a player score or be sent off, a drink must be taken. Another version requires a drink for every touch a player takes of the ball.
