'''Apollo 11''' was the [[spaceflight]] that [[Moon landing|landed]] the first humans on the [[Moon]], Americans [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]], on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]. Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected {{convert|47.5|lb|kg}} of lunar material for return to Earth. A third member of the mission, [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], piloted the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command spacecraft]] alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to Earth.

Launched by a [[Saturn V]] rocket from [[Kennedy Space Center]] in [[Merritt Island, Florida]], on July 16, Apollo 11 was the fifth manned mission of [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]]. The Apollo [[Apollo (spacecraft)|spacecraft]] had three parts: a [[Command Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]] (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on Earth; a [[Command Module#Service Module (SM)|Service Module]] (SM), which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) for landing on the Moon. After being sent toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the [[Mare Tranquillitatis|Sea of Tranquility]]. They stayed a total of about 21Â½ hours on the lunar surface. After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to Earth and landed in the [[Pacific Ocean]] on July 24.

Broadcast on live TV to a world-wide audience, Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as "one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind." Apollo 11 effectively ended the [[Space Race]] and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by the late [[President of the United States|US President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] in a speech before the [[United States Congress]], "before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/05/25/kennedy.moon/ |title=Man on the Moon: Kennedy speech ignited the dream |work=CNN |last=Stenger |first=Richard |date=May 25, 2001 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20100606035837/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/05/25/kennedy.moon/ |archivedate=June 6, 2010}}</ref>

Each crewman of Apollo 11 had made a spaceflight before this mission, making it only the second all-veteran crew (the other being [[Apollo 10]]) in human spaceflight history.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S., Jr. |others=Foreword by [[Samuel C.

Collins was originally slated to be the Command Module Pilot (CMP) on [[Apollo 8]] but was removed when he required surgery on his back and was replaced by [[Jim Lovell]], his backup for that flight. After Collins was medically cleared, he took what would have been Lovell's spot on Apollo 11; as a veteran of Apollo 8, Lovell was transferred to Apollo 11's backup crew, but promoted to backup commander.

In early 1969, Bill Anders accepted a job with the [[National Space Council]] effective in August 1969 and announced his retirement as an astronaut. At that point [[Ken Mattingly]] was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup Command Module Pilot in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch (at which point Anders would be unavailable if needed) and would later join Lovell's crew and ultimately be assigned as the original [[Apollo 13]] CMP.<ref>{{cite book |title=Deke!

After the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft ''Charlie Brown'' and ''Snoopy'', assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]] director [[George M. Low]] to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. During early mission planning, the names ''Snowcone'' and ''Haystack'' were used and put in the news release,<ref name="Snowcone">{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap11fj/pdf/a11-techsum.pdf |title=Technical Information Summary, Apollo-11 (AS-506) Apollo Saturn V Space Vehicle |date=June 25, 1969 |work=[[Marshall Space Flight Center|George C.

The Command Module was named ''[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]'' after the ''[[Columbiad#In fiction|Columbiad]]'', the giant cannon shell "spacecraft" fired by a giant cannon (coincidentally from Florida) in [[Jules Verne|Jules Verne's]] 1865 novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Farmer |first1=Gene |last2=Hamblin |first2=Dora Jane |last3=Armstrong |first3=Neil |authorlink3=Neil Armstrong |last4=Collins |first4=Michael |last5=Aldrin |first5=Edwin E., Jr. |title=[[First on the Moon (1970 book)|First on the Moon: A Voyage with Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, Edwin E.

===Insignia===
<!--[[File:Apollo 11 insignia.png|thumb|upright=0.45|left|Mission insignia]] Shown in infobox-->
The Apollo 11 mission insignia was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for "peaceful lunar landing by the United States". He chose an eagle as the symbol, put an [[olive branch]] in its beak, and drew a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. NASA officials said the talons of the eagle looked too "warlike" and after some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the claws. The crew decided the [[Roman numeral]] [[11 (number)|XI]] would not be understood in some nations and went with "Apollo 11"; they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would "be representative of ''everyone'' who had worked toward a lunar landing".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Collins |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Collins (astronaut) |others=Foreword by [[Charles Lindberg]] |origyear=Originally published 1974; New York: [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |year=2001 |title=Carrying the Fire: An Astronaut's Journeys |publisher=Cooper Square Press |location=New York |isbn=0-8154-1028-X |lccn=2001017080 |pages=332â333}}</ref>

All colors are natural, with blue and gold borders around the [[Mission patch|patch]]. When the [[Eisenhower Dollar|Eisenhower dollar coin]] was released a few years later, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coinsite.com/CoinSite-PF/pparticles/$1eisen.asp |title=1971-78 Dollar Eisenhower |work=CoinSite |publisher=ROKO Design Group, Inc. |year=1994 |accessdate=July 20, 2009}}</ref> The design was retained for the smaller [[Susan B.

In addition to throngs of people crowding highways and beaches near the launch site, millions watched the event on television, with NASA Chief of Public Information [[Jack King (NASA)|Jack King]] providing commentary. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon|Richard M. Nixon]] viewed the proceedings from the [[Oval Office]] of the [[White House]].

A [[Saturn V]] launched Apollo 11 from Launch Pad 39A, part of the Launch Complex 39 site at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] on July 16, 1969 at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00 a.m. EDT local time). It entered orbit twelve minutes later.<ref name="Orloff" /> After one and a half orbits, the [[S-IVB]] third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the [[Trans-lunar injection|Trans-Lunar Injection]] (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command/service module]] pair separated from this last remaining Saturn V stage and docked with the Lunar Module still nestled in the [[Apollo spacecraft#Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA)|Lunar Module Adaptor]]. After the Lunar Module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the third stage booster flew on a trajectory past the Moon and into [[heliocentric orbit]].<ref name="A11timeline">{{cite book |last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |title=Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/SP-4029.htm |accessdate=October 30, 2009 |series=NASA History Series |origyear=First published 2000 |year=2004 |month=September |work=NASA History Division, Office of Policy and Plans |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-16-050631-X |lccn= 00-061677 |id=NASA SP-2000-4029 |chapter=Apollo 11 Timeline |chapterurl=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_11i_Timeline.htm}}</ref>

===Lunar descent===
[[File:Apollo 11 Lunar Module Eagle in landing configuration in lunar orbit from the Command and Service Module Columbia.jpg|thumb|The ''Eagle'' in [[lunar orbit]] after separating from ''Columbia'']]

On July 20, 1969, the Lunar Module ''Eagle'' separated from the Command Module ''Columbia''. Collins, alone aboard ''Columbia'', inspected ''Eagle'' as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged.

As the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface four seconds early and reported that they were "long"; they would land miles west of their target point.

Five minutes into the descent burn, and {{convert|6000|ft|m|-2}} above the surface of the Moon, the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|LM navigation and guidance computer]] distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected "1202" and "1201" program alarms. Inside [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] in Houston, Texas, computer engineer [[Jack Garman]] told [[Flight controller#Guidance Officer (GUIDANCE or GUIDO)|guidance officer]] [[Steve Bales]] it was safe to continue the descent, and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated "executive overflows", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Collins |first1=Michael |last2=Aldrin |first2=Edwin E., Jr. |authorlink2=Buzz Aldrin |editor-last=Cortright |editor-first=Edgar M |editor-link=Edgar Cortright |title=Apollo Expeditions to the Moon |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-350/cover.html |accessdate=June 13, 2013 |year=1975 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=1623434 |id=NASA SP-350 |chapter=A Yellow Caution Light |chapterurl=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-350/ch-11-4.html}} Chapter 11.4.</ref>

In a letter to ''[[Datamation]]'', March 1, 1971, [[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Margaret H. Hamilton]], Director of Apollo Flight Computer Programming MIT Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts, stated: âDue to an error in the checklist manual, the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position. This caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer. The result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15% of its time. The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, ''I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks''; i.e., the ones needed for landing...Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions.

The sequence that occurred in the Apollo 11 landing was successful because of its global error detection and recovery system. This included the restart capability to âkill and start over againâ and recompute and the display interface routines (âpriority displaysâ) providing the ability, in the case of an emergency, to interrupt nominal displays with higher priority alarm displays. Steps previously taken to create solutions that took advantage of this multiprogramming environment suggested solutions for multiprocessing. Although only one process is actively executing at a given time in a multiprogramming environment, other processes in the same systemâsleeping or waitingâexist in parallel with the executing process. With this as a backdrop, the priority display mechanisms were created, essentially changing the man-machine interface between the astronauts and the onboard flight software from synchronous to asynchronous displays so that a mission could be reconfigured in real time should it become necessary to do so.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=Margaret H. |last2=Hackler |first2=William R. |year=2008 |month=December |title=Universal Systems Language: Lessons Learned from Apollo |volume=41 |issue=12 |pages=34â43 |journal=Computer |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[IEEE Computer Society]] |issn=0018-9162 |doi=10.1109/MC.2008.541 |url=http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MC.2008.541 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref>}}

===Landing===
[[File:Apollo-11-landing-site.png|thumb|Alt=image of the Moon showing landing site of Apollo 11 around center of the Moon|Landing site of Apollo 11 at Sea of Tranquility]]
When Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a {{convert|300|m|ft|sp=us|adj=on}} diameter crater (later determined to be "West crater," named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing ellipse). Armstrong took semi-automatic control<ref name="Digital Apollo">{{Cite book |last=Mindell |first=David A. |title=Digital Apollo: Human and Machine in Spaceflight |year=2008 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |pages= 195â197 |isbn=978-0-262-13497-2 |lccn=2007032255}}</ref> and, with Aldrin calling out altitude and velocity data, landed at 20:17:40 UTC on July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.<ref name="ALSJ 1" />

Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to be the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra [[baffle]]s were added to the tanks to prevent this.<ref name="ALSJ 1" />

Throughout the descent Aldrin had called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]]. A few moments before the landing, a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the {{convert|67|in|cm|0|adj=on}} probes hanging from ''Eagle'''s footpads had touched the surface, and he said "Contact light!" Three seconds later, ''Eagle'' landed and Armstrong said "Shutdown." Aldrin immediately said "Okay, engine stop. ACA - out of [[detent]]." Armstrong acknowledged "Out of detent. Auto" and Aldrin continued "Mode control - both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm - off. 413 is in."

[[Charles Duke]], acting as CAPCOM during the landing phase, acknowledged their landing by saying "We copy you down, Eagle."

Armstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post landing checklist with "Engine arm is off," before responding to Duke with the words, "Houston, [[Tranquility Base]] here. The ''Eagle'' has landed." Armstrong's unrehearsed<ref name="failure">''Failure is Not an Option''. [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]], 24 August 2003.</ref> change of call sign from "Eagle" to "Tranquility Base" emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful.

Two and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin broadcast that:

{{quote|"This is the LM pilot.

At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] (who had objected to the Apollo 8 crew reading from the [[Book of Genesis]]) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space. As such, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the [[Webster, Texas|Webster]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]], and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, the Rev. Dean Woodruff. Aldrin described communion on the Moon and the involvement of his church and pastor in the October 1970 edition of ''Guideposts'' magazine and in his book ''Return to Earth''. Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20.<ref name="chaikin">{{Cite book |author=Chaikin, Andrew |title=A Man on the Moon: The Triumphant Story Of The Apollo Space Program |year=1994 |publisher=[[Penguin Group]] |location=New York |pages=204, 623 |isbn=0-14-027201-1}}</ref>

The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period, since they had been awake since early morning. However, they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to sleep.

Armstrong claims to have said "That's one small step for ''a'' man, one giant leap for mankind" when he first set foot on the lunar surface. The "''a''" is not clear in NASA recordings, but the audio and video links back to Earth were somewhat intermittent, partly because of storms near [[Parkes Observatory]]. More recent digital analysis of the tape by NASA revealed the "a" may have been spoken but obscured by static.<ref name="Straight Dope">{{cite web | url = http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_362.html | author = Adams, Cecil | title = Did astronaut Neil Armstrong muff his historic "one small step" line? }}</ref><ref name="snopes a">{{snopes | link = http://www.snopes.com/quotes/onesmall.asp | title = One Small Step }}</ref>

At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong opened the hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against ''Eagle'''s side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15  UTC he set his left foot on the surface.<ref name="neil82">{{cite news |title=Neil Armstrong, first man to step on the Moon, dies at 82 |first=Paul |last=Duggan |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/neil-armstrong-first-man-to-step-on-the-moon-dies-at-82/2012/08/25/7091c8bc-412d-11e0-a16f-4c3fe0fd37f0_story.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=August 25, 2012 |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref><ref name="ALSJ 4">{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html |title=One Small Step |year=1995 |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Eric M. |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The first landing used [[slow-scan television]] incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing the quality of the picture.<ref name="Blunder 5">{{cite news |title=One giant blunder for mankind: how NASA lost Moon pictures |last=Macey |first=Richard |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/one-giant-blunder-for-mankind-how-nasa-lost-moon-pictures/2006/08/04/1154198328978.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |location=Sydney |date=August 5, 2006 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The signal was received at [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] in the United States but with better fidelity by [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station]] in Australia.

About seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lsc/10010.pdf |title=Lunar Sample Compendium: Contingency Soil (10010) |last=Meyer |first=Charles |year=2009 |work=Astromaterials Research & Exploration Science |publisher=NASA |format=PDF |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref>

In addition to fulfilling President Kennedy's mandate to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s,<ref>{{cite news |title=Events of 1969: Apollo 11 |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/Events-of-1969/Apollo-11/ |work=UPI.com |publisher=[[United Press International]] |year=1969 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> Apollo 11 was an engineering test of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition. He removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod {{convert|68|ft|m}} from the LM. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA.

[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|Aldrin poses on the Moon, allowing Armstrong to photograph both of them using the visor's reflection]]

Armstrong said that moving in the [[Gravitation of the Moon|lunar gravity]], one-sixth of Earth's, was "even perhaps easier than the simulations... It's absolutely no trouble to walk around."<ref name="ALSJ 4"/> Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backwards, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into ''Eagle'''s shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, though the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow.<ref name="ALSJ 4"/>

The astronauts planted a [[Lunar Flag Assembly|specially designed U.S. flag]] on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Some time later, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission which Nixon called "the most historic phone call ever made from the White House."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/american_originals/apollo11.html |title=Exhibit: Apollo 11 and Nixon |month=March |year=1996 |work=American Originals |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=April 13, 2008}}</ref> Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but [[Frank Borman]], who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief, to respect the lunar landing as Kennedy's legacy.<ref>This was related by Frank Borman during the 2008 documentary ''[[When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions]]'', part 2.</ref>

The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits, the integrated thermal meteoroid garment.

They deployed the EASEP, which included a passive seismograph and a [[Lunar Laser Ranging experiment|Lunar Ranging]] [[Retroreflector#Retroreflectors on the Moon|Retroreflector]] (LRRR). Then Armstrong walked {{convert|196|ft|m}} from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater <!-- There is no "East Crater", see http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11EastCraterRIP.html --> while Aldrin collected two core tubes. He used the [[geological hammer]] to pound in the tubes - the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes.

[[File:Apollo 11 photo map.pdf|thumb|Map showing landing site and photos taken]]
Three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: [[armalcolite]], [[tranquillityite]], and [[pyroxferroite]]. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins.

During this period Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. However, as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension.<ref name="ALSJ 5">{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.clsout.html |title=EASEP Deployment and Closeout |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Eric M. |year=1995 |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> In a 2010 interview, Armstrong, who had walked a maximum of {{convert|196|ft|m}} from the LM, explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk's time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon.<ref name="neilmoonwalk">{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/10469-neil-armstrong-explains-famous-apollo-11-moonwalk.html |title=Neil Armstrong Explains His Famous Apollo 11 Moonwalk |date=December 10, 2010 |work=[[space.com]] |publisher=[[TechMediaNetwork, Inc.]] |location=New York |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref>

===Lunar ascent and return===
[[File:Aldrin with experiment.jpg|thumb|Aldrin next to the Passive Seismic Experiment Package with ''Eagle'' in the background]]

Aldrin entered ''Eagle'' first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing more than {{convert|22|kg|lb}} of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve, and Aldrin tossed the bag down; Armstrong then jumped to the ladder's third rung and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM [[life support]], the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one [[Hasselblad]] camera, and other equipment. They then pressurized the LM, and settled down to sleep.<ref name="ALSJ 6">{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.posteva.html |title=Trying to Rest |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Eric M. |year=1995 |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref>

While moving within the cabin, Aldrin accidentally broke the [[circuit breaker]] that would arm the main engine for lift off from the Moon. There was concern this would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the Moon. Fortunately a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch.<ref name="ALSJ 6" /> Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.<ref name="Murray">{{Cite book |last1=Murray |first1=Charles A. |authorlink1=Charles Murray (author) |last2=Cox |first2=Catherine Bly | title=Apollo: The Race to the Moon |year=1989 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York|isbn=0-671-61101-1 |lccn=89006333}}</ref>

After about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in ''Eagle'''s ascent stage, carrying 21.5 kilograms of lunar samples with them, to rejoin CMP Michael Collins aboard ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit. During the launch Aldrin looked up in time to see the exhaust from the ascent module's engine knock over the American flag they had planted.<ref name="Orloff" />

[[File:Apollo 11 plaque closeup on Moon.jpg|left|thumb|The plaque left on the ladder of ''Eagle'']]

After more than 2Â½ hours on the lunar surface, they had left behind scientific instruments that included a [[Retroreflector#Retroreflectors on the Moon|retroreflector]] array used for the [[Lunar Laser Ranging experiment|Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment]] and a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure [[Quake (natural phenomenon)#Moonquake|moonquakes]]. They also left an American flag, an Apollo 1 mission patch, and a [[lunar plaque|plaque]] (mounted on the LM Descent Stage ladder) bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The inscription read:
{{quote|''Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.''}}
They also left behind a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk.

Also, according to Deke Slayton's book ''Moonshot'', Armstrong carried with him a special diamond-studded astronaut pin from Slayton.

[[File:Apollo 11 lunar module.jpg|thumb|''Eagle'''s ascent stage approaching ''Columbia'']]

Film taken from the LM Ascent Stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some {{Convert|25|ft|m|0}} from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Buzz Aldrin witnessed it topple: "The ascent stage of the LM separated... I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the [[attitude indicator]], but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over."<ref name="Apollo-11 (27)" /> Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags at least {{Convert|100|ft|m|sigfig=1}} from the LM to prevent its being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust.

After rendezvous with ''Columbia'', ''Eagle''âs ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit on July 21, 1969 at 23:41 UTC. Just before the [[Apollo 12]] flight, it was noted that ''Eagle'' was still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that ''Eagle'''s orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an "uncertain location" on the lunar surface.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_tables.html |title=Apollo Tables |last=Williams |first=David R. |work=[[National Space Science Data Center]] |publisher=NASA |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}</ref> The location is uncertain because the ''Eagle'' ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time. NASA estimated that the orbit had decayed within months and would have impacted on the Moon.

On July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented,
:"... The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly ... We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of a people ...All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, 'Thank you very much.'"

Aldrin added,
:"This has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown ... Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. 'When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?'"
Armstrong concluded,
:"The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU]], the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11."<ref name="Apollo-11 (27)" />

On the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg later was thanked by Armstrong.<ref>{{cite news |title=The 10-year-old who helped Apollo 11, 40 years later |last=Rodriguez |first=Rachel |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/space/07/20/apollo11.irpt/index.html |work=CNN |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2011}}</ref>

===Splashdown and quarantine===
[[File:Splashdown 3.jpg|thumb|221px|''Columbia'' floats on the ocean as Navy divers assist in retrieving the astronauts]] 
[[File:Apollo-11-quarantine-7.jpg|right|thumb|The astronauts in their Biological Isolation Garments aboard the [[USS Hornet (CV-12)|USS ''Hornet'']]]]

On July 24, the astronauts returned home aboard the Command Module ''Columbia'' just before dawn local time (16:51 UTC<ref name="A11timeline" />) at {{Coord|13|19|N|169|9|W|type:event|name=Apollo 11 splashdown}}, in the Pacific Ocean {{convert|2660|km|nmi|abbr=on}} east of [[Wake Island]], {{convert|380|km|nmi|abbr=on}} south of [[Johnston Atoll]], and {{convert|24|km|nmi|abbr=on}} from the recovery ship, [[USS Hornet (CV-12)|USS ''Hornet'']].<ref name="Orloff" />

At 16:44 UTC the [[drogue parachute]]s had been deployed and seven minutes later the Command Module struck the water forcefully. The Command Module landed upside down but was righted within 10 minutes by flotation bags triggered by the astronauts. "Everything's okay. Our checklist is complete. Awaiting swimmers," was Armstrong's last official transmission from the ''Columbia''. A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to the Command Module to prevent it from drifting. Additional divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and position rafts for astronaut extraction. Though the chance of bringing back [[pathogen]]s from the lunar surface was considered remote, it was considered a possibility and NASA took great precautions at the recovery site. Divers provided the astronauts with Biological Isolation Garments (BIGs) which were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board the ''Hornet''. Additionally astronauts were rubbed down with a [[sodium hypochlorite]] solution and the Command Module wiped with [[Betadine]] to remove any lunar dust that might be present. The raft containing decontamination materials was then intentionally sunk.<ref name="hornet">{{Cite book |last=Fish |first=Bob |others=Foreword by [[Richard F.

A second [[Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King|Sea King]] helicopter hoisted the astronauts aboard one by one, where a NASA [[flight surgeon]] gave each a brief physical check during the {{convert|0.5|nmi|m}} trip back to the ''Hornet''.

[[File:Apollo 11 crew in quarantine.jpg|thumb|left|The crew of Apollo 11 in [[quarantine]] after returning to Earth, visited by Richard Nixon]]

After touchdown on the ''Hornet'', the astronauts exited the helicopter, leaving the flight surgeon and three crewmen. The helicopter was then lowered into hangar bay #2 where the astronauts walked the {{convert|30|ft|m}} to the [[Mobile Quarantine Facility]] (MQF) where they would begin their 21 days of quarantine. This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and [[Apollo 14]], before the Moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped.<ref name="hornet" /><ref name="Smithsonian ">{{cite web |url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/apollo-to-the-moon/online/a11.jh.3.html |title=After Splashdown |month=July |year=1999 |work=Apollo to the Moon |publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}</ref>

President Richard Nixon was aboard ''Hornet'' to personally welcome the astronauts back to Earth. He told the astronauts, "As a result of what you've done, the world has never been closer together before."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thenewnixon.org/2008/07/23/24-july-1969-home-from-the-moon/ |title=24 July 1969: Home From The Moon |last=Gannon |first=Frank |date=July 23, 2008 |work=The New Nixon |publisher=[[Richard Nixon Foundation]] |accessdate=July 20, 2009}}</ref> After Nixon departed, the ''Hornet'' was brought alongside the five-ton Command Module where it was placed aboard by the ship's crane, placed on a dolly and moved next to the MQF. The ''Hornet'' sailed for [[Pearl Harbor]] where the Command Module and MQF were airlifted to the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]].<ref name="hornet" />

Years later, it was publicly revealed that Nixon had prepared a speech to be given in the event the Lunar Module had failed to lift off from the lunar surface, which would have resulted in Armstrong's and Aldrin's deaths, similar to common [[Obituary#Media|newspaper obituary]] or government [[contingency plan]] procedures and policies.<ref>{{cite news |title=A silent death |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/390634.stm  |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |location=London |date=July 10, 1999 |accessdate=January 10, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Full text: Nixon's unused Apollo speech |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/390933.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |location=London |date=July 10, 1999 |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref>

In accordance with the recently passed [[Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law]], the astronauts were placed in quarantine for fear that the Moon might contain undiscovered [[pathogen]]s and that the astronauts might have been exposed to them during their Moon walks. However, after almost three weeks in confinement (first in their trailer and later in the [[Lunar Receiving Laboratory]] at the Manned Spacecraft Center), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaexplores.com/extras/apollo11/hirasaki.html |title=A Front Row Seat For History |date=July 15, 2004 |work=NASAexplores |publisher=NASA |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20060319184027/http://www.nasaexplores.com/extras/apollo11/hirasaki.html |archivedate=March 19, 2006 |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> On August 10, 1969, the astronauts exited quarantine.

===Celebration===
[[File:New York City Welcomes the Apollo 11 Astronauts - GPN-2002-000034.jpg|thumb|Parade in New York]]
On August 13, they rode in parades in their honor in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. On the same evening in Los Angeles there was an official [[State dinner|State Dinner]] to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44 governors, the [[Chief Justice of the United States]], and ambassadors from 83 nations at the [[Century Plaza Hotel]]. President Richard Nixon and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Spiro Agnew|Spiro T. Agnew]] honored each astronaut with a presentation of the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. This celebration was the beginning of a 45-day "Giant Leap" tour that brought the astronauts to 25 foreign countries and included visits with prominent leaders such as [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom. Many nations honored the first manned [[Moon landing]] with special features in magazines or by issuing Apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43460781 |title=The Australian Women's Weekly. |newspaper=[[Australian Women's Weekly|The Australian Women's Weekly (1933 - 1982)]] |location=1933 - 1982 |date=23 July 1969 |accessdate=19 July 2013 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{Wayback |url=http://www.lunarhall.org/missions/apollo/11.html |title=Lunar Hall of Fame: Apollo 11 |date=20081024222503}}</ref>

On September 16, 1969, the three astronauts spoke before a [[joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] on [[Capitol Hill]]. They presented two US flags, one to the House of Representatives and the other to the Senate, that had been carried to the surface of the Moon with them.

==Moon race==
[[File:Luna-16.jpg|thumb|180px|Artist's impression of Luna 15]]

The [[Soviet Union]] was secretly attempting to compete with the US in landing a man on the Moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of [[N1 (rocket)|a launcher comparable to the Saturn V]].<ref name="sovlun">{{cite web |url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/science-technology-and-society/sts-471j-engineering-apollo-the-moon-project-as-a-complex-system-spring-2007/readings/soviet_mand_lunr.pdf |title=The Soviet Manned Lunar Program |last=Lindroos |first=Marcus |work=[[MIT OpenCourseWare]] |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |format=PDF |accessdate=October 4, 2011}}</ref> Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of [[Unmanned spacecraft|unmanned probes]]. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched [[Luna 15]], which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in [[Mare Crisium]] about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the surface. The [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.<ref>{{cite news |title=Recording tracks Russia's Moon gatecrash attempt |first=Jonathan |last=Brown |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/recording-tracks-russias-moon-gatecrash-attempt-1730851.html |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Limited |location=London |date=July 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2011}}</ref>

The Command Module is displayed at the [[National Air and Space Museum]], Washington, D.C. It is in the central ''Milestones of Flight'' exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the [[Wright Flyer]], the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'', the [[Bell X-1]], the [[North American X-15]], [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] spacecraft ''[[Friendship 7]]'', and [[Gemini 4]]. Armstrong's and Aldrin's space suits are displayed in the museum's ''Apollo to the Moon'' exhibit. The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar, and the righting spheres are displayed at the Smithsonian's [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] annex near [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in Virginia.

In 2009 the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (LRO) imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the Moon with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts.
