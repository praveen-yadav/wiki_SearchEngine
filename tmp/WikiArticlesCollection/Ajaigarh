Ajaigarh was the capital of a [[princely state]] of the same name during the [[British Raj]]. Ajaigarh was founded in 1765 by Guman Singh, a [[bundela]] [[Rajput]] who was the nephew of Raja Pahar Singh of Jaitpur. After Ajaigarh was captured by the British in 1809, it became a princely state in the [[Bundelkhand]] Agency of the [[Central India Agency]]. It had an area of 771&nbsp;mile² (1997&nbsp;km²), and a population of 78,236 in 1901. The rulers bore the title of ''sawai maharaja''. He commanded an estimated annual revenue of about £15,000/-, and paid a tribute of £460/-.  The chief resided at the town of [[Nowgong]]{{disambiguation needed|date=June 2012}}, at the foot of the hill-fortress of Ajaigarh, from which the state took its name. This fort, situated on a steep hill, towers more than 800&nbsp;ft (244 m) above the eponymous township, and contains the ruins of several temples adorned with elaborately carved sculptures. The town was often afflicted by [[malaria]], and suffered severely from famine in 1868-1869 and 1896-1897.

The state acceded to the [[Government of India]] on January 1, 1950; the ruling chief was granted a privy purse of Rs. 74,700/-, and the courtesy use of his styles and titles. All of these were revoked by the government of [[India]] in 1971, at the time when these privileges were revoked from all erstwhile princes. The former princely state became part of the new Indian state of [[Vindhya Pradesh]], and most of the territory of the former state, including the town of Ajaigarh, became part of Panna District, with a smaller portion going to [[Chhatarpur District]]. Vindhya Pradesh was merged into [[Madhya Pradesh]] on November 1, 1956.
