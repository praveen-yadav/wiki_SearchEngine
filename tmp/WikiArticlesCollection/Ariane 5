'''Ariane 5''' is, as a part of [[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane rocket family]], an [[expendable launch system]] used to deliver payloads into [[geostationary transfer orbit]] (GTO) or [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO). Ariane 5 [[rocket]]s are manufactured under the authority of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and the [[Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales]] (CNES).  [[Astrium]], an EADS company, is the prime contractor for the vehicles, leading a consortium of sub-contractors. Ariane 5 is operated and marketed by [[Arianespace]] as part of the ''[[Ariane (rocket)|Ariane]]'' programme. Astrium builds the rockets in [[Europe]] and Arianespace launches them from the [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[French Guiana]].

Ariane 5 succeeded [[Ariane 4]], but was not derived from it directly. Ariane 5 has been refined since the first launch in successive versions, "G", "G+", "GS", "ECA", and most recently, "ES".  ESA originally designed Ariane 5 to launch the manned mini shuttle [[Hermes (shuttle)|Hermes]], and thus intended it to be "[[Human-rating certification|human rated]]" from the beginning.

Two satellites can be mounted using a SYLDA carrier (''SYstème de Lancement Double Ariane''). Three main satellites are possible depending on size using SPELTRA (''Structure Porteuse Externe Lancement TRiple Ariane''). Up to eight secondary payloads, usually small experiment packages or [[miniaturized satellite|minisatellites]], can be carried with an ASAP (''Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads'') platform.

By mid-2007, Arianespace has ordered a total of 99 Ariane 5 launchers from Astrium. The first batch ordered in 1995 consisted of 14 launchers, while the second—P2—batch ordered in 1999 consisted of 20 launchers. A third—PA—batch consisting of 25 ECA and 5 ES launchers was ordered in 2004. The latest batch ordered in mid-2007 consist of another 35 ECA launchers.<ref>
{{cite web|url=http://www.arianespace.com/launch-services-ariane5/milestones.asp |title=
Ariane 5 milestones |year=2008 |publisher=Arianespace}}</ref> Through these orders, the Ariane 5 will be the workhorse of Arianespace at least through 2015.

[[Image:SNECMA Vulcain II.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vulcain|Vulcain II engine]]|150px]]

===Cryogenic main stage===
Ariane 5’s [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] H158 main stage (H173 for Ariane 5 ECA) is called the EPC (''Étage Principal Cryotechnique''—Cryotechnic Main Stage). It consists of a large tank 30.5&nbsp;metres high with two compartments, one for 130&nbsp;[[tonne]]s of [[liquid oxygen]] and one for 25&nbsp;[[tonne]]s of [[liquid hydrogen]], and a [[Vulcain]] engine at the base with thrust of <!-- {{convert|115|tonne-force|MN|lk=on}} --> 115&nbsp;[[tonne-force|tonnes-force]] (1.13&nbsp;[[meganewton]]s). This part of the first stage weighs about 15&nbsp;tonnes when empty.

===Solid boosters===
Attached to the sides are two [[solid rocket booster]]s (SRBs or EAPs from the French ''Étages d’Accélération à Poudre''), P238 (P241 for Ariane 5 ECA), each weighing about 277 tonnes full. Each delivers a thrust of about <!-- {{convert|630|tonne-force|MN|lk=on}} --> 630 tonnes-force ({{nowrap|6.2 MN}}). These SRBs are usually allowed to sink to the bottom of the ocean, but like the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]]s they can be recovered with parachutes, and this is occasionally done for post-flight analysis. (Unlike Space Shuttle SRBs Ariane 5 boosters are not reused.) The most recent attempt was for the first Ariane 5 ECA mission. One of the two boosters was successfully recovered and returned to the Guiana Space Center for analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.france-science.org/spip.php?article399#3-ARIANE-5-ECA-BOOSTER-RECOVERED |title=France in Space #387 |publisher=Office of Science and Technology Embassy of France in the USA}}</ref> Prior to that mission, the last such recovery and testing was done in 2003.

The French [[M51 (missile)|M51]] [[SLBM]] shares a substantial amount of technology with these boosters.

In March 2000 the [[nose cone]] of an Ariane 5 booster washed ashore on the [[South Texas]] coast, and was recovered by [[Beachcombing|beachcombers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-59699394.html |title=NASA confirms French nose cone found |publisher=UPI |date=March 2, 2000}}</ref>

===Second stage===
The second stage is on top of the main stage and below the payload. The Ariane 5G used the EPS (''Étage à Propergols Stockables''—Storable Propellant Stage), which is fueled by [[monomethylhydrazine]] (MMH) and [[nitrogen tetroxide]], whereas the Ariane 5 ECA uses the ESC (''Étage Supérieur Cryotechnique''—Cryogenic Upper Stage), which is fueled by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.  Ariane 5G+ used and Ariane 5 GS and ES use an improved EPS upper stage.

The EPS upper stage is capable of re-ignition, which has been demonstrated four times. The first demonstration occurred during flight V26, which was launched on 5 October 2007. This was purely to test the engine, and occurred after the payloads had been deployed. The first operational use of restart capability as part of a mission, came on 9 March 2008, when two burns were made to deploy the first [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] into a circular parking orbit, followed by a third burn after ATV deployment to de-orbit the stage. The exact procedure has since been used at least two more times on subsequent ATVs.

===Fairing===
The payload and all upper stages are covered at launch by a fairing, which splits off once sufficient altitude has been reached (typically above 150&nbsp;km).

==Variants==
* The original version is dubbed Ariane 5 '''G''' (Generic) with a launch mass of 737 tonnes. Its payload capability to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) was initially specified as {{convert|5970|kg|abbr=on}}, but was increased after the qualification flights to {{convert|6200|kg|abbr=on}}.
* The Ariane 5 '''G+''' had an improved second stage, with a GTO capacity of {{convert|6950|kg|abbr=on}} for a single payload. It flew three times in 2004.
* It was replaced in 2005 by the Ariane 5 '''GS''', with the same EAP boosters as the ECA and ES variants and a first stage based on the later Evolution EPC, but with the original tank volumes and a Vulcain 1B engine. The GS was introduced following the failure of the first Ariane 5 ECA flight—since all the vehicles then in production were ECA versions, it was decided to modify some of them to use the original Vulcain engine while the failure was investigated. It can carry a single payload of {{convert|6100|kg|abbr=on}} to GTO. The last of 6 Ariane 5 GS rockets was launched in 2009.
* The Ariane 5 '''ECA''' (''Evolution Cryotechnique type A'') has a GTO launch capacity of {{convert|10000|kg|abbr=on}} for dual payloads or {{convert|10500|kg|abbr=on}} for a single payload. This variant uses a new Vulcain 2 first-stage engine, and an ESC-A (''Etage Supérieur Cryogénique''-A) second stage, powered by an [[HM-7B]] engine, weighing {{convert|2100|kg|abbr=on}} and carrying {{convert|14000|kg|abbr=on}} of cryogenic [[Spacecraft propulsion|propellant]]. The second stage uses the liquid oxygen tank and lower structure from the Ariane 4's H10 third stage, mated to a new liquid hydrogen tank. The revised Vulcain has a longer, more efficient nozzle with more efficient flow cycle and denser propellant ratio. The new ratio demanded length modifications to the first-stage tanks. Also, the solid EAP casings have been lightened with new welds, and packed with more propellant. The ESC-A cryogenic second stage does not improve the performance to Low Earth orbit compared to Ariane 5G, and for this reason the Ariane 5 ECA will not be used to launch the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] (ATV).
* The Ariane 5 '''ES''' (''Evolution Storable'') is used to launch the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] (ATV) into a 260&nbsp;km circular low Earth orbit inclined at 51.6°.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/ATV/infokit/english/05_ATVLauncher.pdf |title=Ariane 5 ES ATV |publisher=ESA |year=2008}}</ref> It includes all the performance improvements of Ariane 5 '''ECA''' on EPC<ref>[http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Launchers_Home/SEMD763VQUD_2.html ESA launchers glossary]</ref> (''Etage Principal Cryogénique''—main stage) and EAP (''Etage d'Accélération à Poudre''—solid rocket booster) stages while the second stage is the EPS (''Etage à Propergols Stockable'') used on Ariane 5 '''GS''' variants. It is estimated that the Ariane 5 '''ES''' can put up to {{convert|21000|kg|abbr=on}} in LEO. The first such launch occurred at 04:03 [[GMT]] on 9 March 2008.
* The Ariane 5 '''ES Galileo''' is a modification of the standard ES version able to launch four [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] satellites at a time into 23,000&nbsp;km circular orbits and due to enter service in the latter half of 2014. It will feature modifications to the payload fairing and payload delivery system to grant the ability to launch four satellites into unique orbits in a single launch. The variant was approved in February 2012 and alongside Soyuz launching two at a time will deliver the second Galileo constellation of 16 satellites during 2014 and 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Ariane_5_to_launch_Galileo_constellation_999.html |title=Ariane 5 to launch Galileo constellation |publisher=Spacedaily.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref>

==Future developments==
[[Image:Ariane 5 (maquette).jpg|thumb|right]]

===Ariane 5 ME===
The Ariane 5 '''ME''' (Mid-life Evolution) is currently in development, with first flight planned for 2016–2017. The Ariane 5 ME will use a new upper stage, with increased propellant volume, powered by the [[Vinci (rocket engine)|Vinci]] [[expander cycle (rocket)|expander cycle]] engine. Unlike the ECA's HM7B engine, the Vinci engine can restart up to five times, allowing for more complex missions (such as direct [[Geostationary orbit|GEO]] insertion). The ME will also include a longer payload fairing and SYLDA dual payload attach fitting to accommodate larger satellites. The Vinci engine, combined with the higher propellant volume, increases payload to 11,200&nbsp;kg to GTO.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Launchers_Access_to_Space/SEM9G9RHPOG_0.html|title=
ESA—Launch vehicles—Ariane 5 ME }}</ref>

The Ariane 5 ME, originally known as the Ariane 5 '''ECB''', was to have its first flight in 2006. However, the failure of the first ECA flight in 2002, combined with a deteriorating satellite industry, caused ESA to cancel development in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/esa-cancels-plans-for-uprated-ariane-5-ecb-160882/ |title=
ESA cancels plans for uprated Ariane 5 ECB }}</ref> Development of the Vinci engine continued, though at a lower pace. The ESA Council of Ministers agreed to fund development of the new upper stage in November 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dlr.de/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1/86_read-14434/ |title=ESA's Council of Ministers decides the future of European space exploration}}</ref>
On December 21, 2009 ESA awarded a €200 million contract to EADS Astrium to develop the ECB, now called the Ariane 5 ME,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0912/21ariane/ |title=
ESA signs contract for Ariane 5 rocket enhancements }}</ref> and on April 10, 2012 ESA gave a €112 million contract to Astrium to continue development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spacenews.com/launch/120410-astrium-contract-ariane5.html|title=ESA Gives Astrium $150M To Continue Ariane 5 ME Work }}</ref>

On 21 November 2012 ESA agreed to continue with the Ariane 5 ME, rather than more rapidly develop an Ariane 6 design to meet the challenge of lower priced competitors such as the [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9]]. The Ariane 5 ME would have development costs of $2bn and should reduce launch costs by up to 20% compared to Ariane 5 ECA and ES models when launching two satellites of 5 tonnes each to GTO. It was agreed the Vinci upper stage would be used as the second stage of a new Ariane 6, and further commonality would be sought.<ref name=sfn-20121121/><ref name=bbc-20121119>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20389148 |title=SpaceX CEO Elon Musk: Europe's rocket 'has no chance' |author=Jonathan Amos |publisher=BBC |date=19 November 2012 |accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref>

===Solid propellant stage===
Work on the Ariane 5 EAP motors have been continued in the [[Vega (launcher)|Vega]] programme.
The Vega 1st stage engine—the [[P80 (stage)|P80]] engine—is a shorter derivation of the EAP. The P80 booster casing is made of filament wound graphite epoxy, much lighter than the current stainless steel casing. A new composite steerable nozzle has been developed while new thermal insulation material and a narrower throat improve the expansion ratio and subsequently the overall performance. Additionally, the nozzle now has electromechanical actuators which have replaced the heavier hydraulic ones used for thrust vector control.

These developments will probably later make their way back into the Ariane programme.<ref name=sfn-20121121>{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1211/21ariane/ |title=European ministers decide to stick with Ariane 5, for now |author=Stephen Clark |publisher=Spaceflight Now |date=21 November 2012 |accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref><ref>

===Ariane 6===
ESA has finalised the design of the next generation rocket, {{nowrap|Ariane 6}}. A smaller more flexible rocket due to the reduction in liquid fuel, featuring the same payload fairing diameter as the Ariane 5 ME and capable of launching a single satellite of 3 to 6.5 tonnes to a geostationary transfer orbit. The design uses three stages, the first stage has motors in a line rather than the more conventional cluster arrangement, the second stage will use a single motor mounted above the first stage, the third stage will be a restartable liquid fueled [[Vinci (rocket engine)|Vinci]] engine to allow for complex orbits. The four motors of the first and second stage will each utilise 135 tonnes of solid propellant. In 2012 detailed definition studies were funded.<ref name=sfn-20121121/><ref name=bbc-20121123>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20464639 |title=Ariane rocket ready to do battle |author=Jonathan Amos |publisher=BBC |date=23 November 2012 |accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> ESA will in 2014 decide on full funding, which could lead to a launch around 2021. The chairman the [[German Aerospace Center]] commented that while building {{nowrap|Ariane 6}} in one location would be much more efficient, but "then it is no longer a European launcher. It is a French or German launcher. Therefore, the discussion about industrial distribution is one of the core questions for the next launcher in Europe. It is hard stuff."<ref name=sfn-20121121/>

A new launch pad location in [[French Guiana]] has been selected, and completion of the {{nowrap|Ariane 6}} design in July 2013 is expected to kick off design of the launch pad.  CNES is aiming to launch the {{nowrap|Ariane 6}} a minimum of eight times each year, with a goal of supporting twelve annual launches.<ref name=sn20130524a/>

The target "production and operations [[cost]]" for the launch system is 70 million Euros per launch, a 30% reduction in the cost of launching an equivalent 6 tonne payload on the Ariane 5 although this is not necessarily the launch [[price]] at which Ariane launches will be offered to launch customers.<ref name=sn20130524a>

==Notable launches==
[[File:Ariane 5 10 2007.ogg|thumb|Launch of the 34th Ariane 5 at [[Guiana Space Centre|Kourou]]]]

Ariane 5's first test flight ([[Ariane 5 Flight 501]]) on 4 June 1996 failed, with the rocket self-destructing 37 seconds after launch because of a malfunction in the control software.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/software/coolapps/news/2005/11/69355?currentPage=2 Wired.com: "History's Worst Software Bugs"] ''(Retrieved 3 September 2009)''</ref> A data conversion from 64-[[bit]] [[floating point]] value to 16-bit [[Signedness|signed]] [[integer]] value to be stored in a variable representing horizontal bias caused a processor trap (operand error)<ref name="esamultimedia.esa.int">Ariane 5 Flight 501 Failure, Report by the Inquiry Board http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/esa-x-1819eng.pdf</ref> because the floating point value was too large to be represented by a 16-bit signed integer. The software was originally written for the Ariane 4 where efficiency considerations (the computer running the software had an 80% maximum workload requirement<ref name="esamultimedia.esa.int"/>) led to four variables being protected with a handler while three others, including the horizontal bias variable, were left unprotected because it was thought that they were "physically limited or that there was a large margin of error".<ref name="esamultimedia.esa.int"/> The software, written in [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], was included in the Ariane 5 through the reuse of an entire Ariane 4 subsystem despite the fact that the particular software containing the bug, which was just a part of the subsystem, was not required by the Ariane 5 because it has a different preparation sequence<ref name="esamultimedia.esa.int"/> than the Ariane 4.

The second test flight (L502, on 30 October 1997) was a partial failure. The Vulcain nozzle caused a roll problem, leading to premature shutdown of the core stage. The upper stage operated successfully, but it could not reach the intended orbit.

A subsequent test flight (L503, on 21 October 1998) proved successful and the first commercial launch (L504) occurred on 10 December 1999 with the launch of the [[XMM-Newton]] X-ray observatory satellite.

Another partial failure occurred on 12 July 2001, with the delivery of two satellites into an incorrect orbit, at only half the height of the intended GTO. The ESA [[Artemis (satellite)|Artemis]] [[telecommunications satellite]] was able to reach its intended orbit on 31 January 2003, through the use of its experimental [[ion propulsion]] system.

The next launch did not occur until 1 March 2002, when the [[Envisat]] [[environmental satellite]] successfully reached an orbit {{nowrap|800 km}} above the Earth in the 11th launch. At {{nowrap|8111 kg}}, it was the heaviest single payload until the launch of the [[Jules_Verne_ATV|first ATV]] on March 9, 2008 (19,360&nbsp;kg).

The first launch of the ECA variant on 11 December 2002 ended in failure when a main booster problem caused the rocket to veer off-course, forcing its self-destruction three minutes into the flight. Its payload of two communications satellites (Stentor and [[Hot Bird]] 7), valued at about EUR 630 million, was lost in the ocean. The fault was determined to have been caused by a leak in coolant pipes allowing the nozzle to overheat. After this failure, Arianespace SA delayed the expected January 2003 launch for the [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta]] mission to 26 February 2004, but this was again delayed to early March 2004 due to a minor fault in the foam that protects the cryogenic tanks on the Ariane 5. As of June 2013, the failure of the first ECA launch was the last failure of an Ariane 5; since then, all subsequent launches have been successful, with 57 consecutive successes that stretch back to 9 April 2003 with the launch of [[INSAT-3A]] and [[Galaxy 12]] satellites.

On 27 September 2003 the last Ariane 5 G boosted three satellites (including the first European lunar probe, [[SMART-1]]), in Flight 162. On 18 July 2004 an Ariane 5 G+ boosted what was at the time the heaviest telecommunication satellite ever, [[Anik (satellite)|Anik]] F2, weighing almost {{nowrap|6,000 kg}}.

The first successful launch of the Ariane 5 ECA took place on 12 February 2005. The payload consisted of the XTAR-EUR military communications satellite, a 'SLOSHSAT' small scientific satellite and a MaqSat B2 payload simulator. The launch had been originally scheduled for October 2004, but additional testing and the military requiring a launch at that time (of an [[Helios 2A]] observation satellite) delayed the attempt.

On 11 August 2005, the first Ariane 5GS (featuring the Ariane 5 ECA's improved solid motors) boosted Thaïcom-4/iPStar-1, the heaviest telecommunications satellite to date at {{nowrap|6,505 kg}},<ref>[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/ipstar-1.htm Gunter's Space Page–Information on Launch vehicles, Satellites, Space Shuttle and Astronautics]</ref> into orbit.

On 16 November 2005, the third Ariane 5 ECA launch (the second successful ECA launch) took place. It carried a dual payload consisting of [[SPACEWAY-2|Spaceway-F2]] for [[DirecTV]] and Telkom-2 for PT Telekomunikasi of Indonesia. This was the rocket's heaviest dual payload to date, at more than {{nowrap|8,000 kg}}.

On 27 May 2006, an Ariane 5 ECA rocket set a new commercial payload lifting record of 8.2 tonnes. The dual-payload consisted of the [[Thaicom 5]] and [[Satmex 6]] satellites.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5024352.stm |title=Ariane lifts record dual payload |date=May 27, 2006 |publisher=BBC NEWS}}</ref>

On 4 May 2007 the Ariane 5 ECA set another new commercial record, lifting into transfer orbit the [[Astra 1L]] and Galaxy 17 communication satellites with a combined weight of 8.6 tonnes, and a total payload weight of 9.4 tonnes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMOPTU681F_index_0.html |title=Ariane 5 – second launch of six in 2007 |date=May 5, 2007 |publisher=ESA}}</ref> This record was again broken by another Ariane 5 ECA, launching the [[Skynet 5B]] and [[Star One C1]] satellites, on 11 November 2007. The total payload weight for this launch was {{nowrap|9,535 kg}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM9V953R8F_index_0.html |title=Ariane 5 – fifth launch of six in 2007 |date=November 11, 2007 |publisher=ESA}}</ref>

On 9 March 2008, the first Ariane 5 ES-ATV was launched to deliver the first [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]] called ''[[Jules Verne ATV|Jules Verne]]'' to the [[International Space Station]]. The ATV was the heaviest payload ever launched by a European rocket, providing supplies to the space station with necessary propellant, water, air and dry cargo. This was the first operational Ariane mission which involved an engine restart in the upper stage. (The ES-ATV Aestus EPS upper stage was restartable while the ECA HM7-B engine was not.)

On 1 July 2009, an Ariane 5 ECA launched [[TerreStar-1]], the largest commercial telecommunication satellite ever built.

On 28 October 2010, an Ariane 5 ECA launched [[Eutelsat]]'s [[Eutelsat W3B|W3B]] (part of its [[W Series]] of satellites) and [[Broadcasting Satellite System Corporation]] (B-SAT)'s [[BSAT-3b]] satellites into orbit. However, the W3B satellite failed to operate shortly after the successful launch and was written off as a total loss due to an oxidizer leak in the satellite's main propulsion system.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=Eutelsat Communications |date=29 October 2010 |language= |title=EUTELSAT STATEMENT on LOSS OF W3B SATELLITE |url=http://www.eutelsat.com/news/compress/en/2010/html/PR4810W3Bloss-post-launch/PR4810W3Bloss-post-launch.html |accessdate=30 October 2010 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101101210414/http://www.eutelsat.com/news/compress/en/2010/html/PR4810W3Bloss-post-launch/PR4810W3Bloss-post-launch.html| archivedate= 1 November 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The BSAT-3b satellite, however, is operating normally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2010/1104-SS-bsatOK.html |title=All Systems Are Nominal Aboard Lockheed Martin Bsat-3b Satellite Following Oct. 28 Launch |date=2010-11-04 |publisher=Lockheed Martin}}</ref>

On 22 April 2011, the Ariane 5 ECA flight VA-201 broke a commercial record, lifting Yahsat 1A and Intelsat New Dawn with a total payload weight of 10,064&nbsp;kg to transfer orbit.<ref name="arianespace1">{{cite web| url = http://www.arianespace.com/news-press-release/2011/4-22-2011-mission-success.asp | title =  Arianespace launch a success: Yahsat Y1A and Intelsat New Dawn in orbit | date = April 22, 2011 | publisher = Arianespace}}</ref> This record was later broken again during the launch of Ariane 5 ECA flight VA-208 on 2 August 2012, lifting a total of 10,182&nbsp;kg into the planned geosynchronous transfer orbit.<ref name="ariane_va-208">{{cite web| url = http://www.arianespace.com/news-press-release/2012/va208-success.asp | title =  Arianespace launch a success: Ariane 5 ECA orbits INTELSAT 20 and HYLAS 2 satellites | date = August 2, 2012 | publisher = Arianespace}}</ref>
