'''Colossae''' or '''Colosse''' (also known as '''Chonae''' or ''' Kona'''; [[Greek language|Greek]]:  [[wikt: Κολοσσαί|Κολοσσαί]], Χωναί/Χῶναι), was an ancient city of [[Phrygia]], on the [[Lycus (river of Phrygia)|Lycus]], which is a tributary of the [[Maeander River]]. It was situated about 12 miles South East of [[Laodicea on the Lycus|Laodicea]], and near the great road from [[Ephesus]] to the [[Euphrates]]. The site, located near the modern town of [[Honaz]] in [[Turkey]], has never been excavated.

==History==
In 396 BC, during the [[Persian Wars]], the satrap [[Tissaphernes]] was lured to Colossae and slain by an agent of the party of [[Cyrus the Younger]]. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] tells that the wool of Colossae gave its name (''colossinus'') to the colour of the [[cyclamen]] flower. During the [[Hellenistic]] period, the town was of some mercantile importance, although by the 1st century it had dwindled greatly in size and significance.

It does not appear that [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] had visited this city when he wrote his [[Epistle to the Colossians]] ({{bibleverse||Col.|1:2|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Col.|2:1|ESV}}), since he tells [[Philemon of Colossae|Philemon]] of his hope to visit it upon being freed from prison (see [[Philemon 1:22]]). It seems that [[Epaphras]] was the founder of the [[Colossian church]] (see {{bibleverse||Col.|1:7|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Col.|4:12|KJV}}).

This town fell into decay (possibly due to an earthquake) and the Byzantine town of Chonæ occupied a site near its ruins. A look at the classical, Byzantine, and otherwise medieval literature mentioning the site reveals a name change for part or all of Colossae to Cona or Chonae. The town was the birthplace of the Byzantine Greek writers [[Nicetas Choniates|Nicetas]] and [[Michael Choniates]]. In 1206–1230, it was ruled by [[Manuel Maurozomes]].

Chonæ was made an archbishopric about 858-60, and in some later episcopal notices appears as a metropolis.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04131a.htm Catholic encyclopedia: ''Colossæ'']</ref>

In Byzantine and Russian art, the theme of the ''Miracle of the Archangel Michael at Chonae'' (''Τὸ ἐν Χωναῖς/Χῶναις Θαῦμα τοῦ Ἀρχαγγέλου Μιχαήλ'') is intimately linked with the site.  [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Sacred Tradition|tradition]] tells that the [[paganism|pagans]] directed the stream of a river against the sanctuary of St. Michael there to destroy it, but [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] appeared and split the rock by lightning to give a new bed to the stream, diverting the flow away from the church and sanctifying forever the waters which came from the gorge. The Orthodox celebrate a feast in commemoration of this event on 6 September. The [[Chudov Monastery|Monastery of the Miracle]] (Chudov Monastery) in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], where the Russian [[Tsar]]s were [[baptism|baptized]], was dedicated to the Feast of the Miracle at Kona.

The 5th- to 7th-century texts that refer to the miracle at Chonae formed the basis of specific paradigms for "properly approaching" angelic intermediaries for more effective prayers within the Christian culture.<ref>''Subtle bodies: representing angels in Byzantium'' by Glenn Peers 2001 Univ of Calif Press ISBN 0-520-22405-1 page 144 [http://books.google.com/books?id=kaonEi_dCJIC&pg=PA143&dq=Chonae+michael+miracle+university+california&hl=en&ei=CTq-Tsy6EczqOa-SpdMB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref>
