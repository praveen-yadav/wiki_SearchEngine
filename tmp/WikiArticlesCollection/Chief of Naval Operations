The '''Chief of Naval Operations''' ('''CNO''') is a statutory office ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|5033}}) held by a four-star admiral in the [[United States Navy]], and is the most senior naval officer assigned to serve in the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]]. The office is a military adviser and deputy to the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]]. In a separate capacity as a member of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|151}}) the CNO is a military adviser to the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], the [[United States Homeland Security Council|Homeland Security Council]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], and the [[President of the United States|President]]. The current Chief of Naval Operations is Admiral [[Jonathan W. Greenert]].

The Chief of Naval Operations is an administrative position based in [[the Pentagon]], and while the CNO ''does not have operational command authority'' over Naval forces as the title implies (that is nowadays within the purview of the [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commanders]] who report to the Secretary of Defense), the CNO ''does exercise supervision'' of Navy organizations as the designee of the Secretary of the Navy.

==Responsibilities==

===Department of the Navy===
The CNO reports directly to the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] for the command, utilization of resources and operating efficiency of the operating forces of the Navy and of the Navy shore activities assigned by the Secretary.<ref name="a">{{cite web|title=The US Navy|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/leadership/cno_resp.asp|accessdate=24 September 2007}}</ref> Under the authority of the Secretary of the Navy, the CNO also designates naval personnel and naval resources to the commanders of [[Unified Combatant Command]]s.<ref name="authority">[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00005013----000-.html#f] 10 USC 5013(f). Secretary of the Navy</ref><ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000165----000-.html] 10 USC 165. Combatant commands: administration and support</ref> The CNO also performs all other functions prescribed under {{UnitedStatesCode|10|5033}} and those assigned by the secretary<ref name="authority"/> or delegates those duties and responsibilities to other officers in his administration under his name. The CNO is typically the highest-ranking officer on [[active-duty]] in the Navy unless the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman]] and/or the [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] are naval officers. Like the other joint chiefs, the CNO is an administrative position and has no operational command authority over United States naval forces.<ref name="a"/>

==Office of the Chief of Naval Operations==
The Chief of Naval Operations presides over the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OpNav),<ref>[https://navcms.news.navy.mil/navydata/leadership/cno_resp.asp navy.mil] Chief of Naval Operations − Responsibilities. Retrieved 3 July 2010.</ref> which is one of three headquarters staffs in Department of the Navy (the others being the [[Office of the Secretary of the Navy]] and [[Headquarters Marine Corps]].)

Policy documents are issued in the form of [[OPNAV Instruction]]s.

==Appointment==
The Chief of Naval Operations is nominated by the President for appointment and must be confirmed via majority vote by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].<ref name="CNO">{{cite web|title=10 USC 5033. Chief of Naval Operations|url= http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00005033----000-.html|accessdate=24 September 2007}}</ref> A requirement for being Chief of Naval Operations is having significant experience in joint duty assignments, which includes at least one full tour of duty in a joint duty assignment as a flag officer.<ref name="CNO"/> However, the president may waive those requirements if he determines the officer is necessary for national interest.<ref name="CNO"/> By statute, the CNO is appointed as a four-star [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]].<ref name="CNO"/>

==Former Official Residence==
[[Number One Observatory Circle]], located on the northeast grounds of the [[United States Naval Observatory]] in Washington, DC, was built in 1893 for its superintendent. The Chief of Naval Operations liked the house so much that in 1923 he took over the house as his own [[official residence]]. It remained the residence of the CNO until 1974, when [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized its transformation to an official residence for the  Vice President.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/vp_residence/ |title=The Vice President's Residence}}</ref>

==List of Chiefs of Naval Operations (1915 – present)==
The position of CNO replaced the position of Aide for Naval Operations, which was a position established by regulation rather than statutory law.
