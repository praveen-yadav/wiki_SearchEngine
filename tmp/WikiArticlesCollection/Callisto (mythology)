In [[Greek mythology]], '''Callisto''' or '''Kallisto''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|s|t|oʊ}}; {{lang-el|Καλλιστώ}} {{IPA-el|kallisˈtɔː|}}) was a [[nymph]] of [[Artemis]]. Transformed into a bear and [[Catasterismi|set among the stars]], she was the bear-mother of the [[Arcadia]]ns, through her son [[Arcas]].

==Origin of the myth==

The name ''Kalliste'' (Καλλίστη), "most beautiful", may be recognized as an epithet of the goddess herself, though none of the inscriptions at Athens that record priests of ''Artemis Kalliste'' (Άρτεμις Καλλίστη), date before the third century BCE.<ref>Daniel J. Geagan. "The Athenian Constitution After Sulla" (''Hesperia Supplements'' '''12''' 1967:72, 95).</ref> Artemis Kalliste was worshipped in Athens in a shrine which lay outside the Dipylon gate, by the side of the road to the [[Academy]].<ref>''Klio: Beiträge zur alten Geschichte'' (Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin Institut für Griechisch-Römische Altertumskunde) 1907.</ref> W. S. Ferguson suggested<ref>In ''Klio'' '''7''' (1907:213f).</ref> that Artemis Soteira and Artemis Kalliste were joined in a common cult administered by a single priest. The bearlike character of Artemis herself was a feature of the [[Brauronia]]. 

The myth in ''[[Catasterismi]]'' may be derived from the fact that a set of constellations appear close together in the sky, in and near the [[Zodiac]] sign of [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], namely Ursa Minor, Ursa Major, [[Boötes]], and [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]]. The [[Boötes|constellation Boötes]], was explicitly identified in the Hesiodic ''Astronomia'' (Αστρονομία)<ref>Hesiod, ''Astronomia'', fragment 3, preserved as a quote in a commentary on [[Aratus]].</ref> as Arcas, the "Bear-warden" (''Arktophylax''; Αρκτοφύλαξ):<ref>Thus Hesiod is quoted, though Boötes, Βοώτης, from his very name, is a ''cow'' (βοως) herdsman.</ref>
<blockquote>''He is Arkas the son of Kallisto and Zeus, and he lived in the country about Lykaion. After Zeus had seduced Kallisto, Lykaon, pretending not to know of the matter, entertained Zeus, as Hesiod says, and set before him on the table the babe [Arkas] which he had cut up.''<ref>The episode is a doublet of the serving up of [[Pelops]].</ref></blockquote>

[[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''Callisto'' is lost.

==Myth==

[[Image:Tizian 015.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]]'s ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'' (1559) portrays the moment when Callisto's pregnancy is discovered ([[National Gallery of Scotland]]).]]

As a follower of Artemis,  Callisto, who [[Hesiod]] said<ref>In his lost ''Astronomy'', quoted in ''[[Catasterismi]]''.</ref> was the daughter of [[Lycaon (mythology)|Lycaon]], king of [[Arcadia]],<ref>Other writers gave her a mortal genealogy as the daughter of one or the other of Lycaon's sons: Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]''.</ref> took a vow to remain a virgin, as did all the nymphs of Artemis. But to have her, Zeus disguised himself, Ovid says, as Artemis ([[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]) herself, in order to lure her into his embrace. Callisto was then turned into a [[bear]], as Hesiod had told it:
<blockquote>''...but afterwards, when she was already with child, was seen bathing and so discovered. Upon this, the goddess was enraged and changed her into a beast. Thus she became a bear and gave birth to a son called Arcas.''</blockquote>

Either Artemis "slew Kallisto with a shot of her silver bow,"<ref>''[[Homer#Works ascribed to Homer|Homerica, The Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'', 316 ff (trans. Hugh G. Evelyn-White).</ref> perhaps urged by the wrath of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] ([[Hera]])<ref>This was the version current in Greece when Pausanias visited in the second century CE ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], VIII.35.8).</ref> or later [[Arcas]], the eponym of [[Arcadia]], nearly killed his bear-mother, when she had wandered into the [[Temenos|forbidden precinct]] of Zeus. In every case, Zeus placed them both in the sky as the [[constellation]]s [[Ursa Major]], called ''Arktos'' (αρκτος), the "Bear", by Greeks, and [[Ursa Minor]].

According to [[Ovid]],<ref>Ovid. ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''. Book II, Lines 405-531; Ovid narrates the myth also in ''[[Fasti]]'', book II.</ref> it was [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (Zeus) who took the form of Diana (Artemis) so that he might evade his wife Juno’s detection, forcing himself upon Callisto while she was separated from Diana and the other nymphs.<ref>The transformation of Zeus, with its [[lesbian]] overtones, was rendered as comedy in a lost work by the Attic Amphis ([http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Kallisto.html Theoi Project – Kallisto]).</ref> Her pregnant condition was discovered some months later while bathing with Diana and her fellow nymphs. Upon this, Diana was enraged and expelled Callisto from the group, and subsequently she gave birth to [[Arcas]]. Juno then took the opportunity to avenge her wounded pride and transformed the nymph into a bear. Sixteen years later Callisto, still a bear, encountered her son Arcas hunting in the forest. Just as Arcas was about to kill his own mother with his javelin, Jupiter averted the tragedy by placing mother and son amongst the stars as [[Ursa Major]] and [[Ursa Minor|Minor]], respectively. Juno, enraged that her attempt at revenge had been frustrated, appealed to [[Oceanus]] that the two might never meet his waters, thus providing a poetic explanation for their [[circumpolar star|circumpolar]] positions.

The stars of Ursa Major were all circumpolar in Athens of 400 BCE, and all but the stars in the Great Bear's left foot were circumpolar in Ovid's Rome, in the first century CE. Now, however, due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]], the feet of the Great Bear constellation do sink below the horizon from Rome and especially from Athens; however, Ursa Minor (Arcas) does remain completely above the horizon, even from latitudes as far south as Honolulu and Hong Kong.
