The city is also part of the larger [[Metro Detroit|Detroit–Ann Arbor–Flint, MI]] [[Combined Statistical Area|CSA]].

Ann Arbor was founded in 1824, with one theory stating that it is named after the spouses of the city's founders and for the stands of trees in the area.<ref name="Marwil, pp. 1-2">Marwil, pp. 1–2</ref> The [[University of Michigan]] moved from Detroit to Ann Arbor in 1837, and the city showed steady growth throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, except during the [[Long Depression|Depression of 1873]]. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as a center for left-wing politics. Ann Arbor became a focal point for political activism and served as a hub for the [[American civil rights movement|civil-rights movement]] and [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], as well as various student movements.

Ann Arbor is home to the [[University of Michigan]], a world-renowned institution of higher education. The university shapes Ann Arbor's economy significantly as it employs about 30,000 workers, including about 12,000 in the [[University of Michigan Health System|medical center]]. The city's economy is also centered on high technology, with several companies drawn to the area by the university's research and development money, and by its graduates.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Midwest/Ann-Arbor-Introduction.html | title=Ann Arbor: Introduction | publisher=Advameg, Inc. | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref>

==History==

Ann Arbor was founded in 1824 by land speculators [[John Allen (pioneer)|John Allen]] and [[Elisha Rumsey]]. On May 25, 1824, the town [[plat]] was registered with Wayne County as "Annsarbour;" this represents the earliest known use of the town's name.<ref>Marwil, p. 1</ref> There are various accounts concerning the origin of the settlement's name; one states that Allen and Rumsey decided to name it for their wives, both named Ann, and for the stands of [[bur oak|burr oak]] in the {{convert|640|acre|ha}} of land they purchased for $800 from the federal government at $1.25 per acre.<ref name="Marwil, pp. 1-2"/> The local [[Ojibwe people|Ojibwa]] named the settlement ''kaw-goosh-kaw-nick'', after the sound of Allen's [[sawmill]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Michigan State Historical Society, Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society|title=Michigan History Magazine|year=1964|publisher=Michigan Historical Commission|accessdate=2008-07-31|page=31}}</ref>

Ann Arbor became the seat of Washtenaw County in 1827,<ref>Marwil, p. 4</ref> and was incorporated as a village in 1833.<ref>Marwil, p. 7</ref> The Ann Arbor Land Company, a group of speculators, set aside {{convert|40|acre|ha}} of undeveloped land and offered it to the state of Michigan as the site of the state capital, but lost the bid to [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]].

Since the university's establishment in the city in 1837, the histories of the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor have been closely linked.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/moaa/pictorial_history/1824-1859pg3 | title=1824–1859: Education.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and served as a hub for the [[American civil rights movement|civil-rights movement]] and [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], as well as the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. [[teach-in]] against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Marwil, p. 153</ref> During the ensuing 15 years, many [[counterculture|countercultural]] and [[New Left]] enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city.<ref name="history">{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/moaa/pictorial_history/1940-1974pg3 | title=1940–1974: From Protest to Outer Space.

In the past several decades, Ann Arbor has grappled with the effects of sharply rising land values, [[gentrification]], and [[urban sprawl]] stretching into outlying countryside. On November 4, 2003, voters approved a [[green belt|greenbelt]] plan under which the city government bought development rights on agricultural parcels of land adjacent to Ann Arbor to preserve them from sprawling development.<ref name="greenbelt">{{cite web | url=http://www.a2openspace.org/ | title=Ann Arbor Parks and Greenbelt Proposal | date=2 March 2004 | publisher=Friends of Ann Arbor Open Space | accessdate=2008-08-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080723184116/http://www.a2openspace.org/| archivedate= 23 July 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Since then, a vociferous local debate has hinged on how and whether to accommodate and guide development within city limits.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/05/ann_arbor_seeks_grants_for_gre.html | title=Ann Arbor seeks grants for greenbelt land | author=McGovern, Judy | date=2009-05-18 | journal=The Ann Arbor News | accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref> Ann Arbor consistently ranks in the "top places to live" lists published by various mainstream media outlets every year.

Ann Arbor has a long history of openness to marijuana, given Ann Arbor's decriminalization of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], the large number of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People's Co-op, was directly across the street from [[Michigan Stadium]] until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west), the large number of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual [[Hash Bash]]: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April. Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the City's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.annarbor.com/news/40-years-of-hash-bash-marijuana-festival-that-started-in-early-1970s-still-going-strong-in-ann-arbor/#.UB0h48gSRbM | title=40 years of Hash Bash: Marijuana festival started in 1972 in Ann Arbor stands test of time | publisher=Ann Arbor.com | date=2011-03-31 | accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref>

The streets in downtown Ann Arbor conform to a grid pattern, though this pattern is less common in the surrounding areas.
