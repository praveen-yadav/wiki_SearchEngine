'''Curium''' is a [[transuranic element|transuranic]] [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Cm''' and [[atomic number]] 96. This element of the [[actinide]] series was named after [[Marie Curie|Marie Skłodowska-Curie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] – both were known for their research on radioactivity. Curium was first intentionally produced and identified in July 1944 by the group of [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most curium is produced by bombarding [[uranium]] or [[plutonium]] with [[neutron]]s in [[nuclear reactor]]s – one [[tonne]] of spent [[nuclear fuel]] contains about 20&nbsp;grams of curium. 

Curium is a hard, dense, silvery metal with a relatively high melting point and boiling point for an actinide. Whereas it is [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|ambient conditions]], it becomes [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] upon cooling, and other magnetic transitions are also observed for many curium compounds. In compounds, curium usually exhibits [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] +3 and sometimes +4, and the +3 valence is predominant in solutions. Curium readily oxidizes, and its oxides are a dominant form of this element. It forms strongly [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] complexes with various organic compounds, but there is no evidence of its incorporation into [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. When introduced into the human body, curium accumulates in the bones, lungs and liver, where it promotes [[cancer]].

All known [[isotope]]s of curium are radioactive and have a small [[critical mass]] for a sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. They predominantly emit [[alpha radiation|α-particles]], and the heat released in this process can potentially produce electricity in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s. This application is hindered by the scarcity, high cost and radioactivity of curium isotopes. Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the <sup>238</sup>Pu [[radionuclide]] for power sources in [[artificial pacemaker]]s. It served as the [[alpha radiation|α-source]] in the [[alpha particle X-ray spectrometer]]s installed on the [[Mars Pathfinder|Sojourner]], [[Mars rover|Mars]], [[Mars 96]], [[Mars Exploration Rover|Athena]], [[Spirit rover|Spirit]] and [[Opportunity rover]]s as well as the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] to analyze the composition and structure of the rocks on the surface of [[Mars]] and the [[Moon]]. Such a spectrometer will also be used by the [[Philae lander]] of the [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]] spacecraft to probe the surface of the [[67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko]] [[comet]].

Although curium had likely been produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was [[discoveries of the chemical elements|first intentionally synthesized]], isolated and identified in 1944, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], Ralph A. James, and [[Albert Ghiorso]]. In their experiments, they used a {{convert|60|in|cm|adj=on}} [[cyclotron]].<ref>{{cite book|title = The New Chemistry: A Showcase for Modern Chemistry and Its Applications|first = Nina|last = Hall|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2000|pages = 8–9|isbn = 978-0-521-45224-3|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=U4rnzH9QbT4C&pg=PA8}}</ref>

Curium was chemically identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now [[Argonne National Laboratory]]) at the [[University of Chicago]]. It was the third [[transuranium element]] to be discovered even though it is the fourth in the series – the lighter element [[americium]] was unknown at the time.<ref name="E96">Seaborg, G.

The sample was prepared as follows: first [[plutonium]] nitrate solution was coated on a [[platinum]] foil of about 0.5&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> area, the solution was evaporated and the residue was converted into plutonium dioxide (PuO<sub>2</sub>) by [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]. Following cyclotron irradiation of the oxide, the coating was dissolved with [[nitric acid]] and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous [[ammonium hydroxide|ammonia solution]]. The residue was dissolved in [[perchloric acid]], and further separation was carried out by [[ion exchange]] to yield a certain isotope of curium. The separation of curium and americium was so painstaking that the Berkeley group initially called those elements ''[[wikt:pandemonium|pandemonium]]'' (from Greek for ''all demons'' or ''hell'') and ''[[wikt:delirium|delirium]]'' (from Latin for ''madness'').<ref name=radio/><ref>Krebs, Robert E.

The curium-242 isotope was produced in July–August 1944 by bombarding <sup>239</sup>Pu with [[alpha radiation|α-particles]] to produce curium with the release of a [[neutron]]:
: <math>\mathrm{^{239\!\,}_{\ 94}Pu\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ \longrightarrow \ ^{242}_{\ 96}Cm\ +\ ^{1}_{0}n}</math>

Curium-242 was unambiguously identified by the characteristic energy of the α-particles emitted during the decay:
: <math>\mathrm{^{242}_{\ 96}Cm\ \longrightarrow \ ^{238}_{\ 94}Pu\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He}</math>
The [[half-life]] of this [[alpha decay]] was first measured as 150 days and then corrected to 162.8 days.<ref name="nubase"/>

Another isotope <sup>240</sup>Cm was produced in a similar reaction in March 1945:
: <math>\mathrm{^{239}_{\ 94}Pu\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ \longrightarrow \ ^{240}_{\ 96}Cm\ +\ 3\ ^{1}_{0}n}</math>
The half-life of the <sup>240</sup>Cm α-decay was correctly determined as 26.7 days.<ref name="nubase"/>

The discovery of curium, as well as americium, in 1944 was closely related to the [[Manhattan Project]], the results were confidential and declassified only in 1945. Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children, the [[Quiz Kids]], five days before the official presentation at an [[American Chemical Society]] meeting on November 11, 1945, when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and [[neptunium]] had been discovered during the war.<ref name=radio>{{cite web|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/americium.html|title = Chemical & Engineering News: It's Elemental: The Periodic Table – Americium|accessdate = 07-12-2008| first = Rachel Sheremeta|last = Pepling|year = 2003}}</ref> The discovery of curium (<sup>242</sup>Cm and <sup>240</sup>Cm), their production and compounds were later patented listing only Seaborg as the inventor.<ref>Seaborg, G.

The new element was named after [[Marie Curie|Marie Skłodowska-Curie]] and her husband [[Pierre Curie]] who are noted for discovering [[radium]] and for their work in [[radioactivity]]. It followed the example of [[gadolinium]], a [[lanthanide]] element above curium in the periodic table, which was named after the explorer of the [[rare earth element]]s [[Johan Gadolin]]:<ref>Greenwood, p. 1252</ref>
::''"As the name for the element of atomic number 96 we should like to propose "curium" , with symbol Cm. The evidence indicates that element 96 contains seven 5f electrons and is thus analogous to the element gadolinium with its seven 4f electrons in the regular rare earth series. On this base element 96 is named after the Curies in a manner analogous to the naming of gadolinium, in which the chemist Gadolin was honored."<ref name="E96"/>''

The first curium samples were barely visible, and were identified by their radioactivity. Louis Werner and [[Isadore Perlman]] created the first substantial sample of 30&nbsp;µg curium-242 hydroxide at the University of California in 1947 by bombarding [[americium]]-241 with neutrons.<ref name=CRC>Hammond C.

A synthetic, radioactive element, curium is a hard dense metal with silvery-white appearance and physical and chemical properties resembling those of [[gadolinium]]. Its melting point of 1340 °C is significantly higher than that of the previous transuranic elements neptunium (637 °C), plutonium (639 °C) and americium (1173 °C). In comparison, gadolinium melts at 1312 °C. The boiling point of curium is 3110 °C. With a density of 13.52 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, curium is significantly lighter than neptunium (20.45 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) and plutonium (19.8 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), but is heavier than most other metals. Between two crystalline forms of curium, the α-Cm is more stable at ambient conditions. It has a hexagonal symmetry, [[space group]] P6<sub>3</sub>/mmc, lattice parameters ''a'' = 365 [[picometer|pm]] and ''c'' = 1182 pm, and four [[formula unit]]s per [[unit cell]].<ref name="Milman">{{cite journal|last1=Milman|first1=V|title=Crystal structures of curium compounds: an ab initio study|journal=Journal of Nuclear Materials|volume=322|issue=2–3|page=165|year=2003|doi=10.1016/S0022-3115(03)00321-0|bibcode=2003JNuM..322..165M|last2=Winkler|first2=B|last3=Pickard|first3=C.J}}</ref> The crystal consists of a double-[[Close-packing of spheres|hexagonal close packing]] with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum. At pressures above 23 [[Pascal (unit)|GPa]], at room temperature, α-Cm transforms into β-Cm, which has a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] symmetry, space group Fm{{overline|3}}m and the lattice constant ''a'' = 493 pm.<ref name = "Milman"/> Upon further compression to 43 GPa, curium transforms to an [[Orthorhombic crystal system|orthorhombic]] γ-Cm structure similar to that of α-uranium, with no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa.

Curium has peculiar magnetic properties. Whereas its neighbor element americium shows no deviation from [[Curie–Weiss law|Curie-Weiss]] [[paramagnetism]] in the entire temperature range, α-Cm transforms to an [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] state upon cooling to 65–52 K,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kanellakopulos|first1=B|title=The magnetic susceptibility of Americium and curium metal|journal=Solid State Communications|volume=17|issue=6|page=713|year=1975|doi=10.1016/0038-1098(75)90392-0|bibcode = 1975SSCom..17..713K|last2=Blaise|first2=A.|last3=Fournier|first3=J.M.|last4=Müller|first4=W. }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fournier|first1=J|title=Curium: A new magnetic element|journal=Physica B+C|volume=86–88|page=30|year=1977|doi=10.1016/0378-4363(77)90214-5|bibcode = 1977PhyBC..86...30F|last2=Blaise|first2=A.|last3=Muller|first3=W.|last4=Spirlet|first4=J.-C. }}</ref> and β-Cm exhibits a [[Ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnetic]] transition at about 205 K.

Similarly, the lanthanide analogue of curium, gadolinium, as well as its pnictides also show magnetic transitions upon cooling, but the transition character is somewhat different: Gd and GdN become ferromagnetic, and GdP, GdAs and GdSb show antiferromagnetic ordering.<ref>Nave, S.

In accordance with magnetic data, electrical resistivity of curium increases with temperature – about twice between 4 and 60 K – and then remains nearly constant up to room temperature. There is a significant increase in resistvity over time (about 10 µΩ·cm/h) due to self-damage of the crystal lattice by alpha radiation. This makes uncertain the absolute resistivity value for curium (about 125 µΩ·cm). The resistivity of curium is similar to that of gadolinium and of the actinides plutonium and neptunium, but is significantly higher than that of americium, uranium, [[polonium]] and [[thorium]].<ref name=res/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schenkel|first1=R|title=The electrical resistivity of 244Cm metal|journal=Solid State Communications|volume=23|issue=6|page=389|year=1977|doi=10.1016/0038-1098(77)90239-3|bibcode = 1977SSCom..23..389S }}</ref>

These can be used in [[thermal-neutron reactor]]s, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for [[fast breeder reactor]]s since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases.<ref name="irsn">Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire: [http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/transport/doc/irsn_sect03_146.pdf "Evaluation of nuclear criticality safety. data and limits for actinides in transport"], p. 16</ref> The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of <sup>248</sup>Cm will create [[californium]]. This is strong [[neutron]] emitter, and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the [[minor actinides]] are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.<ref>{{cite book|author=National Research Council (U.S.).

The table to the right lists the [[critical mass]]es for curium isotopes for a sphere, without a moderator and reflector. With a metal reflector (30&nbsp;cm of steel), the critical masses of the odd isotopes are about 3–4&nbsp;kg. When using water (thickness ~20–30&nbsp;cm) as the reflector, the critical mass can be as small as 59&nbsp;gram for <sup>245</sup>Cm, 155&nbsp;gram for <sup>243</sup>Cm and 1550&nbsp;gram for <sup>247</sup>Cm. There is a significant uncertainty in these critical mass values. Whereas it is usually of the order 20%, the values for <sup>242</sup>Cm and <sup>246</sup>Cm were listed as large as 371&nbsp;kg and 70.1&nbsp;kg, respectively, by some research groups.<ref name="irsn"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Okundo, H. and Kawasaki, H.  |title=Critical and Subcritical Mass Calculations of Curium-243 to −247 Based on JENDL-3.2 for Revision of ANSI/ANS-8.15|journal=Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology|year=2002|volume=39|pages=1072–1085|doi=10.3327/jnst.39.1072|issue=10}}</ref>

===Occurrence===
[[File:Ivy Mike - mushroom cloud.jpg|thumb|Several isotopes of curium were detected in the fallout from the ''Ivy Mike'' nuclear test.]]
The longest-lived isotope of curium, <sup>247</sup>Cm, has a half-life of 15.6 million years. Therefore, all [[primordial nuclide|primordial]] curium, that is curium present on the Earth during its formation, should have decayed by now. Curium is produced artificially, in small quantities for research purposes. Furthermore, it occurs in spent [[nuclear fuel]]. Curium is present in nature in certain areas used for the atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons tests]], which were conducted between 1945 and 1980.<ref name="lenntech">[http://www.lenntech.de/pse/pse.htm Curium] (in German)</ref> So the analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. [[hydrogen bomb]], [[Ivy Mike]], (1 November 1952, [[Enewetak Atoll]]), beside [[einsteinium]], [[fermium]], [[plutonium]] and [[americium]] also revealed isotopes of berkelium, californium and curium, in particular <sup>245</sup>Cm, <sup>246</sup>Cm and smaller quantities of <sup>247</sup>Cm, <sup>248</sup>Cm and <sup>249</sup>Cm.

Atmospheric curium compounds are poorly soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 4,000 times higher concentration of curium at the sandy soil particles than in water present in the soil pores. An even higher ratio of about 18,000 was measured in [[loam]] soils.<ref name=LA2/>

A few atoms of curium can be produced by [[Neutron capture|neutron capture reactions]] and [[beta decay]] in very highly concentrated [[uranium]]-bearing deposits.<ref name="emsley">{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|edition=New|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7}}</ref>

==Synthesis==

===Isotope preparation===
Curium is produced in small quantities in [[nuclear reactor]]s, and by now only kilograms of it have been accumulated for the <sup>242</sup>Cm and <sup>244</sup>Cm and grams or even milligrams for heavier isotopes. This explains the high price of curium, which has been be quoted at 160–185 [[United States dollar|USD]] per milligram,<ref name=CRC/> with a more recent estimate at 2,000 USD/g for <sup>242</sup>Cm and 170 USD/g for <sup>244</sup>Cm.<ref name=lect/> In nuclear reactors, curium is formed from <sup>238</sup>U in a series of nuclear reactions. In the first chain, <sup>238</sup>U captures a neutron and converts into <sup>239</sup>U, which via [[beta decay|β<sup>–</sup> decay]] transforms into <sup>239</sup>Np and <sup>239</sup>Pu.

Further neutron capture followed by β<sup>–</sup>-decay produces the <sup>241</sup>Am isotope of [[americium]] which further converts into <sup>242</sup>Cm:

For research purposes, curium is obtained by irradiating not uranium but plutonium, which is available in large amounts from spent nuclear fuel. Much higher neutron flux is used for the irradiation that results in a different reaction chain and formation of <sup>244</sup>Cm:<ref name = "Morrs">Morss, L. R.; Edelstein, N. M. and Fugere, J.

Curium-244 decays into <sup>240</sup>Pu by emission of alpha particle, but it also absorbs neutrons resulting in a small amount of heavier curium isotopes. Among those, <sup>247</sup>Cm and <sup>248</sup>Cm are popular in scientific research because of their long half-lives. However, the production rate of <sup>247</sup>Cm in thermal neutron reactors is relatively low because of it is prone to undergo fission induced by thermal neutrons.<ref name=haire/> Synthesis of <sup>250</sup>Cm via [[neutron absorption]] is also rather unlikely because of the short half-life of the intermediate product <sup>249</sup>Cm (64 min), which converts by β<sup>–</sup> decay to the [[berkelium]] isotope <sup>249</sup>Bk.<ref name=haire/>
<!-- Curium-250 is obtained instead from the α-decay of <sup>254</sup>Cf. For this however, the production rate is low as <sup>254</sup>Cf decays mainly by spontaneous fission, and only slightly by emission of α-particles into <sup>250</sup>Cm.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} -->

The above cascade of (n,γ) reactions produces a mixture of different curium isotopes. Their post-synthesis separation is cumbersome, and therefore a selective synthesis is desired. Curium-248 is favored for research purposes because of its long half-life. The most efficient preparation method of this isotope is via α-decay of the [[californium]] isotope <sup>252</sup>Cf, which is available in relatively large quantities due to its long half-life (2.65 years). About 35–50&nbsp;mg of <sup>248</sup>Cm is being produced by this method every year. The associated reaction produces <sup>248</sup>Cm with isotopic purity of 97%.<ref name=haire>{{cite book

Most synthesis routines yield a mixture of different actinide isotopes as [[oxide]]s, from which a certain isotope of curium needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. [[MOX fuel]]) in [[nitric acid]], and remove the bulk of the uranium and plutonium using a [[PUREX]] ('''P'''lutonium – '''UR'''anium '''EX'''traction) type extraction with [[tributyl phosphate]] in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue ([[raffinate]]) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, a mixture of trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step [[chromatographic]] and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent.<ref>Penneman, pp. 34–48</ref> [[BTBP|''Bis''-triazinyl bipyridine]] complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Magnusson D, Christiansen B, Foreman MRS, Geist A, Glatz JP, Malmbeck R, Modolo G, Serrano-Purroy D and Sorel C|journal = Solvent Extraction and Ion Exchange|year = 2009|volume = 27|issue = 2|page = 97|doi = 10.1080/07366290802672204|title = Demonstration of a SANEX Process in [[centrifugal extractor|Centrifugal Contactors]] using the CyMe4-BTBP Molecule on a Genuine Fuel Solution}}</ref> Separation of curium from a very similar americium can also be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous [[sodium bicarbonate]] with [[ozone]] at elevated temperature.

==Applications==

===Radionuclides===
[[File:Curium self-glow radiation.jpg|thumb|right|The radiation from curium is so strong that the metal glows purple in the dark.]]
Curium is one of the most radioactive isolable elements. Its two most common isotopes <sup>242</sup>Cm and <sup>244</sup>Cm are strong alpha emitters (energy 6 MeV); they have relatively short half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, and produce as much as 120 W/g and 3 W/g of thermal energy, respectively.<ref name=CRC/><ref name="Binder">Binder, Harry H.: ''Lexikon der chemischen Elemente'', S. Hirzel Verlag, Stuttgart 1999, ISBN 3-7776-0736-3, pp.&nbsp;174–178.</ref><ref>''Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry'', System No. 71, Volume 7a, transuranics, Part A2, p. 289</ref> Therefore, curium can be used in its common oxide form in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s like those in spacecraft. This application has been studied for the <sup>244</sup>Cm isotope, while <sup>242</sup>Cm was abandoned due to its prohibitive price of around 2000 USD/g. Curium-243 with a ~30 year half-life and good energy yield of ~1.6 W/g could make for a suitable fuel, but it produces significant amounts of harmful [[Gamma ray|gamma]] and [[Beta ray|beta]] radiation from radioactive decay products. Though as an α-emitter, <sup>244</sup>Cm requires a much thinner radiation protection shielding, it has a high spontaneous fission rate, and thus the neutron and gamma radiation rate are relatively strong. As compared to a competing thermoelectric generator isotope such as <sup>238</sup>Pu, <sup>244</sup>Cm emits a 500 time greater fluence of neutrons, and its higher gamma emission requires a shield that is 20 times thicker — about 2&nbsp;inches of lead for a 1&nbsp;kW source, as compared to 0.1 in for <sup>238</sup>Pu. Therefore this application of curium is currently considered impractical.<ref name=lect>[http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/neep602/SPRING00/lecture5.pdf Basic elements of static RTGs], G.L. Kulcinski, NEEP 602 Course Notes (Spring 2000), Nuclear Power in Space, University of Wisconsin Fusion Technology Institute (see last page)</ref>

A more promising application of <sup>242</sup>Cm is to produce <sup>238</sup>Pu, a more suitable radioisotope for thermoelectric generators such as in cardiac pacemakers. The alternative routes to <sup>238</sup>Pu use the (n,γ) reaction of <sup>237</sup>Np, or the [[deuteron]] bombardment of uranium, which both always produce <sup>236</sup>Pu as an undesired by-product — since the latter decays to <sup>208</sup>Tl with strong gamma emission.<ref>[http://www.kronenberg.kernchemie.de/ Kronenberg, Andreas], [http://www.kernenergie-wissen.de/pu-batterien.html Plutonium-Batterien] (in German)</ref>

Curium is also a common starting material for the production of higher [[transuranic elements]] and [[transactinides]]. Thus, bombardment of <sup>248</sup>Cm with oxygen (<sup>18</sup>O) or magnesium (<sup>26</sup>Mg) yielded certain isotopes of [[seaborgium]] (<sup>265</sup>Sg) and [[hassium]] (<sup>269</sup>Hs and <sup>270</sup>Hs).<ref name="HOWI_1980">Holleman, pp. 1980–1981.</ref> Californium was discovered when a microgram-sized target of curium-242 was irradiated with 35&nbsp;MeV [[alpha particle]]s using the {{convert|60|in|cm|adj=on}} cyclotron at Berkeley:

===X-ray spectrometer===
The most practical application of <sup>244</sup>Cm — though rather limited in total volume — is as α-particle source in the [[alpha particle X-ray spectrometer]]s (APXS). These instruments were installed on the [[Mars Pathfinder|Sojourner]], [[Mars rover|Mars]], [[Mars 96]], [[Spirit rover|Spirit]], [[Mars Exploration Rover|Athena]] and [[Opportunity rover]]s, as well as the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] to analyze the composition and structure of the rocks on the surface of planet [[Mars]].<ref>{{cite journal|bibcode=1996DPS....28.0221R|title=An Alpha Proton X-Ray Spectrometer for Mars-96 and Mars Pathfinder|author=Rieder, R.; Wanke, H.; Economou, T.|journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society|volume=28|page=1062|date=09/1996|last2=Wanke|last3=Economou}}</ref> APXS was also used in the [[Surveyor Program|Surveyor 5–7]] moon probes but with a <sup>242</sup>Cm source.<ref name=LA2>[http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/curium.pdf Human Health Fact Sheet on Curium], Los Alamos National Laboratory</ref><ref>Leitenberger, Bernd [http://www.bernd-leitenberger.de/surveyor.shtml Die Surveyor Raumsonden] (in German)</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-480/ch9.htm |author=Nicks, Oran |

An elaborated APXS setup is equipped with a sensor head containing six curium sources having the total radioactive decay rate of several tens of [[curie|millicuries]] (roughly a [[Becquerel|gigabecquerel]]). The sources are collimated on the sample, and the energy spectra of the alpha particles and protons scattered from the sample are analyzed (the proton analysis is implemented only in some spectrometers). These spectra contain quantitative information on all major elements in the samples except for hydrogen, helium and lithium.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060302040531/http://athena.cornell.edu/pdf/tb_apxs.pdf Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS)], Cornell University</ref> An APXS will also be used by the [[Philae lander]] of the [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]] spacecraft to probe the surface of the [[67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko]] [[comet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernd-leitenberger.de/philae.shtml |title=Der Rosetta Lander Philae |publisher=Bernd-leitenberger.de |date=2003-07-01 |accessdate=2011-03-25}}</ref>

==Safety==
Owing to its high radioactivity, curium and its compounds must be handled in appropriate laboratories under special arrangements. Whereas curium itself mostly emits α-particles which are absorbed by thin layers of common materials, some of its decay products emit significant fractions of beta and gamma radiation, which require a more elaborate protection.<ref Name="lenntech"/> If consumed, curium is excreted within a few days and only 0.05% is absorbed in the blood. From there, about 45% goes to the [[liver]], 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. In the bone, curium accumulates on the inside of the interfaces to the [[bone marrow]] and does not significantly redistribute with time; its radiation destroys [[bone marrow]] and thus stops [[red blood cell]] creation. The [[biological half-life]] of curium is about 20 years in the liver and 50 years in the bones.<ref Name="lenntech"/><ref name=LA2/> Curium is absorbed in the body much more strongly via inhalation, and the allowed total dose of <sup>244</sup>Cm in soluble form is 0.3 μ[[Curie (unit)|C]].<ref name=CRC/> Intravenous injection of <sup>242</sup>Cm and <sup>244</sup>Cm containing solutions to rats increased the incidence of [[bone tumor]], and inhalation promoted [[Lung|pulmonary]] and [[liver cancer]].<ref name="lenntech"/>

Curium isotopes are inevitably present in spent nuclear fuel with a concentration of about 20 g/tonne.<ref>Hoffmann, K. ''Kann man Gold machen? Gauner, Gaukler und Gelehrte. Aus der Geschichte der chemischen Elemente'' (Can you make gold? Crooks, clowns and scholars. From the history of the chemical elements), Urania-Verlag, Leipzig, Jena, Berlin 1979, no ISBN, p. 233</ref> Among them, the <sup>245</sup>Cm–<sup>248</sup>Cm isotopes have decay times of thousands of years and need to be removed to neutralize the fuel for disposal.<ref>Baetslé, L.

This procedure, [[nuclear transmutation]], while well documented for other elements, is still being developed for curium.<ref name="denecke"/>
