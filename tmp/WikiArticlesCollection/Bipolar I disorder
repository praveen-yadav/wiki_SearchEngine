'''Bipolar I disorder''' (BP-I; pronounced "type one bipolar disorder") is a [[bipolar spectrum disorder]] characterized by at least one [[manic episode|manic]] or [[mixed episode]]. Bipolar I disorder sometimes occurs along with episodes of [[hypomania]] or [[major depressive episode|major depression]] as well.<ref name="Bipolar Disorder: Who’s at Risk?">{{cite web|title=Bipolar Disorder: Who’s at Risk?|url=http://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/bipolar-disorder-whos-at-risk|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref> It is a type of [[bipolar disorder]], and conforms to the classic concept of manic-depressive illness, which can include [[psychosis]] during mood episodes.<ref name="What are the types of bipolar disorder?">{{cite web|title=What are the types of bipolar disorder?|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder/page2.htm#types|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>

==DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria==
The essential feature of bipolar I disorder is a clinical course characterized by the occurrence of one or more manic episodes or mixed episodes (DSM-IV-TR, 2000).  Often, individuals have had one or more [[major depressive episode]]s.<ref name="DepressionD">{{cite web|url=http://depressiond.org/bipolar-test/|title=Online Bipolar Tests: How Much Can You Trust Them?|publisher=DepressionD|accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref> One episode of mania is sufficient enough to make the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, the patient may or may not have history of [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name="DepressionD"/> Episodes of substance-induced mood disorder due to the direct effects of a [[medication]], or other [[somatic psychology|somatic]] treatments for depression, [[drug abuse]], or [[toxin]] exposure, or of mood disorder due to a general medical condition need to be excluded before a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder can be made. In addition, the episodes must not be better accounted for by [[schizoaffective disorder]] or superimposed on [[schizophrenia]], [[schizophreniform disorder]], [[delusional disorder]], or a [[psychotic disorder]] not otherwise specified.

== Treatment ==

===Medical assessment===
Routine medical assessments are often prescribed to rule-out or identify a [[somatic]] cause for bipolar I symptoms. These tests can include [[ultrasound]]s of the head, [[x-ray computed tomography]] (CAT scan), [[electroencephalogram]], [[HIV test]], [[full blood count]], [[thyroid function test]], [[liver function test]], [[urea]] and [[creatinine]] levels and if patient is on [[lithium]], lithium levels are taken. Drug screening includes [[recreational drug]]s, particularly [[synthetic cannabinoid]]s, and exposure to toxins.

===Medication===
[[Mood stabilizer]]s are often used as part of the treatment process.
# [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]], the mainstay in the management of bipolar disorder, but it has a narrow [[therapeutic range]] and typically requires monitoring
# [[Anticonvulsant]]s, such as [[sodium valproate]], [[carbamazepine]] or [[lamotrigine]]
# [[Antipsychotic]]s, such as [[quetiapine]], [[risperidone]], [[olanzapine]] or [[aripiprazole]]
# [[Electroconvulsive therapy]], a psychiatric treatment in which [[seizure]]s are [[electrically]] induced in [[anesthetized]] patients for [[therapeutic effect]]

Some [[antidepressant]]s have been found to precipitate a manic episode.

===Patient education===
Information on the condition, importance of regular [[sleep]] patterns, routines and eating habits and the importance of [[medication compliance|compliance with medication]] as [[medical prescription|prescribed]]. [[Behavior modification]] through [[mental health counselor|counselling]] can have positive influence to help reduce the effects of risky behavior during the manic phase.

==Proposed revisions in diagnostic criteria for DSM-5==
The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) is to be released in May 2013. There are several proposed revisions to occur in the diagnostic criteria of Bipolar I Disorder and its subtypes. For Bipolar I Disorder 296.40 Most Recent Episode Hypomanic and 296.4x Most Recent Episode Manic, the proposed revision includes the following specifiers: with Psychotic Features, with Mixed Features, with Catatonic Features, with Rapid Cycling, with Anxiety (mild to severe), with Suicide Risk Severity, with Seasonal Pattern, and with Postpartum Onset. Bipolar I Disorder 296.5x Most Recent Episode Depressed will include all of the above specifiers plus the following: with Melancholic Features and with Atypical Features. The categories for specifiers will be removed in DSM-5 and part A will add “or there are at least 3 symptoms of Major Depression of which one of the symptoms is depressed mood or anhedonia. For Bipolar I Disorder 296.7 Most Recent Episode Unspecified, the listed specifiers will be removed.<ref>{{cite web|title=DSM-5 Development|url=http://www.dsm5.org/|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref>
  
The criteria for manic and hypomanic episodes in parts A & B will be edited. Part A will include “and present most of the day, nearly every day,” and part B will include “and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior.” These criteria as defined in the DSM-IV-TR have created confusion for clinicians and need to be more clearly defined.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal|title=Issues pertinent to a developmental approach to bipolar disorder in DSM-5|journal=American Psychiatric Association|year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. text revision)|year=2000|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington, DC|pages=345–392}}</ref> 

There have also been proposed revisions to part B of the diagnostic criteria for a Hypomanic Episode, which is used to diagnose For Bipolar I Disorder 296.40, Most Recent Episode Hypomanic. Part B lists "inflated self-esteem, flight of ideas, distractibility, and decreased need for sleep" as symptoms of a Hypomanic Episode. This has been confusing in the field of child psychiatry because these symptoms closely overlap with symptoms of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder).<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Note that many of the above changes are still under active consideration and are not definite.
