In [[Catholicism]], '''All Souls' Day''', also known as the '''Commemoration of All Faithful Departed''',<ref name=Third>{{cite book|last1=Armentrout|first1=Donald S. |last2=Slocum |first2=Robert Boak|title=An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y_RpbmWNfHcC&pg=PA7&dq=All+Hallows'+Eve&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RheTUMKLO4ne8wTk7ICQBA&ved=0CEoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=All%20Hallows'%20Eve&f=false|accessdate=1 November 2012 |year=1999|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|isbn=0898692113|page=7|quote='''All Faithful Departed, Commemoration of.'''

Beliefs and practices associated with All Souls' Day vary widely among Catholic churches and denominations.  

==Byzantine (Greek) Catholics and the Eastern Orthodox Churches==<!-- [[Saturday of the dead]] redirects here -->
Among [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic|Byzantine (Greek) Catholics]], there are several All Souls' Days during the year. Most of these fall on Saturday, since [[Jesus]] lay in the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb]] on [[Holy Saturday]]. These are referred to as '''Soul Saturdays.''. They occur on the following occasions:
*The Saturday of [[Paschal cycle#Pre-Lent|Meatfare Week]] (the second Saturday before [[Great Lent]])—the day before the Sunday of the Last Judgement
*The second Saturday of Great Lent
*The third Saturday of Great Lent
*The fourth Saturday of Great Lent
*[[Radonitsa]] (Monday or Tuesday after [[Thomas Sunday]])
*The Saturday before [[Pentecost]]
*Demetrius Saturday (the Saturday before the feast of [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki]]—26 October) (In all of the [[Orthodox Church]] there is a commemoration of the dead on the Saturday before the feast of [[Saint Michael the Archangel]]—8 November, instead of the Demetrius Soul Saturday)

(In the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] there is also a commemoration of the dead on the Saturday closest to the Conception of [[St. John the Baptist]]—[[September 23 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|23 September]])

(In Slavic and Greek Churches, all of the Lenten Soul Saturdays are typically observed. In some of the Churches of the Eastern Mediterranean, Meatfare Saturday, Radonitsa and the Saturday before Pentecost are typically observed.)

The feast of All Saints achieved great prominence in the ninth century, in the reign of the [[Byzantine Emperor]], [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI "the Wise"]] (886–911). His wife, Empress [[Theophano Martiniake|Theophano]]—commemorated on 16 December—lived a devout life. After her death in 893,<ref>The date in ''[[Patriarch Euthymius I of Constantinople|Vita Euthymii]]'', not printed until 1888 "makes it seem practically (though not absolutely) certain that she died on 10 Nov. 893".{{harv|Downey|1956|pp=301–305}}</ref> her husband built a church, intending to dedicate it to her. When he was forbidden to do so, he decided to dedicate it to "All Saints", so that if his wife were in fact one of the righteous, she would also be honored whenever the feast was celebrated.{{sfn|Downey|1956|pp=301-305}} According to tradition, it was Leo who expanded the feast from a commemoration of All Martyrs to a general commemoration of All Saints, whether martyrs or not.

In the late spring, the Sunday following Pentecost Sunday (50 days after Easter) is set aside as a commemoration of All Saints. All locally venerated saints, such as "[http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsLife.asp?FSID=49 All Saints of America]", "All Saints of [[Mount Athos]]", etc., is held on the second Sunday after Pentecost. The third Sunday after Pentecost may be observed for even more localized saints, such as "All Saints of [[St. Petersburg]]", or for saints of a particular type, such as [[New Martyr#New Martyrs under Ottoman rule|New Martyrs of the Turkish Yoke]]. This Sunday marks the close of the [[Paschal cycle|Paschal]] season. To the normal Sunday services are added special scriptural readings and hymns to all the saints (known and unknown) from the [[Pentecostarion]].

In addition to the Sundays mentioned above, Saturdays throughout the year are days for general commemoration of all saints, and special hymns to all saints are chanted from the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]], unless some greater [[Great Feasts|feast]] or [[saint]]'s commemoration occurs.

==Roman Catholic Church==
The Roman Catholic celebration is associated with the doctrine that the souls of the faithful who at death have not been cleansed from the temporal punishment due to [[venial sin]]s and from attachment to [[mortal sin]]s cannot immediately attain the [[beatific vision]] in [[heaven (Christianity)|heaven]], and that they may be helped to do so by [[prayer]] and by the sacrifice of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].{{sfn|Mershman|1907}} In other words, when they died, they had not yet attained full sanctification and moral perfection, a requirement for entrance into Heaven. This sanctification is carried out posthumously in [[Purgatory]].  The official name of the celebration in the  [[Roman Rite]] [[liturgy]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is "'''The Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed'''".{{sfn|Mershman|1907}}  Another popular name in English is '''Feast of All Souls'''. In some other languages the celebration, not necessarily on the same date, is known as '''[[Day of the Dead]]'''.

The Western celebration of All Souls' Day is on 2 November and follows [[All Saints' Day]]. In the ordinary form of the Roman Rite, if 2 November falls on a Sunday, the Mass is of All Souls, but the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] is that of the Sunday, though Lauds and Vespers for the Dead in which the people participate may be said. In the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, All Souls Day is instead transferred, whenever 2 November falls on a Sunday, to the next day, 3 November.

==Anglican Communion==
The [[Anglican Communion]] since its inception has rejected the "Romish doctrine of Purgatory," holding it to be "contrary to the Word of God," and thus, requiem masses or other prayers for remission of sins of the dead are not used.<ref>See Article XXII, "Of Purgatory" in the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] of the Anglican Communion, adopted in 1571.</ref>  Hence, in most churches of the Anglican Communion today, All Souls' Day is merely a commemoration of deceased loved ones and "all faithful departed," and no belief in a purgatorial state is expected or required.<ref>[http://gladtobeanglican.blogspot.com/2007/01/purgatory-not-anglican.html Beckmann, David.

"Purgatory and the Anglican Way," ''The Prayer Book Society: News'', 30 April 2002] accessed 2 November 2013.</ref> [[Anglo-Catholic]]s, however, may hold beliefs about Purgatory similar to those of the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=y7VUAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=purgatory&f=false Griswold, Latta. ''The Episcopal Church, Its Teaching and Worship.'' New York:  E.S. Gorham, 1918, p. 110.] - According to this 1918 book on the teachings of the [[Protestant Episcopal Church]], the [[intermediate state]] is known as [[Christian views on Hades|Hades]] ([[Bosom of Abraham]]), and as a result "the Church has always held that it is right and proper for us to pray the souls of the departed, that they may go from grace to grace until they are finally received in Heaven," which will occur after the [[Resurrection of the Dead]] and the [[General Judgment]]. It should be noted that this is not an official teaching of the Episcopal Church today, however.</ref><ref>[http://www.osv.com/tabid/7621/itemid/8531/Msgr-M-Francis-Mannion-The-Anglican-view-of-pur.aspx Mannion, M.

==Protestant churches==
[[File:Skogskyrkogården at All Saints Day 2010-1.jpg|thumb|Graves lit by candles in Sweden]]
At the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] the celebration of All Souls' Day was fused with [[All Saints' Day]] in the [[Church of England]], though it was renewed individually in certain churches in connection with the [[Catholic Revival]] of the 19th century. The observance was restored with the publication of the 1980 ''[[Alternative Service Book]]'', and it features in ''[[Common Worship]]'' as a [[Lesser Festival]] called "Commemoration of the Faithful Departed (All Souls' Day)".

Among continental [[Protestantism|Protestants]] its tradition has been more tenaciously maintained. Even [[Martin Luther (religious leader)|Luther's]] influence was not sufficient to abolish its celebration in [[Saxony]] during his lifetime; and, though its ecclesiastical sanction soon lapsed even in the [[Lutheran]] Church, its memory survives strongly in popular custom. Just as it is the custom of [[French people]], of all ranks and creeds, to decorate the graves of their dead on the ''jour des morts'', so [[German people|German]] ,{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}} [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] people stream to the graveyards once a year with offerings of flowers and special grave lights (see the picture). Among [[Czech people]] the custom of visiting and tidying graves of relatives on the day is quite common even among [[atheism|atheists]]. In North America, however, most Protestant acknowledgment of the holiday is generally secular, celebrated in the form of [[Halloween]] festivities.

In 1816, [[Prussia]] introduced a new date for the remembrance of the Dead among its Lutheran citizens: [[Totensonntag]], the last Sunday before [[Advent]]. This custom was later also adopted by the non-Prussian Lutherans in Germany, but it has not spread much beyond the Protestant areas of Germany.

In the [[Methodist Church]], [[Saints in Methodism|saints]] refer to ''all'' [[Christian]]s and therefore, on [[All Saint's Day]], the [[Church Universal]], as well as the deceased members of a [[local congregation]] are honoured and remembered.<ref name=Methodism>{{cite web|author=Laura Huff Hileman|title=What is All Saint's Day?|url=http://upperroom.org/askjulian/default.asp?act=answer&itemid=276387|quote=Saints are just people who are trying to listen to God's word and live God's call. This is "the communion of saints" that we speak of in the Apostle's Creed -- that fellowship of believers that reaches beyond time and place, even beyond death.

==Origins, practices and purposes==
Some believe that the origins of  All Souls' Day in [[European folklore]] and [[folk belief]] are related to customs of [[ancestor veneration]]<ref name="Norget2006">{{cite book|author=Kristin Norget|title=Days of Death, Days of Life: Ritual in the Popular Culture of Oaxaca|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2PfDPufLSUEC&pg=PA193|accessdate=2 November 2012|year=2006|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-13689-1|pages=193–}}</ref> practised worldwide, through events such as the Chinese [[Ghost Festival]], the Japanese [[Bon Festival]]. The Roman custom was that of the [[Lemuria (festival)|Lemuria]]. 

The formal commemoration of the saints and martyrs ([[All Saints' Day]]) existed in the early Christian church since its [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius|legalization]], and alongside that developed a day for commemoration of all the dead (All Souls' Day). The modern date of All Souls' Day was first popularized in the early eleventh century after [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo]] established it as a day for the monks of Cluny and associated monestaries to pray for the souls in purgatory. However, it was only much later in the Medieval period, when Europeans began to mix the two celebrations, that many traditions now associated with All Souls' Day are first recorded. 

Many of these European traditions reflect the dogma of [[purgatory]]. For example, ringing bells for the dead was believed to comfort them in their cleansing there, while the sharing of [[soul cakes]] with the poor helped to buy the dead a bit of respite from the suffering of purgatory. In the same way, lighting candles was meant to kindle a light for the dead souls languishing in the darkness. Out of this grew the traditions of "going souling" and the baking of special types of bread or cakes. <ref>Medieval Histories 2012: 11:1 http://medievalhistories.com/wp-content/uploads/medievalhistories-november1.pdf</ref>

In [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]], cakes are left for them on the table and the room kept warm for their comfort. In [[Brittany]], people flock to the cemeteries at nightfall to kneel, bareheaded, at the graves of their loved ones, and to anoint the hollow of the [[tomb stone|tombstone]] with [[holy water]] or to pour libations of milk on it. At bedtime, the supper is left on the table for the souls.

In Bolivia, many people believe that the dead eat the food that is left out for them.
In Brazil people attend a Mass or visit the cemetery taking flowers to decorate their relatives' grave, but no food is involved.

In [[Malta]] many people make pilgrimages to graveyards, not just to visit the graves of their dead relatives, but to experience the special day in all its significance. Visits are not restricted to this day alone. During the month of November, Malta's cemeteries are frequented by families of the departed. Mass is also said throughout the month, with certain Catholic parishes organising special events at cemetery chapels.
