And it was just for fun; my parents didn't know I was going to play professionally, they just wanted me to do something because I had lots of energy. It was only when I started playing well at seven that I went to a professional academy. I would go to school, and then my parents would take me to the club, and I'd spend the rest of the day there just having fun with the kids."<ref name="sportsmates.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsmates.com/index.php?cmd=view_gallery&gal_id=380&image_id=5975&page=1&club_id=2461 |title=About Anna Kournikova |publisher=Sportsmates |date=12 May 2008 |accessdate=10 March 2012}}{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref> In 1986, Kournikova became a member of the  [[Spartak Tennis Club]], coached by Larissa Preobrazhenskaya.<ref name="kournikova.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.kournikova.com/about/bio |title=Official Biography of Anna Kournikova |publisher=Kournikova.com |accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref> In 1989, at the age of eight, Kournikova began appearing in junior tournaments, and by the following year, was attracting attention from tennis scouts across the world.

This was Kournikova's last singles final. With [[Martina Hingis]], she lost in the final at Sydney, but they won their second [[Grand Slam (tennis)|grand slam]] title together, the [[2002 Australian Open|Australian Open]].

She defeated [[Henrieta Nagyová]] in the 1st round, and then lost to [[Justine Henin-Hardenne]] in the 2nd round. She withdrew from Tokyo due to a sprained back suffered at the Australian Open and did not return to Tour until Miami. On April 9, in what would be the final WTA match of her career, Kournikova retired in the 1st round of the [[Family Circle Cup]] in Charleston, South Carolina, due to a left adductor strain.

Kournikova's two [[Grand Slam in tennis|Grand Slam]] doubles titles came in 1999 and 2002, both at the Australian Open in the Women's Doubles event with partner [[Martina Hingis]]. Kournikova proved a successful doubles player on the professional circuit, winning 16 tournament doubles titles, including two Australian Opens and being a finalist in mixed doubles at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and at Wimbledon, and reaching the No.1 ranking in doubles in the [[Women's Tennis Association]] tour rankings. Her pro career doubles record was 200–71. However, her singles career plateaued after 1999. For the most part, she managed to retain her ranking between 10 and 15 (her career high singles ranking was No.8), but her expected finals breakthrough failed to occur; she only reached four finals out of 130 singles tournaments, never in a Grand Slam event, and never won one.

Her singles record is 209–129. Her final playing years were marred by a string of injuries, especially back injuries, which caused her ranking to erode gradually.

== Playing style ==
As a player, Kournikova was noted for her footspeed and aggressive baseline play, and excellent angles and dropshots; however, her relatively flat, high-risk groundstrokes tended to produce frequent errors, and her serve was sometimes unreliable in singles.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Kournikova plays right-handed with a two-handed [[backhand]].<ref name="WTA"/>  She is a great player at the net.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E0DD1339F934A1575BC0A960958260 | title = Substance Behind Those Shades  | accessdate =7 July 2008 | date = 27 August 1996| author = Selena Roberts | work = New York Times }}</ref>  She can hit forceful groundstrokes and also [[drop shot]]s.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E0DF153BF932A15754C0A961958260 | work = New York Times | accessdate =7 July 2008 | date = 21 July 1997 | author = Ron Dicker | title = Rubin Defeats Kournikova in Exhibition Final }}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Kournikova was in a relationship with fellow Russian [[Pavel Bure]], an [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[ice hockey]] player. The two met in 1999 when Kournikova was still linked to Bure's former Russian teammate [[Sergei Fedorov]].<ref name=arbat>{{cite news |title=People: Courtney Love, Scissor Sisters, Antonio Moral |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/11/arts/11iht-peepsat.html |accessdate=12 July 2009 |date=11 February 2005 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> Bure and Kournikova were reported to have been engaged in 2000 after a reporter took a photo of them together in a Florida restaurant where Bure supposedly asked Kournikova to marry him. As the story made headlines in Russia, where they were both heavily followed in the media as celebrities, Bure and Kournikova both denied any engagement. Kournikova, 10 years younger than Bure, was 18 years old at the time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kournikova and Bure wedding may be off |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/kournikova-and-bure-wedding-may-be-off-720494.html |accessdate=24 June 2009 |date=6 April 2000 |work=The Independent |location=London }}</ref> The following year, Kournikova and Fedorov were married in Moscow.<ref name=arbat/> Fedorov claimed he and Kournikova were married in 2001, and divorced in 2003.<ref name="Marriage">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2003/03/03/fedorov030303.html|title=Fedorov married, divorced Kournikova|accessdate=26 January 2007|publisher=CBC Sports| date=3 March 2003}}</ref> Kournikova's representatives deny any marriage to Fedorov; however, Fedorov's agent Pat Brisson claims that although he does not know when they got married, he knew "Fedorov was married".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2003/03/03/fedorov030303.html#ixzz0sP7fSbs3 | work=CBC News | title=Fedorov married, divorced Kournikova | date=3 March 2003}}</ref>

Kournikova started dating pop star [[Enrique Iglesias]] in late 2001 (she appeared in his video, "Escape").{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Kournikova has consistently refused to directly confirm or deny the status of her personal relationships. In June 2008, Iglesias was quoted by the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' as having married Kournikova the previous year and subsequently separated.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/a104379/iglesias-anna-and-i-were-married.html | title=Iglesias: 'Anna and I were married'| publisher=Digital Spy }}</ref> The couple have invested in a $20 million home to be built on a private island in Miami.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2063342/Anna-Kournikova-pregnant-She-belly-kissed-Enrique-Iglesias.html|title=Tum-ting to tell us Anna?

Most of Kournikova's fame has come from the publicity surrounding her looks and her personal life.  During her debut at the 1996 US Open at the age of 15, the western world noticed her beauty, and soon pictures of her appeared in numerous magazines worldwide.
