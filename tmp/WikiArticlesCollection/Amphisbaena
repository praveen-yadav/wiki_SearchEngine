'''Amphisbaena''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|m|f|ɪ|s|ˈ|b|iː|n|ə}}, plural: '''amphisbaenae'''), '''amphisbaina''', '''amphisbene''', '''amphisboena''', '''amphisbona''', '''amphista''', '''amfivena''','''amphivena''', or '''anphivena''' (the last two being feminine), a [[Greek language|Greek]] word, from ''amphis'', meaning "both ways", and ''bainein'', meaning "to go", also called the Mother of Ants, is a [[mythological]], [[ant]]-eating [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] with a head at each end. According to [[Greek mythology]], the amphisbaena was spawned from the blood that dripped from the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]]'s head as [[Perseus]] flew over the [[Libyan Desert]] with it in his hand. Cato's army then encountered it along with other serpents on the march. Amphisbaenae fed off of the corpses left behind. The amphisbaena has been referred to by the [[poet]]s, such as [[Nicander]], [[John Milton]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Alfred Tennyson|Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], and [[A. E. Housman]], and the amphisbaena as a mythological and legendary creature has been referenced by [[Lucan (poet)|Lucan]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Isidore of Seville]], and [[Thomas Browne]], the last of whom debunked its existence.

{{quote|The amphisbaena has a twin head, that is one at the tail end as well, as though it were not enough for poison to be poured out of one mouth.}}<div align=right>--[[Pliny the Elder]]. ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'', ca. 77&nbsp;AD</div>
This early description of the amphisbaena depicts a venomous, dual-headed snakelike creature. However, [[Medieval]] and later drawings often show it with two or more scaled feet, particularly chicken feet, and feathered wings. Some even depict it as a horned, dragon-like creature with a serpent-headed tail and small, round ears, while others have both "necks" of equal size so that it cannot be determined which is the rear head. Many descriptions of the amphisbaena say its eyes glow like candles or lightning, but the poet [[Nicander]] seems to contradict this by describing it as "always dull of eye". He also says: "From either end protrudes a blunt chin; each is far from each other." [[Nicander]]'s account seems to be referring to what is indeed called the [[Amphisbaenia]].

== Habitat ==
The amphisbaena makes its home in the [[desert]].

== Folk medicine ==
In ancient times, the supposedly dangerous amphisbaena had many uses in the art of [[folk medicine]] and other such remedies. It is said that expecting women wearing a live amphisbaena around their necks would have safe pregnancies; however, if one's goal is to cure ailments such as [[arthritis]] or the [[common cold]], one should wear only its skin. By eating the meat of the amphisbaena, one could attract many lovers of the opposite sex, and slaying one during the [[full moon]] could give power to one who is pure of heart and mind. [[Lumberjacks]] suffering from cold weather on the job could nail its carcass or skin to a tree to keep warm, while in the process allowing the tree to be felled more easily.

== Origins ==
In ''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/HistSciTech/subcollections/BestiaryAbout.html The Book of Beasts]'', [[T.H. White]] suggests that the creature derives from sightings of the [[Amphisbaenia|worm lizards]] of the same name. These creatures are found in the Mediterranean countries where many of these legends originated.

== ''Dungeons & Dragons'' ==
In the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], the [[Index of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st edition monsters|amphisbaena]] is depicted as in traditional myth as a giant serpent with a head at both ends. It travels by grasping one head in the other and rolling like a hoop. The fangs of the amphisbaena are so poisonous that anything successfully bitten by it dies instantly.
