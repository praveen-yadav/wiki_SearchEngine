'''Black metal''' is an [[Extreme metal|extreme]] subgenre of [[heavy metal music]]. Common traits include [[Tempo#Beats per minute|fast tempos]], [[Screaming (music)#Black metal|shrieked vocals]], highly distorted [[Electric guitar|guitars]] played with [[tremolo picking]], [[blast beat]] drumming, raw ([[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]]) recording and unconventional [[song structure]]s.

During the 1980s, several [[thrash metal]] and [[death metal]] bands formed a prototype for black metal.<ref name="Stylus Magazine"/> This so-called "first wave" included bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Hellhammer]] and [[Celtic Frost]].<ref name=sam>{{cite video |last=Dunn |first=Sam |year=2005 |title=[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]] |type=motion picture |publisher=Seville Pictures}}</ref> A "second wave" arose in the early 1990s, spearheaded by [[Norway|Norwegian]] bands such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Burzum]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]] and [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]]. The [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] developed the style of their forebears into a distinct genre. Norwegian-inspired black metal scenes emerged throughout Europe and North America, although some other scenes developed their own styles with no connection to the Norwegian one.<ref name=billzebub>{{cite video |last=Debub |first=Bill |year=2007 |title=Black Metal: A Documentary |type=motion picture |publisher=Bill Zebub Productions}}</ref>

Initially a synonym for "Satanic metal",<ref>{{cite book |last=McIver |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel McIver |title=Justice for All - The Truth About Metallica |edition=updated |publisher=Omnibus Press |year=2009 |url=http://books.google.de/books?id=SvW-uN-qEbIC&pg=PT98&dq=%22black+metal%22#v=onepage&q=%22black%20metal%22&f=false |accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref> black metal is often met with hostility from mainstream culture. Many artists express extreme [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] and [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] views, and several of the genre's "second wave" pioneers have been convicted for [[Black metal#Church burnings|church burnings]] and murder. There is also a small [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] movement within black metal, although most fans and prominent artists shun Nazism and oppose its influence on black metal.<ref name=billzebub/><ref name=kingovhell>{{cite web |url=http://www.maelstrom.nu/ezine/interview_iss50_224.php |title=Interview with Jotunspor |last=Škot |first=Mladen |work=maelstrom.nu |accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=infernus1>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=93004 |title=Blabbermouth.net - Gorgoroth Guitarist Infernus: 'I Personally Am Against Racism in Both Thought and Practice' |date=15 March 2008 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref> The black metal community generally condemns the seeking of mainstream success or attention, preferring the genre to remain [[underground music|underground]].

== Characteristics ==
Although nowadays, 'black metal' often refers to the Norwegian style with high-pitched or raspy vocals and raw production, it has also been used for bands as different as [[Death SS]], [[Mercyful Fate]], [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Blasphemy (band)|Blasphemy]],<ref name=emperor10>''Emperor''. In: Jon Kristiansen: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points Books 2011, p. 274.</ref> and the Greek and Finnish bands that emerged around the same time as the Norwegian scene.<ref name=billzebub/>

=== Instrumentation ===
Norwegian-inspired black metal guitarists usually favor high-pitched guitar tones and heavy [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]].{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}} The guitar is usually played with much use of fast (un-[[Palm mute|muted]]) [[tremolo picking]].{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}}<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Campion |title=In the Face of Death |date=20 February 2005 |publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1419364,00.html |work=[[The Guardian|guardian.co.uk]] |accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=chronicles>{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/Articles/rants/6-668_black_metal_a_brief_guide.aspx |title=CoC : Rant : Black Metal: A Brief Guide |last=Kalis |first=Quentin |date=31 August 2004 |work=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] |accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref> Guitarists often use [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]]—along with specific [[Musical scale|scales]], [[Interval (music)|intervals]] and [[Guitar chord|chord progressions]]—to create a sense of dread. The [[tritone]] or flat-fifth is often used, for example. [[Guitar solo]]s and low [[guitar tunings]] are rare in black metal.<ref name=chronicles/>

The [[bass guitar]] is seldom used to play stand-alone melodies. It is not uncommon for the bass guitar to be muted against the guitar,<ref name=chronicles/> or for it to [[Homophony|homophonically]] follow the bass lines of the guitar. Typically, [[Drum kit|drumming]] is fast and uses [[Heel-toe technique|double-bass]] or [[blast beat]]s, or both.

Black metal songs often stray from [[Song structure (popular music)|conventional song structure]] and often lack clear verse-chorus sections. Instead, many black metal songs contain lengthy and repetitive instrumental sections.

The Greek style—established by [[Rotting Christ]], [[Varathron]] and [[Necromantia]]<ref>J. Campbell: [http://www.nwnprod.com/?p=2078 ''Varathron "Genesis of the Unaltered Evil" DLP/Triple LP and TS Out Now''], 30 January 2012, accessed on 13 December 2012.</ref>—has more [[traditional metal|traditional heavy metal]]<ref>Chad Bowar: [http://heavymetal.about.com/b/2011/06/24/retro-recommendation-rotting-christ-thy-mighty-contract.htm ''Retro Recommendation: Rotting Christ - Thy Mighty Contract''], 24 June 2011, accessed on 13 December 2012.</ref> and [[death metal]]<ref>Stefan Glas: ''Rotting Christ''. ''Passage to Arcturo''. In: ''Metal Hammer'', March 1992, pp. 70f.</ref> traits than Norwegian black metal.

=== Vocals and lyrics ===
Traditional black metal bands usually use high-pitched and raspy vocals which include shrieking, screaming and snarling.{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}}<ref name=chronicles/> This vocal style was influenced by [[Quorthon]] of [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]],{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=18f}} and is one of the traits that distinguishes the vocals of many traditional black metal artists from those of death metal, which usually uses low-pitched [[Death growl|growls]].

Black metal was originally used as a term for extreme metal bands with [[Satanism|Satanic]] and [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] lyrics; today, the most common lyrical theme is opposition to Christianity<ref name=chronicles/> and other organized religions. As part of this, many artists write lyrics that could be seen to promote [[atheism]], [[antitheism]], [[paganism]] or [[Satanism]].<ref name=murdermusic>{{cite video |last=Dome |first=Michael |year=2007 |title=Murder Music: Black Metal |type=motion picture |publisher=Rockworld TV}}</ref> The anti-Christianity of secular or pagan artists is often linked to the [[Christianization]] of their countries. Other oft-explored themes are [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[nihilism]], misanthropy,<ref name=murdermusic/> [[death]] and other dark topics. However, over time, many artists have begun to focus more on topics like [[winter]], [[nature]], [[mythology]], [[folklore]], [[philosophy]] and [[fantasy]]. (For more information about black metal lyrics, see the [[#Ideology|ideology section]] below.)

=== Production ===
Low-cost production quality was typical for early black metal artists with low budgets, where recordings would often be done in their homes or basements.{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}} Even when they were able to raise their production quality, many artists chose to keep making [[low fidelity]] (lo-fi) recordings.<ref name=chronicles/><ref name=murdermusic/> The reason for this was to stay true to the genre's underground roots and to make the music sound more "raw" and "cold".<ref name=murdermusic/> One of the better-known examples of this is the album ''[[Transilvanian Hunger]]'' by [[Darkthrone]] – a band whom Johnathan Selzer of ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine says "represent the [[DIY ethic|DIY aspect]] of black metal".<ref name=murdermusic/> Many have claimed that, originally, black metal was not meant to attract a big audience.<ref name=murdermusic/> Trelldom and [[God Seed]] vocalist [[Gaahl]] said that during its early years, "black metal was never meant to reach an audience, it was purely for our own satisfaction".<ref name=guardian/>

[[File:Hindvir Gaulhammer Fest 111008 01 C.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A common black metal trait is the use of [[corpse paint]]]]

=== Imagery and performances ===
Many bands choose not to play live.<ref>Marc Spermeth: ''Besessen von der Dunkelheit und dem Bösen''. In: ''Ablaze'', no. 5, May/June 1995, p. 12.</ref><ref name=putrid>Ben Ratliff: [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/arts/music/15metal.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all ''Thank You, Professor, That Was Putrid'']. In: ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 December 2009.</ref> Those who do maintain that these "live performances are not for entertainment or spectacle. Sincerity, authenticity and extremity are valued above all else."{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} Some bands consider their concerts to be rituals{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} and often make use of stage props and theatrics. Many bands, such as Mayhem and [[Gorgoroth]], are noted for their controversial shows, which have featured impaled animal heads, mock [[crucifixion]]s, [[List of medieval weapons|medieval weaponry]] and band members doused in animal blood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |title=Aftenposten Norway, Norwegian news in English |last=Tisdall |first=Jonathan |date=4 February 2004 |work=aftenposten.no |accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref>

Black metal artists often appear dressed in black with [[combat boot]]s, bullet belts, spiked wristbands<ref name=murdermusic/> and [[Cross of St. Peter|inverted crosses]]/[[pentagram]]s to reinforce their anti-Christian or anti-religious stance.<ref name=sam/> However, the most stand-out trait is their use of [[corpse paint]] – black and white makeup (sometimes mixed with real or fake blood), which is used to create a corpse-like appearance.

In the early 1990s, most pioneering black metal artists used simple [[black-and-white]] pictures or writing on their record covers.<ref name=billzebub/> This could have been meant as a reaction against death metal bands, who at that time had begun to use brightly colored album artwork.<ref name=billzebub/> Most underground black metal artists have continued this style. In the main, black metal album covers are usually atmospheric or provocative; some feature natural or fantasy landscapes (for example [[Burzum]]'s ''[[Filosofem]]'' and [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]]'s ''[[In the Nightside Eclipse]]'') while others are violent, perverted, sacrilegious and iconoclastic (for example [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]]'s ''[[Fuck Me Jesus]]'' and [[Dimmu Borgir]]'s ''[[In Sorte Diaboli]]'').

== History ==
The following depiction follows a classification according to which pioneers like [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] and [[Hellhammer]] were part of a "first wave" and the "second wave" was begun by the [[Early Norwegian black metal scene|early Norwegian scene]]; especially by [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] vocalist Dead's suicide,<ref>Enrico Ahlig: [http://www.metal-hammer.de/news/meldungen/article299447/marduk-gitarrist-besitzt-leichenteile-von-dead.html ''Marduk-Gitarrist besitzt Leichenteile von Dead''], 5 June 2012, accessed on 9 January 2013.</ref> Mayhem's leader Euronymous, who founded the Norwegian scene after Dead's suicide,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=39}} and [[Darkthrone]]'s album ''[[A Blaze in the Northern Sky]]''.<ref name=paganfront>[[Hendrik Möbus]]: [http://web.archive.org/web/20071214012732/http://www.thepaganfront.com/pf.php?show=articles&article=1 ''National Socialist Black Metal''], accessed on 2 January 2013.</ref><ref>Jon "Metalion" Kristiansen: [http://www.vice.com/read/saga-true-black-metal-v15n5 ''The Saga of True Norwegian Black Metal''], accessed on 2 January 2013.</ref><ref>Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann: ''Darkthrone''. ''A Blaze in the Northern Sky''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 97.</ref> There are also other definitions according to which other albums like [[Sarcófago]]'s ''[[I.N.R.I. (Sarcófago album)|I.N.R.I.]]''<ref>Mersus: ''5 Klassiker''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 84.</ref> or [[Samael (band)|Samael]]'s ''[[Worship Him]]''<ref>sG: ''5 Klassiker''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 79.</ref> began the "second wave".

=== First wave ===
The first wave of black metal refers to those bands during the 1980s who influenced the black metal sound and formed a prototype for the genre. They were often [[speed metal]] or [[thrash metal]] bands.<ref name=sam/><ref>{{cite book |last=Sharpe-Young |first=Garry |title=Metal: The Definitive Guide |page=208}}</ref>

The term "black metal" was coined by the English band Venom with their second album ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' (1982). Although deemed thrash metal rather than black metal by today's standards,<ref name=murdermusic/> the album's lyrics and imagery focused more on anti-Christian and Satanic themes than any before it. Their music was fast, unpolished in production and with raspy or grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted [[pseudonym]]s, a practice that would become widespread among black metal musicians.

[[File:Venom live at hellfest.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Venom's album titled ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' inspired the name of the genre]]

The [[Denmark|Danish]] band [[Mercyful Fate]] influenced the Norwegian scene with their imagery and lyrics. Frontman [[King Diamond]], who wore ghoulish black-and-white facepaint on stage, inspired what became known as "corpse paint".

Another major influence on black metal was the [[Sweden|Swedish]] band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]]. The band, led by Thomas Forsberg (aka '[[Quorthon]]'), created "the blueprint for Scandinavian black metal".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=21}} Not only was Bathory's music dark, fast, heavily distorted, lo-fi and with anti-Christian themes, Quorthon was also the first to use the "shrieked" vocals that came to define black metal.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=18f}} The band played in this style on their first four albums: ''[[Bathory (album)|Bathory]]'' (1984), ''[[The Return (Bathory album)|The Return of the Darkness and Evil]]'' (1985), ''[[Under the Sign of the Black Mark]]'' (1987) and ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988). With ''Blood Fire Death'' and the two following albums, Bathory pioneered the style that would become known as [[Viking metal]].

Hellhammer from [[Switzerland]] "made truly raw and brutal music"<ref name=ekeroth244>Daniel Ekeroth: [http://books.google.de/books?id=jRRvfWp95FIC&pg=PA244&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Swedish Death Metal'']. Second edition. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points 2009, p. 244, accessed on 24 January 2013.</ref> with Satanic lyrics, and became an important influence on later black metal;{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=10}} "Their simple yet effective riffs and fat guitar sound were groundbreaking, anticipating the later trademark sound of early [[Swedish death metal]]".<ref name=ekeroth244/> In 1984, members of Hellhammer formed [[Celtic Frost]],<ref>[http://www.triptykon.net/vcf/band/biography.html ''Biography''], accessed on 24 January 2013.</ref> whose music "explored more orchestral and experimental territories. The lyrics also became more personal, with topics about inner feelings and majestic stories. But for a couple of years, Celtic Frost was one of the world's most extreme and original metal bands, with a huge impact on the mid-90's black metal scene".<ref name=ekeroth244/> [[Tom G. Warrior]] of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost credited English [[hardcore punk]] band [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] as "a revolution, much like Venom", saying, "When I heard the first two Discharge records, I was blown away. I was just starting to play an instrument and I had no idea you could go so far."<ref>J. Bennett, "Procreation of the Wicked", ''Precious Metal: Decibel Presents the Stories Behind 25 Extreme Metal Masterpieces'', Albert Mudrian, ed., Da Capo Press, pp. 34f.</ref>

Other artists usually considered part of this movement include [[Kreator]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]] (from [[Germany]]),<ref name=killyourself>{{cite journal |last=Lahdenpera |first=Esa |year=1995 |title=Northern Black Metal Legends |journal=Kill Yourself!!!

In May 1990, the Japanese band [[Sigh (band)|Sigh]] was formed, releasing two demos that year, ''Desolation'' and ''Tragedies'', followed by their EP ''Requiems for Fools'' two years later. With this EP, which was originally sent to Dead, but ended up in the hands of Euronymous after Dead's suicide, Sigh managed to gain the attention of Euronymous. Sigh's vocalist, Mirai Kawashima, began trading tapes and exchanging letters with several members of the Norwegian scene, including Samoth, Faust and Vikernes. In March 1993, they recorded their debut album, ''[[Scorn Defeat]]''. Euronymous was interested in releasing it on his label, but he was murdered in August of that same year. Instead, the album was released on [[Voices of Wonder]], which took over Euronymous' label after his death. The album became "a cult classic in the black metal world", which, according to the band themselves, "would influence the symphonic aspects of bands like [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] and [[Cradle of Filth]]".<ref name=SighJapan>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080117111501/http://www.sighjapan.com/bio.htm ''Biography''], accessed on 23 June 2013.</ref>

In 1990 and 1991, Northern European metallers began to release music influenced by these bands or the older ones from the first wave. In [[Sweden]] this included [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]], [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]], [[Nifelheim]] and [[Abruptum]]. In [[Finland]], there emerged a scene that mixed first wave black metal influences with elements of death metal and [[grindcore]]; this included [[Beherit (band)|Beherit]], [[Archgoat]] and [[Impaled Nazarene]], whose debut album ''Tol Cormpt Norz Norz Norz'' ''[[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]]'' journalist Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann considers a part of war metal's roots.<ref name=rh307>Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann: ''Impaled Nazarene''.

In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 307, December 2012, p. 77.</ref> Bands such as [[Demoncy]] and [[Profanatica]] emerged during this time in the United States, when death metal was more popular among extreme metal fans. The Norwegian band Mayhem's concert at the Eiskeller in Leipzig with [[Eminenz]] and [[Manos (band)|Manos]] in 1990, later released as ''[[Live in Leipzig]]'', was said to have had a strong influence on the Eastern German scene<ref name=koenige>Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann: ''Die Könige vom Westwall''.

The second wave of black metal began in the early 1990s and was spearheaded by the Norwegian black metal scene. During 1990–1993 a number of Norwegian artists began performing and releasing a new kind of black metal music; this included Mayhem, [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]], [[Burzum]], Darkthrone, [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], [[Carpathian Forest]] and [[Gorgoroth]]. They developed the style of their 1980s forebears into a distinct genre. This was partly thanks to a new kind of guitar playing developed by Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch of Stigma Diabolicum/Thorns and [[Euronymous|Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth]] of Mayhem.<ref name=billzebub/><ref name=guardian/> Fenriz of Darkthrone has credited them with this innovation in a number of interviews. He described it as being "derived from Bathory"<ref name=untilthelight>{{cite video |year=2009 |title=[[Until the Light Takes Us]] |medium=motion picture |publisher=Variance Films}}</ref> and noted that "those kinds of riffs became the new order for a lot of bands in the '90s".<ref name=revolver>Kory Grow: [http://www.revolvermag.com/uncategorized/web-exclusive-interview-darkthrones-fenriz-part-2-his-thoughts-on-transilva.html ''WEB-EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: DARKTHRONE'S FENRIZ, PART 2! HIS THOUGHTS ON 'TRANSILVANIAN HUNGER' AND HIP''].</ref> Some members of these Norwegian bands would be responsible for a spate of crimes and controversy, including church burnings and murder (see below). The scene was bitterly opposed to Christianity and organized religion as a whole. In interviews during the early 1990s, members of the scene presented themselves as [[misanthropy|misanthropic]] Devil worshippers who wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil. When asked why such statements were made to the press, [[Ihsahn]] of Emperor said that this "was very much to create fear among people"{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=222}} and "to be in opposition to society".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=218f}} More detail about the scene's ideologies can be found in the [[#Ideology|ideology section]]. Visually, the dark themes of their music was complemented with [[corpsepaint]], which became a way for many black metal artists to distinguish themselves from other metal bands of the era.<ref name=murdermusic/>

==== Helvete and Deathlike Silence ====
[[File:Black metal - graffity in euronymous' basement.jpg|thumb|The basement of Helvete, showing graffiti from the early 1990s]]

During May–June 1991,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=66}} Euronymous of Mayhem opened an independent record shop named ''Helvete'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] for '[[hell]]') in [[Oslo]]. It quickly became the focal point of Norway's emerging black metal scene and a meeting place for many of its musicians; especially the members of Mayhem, Burzum, Emperor and Thorns.<ref name="Satan rir media"/> Jon 'Metalion' Kristiansen, writer of the fanzine ''Slayer'', said that the opening of Helvete was "the creation of the whole Norwegian Black Metal scene".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=39}} In its basement, Euronymous founded an [[independent record label]] named [[Deathlike Silence Productions]]. With the rising popularity of his band and others like it, the underground success of Euronymous's label is often credited for encouraging other record labels, who had previously shunned black metal acts, to then reconsider and release their material.

==== Dead's suicide ====
On 8 April 1991, Mayhem vocalist [[Per "Dead" Ohlin|Per Yngve Ohlin]] (who called himself 'Dead') committed [[suicide]] while alone in a house shared by the band.<ref name=onceuponatime>{{cite video |year=2007 |title=Once Upon a Time in Norway |medium=motion picture |publisher=Another World Entertainment}}</ref><ref name=purefucking>{{cite video |year=2008 |title=Pure Fucking Mayhem |medium=motion picture |publisher=Index Verlag}}</ref> Fellow musicians described Dead as odd, introverted and depressed. Before going onstage he went to great lengths to make himself look like a corpse and would cut his arms while singing.<ref name=guardian/> Mayhem's drummer, [[Jan Axel Blomberg|Hellhammer]], said that Dead was the first to wear the distinctive 'corpse paint' that became widespread in the scene.<ref name=basik>{{cite web |url=http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-june1998.htm |title=Interview with Hellhammer conducted by Dmitry Basik June 1998 |last=Basik |first=Dmitri |date=June 1998 |work=thetruemayhem.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070823184104/http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-june1998.htm |archivedate=23 August 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref>

He was found with slit wrists and a [[shotgun]] wound to the head, by Mayhem guitarist Euronymous. Dead's [[suicide note]] apologized for firing the weapon indoors and ended: "Excuse all the blood".<ref name=purefucking/>{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=62}} Before calling the police, Euronymous went to a nearby shop and bought a disposable camera with which he photographed the body,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=49}} after re-arranging some items. One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album: ''[[Dawn of the Black Hearts]]''.<ref name=basik/>

In time, rumors spread that Euronymous had made a [[stew]] with bits of Dead's brain and had made [[necklace]]s with bits of his skull.<ref name=murdermusic/><ref name=onceuponatime/> Euronymous allegedly gave some of these necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy.<ref name=sam/> He used Dead's suicide to foster Mayhem's 'evil' image and claimed Dead had killed himself because extreme metal had become 'trendy' and commercialized.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=59-60}} Mayhem bassist [[Necrobutcher|Jørn 'Necrobutcher' Stubberud]] noted that "people became more aware of the [black metal] scene after Dead had shot himself [...] I think it was Dead's suicide that really changed the scene".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bromley |first=Adrian "The Energizer" |title=Mayhem: To Hell and Back |magazine=Unrestrained |issue=15 |url=http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/necro-unrestrained15.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070823101847/http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/necro-unrestrained15.htm |archivedate=23 August 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref>

Two other members of the early Norwegian scene would later commit suicide: [[Erik Brødreskift|Erik 'Grim' Brødreskift]] (of Immortal, [[Borknagar]], Gorgoroth) in 1999<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/norway/bergen/immortal |title=MusicMight :: Artists :: Immortal |work=rockdetector.com |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=19441 |title=Erik 'Grim' Brodreskift (1969–1999) - Find a Grave Memorial |work=findagrave.com |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=immortalmembers>{{cite web |url=http://www.immortal.nu/band/members.html |title=w w w . i m m o r t a l . n u |work=immortal.nu |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010820145828/www.immortal.nu/band/members.html |archivedate=20 August 2001 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> and Espen 'Storm' Andersen (of [[Strid (band)|Strid]]) in 2001.<ref>Ravn: ''Strid''.

==== Church burnings ====
[[Image:Bergen, Fantoft2.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The Fantoft stave church <!-- Please add a picture of one of the churches burning, if possible -->]]

Musicians and fans of the Norwegian black metal scene took part in over 50 [[arsons]] of Christian churches in Norway from June 1992 to 1996.<ref name="Satan rir media"/> Some of the buildings were hundreds of years old and seen as important historical landmarks. One of the first and most notable was Norway's [[Fantoft stave church]], which police believed was burnt by [[Varg Vikernes]] of the one-man band Burzum.<ref name="Satan rir media"/> The cover of Burzum's EP ''[[Aske (album)|Aske]]'' (Norwegian for 'ashes') is a photograph of the Fantoft stave church after its destruction. In May 1994, he was found guilty for burning down Holmenkollen Chapel, Skjold Church and Åsane Church.<ref name=untilthelight/>{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=93}} To coincide with the release of Mayhem's ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'', Vikernes and Euronymous had also allegedly plotted to blow up [[Nidaros Cathedral]], which appears on the album cover. The musicians [[Faust (musician)|Faust]],{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=94f}} [[Samoth]],{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}} (both of Emperor) and [[Jørn Inge Tunsberg]] (of [[Hades Almighty]]){{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}}<ref name="Satan rir media"/> were also convicted for church arsons. Members of the Swedish scene started to burn churches in 1993.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=269f}}

Many of those convicted for the church burnings have said that their actions were a symbolic "retaliation" against Christianity in Norway.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=89}} According to Mayhem drummer Hellhammer, he had urged the others to focus on attacking [[mosque]]s and [[Hindu temple]]s instead.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=105}} Today, opinions on the church burnings differ within the black metal community. Guitarist [[Infernus]] and former vocalist [[Gaahl]] of the band Gorgoroth have praised the church burnings in interviews, with the latter saying "there should have been more of them, and there will be more of them".<ref name=sam/> However, Necrobutcher and [[Kjetil Manheim]] of Mayhem have condemned the church burnings, with the latter claiming "It was just people trying to gain acceptance within a strict group [the black metal scene] ... they wanted some sort of approval and status".<ref name=onceuponatime/> [[Watain]] vocalist Erik Danielsson said that he respected these acts "as acts of their own will" but "the only Christianity they defeated was the last piece of Christianity within themselves. Which is a very good beginning, of course", and that the acts did not reach further than the inspiration they gave to others.<ref name=blackmetalsatanica>''Black Metal Satanica'', 2008.</ref>

==== Murder of Euronymous ====
In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=117}} On the night of 10 August 1993, Varg Vikernes (of Burzum) and Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch (of Thorns) drove from [[Bergen]] to Euronymous's apartment in Oslo. Upon their arrival a confrontation began and Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous. His body was found on the stairs outside the apartment with 23 cut wounds – two to the head, five to the neck, and sixteen to the back.<ref>Steinke, Darcey. "Satan's Cheerleaders". ''[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]''. February 1996.</ref>

It has been speculated that the murder was the result of either a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records or an attempt at "outdoing" a stabbing in Lillehammer the year before by Faust.<ref name=ukcrlz>{{cite web |last=Huey |first=Steve |url=http://music.yahoo.com/ar-257375-bio |title=Mayhem Mayhem Biography on Yahoo! Music |work=yahoo.com |date=10 August 1993 |accessdate=24 March 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}</ref> Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an [[electroshock weapon]], tie him up and [[torture]] him to death while [[snuff film|videotaping the event]].<ref name=untilthelight/> He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned [[contract]] to ambush him.<ref name=untilthelight/><ref name=burzumstory2>Vikernes, Varg: [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story02.shtml ''A Burzum Story: Part II - Euronymous'']. Burzum.org.</ref> On the night of the murder, Vikernes claims he intended to hand Euronymous the signed contract and "tell him to fuck off", but that Euronymous "panicked" and attacked him first.<ref name=burzumstory2/> He also claims that most of the cut wounds were caused by broken glass Euronymous had fallen on during the struggle.<ref name=burzumstory2/> The self-defense story is doubted by Faust{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=123}} and other members of the scene.

Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=120}} Many other members of the scene were taken in for questioning around the same time. Some of them confessed to their crimes and implicated others. In May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of four churches, and for the theft and storage of 150&nbsp;kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, "presumably as a statement of symbolic support".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}} Vikernes smiled when his verdict was read and the picture was widely reprinted in the news media. Blackthorn was sentenced to eight years in prison for being an accomplice to the murder.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}} That month saw the release of Mayhem's album ''De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas'', which featured Euronymous on guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar.<ref name=guardian/> Before the release, Euronymous's family had asked Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said: "I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts, but I never did".<ref name=guardian/> In 2003, Vikernes failed to return to [[Tønsberg]] prison after being given a short leave. He was re-arrested shortly after while driving a stolen car with various weapons.<ref>{{cite news |last=Berglund |first=Nina |date=27 October 2003 |title=Police Nab 'The Count' After He Fled Jail |newspaper=[[Aftenposten]] |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article655724.ece |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070308164838/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article655724.ece |archivedate=8 March 2007 |accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> Vikernes was released on [[parole]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite news |title=Varg Vikernes ute på prøve |url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=557287 |newspaper=[[Verdens Gang]] |location=[[Oslo]], [[Norway]] |agency=[[Norsk Telegrambyrå|NTB]] |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=5 September 2012 |language=[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vg.no%2Fnyheter%2Finnenriks%2Fartikkel.php%3Fartid%3D557287&date=2009-03-10 |archivedate=10 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ute av fengsel |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/05/22/nyheter/black_metal/varg_vikernes/6354526/ |work=dagbladet.no |date=22 May 2009 |accessdate=23 May 2009 |language=[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]}}</ref>

==== Conflict between scenes ====
There was said to have been a strong rivalry between Norwegian black metal and [[Swedish death metal]] scenes. Fenriz and [[Tchort]] have noted that Norwegian black metal musicians had become "fed up with the whole death metal scene"<ref name=billzebub/> and that "death metal was very uncool in Oslo" at the time.<ref name=onceuponatime/> A number of times, Euronymous sent [[death threat]]s to some of the more mainstream death metal groups in Europe.<ref name=onceuponatime/> Allegedly, a group of Norwegian black metal fans even plotted to kidnap and murder certain Swedish death metal musicians.<ref name=onceuponatime/>

There was a brief feud between Norwegian and Finnish scenes during 1992 and 1993.<ref name=feud1995>{{cite journal | title=The End of a Legend? Isten Smokes Holocaust Vengeance out of Beherit |journal=Isten |volume=6 |year=1995 |pages=44–45}}</ref> The feud was partly motivated by seemingly harmless pranks; for example, Nuclear Holocausto of the Finnish band Beherit made [[prank call]]s in the middle of the night to Samoth of Emperor (in Norway) and [[Mika Luttinen]] of Impaled Nazarene (in Finland). The calls consisted of senseless babbling and playing of [[children's music|children's songs]],<ref name=feud1995/> although Luttinen believed them to be death threats from Norwegian bands.<ref name=feud1995/> Impaled Nazarene's first album ''Tol Cormpt Norz Norz Norz'' has "No orders from Norway accepted" and "Kuolema Norjan kusipäille!" ("Death to the assholes of Norway!") printed on the back cover. The Finnish band Black Crucifixion criticized Darkthrone as "trendies" due to Darkthrone originally being a death metal band.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Oath of the Goat's Black Blood |journal=Sinister Flame |volume=1 |year=2003 |pages=28–32}}</ref>

==== The second wave outside Norway ====
Black metal scenes also emerged on the European mainland during the early 1990s, inspired by the Norwegian scene or the older bands, or both. In [[Poland]], a scene was spearheaded by [[Graveland]] and [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]]. In [[France]], a close-knit group of musicians known as [[Les Légions Noires]] emerged; this included artists such as [[Mütiilation]], [[Vlad Tepes (band)|Vlad Tepes]], Belketre and Torgeist. Bands such as [[Black Funeral]], [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]] emerged during this time in the United States.

A notable black metal group in [[England]] at the time was [[Cradle of Filth]], who released three demos in a black/death metal style with symphonic flourishes, followed by [[The Principle of Evil Made Flesh|a studio album]], which featured a then-unusual hybrid style of black and [[gothic metal]]. The band then abandoned black metal for gothic metal,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Baddeley |first1=Gavin |last2=Filth |first2=Dani |authorlink2=Dani Filth |title=[[The Gospel of Filth]] |date=March 2010 |pages=48–50 |publisher=FAB Press}}</ref> becoming one of the most successful extreme metal bands to date. John Serba of [[AllMusic]] commented that their first album "made waves in the early black metal scene, putting Cradle of Filth on the tips of metalheads' tongues, whether in praise of the band's brazen attempts to break the black metal mold or in derision for its 'commercialization' of an underground phenomenon that was proud of its grimy heritage [...]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-principle-of-evil-made-flesh-mw0000025519 |title=The Principle of Evil Made Flesh - Cradle of Filth |last=Serba |first=John |work=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref> Another English band called Necropolis never released any music, but "began a desecratory assault against churches and cemeteries in their area" and "almost caused Black Metal to be banned in Britain as a result".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=316-318}}

The controversy surrounding [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] drew attention to the [[Germany|German]] black metal scene. In 1993, the members murdered a boy from their school, Sandro Beyer.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=272}} A photo of Beyer's gravestone is on the cover of one of their demos,<ref>[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]: ''Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity''. NYU Press, 2003. p. 206.</ref> ''Thuringian Pagan Madness'', along with pro-Nazi statements. It was recorded in prison and released in Poland by Graveland drummer Capricornus.<ref>Absurd: ''Thuringian Pagan Madness'', Capricornus Prod. 1995.</ref> The band's early music, however, was more influenced by [[Oi!]] and [[Rock Against Communism]] (RAC) than by black metal,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=250f}} and described as being "more akin to '60s [[garage punk]] than some of the […] Black Metal of their contemporaries".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=295}} [[Alexander von Meilenwald]] from the German band [[Nagelfar]] considers [[Ungod (band)|Ungod]]'s 1993 debut album ''Circle of the Seven Infernal Pacts'', [[Desaster]]'s 1994 demo ''Lost in the Ages'', [[Tha-Norr]]'s 1995 album ''Wolfenzeitalter'' (which he called an "fantastic, extremely atmospheric underground jewel" by one of the most underrated German bands<ref name=koenige/>), [[Lunar Aurora]]'s 1996 debut ''Weltengänger'' and [[Katharsis (band)|Katharsis]]'s 2000 debut ''666'' (whose second album ''Kruzifixxion'' he called "by far the best traditional black metal album from Germany"<ref>Alexander von Meilenwald: ''5 Klassiker''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 82.</ref>) to be the most important recordings for the German scene.<ref name=koenige/> He said they were "not necessarily the best German releases, but they all kicked off something".<ref name=koenige/>

=== After the second wave ===
In the beginning of the second wave, the different scenes developed their own styles; as [[Alan Averill|Alan 'A. A. Nemtheanga' Averill]] says, "you had the Greek sound and the Finnish sound, and the Norwegian sound, and there was German bands and Swiss bands and that kind of thing".<ref name=billzebub/> By the mid-1990s, the style of the Norwegian scene was being adopted by bands worldwide, and in 1998, ''[[Kerrang!]]'' journalist [[Malcolm Dome]] said that "black metal as we know it in 1998 owes more to Norway and to Scandinavia than any other particular country".<ref name="Satan rir media">{{cite video |title=[[Satan rir media|Satan Rides the Media]] |year=1998}}</ref> Newer black metal bands also began raising their production quality and introducing additional instruments such as [[synthesizer]]s and even full-symphony [[orchestra]]s.

After Euronymous's death, "[s]ome bands went more towards the Viking metal and epic style, while some bands went deeper into the abyss".<ref name=blackmetalsatanica/> The Swedish scene had started to burn churches in 1993, followed by other cases of arson, grave desecrations, death threats and other violent acts. Members of bands like [[Algaion]] and [[Nefandus]] were involved in some of these acts. In 1995, [[Jon Nödtveidt]] of [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]] joined the [[Temple of the Black Light|Misanthropic Luciferian Order]] (MLO).<ref>Andrea Biagi: [http://web.archive.org/web/20031005065926/http://www.dissection.nu/biography.htm ''Biography Part One''.

[[File:Watain3.jpg|thumb|[[Watain]] singer Erik Danielsson in torn clothes and covered with blood]]
According to Erik Danielsson, when his band Watain formed in 1998 there were very few bands who took black metal as seriously as the early Norwegian scene had.<ref name=blackmetalsatanica/> A newer generation of Swedish Satanic bands like Watain and [[Ondskapt]], supposedly inspired by [[Ofermod]],<ref>Nathan T.

A part of the underground scene adopted a [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] interpretation of the church burnings and other acts of the early scene as the re-emergence of ancient archetypes, which Kadmon of [[Allerseelen]] and the authors of ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos]]'' had implied in their writings,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=176f}}<ref name=paganfront/> and mixed this interpretation with Paganism and an interest in Nationalism.<ref name=paganfront/> Varg Vikernes was seen as "an ideological messiah" by some,<ref name=decibelnsbm>J. Bennett: [http://web.archive.org/web/20080208184453/http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features/may2006/nsbm.aspx ''NSBM Special Report''].</ref> although Vikernes had disassociated himself from black metal<ref name=decibelnsbm/>{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=102}} and his neo-Nazism had nothing to do with that subculture.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=102}} This led to the rise of [[National Socialist black metal]] (NSBM), which Hendrik Möbus of [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] calls "the logical conclusion" of the Norwegian black metal "movement".<ref name=paganfront/> Other parts of the scene oppose NSBM as it is "indelibly linked with Asá Trŭ and opposed to Satanism", or look upon Nazism "with vague skepticism and indifference".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=99}} Members of the NSBM scene, among others, see the Norwegian bands as [[poseur]]s whose "ideology is cheap", although they still respect Vikernes and Burzum, whom Grand Belial's Key vocalist Richard Mills called "the only Norwegian band that remains unapologetic and literally convicted of his beliefs".<ref name=decibelnsbm/>

In France, besides Les Légions Noires (The Black Legions), a NSBM scene arose. Members of French band Funeral desecrated a grave in [[Toulon]] in June 1996, and a 19-year-old black metal fan stabbed a priest to death in [[Mulhouse]] on Christmas Eve 1996.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=312-315}} According to MkM of [[Antaeus (band)|Antaeus]], the early French scene "was quite easy to divide: either you were NSBM and you had the support from zine and the audience, or you were part of the black legions and you had that 'cult' aura... Since Antaeus was a band from Paris, not performing NSBM nor 'Scandinavan black metal' with all its cliché, we did not fit anywhere, yet we never did change to adapt".<ref>Ankit: [http://infernal-dominion.blogspot.de/2011/08/interview-with-mkm-from-antaeus-and.html ''Interview with MKM from Antaeus and Aosoth (French Black Metal)''], 23 August 2011, accessed on 31 December 2012.</ref> Many French bands, like [[Deathspell Omega]], have an avantgarde approach<ref>Jan Jaedike: ''Merrimack''.

In Australia, a scene led by bands like [[Deströyer 666]], [[Vomitor]], [[Hobbs' Angel of Death]], [[Nocturnal Graves]] and [[Gospel of the Horns]] arose. This scene's typical style is a mixture of old school black metal and raw thrash metal influenced by old Celtic Frost, Bathory, Venom and Sodom but also with its own elements.<ref>Götz Kühnemund: ''Gospel of the Horns''.

In Italy, the first black metal bands since Death SS and Mortuary Drape were [[Necromass]], [[Sulphuria]] and [[Apolokia]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}<!-- See version history.

The early American black metal bands remained underground. Some of them—like [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]]—joined an international NSBM organization called the Pagan Front, although Judas Iscariot sole member [[Andrew Harris (musician)|Akhenaten]] left the organization.

== Stylistic divisions ==
Regarding the sound of black metal, there are two conflicting groups within the genre: "those that stay true to the genre's roots, and those that introduce progressive elements".<ref name=murdermusic/> The former believe that the music should always be [[Minimalism|minimalist]] – performed only with the standard guitar-bass-drums setup and recorded in a [[low fidelity]] style.

Since the 1990s, different styles of black metal have emerged and some have melded Norwegian-style black metal with other genres.
* '''[[Symphonic black metal]]''' is a style of black metal that incorporates [[Symphony|symphonic]] and [[orchestra]]l elements. This may include the usage of instruments found in symphony orchestras (piano, violin, [[cello]], flute and keyboards), "clean" or operatic vocals and guitars with less distortion.<!-- Please do not add bands, as there is a list in the main article. -->

== Ideology ==
[[File:Taake Hellfest 2009 8 NB.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Taake]] vocalist Høst – the [[Cross of St. Peter|inverted Christian cross]] is often used by black metallers to signify their opposition to Christianity]]

Bands that were part of the 'first wave' had 'Satanic' imagery and lyrics, although most of them were not Satanists.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=16}} However, for the early 'second wave' bands in Norway, Satanism as an ideology defined black metal.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}}{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=7f}} Another part of the scene adopted Paganism, "often coupled with nationalism",{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=313}} although the early Pagan bands did not call themselves 'black metal'.<ref name=halupczok/><ref name=enslavedfrost/><ref name=nordicmetal/> Bands associating themselves with black metal are generally [[anti-Christian sentiment|opposed to Christianity]]<ref name=sam/> and the other major religions. Arguably, this is the only shared belief among those calling their music black metal. Artists who oppose Christianity tend to promote [[atheism]], [[antitheism]], paganism or Satanism.<ref name=sam/> Many artists also write lyrics that appear to be [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] and [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]].<ref name=murdermusic/>

An article in the [[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] webzine noted that "An overriding feature of almost all black metal is the fascination with the past".<ref name=chonicles>{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/rants/6-668_black_metal_a_brief_guide.aspx |title=CoC : Rant : Black Metal: A Brief Guide |last=Kalis |first=Quentin |date=31 August 2004 |work=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] |accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref> Regarding this, Aaron Weaver from [[Wolves in the Throne Room]] said: "I think that black metal is an artistic movement that is critiquing modernity on a fundamental level, saying that the modern world view is missing something".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2009/05/an_interview_w_13.html |title=An Interview w/ Wolves in the Throne Room's Aaron Weaver |date=22 May 2009 |work=brooklynvegan.com |accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref> As part of this, some black metal artists have written about or focused on the ancient pre-Christian cultures of their homelands. [[Sam Dunn]] noted of the Norwegian scene that "unlike any other heavy metal scene, the culture and the place is incorporated into the music and imagery".<ref name=sam/> In a Norwegian documentary, [[Fenriz]] stated that "black metal is individualism above all",<ref>{{cite video |title=Norsk Black Metal |year=2003 |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> and artists tend to be supportive of [[individualism]],<ref name=sam/> although followers of Euronymous tended towards support of anti-individualism.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}} According to Benjamin Hedge Olson's master thesis, "Black Metal is characterized by a conflict between radical individualism and group identity and by an attempt to accept both polarities simultaneously".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=2}}

Olson writes that some artists hold a belief similar to [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalists]]. They try to leave or "transcend" their physical form and receive knowledge from a higher being.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=4}} They are dissatisfied with a "world that they feel is devoid of spiritual and cultural significance",{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=129}} want to rise above it and challenge "this secularism with religious fanaticism".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=38}} Olson calls the concerts by these bands "musical rituals designed to achieve both scenic solidarity and mystical transcendence"{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} and considers the "[a]cknowledgment that the performers, through ritual performance, have transcended their mundane, physical forms and taken on a spiritual persona associated with the deity" as a typical step of black metal concerts he attended.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=41}}

Some prominent musicians within the scene hold that black metal does not need to represent any particular ideology. For example, [[Jan Axel Blomberg]] (Hellhammer) said in an interview with ''Metal Library'' that "In my opinion, black metal today is just music".<ref name=hellhammerinterview>{{cite web |url=http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=fi&sl=ru&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metallibrary.ru%2Farticles%2Finterviews%2F96.html |title=Article: Interview |date=7 January 2007 |work=metallibrary.ru |publisher=Open Publishing |language=Russian (Google-translated to English) |accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref> Likewise, [[Sigurd Wongraven]] has said that black metal "doesn't necessarily have to be all Satanic, as long as it's dark".<ref name=murdermusic/> Eric Horner commented: "Though many bands base it on Satanic belief, I disagree that it is the only way to be 'black metal'. Black metal to me is pure emotion and individuality with a real vibe to it".<ref name=throneofmalediction/> However, an article in Metalion's ''Slayer'' fanzine attacked musicians that "care more about their guitars than the actual essence onto which the whole concept was and is based upon", and insisted that "the music itself doesn't come as the first priority".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kristiansen |first=Jon |year=2011 |title=Worship Him! |journal=Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries |location=[[Brooklyn]], New York |publisher=Bazillion Points Books |page=467}}</ref>

=== Satanism ===
[[File:Pentagram4.svg|thumb|150px|right|The downward-pointing [[pentagram]] is commonly used by bands in the genre]]

Black metal was originally a term for extreme metal bands with Satanic lyrics and imagery. However, most of the 'first wave' bands (including Venom, who coined the term 'black metal') were not Satanists and merely used it to provoke. One of the few exceptions was [[Mercyful Fate]] singer and [[Church of Satan]] member [[King Diamond]], whom [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] calls "one of the only performers of the '80s Satanic metal who was more than just a [[poseur]] using a devilish image for [[shock value]]".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=16}}

In the early 1990s, many Norwegian black metalers presented themselves as misanthropic Devil worshippers{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=7f}} who wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil. Mayhem's Euronymous was the key figure behind this ideology.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}} They attacked the Church of Satan for its "freedom and life-loving" views.<ref name=killyourself2>Esa Lahdenpera: [http://web.archive.org/web/20120207234358/http://www.fmp666.com/moonlight/mayhem.html ''Northern Black Metal Legends'']. In: ''Kill Yourself'', no. 2, August 1993. Retrieved 30 January 2013.</ref> The [[theistic Satanism]] they espoused was an inversion of Christianity. Benjamin Hedge Olson wrote that they "transform[ed] Venom's quasi-Satanic stage theatrics into a form of cultural expression unique from other forms of metal or Satanism" and "abandoned the mundane identities and ambitions of other forms of metal in favor of religious and ideological fanaticism".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}} Euronymous professed to be in favor of [[totalitarianism]] and against individualism, compassion, peace, happiness and fun.<ref name=killyourself/> When asked why such statements were made to the press, [[Ihsahn]] of Emperor said that this "was very much to create fear among people".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=222}} He added that the scene wanted "to be in opposition to society" and focused "more on just being 'evil' than having a real Satanic philosophy".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=218f}} According to ''Lords of Chaos'', many who knew Euronymous—such as [[Kjetil Manheim]],<ref name=purefucking/><!--the documentary makes clear that Manheim remained friends with Euronymous long after leaving the band--> Vikernes<ref name=untilthelight/> and Blackthorn{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=134}}—say that his "extreme Satanic image" was an act.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=137}} [[Mortiis]], however, said that Euronymous "was such a devil worshipper you wouldn't believe it",<ref>Ian Christe: ''Sound of the Beast: the Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal''. New York, NY: Harper Collins, 2004.</ref> and Metalion (who knew Euronymous since 1985{{sfn|Kristiansen|2011|p=39}} and considered him to be his best friend{{sfn|Kristiansen|2011|p=266-269}}) said that Euronymous "was always telling what he thought [...] worshipping death and being extreme".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=39}} Tenebris (allegedly Jon Nödtveidt<ref>Jon Kristiansen: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points Books 2011.{{page needed|date=November 2012}}</ref>) from the [[Temple of the Black Light|Misanthropic Luciferian Order]] wrote that the Norwegian scene was mainly concerned with ideological Satanism and "vanished with his death in '93".<ref>''MLO''.

Some bands have moved from Satanism to Paganism; as black metal traditionally is defined by Satanism, "for many 'purist' black metallers, this latter move disqualifies a band as 'black', placing it instead beneath a variety of other modifiers: pagan, Viking, troll, forest, and the like".<ref>{{cite book |last=Mulvany |first=Aaron Patrick |date=May 2000 |title='Re-Awakening Pride Once Lost': Indigeneity and European Folk Metal |publisher=Wesleyan University |location=Middletown, Connecticut |page=IV}}</ref>

Others shun the belief in Satan, seeing it as "Judeo-Christian" in origin,<ref>Varg Vikernes: [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story03.shtml "A Burzum Story: Part III - The Lie-Propaganda"].

However, with his [[Under the Sign of the Black Mark|third]] and [[Blood Fire Death|fourth]] albums he began "attacking Christianity from a different angle", realizing that Satanism is a "Christian product" and seeing them both as "religious hocus-pocus".<ref name=bathory-lyrics/> Nevertheless, some artists use Satan as a symbol or metaphor for their beliefs.

=== Unblack metal ===
{{Main|Unblack metal}}

Unblack metal, or Christian black metal, is music that sounds musically similar to black metal but with artists, lyrics, and imagery that promote [[Christianity]].<ref name=kapelovitz>{{cite journal |last=Kapelovitz |first=Dan |year=2001 |month=February |title=Heavy Metal Jesus Freaks - Headbanging for Christ |journal=Mean Magazine |url=http://www.kapelovitz.com/christianmetal.htm |accessdate=6 September 2007 |quote=And where secular black metal thrived, so did its Christian counterpart, unblack metal, with names like [[Satanicide]], Neversatan, and Satan's Doom. |ref=harv}}</ref> The Australian band [[Horde (band)|Horde]]'s debut album ''[[Hellig Usvart]]'', released through [[Nuclear Blast]] in 1994, is often credited as being the first Christian black metal album, although the sole member, known as Anonymous, has stated that "there were similar [unblack] bands prior to Horde, even in Norway", referring to such bands as [[Antestor]], who formed in 1990, although prior to 1993 they were a [[death/doom]] band bearing a different name, Crush Evil. ''Hellig Usvart'' caused great controversy in the black metal scene, and death threats were sent to Nuclear Blast Records headquarters demanding them to release the members' names. The name of Anonymous was later revealed as [[Jayson Sherlock]], a drummer for the bands [[Mortification (band)|Mortification]] and [[Paramaecium]].

Many in the black metal scene see "Christian black metal" as an oxymoron.<ref name=ultimatemetal/> On the British black metal documentary ''[[Murder Music: A History of Black Metal]]'' (2007), all interviewed musicians stated, when asked about the matter, that black metal cannot be Christian.<ref name=murdermusic/> The term "Christian black metal" drew mocking replies from black metal musicians, for example [[Martin Walkyier]] of the English metal band [[Sabbat (English band)|Sabbat]] commented: "'Christian black metal?' What do they do? Do they build churches? Do they repair them? ''(laughs)''".<ref name=murdermusic/> In fact, the early unblack metal groups Horde and Antestor refused to call their music "black metal" because they felt that the term was strongly associated with Satanism.

=== National Socialist black metal ===
{{Main|National Socialist black metal}}

National Socialist black metal (NSBM) is black metal music by artists who promote [[Nazism|National Socialist (Nazi)]] or similar beliefs through their lyrics and imagery. The ideology of such bands is typically a mix of paganism, [[white supremacy]], [[white separatism]] and [[antisemitism]]. However, some bands meld these beliefs with Satanism or occultism, rather than paganism. NSBM is not seen as a distinct genre, but as a [[neo-völkisch movements|neo-völkisch movement]] or subculture within black metal. Varg Vikernes was the first to bring such views into the scene.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=303}}{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=103}} Although his music has always been non-political, he began to express such views in writings and interviews after his arrest in 1993. However, he has since distanced himself from the NSBM scene and, although he still holds such beliefs, he refers to himself as an "[[Odalism|Odalist]]" rather than a National Socialist or fascist.<ref name=burzum.org>{{cite web |url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story07.shtml |title=A Burzum Story: Part VII - The Nazi Ghost |last=Vikernes |first=Varg |authorlink=Varg Vikernes |date=July 2005 |work=burzum.org |accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref> Some black metal bands have made references to [[Nazi Germany]] for [[shock value]], causing them to be wrongly labeled as NSBM.
