The '''Australian Broadcasting Corporation''' ('''ABC''') is Australia's national [[public broadcasting|public broadcaster]]. With a total annual budget of A$1.18&nbsp;billion,<ref name="budgetreport">Budget Paper No. 4 2010–2011. Retrieved 3 January 2012 "http://www.budget.gov.au/2010-11/content/bp4/html/bp4_agency_resourcing_4_bcde.htm"</ref> the corporation provides television, radio, online and mobile services throughout metropolitan and regional Australia, as well as overseas through the [[Australia Network]] and [[Radio Australia]].

Founded in 1929 as the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]], it was subsequently made a state-owned corporation on 1 July 1932, as the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''<ref name="abc-act83" /> changed the name of the organisation to the ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation'', effective 1 July 1983.<ref name="abc-act83" /> Although funded and owned by the government, the ABC remains [[editorial independence|editorially independent]] as ensured through the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983.<ref name="abc-act83" />

Following a 1927 [[royal commission]] inquiry into radio licensing issues, the government established the National Broadcasting Service which subsequently took over a number of the larger funded stations. It also nationalised the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]] which had been created by entertainment interests to supply programs to various radio stations.<ref name="langdon95" /> On 1 July 1932, the  Australian Broadcasting Commission was established, taking over the operations of the National Broadcasting Service and eventually establishing offices in each of Australia's capital cities.<ref name="langdon95" /><ref name=ABC010712>{{cite web |title=ABC celebrates 80 years of broadcasting|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date= (1 July 2012)|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-01/abc-celebrates-80-years/4103108

[[File:The start of TV ABC.ogv|thumb|The first broadcast of ABC TV – presented by [[Michael Charlton]], 5 November 1956]]
The commission commenced television broadcasting in Sydney and Melbourne in 1956. [[ABN-2]] Sydney was inaugurated by the Prime Minister, [[Robert Menzies]], on 5 November with [[ABV-2]] Melbourne following two weeks later, on 18 November. These two stations were later joined by additional services in Brisbane ([[ABQ-2]]), Adelaide ([[ABS-2]]), Perth ([[ABW-2]]), Hobart ([[ABT-2]]) and, eventually, Darwin ([[ABD-6]]). [[James Dibble]] read the first television news bulletin for the ABC.<ref>Australian Broadcasting Corporation, [http://www.abc.net.au/corp/history/galpost9.htm "About the ABC: History of the ABC: James Dibble"]. Retrieved 3 September 2008.</ref>

[[File:Jamesdibble.jpg|thumb|[[James Dibble]], reading the first [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] bulletin in 1956]]
Although radio programs could be distributed nationally by [[landline]], television relay facilities were not put in place until the early 1960s.<ref name="abc-50s">{{cite web

In 1975, colour television was introduced into Australia, and within a decade the ABC had moved into satellite broadcasting, greatly enhancing its ability to distribute content nationally. In the same year, the ABC introduced a 24-hour-a-day AM rock station in Sydney, 2JJ ([[Double Jay (radio network)|Double Jay]]), which was eventually expanded into the national [[Triple J]] FM network.<ref name="abc-60s70s" /> A year later, a national [[classical music]] network was established on the [[frequency modulation|FM]] band, broadcasting from Adelaide. It was initially known as ABC-FM – referring both to its 'fine music' programming and radio frequency.<ref name="abc-60s70s">{{cite web

In 1978 the ABC NSW Staff Association organised a strike against budget cuts and political interference. Sydney ABC was off air for four days.<ref>Molomby, Tom, ''Is there a moderate on the roof? ABC Years'', William Heinemann Australia, Port Melbourne, 1991, p.110</ref> A packed free concert in support was held at the [[Regent Theatre (Sydney)|Regent Theatre]] and compered by [[Bob Hudson (singer)|Bob Hudson]]. It featured [[Fred Dagg]] and [[Robyn Archer]].<ref>Molomby, Tom, ''Is there a moderate on the roof? ABC Years'', William Heinemann Australia, Port Melbourne, 1991, p.114</ref>

The ABC budget began to decline in 1976 and was not reversed until 1985. However, Tom Molomby writes:
:"The effects of the budget reductions had been so badly handled that the organisation was to remain seriously crippled for years."<ref>Molomby, Tom, ''Is there a moderate on the roof? ABC Years'', William Heinemann Australia, Port Melbourne, 1991, p.160</ref>

===1980s–90s===
The ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''<ref name = "abc-act83"/> changed the name of the organisation from the "Australian Broadcasting Commission" to the "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", effective 1 July 1983.<ref name="abc-act83" /> At the same time, the newly formed Corporation underwent significant restructuring – program production in [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] affairs, comedy, social history and current affairs was significantly expanded, while the Corporation's output of drama was boosted.<ref name="abc-80s" /> Local production trebled from 1986–91 with the assistance of co-production, co-financing, and pre-sales arrangements.<ref name="abc-80s">{{cite web | title = About the ABC – The 80s

The changes also led to the split of television and radio operations into two separate divisions, with an overhaul of management, finance, property and engineering.<ref name="abc-80s" /> [[Geoffrey Whitehead (communications)|Geoffrey Whitehead]]<ref>2012 publication by Geoffrey Whitehead "Tending the Flame of Democracy"| http://bookstore.iuniverse.com/Products/SKU-000538367/Tending-the-Flame-of-Democracy.aspx retrieved June 26, 2013</ref> was the initial managing director; however, following his resignation in 1986, [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]] (at the time chair of the ABC Board) took over his position.

A new Concert Music Department was formed in 1985 to coordinate the corporation's six symphony orchestras, which in turn received a greater level of autonomy to better respond to local needs.<ref name="abc-80s" /> Open-air free concerts and tours, educational activities, and joint ventures with other music groups were undertaken at the time to expand the Orchestras' audience reach.<ref name="abc-80s" />

ABC Radio was restructured significantly in 1985 – Radio One became the Metropolitan network, while Radio 2 became known as [[Radio National]] (callsigns, however, were not standardised until 1990). New programs such as ''The World Today'', ''Australia All Over'', and ''The Coodabeen Champions'' were introduced, while [[ABC Classic FM|ABC-FM]] established an Australian Music Unit in 1989.<ref name="abc-80s" /> [[Radio Australia]] began to focus on the Asia-Pacific region, with coverage targeted at the south west and central Pacific, south-east Asia, and north Asia. Radio Australia also carried more news coverage, with special broadcasts during the [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|1987 Fijian coup]], [[Tiananmen Square massacre]], and the [[First Gulf War]].<ref name="abc-80s" />

[[File:ABC Sydney.jpg|thumb|The ABC's Sydney headquarters in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]].]]

The ABC Multimedia Unit was established in July 1995, to manage the new ABC website (launched in August). Funding was allocated later that year specifically for online content, as opposed to reliance on funding for television and radio content. The first online election coverage was put together in 1996, and included news, electorate maps, candidate information and live results.<ref name="abc-90s" />

By the early 1990s, all major ABC broadcasting outlets moved to 24 hour-a-day operation, while regional radio coverage in Australia was extended with 80 new transmitters.<ref name="abc-90s" /> Live television broadcasts of selected parliamentary sessions started in 1990.<ref name="abc-90s" /> [[ABC NewsRadio]], a continuous news network broadcast on the [[Parliamentary and News Network]] when parliament is not sitting, was launched on 5 October 1994.<ref name="abc-90s" />

International television service [[Australia Television International]] was established in 1993, while at the same Radio Australia increased its international reach.<ref name="abc-90s" /> Reducing funding in 1997 for Radio Australia resulted in staff and programming cuts.<ref name="abc-90s" />

''Australia Television'' was sold to the [[Seven Network]] in 1998, however the service continued to show [[ABC News and Current Affairs|ABC news and current affairs programming]] up until its closure in 2001.<ref name="mr">{{cite web

===2000s===
In 2001, digital television commenced after four years of preparation.<ref name="abc-00s" /> In readiness, the ABC had fully digitised its production, post-production and transmission facilities – heralded at the time as "the greatest advance in television technology since the introduction of colour".<ref name="abc-00s" /> The first programmes to be produced in widescreen were drama series ''[[Something in the Air (TV series)|Something in the Air]]'', ''[[Grass Roots (TV series)|Grass Roots]]'' and ''In the Mind of the Architect''.

At the same time, the ABC's Multimedia division was renamed "ABC New Media", becoming an output division of the ABC alongside Television and Radio.<ref name="abc-00s" /> Legislation allowed the ABC to provide 'multichannels' – additional, digital-only, television services managed by the New Media Division. Soon after the introduction of digital television in 2001, [[Fly TV]] and the [[ABC Kids channel]] launched, showing a mix of programming aimed at teenagers and children.

In 2002, the ABC launched [[Australia Network|ABC Asia Pacific]] – the replacement for the defunct Australia Television International operated previously by the Seven Network. Much like its predecessor, and companion radio network [[Radio Australia]], the service provided a mix of programming targeted at audiences throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Funding cuts in 2003 led to the closure of Fly TV and the ABC Kids channel.

The ABC launched a digital radio service, [[ABC DiG]], in November 2002, available though the internet and digital television, but not available through any other terrestrial broadcast until [[DAB+]] became available in 2009.

[[File:Abc2promo.jpg|thumb|[[ABC2]] launched on 7 March 2005]]
[[ABC2]], a second attempt at a digital-only television channel, launched on 7 March 2005. Unlike its predecessors the new service was not dependent on government funding, instead running on a budget of A$3&nbsp;million per year.<ref name="whoseabc">{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Kenneth Stanley |title=Whose ABC?

A high incidence of breast cancer in female staff working at the ABC's offices in Brisbane led to the closure of the site, based in [[Toowong, Queensland|Toowong]], on 21 December 2006.

Until 1948, the ABC was funded directly by radio licence fees; amendments were also made to the ''Australian Broadcasting Act'' that meant the ABC would receive its funding directly from the federal government. Licence fees remained until 1973 when they were abolished by the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Labor government, on the basis that the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for government-owned radio and television broadcasters.<ref name="whoseabc" />

==Services==

===Radio===
[[File:ABC Building South Bank.jpg|thumb |right|The ABC's Brisbane headquarters in South Bank]]

{{Main|ABC Radio and Regional Content}}
The ABC operates 54 local radio stations, in addition to four national networks and international service [[Radio Australia]]. In addition, [[ABC DiG|DiG Radio]] launched on digital platforms in 2002, currently offering three separate stations.

[[ABC Local Radio]] is the Corporation's flagship radio station in each broadcast area. There are 54 individual stations, each with a similar format consisting of locally presented light entertainment, news, talk back, music, sport and interviews, in addition to some national programming such as ''AM'', ''PM'', ''[[The World Today (Australian radio programme)|The World Today]]'', sporting events and ''Nightlife''.

[[ABC Radio National]] broadcasts more than 60 special interest programmes per week covering a range of topics including music, comedy, book readings, radio dramas, poetry, science, health, the arts, religion, social history and current affairs.

[[ABC NewsRadio]] is a rolling news service, previously known as the [[Parliamentary and News Network]]. The service was established to broadcast federal parliamentary sittings, to relieve the local ABC radio network from this intermittent task, and to provide a news service at other times. The network broadcasts news on a 24/7 format with updates on the quarter-hour. Much of its news content is produced by the ABC itself, however many programmes are relayed from the [[BBC World Service]], [[National Public Radio|NPR]], [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Radio Netherlands]] and [[CNN Radio]].

[[ABC Classic FM]] was the ABC's first FM radio service. It was originally known simply as "ABC FM", and for a short time{{quantify|eg "until [year] as"|date=April 2013}} "ABC Fine Music". Its format borrowed heavily from community stations that eventually founded the Fine Music Network, as well as [[BBC Radio 3]].

[[Triple J]] is the national youth radio network, and broadcasts contemporary alternative and independent music; it is targeted at people aged 18–35. While the network plays music from around the world, it has a strong focus on local artists. Triple J was formerly known as "Double Jay" when it launched in Sydney on 19 January 1975.

===Television===
{{Main|ABC Television}}

Within Australia, the ABC operates four channels. [[ABC1]], the Corporation's original television service, receives the bulk of funding for television and shows first-run comedy, drama, documentaries, and [[ABC News and Current Affairs|news and current affairs]]. In each [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] a local [[ABC News (Australia)|news bulletin]] is shown at 7.00&nbsp;p.m. nightly.

In 2001 [[ABC Television|ABC TV]] launched its digital service.

[[ABC2]], launched in 2005, is a [[digital television in Australia|digital-only]] channel that shows repeated programmes from ABC1, as well as some original content including news programmes, children's shows, animation, and music shows.

In September 2007, the [[Australian government]] announced a proposal to launch a new digital-only children's channel, to be named [[ABC3]].<ref name="abc3">{{cite news

An experimental Multimedia Unit was established in 1995, charged with developing policy for the ABC's work in web publishing.<ref name="abc-90s" /> This unit continued until 2000, when the New Media division was formed, bringing together the ABC's online output as a division similar to Television or Radio.<ref name="abc-00s" /> The division had over a million pages of material published by late 2003.<ref name="abc-00s" />

In 2001 the New Media division became New Media and Digital Services, reflecting the broader remit to develop content for digital platforms such as [[digital television]]. In addition to ABC Online, the division also had responsibility over the ABC's two digital television services, [[Fly TV]] and the [[ABC Kids channel]], until their closure in 2003.<ref>{{cite web

In conjunction with the ABC's radio division, New Media and Digital Services implemented the ABC's first [[podcast]]s in December 2004. By mid-2006 the ABC had become an international leader in podcasting with over fifty podcast programmes delivering hundreds of thousands of downloads per week,<ref name="podcasting">{{cite web

This became known as the ABC Concert Music Division, which was controlled by the Federal Director of Music – the first of whom was [[William G. James|W. G. James]].<ref>Phillip Sametz:  Play On, ABC Books, Sydney, 1992; p. 35</ref>
There are currently six state symphony orchestras:
* [[Adelaide Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[Queensland Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[West Australian Symphony Orchestra]]

The orchestras were corporatised in the 1990s,<ref name="abc-90s" /> and were divested into independent companies on 1 January 2007.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/corp/history/75years/timeline/orchestras.pdf</ref>

== Lissajous curve logo==

[[File:Lissajous-Figur 1 zu 3 (Oszilloskop).jpg|200px|thumbnail|The Lissajous figure on an oscilloscope, on which Bill Kennard designed the current logo.]]

The ABC logo is one of the most recognisable logos in Australia. In the early years of television, the ABC had been using [[Lissajous curve]]s as fillers between programmes. In July 1963, the ABC conducted a staff competition to create a new logo for use on television, stationery, publications, microphone badges and ABC vehicles.<ref name="atvh-50s60s">{{cite web |title=AusTVHistory: Australian Broadcasting Corporation 1950s–1960s |url=http://www.austvhistory.com/abc/index.htm |publisher=Aus TV History |author=Brooklyn Ross-Hulands |accessdate=4 October 2007 |archiveurl = http://replay.web.archive.org/20081007030333/http://www.austvhistory.com/abc/index.htm |archivedate = 7 October 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Memoirs of a Space Engineer – about Doug Rickard | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 19 October 2000 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/slab/memoirs/about.htm | accessdate =30 January 2008 }}</ref> In 1965, ABC graphics designer Bill Kennard, who had been experimenting with telerecording of the [[cathode ray oscilloscope]] displays, submitted a design which was part of the waveform from an oscilloscope. The letters "ABC" were added to the design and it was adopted as the ABC's official logo. Kennard was presented with [[Australian pound|£]]25 for his design.<ref name="atvh-50s60s"/>

Since its original introduction in 1965, it has been updated several times, including with the introduction of colour television in 1975. The line was thickened to feature colour in the logo. The 1975 logo is the longest-running logo, with a lifespan of 27 years. In 2001, with the introduction of digital television in Australia, ABC Television adopted a modified version of the logo, featuring a silver 3D look and losing the "over and under" design. However, despite the launch of this logo, the 1975 logo is still used by the corporation. In July 2002, to celebrate the ABC's 70th anniversary, the corporation adopted a new logo across all media. This new logo still used the silver 3D colour but reverted to its "over and under" design. The 2002 logo is still in use today.
