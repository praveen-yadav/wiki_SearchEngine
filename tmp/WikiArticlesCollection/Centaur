A '''centaur''' ({{IPA-en|ˈsɛntɔː(r)|pron}}; {{lang-el|Κένταυρος}}, ''Kéntauros'', {{Lang-la|centaurus}}) or '''hippocentaur'''<ref>[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Hippocentaur thefreedictionary.com]</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Hippocentaur dictionary.reference.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.definitions.net/definition/hippocentaur definitions.net]</ref> is a [[Greek mythology|mythological]] [[List of legendary creatures|creature]] with the head, arms, and torso of a [[human]] and the body and legs of a [[horse]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of centaur|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/centaur?q=centaur|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref>

In early [[Attica|Attic]] and [[Beotia]]n [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase-paintings]] (see [[#Earliest representations|below]]), they are depicted with the hindquarters of a horse attached to them; in later renderings centaurs are given the torso of a human joined at the waist to the horse's [[withers]], where the horse's neck would be.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

This half-human and half-horse composition has led many writers to treat them as [[liminal being]]s, caught between the two natures, embodied in contrasted myths, both as the embodiment of untamed nature, as in their battle with the [[Lapith]]s (their kin), or conversely as teachers, like [[Chiron]].

The centaurs were usually said to have been born of [[Ixion]] and [[Nephele]] (the cloud made in the image of [[Hera]]). Another version, however, makes them children of a certain [[Centaurus (Greek mythology)|Centaurus]], who mated with the [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]]n mares. This Centaurus was either himself the son of Ixion and Nephele (inserting an additional generation) or of [[Apollo]] and [[Stilbe]], daughter of the river god [[Peneus]]. In the later version of the story his twin brother was [[Lapithes (hero)|Lapithes]], ancestor of the [[Lapith]]s, thus making the two warring peoples cousins.

Centaurs were said to have inhabited the region of Magnesia and Mount [[Pelion]] in [[Thessaly]], the [[Foloi oak forest]] in [[Elis]], and the Malean peninsula in southern [[Laconia]]. They continued to feature in literary forms of [[Roman mythology]]. A pair of them draw the chariot of [[Constantine I|Constantine the Great]] and his family in the [[Great Cameo of Constantine]]{{clarify|date=February 2013}} (''c''314-16), which embodies wholly pagan imagery.<ref>The Great Cameo of Constantine, formerly in the collection of [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and now in the Geld en Bankmuseum, Utrecht, is illustrated, for instance, in Paul Stephenson, ''Constantine, Roman Emperor, Christian Victor'', 2010:fig. 53.</ref>

==Centauromachy==
[[File:Centauromachy Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2640.jpg|thumb|Centauromachy, tondo of an [[Red-figure pottery|Attic red-figure]] [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]], ca. 480 BC]]
The Centaurs are best known for their fight with the [[Lapith]]s, which was caused by their attempt to carry off [[Hippodamia (wife of Pirithous)|Hippodamia]] and the rest of the Lapith women on the day of Hippodamia's marriage to [[Pirithous]], king of the Lapithae, himself the son of Ixion. The strife among these cousins is a metaphor for the conflict between the lower appetites and civilized behavior in humankind. [[Theseus]], a hero and founder of cities, who happened to be present, threw the balance in favour of the right order of things, and assisted Pirithous. The Centaurs were driven off or destroyed.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Theseus,'' 30.</ref><ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' xii. 210.</ref><ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]]iv. pp. 69-70.</ref> Another Lapith hero, [[Caeneus]], who was invulnerable to weapons, was beaten into the earth by Centaurs wielding rocks and the branches of trees. Centaurs are thought of in many Greek myths as wild as untamed horses. Like the [[Titanomachy]], the defeat of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s by the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]], the contests with the Centaurs typify the struggle between civilization and barbarism.

The Centauromachy is most famously portrayed in the [[Parthenon]] [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]] by [[Phidias]] and in a Renaissance-era sculpture by [[Battle of the Centaurs (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo]].

==Earliest representations==
[[File:Cantharus Stathatou Louvre CA1987.jpg|left|thumb|[[Boeotia]]n ''[[kantharos]]'', [[Geometric art|Late Geometric period]]]]
The tentative identification of two fragmentary Mycenaean terracotta figures as centaurs,  among the extensive Mycenaean pottery found at [[Ugarit]], suggests a [[Bronze Age]] origin for these creatures of myth.<ref>Ione Mylonas Shear, "Mycenaean Centaurs at Ugarit" ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' (2002:147–153); but see the interpretation relating them to "abbreviated group" figures at the [[Temple of Aphaea|Bronze-Age sanctuary of Aphaia]] and elsewhere, presented by Korinna Pilafidis-Williams, "No Mycenaean Centaurs Yet", ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''124''' (2004), p. 165, which concludes "we had perhaps do best not to raise hopes of a continuity of images across the divide between the Bronze Age and the historical period."</ref> A painted terracotta centaur was found in the "Hero's tomb" at [[Lefkandi]], and by the Geometric period, centaurs figure among the first representational figures painted on Greek pottery. An often-published [[Geometric art|Geometric period]] bronze of a warrior face-to-face with a centaur is at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/17.190.2072 Metropolitan Museum of Art] Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref>

==Theories of origin==
The most common theory holds that the idea of centaurs came from the first reaction of a non-riding culture, as in the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Aegean Sea|Aegean world]], to nomads who were mounted on horses. The theory suggests that such riders would appear as half-man, half-animal ([[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] reported that the [[Aztec]]s had this misapprehension about Spanish cavalrymen).<ref>Stuart Chase, ''Mexico: A Study of Two Americas'', Chapter IV ([http://xroads.virginia.edu/~Hyper2/chase/ch04.html University of Virginia Hypertext]). Retrieved 24 April 2006.</ref> [[Domestication of the horse|Horse taming and horseback culture]] arose first in the southern [[steppe]] grasslands of [[Central Asia]], perhaps approximately in modern [[Kazakhstan]].

The Lapith tribe of Thessaly, who were the kinsmen of the Centaurs in myth, were described as the inventors of horse-back riding by Greek writers. The Thessalian tribes also claimed their horse breeds were descended from the centaurs.

[[File:Centaur nymph Marqueste Tuileries.jpg|thumb|Centaur carrying off a [[nymph]] (1892) by [[Laurent Marqueste]] ([[Tuileries Garden]], Paris)]]
Of the various Classical Greek authors who mentioned centaurs, [[Pindar]] was the first who describes undoubtedly a combined monster.<ref>"...that strange race was born, like to both parents, their mother’s form below, above their sire’s." (''Second Pythian Ode'').</ref> Previous authors ([[Homer]]) only use words such as ''pheres'' (cf. ''theres'', "beasts")<ref>For example, Homer ''Iliad'' i. 268, ii. 743. Compare the Hesiodic ''[[Shield of Heracles]]'', 104.</ref> that could also mean ordinary savage men riding ordinary horses. However, contemporaneous representations of hybrid centaurs can be found in [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic]] [[Greek art]].

[[Lucretius]] in his first century BC philosophical poem ''[[On the Nature of Things]]'' denied the existence of centaurs based on their differing rate of growth. He states that at three years old horses are in the prime of their life while, at three humans are still little more than babies, making hybrid animals impossible.<ref>Lucretius, ''On the Nature of Things'', book V, translated by William Ellery Leonard, 1916 ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Lucr.+5.878 The Perseus Project].) Retrieved 27 July 2008.</ref>

[[Robert Graves]] (relying on the work of [[Georges Dumezil]]<ref>Dumezil, ''Le Probleme des Centaures''  (Paris 1929) and ''Mitra-Varuna: An essay on two Indo-European representations of sovereignty'' (1948. tr. 1988).</ref> argued for tracing the centaurs back to the Indian [[gandharva]]), speculated that the centaurs were a dimly remembered, pre-Hellenic fraternal earth cult who had the horse as a [[totem]].<ref>Graves, ''The Greek Myths'', 1960 § 81.4; § 102 "Centaurs"; § 126.3;.</ref> A similar theory was incorporated into [[Mary Renault]]'s ''[[The Bull from the Sea]].'' [[Kinnara Kingdom|Kinnaras]], another half-man half-horse mythical creature from the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian mythology]], appeared in various ancient texts, arts as well as sculptures from all around India. It is shown as a horse with the torso of a man in place of where the horse's head has to be, that is similar to a Greek centaur.<ref>Devdutt Pattanaik, “Indian mythology : tales, symbols, and rituals from the heart of the Subcontinent” (Rochester, USA 2003)  P.74: ISBN 0-89281-870-0.</ref><ref>K. Krishna Murthy, ''Mythical Animals in Indian Art'' (New Delhi, India 1985).</ref>

The Greek word ''kentauros'' is generally regarded as of obscure origin.<ref>Alex Scobie, "The Origins of 'Centaurs'" ''Folklore'' '''89'''.2 (1978:142–147); Scobie quotes [[Martin P. Nilsson]], ''Geschichte der griechischen Religion'', 1955, "Die Etymologie und die Deutung der Ursprungs sind unsicher und mögen auf sich beruhen".</ref> The  [[etymology]] from ''ken – tauros'', "piercing bull-stickers" was a [[euhemerus|Euhemerist]] suggestion in [[Palaephatus]]' rationalizing text on Greek mythology, ''On Incredible Tales'' (Περὶ ἀπίστων): mounted archers from a village called ''[[Nephele]]'' eliminating a herd of bulls that were the scourge of Ixion's kingdom.<ref>Noted by Scobie 1978:142.</ref> Another possible related etymology can be "bull-slayer".<ref>[[Alexander Hislop]], in his polemic ''[[The Two Babylons]]: Papal Worship Revealed to be the Worship of Nimrod and His Wife''. (1853, revised 1858) theorized that the word is derived from the [[Semitic]] [[Kohen]] and "tor" (to go round) via [[phonetics|phonetic shift]] the less prominent [[consonant]]s being lost over time, with it developing into '''K'''h'''en''' '''Tor''' or ''Ken-Tor'', and being transliterated phonetically into [[Ionic Greek|Ionian]] as ''Kentaur'', but this is not accepted by any modern philologist.</ref> Some {{Who|date=March 2009}} say that the Greeks took the constellation of [[Centaurus]], and also its name "piercing bull", from [[Mesopotamia]], where it symbolized the god [[Baal]] who represents rain and fertility, fighting with and ''piercing'' with his horns the demon [[Mot (Semitic god)|Mot]] who represents the summer drought. In Greece, the constellation of Centaurus was noted by  [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] in the fourth century BC and by [[Aratus]] in the third century.

==Female centaurs==
[[File:GiorcesBardo55.jpg|thumb|Female centaurs flanking [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] (Mosaic from Roman Tunisia, 2nd century AD)]]
Though female centaurs, called [[Kentaurides]], are not mentioned in early Greek literature and art, they do appear occasionally in later antiquity. A [[Macedon]]ian mosaic of the 4th century BC<ref>Pella Archaeological Museum.</ref> is one of the earliest examples of the Centauress in art. [[Ovid]]<ref>Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 12. 210 ff., the name Hylonome is Greek so Ovid may have drawn her story from an earlier Greek writer.</ref> also mentions a centauress named [[Hylonome]] who committed suicide when her husband [[Cyllarus]] was killed in the war with the Lapiths.

In a description of a painting in [[Naples|Neapolis]], the Greek rhetorician [[Philostratus III|Philostratus the Elder]] describes them as sisters and wives of the male centaurs who live on Mount Pelion with their children.
<blockquote>
"How beautiful the Centaurides are, even where they are horses; for some grow out of white mares, others are attached to chestnut mares, and the coats of others are dappled, but they glisten like those of horses that are well cared for. There is also a white female Centaur that grows out of a black mare, and the very opposition of the colours helps to produce the united beauty of the whole."<ref>Philostratus the Elder, ''Imagines'' 2. 3.</ref></blockquote>

The idea, or possibility, of female centaurs was certainly known in early modern times, as evidenced by Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]'', Act IV, Scene vi, ln.124–125:
"Down from the waist they're centaurs, / Though women all above"

In the Disney animated film ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]'', during the [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Pastoral Symphony]], some of the main characters are female centaurs. However, the Disney studio called them "Centaurettes" instead of Kentaurides.

==Persistence in the medieval world==
[[File:Grape harvest Abbatiale Mozac 2007 06 30.jpg|thumb|Centaurs harvest grapes on a 12th-century capital from the [[Mozac Abbey]] in the [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]]]]

Centaurs preserved a [[Dionysus|Dionysian]] connection in the 12th century [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] carved [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of [[Mozac Abbey]] in the [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]], where other capitals depict harvesters, boys riding goats (a further Dionysiac theme) and [[griffin]]s guarding the [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] that held the wine.

Centaurs are shown on a number of [[Pictish]] carved stones from north-east [[Scotland]], erected in the 8th–9th centuries AD (e.g., at [[Meigle]], [[Perthshire]]).  Though outside the limits of the [[Roman Empire]], these depictions appear to be derived from Classical prototypes.

Jerome's version of the ''Life'' of St [[Anthony the Great]], the hermit monk of Egypt, written by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], was widely disseminated in the Middle Ages; it relates Anthony's encounter with a centaur, who challenged the saint but was forced to admit that the old gods had been overthrown. The episode was often depicted; notably, in the ''The Meeting of St Anthony Abbot and St Paul the Hermit'' by [[Stefano di Giovanni|Stefano di Giovanni called "Sassetta"]],<ref>[[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, DC: [http://www.wga.hu/support/viewer/z.html illustration].</ref> of two episodic depictions in a single panel of the [[Anthony the Great|hermit Anthony]]'s travel to greet the hermit Paul, one is his encounter along the pathway with the demonic figure of a centaur in a wood.

A centaur-like half-human half-equine creature called ''[[Polkan]]'' appeared in [[Russia]]n [[folk]] [[art]], and [[lubok]] prints of the 17th–19th centuries. Polkan is originally based on ''Pulicane'', a half-dog from [[Andrea da Barberino]]'s poem ''I Reali di Francia'', which was once popular in the Slavonic world in prosaic translations.

The [[John C. Hodges library at The University of Tennessee]] hosts a permanent exhibit of a "Centaur from [[Volos]]", in its library. The exhibit, made by sculptor Bill Willers, by combining a study human skeleton with the skeleton of a [[Shetland pony]] is entitled "Do you believe in Centaurs?" and was meant to mislead students in order to make them more critically aware, according to the exhibitors.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://notes.utk.edu/bio/unistudy.nsf/0/22d591ecc61a2cca85256efd00631d45?OpenDocument| volume=97| issue= 7 or 8| month= August 26| year= 2004| title=Library hails centaur’s 10th anniversary| first=Maggie| last=Anderson| accessdate=2006-09-21}}</ref>

Another exhibit by Willers is now on long term display at the International Wildlife Museum in Tucson, Arizona.  The full-mount skeleton of a Centaur, built by Skulls Unlimited International, is on display, along with several other fabled creatures, including the [[Cyclops]], [[Unicorn]] and Griffin.

A centaur is one of the symbols associated with both the [[Iota Phi Theta]] and the [[Delta Lambda Phi]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternities]]. Whereas centaurs in Greek mythology were generally symbolic of chaos and unbridled passions, Delta Lambda Phi's centaur is modeled after Chiron and represents [[honour|honor]], [[moderation]] and tempered [[masculinity]].

Similarly, [[C.S. Lewis]]' popular ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series depicts centaurs as the wisest and noblest of creatures. [[Narnian Centaurs]] are gifted at stargazing, prophecy, healing, and warfare, a fierce and valiant race always faithful to the High King [[Aslan]] the Lion. Lewis generally used the species to inspire awe in his readers. 

In [[J.K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, centaurs live in the Forbidden Forest close to Hogwarts, preferring to avoid contact with humans. Although different from those seen in Narnia, they live in societies called herds and are skilled at archery, healing and astrology. Although film depictions include very animalistic facial features, the reaction of the Hogwarts girls to Firenze suggests a more classical appearance.

With the exception of [[Chiron]], the centaurs in [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[Percy Jackson & the Olympians]]'' are seen as party-goers who use a lot of American slang. Chiron is more like the classical centaurs, being trainer of the heroes and skilled in archery. In Riordan's subsequent series, ''[[Heroes of Olympus]]'', another group of centaurs are depicted with more animalistic features (such as horns) and appear as villains, serving the [[Gigantes]].

[[Philip Jose Farmer]]'s ''[[World of Tiers]]'' series (1965) includes centaurs, called Half-Horses or Hoi Kentauroi. His creations address several of the metabolic problems of such creatures—how could the human mouth and nose intake sufficient air to sustain both itself and the horse body and, similarly, how could the human ingest sufficient food to sustain both parts.

[[Brandon Mull]]'s ''[[Fablehaven]]'' series features Centaurs that live in an area called Grunhold. The Centaurs are portrayed as a proud, elitist group of beings that consider themselves superior to all other creatures. The fourth book also has a variation on the species called an Alcetaur, which is part man, part moose.

Centaur appears in the novel by [[John Updike]] ([[The Centaur]], 1963). The author depicts a rural Pennsylvanian town as seen through the optics of the myth of Centaur. An unknown and marginalized local school teacher, just like the mythological Chiron did for Prometheus, gave up his life for the future of his son who had chosen to be an independent artist in New York.

In the series ''[[Animorphs]]'' written by [[K. A. Applegate]], a species called [[Andalite]]s appears. These animals are somewhat like a centaur except they are covered with blue  fur and have no mouths, eating instead from their hooves, and have extra eyes resting on stalks on their heads.

Centaur the nickname for intercollegiate athletics teams of Allentown College (CenterValley, Pennsylvania) and Purdue University-North Central (Westville, Indiana, from 1967 until 2003).
