The '''Battle of Peleliu''', codenamed '''Operation Stalemate II''', was fought between the [[United States]] and the [[Empire of Japan]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]], from September–November 1944 on the island of [[Peleliu]], present-day [[Palau]]. U.S. Marines of the [[First Marine Division]] and later soldiers of the U.S. Army's [[81st Infantry Division (United States)|81st Infantry Division]], fought to capture an [[airstrip]] on the small [[coral]] island. This battle was part of a larger offensive campaign known as [[Operation Forager]] which ran from June 1944 to November 1944 in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations]].

[[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[William Rupertus]], USMC—commander of 1st Marine Division—predicted the island would be secured within four days. However, due to Japan's well-crafted fortifications and stiff resistance,<ref>{{cite video

==Background==
By the summer of 1944, victories in the Southwest and [[Central Pacific Area|Central Pacific]] had brought the war closer to Japan, with American bombers able to strike at the Japanese main islands from air bases secured during the [[Mariana Islands campaign]] (June&mdash;August 1944). There was disagreement among the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff|U.S. Joint Chiefs]] over two proposed strategies to defeat the Japanese Empire. The strategy proposed by General [[Douglas MacArthur]] called for the recapture of the [[Philippines]], followed by the capture of [[Okinawa]], then an [[Operation Downfall|attack on the Japanese mainland]]. Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]] favored a more direct strategy of bypassing the Philippines, but seizing Okinawa and Taiwan as [[staging area]]s to an attack on the Japanese mainland, followed by the future invasion of Japan's southernmost islands.  Both strategies included the invasion of Peleliu, but for different reasons.

The [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] had already been chosen to make the assault. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] traveled to [[Pearl Harbor]] to personally meet both commanders and hear their arguments. MacArthur's strategy was chosen. However, before MacArthur could retake the Philippines, the [[Palau Islands]], specifically Peleliu and [[Angaur]], were to be neutralized and an airfield built to protect MacArthur's right flank.

==Preparations==
===Japanese===
By the summer of 1944, Peleliu Island was occupied by about 11,000 Japanese of the [[14th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|14th Infantry Division]] with Korean and [[Okinawa]]n laborers. Colonel [[Kunio Nakagawa]] — commander of the Division's 2nd Regiment — led the preparations for the island's defense.

After their losses in the [[Solomon Islands campaign|Solomons]], [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|Gilberts, Marshalls]] and [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Marianas]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Army]] assembled a research team to develop new island defense tactics. They chose to abandon the old tactic of stopping the enemy at the beach. The new tactics would only disrupt the landings at the water's edge and depend on an in-depth defense farther inland. Colonel Nakagawa used the rough terrain to his advantage, by constructing a system of heavily fortified bunkers, caves, and underground positions all interlocked into a "honeycomb" system. The old tactic of the [[banzai charge]] was also discontinued as wasteful of men and ineffective. These two tactics would force the Americans into a war of attrition requiring more and more resources.
[[File:Peleliu-defense-194409.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Japanese fortifications.]]

Nakagawa's defenses were based at Peleliu's highest point, Umurbrogol Mountain, a collection of hills and steep ridges located at the center of Peleliu overlooking a large portion of the island, including the crucial airfield. The Umurbrogol contained some 500 limestone caves, inter-connected by tunnels. Many of these were former mine shafts that were turned into defense positions. Engineers added sliding armoured steel doors with multiple openings to serve both artillery and machine guns. Cave entrances were built slanted as a defense against grenade and flamethrower attacks. The caves and bunkers were connected to a vast system throughout central Peleliu, which allowed the Japanese to evacuate or reoccupy positions as needed, and to take advantage of shrinking [[interior lines]].

The Japanese were well armed with [[Type 97 81 mm infantry mortar|{{convert|81|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}]] and [[Type 96 150 mm Infantry Mortar|{{convert|150|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} mortar]]s, and [[Type 98 20 mm AA Machine Cannon|{{convert|20|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} cannons]], and backed by a light tank unit and an anti-aircraft detachment.

The Japanese also used the beach terrain to their advantage. The northern end of the landing beaches faced a {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} coral promontory which overlooked the beaches from a small peninsula, a spot later known to the Marines who assaulted it simply as "The Point". Holes were blasted into the ridge to accommodate a [[Type 1 47 mm Anti-Tank Gun|{{convert|47|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} gun]], and six 20&nbsp;mm cannons. The positions were then sealed shut, leaving just a small firing slit to assault the beaches. Similar positions were crafted along the {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} stretch of landing beaches.

The beaches were also filled with thousands of obstacles for the landing craft, principally mines and a large number of heavy artillery shells buried with the fuses exposed to explode when they were run over. A battalion was placed along the beach to defend against the landing, but they were meant to merely delay the inevitable American advance inland.

===American===
[[File:Battle of Peleliu2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|U.S. Marines in combat.]]

Unlike the Japanese, who drastically altered their tactics for the upcoming battle, the American invasion plan was unchanged from previous amphibious landings, even after suffering 3,000 casualties and two months of delaying tactics against the entrenched Japanese defenders at the [[Battle of Biak]].<ref>Alexander, ''Storm Landings'', p. 110.</ref> On Peleliu, American planners chose to land on the southwest beaches, due to their proximity to the airfield on South Peleliu. The [[1st Marine Regiment (United States)|1st Marine Regiment]]—commanded by Col. [[Chesty Puller|Lewis B. Puller]]—was to land on the northern end of the beaches. The [[5th Marine Regiment (United States)|5th Marine Regiment]]—under Col. [[Harold D. Harris]]—would land in the center, and the [[7th Marine Regiment (United States)|7th Marine Regiment]]—under Col. [[Herman Hanneken|Herman H. Hanneken]]—would land at the southern end.

The division's artillery regiment—the [[11th Marine Regiment|11th Marines]]—would land after the [[infantry]] regiments. The plan was for the 1st and 7th Regiments to push inland, guarding the 5th Regiment's left and right flank, and allowing them to capture the airfield located directly to the center of the landing beaches. The 5th Marines were to push to the eastern shore, cutting the island in half. The 1st Marines would push north into the Umurbrogol, while the 7th Marines would clear the southern end of the island. Only one battalion was left behind in reserve, with the Army's 81st Infantry Division available for support from Angaur, just south of Peleliu.

On 4 September, the Marines shipped off from their station on [[Pavuvu]], just north of [[Guadalcanal]], a {{convert|2100|mi|km|abbr=on}} trip across the Pacific to Peleliu. The Navy's [[Underwater Demolition Team]] went in first to clear the beaches of obstacles, while [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] warships began their pre-invasion bombardment of Peleliu on 12 September.

The [[battleship]]s {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}}, {{USS|Maryland|BB-46|2}}, {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|2}}, {{USS|Tennessee|BB-43|2}} and {{USS|Idaho|BB-42|2}}, [[heavy cruiser]]s {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|2}}, {{USS|Louisville|CA-28|2}}, {{USS|Minneapolis|CA-36|2}} and {{USS|Portland|CA-33|2}}, [[light cruiser]]s {{USS|Columbia|CL-56|2}}, {{USS|Cleveland|CL-55|2}}, {{USS|Denver|CL-58|2}} and {{USS|Honolulu|CL-48|2}}, and three [[aircraft carrier|fleet]] and five [[light aircraft carrier]]s dropped 519 rounds of {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} shells, 1,845 rounds of {{convert|14|in|mm|abbr=on}} shells, 1,793 {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs, and 73,412 {{convert|.50|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]] rounds onto the tiny island, only {{convert|6|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} in size.

The Americans believed the bombardment to be successful, as [[Rear Admiral]] [[Jesse Oldendorf]] claimed that the Navy had run out of targets. In reality, the majority of the Japanese positions were completely unharmed. Even the battalion left to defend the beaches was virtually unscathed. During the assault, the island's defenders used unusual firing discipline to avoid giving away their positions. The bombardment managed only to destroy Japan's aircraft on the island, as well as the buildings surrounding the airfield. The Japanese remained in their fortified positions, ready to attack the troops soon to be landing.

==Battle==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}

===Landing===
[[File:Battle of Peleliu map.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Routes of Allied landings on Peleliu, 15 September 1944.]]

The Marines landed at 08:32 on 15 September; the 1st Marines to the north on "White Beach 1 and 2", and the 5th and 7th Marines to the center and south on "Orange Beach 1, 2, and 3". As the other landing craft approached the beaches, they were caught in a crossfire when the Japanese opened the steel doors guarding their positions and fired artillery. The positions on the coral promontories guarding each flank attacked the Marines with 47&nbsp;mm guns and 20&nbsp;mm autocannons. By 09:30, the Japanese had destroyed 60 [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT]]s and [[DUKW]]s.
[[File:Orange Beach 2 - Peleliu.jpg|thumb|left|200px|5th Marines on Orange Beach]]

The 1st Marines were quickly bogged down by heavy fire from the extreme left flank. Colonel Puller narrowly escaped death when a dud high velocity artillery round struck his LVT. His communications section was destroyed on its way to the beach by a hit from a 47&nbsp;mm round. The 7th Marines to the south faced similar problems with gun emplacements on their flank. Many of their LVT's were knocked out in their approach, leaving their occupants to wade ashore through the coral reef in chest-high or deeper water while being raked by Japanese machine guns; casualties were severe and many who reached the beach alive had lost their rifles and other gear.

The 5th Marines made the most progress on the first day, due to their distance from the heavy gun emplacements guarding the left and right flanks. They pushed toward the airfield, but were met with Nakagawa's first counterattack. His armored tank company raced across the airfield to push the Marines back, but was soon engaged by tanks, howitzers, naval guns and dive bombers. Nakagawa's tanks and escorting infantrymen were quickly destroyed.

At the end of the first day, the Americans held their {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} stretch of landing beaches, but little else. Their biggest push in the south moved {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, but the 1st Marines to the north made very little progress because of the extremely thick resistance. The Marines had suffered 200 dead and 900 wounded. Rupertus, still unaware of his enemy's change of tactics, believed the Japanese would quickly crumble since their perimeter had been broken.

===The airfield/South Peleliu===
[[File:Wounded Marine on Peleliu.jpg|thumb|A wounded Marine receives a drink]]

On the second day, the 5th Marines moved to capture the airfield and push toward the eastern shore. They ran across the airfield under heavy artillery fire from the highlands to the north, suffering heavy casualties in the process. After capturing the airfield, they rapidly advanced to the eastern end of Peleliu, leaving the island's southern defenders to be destroyed by the 7th Marines.

This area was hotly contested by the Japanese, who still occupied numerous pillboxes. Temperatures were around {{convert|115|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, and the Marines soon suffered high casualties from heat exhaustion. Further complicating the situation, the Marines' water was distributed in empty oil drums, and became contaminated with oil.<ref name=Hough_94/> Still, by the eighth day the 5th and 7th Marines had accomplished their objectives, holding the airfield and the southern portion of the island.

American forces put the airfield to use on the third day. [[L-2 Grasshopper]]s from [[VMO-1]] began [[Aerial observer|aerial spotting]] missions for Marine artillery and [[naval gunfire support]]. On 26 September (D+11), Marine [[Vought F4U Corsair|F4U Corsair]]s from [[VMF-114]] landed on the airstrip. The Corsairs began [[dive-bombing]] missions across Peleliu, firing rockets to open cave entrances for the infantrymen, and dropping [[napalm]]; it was only the second time the latter weapon had been used in the Pacific. Napalm proved useful, burning away the vegetation hiding [[spider hole]]s and usually killing their occupants.

===The Point===
[[File:Skull and danger sign on Peleliu.jpg|thumb|Front line warning sign on Peleliu October 1944]]

The [[fortress]] atop The Point continued to cause heavy casualties due to enfilading fire from heavy machine guns and [[Anti-tank warfare|anti-tank]] artillery across the landing beaches. Puller ordered [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] George P. Hunt, commander of K Company, [[3rd Battalion 1st Marines|3rd Battalion, 1st Marines]], to capture the position. He approached The Point short on supplies, having lost most of his machine guns while approaching the beaches. Hunt's second [[platoon]] was pinned down for nearly a day in an [[anti-tank trench]] between [[fortification]]s. The rest of his [[company (military unit)|company]] was endangered when the Japanese cut a hole in their line, surrounding his company and leaving his right flank cut off.

However, a [[rifle platoon]] began knocking out the Japanese gun positions one by one. Using [[smoke grenade]]s for cover, they swept through each hole, destroying the positions with [[rifle grenade]]s and [[Close quarters combat|close-quarters combat]]. After knocking out the six machine gun positions, the Marines faced the 47mm gun cave. A [[lieutenant]] blinded the 47&nbsp;mm gunner with a smoke grenade, allowing [[Corporal]] [[Henry W. Hahn]] to launch a grenade through the cave's aperture. The grenade detonated the 47&nbsp;mm's shells, forcing the cave's occupants out with their bodies lit aflame as well as their ammunition belts exploding around their waists. A fire team was positioned on the flank of the cave where the former occupants were shot down.

K Company had captured The Point, but Nakagawa [[counterattack]]ed. The next 30 hours saw four major counterattacks against a sole company, critically low on [[materiel|supplies]], out of water, and surrounded. The [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]]s soon had to resort to [[hand-to-hand combat]] and [[attrition warfare]] to fend off the Japanese attackers. By the time [[reinforcement]]s arrived, the company had successfully repulsed all Japanese attacks, but had been reduced to 18 men, suffering 157 casualties during the battle for The Point. Hunt and Hahn were both rewarded the [[Navy Cross]] for their actions.

===Ngesebus Island===
The 5th Marines—after having secured the airfield—were sent to capture Ngesebus Island (present day [[Ngedbus]]), just north of Peleliu. Ngesebus was occupied by many Japanese artillery positions, and was the site of an airfield still under construction. The tiny island was connected to Peleliu by a small causeway, but 5th Marines commander Harris opted instead to make a shore-to-shore amphibious landing, predicting the causeway to be an obvious target for the island's defenders.

Harris coordinated a pre-landing bombardment of the island on September 28, carried out by Army {{convert|155|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} guns, naval guns, howitzers from the [[11th Marine Regiment|11th Marines]], strafing runs from VMF-114's Corsairs, and {{convert|75|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} fire from the approaching LVTs. Unlike the Navy's bombardment of Peleliu, Harris' assault on Ngesebus successfully killed most of the Japanese defenders. The Marines still faced opposition in the ridges and caves, but the island fell quickly, with relatively light casualties for the 5th Marines. They had suffered 15 killed and 33 wounded, and inflicted 470 casualties on the Japanese.

===Bloody Nose Ridge===
[[File:Corsair attacks jap bunker on Peleliu.jpg|thumb|A Corsair drops napalm on Japanese positions atop Umurbrogol]]
[[File:Marines wait in their foxholes - Peleliu.jpg|left|thumb|Marines waiting in their [[Defensive fighting position|foxholes]].]]

After capturing The Point, the 1st Marines moved north into the Umurbrogol pocket, named "Bloody Nose Ridge" by the Marines. Puller led his men in numerous assaults, but every one brought on severe casualties by the Japanese. The 1st Marines were trapped within the narrow paths between the ridges, with each ridge fortification supporting the other with deadly crossfire.

The Marines took increasingly high casualties as they slowly advanced through the ridges. The Japanese again showed unusual fire discipline, striking only when they could inflict maximum casualties. As casualties mounted, Japanese [[sniper]]s began to take aim at [[stretcher]] bearers, knowing that if two stretcher bearers were injured or killed, more would have to return to replace them, and the snipers could steadily pick off more and more Marines. In place of their ''banzai'' attacks, the Japanese infiltrated the American lines at night to attack the Marines in their foxholes. The Marines built two-man foxholes, so one could sleep while the other kept watch for infiltrators.

One particularly bloody battle on Bloody Nose came when the [[1st Battalion 1st Marines|1st Battalion, 1st Marines]]—under the command of [[Major]] [[Ray Davis (U.S. Marine)|Raymond Davis]]—attacked Hill 100. Over six days of fighting, the battalion suffered 71% casualties. [[Everett P. Pope|Captain Everett Pope]] and his company penetrated deep into the ridges, leading his remaining 90 men to seize what he thought was Hill 100. It took a day fighting to reach what he thought was the crest of the hill, which was in fact another ridge, occupied by more Japanese defenders.

Trapped at the base of the ridge, Pope set up a small defense perimeter, which was attacked relentlessly by the Japanese throughout the night. The Marines soon ran out of ammunition, and had to fight the attackers with knives and fists, even resorting to throwing coral rock and empty ammunition boxes at the Japanese. Pope and his men managed to hold out until dawn which brought on more deadly fire. When they evacuated the position, only nine men remained. Pope later received the [[Medal of Honor]] for the action.
[[File:Resting on Peleliu Island.jpg|thumb|Two marines {Marine Pfc. Douglas Lightheart (right) cradles his .30 caliber(7.62×63mm) [[M1919 Browning machine gun]] in his lap, while he and Pfc. Gerald Thursby Sr. take a cigarette break}, during mopping up operations on Peleliu on 14 September 1944.]]

The Japanese eventually inflicted 60% casualties on Puller's 1st Marines, who lost 1,749 out of approximately 3,000 men. After six days of fighting in the ridges of Umurbrogol, [[General]] [[Roy Geiger]], commander of the III Amphibious Corps, sent elements of 81st Infantry Division to Peleliu to relieve the regiment. The 321st Regiment Combat Team landed on the western beaches of Peleliu—at the northern end of Umurbrogol mountain—on 23 September. The 321st Regiment, 5th, and then 7th Marines took turns attacking the Umurbrogol, and all suffered similar casualties.

By mid-October, the 5th and 7th Marines both lost around half their men while clawing their way through the ridges. Geiger then decided to evacuate the entire 1st Marine Division, to be replaced by more 81st troops. The 323rd Regimental Combat Team landed on 15 October, and by the third week of October, almost all of the Marines had been evacuated back to Pavuvu.

The Army troops battled the remaining Japanese on Bloody Nose Ridge for another month before securing the island. On 24 November, Nakagawa proclaimed "Our sword is broken and we have run out of spears". He then burnt his regimental colors and performed [[seppuku|ritual suicide]]. He was posthumously promoted to [[lieutenant general]] for his valor displayed on Peleliu. On 27 November, the island was declared secure, ending the 73-day long battle.

A [[Japanese_holdout#1945-1949|Japanese lieutenant]] with his 26 2nd Infantry soldiers and eight 45th Guard Force sailors held out in the caves in Peleliu until April 22, 1947 and surrendered after a Japanese admiral convinced them the war was over.

The 1st Marine Division was severely mauled and it remained out of action until the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]] on 1 April 1945. In total, the 1st Marine Division suffered over 6,500 casualties during their month on Peleliu, over ⅓ of their entire division. The 81st Infantry Division suffered nearly 3,300 casualties during their tenure on the island.

The battle was controversial due to the island's lack of strategic value. The airfield captured on Peleliu was of little use for the attack on the Philippines. The island was never used for a staging operation in subsequent invasions; the [[Ulithi Atoll]], in the [[Caroline Islands]] north of the Palaus, was used as a staging base for the invasion of Okinawa. In addition, few news reports were made on the battle. Due to Rupertus' "3 days" prediction, only six reporters bothered coming ashore. The battle was overshadowed by MacArthur's [[Battle of Leyte|return to the Philippines]] and the Allies' push towards [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]].

The [[Battle of Angaur|battles for Angaur]] and Peleliu showed Americans the pattern of future Japanese island defense which would be seen again at [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] and Okinawa.<ref>Morison, 1958, p. 46.</ref> Naval bombardment prior to amphibious assault at Iwo Jima was only slightly more effective than at Peleliu, but at Okinawa the preliminary shelling was superb.<ref name=Alexander95>Alexander,''Storm Landings'', p. 95.</ref> Frogmen performing underwater demolition at Iwo Jima confused the enemy by sweeping both coasts, but later alerted Japanese defenders to the exact assault beaches at Okinawa.<ref name=Alexander95/> American ground forces at Peleliu gained experience in assaulting heavily fortified positions such as they would find again at Okinawa.<ref>Morison, 1958, p. 47.</ref>

On the recommendation of Admiral [[William F. Halsey, Jr.]], the planned occupation of [[Yap]] Island in the Caroline islands was canceled. Halsey actually recommended that the landings on Peleliu and Angaur be canceled, too, and their Marines and soldiers be thrown into [[Leyte Island]] instead, but was overruled by Nimitz.<ref>{{cite book
