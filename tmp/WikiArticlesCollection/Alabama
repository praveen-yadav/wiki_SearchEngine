'''Alabama''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Alabama.ogg|ˌ|æ|l|ə|ˈ|b|æ|m|ə}}) is a state located in the [[Southern United States|southeastern region]] of the United States. It is bordered by [[Tennessee]] to the north, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the east, Florida and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the south, and [[Mississippi]] to the west. Alabama is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|30th-most extensive]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|23rd-most populous]] of the [[List of U.S. states|50 United States]]. At {{convert|1300|mi|km}}, Alabama has one of the longest navigable inland waterways in the nation.<ref name="navwater">{{cite web|url=http://commerce.alabama.gov/content/media/publications/Transportation/TransportationInAlabama.pdf |title=Transportation in Alabama |publisher=Alabama Development Office |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref>

From the [[American Civil War]] until World War II, Alabama, like many Southern states, suffered economic hardship, in part because of continued dependence on agriculture. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|White]] rural interests dominated the state legislature until the 1960s, while urban interests and African Americans were under-represented.<ref name="pjhwpa">{{cite web|url=http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071017192719/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |title=George Mason University, United States Election Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary.

Following World War II, Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The establishment or expansion of multiple [[United States Armed Forces]] installations added to the state economy and helped bridge the gap between an agricultural and industrial economy during the mid-20th century. The state economy in the 21st century is dependent on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.<ref name="alaindustrial">{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008-2018 |work=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref>

Alabama is unofficially nicknamed the ''[[Northern Flicker|Yellowhammer]] State'', after the [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]]. Alabama is also known as the "[[Dixie|Heart of Dixie]]". The [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] is the [[Longleaf Pine]], and the [[List of U.S. state flowers|state flower]] is the [[Camellia]]. The capital of Alabama is [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].

[[Indigenous peoples]] of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization.

Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in the area of present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the [[Cherokee]], an [[Iroquoian language]] people; and the [[Muskogean]]-speaking [[Alabama (people)|Alabama]] (''Alibamu''), [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], [[Creek people|Creek]], and [[Koasati]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/alabama/ |title= Alabama Indian Tribes |accessdate =September 23, 2006 |date= Updated 2006 |work= Indian Tribal Records |publisher= AccessGenealogy.com |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061012073735/http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/alabama/ |archivedate= October 12, 2006 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl= no}}</ref> While part of the same large language family, the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages.

===European settlement===
[[File:Mississippiterritory.PNG|thumb|left|upright=.75|Map showing the formation of the Mississippi and Alabama territories.]]
With exploration in the 16th century, the Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama. The expedition of [[Hernando de Soto]] passed through [[Mabila]] and other parts of the state in 1540. More than 160 years later, the French founded the first European settlement in the region at [[Old Mobile Site|Old Mobile]] in 1702.<ref name="US50">{{cite web|url= http://www.theus50.com/alabama/ |title= Alabama State History |accessdate=September 23, 2006 |publisher= theUS50.com |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060825052401/http://www.theus50.com/alabama/ |archivedate= August 25, 2006 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl= no}}</ref> The city was moved to the current site of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] in 1711.

After the French lost to the British in the [[Seven Years War]], it became part of British [[West Florida]] from 1763 to 1783. After the United States victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]], the territory was divided between the United States and Spain. The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13, 1813.<ref name=alahisttmln>{{cite web|title=Alabama History Timeline|url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/timeline/al1801.html|publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name="annexed1">{{cite book|last=Thomason|first=Michael|title=Mobile: The New History of Alabama's First City|year=2001|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa|isbn=0-8173-1065-7|pages=61}}</ref>

What is now the counties of [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Baldwin]] and [[Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile]] became part of [[Spanish West Florida]] in 1783, part of the independent [[Republic of West Florida]] in 1810, and was finally added to the [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1812. Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the [[Yazoo lands]] beginning during the British colonial period. It was claimed by the [[Province of Georgia]] from 1767 onwards. Following the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]], it remained a part of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], although heavily disputed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cadle|first=Farris W|title=Georgia Land Surveying History and Law|year=1991|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Ga.|pages=}}</ref><ref name="pickett">{{cite book|last=Pickett|first=Albert James|title=History of Alabama and incidentally of Georgia and Mississippi, from the earliest period|year=1851|publisher=Walker and James|location=Charleston|pages=408–428}}</ref>

With the exception of the immediate area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now the lower one-third Alabama was made part of the [[Mississippi Territory]] when it was organized in 1798.

On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its [[Secession in the United States|secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].  After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the [[Confederate States of America]]. The Confederacy's capital was initially located at [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].  Alabama was heavily [[Alabama in the American Civil War|involved in the American Civil War]].  Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort.

A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, Alabama joined [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]'s battalion in [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky]].  The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coat tails. This led to them being greeted with "Yellowhammer", and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army.<ref>[http://www.archives.state.al.us/emblems/st_bird.html Official Symbols and Emblems of Alabama, State Bird of Alabama, Yellowhammer].

From 1867 to 1874, with most White citizens barred from voting, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African American congressmen: [[Jeremiah Haralson]], [[Benjamin S. Turner]], and [[James T. Rapier]].<ref name="alrecnstrctn">{{cite web |url=http://www.alabamamoments.state.al.us/sec24.html |title=Reconstruction in Alabama: A Quick Summary |work=Alabama Moments in American History |publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref>

Following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], state legislators ratified a [[Constitution of Alabama|new state constitution]] in 1868 that created a public school system for the first time and expanded women's rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation.<ref name="alrecnstrctn"/> Organized resistance groups also tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans. Besides the short-lived original [[Ku Klux Klan]], these included the Pale Faces, [[Knights of the White Camellia]], [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], and the [[White League]].<ref name="alrecnstrctn"/>

Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office. They wrote another constitution in 1875,<ref name="alrecnstrctn"/> and the legislature passed the [[Blaine Amendment]], prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/blaine_7_00.htm |title=A Blaine Amendment Update (July 00) |publisher=Schoolreport.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110716014339/http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/blaine_7_00.htm |archivedate= July 16, 2011 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl= no}}</ref> The same year, legislation was approved that called for [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] schools.<ref name="jimcrowala">{{cite web |url=http://www.classroomhelp.com/till/jimcrowlaws/jimcrowalabama.html |title=Jim Crow Laws in Alabama |work=Emmett Till, It All Began with a Whistle |publisher=Classroomhelp |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref> Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891.<ref name="jimcrowala"/> More [[Jim Crow laws]] were passed at the beginning of the 20th century to enforce segregation in everyday life.

===20th century===
[[File:Birmingham Alabama skyline 1915.jpg|thumb|left|The developing skyline of Birmingham in 1915]]
The new 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]] included electoral laws that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] African Americans, Native Americans, and most poor Whites through voting restrictions, including [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] and literacy requirements.<ref>J. Morgan Kousser.''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974</ref> While the planter class had persuaded poor Whites to support these legislative efforts, the new restrictions resulted in their disfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative [[poll tax]].<ref name="epzzsd"/>

In 1900, Alabama had more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote. By 1903, only 2,980 were qualified to register, although at least 74,000 African-American voters were [[literate]].<ref name="epzzsd"/> By 1941, more White Alabamians than African-American residents had been disfranchised: a total of 600,000 Whites to 520,000 African Americans.<ref name="epzzsd">Glenn Feldman. ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.</ref> Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote, a situation that persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the 1960s to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.

The 1901 constitution reiterated that schools be racially segregated. It also restated that interracial marriage was illegal, although such marriages had been made illegal in 1867. Further racial segregation laws were passed related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.<ref name="jimcrowala"/>

The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes.<ref name="SSpaces">{{cite web|url= http://southernspaces.org/2004/black-belt |title= The Black Belt |accessdate =September 23, 2006 |date= April 19, 2004 |work= Southern Spaces Internet Journal |publisher= Emory University}}</ref> Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the [[Rosenwald Fund]] began funding the construction of what came to be known as [[Rosenwald School]]s. In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The local community and state raised matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas.<ref name="rosenwaldal">{{cite web|title=The Rosenwald School Building Fund and Associated Buildings MPS|work="National Register Information System" |url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/64500011.pdf |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Mount Sinai School Autauga County July 2011 1.jpg|thumb|The former [[Mount Sinai School]] in rural Autauga County, completed in 1919.  It was one of the 387 Rosenwald Schools built in the state.]]

Beginning in 1913, the first 80 [[Rosenwald School]]s were built in Alabama for African-American children. A total of 387 schools, seven teacher's houses, and several vocational buildings had been completed in the state by 1937. Several of the [[The Rosenwald School Building Fund and Associated Buildings Multiple Property Submission|surviving school buildings]] in the state are now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name="rosenwaldal"/>

Continued racial discrimination, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to [[boll weevil]] infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans to seek opportunities in northern cities. They left Alabama in the early 20th century as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to industrial jobs and better futures in northern and midwestern industrial cities. Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see "Historical Populations" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.

At the same time, many rural people, both White and African American, moved to the city of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] to work in new industrial jobs. Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called "The Magic City". By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th-largest city in the United States and had more than 30% of the Alabama's population. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhamwiki.com/w/Birmingham |title=Birmingham |publisher=Bhamwiki |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref> Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict to recognize demographic changes, such as urbanization.

Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the Civil War.<ref name="SSpaces"/>  Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers can be shown by what happened in Mobile. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war effort industries.<ref name="thomason2">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'', pages 213–217. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7</ref> Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.

Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham.

[[File:SelmaHeschelMarch.jpg|thumb|left|The third [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma to Montgomery march]], one of the seminal events of the civil rights movement in Alabama.]]
One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, "A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature."<ref name="pjhwpa"/>

African Americans were presumed partial to Republicans for historical reasons, but they were disfranchised. White Alabamans felt bitter towards the Republican Party in the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction. These factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with White voters had to run as a Democrat regardless of political beliefs.

Although efforts had already started decades earlier, African Americans began to press to end disfranchisement and segregation in the state during the 1950s and 1960s with the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]]. In 1954 the US Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that public schools had to be desegated, but Alabama was slow to comply. The civil rights movement raised national awareness of the issues, leading to the enactment of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] by the U.S. Congress. During the 1960s, under Governor [[George Wallace]], failed attempts were made at the state level to resist federally sanctioned [[desegregation]] efforts.

During the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans achieved enforcement of voting and other civil constitutional rights through the passage of the national [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],<ref name="cra64">{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=Finduslaw.com |accessdate=October 24, 2010 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101021141154/http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |archivedate= October 21, 2010 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl= no}}</ref> and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, cases were filed in Federal courts to force Alabama to redistrict by population both the House and Senate of the state legislature. In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature implemented the Alabama constitution's provision for periodic redistricting based on population. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years.<ref name="pjhwpa"/>

Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over {{convert|90|°F}} throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to [[tropical storm]]s and even [[hurricane]]s. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.

South Alabama reports many [[thunderstorms]]. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60&nbsp;days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent [[lightning]] and large [[hail]]; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks seventh in the number of deaths from lightning and ninth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.<ref>[http://www.lightningsafety.com/nlsi_lls/fatalities_us.html Lightning Fatalities, Injuries and Damages in the United States, 1990–2003].

The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December, along with the spring severe weather season. The northern part of the state—along the Tennessee Valley—is one of the areas in the U.S. most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as [[Dixie Alley]], as distinct from the [[Tornado Alley]] of the Southern Plains.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the southeastern U.S., with average January low temperatures around {{convert|40|°F}} in Mobile and around {{convert|32|°F}} in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]] and the [[1993 Storm of the Century]]. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is {{convert|2|in|mm}} per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

In 1984, under the Davis–Strong Act, the state legislature established the [[Alabama Indian Affairs Commission]].<ref name="aiac">[http://www.aiac.state.al.us/tribes.aspx "Alabama Indian Affairs Commission"], State of Alabama, accessed September 28, 2013</ref> Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black.

The state has [[State recognized tribes in the United States|officially recognized]] nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the American Southeast. These include:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aiac.alabama.gov/ByLaws.aspx |title=AIAC Bylaws |work=Alabama Indian Affairs Commission |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref>

Alabama is located in the middle of the [[Bible Belt]], a region of numerous Protestant Christians. Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the US, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly.<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060502/news_lz1n2thelist.html US Church attendance]</ref> A majority of people in the state identify as Evangelical Protestant. As of 2010, the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], [[The United Methodist Church]], and non-denominational Evangelical Protestant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/01/rcms2010_01_state_name_2010.asp |title=The Association of Religion Data Archives &#124; State membership Report |publisher=www.thearda.com |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref>

In Alabama, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121; this is followed by the [[United Methodist Church]] with 327,734 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents. Many Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the [[Great Awakening]] of the early 19th century, when preachers proselytized across the South. The [[Assemblies of God]] had almost 60,000 members, the [[Churches of Christ]] had nearly 120,000 members.

At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the [[U.S. Constitution]].<ref name="Washington Post">{{Cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A16443-2004Nov27?language=printer |last= Roig-Franzia |first= Manuel |title= Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds |work=The Washington Post |date= November 28, 2004 |accessdate= September 22, 2006}}</ref><ref name="Constitution">{{cite web |url= http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/1901/Constitution1901_toc.htm |title= Constitution of Alabama – 1901 |work= The Alabama Legislative Information System |accessdate= September 22, 2006 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060923081542/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/1901/Constitution1901_toc.htm |archivedate= September 23, 2006 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl= no}}</ref>  There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |title=Alabama Citizens for Constitutional Reform |publisher=Constitutionalreform.org |accessdate=October 24, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100915165938/http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |archivedate= September 15, 2010 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl= no}}</ref>

This movement is based upon the fact that Alabama's constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands. Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length were intentional to codify segregation and racism.

Alabama's government is divided into three equal branches:
The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).

The [[executive branch]] is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the [[Governor of Alabama]]. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], the [[Alabama Secretary of State]], the [[Alabama State Treasurer]], and the [[State Auditor of Alabama]]. The current [[Governor of Alabama|governor]] of the state is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Robert J. Bentley|Robert Bentley]]. The [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alabama|lieutenant governor]] is Republican [[Kay Ivey]].

The [[judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting the [[Alabama Constitution|Constitution]] and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The highest court is the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]. The Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican [[Chuck Malone]]. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party.

The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. The statewide officials, such as the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, and other constitutional offices take office in the following January.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html|title= Alabama's Legislative Process |first= McDowell |last= Lee|year= 2009|publisher= State of Alabama}}</ref>

===Taxes===
Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent personal income tax, depending upon the amount earned and filing status. Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, and can do so even if taking the standard deduction. Taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct federal Social Security and Medicare taxes.

The state's general sales tax rate is 4%.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070520231150/http://www.taxadmin.org/fta/rate/sl_sales.html Comparison of State and Local Retail Sales Taxes], July 2004. Retrieved May 25, 2007.</ref> The collection rate could be substantially higher, depending upon additional city and county sales taxes. For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay a 11% tax on a meal. Sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide. Alabama is also one of the few remaining states that levies a tax on food and medicine. Alabama's income tax on poor working families is among the nation's very highest.<ref name="cbpp.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=1812 |title=Reducing Alabama's Income Tax on Working-Poor Families: Two Options&nbsp;– 4/14/99 |publisher=Cbpp.org |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref> Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line.<ref name="cbpp.org"/> Alabama's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.<ref name="cbpp.org"/>

The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/sl_burden_alabama-2007-04-04.pdf |title=Alabama State Local Tax Burden Compared to U.S. Average (1970–2007) |accessdate=May 30, 2007 |format=PDF |work=Tax Foundation|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070605100516/http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/sl_burden_alabama-2007-04-04.pdf| archivedate= June 5, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  [[Property tax]]es are the lowest in the U.S. The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes.

Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670&nbsp;million.

===Local and county government===
{{Alabama County Labelled Map|align=right|width=300}}
{{see also|List of counties in Alabama}}

Alabama has 67 [[county (United States)|counties]]. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the County Commission, which usually also has executive authority in the county. Because of the restraints placed in the [[Alabama Constitution]], all but seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have little to no [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning.

On November 9, 2011, Jefferson County declared bankruptcy.<ref>[http://jeffconline.jccal.org/home/news/photo/1517060216/ News - View Article]</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/business/jefferson-county-ala-falls-off-the-bankruptcy-cliff.html |work=The New York Times |title=Jefferson County, Ala., Falls Off the Bankruptcy Cliff |date=February 18, 2012 |accessdate= }}</ref>

Alabama is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]]; the government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. However, counties can declare themselves "dry"; the state does not sell alcohol in those areas.

===Politics===
[[File:Robert Bentley.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Robert J. Bentley]], governor since January 17, 2011.]]
[[File:Kay Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Kay Ivey]], lieutenant governor.]]

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In 1874, the political coalition known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African American vote.

After 1890, a coalition of White politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disfranchised African Americans also disfranchised poor Whites, however. By 1941 more Whites than African Americans had been disfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000, although the impact was greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.

From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state. The result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in 1972.

Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]], when racist Whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Democrat [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure. Only with the passage of the Federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name="cra64"/> and [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965 did African Americans regain suffrage, among other civil rights.

In 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican Governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing "profound regret" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}</ref>

In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.<ref name="Southerner">{{cite web |url= http://www.southerner.net/v1n1_99/coverstory1.html |title= The New South Rises, Again |date= Spring 1999 |work= Civil Rights: Law and History |publisher= Southerner.net |accessdate =September 23, 2006}}</ref>

===Elections===
{{main|Elections in Alabama}}

====State elections====
With the disfranchisement of African Americans, the state became part of the "[[Solid South]]", a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] became essentially the only political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100&nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election.

Republicans hold all nine seats on the [[Alabama Supreme Court]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor - Breaking News from The Birmingham News |publisher=Blog.al.com |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> and all ten seats on the state appellate courts. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. This change also began, likely in part, due to the same perception by voters of Democratic party efforts to disenfranchise voters again in 1994. In that general election, the then-incumbent Chief Justice of Alabama, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]]. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.

Republicans hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. Democrats hold one of the three seats on the Alabama Public Service Commission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title= Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html| archivedate= August 2, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy, Press-Register |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher= al.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110513135614/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html| archivedate= May 13, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since Reconstruction, one is [[Kay Ivey]], the current Lieutenant Governor.

====Local elections====
Many local offices (County Commissioners, Boards of Education, Tax Assessors, Tax Collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats. Local elections in most rural counties are generally decided in the Democratic primary and local elections in metropolitan and suburban counties are generally decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&year=2006&f=0&off=5&elect=1 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Democratic Primary Election Results – Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&year=2006&f=0&off=5&elect=2 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Republican Primary Election Results – Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date=February 15, 2007 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref>

Alabama's 67 County Sheriffs are elected in partisan races and Democrats still retain the majority of those posts. The current split is 42 [[Alabama Democratic Party|Democrats]], 24 [[Alabama Republican Party|Republicans]], and one Independent (Choctaw).<ref>{{cite web|title=2011-2015 Alabama Sheriffs|url=http://alabamasheriffs.com/uploads/20130409/85e6648587de92a5a9886ebc22a20009.pdf|publisher=Alabama Sheriffs Association|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}</ref>  However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties and the majority of Republican sheriffs preside over more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alabamasheriffs.com/?PageID=131&IsNav=true |title=Association |publisher=Alabama Sheriffs |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> Two Alabama counties (Montgomery and Calhoun) with a population of over 100,000 have Democratic sheriffs and five [[Counties of Alabama|Alabama counties]] with a population of under 75,000 have Republican sheriffs (Autauga, Coffee, Dale, Coosa, and Blount).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alabamasheriffs.com/Image.aspx?ImageID=11481&Title=2007-2011+Alabama+Sheriffs |title=2007–2011 Alabama Sheriffs |publisher=Alabamasheriffs.com |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> As of 2012, the state of Alabama has one female sheriff, in [[Morgan County, Alabama]], and nine African American sheriffs.<ref>Alabama Sheriffs Association</ref>

====Federal elections====
The state's two [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]] are [[Jeff Sessions|Jefferson B. Sessions III]] and [[Richard Shelby|Richard C. Shelby]], both Republicans. Shelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected in 1992, but switched parties in November 1994.

In the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: ([[Jo Bonner]], [[Mike D. Rogers]], [[Robert Aderholt]], [[Morris J. Brooks]], [[Martha Roby]], and [[Spencer Bachus]]) and one Democrat: [[Terri Sewell]].

===Primary and secondary education===
[[File:Vestavia Hills High School.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vestavia Hills High School]] in the suburbs of Birmingham]]

Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the overview of the [[Alabama State Board of Education]] as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,541 individual schools provide education for 743,364 elementary and secondary students.<ref name="qfacts">{{cite web|url= http://www.alsde.edu/general/quick_facts.pdf |title= Alabama Education Quick Facts 2007 |accessdate =August 11, 2007 |format= PDF| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070726181529/http://www.alsde.edu/general/quick_facts.pdf| archivedate= July 26, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year.<ref name="qfacts"/> In 2007, over 82&nbsp;percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National [[No Child Left Behind]] law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama.

While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data, Alabama's high school graduation rate—75%—is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi).<ref>http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf</ref>  The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.<ref>[http://www.censusscope.org/us/s1/chart_education.html Education Statistics].
