The '''Yangtze River''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|j|æ|ŋ|t|s|i}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɑː|ŋ|t|s|i}}), known in China as the '''Chang&nbsp;Jiang''', is the longest [[rivers of Asia|river]] in [[Asia]] and the [[List of rivers by length|third-longest]] in the world.  It flows for {{Convert|6418|km|mi|0|sp=us}} from the glaciers on the [[Qinghai-Tibet Plateau]] in [[Qinghai]] eastward across [[Southwest China|southwest]], [[South Central China|central]] and [[East China|eastern China]] before emptying into the [[East China Sea]] at [[Shanghai]].  It is also [[List of rivers by discharge|one of the biggest rivers by discharge volume in the world]]. The Yangtze drains one-fifth of the land area of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and its river basin is home to one-third of the [[Demographics of the People's Republic of China|PRC's population]].<ref>[http://www.cjw.gov.cn/index/river/liuyugk-3.asp?link=1]. Accessed 10 Sept 2010. {{zh-icon}}</ref>

Along with the [[Yellow River]], the Yangtze is the most important river in the [[history of China|history]], [[culture of China|culture]] and [[Economy of China|economy]] of China.  The prosperous [[Yangtze River Delta]] generates as much as 20% of the [[Historical GDP of the People's Republic of China|PRC's GDP]]. The Yangtze River flows through a wide array of ecosystems and is itself habitat to several [[Endemism|endemic]] and endangered species including the [[Chinese alligator]] and the [[Yangtze sturgeon]].  For thousands of years, people have used the river for water, irrigation, sanitation, transportation, industry, boundary-marking and war.  The [[Three Gorges Dam]] on the Yangtze River is the [[List of the largest hydroelectric power stations|largest hydro-electric power station in the world]].<ref>

In recent years, the river has suffered from industrial pollution, agricultural run-off, [[siltation]], and loss of wetland and lakes, which exacerbates seasonal flooding.  Some sections of the river are now protected as [[Protected areas of China|nature reserves]].  A stretch of the Yangtze flowing through deep gorges in western [[Yunnan]] is part of the [[Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

Early Chinese literature calls the Yangtze River simply {{lang|zh|'''江'''}} ([[Old Chinese]]:&nbsp;''*kˤroŋ''<ref name=baxjiang>Baxter, Wm. H. & Sagart, Laurent.

The [[Chinese character|character]] is a [[phono-semantic compound]], combining {{lang|zh|氵}} ("water") with the former homophone {{lang|zh|工}} (today ''gōng'', but pronounced ''*kˤoŋ'' in Old Chinese<ref>Baxter & al.

This ''Krong'' was probably a word taken from an [[Austroasiatic]]-speaking people in the area such as the [[Baiyue|Yue]], owing to its similarity to [[Proto-Vietnamese]] ''*krong'', [[Mon language|Mon]] ''krung'', and other cognates, all meaning "river".<ref>Philipsen, Philip.

==Geography==
[[Image:Map of the Yangtze River.gif|thumb|320px||Yangtze watershed]]
[[File:TroyParfitt2.JPG|thumb|right|Cruise on the Yangtze River before sunset]]
The river originates from several tributaries, two of which have claims to be the source.  The PRC  government has recognized{{when|date=July 2013}} the source of the Tuotuo tributary at the base of a glacier lying on the west of [[Geladandong]] Mountain in the [[Tanggula Mountains|Dangla Mountain Range]] on the eastern part of the [[Qinghai-Tibet Plateau]]. However, the geographical source (i.e., longest river distance from the sea) lies in wetlands at {{coord|32|36|14|N|94|30|44|E}} and {{convert|5170|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} above sea level at the head of the Dan Qu tributary.<ref>Wong How Man (2005) [http://www.cers.org.hk/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=27&layout=blog&Itemid=61 New and longer Yangtze source discovered.]</ref> These tributaries join and the river then runs eastward through [[Qinghai]] (Tsinghai), turning southward down a deep valley at the border of [[Sichuan]] (Szechwan) and [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] to reach [[Yunnan]]. In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above {{convert|5000|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} to less than {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on|sp=us}}. The headwaters of the Yangtze are situated at an elevation of about {{convert|4900|m|abbr=on|sp=us}}. In its descent to sea level, the river falls to an altitude of {{convert|305|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} at Yibin, Sichuan, the head of navigation for riverboats, and to {{convert|192|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} at Chongqing (Chungking). Between Chongqing and Yichang (I-ch'ang), at an altitude of {{convert|40|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} and a distance of about {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|sp=us}}, it passes through the spectacular Yangtze Gorges, which are noted for their natural beauty but are dangerous to shipping.

It enters the basin of Sichuan at [[Yibin]]. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through [[Mount Wushan]] bordering [[Chongqing]] and [[Hubei]] to create the famous [[Three Gorges]]. Eastward of the Three Gorges, [[Yichang]] is the first city on the Yangtze Plain.

After entering Hubei, the Yangtze receives more water from thousands of lakes.{{weasel-inline|date=July 2013}} The largest of these lakes is [[Dongting Lake]], which is located on the border of [[Hunan]] and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At [[Wuhan]], it receives its biggest tributary, the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]], bringing water from its northern basin as far as [[Shaanxi]].

At the northern tip of Jiangxi, [[Lake Poyang]], the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through [[Anhui]] and [[Jiangsu]] provinces, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the [[East China Sea]] at [[Shanghai]].

Four of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to [[Hukou County]], where [[Lake Poyang]] meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai. It is home to many thousands of people.{{weasel-inline|date=July 2013}}

The origin of the Yangtze River is dated to about 45 million years ago in the [[Eocene]],<ref>Richardson N.J.,Densmore A.L.,Seward D.  Wipf M. Yong L. (2010).

==Characteristics==

The Yangtze flows into the [[East China Sea]] and was navigable by ocean-going vessels up  a thousand miles from its mouth even before the Three Gorges Dam was built. As of June 2003, this dam spans the river, flooding [[Fengjie]], the first of a number of towns affected by the massive flood control and power generation project. This is the largest comprehensive [[irrigation]] project in the world and has a significant impact on [[Agriculture in China|China's agriculture]]. Its proponents argue that it will free people living along the river from floods that have repeatedly threatened them in the past and will offer them [[electricity]] and [[water transport]]—though at the expense of permanently flooding many existing towns (including numerous ancient cultural relics) and causing large-scale changes in the local [[ecology]].

Opponents of the dam point out that there are three different kinds of floods on the Yangtze River: floods which originate in the upper reaches, floods which originate in the lower reaches, and floods along the entire length of the river. They argue that the Three Gorges dam will actually make flooding in the upper reaches worse and have little or no impact on floods which originate in the lower reaches. Twelve hundred years of low water marks on the river were recorded in the inscriptions and the carvings of carp at [[Baiheliang]], now submerged.

The Yangtze is flanked with metallurgical, power, chemical, auto, building materials and machinery industrial belts and high-tech development zones. It is playing an increasingly crucial role in the river valley's economic growth and has become a vital link for international shipping to the inland provinces. The river is a major transportation artery for China, connecting the interior with the coast.

The river is one of the world's busiest waterways. Traffic includes commercial traffic transporting bulk goods such as coal as well as manufactured goods and passengers. Cargo transportation reached 795 million tons in 2005.<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-01/23/content_4089542.htm Xinhua - English<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-02/04/content_4133140.htm Xinhua - English<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> River cruises several days long, especially through the beautiful and scenic [[Three Gorges]] area, are becoming popular as the tourism industry grows in China.

Flooding along the river has been a major problem. The rainy season in China is May and June in areas south of Yangtze River, and July and August in areas north of it. The huge river system receives water from both southern and northern flanks, which causes its flood season to extend from May to August. Meanwhile, the relatively dense population and rich cities along the river make the floods more deadly and costly. The most recent major floods were the [[1998 Yangtze River Floods]], but more disastrous were the [[1954 Yangtze River Floods]], killing around 30,000 people. Other severe floods included those of 1911, which killed around 100,000,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} 1931 (145,000 dead), and 1935 (142,000 dead).

The Yangtze is very polluted, especially in [[Hubei]] ([[Shashi District]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Early history===
{{see|Baiyue|state of Wu|state of Yue|state of Chu|Southward expansion of the Han Dynasty}}
The Yangtze River is important to the cultural origins of [[northern and southern China|southern China]]. Human activity has been verified in the [[Three Gorges]] area as far back as 27,000 years ago,<ref>''Nature''. "[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v378/n6554/abs/378275a0.html Early ''Homo'' and associated artifacts from Asia]".</ref> and by the 5th millennium&nbsp;BC, the lower Yangtze was a major population center occupied by the [[Hemudu culture|Hemudu]] and [[Majiabang culture]]s, both among the earliest cultivators of [[rice]]. By the 3rd millennium&nbsp;BC, the successor [[Liangzhu culture]] showed evidence of influence from the [[Longshan culture|Longshan peoples]] of the [[North China Plain]].<ref name="Goodenough&Chang">{{cite book

[[File:Streitende-Reiche2.jpg|thumb|A map of the [[Warring States Period|Warring States]] around 350 BC, showing the former coastline of the Yangtze delta.]]
In the lower Yangtze, two [[Baiyue|Yue]] tribes, the ''[[Gouwu]]'' in southern [[Jiangsu]] and the ''[[Yuyue]]'' in northern [[Zhejiang]], display increasing Chinese influence from the 9th century&nbsp;BC. Traditional accounts<ref>For example, in [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''.</ref> credit these changes to northern refugees ([[Wu Taibo|Taibo]] and [[Zhongyong of Wu|Zhongyong]] in Wu and [[Wuyi of Yue|Wuyi]] in Yue) who assumed power over the local tribes. As the Chinese kingdoms of [[state of Wu|Wu]] and [[state of Yue|Yue]], they were famed as fishers, shipwrights, and sword-smiths. Adopting [[Chinese characters]], political institutions, and military technology, they were among the most powerful [[states (ancient China)|states]] during the later [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]].

In the middle Yangtze, the [[state of Jing]] seems to have gone the other direction: archaeological excavation has shown it beginning as a Chinese civilization but adopting greater and greater native influence over time as it expanded south and east from its original base in [[Henan]]. In the process, it changed its name to [[state of Chu|Chu]].

Whether native or nativizing, the Yangtze states held their own against the northern Chinese homeland: some lists credit them with three of the [[Spring and Autumn Period]]'s [[Five Hegemons]] and one of the [[Warring States]]' [[Four Lords of the Warring States|Four Lords]]. They fell in against themselves, however. Chu's growing power led its rival [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] to support Wu as a counter. Wu successfully sacked Chu's capital [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]] in 506&nbsp;BC, but Chu subsequently supported Yue in its attacks against Wu's southern flank. In 473&nbsp;BC, [[kings of Yue|King]] [[Goujian of Yue|Goujian]] fully annexed Wu and moved his court to its [[Wu (city)|eponymous capital]] at modern Suzhou. In 333&nbsp;BC, Chu finally united the lower Yangtze by annexing Yue, whose royal family was said to have fled south and established the [[Minyue]] kingdom in [[Fujian]]. [[state of Qin|Qin]] was able to unite China by first subduing [[state of Ba|Ba]] and [[state of Shu|Shu]] on the upper Yangtze in modern [[Sichuan]], giving them a strong base to attack Chu's settlements along the river.

[[Shi Huangdi]] regularized policies across his empire, including in the annexed Yangtze states. He then used its connections to the [[Yunmeng Marsh]] and the [[Xiang River]] to expand China into [[Hunan]] and [[Guangdong]], setting up military commanderies along the main lines of communication. At the [[collapse of the Qin Dynasty]], these southern commanderies became the independent [[Nanyue Empire]] under [[Zhao Tuo]] while Chu and Han [[Chu-Han Contention|vied with each other]] for control of the north.

From the [[Han Dynasty]], the region of the Yangtze River became more and more important to China's economy. The establishment of irrigation systems (the most famous one is [[Dujiangyan Irrigation System|Dujiangyan]], northwest of Chengdu, built during the [[Warring States]] period) made agriculture very stable and productive. By the Song dynasty, the area along the Yangtze had become among the wealthiest and most developed parts of the country, especially in the lower reaches of the river. Early in the Qing dynasty, the region called [[Jiangnan]] (that includes the southern part of [[Jiangsu]], the northern part of [[Zhejiang]], and the southeastern part of [[Anhui]]) provided 1/3–1/2 of the nation's revenues.

The Yangtze has long been the backbone of China's inland water transportation system, which remained particularly important for almost two thousand years, until the construction of the national railway network during the 20th century. The [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the [[Jiangnan]] region south of the river ([[Wuxi]], [[Suzhou]], [[Hangzhou]]) and with northern China (all the way to [[Beijing]]). The less well known ancient [[Lingqu Canal]], connecting the upper [[Xiang River]] with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the [[Pearl River Delta]].<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5339/ Lingqu Canal (Xiang'an County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Qin Dynasty)] (Nomination for the UNESCO Heritage List)</ref>

Historically, the Yangtze became the political boundary between north China and south China several times (see [[History of China]]) because of the difficulty of crossing the river. This occurred notably during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], and the [[Southern Song]]. Many battles took place along the river, the most famous being the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] in 208 AD during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.

Politically, [[Nanjing]] was the capital of China several times, although most of the time its territory only covered the southeastern part of China, such as the [[Kingdom of Wu|Wu kingdom]] in the Three Kingdoms period, the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]], and during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] and [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] periods. Only the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] occupied most parts of China from their capital at [[Nanjing]], though it later moved the capital to [[Beijing]]. The [[Republic of China|ROC]] capital was located in [[Nanjing]] in the periods 1911–12, 1927–37, and 1945–49.

===Age of Steam===
{{main|Steamboats on the Yangtze River|China Station}}
The first merchant steamer in China, the ''Jardine'', was built to order for the firm of [[Jardine Matheson Holdings|Jardine Matheson]] in 1835. She was a small vessel intended for use as a mail and passenger carrier between [[Lintin Island]], [[Macao]] and [[Whampoa Dock|Whampoa]]. However, after several trips, the Chinese authorities, for reasons best known to themselves, prohibited her entrance into the river. [[Lord Palmerston]], the British Foreign Secretary who personified [[gunboat diplomacy]], decided to wage war on China mainly on the "suggestions" of Jardine Matheson{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. In mid-1840, a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast, and with the first cannon fire aimed at a British ship, the ''Royal Saxon'', the British started the [[First Opium War]]. The Imperial Government, forced to surrender, gave in to the demands of the British. British military superiority was clearly evident during the armed conflict. British warships, constructed using such innovations as steam power combined with sail and the use of iron in shipbuilding, wreaked havoc on coastal towns; such ships (like the ''[[Nemesis (1839)|Nemesis]]'') were not only virtually indestructible but also highly mobile and able to support a gun platform with very heavy guns. In addition, the British troops were armed with modern muskets and cannons, unlike the Qing forces. After the British took [[Guangzhou|Canton]], they sailed up the Yangtze and took the tax barges, a devastating blow to the Empire as it slashed the revenue of the imperial court in Beijing to just a small fraction of what it had been.

In 1842, the Qing authorities sued for peace, which concluded with the [[Treaty of Nanjing]] signed on a gunboat in the river, negotiated in August of that year and ratified in 1843. In the treaty, China was forced to pay an indemnity to Britain, open five ports to Britain, and cede [[Hong Kong]] to [[Queen Victoria]]. In the supplementary Treaty of the Bogue, the Qing empire also recognized Britain as an equal to China and gave British subjects extraterritorial privileges in treaty ports.

===U.S. and French conflicts===

The US, at the same time, wanting to protect its interests and expand trade, ventured the ''[[USS Wachusett (1861)|USS Wachusett]]'' six-hundred miles up the river to [[Hankou District|Hankow]] in about 1860, while the ''[[USS Ashuelot (1865)|USS Ashuelot]]'', a sidewheeler, made her way up the river to [[Ichang]] in 1874. The first ''[[USS Monocacy (1864)|USS Monocacy]]'', a sidewheel gunboat, began charting the Yangtze River in 1871. The first ''[[USS Palos (1865)|USS Palos]]'', an armed tug, was on [[Asiatic Squadron|Asiatic Station]] into 1891, cruising the Chinese and Japanese coasts, visiting the open treaty ports and making occasional voyages up the Yangtze River. From June to September 1891, anti-foreign riots up the Yangtze forced the warship to make an extended voyage as far as [[Hankow]], 600 miles upriver. Stopping at each open treaty port, the gunboat cooperated with naval vessels of other nations and repairing damage. She then operated along the north and central China coast and on the lower Yangtze until June 1892. The cessation of bloodshed with the [[Taiping Rebellion]], [[Europeans]] put more steamers on the river. The [[France|French]], not to sit idle and get rice crumbs, engaged the Chinese in war over the rule of [[Vietnam]]. The [[Sino-French War]]s of the 1880s emerged with the [[Battle of Shipu]] having French cruisers in the lower Yangtze.
[[Image:USSLuzonPG-7.jpg|left|thumb|[[USS Luzon]]]]
[[The China Navigation Company]] was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in [[London]], initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo. Chinese coastal trade started shortly after and in 1883 a regular service to [[Australia]] was initiated. Most of the company's ships were seized by [[Japan]] in 1941 and services did not resume until 1946. [[Robert Dollar]] was a later shipping magnate, who became enormously influential moving Californian and Canadian lumber to the Chinese and Japanese market.

Yichang, or [[Ichang]], {{convert|1600|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} from the sea, is the head of navigation for river steamers; oceangoing vessels may navigate the river to [[Hankow]], a distance of almost 1,000&nbsp;km (almost 600&nbsp;mi) from the sea. For about {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} inland from its mouth, the river is virtually at sea level.

The Chinese Government, too, had steamers. It had its own naval fleet, the [[Nanyang Fleet]], which fell prey to the French fleet. The Chinese would rebuild its fleet,
only to be ravaged by another war with [[First Sino-Japanese War|Japan (1895)]], [[Xinhai Revolution|Revolution (1911)]] and ongoing inefficiency and corruption. Chinese companies ran their own steamers, but were second tier to European operations at the time.

===Navigation on the upper river===

Steamers came late to the upper river. The three gorges and the strong current hindered plans. Achibald Little attempted a voyage with the Lee-Chuan, and the Kuling, delays and weak engines
meant that he only succeeded in the first vessel in 1898. Little soon built the first truly successful boat, the Pioneer, about 1899 &mdash; she plied the river for two more decades and was even the flagship{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} for the [[UK|British]] [[Royal Navy]] on the [[China Station]]. There were a few commercial steamers on the upper river by the start of the 20th century and the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. The commercial firms of [[Jardine Matheson]], [[Butterfield and Swire]] and [[Standard Oil]] had their own steamers on the river. Until 1881, the [[India]] and China coastal and river services were operated by several companies. In that year, however, these were merged into the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company Ltd, a public company under the management of Jardine's. The Jardine company pushed inland up the Yangtsze River on which a specially designed fleet was built to meet all requirements of the river trade. For many years, this fleet gave unequalled service.
Jardine's established an enviable reputation for the efficient handling of shipping. As a result, the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] invited the firm to attend to the Agency of their Shire Line which operated in the [[Far East]]. Standard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An and Mei Hsia, which were all destroyed on December 12, 1937 when Japanese warplanes bombed and sank the U.S.S. Panay. One of the Standard Oil captains who survived this attack had served on the Upper River for 14 years.<ref>Mender, P., Thirty Years A Mariner in the Far East 1907-1937, The Memoirs of Peter Mender, A Standard Oil Ship Captain on China's Yangtze River, p.53, ISBN 978-1-60910-498-6</ref>

===Navy ships===
{{see also|Yangtze Incident}}
With the [[Treaty Ports]], the [[Great power|European powers]] and Japan were allowed to float navy ships into China's internal waters. The British, Americans and French did this. A full international fleet featured on Chinese waters: [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[German Empire|German]] navy ships came to Shanghai and the treaty ports. The Japanese engaged in open war with the Chinese twice, and Russians twice, over conquest of the Chinese [[Qing Empire]]—in the [[First Sino-Japanese War|First]] and [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] 1895, and 1905; and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904. Incidentally, both the [[French Navy|French]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] navies were heavily involved in running [[opium]] and [[narcotics]] to Shanghai, where it was refined into [[morphine]]. It was then transhipped by liner back to [[Marseille]] and [[France]] (i.e. [[French Connection]]) for processing in [[German Empire|Germany]] and eventual sale in the U.S. or [[Europe]].
[[Image:Japanese cruiser Izumo in Shanghai.jpg|right|thumb|[[Japanese cruiser Izumo|JN Izumo]] in Shanghai, 1937; she sank riverboats in 1941]]
In 1909 the gunboat ''[[USS Samar (PG-41)|USS Samar]]'' changed station to Shanghai, where she regularly patrolled the lower Yangtze River up to [[Nanking]] and Wuhu. Following an anti-foreign riots in [[Changsha]] in April 1910, which destroyed a number of missions and merchant warehouses, Samar sailed up the Yangtze River to [[Hankow]] and then Changsa to show the flag and help restore order. The gunboat was also administratively assigned to the [[Asiatic Fleet]] that year, which had been reestablished by the Navy to better protect, in the words of the Bureau of Navigation, "American interests in the Orient." After returning to Shanghai in August, she sailed up river again the following summer, passing Wuhu in June but then running aground off Kichau on July 1, 1911.

After staying stuck in the mud for two weeks, Samar broke free and sailed back down river to coal ship. Returning upriver, the gunboat reached Hankow in August and [[Ichang]] in September where she wintered over owing to both the dry season and the outbreak of rebellion at [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] in October 1911. Tensions eased and the gunboat turned downriver in July 1912, arriving at Shanghai in October. Samar patrolled the lower Yangtze after fighting broke out in the summer 1913, a precursor to a decade of conflict between provincial [[warlord]]s in China. In 1919, she was placed on the disposal list at Shanghai following a collision with a Yangtze River steamer that damaged her bow.

The [[Spain|Spanish]] boats were replaced in the 1920s by the ''[[USS Luzon (PG-47)|Luzon]]'' and ''[[USS Mindanao (PR-8)|Mindanao]]'' were the largest, ''[[USS Oahu (PR-6)|USS Oahu]]'' and ''[[USS Panay (PR-5)|Panay]]'' next in size, and ''[[USS Guam (PG-43)|Guam]]'' and ''[[USS Tutuila (PG-44)|Tutuila]]'' the smallest. China in the first fifty years of the 20th century, was in low-grade chaos. Warlords, revolutions, natural disasters, civil war and invasions contributed. Yangtze boats were involved in the [[Nanking Incident]] in 1927 when the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]]s and [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalists]] broke into open war. The [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|massacre of the Communists]] in Shanghai in 1927 furthered the unrest, [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] with tanks were landed. River steamers were popular targets for both Nationalists and Communists, and peasants who would take periodic pot-shots at vessels. During the course of service the second ''[[USS Palos (PG-16)|USS Palos]]'' protected American interests in China down the entire length of the Yangtze, at times convoying U.S. and foreign vessels on the river, evacuating American citizens during periods of disturbance and in general giving credible presence to U.S. consulates and residences in various Chinese cities. In the period of great unrest in central China in the 1920s, Palos was especially busy patrolling the upper Yangtze against bands of warlord soldiers and outlaws. The warship engaged in continuous patrol operations between Ichang and [[Chongqing|Chungking]] throughout 1923, supplying armed guards to merchant ships, and protecting Americans at Chungking while that city was under siege by a warlord army.

The British [[Royal Navy]] had a series of [[Insect class gunboat]]s which patrolled between Chungking and [[Shanghai]]. Cruisers and destroyers and Fly class{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} vessels also patrolled. The most infamous incident was when [[USS Panay (PR-5)|USS Panay]] and [[HMS Bee (1915)|HMS Bee]] in 1937, were dive-bombed by Japanese aeroplanes during the notorious [[Nanking Massacre]]. The Westerners were forced to leave the Yangtze River with the Japanese takeover in 1941. The former steamers were either sabotaged or pressed into Japanese or Chinese service. Probably the most curious incident involved [[HMS Amethyst (F116)|HMS Amethyst]] in 1949 during the [[Chinese Civil War]] between [[Kuomintang]] and [[People's Liberation Army]] forces; and led to the award of the [[Dickin Medal]] to the ship's cat [[Simon (cat)|Simon]].

===Degradation of the river===
{{see also|Water resources in China#Water quality}}
[[Image:Yangtze-Ships.JPG|right|thumb|Barges on the river.]]
Beginning in the 1950s dams and thousands of kilometres of dykes were built for flood control, land reclamation, irrigation and for the control of diseases vectors such as [[blood fluke]]s that caused [[Schistosomiasis]]. More than a hundred lakes were thus cut off from the main river.<ref name="WWF UK"/> There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ma|first=Jun|title=China's Water Crisis|publisher=An International Rivers Network Book|pages=55–56|year=2004}}</ref> Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, [[Baidang Lake]] shrunk from {{convert|100|km2|sp=us}} in the 1950s to {{convert|40|km2|sp=us}} in 2005. [[Zhangdu Lake]] dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as [[Poyang Lake]] and [[Dongting Lake]], remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of [[carp]] who thrived in [[Eutrophication|eutrophic]] water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage.<ref name="WWF UK"/><ref name="Lakes reunited">{{cite web|last=[[China Daily]]|title=Isolated Yangtze lakes reunited with mother river|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200507/12/eng20050712_195638.html|accessdate=October 25, 2011|date=July 12, 2005}}</ref> In September 2012, the Yangzte river near Chongqing turned red from pollution.<ref name="Yangtze River Turns Red and Turns Up a Mystery">{{cite web|last=[[ABC News]]|title=Yangtze River Turns Red and Turns Up a Mystery|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/09/yangtze-river-turns-red-and-turns-up-a-mystery/

Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the [[Baiji Dolphin]], [[finless porpoise]] and the [[Yangtze Alligator]]. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin went extinct; the world lost an entire genus.<ref>Ellen Wohl. A World of Rivers, pg 287.</ref>

===Reconnecting lakes===
In 2002 a pilot program was initiated to reconnect lakes to the Yangtze with the objective to increase biodiversity and to alleviate flooding. The first lakes to be reconnected in 2004 were [[Zhangdu Lake]], [[Honghu Lake]], and [[Tian'e-Zhou]] in [[Hubei]] province on the middle Yangtze. In 2005 Baidang Lake in [[Anhui]] Province was also reconnected.<ref name="Lakes reunited"/>

Reconnecting the lakes improved water quality and fish were able to migrate from the river into the lake, replenishing their numbers and genetic stock. The trial also showed that reconnecting the lake reduced flooding. The new approach also benefitted the farmers economically. Pond farmers switched to natural fish feed, which helped them breed better quality fish that can be sold for more, increasing their income by 30%. Based on the successful pilot project, other provincial governments emulated the experience and also reestablished connections to lakes that had previously been cut off from the river. In 2005 a Yangtze Forum has been established bringing together 13 riparian provincial governments to manage the river from source to sea.<ref>{{cite web|last=WWF China|title=The Yangtze Forum|url=http://www.wwfchina.org/english/downloads/Yangtze%20Forum.pdf|accessdate=October 25, 2011}}</ref> In 2006 China’s Ministry of Agriculture made it a national policy to reconnect the Yangtze River with its lakes. As of 2010, provincial governments in five provinces and Shanghai set up a network of 40 effective protected areas, covering {{convert|16500|km2|abbr=on|sp=us}}. As a result, populations of 47 threatened species increased, including the critically endangered Yangtze alligator. In the Shanghai area, reestablished wetlands now protect drinking water sources for the city. It is envisaged to extend the network throughout the entire Yangtze to eventually cover 102 areas and {{convert|185000|km2|abbr=on|sp=us}}. The mayor of [[Wuhan]] announced that six huge, stagnating urban lakes including the [[East Lake (Wuhan)]] would be reconnected at the cost of US$ 2.3 billion creating China’s largest urban wetland landscape.<ref name="WWF UK">WWF UK Case Study 2011 / HSBC:Safeguarding the Yangtze.

==Crossings==
{{Main|Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|Yangtze River Power Line Crossings}}

Until 1957, there were no bridges across the Yangtze River from Yibin to Shanghai.  For millennia, travelers crossed the river by ferry.  On occasions, the crossing may have been dangerous, as evidenced by the ''[[Zhong’anlun Monument|Zhong’anlun]]'' disaster (October 15, 1945).

The river stood as a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China.  In the first half of the 20th century, rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark, respectively, at [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]] and [[Pukou]], and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train from [[Wuchang Railway Station|Wuchang]] or [[Nanjing West Railway Station|Nanjing West]].

After the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Soviet engineers assisted in the design and construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], a dual-use [[list of road-rail bridges|road-rail bridge]], built from 1955 to 1957.  It was the first bridge across the Yangtze River.  The second bridge across the river was built a single-track railway bridge built upstream in Chongqing in 1959.  The [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]], also a road-rail bridge, was the first bridge to cross the lower reaches of the Yangtze, in [[Nanjing]].  It was built after the [[Sino-Soviet Split]] and did not receive foreign assistance.  Road-rail bridges were then built in [[Zhicheng]] (1971) and Chongqing (1980).

Bridge-building slowed in the 1980s before resuming in the 1990s and accelerating in the first decade of the 21st century.  The [[Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge]] was built in 1992 as part of the [[Jingjiu railway|Beijing-Jiujiang Railway]].  A [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|second bridge in Wuhan]] was completed in 1995.  By 2005, there were a total of 56 bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai.  These include some of the longest [[suspension bridge|suspension]] and [[cable-stayed bridge]]s in the world on the Yangtze Delta: [[Jiangyin Suspension Bridge]] (1,385 m, opened in 1999), [[Runyang Bridge]] (1,490 m, opened 2005), [[Sutong Bridge]] (1,088 m, opened 2008).  The rapid pace of bridge construction has continued.  The city of Wuhan now has six bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze.

A number of [[Yangtze River Power Line Crossings|power line crossings]] have also been built across the river.

==Wildlife==
Due to commercial use of the river, tourism, and pollution, the Yangtze is home to at least four seriously threatened species of large animals: The [[Chinese alligator]], the [[finless porpoise]], the [[Chinese paddlefish]], and the [[Yangtze River dolphin]] or ''baiji''. This is the only other place besides the United States that is native to an alligator and paddlefish species. In 2010, the Yangtze population of finless porpoise was 1000 individuals. In December 2006, the Yangtze River dolphin was declared [[functional extinction|functionally extinct]] after an extensive search of the river revealed no signs of the dolphin's inhabitance.<ref>{{cite news |  title = The Chinese river dolphin was functionally extinct | url = http://www.baiji.org/expeditions/1.html | publisher = baiji.org | date = 2006-12-13 | accessdate = 2006-12-13}}</ref> In 2007, a large, white animal was sighted and photographed in the lower Yangtze and was tentatively presumed to be a ''baiji''.<ref>[http://sciencemode.com/2007/09/02/river-dolphin-thought-to-be-extinct-spotted-again-in-china/ ScienceMode » River Dolphin Thought to be Extinct Spotted Again in China]</ref> However, as there have been no confirmed sightings since 2004, the ''baiji'' is presumed to be functionally extinct at this time.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6935343.stm Rare river dolphin 'now extinct']. BBC News.</ref> "''Baijis'' were the last surviving species of a large lineage dating back seventy million years and one of only six species of freshwater dolphins". It has been argued that the extinction of the Yangtze River dolphin was a result of the completion of the [[Three Gorges Dam]], a project that has affected many species of animals and plant life found only in the gorges area.<ref>Ellen Wohl, [A World of Rivers: Environmental Changes on Ten of the World's Great Rivers], p.287.</ref>
