'''Customer relationship management''' ('''CRM''') is a model for managing a company’s interactions with current and future [[customers]]. It involves using technology to organize, automate, and synchronize [[sales]], [[marketing]], [[customer service]], and [[technical support]].<ref>[[Robert Shaw (Marketing)|Shaw, Robert]], Computer Aided Marketing & Selling (1991) Butterworth Heinemann ISBN 978-0-7506-1707-9</ref>

==Types/variations==

===Marketing===
CRM systems for marketing track and measure campaigns over multiple channels, such as email, search, social media, telephone and direct mail. These systems track clicks, responses, leads and deals.

===Customer service and support===
CRM systems can be used to create, assign and manage requests made by customers, such as [[call center]] software which helps direct customers to agents.<ref name=sap1>SAP Insider (15 November 2007) [http://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/scn/go/portal/prtroot/docs/library/uuid/e044e180-8375-2a10-a2b2-b5709ea68ccb Still Struggling to Reduce Call Center Costs Without Losing Customers?]</ref> CRM software can also be used to identify and reward loyal customers over a period of time.

===Appointments===
CRM systems can automatically suggest suitable appointment times to customers via e-mail or the web. These can then be synchronized with the representative or agent's calendar.{{citation needed|date= April 2012}}

===Small business===
For [[small business]]es a CRM system may simply consist of a contact manager system which integrates emails, documents, jobs, faxes, and scheduling for individual accounts.{{citation needed|date= April 2012}}
CRM systems available for specific markets (legal, finance) frequently focus on event management and relationship tracking as opposed to financial return on investment (ROI).

===Social media===
CRM often makes use of social media to build up customer relationships. Some CRM systems integrate [[social media]] sites like [[Twitter]], [[LinkedIn]] and [[Facebook]] to track and communicate with customers sharing their opinions and experiences with a company, products and services.<ref name=dest2>DestinationCRM.com (2009) [http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Editorial/Magazine-Features/Who-Owns-the-Social-Customer-54028.aspx Who Owns the Social Customer?]</ref>
[[Enterprise Feedback Management]] software platforms such as [[Confirmit]], [[Medallia]], and [[Net Promoter|Satmetrix]] combine internal survey data with trends identified through social media to allow businesses to make more accurate decisions on which products to supply.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/feature/Seeking-treasure-from-social-media-tracking-Follow-the-customer |title=Seeking treasure from social media tracking? Follow the customer |publisher=SearchBusinessAnalytics |date=2013-04-23 |accessdate=2013-10-01 | first=Aaron | last=Lester}}</ref>

===Non-profit and membership-based===
Systems for non-profit and membership-based organizations help track constituents, fund-raising, demographics, membership levels, membership directories, volunteering and communication with individuals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Customer-centric relationship management (CCRM)===
CCRM is a style of [[customer relationship management]] that focuses on customer preferences, instead of customer leverage. 
This is a nascent sub-discipline of traditional customer relationship management, to take advantage of changes in communications technology.

A CRM system becoming more “customer-centric” means being able to manage critical relationships more effectively and being positioned to offer new and expanded services. <ref>http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture_Homeless_prenatal_PRINT_High.pdf</ref>

Customer centric organizations help customers make better decisions and drive profitability. CCRM adds value by engaging customers in individual, interactive relationships.<ref>[http://www.gtnexus.com/blog/cloud-technology-platform/its-all-about-the-customer-stupid-the-importance-of-selecting-customer-centric-partners/ It’s all about the Customer, Stupid – The Importance of Customer Centric Partners]</ref> 

Customer-centricity differs from ''client-centricity'' in that the latter refers almost exclusively to business-to-business models rather than customer-facing firms.

====Features of CCRM====
Customer-centric relationship management is used in marketing, customer service and sales, including:
* tailored marketing
* one-to-one customer service
* retaining customers
* building brand loyalty
* providing information customers actually want

==Adoption issues==

In 2003, a Gartner report estimated that more than $2 billion had been spent on software that was not being used. According to ''KEN Insights'', less than 40 percent of 1,275 participating companies had end-user adoption rates above 90 percent.<ref name=dickie>Jim Dickie, ''CSO Insights'' (2006) [http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Columns-Departments/Reality-Check/Demystifying-CRM-Adoption-Rates-42496.aspx Demystifying CRM Adoption Rates]</ref> Many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial or fragmented basis.<ref>Joachim, David. "CRM tools improve access, usability." (cover story). ''B to B'' 87, no. 3 (11 March 2002): 1</ref>
{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}
In a 2007 survey from the UK, four-fifths of senior executives reported that their biggest challenge is getting their staff to use the systems they had installed. 43 percent of respondents said they use less than half the functionality of their existing system.<ref name=sims>David Sims, TMC.net (2007) [http://blog.tmcnet.com/telecom-crm/2007/11/30/crm-adoption-biggest-problem-in-83-percent-of-cases-wigan-gets-crm-tre.asp CRM Adoption ‘Biggest Problem’ in 83 Percent of Cases]</ref>{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}. Recently, it is found in a study that market research regarding consumers preference may increase the adoption of CRM among the developing countries' consumers. <ref name=Hasan>Hasan, M. R., Rahman, M., And Khan, M. M. (2013). Rural Consumers’ Adoption of CRM in a Developing Country Context. International Journal of Business and Management Invention (IJBMI), 2(9), 121-131.

==Market leaders==
The CRM market grew by 12.5 percent in 2008, from revenue of $8.13 billion in 2007 to $9.15 billion in 2008.<ref>DestinationCRM.com (2009) [http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/CRM-News/Daily-News/CRM-Market-Grows-for-Fifth-Straight-Year-55275.aspx CRM Market Grows for Fifth Straight Year]</ref> The following table lists the top vendors in 2006–2008 (figures in millions of US dollars) published in [[Gartner]] studies.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=715308|title=Gartner Says Worldwide Customer Relationship Management Market Grew 23 Percent in 2007|accessdate=2008-08-15|date=12 September 2008 |publisher=Gartner, Inc }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1074615|title=Gartner Says Worldwide CRM Market Grew 12.5 Percent in 2008|accessdate=2009-10-27|date=15 June 2009 |publisher=Gartner, Inc }}</ref>

==Trends==
Many CRM vendors offer subscription-based web tools ([[cloud computing]]) and [[software as a service]] (SaaS). Some CRM systems are equipped with mobile capabilities, making information accessible to remote sales staff.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} [[Salesforce.com]] was the first company to provide enterprise applications through a web browser, and has maintained its leadership position.<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/193463/put_cloud_crm_to_work.html|title=Put Cloud CRM to Work] ''PC World'': April, 2010</ref> Traditional providers have recently moved into the cloud-based market via acquisitions of smaller providers: [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] purchased [[RightNow]] in October 2011<ref>[http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/24/oracle-buys-cloud-based-customer-service-company-rightnow-for-1-5-billion/|title=Oracle Buys Cloud-based Customer Service Company RightNow For $1.5 Billion] ''Techcrunch'': 24 October 2011</ref> and [[SAP AG|SAP]] acquired [[SuccessFactors]] in December 2011.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-07/sap-challenges-oracle-with-3-4-billion-successfactors-purchase.html|title=SAP Challenges Oracle With $3.4 Billion SuccessFactors Purchase] ''Bloomberg Businessweek'': 7 December 2011</ref>

The era of the "social customer"<ref>{{cite book | year = 2009 | last = Greenberg | first = Paul | title = CRM at the Speed of Light | publisher = McGraw Hill | edition = 4th | page = 7}}</ref> refers to the use of social media ([[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[LinkedIn]],  [[Google Plus]], [[Pinterest]], [[Instagram]], [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]], customer reviews in [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc.) by customers. CR philosophy and strategy has shifted to encompass social networks and user communities.

Sales forces also play an important role in CRM, as maximizing [[Sales Effectiveness|sales effectiveness]] and increasing sales [[productivity]] is a driving force behind the adoption of CRM. Empowering  [[Sales management|sales managers]] was listed as one of the top 5 CRM trends in 2013.<ref>{{cite web| title= Top 5 CRM Trends for 2013 | url=http://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/crm/top-5-crm-trends-for-2013.html| publisher=Enterprise Apps Today | accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref>

Another related development is [[vendor relationship management]] (VRM), which provide tools and services that allow customers to manage their individual relationship with vendors. VRM development has grown out of efforts by ProjectVRM at Harvard's [[Berkman Center for Internet & Society]] and [[Identity Commons]]' Internet Identity Workshops, as well as by a growing number of startups and established companies. VRM was the subject of a cover story in the May 2010 issue of ''CRM'' Magazine.<ref>[http://www.destinationcrm.com/Issue/1776-May-2010.htm Destinationcrm.com] ''CRM Magazine'': May, 2010</ref>

In 2001, Doug Laney developed the concept and coined the term 'Extended Relationship Management' (XRM).<ref>[http://blogs.gartner.com/doug-laney/files/2012/02/ad1074-The-Great-Enterprise-Balancing-Act-Extended-Relationship-Management-XRM.pdf] ''The Great Enterprise Balancing Act: Extended Relationship Management (XRM)'', Doug Laney, META Group publication, 10 December 2001</ref> Laney defines XRM as extending CRM disciplines to secondary allies such as the government, press and industry consortia.

CRM futurist Dennison DeGregor describes a shift from 'push CRM' toward a 'customer transparency' (CT) model, due to the increased proliferation of channels, devices, and social media.<ref>{{cite book | year = 2011 | title = Customer-Transparent Enterprise: Beyond 20th Century CRM | first = Dennison | last = DeGregor | publisher = Motivational Press | isbn = 1-935723-23-5}}</ref>
