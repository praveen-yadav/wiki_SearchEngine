'''Domenico Alberti''' (c. 1710&nbsp;â€“ 14 October 1740) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[singer]], [[harpsichord]]ist, and [[composer]].

Alberti was born in [[Venice]]<ref name="Harvard Bio">{{cite book|last=Randel|first=Don Michael, ed.|title=The Harvard biographical dictionary of music|year=1996|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard Univ. Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0-674-37299-9|pages=11|chapter=Alberti, Domenico}}</ref> and studied [[music]] with [[Antonio Lotti]]. He wrote [[opera]]s, [[song]]s, and [[sonata (music)|sonatas]] for [[keyboard instrument]]s, for which he is best known today. These sonatas frequently employ a particular kind of [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] [[accompaniment]] in the left hand that is now known as the ''[[Alberti bass]]''. It consists of regular broken [[chord (music)|chord]]s, with the lowest note sounding first, then the highest, then the middle and then the highest again. This pattern is repeated. Today, Alberti is regarded as a minor composer, and his works are played or recorded only irregularly. The Alberti bass was used by many later composers, and it became an important element in much keyboard music of the [[Classical music era]].

An example of Alberti bass ([[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[Piano Sonata, K. 545 (Mozart)|Piano Sonata, K 545]]''):<ref>{{cite book|last=Rink|first=John|title=Musical performance: a guide to understanding|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1984}}</ref>

In his own lifetime, Alberti was known as a singer. He often used to accompany himself on the harpsichord. Little is known of his life, but he was [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Ambassador (diplomacy)|ambassador]] to [[Spain]] in 1736, where the famous [[castrato]] singer [[Farinelli]] heard him sing. Farinelli was said to have been impressed, although Alberti was an amateur.

Alberti's best known pieces are his keyboard sonatas, although even they are very rarely performed. It is thought he wrote around 36 sonatas, of which 14 have survived. They all have two movements, each in [[binary form]].

It is probable that [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s first [[violin sonata]]s, written at the age of seven, were modeled on Alberti's work.

Alberti died in 1740 in [[Rome]].
