An '''abscess''' ({{Lang-lat|abscessus}}) is a collection of [[pus]] ([[neutrophils]]) that has accumulated within a tissue because of an inflammatory process in response to either an [[infection|infectious]] process (usually caused by [[bacteria]] or [[parasite]]s) or other foreign materials (e.g., splinters, [[bullet]] [[wound]]s, or injecting needles). It is a [[immune system|defensive reaction]] of the tissue to prevent the spread of infectious materials to other parts of the body. 

The organisms or foreign materials kill the local [[cell (biology)|cells]], resulting in the release of [[cytokine]]s.  The cytokines trigger an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]], which draws large numbers of [[white blood cell]]s to the area and increases the regional [[blood]] flow.

The final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall, or capsule, that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures. However, such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus, or from reaching the causative organism or foreign object.

Abscesses must be differentiated from [[empyema]]s, which are accumulations of pus in a preexisting rather than a newly formed anatomical cavity.

==Signs and symptoms==
The cardinal symptoms and signs of any kind of inflammatory process are redness, heat, swelling, pain and loss of function. Abscesses may occur in any kind of solid tissue but most frequently on skin surface (where they may be superficial pustules ([[boil]]s) or deep skin abscesses), in the lungs, [[brain abscess|brain]], [[Tooth abscess|teeth]], kidneys and tonsils.  Major complications are spreading of the abscess material to adjacent or remote tissues and extensive regional tissue death ([[gangrene]]).  Abscesses in most parts of the body rarely heal themselves, so prompt medical attention is indicated at the first suspicion of an abscess.
An abscess could potentially be fatal (although this is rare) if it compresses vital structures such as the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] in the context of a deep neck abscess.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Treatment==
Wound abscesses can be treated with antibiotics. They require surgical intervention, [[debridement]], and [[curettage]].<ref>{{cite book |editor=McLatchie G, Leaper D  |title=Oxford Handbook of Clinical Surgery |publisher=OUP |location=Oxford |year=2007 |edition=2nd}}</ref>

===Incision and drainage===

[[File:HumeralAbscess.jpg|thumb|Abscess following curettage.]]
The abscess should be inspected to identify if foreign objects are a cause, which may require their removal. If foreign objects are not the cause, a doctor will incise and drain the abscess and prescribe painkillers and possibly antibiotics.<ref>{{cite book |title=Surgery: Facts and Figures |last=Green |first=James |coauthors=Saj Wajed |year=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn= 1-900151-96-0}}</ref>

[[Surgery|Surgical]] drainage of the abscess (e.g., [[Incision and drainage|lancing]]) is usually indicated once the abscess has developed from a harder [[serous]] inflammation to a softer [[pus]] stage. This is expressed in the [[Latin]] medical [[aphorism]]: ''[[Ubi pus, ibi evacua]]''.

In critical areas where surgery presents a high risk, it may be delayed or used as a last resort.  The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.

===Packing=== 
In North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed. However, there is no evidence to support this practice and it may in fact delay healing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=272 |title=BestBets: abscesses; to pack or not to pack }}</ref>  To try to answer this question more definitely, a randomized double-blind study was started in September 2008 and was completed in March 2010.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00746109|Study of Wound Packing After Superficial Skin Abscess Drainage}}</ref> Interim analysis of data from this study suggests that "wound packing may significantly increase the failure rates."  <ref>{{cite web |url=http://aap.confex.com/aap/2009/webprogram/Paper5982.html |title=Randomized Clinical Trial of Packing Following Incision and Drainage of Superficial Skin Abscesses in the Pediatric Emergency Department }}</ref> A small pilot study has found no benefit from packing of simple cutaneous abscesses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Malley GF, Dominici P, Giraldo P, ''et al.'' |title=Routine Packing of Simple Cutaneous Abscesses Is Painful and Probably Unnecessary |journal=Acad Emerg Med |volume= 16|issue= 5|pages= 470–3|year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19388915 |doi=10.1111/j.1553-2712.2009.00409.x }}</ref>

===Primary closure===
Primary closure has been successful when combined with [[curettage]] and [[antibiotics]]<ref name="pmid9137156">{{cite journal |author=Abraham N, Doudle M, Carson P |title=Open versus closed surgical treatment of abscesses: a controlled clinical trial |journal=The Australian and New Zealand journal of surgery |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=173–6 |year=1997 |pmid=9137156 |doi=10.1111/j.1445-2197.1997.tb01934.x}}</ref> or with curettage alone.<ref name="pmid3881155">{{cite journal |author=Stewart MP, Laing MR, Krukowski ZH |title=Treatment of acute abscesses by incision, curettage and primary suture without antibiotics: a controlled clinical trial |journal=The British journal of surgery |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=66–7 |year=1985 |pmid=3881155 |doi=10.1002/bjs.1800720125}}</ref> However, another [[randomized controlled trial]] found primary closure led to 35% failing to heal primarily and primary closure longer median number of days to closure (8.9 versus 7.8).<ref name="pmid6805714">{{cite journal |author=Simms MH, Curran F, Johnson RA, ''et al.'' |title=Treatment of acute abscesses in the casualty department |journal=British medical journal (Clinical research ed.) |volume=284 |issue=6332 |pages=1827–9 |year=1982 |pmid=6805714 |doi=10.1136/bmj.284.6332.1827 |pmc=1498721}}</ref>

=== Antibiotics ===
As ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' [[bacteria]] is a common cause, an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used.  With the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]), these traditional antibiotics may be ineffective; alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]], and [[doxycycline]]. These antibiotics may also be prescribed to patients with a documented allergy to penicillin. (If the condition is thought to be [[cellulitis]] rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin). It is important to note that [[antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels. Whilst most medical texts advocate surgical incision some medical doctors will treat small abscesses conservatively with antibiotics.

=== Recurrent infections ===
Recurrent abscesses are often caused by community-acquired [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]. While resistant to most beta lactam antibiotics commonly used for skin infections, it remains sensitive to alternative antibiotics, e.g., clindamycin (Cleocin), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim), and doxycycline (unlike hospital-acquired MRSA that may only be sensitive to vancomycin IV).

To prevent recurrent infections due to ''[[Staphylococcus]]'', consider the following measures:
*Topical [[mupirocin]] applied to the [[nares]].<ref name=Raz1996>{{cite journal | author = Raz R, Miron D, Colodner R, Staler Z, Samara Z, Keness Y | title = A 1-year trial of nasal mupirocin in the prevention of recurrent staphylococcal nasal colonization and skin infection | journal = Arch Intern Med | volume = 156 | issue = 10 | pages = 1109–12 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8638999 | doi = 10.1001/archinte.156.10.1109}}</ref> In this [[randomized controlled trial]], patients used nasal mupirocin twice daily 5 days a month for 1 year.
*[[Chlorhexidine]] baths,<ref name=Watanakunakorn>{{cite journal | author = Watanakunakorn C, Axelson C, Bota B, Stahl C | title = Mupirocin ointment with and without chlorhexidine baths in the eradication of Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in nursing home residents | journal = Am J Infect Control | volume = 23 | issue = 5 | pages = 306–9 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8585642 | doi = 10.1016/0196-6553(95)90061-6}}</ref> In a [[randomized controlled trial]], nasal recolonization with S. aureus occurred at 12 weeks in 24% of nursing home residents receiving mupirocin ointment alone (6/25) and in 15% of residents receiving mupirocin ointment plus chlorhexidine baths daily for the first three days of mupirocin treatment (4/27). Although these results did not reach [[statistical significance]], the baths are an easy treatment.

===Magnesium sulfate paste===
Historically abscesses as well as boils and many other collections of pus have been treated via application of [[magnesium sulfate]] ([[Epsom salt]]) paste. This works by drawing the infected pus to the surface of the skin before rupturing and leaking out. After this the body will usually repair the old infected cavity. Magnesium sulfate is therefore best applied at night with a sterile dressing covering it, as the rupture itself is not painful but the drawing up may be uncomfortable.

==Perianal abscess==
[[Perianal abscesses]] can be seen in patients with for example [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (such as [[Crohn's disease]]) or [[diabetes]].  Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration, hard stool or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication.  This wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area, and then develops into an abscess.  This often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the [[anus]] which grows larger and more painful with time.  Like other abscesses, perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment, such as an incision and [[debridement]] or [[Lancing (surgical procedure)|lancing]].
