'''Cartography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] Χάρτης, ''khartes'' = papyrus (paper) and ''graphein'' = to write) is the study and practice of making [[map]]s. Combining science, [[aesthetics]], and technique, cartography builds on the premise that reality can be modeled in ways that communicate spatial information effectively.

The fundamental problems of traditional cartography are to:{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
*Set the map's agenda and select traits of the object to be mapped. This is the concern of map editing. Traits may be physical, such as roads or land masses, or may be abstract, such as [[Toponomy|toponyms]] or political boundaries.
*Represent the terrain of the mapped object on flat media. This is the concern of [[map projection]]s.
*Eliminate characteristics of the mapped object that are not relevant to the map's purpose. This is the concern of [[Cartographic generalization|generalization]].
*Reduce the complexity of the characteristics that will be mapped. This is also the concern of generalization.
*Orchestrate the elements of the map to best convey its message to its audience. This is the concern of [[#Map design|map design]].

Modern cartography is largely integrated with [[geographic information science]] (GIScience) and constitutes many theoretical and practical foundations of [[geographic information system]]s.

The earliest known map is a matter of some debate, both because the definition of "map" is not sharp and because some artifacts speculated to be maps might actually be something else.

In the [[Age of Exploration]], from the 15th century to the 17th century, [[Europe]]an cartographers both copied earlier maps (some of which had been passed down for centuries) and drew their own based on explorers' observations and new [[surveying]] techniques. The invention of the [[magnetic compass]], [[telescope]] and [[sextant]] enabled increasing accuracy. In 1492, [[Martin Behaim]], a German cartographer, made the oldest extant globe of the Earth.<ref>[http://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/guide/gmillgtm.html Globes and Terrain Models -- Geography and Maps: An Illustrated Guide], Library of Congress</ref>

[[Johannes Werner]] refined and promoted the [[Werner projection]]. In 1507, [[Martin Waldseemüller]] produced a globular world map and a large 12-panel world wall map (''[[Universalis Cosmographia]]'') bearing the first use of the name "America". [[Portugal|Portuguese]] cartographer [[Diego Ribero]] was the author of the first known planisphere with a graduated Equator (1527). [[Italy|Italian]] cartographer [[Battista Agnese]] produced at least 71 manuscript atlases of sea charts.

Due to the sheer physical difficulties inherent in cartography, map-makers frequently lifted material from earlier works without giving credit to the original cartographer. For example, one of the most famous early maps of North America is unofficially known as the "Beaver Map", published in 1715 by [[Herman Moll]]. This map is an exact reproduction of a 1698 work by [[Nicolas de Fer]]. De Fer in turn had copied images that were first printed in books by [[Louis Hennepin]], published in 1697, and [[François Du Creux]], in 1664. By the 18th century, map-makers started to give credit to the original engraver by printing the phrase "After [the original cartographer]" on the work.<ref>"Map Imitation" in [http://www.collectionscanada.ca/forgery/002035-300-e.html?PHPSESSID=el7bd0vpd8cto0amsqqq5kaj22 Detecting the Truth: Fakes, Forgeries and Trickery]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}, a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada</ref>

==Technological changes==

Real-time map construction improves productivity and quality of mapping. Image shows mapping of forest structure (position of trees, dead wood and canopy).]]

In cartography, technology has continually changed in order to meet the demands of new generations of mapmakers and map users. The first maps were manually constructed with brushes and parchment; therefore, varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of magnetic devices, such as the [[compass]] and much later, [[magnetic storage]] devices, allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to store and manipulate them digitally.

Advances in mechanical devices such as the [[printing press]], [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and [[vernier scale|vernier]], allowed for the mass production of maps and the ability to make accurate reproductions from more accurate data. Optical technology, such as the [[telescope]], [[sextant]] and other devices that use telescopes, allowed for accurate surveying of land and the ability of mapmakers and navigators to find their [[latitude]] by measuring angles to the [[North Star]] at night or the [[sun]] at noon.

Advances in photochemical technology, such as the [[lithography|lithographic]] and [[photography|photochemical processes]], have allowed for the creation of maps that have fine details, do not distort in shape and resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving, which further shortened the time it takes to make and reproduce maps.

Advancements in electronic technology in the 20th century ushered in another revolution in cartography. Ready availability of [[Computer hardware|computers and peripherals]] such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters, along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, spatial analysis, and database management, have democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials. See also: [[digital raster graphic]].

These days most commercial-quality maps are made using [[software]] that falls into one of three main types: [[computer-aided design|CAD]], [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and specialized illustration [[software]]. Spatial information can be stored in a [[database]], from which it can be extracted on demand. These tools lead to increasingly dynamic, interactive [[map]]s that can be manipulated digitally.

With the [[rugged computer|field rugged computers]], [[GPS]] and [[laser rangefinder]]s, it is possible to perform mapping directly in the terrain. Construction of a map in real time, for example by using [[Field-Map]] technology, improves productivity and quality of the result.

==Map types==

===General vs thematic cartography===
[[Image:Orienteringskort bygholm 2005 detail.jpg|thumb|Small section of an orienteering map.]]
[[Image:Easter Island map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map of [[Easter Island]].]]
[[Image:Maps-for-free Sierra Nevada.png|thumb|Relief map [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]]]]

In understanding basic maps, the field of cartography can be divided into two general categories: general cartography and thematic cartography. General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example, the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:50,000 (replacing the older 1&nbsp;inch to 1 mile) "[[Ordnance Survey]]" maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail.

[[Thematic map|Thematic cartography]] involves maps of specific geographic themes, oriented toward specific audiences. A couple of examples might be a [[Thematic map#Dot|dot map]] showing corn production in Indiana or a shaded area map of Ohio counties, divided into numerical [[Choropleth map|choropleth]] classes. As the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century, thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial, cultural and social data.

An [[orienteering]] map combines both general and thematic cartography, designed for a very specific user community. The most prominent thematic element is shading, that indicates degrees of difficulty of travel due to vegetation. The vegetation itself is not identified, merely classified by the difficulty ("fight") that it presents.

===Topographic vs topological===
A [[topographic map]] is primarily concerned with the [[topography|topographic]] description of a place, including (especially in the 20th and 21st centuries) the use of [[contour line]]s showing elevation. [[Terrain]] or relief can be shown in a variety of ways (see [[Cartographic relief depiction]]).

A [[topological map]] is a very general type of map, the kind you might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information. [[Harry Beck|Beck's]] [[Tube map|London Underground map]] is an iconic example. Though the most widely used map of "The Tube," it preserves little of reality: it varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions. The only topography on it is the [[River Thames]], letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river. That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space.<ref>{{harvnb|Ovenden|2007|page=22}}</ref> Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfils its purpose.<ref>{{cite book |author=Devlin, Keith |title=The Millennium Problems |location=New York, New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2002 |pages=162–163 |isbn=978-0-465-01730-0}}</ref>

==Map design==
[[Image:Livingston-Greenwich-map.jpg|thumb|right|Illustrated map.]]

===Map purpose and selection of information===
[[Arthur H. Robinson]], an American cartographer influential in thematic cartography, stated that a map not properly designed "will be a cartographic failure." He also claimed, when considering all aspects of cartography, that "map design is perhaps the most complex."<ref>{{cite book |author=Robinson, A.H. |title=Elements of Cartography |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=1953 |isbn=0-471-72805-5}}</ref> Robinson codified the mapmaker's understanding that a map must be designed foremost with consideration to the audience and its needs.

From the very beginning of mapmaking, maps "have been made for some particular purpose or set of purposes".<ref>{{cite book |author=Robinson, A.H. |title=Early Thematic Mapping: In the History of Cartography |location=Chicago |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=1982 |isbn=0-226-72285-6}}</ref> The intent of the map should be illustrated in a manner in which the percipient acknowledges its purpose in a timely fashion. The term ''percipient'' refers to the person receiving information and was coined by Robinson.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Alan MacEachren|MacEachren, A.M.]] |title=How Maps Work |location=New York |publisher=The Guilford Press |year=1995 |isbn=1-57230-040-X}}</ref> The principle of [[Figure-ground in map design|figure-ground]] refers to this notion of engaging the user by presenting a clear presentation, leaving no confusion concerning the purpose of the map. This will enhance the user's experience and keep his attention. If the user is unable to identify what is being demonstrated in a reasonable fashion, the map may be regarded as useless.

Making a meaningful map is the ultimate goal. [[Alan MacEachren]] explains that a well designed map "is convincing because it implies authenticity" (1994, pp.&nbsp;9). An interesting map will no doubt engage a reader. Information richness or a map that is multivariate shows relationships within the map. Showing several variables allows comparison, which adds to the meaningfulness of the map. This also generates hypothesis and stimulates ideas and perhaps further research. In order to convey the message of the map, the creator must design it in a manner which will aid the reader in the overall understanding of its purpose. The title of a map may provide the "needed link" necessary for communicating that message, but the overall design of the map fosters the manner in which the reader interprets it (Monmonier, 1993, pp.&nbsp;93).

In the 21st century it is possible to find a map of virtually anything from the inner workings of the [[human body]] to the [[virtual world]]s of [[cyberspace]]. Therefore there are now a huge variety of different styles and types of map - for example, one area which has evolved a specific and recognisable variation are those used by [[public transport]] organisations to guide [[passenger]]s, namely [[urban rail and metro maps]], many of which are loosely based on 45 degree angles as originally perfected by [[Harry Beck]] and [[George Dow]].

===Naming conventions===
Most maps use text to [[Labeling (map design)|label]] places and for such things as the map title, legend and other information. Although maps are often made in one specific language, place names often differ between languages. So a map made in English may use the name ''Germany'' for that country, while a German map would use ''Deutschland'' and a French map ''Allemagne''. A non-native term for a place is referred to as an [[exonym]].

In some cases the correct name is not clear. For example, the nation of Burma officially changed its name to [[Myanmar]], but many nations do not recognize the ruling junta and continue to use ''Burma''. Sometimes an official name change is resisted in other languages and the older name may remain in common use. Examples include the use of ''Saigon'' for [[Ho Chi Minh City]], ''Bangkok'' for [[Bangkok|Krung Thep]] and ''Ivory Coast'' for [[Côte d'Ivoire]].

Difficulties arise when [[transliteration]] or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] between [[writing system]]s is required. Some well-known places have well-established names in other languages and writing systems, such as ''Russia'' or ''Rußland'' for Росси́я, but in other cases a system of transliteration or transcription is required. Even in the former case, the exclusive use of an exonym may be unhelpful for the map user. It will not be much use for an English user of a map of Italy to show Livorno ''only'' as "Leghorn" when road signs and railway timetables show it as "Livorno". In transliteration, the characters in one script are represented by characters in another. For example, the [[Cyrillic]] letter ''Р'' is usually written as ''R'' in the [[Latin script]], although in many cases it is not as simple as a one-for-one equivalence. Systems exist for transliteration of [[Arabic script|Arabic]], but the results may vary. For example, the Yemeni city of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-Mukhā, Mocca and Moka. Transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another, while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another. Chinese writing is now usually converted to the Latin alphabet through the [[Pinyin]] phonetic transcription systems. Other systems were used in the past, such as [[Wade-Giles]], resulting in the city being spelled ''Beijing'' on newer English maps and ''Peking'' on older ones.

Further difficulties arise when countries, especially former colonies, do not have a strong national geographic naming standard. In such cases, cartographers may have to choose between various phonetic spellings of local names versus older imposed, sometimes resented, colonial names. Some countries have multiple official languages, resulting in multiple official placenames. For example, the capital of Belgium is both ''Brussel'' and ''Bruxelles''. In Canada, English and French are official languages and places have names in both languages. [[British Columbia]] is also officially named ''la Colombie-Britannique''. English maps rarely show the French names outside of Quebec, which itself is spelled ''Québec'' in French.<ref>This section based on: {{cite encyclopedia |title=Transliteration Systems |encyclopedia=Illustrated Atlas of the World, Quantum Electronics  |publisher=[[Rand McNally]] |year=1992 |doi=10.1070/QE1995v025n01ABEH013084 |bibcode=1995QuEle..25...87. |volume=25 |pages=87–89 |isbn=0-528-83492-4}}</ref>

The study of placenames is called [[toponymy]], while that of the origin and historical usage of placenames as words is [[etymology]].

In order to improve legibility or to aid the illiterate, some maps have been produced using pictograms to represent places. The iconic example of this practice is [[Lance Wyman|Lance Wyman's]] early plans for the [[Mexico City Metro]], on which stations were shown simply as stylized logos. Wyman also prototyped such a map for the [[Washington Metro]], though ultimately the idea was rejected. Other cities experimenting with such maps are [[Fukuoka]], [[Guadalajara]] and [[Monterrey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ovenden|2007|pages=60, 131, 132, 135}}</ref>

===Map symbology===
[[File:Southwest Ireland Thornton.jpg|thumb|A map of the southwest coast of [[Ireland]] created in the early 18th century. Notice the north arrow at the bottom of the map. Also, colors are used in the map to distinguish different geographical areas.]]
The quality of a map's design affects its reader's ability to extract information and to learn from the map. Cartographic [[symbology]] has been developed in an effort to portray the world accurately and effectively convey information to the map reader. A legend explains the pictorial language of the map, known as its symbology. The title indicates the region the map portrays; the map image portrays the region and so on. Although every map element serves some purpose, convention only dictates inclusion of some elements, while others are considered optional. A menu of map elements includes the neatline (border), [[compass rose]] or north arrow, overview map, [[bar scale]], map projection and information about the map sources, accuracy and publication.

When examining a landscape, scale can be intuited from trees, houses and cars. Not so with a map. Even such a simple thing as a north arrow is crucial. It may seem obvious that the top of a map should point north, but this might not be the case.

[[Map coloring]] is also very important. How the cartographer displays the data in different hues can greatly affect the understanding or feel of the map. Different intensities of hue portray different objectives the cartographer is attempting to get across to the audience. Today, personal computers can display up to 16 million distinct colors at a time. This fact allows for a multitude of color options for even for the most demanding maps. Moreover, computers can easily hatch patterns in colors to give even more options. This is very beneficial, when symbolizing data in categories such as quintile and equal interval classifications.

Quantitative symbols give a visual measure of the relative size/importance/number that a symbol represents and to symbolize this data on a map, there are two major classes of symbols used for portraying quantitative properties. Proportional symbols change their visual weight according to a quantitative property. These are appropriate for extensive statistics. [[Choropleth map]]s portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity (or value) of the color is evaluated by the eye as a measure of intensity or concentration.

===Map generalization===
{{main|Cartographic generalization}}
A good map has to compromise between portraying the items of interest (or [[thematic map|themes]]) in the right place on the map, and the need to show that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on the map and might displace some other item of information. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a ''slightly'' incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space ''on the ground''. A good example from the late 1980s was the [[Ordnance Survey]]'s first digital maps, where the ''absolute'' positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of metres away from [[ground truth]], when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.

===Map projections===
{{main|map projection}}

The Earth being spherical, any flat representation generates distortions such that shapes and areas cannot both be conserved simultaneously, and distances can never all be preserved.<ref name="Albrecht 2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/lectures/lec6concepts/map%20coordinate%20systems/how%20to%20choose%20a%20projection.htm|last=Albrecht|first=Jochen|authorlink=[http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/]|series=[http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/201syllabusSp05.htm Introduction to Mapping Sciences, 2005]|title=Maps projections|accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref> The mapmaker must choose a suitable '''map projection''' according to the space to be mapped and the purpose of the map.

==Cartographic errors==
Some maps contain deliberate errors or distortions, either as [[Cartographic propaganda|propaganda]] or as a "[[watermark]]" to help the copyright owner identify infringement if the error appears in competitors' maps. The latter often come in the form of nonexistent, misnamed, or misspelled "[[trap streets]]".<ref>{{cite book | last = Monmonier | first = Mark | title = How to Lie with Maps | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-226-53421-9 | page = 51 |editor=2nd.}}</ref> Other names and forms for this are [[paper townsite]]s, [[fictitious entry|fictitious entries]], and copyright [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]]s.<ref>[http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Copyright_Easter_Eggs Openstreetmap.org Copyright Easter Eggs]</ref>

Another motive for deliberate errors is cartographic "vandalism": a mapmaker wishing to leave his or her mark on the work. Mount Richard, for example, was a fictitious peak on the [[Rocky Mountains]]' [[continental divide]] that appeared on a [[Boulder County, Colorado]] map in the early 1970s. It is believed to be the work of draftsman Richard Ciacci. The fiction was not discovered until two years later.

[[Sandy Island (New Caledonia)]] is an example of a fictitious location that stubbornly survives, reappearing on new maps copied from older maps while being deleted from other new editions. The time and reason for its original placement on maps is unknown.
