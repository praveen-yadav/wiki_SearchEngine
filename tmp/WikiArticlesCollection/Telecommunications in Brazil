'''Brazil''' has both modern technologies in the center-south portion, counting with [[3G]] [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]], [[DSL]] [[ISDB]] based Digital TV. Other areas of the country, particularly the north and north-west regions, lack even basic [[Analog device|analog]] [[PSTN]] [[telephone]] lines. This is a problem that the government is trying to solve by linking the liberation of new technologies such as [[WiMax]] and [[FTTH]]) only tied with compromises on extension of the service to less populated regions.

==International backbones==

===Submarine cables===

Several [[submarine communications cable|submarine cables]] link Brazil to the world:<ref>[http://www.teleco.com.br/tutoriais/tutorialcsub/pagina_2.asp teleco.com.br<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*'''Americas II''' cable entered operations on September 2000, connecting Brazil (Fortaleza) to United States.
*'''ATLANTIS-2''', with around 12 thousand kilometers in extension, operating since 2000, it connects Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and Natal) to Europe, Africa and South America. This is the only cable that connects [[South America]] to [[Africa]] and [[Europe]].
*'''EMERGIA – SAM 1''' cable connects all three [[Americas]], surrounding it with a total extension of more than 25 thousand kilometers.
*'''GLOBAL CROSSING - SAC''' Connects all Americas, surrounding them with a total extension of more than 15 thousand kilometers.
*'''GLOBENET/360 NETWORK''' Another link from North America to South America.
*'''UNISUR''' Interconnects Brazil, [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]].

All these cables have a [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] from 20 [[Data rate units|Gbit/s]] to 80 Gbit/s, and some have a projected final capacity of more than 1 Tbit/s.

==Television and radio==

Under the Brazilian constitution, television and radio are not treated as telecommunication ways to avoid creating problems with a series of regulations that reduce and control how international businesses and persons participate on it. It is worth mentioning that Brazil has the 2nd biggest media conglomerate in the world in terms of revenue, [[Rede Globo]].

==Internet==

{{main|Internet in Brazil}}

The Internet has become quite popular in Brazil, with steadily growing numbers in adhesion and availability, with numbers that position Brazil at the 6th spot on number of users.<ref>http://www.viuisso.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/onu_internet_br.jpg</ref> Many technologies are actually used to bring broadband Internet to consumers, with [[DSL]] and its variants being the most used, and [[3G]] technologies. 4G technologies were introduced in April 2013 but with limited range, being compatible with only a few smartphones models. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/17/us-brazil-telecom-smartphones-idUSBRE93G0NY20130417| title=Brazil launches 4G wireless service with few smartphone options}}</ref>
