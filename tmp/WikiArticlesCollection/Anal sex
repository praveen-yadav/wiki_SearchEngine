Stimulation from anal sex can additionally be affected by popular perception or portrayals of the activity, such as [[erotica]] or [[pornography]]. In pornography, anal sex is commonly portrayed as desirable, routine, without use of a [[personal lubricant]] or a condom, and painless; this can result in couples performing anal sex without care, and men and women believing that it is unusual for women, as receptive partners, to find no pleasure from the activity and instead discomfort or pain from it.<ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/><ref name="Crooks">See [http://books.google.com/books?id=MpRnPtmdRVwC&pg=PA560&dq=For+example,+a+young+woman+may+believe+that+there+is+something+wrong+with+her+when+she+does+not+experience+anal+sex+as+pain-free+and+pleasurable+as+women+appear+to+do+in+porn.&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cFuJUfH3JaP30gHb4oDwBg&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=For%20example%2C%20a%20young%20woman%20may%20believe%20that%20there%20is%20something%20wrong%20with%20her%20when%20she%20does%20not%20experience%20anal%20sex%20as%20pain-free%20and%20pleasurable%20as%20women%20appear%20to%20do%20in%20porn.&f=false page 550] for effects of viewing pornography with regard to anal sex, and [http://books.google.com/books?id=MpRnPtmdRVwC&pg=PA286&lpg=PA286&dq=+outercourse&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%20outercourse&f=false pages 286–289] for anal sex as a birth control method. {{cite book | title = Our Sexuality | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2010/2011 | pages = 570 pages | accessdate = May 7, 2013 |isbn = 0495812943,| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=MpRnPtmdRVwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Our+Sexuality&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YK2JUbmcHMvo0wHMnIHwDw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA | author = Robert Crooks, Karla Baur}}</ref><ref name="Boyle">{{cite book | title = Everyday Pornography| publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 2010 | pages = 170–171 | accessdate = May 7, 2013 |isbn = 0203847555,| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=8yznvRX-hfAC&pg=PA170&dq=Given+its+influence+on+sexual+knowledge+and+attitudes,+it+is+not+surprising+that+pornography+also+may+shift+boys%27+and+young+men%27s+sexual+expectations,+practices+and+repertoires.&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8JqJUazRGITH0gGK-YG4Bg&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Given%20its%20influence%20on%20sexual%20knowledge%20and%20attitudes%2C%20it%20is%20not%20surprising%20that%20pornography%20also%20may%20shift%20boys%27%20and%20young%20men%27s%20sexual%20expectations%2C%20practices%20and%20repertoires.&f=false| author = Karen Boyle}}</ref><ref name="Johansson">{{cite book | title = The Transformation of Sexuality: Gender And Identity In Contemporary Youth Culture | publisher = [[Ashgate Publishing]] | year = 2007 | pages = 56–58 | accessdate = May 7, 2013 |isbn = 1409490785,| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=XPm3JEiunnsC&pg=PA56&dq=Another+discussion+that+recurs+regularly+is+that+of+the+possible+effects+of+pornography+on+young+people%27s+sexual+habits+and+attitudes.&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gJ6JUfakGJLC0AHPp4GwCQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Another%20discussion%20that%20recurs%20regularly%20is%20that%20of%20the%20possible%20effects%20of%20pornography%20on%20young%20people%27s%20sexual%20habits%20and%20attitudes.&f=false | author = Thomas Johansson}}</ref> By contrast, each person's sphincter muscles react to penetration differently, the anal sphincters have tissues that are more prone to tearing, and the anus and rectum, unlike the vagina, do not provide [[Vaginal lubrication|natural lubrication]] for sexual penetration.

In a study of heterosexual anal sex, female participants stated that direct stimulation of multiple [[erogenous zone]]s simultaneously (the clitoris, the G-Spot, the anus, or other erogenous zones) enabled them to enjoy anal intercourse with much less discomfort compared to anal penetration by itself and to orgasm from it. Women who experienced orgasm during anal sex accompanied by direct stimulation of one or more of the other erogenous zones described it as more of a full-body experience compared to orgasm from direct clitoral stimulation alone.<ref name="DeCitore"/>

Kimberly R. McBride's ''[[Journal of Sex Research]]'' 2010 review on heterosexual anal sex uses the term ''anal intercourse'' to refer specifically to penile-anal penetration, and ''anal sex'' to refer to any form of anal sexual activity. The report suggests that anal sex is exotic among the sexual practices of some heterosexuals and that "for a certain number of heterosexuals, anal intercourse is pleasurable, exciting, and perhaps considered more intimate than vaginal sex".<ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/>

Anal intercourse is additionally sometimes used as a substitute for vaginal intercourse during [[menstruation]].<ref name="LeRoy"/> The risk of [[pregnancy]] during anal sex is greatly reduced, as anal sex alone cannot lead to pregnancy unless sperm is somehow transported to the vaginal opening. Because of this, some couples practice anal intercourse as a form of [[Birth control|contraception]], often in the absence of a condom.<ref name="LeRoy"/><ref name="Crooks"/><ref>SIECUS ''Prevalence of Unprotected Anal Sex among Teens Requires New Education Strategies"[http://www.sexedlibrary.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Feature.showFeature&featureid=1036&pageid=682&parentid=478] Accessed January 26, 2010</ref>

There are a variety of factors that make male-to-female anal intercourse riskier for the female than for the male. For example, the risk of injury to the woman during anal intercourse is significantly higher than the risk of injury to her during vaginal intercourse because of the durability of the vaginal tissues compared to the anal tissues,<ref name="WebMD"/><ref name="Rosenthal2">{{cite book |author=M.

===Virginity===

In 1992, a study conducted by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found that only 26% of men 18 to 59 and 20% of women 18 to 59 had engaged in heterosexual anal sex; a similar 2005 survey (also conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) found a rising incidence of anal sex relations in the American heterosexual population. The survey showed that 40% of men and 35% of women between 25 and 44 had engaged in heterosexual anal sex.<ref>William D. Mosher, PhD; Anjani Chandra, PhD; and Jo Jones, PhD, [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad362.pdf Sexual Behavior and Selected Health Measures: Men and Women 15–44 Years of Age], U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES, Division of Vital Statistics, September 15, 2005</ref> In terms of overall numbers of survey respondents, seven times as many women as gay men said that they engaged in anal intercourse, with this figure reflecting the larger heterosexual population size.<ref>[[Anne-Christine d'Adesky]], ''Expanding Microbicide Research'' in amfAR Global Link&nbsp;– Treatment Insider; May 2004</ref> According to a study from the [[National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior]] (NSSHB) that was authored by [[Debby Herbenick]] and other researchers, although anal intercourse is reported by fewer women than other partnered sex behaviors, partnered women in the age groups between 18–49 are significantly more likely to report having anal sex in the past 90 days.<ref>[http://www.nationalsexstudy.indiana.edu/ National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB).] Findings from the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, Center for Sexual Health Promotion, Indiana University. ''[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'', Vol. 7, Supplement 5.</ref> As of 2011, this survey provides the most up to date data about anal sex at the population level.

In a 2007 ''[[The Journal of Infectious Diseases]]'' report regarding the prevalence and correlates of heterosexual anal and oral sex among adolescents and adults in the United States, a National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) found that 34% men and 30% women reported ever participating in heterosexual anal sex. The percentage of participants reporting heterosexual anal sex was significantly higher among 20- to 24-year-olds and peaked among 30- to 34-year-olds.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18190267 | doi=10.1086/522867 | volume=196 | issue=12 | title=Prevalence and correlates of heterosexual anal and oral sex in adolescents and adults in the United States | year=2007 | month=December | journal=J.

It found that 16% of 1350 surveyed had had this type of sex in the previous 3 months, with condoms being used 29% of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/18245402/detail.html#- |title=Bradley Hasbro Children's Research Center}}</ref> However, given the subject matter, the survey hypothesized the prevalence was probably underestimated.<!-- A direct quote would be preferable here -->

In Kimberly R. McBride's 2010 clinical review on heterosexual anal intercourse and other forms of anal sexual activity, it is suggested that changing [[Norm (social)|norms]] may affect the frequency of heterosexual anal sex. McBride and her colleagues investigated the prevalence of non-intercourse anal sex behaviors among a sample of men (n=1,299) and women (n=1,919) compared to anal intercourse experience and found that 51% of men and 43% of women had participated in at least one act of oral–anal sex, manual–anal sex, or anal sex toy use.<ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/> The report states the majority of men (n=631) and women (n=856) who reported heterosexual anal intercourse in the past 12 months were in exclusive, monogamous relationships: 69% and 73%, respectively.<ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/>

Figures for prevalence can vary among different demographics, regions and nationalities. A 1999 South Korean survey of 586 women, 3.5% of respondents reported having had this type of sex.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.komci.org/GSResult.php?RID=0074KJA/1999.17.3.177&DT=6 |title=한국여성의 성형태에 대한 연구 (Sexual Behavior of Korean Women) |journal=Daehan Namseong Gwahak Hoeji |volume=17 |year=1999 |pages=177–185 |last=Yi |first=Ung-hoe |last2=Sin |first2=Jong-seong |last3=Choe |first3=Hyeong-gi |issue=3}}</ref> By contrast, a 2001 French survey of five hundred female respondents concluded that a total of 29% had engaged in this practice, with one third of these confirming to have enjoyed the experience.<ref name="French">{{cite web|title=Les pratiques sexuelles des Françaises |publisher=TNS/Sofres |url=http://www.tns-sofres.com/etudes/pol/030701_sexualite_r.htm |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |language=French| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070429151130/http://www.tns-sofres.com/etudes/pol/030701_sexualite_r.htm| archivedate = April 29, 2007}} Survey carried out by TNS/Sofres in a representative sample of 500 women from 18 to 65 years of age, in April and May 2002.</ref>

Figures for the prevalence of sexual behavior can also fluctuate over time. Edward O. Laumann's 1992 survey, reported in ''The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States'', found that about 20% of heterosexuals had engaged in male-to-female anal sex. [[Sexology|Sex researcher]] [[Alfred Kinsey]], working in the 1940s, had found that number to be closer to 40% at the time. A researcher from the [[University of British Columbia]] in 2005 put the number of heterosexuals who have engaged in this practice at between 30% and 50%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Healthy sex is all in the talk |publisher=The Georgia Straight |date=May 5, 2005 |url=http://www.straight.com/article/healthy-sex-is-all-in-the-talk |accessdate=June 14, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070629140924/http://www.straight.com/article/healthy-sex-is-all-in-the-talk| archivedate= June 29, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> According to [[Columbia University]]'s health website [[Go Ask Alice!]]: "Studies indicate that about 25 percent of heterosexual couples have had anal sex at least once, and 10 percent regularly have anal penetration."<ref name="Not all"/> The increase of anal sexual activity among heterosexuals has also been linked to the increase in anal pornography, especially if a person views it more regularly than a person who does not.<ref name="Dean and Delvin"/><ref name="Boyle"/><ref name="Johansson"/>

===Prevalence===
The prevalence of anal sex among gay men in the West has varied over time. Magnus Hirschfeld, in his 1914 work, ''The Homosexuality of Men and Women'', reported the rate of anal sex among gay men surveyed to be 8%, the least favored of all the practices documented.<ref>William A. Percy and John Lauritsen, Review in ''The Gay & Lesbian Review'', November–December 2002</ref> Likewise, scholars state that oral sex and mutual masturbation are more common than anal stimulation among gay men in long-term relationships,<ref name="Not all"/><ref name="Johnson and Johnson"/> and that anal intercourse is generally more popular among gay male couples than among heterosexual couples, but that "it ranks behind oral sex and mutual masturbation" among both sexual orientations in prevalence.<ref name="Weiten"/> Wellings et al. stated that "[t]he equation of 'homosexual' with 'anal' sex among men is common among lay and health professionals alike" and that "[y]et an Internet survey of 18,000 MSM across Europe (EMIS, 2011) showed that oral sex was most commonly practised, followed by mutual masturbation, with anal intercourse in third place".<ref name="Wellings"/>

By the 1950s in the United Kingdom, it was thought that about 15% of gay males had anal sex.<ref name="Hyde">{{cite book | author =Harford Montgomery Hyde|title=The Love that Dared Not Speak Its Name: A Candid History of Homosexuality in Britain|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]]|year=1970|pages=6–7|isbn=|accessdate=August 19, 2013|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mBkbAAAAYAAJ&q=The+Love+That+Dared+not+Speak+its+Name+1970&dq=The+Love+That+Dared+not+Speak+its+Name+1970&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5agSUpDaEuWM2QXl-IGgBw&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA}}</ref> The 1994 Laumann study suggests that 80% of gay men practice anal sex and 20% never engage in it at all.<ref>Laumann, E., Gagnon, J.H., Michael, R.T., and Michaels, S.

Pain during receptive anal sex is formally known as ''anodyspareunia.''<ref name=Heidelbaugh/> One study found that about 12% of gay men find it too painful to pursue receptive anal sex, and concluded that the perception of anal sex as painful is just as likely to be psychologically or emotionally based as it is to be physically based.<ref name=Ritter_Terndrup>[http://books.google.com/books?id=0sHWnt9WmRsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Handbook+of+affirmative+psychotherapy+with+lesbians+and+gay+men&hl=en&ei=I4JVTd38KoK8sAPGt9HSBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Handbook of affirmative psychotherapy with lesbians and gay men] By Kathleen Ritter, Anthony I.

Commonly, heterosexual men reject the idea of being receptive partners during anal sex because they believe it is a [[Femininity|feminine]] act, can make them vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay).<ref name="Zdrok"/><ref name="Odets"/> [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) information published in the ''[[BMJ]]'' in 1999, however, states:<blockquote>There are little published data on how many heterosexual men would like their anus to be sexually stimulated in a heterosexual relationship.

There is less research on anal sexual activity among [[women who have sex with women]] compared to couples of other sexual orientations. In 1987, a non-scientific study (Munson) was conducted of more than 100 members of a lesbian social organization in Colorado. When asked what techniques and lesbian sexual practices they used in their last ten sexual encounters, lesbians in their 30s were twice as likely as other age groups to engage in anal stimulation (with a finger or dildo).<ref name=Carroll/> While author Tom Boellstorff, when particularly examining anal sex among gay and lesbian individuals in Indonesia, stated that he had not heard of oral-anal contact or anal penetration as recognized forms of lesbian sexuality but assume they take place,<ref name="Boellstorff">{{cite book|author =Tom Boellstorff|title=The gay archipelago: sexuality and nation in Indonesia|isbn = 978-0-691-12334-9 |publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2005|pages=282 pages|accessdate=March 12, 2011|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Whr4Tb0EuZUC&pg=PA101&dq=%22I+have+not+heard+of+oral-anal+contact+or+anal+penetration+as+regonized+forms+of+lesbi+sex+uality+but+assume+they+take+place.%22#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> author [[Felice Newman]], in ''[[The Whole Lesbian Sex Book: A Passionate Guide for All of Us|The Whole Lesbian Sex Book]],'' cites anal sex as a part of lesbian sexual practices.<ref name="Newman"/>

Anal sex can expose participants to two principal dangers: infections due to the high number of infectious [[microorganism]]s not found elsewhere on the body, and physical damage to the anus and rectum due to their fragility.<ref name="Krasner"/><ref name="Werner"/> Increased experimentation with anal sex by people without sound knowledge about risks and what safety measures do and do not work may be linked to an increase in sexually transmitted infections; [[Columbia University]] professor and author Judy Kuriansk stated, "It really is shocking how many myths young people have about anal sex.

===Cancer===
Anal cancer is relatively rare, accounting for about 1% of gastrointestinal malignancies, but as many as 4,000 new cases can be diagnosed within a year in the United States, according to the [[American Cancer Society]].<ref name="cancer.org"/><ref name="www.fhcrc.org"/> Most cases of anal cancer are related to infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV).<ref name=cancer.org/><ref name=www.fhcrc.org/> Anal sex alone does not cause anal cancer; the risk of anal cancer through anal sex is attributed to HPV infection, which is often contracted through unprotected anal sex. The incidence of the disease has jumped 160% in men and 78% in women in the last thirty years, according to a 2004 American study. The increase is attributed to changing trends in sexual behavior (such as a history of multiple sex partners, fifteen or more, or receptive anal sex) and smoking. If a current smoker, there is a fourfold increase in risk, though independent of other behavioral risk factors, such as sexual activity. Receptive anal sex increases the incidence sevenfold.<ref name=www.fhcrc.org/>

Among the female control group studied, 21.5% had reported practicing anal sex, a significant increase from a previous case-control study by [[Epidemiology|epidemiologist]] Janet Daling of [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center|Fred Hutchinson's Public Health Sciences Division]]) and her colleagues, published in 1987, in which 11% of female controls had reported ever having anal sex. This and other studies also indicate that gay or bisexual sex among men is on the rise, which may account for the increase in anal cancer.<ref name=www.fhcrc.org/> "The sharpest increase was among African American men, whose incidence of anal cancer has more than doubled in the past three decades. Black men also had a lower survival rate from the disease." The study reported that the five-year survival rate for black men with early stage disease was 62% as compared to 79% for white men with localized cancer. However, the survey also reported that black men were more likely than white men to report having had intercourse with another male in the last year. Regarding all the increases, whether or not sexual practices have changed, Daling concluded, "[I]t also could be that people are just more likely to discuss their sexual behavior these days."<ref name=www.fhcrc.org/>

===Physical damage===
Physical damage to the rectum and anus can manifest as generalized ano-rectal trauma, [[anal fissure]]s, [[rectal prolapse]], and exacerbating [[hemorrhoid]]s Adequate lubrication and preparation reduces the risk of physical trauma, while the risk increases with use of alcohol or other drugs that dull sensitivity.

Loss of bowel control is not a likely result of anal sex, but may be caused by repeated injury or the insertion of large objects. [[Kegel exercise]]s have been recommended to maintain muscle tone by a speaker at the [[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]] and the American Association of Sex Educators, who noted he had never personally observed "loosening" in any of his patients.

A 1993 study published in the ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' found that fourteen out of a sample of forty men receiving anal intercourse experienced episodes of frequent anal incontinence.<ref>[http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/content/abstract/86/3/144 Effect of anoreceptive intercourse on anorectal function] AJ Miles, TG Allen-Mersh and C Wastell, Department of Surgery, Westminster Hospital, London; in ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'' Vol 86, Issue 3 144–147; 1993. Retrieved April 29, 2007.</ref> However, a 1997 study published in the ''American Journal of Gastroenterology'' found no difference in levels of incontinence between homosexual men who engaged in anal sex and heterosexual men who did not, and criticized the earlier study for its inclusion of [[flatulence]] in its definition of incontinence.<ref>Chun AB, Rose S, Mitrani C, Silvestre AJ, Wald A: Anal sphincter structure and function in homosexual males engaging in anal receptive intercourse.

==Cultural views==
[[File:Suzuki Harunobu Shunga.jpg|thumb|[[Suzuki Harunobu]], A [[shunga]] print depicting an older and a younger man]]
Historically, a number of cultures have recorded the practice of anal intercourse, especially between men.

===Ancient and non-Western cultures===
The term ''[[Greek love]]'' has long been used to refer to the practice, and in modern times, "doing it the Greek way" is sometimes used as slang for anal sex. However, homosexual anal sex was not a universally accepted practice in [[Ancient Greece]]. It was the target of jokes in surviving comedies; [[Aristophanes]] mockingly alludes to the practice, claiming that "Most citizens are europroktoi (wide-arsed) now".<ref>[http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Eleven-Comediesx46527.html The Eleven Comedies] Aristophanes et al., Part 7 out of 8, retrieved</ref> While [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pedagogic pederasty]] was an essential element in the education of male youths, these relationships, at least in Athens and Sparta, were expected to steer clear of penetrative sex of any kind. There are very few works of pottery or other art that display anal sex between older men and boys, let alone with adult men. Most such works depict fondling or [[intercrural sex]], which was not condemned for violating and feminizing the boys. Other sources make it clear that the practice was criticized as shameful,<ref>[[Aesop]], "Zeus and Shame" (Perry 109, Chambry 118, Gibbs 528), in ''Fables''</ref> and seen as a form of [[hubris]].<ref>David Cohen, "Sexuality, Violence, and the Athenian Law of ''Hubris"'' ''Greece and Rome;'' V.38.2 pp171-188</ref>{{full|date=November 2012}}
[[File:Warren Cup BM GR 1999.4-26.1 n1.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] males on the [[Warren Cup]], British Museum]]

In later [[Greek literature#Roman Age|Roman-era Greek poetry]], anal sex became a common topos, represented as taking place with "eligible" youths: those who had attained the proper age but had not yet become adults. Seducing children into the practice was considered very shameful for the adult, and having such relations with a male who was no longer adolescent was considered more shameful for the young male than for the one mounting him. Greek courtesans, or [[hetaera]]e, are said to have frequently practiced heterosexual anal intercourse as a means of preventing pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = James E.  | year = 1995 | title = The Practices of Romans 1:26: Homosexual or Heterosexual? | url = | journal = Novum Testamentum | volume = 37 | issue = 1| page = 9 | quote = Heterosexual anal intercourse is best illustrated in Classical vase paintings of hetaerae with their clients, and some scholars interpret this as a form of contraception}}</ref> The acceptability of anal sex thus varied with the time-period and the location, as Ancient Greece spanned a long time and stretched over three continents and two major seas.

For a male citizen to take the passive (or receptive) role in anal intercourse was condemned in Rome as an act of ''impudicitia'' (immodesty or unchastity). Free men, however, frequently took the active role with a young slave, known as a ''[[catamite]]'' or ''puer delicatus''. The Romans thought of anal sex as something specifically "Greek", although Roman men often availed themselves of their own slaves or others in this way.<ref>Quignard, Pascal (1996) ''Le Sexe et l'effroi''</ref>{{full|date=November 2012}}

In Japan, records (including detailed [[shunga]]) show that at least some men in relationships with other men did engage in penetrative anal intercourse.

Evidence suggestive of widespread heterosexual anal intercourse in a pre-modern culture can be found in the erotic vases, or stirrup-spout pots, made by the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] people of Peru; in a survey<ref>[[Rafael Larco Hoyle]] and Dr. Francisco Guerra, quoted in Tannahill, Reay (1992) ''Sex in History'', p. 297-298</ref> of a collection of these pots, it was found that 31 percent of them depicted heterosexual anal intercourse significantly more than any other sex act. Moche pottery of this type belonged to the world of the dead, which was believed to be a reversal of life. Therefore, the reverse of common practices was often portrayed. The [[Larco Museum]] houses an erotic gallery in which this pottery is showcased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museolarco.org/iep_er.shtml |title=Larco Museum - Lima Peru - Experience Ancient Peru - Permanent Exhibition :: |publisher=Museolarco.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref>

The 19th century anthropologist [[Richard Francis Burton]] theorized that there is a geographical [[Sotadic zone]] wherein penetrative intercourse between men is particularly prevalent and accepted; moreover he was one of the first writers to advance the premise that such an orientation is biologically determined.<ref name="burton1885">{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/burton-te.html |first=Sir Richard Francis |last=Burton |work="Terminal Essay", from his translation of The Arabian Nights |title=Section D: Pederasty |year=1885}}</ref>

===Western cultures===
In many Western countries, anal sex has generally been taboo since the [[Middle Ages]]<ref>{{cite book |title=Good in Bed Guide to Anal Pleasuring |publisher=Good in Bed Guides |first=Debby |last=Herbenick |isbn=978-0-9843221-6-9 |pages=12–13}}</ref> when [[heresy in Christianity|heretical]] movements were sometimes attacked by accusations that their members practised anal sex among themselves.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} At that time the mainstream Christian clergy was not celibate, but the highest orders of some heretical sects were, leading to rumors that their celibacy was a sign of their attraction to members of the same sex.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The term ''[[buggery]]'' originated in [[medieval]] Europe as an insult used to describe the rumoured same-sex sexual practices of the heretics from a sect originating in [[Bulgaria]], where its followers were called ''[[bogomilism|bogomils]]''{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}; when they spread out of the country they were called ''buggres'' (from the [[ethnonym]] ''Bulgars'').{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Another term for the practice, more archaic, is "pedicate" from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''pedicare'', with the same meaning.<ref>"I have derived the word pedicate from the Latin paedicare or pedicare, meaning "to penetrate anally". in "The Warren Cup: homoerotic love and symposial rhetoric in silver", Note 6;''The Art Bulletin'', March 1999 by John Pollini [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0422/is_1_81/ai_54517307/pg_30]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref>

The Renaissance poet [[Pietro Aretino]] advocated the practice in his ''Sonetti Lussuriosi'' (Lust Sonnets).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Daileader |first=Celia R. |title=Back Door Sex: Renaissance Gynosodomy, Aretino, and the Exotic |journal=English Literary History |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=303–334 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |date=Summer 2002 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/elh/v069/69.2daileader.pdf |accessdate=April 30, 2007|format=PDF| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070516105828/http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/elh/v069/69.2daileader.pdf| archivedate= May 16, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

While men who engaged in homosexual relationships were generally suspected of engaging in anal sex, many such individuals did not. Among these, in recent times, have been [[André Gide]], who found it repulsive;<ref>Love's Litany By Kevin Kopelson p.62</ref>{{full|date=November 2012}} and [[Noël Coward]], who had a horror of disease, and asserted when young that "I'd never do anything&nbsp;– well the disgusting thing they do&nbsp;– because I know I could get something wrong with me".<ref>Philip Hoare, ''Noel Coward: A Biography'' p.18</ref>{{full|date=November 2012}}

====Judaism====
The [[Mishneh Torah]], a text considered authoritative by [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] sects,<ref>Isidore Twersky, ''Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah)'', Yale Judaica Series, vol. XII (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1980). passim, and especially Chapter VII, "Epilogue", pp. 515–538.</ref> states "since a man’s wife is permitted to him, he may act with her in any manner whatsoever. He may have intercourse with her whenever he so desires and kiss any organ of her body he wishes, and he may have intercourse with her naturally or unnaturally [traditionally, ''unnaturally'' refers to anal and oral sex], provided that he does not expend semen to no purpose. Nevertheless, it is an attribute of piety that a man should not act in this matter with levity and that he should sanctify himself at the time of intercourse."<ref>{{cite book |title=Mishneh Torah |first=Moshe |last=Maimonides |page=Laws Concerning Forbidden Relations 21:9}}</ref>

====Christianity====
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}
In Christian countries,{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} anal sex is sometimes referred to euphemistically as the ''peccatum contra naturam'' (the sin against nature, after [[Thomas Aquinas]]) or ''Sodomitica luxuria'' (sodomitical lusts, in one of [[Charlemagne|Charlemagne's]] ordinances), or ''peccatum illud horribile, inter christianos non-nominandum'' (that horrible sin that among Christians is not to be named).

====Islam====
{{Main|Islamic views on anal sex}}
''Liwat'', or the sin of Lot's people, is officially prohibited by most Islamic sects. There are parts of the Qur'an which talk about smiting on [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], and this is thought to be a reference to unnatural sex, and so there are [[hadith]] and Islamic laws which prohibit it. Same sex male practitioners of anal relations are called ''luti'' or ''lutiyin'' in plural and are seen as criminals in the same way that a thief is a criminal, meaning that they are giving in to a universal temptation.

====Buddhism====
{{Further|Sexuality and Buddhism|LGBT topics and Buddhism}}
The most common formulation of Buddhist ethics is the [[The Five Precepts|Five Precepts]].  These precepts take the form of voluntary, personal  undertakings, not divine mandate or instruction. The third of the Precepts is "To refrain from committing [[sexual misconduct]]".<ref name=HIGG>{{cite web
