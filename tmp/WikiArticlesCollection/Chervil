'''Chervil''' ('''''Anthriscus cerefolium'''''), sometimes called '''garden chervil''' to distinguish it from similar plants also called chervil, or '''French parsley''', is a delicate [[annual plant|annual]] [[herb]] related to [[parsley]]. It is commonly used to season mild-flavoured dishes and is a constituent of the French herb mixture [[fines herbes]].

==Biology==
A member of the [[Apiaceae]], chervil is native to the [[Caucasus]] but was spread by the Romans through most of Europe, where it is now naturalised.<ref name="OBFP">{{cite book | last =Vaughan | first =J.G.   | authorlink = | coauthors = Geissler, C.A. | title =The New Oxford Book of Food Plants | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1997}}</ref>

The plants grow to {{convert|40|-|70|cm|abbr=on}}, with tripinnate leaves that may be curly. The small white flowers form small umbels, {{convert|2.54|-|5|cm|abbr=on}} across. The fruit is about 1&nbsp;cm long, oblong-ovoid with a slender, ridged beak.<ref name="OBFP"/>

Sometimes referred to as "gourmet's parsley", chervil is used to season [[poultry]], [[seafood]], and young [[vegetable]]s. It is particularly popular in France, where it is added to omelettes, salads, and soups. More delicate than parsley, it has a faint taste of [[liquorice]] or [[aniseed]].<ref name="S&S">{{cite book|title=Simon & Schuster's Guide to Herbs and Spices |editor=Stanley Schuler |isbn=0-671-73489-X |author=Gualtiero Simonetti |year=1990 |publisher=Simon & Schuster, Inc}}</ref>

===Horticulture===
Chervil is sometimes used to attract [[slug]]s.<ref>The Organic Gardener's Handbook of Natural Pest and Disease, Fern Marshall Bradley, Barbara W. Ellis, Deborah L. Martin, http://books.google.com/books?isbn=160529179X, Page 363 "Chervil is irresistible to slugs"</ref>

===Traditional===
Chervil has had various traditional uses. It was claimed to be useful as a [[digestion|digestive]] aid, for lowering [[high blood pressure]], and, infused with [[vinegar]], for curing [[hiccups]].<ref name="TBC">{{cite book | last =McGee | first =Rose Marie Nichols  | authorlink = | coauthors = Stuckey, Maggie | title =The Bountiful Container | publisher = Workman Publishing | year = 2002}}</ref> Besides its digestive properties, it is used as a mild stimulant.<ref name="S&S" />

== Toxicity ==
Chervil has also been implicated in "strimmer [[dermatitis]]", or [[phytophotodermatitis]], due to spray from weed trimmers and other forms of contact.  Other plants in the family ''[[Apiaceae]]'' can have similar effects.<ref>{{cite web|last=Drugge|first=Rhett|last2=Dunn|first2=Heather|title=Botanical Dermatology  Phytophotodermatitis|work=Electronic Textbook of Dermatology|publisher=The Internet Dermatology Society, Inc|url=http://telemedicine.org/botanica/bot5.htm|accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>
Precise identification before picking is very necessary due to its similar appearance to [[Conium|Hemlock]] (Conium), to which it is related. [[Conium|Hemlock]] is highly toxic and confusion between the two plants could cause death.

==Cultivation==
Chervil is best grown seeded in place, as transplanting can be difficult, due to the long [[taproot]].<ref name="TBC"/> It prefers a cool and moist location, otherwise it rapidly goes to seed (also known as [[bolting (horticulture)|bolting]]).<ref name="TBC"/> Regular harvesting of leaves also helps to prevent bolting.<ref name="TBC"/> If plants bolt despite precautions, the plant can be periodically re-sown throughout the growing season, thus producing fresh plants as older plants bolt and go out of production.

Chervil grows to a height of {{convert|12|to|24|in}}, and a width of {{convert|6|to|12|in}}.<ref name="TBC"/>
