'''Carbon''' (from {{lang-la|carbo}} "coal") is the [[chemical element]] with symbol '''C''' and [[atomic number]] 6. As a member of [[group 14]] on the [[periodic table]], it is [[nonmetal]]lic and [[tetravalence|tetravalent]]—making four [[electrons]] available to form [[covalent bond|covalent]] chemical bonds. There are three naturally occurring [[isotopes]], with [[Carbon-12|<sup>12</sup>C]] and [[Carbon-13|<sup>13</sup>C]] being stable, while [[Carbon-14|<sup>14</sup>C]] is [[radioactive]], decaying with a [[half-life]] of about 5,730&nbsp;years.<ref name="isotopes">{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/C/isot.html|title=Carbon&nbsp;– Naturally occurring isotopes|publisher=WebElements Periodic Table|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref> Carbon is one of the [[Discoveries of the chemical elements|few elements known since antiquity]].<ref name=D2>{{cite web|url=http://www.caer.uky.edu/carbon/history/carbonhistory.shtml|title=History of Carbon|accessdate=2013-01-10}}</ref>

There are several [[allotropes of carbon]] of which the best known are [[graphite]], [[diamond]], and [[amorphous carbon]].<ref name="therm prop">{{cite web|url=http://invsee.asu.edu/nmodules/Carbonmod/point.html|title=World of Carbon&nbsp;– Interactive Nano-visulisation in Science & Engineering Education (IN-VSEE)|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref> The [[physical properties]] of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, diamond is highly [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]], while graphite is [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and black. Diamond is the hardest naturally-occurring material known, while graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek word "γράφω" which means "to write"). Diamond has a very low [[electrical conductivity]], while graphite is a very good [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]. Under normal conditions, diamond, [[carbon nanotube]] and [[graphene]] have the highest [[thermal conductivity|thermal conductivities]] of [[List of thermal conductivities|all known materials]].

All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions with graphite being the most [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|thermodynamically stable]] form. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen. The most common [[oxidation state]] of carbon in [[inorganic compounds]] is +4, while +2 is found in [[carbon monoxide]] and other [[transition metal]] [[Metal carbonyl|carbonyl]] complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are [[limestone]]s, [[dolomite]]s and [[carbon dioxide]], but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of [[coal]], [[peat]], [[petroleum|oil]] and [[methane clathrate]]s. Carbon forms more [[chemical compound|compounds]] than any other element, with almost ten million pure [[organic compound]]s described to date, which in turn are a tiny fraction of such compounds that are theoretically possible under standard conditions.<ref name=lanl>{{cite web|author=Chemistry Operations|date=December 15, 2003|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html|title=Carbon|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=2008-10-09|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080913063402/http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html |archivedate=2008-09-13}}</ref>

Carbon is the 15th [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|most abundant]] element in the Earth's crust, and the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass]] after [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], and [[oxygen]]. It is present in all known life forms, and in the [[human body]] carbon is the second most abundant element by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/elbio.html|title=Biological Abundance of Elements|publisher=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref> This abundance, together with the unique diversity of [[organic compounds]] and their unusual [[polymer]]-forming ability at the temperatures commonly encountered on [[Earth]], make this element the chemical basis of all known life.

The different forms or ''[[allotropes]]'' of carbon (see below) include the hardest naturally occurring substance, [[diamond]], and also one of the softest known substances, [[graphite]]. Moreover, it has an affinity for [[chemical bond|bonding]] with other small [[atom]]s, including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming multiple stable [[covalent]] bonds with such atoms. As a result, carbon is known to form almost ten million different compounds; the large majority of all [[chemical compounds]].<ref name=lanl/> Carbon also has the highest [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] point of all elements. At [[atmospheric pressure]] it has no melting point as its [[triple point]] is at 10.8 ± 0.2&nbsp;MPa and 4,600 ± 300 K (~4,330 °C or 7,820 °F),<ref name=triple2/><ref name=triple3/> so it sublimes at about 3,900&nbsp;K.<ref name="triple">{{cite journal|journal=Nature|volume=276|pages=695–696|year=1978|doi=10.1038/276695a0|title=The controversial carbon solid−liquid−vapour triple point|first=A.|last=Greenville Whittaker|issue=5689|bibcode=1978Natur.276..695W }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://lbruno.home.cern.ch/lbruno/documents/Bibliography/LHC_Note_78.pdf|title=On Graphite Transformations at High Temperature and Pressure Induced by Absorption of the LHC Beam|first=J.

Carbon sublimes in a carbon arc which has a temperature of about 5,800 K (5,530 °C; 9,980 °F). Thus, irrespective of its allotropic form, carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than the highest melting point metals such as [[tungsten]] or [[rhenium]]. Although thermodynamically prone to [[Redox|oxidation]], carbon resists oxidation more effectively than elements such as [[iron]] and [[copper]] that are weaker reducing agents at room temperature.

Carbon compounds form the basis of all known life on [[Earth]], and the [[CNO cycle|carbon-nitrogen cycle]] provides some of the energy produced by the [[Sun]] and other [[stars]]. Although it forms an extraordinary variety of compounds, most forms of carbon are comparatively unreactive under normal conditions. At standard temperature and pressure, it resists all but the strongest oxidizers. It does not react with [[sulfuric acid]], [[hydrochloric acid]], [[chlorine]] or any [[Alkali metals|alkalis]]. At elevated temperatures carbon reacts with [[oxygen]] to form carbon oxides, and will reduce such metal [[oxides]] as iron oxide to the metal. This [[exothermic]] reaction is used in the iron and steel industry to control the carbon content of [[steel]]:

:{{chem|Fe|3|O|4}} + 4 C<sub>(s)</sub> → 3 Fe<sub>(s)</sub> + 4 CO<sub>(g)</sub>

with [[sulfur]] to form [[carbon disulfide]] and with steam in the coal-gas reaction:
:C<sub>(s)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub> → CO<sub>(g)</sub> + H<sub>2(g)</sub>.
Carbon combines with some metals at high temperatures to form metallic carbides, such as the iron carbide [[cementite]] in steel, and [[tungsten carbide]], widely used as an [[abrasive]] and for making hard tips for cutting tools.

As of 2009, [[graphene]] appears to be the strongest material ever tested.<ref name=lee>{{cite journal|first=C.|last=Lee|title=Measurement of the Elastic Properties and Intrinsic Strength of Monolayer Graphene|journal=Science|volume=321|year=2008|laysummary=http://web.archive.org/web/20090531134104/http://www.aip.org/isns/reports/2008/027.html|pmid=18635798|doi=10.1126/science.1157996|last2=Wei|first2=X.|last3=Kysar|first3=J.

===Allotropes===
{{main|Allotropes of carbon}}
[[Atomic carbon]] is a very short-lived species and, therefore, carbon is stabilized in various multi-atomic structures with different molecular configurations called [[allotropes]]. The three relatively well-known allotropes of carbon are [[amorphous carbon]], [[graphite]], and [[diamond]]. Once considered exotic, [[fullerene]]s are nowadays commonly synthesized and used in research; they include [[buckyball]]s,<ref name="buckyballs"/><ref name="nanotubes">{{cite book|editor=Ebbesen, T.

The [[amorphous]] form is an assortment of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline, irregular, glassy state, which is essentially [[graphite]] but not held in a crystalline macrostructure. It is present as a powder, and is the main constituent of substances such as [[charcoal]], [[lampblack]] ([[soot]]) and [[activated carbon]]. At normal pressures carbon takes the form of [[graphite]], in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused [[hexagon]]al rings, just like those in [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title=The polymorphism of elements and compounds|last=Jenkins|first=Edgar|year=1973|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=0-423-87500-0|page=30|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XNYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA30|accessdate=2011-05-01}}</ref> The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak [[van der Waals force]]s.<!-- no evidence for upper case van der Waals; see [[Talk:Van der Waals#Van should be capitalized unless preceded by first name]] rebuttal --> This gives graphite its softness and its [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleaving]] properties (the sheets slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a [[Delocalized electron|π-cloud]], graphite conducts [[electricity]], but only in the plane of each [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] sheet. This results in a lower bulk [[electrical conductivity]] for carbon than for most [[metals]]. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature.
[[File:Eight Allotropes of Carbon.png|thumb|300px|Some allotropes of carbon: a) [[diamond]]; b) [[graphite]]; c) [[lonsdaleite]]; d–f) [[fullerene]]s (C<sub>60</sub>, C<sub>540</sub>, C<sub>70</sub>); g) [[amorphous carbon]]; h) [[carbon nanotube]].]]

At very high pressures carbon forms the more compact allotrope [[diamond]], having nearly twice the density of graphite. Here, each atom is bonded [[tetrahedron|tetrahedrally]] to four others, thus making a 3-dimensional network of puckered six-membered rings of atoms. Diamond has the same [[cubic crystal system|cubic structure]] as [[silicon]] and [[germanium]] and because of the strength of the carbon-carbon [[chemical bond|bonds]], it is the hardest naturally occurring substance [[Mohs scale|in terms of resistance to scratching]]. Contrary to the popular belief that ''"[[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|diamonds are forever]]"'', they are in fact thermodynamically unstable under normal conditions and transform into [[graphite]].<ref name="therm prop"/> However, due to a high activation energy barrier, the transition into graphite is so extremely slow at room temperature as to be unnoticeable. Under some conditions, carbon crystallizes as [[lonsdaleite]]. This form has a [[hexagonal]] [[crystal]] lattice where all atoms are covalently bonded. Therefore, all properties of lonsdaleite are close to those of diamond.<ref name="lonsdaletite"/>

[[Fullerene]]s have a graphite-like structure, but instead of purely [[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] packing, they also contain pentagons (or even heptagons) of carbon atoms, which bend the sheet into spheres, ellipses or cylinders. The properties of fullerenes (split into [[buckyball]]s, [[carbon nanotube|buckytubes]] and [[nanobud]]s) have not yet been fully analyzed and represent an intense area of research in [[nanomaterials]]. The names ''"fullerene"'' and ''"buckyball"'' are given after [[Buckminster Fuller|Richard Buckminster Fuller]], popularizer of [[geodesic dome]]s, which resemble the structure of fullerenes. The buckyballs are fairly large molecules formed completely of carbon bonded trigonally, forming [[spheroid]]s (the best-known and simplest is the soccerball-shaped C<sub>60</sub> [[buckminsterfullerene]]).<ref name="buckyballs"/> Carbon nanotubes are structurally similar to buckyballs, except that each atom is bonded trigonally in a curved sheet that forms a hollow [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]].<ref name="nanotubes"/><ref name="nanotubes2"/> Nanobuds were first reported in 2007 and are hybrid bucky tube/buckyball materials (buckyballs are covalently bonded to the outer wall of a nanotube) that combine the properties of both in a single structure.<ref name="nanobuds"/>

Of the other discovered allotropes, [[carbon nanofoam]] is a [[ferromagnetic]] allotrope discovered in 1997. It consists of a low-density cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web, in which the atoms are bonded trigonally in six- and seven-membered rings. It is among the lightest known solids, with a density of about 2&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.aip.org/pnu/2004/split/678-1.html|title=Carbon Nanofoam is the World's First Pure Carbon Magnet|volume=678|issue=1|date=March 26, 2004|author=Schewe, Phil and Stein, Ben|journal=Physics News Update}}</ref> Similarly, [[glassy carbon]] contains a high proportion of closed [[porosity]],<ref name="glassy carbon"/> but contrary to normal graphite, the graphitic layers are not stacked like pages in a book, but have a more random arrangement. [[Linear acetylenic carbon]]<ref name=LAC/> has the chemical structure<ref name="LAC"/> -(C:::C)<sub>n</sub>-. Carbon in this modification is linear with ''sp'' [[orbital hybridization]], and is a [[polymer]] with alternating single and triple bonds.

Carbon is the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant chemical element]] in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon is abundant in the [[Sun]], [[star]]s, [[comet]]s, and in the [[celestial body's atmosphere|atmospheres]] of most [[planet]]s. Some [[meteorite]]s contain microscopic diamonds that were formed when the [[solar system]] was still a [[protoplanetary disk]]. Microscopic diamonds may also be formed by the intense pressure and high temperature at the sites of meteorite impacts.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mark, Kathleen|year=1987|title=Meteorite Craters|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=0-8165-0902-6}}</ref>

In combination with [[oxygen]] in [[carbon dioxide]], carbon is found in the Earth's atmosphere (approximately 810&nbsp;[[gigatonne]]s of carbon) and dissolved in all water bodies (approximately 36,000&nbsp;gigatonnes of carbon). Around 1,900&nbsp;gigatonnes of carbon are present in the [[biosphere]]. [[Hydrocarbons]] (such as [[coal]], [[petroleum]], and [[natural gas]]) contain carbon as well—[[coal]] [[Mineral resource classification|"reserves" (not "resources")]] amount to around 900&nbsp;gigatonnes, and [[oil reserves]] around 150&nbsp;gigatonnes. Proven sources of natural gas are about 175&nbsp;10<sup>12</sup> cubic metres (representing about 105 gigatonnes carbon), but it is estimated that there are also about 900&nbsp;10<sup>12</sup> cubic metres of "unconventional" gas such as [[shale gas]], representing about 540 gigatonnes of carbon.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20627641.100-wonderfuel-welcome-to-the-age-of-unconventional-gas.html?full=true "Wonderfuel: Welcome to the age of unconventional gas"] by Helen Knight, ''[[New Scientist]]'', 12 June 2010, pp. 44–7.</ref>
Carbon is also locked up as [[methane hydrates]] in polar regions and under the seas. Various estimates of the amount of carbon this represents have been made: 500 to 2500 [[gigatonne|Gt]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3493349.stm Ocean methane stocks 'overstated'], BBC, 17 Feb. 2004.</ref> or 3000 Gt.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227141.100 "Ice on fire: The next fossil fuel"] by [[Fred Pearce]], ''New Scientist'', 27 June 2009, pp. 30-33.</ref>
In the past, quantities of hydrocarbons were greater. According to one source, in the period from 1751 to 2008 about 347 gigatonnes of carbon were released as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels.<ref>Calculated from file global.1751_2008.csv in [http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp030/CSV-FILES] from the [[Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center]].</ref> However, another source puts the amount added to the atmosphere for the period since 1750 at 879 Gt, and the total going to the atmosphere, sea, and land (such as [[peat bogs]]) at almost 2000 Gt.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Deep, and dank mysterious|journal=New Scientist|date=Sept. 21, 2013|pages=40-43|url=http://www.newscientist.com/articleimages/mg21929350.800/1-whats-brown-and-soggy-and-could-save-the-world.html|author=Rachel Gross}}</ref>

Carbon is a major component in very large masses of [[carbonate]] rock ([[limestone]], [[dolomite]], [[marble]] and so on). [[Coal]] is the largest commercial source of mineral carbon, accounting for 4,000&nbsp;gigatonnes or 80% of fossil carbon fuel.<ref>{{cite journal|first=James|last=Kasting|year=1998|title=The Carbon Cycle, Climate, and the Long-Term Effects of Fossil Fuel Burning|journal=Consequences: the Nature and Implication of Environmental Change|volume=4|url=http://gcrio.org/CONSEQUENCES/vol4no1/carbcycle.html|issue=1}}</ref> It is also rich in carbon – for example, [[anthracite]] contains 92–98%.<ref>{{cite book|title=Coal Mining Technology: Theory and Practice|author=Stefanenko,  R.|publisher=Society for Mining Metallurgy|year=1983|isbn=0-89520-404-5}}</ref>

As for individual carbon allotropes, graphite is found in large quantities in the [[United States]] (mostly in [[New York]] and [[Texas]]), [[Russia]], [[Mexico]], [[Greenland]], and [[India]]. Natural diamonds occur in the rock [[kimberlite]], found in ancient [[volcano|volcanic]] "necks", or "pipes". Most diamond deposits are in [[Africa]], notably in [[South Africa]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. There are also deposits in [[Arkansas]], [[Canada]], the Russian [[Arctic]], [[Brazil]] and in Northern and Western [[Australia]]. Diamonds are now also being recovered from the ocean floor off the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. However, though diamonds are found naturally, about 30% of all industrial diamonds used in the U.S. are now made synthetically.

Carbon-14 is formed in upper layers of the troposphere and the stratosphere, at altitudes of 9–15&nbsp;km, by a reaction that is precipitated by [[cosmic ray]]s.<ref>[http://www.acad.carleton.edu/curricular/BIOL/classes/bio302/pages/carbondatingback.html Carbon-14 formation]</ref> [[Thermal neutron]]s are produced that collide with the nuclei of nitrogen-14, forming carbon-14 and a proton.

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of carbon}}
[[Isotope]]s of carbon are [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] that contain six [[proton]]s plus a number of [[neutron]]s (varying from 2 to 16). Carbon has two stable, naturally occurring [[isotope]]s.<ref name="isotopes"/> The isotope [[carbon-12]] (<sup>12</sup>C) forms 98.93% of the carbon on Earth, while [[carbon-13]] (<sup>13</sup>C) forms the remaining 1.07%.<ref name="isotopes"/> The concentration of <sup>12</sup>C is further increased in biological materials because biochemical reactions discriminate against <sup>13</sup>C.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gannes|first=Leonard Z.|last2=Del Rio|first2=Carlos Martı́nez|last3=Koch|first3=Paul|title=Natural Abundance Variations in Stable Isotopes and their Potential Uses in Animal Physiological Ecology|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology&nbsp;– Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology|volume=119|issue=3|pages=725–737|year=1998|doi=10.1016/S1095-6433(98)01016-2}}</ref> In 1961, the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) adopted the isotope [[carbon-12]] as the basis for [[atomic weight]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/base_units/|title=Official SI Unit definitions|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> Identification of carbon in [[NMR]] experiments is done with the isotope <sup>13</sup>C.

[[Carbon-14]] (<sup>14</sup>C) is a naturally occurring [[radioisotope]] which occurs in trace amounts on Earth of up to 1 part per [[10^12|trillion]] (0.0000000001%), mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits, particularly of [[peat]] and other organic materials.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Tom|date=March 1, 2006|url=http://www.llnl.gov/str/March06/Brown.html|title=Carbon Goes Full Circle in the Amazon|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref> This isotope decays by 0.158 MeV [[beta decay|β<sup>−</sup> emission]].

===Formation in stars===
{{main|Triple-alpha process|CNO cycle}}
Formation of the carbon atomic nucleus requires a nearly simultaneous triple collision of [[alpha particle]]s ([[helium]] nuclei) within the core of a [[giant star|giant]] or [[supergiant]] star which is known as the [[triple-alpha process]], as the products of further nuclear fusion reactions of helium with hydrogen or another helium nucleus produce [[isotopes of lithium|lithium-5]] and [[isotopes of beryllium|beryllium-8]] respectively, both of which are highly unstable and decay almost instantly back into smaller nuclei.<ref name="Audi">{{cite journal|last1=Audi|first1=G|doi=10.1016/S0375-9474(97)00482-X|title=The Nubase evaluation of nuclear and decay properties|year=1997|page=1|volume=624|journal=Nuclear Physics A|url=http://amdc.in2p3.fr/nubase/nubase97.pdf|bibcode=1997NuPhA.624....1A|last2=Bersillon|first2=O.|last3=Blachot|first3=J.|last4=Wapstra|first4=A.H.}}</ref> This happens in conditions of temperatures over 100 megakelvin and helium concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe prohibited, and therefore no significant carbon was created during the [[Big Bang]].

===Carbon cycle===
{{main|Carbon cycle}}
[[File:Carbon cycle-cute diagram.svg|thumb|300px||Diagram of the carbon cycle. The black numbers indicate how much carbon is stored in various reservoirs, in billions tonnes ("GtC" stands for gigatonnes of carbon; figures are circa 2004). The purple numbers indicate how much carbon moves between reservoirs each year. The sediments, as defined in this diagram, do not include the ~70&nbsp;million GtC of carbonate rock and [[kerogen]].]]
Under terrestrial conditions, conversion of one element to another is very rare. Therefore, the amount of carbon on Earth is effectively constant. Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it somewhere and dispose of it somewhere else. The paths that carbon follows in the environment make up the [[carbon cycle]]. For example, plants draw [[carbon dioxide]] out of their environment and use it to build biomass, as in [[carbon respiration]] or the [[Calvin cycle]], a process of [[carbon fixation]]. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, whereas some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; dead plant or animal matter may become [[petroleum]] or [[coal]], which can burn with the release of carbon, should bacteria not consume it.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Science|year=2000|volume=290|issue=5490|pages=291–296|doi=10.1126/science.290.5490.291|title=The Global Carbon Cycle: A Test of Our Knowledge of Earth as a System|pmid=11030643|last1=Falkowski|first1=P|last2=Scholes|first2=RJ|last3=Boyle|first3=E |last4=Canadell|first4=J|last5=Canfield|first5=D|last6=Elser|first6=J|last7=Gruber|first7=N |last8=Hibbard|first8=K|last9=Högberg|first9=P|bibcode=2000Sci...290..291F|display-authors=8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01104986|title=The global terrestrial carbon cycle|year=1993|last1=Smith|first1=T.

==Compounds==
{{main|Compounds of carbon}}

===Organic compounds===
[[File:Methane-2D-stereo.svg|thumb|left|150px|Structural formula of [[methane]], the simplest possible organic compound.]]
[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.png|thumb|300px|Correlation between the ''carbon cycle'' and formation of organic compounds. In plants, carbon dioxide formed by carbon fixation can join with water in [[photosynthesis]] (<span style="color:green;">green</span>) to form organic compounds, which can be used and further converted by both plants and animals.]]
Carbon has the ability to form very long chains of interconnecting C-C bonds. This property is called [[catenation]]. Carbon-carbon bonds are strong, and stable. This property allows carbon to form an almost infinite number of compounds; in fact, there are more known carbon-containing compounds than all the compounds of the other chemical elements combined except those of hydrogen (because almost all organic compounds contain hydrogen as well).

The simplest form of an organic molecule is the [[hydrocarbon]]—a large family of [[organic molecule]]s that are composed of [[hydrogen]] atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms. Chain length, side chains and [[functional group]]s all affect the properties of organic molecules.

Carbon occurs in all known [[organic material|organic]] life and is the basis of [[organic chemistry]]. When united with [[hydrogen]], it forms various [[hydrocarbon]]s which are important to industry as [[refrigerants]], [[lubricants]], [[solvents]], as chemical feedstock for the manufacture of [[plastic]]s and [[petrochemicals]] and as [[fossil fuel]]s.

When combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including [[sugar]]s, [[lignan]]s, [[chitin]]s, [[alcohol]]s, [[fat]]s, and aromatic [[ester]]s, [[carotenoids]] and [[terpenes]]. With [[nitrogen]] it forms [[alkaloid]]s, and with the addition of sulfur also it forms [[antibiotic]]s, [[amino acid]]s, and [[rubber]] products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], the chemical-code carriers of life, and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells.

===Inorganic compounds===
Commonly carbon-containing compounds which are associated with minerals or which do not contain hydrogen or fluorine, are treated separately from classical [[organic compounds]]; however the definition is not rigid (see reference articles above). Among these are the simple oxides of carbon. The most prominent oxide is [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}). This was once the principal constituent of the [[paleoatmosphere]], but is a minor component of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] today.<ref>{{cite journal|year=1982|title=The prebiological paleoatmosphere: stability and composition|journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres|volume=12|pages=245–259|doi=10.1007/BF00926894|issue=3|bibcode=1982OrLi...12..245L|last1=Levine|first1=Joel S.|last2=Augustsson|first2=Tommy R.|last3=Natarajan|first3=Murali}}</ref> Dissolved in [[water (molecule)|water]], it forms [[carbonic acid]] ({{chem|H|2|C||O|3}}), but as most compounds with multiple single-bonded oxygens on a single carbon it is unstable.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Loerting, T.|year=2001|title=On the Surprising Kinetic Stability of Carbonic Acid|journal=Angew.

Some important minerals are carbonates, notably [[calcite]]. [[Carbon disulfide]] ({{chem|C||S|2}}) is similar.

The other common oxide is [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). It is formed by incomplete combustion, and is a colorless, odorless gas. The molecules each contain a triple bond and are fairly [[polar molecule|polar]], resulting in a tendency to bind permanently to hemoglobin molecules, displacing oxygen, which has a lower binding affinity.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Haldane J.|year=1895|title=The action of carbonic oxide on man|journal=Journal of Physiology|volume=18|pages=430–462|pmid=16992272|issue=5–6|pmc=1514663}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|year=2003|title=The clinical toxicology of carbon monoxide|journal=Toxicology|issue=1|pages=25–38|doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(03)00005-2|last1=Gorman|first1=D.|volume=187|pmid=12679050|last2=Drewry|first2=A.|last3=Huang|first3=Y.

A few carbides are covalent lattices, like [[Silicon carbide|carborundum]] (SiC), which resembles [[diamond]].

===Organometallic compounds===
{{main|Organometallic chemistry}}
Organometallic compounds by definition contain at least one carbon-metal bond. A wide range of such compounds exist; major classes include simple alkyl-metal compounds (for example, [[tetraethyllead]]), η<sup>2</sup>-alkene compounds (for example, [[Zeise's salt]]), and η<sup>3</sup>-allyl compounds (for example, [[allylpalladium chloride dimer]]); [[metallocene]]s containing cyclopentadienyl ligands (for example, [[ferrocene]]); and [[transition metal carbene complex]]es. Many [[metal carbonyl]]s exist (for example, [[tetracarbonylnickel]]); some workers consider the [[carbon monoxide]] ligand to be purely inorganic, and not organometallic.

While carbon is understood to exclusively form four bonds, an interesting compound containing an octahedral hexacoordinated carbon atom has been reported. The cation of the compound is [(Ph<sub>3</sub>PAu)<sub>6</sub>C]<sup>2+</sup>. This phenomenon has been attributed to the [[aurophilicity]] of the gold ligands.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/anie.198815441|author=Scherbaum, Franz|journal=[[Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

==History and etymology==
[[File:Antoine lavoisier.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] in his youth]]
The [[English language|English]] name ''carbon'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''carbo'' for coal and charcoal,<ref>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford University Press</ref> whence also comes the [[French language|French]] ''charbon'', meaning charcoal. In [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], the names for carbon are ''Kohlenstoff'', ''koolstof'' and ''kulstof'' respectively, all literally meaning [[coal]]-substance.

Carbon was discovered in prehistory and was known in the forms of [[soot]] and [[charcoal]] to the earliest [[human]] [[civilization]]s. Diamonds were known probably as early as 2500&nbsp;BCE in China, while carbon in the form of [[charcoal]] was made around Roman times by the same chemistry as it is today, by heating wood in a [[pyramid]] covered with [[clay]] to exclude air.<ref name=ancient_China>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4555235.stm|title=Chinese made first use of diamond|publisher=BBC News|date=17 May 2005|accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=C|title=Carbonium/Carbon at Elementymology & Elements Multidict|author=van der Krogt, Peter|accessdate=2010-01-06}}</ref>

==Production==

===Graphite===
{{main|Graphite}}
Commercially viable natural deposits of graphite occur in many parts of the world, but the most important sources economically are in [[China]], [[India]], [[Brazil]] and [[North Korea]]. Graphite deposits are of [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] origin, found in association with [[quartz]], [[mica]] and [[feldspar]]s in schists, [[gneiss]]es and metamorphosed [[sandstone]]s and [[limestone]] as [[lens (geology)|lenses]] or [[vein (geology)|veins]], sometimes of a meter or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in [[Borrowdale]], [[Cumberland]], [[England]] were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, [[pencil]]s were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller deposits of graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water.<ref name=USGS>[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/graphite USGS Minerals Yearbook: Graphite, 2009] and Graphite: Mineral Commodity Summaries 2011</ref>

There are three types of natural graphite—amorphous, flake or crystalline flake, and vein or lump. Amorphous graphite is the lowest quality and most abundant. Contrary to science, in industry "amorphous" refers to very small crystal size rather than complete lack of crystal structure. Amorphous is used for lower value graphite products and is the lowest priced graphite. Large amorphous graphite deposits are found in China, Europe, Mexico and the United States.
Flake graphite is less common and of higher quality than amorphous; it occurs as separate plates  that crystallized in metamorphic rock. Flake graphite can be four times the price of amorphous. Good quality flakes can be processed into expandable graphite for many uses, such as [[flame retardant]]s. The foremost deposits are found in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany and Madagascar. Vein or lump graphite is the rarest, most valuable, and highest quality type of natural graphite. It occurs in veins along intrusive contacts in solid lumps, and it is only commercially mined in Sri Lanka.<ref name=USGS/>

According to the [[USGS]], world production of natural graphite was 1.1&nbsp;million tonnes in 2010, to which China contributed 800,000&nbsp;t, India 130,000 t, Brazil 76,000&nbsp;t, North Korea 30,000&nbsp;t and Canada 25,000 t. No natural graphite was reported mined in the United States, but 118,000 t of synthetic graphite with an estimated value of $998&nbsp;million was produced in 2009.<ref name=USGS/>

===Diamond===
{{main|Diamond}}
[[File:Global Diamond Output in 2005.png|thumb|right|Diamond output in 2005]]

The diamond supply chain is controlled by a limited number of powerful businesses, and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around the world (see figure).

Only a very small fraction of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care has to be taken in order to prevent larger diamonds from being destroyed in this process and subsequently the particles are sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of [[X-ray fluorescence]], after which the final sorting steps are done by hand.

Diamond production of primary deposits (kimberlites and lamproites) only started in the 1870s after the discovery of the Diamond fields in South Africa. Production has increased over time and now an accumulated total of 4.5&nbsp;billion carats have been mined since that date.<ref name=giasummer2007>{{cite journal|last=Janse|first=A. J.

Carbon is essential to all known living systems, and without it life as we know it could not exist (see [[alternative biochemistry]]). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the [[fossil fuel]] [[methane]] gas and [[crude oil]] (petroleum). Crude oil is used by the [[petrochemical industry]] to produce, amongst other things, [[gasoline]] and [[kerosene]], through a [[distillation]] process, in [[refinery|refineries]]. [[Cellulose]] is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of [[cotton]], [[linen]], and [[hemp]]. [[Cellulose]] is mainly used for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include [[wool]], [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]] and [[silk]]. [[Plastics]] are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.

The uses of carbon and its compounds are extremely varied. It can form [[alloys]] with [[iron]], of which the most common is [[carbon steel]]. [[Graphite]] is combined with [[clay]]s to form the 'lead' used in [[pencil]]s used for [[writing]] and [[drawing]]. It is also used as a [[lubricant]] and a [[pigment]], as a molding material in [[glass]] manufacture, in [[electrodes]] for dry [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and in [[electroplating]] and [[electroforming]], in [[brush (electric)|brushes]] for [[electric motors]] and as a [[neutron moderator]] in [[nuclear reactors]].

[[Charcoal]] is used as a drawing material in [[art]]work, for [[grilling]], and in many other uses including iron smelting. Wood, coal and oil are used as [[fuel]] for production of energy and space heating. Gem quality [[diamond]] is used in jewelry, and [[industrial diamond]]s are used in drilling, cutting and polishing tools for machining metals and stone. Plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons, and [[carbon fiber]], made by [[pyrolysis]] of synthetic [[polyester]] [[fiber]]s is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced, lightweight [[composite materials]]. [[Carbon fiber]] is made by pyrolysis of extruded and stretched filaments of [[polyacrylonitrile]] (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend on the type of starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher [[specific strength|specific tensile strength]] than steel.<ref name=cantwell>{{cite journal|first1=W. J.|last1=Cantwell|first2=J.|last2=Morton|title=The impact resistance of composite materials&nbsp;– a review|journal=Composites|year=1991|volume=22|issue=5|pages=347–62|doi=10.1016/0010-4361(91)90549-V}}</ref>

[[Carbon black]] is used as the black [[pigment]] in [[printing]] [[ink]], artist's oil paint and water colours, [[carbon paper]], automotive finishes, [[India ink]] and [[laser printer]] [[toner]]. [[Carbon black]] is also used as a [[Filler (materials)|filler]] in [[rubber]] products such as tyres and in [[plastic]] compounds. [[Activated charcoal]] is used as an [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] and [[adsorbent]] in [[Filter (chemistry)|filter]] material in applications as diverse as [[gas masks]], [[water purification]] and [[kitchen]] [[extractor hood]]s and in medicine to [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorb]] toxins, poisons, or gases from the [[gastrointestinal tract|digestive system]]. Carbon is used in [[Redox|chemical reduction]] at high temperatures. [[Coke (fuel)|Coke]] is used to reduce iron ore into iron. [[Case hardening]] of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. [[Carbide]]s of [[silicon carbide|silicon]], [[tungsten carbide|tungsten]], [[boron carbide|boron]] and [[titanium carbide|titanium]], are among the hardest known materials, and are used as [[abrasives]] in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make up most of the materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic [[textiles]] and [[leather]], and almost all of the interior surfaces in the [[built environment]] other than glass, stone and metal.

===Diamonds===
The [[diamond]] industry can be broadly separated into two basically distinct categories: one dealing with gem-grade diamonds and another for industrial-grade diamonds. While a large trade in both types of diamonds exists, the two markets act in dramatically different ways.

A large trade in [[Gemstone|gem]]-grade diamonds exists. Unlike [[precious metal]]s such as [[gold]] or [[platinum]], gem diamonds do not trade as a [[commodity]]: there is a substantial mark-up in the sale of diamonds, and there is not a very active market for resale of diamonds.

The market for industrial-grade diamonds operates much differently from its gem-grade counterpart. Industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, making many of the gemological characteristics of diamond, including clarity and color, mostly irrelevant. This helps explain why 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20&nbsp;tonnes annually), unsuitable for use as gemstones and known as ''[[bort]]'', are destined for industrial use.<ref>{{cite book|title=Turning And Mechanical Manipulation|first=Ch.|last=Holtzapffel|publisher=Charles Holtzapffel|year=1856|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=omwPAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover}} [http://www.archive.org/details/turningmechanica02holtuoft Internet Archive]</ref> In addition to mined diamonds, [[synthetic diamond]]s found industrial applications almost immediately after their invention in the 1950s; another 3&nbsp;billion carats (600&nbsp;[[tonne]]s) of synthetic diamond is produced annually for industrial use.<ref name=usgs>{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/diamond/|accessdate=2009-05-05|title=Industrial Diamonds Statistics and Information|publisher=United States Geological Survey}}</ref> The dominant industrial use of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing. Most uses of diamonds in these technologies do not require large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds that are gem-quality except for their small size, can find an industrial use. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications.<ref>{{cite journal|first=R. T.|last=Coelho|title=The application of polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tool materials when drilling and reaming aluminum-based alloys including MMC|doi=10.1016/0890-6955(95)93044-7|journal=International journal of machine tools & manufacture|volume=35|year=1995|page=761|issue=5|last2=Yamada|first2=S.|last3=Aspinwall|first3=D.K.|last4=Wise|first4=M.L.H.}}</ref> Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for [[Pressure experiment|high pressure experiments]] (see [[diamond anvil cell]]), high-performance [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], and limited use in specialized [[window]]s.<ref>{{cite book|pages=303–334|title=Materials for infrared windows and domes: properties and performance|first=D.

S.|last=Nusinovich|title=Introduction to the physics of gyrotrons|publisher=JHU Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8018-7921-3|page=229}}</ref> With the continuing advances being made in the production of synthetic diamonds, future applications are beginning to become feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a [[semiconductor]] suitable to build [[integrated circuit|microchips]] from, or the use of diamond as a [[heat sink]] in [[electronics]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=120 W CW output power from monolithic AlGaAs (800 nm) laser diode array mounted on diamond heatsink|first1=M.|last1=Sakamoto|first2=J.

==Precautions==
[[File:Worker at carbon black plant2.jpg|thumb|upright|Worker at [[carbon black]] plant in [[Sunray, Texas]] (photo by [[John Vachon]], 1942)]]Pure carbon has extremely low [[toxicity]] to humans and can be handled and even ingested safely in the form of graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract, for example. Consequently once it enters into the body's tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely. [[Carbon black]] was probably one of the first pigments to be used for [[tattoo]]ing, and [[Ötzi the Iceman]] was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200&nbsp;years after his death.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Leopold|last=Dorfer|year=1998|title=5200-year old acupuncture in Central Europe?|journal=Science|volume=282|pages=242–243|doi=10.1126/science.282.5387.239f|pmid=9841386|last2=Moser|first2=M|last3=Spindler|first3=K|last4=Bahr|first4=F|last5=Egarter-Vigl|first5=E|last6=Dohr|first6=G|issue=5387|bibcode=1998Sci...282..239D }}</ref> However, inhalation of coal dust or soot ([[carbon black]]) in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive [[human lung|lung]] disease [[coalworker's pneumoconiosis]]. Similarly, diamond dust used as an abrasive can do harm if ingested or inhaled. Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Donaldson|first=K|year=2001|title=Ultrafine particles|journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume=58|pages=211–216|url=http://oem.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/58/3/211|doi=10.1136/oem.58.3.211|pmid=11171936|last2=Stone|first2=V|last3=Clouter|first3=A|last4=Renwick|first4=L|last5=MacNee|first5=W|issue=3|pmc=1740105}}</ref> In these examples, the harmful effects may result from contamination of the carbon particles, with organic chemicals or heavy metals for example, rather than from the carbon itself.

Carbon generally has low toxicity to almost all [[life on Earth]]; however, to some creatures it can still be toxic. For instance, carbon nanoparticles are deadly to ''[[Drosophila]]''.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/08/090807103921.htm Carbon Nanoparticles Toxic To Adult Fruit Flies But Benign To Young] ScienceDaily (Aug. 17, 2009)</ref>

Carbon may also burn vigorously and brightly in the presence of air at high temperatures, as in the [[Windscale fire]], which was caused by sudden release of stored [[Wigner energy]] in the graphite core. Large accumulations of coal, which have remained inert for hundreds of millions of years in the absence of oxygen, may [[spontaneous combustion|spontaneously combust]] when exposed to air, for example in coal mine waste tips.

The great variety of carbon compounds include such lethal poisons as [[tetrodotoxin]], the [[lectin]] [[ricin]] from seeds of the [[castor oil plant]] ''[[Ricinus communis]]'', [[cyanide]] (CN<sup>−</sup>) and [[Carbon monoxide poisoning|carbon monoxide]]; and such essentials to life as [[glucose]] and [[protein]].
