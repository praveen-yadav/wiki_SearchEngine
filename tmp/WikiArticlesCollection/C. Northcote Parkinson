'''Cyril Northcote Parkinson''' (30 July 1909 – 9 March 1993) was a British naval historian and author of some sixty books, the most famous of which was his bestseller ''[[Parkinson's Law]]'', which led him  to be also considered as an important [[scholar]] within the field of [[public administration]].

==Early life and education==

The youngest son of William Edward Parkinson (1871–1927), an art master at North East County School and from 1913 principal of York School of Arts and Crafts, and his wife, Rose Emily Mary Curnow (born 1877),  the young Parkinson attended [[St. Peter's School, York]], where in 1929 he won an Exhibition to study history at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].  He received a BA degree in 1932.  As an undergraduate, Parkinson developed an interest in [[naval history]], which he pursued when the Pellew family gave him access to family papers at the recently established [[National Maritime Museum]].  The papers formed the basis of his first book, ''[[Edward Pellew]], Viscount Exmouth, Admiral of the Red''.  In 1934, then enrolled as a graduate student at [[King's College London]], he wrote his Ph.D. thesis on ''Trade and War in the Eastern Seas, 1803–1810'', which was awarded the [[Julian Corbett Prize in Naval History]] for 1935.

==Academic and military career==

While still a graduate student in 1934, Parkinson was commissioned into the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] as a member of the 22nd London Regiment (The Queen's), was promoted [[Lieutenant]] later the same year, and commanded an infantry company at the jubilee of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] in 1935. In the same year, [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] elected him a research fellow. While at Cambridge, he commanded an infantry unit of the Cambridge University Officers' Training Corps. He was promoted [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] in 1937.

From 1938 to 1945, he held a succession of positions, first becoming senior history master at [[Blundell's School]] in [[Tiverton, Devon]] in 1938 (and also a Captain in the school's OTC), then instructor at the [[Royal Naval College, Dartmouth]] in 1939. In 1940, he joined the [[Queen's Royal Regiment]] as a Captain and undertook a range of staff and military teaching positions in Britain. In 1943 he married Ethelwyn Edith Graves (born 1915), a nurse tutor at Middlesex Hospital, with whom he was to have two children. 

Demobilized as a [[Major]] in 1945, he was appointed lecturer in history at the [[University of Liverpool]] from 1946 to 1949. In 1950, he was appointed Raffles Professor of History at the newly established [[University of Malaya]] in [[Singapore]]. While there, he initiated an important series of historical monographs on the history of [[Peninsular Malaysia|Malaya]], publishing the very first of the series in 1960. A movement developed in the mid-1950s to establish two campuses, one in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and one in [[Singapore]]. Parkinson actively attempted to persuade the authorities to avoid dividing the university, but to maintain it to serve both Singapore and Malaya in [[Johor Bahru]]. His efforts were unsuccessful and the two campuses were established in 1959. The original Singapore campus, where Parkinson taught, later became the [[University of Singapore]].

Parkinson and his wife divorced in 1952 and he married the writer and journalist Ann Fry (1921–1983), with whom he had two sons and a daughter. In 1958, while still in Singapore, Parkinson published his most famous work ''[[Parkinson's Law]]'', a book that expanded upon a humorous article that he had first published in the ''Economist'' magazine in November 1955, satirizing government bureaucracies. The 120-page book, first published in the United States and then in Britain, was illustrated by [[Osbert Lancaster]] and became an instant best seller. This collection of short studies explained the inevitability of bureaucratic expansion, arguing that 'work expands to fill the time available for its completion'. Typical of his satire and cynical humour, the book included a discourse on [[Parkinson's Law of Triviality]] (debates about expenses for a nuclear plant, a bicycle shed, and refreshments), a note on why [[driving on the left]] side of the road (see [[road transport]]) is natural, and suggested that the [[Royal Navy]] would eventually have more admirals than ships. After serving as visiting professor at [[Harvard University]] in 1958, and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1959–60, he resigned his post in Singapore at the [[University of Malaya]] to become an independent writer and celebrity. To avoid high taxation in Britain, he moved to the [[Channel Islands]] and settled at [[St Martin's, Guernsey]], where he purchased Les Caches Hall and later restored Annesville Manor. His writings from this period included a series of historical novels, featuring a fictional naval officer from [[Guernsey]], [[Richard Delancey (fictional character)|Richard Delancey]], during the [[Napoleonic era]].

In 1969 he was invited to deliver the  [http://www.iesis.org/macmillan.html MacMillan Memorial Lecture] to the [[Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland]]. He chose the subject 'The Status of the Engineer'.

After the death of his second wife in 1984, he married a third time, in 1985 to Iris Hilda Waters (d. 1994) and moved to the [[Isle of Man]]. After two years there, they moved to [[Canterbury]], [[Kent]],<ref>{{openplaque|3292}}</ref> where Parkinson died in March 1993, at the age of 83. He was buried in Canterbury.
