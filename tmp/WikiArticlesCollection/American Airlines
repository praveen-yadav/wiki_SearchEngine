'''American Airlines, Inc.''' ('''AA''') is a major [[United States|U.S.]] airline headquartered in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]]. It operates an extensive international and domestic network, with scheduled flights throughout North America, the Caribbean, South America, Europe, and Asia. Its route network centers around five "cornerstone" hubs in [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]] and [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]]. Its primary maintenance base is located at [[Tulsa International Airport]] (TUL). 

American is part of the [[Oneworld]] airline alliance, and coordinates fares, services and scheduling with [[British Airways]] and [[Iberia]] in the transatlantic market and with [[Japan Airlines]] in the transpacific market. [[American Eagle Airlines]], [[SkyWest, Inc.]], [[SkyWest Airlines]] and [[ExpressJet Airlines]] operate regional flights for American Airlines under the "American Eagle" brand.<ref>{{cite web|last=Associated |first=The |url=http://news.yahoo.com/american-air-signs-deal-contract-flying-skywest-165209289.html?_esi=1 |title=American Air signs deal to contract out some flying to SkyWest |publisher=Yahoo!

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Fairchild FC-2W.jpg|thumb|A 1927 FC-2, the oldest American Airlines plane to ever fly.]]
[[File:Stinson Trimotor.jpg|thumb|A Stinson Trimotor first operated by Century Airlines]]
American Airways was developed from a conglomeration of 82 small airlines through acquisitions in 1930<ref name=ap>{{cite news|last=Koenig|first=David|title=American Airlines parent seeks Ch. 11 protection|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gqSFH2Ou81RHegJYXJtAeU9CkyhA?docId=c6952820f230470692fc37e00d9d2d36|accessdate=December 7, 2011|newspaper=Google News|date=Nov 29, 2011|agency=Associated Press}}{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> and reorganizations: initially, '''American Airways''' was a common brand by a number of independent carriers. These included [[Southern Air Transport]] in Texas, [[Southwest Air Fast Express|Southern Air Fast Express (SAFE)]] in the western US, [[Universal Aviation Corporation|Universal Aviation]] in the Midwest (which operated a transcontinental air/rail route in 1929), Thompson Aeronautical Services (which operated a Detroit-Cleveland route beginning in 1929) and Colonial Air Transport in the Northeast. Like many early carriers, American earned its keep carrying US Mail.

[[File:American DC-3.jpg|thumb|left|DC-3 "Flagship", American's chief aircraft type during the World War II period.]]
In 1934 American Airways Company was acquired by [[E.L. Cord]], who renamed it "American Air Lines". Cord hired Texas businessman [[C. R. Smith|C.R. (Cyrus Rowlett) Smith]] to run the company. Smith worked with [[Donald Wills Douglas, Sr.|Donald Douglas]] to develop the [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3]], which American Airlines was first to fly, in 1936. American's DC-3 made it the first airline to be able to operate a route that could earn a profit solely by transporting passengers; other carriers could not earn a profit without US Mail.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/american-blemish-distinguished-history-222159291.html "For American, a blemish on a distinguished history," [[Associated Press]] story, published on Yahoo! news online, November 29, 2011]</ref> With the DC-3, American began calling its aircraft "[[Flagships]]" and establishing the Admirals Club for valued passengers. The DC-3s had a four-star "admiral's pennant" outside the cockpit window while the aircraft was parked.

American Airlines was the first to cooperate with [[Fiorello LaGuardia]] to build an airport in New York City and became owner of the world's first [[Airport lounge|airline lounge]] at the new [[LaGuardia Airport]] (LGA), known as the [[Admirals Club]]. Membership was initially by invitation only, but a discrimination suit decades later changed the club into a paid club, creating the model for other airline lounges.

After World War II American acquired American Export Airlines, renaming it as [[American Overseas Airways]], to serve Europe. AOA was sold to [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] in 1950. AA launched another subsidiary, Líneas Aéreas Americanas de Mexico S.A., to fly to Mexico and built several airports there. American Airlines provided advertising and free usage of its aircraft in the 1951 film ''[[Three Guys Named Mike]]''.<ref name="TCMProfile">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=90488&mainArticleId=160793|title=Aviation in Film:Three Guys Named Mike|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=December 22, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090111185245/http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=90488&mainArticleId=160793| archivedate= January 11, 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Until Capital merged into United in 1961 AA was the largest American airline, which meant second-largest in the world, after [[Aeroflot]].

In August 1940 American scheduled flights to 44 airports; in August 1953 to 66, in April 1968 to 47 and in November 1978 to 68.

American Airlines ordered British-built [[De Havilland Comet]]s; the orders were cancelled when the Comets were found to suffer serious metal fatigue. American Airlines introduced transcontinental jets with [[Boeing 707]]s on January 25, 1959. With its 707s American shifted to nonstop coast-to-coast flights, although it maintained feeder connections to cities along its old route using smaller [[Convair 990]]s and [[Lockheed L-188 Electra|Lockheed Electras]]. American invested $440&nbsp;million in jet aircraft up to 1962; launched the first electronic booking system, [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], with [[IBM]] (the basis of today's [[Travelocity]]); and built a terminal at Idlewild (now [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK]]) Airport in New York City, which became the airline's largest base.<ref name="timejets">{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,810685,00.html|title=Jets Across the U.S.|work=TIME|date=November 17, 1958}}</ref>  Vignelli Associates designed the AA eagle logo in 1967. Vignelli attributes the introduction of his firm to American Airlines to Henry Dreyfuss, the legendary AA design consultant. The logo was in use until January 17, 2013.

In 1970 American Airlines had flights from St. Louis, Chicago, and New York to [[Honolulu]] and on to Sydney and [[Auckland]] via [[American Samoa]] and [[Nadi]].<ref>[http://airchive.com/html/timetable-and-route-maps/american/1970-september-14/4734 Timetables & Route Maps – American – 1970 – September 14].

On March 30, 1973 American became the first major airline to employ a female pilot when Bonnie Tiburzi was hired to fly Boeing 727s.

===1980s–90s===
[[File:American Airlines Airbus A300-600 inbound to John F. Kennedy International Airport.jpg|thumb|left|[[Airbus A300|Airbus A300-600]]]]

After moving its headquarters to [[Fort Worth, Texas]] from New York City in 1979, American Airlines changed to a [[spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke system]] in 1981, opening hubs at DFW and Chicago O'Hare. Led by its new chairman and CEO, [[Robert Crandall]], American began flights from these hubs to Europe and Japan in the mid-1980s.

In the late 1980s, American Airlines opened three hubs for north-south traffic. [[Norman Y. Mineta San José International Airport|San Jose International Airport]] was added after American purchased [[AirCal]]. It built a terminal and runway at [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport]] for the growing [[Research Triangle Park]] nearby and to compete with [[US Airways|USAir]]'s hub in [[Charlotte/Douglas International Airport]]. [[Nashville International Airport]] was also a hub. In 1988, American Airlines received its first Airbus A300B4-605R aircraft.

In 1990, American Airlines bought the assets of TWA's operations at London Heathrow for $445&nbsp;million, giving American a hub there. The US/UK [[Bermuda II]] treaty, in effect until [[open skies]] came into effect in April 2008, barred U.S. airlines from Heathrow with the sole exceptions of American Airlines and [[United Airlines]].

Lower fuel prices and a favorable business climate led to higher profits in the 1990s. The industry's expansion was not lost on pilots who on February 17, 1997 went on strike for higher wages. President [[Bill Clinton]] invoked the [[Railway Labor Act]] citing economic impact to the United States, quashing the strike.<ref name="strike">{{cite news |title=American Airlines Resuming Service After Clinton Stops Strike |last=Knowlton |first=Brian |work=International Herald Tribune |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1997/02/17/fly.t_1.php |date=February 17, 1997}}</ref> Pilots settled for wages lower than their demands.

The three new hubs were abandoned in the 1990s: some San Jose facilities were sold to [[Reno Air]], and at Raleigh/Durham to [[Midway Airlines (1993–2003)|Midway Airlines]]. Midway went out of business in 2001. American Airlines purchased Reno Air in February 1999 and integrated its operations on August 31, 1999, but did not resume hub operations in San Jose. American discontinued most of Reno Air's routes, and sold most of the Reno Air aircraft, as it did with [[Air California]] 12 years earlier. The only remaining route from the [[Air California]] and Reno Air purchases is from San Francisco to Los Angeles.

[[File:Aa oneworld b777-200er n791an arp.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] in [[Oneworld]] livery]]
During this time concern over airline bankruptcies and falling stock prices brought a warning from American's CEO [[Robert Crandall]]. "I've never invested in any airline", Crandall said. "I'm an airline manager. I don't invest in airlines. And I always said to the employees of American, 'This is not an appropriate investment. It's a great place to work and it's a great company that does important work. But airlines are not an investment.'" Crandall noted that since [[airline deregulation]] of the 1970s, 150 airlines had gone out of business. "A lot of people came into the airline business. Most of them promptly exited, minus their money", he said.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inside American Airlines, A Week in the Life|url=http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=1193494763|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=17 August 2013}}</ref>

[[Miami International Airport]] became a hub after American Airlines bought Central and South American routes ("El Interamericano") from [[Eastern Air Lines]] in 1990 (inherited from [[Braniff International Airways]] but originated by [[Panagra]]). Through the 1990s, American Airlines expanded its network in Latin America to become the dominant U.S. carrier in the region.

On October 15, 1998, American Airlines became the first airline to offer electronic ticketing in the 44 countries it serves.

In 1999, American Airlines, [[British Airways]], [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Canadian Airlines]], and [[Qantas]] founded the global airline alliance [[Oneworld]].

===2000s===

Robert Crandall left in 1998 and was replaced by [[Donald J. Carty]], who negotiated the purchase of the near bankrupt [[Trans World Airlines]] (it would file for its third bankruptcy as part of the purchase agreement)<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/29/business/twa-cleared-for-2d-bankruptcy-filing.html |work=The New York Times |title=T.W.A. Cleared for 2d Bankruptcy Filing |first=AdamDAM |last=Bryant |date=June 29, 1995 |accessdate=March 26, 2010}}</ref> and its hub in St. Louis in April 2001.

American Airlines began losing money in the economic downturn that followed the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], in  which two of its planes were destroyed. Carty negotiated wage and benefit agreements with the unions but resigned after union leaders discovered he was planning to award [[executive compensation]] packages at the same time. This undermined AA's attempts to increase trust with its workforce and to increase its productivity.<ref name="Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009"/> The St. Louis hub was also downsized.

In 2002, the airline received a 100% rating on the first Corporate Equality Index released by the [[Human Rights Campaign]] in 2002 and has maintained their rating in respect to policies on employees.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

AA has undergone additional cost-cutting, including rolling back its "More Room Throughout Coach" program (which eliminated several rows of seats on certain aircraft), ending three-class service on many international flights, and standardizing its fleet at each hub (see below). However, the airline also expanded into new markets, including Ireland, India and [[mainland China]]. On July 20, 2005, American announced a quarterly profit for the first time in 17 quarters; the airline earned $58&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2005.

AA was a strong backer of the [[Wright Amendment]], which regulated commercial airline operations at [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field]] in Dallas. On June 15, 2006, American agreed with [[Southwest Airlines]] and the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth to seek repeal of the Wright Amendment on condition that Love Field remained a domestic airport and its gate capacity be limited.<ref name="wright">{{cite news|url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/sky/wright_amendment/index.html|title=American Airlines Joins Southwest Airlines in Defeating the Wright Amendment|work=[[USA Today]] Today In The Sky|date= November 2, 2006|deadurl=yes}}{{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref>

[[File:AARDUT.jpg|thumb|left| [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80|MD-82]] at [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport]]]]
American Airlines has had repeated run-ins with the FAA regarding maintenance of its [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80|MD-80]] fleet (the company is the single largest operator of the craft); the costs associated with operating these jets has affected American's bottom line. American Airlines canceled 1,000 flights to inspect wire bundles over three days in April 2008 to make sure they complied with government safety regulations.<ref name="md80s">{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24029455/|title=American’s MD-80s cleared to fly again|agency=Associated Press|date=April 14, 2008}}</ref> This caused significant inconvenience to passengers and financial problems for the airline. American has begun the process of replacing its older MD-80 jets with Boeing 737s. The newer MD-80s will continue to serve until the recently ordered [[Airbus]] A319s, A321s and [[Boeing]] 737-800s are delivered.

In September 2009, the [[Associated Press]] and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that American was accused of hiding repeated maintenance lapses on at least 16 MD-80s from the FAA. Repair issues included such items as faulty emergency slides, improper engine coatings, incorrectly drilled holes and other examples of shoddy workmanship. The most serious alleged lapse is a failure to repair cracks to pressure bulkheads; the rupture of a bulkhead could lead to cabin depressurization. It is also alleged that the airline retired one airplane in order to hide it from FAA inspectors.<ref>American Faces Escalating Dispute with FAA, Wall Street Journal,Corporate News, September 4, 2009</ref><ref>[http://my.att.net/s/editorial.dll?pnum=1&bfromind=7406&eeid=6795219&_sitecat=1522&dcatid=0&eetype=article&render=y&ac=-2&ck=&ch=ne&rg=blsadstrgt&_lid=332&_lnm=tg+ne+topnews&ck= FAA investigating American's MD-80 repairs, Associated Press, reported on AT&T on-line news, September 4, 2009]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref>

===Logo===
[[File:American Airlines logo.svg|thumb||American Airlines' former logo, in use from 1967 until 2013]]
In 1967, [[Massimo Vignelli]] designed the famous AA logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vignelli.com/home/identity/aa.html |title=Vignelli Associates About the AA Logo |publisher=Vignelli.com |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.logosdesigners.com/#massimo-vignelli Iconic Logo Designers]</ref> Thirty years later, in 1997, American Airlines was able to make its logo Internet-compatible by buying the domain AA.com. ''AA'' is also American's two-letter [[IATA]] [[airline codes|airline designator]].

In January 2013, American launched a new rebranding and marketing campaign with FutureBrand dubbed, "A New American". This included a new logo replacing the classic 1967 logo. American Airlines calls the new logo the "Flight Symbol", incorporating the eagle, star, and "A" of the classic logo.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=https://www.aa.com/newamerican?anchorLocation=HomePageHero1&reportedTitle=Becoming%20a%20new%20American&reportedPosition=0&url=undefined&_locale=en_US&repositoryName=undefined&repositoryId=undefined |title=Becoming a new American |publisher=Aa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>

===Livery===
American's early [[aircraft livery|liveries]] varied widely, but a common livery was adopted in the 1930s, featuring an [[eagle]] painted on the fuselage. The eagle became a symbol of the company and inspired the name of [[American Eagle Airlines]]. Propeller aircraft featured an [[international orange]] lightning bolt running down the length of the fuselage, which was replaced by a simpler orange stripe with the introduction of jets.

[[File:American Airlines Astrojet N951AA.jpg|thumb|A Boeing 737 in the Astrojet livery]]

In the late 1960s, American commissioned [[Massimo Vignelli]], an acclaimed industrial and graphic designer, to develop a new livery. The original design called for a red, white, and blue stripe on the fuselage, and a simple "AA" logo, without an eagle, on the tail. However, Vignelli eventually created a highly stylized eagle, which remained the company's logo until 2013. In 1999, American painted a new [[Boeing 757]] (N679AN) in its 1959 international orange livery. There is a Boeing 737–800 in the retro AstroJet livery. One [[Boeing 777]] and one Boeing 757 are painted in standard livery with a pink ribbon on the sides and on the tail, in support for the [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]]. One Boeing 757 is painted with a gold ribbon on the tailfin on the aircraft and on the side of the body says "Flagship Independence". American Eagle, the airline's regional airline has the same special livery on ERJ-145 aircraft.

[[File:AA Flagship Freedom.JPG|thumb|left|AA "Flagship Freedom" in support of all who serve]]
On January 17, 2013, American announced that it was changing its planes' livery.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-american-airlines-livery-20130117,0,198977.story |title=American Airlines unveils new logo, livery |work=Chicago Tribune|date=January 17, 2013|accessdate=January 17, 2013 }}</ref> Before then, American had been the only major U.S. airline to leave most of its aircraft surfaces unpainted. This was because C. R. Smith hated painted aircraft, and refused to use any liveries that involved painting the entire plane. Robert "Bob" Crandall later justified the distinctive natural metal finish by noting that less paint reduced the aircraft's weight, thus saving on fuel costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://industry.bnet.com/travel/1000148/paint-vs-bare-metal-on-airplanes/ |title=Delta, Air Canada Among Carriers Weighing Benefit of Paint Stripping |publisher=Industry.bnet.com |date=October 8, 2008 |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref> The new livery does not allow for the polished aluminum surface that the planes historically displayed.

In January 2013, American launched a new rebranding and marketing campaign dubbed, "A New American". In addition to a new logo, American Airlines introduced a new and modern livery for all aircraft in the fleet. The airline calls the new livery and branding "a clean and modern update" and a testament to American's willingness to become a more modern, vibrant, and sophisticated airline.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The current design features an abstract American flag on the tail, along with a silver-painted fuselage, as a throw-back to the old livery.

===Environmental record===
Violations occurring over a 4½ year period – from October 1993 to July 1998 – targeted American Airlines for using high-sulfur fuel in motor vehicles at 10 major airports around the country. Under the federal [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] high sulfur fuel cannot be used in motor vehicles. American Airlines promptly identified and corrected these violations of the Clean Air Act.<ref name="epa">{{cite web|title=American Airines Will Make Clean Air Improvements at Logan Airport Reports to EPA the Use of Illegal High Sulfur Fuel in Motor Vehicles|url=http://epa.gov/NE/pr/1999/072099b.html Environmental Protection Agency|work=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=July 19, 1999|accessdate=January 25, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

American Airlines' wastewater treatment plant [[recycle]]s water used at the base to wash aircraft, process rinse water tanks, and irrigate landscape. That alone has saved almost $1&nbsp;million since 2002. In addition to that, American Airlines has also won the award for the reduction of [[hazardous waste]] that saved them $229,000 after a $2,000 investment. A bar code system is used to track hazardous waste. It has led to reduction of waste by 50 percent since 2000.<ref name="envqual">{{cite journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CWU/is_2006_May_11/ai_n16359869|title=American Airlines Receives Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's Governor's Award|work=Airline Industry Information|date=May 11, 2006}}</ref>

American Airlines serves four continents, trailing [[Delta Air Lines]] and [[United Airlines]], which both serve six. Hubs at Dallas/Fort Worth and Miami serve as gateways to the Americas, while American's Chicago hub has become the airline's primary gateway to Europe and Asia. New York Kennedy (JFK) is a primary gateway for both the Americas and Europe, while the Los Angeles hub (LAX) is the primary gateway to Asia. [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport]] served as a regional hub for several years. However, the airline's 2009 restructuring led to the airport being removed as a [[focus city]] on April 5, 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/item.aspx?type=blog&ak=68499380.blog |title=Aviation Photos & Video |work=USA Today | first=Ben |last=Mutzabaugh}}</ref> In the US, American serves the third-largest number of international destinations, after [[United Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]].

American also operated interchange flight services in conjunction with Alaska Airlines during the 1970s between Texas and Alaska during the construction of the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. This interchange agreement allowed for single, no change of aircraft service between Houston, TX and Dallas/Ft. Worth, TX, and Anchorage, AK and Fairbanks, AK. The roundtrip routing of this interchange flight was Houston-Dallas/Ft. Worth-Seattle-Anchorage-Fairbanks with Seattle, WA serving as the interchange point where flight and cabin crews were changed from one airline to the other. Boeing 727-200 jetliners provided by both American and Alaska Airlines were utilized to provide this interchange service. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==== Flagship Suite First Class ====
The Flagship Suite service is currently available on all B777-300ER and B777-200ER aircraft, but first class is being phased out on the B777-200ER fleet in 2014.

B777-200ER aircraft currently feature the Flagship Suite in first class (to be eliminated from the -200 in 2014). An industry first, all seats in this cabin swivel 90 degrees in the direction opposite of the aisle to an extensible working desk, as well as ~thirty degrees for use of a large folding dining table or to be made into a 6 foot 6" flat bed. 16 seats are provided in a 1-2-1 configuration. 92-inch seat pitch is provided along with a large amount of seat width.

Amenities include a battery-powered Bose noise-canceling headset, newspapers, amenity kit, pajamas, slippers, premium pillow, mattress pad, duvet, light blanket and a menu. The ottoman can be used as a seat for a companion and one can dine with him/her if you desire. For seats that are situated between the two aisles, a privacy screen can be adjusted if needed to provided tranquility and the uttermost comfort. Passengers have access to the Flagship Check-in, the Flagship Lounge (Admirals Club when no Flagship Lounge exists) and the Arrivals lounge at London Heathrow (with complimentary showers and suit pressing) if they arrive between 5:00 AM and 2:00 PM local time.

The B777-300ER sports a newer version of the Flagship Suite, retaining many of the older 777-200ER benefits but adding three-prong powered Bose Noise Reduction headsets, a much larger IFE / AVOD touch screen (also controlled with an electronic control set), 110 V AC and USB power connections, in a First cabin with eight seats (also in a 1-2-1 configuration), satellite WiFi (extra cost) and two dedicated lavatories plus galley with microwave and cappuccino machine.

(B767-200 aircraft features the first Flagship first class (not suites), primarily flying between New York's John F. Kennedy and Los Angeles and San Francisco. Seats provide 62-inch seat pitch and 19-inch seat width. Seats have electric controls which can be used to recline the seat into an angled flat bed. Seats are arranged in a 2-1-2 configuration. Seats are made with blue cloth and blue leather and are equipped with electronically operated legrests, footrests, DC power ports. Amenities include noise-canceling headset, premium pillow, duvet, portable video player and a menu. These seats are being phased out for the new transcontinental fleet of A321 aircraft where the new international business-class product will be featured as first class. Also, passengers receive access to the Admirals Club and the Flagship lounge at JFK and LAX.

==== Domestic First Class ====

==AAdvantage==
{{main|AAdvantage}}
AAdvantage is the frequent flyer program of American Airlines. Launched May 1, 1981, it was the second such [[loyalty program]] in the world (after the first at [[Texas International Airlines]] in 1979), and remains the largest with more than 67 million members as of October 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thetravelinsider.info/airlinemismanagement/airlinederegulation2.htm|title=A History of US Airline Deregulation Part 4 :  1979 – 2010 :  The Effects of Deregulation – Lower Fares, More Travel, Frequent Flier Programs |author=David M Rowell |date=August 13, 2010 |publisher=The Travel Insider|accessdate=September 21, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100816114115/http://www.thetravelinsider.info/airlinemismanagement/airlinederegulation2.htm| archivedate= August 16, 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=American Airlines|title=American Airlines AAdvantage Program Details|url=https://www.aa.com/aa/i18nForward.do?p=/AAdvantage/programDetails/main.jsp&anchorEvent=false|accessdate=May 28, 2009}}</ref>

Miles accumulated in the program allow members to redeem tickets, upgrade service class, or obtain free or discounted car rentals, hotel stays, merchandise, or other products and services through partners. The most active members, based on the amount and price of travel booked, are designated AAdvantage Gold, AAdvantage Platinum, and AAdvantage Executive Platinum elite members, with privileges such as separate check-in, priority upgrade and standby processing, or free upgrades. They also receive similar privileges from AA's partner airlines, particularly those in [[Oneworld]].<ref>[http://www.aa.com/aa/i18nForward.do?p=/AAdvantage/partners/airlines/oneWorld.jsp#elite oneworld Alliance]. Aa.com (2010-10-01). Retrieved on November 4, 2010.</ref> AAdvantage co-branded credit cards are also available and offer other benefits. These cards are issued by CitiCards, subsidiary of [[Citigroup]] in the United States and [[MBNA]] in the United Kingdom.

==Lounges==
===Admirals Club===
[[File:Admirals Club logo.png|thumb|Admirals Club Logo]]
The Admirals Club was conceived by AA president C.R. Smith as a marketing promotion shortly after he was made an honorary [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]]. Inspired by the [[Kentucky colonel]]s and other [[Title of honor|honorary]] organizations, Smith decided to make particularly valued passengers "admirals" of the "Flagship fleet" (AA called its aircraft "Flagships" at the time). The list of Admirals included many celebrities, politicians and other VIPs, as well as more "ordinary" customers who had been particularly loyal to the airline.

There was no physical Admirals Club until shortly after the opening of LaGuardia Airport. During the airport's construction, New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia had an upper-level lounge set aside for press conferences and business meetings. At one such press conference, he noted that the entire terminal was being offered for lease to airline tenants; after a reporter asked whether the lounge would be leased as well, LaGuardia replied that it would, and a vice president of AA immediately offered to lease the premises. The airline then procured a liquor license and began operating the lounge as the "Admirals Club" in 1939.

The second Admirals Club opened at Washington National Airport. Because it was illegal to sell alcohol in Virginia at the time, the Club contained refrigerators for the use of its members, so they could store their own liquor at the airport. For many years, membership in the Admirals Club (and most other airline lounges) was by the airline's invitation. After a passenger sued for discrimination,<ref name="timeac">{{cite news|title=Toward Equality for VIPs|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836046,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|work=TIME|date=July 15, 1966|accessdate=January 26, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090114112519/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836046,00.html?iid=chix-sphere| archivedate= January 14, 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> the Club (and most other airline lounges) switched to a paid membership program.

Membership now costs $250 to $400 per year, depending on AAdvantage frequent flyer program level, with a $50 initiation fee in the first year; membership can also be purchased with AAdvantage miles. As of December 2010, passengers can buy a 24-hour pass for $50. American Express Platinum Cardmembers receive access to the Admirals Club as a benefit of their membership.

===Flagship Lounge===
Though affiliated with the Admirals Club and staffed by many of the same employees, the Flagship Lounge is a separate lounge specifically designed for customers flying in First Class on transcontinental domestic flights and international flights, as well as AAdvantage Executive Platinum and Oneworld Emerald frequent flyers. The added amenities of the Flagship Lounges compared to the normal Admirals Club include free premium alcoholic beverages; free buffet snacks including breakfast items, salads, sandwiches, fruits, chocolates, cheeses and other light fare (options change based on time of day); and a less crowded, more comfortable lounge space. Additionally, complimentary computer terminals with free internet access, complimentary wireless internet access, and complimentary printing are available at most locations, as are shower facilities.

The first Flagship Lounge was opened at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport as a courtesy to First Class customers preparing for long flights to London and Tokyo. While the Dallas lounge is no longer open, Flagship Lounges are now available at four airports: Chicago-O'Hare, London-Heathrow, Los Angeles and New York-JFK.<ref>{{cite web|title=Flagship Lounge(R)|url=http://www.aa.com/i18n/travelInformation/airportAmenities/AAFlagshipLounges.jsp|publisher=American Airlines|accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref> American also previously offered a Flagship Lounge in Miami from 2000 to 2002, and again from 2009.<ref>http://www.businesstraveller.com/news/aa-lounge-opens-at-miami-international</ref>

A fictitious "American Airlines Space Freighter", the ''Valley Forge'', was the setting for the 1971 science fiction movie ''[[Silent Running]]'', starring [[Bruce Dern]] and directed by [[Douglas Trumbull]].
