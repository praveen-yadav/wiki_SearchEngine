'''DDT''' ('''d'''ichloro'''d'''iphenyl'''t'''richloroethane) is an [[organochlorine]] [[insecticide]] which is a colorless, [[crystalline]] solid, tasteless and almost odorless chemical compound. Technical DDT has been formulated in almost every conceivable form including solutions in [[xylene]] or [[petroleum]] distillates, emulsifiable concentrates, water-wettable powders, granules, [[aerosols]], smoke candles, and charges for vaporisers and lotions.<ref name=IPCS>{{

First synthesized in 1874, DDT's insecticidal properties were not discovered until 1939, and it was used with great success in the second half of [[World War II]] to control [[malaria]] and [[typhus]] among civilians and troops. The Swiss chemist [[Paul Hermann Müller]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1948 "for his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison against several arthropods."<ref name=nobel>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1948/ NobelPrize.org: The Nobel Prize in Physiology of Medicine 1948] Accessed July 26, 2007.</ref> After the war, DDT was made available for use as an agricultural [[insecticide]], and its production and use increased.<ref name=EHC9>[http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc009.htm ''Environmental Health Criteria 9: DDT and its derivatives''], World Health Organization, 1979.</ref>

In 1962, ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by American biologist [[Rachel Carson]] was published. The book catalogued the environmental impacts of the indiscriminate spraying of DDT in the US and questioned the logic of releasing large amounts of chemicals into the environment without fully understanding their effects on ecology or human health. The book suggested that DDT and other pesticides may cause [[cancer]] and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds. Its publication was one of the signature events in the birth of the [[Environmentalism|environmental movement]], and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually led to DDT being banned for agricultural use in the US in 1972.<ref name="Lear"/> DDT was subsequently banned for agricultural use worldwide under the [[Stockholm Convention]], but its limited use in [[Vector (epidemiology)|disease vector]] [[vector control|control]] continues to this day and remains controversial.<ref name="Larson">{{cite journal|last=Larson|first=Kim|date=December 1, 2007|title=Bad Blood|journal=On Earth|issue=Winter 2008|url=http://www.onearth.org/article/bad-blood?|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref><ref name=moyers>{{Cite web | last = Moyers | first = Bill | author-link = Bill Moyers | title = Rachel Carson and DDT | date = 2007-09-21 | url = http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/09212007/profile2.html | accessdate = 2011-03-05 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Along with the passage of the [[Endangered Species Act]], the US ban on DDT is cited by scientists as a major factor in the comeback of the [[bald eagle]], the [[national bird of the United States]], and the [[peregrine falcon]] from near-[[extinction]] in the contiguous US.<ref name="pmid17588911">

==Properties and chemistry==
DDT is similar in structure to the insecticide [[methoxychlor]] and the [[acaricide]] [[dicofol]]. It is highly [[hydrophobic]], nearly [[soluble|insoluble]] in [[Water (molecule)|water]] but has a good solubility in most [[Organic chemistry|organic]] [[solvent]]s, [[fat]]s, and [[oil (liquid)|oils]]. DDT does not occur naturally, but is produced by the reaction of [[trichloroethanal|chloral]] ({{chem|CCl|3|CHO}}) with [[chlorobenzene]] ({{chem|C|6|H|5|Cl}}) in the presence of [[sulfuric acid]], which acts as a [[catalyst]]. Trade names that DDT has been marketed under include Anofex (Geigy Chemical Corp.), Cezarex, Chlorophenothane, Clofenotane, Dicophane, Dinocide, Gesarol (Syngenta Crop.), Guesapon, Guesarol, Gyron (Ciba-Geigy Corp. – now Novartis), Ixodex, Neocid (Reckitt & Colman, Ltd), Neocidol (Ciba-Geigy Corp. – now Novartis), and Zerdane.<ref name=EHC9/>

===Isomers and related compounds===
[[File:o,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane.svg|thumb|''o,p' ''-DDT, a minor component in commercial DDT.]]
Commercial DDT is a mixture of several closely–related compounds. The major component (77%) is the ''[[Arene substitution patterns|p]]'',''p' '' [[isomer]] which is pictured at the top of this article. The ''o'',''p' '' isomer (pictured to the right) is also present in significant amounts (15%). [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene]] (DDE) and [[dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane]] (DDD) make up the balance. DDE and DDD are also the major [[metabolite]]s and breakdown products in the environment.<ref name=EHC9/> The term "'''total DDT'''" is often used to refer to the sum of all DDT related compounds (''p,p'-''DDT, ''o,p'-''DDT, DDE, and DDD) in a sample.

===Production and use statistics===

===Mechanism of insecticide action===
In insects it opens [[Sodium channel|sodium ion channels]] in [[neuron]]s, causing them to fire spontaneously, which leads to spasms and eventual death. Insects with certain [[mutation]]s in their sodium channel [[gene]] are resistant to DDT and other similar insecticides. DDT resistance is also conferred by up-regulation of genes expressing [[cytochrome P450]] in some insect species,<ref>{{

===Use in the 1940s and 1950s===
DDT is the best-known of several [[chlorine]]-containing pesticides used in the 1940s and 1950s. With [[pyrethrum]] in short supply, DDT was used extensively during [[World War II]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to control the insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of [[typhus]] – nearly eliminating the disease in many parts of [[Europe]]. In the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]], it was sprayed aerially for malaria and dengue fever control with spectacular effects. While DDT's chemical and insecticidal properties were important factors in these victories, advances in application equipment coupled with a high degree of organization and sufficient manpower were also crucial to the success of these programs.<ref name="Dunlap">{{

DDT was less effective in tropical regions due to the continuous life cycle of mosquitoes and poor infrastructure. It was not applied at all in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] due to these perceived difficulties. Mortality rates in that area never declined to the same dramatic extent, and now constitute the bulk of malarial deaths worldwide, especially following the disease's resurgence as a result of resistance to drug treatments and the spread of the deadly malarial variant caused by ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''. The goal of eradication was abandoned in 1969, and attention was focused on controlling and treating the disease. Spraying programs (especially using DDT) were curtailed due to concerns over safety and environmental effects, as well as problems in administrative, managerial and financial implementation, but mostly because mosquitoes were developing resistance to DDT.<ref name="pmid7278974"/> Efforts shifted from spraying to the use of [[Mosquito net|bednets]] impregnated with insecticides and other interventions.<ref name="AmJTrop"/><ref name="pmid16125595">{{

===''Silent Spring'' and the U.S. ban===
As early as the 1940s, scientists in the U.S. had begun expressing concern over possible hazards associated with DDT, and in the 1950s the government began tightening some of the regulations governing its use.<ref name=EPA1975/> However, these early events received little attention, and it was not until 1957, when the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported an unsuccessful struggle to restrict DDT use in [[Nassau County, New York]], that the issue came to the attention of the popular naturalist-author, [[Rachel Carson]]. [[William Shawn]], editor of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', urged her to write a piece on the subject, which developed into her famous book ''[[Silent Spring]]'', published in 1962. The book argued that [[pesticide]]s, including DDT, were poisoning both wildlife and the environment and were also endangering human health.<ref name="Lear">Lear, Linda (1997). ''Rachel Carson: Witness for Nature.'' New York: Henry Hoyten.</ref>

''Silent Spring'' was a best seller, and public reaction to it launched the modern [[environmentalism|environmental movement]] in the United States. The year after it appeared, [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] ordered his Science Advisory Committee to investigate Carson's claims. The report the committee issued "add[ed] up to a fairly thorough-going vindication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring thesis," in the words of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'',<ref name="pmid17810673">{{cite journal |author=Greenberg DS |title=Pesticides: White House Advisory Body Issues Report Recommending Steps to Reduce Hazard to Public |journal=Science |volume=140 |issue=3569 |pages=878–9 |year=1963 |month=May |pmid=17810673 |doi=10.1126/science.140.3569.878 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17810673 }} cited in {{cite journal|last=Graham Jr.|first=Frank|title=Nature's Protector and Provocateur|journal=Audubon Magazine|url=http://audubonmagazine.org/books/editorchoice0709.html}} {{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> and recommended a phaseout of "persistent toxic pesticides".<ref name="Michaels2008">{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=David|title=[[Doubt is Their Product]]: How Industry's Assault on Science Threatens Your Health|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-530067-3}}</ref> DDT became a prime target of the growing anti-chemical and anti-pesticide movements, and in 1967 a group of scientists and lawyers founded the [[Environmental Defense|Environmental Defense Fund]] (EDF) with the specific goal of winning a ban on DDT. [[Victor Yannacone]], Charles Wurster, [[Art Cooley]] and others associated with inception of EDF had all witnessed bird kills or declines in bird populations and suspected that DDT was the cause. In their campaign against the chemical, EDF petitioned the government for a ban and filed a series of lawsuits.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sue the Bastards |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910111-2,00.html |publisher=[[TIME]] |date=October 18, 1971 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKxR0D6f |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}</ref> Around this time, [[toxicologist]] [[David Peakall]] was measuring [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]] levels in the eggs of [[peregrine falcons]] and [[California condor]]s and finding that increased levels corresponded with thinner shells.

In response to an EDF suit, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in 1971 ordered the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] to begin the de-registration procedure for DDT. After an initial six-month review process, [[William Ruckelshaus]], the Agency's first [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] rejected an immediate suspension of DDT's registration, citing studies from the EPA's internal staff stating that DDT was not an imminent danger to human health and wildlife.<ref name=EPA1975/> However, the findings of these staff members were criticized, as they were performed mostly by [[economic entomologist]]s inherited from the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], who many environmentalists felt were biased towards agribusiness and tended to minimize concerns about human health and wildlife. The decision not to ban thus created public controversy.<ref name=Dunlap/>

The EPA then held seven months of hearings in 1971–1972, with scientists giving evidence both for and against the use of DDT. In the summer of 1972, Ruckelshaus announced the cancellation of most uses of DDT – an exemption allowed for public health uses under some conditions.<ref name=EPA1975/> Immediately after the cancellation was announced, both EDF and the DDT manufacturers filed suit against the EPA, with the industry seeking to overturn the ban, and EDF seeking a comprehensive ban. The cases were consolidated, and in 1973 the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] ruled that the EPA had acted properly in banning DDT.<ref name=EPA1975/>

The U.S. DDT ban took place amidst a growing public mistrust of industry, with the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] issuing a report on the negative effects of [[smoking]] [[tobacco]] in 1964, the [[Cuyahoga River]] catching fire in 1969, the fiasco surrounding the use of [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES), and the well-publicized decline in the [[bald eagle]] population.<ref name=Michaels2008/>

Some uses of DDT continued under the public health exemption. For example, in June 1979, the California Department of Health Services was permitted to use DDT to suppress flea vectors of [[bubonic plague]].<ref name="urlAEI – Short Publications – The Rise, Fall, Rise, and Imminent Fall of DDT">{{cite web |url=http://www.aei.org/outlook/27063 |title=AEI – Short Publications – The Rise, Fall, Rise, and Imminent Fall of DDT |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKxRwUwH |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}</ref> DDT also continued to be produced in the US for foreign markets until as late as 1985, when over 300 tons were exported.<ref name="ATSDRc5"/>

===Restrictions on usage===
In the 1970s and 1980s, agricultural use was banned in most developed countries, beginning with [[Hungary]] in 1968<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fvm.hu/main.php?folderID=1564&articleID=6169&ctag=articlelist&iid=1&part=2| title=Selected passages from the history of the Hungarian plant protection administration on the 50th anniversary of establishing the county plant protection stations

The [[Stockholm Convention]], which took effect in 2004, outlawed several [[persistent organic pollutant]]s, and restricted DDT use to [[vector control]].

Recognizing that total elimination in many malaria-prone countries is currently unfeasible because there are few affordable or effective alternatives, public health use is exempt from the ban pending acceptable alternatives.

[[File:DDT to DDD and DDE.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Degradation of DDT to form DDE (by elimination of HCl, left) and DDD (by reductive dechlorination, right)]]
DDT is a [[persistent organic pollutant]] that is readily adsorbed to [[soil]]s and [[sediment]]s, which can act both as sinks and as long-term sources of exposure contributing to terrestrial organisms.<ref name=IPCS/> Depending on conditions, its soil [[half life]] can range from 22 days to 30 years. Routes of loss and degradation include runoff, volatilization, [[photolysis]] and [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] [[biodegradation]]. Due to [[hydrophobic]] properties, in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s DDT and its metabolites are absorbed by aquatic organisms and adsorbed on suspended particles, leaving little DDT dissolved in the water itself. Its breakdown products and metabolites, DDE and DDD, are also highly persistent and have similar chemical and physical properties.<ref name="ATSDRc5"/> DDT and its breakdown products are transported from warmer regions of the world to the [[Arctic]] by the phenomenon of [[global distillation]], where they then accumulate in the region's [[food web]].<ref>{{

===Effects on wildlife and eggshell thinning===

DDT is toxic to a wide range of living organisms, including marine animals such as [[crayfish]], [[daphnia|daphnids]], [[shrimp|sea shrimp]] and many species of [[fish]]. It is less toxic to mammals, but may be moderately toxic to some [[amphibian]] species, especially in the [[larvae|larval]] stage. DDT, through its metabolite DDE ([[dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene]]), caused eggshell thinning and resulted in severe population declines in multiple North American and European [[bird of prey]] species.<ref name="Vos">{{cite journal| author=Vos JG, Dybing E, Greim HA, Ladefoged O, Lambré C, Tarazona JV et al.| title=Health effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on wildlife, with special reference to the European situation | journal=Crit Rev Toxicol | year= 2000 | volume= 30 | issue= 1 | pages= 71–133 | pmid=10680769 | doi=10.1080/10408440091159176}}</ref> Eggshell thinning lowers the reproductive rate of certain bird species by causing egg breakage and embryo deaths.

====Developmental toxicity====
DDT and DDE, like other organochlorines, have been shown to have [[estrogen|xenoestrogenic]] activity, meaning they are chemically similar enough to estrogens to trigger hormonal responses in animals. This [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine disrupting]] activity has been observed in [[mouse|mice]] and [[rat]] toxicological studies, and available [[epidemiological]] evidence indicates that these effects may be occurring in humans as a result of DDT exposure. The US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] states that DDT exposure damages the reproductive system and reduces reproductive success. These effects may cause developmental and reproductive toxicity:
* A review article in ''[[The Lancet]]'' states, "research has shown that exposure to DDT at amounts that would be needed in malaria control might cause preterm birth and early weaning ... toxicological evidence shows [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine-disrupting]] properties; human data also indicate possible disruption in semen quality, menstruation, gestational length, and duration of lactation."<ref name="pmid16125595"/>

In contrast, a study published in 2007 strongly associated early exposure (the ''p,p'-'' isomer) and breast cancer later in life. Unlike previous studies, this  [[prospective cohort study]] collected blood samples from young mothers in the 1960s while DDT was still in use, and their breast cancer status was then monitored over the years. In addition to suggesting that the ''p,p'-'' isomer is the more significant risk factor, the study also suggests that the timing of exposure is critical. For the subset of women born more than 14 years before agricultural use, there was no association between DDT and breast cancer. However, for younger women – exposed earlier in life – the third who were exposed most to ''p,p'-''DDT had a fivefold increase in breast cancer incidence over the least exposed third, after correcting for the protective effect of ''o,p'-''DDT.<ref name=Cohn07/><ref>{{cite news |author=Douglas Fischer |title=Exposure to DDT is linked to cancer |url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/health/ci_6524706?nclick_check=1 |publisher=Contra Costa Times |date=August 8, 2007 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKxfh59f |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name=cone2007>{{cite news

==Use against malaria==
[[Malaria]] remains a major public health challenge in many countries. 2008 WHO estimates were 243 million cases, and 863,000 deaths. About 89% of these deaths occur in [[Africa]], and mostly to children under the age of 5.<ref name="wmr09">
2009 WHO [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241563901_eng.pdf World Malaria Report 2009]</ref>  DDT is one of many tools that public health officials use to fight the disease. Its use in this context has been called everything from a "miracle weapon [that is] like [[Kryptonite]] to the mosquitoes,"<ref name=salon/> to "toxic colonialism."<ref>{{

Before DDT, eliminating mosquito breeding grounds by drainage or poisoning with [[Paris green]] or [[pyrethrum]] was sometimes successful in fighting malaria. In parts of the world with rising living standards, the elimination of malaria was often a collateral benefit of the introduction of window screens and improved sanitation.<ref name="Gladwell"/> Today, a variety of usually simultaneous interventions is the norm. These include [[antimalarial drugs]] to prevent or treat infection; improvements in public health infrastructure to quickly diagnose, sequester, and treat infected individuals;  [[mosquito net|bednets]] and other methods intended to keep mosquitoes from biting humans; and [[vector control]] strategies<ref name=wmr09/> such as [[larvacide|larvaciding]] with insecticides, ecological controls such as draining mosquito breeding grounds or introducing fish to eat larvae, and [[indoor residual spraying]] (IRS) with insecticides, possibly including DDT. IRS involves the treatment of all interior walls and ceilings with insecticides, and is particularly effective against mosquitoes, since many species rest on an indoor wall before or after feeding. DDT is one of 12 WHO–approved IRS insecticides. How much of a role DDT should play in this mix of strategies is still controversial.<ref>Yakob, L., Dunning, R. & Yan, G. Indoor residual spray and insecticide-treated bednets for malaria control: theoretical synergisms and antagonisms.

WHO's anti-malaria campaign of the 1950s and 1960s relied heavily on DDT and the results were promising, though temporary. Experts tie the resurgence of malaria to multiple factors, including poor leadership, management and funding of malaria control programs; poverty; civil unrest; and increased [[irrigation]]. The evolution of resistance to first-generation drugs (e.g. [[chloroquine]]) and to insecticides exacerbated the situation.<ref name="DDTBP.1/2"/><ref>{{

===Effectiveness of DDT against malaria===
When it was first introduced in World War II, DDT was very effective in reducing malaria [[morbidity]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]].<ref name=Dunlap/> The WHO's anti-malaria campaign, which consisted mostly of spraying DDT, was initially very successful as well. For example, in [[Sri Lanka]], the program reduced cases from about 3 million per year before spraying to just 18 in 1963<ref>{{cite book|title=The Coming Plague|publisher=Virago Press|year=1994|isbn=1-86049-211-8|page=51|author=Garrett, Laurie.}}</ref><ref>

Thereafter the program was halted to save money and malaria rebounded to 600,000 cases in 1968 and the first quarter of 1969. The country resumed DDT vector control but the mosquitoes had acquired resistance in the interim, presumably because of continued agricultural use. The program switched to [[malathion]], which though more expensive, proved effective.<ref name="Gordon">{{

Today, DDT remains on the WHO's list of insecticides recommended for IRS. Since the appointment of [[Arata Kochi]] as head of its anti-malaria division, WHO's policy has shifted from recommending IRS only in areas of seasonal or episodic transmission of malaria, to also advocating it in areas of continuous, intense transmission.<ref>
[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr50/en/index.html WHO | WHO gives indoor use of DDT a clean bill of health for controlling malaria]</ref> The WHO has reaffirmed its commitment to eventually phasing out DDT, aiming "to achieve a 30% cut in the application of DDT world-wide by 2014 and its total phase-out by the early 2020s if not sooner" while simultaneously combating malaria. The WHO plans to implement alternatives to DDT to achieve this goal.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/malaria_ddt_20090506/en/index.html Countries move toward more sustainable ways to roll back malaria]</ref>

South Africa is one country that continues to use DDT under WHO guidelines. In 1996, the country switched to alternative insecticides and malaria incidence increased dramatically. Returning to DDT and introducing new drugs brought malaria back under control.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Roll Back Malaria: a failing global health campaign| first=Gavin| last=Yamey| journal=BMJ| year=2004| volume=328| pages=1086–1087| month=8 May| doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7448.1086 | pmid=15130956| issue=7448| pmc=406307}}</ref> According to DDT advocate Donald Roberts, malaria cases increased in [[South America]] after countries in that continent stopped using DDT.

===Mosquito resistance===
Resistance has greatly reduced DDT's effectiveness. WHO guidelines require that absence of resistance must be confirmed before using the chemical.<ref name="IRS-WHO">

Criticisms of a DDT "ban" often specifically reference the 1972 US ban (with the erroneous implication that this constituted a worldwide ban and prohibited use of DDT in vector control). Reference is often made to [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''Silent Spring'' even though she never pushed for a ban on DDT. [[John Quiggin]] and Tim Lambert wrote, "the most striking feature of the claim against Carson is the ease with which it can be refuted."<ref name="quig">
{{cite news |first1=John |last1=Quiggin |first2=Tim |last2=Lambert |title=Rehabilitating Carson |newspaper=Prospect |date=May 2008 |url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/rehabilitatingcarson/ }}</ref> Carson actually devoted a page of her book to considering the relationship between DDT and malaria, warning of the [[evolution]] of DDT resistance in mosquitoes and concluding:

<blockquote>It is more sensible in some cases to take a small amount of damage in preference to having none for a time but paying for it in the long run by losing the very means of fighting [is the advice given in Holland by Dr Briejer in his capacity as director of the Plant Protection Service]. Practical advice should be "Spray as little as you possibly can" rather than "Spray to the limit of your capacity."</blockquote>
<!--what can she have meant by "small amount of damage" and who did she think was spraying "to the limit of your capacity"?-->

It has also been alleged that donor governments and agencies have refused to fund DDT spraying, or made aid contingent upon not using DDT. According to a report in the ''British Medical Journal'', use of DDT in [[Mozambique]] "was stopped several decades ago, because 80% of the country's health budget came from donor funds, and donors refused to allow the use of DDT."<ref>{{

The [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) has been the focus of much criticism. While the agency is currently funding the use of DDT in some African countries,<ref name="USAID">{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/id/malaria/techareas/irs.html|title=USAID Health: Infectious Diseases, Malaria, Technical Areas, Prevention and Control, Indoor Residual Spraying|publisher=USAID|accessdate=2008-10-14|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKxoMqlg |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}</ref> in the past it did not. When [[John Stossel]] accused USAID of not funding DDT because it wasn't "politically correct," Anne Peterson, the agency's assistant administrator for global health, replied that "I believe that the strategies we are using are as effective as spraying with DDT ... So, politically correct or not, I am very confident that what we are doing is the right strategy."<ref>{{

===Alternatives===

====Other insecticides====
{{Main|Indoor residual spraying}}
Advocates of increased use of DDT in IRS claim that alternative insecticides are more expensive, more toxic, or not as effective. As discussed above, susceptibility of mosquitoes to DDT varies geographically. The same is true for alternative insecticides, so its relative effectiveness varies. Toxicity and cost-effectiveness comparisons lack data. Relative insecticide costs vary by location and ease of access, the habits of the local mosquitoes, the degrees of resistance exhibited by the mosquitoes, and the habits and compliance of the population, among other factors. The choice of insecticide has little impact on the total cost of a round of spraying, since product costs are only a fraction of campaign costs. IRS coverage needs to be maintained throughout the malaria season, making DDT's relatively long life an important cost savings.

[[Organophosphate]] and [[carbamate]]  insecticides, ''e.g.'' [[malathion]] and [[bendiocarb]], respectively, are more expensive than DDT per kilogram and are applied at roughly the same dosage. [[Pyrethroid]]s such as [[deltamethrin]] are also more expensive than DDT, but are applied more sparingly (0.02–0.3&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup> vs 1–2&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup>), so the net cost per house is about the same over 6 months.<ref name="AmJTrop"/>

====Non-chemical vector control====
Before DDT, malaria was successfully eradicated or curtailed in several tropical areas by removing or poisoning mosquito breeding grounds and larva habitats, for example by filling or applying oil to standing water. These methods have seen little application in Africa for more than half a century.<ref>{{

The relative effectiveness of IRS (with DDT or alternative insecticides) versus other malaria control techniques (e.g. bednets or prompt access to anti-malarial drugs) varies greatly and is highly dependent on local conditions.<ref name="AmJTrop"/>

A WHO study released in January 2008 found that mass distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets and [[artemisinin]]–based drugs cut malaria deaths in half in Rwanda and Ethiopia, countries with high malaria burdens. IRS with DDT did not play an important role in mortality reduction in these countries.<ref>

In Mexico, effective and affordable chemical and non-chemical strategies against malaria have been so successful that the Mexican DDT manufacturing plant ceased production due to lack of demand.<ref name="PMC1119118">{{cite web| url=http://www.ipen.org/ipenweb/documents/work%20documents/ddt_ipenreport_english.pdf|title=DDT & Malaria| accessdate=2009-03-11|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5pt5PazSh |archivedate = 2010-05-21|deadurl=no}}</ref>

While the increased numbers of malaria victims since DDT usage collapsed document its value, many other factors contributed to the rise in cases.

A review of fourteen studies on the subject in sub-Saharan Africa, covering insecticide-treated nets, residual spraying, chemoprophylaxis for children, chemoprophylaxis or intermittent treatment for pregnant women, a hypothetical vaccine, and changing front–line drug treatment, found decision making limited by the gross lack of information on the costs and effects of many interventions, the very small number of cost-effectiveness analyses available, the lack of evidence on the costs and effects of packages of measures, and the problems in generalizing or comparing studies that relate to specific settings and use different methodologies and outcome measures. The two cost-effectiveness estimates of DDT residual spraying examined were not found to provide an accurate estimate of the cost-effectiveness of DDT spraying; furthermore, the resulting estimates may not be good predictors of cost-effectiveness in current programs.<ref>{{

However, a study in Thailand found the cost per malaria case prevented of DDT spraying ($1.87 US) to be 21% greater than the cost per case prevented of [[lambda-cyhalothrin]]–treated nets ($1.54 US),<ref>{{

The director of Mexico's malaria control program finds similar results, declaring that it is 25% cheaper for Mexico to spray a house with synthetic pyrethroids than with DDT.<ref name="PMC1119118"/> However, another study in South Africa found generally lower costs for DDT spraying than for impregnated nets.<ref>{{

A more comprehensive approach to measuring cost-effectiveness or efficacy of malarial control would not only measure the cost in dollars of the project, as well as the number of people saved, but would also consider ecological damage and negative aspects of insecticide use on human health. One preliminary study regarding the effect of DDT found that it is likely the detriment to human health approaches or exceeds the beneficial reductions in malarial cases, except perhaps in malarial epidemic situations. It is similar to the earlier mentioned study regarding estimated theoretical infant mortality caused by DDT and subject to the criticism also mentioned earlier.<ref>{{

A comparison of four successful programs against malaria in Brazil, India, Eritrea, and Vietnam does not endorse any single strategy but instead states, "Common success factors included conducive country conditions, a targeted technical approach using a package of effective tools, data-driven decision-making, active leadership at all levels of government, involvement of communities, decentralized implementation and control of finances, skilled technical and managerial capacity at national and sub-national levels, hands-on technical and programmatic support from partner agencies, and sufficient and flexible financing."<ref>{{

DDT resistant mosquitoes have generally proved susceptible to pyrethroids. Thus far, pyrethroid resistance in ''Anopheles'' has not been a major problem.<ref name = "Curtis"/>
