==History==
{{Main|History of Aberdeen}}
[[File:The Town House, Old Aberdeen - geograph.org.uk - 320069.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Town House, [[Old Aberdeen]]. Once a separate burgh, Old Aberdeen was incorporated into the city in 1891]]
[[File:Aberdeen1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Castlegate, Aberdeen|Castlegate]] and [[Union Street, Aberdeen|Union Street]] (c.1900)]]

The Aberdeen area has seen human settlement for at least 8,000 years.<ref name="prehistory" /> The city began as two separate [[burgh]]s: [[Old Aberdeen]] at the mouth of the river Don; and New Aberdeen, a fishing and trading settlement, where the Denburn waterway entered the river Dee estuary. The earliest [[charter]] was granted by [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]] in 1179 and confirmed the corporate rights granted by [[David I of Scotland|David I]]. In 1319, the Great Charter of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] transformed Aberdeen into a property-owning and financially independent community. Granted with it was the nearby [[Forest of Stocket]], whose income formed the basis for the city's [[Common Good Fund (Aberdeen)|Common Good Fund]] which still benefits Aberdonians.<ref name="keith">{{Cite book|author=Keith, Alexander|year=1987|title=A Thousand Years of Aberdeen |publisher=Aberdeen University Press}}</ref><ref name="fraser">{{Cite book|first=W. Hamish|last=Fraser|title=Aberdeen, 1800 to 2000: A New History |year=2000 |publisher=Tuckwell Press |location=Edinburgh}}</ref>
During the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], Aberdeen was under English rule, so [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] laid siege to [[Aberdeen Castle]] before destroying it in 1308 followed by the massacring of the English garrison and the retaking of Aberdeen for the townspeople. The city was burned by [[Edward III of England]] in 1336, but was rebuilt and extended, and called New Aberdeen. The city was strongly fortified to prevent attacks by neighbouring lords, but the gates were removed by 1770.
[[File:The Powis gate Old Aberdeen - geograph.org.uk - 421948.jpg|thumb|upright|The Powis gate Old Aberdeen]]

During the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] of 1644–1647 the city was plundered by both sides. In 1644, it was taken and ransacked by Royalist troops after the [[Battle of Aberdeen (1644)|Battle of Aberdeen]]<ref>{{Cite book|first=Chris |last=Brown |title=The Battle of Aberdeen 1644|year=2002|publisher=Tempus Publishing |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire}}</ref> and two years later [[Battle of Aberdeen (1646)|it was stormed]] by a Royalist force under the command of [[George Gordon, 2nd Marquis of Huntly|Marquis of Huntly]].<ref>{{Cite DNB|ref=harv|last=Henderson |first=Thomas Finlayson |wstitle=Gordon, George (d.1649)  |volume=22 |pages=190–194}}</ref> In 1647 an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] killed a quarter of the population. In the 18th century, a new Town Hall was built and the first social services appeared with the [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary|Infirmary]] at [[Woolmanhill Hospital|Woolmanhill]] in 1742 and the Lunatic Asylum in 1779. The council began major road improvements at the end of the 18th century with the main thoroughfares of [[George Street, Aberdeen|George Street]], [[King Street, Aberdeen|King Street]] and [[Union Street, Aberdeen|Union Street]] all completed at the beginning of the 19th century.
[[File:Union Terrace Aberdeen Scotland.jpg|thumb|left|Union Terrace, Aberdeen, circa 1900]]

The expensive infrastructure works led to the city becoming bankrupt in 1817. However, recovery came with the prosperity that followed the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic wars]]. The increasing economic importance of Aberdeen and the development of the shipbuilding and fishing industries led to the construction of the present harbour including Victoria Dock and the South Breakwater, and the extension of the North Pier. Gas street lighting arrived in 1824 and an enhanced water supply appeared in 1830 when water was pumped from the Dee to a reservoir in Union Place. An underground sewer system replaced open sewers in 1865.<ref name="fraser" /> The city was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1891. Although Old Aberdeen has a separate history and still holds its ancient charter, it is no longer officially independent. It is an integral part of the city, as is Woodside and the [[Royal Burgh]] of [[Torry]] to the south of the River Dee.

===Toponymy===
{{Main|Etymology of Aberdeen}}
Old Aberdeen is the approximate location of ''Aberdon'' the first settlement of Aberdeen; this literally means "at the confluence of the Don [ie. with the sea]" in relation to the local river. The modern name Aberdeen literally means between the Dee (the other local river) and Don. The [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] prefix; "Aber-" means "the confluence of" in relation to the rivers.<ref name="Charnock">{{Cite book|first=Richard Stephen |last=Charnock|title=Local Etymology: A Derivative Dictionary of Geographical Names|year= 1859|publisher=Houlston and Wright}}</ref>

Some scholars believe the name came from the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] prefix ''Aber-'' and ''da-aevi'' (variation;''Da-abhuin'', ''Da-awin'') - which means "the mouth of two rivers". In Gaelic the name is ''Obar Dheathain'' (variation; ''Obairreadhain'') and in [[Latin]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] referred to it as ''Devana''. Mediaeval (or ecclesiastical) Latin has it as ''Aberdonia''.  In the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] language Aber means mouth and is a very common name comprising the name of the river such as [[Abertawe]], [[Aberdyfi]], [[Aberystwyth]].

Aberdeen is locally governed by the [[Aberdeen City Council]], which comprises forty-three councillors who represent the city's [[ward (politics)|wards]] and is headed by the [[List of Provosts and Lord Provosts of Aberdeen|Lord Provost]]. The current Lord Provost is George Adam.
From May 2003 until May 2007 the council was run by a [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] coalition. Following the May 2007 elections the Liberal Democrats formed a new coalition with the [[Scottish National Party]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6654023.stm |title=Lib Dems and SNP in Aberdeen deal |work=BBC News Online |date=14 May 2007}}</ref> In May 2007 the council consisted of: 15 Liberal Democrat, 13 SNP, 10 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], 4 Conservative councillors and a single independent councillor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/acci/web/site/xac_Councillor.asp?s=3 |title=Aberdeen City Councillors|publisher=Aberdeen City Council|accessdate=8 February 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070211004932/http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/acci/web/site/xac_Councillor.asp?s=3| archivedate= 11 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> After an SNP by-election gain from the Conservatives on 16 August 2007, the Lib Dem/SNP coalition held 28 of the 43 seats. In August 2009 a councillor resigned from the Liberal Democrats and became an independent. The Conservative Group split in August 2010 with two councillors forming the Aberdeen Conservatives. All four Conservatives remain recognised as Conservatives by the party nationally. Following the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2012|election of 3 May 2012]], the council is controlled by a coalition of centre-left [[Scottish Labour Party|Scottish Labour]], centre-right [[Scottish Conservative Party|Scottish Conservative]] and [[Independent (politician)|independent]]  councillors.<ref>{{cite web|last=McKay |first=David |url=http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/2762884 |title=Team of unlikely bedfellows join forces to seize power |publisher=Pressandjournal.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref>

Aberdeen is represented in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] by three [[constituencies]]: [[Aberdeen North (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen North]], [[Aberdeen South (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen South]] and [[Gordon (UK Parliament constituency)|Gordon]], of which the first two are wholly within the Aberdeen City council area while the latter also encompasses a large swathe of [[Aberdeenshire]]. In the [[Scottish Parliament]] the city is represented by three constituencies with different boundaries: [[Aberdeen Central (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen Central]], [[Aberdeen Donside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen Donside]] and [[Aberdeen South and North Kincardine (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen South and North Kincardine]]. The first two are wholly within the Aberdeen City council area, and the latter encompasses the North [[Kincardine]] ward of [[Aberdeenshire Council]]. A further seven MSPs are elected as part of the [[North East Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|North East Scotland]] electoral region. In the [[European Parliament]] the city is represented by six [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] as part of the all-inclusive Scotland constituency.

[[File:Lamp-posts along the B9077 - geograph.org.uk - 833415.jpg|thumb|left|Lamp-posts bearing Bon Accord Coat of Arms]]
Symbols of the city typically show three castles, such as in the case of the flag and coat of arms. The image has been around since the time of [[Robert the Bruce]] and represents the buildings that stood on the three hills of Aberdeen; Aberdeen Castle on Castle Hill (today's [[Castlegate, Aberdeen|Castlegate]]); an unknown building on Windmill Hill and a church on St. Catherine's Hill (now levelled).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councilfirst1.html |title=Aberdeen City|accessdate=15 May 2007|author=Gazetter for Scotland}}</ref>

"''Bon Accord''" is the [[motto]] of the city and is French literally for "Good Agreement". Legend tells that its use dates from the 14th century password used by Robert the Bruce during the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], when he and his men laid siege to Aberdeen Castle before destroying it in 1308.<ref name="keith" /> The [[leopard]] has traditionally been associated with the city and its emblem can be seen on the city crest. The local magazine is called the "Leopard" and, when Union Bridge was widened in the 20th century, small statues of the creature in a sitting position were cast and placed on top of the railing posts (known locally as Kelly's Cats). The city's toast is "Happy to meet, sorry to part, happy to meet again"; this has been commonly misinterpreted as the translation of Bon Accord.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-publishing.com/Pages/AberdeenOG/introducing.html|title=Aberdeen Official Guide|publisher=Aberdeen City Council|accessdate=17 February 2007}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Aberdeen}}
[[File:Aberdeen Coast light house.JPG|thumb|Aberdeen Coast]]
[[File:Aberdeen Beach 2006.jpg|thumb|Aberdeen Beach]]
Being sited between two river mouths, the city has little natural exposure of bedrock. This leaves local geologists in a slight quandary: despite the high concentration of geoscientists in the area (courtesy of the oil industry), there is only a vague understanding of what underlies the city. To the south side of the city, coastal cliffs expose high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Grampian Group; to the south-west and west are extensive granites intruded into similar high-grade schists; to the north the metamorphics are intruded by gabbroic complexes instead. The small amount of geophysics done, and occasional building-related exposures, combined with small exposures in the banks of the River Don, suggest that it's actually sited on an inlier of Devonian "Old Red" sandstones and silts. The outskirts of the city spread beyond the (inferred) limits of the outlier onto the surrounding metamorphic/ igneous complexes formed during the [[Dalradian]] period (approximately 480-600 million years ago) with sporadic areas of [[igneous rock|igneous]] [[Diorite]] granites to be found, such as that at the [[Rubislaw quarry]] which was used to build much of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] parts of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councildetails1.html |title=Details of Aberdeen City |author=Gazetter for Scotland|accessdate=10 April 2007}}</ref>

On the coast, Aberdeen has a long sand beach between the two rivers, the [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|Dee]] and the [[River Don, Aberdeenshire|Don]], which turns into high [[sand dunes]] north of the Don stretching as far as [[Fraserburgh]]; to the south of the Dee are steep rocky cliff faces with only minor pebble and shingle beaches in deep inlets. A number of granite outcrops along the south coast have been quarried in the past, making for spectacular scenery and good rock-climbing.

The city extends to {{convert|184.46|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},<ref name="dbjrij">{{cite web|url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files/05mype-cahb-t9.pdf|title=Land Area and Population Density |author=General Register for Scotland|accessdate=12 March 2007|format=PDF}}</ref> and includes the former burghs of Old Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, [[Woodside, Aberdeen|Woodside]] and the [[Royal Burgh]] of [[Torry]] to the south of [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|River Dee]]. In {{Scottish council populations|TXT=Year}} this gave the city a population density of {{Scottish council populations|DEN=00QA}}.<ref name="population">{{Scottish council populations|TXT=Cite}}</ref> The city is built on many hills, with the original beginnings of the city growing from Castle Hill, St. Catherine's Hill and Windmill Hill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councilfirst1.html |title=Aberdeen City |publisher=The Gazetteer for Scotland|accessdate=20 February 2007}}</ref>

===Climate===
Aberdeen features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb''). Aberdeen is far milder than one might expect for its northern location, although statistically it is the coldest city in the UK. During the winter, especially throughout December, the length of the day is very short, averaging 6 hours and 40 minutes between sunrise and sunset at winter solstice. As winter progresses, the length of the day grows fairly quickly, to 8 hours and 20 minutes by the end of January. Around summer solstice, the days will be around 18 hours long, having 17 hours and 57 minutes between sunrise and sunset, with [[nautical twilight]] lasting the entire night. Temperatures at this time of year will be typically hovering around {{convert|17.0|C|F}} during the day in most of the urban area, though nearer {{convert|16.0|C|F}} directly on the coast, and around {{convert|18.0|C|F}} to {{convert|19.0|C|F}} in the westernmost suburbs,<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[MetOffice]] | url= http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/escotland/7100_1km/MaxTemp_Average_1971-2000_7.gif
 | title = July temp map}}</ref> illustrating the cooling effect of the North Sea during summer.

Two weather stations collect climate data for the area, Aberdeen Dyce airport, and Craibstone. Both are about 4.5 miles to the North West of the city centre, and given that they are in close proximity to each other, not surprisingly exhibit very similar climatic regimes. Dyce tends to have marginally warmer daytime temperature's year round owing to its slightly lower elevation, though is more susceptible to harsh frosts. The coldest temperature to occur in recent years was {{convert|-16.8|C|F}} during December 2010,<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[Tutiempo]] | url= http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/Aberdeen_Dyce/03-12-2010/30910.htm

[[Christianity]] is the main religion practiced in the city. Aberdeen's largest denominations are the [[Church of Scotland]] (through the [[Presbytery of Aberdeen]]) and the [[Roman Catholic Church]], both with numerous churches across the city, with the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] having the third-largest number. The most recent census in 2001 showed that Aberdeen has the highest proportion of non-religious residents of any city in Scotland, with nearly 43% of citizens claiming to have no religion<ref name="citycensusreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.asp?lID=1726&sID=332|title=2001 Census: Key Statistics - Aberdeen City |author=Aberdeen City Council|accessdate=28 February 2007}}</ref> and several former churches in the city have been converted into bars and restaurants.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080120092254rn_1/thescotsman.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2777998 |title=Minister thrown out of trendy nightclub that used to be his church |newspaper=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh |date=24 May 2006}}</ref>{{dead link|date=May 2013}} In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Kirk of St Nicholas, Aberdeen|Kirk of St Nicholas]] was the only burgh kirk and one of Scotland's largest parish churches. Like a number of other Scottish kirks, it was subdivided after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], in this case into the East and West churches. At this time, the city also was home to houses of the [[Carmelites]] (Whitefriars) and [[Franciscans]] (Greyfriars), the latter of which surviving in modified form as the chapel of Marischal College as late as the early 20th century.

[[File:Gilcomston South Church, Aberdeen.jpeg|thumb|upright|Gilcomston South Church, Union Street, Aberdeen]]

[[St Machar's Cathedral]] was formed twenty years after [[David I of Scotland|David I]] (1124–53) transferred the pre-Reformation [[Diocese]] from Mortlach in [[Banffshire]] to Old Aberdeen in 1137. With the exception of the episcopate of [[William Elphinstone]] (1484–1511), building progressed slowly. [[Gavin Dunbar (Bishop of Aberdeen)|Gavin Dunbar]], who followed him in 1518, completed the structure by adding the two western spires and the southern transept. It is now a congregation of the [[Church of Scotland]]. Aberdeen has two other cathedrals; [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Aberdeen|St. Mary's Cathedral]] is a [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral in [[Gothic style]], erected in 1859. In addition, [[St. Andrew's Cathedral, Aberdeen|St. Andrew's Cathedral]] serves the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]]. It was constructed in 1817 as Archibald Simpson's first commission and contains a memorial to the consecration of the first bishop of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], which took place nearby.
[[File:St Andrew's Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 401628.jpg|thumb|left|[[St. Andrew's Cathedral, Aberdeen|St Andrew's Cathedral]], King Street]]
Numerous other Protestant denominations have a presence in Aberdeen. [[The Salvation Army]] citadel on the Castlegate dominates the view of east end of Union Street. In addition, there is a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church, established in 1833 and located in Skene Terrace. [[Christadelphians]] have been present in Aberdeen since at least 1844. Over the years, they have rented space to meet at a number of locations and currently meet in the Inchgarth Community Centre in Garthdee.<ref>'[http://ukchristadelphians.org.uk/info.asp?act=ecc&id=3 Aberdeen]' on ''Find your local Christadelphians''</ref> There is also a [[Quaker]] meetinghouse on Crown street, the only purpose built [[Quaker House]] in Scotland that is still in use today. In addition, there are a number of Baptist congregations in the city, and [[evangelical]] congregations have been appearing in significant numbers since the late 2000s.
The city also has two meetinghouses of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]].

There is also a [[mosque]] in Old Aberdeen which serves the Islamic community in the city, and an Orthodox Jewish Synagogue which was established in 1945. There are no formal [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] or [[Hinduism|Hindu]] buildings, although the [[University of Aberdeen]] has a small [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] society and there is a fortnightly Hindu religious gathering in the 1st and 3rd Sunday afternoons at Queens Cross Parish church hall.<ref>{{cite web|last=Aberdeen Hindu Association|url=http://www.aberdeentemple.org.uk/home.html}}</ref>

{{Main|Economy of Aberdeen|Petroleum industry in Aberdeen}}
Traditionally, Aberdeen was home to fishing, textile mills, shipbuilding and paper making. These industries have been largely replaced. High technology developments in the electronics design and development industry, research in agriculture and fishing and the [[oil industry]], which has been largely responsible for Aberdeen's economic boom in the last three decades, are now major parts of Aberdeen's economy.
Until the 1970s, most of Aberdeen's leading industries dated from the 18th century; mainly these were textiles, foundry work, shipbuilding and [[paper]]-making, the oldest industry in the city, with paper having been first made there in 1694. Paper-making has reduced in importance since the closures of Donside Paper Mill in 2001 and the Davidson Mill in 2005 leaving the [[Paper mills of Aberdeen|Stoneywood Paper Mill]] with a workforce of approximately 500. Textile production ended in 2004 when [[Richards of Aberdeen]] closed.

Grey granite was [[quarry|quarried]] at [[Rubislaw quarry]] for more than 300 years, and used for paving setts, kerb and building stones, and monumental and other ornamental pieces. Aberdeen granite was used to build the terraces of the [[Houses of Parliament]] and [[Waterloo Bridge]] in London. Quarrying finally ceased in 1971. The current owners have begun pumping 40 years worth of rain water from the quarry with the aim of developing a heritage centre on the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19296757|title=Water pumping work starts at Rubislaw Quarry in Aberdeen|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>

Fishing was once the predominant industry, but was surpassed by deep-sea fisheries, which derived a great impetus from improved technologies throughout the 20th century. Catches have fallen due to overfishing and the use of the harbour by oil support vessels,<ref name="harbour">{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeen-harbour.co.uk/history.html|title=Aberdeen Harbour: A History of Service |publisher=Aberdeen Harbour Board|accessdate=18 February 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070403194640/http://www.aberdeen-harbour.co.uk/history.html| archivedate= 3 April 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and so although still an important fishing port it is now eclipsed by the more northerly ports of [[Peterhead]] and Fraserburgh. The [[Fisheries Research Services]] are headquartered in Aberdeen, and there is a marine research lab in Torry.

Aberdeen is well regarded for the agricultural and soil research carried out at [[The James Hutton Institute]] (formerly the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute), which has close links to the city's two universities.

As oil reserves in the North Sea decrease there is an effort to rebrand Aberdeen as ''Energy Capital of Europe'' rather than ''Oil Capital of Europe'' and interest in the development of new energy sources; and technology transfer from oil into renewable energy and other industries is under way. The "Energetica" initiative led by Scottish Enterprise has been designed to accelerate this process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3236703.stm |title=A burst of energy in Europe's oil capital |work=BBC News Online|date=12 November 2003}}</ref> As of 2013, Aberdeen remained a major world center for undersea petroleum technology.<ref name=NYT72813>{{cite news|title=Aberdeen, a City With One Foot on the Seafloor|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/business/global/aberdeen-a-city-with-one-foot-on-the-seafloor.html|accessdate=August 29, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 28, 2013|author=Stanley Reed}}</ref>

===Aberdeen and the North Sea===
Aberdeen had been a major maritime centre throughout the 19th century, when a group of local entrepreneurs launched the first steam-powered trawler. The steam trawling industry expanded and by 1933 Aberdeen was Scotland's top fishing port, employing nearly 3,000 men with 300 vessels sailing from its harbour. By the time oil was coming on stream, much of the trawling fleet had relocated to Peterhead. Although Aberdeen still brings in substantial catches, the tugs, safety vessels and supply ships which pack the harbour far outnumber the trawlers.
[[File:3rd Aug 2012- Abdn Harbour 2.JPG|thumb|left|Aberdeen Harbour with Supply Vessels]]
Geologists had speculated about the existence of oil and gas in the North Sea since the middle of the 20th century, but tapping its deep and inhospitable waters was another story. However, with the Middle Eastern oil sheiks becoming more aware of the political and economic power of their oil reserves and government threats of rationing, the industry began to consider the North Sea as a viable source of oil. Exploration commenced in the 1960s and the first major find in the British sector was in November 1970 in the Forties field, 110 miles east of Aberdeen.

By late 1975, after years of intense construction the necessary infrastructure was in place. In Aberdeen, at BP's (British Petroleum) headquarters, the Queen pressed the button that would set the whole thing moving. Oil flowed from the rig directly to the refinery at far-away Grangemouth. While many ports suffered decline, Aberdeen remains busy due to oil trade as the influx of people connected with the industry, and a subsequent rise in property prices has brought prosperity to the area.

The industry still supports about 47,000 jobs locally and known reserves are such that oil will continue to flow well into the 21st century.

Aberdeen City and Shire's Gross Domestic Product is estimated at over £11.4billion, accounting for over 17% of the overall Scottish GDP. Five of Scotland's top ten businesses are based in Aberdeen with a collective turnover of £14billion, yielding a profit in excess of £2.4billion. Alongside this 29 of Scotland's top 100 businesses are located in Aberdeen with an employment rate of 77.9%, making it the 2nd highest UK city for employment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeeninvestlivevisit.co.uk/Invest/Facts-and-Literature/Invest-Facts-and-Literature.aspx|title=Invest Aberdeen Facts & Figures|publisher=Aberdeen Invest Live Vist|accessdate=21 September 2013}}</ref>

===Shopping===

Aberdeen's [[architecture]] is known for its principal use during the Victorian era of [[granite]], which has led to its local [[nickname]] of the ''Granite City'' or more romantically the less commonly used name the ''Silver City'', since the [[Mica]] in the stone sparkles in the sun. The hard grey stone is one of the most durable materials available and helps to explain why the city's buildings look brand-new when they have been newly cleaned and the cement has been pointed. Unlike other Scottish cities where [[sandstone]] has been used, the buildings are not weathering and need very little structural maintenance on their masonry.

Amongst the notable buildings in the city's main street, [[Union Street, Aberdeen|Union Street]], are the Town and County Bank, the [[The Music Hall (Aberdeen)|Music Hall]], the [[Seven Incorporated Trades of Aberdeen|Trinity Hall of the incorporated trades]] (originating between 1398 and 1527), now a shopping mall; the former office of the Northern Assurance Company, and the [[National Bank of Scotland]]. In Castle Street, a continuation eastwards of Union Street, is the new Town House, a very prominent landmark in Aberdeen, built between 1868 and 1873 to a design by Peddie and Kinnear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst6629.html  |title=Overview of Town House |publisher=Geo.ed.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=25 June 2009}}</ref>

Aberdeen's success in the Britain in Bloom competitions is often attributed to [[Johnston Gardens]], a small park of one hectare in the west end of the city containing many different flowers and plants which have been renowned for their beauty. The garden was in 2002, named the best garden in the [[British Islands]].<ref name="floral" /> [[Seaton Park]], formerly the grounds of a private house, is on the edge of the grounds of [[St Machar's Cathedral]]. The Cathedral Walk is maintained in a formal style with a great variety of plants providing a popular display. The park includes several other areas with contrasting styles to this. [[Union Terrace Gardens]] opened in 1879 and is situated in the centre of the city. It covers {{convert|2.5|acre|m2}} in the centre of Aberdeen bordered on three sides by Union Street, Union Terrace and Rosemount Viaduct. The park forms a natural amphitheatre located in the Denburn Valley and is an oasis of peace and calm in the city centre. A recent proposal to build a three storey concrete and steel superstructure in place of the gardens, part of which will provide a commercial concourse, has proved highly controversial.

Situated next to each other, [[Victoria Park, Aberdeen|Victoria Park]] and [[Westburn Park]] cover {{convert|26|acre|m2}} between them. [[Victoria Park, Aberdeen|Victoria Park]] opened in 1871. There is a conservatory used as a seating area and a fountain made of fourteen different granites, presented to the people by the granite polishers and master builders of Aberdeen. Opposite to the north is [[Westburn Park]] opened in 1901. With large grass pitches it is widely used for field sports. There is large tennis centre with indoor and outdoor courts, a children's cycle track, play area and a grass boules lawn.

[[File:Scot-Aberdeen-rail.jpg|thumb|Aberdeen Railway Station, main concourse]]

[[Aberdeen Airport]] (ABZ), at Dyce in the north of the city, serves a number of domestic and international destinations including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Ireland and Scandinavian countries. The heliport which serves the oil industry and rescue services is one of the busiest commercial heliports in the world.<ref name="BAA"/> [[Aberdeen railway station]] is on the main UK rail network and First Scotrail has frequent direct trains to major cities such as [[Edinburgh]], Glasgow and Inverness.  East Coast has trains to London. First Scotrail operate the overnight [[Caledonian Sleeper]] train. The station is currently being updated to bring it into the modern age. In 2007 additions were made and a new ticket office was built in the building. The UK's longest direct rail journey runs from Aberdeen to Penzance. It is operated by [[CrossCountry]], leaving Aberdeen at 08:20 and taking 13 hours and 23 minutes to complete.

Until 2007, a 1950s-style concrete bus station at Guild Street served out-of-the-city locations; it has since transferred to a new and well-presented bus station just 100 metres to the east off Market Street as part of the [[Union Square Aberdeen|Union Square]] development. There are six major roads in and out of the city. The A90 is the main arterial route into the city from the north and south, linking Aberdeen to Edinburgh, [[Dundee]], [[Brechin]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in the south and [[Ellon, Aberdeenshire|Ellon]], [[Peterhead]] and Fraserburgh in the north. The A96 links [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] and [[Inverness]] and the north west. The A93 is the main route to the west, heading towards Royal Deeside and the [[Cairngorms]]. After [[Braemar]], it turns south, providing an alternative tourist route to Perth. The A944 also heads west, through [[Westhill, Aberdeenshire|Westhill]] and on to [[Alford, Aberdeenshire|Alford]]. The A92 was the original southerly road to Aberdeen prior to the building of the A90, and is now used as a tourist route, connecting the towns of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] and [[Arbroath]] and on the east coast. The A947 exits the city at Dyce and goes on to [[Newmachar]], [[Oldmeldrum]] and [[Turriff]] finally ending at [[Banff, Aberdeenshire|Banff]] and [[Macduff, Aberdeenshire|Macduff]].

===Universities and colleges===
Aberdeen has two universities, the ancient '''[[University of Aberdeen]]''', and '''[[The Robert Gordon University]]''', a modern university often referred to as [[The Robert Gordon University|RGU]]. Aberdeen's student rate of 11.5% is higher than the national average of 7%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrol.gov.uk/scrol/browser/profile.jsp?profile=Education&mainLevel=CouncilArea&mainArea=Aberdeen+City&mainText=&mainTextExplicitMatch=null&compLevel=CountryProfile&compArea=Scotland&compText=&compTextExplicitMatch=null|title=Comparative Education Profile: Aberdeen City Council Area, Scotland|accessdate=21 February 2007}}</ref>

[[File:10th Aug 2012- Abdn Business Skool.JPG|thumb|Aberdeen Business School at the Robert Gordon University]]

The [[University of Aberdeen]] began as [[King's College, Aberdeen]], which was founded in 1495<ref name=EB/> by [[William Elphinstone]] (1431–1514), [[Bishop of Aberdeen]] and Chancellor of Scotland. [[Marischal College]], a separate institution, was founded in "New" Aberdeen by George Keith, fifth Earl Marischal of Scotland in 1593.<ref name=EB/> These institutions were merged by order of Parliament in 1860 to form the University of Aberdeen.<ref name=EB/> The university is the fifth oldest in the English-speaking world<ref name="university">{{Cite book|first=Jennifer|last=Carter|title=Crown and Gown: Illustrated History of the University of Aberdeen, 1495–1995|year=1994|location=Aberdeen|publisher=Aberdeen University Press}}</ref> and offers degrees in a full range of disciplines. Its main campus is in Old Aberdeen in the north of the city and it currently has approximately 14,000 students.  The university's debating society is the oldest in Scotland, founded in 1848 as the King's College Debating Society.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aberdeen University Debater|url=http://www.thedebater.org/about|publisher=Aberdeen University Debater|accessdate=2013-02-13}}</ref>

[[Robert Gordon's College]] (originally Robert Gordon's Hospital) was founded in 1750 by the merchant [[Robert Gordon (philanthropist)|Robert Gordon]],<ref name=EB/> grandson of the map maker Robert Gordon of Straloch, and was further endowed in 1816 by Alexander Simpson of Collyhill. Originally devoted to the instruction and maintenance of the sons of poor burgesses of guild and trade in the city, it was reorganised in 1881 as a day and night school for secondary and technical education. In 1903, the vocational education component of the college was designated a [[Central Institution]] and was renamed as the Robert Gordon Institute of Technology in 1965. In 1992, university status was awarded and it became [[The Robert Gordon University]]. The university has expanded and developed significantly in recent years, and was named Best Modern University in the UK for 2012 by ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. It was previously ''The Sunday Times'' Scottish University of the Year for 2011, primarily due to its record on graduate employment. The citation for the 2011 award read: "''With a graduate unemployment rate that is lower than the most famous universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, plus a flourishing reputation for research, high student satisfaction rates and ambitious plans for its picturesque campus, the Robert Gordon University is The Sunday Times Scottish University of the Year''".<ref>The Sunday Times, 12 September 2010 (subscription only)</ref> RGU had two campuses: one in the city centre at Schoolhill/St. Andrew Street and a larger suburban campus at [[Garthdee]] and currently has approximately 15,500 students. As of 2013, the Garthdee campus was expanded to include all schools, with the Schoolhill/St. Andrew Street campus being sold to unknown buyers.  The closure of the Schoolhill site includes the removal of the Student Union building, giving Aberdeen the nebulous distinction of having two universities but no student bar.
