'''Ahuitzotl''' ({{lang-nah|āhuizotl}}, {{IPA-nah|aːˈwisot͡ɬ|pron}}) (meaning roughly "water dog"<ref>[http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/names/natamnames2.htm Thousands of AZTEC, INCAN, AMAZONIAN & MAYAN & OTHER CENTRAL & LATIN AMERICAN NAMES for your dog, horse, cat, pet or child from Chinaroad Lowchens of Australia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>) was the eighth  [[Aztec]] ruler, the ''[[Hueyi Tlatoani]]'' of the city of [[Tenochtitlan]], son of princess [[Atotoztli II]]. He was responsible for much of the expansion of the Mexica domain, and consolidated the empire's power after emulating his predecessor. He took power as [[tlatoani]] in the year [[Aztec calendar|7 Rabbit]] (1486), after the death of his predecessor and brother, [[Tizoc]].

His sons were kings [[Chimalpilli II]] and [[Cuauhtémoc]] and he also had one daughter.

== Biography ==
Perhaps the greatest known military leader of [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], Ahuizotl began his reign by suppressing a [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]] rebellion, and then swiftly more than doubled the size of lands under Aztec dominance. He conquered the [[Mixtec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], and other peoples from Mexico's [[Pacific coast]] down to the western part of [[Guatemala]]. Ahuizotl also supervised a major rebuilding of Tenochtitlan on a grander scale including the expansion of the Great Pyramid or [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan|Templo Mayor]] in the year [[Aztec calendar|8 Reed]] (1487).

He presided over the introduction of the [[Great-tailed Grackle]] into the Valley of Mexico, the earliest documented case of human-mediated bird introduction in the Western Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Introduction of the Great-tailed Grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus) by Aztec Emperor Auitzotl: Provenance of the historical account (La Introducción de la Quiscalus mexicanus por el Emperador Azteca Auitzotl: Origen del Relato Histórico)|first=Paul D.|last=Haemig|work=The Auk|

Ahuizotl died in the year [[Aztec calendar|10 Rabbit]] (1502) and was succeeded by his nephew, [[Moctezuma II]].

Ahuizotl took his name from the [[Ahuizotl (creature)|animal Ahuizotl]], which the Aztecs considered to be a legendary creature in its own right rather than a mere mythical representation of the king.

On 3 August 2007, Mexican archaeologists announced discovery of what is believed to be the [[tomb]] of Ahuizotl beneath a sculpture of [[Tlaltecuhtli]] near the [[Plaza de la Constitución|Zócalo in Mexico City]].<ref>http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/wire/sns-ap-mexico-aztec-tomb-summary-box,0,1155875.story  {{Wayback|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/wire/sns-ap-mexico-aztec-tomb-summary-box,0,1155875.story|date =20110605042757}}</ref><ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/04/america/LA-GEN-Mexico-Aztec-Tomb.php AP Exclusive: Archaeologists locate what they believe are funeral chambers of Aztec emperor - International Herald Tribune]</ref>
