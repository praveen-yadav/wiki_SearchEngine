HH '''Abbas II Hilmi''' '''Bey''' (also known as '''Abbas Hilmi [[Pasha]]''') ({{lang-ar|<big>عباس حلمي باشا</big>}}) (14 July 1874 &ndash; 19 December 1944) was the last [[Khedive]] of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] (8 January 1892 &ndash; 19 December 1914).<ref>[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, p. 1</ref>

==Early life==
Abbas II was the great-great-grandson of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], was born on 14 July 1874.<ref name=rulers>{{cite web|title=Abbas Hilmi Pasha|url=http://rulers.org/indexa1.html|publisher=Rulers|accessdate=13 March 2013}}</ref> He succeeded his father, [[Tewfik Pasha]], as [[Khedive]] of Egypt and Sudan on 8 January 1892. As a boy he visited the United Kingdom, and he had a number of British tutors in Cairo including a governess who taught him English.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=10}} In a profile of Abbas II, the boys' annual Chums gives a lengthy account of his education.{{sfn|Pemberton|1897|loc=Abbas II}} His father established a small school near the Abdin Palace where European, Arab and Turkish masters taught Abbas and his brother Prince Mehemet Ali.  An American officer in the Egyptian army took charge of his military training.  He attended school at [[Lausanne]],<ref name=Colliers>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Vucinich|first1=Wayne S.|editor-first=Bernard|editor-last=Johnston|encyclopedia=Collier's Encyclopedia |title=Abbas II|edition=First |year=1997|publisher=P.F. Collier|volume=I A to Ameland|location=New York, NY|pages=7}}</ref> then at the age of twelve he was sent to the Haxius School in Geneva,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}<!--Probably in Chums (Pemberton) but needs checking as EB1911 does not mention Abdin Palace and places his Swiss school in Lausanne--> in preparation for his entry into the [[Theresian Military Academy|Theresianum]] in [[Vienna]]. In addition to [[Arabic]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], he had good conversational knowledge of English, French and German.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=10}}<ref name=Colliers/>

==Reign==
He was still in college in Vienna when he assumed the throne of the [[Khedivate of Egypt]] upon the sudden death of his father. He was barely of age according to Egyptian law; eighteen in cases of succession to the throne.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=10}} For some time he did not cooperate very cordially with the United Kingdom, (whose army had occupied Egypt in 1882).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=10}} As he was young and eager to exercise his new power, he resented the interference of the British Agent and Consul General in Cairo, Sir [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Evelyn Baring]], later made [[Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]].<ref name=Colliers/> At the outset of his reign, Khedive Abbas surrounded himself with a coterie of European advisers who opposed the British occupation of Egypt and Sudan and encouraged the young Khedive to challenge Cromer by replacing his ailing prime minister with a nationalist. At Cromer's behest, Lord Rosebery, the British foreign secretary, sent him a letter stating that the Khedive was obliged to consult the British consul on such issues as cabinet appointments.  In January 1894 Abbas, while on an inspection tour of Egyptian army installations near the southern border, the Mahdists being at the time still in control of Sudan, made public remarks disparaging the Egyptian army units commanded by British officers. The British commander of the Egyptian army, Sir [[Herbert Kitchener]], immediately offered to resign. Cromer strongly supported Kitchener and pressed the Khedive and prime minister to retract the Khedive's criticisms of the British officers.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}<!--For everything since the last citation--> 

From that time on, Abbas no longer publicly opposed the British, but secretly created, supported, and sustained the nationalist movement, which came to be led by [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]]. He also funded the anti-British newspaper [[Al-Mu'ayyad (newspaper)|Al-Mu'ayyad]].<ref name=EB/> As Kamil's thrust was increasingly aimed at winning popular support for a National Party, Khedive Abbas publicly distanced himself from the Nationalists. Their demand for a constitutional government was rebuffed by Abbas, and the following year he formed the [[National Party (Egypt)|National Party]], lead by [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha]], to counter the [[Ummah Party]] of the moderates.<ref name=EB/> However in general he had no real political power. When the Egyptian Army was sent to fight the Madhi he only found out about it because the Austro-Hungarian Archduke Francis Ferdinand was in Egypt and told him after being informed by a British Army officer about it.{{sfn|Morris|1968|207}}

In time he came to accept British counsels. In 1899 British diplomat [[Alfred Mitchell-Innes]] was appointed Under-Secretary of State for Finance in Egypt, and in 1900 Abbas paid a second visit to Britain, during which he said he thought the British had done good work in Egypt, and declared himself ready to cooperate with the British officials administering Egypt and Sudan. He gave his formal approval for the establishment of a sound system of native justice, a great reduction in taxation, increased affordable and sound education, the inauguration of the substantial irrigation works at [[Aswan Low Dam|Aswan]] and [[Assiut Barrage|Assiut]], and the reconquest of [[Sudan]].<ref name=Colliers/> He displayed more interest in [[agriculture]] than in statecraft. His farm of cattle and horses at [[Qubbah]], near Cairo, was a model for [[scientific farming|scientific agriculture]] in Egypt, and he created a similar establishment at [[Montaza Palace|Muntazah]], near [[Alexandria]]. He married the Princess [[Ikbal Hanem]] and had several children. [[Prince Muhammad Abdul Moneim|Muhammad Abdul Mun'im]], the heir-apparent, was born on 20 February 1899. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}<!--For all the information in the paragraph-->

His relations with Cromer's successor, Sir [[Eldon Gorst]], were excellent, and they co-operated in appointing the cabinets headed by [[Boutros Ghali|Butrus Ghali]] in 1908 and [[Muhammad Said Pasha|Muhammad Sa'id]] in 1910 and in checking the power of the Nationalist Party. The appointment of Kitchener to succeed Gorst in 1911 displeased Abbas, and relations between him and the British deteriorated. Kitchener often complained about "that wicked little Khedive" and wanted to depose him. Lord Kitchener exiled or imprisoned the leaders of the National party.<ref name=EB/>

At the onset of [[World War I]], Abbas was in [[Constantinople]] recovering from wounds suffered at the hands of a would-be assassin. On Nov 5, 1914 when Great Britain declared war on [[Turkey]], he was accused of deserting his country by not returning home forthwith. The British also believed that he was plotting against their rule,<ref name=Colliers/> so when the [[Ottoman Empire]] joined the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], the United Kingdom declared Egypt an independent Sultanate under British [[protectorate]] on 18 December 1914 and deposed Abbas. Abbas supported the Ottomans in the war, including leading an attack on the Suez Canal. His uncles [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]] and then [[Fuad I]], the British choices for their Protectorate, issued a series of restrictive orders to strip Abbas of property in Egypt and Sudan and forbade contributions to him. These also barred Abbas from entering Egyptian territory and stripped him of the right to sue in Egyptian courts. This did not prevent his progeny from exercising their rights, however. Abbas finally accepted the new order of things on 12 May 1931 and abdicated. He retired to Switzerland where he died at Geneva on 19(20)(21) December 1944, aged 70.<ref name=Colliers/><ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|title=Abbas II (Egypt) |edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location= Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=8–9}}</ref>
