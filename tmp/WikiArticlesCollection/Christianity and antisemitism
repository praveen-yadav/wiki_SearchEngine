{{Antisemitism}}
{{Weasel|date=December 2012}}
The relationship between Christian [[anti-Judaism|religious opposition to Judaism]] and secular, racist antisemitism has long been debated by historians and theologians.<ref name="Susannah_Heschel_2008">Heschel, Susannah, [http://books.google.com/books?id=fiCJeNJIhoAC&dq The Aryan Jesus: Christian theologians and the Bible in Nazi Germany], p. 20, Princeton University Press, 2008</ref> Hostility among Christians to Judaism and the Jewish people may have developed from the [[Apostolic Age|early years of Christianity]], the [[persecution of Christians in the New Testament]], and persisted over the [[Early Christianity|ensuing centuries]], driven by numerous factors including [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|theological differences]], competition between [[Church (building)|Church]] and [[Synagogue]], the Christian drive for converts<ref>{{cite book |author=Nancy Calvert Koyzis |title=Paul, monotheism and the people of God : the significance of Abraham traditions for early Judaism and Christianity

These attitudes were reinforced in Christian preaching, art and popular teaching over the centuries containing contempt for Jews.<ref>http://jcpa.org/article/the-origins-of-christian-anti-semitism/</ref> In many Christian countries, it led to civil and political discrimination against Jews, legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]], and in some instances to physical attacks on Jews which occasionally ended in emigration, expulsion, and even death.{{citation required|date=May 2013}}

From time to time, anti-Jewish sentiments within European society were exploited or fomented for internal political purposes and sometimes to extract a financial advantage from Jewish subjects.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Such sentiments made the expansion of anti-Jewish measures politically acceptable.

Modern [[Antisemitism]] has been described as primarily hatred against Jews as a race with its modern expression rooted in 18th century racial theories, while anti-Judaism is described as hostility to Jewish religion, but in [[Western Christianity]] it effectively merged into antisemitism during the 12th century.<ref>"''After the evil: Christianity and Judaism in the shadow of the Holocaust"'', Richard Harries, p. 16, Oxford University Press, 2003</ref> Scholars have debated how Christian antisemitism played a role in the [[Nazi]] [[Third Reich]], [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].

Throughout Christian history, some [[Popes]], [[bishops]] and some Christian princes stepped up to protect Jews, such as Calixtus II in his bull [[Sicut Judaeis]] in 1120.

==Antecedents of Christian antisemitism==
{{See also|Anti-Judaism#Anti-Judaism in the pre-Christian Roman Empire}}
In Rome and throughout the [[Roman Empire]], religion was an integral part of the civil government. The Emperor was from time to time declared to be a god and demanded to be worshiped accordingly.<ref name=lazare63>Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 63</ref> This created religious difficulties for [[Jew]]s, who were prohibited from worshiping any other god than that of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. This created problems in the relations between Rome and its Jewish subjects, as well as for worshipers of [[Mithras]], worshipers of [[Sabazius]], and [[Christianity]].<ref name=lazare64>Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 64</ref> In the case of Jews, this led to several revolts against Rome and severe persecutions by Rome as punishment.

==Early differences==
{{main|Antisemitism in early Christianity}}

There have been philosophical differences between Christianity and Rabbinical [[Judaism]] since the founding of Christianity. Christians acknowledge the roots of Christianity in Judaism. Some claim the entirety of Jewish religious heritage as its own, while interpreting it very differently.{{who|date=May 2013}}

Debates between the [[Early Christianity|Early Christians]], who at first saw themselves as a movement within Judaism and not as a separate religion, and other Jews initially revolved around the question whether Jesus was the [[Messiah]], which later encompassed the issue of his divinity. Once [[gentiles]] were converted to Christianity, the question arose whether and how far these gentile Christians were obliged to follow Jewish law in order to follow Jesus (see Paul's [[letter to the Galatians]]). At the [[Council of Jerusalem]],{{Bibleref2c|Acts|15|NIV}} it was decided that new gentile converts did not need to be [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]] (the ''Apostolic Decree'' of {{Bibleref2|Acts|15:19-21|NIV}}), while requiring acceptance to a set of laws similar to Judaism's [[Noahide Law]], (see also [[Old Testament#Christian view of the Law]] for the modern debate), but Paul also [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|questioned the validity]] of [[Jewish Christian]]s' adherence to the Jewish law in relation to faith in Christ, according to some interpretations. The issue of [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism]] is still hotly debated.{{by who|date=May 2013}}

The increase of the numbers of gentile Christians in comparison to Jewish Christians eventually resulted in a [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|rift between Christianity and Judaism]], which was further increased by the [[Jewish-Roman wars]] (66–73 and 132–135) that drove many more Jews into the [[diaspora]] and reduced the influence of the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]], leader of the first Christian church.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Early Christians also found in the Old Testament, prophecies which seemed to indicate that [[Mosaic Covenant|God's original covenant with the Jews]] would be expanded to include also the Gentiles, in other words [[Proselytes]], [[God-fearer]]s, and [[Noachides]]. Thus the [[Church Fathers]] tend to emphasise that the Church is the new "spiritual" Israel, completing or replacing the earthly Israel which was but its [[Typology (theology)|prototype]]. In modern times, this view would come to be called "[[Supersessionism]]".

Also, the two religions differed in their legal status in the [[Roman Empire]]: Judaism, restricted to the [[Jewish people]] and Jewish [[Proselytes]], was generally exempt from obligation to the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman imperial cult]] and since the reign of [[Julius Caesar]] enjoyed the status of a "licit religion", though there were also occasional persecutions, for example in 19 [[Tiberius]] expelled the Jews from Rome,<ref>Suetonius, [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]], Tiberius 36</ref> as [[Claudius]] did again in 49.<ref>Suetonius, Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Claudius XXV.4, referenced in {{Bibleref2|Acts|18:2}}</ref> Christianity however was not restricted to one people, and as Jewish Christians were excluded from the [[synagogue]] (see [[Council of Jamnia]]), they also lost the protection of the status of Judaism, though said ''protection'' did have its limits (see for example [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)]], [[Akiba ben Joseph]], and [[Ten Martyrs]]).

From the reign of [[Nero]] onwards, who is said{{by whom|date=May 2013}} to have blamed the [[Great Fire of Rome]] on Christians, Christianity was considered to be illegal and Christians were frequently subjected to [[Persecution of Christians#Persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution]], differing regionally. Comparably, Judaism suffered the setbacks of the [[Jewish-Roman wars]], remembered in the legacy of the [[Ten Martyrs]]. [[Robin Lane Fox]] traces the origin of much later hostility to the period of persecution, where the commonest test by the authorities of a suspected Christian was to require homage to be paid to the deified emperor. Jews were exempt from this requirement as long as they paid the [[Fiscus Judaicus]], and Christians (many or mostly of Jewish origins) would say they were Jewish but refused to pay the tax. This had to be confirmed by the local Jewish authorities, who were likely to refuse to accept the Christians as Jewish, often leading to their execution.<ref>In [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bBqOAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Pagans+and+Christians%22+Robin+Lane+Fox&dq=%22Pagans+and+Christians%22+Robin+Lane+Fox&pgis=1 ''Pagans and Christians'']</ref> The [[Birkat haMinim]] was often brought forward as support for this charge that the Jews were responsible for the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In the 3rd century systematic persecution of Christians began and lasted until [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]]'s conversion to Christianity.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In 390 [[Theodosius I]] made Christianity the [[state church of the Roman Empire]]. While pagan cults and [[Manichaeism]] were suppressed, Judaism retained its legal status as a licit religion, though anti-Jewish violence still occurred. In the 5th century, some legal measures worsened the status of the [[Jews in the Roman Empire]] (now more properly called the [[Byzantine Empire]] since relocating to [[Constantinople]]).{{citation required|date=May 2013}}

==New Testament rejection of Judaism==

===Rejection of Jesus as the Messiah===
{{See also|Rejection of Jesus}}
Christianity says that Jesus is the [[Messiah]] which Judaism does not accept. The [[Gospels]] claim that Jesus was a preacher, healer, and messiah. There is no reason to think Jesus would have come into conflict with Jewish authorities in 1st century Judea on account of his preaching and healing,{{dubious|date=October 2011}} yet part of the gospel record is the [[Cleansing of the Temple]]. However, claims that he was the Messiah were more controversial. The Hebrew word ''mashiyakh'' (משיח) typically signified a man, chosen by God or descended from a man chosen by God, to serve as a civil and military authority. If Jesus made this claim during his life, it is not surprising that many Jews, weary of [[Roman Judaea|Roman occupation]], would have supported him as a liberator. It is also likely that Jewish authorities would have been cautious, out of fear of Roman reprisal.{{opinion|date=October 2013}}

Jesus was considered by Christians to be the Messiah, while for most Jews the death of Jesus would have been sufficient proof that he was not the [[Jewish Messiah]]. If early Christians preached that Jesus was [[Second Coming|about to return]], it is virtually certain that Jewish authorities would have opposed them out of fear of Roman reprisal.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Jews revolted against the Romans in 66 CE, which culminated with the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE. They [[Bar Kokhba's revolt|revolted]] again under the leadership of the professed messiah [[Simon Bar Kokhba]] in 132 CE, which culminated in the expulsion of the Jews from Jerusalem, which [[Hadrian]] renamed into [[Aelia Capitolina]] in an attempt to wipe out memory of Jews there. <ref>Shlomo Sand, The Invention of the Jewish People, pg 132-135 Verso publishing retrieved from http://www.rafapal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Shlomo-Sand-The-Invention-of-the-Jewish-People-2009.pdf</ref>

At the time, Christianity was still considered a sect of Judaism, but the messianic claims alienated many Christians (including Jewish converts) and sharply deepened the [[Schism (religion)|schism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Observance of Mosaic law===
{{See also|Biblical law in Christianity|Circumcision controversy in early Christianity}}
Another source of tension between early Christians and Jews was the question of observance of Mosaic Law which was also debated among [[Proselytes]]. Early Christians were divided over the issue: Some [[Jewish Christians]] or so-called [[Judaizers]] argued that Christians were bound to observe Mosaic law,<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Judaizers}}: "held that circumcision and the observance of the Mosaic Law were necessary for salvation and in consequence wished to impose them on the Gentile converts, or who at least considered them as still obligatory on the Jewish Christians"</ref> while [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] perhaps argued that only some of Mosaic Law applied to Christians, though the issue of [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism]] is still hotly debated with some advocating [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|complete abrogation]]. The issue was argued especially in the context of whether Gentile converts were obligated to undergo [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]], which was a requirement for Jewish boys. The issue was hotly debated in the 1st century and settled at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], in which Paul and Barnabas participated as representatives of the church at [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]]. The Council decided that Gentile converts were not subject to most [[613 Commandments|Mosaic Law]], including circumcision, but required them to stay away from eating meat with blood still on it, eating the meat of strangled animals, eating food offered to idols, and sexual immorality. See also [[Noahide Law]] and [[Proselyte]].

Many have interpreted Paul's writings and other parts of the New Testament as [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|ending the requirements of the Jewish law]]. See [[Proselyte]] and [[New Perspective on Paul]] for more details. An example of another view is represented by the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article on ''Judaizers'':<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Judaizers}}</ref>
:Paul, on the other hand, not only did not object to the observance of the Mosaic Law as long as it did not interfere with the [[Christian liberty|liberty of the Gentiles]] but also he conformed to its prescriptions when occasion required.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|9:20}} Thus he shortly after [the Council of Jerusalem] circumcised [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]],{{Bibleref2c|Acts|16:1–3}} and he was in the very act of observing the Mosaic ritual when he was arrested at Jerusalem.{{bibleref2c|Acts|21:26||21:26 sqq}}

===Conversion of Gentiles to Judaism===
After Paul's death, Christianity emerged as a separate religion, and [[Pauline Christianity]] emerged as the dominant form of Christianity, especially after Paul, James and the other apostles agreed on a compromise set of requirements.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|15}} Some Christians continued to adhere to Jewish law, but they were few in number and often considered [[Christian heresy|heretics]] by the Church. One example is the [[Ebionites]], which, according to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], were "infected with Judaistic errors" (language which Jews find offensive{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}); for instance, they denied the [[Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine)|virgin birth]] of Jesus, the physical [[Resurrection of Jesus]], and most of the books that were later [[biblical canon|canonized]] as the [[New Testament]], see also "[[Judaizers]]" (a term which Jews find offensive{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}). For example, the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] are often accused of being Judaizers because they still observe [[Old Testament]] teachings such as the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], and conversely they accuse their opponents of residual [[Marcionism]]. As late as the 4th century [[Church Father]] [[John Chrysostom]] complained (see [[John Chrysostom#Sermons on Jews and Judaizing Christians]]) that some Christians were still attending Jewish synagogues.

===Criticism of the Pharisees===
{{Main|Woes of the Pharisees}}
Many New Testament passages criticise the [[Pharisees]] and it has been argued that these passages have shaped the way that Christians viewed Jews. Like most Bible passages, however, they can and have been interpreted in a variety of ways.

During Jesus' life and at the time of his execution, the Pharisees were only one of several Jewish groups such as the [[Sadducee]]s, [[Zealot]]s, and [[Essene]]s; indeed, some have suggested that Jesus was himself a Pharisee (although there is no biblical basis for that claim). Arguments by Jesus and his disciples against the Pharisees and what he saw as their hypocrisy were most likely examples of disputes among Jews and internal to Judaism that were common at the time, see for example [[Hillel and Shammai]]. ([[Lutheran]] [[Pastor]] John Stendahl has pointed out that "Christianity begins as a kind of Judaism, and we must recognize that words spoken in a family conflict are inappropriately appropriated by those outside the family.")

===Recent studies on Antisemitism in the New Testament===
Professor Lillian C. Freudmann, author of ''Antisemitism in the New Testament'' ([[University Press of America]], 1994) has published a detailed study of the description of Jews in the New Testament, and the historical effects that such passages have had in the Christian community throughout history. Similar studies of such verses have been made by both Christian and Jewish scholars, including, Professors Clark Williamsom (Christian Theological Seminary), [[Hyam Maccoby]] (The Leo Baeck Institute), Norman A. Beck (Texas Lutheran College), and Michael Berenbaum (Georgetown University). Most rabbis feel that these verses are antisemitic, and many Christian scholars, in America and Europe, have reached the same conclusion. Another example is [[John Dominic Crossan]]'s 1995 ''Who Killed Jesus? Exposing the Roots of Anti-Semitism in the Gospel Story of the Death of Jesus''.

==The Church Fathers==
{{Main|Antisemitism in patristics}}
Patristic bishops of the patristic era such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] argued that the Jews should be left alive and suffering as a perpetual reminder of their [[deicide|murder of Christ]]. Other Church Fathers, such as [[John Chrysostom]] went longer in their condemnation. [[Ephraim the Syrian]] wrote polemics against Jews in the 4th century, including the repeated accusation that Satan dwells among them as a partner. These writings were directed at Christians who were being proselytized by Jews and who Ephraim feared were slipping back into the religion of Judaism; thus he portrayed the Jews as enemies of Christianity, like Satan, to emphasize the contrast between the two religions, namely, that Christianity was Godly and true and Judaism was Satanic and false. Like John Chrysostom, his objective was to dissuade Christians from reverting to Judaism by emphasizing what he saw as the wickedness of the Jews and their religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://syrcom.cua.edu/Hugoye/Vol1No2/HV1N2Palmer.html |title=Ephraim the Syrian and his polemics against Jews |publisher=Syrcom.cua.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://syrcom.cua.edu/Hugoye/Vol5No1/HV5N1Shepardson.html |title=Analysis of Ephraim's writings |publisher=Syrcom.cua.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref>

However, there are also positive remarks from the Church Fathers on the issue, such as Eusebius of Caesarea (circa. 263-340 A.D) in his Ecclesiatical History, who said, "The race of the Hebrews is not new, but is honoured among all men for its antiquity and is itself well known to all."

==Christians and Jews in Muslim lands==
While in Christian Europe Christianity had the upper hand as the religion of state, under Islam Jews and Christians were on a more even footing.<ref>The Dhimmi: Jews and Christians under Islam Bat Yeʼor - 1985  Indispensable to the Western observer for a full understanding of the complexities of the conflicts in the Middle East, this study analyzes and documents the historical, social, and spiritual realities of the dhimmi peoples -- the non-Arab</ref> The religious liberty of the Jews and Christians was explicitly protected under both Islamic law and tradition. The [[People of the Book]], (''Ahl al-Kitāb'') held a special status in Islamic society, and consequently enjoyed many freedoms under Muslim rule.

==The Middle Ages==
{{Main|Antisemitism in Europe (Middle Ages)}}
[[File:1182 french expulsion of jews.jpg|thumb|A miniature from [[Grandes Chroniques de France]] depicting the expulsion of Jews from France in 1182. ]]
In the [[Middle Ages]], religion played a major role in driving [[antisemitism]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Though not part of [[Roman Catholic]] [[dogma]], many Christians, including members of the [[clergy]], have erroneously held the Jewish people collectively responsible for killing Jesus, through the so-called [[blood curse]] of [[Pontius Pilate]] in the Gospels, among other things.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

On the other hand, St.Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153), a Doctor of the Catholic Church, said "For us the Jews are Scripture's living words, because they remind us of what Our Lord suffered. They are not to be persecuted, killed, or even put to flight."<ref>Catholic Book of Quotations, by Leo Knowles, Copywrite 2004 by Our Sunday Visitor Publishing Division, Our Sunday Visitor, Inc. All rights reserved.</ref>

[[Jews]] were subject to a wide range of legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] and restrictions throughout the Middle Ages, some of which lasted until the end of the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Jews were excluded from many trades, the occupations varying with place and time, and determined by the influence of various non-Jewish competing interests. Often Jews were barred from all occupations but money-lending and peddling, with even these at times forbidden. The number of Jews permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in [[ghettos]], and were not allowed to own land; they were subject to discriminatory taxes on entering cities or districts other than their own,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}, were forced to swear special [[Oath More Judaico|Jewish Oaths]], and suffered a variety of other measures, including restrictions on dress. The [[Fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215 was the first to proclaim the requirement for Jews to wear something that distinguished them as Jews (and Muslims the same).

On many occasions, Jews were accused of a [[blood libel]], the supposed drinking of blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian [[Eucharist]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Sicut Judaeis===
[[Sicut Judaeis]] (the "Constitution for the Jews") was the official position of the papacy regarding Jews throughout the Middle Ages and later. The first bull was issued in about 1120 by [[Calixtus II]], intended to protect Jews who suffered during the [[First Crusade]], and was reaffirmed by many popes, even until the 15th century.

The bull forbade, besides other things, Christians from coercing Jews to convert, or to harm them, or to take their property, or to disturb the celebration of their festivals, or to interfere with their cemeteries, on pain of excommunication.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=History of Toleration}}</ref>

===Popular antisemitism===
Antisemitism in popular European Christian culture escalated beginning in the 13th century. [[Blood libels]] and [[host desecration]] drew popular attention and led to many cases of persecution against Jews. Antisemitic imagery such as [[Judensau]] and [[Ecclesia et Synagoga]] recurred in Christian art and architecture.

In Iceland, one of the hymns repeated in the days leading up to Easter include the lines,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-vilhjalmur-f04.htm |title=Iceland, the Jews, and Anti-Semitism, 1625-2004 - Vilhjálmur Örn Vilhjálmsson |publisher=Jcpa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref>

===Expulsions===

====Expulsion of Jews from England====
{{Main|Edict of Expulsion}}
[[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] expelled all the Jews from England in 1290 (only after ransoming some 3,000 among the most wealthy of them), on the accusation of [[usury]] and undermining loyalty to the dynasty.

====Expulsion of Jews from Spain====
In 1492 [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]], the rulers of [[Spain]] who financed [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage to the New World just a few months later in 1492, declared that all Jews in their territories should either convert to Catholicism or leave the country. While some converted, many others left for [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Italy]] (including the [[Papal States]]), [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[North Africa]]. Many of those who had fled to Portugal were later expelled by [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel]] in 1497 or left to avoid forced conversion and [[Marranos|persecution]].

==Renaissance to the 17th century==

===Cum Nimis Absurdum===
On 14 July 1555, [[Pope Paul IV]] issued [[papal bull]] [[Cum nimis absurdum]] which revoked all the rights of the Jewish community and placed religious and economic restrictions on [[Jew]]s in the [[Papal States]], renewed anti-Jewish legislation and subjected Jews to various degradations and restrictions on their personal freedom.

The bull established the [[Roman Ghetto]] and required Jews of Rome, which had existed as a community since before Christian times and which numbered about 2,000 at the time, to live in it. The Ghetto was a walled quarter with three gates that were locked at night. Jews were also restricted to one [[synagogue]] per city.

Paul IV's successor, [[Pope Pius IV]], enforced the creation of other ghettos in most Italian towns, and his successor, [[Pope Pius V]], recommended them to other bordering states.

===Protestant Reformation===
[[File:1543 On the Jews and Their Lies by Martin Luther.jpg|thumb|Luther's 1543 pamphlet ''[[On the Jews and Their Lies (Martin Luther)|On the Jews and Their Lies]]'']]
{{See also|Luther and antisemitism}}

[[Martin Luther]] at first made overtures towards the Jews, believing that the "evils" of [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] had prevented their conversion to Christianity. When his call to convert to his version of Christianity was unsuccessful, he became hostile to them.

In his book ''[[On the Jews and Their Lies (Martin Luther)|On the Jews and their Lies]]'', he excoriates them as "venomous beasts, vipers, disgusting scum, canders, devils incarnate."  He provided detailed recommendations for a [[pogrom]] against them, calling for their permanent oppression and expulsion, writing "Their private houses must be destroyed and devastated, they could be lodged in stables. Let the magistrates burn their synagogues and let whatever escapes be covered with sand and mud. Let them force to work, and if this avails nothing, we will be compelled to expel them like dogs in order not to expose ourselves to incurring divine wrath and eternal damnation from the Jews and their lies."  At one point he wrote: "...we are at fault in not slaying them..."  a passage that "may be termed the first work of modern antisemitism, and a giant step forward on the road to [[the Holocaust]]."<ref name=Johnson>[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Johnson, Paul]]. ''A History of the Jews'', HarperCollins Publishers, 1987, p.242. ISBN 5-551-76858-9. [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]].</ref>

Luther's harsh comments about the Jews are seen by many as a continuation of medieval Christian antisemitism. In his final sermon shortly before his death, however, Luther preached: "We want to treat them with Christian love and to pray for them, so that they might become converted and would receive the Lord."<ref name=Luther>[[Martin Luther|Luther, Martin]].

==19th century==
{{See also|Christianity and Judaism|Relations between Catholicism and Judaism}}
Throughout the 19th century and into the 20th, the Roman Catholic Church still incorporated strong antisemitic elements, despite increasing attempts to separate anti-Judaism (opposition to the Jewish religion on religious grounds) and racial antisemitism. [[Pope Pius VII]] (1800–1823) had the walls of the Jewish [[ghetto]] in Rome rebuilt after the Jews were [[Jewish emancipation|emancipated]] by [[Napoleon and the Jews|Napoleon]], and Jews were restricted to the ghetto through the end of the [[Papal States]] in 1870. Official Catholic organizations, such as the [[Jesuits]], banned candidates "who are descended from the Jewish race unless it is clear that their father, grandfather, and great-grandfather have belonged to the Catholic Church" until 1946.

Brown University historian [[David Kertzer]], working from the Vatican archive, has argued in his book ''[[The Popes Against the Jews]]'' that in the 19th century and early 20th century the Roman Catholic Church adhered to a distinction between "good antisemitism" and "bad antisemitism". The "bad" kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian. The "good" kind criticized alleged [[Jewish conspiracy|Jewish conspiracies]] to control newspapers, banks, and other institutions, to care only about accumulation of wealth, etc. Many Catholic bishops wrote articles criticizing Jews on such grounds, and, when accused of promoting hatred of Jews, would remind people that they condemned the "bad" kind of antisemitism. Kertzer's work is not without critics. Scholar of Jewish-Christian relations [[Rabbi David G. Dalin]], for example, criticized Kertzer in the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' for using evidence selectively.

==20th-century==

===WWI to the eve of WWII===
{{Main|Pope Benedict XV and Judaism}}
In 1916, in the midst of the [[First World War]], American Jews petitioned Pope Benedict XV on behalf of the Polish Jews.

===Nazi antisemitism===
{{further|Pope Pius XI and Judaism}}
On April 26, 1933 Hitler declared during a meeting with Roman Catholic Bishop {{Ill|de|Wilhelm Berning|Hermann Wilhelm Berning}} of Osnabrück:
<blockquote>
“I have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.”
</blockquote>

The transcript of this discussion contains no response by Bishop Berning. [[Martin Rhonheimer]] does not consider this unusual since, in his opinion, for a Catholic Bishop in 1933 there was nothing particularly objectionable "in this historically correct reminder".<ref name="firstthings.com">{{cite web |title=The Holocaust: What Was Not Said'' |first=Martin |last=Rhonheimer |publisher=First Things Magazine |date=November 2003 |accessdate= 1 July 2009 |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10}}</ref>

The Nazis used [[Martin Luther]]'s book, ''[[On the Jews and Their Lies]]'' (1543), to [[Luther and antisemitism#Use by the Nazis|claim]] a moral righteousness for their ideology.  Luther even went so far as to advocate the murder of those Jews who refused to convert to Christianity, writing that "we are at fault in not slaying them".<ref>Luther, Martin.

Archbishop [[Robert Runcie]] has asserted that: "Without centuries of Christian antisemitism, Hitler's passionate hatred would never have been so fervently echoed...because for centuries Christians have held Jews collectively responsible for the death of [[Jesus]]. On Good Friday Jews, have in times past, cowered behind locked doors with fear of a Christian mob seeking 'revenge' for deicide. Without the poisoning of Christian minds through the centuries, the Holocaust is unthinkable."<ref>"''After the evil: Christianity and Judaism in the shadow of the Holocaust"'', Richard Harries, p. 21, Oxford University Press, 2003</ref> The dissident Catholic priest [[Hans Küng]] has written that "Nazi anti-Judaism was the work of godless, anti-Christian criminals. But it would not have been possible without the almost two thousand years' pre-history of 'Christian' anti-Judaism..."<ref>Hans Küng, ''On Being a Christian'' (Doubleday, Garden City NY, 1976), p. 169.</ref>

The document [[Dabru Emet]] was issued by over 220 [[rabbi]]s and [[intellectual]]s from all branches of [[Judaism]] in 2000 as a statement about Jewish-Christian relations. This document states,<blockquote>
"Nazism was not a Christian phenomenon. Without the long history of Christian anti-Judaism and Christian violence against Jews, Nazi ideology could not have taken hold nor could it have been carried out. Too many Christians participated in, or were sympathetic to, Nazi atrocities against Jews. Other Christians did not protest sufficiently against these atrocities. But Nazism itself was not an inevitable outcome of Christianity."</blockquote>
According to American [[historian]] [[Lucy Dawidowicz]], antisemitism has a long history within Christianity. The line of "antisemitic descent" from Luther, the author of [[On the Jews and Their Lies]], to Hitler is "easy to draw." In her ''[[The War Against the Jews]], 1933-1945'', she contends that Luther and Hitler were obsessed by the "demonologized universe" inhabited by Jews. Dawidowicz writes that the similarities between Luther's anti-Jewish writings and modern antisemitism are no coincidence, because they derived from a common history of ''Judenhass'', which can be traced to [[Haman (Bible)|Haman's]] advice to [[Ahasuerus]]. Although modern German antisemitism also has its roots in German [[nationalism]] and the [[liberalism|liberal]] revolution of 1848, [[Christianity|Christian]] antisemitism she writes is a foundation that was laid by the [[Roman Catholic]] Church and "upon which Luther built."<ref>''The War Against the Jews, 1933-1945''.

====Collaborating Christians====
* [[German Christians]]
* ''[[Gleichschaltung]]''
* [[Hanns Kerrl]], Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs
* [[Positive Christianity]] (the approved Nazi version of Christianity)
* [[Protestant Reich Church]]

====Opposition to the Holocaust====
The [[Confessing Church]] was, in 1934, the first Christian opposition group. The Catholic Church officially condemned the Nazi theory of racism in Germany in 1937 with the [[encyclical]] "''[[Mit Brennender Sorge]]''", signed by [[Pope Pius XI]], and Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] led the Catholic opposition, preaching against racism.

Many individual Christian clergy and laypeople of all denominations had to pay for their opposition with their life, including:
* Catholic priest, [[Maximilian Kolbe]].
* Lutheran pastor [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]]
* the Catholic parson of Berlin Cathedral, [[Bernhard Lichtenberg]].
* the mostly Catholic members of the [[Munich]] resistance group [[White Rose]] around [[Hans Scholl|Hans]] and [[Sophie Scholl]].

By the 1940s fewer Christians were willing to oppose Nazi policy publicly, but many secretly helped save the lives of Jews. There are many sections of Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Museum, [[Yad Vashem]], dedicated to honoring these "[[Righteous Among the Nations]]".

====Pope Pius XII====

His encyclical ''Mit Brennender Sorge'' was the 'first great official public document to dare to confront and criticize Nazism' and 'one of the greatest such condemnations ever issued by the Vatican.' Smuggled into Germany, it was read from all the Catholic pulpits on Palm Sunday in March 1937. It denounced the Nazi "myth of blood and soil" and decried its neopaganism. The Nazis retaliated by closing and sealing all the presses that had printed it and took numerous vindictive measures against the Church, including staging a long series of immorality trials of Catholic clergy."</ref>

In the summer of 1942, Pius explained to his college of Cardinals the reasons for the great gulf that existed between Jews and Christians at the theological level: "''Jerusalem has responded to His call and to His grace with the same rigid blindness and stubborn ingratitude that has led it along the path of guilt to the murder of God."'' Historian Guido Knopp describes these comments of Pius as being "''incomprehensible''" at a time when "''Jerusalem was being murdered by the million''".<ref>Knopp, Guido.

Prominent members of the Jewish community have contradicted the criticisms of Pius and spoke highly of his efforts to protect Jews.<ref>Bokenkotter, Thomas (2004). A Concise History of the Catholic Church. Doubleday. pp. 480–481, quote: "A recent article by American rabbi, David G. Dalin, challenges this judgment. He calls making Pius XII a target of moral outrage a failure of historical understanding, and he thinks Jews should reject any 'attempt to usurp the Holocaust' for the partisan purposes at work in this debate. Dalin surmises that well-known Jews such as Albert Einstein, Golda Meir, Moshe Sharett, and Rabbi Isaac Herzog would likely have been shocked at these attacks on Pope Pius. ... Dalin points out that Rabbi Herzog, the chief rabbi of Israel, sent a message in February 1944 declaring 'the people of Israel will never forget what His Holiness ... (is) doing for our unfortunate brothers and sisters in the most tragic hour of our history.'" Dalin cites these tributes as recognition of the work of the Holy See in saving hundreds of thousands of Jews."</ref> The Israeli historian [[Pinchas Lapide]] interviewed war survivors and concluded that Pius XII "was instrumental in saving at least 700,000, but probably as many as 860,000&nbsp;Jews from certain death at Nazi hands".

===The "White Power" movement===
[[File:proper hands.jpg|thumb|right|'''In Proper Hands.''' Protestant Christian dominated KKK hinting at violence against Jews and Catholics. Illustration by Rev. [[Branford Clarke]] from ''[[Heroes of the Fiery Cross]]'' 1928 by Bishop [[Alma White]] published by the [[Pillar of Fire Church]] in [[Zarephath, NJ]].]]

The [[Christian Identity]] movement, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other [[White supremacy|White supremacist]] groups have expressed antisemitic views. They claim that their antisemitism is based on purported Jewish control of the media,<ref>[http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=4231 Updated: Who Rules America?] by Kevin Alfred Strom and National Vanguard staff (National Vanguard) November 20, 2004</ref> international banks, radical left wing politics, and the Jews' promotion of [[multiculturalism]], anti-Christian groups, [[liberalism]] and perverse organizations. They rebuke charges of [[racism]] and claim that Jews who share their ideology maintain membership in their organizations. A racial belief common among these groups, but not universal, is an [[Historical revisionism (political)|alternative history]] doctrine, sometimes called [[British Israelism]]. In some forms this doctrine absolutely denies that modern Jews have any racial connection to the [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Israel of the Bible]]. Instead, according to extreme forms of this doctrine the true racial Israel and true humans are the Adamic (white) race.

These groups are often rejected and are not considered to be Christian groups by mainstream Christian denominations as well as by the vast majority of Christians around the world.{{cn|date=May 2013}}

===Post World War II antisemitism===
Antisemitism in Europe remains a substantial problem. Antisemitism exists to a lesser or greater degree in many other nations as well, including Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and the increasingly frequent tensions between some [[Islam in Europe|Muslim]] immigrants and Jews across Europe.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stone |first=Andrea |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-11-22-jews-france_x.htm |title=As attacks rise in France, Jews flock to Israel |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2004-11-22 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref><ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/841445.html Jews for Le Pen] by Daniel Ben-Simon.

While in a decline since the 1940s, there is still a measurable amount of antisemitism in the United States of America as well, although acts of violence are rare. The 2001 survey by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] reported 1432 acts of antisemitism in the United States that year. The figure included 877 acts of harassment, including verbal intimidation, threats and physical assaults.<ref>[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/ASUS_12/4057_12.asp ADL Audit: Anti-Semitic Incidents in U.S. Declined in 2001 Americans Reject Conspiracy Theories Blaming Jews for 9/11] (2002 report)</ref> Antisemitic pronouncements still occur, however. John Hagee, a leading proponent of "Christian Zionism," reiterated a view—the popularity of which is very hard to gauge but must nonetheless be considered not simply isolated—that the Jews brought the Holocaust upon themselves by angering God.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/max-blumenthal/my-interview-with-pastor_b_103177.html</ref>

''Jewish Questions: Responsa on Sephardic Life in the Early Modern Period'', Princeton University Press, 2008, p. 8.

Blood libels typically allege that Jews require human blood for the baking of [[matzo]]s for [[Passover]], although this element was absent in the earliest cases that claimed (the contemporary) Jews reenacted the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. The accusations often assert that the blood of children of [[Christian]]s is especially coveted, and, historically, blood libel claims have been made to account for otherwise unexplained deaths of children. In some cases, the alleged victim of [[human sacrifice]] has become venerated as a [[Christian martyr|martyr]], a holy figure around whom a martyr cult might arise. Three of these -- [[William of Norwich]], [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]], [[Simon of Trent]]—became objects of local cults and veneration, and in some cases were added to the [[General Roman Calendar]], even though lacking official canonization in the Roman Catholic Church. One, [[Gavriil Belostoksky]], was canonized by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

In Jewish lore, blood libels were the impetus for the creation of the [[Golem#The_classic_narrative:_The_Golem_of_Prague|Golem of Prague]] by Rabbi [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] in the 16th century.<ref>[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/golem.html Angelo S. Rappoport ''The Folklore of the Jews'' (London: Soncino Press, 1937)pp. 195-203]</ref> According to [[Walter Laqueur]]:
<blockquote>Altogether, there have been about 150 recorded cases of blood libel (not to mention thousands of rumors) that resulted in the arrest and killing of Jews throughout history, most of them in the Middle Ages. In almost every case, Jews were murdered, sometimes by a mob, sometimes following torture and a trial.<ref>[[Walter Laqueur]] (2006): ''The Changing Face of Antisemitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day'', Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-530429-2. p.56</ref></blockquote>

Jews were frequently accused of ritual murder of Christians for their blood in ''[[Der Stürmer]]'', an antisemitic newspaper published in [[Nazi Germany]]<ref>[http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/sturmer.htm German propaganda archive - Caricatures from Der Stürmer], [[Calvin College]] website.</ref>

==Anti-Judaism==
{{Main|Anti-Judaism}}
Many Christians do not consider [[anti-Judaism]] to be [[antisemitism]].{{says who|date=May 2013}} They regard anti-Judaism as a disagreement of religiously sincere  people with the tenets of Judaism, while regarding antisemitism as an emotional bias or hatred not specifically targeting the religion of Judaism. Under this approach, anti-Judaism is not regarded as antisemitism as it only rejects the religious ideas of Judaism and does not involve actual hostility to the Jewish people.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Others see anti-Judaism as the rejection of or opposition to beliefs and practices ''essentially because'' of their source in [[Judaism]] or because a belief or practice is associated with the Jewish people. (But see [[supersessionism]])

The position that "Christian theological anti-Judaism is a phenomenon distinct from modern antisemitism, which is rooted in economic and racial thought, so that Christian teachings should not be held responsible for antisemitism"<ref name="Susannah_Heschel_2008"/> has been articulated, among other places, by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 'We Remember: A Reflection on the [[Shoah]],' and the Jewish declaration on Christianity, [[Dabru Emet]].<ref name="Susannah_Heschel_2008"/> Several scholars, including Susannah Heschel,<ref name="Susannah_Heschel_2008"/> Gavin I Langmuir<ref name="langmuir_1990">Langmuir, AvGavin I., [http://books.google.com/books?id=F1ySMxcXkjIC History, Religion, and Antisemitism], p. 40, University of California Press, 1990</ref> and Uriel Tal<ref name="Susannah_Heschel_2008"/> have challenged this position, arguing that anti-Judaism led directly to modern antisemitism.

Although some Christians in the past did consider anti-Judaism to be contrary to Christian teaching, this view was not widely expressed by leaders and lay people. In many cases, the practical tolerance towards the Jewish religion and Jews prevailed. Some Christian groups, particularly in early years, condemned verbal anti-Judaism.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Jewish converts==
{{See also|Jews for Jesus}}
The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), the largest Protestant Christian denomination in the U.S., has explicitly rejected suggestions that it should back away from seeking to convert Jews, a position that critics have called antisemitic, but that Baptists see as consistent with their view that salvation is found solely through faith in Christ. In 1996 the SBC approved a resolution calling for efforts to seek the conversion of Jews "as well as for the salvation of 'every kindred and tongue and people and nation.'"

Most [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] agree with the SBC position, and some have been supporting efforts specifically seeking Jews' conversion. At the same time these groups are among the most pro-Israeli groups. (''For more, see [[Christian Zionism]]''.) Among the controversial groups that has found support from some Evangelical churches is [[Jews for Jesus]], which claims that Jews can "complete" their Jewish faith by accepting Jesus as the Messiah.

The [[Presbyterian Church USA|Presbyterian Church (USA)]], the [[United Methodist Church]], and the [[United Church of Canada]] have ended their efforts to convert Jews. While [[Anglicans]] do not, as a rule, seek converts from other Christian denominations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/news.cfm/2003/5/20/ACNS3443 |title=Anglican Communion News Service: European Anglicans set common goals at Madrid consultation |publisher=Anglicancommunion.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref> the General Synod has affirmed that "the good news of salvation in Jesus Christ is for all and must be shared with all including people from other faiths or of no faith and that to do anything else would be to institutionalize discrimination".<ref>{{cite web|last=Owen |first=Peter |url=http://www.thinkinganglicans.org.uk/archives/003647.html |title=General Synod - Uniqueness of Christ in Multi-Faith Britain |publisher=Thinking Anglicans |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref>

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] formerly had religious congregations specifically aimed to conversion of Jews. Some of these were founded by Jewish converts themselves, like the Community of Our Lady of Zion, which was composed of [[nun]]s and ordained [[priest]]s. Many Catholic saints were noted specifically because of their missionary zeal in converting Jews, such as [[Vincent Ferrer]]. After the [[Second Vatican Council]] many missionary orders aimed at converting Jews to Christianity no longer actively sought to missionize (or [[proselytism|proselytize]]) among Jews. [[Traditionalist Catholic|Traditionalist Roman Catholic]] groups, congregations and clergymen, however, continue to support missionizing Jews according to traditional patterns, sometimes with success (''e.g.'', the [[Society of St. Pius X]] which has notable Jewish converts among its faithful, many of whom have become traditionalist priests).

Some Jewish organizations have described evangelism and missionary activity directed specifically at Jews as [[antisemitic]].<ref>[http://www.culteducation.com/reference/jews_for_jesus/jews_for_jesus6.html Keeping Faith.

==Reconciliation between Judaism and Christian groups==
{{Main|Christian–Jewish reconciliation}}
In recent years there has been much to note in the way of reconciliation between some Christian groups and the Jews. Most of this reconciliation has occurred between the Jewish community and the [[Catholic Church]], and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian organizations.
