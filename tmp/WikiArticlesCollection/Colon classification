'''Colon classification''' ('''CC''') is a system of [[library classification]] developed by [[S. R. Ranganathan]]. It was the first ever [[Faceted classification|faceted]] (or analytico-synthetic) [[Taxonomic classification|classification]]. The first edition was published in 1933. Since then six more editions have been published. It is especially used in [[library|libraries]] in [[India]].

Its name "colon classification" comes from the use of [[Colon (punctuation)|colons]] to separate facets in class numbers. However, many other classification schemes, some of which are completely unrelated, also use colons and other [[punctuation]] in various functions. They should not be confused with colon classification.

As an example, the subject "research in the cure of tuberculosis of lungs by x-ray conducted in India in 1950" results in a call number

:L,45;421:6;253:f.44'N5

The components of this call number represent

:Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research.India'1950

== Organization ==

The colon classification uses 42 main classes that are combined with other letters, numbers and marks in a manner resembling the [[Library of Congress Classification]] to sort a publication.

=== Facets ===

CC uses five primary categories, or facets, to further specify the sorting of a publication. Collectively, they are called ''PMEST'':

:<nowiki>,</nowiki> Personality
:<nowiki>;</nowiki> Matter or property
:<nowiki>:</nowiki> Energy
:<nowiki>.</nowiki> Space
:<nowiki>'</nowiki> Time

=== Classes ===

The following are the main classes of CC, with some subclasses, the main method used to sort the subclass using the PMEST scheme and examples showing application of PMEST.

== Example ==

A common example of the colon classification is:

* "Research in the cure of the tuberculosis of lungs by x-ray conducted in India in 1950s":

* Main classification is Medicine
** (Medicine)
* Within Medicine, the Lungs are the main concern
** (Medicine,Lungs)
* The property of the Lungs is that they are afflicted with Tuberculosis
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis)
* The Tuberculosis is being performed (:) on, that is the intent is to cure (Treatment)
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment)
* The matter that we are treating the Tuberculosis with are X-Rays
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray)
* And this discussion of treatment is regarding the Research phase
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research)
* This Research is performed within a geographical space (.) namely India
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research.India)
* During the time (') of 1950
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research.India'1950)
* And translating into the codes listed for each subject and facet the classification becomes
** L,45;421:6;253:f.44'N5
