'''Abdülaziz''' ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: عبد العزيز / ''`Abdü’l-`Azīz'';  9/18 February 1830 &ndash; 4 June 1876) was the 32nd [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and reigned between 25 June 1861 and 30 May 1876.<ref name=EB/> He was the son of Sultan [[Mahmud II]] and succeeded his brother [[Abdülmecid I]] in 1861.<ref>[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 2</ref>

Born at the Eyüp Palace, Constantinople (present-day [[Istanbul]]),<ref>''The Encyclopædia Britannica'', Vol.7, Edited by Hugh Chisholm, (1911), 3; ''Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish Empire...''</ref><ref>[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368294/Istanbul Britannica, Istanbul]:''When the Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923, the capital was moved to Ankara, and Constantinople was officially renamed Istanbul in 1930.''</ref> on 9/18 February 1830, Abdülaziz received an Ottoman education but was nevertheless an ardent admirer of the material progress that was made in the West.The Sultan took an interest in documenting the Sultanate. He was also interested in literature and was also a classical music composer. Some of his compositions have been collected in the album ''"European Music at the Ottoman Court"'' by the London Academy of Ottoman Court Music.

== Family ==
His parents were [[Mahmud II]] and [[Valide Sultan]] [[Sultana Pertevniyal|Pertevniyal]] ("Partav-Nihal").<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~dantrogers/pafg1639.htm Daniel T. Rogers, "All my relatives: Valide Sultana Partav-Nihal"]</ref><!--[[:tr:Pertevniyal Valide Sultan]]--> (1812–1883), originally named Bezime, a [[Vlach]].<ref>[http://www.osmanli700.gen.tr/english/sultans/32index.html His profile in the Ottoman Web Site]</ref> He was a quarter French. In 1868 Pertevniyal was living in the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]]. That year Abdülaziz led the visiting [[Eugénie de Montijo]], Empress of France, to see his mother. Pertevniyal perceived the presence of a foreign woman within her quarters of the [[seraglio]] as an insult. She reportedly [[Slapping (strike)|slapped]] Eugénie across the face, almost resulting in an international incident.<ref>[http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/womeninpower/Womeninpower1840.htm "Women in Power" 1840-1870, entry:  "1861-76 Pertevniyal Valide Sultan of The Ottoman Empire"]</ref> The [[Pertevniyal Valide Sultan Mosque]] was built under the patronage of his mother. The construction work began in November 1869 and the mosque was finished in 1871.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/database_item.php?id=monument;ISL;tr;Mon01;30;en|title=Pertevniyal Valide Sultan Mosque Complex|publisher=Discover Islamic Art|accessdate=26 January 2008}}</ref>

His paternal grandparents were Sultan [[Abdul Hamid I]] and Sultana [[Aimée du Buc de Rivéry|Naksh-i-Dil Haseki]]. Several accounts identify his paternal grandmother with [[Aimée du Buc de Rivéry]], a cousin of [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]].<ref>[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jwh/17.2/isomverhaaren.html Christine Isom-Verhaaren, "Royal French Women in the Ottoman Sultans' Harem: The Political Uses of Fabricated Accounts from the Sixteenth to the Twenty-first Century"]</ref> Pertevniyal was a sister of Hoshiar (Khushiyar), third wife of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]].

== Reign ==
Between 1861 and 1871, the [[Tanzimat]] reforms which began during the reign of his brother [[Abdülmecid I]] were continued under the leadership of his chief ministers, [[Keçecizade Mehmet Fuat Pasha]] and [[Mehmed Emin Aali Pasha]]. [[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire#Administrative reform, 1864|New administrative districts (''vilayets'')]] were set up in 1864 and a [[Council of State]] was established in 1868.<ref name=EB/> Public education was organized on the [[Education in France|French model]] and [[Istanbul University]] was reorganized as a modern institution in 1861.<ref name=EB/> He was also integral in establishing the first Ottoman civil code.<ref name=EB/>

Abdülaziz cultivated good relations with the [[Second French Empire]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]]. In 1867 he was the first Ottoman sultan to visit [[Western Europe]];<ref name=EB/> his trip included a visit to the United Kingdom, where he was made a [[List of Knights and Ladies of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] by [[Queen Victoria]] and shown a [[Fleet Review, Royal Navy#Queen Victoria|Royal Navy Fleet Review]] with [[Ismail of Egypt]].  He travelled by a private rail car, which today can be found in the [[Rahmi M. Koç Museum]] in Istanbul. His fellow Knights of the Garter created in 1867 were [[Charles Gordon-Lennox, 6th Duke of Richmond]], [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland]], [[Henry Somerset, 8th Duke of Beaufort]], [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] and [[Alexander II of Russia]].

Caliber: 140mm, length: 339cm, weight: 2533kg, ammunition: 10kg iron ball. Remitted by Abdülaziz to [[Napoleon III]] in 1862.]]
In 1869,  Abdülaziz received visits from [[Eugénie de Montijo]], Empress consort of [[Napoleon III of France]] and other foreign monarchs on their way to the opening of the [[Suez Canal]]. The [[Prince of Wales]], the future [[Edward VII]], twice visited Constantinople.

By 1871 both ʿAlī Pasha and Fuʿād Pasha were dead.<ref name=EB/> The Second French Empire, his Western European model, had been defeated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] by the [[North German Confederation]] under the leadership of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Abdülaziz turned to the [[Russian Empire]] for friendship, as unrest in the Balkan provinces continued. In 1875, the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)|Herzegovinian rebellion]] was the beginning of further unrest in the Balkan provinces. In 1876, the [[April Uprising]] saw insurrection spreading among the [[Bulgarians]]. Ill feeling mounted against Russia for its encouragement of the rebellions.<ref name=EB/>

While not any one event lead to his being deposed, the crop failure of 1873, and his lavish expenditures for the [[Ottoman Navy]] and the new palaces which he had built, along with the mounting public debt certainly created an atmospere condusive to his being overthrown. Abdülaziz was deposed by his ministers on 30 May 1876;<ref name=EB/> his death at [[Feriye Palace]] in Constantinople a few days later was documented as a suicide at the time,<ref name=EB/><ref>{{cite book | title=The Palace of Topkapi in Istanbul| last=Davis| first=Claire| year=1970| pages=222| publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons| location=New York| id=ASIN B000NP64Z2}}</ref> although in [[Abdul Hamid II|Sultan Abdulhamid II]]'s recently surfaced memoirs, the event is described as an assassination by the order of [[Hussein Avni Pasha]] and [[Midhat Pasha]]. When [[Murad V|Sultan Murad V]] began to show signs of paranoia, madness and continuous fainting and vomiting even on the day of his coronation and threw himself into a pool yelling at his guards to protect his life, they were afraid the public would become outraged and revolt to bring the former Sultan back.  Within a few days, on 4 June 1876, they arranged for Sultan Abdülaziz to kill himself with scissors, cutting his two wrists at the same time.<ref>{{cite book | title=Sultan Abdülhamid'in Hatıra Defteri| last=Bozdağ| first=İsmet| year=2000| pages=223| publisher=Pınar Yayınları| location=İstanbul| isbn=9753520344}}</ref> It was unclear how the Sultan got hold of scissors in his tower prison cell and how he managed to cut two wrists at once, since no autopsy was allowed afterwards. The event was recorded as suicide officially and he was buried in Constantinople.

== Achievements ==
The biggest achievement of Abdülaziz was to modernize the Ottoman Navy. In 1875, the Navy had 21 battleships and 173 warships of other types, ranking as the third largest navy in the world after the British and French navies.

He established the first Ottoman railroad network and [[Sirkeci Station|Sirkeci Train Station]] in Constantinople, terminus of the [[Orient Express]].

Impressed by the museums in London, Paris and Vienna, he established the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]].

Under Abdülaziz's reign, [[Postage stamps and postal history of Turkey#Tughra issue|Turkey's first postage stamps]] were issued in 1863, and The Ottoman Empire joined the [[Universal Postal Union]] in 1875 as a founding member.

He was made the 756th [[Knight]] of the [[Order of the Garter]] in 1867 and the 127th [[Grand Cross]] of the [[Order of the Tower and Sword]].

He also was responsible for the first civil code for the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=EB/>
