The '''Boeing C-17 Globemaster III''' is a large [[military transport aircraft]].  It was developed for the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) from the 1980s to the early 1990s by [[McDonnell Douglas]]. The C-17 carries the name of two previous piston-engined military cargo aircraft, the [[Douglas C-74 Globemaster]] and the [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II]]. The C-17 commonly performs [[airlift|strategic airlift]] missions, transporting troops and cargo throughout the world; additional roles include tactical airlift, [[medical evacuation]] and [[airdrop]] duties.

[[Boeing]], which merged with McDonnell Douglas in the 1990s, continues to manufacture C-17s for export customers following the end of deliveries to the U.S. Air Force. The C-17 is operated by the U.S. Air Force, the [[Royal Air Force|United Kingdom]], [[Royal Australian Air Force|Australia]], [[Royal Canadian Air Force|Canada]], [[Qatar Emiri Air Force|Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates Air Force|United Arab Emirates]], [[NATO]] [[Heavy Airlift Wing]], and [[Indian Air Force|India]].

==Development==
===Background and design phase===
In the 1970s, the U.S. Air Force began looking for a replacement for its [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] tactical cargo aircraft.<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/djreprints/access/72923084.html?dids=72923084:72923084&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+13%2C+1972&author=&pub=Wall+Street+Journal&desc=Air+Force+Lets+Advanced+STOL+Prototype+Work&pqatl=google "Air Force Lets Advanced STOL Prototype Work."] ''Wall Street Journal,'' 13 November 1972.</ref>  The [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport]] (AMST) competition was held, with [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems|Boeing]] proposing the [[Boeing YC-14|YC-14]], and [[McDonnell Douglas]] proposing the [[McDonnell Douglas YC-15|YC-15]].<ref>Miles, Marvin. [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/660687842.html?dids=660687842:660687842&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+11%2C+1972&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=McDonnell%2C+Boeing+to+Compete+for+Lockheed+C-130+Successor&pqatl=google "McDonnell, Boeing to Compete for Lockheed C-130 Successor."] ''Los Angeles Times,'' 11 November 1972.</ref>  Though both entrants exceeded specified requirements, the AMST competition was canceled before a winner was selected. The Air Force started the C-X program in November 1979 to develop a larger AMST with longer range to augment its strategic airlift.<ref name=kennedy_part1>Kennedy 2004, pp. 3–20, 24.</ref>

[[File:Yc15-1 072.jpg|thumb|left|The [[McDonnell Douglas YC-15]] design was used as the basis for the C-17.|alt=Top view of cargo aircraft in-flight, trailed by a fighter chase aircraft. Under each un-swept wing are two engines suspended forward ahead the leading edge.]]

By 1980, the USAF found itself with a large fleet of aging [[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter|C-141 Starlifter]] cargo aircraft. Compounding matters, USAF needed increased strategic airlift capabilities to fulfill its rapid-deployment airlift requirements. The USAF set mission requirements and released a request for proposals (RFP) for C-X in October 1980. McDonnell Douglas elected to develop a new aircraft based on the YC-15; Boeing bid an enlarged three-engine version of its AMST YC-14. Lockheed submitted two designs, a C-5-based design and an enlarged C-141 design. On 28 August 1981, McDonnell Douglas was chosen to build its proposed aircraft, then designated ''C-17''. Compared to the YC-15, the new aircraft differed in having swept wings, increased size, and more powerful engines.<ref name=norton_p12-3>Norton 2001, pp. 12–13.</ref>  This would allow it to perform the work done by the C-141, and also fulfill some of the duties of the [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]], freeing the C-5 fleet for [[outsize cargo]].<ref name=norton_p12-3/>

Alternate proposals were pursued to fill airlift needs after the C-X contest.  These were lengthening of C-141As into C-141Bs, ordering more C-5s, continued purchases of KC-10s, and expansion of the [[Civil Reserve Air Fleet]].  Limited budgets reduced program funding, requiring a delay of four years.  During this time contracts were awarded for preliminary design work and for the completion of engine certification.<ref name=norton_p13-5/>  In December 1985, a full-scale development contract was awarded.<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/98482212.html?dids=98482212:98482212&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+03%2C+1986&author=The+Los+Angeles+Times&pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&desc=Douglas+Wins+%243.4B+Pact+to+Build+C-17&pqatl=google  "Douglas Wins $3.4B Pact to Build C-17."] ''Los Angeles Times,'' 3 January 1986.</ref>  At this time, first flight was planned for 1990.<ref name=norton_p13-5>Norton 2001, pp. 13, 15.</ref>  The Air Force had formed a requirement for 210 aircraft.<ref name=kennedy_p70>Kennedy 2004, pp. 70, 81–83.</ref>

===Development difficulties===
A static test of the C-17 wing in October 1992 resulted in the wing failing at 128% of design limit load, which was below the 150% requirement.  Both wings buckled rear to the front and failures occurred in stringers, spars and ribs.<ref>[http://www.dodig.mil/Audit/Audit2/93-159.pdf "Technical Assessment Report; C-17 Wing Structural Integrity."] ''Department of Defense'', 24 August 1993.

In April 1994, the C-17 program remained over budget, and did not meet weight, fuel burn, payload and range specifications. It also failed several key criteria during tests to evaluate its airworthiness.<ref>[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910528&slug=1285732 "Air Force Letter To Douglas Spells Out 75 Defects For C-17."] ''Los Angeles Times,'' 28 May 1991.</ref><ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LB&p_theme=lb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAE8F93D6E54ED8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM "C-17 fails engine start test."] ''Press-Telegram,'' 12 April 1994.</ref><ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CO&s_site=charlotte&p_multi=CO&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB6CC1343F2E14F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM "Parts Orders for C-17 far too high, GAO says."] ''Charlotte Observer,'' 16 March 1994.</ref>  There were technical problems with mission software, landing gear, and so on.<ref>[http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat3/151473.pdf "The C-17 Proposed Settlement and Program Update."] ''United States General Accounting Office,''  28 April 1994.</ref>  In May 1994, a proposal to cut the aircraft's production to as few as 32 aircraft emerged, but was rescinded.<ref>Kreisher, Otto.

The C-5 has a lower LCN, but the USAF classify both in the same broad Load Classification Group (LCG). When considering runway dimensions and their load ratings, the C-17's worldwide runway advantage over the C-5 shrank from 6,400 to 911 airfields.<ref name=airfields>[http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat3/152088.pdf "Comparison of C-5 and C-17 Airfield Availability."] ''United States General Accounting Office,'' July 1994.</ref>  However, the C-17's ability to use lower quality, austere airfields was not considered.<ref name=airfields/>

A January 1995 GAO report revealed that while the original C-17 budget was $41.8 billion for 210 aircraft, the 120 aircraft already ordered at that point had already cost $39.5 billion.<ref>[http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/ns95026.pdf "C-17 Aircraft – Cost and Performance Issues."] ''United States General Accounting Office,'' January 1995.</ref>  In March 1994, the U.S. Army had decided it no longer needed the {{convert|60000|lb|abbr=on}} [[Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System]] (LAPES) delivery with the C-17, feeling that the {{convert|42000|lb|abbr=on}} capability of the C-130 was sufficient; C-17 testing was limited to this lower weight.  Issues with airflow prevented the C-17 from meeting its airdrop requirements. A February 1997 GAO report revealed that a C-17 with a full payload could not land on {{convert|3000|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} wet runways; simulations suggested {{convert|5000|ft|abbr=on}} was required.<ref name=GAO_Joint_Endevour>[http://www.gao.gov/archive/1997/ns97050.pdf "C-17 Globemaster – Support of Operation Joint Endeavor."] ''United States General Accounting Office,'' February 1997.</ref>

Because of a dwindling order backlog, Boeing was to deliver 13 C-17s in 2011. The company is transitioning to a lower production rate of 10 C-17s per year, from a high of 16 per year, to extend the production line through 2012 as it works to sign additional international orders. The C-17 production line was previously slated to be closed several times, but was extended because of new orders being received. The C-17 workforce will be reduced by approximately 1,100 through the end of 2012, mostly through the elimination of a second shift at the C-17 final assembly plant in Long Beach.<ref>Vivanco, Fernando and Jerry Drelling.

==Design==
[[File:82nd Airborne paratroopers in a C-17.jpg|thumb|82nd Airborne paratroopers seated before an airdrop|alt=Paratroopers in four rows sit strapped in.]]

The C-17 is {{convert|174|ft|m}} long and has a wingspan of about {{convert|170|ft|m}}. It can airlift cargo fairly close to a battle area. The size and weight of U.S. mechanized firepower and equipment have grown in recent decades from increased air mobility requirements, particularly for large or heavy non-palletized [[outsize cargo]].

The C-17 is powered by four [[Pratt & Whitney PW2000|Pratt & Whitney F117-PW-100]] [[turbofan]] engines, which are based on the commercial [[Pratt & Whitney PW2000|Pratt and Whitney PW2040]] used on the [[Boeing 757]].  Each engine is rated at 40,400&nbsp;lb<sub>f</sub> (180&nbsp;kN) of thrust. The engine's [[thrust reversal|thrust reversers]] direct engine exhaust air upwards and forward, reducing the chances of [[foreign object damage]] by ingestion of runway debris, and providing enough reverse thrust to back the aircraft up on the ground while taxiing. The thrust reversers can also be used in flight at idle-reverse for added drag in maximum-rate descents.

[[File:C-17 no169 landing.jpg|thumb|left|C-17 landing, showing its landing gear]]

The aircraft requires a crew of three (pilot, copilot, and loadmaster) for cargo operations. Cargo is loaded through a large aft ramp that accommodates rolling stock, such as a 69-ton (63-metric ton) [[M1 Abrams]] [[main battle tank]], other armored vehicles, trucks, and trailers, along with [[463L master pallet|palletized cargo]]. The cargo compartment is 88 feet (26.82 m) long by 18 feet (5.49 m) wide by 12 feet 4&nbsp;inches (3.76 m) high. The cargo floor has rollers for palletized cargo that can be flipped to provide a flat floor suitable for vehicles and other rolling stock.

[[File:C-17 Globemaster III cockpit.jpg|thumb|C-17 Globemaster III cockpit]]
Maximum payload of the C-17 is 170,900&nbsp;lb (77,500&nbsp;kg), and its [[Maximum Takeoff Weight]] is 585,000&nbsp;lb (265,350&nbsp;kg). With a payload of 160,000&nbsp;lb (72,600&nbsp;kg) and an initial cruise altitude of 28,000&nbsp;ft (8,500 m), the C-17 has an unrefueled range of about 2,400 nautical miles (4,400&nbsp;km) on the first 71 aircraft, and 2,800 nautical miles (5,200&nbsp;km) on all subsequent extended-range models that include sealed center wing bay as a fuel tank.

[[File:C17 aircraft alt.jpg|thumb|USAF C-17 Globemaster IIIs on a low-level training mission over the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] in the eastern U.S.]]

The U.S. Air Force originally planned to buy a total of 120 C-17s, with the last one being scheduled for delivery in November 2004. The fiscal 2000 budget funded another 14 aircraft, primarily for [[Air Mobility Command]] (AMC) support of the [[United States Special Operations Command]] (USSOCOM). Basing of the original 120 C-17s was with the [[437th Airlift Wing]] and [[315th Airlift Wing]] at Charleston AFB, South Carolina, the [[62nd Airlift Wing]] and [[446th Airlift Wing]] at [[McChord Air Force Base]], Washington (first aircraft arrived in July 1999), the [[Air Education and Training Command]]'s (AETC) [[97th Air Mobility Wing]] at [[Altus Air Force Base|Altus AFB]], Oklahoma, and the [[Air Mobility Command]]-gained [[172nd Airlift Wing]] of the [[Mississippi Air National Guard]] at [[Jackson-Evers International Airport]]/ANGB, Mississippi.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Basing of the additional 13 aircraft went to AMC's [[305th Air Mobility Wing]] and its [[Air Force Reserve Command]] (AFRC) "associate" unit, the [[514th Air Mobility Wing]], at [[McGuire Air Force Base]], New Jersey; the [[Pacific Air Forces]] (PACAF) [[3rd Wing]] and the collocated [[Alaska Air National Guard]]'s [[176th Wing]] at [[Elmendorf Air Force Base]], Alaska in a shared associate arrangement; PACAF's [[15th Airlift Wing]] and the [[Hawaii Air National Guard]]'s [[154th Wing]] at [[Hickam Air Force Base]], Hawaii, also in a shared associate arrangement; and AMC's [[60th Air Mobility Wing]] and its AFRC "associate" unit, the [[349th Air Mobility Wing]], at [[Travis Air Force Base]], California. An additional 60 units were ordered in May 2002. In FY 2006, eight C-17s were delivered to [[March Joint Air Reserve Base]], California; to be controlled by the [[Air Force Reserve Command]] (AFRC), assigned to the [[452d Air Mobility Wing]]. In 2007, Congress appropriated funds for 10 additional USAF C-17s, bringing the total planned fleet size to 190. Additional aircraft were subsequently assigned to AMC's [[436th Airlift Wing]] and its AFRC "associate" unit, the [[512th Airlift Wing]], at [[Dover Air Force Base]], Delaware, supplementing the wing's [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]] aircraft.<ref>http://www.dover.af.mil/units/index.asp</ref> In 2011, the [[New York Air National Guard]]'s [[105th Airlift Wing]] at [[Stewart Air National Guard Base]], New York, also began transitioning from the C-5 to the C-17, completing its transition in 2012.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The C-17 have been, and continue to be, used to deliver military goods and [[humanitarian aid]] during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in Afghanistan as well as [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] in Iraq. On 26 March 2003, 15 USAF C-17s participated in the biggest combat airdrop since the [[United States invasion of Panama]] in December 1989: the night-time airdrop of 1,000 paratroopers from the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team (United States)|173rd Airborne Brigade]] occurred over Bashur, Iraq. The airdrop of paratroopers were followed by C-17s ferrying M1 Abrams, M2 Bradleys, M113s and artillery.<ref>Anderson, Jon R.

Retrieved: 8 June 2011.</ref> USAF C-17s have also been used to assist allies in their airlift requirements, including Canadian vehicles to Afghanistan in 2003 and the deployment of Australian forces during the [[Operation Astute|Australian-led military deployment to East Timor]] in 2006. In late 2006, USAF C-17s flew 15 Canadian [[Leopard 1#Canada2|Leopard C2 tanks]] from Kyrgyzstan into Kandahar in support of the NATO mission in Afghanistan. In 2013 five USAF C-17 Globemaster III cargo planes supported French operations in Mali, operating with other C-17s (RAF, NATO and RCAF deployed a single C-17 each).

A C-17 accompanies the President of the United States on his visits to both domestic and foreign arrangements, consultations, and meetings.

===Royal Air Force===
Boeing has marketed the C-17 to many European nations including Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. The [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) has established an aim of having interoperability and some weapons and capabilities commonality with the USAF. The UK's 1998 [[Strategic Defence Review]] identified a requirement for a strategic airlifter. The Short-Term Strategic Airlift (STSA) competition commenced in September of that year, however tendering was canceled in August 1999 with some bids identified by ministers as too expensive, including the Boeing/[[British Aerospace|BAe]] C-17 bid, and others unsuitable.<ref name=business>O'Connell, Dominic. "Political clash haunts MoD deal decision." ''The Business (Sunday Business Group),'' 5 December 1999.</ref> The project continued, with the C-17 seen as the favorite.<ref name=business/> In the light of continuing delays to the [[Airbus A400M]] program, the UK [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]], [[Geoff Hoon]], announced in May 2000 that the RAF would lease four C-17s at an annual cost of [[Pound sterling|£]]100 million<ref name=avweek_20060313/> from Boeing for an initial seven years with an optional two-year extension. The RAF had the option to buy the aircraft or return them to Boeing. The UK committed to upgrading its C-17s in line with the USAF so that if they were to be returned to Boeing, the USAF could adopt them.

The first C-17 was delivered to the RAF at Boeing's Long Beach facility on 17 May 2001 and flown to [[RAF Brize Norton]] by a crew from [[No. 99 Squadron RAF|No. 99 Squadron]] which had previously trained with USAF crews to gain competence on the type. The RAF's fourth C-17 was delivered on 24 August 2001. The RAF aircraft were some of the first to take advantage of the new center wing fuel tank found in Block 13 aircraft. In RAF service, the C-17 has not been given an [[British military aircraft designation systems|official designation]] (for example, C-130J referred to as Hercules C4 or C5), but is referred to simply as the C-17 or "C-17A Globemaster".

[[File:Royal Air Force C-17 August 2010.jpg|thumb|RAF C-17 at RAF Lakenheath, August 2010]]

The RAF declared itself delighted with the C-17. Although the Globemaster fleet was to be a fallback for the A400M, the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) announced on 21 July 2004 that they had elected to buy their four C-17s at the end of the lease,<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/review-turns-up-the-heat-on-eurofighter-186087/ "Review turns up the heat on eurofighter"]. ''Flight International'', 22 July 2004.</ref> even though the A400M appeared to be moving closer to production. While the A400M is described as a "strategic" airlifter, the C-17 gives the RAF strategic capabilities that it would not wish to lose, for example a maximum payload of 169,500&nbsp;lb (77,000&nbsp;kg) compared to the A400M's 82,000&nbsp;lb (37,000&nbsp;kg).<ref name=avweek_20060313/>

The C-17 was considered to be favored over the A400M as it was a "proven aircraft" and was already in production. One major requirement from the RAAF was the ability to airlift the [[Australian Army|Army's]] new M1 Abrams tanks; another requirement was immediate delivery. Though unstated, commonality with the USAF and the United Kingdom's RAF was also considered advantageous. The aircraft for the RAAF were ordered directly from the USAF production run, and are identical to American C-17 even in paint scheme, the only difference being the [[Military aircraft insignia|national marking]]s.

===Royal Canadian Air Force===

Canada's air arm has had a long-standing need for strategic airlift for humanitarian and military operations around the world. It had followed a pattern similar to the [[German Air Force]] in leasing [[Antonov]]s and [[Ilyushin]]s for many of its needs, including deploying the [[Disaster Assistance Response Team]] (DART) to tsunami-stricken Sri Lanka in 2005. The air service was forced to rely entirely on leased [[Antonov An-124|An-124 ''Ruslan'']] for a [[Canadian Army]] [[Operation Halo|deployment to Haiti]] in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The service has also used a combination of leased ''Ruslans'', Ilyushins and USAF C-17s for moving heavy equipment into Afghanistan.
