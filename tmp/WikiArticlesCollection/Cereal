A '''cereal''' is a [[Poaceae|grass]], in the [[Monocotyledon|monocot]] family [[Poaceae|Poaceae, also known as Gramineae]],<ref>The seeds of several other plants, such as [[buckwheat]], are also used in the same manner as grains, but since they are not grasses, they cannot strictly be called such</ref> cultivated for the edible components of their [[food grain|grain]] (botanically, a type of [[fruit]] called a [[caryopsis]]), composed of the [[endosperm]], [[cereal germ|germ]], and [[bran]]. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}; they are therefore [[staple food|staple crops]].

In their natural form (as in ''[[whole grain]]''), they are a rich source of [[vitamin]]s, [[mineral]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, oils, and [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]. However, when refined by the removal of the [[bran]] and [[cereal germ|germ]], the remaining [[endosperm]] is mostly [[carbohydrate]] and lacks the majority of the other nutrients. In some [[developing nation]]s, grain in the form of [[rice]], [[wheat]], [[millet]], or [[maize]] constitutes a majority of daily sustenance. In [[developed nations]], cereal consumption is moderate and varied but still substantial.

The word ''cereal'' derives from ''[[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]]'', the name of the Roman goddess of harvest and agriculture.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
The first cereal grains were [[domesticated]] about 12,000 years ago by ancient farming communities in the [[Fertile Crescent]] region. [[Emmer|Emmer wheat]], [[einkorn wheat]], and [[barley]] were three of the so-called [[Neolithic founder crops]] in the development of [[agriculture]]. The name comes from the word "Ceres", the Roman goddess of the harvest.

==Production==
The following table shows annual production of cereals, in 1961,<ref>1961 is the earliest year for which [[FAO]] statistics are available.</ref> 2008, 2009, and 2010 ranked by 2010 production.<ref name="prodstat">{{cite web | url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx | title=ProdSTAT | work=FAOSTAT | accessdate=2006-12-26}}</ref> All but [[buckwheat]] and [[quinoa]] are true grasses (these two are '''[[pseudocereal]]s''').

Maize, wheat and rice together accounted for 87% of all grain production worldwide, and 43% of all food calories in 2003,<ref name="prodstat"/> while the production of oats and rye have drastically fallen from their 1960s levels.
Other grains that are important in some places, but that have little production globally (and are not included in [[FAO]] statistics), include:
* [[Teff]], popular in [[Ethiopia]] but scarcely known elsewhere. This ancient grain is a staple in Ethiopia. It is high in fiber and protein. Its flour is often used to make [[injera]]. It can also be eaten as a warm breakfast cereal similar to [[farina (food)|farina]] with a chocolate or nutty flavor. Its flour and whole grain products can usually be found in natural foods stores.
* [[Wild rice]], grown in small amounts in North America
* [[Amaranth grain|Amaranth]], ancient pseudocereal, formerly a staple crop of the [[Aztec Empire]] and now widely grown in Africa
* [[Kañiwa]], close relative of [[quinoa]]

Several other species of wheat have also been domesticated, some very early in the history of agriculture:
* [[Spelt]], a close relative of common wheat
* [[Einkorn]], a wheat species with a single grain
* [[Emmer]], one of the first crops domesticated in the [[Fertile Crescent]]
* [[Durum]], the only [[tetraploid]] species of wheat currently cultivated, used to make [[semolina]]
* [[Kamut]], an ancient relative of durum with an unknown history

== Farming ==
[[File:040719 172 dorset marnhull.jpg|thumb|220px|A wheat field in [[Dorset]], England.]]
While each individual species has its own peculiarities, the cultivation of all cereal crops is similar. Most are [[annual plant]]s; consequently one planting yields one harvest. Wheat, rye, triticale, oats, barley, and spelt are the "cool-season" cereals.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} These are hardy plants that grow well in moderate weather and cease to grow in hot weather (approximately 30 °C but this varies by species and variety). The "warm-season" cereals are tender and prefer hot weather. Barley and rye are the hardiest cereals, able to overwinter in the [[subarctic]] and [[Siberia]]. Many cool-season cereals are grown in the tropics. However, some are only grown in cooler highlands, where it may be possible to grow multiple crops in a year.

For a few decades, however, there has also been increasing interest in [[perennial]] grain plants. This interest developed due to advantages in erosion control, reduced need of fertiliser, and potential lowered costs to the farmer. Though research is still in early stages, [[The Land Institute]] in Salina, Kansas has been able to create a few cultivars that produce a fairly good crop yield.<ref>[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/big-idea/perennial-grains-text Perennial grains being created at the Land Institute]</ref>

=== Planting ===
The warm-season cereals are grown in tropical lowlands year-round and in temperate climates during the frost-free season. Rice is commonly grown in flooded fields, though some strains are grown on dry land. Other warm climate cereals, such as [[sorghum]], are adapted to arid conditions.

Cool-season cereals are well-adapted to temperate climates. Most varieties of a particular species are either '''winter''' or '''spring''' types. Winter varieties are sown in the autumn, germinate and grow vegetatively, then become [[dormancy|dormant]] during winter. They resume growing in the springtime and mature in late spring or early summer. This cultivation system makes optimal use of water and frees the land for another crop early in the growing season.

Winter varieties do not flower until springtime because they require [[vernalization]]: exposure to low temperature for a genetically determined length of time. Where winters are too warm for vernalization or exceed the hardiness of the crop (which varies by species and variety), farmers grow spring varieties. Spring cereals are planted in early springtime and mature later that same summer, without vernalization. Spring cereals typically require more irrigation and yield less than winter cereals.

=== Period ===
Once the cereal plants have grown their seeds, they have completed their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. The plants die and become brown and dry. As soon as the parent plants and their seed kernels are reasonably dry, harvest can begin.

In developed countries, cereal crops are universally machine-harvested, typically using a [[combine harvester]], which cuts, [[threshing|threshes]], and [[winnowing|winnows]] the grain during a single pass across the field. In developing countries, a variety of harvesting methods are in use, depending on the cost of labor, from combines to hand tools such as the [[scythe]] or [[cradle (grain)|cradle]].

If a crop is harvested during wet weather, the grain may not dry adequately in the field to prevent spoilage during its storage. In this case, the grain is sent to a dehydrating facility, where artificial heat dries it.

In North America, farmers commonly deliver their newly harvested grain to a [[grain elevator]], a large storage facility that consolidates the crops of many farmers. The farmer may sell the grain at the time of delivery or maintain ownership of a share of grain in the pool for later sale.
Storage facilities should be protected from small grain pests, rodents and birds.

== Nutritional facts ==
Some grains are deficient in the [[essential amino acid]] [[lysine]]. That is why many vegetarian cultures, in order to get a balanced diet, combine their diet of grains with [[legumes]]. Many legumes, on the other hand, are deficient in the essential amino acid [[methionine]], which grains contain. Thus a [[protein combining|combination]] of legumes with [[Food grain|grains]] forms a well-balanced diet for vegetarians. Common examples of such combinations are [[dal]] (lentils) with [[rice]] by [[South India]]ns and [[Bengali people|Bengalis]], dal with wheat in [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]], and [[beans]] with corn tortillas, [[tofu]] with rice, and [[peanut butter]] with wheat bread (as sandwiches) in several other cultures, including Americans.<ref name= vogel301>Vogel, Steven.
