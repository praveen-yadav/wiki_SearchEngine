'''Barbagia''' ({{lang-sc|Barbàgia}} or {{lang|sc|''Barbàza''}}) is a mountain area of inner [[Sardinia]]. It is a [[natural region]] mostly comprised in the [[province of Nuoro]] and located alongside the [[Gennargentu]] massif.

The name comes from [[Cicero]], who described it as a land of ''[[barbarians]]''. This word derives from the Greek Βάρβαρος-ου, which means stuttering. The inhabitants were also known, by the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], with the pejorative term  ''latrones mastrucati'', which means "thieves with a rough garment in wool". Roman domination in this area of Sardinia was never more than nominal.

The area is usually divided into four Barbagias: the Barbagia di [[Ollolai]], the [[Barbagia di Seulo]], the [[Barbagia di Belvì]] and the [[Mandrolisai]]. The latter is named after a sub-region, and the others after their main villages.

The area is full of hard hills, and there is little human presence. In fact, Barbagia is one of the least populated areas in Europe. These facts have allowed Barbagia to preserve its cultural and natural treasures. The language spoken is [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], including its internal varieties (both [[Logudorese dialect|Nuorese]] and [[Campidanese dialect|Campidanese]] dialects).

One of the most important towns is [[Gavoi]]. [[Orgosolo]] was famous for its bandits and kidnappers and typical [[murals]]. [[Oliena]] is well known for its [[wine]]s (especially the Nepente, a  wine made with [[Cannonau]] grapes). Another well known town is [[Fonni]], being the highest town in Sardinia, More than 1,000 meters above sea level. Fonni is also the gateway to the Gennargentu mountain system.

The economy consists of agriculture, sheep breeding, art and tradition related business, tourism and light industry.
