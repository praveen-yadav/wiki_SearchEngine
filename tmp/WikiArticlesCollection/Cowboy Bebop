{{nihongo|'''''Cowboy Bebop'''''|カウボーイビバップ|Kaubōi Bibappu}} is a 1998 Japanese [[anime]] series developed by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]]. It featured a production team led by director [[Shinichirō Watanabe]], screenwriter [[Keiko Nobumoto]], character designer [[Toshihiro Kawamoto]], mechanical designer [[Kimitoshi Yamane]], and composer [[Yoko Kanno]]. The twenty-six episodes (sessions) of the series are set in the year 2071. It follows the adventures, misadventures and tragedies of a [[bounty hunter]] crew travelling on the ''Bebop'', their starship. ''Cowboy Bebop'' explores philosophical concepts including [[existentialism]], [[existential]] [[ennui]], [[loneliness]], and the past's influence.<ref name="STAFF PICKS: OLD SCHOOL CARTOONS">{{cite web|title=STAFF PICKS: OLD SCHOOL CARTOONS|first=Mary|publisher=The Vault Magazine|url=http://www.thevaultmag.com/archives/1173|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}</ref>

The [[television program|series]] premiered in Japan on [[TV Tokyo]] from April 3 until June 26, 1998, broadcasting only twelve episodes and a special due to its controversial adult-themed content. The entire twenty-six episodes of the series were later broadcast on [[WOWOW]] from October 24 until April 24, 1999. The anime was adapted into two [[manga]] series which were serialized in [[Kadokawa Shoten]]'s [[Asuka Fantasy DX]]. A [[Cowboy Bebop: The Movie|film]] was later released to theaters worldwide.

The anime series was dubbed in the [[English language]] by [[Animaze]] and ZRO Limit Productions, and was licensed by [[Bandai Entertainment]] in North America and is now licensed by [[Funimation]]. For English releases in the United Kingdom, it was licensed by [[Beez Entertainment]] and is now licensed by Anime Limited. [[Madman Entertainment]] has licensed it for releases in Australia and New Zealand. In 2001, ''Cowboy Bebop'' became the first anime title to be broadcast on [[Adult Swim]] in the United States.

''Cowboy Bebop'' became a critical and commercial success both in Japanese and international markets, most notably in the United States. The series garnered several major anime and [[science fiction]] awards from Japanese publications, and received universal praise for its style, characters, story, voice acting, animation and soundtrack. In the years since its release, critics and reviewers, from the United States in particular, have hailed ''Cowboy Bebop'' as a masterpiece and frequently cite it as one of the greatest anime series of all time. Credited with helping introduce anime to a new wave of Western viewers in the early 2000s, ''Cowboy Bebop'' has also been labelled a gateway series for the medium as a whole.

==Plot==
{{Main|List of Cowboy Bebop episodes}}

===Setting===
The series is set in the year 2071, when the entire [[Solar System]] has been made accessible through hyperspace gates. In 2022, an explosion of an experimental hyperspace gateway severely damages the [[Moon]], resulting in a debris ring and meteor bombardments that eradicate a large portion of the [[Earth]]'s population. As a result, many survivors abandon the barely habitable Earth to colonize the [[inner planets]], the [[asteroid belt]] and the [[moons of Jupiter]].<ref name="Cowboy Bebop: The Movie… At Last2">{{cite web|title=Cowboy Bebop: The Movie… At Last|page=2|date=March 31, 2003|last=Patten|first=Fred|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/anime/icowboy-bebop-moviei-last/page/2%2C1|accessdate=May 2, 2012}}</ref><ref name="SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...GAMING IN THE WORLD OF COWBOY BEBOP">{{cite web|title=SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...GAMING IN THE WORLD OF COWBOY BEBOP|last=Surbrook|first=Michael|publisher=SURBROOK'S STUFF|url=http://surbrook.devermore.net/adaptationsanime/bebop/cbseeyou.html|accessdate=May 2, 2012}}</ref>

[[Mars]] has become the new central hub of human civilization, and interplanetary [[crime syndicate]]s exert influence over the government and the ''Inter-Solar System Police'' (ISSP), limiting their effectiveness. As a result, a [[bounty system]] similar to that in the [[Old West]] is established to deal with fugitives, terrorists, and other criminals; the bounty hunters involved are frequently termed "cowboys".<ref name="Cowboy Bebop: The Movie… At Last2"/> The standard currency is the ''woolong'', which is roughly equivalent to the present-day [[Japanese yen]].<ref name="SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...GAMING IN THE WORLD OF COWBOY BEBOP"/>

The technology in Cowboy Bebop's world is a mixture of futuristic ([[cybernetic]]s, jump gates, energy weapons) and modern (wheeled cars, handguns, zippo-styled lighters). Yet, even advanced technology often looks a bit older and battered.<ref name="SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...GAMING IN THE WORLD OF COWBOY BEBOP"/>

The three main classes of vehicles present are ground vehicles, air vehicles and space vehicles. Ground vehicles are wheeled automobiles not much different from modern automobiles. Aircraft are mostly [[Jet engine|jet-powered]], although helicopters are also seen. Spaceships range in size from small one-man [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] to immense passenger liners and cargo ships.<ref name="SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...GAMING IN THE WORLD OF COWBOY BEBOP"/>

===Story===
The  series revolves around the adventures undertaken by the crew of the spaceship ''Bebop''. The crew is made up of five main characters: Spike Spiegel, an exiled hitman of the ruthless Red Dragon Syndicate; Jet Black, a former ISSP officer who retired following a mob hit that cost him his arm; Faye Valentine, an amnesiac con artist who awakened in the future after a lengthy period of cryogenic hibernation; "Radical" Edward, a barefooted preteen girl who is a prolific computer hacker; and Ein, a hyper-intelligent, genetically-engineered [[Welsh Corgi]] dog.

Throughout the series, ''Bebop'' crew members deal with unresolved issues from their pasts, and the show regularly utilizes [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s to illustrate the history of the main characters. The day-to-day life of the crew is also explored throughout the series.

===Characters===
{{Main|List of Cowboy Bebop characters}}
[[File:Cowboy-bebop-754433.jpg|thumb|left|250px|From left to right: Ein, Edward, Spike Spiegel, Jet Black and Faye Valentine]]
*[[Spike Spiegel]] is a former member of the Red Dragon Crime Syndicate. Spike is a master in firearms and hand-to-hand combat, practicing [[Jeet Kune Do]], and is also a skilled pilot. He flies a red customized ''Mono Racer'', an atmosphere-capable spacecraft called ''Swordfish II''. His right eye is [[cybernetic]]. He is haunted by the memory of his time in the syndicate, and particularly by his romantic relationship with a mysterious woman named [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Julia|Julia]], and his conflict with arch-rival and former syndicate partner, [[Vicious (Cowboy Bebop)|Vicious]]. He is also a pickpocket. He is the first bounty hunter to debut.

*[[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Jet Black|Jet Black]] is a former ISSP (Inter-Solar System Police) detective and is the owner of the ''Bebop''. Once called ''The Black Dog'' by his fellow officers, he left the ISSP in disgust due to its corruption and red tape, and turned to bounty hunting as a way to apply justice. Although medical science could replace his lost arm, he voluntarily wears a [[cybernetic]] prosthetic as a reminder of the consequences of rushing into danger. He also owns a small yellow utility ship called ''Hammerhead''. The ''Hammerhead'' has been equipped with a mechanical claw, and a harpoon that can be used as a tow cable. Like Spike, he too is haunted by the memory of a woman, ''Alisa'', his longtime girlfriend who left him without reason. He is the second bounty hunter to debut.

*[[Faye Valentine]] is a novice bounty hunter with a gambling addiction. She joins the crew of the ''Bebop'' uninvited, to the consternation of Jet and Spike. Though she abandons the ship several times during the course of the series, her attachment to the crew always brings her back. These feelings are apparently reciprocated, as Jet and Spike always allow her to return despite claiming they're pleased to see her leave. She pilots a generic heavy spacecraft called ''Red Tail,'' which gets its name from the red flap on the back of the otherwise pale blue ship, and has been heavily modified with armament and tracking sensors. Her gambling, cheating, and competitive skills are unrivaled except by Spike. Much of her past and her real last name are a mystery, however it appears that she was severely injured in a space shuttle accident and was then cryogenically frozen until she could be healed. This expensive medical procedure left her deeply in debt, made worse when she inherited the debts of her husband (a man who married her shortly after her surgery, then later faked his death in an automobile accident). She emerges from the cryonic sleep in an amnesiac state, from which she eventually recovers. All vestiges of her past — home, family, possessions — are gone. She is the fourth bounty hunter to debut.

*[[Radical Edward|Edward]] is a young computer genius and master [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]]. She uses the alias ''Radical Edward'' when hacking. Ed is a girl, though her name and androgynous appearance suggest otherwise. She had followed the travels of the ''Bebop'' before encountering the ship, and agrees to help the crew track down a bounty-head in exchange for becoming a member of the crew. Although extremely intelligent, Ed is still a child, and looks up to the crew of the Bebop as members of her family. She uses the fanciful name ''Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivruski IV'', but an odd encounter with her father reveals that her real name is Françoise Appledelhi. She spends much of her time with Ein. She is the fifth and last bounty hunter to debut.

*[[Eine bebop|Ein]] is a [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi]], a former lab animal identified as a "data dog" by the scientists who reared him. The scientists used him for unspecified experiments, enhancing him to give him extraordinary data-sniffing and pattern-recognition abilities. It is suggested that he possesses enhanced intelligence, which he subtly displays throughout the series, including showing the ability to speak to other animals (and possibly Ed), and perfectly hacking the ''Scratch'' website in session #23. The rest of the ''Bebop'' crew, with the exception of Ed, often fail to notice these qualities and treat Ein as an average pet. He is the third bounty hunter to debut.

*[[Vicious (Cowboy Beebop)|Vicious]] is a grim enforcer of the Red Dragon Crime Syndicate, a former friend of Spike and now his nemesis. Vicious wields a [[katana]] for a weapon and is always accompanied by a strange, crow-like bird perched on his shoulder. He lives up to his name both through his violent actions and his treacherous scheming within the syndicate. Vicious is the series' only recurring antagonist, appearing in five episodes.

==Production==
In the late 1990s the [[Space opera|space]] [[Adventure novel|adventure]] [[genre]] was a very popular [[TV]] theme in Japan. Notable examples of such include [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]]'s [[Outlaw Star]] and [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]]'s [[Trigun]]. Sunrise became very enthusiastic to create a series of the same genre and consequently assigned its top talents towards its development.<ref name="Cowboy Bebop: The Movie… At Last1">{{cite web|title=Cowboy Bebop: The Movie… At Last|page=1|date=March 31, 2003|last=Patten|first=Fred|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/anime/icowboy-bebop-moviei-last/page/1%2C1|accessdate=May 2, 2012}}</ref>

The leader of the creative team was director [[Shinichiro Watanabe]], most notable at the time for directing [[Macross Plus]], the futuristic adventure anime [[OVA]] series, and [[Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory]].<ref name="Cowboy Bebop: The Movie… At Last1"/> Other leading members of Sunrise's creative team were screenwriter [[Keiko Nobumoto]], character designer [[Toshihiro Kawamoto]], mechanical art designer [[Kimitoshi Yamane]] and composer [[Yoko Kanno]]. Most of them had previously worked together, in addition to having credits on other popular anime titles. Nobumoto had scripted ''Macross Plus'', Kawamoto had designed the characters for ''Gundam'', and Kanno had composed the music for ''Macross Plus'' and [[The Vision of Escaflowne]]. Yamane had not worked with Watanabe yet, but his credits in anime included [[Bubblegum Crisis]] and The Vision of Escaflowne.<ref name="Cowboy Bebop: The Movie… At Last2"/>
 
Watanabe wanted to create a program that would also appeal to adults, exploring a number of [[philosophical]] concepts and themes in the process. The most important of the many elements of ''Cowboy Bebop'' were its [[existentialist]] and philosophical concepts.<ref name="Cowboy Bebop: The Movie… At Last2"/> The dialogue of the series was kept "clean", but its level of sophistication was appropriate to adults in a criminal milieu. Themes such as [[drug dealing]] and [[homosexuality]] were key elements of some episodes.<ref name="Cowboy Bebop: The Movie… At Last3">{{cite web|title=Cowboy Bebop: The Movie… At Last|page=3|date=March 31, 2003|last=Patten|first=Fred|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/anime/icowboy-bebop-moviei-last/page/3%2C1|accessdate=May 2, 2012}}</ref>

The series' art direction centers on [[Music of the United States|American music]] and [[counterculture]], especially the [[Beat Generation|beat]] and [[jazz]] movements of the 1940s–1960s and the early [[rock and roll]] era of the 1950s–1970s, which the original soundtrack by [[Yoko Kanno]] and [[the Seatbelts]] defines.<ref name="Nicholas1">"Yoko Kanno's score is equally eclectic, evoking Charlie Parker, Charlie Musselwhite, Johnny Cash and U2." {{cite web|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p90930_index.html|title='The Work Which Becomes a New Genre Itself': Textual Networks in the World of Cowboy Bebop |accessdate=2009-10-08|publisher=All Academic, Inc|date=June 16, 2006|author=Kyle Nicholas|work=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, Dresden International Congress Centre, Dresden, Germany}}</ref>

The atmospheres of the planets and racial groups in ''Cowboy Bebop'' mostly originate from Watanabe's ideas, with some collaboration from set designers [[Isamu Imakake]], [[Shoji Kawamori]], and Dai Satou. The staff of ''Cowboy Bebop'' established the particular atmospheres early in the production. In early production, ethnic groups were not fully established. Watanabe wanted to have many racial groups appear in ''Cowboy Bebop''.<ref name="AnimeGuide4p64">{{cite book |title=Cowboy Bebop Anime Guide Volume 4|date=May 21, 2002|page=64|publisher=[[Tokyopop]]|isbn=1-931514-08-9}}</ref>

[[Mars]] was the planet most often used in storylines in ''Cowboy Bebop''. Satoshi Toba, the cultural and setting producer, explained that other planets "were unexpectedly difficult to use". Toba explained that each planet in ''Cowboy Bebop'' had unique features, and in the plot the producers had to take into account the characteristics of each planet. Toba explained that it was not possible for the staff of ''Cowboy Bebop'' to have a dramatic rooftop scene occur on [[Venus]], so "we ended up normally falling back to Mars".<ref name="AnimeGuide4p64"/>

==Analysis==

===Style and appeal===
Several planets and space stations in the series are shown to be made in the [[Earth]]'s image. The streets of [[celestial objects]] such as [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] resemble a modern [[port city]], while [[Mars]] is replete with shopping malls, theme parks, casinos and cities. ''Cowboy Bebop'''s universe is filled with video players and hyperspace gates, [[Green politics|eco-politics]] and fairgrounds, spaceships and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[shaman]]s. Futuristic elements are combined with the modern elements, "allowing audiences to easily connect with the ''Cowboy Bebop'' world".<ref name="BAIGENT">{{cite web|title=Cowboy Bebop: Complete Sessions Collection Review|year=2004|last=Baigent|first=Robert|publisher=Graduate Journal of Asia-Pacific Studies|url=http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/webdav/site/arts/shared/Departments/asian-studies/gjaps/docs-vol2/Baigent1.pdf|accessdate=May 13, 2012}}</ref>

In his review of ''Cowboy Bebop'', Miguel Douglas, editor-in-chief of iSugoi.com, describes the style of the series: 
<blockquote>the series distinctly establishes itself outside the realm of conventional [[Anime|Japanese animation]] and instead chooses to forge its own path. With a setting within the realm of [[science fiction]], the series wisely offers a world that seems entirely realistic considering our present time. Free from many of the elements that accompany science fiction in general — whether that be [[Extraterrestrial life|space aliens]], giant [[robot]]s, or [[laser gun]]s — the series delegates itself towards presenting a world that is quite similar to our own albeit showcasing some technological advances. Certainly not as pristine a future we would see in other series or films, ''Cowboy Bebop'' decides to deliver a future that closely reflects that of our own time. This aspect of familiarity does wonders in terms of relating to the viewer, and it presents a world that certainly resembles our very own.<ref name="Anime: Cowboy Bebop – Review">{{cite web|title=Anime Review: Cowboy Bebop - カウボーイビバップ - Kaubōi Bibappu |date=September 1, 2010|last=Douglas|first=Miguel|publisher=iSugoi|url=http://www.isugoi.com/cowboy-bebop-review/|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

Daryl Surat of [[Otaku USA]] commented on the series' "broad-ranging" appeal due to its style:
<blockquote>''Cowboy Bebop'' was that rare breed of science-fiction: "accessible". Unlike many anime titles, viewers weren’t expected to have knowledge of [[Culture of Asia|Asian culture]] — character names, signs, and the like were primarily in English to begin with — or have seen any other anime series prior.<ref name="Reflections on a Modern-Day Anime Relic">{{cite web|title=Cowboy Bebop: Reflections on a Modern-Day Anime Relic|date=December 16, 2010|last=Surat|first=Daryl|publisher=[[Otaku USA]]|url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/Cowboy_Bebop_3984.aspx|accessdate=May 13, 2012}}</ref> 
</blockquote>

[[Susan J. Napier]] argues, in her book [[Anime from Akira to Princess Mononoke: Experiencing Contemporary Japanese Animation]], that anime increasingly "exists at a nexus point in global culture…an amorphous new media territory that crosses and intermingles national boundaries". Napier goes on to point out that many Japanese commentators refer to anime with the term ''mukokuseki'', meaning "stateless".<ref name="Anime from Akira to Howl’s Moving Castle">{{cite book |last=Napier |first=Susan J. |title=Anime from Akira to Howl’s Moving Castle: Experiencing Japanese Animation |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2001 |pages=22–23 |isbn=1-4039-7052-1}}</ref> This implies that much anime is not specifically Japanese and therefore lacks a distinct national identity. Napier states that this "very quality of 'statelessness' has increasing attraction in our global culture". It is said that ''Cowboy Bebop'' reflects this and it is a great part of the show's appeal.<ref name="BAIGENT"/>

===Genre and cultural references===
[[File:CowboyBebopchurch.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Cowboy Bebop'' pays homage to several films. This scene from "Ballad of Fallen Angels" is influenced by [[John Woo]]'s ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]''.<ref name="BAIGENT"/><ref name="Mania Cowboy Bebop Vol. #1">{{cite web|author=Dustin Blaine Javier|url=http://www.mania.com/cowboy-bebop-vol-1_article_80691.html|title=Cowboy Bebop Vol. #1|publisher=Mania.com|date=February 7, 2002|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}</ref>]]
Watanabe's main inspiration for ''Cowboy Bebop'' was [[Lupin III]], a crime anime series from the late 1970s through the mid-1980s.<ref name="Cowboy Bebop: The Movie… At Last1"/> According to Watanabe, the series paid subtle tribute to his favorite American films and series, which were shown in Japan during that time, including [[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]], [[Bruce Lee]] films, films with [[blues]] or [[jazz]] soundtracks, as well as [[Blaxploitation]] films. Individual movies from [[Alien (film)|Alien]] to [[Midnight Run]] were [[pastiche]]d.<ref name="Cowboy Bebop: The Movie… At Last2"/>

The series covered [[genre]]s such as [[comedy]], [[Caper story|detective caper]], [[action game|action]] and [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]. The musical style was emphasized in many of the episode titles, which were in English, such as: ''Asteroid Blues'', ''Honky Tonk Woman'', ''Ballad of Fallen Angels'', ''Heavy Metal Queen'', etc.<ref name="Cowboy Bebop: The Movie… At Last2"/> The anime draws heavily on Western sources, such as [[Pulp magazine|pulp detective stories]], [[film noir]], and American [[Westerns]]. There are also strong [[Hong Kong]] influences, mainly of the [[heroic bloodshed]] mold which includes films such as [[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]] or [[Hard Boiled]].<ref name="SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...GAMING IN THE WORLD OF COWBOY BEBOP"/><ref name="Heroic Cowboy Bebop">{{cite web|author=Deni|url=http://www.heroic-cinema.com/reviews/cowboy-bebop-2000|title=Review: Cowboy Bebop (2000)|publisher=Heroic Cinema|date=January 25, 2006|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Final Shootout in Cowboy Bebop">{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.edmundyeo.com/2008/07/saturday-epic-anime-scene-final.html|title=Saturday Epic Anime Scene - Final Shootout in Cowboy Bebop|publisher=|date=July 20, 2008|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}</ref>

These continual borrowings from other genres and cultural products create a familiar access point for a western audience and perhaps in some part explain Cowboy Bebop's popularity. The sense of the familiar is emphasised and reinforced by popular culture references throughout the series. Kung fu films are an obvious influence. In ''Stray Dog Strut'' the final fight between Spike and Hakim is influenced by Bruce Lee's [[Game of Death]] while in ''Waltz for Venus'', Spike's kung fu lesson is similar to a scene from Lee's [[Enter the Dragon]].<ref name="BAIGENT"/>

[[File:CowboyBebopBigShot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Big Shot'', the fictional news source within ''Cowboy Bebop'' which provides information on various bounty heads.]]
The genre of the western is another influence on Cowboy Bebop. The most obvious reference is in the title of the show, immediately suggesting a lawless society. There are further examples throughout; a show called ''Big Shot'' informs the characters of the current bounties, the crew continually come across saloons and desert worlds and engage in gunfights and stand-offs. The show has a perpetual sense of lawlessness – both from the bounties they chase and from within the crew of the Bebop itself.<ref name="BAIGENT"/>

Similarly science fiction is another key influence, not only in the spaceship and the futuristic setting. A homage of the ''Alien'' films is made in the episode ''Toys in the Attic'' when an unseen predator stalks the crew. In ''Wild Horses'' the influence of [[Star Wars]] pervades throughout.<ref name="BAIGENT"/>

The flavor of film noir permeates Cowboy Bebop. This is especially prevalent in the character of Jet Black, a former cop who rails against the corruption of the police force but is thrown into a semi-lawless state of bounty hunting. As in film noir, characters are morally ambiguous – none more so than Faye Valentine who betrays her allies in the pursuit of a big bounty. The big-city rain-slicked settings of film noir are continually used, especially in the episode ''Ganymede Elegy''. Other visual and aural cues are also taken from film noir, in ''Pierrot Le Fou'' for instance, Spike battles an enraged homicidal clown across a fairground, accompanied by lighting and camera angles film noir would use.<ref name="BAIGENT"/><ref name="Film Noir Roots">{{cite web|author=Jeffries, L.B. |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/115481-the-film-noir-roots-of-cowboy-bebop|title=The Film Noir Roots of Cowboy Bebop|publisher=PopMatters|date=2010-01-19|accessdate=2012-01-25}}</ref>

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Cowboy Bebop}}
One of the most notable elements of ''Cowboy Bebop'' is its music. Episodes follow a different musical theme,<ref name="avclub-2009">{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Tasha |title=Gateways To Geekery: Anime |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/gateways-to-geekery-anime,24653/ |work= A.V. Club |publisher=[[The Onion]] |date= 2009-03-05 |accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref> and episode titles are borrowed from notable album or song names (e.g. [[Sympathy for the Devil]] and [[Bohemian Rhapsody]]) or make use of a genre name (''Mushroom Samba'' and ''Heavy Metal Queen'').

Performed by [[Yoko Kanno]] and [[Seatbelts (band)|Seatbelts]], a band Kanno assembled to perform music for the series, the jazz and blues themed soundtrack helps define the show as much as the characters, writing, and animation. ''Cowboy Bebop'' was voted by [[IGN]] in 2006 as having the greatest soundtrack for an [[anime]].<ref>[http://music.ign.com/articles/708/708910p1.html IGN: Top Ten Anime Themes and Soundtracks of All-Time], IGN.</ref>

==Distribution==

===Broadcast===

==Continuation rumors==
After the creation of the series, an interviewer asked Watanabe if he had any plans to create more ''Cowboy Bebop'' material. Watanabe responded by saying that he does not believe that he "should just keep on making ''Cowboy Bebop'' sequels for the sake of it". Watanabe added that ending production and "to quit while we're ahead when people still want more" is more "in keeping with the ''Bebop'' spirit".<ref name="WatanabeInterviewCBMovie">"[http://web.archive.org/web/20030307023145/www.cowboybebop.org/english/door/interview/index.html The Director's Voice Shinichiro Watanabe Interview]."
