'''Chagas disease''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɑː|ɡ|ə|s}}, or '''American trypanosomiasis''', is a [[tropical disease|tropical]] [[parasitic disease]] caused by the [[flagellate]] [[protozoa]]n ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]''. ''T. cruzi'' is commonly transmitted to humans and other mammals by an insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], the [[hematophagy|blood-sucking]] "kissing bugs" of the subfamily [[Triatominae]] (family [[Reduviidae]]), most commonly from species belonging to the ''[[Triatoma]]'', ''[[Rhodnius]]'', and ''[[Panstrongylus]]'' genera.<ref name=CDC/>

The disease may also be spread through [[blood transfusion]] and [[organ transplantation]], ingestion of food contaminated with [[Parasitism|parasites]], and [[vertical transmission|from a mother to her fetus]].<ref name=emed>{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/214581-overview |title=Chagas Disease (American Trypanosomiasis) |author=Louis V Kirchhoff |coauthors= |date=17 December 2010 |work=|publisher=eMedicine |accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>

The symptoms of Chagas disease vary over the course of an infection. In the early, acute stage, symptoms are mild and usually produce no more than local swelling at the site of infection. The initial acute phase is responsive to [[antiparasitic]] treatments, with 60–90% cure rates. After 4–8 weeks, individuals with active infections enter the chronic phase of Chagas disease, which is asymptomatic for 60–80% of chronically infected individuals through their lifetime.<ref name=Bern>{{cite journal |author=Bern C, Montgomery SP, Herwaldt BL, ''et al.'' |title=Evaluation and treatment of chagas disease in the United States: a systematic review |journal=JAMA |volume=298 |issue=18 |pages=2171–81 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=18000201 |doi=10.1001/jama.298.18.2171 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18000201|accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref><ref name=Rassi1>{{cite journal |author=Rassi A, Rassi A, Marin-Neto JA |title=Chagas disease |journal=Lancet |volume=375 |issue=9723 |pages=1388–402 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20399979 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60061-X |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(10)60061-X|accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref><ref name=Rassi2>{{cite journal |author=Rassi A, Dias JC, Marin-Neto JA, Rassi A |title=Challenges and opportunities for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of Chagas' disease |journal=Heart |volume=95 |issue=7 |pages=524–34 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19131444 |doi=10.1136/hrt.2008.159624 |url=http://heart.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19131444|accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>

The antiparasitic treatments also appear to delay or prevent the development of disease symptoms during the chronic phase of the disease, but 20–40% of chronically infected individuals will still eventually develop life-threatening heart and digestive system disorders. The currently available antiparasitic treatments for Chagas disease are [[benznidazole]] and [[nifurtimox]], which can cause temporary side effects in many patients including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.<ref name="Bern"/><ref name="Rassi1"/><ref name="Rassi2"/>

Chagas disease is contracted primarily in the Americas, particularly in poor, rural areas of [[Mexico]], Central America, and South America; very rarely, the disease has been found in the Southern United States. The insects that spread the disease are known by various local names, including ''vinchuca'' in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, ''barbeiro'' (the [[barber surgeon|barber]]) in Brazil, ''pito'' in Colombia, ''chinche'' in Central America, ''chipo'' in Venezuela, ''chupança'', ''chinchorro'', and "the kissing bug".

It is estimated that as many as 11 million people in Mexico, Central America and South America have Chagas disease, most of whom do not know they are infected. Large-scale population movements from rural to urban areas of Latin America and to other regions of the world have increased the geographic distribution of Chagas disease, and cases have been noted in many countries, particularly in Europe.<ref name=Rassi1/><ref name="Roca2011">{{cite journal

==Signs and symptoms==

[[File:Heart pathology Chagas disease.JPG|thumb|Gross anatomy of a heart that has been damaged by chronic Chagas disease&nbsp;– see also: [[:Image:Heart radiology Chagas disease.JPG|Chagas heart, radiology]]]]
The human disease occurs in two stages: an [[acute (medicine)|acute]] stage, which occurs shortly after an initial [[infection]], and a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] stage that develops over many years.

The acute phase lasts for the first few weeks or months of infection. It usually occurs unnoticed because it is symptom-free or exhibits only mild symptoms that are not unique to Chagas disease. These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and vomiting. The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a [[chagoma]]) where the parasite entered the body.<ref name=Guimaraes1968>{{cite journal | author=Guimarães FN, da Silva NN, Clausell DT, de Mello AL, Rapone T, Snell T, Rodrigues N| title=Um surto epidêmico de doença de Chagas de provável transmissão digestiva, ocorrido em Teutonia (Estrêla&nbsp;– Rio Grande Do Sul) | journal=Hospital (Rio J) | volume=73 | issue=6 | pages=1767–804| year=1968 |url=http://en.calameo.com/read/00000948401a1fdb85f76}}</ref>

The most recognized marker of acute Chagas disease is called Romaña's sign, which includes swelling of the eyelids on the side of the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye. Rarely, young children, or adults may die from the acute disease due to severe inflammation/infection of the heart muscle ([[myocarditis]]) or brain ([[meningoencephalitis]]).<ref name="Guimaraes1968"/> The acute phase also can be severe in people with weakened immune systems.<ref name=CDC/>

If symptoms develop during the acute phase, they usually resolve spontaneously within three to eight weeks in approximately 90% of individuals.<ref name=Bern/><ref name=Rassi1/> Although the symptoms resolve, even with treatment the infection persists and enters a chronic phase. Of individuals with chronic Chagas disease, 60–80% will never develop symptoms (called ''indeterminate'' chronic Chagas disease), while the remaining 20–40% will develop life-threatening heart and/or digestive disorders during their lifetime (called ''determinate'' chronic Chagas disease). In 10% of individuals, the disease progresses directly from the acute form to a symptomatic clinical form of chronic Chagas disease.<ref name=Bern/><ref name=Rassi1/>

The symptomatic (determinate) chronic stage affects the [[nervous system]], [[digestive system]] and [[Human heart|heart]]. About two-thirds of people with chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including [[dilated cardiomyopathy]], which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death. About one-third of patients go on to develop [[digestive system]] damage, resulting in dilation of the [[digestive tract]] ([[megacolon]] and [[megaesophagus]]), accompanied by severe [[weight loss]]. [[Swallowing]] difficulties (secondary [[achalasia]]) may be the first symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to [[malnutrition]].<ref name=emed/>

20% to 50% of individuals with intestinal involvement also exhibit cardiac involvement.<ref name=emed/> Up to 10% of chronically infected individuals develop [[neuritis]] that results in altered tendon reflexes and sensory impairment. Isolated cases exhibit central nervous system involvement, including [[dementia]], confusion, chronic [[encephalopathy]] and [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensory]] and [[Motor skill|motor]] deficits.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Córdova E, Maiolo E, Corti M, Orduña T |title=Neurological manifestations of Chagas' disease |journal=Neurol. Res. |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=238–44 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20406601 |doi=10.1179/016164110X12644252260637 |url=}}</ref>

The clinical manifestations of Chagas disease are due to cell death in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle, by sequentially inducing an [[inflammatory response]], cellular [[lesions]], and [[fibrosis]]. For example, intracellular [[amastigote]]s destroy the intramural neurons of the [[autonomic nervous system]] in the intestine and heart, leading to megaintestine and heart [[aneurysm]]s, respectively. If left untreated, Chagas disease can be fatal, in most cases due to heart muscle damage.<ref name=emed/>

==Transmission==
[[File:Rhodnius prolixus70-300.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]'' is the principal vector in [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], and some parts of [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]].]]

In Chagas-endemic areas, the main mode of transmission is through an insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] called a [[Triatominae|triatomine]] bug.<ref name=CDC/> A triatomine becomes infected with ''T. cruzi'' by feeding on the blood of an infected person or animal. During the day, triatomines hide in crevices in the walls and roofs. The bugs emerge at night, when the inhabitants are sleeping. Because they tend to feed on people's faces, triatomine bugs are also known as "kissing bugs". After they bite and ingest blood, they defecate on the person. Triatomines pass ''T. cruzi'' parasites (called [[trypomastigote]]s) in feces left near the site of the bite wound.<ref name=CDC/>

Scratching the site of the bite causes the trypomastigotes to enter the host through the wound, or through intact [[mucous membranes]], such as the [[conjunctiva]]. Once inside the host, the trypomastigotes invade cells, where they differentiate into intracellular [[amastigote]]s. The amastigotes multiply by [[binary fission]] and differentiate into trypomastigotes, which are then released into the bloodstream. This cycle is repeated in each newly infected cell. Replication resumes only when the parasites enter another cell or are ingested by another vector.<ref name=CDC/> (See also: [[:Image:Trypanosoma cruzi LifeCycle.gif|Life cycle and transmission of ''T. cruzi'']])

Dense vegetation (such as that of tropical [[rainforest]]s) and urban habitats are not ideal for the establishment of the human transmission cycle. However, in regions where the [[sylvatic]] [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] and its fauna are thinned by economic exploitation and human habitation, such as in newly [[deforestation|deforested]] areas, [[piassava palm]] culture areas, and some parts of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] region, a human transmission cycle may develop as the insects search for new food sources.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Teixeira AR, Monteiro PS, Rebelo JM |title=Emerging Chagas disease: trophic network and cycle of transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi from palm trees in the Amazon |journal=Emerging Infect Dis |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=100–12 |year=2001 |pmid=11266300 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no1/teixeira.htm |doi=10.3201/eid0701.010115 |pmc=2631687}}</ref>

''T. cruzi'' can also be transmitted through [[blood transfusions]]. With the exception of blood derivatives (such as fractionated [[antibodies]]), all blood components are infective. The parasite remains viable at 4°C for at least 18 days or up to 250 days when kept at room temperature. It is unclear whether ''T. cruzi'' can be transmitted through frozen-thawed blood components.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wendel S |title=Transfusion transmitted Chagas disease: Is it really under control? |journal=Acta Trop |volume= 115|issue= 1–2|pages= 28–34|year=2010 |month=January |pmid=20044970 |doi=10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.12.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001-706X(09)00386-6 |accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref>

Other modes of transmission include [[organ transplant]]ation, through [[breast milk]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Santos Ferreira C, Amato Neto V, Gakiya E, Bezerra RC, Alarcón RS |title=Microwave treatment of human milk to prevent transmission of Chagas disease |journal=[[Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de São Paulo]] |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=41–2 |year=2003 |pmid=12751321 |doi=10.1590/S0036-46652003000100008 }}</ref> and by accidental laboratory exposure. Chagas disease can also be spread congenitally (from a pregnant woman to her baby) through the [[placenta]], and accounts for approximately 13% of stillborn deaths in parts of Brazil.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hudson L, Turner MJ |title=Immunological consequences of infection and vaccination in South American trypanosomiasis [and discussion] |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |volume=307 |issue=1131 |pages=51–61 |year=1984 |month=November |pmid=6151688 |jstor=2990154 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1984.0108|bibcode = 1984RSPTB.307...51H }} Retrieved 22 February 2007 through [[JSTOR]].</ref>

Oral transmission is an unusual route of infection, but has been described. In 1991, farm workers in the state of [[Paraíba]], Brazil, were infected by eating contaminated food; transmission has also occurred via contaminated [[açaí palm]] fruit juice and [[sugarcane juice|garapa]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Benchimol-Barbosa PR |title=The oral transmission of Chagas' disease: an acute form of infection responsible for regional outbreaks. |journal=Int J Cardiol |volume=112 |issue=1 |pages=132–3 |year=2006 |pmid=16600406 |doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2005.11.087 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Benchimol-Barbosa PR |title=Trends on acute Chagas' disease transmitted by oral route in Brazil: steady increase in new cases and a concealed residual fluctuation. |journal=Int J Cardiol |volume=145 |issue=3 |pages=494–6 |year=2010 |pmid=19762096 |doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2009.08.030 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |year=2005 |month=April |title=Chagas' disease (American trypanosomiasis) in southern Brazil |journal=CDR Weekly |volume=15 |issue=13 |url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/CDR/archives/2005/cdr1305.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=United Kingdom [[Health Protection Agency]] |accessdate=26 November 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Shikanai-Yasuda MA, Marcondes CB, Guedes LA |title=Possible oral transmission of acute Chagas' disease in Brazil |journal=Rev Inst Med Trop São Paulo |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=351–7 |year=1991 |pmid=1844961 |doi=10.1590/S0036-46651991000500003 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=da Silva Valente SA, de Costa Valente V, Neto HF |title=Considerations on the epidemiology and transmission of Chagas disease in the Brazilian Amazon |journal=Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz |volume=94 Suppl 1 |pages=395–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10677763 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0074-0276(99)09400077&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en}}</ref> A 2007 outbreak in 103 Venezuelan school children was attributed to contaminated [[guava]] juice.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Alarcón de Noya B, Díaz-Bello Z, Colmenares C, ''et al.''|title=Large urban outbreak of orally acquired acute Chagas disease at a school in Caracas, Venezuela|journal=J Infect Dis|year=2010|volume=201|issue=9|pages=1308–15|pmid=20307205|doi=10.1086/651608}}</ref>

Chagas disease is a growing problem in Europe, because the majority of cases with chronic infection are asymptomatic and because of migration from Latin America.<ref name="Roca2011"/>

==Diagnosis==
The presence of ''T. cruzi'' is diagnostic of Chagas disease. It can be detected by [[microscope|microscopic]] examination of fresh anti[[coagulate]]d blood, or its [[buffy coat]], for motile parasites; or by preparation of thin and thick blood smears stained with [[Giemsa stain|Giemsa]], for direct visualization of [[parasitism|parasites]]. Microscopically, ''T. cruzi'' can be confused with ''[[Trypanosoma rangeli]]'', which is not known to be [[pathogen]]ic in humans. Isolation of ''T. cruzi'' can occur by inoculation into [[mouse|mice]], by culture in specialized media (for example, NNN, LIT); and by [[xenodiagnosis]],<ref>{{cite journal | author=Brumpt E| title=Le xénodiagnostic.

Various [[immunoassay]]s for ''T. cruzi'' are available and can be used to distinguish among [[Strain (biology)|strains]] ([[zymodeme]]s of ''T.cruzi'' with divergent pathogenicities). These tests include: detecting [[complement fixation]], indirect [[hemagglutination]], indirect [[fluorescence]] assays, [[radioimmunoassay]]s, and [[ELISA]]. Alternatively, diagnosis and strain identification can be made using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR).<ref name= emed/>

==Management==
There are two approaches to treating Chagas disease, [[antiparasitic]] treatment, to kill the parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection.
Management of Chagasic  disease uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic nervous system. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.

===Medication===
Antiparasitic treatment is most effective early in the course of infection, but is not limited to cases in the acute phase. Drugs of choice include [[azole]] or [[Nitro compound|nitro]] derivatives, such as [[benznidazole]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Garcia S, Ramos CO, Senra JF |title=Treatment with Benznidazole during the Chronic Phase of Experimental Chagas' Disease Decreases Cardiac Alterations |journal=[[Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|Antimicrob Agents Chemother]] |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=1521–8 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15793134 |pmc=1068607 |doi=10.1128/AAC.49.4.1521-1528.2005 |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15793134}}</ref> or [[nifurtimox]]. Both agents are limited in their capacity to effect parasitologic cure (a complete elimination of ''T. cruzi'' from the body), especially in chronically infected patients, and resistance to these drugs has been reported.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Buckner FS, Wilson AJ, White TC, Van Voorhis WC |title=Induction of Resistance to Azole Drugs in Trypanosoma cruzi |journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=3245–50 |year=1998 |month=December |pmid=9835521 |pmc=106029 |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9835521}}</ref>

Studies suggest antiparasitic treatment leads to parasitological cure in about 60–85% of adults and more than 90% of infants treated in the first year of acute phase Chagas disease. Children (aged six to 12 years) with chronic disease have a cure rate of about 60% with benznidazole. While the rate of cure declines the longer an adult has been infected with Chagas, treatment with benznidazole has been shown to slow the onset of heart disease in adults with chronic Chagas infections.<ref name=emed/><ref name=Rassi1/>

Treatment of chronic infection in women prior to or during pregnancy does not appear to reduce the probability the disease will be passed on to the infant. Likewise, it is unclear whether [[prophylactic]] treatment of chronic infection is beneficial in persons who will undergo immunosuppression (for example, organ transplant recipients) or in persons who are already immunosuppressed (for example, those with HIV infection).<ref name=emed/>

===Complications===
In the chronic stage, treatment involves managing the clinical manifestations of the disease. For example, [[pacemaker]]s and medications for irregular heartbeats, such as the anti-arrhythmia drug [[amiodarone]], may be life saving for some patients with chronic cardiac disease,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dubner S, Schapachnik E, Riera AR, Valero E |title=Chagas disease: state-of-the-art of diagnosis and management |journal=Cardiol J |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=493–504 |year=2008 |pmid=19039752}}</ref> while surgery may be required for megaintestine. The disease cannot be cured in this phase, however. Chronic heart disease caused by Chagas disease is now a common reason for [[heart transplantation]] surgery. Until recently, however, Chagas disease was considered a [[contraindication]] for the procedure, since the heart damage could recur as the parasite was expected to seize the opportunity provided by the [[immunosuppression]] that follows surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bocchi EA, Bellotti G, Mocelin AO |title=Heart transplantation for chronic Chagas' heart disease |journal=Ann Thorac Surg |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=1727–33 |year=1996 |month=June |pmid=8651775 |doi=10.1016/0003-4975(96)00141-5 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0003-4975(96)00141-5}}</ref>

It was noted that survival rates in Chagas patients could be significantly improved by using lower dosages of the immunosuppressant drug [[ciclosporin]]. Recently, direct [[stem cell therapy]] of the heart muscle using [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow cell transplantation]] has been shown to dramatically reduce risks of heart failure in Chagas patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vilas-Boas F, Feitosa GS, Soares MB |trans_title=Early results of bone marrow cell transplantation to the myocardium of patients with heart failure due to Chagas disease |language=Portuguese |journal=Arq Bras Cardiol |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=159–66 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16951834 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0066-782X2006001500014&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en |title=Resultados iniciais do transplante de células de medula óssea para o miocárdio de pacientes com insuficiência cardíaca de etiologia chagásica  |doi=10.1590/S0066-782X2006001500014}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
[[File:Distribution of Chagas' disease.svg|thumb|Chagas disease in Latin America ([[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] zones)]]
Chagas disease affects 8 to 10&nbsp;million people living in endemic Latin American countries, with an additional 300,000–400,000 living in nonendemic countries, including Spain and the United States. An estimated 41,200 new cases occur annually in endemic countries, and 14,400 infants are born with congenital Chagas disease annually.<ref name=emed/><ref name=Rassi1/> in 2010 it resulted in approximately 10,300 deaths up from 9,300 in 1990.<ref name=Loz2012>{{cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Dec 15|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095-128|pmid=23245604}}</ref>

The disease is present in 18 countries on the American continents, ranging from the southern United States to northern [[Argentina]].<ref name=CDC>{{cite web|publisher=Centers for Disease Control (CDC) |url= http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/TrypanosomiasisAmerican.htm |title=DPDx&nbsp;– Trypanosomiasis, American. Fact Sheet |accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> Chagas exists in two different ecological zones. In the [[Southern Cone]] region, the main vector lives in and around human homes. In Central America and Mexico, the main vector species lives both inside dwellings and in uninhabited areas. In both zones, Chagas occurs almost exclusively in rural areas, where triatomines breed and feed on the over 150 species from 24 families of domestic and wild mammals, as well as humans, that are the [[natural reservoir]]s of ''T. cruzi''.<ref name=NatRev>{{cite journal |author=Morel CM, Lazdins J |title=Chagas disease |journal=Nat Rev Microbiol |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=14–5 |year=2003|month=October |pmid=15040175 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro735}}</ref>

Although Triatominae bugs feed on them, birds appear to be immune to infection and therefore are not considered to be a ''T. cruzi'' reservoir. Even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters, they can re-emerge from plants or animals that are part of the ancient, [[sylvatic]] (referring to wild animals) infection cycle. This is especially likely in zones with mixed open savannah, with clumps of trees interspersed by human habitation.<ref>{{cite conference | author=Pinto-Dias JC | year = 1992 | title = Epidemiology of Chagas disease | conference = ISBT Brazil '92.

Chronic Chagas disease remains a major health problem in many Latin American countries, despite the effectiveness of hygienic and preventive measures, such as eliminating the transmitting insects. However, several landmarks have been achieved in the fight against it in Latin America, including a reduction by 72% of the incidence of human infection in children and young adults in the countries of the [[Southern Cone]] Initiative, and at least three countries ([[Uruguay]], in 1997, and [[Chile]], in 1999, and Brazil in 2006) have been certified free of vectorial and transfusional transmission.<ref name=emed/><ref name= TDR1>{{cite press release |url=http://www.who.int/tdrold/publications/tdrnews/news65/chagas.htm |title=The Southern Cone Initiative: an update |work=Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) |publisher=WHO|year=2004|accessdate=29 August 2008}} {{Dead link|date=May 2012|bot=BlevintronBot}}</ref><ref name="pmid18053273">{{cite journal |author=Massad E |title=The elimination of Chagas' disease from Brazil |journal=Epidemiol Infect |volume=136 |issue=9 |pages=1153–64 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18053273 |doi=10.1017/S0950268807009879 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0950268807009879 |pmc=2870925}}</ref> In Argentina, vectorial transmission has been interrupted in 13 of the 19 endemic provinces,<ref name= TDR1/> and major progress toward this goal has also been made in both Paraguay and Bolivia.

==History==
[[File:Carlos chagas 2.jpg|thumb|[[Carlos Chagas]], in his laboratory at the [[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation|Instituto Oswaldo Cruz]]]]

The disease was named after the [[Brazil]]ian physician and [[Infectology|infectologist]] [[Carlos Chagas]], who first described it in 1909,<ref name=Chagas_1909>{{cite journal |author=Chagas C | title=Neue Trypanosomen |journal=Vorläufige Mitteilung Arch Schiff Tropenhyg |year=1909 |volume=13 |pages = 120–2 }}</ref><ref name=Redhead_2006>{{cite journal |author=Redhead SA, Cushion MT, Frenkel JK, Stringer JR |title=''Pneumocystis'' and ''Trypanosoma cruzi'': nomenclature and typifications |journal=J Eukaryot Microbiol |year=2006 |pages=2–11 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pmid=16441572 |doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.2005.00072.x}}</ref><ref name=Chagas_1909b>{{cite journal |author=Chagas C |title=Nova tripanozomiase humana: Estudos sobre a morfolojia e o ciclo evolutivo do Schizotrypanum cruzi n. gen., n. sp., ajente etiolojico de nova entidade morbida do homem [New human trypanosomiasis.

He discovered that the intestines of Triatomidae (now [[Reduviidae]]: [[Triatominae]]) harbored a flagellate protozoan, a new species of the ''[[Trypanosoma]]'' genus, and was able to prove experimentally that it could be transmitted to [[marmoset]] monkeys that were bitten by the infected bug. Later studies showed [[squirrel monkey]]s were also vulnerable to infection.<ref name=Hulsebos_1989>{{cite journal |author=Hulsebos LH, Choromanski L, Kuhn RE |title=The effect of interleukin-2 on parasitemia and myocarditis in experimental Chagas' disease |journal=J Protozool |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=293–8 |year=1989 |pmid=2499678}}</ref>

Chagas named the pathogenic parasite as ''Trypanosoma cruzi''<ref name=Chagas_1909 /> and later that year as ''Schizotrypanum cruzi'',<ref name=Chagas_1909b /> both honoring [[Oswaldo Cruz]], the noted Brazilian physician and [[epidemiologist]] who successfully fought epidemics of [[yellow fever]], [[smallpox]], and [[bubonic plague]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and other cities in the beginning of the 20th century. Chagas was also the first to unknowingly discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus ''[[Pneumocystis pneumonia|Pneumocystis]]'', later infamously linked to PCP (''Pneumocystis'' [[pneumonia]] in AIDS victims).<ref name=Redhead_2006 /> Confusion between the two pathogens' life-cycles led him to briefly recognize his genus ''Schizotrypanum'', but following the description of ''Pneumocystis'' by others as an independent genus, Chagas returned to the use of the name ''Trypanosoma cruzi''.

In [[Argentina]], the disease is known as ''mal de Chagas-Mazza'', in honor of [[Salvador Mazza]], the [[Argentina|Argentine]] physician who in 1926 began investigating the disease and over the years became the principal researcher of this disease in the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drwebsa.com.ar/alcha/hist4.htm |publisher=Asociación Lucha Contra el Mal de Chagas |title=Enfermedad de Chagas&nbsp;– Mazza |language=Spanish |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref> Mazza produced the first scientific confirmation of the existence of ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'' in Argentina in 1927, eventually leading to support from local and European medical schools and Argentine government policy makers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fac.org.ar/fec/chagas/fatala/historia.htm |title=Historia de la enfermedad de Chagas |language=Spanish|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091204113113/http://www.fac.org.ar/fec/chagas/fatala/historia.htm |archivedate=4 December 2009 }}</ref>

It has been hypothesized that [[Charles Darwin]] might have suffered from Chagas disease as a result of a bite of the so-called great black bug of the [[Pampas]] (''vinchuca'') (see [[Charles Darwin's illness]]). The episode was reported by Darwin in his diaries of [[the Voyage of the Beagle]] as occurring in March 1835 to the east of the [[Andes]] near [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]. Darwin was young and generally in good health, though six months previously he had been ill for a month near [[Valparaiso]], but in 1837, almost a year after he returned to England, he began to suffer intermittently from a strange group of [[symptom]]s, becoming incapacitated for much of the rest of his life. Attempts to test Darwin's remains at [[Westminster Abbey]] by using modern [[PCR]] techniques were met with a refusal by the Abbey's [[curator]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adler D |title=Darwin's Illness |journal=Isr J Med Sci |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=218–21 |year=1989 |pmid=2496051}}</ref>
