'''Chordates''' are members of the [[phylum]] '''Chordata''', [[deuterostome]] [[animal]]s possessing a [[notochord]], a hollow [[dorsal nerve cord]], [[pharyngeal slit]]s, an [[endostyle]], and a post-anal [[tail]] for at least some period of their life cycles. Taxonomically, the phylum includes the subphyla [[vertebrate|Vertebrata]], including [[mammal]]s, [[fish]], [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s; [[Tunicate|Tunicata]], including [[salp]]s and [[sea squirt]]s; and [[Cephalochordata]], comprising the [[lancelet]]s.

The phylum [[Hemichordata]] including the [[acorn worm]]s has been presented as a fourth chordate subphylum, but it now is usually treated as a separate phylum. It, along with the [[echinoderm]] phylum, including [[starfish]], [[sea urchins]], and [[sea cucumber]]s and their kin, are the chordates' closest relatives. Primitive chordates are known from at least as early as the [[Cambrian explosion]].

There are more than 75,000 living species of chordates, about half of which are bony fish of the class [[osteichthyes]]. Both the world's largest and fastest animal, the [[blue whale]] and [[peregrine falcon]] respectively, are chordates, as are humans.<ref><span class="plainlinks">[http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=133700&referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d133700 AccessScience.com]</span>.

==Overview of affinities==
Tunicate larvae have both a notochord and a nerve cord which are lost in adulthood. Cephalochordates have a notochord and a nerve cord (but no [[brain]] or specialist sensory organs) and a very simple [[circulatory system]]. Craniates are the only subphylum whose members have [[skull]]s. In all craniates except for [[hagfish]], the dorsal hollow nerve cord is surrounded with [[cartilaginous]] or bony vertebrae and the notochord is generally reduced; hence, hagfish are not universally regarded as vertebrates, though recent DNA comparisons suggest that they are in fact vertebrates. The chordates and two sister [[phylum|phyla]], the [[Hemichordata]] and the [[Echinodermata]], make up the [[deuterostome]]s, one of the two [[superphylum|superphyla]] that encompass all fairly complex animals. An article by Nakano et al. demonstrates that the [[Xenoturbellida]] are not deuterostomes.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/ncomms2556}}</ref>

Attempts to work out the evolutionary relationships of the chordates have produced several hypotheses. The current consensus is that chordates are [[monophyletic]], meaning that the Chordata include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor ''which is itself a chordate'', and that craniates' nearest relatives are cephalochordates. All of the earliest chordate [[fossil]]s have been found in the Early [[Cambrian]] [[Chengjiang fauna]], and include two species that are regarded as [[fish]], which implies they are vertebrates. Because the fossil record of chordates is poor, only [[molecular phylogenetics]] offers a reasonable prospect of dating their emergence. However, the use of molecular phylogenetics for dating evolutionary transitions is controversial.

It has also proved difficult to produce a detailed classification within the living chordates. Attempts to produce evolutionary "[[phylogenetic tree|family trees]]" give results that differ from traditional [[class (biology)|classes]] because several of those classes are not monophyletic. As a result, vertebrate classification is in a state of flux.

For a recent concise review of chordate relationships, see Holland, N. D. 2005, Chordates. Curr. Biol. 15: R911-R914.

===Origin of name===
Although the name Chordata is often attributed to [[William Bateson]] (1885), it was already in prevalent use by 1880.  [[Ernst Haeckel]] described a taxon comprising tunicates, cephalochordates, and vertebrates in 1866.  Though he used the German vernacular form, it is allowed under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN code]] because of its subsequent latinization.<ref name="Nielsen2012">{{cite journal

[[Craniate]]s, one of the three subdivisions of chordates, have distinct [[skull]]s - including [[hagfish]], which have no [[vertebrae]]. [[Michael J. Benton]] comments, "craniates are characterized by their heads, just as chordates, or possibly all [[deuterostome]]s, are by their tails".

==Closest nonchordate relatives==

===Hemichordates===
{{main|Hemichordate}}
[[Image:Eichelwurm.jpg|thumb|Hemichordate: [[Acorn worm]]]]

[[Hemichordate]]s ("half (½) chordates") have some features similar to those of chordates: branchial openings that open into the [[pharynx]] and look rather like gill slits; stomochords, similar in composition to [[notochord]]s, but running in a circle round the "collar", which is ahead of the mouth; and a [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] nerve cord — but also a smaller [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] nerve cord.

There are two living groups of hemichordates. The solitary [[enteropneust]]s, commonly known as "acorn worms", have long [[proboscis]]es and worm-like bodies with up to 200 branchial slits, are up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} long, and burrow though seafloor [[sediment]]s. [[Pterobranch]]s are [[colony (biology)|colonial]] animals, often less than {{convert|1|mm|in}} long individually, whose dwellings are interconnected. Each [[filter feeding|filter feeds]] by means of a pair of branched tentacles, and has a short, shield-shaped proboscis. The extinct [[graptolite]]s, colonial animals whose fossils look like tiny [[hacksaw]] blades, lived in tubes similar to those of pterobranchs.<ref>{{cite web

===Echinoderms===
{{main|Echinoderm}}
[[Image:Sandstar 300.jpg|thumb|200px|Echinoderm: [[starfish]]]]
[[Echinoderm]]s differ from chordates and their other relatives in three conspicuous ways: they possess [[bilateral symmetry]] as larvae and in adulthood they have [[radial symmetry]], meaning their body pattern is shaped like a wheel; they have [[tube feet]]; and their bodies are supported by [[skeleton]]s made of [[calcite]], a material not used by chordates. Their hard, calcified shells keep their bodies well protected from the environment, and these skeletons enclose their bodies, but are also covered by thin skins. The feet are powered by another unique feature of echinoderms, a [[water vascular system]] of canals that also functions as a "lung" and are surrounded by muscles that act as pumps. [[Crinoid]]s look rather like flowers, and use their feather-like arms to filter food particles out of the water; most live anchored to rocks, but a few can move very slowly. Other echinoderms are mobile and take a variety of body shapes, for example [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s and [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumbers]].<ref name="CowenHistLifeEd3P412">{{cite book

</div>A consensus family tree of the chordates<ref name="Ruppert2005"/><ref name="Perseke2007" /></div>
The evolutionary relationships between the chordate groups and between chordates as a whole and their closest deuterostome relatives have been debated since 1890. Studies based on anatomical, [[embryology|embryological]], and paleontological data have produced different "family trees". Some closely linked chordates and hemichordates, but that idea is now rejected.<ref name="Ruppert2005" /> Combining such analyses with data from a small set of [[ribosome]] [[RNA]] genes eliminated some older ideas, but open the possibility that tunicates (urochordates) are "basal deuterostomes", surviving members of the group from which echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates evolved.<ref name="WinchellSullivanCameronSwallaMallatt2002">{{cite journal

Since chordates have left a poor fossil record, attempts have been made to calculate the key dates in their evolution by [[molecular phylogenetics]] techniques - by analyzing biochemical differences, mainly in RNA. One such study suggested  deuterostomes arose before {{ma|900}} and the earliest chordates around {{ma|896}}.<ref name="BlairHedges2005"/> However, molecular estimates of dates often disagree with each other and with the fossil record,<ref name="BlairHedges2005" /> and their assumption that the [[molecular clock]] runs at a known constant rate has been challenged.<ref name="Ayala1999MolClockMirages">{{cite journal |author= Ayala, F.J.|year=1999 |title=Molecular clock mirages |journal=[[BioEssays]] |volume=21|issue=1 |pages=71–75|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/60000186/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(199901)21:1<71::AID-BIES9>3.0.CO;2-B |pmid=10070256}}</ref><ref name="SchwartzMaresca20006DoMolClocksRun">{{cite journal |author=Schwartz, J.

<!-- **************
The origin of chordates is currently unknown. The first clearly identifiable chordates are reduced fish- or [[lancelet]]-like specimens from the [[Cambrian]]. Most speculations about their origin fit into one or more of these categories:

* A sediment-dwelling, worm-like animal that evolved a flatter body and/or fins for swimming
* A sessile, tubular, filter-feeder that evolved into a free-swimming animal via usage of fins ([[Tunicates]], considered a chordate, are sessile filter feeders that have a tadpole-like larvae.)
* A drifting or swimming larva of some other kind of animal that eventually retained its swimming features into adulthood

The notochord's stiffness in many chordates may have evolved to facilitate the effectiveness of alternating muscle contractions for swimming (in S-shaped movements). To bend the body, a muscle needs a rigid structure to pull against, and a notochord (at least before spines) is the main structure to provide this. Lack of a stiff body part would merely result in the shortening of the animal during muscle contractions instead of the bending motions needed for swimming.

Traditionally, Cephalochordata and Craniata were grouped into the proposed clade "Euchordata", which would have been the sister group to Tunicata/Urochordata. More recently, Cephalochordata has been thought of as a sister group to the "Olfactores", which includes the craniates and tunicates. The matter is not yet settled.
