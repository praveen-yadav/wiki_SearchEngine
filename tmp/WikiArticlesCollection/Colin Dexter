'''Norman Colin Dexter''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], (born 29 September 1930) is an English crime writer known for his [[Inspector Morse]] novels, which were written between 1975 and 1999 and adapted as a television series from 1987 to 2000.

==Early life and career==
Dexter was born in [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], and was educated at [[Stamford School]]. After completing his [[National Service]] with the [[Royal Corps of Signals]], he read classics at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], graduating in 1953 and receiving an honorary master's degree in 1958.

In 1954, he started his teaching career in the [[East Midlands]], becoming assistant classics master at [[Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College|Wyggeston School]], Leicester. A post at [[Loughborough Grammar School]] followed before he took up the position of senior classics teacher at Corby Grammar School, [[Northamptonshire]], in 1959.

In 1956 he married Dorothy Cooper, and they had a son and a daughter.

In 1966, he was forced by the onset of deafness to retire from teaching and took up the post of senior assistant secretary at the University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations (UODLE) in [[Oxford]], a job he held until his retirement in 1988.

Dexter featured prominently in the BBC programme "How to Solve a Cryptic Crossword" as part of the Time Shift series broadcast in November 2008, in which he recounted some of the crossword clues solved by Morse.

==Writing career==
The first books he wrote were general studies text books.<ref>http://sandrafraser.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/character-interview-colin-dexter/</ref>

He started writing mysteries in 1973 during a family holiday. "We were in a little guest house halfway between [[Caernarfon]] and [[Pwllheli]]. It was a Saturday and it was raining&mdash;it's not unknown for it to rain in [[North Wales]]. The children were moaning... I was sitting at the kitchen table with nothing else to do, and I wrote the first few paragraphs of a potential detective novel." ''Last Bus to Woodstock'' was published in 1975 and introduced the world to the character of [[Inspector Morse]], the irascible detective whose penchants for [[cryptic crossword]]s, English literature, [[cask ale]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] reflect Dexter's own enthusiasms. Dexter's plots are notable for his use of false leads and other [[red herring]]s.<ref>[http://www.oxfordwine.co.uk/features/summer_07/dexter.html The Oxford Wine Company - Stars in their bars: Colin Dexter]</ref>

The success of the 33 episodes of the TV series ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'', produced between 1987 and 2001, brought further acclaim for Dexter. In the manner of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], he also makes a [[cameo appearance]] in almost all episodes.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223294/bio. Retrieved 5 January 2006.</ref>  More recently, his character from the Morse series, the stalwart Sergeant (now Inspector) Lewis features in 27 episodes of the new ITV series ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]''. As with ''Morse'', Dexter makes a cameo appearance in several episodes, giving him a violet flower.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223294/</ref> 

Dexter is currently a consultant on the TV series ''[[Endeavour]]'', starring Shaun Evans and Roger Allam. This series is a prequel to the highly successful TV series ''[[Inspector Morse]]'', starring John Thaw and Kevin Whately from 1987 to 2001.  Following the pattern he set in ''[[Inspector Morse]]'', Dexter occasionally makes cameo appearances in ''[[Endeavour]]''. 

Dexter suggested the English poet [[Alfred Edward Housman|A.E. Housman]] as his "great life" on the [[BBC Radio 4]] [[Great Lives|programme of that name]] in May 2008. Dexter and Housman were both classicists who found a popular audience for another genre of writing.

==Awards and honours==
Dexter has been the recipient of several [[Crime Writers' Association]] awards: two [[Silver Dagger (award)|Silver Dagger]]s for ''[[Service of All the Dead]]'' in 1979 and ''[[The Dead of Jericho]]'' in 1981; two [[Gold Dagger]]s for ''[[The Wench is Dead]]'' in 1989 and ''[[The Way Through the Woods]]'' in 1992; and a [[Cartier Diamond Dagger]] for lifetime achievement in 1997. In 1996 Dexter received a [[Macavity Awards|Macavity Award]] for his short story ''Evans Tries an O-Level''.  In 1980, he was elected a member of the by-invitation-only Detection Club.

In 2000 Dexter was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to literature.

In September 2011, the [[University of Lincoln]] awarded Dexter an honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] degree, a higher doctorate which is frequently awarded in recognition of outstanding scholarship or other merits.
