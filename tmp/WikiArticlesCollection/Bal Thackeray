'''Bal Keshav Thackeray''' ({{IPA-mr|ʈʰakəɾe}}; 23 January 1926&nbsp;– 17 November 2012) was an Indian politician who founded the [[Shiv Sena]], a right-wing [[Marathi people|Marathi]] [[ethnocentric]] party active mainly in the [[West India|western India's]] [[Maharashtra]]. His followers called him the ''Hindu Hriday Samraat'' ("Emperor of Hindu Hearts").<ref name="Puniyani2006">{{cite book | author=Ram Puniyani | title=Contours of Hindu Rashtra: Hindutva, Sangh Parivar, and Contemporary Politics | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KblMm_JZzEEC&pg=PA123 | accessdate=14 November 2012 | date=1 January 2006 | publisher=Gyan Publishing House | isbn=978-81-7835-473-6 | page=123 }}</ref>

Thackeray began his professional career as a [[cartoonist]] with the English language daily ''[[The Free Press Journal]]'' in [[Mumbai]], but left it in 1960 to form his own political weekly ''[[Marmik (periodical)|Marmik]]''.{{fact|date=August 2013}} His political philosophy was largely shaped by his father [[Keshav Sitaram Thackeray]], a leading figure in the [[Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti|''Samyukta Maharashtra'' movement]] (United Maharashtra movement), which advocated the creation of a separate linguistic state of Maharashtra. Through ''Marmik'', he campaigned against the growing influence of non-Marathis in Mumbai.<ref name="born">{{cite web|title=Roar of the Tiger|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/slideshow_roar-of-the-tiger_1497754#top|work=[[Daily News and Analysis{{!}}Daily News and Analysis (DNA)]]|accessdate=23 January 2011}}</ref> In 1966, Thackeray formed the [[Shiv Sena]] party to advocate the place of [[Maharashtrians]] in Mumbai's political and professional landscape.

His father was said to have supported the use of strategic violence and the reason his father left the movement was his stance against communists. This is said to have inspired Thackeray and his foundations for his party.

Thackeray was married to Meena Thackeray and had three sons, Bindumadhav Thackeray, Jaidev Thackeray and [[Uddhav Thackeray]].<ref>{{cite news|title=A political saga of a cartoonist|url=http://www.andhrawishesh.com/home/hot-buzz/34781-a-political-saga-of-a-cartoonist.html|accessdate=17 November 2012|newspaper=Andhra Wishesh|date=15 November 2012}}</ref> Meena and Bindumadhav died in 1996.<ref>{{cite news|last=IANS|title=Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray passes away|url=http://www.ianslive.in/index.php?param=news/Thackerays_health_improving_Shiv_Sena-390666/TopStory/30|accessdate=17 November 2012|newspaper=IANS|date=17 November 2012}}</ref>

==Early career==
Thackeray started his career as a cartoonist in the ''Free Press Journal'' in Mumbai. His cartoons were also published in the Sunday edition of ''[[The Times of India]]''. In 1960, he launched a cartoon weekly ''Marmik'' with his brother. He used it to campaign against the growing numbers and influence of non-Marathi people in Mumbai, targeting Gujaratis and South Indians.<ref name="dnaindia.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/slideshow_roar-of-the-tiger_1497754#top |title=Roar of the Tiger&nbsp;— DNA |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date= |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> After Thackeray's differences with the ''Free Press Journal'', he and four or five people, including [[George Fernandes]], left the paper and started their own daily ''News Day''. The paper survived for one or two months.<ref>Jerry Pinto, Naresh Fernandes. Bombay, Meri Jaan: Writings on Mumbai, p. 238</ref>

==Politics==
He formed the [[Shiv Sena]] on 19 June 1966 with the intent of fighting for the rights of the natives of the [[States of India|state]] of Maharashtra. The Party grew in power when in the early 1970s he was joined by senior leaders such as Marathi Literature Historian [[Babasaheb Purandare]], Chief Attorney for Trade Union of Maharashtra Madhav Mehere as a party Attorney and experienced Trade Union Chartered Accountant Madhav Deshpande to back him up for various aspects of the party operations.<ref>[http://in.rediff.com/election/2004/apr/23espec3.htm Know your party: Shiv Sena - Lok Sabha Election news 2009 - Rediff.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The early objective of the Shiv Sena was to ensure job security for Maharashtrians competing against immigrants from southern India, Gujaratis and Marwaris. In 1989, the Sena's newspaper ''[[Saamna]]'' was launched.<ref>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-11-19/pune/35204806_1_bal-thackeray-saamna-sena-leader How Sena got the title 'Saamna' for mouthpiece], www.timesofindia.com, 19 November 2012. Retrieved 5 December 2012</ref>

Politically, the Shiv Sena was [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] and wrested control of trade unions in Mumbai from the [[Communist Party of India]]. It later allied itself with the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP). The BJP-Shiv Sena alliance won the 1995 [[Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha|Maharashtra State Assembly]] elections and came to power. During the tenure of the government from 1995 to 1999, Thackeray declared himself to the '[[remote control]]' chief minister.<ref name="Godbole1996">{{cite book|author=Madhav Godbole|title=Unfinished Innings: Recollections and Reflections of a Civil Servant|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ItQF4g08KbwC&pg=PA414|accessdate=4 December 2012|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-250-0883-5|page=414}}</ref>

On 28 July 1999 Thackeray was banned from voting and contesting in any election for six years from 11 December 1999 till 10 December 2005 on the recommendations of the Election Commission for indulging in corrupt practice by seeking votes in the name of religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/NM1/Thackeray-votes-after-expiry-of-ban/Article1-16731.aspx |title=Thackeray votes after expiry of ban |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=2004-04-26 |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref><ref name="Banned from voting">{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/revents/01/19990199.htm#jul|title=Banned from voting|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=28 July 1999}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> After the six-year voting ban on Thackeray was lifted in 2005, he voted for the first time in the 2006 BMC elections.<ref name="Voting ban lifted">{{cite web |url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2009/oct/141009-Bal-Thackeray-Uddhav-Aditya-polling-booth-Election.htm|title=Thackeray ke Bal par...|publisher=[[Mid Day]]|accessdate=14 October 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091018072453/http://www.mid-day.com/news/2009/oct/141009-Bal-Thackeray-Uddhav-Aditya-polling-booth-Election.htm| archivedate= 18 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Factionalism===
In 2006, Thackeray's nephew [[Raj Thackeray]] separated from the Shiv Sena to form the [[Maharashtra Navnirman Sena]] (MNS). This was after Thackeray's son, [[Uddhav Thackeray|Uddhav]], was given the task of leading the party when Thackeray announced his retirement from active politics. Raj continues to maintain that Thackeray was his ideologue.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mishra|first=Ambarish|title=राज महायात्रेत अलिप्त होते, कारण...|url=http://maharashtratimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/17276242.cms|language=Marathi|accessdate=20 November 2012|newspaper=Maharashtra Times|date=19 November 2012}}</ref>

==Issues and actions==
On 14 February 2006, Thackeray condemned and apologised for the violent attacks by Shiv Sainiks upon a private Valentine's Day celebration in Mumbai. "It is said that women were beaten up in the Nallasopara incident. If that really happened, then it is a symbol of cowardice. I have always instructed Shiv Sainiks that in any situation women should not be humiliated and harassed."<ref>{{cite news

Thackeray was criticised for his praise of [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref>P. 90 India and the International System By Gupta, Mannaraswamighala Sreeranga Rajan, Shivaji Ganguly</ref><ref>P. 201 Jawaharlal Nehru on Communalism By Nand Lal Gupta</ref> He was quoted by ''[[Asiaweek]]'' as saying: "I am a great admirer of Hitler, and I am not ashamed to say so!

===Accusations of xenophobia===

Thackeray and the Shiv Sena were blamed for inciting violence against Muslims during the 1992–1993 [[Mumbai riots]] in an inquiry ordered by the [[government of India]] - the Srikrishna Commission Report.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1517/15170200.htm |title=Navigation News &#124; Frontline |publisher=Frontlineonnet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> Following the riots, Thackeray took stances viewed as anti-Muslim.

He told ''[[India Today]]'' "[Muslims] are spreading like a cancer and should be operated on like a cancer. The...country should be saved from the Muslims and the police should support them [Hindu Maha Sangh] in their struggle just like the police in Punjab were sympathetic to the Khalistanis."<ref>Bal Thackeray in ''[[India Today]]'', Shiv Sena leader of Bombay, June 15, 1984.</ref> However, in an interview in 1998, he said that his stance had changed on many issues that the Shiv Sena had with Muslims, particularly regarding the Babri Mosque or [[Ram Janmabhoomi]] issue:<ref name="1998 interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jan/21nandy.htm |title=The Rediff Interview/ Bal Thackeray |publisher=Rediff.com |date=21 January 1998 |accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref> "We must look after the Muslims and treat them as part of us."<ref name="1998 interview"/> He also expressed admiration for Muslims in Mumbai in the wake of the [[11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings]] perpetrated by [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalists]]. In response to threats made by [[Abu Azmi]], a leader of the [[Samajwadi Party]], that accusations of terrorism directed at Indian Muslims would bring about communal strife, Thackeray said that the unity of Mumbaikars (residents of Mumbai) in the wake of the attacks was "a slap to fanatics of Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi" and that Thackeray "salute[s] those Muslims who participated in the two minutes' silence on July 18 to mourn the blast victims."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-07-20/india/27814176_1_blast-victims-serial-blasts-sena-chief-bal-thackeray | work=The Times Of India | title=Mumbai's unity a slap to fanatics: Thackeray | date=20 July 2006}}</ref> Again in 2008 he wrote: "Islamic terrorism is growing and Hindu terrorism is the only way to counter it.

In 2008, following agitation against Biharis and other north Indians travelling to Maharashtra to take civil service examinations for the [[Indian Railways]] due to an overlimit of the quota in their home provinces, Thackeray also said of Bihari MPs that they were "spitting in the same plate from which they ate" when they criticised Mumbaikars and Maharashtrians. He wrote: "They are trying to add fuel to the fire that has been extinguished, by saying that Mumbaikars have rotten brains." He also criticised [[Chhath Puja]] an holiday celebrated by Biharis and those from eastern Uttar Pradesh which occurs six days after the [[Hindu New Year]]. He said that it was not a real holiday.<ref name="IE_rattled" /> This was reportedly a response to MPs from Bihar who had disrupted the proceedings of the [[Lok Sabha]] in protest to the attacks on North Indians.<ref name="IE_rattled">{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/story/281062.html|title= Rattled by Raj, Thackeray abuses Biharis news|publisher=''[[The Indian Express]]''|accessdate=2 February 2008}}</ref> Bihar Chief Minister [[Nitish Kumar]], upset with the remarks, called on the prime minister and the central government to intervene in the matter. A ''Saamna'' editorial prompted at least 16 MPs from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, belonging to the [[Rashtriya Janata Dal]], [[Janata Dal (United)]], Samajwadi Party and the [[Indian National Congress]], to give notice for [[breach of privilege]] proceedings against Thackeray.<ref name="IE_rattled" /> After the matter was raised in the Lok Sabha, [[Speaker of Lok Sabha|Speaker]] [[Somnath Chatterjee]] said: "If anybody has made any comment on our members' functioning in the conduct of business in the House, not only do we treat that with the contempt that it deserves, but also any action that may be necessary will be taken according to procedure and well established norms. Nobody will be spared."<ref name="IE_rattled" />

On 27 March 2008, in protest to Thackeray's editorial, leaders of Shiv Sena in [[Delhi]] resigned, citing its "outrageous conduct" towards non-Marathis in Maharashtra and announced that they would form a separate party.<ref name="TOI_quit" /> Addressing a press conference, Shiv Sena's North India chief Jai Bhagwan Goyal said the decision to leave the party was taken because of the "partial attitude" of the party high command towards Maharashtrians. Goyal further said "Shiv Sena is no different from [[Khalistan]] and Jammu and Kashmir militant groups which are trying to create a rift between people along regional lines. The main aim of these forces is to split our country.
