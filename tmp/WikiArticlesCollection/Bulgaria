'''Bulgaria''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Bulgaria.ogg|b|ʌ|l|ˈ|ɡ|ɛər|i|ə}} ({{lang-bg|България}}, {{IPA-bg|bɤ̞ɫˈɡarijɐ|IPA}}), officially the '''Republic of Bulgaria''' ({{lang-bg|Република България|republika}}, {{IPA-bg|rɛˈpublika bɤ̞ɫˈɡarijɐ|IPA}}), is a country located in [[Southeast Europe|Southeastern Europe]]. It is bordered by [[Romania]] to the north, [[Serbia]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] to the west, [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to the south, and the [[Black Sea]] to the east. With a territory of {{convert|110994|km2|sp=uk}}, Bulgaria is Europe's [[List of European countries by area|14th-largest country]].

Organised [[Prehistoric]] cultures began developing on Bulgarian lands during the [[Neolithic period]]. Its ancient history saw the presence of the [[Thracians]], and later the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. The emergence of a unified Bulgarian state dates back to the establishment of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] in 681 CE, which dominated most of the [[Balkans]] and functioned as a cultural hub for [[Slavic peoples]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. With the downfall of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] in 1396, its territories came under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule for nearly five centuries. The [[Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877–1878 led to the formation of the Third Bulgarian State. The following years saw several conflicts with its neighbours, which prompted Bulgaria to align with Germany in both World Wars. In 1946 it became a single-party [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Socialist state]] as part of the Soviet-led [[Eastern Bloc]]. In [[Revolutions of 1989|1989]] the ruling [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Party]] allowed [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] elections, which subsequently led to Bulgaria's transition into a [[democracy]] and a market-based economy.

Bulgaria's population of 7.36 million people is predominantly urbanised and mainly concentrated in the administrative centres of its [[Provinces of Bulgaria|28 provinces]]. Most commercial and cultural activities are centered on the capital and largest city, [[Sofia]]. The strongest sectors of the economy are heavy industry, power engineering, and agriculture, all of which rely on local natural resources.

The country's current political structure dates to the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1991. Bulgaria is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] parliamentary republic with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. It is a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], and the [[Council of Europe]]; a founding state of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE); and has taken a seat at the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] three times.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Bulgaria}}
[[File:National Assembly of Bulgaria.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The National Assembly building in Sofia|The National Assembly building in [[Sofia]].]]

Bulgaria is a [[parliamentary democracy]] in which the most powerful executive position is that of prime minister.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|p=16}} The political system has three branches—legislative, executive and judicial, with [[universal suffrage]] for [[citizen]]s at least 18 years old. Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|p=17}} Normally, the prime minister-elect is the leader of the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|p=16}}

Political parties gather in the [[Narodno Sabranie|National Assembly]], which consists of 240 deputies elected to four-year terms by direct popular vote. The National Assembly has the power to enact laws, approve the budget, schedule presidential elections, select and dismiss the [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria|Prime Minister]] and other ministers, declare war, deploy troops abroad, and ratify international treaties and agreements. The [[President of Bulgaria|president]] serves as the [[head of state]] and [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces, and has the authority to return a bill for further debate, although the parliament can override the [[presidential veto]] by a simple majority vote of all members of parliament.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|p=16}} [[Plamen Oresharski]] of the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] became prime minister on 29 May 2013,<ref>{{cite news |title=Boyko Borisov, Prime Minister of Bulgaria |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/infoCountryPage/setimes/resource_centre/bios/borisov_boyko?country=Bulgaria |newspaper=Southeast European Times |year=2009 |accessdate=20 December 2011}}</ref> while GERB-backed [[Rosen Plevneliev]] was elected president in 2011, after receiving 52.5 per cent of the votes on the second round against 47.5 per cent for his Socialist Party opponent [[Ivaylo Kalfin]].<ref>{{cite news |title=President-elect Plevneliev's final margin of victory closer than predicted |author=Gabriel Hershman |url=http://thesofiaecho.com/2011/10/31/1192360_president-elect-plevnelievs-final-margin-of-victory-closer-than-predicted |newspaper=The Sofia Echo |date=31 October 2011 |accessdate=20 December 2011}}</ref> Until February 2013 GERB had 117 seats in the National Assembly and no permanent political allies, ruling as a [[minority government]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-06/bulgarian-cabinet-faces-no-confidence-vote-over-atomic-plant|title=Bulgarian Cabinet Faces No-Confidence Vote Over Atomic Plant|newspaper=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=6 April 2012|accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref>

All areas take their names from their respective capital cities. The provinces subdivide into 264 [[Municipalities of Bulgaria|municipalities]].

Municipalities are run by mayors, who are elected to four-year terms, and by directly elected municipal councils. Bulgaria is a highly [[centralization|centralised]] state, where the national Council of Ministers directly appoints regional governors and all provinces and municipalities are heavily dependent on it for funding.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|p=17}}
