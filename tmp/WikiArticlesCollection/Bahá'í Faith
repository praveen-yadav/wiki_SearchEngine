The '''Bahá'í Faith''' ({{lang-ar|بهائية}} ''Baha'iyyah'') {{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|h|aɪ}}<ref>In English, "Bahá'í" {{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|h|aɪ}} is pronounced with two syllables according to the [http://news.bahai.org/media-information/style-guide/ pronunciation guide] on the Bahá'í World News Service Website (Bahá'í: ''Ba-HIGH'').  In Persian, {{lang-fa |بهائی}} {{IPA-fa|bæhɒːʔiː|}} is pronounced with three syllables.  The exact realization of the English pronunciation varies.  The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] has {{IPAc-en|b|æ|ˈ|h|ɑː|iː}} {{respell|ba|HAH|ee}}, [[Merriam-Webster]] has {{IPAc-en |b|ɑː|ˈ|h|ɑː|iː}} {{respell|bah|HAH|ee}}, and the [[Random House Dictionary]] has {{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|h|ɑː|iː}} {{respell |bə|HAH|ee}}, all with three syllables.

The Bahá'í Faith was founded by [[Bahá'u'lláh]] in 19th-century [[Persia]].  Bahá'u'lláh was exiled for his teachings, from Persia to the [[Ottoman Empire]], and died while officially being a prisoner.  After Bahá'u'lláh's death, under the leadership of his son, [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the religion spread from its Persian and Ottoman roots, and gained a footing in Europe and America, and was consolidated in Iran, where it suffers intense [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|persecution]].<ref name="affolter">{{cite journal |last=Affolter |first=Friedrich W. |year=2005 |month=January |title=The Specter of Ideological Genocide: The Bahá'ís of Iran |journal=War Crimes, Genocide, & Crimes against Humanity |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=75–114 |url=http://www.altoona.psu.edu/journals/war-crimes/articles/V1/v1n1a3.pdf |accessdate=May 31, 2006 |archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120722083412/http://www.altoona.psu.edu/journals/war-crimes/articles/V1/v1n1a3.pdf |archivedate= July 22, 2012 |format=PDF}}</ref> After the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, the leadership of the Bahá'í community entered a new phase, evolving from a single individual to an administrative order with both elected bodies and appointed individuals.<ref name="PSmith56">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=56}}</ref>  There are probably more than 5 million Bahá'ís around the world in more than 200 countries and territories.<ref name="eor">{{Harvnb|Hutter|2005|pp=737–40}}</ref><ref name="statistics">[[Bahá'í statistics#Worldwide figures|Bahá'í statistics]] for a breakdown of different estimates.</ref>

In the Bahá'í Faith, religious history is seen to have unfolded through a series of divine messengers, each of whom established a religion that was suited to the needs of the time and the capacity of the people. These messengers have included [[Abrahamic]] figures as well as [[Dharmic]] ones - [[Krishna]], [[Moses]], [[Buddha]], [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], and others. For Bahá'ís, the most recent messengers are the [[Báb]] and [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. In Bahá'í belief, each consecutive messenger prophesied of messengers to follow, and Bahá'u'lláh's life and teachings fulfilled the [[eschatology|end-time]] promises of previous scriptures. Humanity is understood to be in a process of collective evolution, and the need of the present time is for the gradual establishment of peace, justice and unity on a global scale.<ref name = "PSmith107">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=107–9}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word ''Bahá'í '' is used either as an adjective to refer to the Bahá'í Faith or as a term for a follower of Bahá'u'lláh. The word is not a noun meaning the religion as a whole.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stockman|2006|p=209}}</ref> It is derived from the Arabic ''[[Bahá'í symbols#The Greatest Name|Bahá' ]]'' ({{lang|ar|بهاء}}), meaning "glory" or "splendor".<ref>Bahá'ís prefer the orthographies ''Bahá'í '', ''Bahá'ís'', ''the Báb'', ''Bahá'u'lláh'', and ''`Abdu'l-Bahá '', using a [[Bahá'í orthography|particular transcription]] of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] in publications. "Bahai", "Bahais", "Baha'i", "the Bab", "Bahaullah" and "Baha'u'llah" are often used when diacriticals are unavailable.</ref> The term "Bahaism" (or "Baha'ism") has been used in the past, but the generally accepted name for the religion is the Bahá'í Faith.<ref>{{Harvnb |Hatcher|Martin|1998| pp = xiii}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = A Journalist's Guide to the Baha'i Faith | author = Centre for Faith and the Media | location = Calgary, Alberta | url = http://www.faithandmedia.org/cms/uploads/files/8_guide-bahai.pdf | publisher = Centre for Faith and the Media | page = 3 | archiveurl =http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120425091536/http://www.faithandmedia.org/cms/uploads/files/8_guide-bahai.pdf | archivedate = April 25, 2012}}</ref>

==Beliefs==
Three core principles establish a basis for Bahá'í teachings and doctrine: the [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|unity of God]], the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion|unity of religion]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of humanity]].<ref name="eor" /> From these postulates stems the belief that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform the character of humankind and develop, within those who respond, moral and spiritual qualities. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.<ref name="PSmith108">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=108–109}}</ref>

===God===
{{Main|God in the Bahá'í Faith}}
[[File:Bahaitemplesydney.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A white domed building|Bahá'í Temple, Ingleside, Sydney, Australia]]
The Bahá'í writings describe a single, personal, inaccessible, omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and almighty God who is the creator of all things in the universe.<ref name="PSmith106">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=106}}</ref> The [[existence of God]] and the [[universe]] is thought to be eternal, without a beginning or end.<ref name="britannica">{{Harvnb|Britannica|1992}}</ref> Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of creation, with a will and purpose that is expressed through messengers termed [[Manifestations of God]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=106–107}}</ref><ref name="PSmith111">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=111–112}}</ref>

Bahá'í teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a complete and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations.<ref name="hatcher_huri">{{harvnb|Hatcher|2005|pp=1–38}}</ref><ref name="manifestation">{{harvnb|Cole|1982|pp=1–38}}</ref> In the Bahá'í religion God is often referred to by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on [[monotheism]]; such doctrines as the [[Trinity]] are seen as compromising, if not contradicting, the Bahá'í view that God is single and has no equal.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Jesus Christ in the Baha'i Writings | first = Robert | last = Stockman | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume= 2 | issue = 1 | url = http://bahai-library.com/stockman_jesus_bahai_writings | ref = harv}}</ref> The Bahá'í teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path.<ref name="hatcher_huri" /><ref name="manifestation" /> According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|prayer]], [[Introspection|reflection]], and being of service to others.<ref name="hatcher_huri" />

===Religion===
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
{{See also|Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)}}
Bahá'í notions of progressive religious revelation result in their accepting the validity of most of the world's religions, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of [[dispensationalism|dispensations]], where each ''manifestation'' brings a somewhat broader and more advanced [[revelation]], suited for the time and place in which it was expressed.<ref name="britannica" /> Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Bahá'í belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; however, it is believed to be cyclical. Bahá'ís do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation.<ref>{{harvnb|McMullen|2000| |p=7}}</ref>

Bahá'í beliefs are sometimes described as [[Syncretism|syncretic]] combinations of earlier religious beliefs.<ref>{{cite book | title = A Resource Guide for the Scholarly Study of the Bahá'í Faith | last = Stockman | first = Robert | chapter = The Baha'i Faith and Syncretism | year = 1997 | url = http://bahai-library.com/stockman_bahai_syncretism}}</ref> Bahá'ís, however, assert that their religion is a distinct tradition with its own [[Bahá'í literature|scriptures]], [[Bahá'í teachings|teachings]], [[Bahá'í laws|laws]], and [[Bahá'í history|history]].<ref name="britannica" /><ref name="EoI">{{cite encyclopedia | title=Bahais | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | url = http://www.brillonline.nl/public/demo#islam | accessdate=May 3, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070507043610/http://www.brillonline.nl/public/demo| archivedate= May 07 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> While the religion was initially seen as a sect of Islam, most religious specialists now see it as an independent religion, with its religious background in [[Shi'a Islam]] being seen as analogous to the Jewish context in which Christianity was established.<ref name="vyer">{{cite book | first = J.D. | last = Van der Vyer | publisher=  Martinus Nijhoff Publishers | year = 1996 | isbn = 90-411-0176-4 | title = Religious human rights in global perspective: religious perspectives | page = 449}}</ref>  Muslim institutions and clergy, both [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]], consider Bahá'ís to be deserters or [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates from Islam]], which has led to Bahá'ís being [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|persecuted]].<ref>{{cite book | first = Kevin | last = Boyle | first2= Juliet | last2 = Sheen | title = Freedom of religion and belief: a world report | publisher = Routledge | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-415-15978-4 | page = 29}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first = Reza | last = Afshari | pages = 119–120 | title = Human rights in Iran: the abuse of cultural relativism | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-8122-3605-X}}</ref> Bahá'ís, themselves, describe their faith as an independent world religion, differing from the other traditions in its relative age and in the appropriateness of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings to the modern context.<ref name="lundberg">{{cite book | title = Baha'i Apocalypticism: The Concept of Progressive Revelation | first = Zaid | last = Lundberg | date = 1996–2005 | url = http://bahai-library.com/lundberg_bahai_apocalypticism | accessdate =May 1, 2007 | chapter = The Concept of Progressive Revelation | publisher = Department of History of Religion at the Faculty of Theology, Lund University }}</ref> Bahá'u'lláh is believed to have fulfilled the [[Eschatology|messianic expectations]] of these precursor faiths.<ref name="buck_eschatologic">{{cite book

{{Main|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity}}
The Bahá'í writings state that human beings have a "rational [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]", and that this provides the species with a unique capacity to recognize God's station and humanity's relationship with its creator. Every human is seen to have a duty to recognize God through His [[Manifestation of God|messengers]], and to conform to their teachings.<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael D. |last=McMullen |year=2000 |title=The Baha'i: The Religious Construction of a Global Identity |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=Atlanta, Georgia |isbn= 0-8135-2836-4 |pages= 57–58 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=lF0UquZAZW8C}}</ref> Through recognition and obedience, service to humanity and regular prayer and spiritual practice, the Bahá'í writings state that the soul becomes closer to God, the spiritual ideal in Bahá'í belief. When a human dies, the soul passes into the next world, where its spiritual development in the physical world becomes a basis for judgment and advancement in the spiritual world. Heaven and Hell are taught to be spiritual states of nearness or distance from God that describe relationships in this world and the next, and not physical places of reward and punishment achieved after death.<ref name="lafd">{{cite book | title = Life After Death: A study of the afterlife in world religions | last = Masumian | first = Farnaz | publisher = Oneworld Publications | location = Oxford | year = 1995 | isbn = 1-85168-074-8}}</ref> See [[Bahá'í Faith on life after death]].

The Bahá'í writings emphasize the essential equality of human beings, and the abolition of prejudice. Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance. Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, social class, and gender-based hierarchy are seen as artificial impediments to unity.<ref name="eor" /> The Bahá'í teachings state that the unification of humanity is the paramount issue in the religious and political conditions of the present world.<ref name="britannica" />

===Summary===
[[Shoghi Effendi]], the appointed head of the religion from 1921 to 1957, wrote the following summary of what he considered to be the distinguishing principles of [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s teachings, which, he said, together with the laws and ordinances of the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'' constitute the bedrock of the Bahá'í Faith:
{{quote|The independent search after truth, unfettered by [[superstition]] or tradition; the oneness of the entire [[Human|human race]], the pivotal principle and fundamental doctrine of the Faith; the basic unity of all religions; the condemnation of all forms of [[prejudice]], whether religious, racial, class or national; the harmony which must exist between religion and science; the equality of men and women, the two wings on which the bird of human kind is able to soar; the introduction of compulsory education; the adoption of a [[Bahá'í Faith and auxiliary language|universal auxiliary language]]; the abolition of the extremes of wealth and poverty; the institution of a [[World government|world tribunal]] for the adjudication of disputes between nations; the exaltation of work, performed in the spirit of service, to the rank of [[worship]]; the glorification of justice as the ruling principle in human society, and of religion as a bulwark for the protection of all peoples and nations; and the establishment of a permanent and [[World peace|universal peace]] as the supreme goal of all mankind—these stand out as the essential elements [which Bahá'u'lláh proclaimed].<ref>{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, US |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-20.html#gr7 | pages=281–2}}</ref>}}

===Social principles===
The following principles are frequently listed as a quick summary of the Bahá'í teachings. They are derived from transcripts of speeches given by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] during his tour of Europe and North America in 1912.<ref name="PSmith52">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=52–53}}</ref><ref name="bcom">{{cite web | title = Principles of the Bahá'í Faith | publisher= bahai.com | date=March 26, 2006 | url = http://www.bahai.com/Bahaullah/principles.htm | accessdate =June 14, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060615022006/http://www.bahai.com/Bahaullah/principles.htm| archivedate= June 15, 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The list is not authoritative and a variety of such lists circulate.<ref name="EoI" /><ref name="bcom" /><ref name="iranica2">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Bahai Faith | first = Juan | last = Cole | authorlink = Juan Cole | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bahaism-i  | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080317100238/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f4/v3f4a100a.html| archivedate = March 17, 2008}}</ref>

*Elimination of extremes of wealth and poverty

With specific regard to the pursuit of [[world peace]], [[Bahá'u'lláh]] prescribed a world-embracing [[collective security]] arrangement as necessary for the establishment of a lasting peace.<ref name="Smith-peace">{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= peace |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 266–267}}</ref>

===Mystical teachings===
Although the [[Bahá'í teachings]] have a strong emphasis on social and ethical issues, there exist a number of foundational texts that have been described as mystical.<ref name="britannica" /> The ''[[Seven Valleys]]'' is considered Bahá'u'lláh's "greatest mystical composition." It was written to a follower of [[Sufism]], in the style of [[Attar Neyshapuri|{{nbsp}}`Attar]], a Muslim poet,<ref name="ency_sevenvalleys">{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Seven Valleys |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |page=311}}</ref> and sets forth the stages of the soul's journey towards God. It was first translated into English in 1906, becoming one of the earliest available books of Bahá'u'lláh to the West. The ''[[Hidden Words]]'' is another book written by Bahá'u'lláh during the same period, containing 153 short passages in which Bahá'u'lláh claims to have taken the basic essence of certain spiritual truths and written them in brief form.<ref name="hiddenwords">{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Hidden Words |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |page= 181}}</ref>

===Covenant===
{{Main|Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh}}
The Bahá'í teachings speak of both a "Greater Covenant",<ref>{{cite book |last= Taherzadeh |first= Adib |authorlink= Adib Taherzadeh |year= 1972 |title= The Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-344-5}}</ref> being universal and endless, and a "Lesser Covenant", being unique to each religious dispensation. The Lesser Covenant is viewed as an agreement between a Messenger of God and his followers and includes social practices and the continuation of authority in the religion. At this time Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh's revelation as a binding lesser covenant for his followers; in the Bahá'í writings being firm in the covenant is considered a virtue to work toward.<ref name="momen_covenant">{{cite web | title = Covenant, The, and Covenant-breaker | last = Momen | first = Moojan | accessdate =June 14, 2006 | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant#3.%20The%20Lesser%20Covenant }}</ref> The Greater Covenant is viewed as a more enduring agreement between God and humanity, where a Manifestation of God is expected to come to humanity about every thousand years, at times of turmoil and uncertainty.

With unity as an essential teaching of the religion, Bahá'ís follow an [[Bahá'í administration|administration]] they believe is divinely ordained, and therefore see attempts to create schisms and divisions as efforts that are contrary to the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh. Schisms have occurred over the succession of authority, but any [[Bahá'í divisions]] have had relatively little success and have failed to attract a sizeable following.<ref name="maceoin">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Bahai Faith | first = Denis | last = MacEoin | authorlink = Denis MacEoin | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bahaism-iii | pages= 448}}</ref> The followers of such divisions are regarded as [[Covenant-breaker]]s and shunned, essentially [[Excommunication|excommunicated]].<ref name="momen_covenant" /><ref name="PSmith173">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=173}}</ref>

==Canonical texts==
{{Main|Bahá'í literature}}
The ''canonical texts'' are the writings of the [[Báb]], [[Bahá'u'lláh]], [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], [[Shoghi Effendi]] and the [[Universal House of Justice]], and the authenticated talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá. The writings of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh are considered as divine revelation, the writings and talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá and the writings of Shoghi Effendi as authoritative interpretation, and those of the Universal House of Justice as authoritative legislation and elucidation. Some measure of divine guidance is assumed for all of these texts.<ref name="Smith-canonical-texts">{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= canonical texts |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 100–101}}</ref>  Some of Bahá'u'lláh's most important writings include the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]], literally the ''Most Holy Book'', which is his book of laws,<ref>{{Harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|pp=46}}</ref> the [[Kitáb-i-Íqán]], literally the ''Book of Certitude'', which became the foundation of much of Bahá'í belief,<ref>{{Harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|pp=137}}</ref> the [[Gems of Divine Mysteries]], which includes further doctrinal foundations, and the [[Seven Valleys]] and the [[The Four Valleys|Four Valleys]] which are mystical treatises.<ref name="PSmith20"/>

{{Main|Bahá'í history}}
Bahá'í history follows a sequence of leaders, beginning with the [[Báb]]'s May 23, 1844 declaration in [[Shiraz, Iran]], and ultimately resting on an administrative order established by the central figures of the religion. The Bahai community was mostly confined to the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires until after the death of Bahá'u'lláh in 1892, at which time he had followers in 13 countries of Asia and Africa.<ref name="rob4">{{cite book |author= Taherzadeh, Adib |year= 1987 |title= The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 4: Mazra'ih & Bahji 1877–92 |page=125 |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-270-8 |url=http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha%27i/Others/ROB/V4/p118-144Ch08.html#p125}}</ref> Under the leadership of his son, `Abdu'l-Bahá, the religion gained a footing in Europe and America, and was consolidated in Iran, where it still suffers intense [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|persecution]].<ref name="affolter"/>  After the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá in 1921, the leadership of the Bahá'í community entered a new phase, evolving from a single individual to an administrative order with both elected bodies and appointed individuals.<ref name="PSmith56" />

===The Báb===
{{Main|Báb}}
[[File:Shrine Bab North West.jpg|left|alt=A domed building|thumb|upright|[[Shrine of the Báb]] in Haifa, Israel.]]
On May 23, 1844 Siyyid `Alí-Muhammad of Shiraz, Iran proclaimed that he was "the Báb" ({{lang|ar|الباب}} "the Gate"), referring to his later claim to the station of [[Mahdi]], the Twelfth Imam of [[Shi'a Islam|Shi`a Islam]].<ref name="affolter" /> His followers were therefore known as [[Bábism|Bábís]]. As the Báb's teachings spread, which the Islamic clergy saw as a threat, his followers came under increased persecution and torture.<ref name="britannica" /> The conflicts escalated in several places to military sieges by the [[List of kings of Persia|Shah]]'s army. The Báb himself was imprisoned and eventually executed in 1850.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://bahai-library.com/winters_dying_for_god | last = Winter | first = Jonah | date =September 17, 1997 | title= Dying for God: Martyrdom in the Shii and Babi Religions | journal = Master of Arts Thesis, University of Toronto | ref = harv }}</ref>

Bahá'ís see the Báb as the forerunner of the Bahá'í Faith, because the Báb's writings introduced the concept of "[[He whom God shall make manifest]]", a Messianic figure whose coming, according to Bahá'ís, was announced in the scriptures of all of the world's great religions, and whom Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, claimed to be in 1863.<ref name="britannica" /> [[Shrine of the Báb|The Báb's tomb]], located in [[Haifa|Haifa, Israel]], is an important place of [[Bahá'í pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] for Bahá'ís. The remains of the Báb were brought secretly from [[Iran]] to the Holy Land and eventually interred in the tomb built for them in a spot specifically designated by Bahá'u'lláh.<ref name="balyuzi">{{cite book |first=Hasan |last=Balyuzi |authorlink=Hasan M.

===Bahá'u'lláh===
{{Main|Bahá'u'lláh}}
Mírzá Husayn `Alí Núrí was one of the early followers of the Báb, and later took the title of Bahá'u'lláh. He was arrested and imprisoned for this involvement in 1852. Bahá'u'lláh relates that in 1853, while incarcerated in the dungeon of the [[Síyáh-Chál]] in [[Tehran]], he received the first intimations that he was the one anticipated by the Báb.<ref name="eor" />

Shortly thereafter he was expelled from [[Tehran]] to [[Baghdad]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]];<ref name="eor" /> then to Constantinople (now [[Istanbul]]); and then to Adrianople (now [[Edirne]]). In 1863, at the time of his banishment from Baghdad to Constantinople, Bahá'u'lláh declared his claim to a divine mission to his family and followers. Tensions then grew between him and [[Subh-i-Azal]], the appointed leader of the Bábís who did not recognize Bahá'u'lláh's claim. Throughout the rest of his life Bahá'u'lláh gained the allegiance of most of the Bábís, who came to be known as Bahá'ís. Beginning in 1866, he began declaring his mission as a Messenger of God in letters to the world's religious and secular rulers, including [[Pope Pius IX]], [[Napoleon III]], and [[Queen Victoria]].

In 1868 Bahá'u'lláh was banished by Sultan [[Abdülâziz]] a final time to the Ottoman penal colony of [[Acre, Israel|`Akká]], in present-day [[Israel]].<ref name="iranica">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Baha'-allah | first = Juan | last = Cole | authorlink = Juan Cole | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baha-allah| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071116044401/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f4/v3f4a085.html | archivedate = November 16, 2007}}</ref> Towards the end of his life, the strict and harsh confinement was gradually relaxed, and he was allowed to live in a home near `Akká, while still officially a prisoner of that city.<ref name="iranica" /> He died there in 1892.

===`Abdu'l-Bahá===
{{Main|`Abdu'l-Bahá}}
`Abbás Effendi was Bahá'u'lláh's eldest son, known by the title of `Abdu'l-Bahá (Servant of Bahá). His father left a [[Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh#Kitáb-i-`Ahd (Book of the Covenant)|Will]] that appointed `Abdu'l-Bahá as the leader of the Bahá'í community, and designated him as the "Centre of the Covenant", "Head of the Faith", and the sole authoritative interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh's writings.<ref name="balyuzi" /><ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=47}}</ref> `Abdu'l-Bahá had shared his father's long exile and imprisonment, which continued until `Abdu'l-Bahá's own release as a result of the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908. Following his release he led a life of travelling, speaking, teaching, and maintaining correspondence with communities of believers and individuals, expounding the principles of the Bahá'í Faith.<ref name="eor" />

===Bahá'í administration===
{{Main|Bahá'í administration}}
Bahá'u'lláh's ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'' and ''The [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá]]'' are foundational documents of the Bahá'í administrative order. Bahá'u'lláh established the elected [[Universal House of Justice]], and `Abdu'l-Bahá established the appointed hereditary Guardianship and clarified the relationship between the two institutions.<ref name="balyuzi"/><ref name="PSmith55">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=55–57}}</ref> In his Will, `Abdu'l-Bahá appointed his eldest grandson, [[Shoghi Effendi]], as the first ''Guardian'' of the Bahá'í Faith, serving as head of the religion until his death, for 36 years.<ref name="PSmith55"/>

Shoghi Effendi throughout his lifetime translated [[Bahá'í texts]]; developed global plans for the expansion of the Bahá'í community; developed the [[Bahá'í World Centre]]; carried on a voluminous correspondence with communities and individuals around the world; and built the administrative structure of the religion, preparing the community for the election of the Universal House of Justice.<ref name="eor" /> He died in 1957 under conditions that did not allow for a successor to be appointed.<ref>{{cite book |last = Taherzadeh |first = A. |authorlink= Adib Taherzadeh |year = 2000 |title = The Child of the Covenant |pages = 347–363 |publisher = George Ronald |location = Oxford, UK |isbn = 0-85398-439-5}}</ref><ref name="PSmith68">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=58–69}}</ref>

At local, regional, and national levels, Bahá'ís elect members to nine-person [[Spiritual Assembly|Spiritual Assemblies]], which run the affairs of the religion. There are also [[Institution of the Counsellors|appointed individuals]] working at various levels, including locally and internationally, which perform the function of propagating the teachings and protecting the community.

*[[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith]] consists of obligatory prayer and devotional (general) prayer. Bahá'ís over the age of 15 must individually recite an [[Obligatory Bahá'í prayers|obligatory prayer]] each day, using fixed words and form. In addition to the daily obligatory prayer, believers are directed to daily offer [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|devotional prayer]] and to meditate and study sacred scripture. There is no set form for devotions and meditations, though the devotional prayers written by the central figures of the Bahá'í Faith and collected in prayer books are held in high esteem. Reading aloud of prayers from prayer books is a typical feature of Bahá'í gatherings.
*[[Backbiting]] and gossip are prohibited and denounced.
*Adult Bahá'ís in good health should observe a [[Nineteen Day Fast|nineteen-day sunrise-to-sunset fast]] each year from March 2 through March 20.
*Bahá'ís are forbidden to drink [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] or to take drugs, unless prescribed by doctors.
*[[Sexual intercourse]] is only permitted between a husband and wife, and thus [[premarital]], [[extramarital sex|extramarital]] and homosexual intercourse are forbidden. ''(See also [[Homosexuality and the Bahá'í Faith]])''
*Gambling is forbidden.
*[[Fanaticism]] is forbidden.
*Adherence to [[ritual]] is discouraged, with the notable exception of the obligatory prayers.

The purpose of marriage in the Bahá'i faith is mainly to foster spiritual harmony, fellowship and unity between a man and a woman and to provide a stable and loving environment for the rearing of children.<ref name="PSmith164">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=164–165}}</ref> The Bahá'í teachings on marriage call it a ''fortress for well-being and salvation'' and place marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure of [[society|human society]].<ref name="PSmith164"/> Bahá'u'lláh highly praised marriage, discouraged divorce and homosexuality, and required [[chastity]] outside of marriage; Bahá'u'lláh taught that a husband and wife should strive to improve the spiritual life of each other.<ref name="marriage_pamphlet">{{cite web | author = Local Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Warwick | title= Baha'i Marriage | date = October 12, 2003 | url = http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~vickers/warwick_bookshop/pages/marriage.html | accessdate =June 14, 2006|publisher = Bahá'ís of Warwick| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060528062119/http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~vickers/warwick_bookshop/pages/marriage.html| archivedate= May 28, 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Interracial marriage]] is also highly praised throughout Bahá'í scripture.<ref name="PSmith164"/>

Bahá'ís intending to marry are asked to obtain a thorough understanding of the other's character before deciding to marry.<ref name="PSmith164"/> Although parents should not [[Arranged marriage|choose partners for their children]], once two individuals decide to marry, they must receive the consent of all living biological parents, even if one partner is not a Bahá'í. The Bahá'í marriage ceremony is simple; the only compulsory part of the wedding is the reading of the wedding vows prescribed by [[Bahá'u'lláh]] which both the groom and the bride read, in the presence of two witnesses.<ref name="PSmith164"/> The vows are "We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God."<ref name="PSmith164"/>

===Work===
[[Monasticism]] is forbidden, and Bahá'ís attempt to ground their spirituality in ordinary daily life. Performing useful work, for example, is not only required but considered a form of worship.<ref name="britannica" /> Bahá'u'lláh prohibited a [[Mendicancy|mendicant]] and [[Asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle.<ref name="PSmith154">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=154–155}}</ref>  The importance of self-exertion and service to humanity in one's spiritual life is emphasised further in Bahá'u'lláh's writings, where he states that work done in the spirit of service to humanity enjoys a rank equal to that of prayer and worship in the sight of God.<ref name="britannica" />

===Calendar===
{{Main|Bahá'í calendar}}
The Bahá'í calendar is based upon the calendar established by the Báb. The year consists of 19 months, each having 19 days, with four or five [[Ayyám-i-Há|intercalary days]], to make a full [[Tropical year|solar year]].<ref name="eor" /> The Bahá'í New Year corresponds to the traditional Persian New Year, called [[Bahá'í Naw-Rúz|Naw Rúz]], and occurs on the [[vernal equinox]], March 21, at the end of the month of fasting. Bahá'í communities gather at the beginning of each month at a meeting called a [[Nineteen Day Feast|Feast]] for worship, consultation and socializing.<ref name="britannica" />

Each of the 19 months is given a name which is an attribute of God; some examples include Bahá’ (Splendour), ‘Ilm (Knowledge), and Jamál (Beauty).<ref name="PSmith188">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=188–190}}</ref> The Bahá'í week is familiar in that it consists of seven days, with each day of the week also named after an attribute of God. Bahá'ís observe 11 [[Ascension of Bahá'u'lláh|Holy Days]] throughout the year, with work suspended on 9 of these. These days commemorate important anniversaries in the history of the religion.<ref name="PSmith188"/>

The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated October 20, 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.<ref>{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen | coauthors = Smith, Peter | year = 1989 | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 | journal = Religion |issue= 1 | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8 |ref= harv}}</ref>

Bahá'u'lláh wrote of the need for [[world government]] in this age of humanity's collective life.

===Iran===
The marginalization of the Iranian Bahá'ís by current governments is rooted in historical efforts by Muslim clergy to persecute the religious minority. When the Báb started attracting a large following, the clergy hoped to stop the movement from spreading by stating that its followers were enemies of God. These clerical directives led to mob attacks and public executions.<ref name="affolter"/> Starting in the twentieth century, in addition to repression that impacted individual Bahá'ís, centrally directed campaigns that targeted the entire Bahá'í community and institutions were initiated.<ref name="ihrdc">{{cite web |author=Iran Human Rights Documentation Center| publisher=Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|title=A Faith Denied: The Persecution of the Baha'is of Iran|year=2007|accessdate=1 May 2007|url=http://www.iranhrdc.org/httpdocs/English/pdfs/Reports/A-Faith-Denied_Dec06.pdf|format=PDF | archiveurl= http://wayback.archive.org/web/20100902191009/http://www.iranhrdc.org/httpdocs/English/pdfs/PressReleases/2008/Press-05-15-08.pdf| archivedate =September 2, 2010}}</ref> In one case in [[Yazd]] in 1903 more than 100 Bahá'ís were killed.<ref name="nash">{{cite book | title  = Iran's secret pogrom: The conspiracy to wipe out the Bahaʼis | first = Geoffrey | last = Nash | publisher= Neville Spearman Limited | location = Sudbury, Suffolk | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-85435-005-5}}</ref> Bahá'í schools, such as the Tarbiyat boys' and girl's schools in Tehran, were closed in the 1930s and 40s, Bahá'í marriages were not recognized and [[Bahá'í texts]] were censored.<ref name="ihrdc" /><ref name="sanasarian">{{cite book | first = Eliz | last = Sanasarian|title = Religious Minorities in Iran | location = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | pages = 52–53 | isbn = 0-521-77073-4 | url = http://www.books.google.com/books?id=mpQCjXm0HAwC}}</ref>

The [[Egyptian identification card controversy]] began in the 1990s when the government modernized the electronic processing of [[identity documents]], which introduced a de facto requirement that documents must list the person's religion as Muslim, Christian, or Jewish (the only three religions officially recognized by the government). Consequently, Bahá'ís were unable to obtain government identification documents (such as national identification cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports) necessary to exercise their rights in their country unless they lied about their religion, which conflicts with Bahá'í religious principle.<ref name="hor">{{cite web | title = Congressional Human Rights Caucus, House of Representatives | accessdate =December 29, 2006 | date = November 16, 2005 | url = http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/Briefing+Testimonies/11-17-05+Testimony+of+Kit+Bigelow+Egypt+Briefing.htm|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061227195313/http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/Briefing+Testimonies/11-17-05+Testimony+of+Kit+Bigelow+Egypt+Briefing.htm |archivedate = December 27, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Without documents, they could not be employed, educated, treated in hospitals, travel outside of the country, or vote, among other hardships.<ref name="hor"/> Following a protracted legal process culminating in a court ruling favorable to the Bahá'ís, the interior minister of Egypt released a decree on April 14, 2009, amending the law to allow Egyptians who are not Muslim, Christian, or Jewish to obtain identification documents that list dash in place of one of the three recognized religions.<ref>{{cite news | title = Egypt officially changes rules for ID cards | last = Editors of Bahá'í News Service | date = April 17, 2009 | accessdate =June 16, 2009 | publisher = Bahá'í News Service | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/707 }}</ref> The first identification cards were issued to two Bahá'ís under the new decree on August 8, 2009.<ref>{{cite web | title = First identification cards issued to Egyptian Bahá'ís using a "dash" instead of religion | last = Editors of Bahá'í News Service | date = August 14, 2009 | accessdate =August 16, 2009 | publisher = Bahá'í News Service | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/726 }}</ref>

===Reactions===
[[Bernard Lewis]] states that the Muslim laity and Islamic authorities have always had great difficulty in accommodating post-Islamic [[monotheistic]] religions such as the Bahá'í Faith, since the followers of such religions cannot be dismissed either as benighted [[mushrik|heathens]], like the [[polytheists]] of Asia and the [[animists]] of Africa, nor as [[People of the Book|followers of earlier revelations]], like the Jews and Christians. Moreover, their very existence presents a challenge to the Islamic doctrine of the finality of Muhammad's revelation.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|1984|pp=20–21}}</ref>
