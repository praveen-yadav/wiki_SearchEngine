'''Dilation (or dilatation) and curettage''' (D&C) refers to the [[Cervical dilation|dilation]] (widening/opening) of the [[cervix]] and surgical removal of part of the lining of the [[uterus]] and/or contents of the uterus by scraping and scooping ([[curettage]]). It is a therapeutic [[gynecological]] procedure as well as a rarely used method of first trimester [[abortion]].<!--

D&C normally refers to a procedure involving a [[curette]], also called ''sharp curettage''.<ref name="webmd abort" /> However, some sources use the term D&C to refer more generally to any procedure that involves the processes of dilation and removal of uterine contents, which includes the more common ''suction curettage'' procedures of manual and electric [[vacuum aspiration]].<!--

==Procedure==
[[File:Dilation & curettage.svg|thumb|An illustration of a dilation and curettage]]
The first step in a D&C is to dilate the [[cervix]], usually done a few hours before the surgery. The woman is usually put under [[general anesthesia]] before the procedure begins. A curette, a metal rod with a handle on one end and a sharp loop on the other, is inserted into the uterus through the dilated cervix. The curette is used to gently scrape the lining of the uterus and remove the tissue in the uterus. This tissue is examined for completeness (in the case of abortion or [[miscarriage]] treatment) or [[pathology|pathologically]] for abnormalities (in the case of treatment for [[Dysfunctional uterine bleeding|abnormal bleeding]]).<ref name="webmd abort" />

==Clinical uses==
D&amp;Cs are commonly performed for the diagnosis of gynecological conditions leading to 'abnormal uterine bleeding';<ref>{{cite journal|author=Anastasiadis PG, Koutlaki NG, Skaphida PG, Galazios GC, Tsikouras PN, Liberis VA. |title=Endometrial polyps: prevalence, detection, and malignant potential in women with abnormal uterine bleeding. |journal=Eur J Gynaecol Oncol. |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=180–183. |year=2000 |pmid=10843481 |doi=}}</ref> to resolve abnormal uterine bleeding (too much, too often or too heavy a [[menses|menstrual]] flow);<ref name="webmd gyne" /> to remove the excess uterine lining in women who have conditions such as [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] (which cause a prolonged buildup of tissue with no natural period to remove it);{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} to remove tissue in the uterus that may be causing abnormal vaginal bleeding,<ref name="webmd abort" /> including postpartum retained placenta;<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wolman I, Altman E, Fait G, Har-Toov J, Gull I, Amster R, Jaffa A. |title=Evacuating retained products of conception in the setting of an ultrasound unit. |journal=Fertil Steril. |volume=91 |issue=(4 Suppl) |pages=1586–88. |year=2009 |pmid=19064261 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.10.032}}</ref> to remove retained tissue (also known as retained POC or retained products of conception) in the case of a [[missed miscarriage|missed]] or incomplete [[miscarriage]];<ref name="webmd miscar" /> and as a method of [[abortion]] that is now uncommon.<ref name="webmd abort" /> In contrast, D&C remains 'standard care' for missed and incomplete miscarriage in many countries despite the existence of alternatives currently used for abortions.

Because medical and non-invasive methods of abortion now exist, and because D&amp;C requires heavy sedation or general anesthesia and has higher risks of complication, the procedure has been declining as a method of abortion. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends D&amp;C as a method of surgical abortion only when manual [[vacuum aspiration]] is unavailable.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite web | title=Dilatation and curettage | work=A-Z Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth by WHO | url=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Dilatetion_P61_P63.html |accessdate=February 20, 2006 }}</ref> Most D&Cs are now carried out for miscarriage management and other indications such as diagnosis.

[[Hysteroscopy]] is a valid alternative to D&C for many surgical indications from diagnosis of uterine pathology to the removal of fibroids and even retained products of conception. It poses less risk because the doctor has a view inside the uterus during surgery, unlike with blind D&C.

Medical management of miscarriage and medical abortion using drugs such as [[misoprostol]] and [[mifepristone]] are safe, non-invasive and cheaper alternatives to D&C.

==Complications==
Complications may arise from either the introduction or spreading of infection, adverse reaction to general anesthesia required during the surgery or from instrumentation itself, if the procedure is performed blindly (without the use of any imaging technique such as [[ultrasound]] or [[hysteroscopy]]).

One risk of sharp curettage is [[uterine perforation]]. Although normally no treatment is required for uterine perforation, a [[laparoscopy]] may be done to verify that bleeding has stopped on its own. Infection of the uterus or fallopian tubes is also a possible complication, especially if the woman has an untreated [[sexually transmitted infection]].<ref name="webmd abort" />

Another risk is intrauterine adhesions, or [[Asherman's syndrome]]. One study found that in women who had one or two sharp curettage procedures for miscarriage, 14-16% developed some adhesions.<ref name="freidler">{{cite journal |author=Friedler S, Margalioth EJ, Kafka I, Yaffe H |title=Incidence of post-abortion intra-uterine adhesions evaluated by hysteroscopy--a prospective study |journal=Hum.
