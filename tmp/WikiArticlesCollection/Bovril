'''Bovril''' is the trademarked name of a thick, salty [[meat extract]], developed in the 1870s by [[John Lawson Johnston]] and sold in a distinctive, bulbous jar. It is made in [[Burton upon Trent]], [[Staffordshire]], owned and distributed by [[Unilever]] UK.

Bovril can be made into a drink by diluting with hot water, or less commonly with milk.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1302&dat=19310701&id=CV0RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=P5YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3083,128400 |title=Try Bovril and milk (advert), |newspaper=[[The Sydney Mail]] |date=1 July 1931 |page= 23}}</ref> It can also be used as a flavouring for [[soup]]s, [[stew]]s or [[porridge]], or spread on [[bread]], especially [[toast]], rather like [[Marmite]].

The first part of the product's name comes from [[Latin]] ''bos'' meaning "ox" or "cow". Johnston took the ''-vril'' suffix from [[Edward George Bulwer-Lytton|Bulwer-Lytton]]'s then-popular "lost race" novel ''[[The Coming Race]]'' (1870), whose plot revolves around a superior race of people, the Vril-ya, who derive their powers from an electromagnetic substance named "Vril".<ref name="patent-law-42">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=William Phillips|title=Handbook of patent law of all countries.|publisher=Stevens|location=London|year=1920|page=42|url=http://www.archive.org/details/handbookofpatent00thomiala|accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref><ref name=uni>{{cite web|title=Bovril|url=http://www.unilever.co.uk/brands/foodbrands/bovril.aspx|work=Unilever.co.uk|accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Bovril poster c1900.jpg|thumb|right|180pxr|Poster for Bovril, about 1900 [[V&A Museum]] no. E.163-1973]]
In 1870, in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], [[Napoleon III]] ordered one million cans of beef to feed his troops. The task of providing all this beef went to a [[Scotsman]] living in Canada named [[John Lawson Johnston]]. Large quantities of beef were available across the British Dominions and South America, but its transport and storage were problematic. Therefore, Johnston created a product known as 'Johnston's Fluid Beef', later called Bovril, to meet the needs of Napoleon III.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bovril.co.uk/content/history/history.pdf |title=History |publisher=borvil.co.uk}}</ref> By 1888, over 3,000 [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[public house]]s, [[grocer]]s and [[Dispensing chemist|chemist]]s were selling Bovril. In 1889, the Bovril Company was formed.

Bovril continued to function as a "war food" in [[World War I]] and was frequently mentioned in the 1930 account ''Not So Quiet... Stepdaughters of War'' by Helen Zenna Smith ([[Evadne Price]]). One account from the book describes it being prepared for the casualties at [[Mons,_Belgium#Battle_of_Mons|Mons]] where "the orderlies were just beginning to make Bovril for the wounded, when the bearers and ambulance wagons were shelled as they were bringing the wounded into the hospital".<ref name="ramc-99">{{cite book|last=Vivian|first=Evelyn Charles|title=With the Royal army medical corps (R.A.M.C.) at the front|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|year=1914|page=99|url=http://www.archive.org/details/withroyalarmymed00vivirich}}</ref>

A thermos of ''beef tea'' was the favoured way to fend off the chill of winter matches for generations of British  [[Association football|football]] enthusiasts; to this day, Bovril dissolved in hot water is sold in stadiums all over the [[United Kingdom]]. Bovril ''beef tea'' was the main warm drink that [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s team had to drink when they were marooned on [[Elephant Island]] during the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|Endurance Expedition]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9504E1DF1F3FE233A25752C1A96F9C946796D6CF|title=Shackleton's men kept hope of rescue high; Marooned Scientists, Living on Penguin and Seaweed, Watched Daily for Relief.|date=1916-09-11|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-05-11 | format=PDF}}</ref>

When John Lawson Johnston died, [[George Lawson Johnston, 1st Baron Luke|George Lawson Johnston]] inherited the Bovril business. In 1929, George Lawson Johnston was recognised by the [[British Government]] and [[monarchy]] and was ennobled as [[Baron Luke|Lord Luke of Pavenham]] in the county of Bedford. This hereditary title passed to [[Ian Lawson Johnston, 2nd Baron Luke|Ian St John Lawson Johnston]] in 1943 and to [[Arthur Lawson Johnston, 3rd Baron Luke|Arthur Charles St John Lawson Johnston]] in 1996. The current Lord Luke is one of the 92 hereditary peers elected to remain in the [[House of Lords]] of the [[United Kingdom]] after its 1999 [[Reform of the House of Lords|reform]].

Bovril's instant beef stock was launched in 1966 and its "King of Beef" range of instant flavours for [[stew]]s, [[casserole]]s and [[gravy]] in 1971.

In 1971, [[Cavenham Foods]] acquired the Bovril Company but then sold most of its dairies and [[South America]]n operations to finance further take-overs.<ref>[http://ketupa.net/goldsmith.htm Goldsmith]</ref> The brand is now owned by [[Unilever]].<ref name=uni/>

Bovril holds the unusual position of having been advertised with a [[Pope]]. An advertising campaign of the early 20th century in Britain depicted  [[Pope Leo XIII]] seated on his throne, bearing a mug of Bovril. The campaign slogan read: ''The Two [[Papal infallibility|Infallible]] Powers – The Pope & Bovril.''

==Licensed production==
Bovril is also produced in [[South Africa]] by the Bokomo division of Pioneer Foods<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pioneerfoods.co.za |title=Pioneer Foods |publisher=pioneerfoods.co.za}}</ref> The product range includes a version with chili.
The manufacturer also hoped to increase exports (Unilever UK & Ireland Export) to Asian countries such as [[Malaysia]], a primarily [[Muslim]] country where the government was becoming restrictive regarding non-[[halal]] meat. By changing Bovril to a non-meat base, Unilever hoped to increase sales there, where people enjoy Bovril stirred into porridge.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

The removal of beef from the recipe in 2004 was not without criticism, with many complaining that the new variant did not taste the same and had a different [[mouth feel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Beef extract was eventually reintroduced as a key Bovril ingredient in 2006, after the [[European Commission]] lifted its ban on the export of Britain's beef products; it was only at this point that the manufacturer stated explicitly that this had been the main reason for beef's removal. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

During the [[Siege of Ladysmith]] in the [[Second Boer War]], a Bovril-like paste was unofficially produced from horse meat within the garrison. Nicknamed ''Chevril'' (by replacing the Bov (''ox'') with Chev (''horse'') in the Bovril name) it was produced by [[boiling down]] horse meat or mules to a jelly paste and serving it as a ''beef tea''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Watt|first=S|title=Intombi Military Hospital and Cemetery|journal=Military History Journal|publisher=Die Suid-Afrikaanse Krygshistoriese Vereniging|volume=5|issue=6|url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol056sw.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jacson|first=M|title=The Record of a Regiment of the Line|publisher=Hutchinson & Co. |year=1908 |page=88 |chapter=II |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15972}}</ref>

==Recipe changes==
In November 2004, the manufacturers, [[Unilever]], announced that the composition of Bovril was being changed from beef extract to a [[yeast extract]], claiming it was to make the product suitable for [[vegetarian]]s and [[vegan]]s; at that time fear of [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE) may have been a factor. According to Unilever, ''"in blind taste tests, 10% didn't notice any difference in taste, 40% preferred the original and 50% preferred the new product"''. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
It now once again makes Bovril using beef extract and a chicken variety using chicken extract,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unilever.co.uk/brands/foodbrands/bovril.aspx |title=Bovril Unilever food brands}}</ref> although the vegetarian formula is still sold in some countries, such as Australia and Hong Kong.

==Cultural significance==

Since its invention, Bovril has become an [[cultural icon|icon]] of [[culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]]. It is commonly associated with [[football culture]], since during the winter British football fans in stadium terraces often drink it from [[thermos]]es (or disposable cups in Scotland, where containers such as thermoses are [[Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995#Part II - Sporting Events: Control of Alcohol etc.|banned]] from football stadiums).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/bovril-it-s-a-drink-a-spread-even-a-crisp-flavouring-and-it-was-created-in-edinburgh-1-814491 | title=Bovril: It's a drink, a spread, even a crisp flavouring, and it was created in Edinburgh | work=[[The Scotsman]] | date=8 June 2010 | accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2009/08/07/8176-1549/ | title=Tribute to Scots Bovril inventor | work=Deadline News | date=7 August 2009 | accessdate=20 October 2013 | author=Alexander Lawrie}}</ref>

During a 2011 episode of ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'', [[James May]] drank from an urn of Bovril while driving a snow plow in Norway and commented: "We all know that when it's snowing and it's cold you have Bovril.  That's a rule of life."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x31w1/episodes/2011 |title=Top Gear: series 16, episode 5 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2011-12-29}}</ref>
