{{Politics of Cuba}}
[[Cuba]]'s once-ambitious foreign policy has been downsized as a result of [[economy|economic hardship]] after the collapse of the [[Soviet bloc]]. Without massive Soviet subsidies and its primary [[trade|trading]], partner Cuba was comparatively isolated in the 1990s, but has since entered bilateral co-operation with several [[South America]]n countries, most notably [[Venezuela]] and [[Bolivia]]. The [[United States of America]] continues an [[embargo]] "so long as it continues to refuse to move toward democratization and greater respect for human rights",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/www/regions/wha/cuba/democ_act_1992.html|title=Cuban Democracy Act of 1992|publisher=State Department}}</ref> while the [[European Union]] accuses Cuba of [[Human rights in Cuba|"continuing flagrant violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms"]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2004:076E:0384:0386:EN:PDF|title=EU-Cuba relations}}</ref> Cuba has developed a growing relationship with the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Russia]].

==History==
===Spanish colonial period.===
Prior to achieving its independence, Cuba was a colony of Spain.

===1898–1959===
Prior to the triumph of the [[Cuban Revolution]], Cuba maintained strong economic and political ties to the United States. From 1902 until its abrogation in 1934, the [[Platt Amendment]] authorized the US to use military force to preserve Cuba's independence.

In 1917, Cuba entered World War I on the side of the allies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emayzine.com/lectures/HISTOR~7.htm |title=History of Cuba |publisher=Emayzine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref>

Cuba joined the [[League of Nations]] in 1920.

In 1941, Cuba declared war on Italy, Germany, and Japan.

Cuba joined the United Nations in 1945.

Cuba joined the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in 1948.

During the Presidency of [[Fulgencio Batista]], Cuba did not initially face trade restrictions. In mid-1958, the United States imposed an arms embargo on the Batista administration.

Following the establishment of diplomatic ties to the Soviet Union, and after the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cuba became increasingly dependent on Soviet markets and military and economic aid. Castro was able to build a formidable military force with the help of Soviet equipment and military advisors. The KGB kept in close touch with Havana, and Castro tightened Communist Party control over all levels of government, the media, and the educational system, while developing a Soviet-style internal police force.

Castro's alliance with the Soviet Union caused something of a split between him and Guevara. In 1966, Guevara left for [[Bolivia]] in an ill-fated attempt to stir up revolution against the country's government.

On August 23, 1968, Castro made a public gesture to the USSR that caused the Soviet leadership to reaffirm their support for him. Two days after [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|the Soviet invasion of]] [[Czechoslovakia]] to repress the [[Prague Spring]], Castro took to the airwaves and publicly denounced the Czech rebellion. Castro warned the Cuban people about the Czechoslovakian 'counterrevolutionaries', who "were moving Czechoslovakia towards capitalism and into the arms of [[imperialism|imperialists]]". He called the leaders of the rebellion "the agents of [[West Germany]] and [[fascist]] reactionary rabble."<ref>{{cite web | last = Castro | first = Fidel | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = 1968 | month = August | url = http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/castro/1968/19680824 | title = Castro comments on Czechoslovakia crisis | work = | pages = | publisher = FBIS| accessdate =}}</ref> In return for his public backing of the invasion, at a time when some Soviet allies were deeming the invasion an infringement of Czechoslovakia's sovereignty, the Soviets bailed out the Cuban economy with extra loans and an immediate increase in oil exports.

The relationship between the Soviet Union's KGB and the Cuban [[Intelligence Directorate]] was complex and marked by times of extremely close cooperation and times of extreme competition. The Soviet Union saw the new revolutionary government in Cuba as an excellent proxy agent in areas of the world where Soviet involvement was not popular on a local level. Nikolai Leninov, the KGB Chief in [[Mexico City]], was one of the first Soviet officials to recognize [[Fidel Castro]]'s potential as a revolutionary and urged the Soviet Union to strengthen ties with the new Cuban leader. Moscow saw Cuba as having far more appeal with new revolutionary movements, western intellectuals, and members of the [[New Left]] with Cuba's perceived [[Goliath (Bible)|David and Goliath]] struggle against [[US imperialism]]. Shortly after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1963, Moscow invited 1,500 DI agents, including [[Che Guevara]], to the KGB's [[Moscow Center]] for intensive training in intelligence operations.

After the [[Cuban revolution|revolution]] of 1959, Cuba soon took actions inimical to American trade interests on the island. In response, the U.S. stopped buying Cuban sugar and refused to supply its former trading partner with much needed oil. Relations between the countries deteriorated rapidly. In April 1961, following air attacks preparing for the [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] by CIA-trained [[Cuban exile]]s, prime minister Fidel Castro declared Cuba to be a [[socialist republic]], and moved quickly to develop the growing relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union.

In 1962, Cuba was expelled from the [[Organization of American States]] – Thereafter, many nations throughout Latin America broke ties with Cuba.

Following the establishment of diplomatic ties, and after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1962, Cuba became increasingly dependent on Soviet markets and military and economic aid. Cuba was able to build a large military force with the help of Soviet equipment and military advisors. The Soviets also kept in close touch with Havana, sharing varying close relations until the collapse of the bloc in 1990.

===Russia===
See [[Cuba–Russia relations]]

Relations between the two countries suffered somewhat during the [[Boris Yeltsin]] administration, as Cuba was forced to look for new major allies, such as China, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Relations improved when [[Vladimir Putin]] was elected as the new Russian President. Putin, and later [[Dmitry Medvedev]], emphasized re-establishing strong relations with old Soviet allies. In 2008, Medvedev visited Havana and [[Raúl Castro]] made a week long trip to Moscow. In that same year the two governments signed multiple economic agreements and Russia sent tons of humanitarian aid to Cuba. Cuba, meanwhile, gave staunch political support for Russia during the [[2008 South Ossetia war]]. Relations between the two nations are currently at a post-Soviet high, and talks about potentially re-establishing a Russian military presence in Cuba are even beginning to surface.

====Relations in Latin America and Africa during the Cold War====
{{quote|"Cuba has a unique symbolic allure. It is the small country that confronted the U.S. empire and has survived despite the attempts by all U.S. presidents since to subdue its communist government.

During the cold war, Cuba's influence in the Americas was inhibited by the [[Monroe Doctrine]] and the dominance of the United States.<ref name="foreignaffairs">[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19870601faessay7856/pamela-s-falk/cuba-in-africa.html Cuba in Africa] Foreign Affairs magazine 1987</ref> Despite this Fidel Castro became an influential figurehead for leftist groups in the region, extending support to Marxist Revolutionary movements throughout Latin America, most notably aiding the [[Sandinista]]s in overthrowing [[Somoza]] in [[Nicaragua]] in 1979. In 1971, Fidel Castro took a month-long visit to [[Chile]]. The visit, in which Castro participated actively in the internal politics of the country, holding massive rallies and giving public advice to [[Salvador Allende]], was seen by those on the political right as proof to support their view that "The Chilean Way to Socialism" was an effort to put Chile on the same path as Cuba.<ref>{{cite book|last=Quirk|first=Robert|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=|year=1995|month=August|url=|title=Fidel Castro|work=|pages=|publisher=W.

Cuba's intervention in Africa, which began in the mid-1970s, was more substantial leading to involvement in 17 African nations and three African insurgencies soon leading Cuban soldiers engaging in frontline military combat.<ref name="foreignaffairs"/> In doing so Castro aligned Cuba with African insurgencies against colonial vestiges and specifically against South Africa.<ref name="foreignaffairs"/> By providing military aid Cuba won trading partners for the Soviet bloc and potential converts to [[Marxism]].<ref name="foreignaffairs"/>

On November 4, 1975, Castro ordered the deployment of Cuban troops to [[Angola]] to aid the Marxist [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola|MPLA]] government against [[UNITA]] forces, which were being supported by the [[People's Republic of China]], and later the United States, [[Israel]], and South Africa (see: [[Cuba in Angola]]). After two months on their own, Moscow aided the Cuban mission with the USSR engaging in a massive airlift of Cuban forces into Angola. On this, [[Nelson Mandela]] is said to have remarked "Cuban internationalists have done so much for African independence, freedom, and justice."<ref>{{cite web|last=Mandela|first=Nelson|date=|url=http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela|title=Attributed quotes of Nelson Mandela|publisher=Wikiquote.org|accessdate=2006-05-11}}</ref> Cuban troops were also sent to Marxist [[Ethiopia]] to assist Ethiopian forces in the [[Ogaden War]] with Somalia in 1977. Cuba sent troops along with the Soviet Union to aid the [[Mozambican Liberation Front|FRELIMO]] and MPLA governments in [[Mozambique]] and Angola, respectively, while they were fighting U.S. and South African-backed insurgent groups [[Mozambican National Resistance|RENAMO]] (supported by [[Rhodesia]] as well) and [[National Union for Total Independence of Angola|UNITA]]. He also aided the government of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] in Ethiopia during its conflict with [[Somalia]].

Cuban troops were also sent to Marxist [[Ethiopia]] to assist Ethiopian forces in the Ogaden War with Somalia in 1977. In addition, Castro extended support to [[Marxist]] Revolutionary movements throughout Latin America, such as aiding the [[Sandinista]]s in overthrowing the [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle|Somoza]] government in [[Nicaragua]] in 1979. It has been claimed by the [[Carthage Foundation]]-funded Center for a Free Cuba<ref>{{cite web |date=2006-08-25 | url = http://www.mediatransparency.org/recipientgrants.php?recipientID=1892 | title = Recipient Grants: Center for a Free Cuba | accessdate = 2006-08-25 }}</ref> that an estimated 14,000 Cubans were killed in Cuban military actions abroad.<ref name="Grady2005" />

====Post–Cold War relations====
[[Image:Vladimir Putin in Cuba 14-17 December 2000-12.jpg|thumb|right|Fidel Castro with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], December 2000]]
In the post–Cold War environment Cuban support for guerrilla warfare in Latin America has largely subsided, though the Cuban government continued to provide political assistance and support for left leaning groups and parties in the developing Western Hemisphere.

When Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] visited Cuba in 1989, the comradely relationship between Havana and Moscow was strained by Gorbachev's implementation of economic and political reforms in the USSR. "We are witnessing sad things in other socialist countries, very sad things", lamented Castro in November 1989, in reference to the changes that were sweeping such communist allies as the Soviet Union, [[East Germany]], Hungary, and Poland.<ref>{{cite web |date=1989-11-09 | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r101:S17NO9-1592: | title = Castro Laments 'Very Sad Things' in Bloc |publisher = Washington Post |accessdate = 2006-05-22 }}</ref> The subsequent [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 had an immediate and devastating effect on Cuba.

Cuba today works with a growing bloc of Latin American politicians opposed to the "[[Washington consensus]]", the American-led doctrine that [[free trade]], open markets, and [[privatization]] will lift poor third world countries out of economic stagnation. The Cuban government have condemned [[neoliberalism]] as a destructive force in the developing world, creating an alliance with Presidents [[Hugo Chávez]] of [[Venezuela]] and [[Evo Morales]] of [[Bolivia]] in opposing such policies.<ref>Reel, Monte.

Currently, Cuba has diplomatically friendly relationships with Presidents [[Hugo Chávez]] of Venezuela, [[Lula da Silva]] of [[Brazil]], and [[Cristina Fernández]] of [[Argentina]], with Chávez as perhaps his staunchest ally in the post-Soviet era. Cuba has sent thousands of teachers and medical personnel to Venezuela to assist Chávez's [[socialism|socialist]] oriented economic programs. Chávez, in turn provides Cuba with lower priced petroleum. Cuba's debt for oil to Venezuela is believed to be on the order of one billion US dollars.<ref>[http://havanajournal.com/business_comments/A1221_0_4_0_M/ ]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref>

==Relations with Caribbean Community (CARICOM)==

To celebrate ties between the Caribbean Community and Cuba in 2002 the Heads of Government of Cuba and CARICOM have designated the day of December 8 to be called 'CARICOM-Cuba Day'.<ref>[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/2004/12/07/sanders.htm Caribbean Net News: CARICOM-Cuba Day: 8 December – A time for Celebration]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref> The day is the exact date of the formal opening of diplomatic relations between the first CARICOM-four and Cuba.

In December 2005, during the second CARICOM/CUBA summit held in Barbados, heads of CARICOM and Cuba agreed to deepen their ties in the areas of socio-economic and political cooperation in addition to medical care assistance. Since the meeting, Cuba has opened four additional embassies in the Caribbean Community including: [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Dominica]], [[Suriname]], and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]. This development makes Cuba the only nation to have embassies in all independent countries of the Caribbean Community.<ref>[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000008/000823.htm Caribbean Net News: Cuba opens more Caribbean embassies]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref> CARICOM and Canadian politicians<ref>[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/pres21_98.htm New focus on CARICOM/Canada relations]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref> have jointly maintained that through the International inclusion of Cuba, a more positive change might indeed be brought about there (politically) as has been witnessed in the [[People's Republic of China]].

Cuban cooperation with the Caribbean was extended by a joint health programme between Cuba and Venezuela named [[Healthcare of Cuba#Operación Milagro|Operación Milagro]], set up in 2005. The initiative is part of the Sandino commitment, which sees both countries coming together with the aim of offering free ophthalmology operations to an estimated 4.5 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean over a ten-year period.<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/health.cfm?id=2305142005 Havana's Operation Miracle helps eye patients see light] News.

Leaders included Prime Minister [[Kenny Anthony]] of [[St. Lucia]] who announced: "We pray for President Castro and we wish him God's blessings".<ref name="Caribbean"/> [[Grenada]]n Prime Minister [[Keith Mitchell]] stated "Cuba has been a long-standing friend to the entire Caribbean", and Trinidad Prime Minister Patrick Manning issued a statement extending Castro his "best wishes for a prompt recovery."<ref name="Caribbean"/> Additionally the Cuban-Barbadian Friendship Association (CBFA) and the social movement known as the [[Clement Payne Movement]] also extended a press release stating "We will lead the process for all progressive organisations in Barbados to hold a solidarity meeting with the government and people of the Republic of Cuba on August 13 at the Clement Payne Cultural Centre". Both organizations stated they would be planning to send a delegation to Cuba to celebrate with Fidel Castro his 80th birthday, in addition to the annual observance on October 6 of [[Cubana Flight 455]] which was bombed off the coast of Barbados in 1976 via a [[CIA]]-linked plot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationnews.com/story/341433360958481.php |title=The Nation Newspaper &#124; Get-well wishes for Castro |publisher=Nationnews.com |date=2010-05-15 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref>

==Americas==
Cuba has supported a number of leftist groups and parties in Latin America and the Caribbean since the 1959 revolution. In the 1960s Cuba established close ties with the emerging [[Guatemala]]n social movement led by Luis Augusto Turcios Lima, and supported the establishment of the [[Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity|URNG]], a militant organization that has evolved into one of Guatemala's current political parties. In the 1980s Cuba backed both the [[Sandinistas]] in [[Nicaragua]] and the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front|FMLN]] in [[El Salvador]], providing military and intelligence training, weapons, guidance, and organizational support.

===Canada===
{{Main|Canada–Cuba relations}}

[[Canada]] has always maintained consistently cordial relations with Cuba, in spite of considerable pressure from the United States, and the island is also one of the most popular travel destinations for Canadian citizens. Canada-Cuba relations can be traced back to the 18th century, when vessels from the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]] of Canada traded codfish and beer for rum and sugar. Cuba was the first country in the Caribbean selected by Canada for a diplomatic mission. Official diplomatic relations were established in 1945, when Emile Vaillancourt, a noted writer and historian, was designated Canada's representative in Cuba. Canada and Mexico were the only two countries in the hemisphere to maintain uninterrupted diplomatic relations with Cuba following the Cuban Revolution in 1959.

<!--  Commented out: [[Image:Castro-Trudeau 1976 - LAC PA136976.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Castro and Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]].]] -->
In 1994, a joint venture was formed between the Cuban Nickel Union and the Canadian firm [[Sherritt International]], which operates a mining and processing plant on the island in [[Moa, Cuba|Moa]]. A second enterprise, Cobalt Refinery Co. Inc., was created in Alberta for nickel refining. Canada has been critical of the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba, and strongly objected to the [[Helms-Burton Act]]. In 1996 Foreign Affairs Minister [[Lloyd Axworthy]] stated: "Canada shares the U.S. objectives of improving human rights standards and moving to more representative government in Cuba. But we are concerned that the Helms-Burton Act takes the wrong approach. That is why we have been working with other countries to uphold the principles of international law". In 1996 a [[Private Member's Bill]] was introduced, but not made law, in the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]]; this law called the [[Godfrey–Milliken Bill]] was in response to the extraterritoriality of the aforementioned Act.

Former Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] and [[Fidel Castro]] were personal friends. Castro was among Pierre Trudeau's pallbearers at [[State funeral of Pierre Trudeau|his funeral]] in 2000. Former Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] and Fidel Castro also maintained a close relationship.

Cuba has been since the 1960s a reference point to [[left wing]] politicians in '''[[Chile]]'''. Recently relations to Cuba has been hot subject in [[Concert of Parties for Democracy|Concertación]] politics since the [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile]], member of the Concertación, has supported a  harder line in the diplomatic relations with Cuba while the [[Socialist Party of Chile]] has opposed this.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In 1971, despite an [[Organization of American States]] convention that no nation in the Western Hemisphere would have a relationship with Cuba (the only exception being Mexico, which had refused to adopt that convention), Castro took a month-long visit to Chile, following the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba. The visit, in which Castro participated actively in the internal politics of the country, holding massive rallies and giving public advice to [[Salvador Allende]], was seen by those on the political right as proof to support their view that "The Chilean Way to Socialism" was an effort to put Chile on the same path as Cuba.<ref>{{cite book | last = Quirk | first = Robert | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = 1995 | month = August | url = | title = Fidel Castro | work = | pages = | publisher = W.

Cuba gave training, money, medicines, weapons and safe haven to members of [[Colombian people|Colombian]] guerrilla movements, especially to the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] and also to members of the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]], both of which were founded in the early 1960s. In recent years, Fidel Castro has made gestures of reconciliation with different Colombian government administrations, and has been considered responsible for facilitating talks between them and the opposing guerrilla groups.

===Costa Rica===
[[Costa Rica]] broke relations with Cuba in 1961 to protest Cuban support of the left in Central America and renewed formal diplomatic ties with Fidel Castro's government in March 2009. In 1995, Costa Rica established a [[consular office]] in [[Havana]]. Cuba opened a consular office in Costa Rica in 2001, but relations continued to be difficult. In 2006, shortly after the death of [[Augusto Pinochet]], Costa Rican President [[Óscar Arias]] compared Fidel Castro's human rights record to that of the former Chilean president. In response, Cuban officials released a statement describing the Washington aligned Arias as a "vulgar mercenary" of U.S. officials, and asserting that Washington "always had on hand another opportunistic clown ready to follow its aggressive plans against Cuba."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mlive.com/newsflash/international/index.ssf?/base/international-10/11672682008600.xml&storylist=international |title=Cuba slams Costa Rican leader's remarks |agency= Associated Press }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://granmai.cubaweb.com/ingles/2006/diciembre/mier27/01decla.html | title = Statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Oscar Arias: Vain, mediocre and obsessed with being a star | publisher = Granma | accessdate = 2000-12-31 }}</ref>

===El Salvador===
Cuba and [[El Salvador]] resumed diplomatic relations on June 1, 2009. El Salvador previously suspended diplomatic relations with Cuba 50 years ago due to the Cuban Revolution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jdUQFbECZYRXiqkl75Rzs3cPsH6w |title=El Salvador and Cuba reestablish diplomatic ties |publisher=Google.com |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref> Diplomatic ties were resumed after El Salvador's new president [[Mauricio Funes]], who had pledged to reestablish them, was sworn into office. El Salvador is also the very last Latin American nation to resume diplomatic relations with Cuba.

===Mexico===

Before the Cuban revolution, [[Mexico]] was the country where several Cubans were exiled fleeing political persecution by the government of Batista like [[Julio Antonio Mella]], Juan Marinello, [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Raúl Castro]].

After the Cuban revolution when Cuba was expelled from the [[Organization of American States]], Mexico did not support this resolution and abstained, claiming a non-intervention policy. Relations were stable from 1934 to 1998.

Although the relationship between Cuba and Mexico remains strained, each side appears to make attempts to improve it. In 1998, Fidel Castro apologized when he said that "Mexican kids knew Mickey Mouse better than national heroes of their own country", which led Mexico to recall its ambassador from Havana.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~fcf/castroapologizes.html |title=Castro apologizes to Mexico's kids for put-down |publisher=.fiu.edu |date=1998-12-19 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref> Rather, he said, his words were meant to underscore the cultural dominance of the US.<ref>{{cite news |date=1998-12-19 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/238827.stm | title = Castro says sorry to Mexico | publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 2006-05-21 | location=London}}</ref> 

Mexican president [[Vicente Fox]] apologized to Fidel Castro in 2002 over statements by Castro, who had taped their telephone conversation, to the effect that Fox forced him to leave a United Nations summit in Mexico so that he would not be in the presence of President Bush, who also attended.<ref>{{cite news |date=2002-04-25 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1946089.stm | title = Mexico's Fox apologises to Castro | publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 2006-05-21 | location=London}}</ref>

In 2004, Mexico suspended relations with Cuba after businessman [[Carlos Ahumada]] was arrested and deported to Mexico and the paperwork provided by the Cuban government proved that there was a plan from the Mexican government to make a complot against the potential presidential candidate from the opposition party [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]]. 

In April 2012, Mexican president [[Felipe Calderón]] made a two-day visit to [[Havana]].

===Nicaragua===
Cuba developed close relations with the 1979 [[Sandinista]] government in [[Nicaragua]] (having supported the Sandinista insurgency against Anastasio Somoza's rule).  Cuba proved to be the organization's chief international ally in the civil war against the U.S.-backed [[Contra (guerrillas)|Contras]].  Cuba transported weapons to [[Panama]].  From Panama, the Cuban weapons would be taken through Costa Rica to Nicaragua.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Cuba continues to have close relations with the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]], since being re-elected in 2006 for the first time since 1984, they are again the governing party of Nicaragua.

===Panama===
Cuba and [[Panama]] have restored diplomatic ties after breaking them off in 2004 when Panama's former president [[Mireya Moscoso]] pardoned four Cuban included [[Luis Posada Carriles]] accused of attempting to assassinate Cuban President Fidel Castro.

Relations between Cuba and [[Venezuela]] significantly improved during the [[Presidency of Hugo Chávez]].

Venezuelan president [[Hugo Chávez]] was a close ally of Fidel Castro, and described the Fidel Castro–Hugo Chávez–[[Evo Morales]] relationship as an "[[Axis of good]]". Chávez's formulation is a play on the "[[axis of evil]]" phrase used by President Bush when describing governments such as those of [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], and [[North Korea]] in his 2002 State of the Union Address. The [[Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela]] has agreed to barter Venezuelan oil, in exchange for Cuban medical assistance.

On December 15, 2004, an agreement called the ALBA ([[Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas]]) was signed to eliminate tariffs and import duties and promote investment as well as technical and educational cooperation between the two countries. Venezuela and Cuba have been close trading partners since a cooperative agreement was signed between them on October 30, 2000. The new agreement meant that Cuban goods and services were to be paid for with Venezuela products and currency. Venezuela will transfer technology, finance development projects in the agriculture, service, energy and infrastructures sectors. Cuba, in addition to providing over 15,000 medical professionals who participate in [[Barrio Adentro]], a social program which provides [[healthcare of Cuba|Cuban healthcare]] treatment to Venezuelans and trains doctors and specialists, will grant 2,000 annual scholarships to Venezuelan students. Also, the agreement commits the two countries to work together with other Latin American countries to fight [[illiteracy]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Wagner |first=Sarah |url=http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/news.php?newsno=1447 |title=Venezuela and Cuba Sign New Cooperation Agreements |publisher=Venezuelanalysis.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref>

In 2005 the two countries also signed cooperation agreements in the area of energy and electricity, an accord between Venezuela's oil company [[PDVSA]] and its Cuban counterpart [[Cupet]] to buy and sell crude oil and a crude oil storage agreement between the two companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bilaterals.org/article.php3?id_article=1835 |title=Cuba and Venezuela sign millionaire bilateral trade agreement |publisher=Bilaterals.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref>

Hugo Chávez, who said he was one of the few people in the world who knew Castro's illness from July 31, 2006, helped Cuba undermine a strict U.S. embargo by sending cheap oil and boosting commercial relations. Agreements between Cuba and Venezuela, the world's No. 5 oil exporter, have brought more than 20,000 Cuban doctors to Venezuela to provide medical services for the poor. The program, one of numerous oil-funded social projects, helped Chávez build a strong political support base, and he won a reelection bid in December 2006.<ref name=reuters-09-03>{{cite news|title=Castro recovering and giving orders: Chavez|date=2006-09-03

A White House point man on plans for a post-Castro transition, Caleb McCarry, recently told The Miami Herald that U.S. estimates of total Venezuelan subsidies to Cuba per year "are up to the $2 billion figure." This is comparable to the $4 billion to $6 billion that the Soviet Union once pumped into Cuba per year.<ref>[http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/world/cuba/15395148.htm ]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref>

===United States===
{{Main|Cuba–United States relations}}

Since the [[Cuban revolution]] of 1959 relations deteriorated substantially and have subsequently been marked by tension and confrontations. The United States does not have formal diplomatic relations with Cuba and has maintained an [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]] which makes it illegal for U.S. corporations to do business with Cuba. This includes travel restrictions. These measures were further strengthened by the implementation by the U.S. of the [[Helms-Burton Act]] of 1996 which attempted to punish any foreign companies operating in Cuba, especially those using expropriated US assets. US diplomatic representation in Cuba is handled by the [[United States Interests Section in Havana]], and a similar "Cuban Interests Section" remains in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Both are officially part of the respective embassies of [[Switzerland]].

===Angola===
{{Main|Angola–Cuba relations}}
Angola-Cuba diplomatic relations are, for [[Angola]], second only to [[Angola-United States relations|relations with the United States]]. During [[Angola's civil war]], Cuban forces fought to install a Marxist-Leninist MPLA-PT government; against [[Western world|Western]]-backed [[UNITA]] and [[National Liberation Front of Angola|FLNA]] guerrillas and an invading army of the [[South African]] [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] state. For the time being South African forces were repelled though the UNITA insurgency continued; eventually Cuban forces withdrew from the country, especially as Cuba faced tremendous economic difficulties as a result of the Soviet Union's collapse. The outcome of Cuban withdrawal and the peace accords resulted in the MPLA changing from a Marxist-Leninist party to a Multi-Party Democratic system based on [[free market]] principles (the MPLA also dropped the "PT" extension to their name as a clear sign of dropping their Communist aspirations).  From an economic stand point, Cuba has lost its preferred status among Angolans and South Africa has become the biggest single investor and trading partner with Angola (outside of oil sales).

===Namibia===
 {{main|Cuba–Namibia relations}}
Cuban-Namibian relations began during the [[Namibian War of Independence]] when Cuba politically, militarily and diplomatically supported the [[Namibia]]n rebel organization and future ruling party, [[South West Africa People's Organization]] (SWAPO) against the [[Military of South Africa|military]] of [[Apartheid]] South Africa.<ref name="radiohc.cu">[http://www.radiohc.cu/ingles/noticias/julio05/5julio/cuba7.htm Cuba-Namibia Joint Commission Meeting Kicks off in Havana], Radio Habana, Cuba, 5 July 2005</ref> Since independence, Namibia and Cuba have held joint meetings every two years for Economic, Scientific-Technical and Commercial Cooperation.

==Europe==

===European Union===
{{Main|Cuba–European Union relations}}
[[European Union]] (EU) relations with Cuba are governed by the Common Position, as approved by the [[European Council of Ministers]] in 1996, which is updated every six months following regular evaluations. According to the Common Position "the objective of the European Union in its relations with Cuba is to encourage a process of transition to a pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people". Cuba rejects the Common Position as interference in its internal affairs. There is an EU Delegation in Havana that works under the responsibility of the EC Delegation in [[Santo Domingo]], [[Dominican Republic]].

Cuba benefits from the GPS (Generalized Preference System) preferential treatment for its exports. Furthermore, Cuba does not benefit from the ACP-EU Sugar Protocol but from a sugar quota granted by the EU (some 59,000 tonnes per year; duty paid on this quota is EUR 98/t).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/comm/development/body/country/country_home_en.cfm?cid=cu&status=new |title=European Union – EEAS (European External Action Service) &#124; Countries / Territories |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref>

Both nations are part of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and Cuba has repeatedly called for a more "democratic" representation of the United Nations Security Council, supporting India's candidacy for permanent membership on a reformed Security Council.<ref>http://www.indembassyhavana.org/?q=en/node/9</ref> [[Fidel Castro]] had said that  “The maturity of India…, its unconditional adherence to the principles which lay at the foundation of the Non-Aligned Movement give us the assurances that under the wise leadership of [[Indira Gandhi]] (the former [[Prime Minister of India]]), the non-aligned countries will continue advancing in their inalienable role as a bastion for peace, national independence and development…"

India provided Cuba with 10,000 tonnes of wheat and 10,000 tonnes of rice in 1992 when Cuba was undergoing hardship.Fidel Castro termed the donation as the “Bread of India” because it was sufficient for one loaf of bread for each one of the then Cuban population of eleven million people.<ref>http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2708/stories/20100423270805500.htm</ref>
India also provided donations worth two million dollars during the Cuban earthquake.<ref>http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/cuba/india-04.htm</ref>

India has an embassy in Havana, the capital of Cuba which had opened in January 1960. This had particular significance as it symbolised Indian solidarity with the Cuban revolution.<ref>http://www.cubaminrex.cu/english/currentissues/Excellent%20Relations%20Between.htm</ref> India had been one of the first countries in the world to have recognised the new Cuban government after the [[Cuban Revolution]]<ref>http://mea.gov.in/mystart.php?id=50049866</ref> Cuba has an embassy in [[New Delhi]], the Indian capital.<ref>http://www.cubadiplomatica.cu/india/EN/</ref>

===Pakistan===
{{Main|Cuba–Pakistan relations}}

The relations between the two countries strengthened after Cuba provided humanitarian assistance to the victims of the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]]. Both nations continue to strengthen the bilateral relations especially in the fields of higher education, agriculture, industry and science and technology and have also held talks for military cooperation.

In March 2008, ambassador Gustavo Machin Gomez met Gen. [[Tariq Majid]], the [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (Pakistan)|Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC)]] at Joint Staff Headquarters and discussed issues related to military cooperation. Both of them expressed positive views over the increasing relations between the two nations and were optimistic that the bilateral cooperation will expand in different fields. Majid stressed that Pakistan has formed strong defence infrastructure both in defence production and in shape of military academies to provide help and cooperation to the [[Military of Cuba]]. He also said that both countries should use their capacity for expanding military cooperation.

In an interview with Overseas Pakistani Friends, Machin Gomez suggested further ways that Cuba and Pakistan might be able to help each other.<ref>http://www.opfblog.com/7087/interview-of-honorable-gustavo-machin-gomez-ambssador-of-cuba-in-pakistan/</ref>

===Philippines===
{{see also|Foreign relations of the Philippines}}
Like Cuba, [[the Philippines]] was once a [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish possession]], and Spanish rule in both colonies ended with the victory of the United States in the [[Spanish-American War]]. Provisions in the subsequent 1898 [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] gave Cuba independence while giving the Philippine Islands over to [[American Colonial Period (Philippines)|American control]], which was gradually lessened until the country achieved full sovereignty on 4 July 1946. 

Cuba currently maintains an embassy in [[Manila]], and the Philippines has an embassy in [[Havana]]. Despite the Philippines being a long-time [[Philippines-United States relations|ally]] of the United States, it has denounced the [[United States embargo against Cuba|American sanctions]] against Cuba.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/349064/cuba-thanks-philippines-support |title=Cuba thanks Philippines for support &#124; The Manila Bulletin Newspaper Online |publisher=Mb.com.ph |date=2001-06-08 |accessdate=2012-06-02}}</ref> Among common cultural touchstones between the two countries is the similar design of their national flags, the [[Flag of the Philippines|Philippine flag]] having been influenced by the [[Flag of Cuba|Cuban flag]] in its appearance and some of its symbolism.

===South Korea===
There is no official-level diplomatic relation between Cuba and [[South Korea]]. Despite this, there has been unofficial interactions in the economic level between the two countries. For instance, South Korea's [[Hyundai Heavy Industries]] sent PPS mobile generators to Cuba for the country's power grids. The picture of PPS were later incorporated into the 10 [[Cuban convertible peso]] banknote.<ref>{{cite news | first = Ji-eun | last = Seo | title = ‘Viva Hyundai’ on a Cuban bill | date = 2007-01-30 | url = http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2871887 | work = Joongang Daily | accessdate = 2011-07-28}}</ref>

===Vietnam===
{{Main|Cuba–Vietnam relations}}
Diplomatic relations between the two countries was established in December 1960. Since then, Vietnam has become Cuba's second-largest trading partner in Asia, with Vietnam trailing behind China. Vietnam, just as Cuba is, is a [[socialist state]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.china.org.cn/world/2012-07/06/content_25840216.htm | title = Cuban leader Raul Castro to visit Vietnam | accessdate = 13 October 2012 | date = 6 July 2012 | publisher = [[Xinhua]].

===Organization of American States===
{{Main|Cuban relations with the Organization of American States}}
Cuba was formerly excluded from participation in the [[Organization of American States]] under a decision adopted by the Eighth Meeting of Consultation in [[Punta del Este]], [[Uruguay]], on 21 January 1962. The resolution stated that as Cuba had officially identified itself as a Marxist-Leninist government, is was incompatible with "the principles and objectives of the inter-American system."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidh.oas.org/countryrep/Cuba79eng/intro.htm |title=Cuba 1979 – Introduction |publisher=Cidh.oas.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref> This stance was frequently questioned by some member states. This situation came to an end on 3 June 2009, when foreign ministers assembled in [[San Pedro Sula]], [[Honduras]], for the OAS's 39th [[General Assembly of the Organization of American States|General Assembly]], passed a vote to lift Cuba's suspension from the OAS. In its resolution ([http://www.oas.org/consejo/sp/AG/ag04632e01.doc AG/RES 2438]), the General Assembly decided that:
#Resolution VI, [...] which excluded the Government of Cuba from its participation in the Inter-American system, hereby ceases to have effect
#The participation of the Republic of Cuba in the OAS will be the result of a process of dialogue initiated at the request of the Government of Cuba, and in accordance with the practices, purposes, and principles of the OAS.

The reincorporation of Cuba as an active member had arisen regularly as a topic within the inter-American system (e.g., it was intimated by the outgoing ambassador of Mexico in 1998)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/OASpage/press2002/en/Press98/020498ce.htm |title=Mexico Calls for Cuba's Reinstatement into the |publisher=OAS |date=1998-02-04 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref> but most observers did not see it as a serious possibility while the Socialist government remained in power. On 6 May 2005, [[President of Cuba|President]] Fidel Castro reiterated that the island nation would not "be part of a disgraceful institution that has only humiliated the honor of Latin American nations".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B2355B35C-068E-4DFE-879E-3E8836A38EA4%7D&language=EN |title=Fidel Castro: OAS Is an Instrument of the US – Prensa Latina |publisher=Plenglish.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref>

In an editorial published by ''[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]]'', Fidel Castro applauded the Assembly's "rebellious" move and said that the date would "be recalled by future generations."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2009/junio/mier3/Reflections-2june.html |title=The Trojan horse |author=Fidel Castro |work=[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]] |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2009-06-04}}</ref> However, a Declaration of the Revolutionary Government dated 8 June 2009 stated that while Cuba welcomed the Assembly's gesture, in light of the Organization's historical record  "Cuba will not return to the OAS".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2009/junio/lun8/Declaration.html |title=Declaration of the Revolutionary Government |work=[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]] |date=2009-06-08 |accessdate=2009-06-15}}</ref>

Cuba joined the [[Latin American Integration Association]] becoming the tenth member (out of 12) on 26 August 1999. The organization was set up in 1980 to encourage trade integration association. Its main objective is the establishment of a common market, in pursuit of the economic and social development of the region.

On September 15, 2006, Cuba officially took over leadership of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] during the 14th summit of the organization in Havana.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=2448962&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 |title=ABC News: ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref>

==Cuban intervention abroad: 1959 – Early 1990s==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2006}}

Aided by a massive buildup of Soviet advisors, military personnel, and advanced weaponry during the Cold War, Cuba became a staunch ally of the USSR during Castro's rule, modeling its political structure after that of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]]. Due to this huge amount of support, Cuba became a major sponsor of Marxist "wars of national liberation" not only in Latin America, but worldwide.

===Black Panthers===
In the 1960s and 1970s, Cuba openly supported the black nationalist and Marxist-oriented [[Black Panther Party]] of the U.S. Many members found their way into Cuba for political asylum, where Cuba welcomed them after they had been convicted of crimes in the U.S.

===Palestinians===
Cuba has also lent support to [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] groups against [[Israel]]. Fidel Castro claims Israel practices "[[Zionism|Zionist]] Fascism." Cuba has also lent support to the prominent [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and the lesser-known [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) both received training from Cuba's General Intelligence Directorate, as well as financial and diplomatic support from the Cuban government.

In 2010, Castro indicated that he strongly supported Israel's right to exist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gTESm0GlM9yQizdmGzrIOoEGdq0w |title=AFP: Fidel Castro firmly backs Israel's right to exist: report |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-09-22 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref>

===Irish Republicans===
The [[Irish Republican]] political party, [[Sinn Féin]] is also known to have close political links to the Cuban government. In the past Fidel Castro has expressed support for the Irish Republican cause of a [[United Ireland]]. The Cuban government supported and still supports the Republican cause, but opposed the attacks which took place on civilian targets by Sinn Féin's military ally, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] and of course attacks on civilians by their [[Ulster loyalist|loyalist]] enemies such as the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] and [[Ulster Defence Association]].

==Humanitarian aid==
{{see also|Cuban medical internationalism}}
Since the establishment of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba in 1959, the country has sent more than 52,000 medical workers abroad to work in needy countries, including countries affected by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] and the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-236/0607178261185837.htm |title=خطای نابهنگام |publisher=Irna.ir |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref> There are currently about 20,000 Cuban doctors working in 68 countries across three continents, including a 135-strong medical team in [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4792071.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cuba doctors popular in quake-stricken Java | date=2006-08-18 | accessdate=2010-05-02 | first=Tom | last=Fawthrop}}</ref>

==US Accusations of supporting terrorism==
The [[State Sponsors of Terrorism|U.S. list of state sponsors of international terrorism]] includes Cuba. According to the US, the Cuban Government has taken no action against [[al-Qaida]] or other terrorist groups.
