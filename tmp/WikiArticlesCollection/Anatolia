'''Anatolia''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ἀνατολή}}, ''{{lang|gr-Latn|Anatolḗ}}'' — "east" or "(sun)rise"), also known as '''Asia Minor''' (from {{Lang-el|Μικρὰ Ἀσία}} ''{{lang|gr-Latn|Mīkrá Asía}}'' ("small Asia"); in modern {{Lang-tr|Anadolu|links=no}}), '''Asian Turkey''', '''Anatolian peninsula''', '''Anatolian plateau''', denotes the westernmost protrusion of [[Asia]], which makes up the majority of the [[Republic of Turkey]].<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Anatolia.aspx "Anatolia comprises more than 95 percent of Turkey's total land area."]</ref> The region is bounded by the [[Black Sea]] to the north, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south, and the [[Aegean Sea]] to the west. The [[Sea of Marmara]] forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the [[Bosphorus]] and [[Dardanelles]] straits and separates Anatolia from [[Thrace]] on the [[Europe]]an mainland. Traditionally, Anatolia is considered to extend in the east to a line between the [[Gulf of İskenderun]] and the Black Sea, approximately corresponding to the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey. However, since Anatolia is now often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey, its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be the [[Turkey|Turkish]] borders with the neighboring countries, which are [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], and [[Syria]], in clockwise direction.

The Anatolian peninsula, also called Asia Minor, is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south, the [[Aegean Sea]] to the west, and the Sea of Marmara to the northwest, which separates Anatolia from Thrace in Europe.

Traditionally, Anatolia is considered to extend in the east to an indefinite line running from the [[Gulf of İskenderun]] to the Black Sea, coterminous with the Anatolian Plateau. This traditional geographical definition is used, for example, in the latest edition of ''[[Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary]]'',<ref name=Merriam/> as well as the archeological community.<ref name="Mitchell"/> Under this definition, Anatolia is bounded to the East by the [[Armenian Highland]], and the [[Euphrates]] before that river bends to the southeast to enter [[Mesopotamia]].<ref name="Mitchell"/> To the southeast, it is bounded by the ranges that separate it from the Orontes valley in [[Syria (region)]] and the Mesopotamian plain.<ref name="Mitchell"/>

However, following the [[History of the Republic of Turkey|establishment of the Republic of Turkey]], Anatolia was defined by the Turkish government as being effectively co-terminous with Asian Turkey. Turkey's [[First Geography Congress, Turkey|First Geography Congress]] in 1941 created two [[geographical regions of Turkey|regions]] to the east of the Gulf of Iskenderun-Black Sea line named the [[Eastern Anatolia Region]] and the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region]],<ref name="Yigit">Ali Yiğit, "Geçmişten Günümüze Türkiye'yi Bölgelere Ayıran Çalışmalar ve Yapılması Gerekenler", ''Ankara Üniversitesi Türkiye Coğrafyası Araştırma ve Uygulama Merkezi, IV.

This wider definition of Anatolia has gained widespread currency outside of Turkey and has, for instance, been adopted by ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22897/Anatolia |title=Anatolia |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> and other encyclopedic and general reference publications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Anatolia.aspx |title=''Anatolia'' entries from ''Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa'', ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', and ''A Dictionary of World History''|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The Anatolian peninsula was given the name ''[[:wikt:Asia|Asia]]'' (Ἀσία) by the Greeks,<ref>Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29asi%2Fa Ἀσία], ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> presumably after the name of the [[Assuwa league]] in western Anatolia.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} As the name Asia came to be extended to other areas east of the Mediterranean, the name for Anatolian became specified as Asia Minor ("Lesser Asia", Μικρὰ Ἀσία) in [[Late Antiquity]].

The name ''Anatolia'' comes from the Greek {{lang|grc|Aνατολή}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|Anatolē}}'') meaning the "East" or more literally "sunrise", comparable to the Latin terms "[[Levant]]" or "[[Orient]]" (and words for "east" in other languages).<ref name="etym">{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%237638| author=Henry George Liddell | coauthors=Robert Scott| title=A Greek-English Lexicon}}</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Anatolia Online Etymology Dictionary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The precise reference of this term has varied over time, perhaps originally referring to the [[Ionians|Ionian]] colonies on the west coast of Asia Minor. (The male name [[Anatoly]] or [[Anatole (disambiguation)|Anatole]] shares the same linguistic origin.)

The modern Turkish name of Anatolia is ''Anadolu'', which derives from the Greek name ''Aνατολή'' (''Anatolē''). The oldest known reference to Anatolia, "Land of the [[Hittite empire|Hatti]]", was found for the first time on [[Mesopotamian]] cuneiform tablets from the period of the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2350–2150 BC).{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}. The name  Asia Minor ("Lesser Asia", Μικρὰ Ἀσία) was given by the Greeks in [[Late Antiquity]]. In the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Anatolic Theme]] (Aνατολικόν θέμα) was a ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]]'' covering the western and central parts of Turkey's present-day [[Central Anatolia Region]].<ref name="First Thema 1952, pp. 59">"On the First Thema, called Anatolikon. This theme is called Anatolikon or Theme of the Anatolics  "Aνατολικόν θέμα", not because it is above and in the direction of the east where the sun rises, but because it lies to the East of Byzantium and Europe."

The English-language name ''[[Name of Turkey|Turkey]]'' first appeared c. 1369.<ref name="TurkEtymology">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Turk|title=Turk|first=Douglas|last=Harper|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2011-05-24|year=2001}}</ref> It is derived from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''Turchia'' (meaning "Land of the Turks", Turkish: ''Türkiye''), which was originally used by the Europeans to define the [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]] controlled parts of Anatolia after the [[Battle of Manzikert]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Anatolia}}

===Prehistory and antiquity===
[[File:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations003.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Mural of [[aurochs]], a [[deer]], and humans in [[Çatalhöyük]], which is the largest and best-preserved Neolithic site found to date.It was inscribed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalheritagefund.org/onthewire/blog/catalhoyuk_world_heritage_list |title=Çatalhöyük added to UNESCO World Heritage List |publisher=Global Heritage Fund |date=3 July 2012 |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>]]

Human habitation in Anatolia dates back to the [[Paleolithic]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stiner|first=Mary C.|coauthors=Kuhn, Steven L.; Güleç, Erksin|title=Early Upper Paleolithic shell beads at Üçağızlı Cave I (Turkey): Technology and the socioeconomic context of ornament life-histories|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=64|issue=5|pages=380–398|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2013.01.008|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004724841300016X|issn=0047-2484}}</ref> [[Neolithic]] Anatolia has been also [[Anatolian hypothesis|proposed]] as the [[Urheimat|homeland]] of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]], although linguists tend to favour a [[Kurgan hypothesis|later origin]] in the steppes north of the Black Sea. However, it is clear that the Indo-European [[Anatolian languages]] had been present in Anatolia since at least the 19th century BC.

Eastern Anatolia contains the oldest monumental structures in the world. For example, the monumental structures at [[Göbekli Tepe]] were built by hunters and gatherers a thousand years before the development of agriculture. Eastern Anatolia, alongside [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Levant]], is a heart region for the [[Neolithic Revolution]], one of the earliest areas in which humans domesticated plants and animals. Neolithic sites such as [[Çatalhöyük]], [[Çayönü]], [[Nevalı Çori]] and [[Hacilar]] represent the world's oldest known agricultural towns.

The earliest historical records of Anatolia stem from the southeast of the region and are from the [[Mesopotamia]]-based [[Akkadian Empire]] during the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]] in the 24th century BC. Scholars generally believe the earliest indigenous populations of Anatolia were the [[Hattians]] and [[Hurrians]]. The Hattians spoke a [[Hattic language|language]] of unclear affiliation, and the [[Hurrian language]] belongs to a small family called [[Hurro-Urartian languages|Hurro-Urartian]], all these languages now being extinct; relationships with indigenous [[languages of the Caucasus]] have been proposed<ref>Bryce 2005:12</ref> but are not generally accepted. The region was famous for exporting raw materials, and areas of [[Hittite empire|Hattian]]- and Hurrian-populated southeast Anatolia were colonised by the Akkadians.<ref name="Freeman"/>

[[File:Hattusa.liongate.jpg|thumb|left|The Lion Gate at [[Hattusa]], capital of the [[Hittites|Hittite Empire]]. The city's history dates back to before 2000 BC.]]
After the fall of the Akkadian empire in the mid-21st century BC, the [[Assyrians]], who were the northern branch of the Akkadian people, colonised parts of the region between the 21st and mid-18th centuries BC and claimed the resources, notably [[silver]]. One of the numerous [[cuneiform]] records dated circa 20th century BC, found in Anatolia at the Assyrian colony of [[Kanesh]], uses an advanced system of trading computations and credit lines.<ref name="Freeman">{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Charles|title= Egypt, Greece and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999|isbn=0-19-872194-3}}</ref>

Unlike the [[Semitic]] Akkadians and their descendants, the Assyrians, whose Anatolian possessions were peripheral to their core lands in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Hittites]] were centred at [[Hattusa]] in north-central Anatolia by 2000 BC. They were speakers of an Indo-European language known as the "[[Nesili|language of Nesa]]". Originating from [[Kültepe|Nesa]], they conquered Hattusa in the 18th century BC, imposing themselves over Hattian- and Hurrian-speaking populations.

The Hittites adopted the [[cuneiform]] written script, invented in Mesopotamia. During the Late Bronze Age circa 2000 BC, they created an empire, the [[Hittite New Kingdom]], which reached its height in the 14th century BC, controlling much of Asia Minor. The empire included a large part of Anatolia, northwestern [[Syria]] and northwest upper Mesopotamia. They failed to reach the Anatolian coasts of the Black Sea, however, as another non-Indo-European people, the [[Kaskians]], had established a kingdom there in the 17th century BC, displacing earlier [[Palaic]] speaking Indo-Europeans.<ref>Carruba, O. ''Das Palaische. Texte, Grammatik, Lexikon''. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1970. StBoT 10</ref> Much of the history of the Hittite Empire was concerned with warring with the rival empires of [[Egypt]], [[Assyria]] and the [[Mitanni]].<ref name="Roux">Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq</ref>

[[File:Dalyan - Caunos2.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Lycian rock cut tombs of Kaunos (Dalyan)]]
The [[Mitanni]] Empire was also an Indo-European (and Hurrian)-speaking and Anatolian-based empire. The Mitanni appeared in the 17th century BC and spoke an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] language related to the Indo-European languages eventually to be found in [[India]].<ref>Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 229. Penguin Books, 1966.</ref>

The [[Egyptians]] eventually withdrew from the region after failing to gain the upper hand over the Hittites and becoming wary of the power of Assyria, which had destroyed the Mitanni Empire.<ref name="Roux"/> The Assyrians and Hittites were then left in the field to battle over control over eastern and southern Anatolia and colonial territories in [[Syria]]. The Assyrians had better success than the Egyptians, annexing much Hittite (and Hurrian) territories in these regions.<ref name="Georges Roux 1966">Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq. Penguin Books, 1966.</ref>

After 1180 BC, the Hittite empire [[Bronze Age collapse|disintegrated]] into several independent "[[Neo-Hittite]]" states, subsequent to losing much territory to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] and being finally overrun by the [[Phrygians]], another Indo-European people who are believed to have migrated from the [[Balkans]]. The Phrygian expansion into southeast Anatolia was eventually halted by the Assyrians, who controlled that region.<ref name="Georges Roux 1966"/>

[[File:Anatolia Ancient Regions base.svg|thumb|left|300px|Ancient regions of Anatolia (500 BC)]]
Ancient Anatolia is subdivided by modern scholars into regions named after the Indo-European (and largely Hittite, Luwian or Greek speaking) peoples that occupied them, such as [[Lydia]], [[Lycia]], [[Caria]], [[Mysia]], [[Bithynia]], [[Phrygia]], [[Galatia]], [[Lycaonia]], [[Pisidia]], [[Paphlagonia]], [[Cilicia]], and [[Cappadocia]].

Semitic [[Arameans]] encroached over the borders of south central Anatolia in the century or so after the fall of the Hittite empire, and some of the [[Neo-Hittite]] states in this region became an amalgam of Hittites and Arameans. These became known as [[Syro-Hittite states]].

In central and western Anatolia, another Indo-European people, the [[Luwians]], came to the fore, circa 2000 BC. Their language was closely related to [[Hittite language|Hittite]].<ref>Melchert 2003</ref> The general consensus amongst scholars is that Luwian was spoken—to a greater or lesser degree—across a large area of western Anatolia, including (possibly) [[Wilusa]] ([[Troy]]), the Seha River Land (to be identified with the [[Gediz River|Hermos]] and/or [[Bakırçay|Kaikos]] valley), and the kingdom of Mira-Kuwaliya with its core territory of the Maeander valley.<ref>Watkins 1994; id. 1995:144–51; Starke 1997; Melchert 2003; for the geography Hawkins 1998</ref> From the 9th century BC, Luwian regions coalesced into a number of states such as [[Lydia]], [[Caria]] and [[Lycia]], all of which had [[Greece|Hellenic]] influence.

The north western coasts of Anatolia were inhabited by Greeks of the [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaean]]/[[Mycenae]]an culture from the 20th century BC, related to the Greeks of south eastern Europe and the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times''</ref>

[[File:Templeofathenaprienemay2007.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The temple of [[Athena]] (funded by [[Alexander the Great]]) in the Greek city of [[Priene]]]]
Beginning with the [[Bronze Age collapse]] at the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the west coast of Anatolia was settled by [[Ionian Greeks]], usurping the area of the related but earlier [[Mycenaean Greeks]]. Over several centuries, numerous Ancient Greek [[city-state]]s were established on the coasts of Anatolia. Greeks started Western philosophy on the western coast of Anatolia ([[Pre-Socratic philosophy]]).<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Hurrian kingdoms, such as [[Nairi]] and the powerful state of [[Urartu]] arose in northeastern Anatolia from the 10th century BC, before eventually falling to the [[Assyrians]]. During the same period the [[Georgian people|Georgian]] states of [[Colchis]] and [[Tabal]] arose around the Black Sea and central Anatolia respectively.

From the late 8th century BC, a new wave of Indo-European-speaking raiders entered northern and northeast Anatolia: the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]]. The Cimmerians overran [[Phrygia]] and the Scythians threatened to do the same to Urartu and [[Lydia]], before both were finally checked by the [[Assyrians]].

From the 10th to late 7th centuries BC, much of Anatolia (particularly the east, central, southwestern and southeastern regions) fell to the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]], including all of the [[Neo-Hittite]] and [[Syro-Hittite]] states, Phrygia, Urartu, [[Nairi]], [[Tabal]], [[Cilicia]], [[Commagene]], [[Caria]], Lydia, the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] and swathes of [[Cappadocia]].

The Assyrian empire collapsed due to a bitter series of civil wars followed by a combined attack by [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], Scythians and their own [[Babylonia]]n relations. The last Assyrian city to fall was [[Harran]] in southeast Anatolia. This city was the birthplace of the last king of [[Babylon]], the Assyrian [[Nabonidus]] and his son and regent [[Belshazzar]]. Much of the region then fell to the short-lived Iran-based [[Median Empire]], with the Babylonians and Scythians briefly appropriating some territory.

Anatolia is known as the birthplace of minted [[coin]]age (as opposed to unminted coinage, which first appears in [[Mesopotamia]] at a much earlier date) as a medium of exchange, some time in the 7th century BC in Lydia. The use of minted coins continued to flourish during the [[Hellenistic period|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] eras.<ref>{{Cite book|isbn=0-415-08992-1|last=Howgego|first=C. J.|title=Ancient History from Coins|authorlink=Christopher Howgego| year=1995}}</ref><ref>[http://www.asiaminorcoins.com/ Asia Minor Coins] - an index of Greek and Roman coins from Asia Minor (ancient Anatolia)</ref>

During the 6th century BC, most of Anatolia was conquered by the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]], the Persians having usurped the [[Medes]] as the dominant dynasty in [[Iran]]. Also in the 6th century BC, the Indo-European [[Armenian people|Armenians]] founded the [[Orontid Dynasty]] in [[Urartu]]. In 499 BC, the Ionian city-states on the west coast of Anatolia rebelled against Persian rule. The [[Ionian Revolt]], as it became known, initiated the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], which ended in a Greek victory in 449 BC, and the Ionian cities regained their independence.

In 334 BC, the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] Greek king [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the peninsula.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Roisman|first1=Joseph|last2=Worthington|first2=Ian|title=A Companion to Ancient Macedonia|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2010|isbn=1-4051-7936-8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lkYFVJ3U-BIC|ref=harv}}</ref> Alexander's conquest opened up the interior of Asia Minor to Greek settlement and influence. Following the death of Alexander and the breakup of his empire, Anatolia was ruled by a series of Hellenistic kingdoms, such as the [[Attalid dynasty|Attalids of Pergamum]] and the [[Seleucids]], the latter controlling most of Anatolia. A period of peaceful [[Hellenization]] followed, such that the local Anatolian languages had been supplanted by Greek by the 1st century BC. In 133 BC the last Attalid king bequeathed his kingdom to the [[Roman Republic]], and western and central Anatolia came under [[Roman Republic|Roman]] control, but [[Hellenistic culture]] remained predominant. During the 1st century BC the Armenians established the powerful [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenian kingdom]] under [[Tigran]] who reigned throughout much of eastern Anatolia between the Caspian, Black, and Mediterranean seas. Areas of the southeast such as [[Harran]] and the [[Hakkari]] mountains continued to be inhabited by remnants of the [[Assyrians]], but these regions remained under [[Parthian language|Parthian]] and then [[Sassanid]] [[Persian language|Persian]] rule.

===Medieval and Renaissance periods===
[[File:Asia Minor ca 842 AD.svg|thumb|right|300px|Byzantine Anatolia and the Byzantine-Arab frontier zone in the mid-9th century]]
[[File:Anatolia1300.png|thumb|right|300px|Beyliks and other states around Anatolia, c. 1300.]]

After the division of the Roman Empire, Anatolia became part of the East Roman, or [[Byzantine Empire]].  Anatolia was one of the first places where Christianity spread, so that by the 4th century AD, western and central Anatolia were overwhelmingly Christian and Greek-speaking. For the next 600 years, while Imperial possessions in Europe were subjected to barbarian invasions, Anatolia would be the center of the Hellenic world.  Byzantine control was challenged by [[Arab]] raids starting in the 8th century (see [[Byzantine–Arab Wars]]), but in the 9th and 10th century a resurgent Byzantine Empire regained its lost territories and even expanded beyond its traditional borders, into [[Armenia]] and [[Syria]] (ancient [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]). In the 10 years following the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the [[Seljuk Turks]] from [[Central Asia]] established themselves over large areas of Anatolia, with particular concentrations around the north western rim.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Byzantine Empire 1025-1204 |last=Angold |first=Michael |coauthors= |year=1997 |isbn=0-582-29468-1 |page=117}}</ref> The Turkish language and the Islamic religion were gradually introduced as a result of the Seljuk conquest, and this period marks the start of Anatolia's slow transition from predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking, to predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking (although some ethnic groups such as Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians remained numerous and retained Christianity and their native languages). In the following century, the Byzantines managed to reassert their control in western and northern Anatolia. Control of Anatolia was then split between the Byzantine Empire and the Seljuk [[Sultanate of Rûm]], with the Byzantine holdings gradually being reduced. In 1255, the [[Mongols]] swept through eastern and central Anatolia, and would remain until 1335. The [[Ilkhanate]] garrison was stationed near [[Ankara]].<ref>H. M. Balyuzi ''Muḥammad and the course of Islám'', p.342</ref><ref>John Freely ''Storm on Horseback: The Seljuk Warriors of Turkey'', p.83</ref>

By the end of the 14th century, most of Anatolia was controlled by various [[Anatolian beyliks]].  Smyrna fell in 1330, and the last Byzantine stronghold in Anatolia, Philadelphia, fell in 1390. The [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] Beyliks were under the control of the Mongols, at least nominally, through declining Seljuk Sultans.<ref>Mehmet Fuat Köprülü, Gary Leiser-The origins of the Ottoman empire, p.33</ref><ref>Peter Partner ''God of battles: holy wars of Christianity and Islam'', p.122</ref> The Beyliks did not mint coins in the names of their own leaders while they remained under the suzerainty of the [[Mongol]] [[Ilkhanids]].<ref>''Osman's Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire'', p.13</ref> The [[Osmanli]] ruler [[Osman I]] was the first Turkish ruler who minted coins in his own name in 1320s, for it bears the legend "Minted by Osman son of Ertugul".<ref>Artuk - O''smanli Beyliginin Kurucusu'', 27f</ref> Since the minting of coins was a prerogative accorded in Islamic practice only to a [[sovereign]], it can be considered that Osmanli became independent of the Mongol Khans.<ref>Pamuk - ''A Monetary History'', p.30-31</ref>

After the decline of the Ilkhanate from 1335–1353, the [[Mongol Empire]]'s legacy in the region was the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] [[Eretna Dynasty]] that was overthrown by [[Kadi Burhan al-Din]] in 1381.<ref>Clifford Edmund Bosworth-The new Islamic dynasties: a chronological and genealogical manual, p.234</ref> Among the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] leaders the Ottomans emerged as great power under Osman and his son [[Orhan I]]. The Anatolian beyliks were in turn absorbed into the rising [[Ottoman Empire]] during the 15th century. The Ottomans completed the conquest of the peninsula in 1517 with the taking of [[Halicarnassus]] (modern [[Bodrum]]) from the [[Knights of Saint John]].

===Modern times===
[[File:Ethnicturkey1911.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ethnographic map of Anatolia from 1911.]]

With the beginning of the slow decline of the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century, and as a result of the expansionist policies of [[Czarist Russia]] in the [[Caucasus]], many Muslim nations and groups in that region, mainly [[Circassians]], [[Tatars]], [[Azeris]], [[Lezgian people|Lezgis]], [[Chechens]] and several [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups left their ancestral homelands and settled in Anatolia. As the Ottoman Empire further shrank in the [[Balkan]] regions and then fragmented during the [[Balkan Wars]], much of the non-Christian populations of its former possessions, mainly Balkan Muslims ([[Bosnians]], [[Albanians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Pomaks|Muslim Bulgarians]] and [[Greek Muslims]] such as the [[Vallahades]] from [[Greek Macedonia]], Bulgaria, Northern Macedonia), were resettled in various parts of Anatolia, mostly in formerly Christian villages throughout Anatolia.<ref>Justin McCarthy, ''Death and Exile: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ottoman Muslims, 1821-1922'', 1996, ISBN 0-87850-094-4</ref>

A continuous reverse migration occurred since the early 19th century, when Greeks from Anatolia, Constantinopole and Pontus area migrated toward the newly independent Kingdom of Greece, and also towards the United States, southern part of the Russian Empire, Latin America and rest of Europe. Following the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] (1828) and the incorporation of the Eastern [[Armenia]] into the Russian Empire, another reverse migration involved the large [[Armenians|Armenian]] population of Anatolia, which recorded significant migration rates from [[Western Armenia]] (Eastern Anatolia) toward the [[Russian Empire]], especially toward the newly established Armenian provinces of the empire.

Anatolia remained [[multi-ethnic]] until the early 20th century (see the [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]]). During World War I, the [[Armenian Genocide]], the [[Greek genocide]] (especially in [[Pontus]]), and the [[Assyrian Genocide]] almost entirely removed the ancient indigenous communities of [[Armenians|Armenian]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] populations in Anatolia, as well as a large part of its ethnic Greek population. Following the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922]], all remaining ethnic Anatolian Greeks were forced out during the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. Since the foundation of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, Anatolia has become Turkey, its inhabitants being mainly Turks and Kurds (see [[demographics of Turkey]] and [[history of Turkey]]).

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Turkey}}

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology of Turkey}}
Anatolia's terrain is structurally complex. A central [[massif]] composed of uplifted blocks and downfolded [[Trough (geology)|troughs]], covered by recent [[Deposit (geology)|deposits]] and giving the appearance of a plateau with rough terrain, is wedged between two folded mountain ranges that converge in the east. True lowland is confined to a few narrow coastal strips along the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Black Sea coasts. Flat or gently sloping land is rare and largely confined to the deltas of the [[Kızıl River]], the coastal plains of [[Çukurova]] and the valley floors of the [[Gediz River]] and the [[Büyük Menderes River]] as well as some interior high plains in Anatolia, mainly around [[Lake Tuz]] (Salt Lake) and the [[Konya]] Basin (''Konya Ovasi'').

Anatolia has a varied range of climates.  The central plateau is characterized by a continental climate, with hot summers and cold snowy winters.  The south and west coasts enjoy a typical Mediterranean climate, with mild rainy winters, and warm dry summers.<ref name=Prothero19>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=W.G.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11766/view/1/19/}}</ref> The Black Sea and Marmara coasts have temperate oceanic climate, with cool foggy summers and much rainfall throughout the year.

===Ecoregions===
There is a diverse number of plant and animal communities.

The mountains and coastal plain of northern Anatolia experiences humid and mild climate. There are [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|temperate broadleaf, mixed]] and [[temperate coniferous forest|coniferous]] forests. The central and eastern plateau, with its drier [[continental climate]], has deciduous forests and forest steppes. Western and southern Anatolia, which have a [[Mediterranean climate]], contain [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] ecoregions.
* [[Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests]]: These temperate broadleaf and mixed forests extend across northern Anatolia, lying between the mountains of northern Anatolia and the Black Sea. They include the enclaves of [[temperate rainforest]] lying along the southeastern coast of the Black Sea in eastern Turkey and Georgia.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0422|name=Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests|accessdate=May 25, 2008}}</ref>
* [[Northern Anatolian conifer and deciduous forests]]: These forests occupy the mountains of northern Anatolia, running east and west between the coastal Euxine-Colchic forests and the drier, continental climate forests of central and eastern Anatolia.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0515|name=Northern Anatolian conifer and deciduous forests|accessdate=May 25, 2008}}</ref>
* Central Anatolian deciduous forests: These forests of deciduous oaks and evergreen pines cover the plateau of central Anatolia.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0410|name=Central Anatolian deciduous forests|accessdate=May 25, 2008}}</ref>
* Central Anatolian [[steppe]]: These dry grasslands cover the drier valleys and surround the saline lakes of central Anatolia, and include [[halophytic]] (salt tolerant) plant communities.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|name=Central Anatolian steppe|accessdate=May 25, 2008|id=pa0803}}</ref>
* Eastern Anatolian deciduous forests: This ecoregion occupies the plateau of eastern Anatolia. The drier and more continental climate is beneficial for steppe-forests dominated by deciduous oaks, with areas of shrubland, montane forest, and valley forest.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0420|name=Eastern Anatolian deciduous forests|accessdate=May 25, 2008}}</ref>
* Anatolian conifer and deciduous mixed forests: These forests occupy the western, Mediterranean-climate portion of the Anatolian plateau. Pine forests and mixed pine and oak woodlands and shrublands are predominant.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|name=Anatolian conifer and deciduous mixed forests|accessdate=May 25, 2008|id=pa1202}}</ref>
* Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests: These Mediterranean-climate forests occupy the coastal lowlands and valleys of western Anatolia bordering the Aegean Sea. The ecoregion has forests of [[Turkish pine]] ''(Pinus brutia)'', oak forests and woodlands, and [[maquis shrubland]] of Turkish pine and evergreen [[sclerophyll]]ous trees and shrubs, including [[Olive]] ''(Olea europaea)'', [[Arbutus unedo|Strawberry Tree]] ''(Arbutus unedo)'', ''[[Arbutus andrachne]]'', Kermes Oak ''([[Quercus coccifera]])'', and [[Bay Laurel]] ''(Laurus nobilis)''.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|name=Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests|accessdate=May 25, 2008|id=pa1201}}</ref>
* Southern Anatolian montane conifer and deciduous forests: These mountain forests occupy the Mediterranean-climate [[Taurus Mountains]] of southern Anatolia. Conifer forests are predominant, chiefly Anatolian black pine ''([[Pinus nigra]])'', Cedar of Lebanon ''([[Cedrus libani]])'', Taurus fir ''([[Abies cilicica]])'', and [[juniper]] ''([[Juniperus foetidissima]]'' and ''[[Juniperus excelsa|J. excelsa]])''. Broadleaf trees include oaks, [[hornbeam]], and [[maple]]s.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|name=Southern Anatolian montane conifer and deciduous forests|accessdate=May 25, 2008|id=pa1220}}</ref>
* [[Eastern Mediterranean conifer-sclerophyllous-broadleaf forests]]: This ecoregion occupies the coastal strip of southern Anatolia between the Taurus Mountains and the Mediterranean Sea. Plant communities include broadleaf sclerophyllous maquis shrublands, forests of Aleppo Pine ''(''Pinus halepensis'')'' and Turkish Pine ''(Pinus brutia)'', and dry oak ''(Quercus'' spp.) woodlands and steppes.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa1207|name=Eastern Mediterranean conifer-sclerophyllous-broadleaf forests|accessdate=May 25, 2008}}</ref>
