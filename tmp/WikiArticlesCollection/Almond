The '''almond''' (''Prunus amygdalus'', [[Synonym (taxonomy)#Botany|syn.]] ''Prunus dulcis'', ''Amygdalus communis'', ''Amygdalus dulcis'') is a species of tree native to the Middle East and South Asia. "Almond" is also the name of the edible and widely cultivated seed of this tree. Within the genus  ''[[Prunus]]'', it is classified with the [[peach]] in the subgenus ''Amygdalus'', distinguished from the other subgenera by the corrugated shell ([[endocarp]]) surrounding the seed.

The fruit of the almond is a [[drupe]], consisting of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed (which is not a [[nut (fruit)|true nut]]) inside.  Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the [[seed]]. Almonds are sold '''shelled''' (i.e., after the shells are removed), or '''unshelled''' (i.e., with the shells still attached). '''[[Blanching (cooking)|Blanched]]''' almonds are shelled almonds that have been treated with hot water to soften the [[seedcoat]], which is then removed to reveal the white [[embryo]].

[[File:بادام و شکوفه بادام.JPG|thumbnail|right|Almond blossoms with its fruit in [[Tudeshg]], [[Isfahan]], Iran]]
The almond is a [[deciduous]] [[tree]], growing {{convert|4|-|10|m|0|abbr=on}} in height, with a trunk of up to {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter. The young [[twig]]s are green at first, becoming purplish where exposed to sunlight, then grey in their second year. The [[leaf|leaves]] are 3–5&nbsp;inches long,<ref>Bailey, L.H.; Bailey, E.Z.; the staff of the Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium. 1976. ''Hortus third: A concise dictionary of plants cultivated in the United States and Canada''. Macmillan, New York.</ref> with a serrated margin and a {{convert|2.5|cm|0|abbr=on}} [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]. The [[flower]]s are white to pale pink, {{convert|3|-|5|cm|0|abbr=on}} diameter with five petals, produced singly or in pairs and appearing before the leaves in early spring.<ref name=rushforth>{{cite book |last=Rushforth |first=Keith |title=Collins wildlife trust guide trees: a photographic guide to the trees of Britain and Europe |publisher=Harper Collins |location=London |year=1999 |isbn=0-00-220013-9}}</ref><ref name=rhs>{{cite book |last=Griffiths |first=Mark D. |coauthors=Anthony Julian Huxley |title=The New Royal Horticultural Society dictionary of gardening |publisher=Macmillan Press |location=London |year=1992 |isbn=0-333-47494-5}}</ref>

Almonds begin  bearing  an economic crop  in  the third  year after planting. Trees reach full bearing five to six years after planting. The fruit matures in the autumn, 7–8 months after flowering.<ref name=rhs/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://coststudies.ucdavis.edu/files/almondvs08sprink.pdf |title=University of California Sample Cost Study to Produce Almonds |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref>

The almond fruit measures {{convert|3.5|-|6|cm|0|abbr=on}} long. In botanical terms, it is not a [[nut (fruit)|nut]], but a [[drupe]]. The outer covering or [[exocarp]], fleshy in other members of ''Prunus'' such as the [[plum]] and [[cherry]], is instead a thick, leathery, grey-green coat (with a downy exterior), called the hull. Inside the hull is a reticulated, hard, woody shell (like the outside of a peach pit) called the [[endocarp]]. Inside the shell is the edible seed, commonly called a nut. Generally, one seed is present, but occasionally two occur.

== Origin and history ==
[[File:Harvesting of the almond crop at Qand-i Badam.jpg|thumb|upright|Harvesting of the almond crop at [[Konibodom|Qand-i Badam]], [[Fergana Valley]] (16th century)<ref>{{cite web|last=Bhawani |url=http://warfare.atspace.eu/Moghul/Baburnama/Harvesting_of_the_almond_crop_at_Qand-i_Badam.htm |title=Harvesting of the almond crop at Qand-i Badam |date=1590s |work=Baburnama}}</ref>]]
The almond is native to the [[Mediterranean climate]] region of the [[Middle East]], eastward as far as the [[Indus]].<ref name=Rieger>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vUXKIkjDtAQC&pg=RA1-PA38 Introduction to Fruit Crops], p. 38, Mark Rieger, 2006</ref> It was spread by humans in ancient times along the shores of the Mediterranean into northern Africa and southern Europe and more recently transported to other parts of the world, notably [[California]], United States.<ref name=Rieger/>
[[File:Almondtrees.jpg|thumb|left|A grove of almond trees in central California]]

The wild form of domesticated almond grows in parts of the [[Levant]]; almonds must first have been taken into cultivation in this region. The fruit of the wild forms contains the [[glycoside]] [[amygdalin]], "which becomes transformed into deadly prussic acid ([[hydrogen cyanide]]) after crushing, chewing, or any other injury to the seed."<ref name=zohary>{{cite book |last=Zohary |first=Daniel |coauthors=Maria Hopf |title=Domestication of plants in the old world: the origin and spread of cultivated plants in West Asia, Europe, and the Nile Valley |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |page=186 |isbn=0-19-850356-3}}</ref>

Almond is considered to be one of the earliest domesticated tree nuts. Wild almonds are bitter, the kernel produces deadly cyanide upon mechanical handling, and eating even a few dozen at one sitting can be fatal. Selection of the sweet type, from the many bitter types in wild, marked the beginning of almond domestication. How humans selected the sweet type remains a mystery.<ref name=ladizinsky99>{{cite journal|title=On the origin of almond|author=G. Ladizinsky|journal=Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution|volume= 46|year=1999|pages= 143–147|doi=10.1023/A:1008690409554|issue= 2}}</ref> It is unclear as to which wild ancestor of the almond created the domesticated species. Ladizinsky suggests the taxon ''Amygdalus fenzliana'' (Fritsch) Lipsky is the most likely wild ancestor of the almond in part because it is native of [[Armenia]] and western [[Azerbaijan]] where it was apparently domesticated.

While wild almond species are toxic, domesticated almonds are not; [[Jared Diamond]] argues that a common genetic mutation causes an absence of glycoside amygdalin, and this mutant was grown by early farmers, "at first unintentionally in the garbage heaps, and later intentionally in their orchards".<ref>{{cite book |last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=[[Guns, Germs, and Steel|Guns, germs, and steel: the fates of human societies]] |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=1997 |page=118 |isbn=0-393-03891-2}}</ref> Zohary and Hopf believe that almonds were one of the earliest domesticated fruit trees due to "the ability of the grower to raise attractive almonds from seed. Thus, in spite of the fact that this plant does not lend itself to propagation from suckers or from cuttings, it could have been domesticated even before the introduction of [[grafting]]".<ref name=zohary/> Domesticated almonds appear in the [[Early Bronze Age]] (3000–2000 BC) such as the archaeological sites of Numeria ([[Jordan]]),<ref name=ladizinsky99/> or possibly a little earlier. Another well-known archaeological example of the almond is the fruit found in [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb in Egypt (c. 1325 BC), probably imported from the Levant.<ref name=zohary/>  Of the [[Europe]]an countries that the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh reported as cultivating almonds, [[Germany]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://193.62.154.38/cgi-bin/nph-readbtree.pl/feout?FAMILY_XREF=&GENUS_XREF=Prunus&SPECIES_XREF=dulcis&TAXON_NAME_XREF=&RANK= |title=''Flora Europaea'' Search Results |accessdate=2008-07-17 |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]]}}</ref> is the northernmost, though the domesticated form can be found as far north as [[Iceland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pfaf/cgi-bin/arr_html?Prunus+dulcis |title=''Prunus dulcis'' |accessdate=2008-07-17 |publisher=[[Plants for a Future]]}} {{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref>

=== Etymology and names ===
The word "almond" comes from Old French ''almande'' or ''alemande'', [[Late Latin]] *''amandula'', derived through a form ''amygdala'' from the Greek ἀμυγδαλή (''amygdalē'') (cf. [[amygdala]]), an almond.<ref>{{cite web|title=Almond|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/almond|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref>  The ''al-'' in English, for the ''a-'' used in other languages may be due  a confusion with the [[Arabic]] article ''al'', the word having first dropped the ''a-'' as in the [[Italian language|Italian]] form ''mandorla''; the British pronunciation ''ah-mond'' and the modern Catalan ''ametlla'' and modern French ''amande'' show a form of the word closer to the original. Other related names of almond include ''Mandel'' or ''Knackmandel'' (German), ''mandorlo'' (Italian), ''amêndoa'' (Portuguese), and ''almendro'' (Spanish).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Prun_dul.html|title= Almond (Prunus dulcis [Mill.] D. A. Webb.)|author= Gernot Katzer|year=2005|publisher= University of Graz, Austria}}</ref>

The adjective "amygdaloid" (literally "like an almond") is used to describe objects which are roughly almond-shaped, particularly a shape which is part way between a [[triangle]] and an [[ellipse]]. See, for example, the [[neuroanatomy|brain structure]] [[amygdala]], which uses a direct borrowing of the Greek term ''amygdalē''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Amygdaloid Complex: Anatomy and Physiology|author=SAH et al.|doi= 10.1152/physrev.00002.2003|journal=Physiological Reviews|date= July 1, 2003|volume= 83|pages= 803–834|issue= 3|pmid=12843409|first2=ES|first3=M|first4=J}}</ref>

=== Pollination ===

The [[pollination]] of California's almonds is the largest annual [[Pollination management|managed pollination]] event in the world, with close to one million hives (nearly half of all [[beehive (beekeeping)|beehives]] in the USA) being trucked in February to the almond groves. Much of the pollination is managed by pollination brokers, who contract with migratory [[beekeeper]]s from at least 49 states for the event.  This business has been heavily impacted by [[colony collapse disorder]], causing nationwide shortages of honey bees and increasing the price of [[insect pollination]].  To alleviate almond growers from the rising cost of insect pollination, researchers at the [[Agricultural Research Service]] (ARS) have developed a new line of [[self-pollinating]] almond trees.<ref name=ARS>Alfredo Flores. "[http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100406.htm ARS Scientists Develop Self-pollinating Almond Trees]". [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service]], April 6, 2010.</ref>  Self-pollinating almond trees, such as the '[[Tuono]]', have been around for a while, but their harvest is not as desirable as the insect-pollinated California 'Nonpareil' almond tree.  The 'Nonpareil' tree produces large, smooth almonds and offers 60–65% edible kernel per nut.  The 'Tuono', however, has thicker, hairier shells and offers only 32% of edible kernel per nut, but having a thick shell has advantages.  The 'Tuono’s' shell protects the nut from threatening pests such as the [[Amyelois transitella|navel orangeworm]].  ARS researchers have managed to cross-breed the pest-resistant 'Tuono' tree with the 'Nonpareil', resulting in [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ized varieties of almond trees that are self-pollinated and maintain a high nut quality.<ref>{{cite web

While the almond is often eaten on its own, raw or toasted, it is also a component of various dishes. Almonds are available in many forms, such as whole, sliced (flaked, slivered), and as flour.  Almonds yield almond oil and can also be made into almond butter or almond milk. These products can be used in both sweet and savoury dishes.

Along with other nuts, almonds can be sprinkled over breakfasts and desserts, particularly ''[[muesli]]'' or ice cream-based dishes. Almonds are used in [[marzipan]], [[nougat]], many pastries (including ''[[jesuite]]s''), cookies (including [[macaron|French'' macarons'']], [[macaroon]]s), and cakes (including [[Financier (pastry)|financiers]]), ''[[noghl]]'', and other sweets and desserts. They are also used to make [[almond butter]], a spread similar to [[peanut butter]], popular with [[peanut allergy]] sufferers and for its naturally sweeter taste. The young, developing fruit of the almond tree can be eaten whole ("green almonds") when they are still green and fleshy on the outside and the inner shell has not yet hardened. The fruit is somewhat sour, but is a popular snack in parts of the Middle East, eaten dipped in salt to balance the sour taste. They are available only from mid-April to mid-June in the Northern Hemisphere; pickling or brining extends the fruit's shelf life.

For dessert, [[almond cookie]]s, Chinese [[almond biscuit]]s, and Italian ''[[ricciarelli]]'' use almonds.

*In [[Greece]], ground blanched almonds are used as the base material in a great variety of desserts, usually called ''amygdalota'' (αμυγδαλωτά).  Because of their white colour, most are traditionally considered "wedding sweets" and are served at wedding banquets. In addition, a soft drink known as ''[[soumada]]'' is made from almonds in various regions.

*In [[Iran]], green almonds are dipped in [[sea salt]] and eaten as snacks on street markets; they are called ''chaqale bâdam''. Also sweet almonds are used to prepare a special food for babies, named ''harire badam''. Almonds are added to some foods, cookies, and desserts, or are used to decorate foods. People in Iran consume roasted nuts for special events, for example, during New Year parties.

*In [[Italy]], the bitter almonds from apricots are the base for ''[[Amaretti di Saronno|amaretti]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=Amaretto Macaroon|title=Fine Italian Pastries & Biscotti|url=http://www.olivetreetrading.com/product-vicenzi.html|accessdate=10 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110512173724/http://www.olivetreetrading.com/product-vicenzi.html| archivedate= 12 May 2011 <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Traditionally, a low percentage of bitter almonds (10-20%) is added to the ingredients, which gives the cookies their bitter taste (commercially, [[apricot kernel]]s are used as a substitute for bitter almonds). Almonds are also a common choice as the nuts to include in ''[[torrone]]''. In [[Puglia]] and [[Sicily]], ''pasta di mandorle'' (almond paste) is used to make small soft cakes, often decorated with jam, [[pistacchio]], or chocolate. In Sicily, [[almond milk]] is a popular refreshing beverage in summer.

*In [[Morocco]], almonds in the form of sweet [[almond paste]] are the main ingredient in pastry fillings, and several other [[List of Moroccan dishes#Desserts|desserts]]. Fried blanched whole almonds are also used to decorate sweet ''[[tajine]]s'' such as lamb with prunes.  A drink made from almonds mixed with milk is served in important ceremonies such as weddings and can also be ordered in some cafes. Southwestern Berber regions of [[Essaouira]] and Souss are also known for ''amlou'', a spread made of almond paste, [[argan oil]], and honey.  Almond paste is also mixed with toasted flour and among others, honey, olive oil or butter, anise, fennel, sesame seeds, and cinnamon to make ''sellou'' (also called ''zamita'' in [[Meknes]] or ''slilou'' in [[Marrakech]]), a sweet snack known for its long shelf life and high nutritive value.

*In  [[Indian cuisine]], almonds are the base ingredients of ''[[pasanda]]''-style [[curry|curries]]. ''Badam halva'' is a sweet made from almonds with added coloring. Almond flakes are added to many sweets (such as ''sohan barfi''), and are usually visible sticking to the outer surface.

*In [[Pakistani cuisine]], almonds are the base ingredients of many food items. Meat dishes containing almonds include [[pasanda]]-style or Mughalai [[curry|curries]]. [[Badam halva]] is a sweet made from almonds with added coloring. Almond flakes are added to many sweets (such as ''sohan barfi''), and are usually visible sticking to the outer surface. Almonds form the base of various drinks which are supposed to have cooling properties. Almond sherbet or ''sherbet-e-badaam'' in [[Urdu]], is a popular summer drink. Almonds are also sold as a snack with added salt.

Almonds can be processed into a [[milk substitute]] called [[almond milk]]; the nut's soft texture, mild flavour, and light colouring (when skinned) make for an efficient analog to dairy, and a soy-free choice for [[Lactose intolerance|lactose intolerant]] people and [[Veganism|vegans]]. Raw, blanched, and lightly toasted almonds work well for different production techniques, some of which are similar to that of [[soymilk]] and some of which use no heat, resulting in "raw milk" (see [[raw foodism]]).

The 'Marcona' almond cultivar is recognizably different from other almonds, and is marketed by name.<ref name=Gradziel>{{cite book|author=Gradziel, T.M.|year=2011|title= Horticultural Reviews, Volume 38|chapter= Origin and dissemination of Almonds|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|editor= J. Janick}}</ref> The kernel is short, round, relatively sweet, and delicate in texture. It has been grown in Spain for a long time and its origin is unknown; the tree is very productive, and the shell of the nut is very hard.<ref name=Gradziel/> 'Marcona' almonds are traditionally served after being lightly fried in oil, and are used by Spanish chefs to prepare a dessert called ''[[turrón]]''.

=== Almond flour ===
[[Almond flour]] is often used as a [[gluten-free]] alternative to wheat flour in cooking and baking.<ref>{{cite book|last=Amsterdam|first=Elana|title=The Gluten-Free Almond Flour Cookbook: Breakfasts, Entrees, and More|publisher=Random House of Canada|year=2009|isbn=978-1-58761-345-6}}</ref>

=== Almond syrup ===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}
Historically, almond syrup was an [[emulsion]] of sweet and bitter almonds, usually made with [[barley syrup]] ([[orgeat syrup]]) or in a syrup of [[orange flower water]] and [[sugar]].

''[[The Grocer's Encyclopedia]]'' (1911) noted, "Ten parts of sweet almonds are generally employed to three parts of bitter almonds"; however, due to the [[cyanide]] found in bitter almonds, modern syrups generally consist of only sweet almonds.

The almond contains about 26% [[carbohydrate]]s (12% dietary fiber, 6.3% sugars, 0.7% starch and the rest miscellaneous carbohydrates), and may therefore be made into flour for cakes and cookies (biscuits) for low-carbohydrate diets. A standard serving of almond flour, 1&nbsp;cup, contains 20&nbsp;grams of carbohydrates, of which 10&nbsp;g is [[dietary fiber]].  This makes almond flour very desirable for use in cake and bread recipes by people on carbohydrate-restricted diets.

Almonds are a rich source of [[vitamin E]], containing 26&nbsp;mg per 100&nbsp;g (Table). About 20 percent of raw almond is high quality [[protein (nutrient)|protein]], a third of which are essential amino acids.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} An ounce of almonds contains 12% of necessary daily protein.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} They are also rich in [[dietary fiber]], [[B vitamin]]s, [[essential mineral]]s and [[monounsaturated fat]] (see nutrient table), one of the two fats which potentially may lower [[LDL cholesterol]]. Typical of nuts and seeds, almonds also contain [[phytosterol]]s, associated with cholesterol-lowering properties.

Potential health benefits, which have not been scientifically validated, include improved [[complexion]] and possibly a lower risk of [[cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davis PA, Iwahashi CK |title=Whole almonds and almond fractions reduce aberrant crypt foci in a rat model of colon carcinogenesis |journal=Cancer Lett. |volume=165 |issue=1 |pages=27–33 |year=2001 |month=April |pmid=11248415 |doi= 10.1016/S0304-3835(01)00425-6|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304383501004256 |accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref> Preliminary research associates consumption of almonds with elevating blood levels of [[high density lipoprotein]]s and lowering [[low density lipoprotein]]s.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Almonds: Cholesterol lowering, heart-healthy snack |publisher=[[Porter Novelli]] |year=2002 |month=September |url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2002/D/20024677.html |accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Spiller GA, Jenkins DA, Bosello O, Gates JE, Cragen LN, Bruce B |title=Nuts and plasma lipids: an almond-based diet lowers LDL-C while preserving HDL-C |journal=J Am Coll Nutr |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=285–90 |year=1998 |month=June |pmid=9627917 |doi= 10.1080/07315724.1998.10718761|url=http://www.jacn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9627917 |accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref> A preliminary trial showed that using them in the daily diet might lower several factors associated with heart disease, including cholesterol and blood lipids.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jenkins DJ, Kendall CW, Marchie A, ''et al.'' |title=Dose response of almonds on coronary heart disease risk factors: blood lipids, oxidized low-density lipoproteins, lipoprotein(a), homocysteine, and pulmonary nitric oxide: a randomized, controlled, crossover trial |journal=Circulation |volume=106 |issue=11 |pages=1327–32 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12221048 |doi= 10.1161/01.CIR.0000028421.91733.20|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/106/11/1327 |accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref>

Almonds may cause [[food allergy|allergy]] or [[food intolerance|intolerance]]. Cross-reactivity is common with [[peach]] [[allergen]]s ([[lipid transfer proteins]]) and tree [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] allergens. Symptoms range from local symptoms (e.g., [[oral allergy syndrome]], [[contact urticaria]]) to systemic symptoms including [[anaphylaxis]] (e.g., [[urticaria]], [[angioedema]], gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.food-info.net/uk/intol/almond.htm |title=Almond allergy on Food info |publisher=Food-info.net |date=2001-07-26 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref>

== Oils ==
[[Image:SweetAlmondOil.png|thumb|left|Almond oil in a clear glass vial]]

Almonds are a rich source of oil, with values ranging between 36 to 60% of kernel dry mass.<ref>{{cite web|title=Almond|author=John Labavitch|publisher=United States Dept of Agriculture|year=2001|url=http://www.ba.ars.usda.gov/hb66/157almond.pdf}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ Search the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference] under "Nuts, almonds". [[Agricultural Research Service]], [[United States Department of Agriculture]].</ref> A study by Venkatchalam and Sathe suggests almonds contain approximately 44% [[Fat|oils]], of which 62% is monounsaturated [[oleic acid]] (an [[omega-9 fatty acid]]), 29% is [[linoleic acid]] (a polyunsaturated [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] [[essential fatty acid]]), and 9% is [[saturated fatty acid]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Chemical Composition of Selected Edible Nut Seeds|author=MAHESH VENKATACHALAM and SHRIDHAR SATHE|journal=J.

"''Oleum amygdalae''", the fixed oil, is prepared from either sweet or bitter almonds and is a [[glyceryl oleate]], with a slight odour and a nutty taste. It is almost insoluble in [[ethanol|alcohol]] but readily soluble in [[chloroform]] or [[diethyl ether|ether]]. Sweet almond oil is obtained from the dried [[seed|kernel]] of sweet almonds.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Oil content and fatty acid composition of developing almond seeds|author=Soler et al.|journal=J. Agric. Food Chem.|year=1988|volume=36|issue=4|pages= 695–697|doi=10.1021/jf00082a007|first2=Jaime|first3=Fulgencio}}</ref>

The oil is good for application to the skin as an [[emollient]], and has been traditionally used by [[massage therapist]]s to lubricate the skin during a massage session.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Antenatal perineal massage and subsequent perineal outcomes: a randomised controlled trial|author=Shipman et al.|journal=An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology|volume= 104|issue= 7| pages= 787–791|date= July 1997|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.1997.tb12021.x|pmid=9236642|first2=D.

Almond oil can also be used as a wood conditioner of certain [[woodwind instrument]]s, such as the oboe and clarinet.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Guide to the Restoration of Woodwind Instruments|author=Michael Zadro|journal=Early Music|volume=2|issue=33|year=1974|pages=169–173|jstor=3125563|doi=10.1093/earlyj/2.3.169}}</ref>

== Aflatoxins ==
Almonds, like other tree nuts, are susceptible to [[aflatoxin]]-producing molds.<ref>{{cite web|title=The high cost of aflatoxins|publisher=Almond Board of California|year=2009|url=http://www.almondboard.com/Handlers/Documents/The-High-Cost-of-Aflatoxins.pdf}}</ref> Aflatoxins are potent [[carcinogen]]ic chemicals produced by molds such as ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus parasiticus]]''. The mold contamination may occur from soil, previously infested almonds, and almond pests such as navel orangeworm. High levels of mold growth typically appear as gray to black filament like growth. It is unsafe to eat mold infected tree nuts.

Some countries have strict limits on allowable limits for aflatoxin contamination on almonds, and require adequate testing before the nuts can be marketed to their citizens. The European Union, for example, introduced a mandatory requirement since 2007 that all almond shipments to EU must be tested for aflatoxin. If aflatoxin does not meet the strict safety regulations, the entire consignment may be reprocessed to eliminate the aflatoxin or it must be destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aflatoxins in food|publisher=European Food Safety Authority|year=2010|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/aflatoxins.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=New EU Aflatoxin Levels and Sampling Plan|publisher=USDA Foreign Agricultural Service|year=2010|url=http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/New%20EU%20Aflatoxin%20Levels%20and%20Sampling%20Plan_Brussels%20USEU_EU-27_3-9-2010.pdf}}</ref>

The almond industry not only tests and processes almonds to ensure infected almonds do not reach the market, the industry also takes steps to prevent sources that cause contamination. These steps include 
proper orchard management, winter sanitation, early harvest, proper storage among others.

==Mandatory pasteurization in California==
The [[USDA]] approved a proposal by the Almond Board of California to pasteurize almonds sold to the public, after tracing cases of [[salmonellosis]] to almonds. The almond pasteurization program became mandatory for California companies in 2007.<ref>{{cite press release

California almonds labeled "raw" must be steam-pasteurized or chemically treated with [[propylene oxide]]. This doesn't apply to imported almonds<ref>[[Agricultural Marketing Service]] (2006-11-08) "Almonds Grown in California: Changes to Incoming Quality Control Requirements" ({{Federal Register |71 |65373}}, {{Federal Register |71 |65374}}, {{Federal Register |71 |65375}} and {{Federal Register |71 |65376}})</ref> or almonds sold from the grower directly to the consumer in small quantities.<ref>{{cite news

</ref> The treatment also isn't required for raw almonds sold for export outside of North America.

The Almond Board of California claims “PPO residue dissipates after treatment”; however, the EPA reports “Propylene oxide has been detected in fumigated food products; consumption of contaminated food is another possible route of exposure.” PPO is classified by the EPA as a “Group B2, probable human carcinogen.”

The USDA-approved marketing order was challenged in court by organic farmers organized by the Cornucopia Institute, a Wisconsin-based farm policy research group.  According to the Cornucopia Institute, this almond marketing order has imposed significant financial burdens on small-scale and organic growers and damaged domestic almond markets. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in the spring of 2009 on procedural grounds. In August 2009 farmers were appealing.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = The Authentic Almond Project

==Cultural aspects==<!-- This section is linked from [[Aaron's rod]] -->
[[File:Harvesting of the almond crop at Qand-i Badam 1.jpg|thumb|An illustration of Almond harvesting from the [[Baburnama]].]]

The almond is highly revered in some cultures. The tree originated in the Middle East,<ref>{{cite book |author=Tubeileh A, Bruggeman A, Turkelboom F |title=Growing Olives and Other Tree Species in Marginal Arid Environments |publisher=[[ICARDA]] |year=2004 |url=http://www.icarda.org/docrep/Books/Growing_Olives/Olive.pdf}}</ref> and is mentioned numerous times in the [[Bible]].

In the [[Hebrew Bible]], the almond was a symbol of watchfulness and promise due to its early flowering. In the [[Bible]] the almond is mentioned ten times, beginning with [[Book of Genesis]] 43:11, where it is described as "among the best of fruits". In [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 17 [[Levi]] is chosen from the other tribes of Israel by [[Aaron's rod]], which brought forth almond flowers. According to tradition, the rod of Aaron bore sweet almonds on one side and bitter on the other; if the Israelites followed the Lord, the sweet almonds would be ripe and edible, but if they were to forsake the path of the Lord, the bitter almonds would predominate. The almond blossom supplied a model for the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] which stood in the [[Holy Temple]], "Three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on one branch, with a knob and a flower; and three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on the other...on the candlestick itself were four cups, shaped like almond blossoms, with its knobs and flowers"  ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 25:33–34; 37:19–20). Similarly, Christian symbolism often uses almond branches as a symbol of the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus]]; paintings often include almonds encircling the [[Child Jesus|baby Jesus]] and as a symbol of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]]. The word "[[Luz]]", which appears in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 30:37, is sometimes translated as "[[hazel]]", may actually be derived from the Aramaic name for almond (Luz), and is translated as such in some Bible versions such as the [[NIV]].<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=g8YSB2K9d1oC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=Aramaic+almond&source=web&ots=bUh0oxqLD2&sig=5WxT7GZydOwBr0xzulBblDuZDcE&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=resultThe meaning of trees: botany, history, healing, lore]'' by Fred Hageneder, p. 37.</ref>
The Arabic name for almond is "laoz". In some parts of the Levant it is pronounced "loz", which is very close to its Aramaic origin.
