{{Politics of Burundi}}
'''Politics of Burundi''' takes place in a framework of a transitional [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Burundi]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the two chambers of parliament, the [[Senate of Burundi|Senate]] and the [[National Assembly of Burundi|National Assembly]].

==Political landscape after the civil war==
The political landscape of Burundi has been dominated in recent years by the [[civil war]] and a long [[Peacebuilding|peace process]] and move to [[democracy]].  The current [[President of Burundi]] is [[Pierre Nkurunziza]], a former rebel leader of the [[Hutu]] [[National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy]] who was [[Burundi elections, 2005|elected unopposed]] as the new [[Rulers and heads of state of Burundi|President of Burundi]] by the [[Parliament of Burundi|parliament]] on 19 August 2005.  Nkurunziza was the first president chosen through democratic means since the start of the [[Burundi Civil War|civil war]] in 1993 and was sworn in on 26 August, replacing transitional president [[Domitien Ndayizeye]].

In November 1995, the presidents of [[Burundi]], [[Rwanda]], [[Uganda]], and [[Zaire]] (currently [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]) announced a regional initiative for a negotiated peace in Burundi facilitated by former Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]]. In July 1996, former Burundian President [[Pierre Buyoya|Buyoya]] returned to power in a [[1996 Burundian coup d'état|bloodless coup]]. He declared himself president of a transitional republic, even as he suspended the National Assembly, banned opposition groups, and imposed a nationwide curfew. Widespread condemnation of the coup ensued, and regional countries imposed economic sanctions pending a return to a constitutional government. Buyoya agreed in 1996 to liberalize political parties. Nonetheless, fighting between the army and [[Hutu]] militias continued. In June 1998, Buyoya promulgated a transitional constitution and announced a partnership between the government and the opposition-led National Assembly. After facilitator Julius Nyerere's death in October 1999, the regional leaders appointed [[Nelson Mandela]] as [[Facilitator]] of the [[Arusha]] peace process. Under Mandela the peace process has revived and important progress has taken place.
