[[File:F-Stecker und Kabel.jpg|thumb|[[Coaxial cable]] used to carry cable television into subscribers' residences.]]
'''Cable television''' is a system of distributing [[television program]]s to subscribers via [[radio frequency]] (RF) signals transmitted through [[coaxial cable]]s or light pulses through [[fiber-optic cable]]s. This contrasts with traditional [[broadcast television]] ([[terrestrial television]]) in which the television signal is transmitted [[Terrestrial television|over the air]] by [[radio wave]]s and received by a [[television antenna]] attached to the television. [[FM radio]] programming, [[high-speed Internet]], [[telephony|telephone service]], and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables.

The abbreviation '''CATV''' is often used for cable television. It originally stood for '''Community Access Television''' or '''Community Antenna Television''', from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large "community antennas" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes. The origins of cable ''[[broadcasting]]'' are even older as radio programming was [[Linjesender|distributed by cable]] in some European cities as far back as 1924.

[[Image:HFC Network Diagram.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Diagram of a modern [[hybrid fiber coaxial]] cable television system. At the regional ''[[cable television headend|headend]]'', the TV channels are sent multiplexed on a light beam which travels through [[optical fiber]] trunklines, which fan out from ''distribution hubs'' to ''optical nodes'' in local communities. Here the light signal from the fiber is translated to a [[radio frequency]] electrical signal, which is distributed through [[coaxial cable]] to individual subscriber homes.]]

==Receiving cable television==
[[Image:HÜP von KBW.JPG|thumb|A cable television distribution box ''(left)'' in the basement of a building in Germany, with a splitter ''(right)'' which supplies the signal to separate cables which go to different rooms.]]

In order to receive cable television at a given location, cable distribution lines must be available on the local utility poles or underground utility lines. [[Coaxial cable]] brings the signal to the customer's building through a ''[[service drop]]'', an overhead or underground cable. If the subscriber's building does not have a cable service drop, the cable company will install one. The standard cable used in the U.S. is [[RG-6]], which has a 75 ohm impedance, and connects with a type [[F connector]]. The cable company's portion of the wiring usually ends at a distribution box on the building exterior, and built-in cable wiring in the walls usually distributes the signal to jacks in different rooms to which televisions are connected. Multiple cables to different rooms are split off the incoming cable with a small device called a splitter.

There are two standards for cable television; older [[analog cable]], and newer [[digital cable]] which is capable of carrying high definition signals used by newer digital [[HDTV]] televisions.  Many cable companies have upgraded to digital cable in the last 5 years.  To receive digital cable, most TVs require a [[digital television adapter]] ([[set-top box]] or [[cable converter box]]) from the cable company.  A cable from the jack in the wall is attached to the input of the box, and an output cable from the box is attached to the "Antenna In" or "RF In" connector on the back of the television.  Different converter boxes are required for newer digital [[HDTV]] TVs and older legacy [[analog television]]s.  The box must be "activated" by a signal from the cable company before use.

Most American [[television set]]s are "cable-ready" and have a [[tuner (television)|television tuner]] capable of receiving older analog cable TV.  The cable from the wall is attached directly to the "Antenna In" connector on the back of the television.

==How it works==
In the most common system, multiple television channels (as many as 500) are distributed to subscriber residences through a [[coaxial cable]], which comes from a trunkline supported on [[utility pole]]s originating at the cable company's local distribution facility, called the [[cable television headend|headend]]. Multiple channels are transmitted through the cable by a technique called [[frequency division multiplexing]]. At the headend, each television channel is translated to a different [[frequency]]. By giving each channel a different frequency "slot" on the cable the separate television signals do not interfere. At the subscriber's residence, either the subscriber's television or a [[set-top box]] provided by the cable company translates the desired channel back to its original frequency (baseband), and it is displayed on the screen. Due to widespread [[cable theft]] in earlier analog systems, in modern [[digital cable]] systems the signals are [[encrypted]], and the set-top box must be activated by an [[activation code]] sent by the cable company before it will function, which is only sent after the subscriber signs up. There are also usually "[[upstream (networking)|upstream]]" channels on the cable, to send data from the customer box to the cable headend, for advanced features such as requesting [[pay-per-view]] shows, [[cable internet access]], and [[cable telephony|cable telephone service]]. The "[[downstream (networking)|downstream]]" channels occupy a band of [[frequency|frequencies]] from approximately 50&nbsp;MHz to 1&nbsp;GHz, while the "[[upstream (networking)|upstream]]" channels occupy frequencies of 5 to 42&nbsp;MHz. Subscribers pay with a monthly fee. Subscribers can choose from several levels of service, with "premium" packages including more channels but costing more.

At the local headend, the feed signals from the individual television channels are received by [[parabolic dish|dish antennas]] from [[communication satellite]]s. Additional local channels, such as local [[broadcast television]] stations, [[educational television|educational channel]]s from local colleges, and [[community access]] channels devoted to local governments ([[public, educational, and government access|PEG]] channels) are usually included on the cable. [[television advertisement|Commercial]] advertisements for local business are also inserted in the programming at the headend (the individual channels, which are distributed nationally, also have their own nationally oriented commercials).

===Hybrid fiber coaxial systems===
Modern cable systems are large, with a single network and headend often serving an entire [[metropolitan area]] or [[county]]. Most systems use [[hybrid fiber coaxial]] (HFC) distribution; this means the trunklines that carry the signal from the headend to local neighborhoods are [[optical fiber]] to provide greater [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and also extra capacity for future expansion. At the headend the [[radio frequency]] electrical signal carrying all the channels is modulated on a light beam and sent through the fiber. The fiber trunkline goes to several ''distribution hubs'', from which multiple fibers fan out to carry the signal to boxes called ''optical nodes'' in local communities. At the optical node, the light beam from the fiber is translated back to an electrical signal and carried by [[coaxial cable]] distribution lines on utility poles, from which cables branch out to subscriber residences.

==Cable television deployments==
It is mostly available in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[East Asia]], and less so in [[South America]] and the [[Middle East]]. Cable TV has had little success in [[Africa]], as it is not cost-effective to lay cables in sparsely populated areas. So-called "wireless cable" or [[Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service|microwave]]-based systems are used instead.

===Asia and Australia===

====Australia====
Cable television began in the early 1990s in Australia. Several companies appeared including [[FOXTEL]], [[Galaxy (Australian television)|Galaxy TV]], [[Optus|OPTUS TV]], [[SelecTV (Australian television)|SelecTV]] and [[Austar]] offering services to homes across the major states of Australia. Services to Tasmania and the Northern Territory took longer to start, not until the mid-2000s when the digital satellite pay television service had picked up momentum and was beginning to be used for metropolitan installs and not just rural installs.

FOXTEL dominates the cable television landscape and is now rebroadcast by Austar (in rural areas) and formerly OPTUS TV, until the latter ceased broadcasting in 2011. Galaxy TV and Selectv likewise no longer operate. The effective FOXTEL monopoly has drawn criticism within Australia for being anti-competitive and inflating prices.

====Hong Kong====
Cable television was introduced to Hong Kong in 1957 when [[Rediffusion Television]] (predecessor to [[Asia Television Limited]]) began transmissions as Hong Kong's first television station. This arrangement ended in 1973 when Rediffusion Television was granted a free-to-air terrestrial broadcast licence by the Hong Kong government. Cable television returned to Hong Kong in 1993 when Wharf Cable Television (now known as [[Cable TV Hong Kong]]) began operations as Hong Kong's first subscription-based multichannel television platform. Cable TV Hong Kong currently competes with the [[IPTV]] platforms [[HKBN bbTV]] and [[now TV]] as well as the satellite platform [[TVB Pay Vision]].

====Malaysia====
Cable television was introduced to Malaysia in 1995 when [[Mega TV (Malaysia)|Mega TV]] was launched as Malaysia's first subscription-based pay television service. Mega TV closed down in 2001 due to stiff competition from the Malaysian satellite television operator [[Astro (Malaysian satellite television)|Astro]] as well as a failure to expand its range of channels. In 2013, [[ABNXcess]] was launched as Malaysia's second cable television operator and marked the return of cable television to Malaysia after an absence of 12 years.

====Maldives====
There are only two cable TV operators in the country.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} As the population of the Maldives is separated across around 200 inhabited islands, there is a cable TV operator for nearly every island. [[MediaNet]] Pvt. Ltd. is the country's largest cable TV operator, providing state of the art digital service. MediaNet is a Male-based cable TV operator that provides cable and Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service ([[MMDS]]) service to five islands near Male. MediaNet holds a distribution license for 75 channels and distributes channels to nearly all the operators of the country. In Maldives, cable TV subscribers can get most [[Pay television|premium]] channels available in [[Asia]].

====Mongolia====
There are several cable TV providers in Mongolia. The main three are "SuperVision", "Hiimori" and "Sansar CATV". All three cover approximately 15 national channels and 40 foreign channels, such as CNN, BBC, and NHK. "Sansar" has the biggest network in Ulaanbaatar. SuperVision is the first digital cable television in Mongolia and other CATVs are planning to launch digital cable television with CA systems.

====Philippines====
“NUVUE”, the first cable television system, was set up in [[Baguio | Baguio City]] spearheaded by American expatriate Russel Swartley in 1969. Popularity of CATV started in the 1980s after the Marcos administration. Cable giant [[SkyCable]] started in 1992. Cable providers have grown, and some examples are [[Destiny Cable|Destiny]], [[Cablelink]], and some regional cable providers. In 2007, SkyCable introduced the DigiBox, a cable TV [[set-top box]] that provides a [[digital television]] (DTV) signal for higher video quality and prevents illegal cable TV connections. In 2008, SkyCable also broadcast the [[2008 Ryder Cup|37th Ryder Cup]] in [[high-definition television]] (HDTV). In 2009, SkyCable became the first cable TV service provider in the Philippines to broadcast the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines|UAAP]] Games in [[High-definition television|HDTV]] via the new SkyHD Cable TV service.

====Singapore====
Cable television was introduced to Singapore in 1991 when [[Singapore Cable Vision]] (now known as [[StarHub TV]]) was licensed to develop and establish a cable-based subscription television network in Singapore. The project was deemed complete in 1999 and SCV was granted the exclusivity in the provision of pay-TV services in Singapore for 3 years until 2002. That same year, [[StarHub]], a Singapore telecommunications company, acquired SCV and the cable television network was subsequently renamed as StarHub Cable Vision, and again as StarHub TV in 2007. [[Digital cable]] was introduced to Singapore in November 2004 and completely replaced the previous analogue cable service by June 2009.<ref> [http://asia.cnet.com/starhub-dropping-analog-cable-tv-service-62106263.htm StarHub dropping analog Cable TV service]. CNET Asia. 2009-02-17. Retrieved 2013-10-07.</ref> As the private ownership of satellite dishes is banned in Singapore, StarHub TV and its [[IPTV]] counterpart [[mio TV]] (launched in 2007) comprise the only multichannel television platforms available in Singapore as of October 2013.

====Taiwan====
Cable television is prevalent in Taiwan, as a result of cheap subscription rates (typically around [[New Taiwan Dollar|NT$]]550, or US$15 a month) and the paucity of free-to-air television, which comprises four channels. Programming is mostly in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]], with some [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and other foreign-language channels.  Miniseries, called [[Taiwanese drama]], are popular. There is a dedicated station for Taiwan's [[Hakka people|Hakka]] minority as well as the arrival in 2005 of an [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal]] channel. Almost all programmes are in their original language with [[traditional Chinese]] subtitles.

Cable television was first trialled in 1969 in the [[Taipei]] suburb of [[Shipai, Beitou|Shipai]], and was legalised by the Taiwanese government in August 1993 when the [[Government Information Office]] ratified the Cable Television Act. In October 1994 209 companies took part in a series of competitive tenders which were called as a result of the implementation of the said Cable Television Act. On May 13, 1998 Keelung Cable Television ([[:zh:吉隆有線電視]]) became the first Taiwanese cable television operator to obtain a broadcasting license which covered the city of [[Keelung]] in northern Taiwan. In 2001 there were 66 cable television operators in Taiwan, mainly operating at a regional level.

The Taiwanese government is pushing for a switch to digital cable television services by 2015; this will be provided through a set-top box and will increase the number of available channels.

===Europe===

====Denmark====
Cable television was introduced to Denmark in 1963 when Jysk Telefon, a Danish telecommunications company, started cable television services on the [[Jutland]] peninsula. However it was not until 1985 that cable television became the preferred method of receiving television in Denmark, when the then-four regional telecommunications operators in Denmark began a considerable expansion of the Danish cable television network. In 1990 the four regional telecommunications operators were merged into a single entity named Tele Danmark (now known as [[TDC A/S]]) and in 1995 Denmark's first nationwide cable television company named Tele Danmark Kabel TV (now known as [[YouSee]]) was formed. As of 2011 93% of Danish households subscribe to cable television, the highest rate in the world. The cable television market in Denmark is dominated by three operators, namely YouSee, Stofa and Dansk Bredbånd respectively.

====Finland====
Finland has a [[Television in Finland#Cable|cable television infrastructure]], which is also used for [[cable internet]].

====Ireland====
{{main|Cable television in Ireland}}
Cable television is the most common{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} system for distributing multi-channel television in Ireland. With more than 40 years of history and extensive networks of both wired and "wireless" cable, Ireland is amongst the most cabled countries in Europe. Forty percent<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comreg.ie/publications/default.asp?S=&NavID=&ctype=5&NID=102445 |title=Commission for Communications Regulation |publisher=Comreg.ie |date= |accessdate=2012-02-12}}</ref> of Irish homes received cable television in September 2006. The figure dropped slightly in the early years of the 21st century due to the increased popularity of satellite reception, notably [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]], but has stabilized recently.

In the Republic of Ireland, [[UPC Ireland]] is by far the largest cable and MMDS operator, owning all of the state's MMDS licenses and almost all of the state's cable TV operators. UPC offers analogue and digital cable television services in cities and towns throughout the country (with the exception of Cork, where the network is digital-only). It offers MMDS services in rural areas. In areas previously served by NTL, the network is digital-only, while Chorus areas still have both analogue and digital services. Other than UPC, the only other operator providing analogue and digital cable is Casey Cablevision, which operates in [[Dungarvan]], [[County Waterford]]. There also exists a small number of analogue-only cable networks such as the [[Longford]] service Crossan Cable.

====Italy====
As of October 2013, no cable television platform exists in Italy.

In the 1950s and 1960s the Italian state broadcaster [[RAI]] was the only one authorized to broadcast television in Italy, hence making RAI a monopolist. That monopoly status was broken in 1971, when Giuseppe Sacchi, a former RAI editor, launched on April 21 that year the first "free" television station in Italy, called Telebiella and based in [[Biella]], which was only possible through a legal loophole in Italian broadcasting law that did not specifically prohibit the existence of cable television. Telebiella and later of such stations provided Italy's first cable TV services free from the influence of the Italian state. However, these early cable TV stations, which operated as [[Pirate television|pirate broadcasters]] in a sense were soon heavily stifled by the Italian government and most were forced to shut down. Later the Italian government introduced laws to regulate and allow for cable television, albeit with heavy restrictions: only one cable system for every city and only one TV channel for each system.

Only in the 1990s was a nationwide cable TV system developed, first by [[Telecom Italia]] and later by [[Fastweb (telecommunications company)|FASTWEB]]. In 2001 [[TV di Fastweb]] became the first commercial cable TV platform in Italy, however, after just over a decade in operation TV di Fastweb shut down in November 2012 due to competition from other similar services such as [[Sky Italia]] and [[Mediaset Premium]] as well as internet video-on-demand services such as [[Hulu]].

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, cable TV is the most widely used television distribution system. As of 2012, about 5.3 million households (about 70% of the Netherlands) have a cable TV subscription.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.totaaltv.nl/nieuws/8776/Kabel_verliest_abonnees_aan_IPTV,_satelliet_en_Digitenne_stabiel.html |title=Kabel verliest abonnees aan IPTV, satelliet en Digitenne stabiel |last1=Kriek |first1=Jarco |date=19 April 2012 |website=Totaal TV |publisher=Totaal TV |accessdate=5 September 2013}}</ref> This number is slowly dropping since the rise of cheaper alternatives such as [[IPTV]]. The basic subscription of all major providers costs between [[Euro|€]]15 and €20 and includes analog and digital TV and radio.

The cable infrastructure is owned by the television providers. This means that depending on where you live, there is only one available provider. The largest providers are [[UPC Netherlands|UPC]] and [[Ziggo]]. Lately, there have been efforts to 'open up' these monopolies and force the providers to allow other providers on their networks, but this hasn't been successful so far.

====Portugal====
Cable television was introduced to Portugal in 1992 when [[TV Cabo Madeirense]] began operations on the island of [[Madeira]]. Cable television was extended to mainland Portugal in 1994 under the name ''TVCabo'' (now part of [[ZON Multimédia]]). In 1995 [[Cabovisão]] began operations in the cities of [[Palmela]] and [[Setúbal]]. In the late 1990s [[TVTEL]], [[PluriCanal]] and [[Bragatel]] also began to offer cable television services.

In 2005 ZON became the first Portuguese cable television provider to adopt [[digital cable]]. The [[Autoridade Nacional de Comunicações]] (ANACOM) has requested all Portuguese cable television providers to switch over to digital cable as soon as possible. Because TVtel, PluriCanal and Bragatel decided not to renew their licenses after the said announcement ZON has decided to acquire them and all their customers have been transitioned to ZON cable television, making ZON the largest cable television provider in Portugal.

====Spain====
In 1972, the ''Dirección General de Radiodifusión y Televisión'' (now part of [[RTVE]]) started collaborating with the Spanish telecommunications provider [[Telefónica]] in implementing cable television in Spain, first in the cities of Madrid and Barcelona and eventually in other Spanish cities. The initial cable television system implemented in Madrid and Barcelona covered a total area of 8&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (with future provision for extending coverage area to 32&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), and allowed a total of 9 channels to be received. The project was deemed complete by 1976, although due to the political situation in Spain at that time the first cable television networks in Spain only came into existence in the early 1980s. These early Spanish cable television networks mainly operated at a regional level, whereas each cable operator served a defined area.

As more cable operators sprung up in Spain in the intervening years and without a national policy to coordinate cable television, the Spanish government eventually ratified the Spanish General Telecommunications by Cable Act 42/95 in 1995 and established a legal framework over which all Spanish cable television providers would be regulated. In 2003, the Spanish General Telecommunications Act 32/2003 was implemented and repealed many of the provisions of the previous Cable Act 42/95, while establishing a new regulatory framework for cable television, public radio, information technology services, etc.

Currently, the largest cable television provider in Spain is [[ONO (Spain)|ONO]], which operates in several regions and [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of Spain. Other well-known Spanish cable television providers include [[Euskaltel]] which mainly operates in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[TeleCable (Spain)|Telecable]] which operates in northern Spain and [[R (cable operator)|R]] which operates in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in northwestern Spain. All major cable television operators and many smaller ones offer [[Triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] and [[quadruple play]] services.

====Sweden====
Cable television was introduced to Sweden in 1961 when ''Informations-TV AB'' started a cable television service in the city of [[Malmö]] that same year, which mainly transmitted locally-produced programming and from 1981 re-transmitted satellite broadcasts beginning with the Soviet TV channel [[Horizont]]. In the 1970s and 1980s a few cable television networks sprung up in different Swedish cities, sometimes operating on an experimental basis.

In 1983 the then-telecommunications monopoly [[Televerket (Sweden)|Televerket]] launched Sweden's first nationwide cable television network called [[Televerket Kabel-TV]] (now known as [[Com Hem]]). On January 1, 1986 the Swedish government ratified the Swedish Local Cable Broadcasting Act ([[Swedish Code of Statutes|SFS]] 1985:677) which formally legalised cable television in Sweden. Currently the largest cable television provider in Sweden is the aforementioned Com Hem with a 75% market share. Other Swedish cable television providers include [[Tele2Vision]], [[Canal Digital]] and [[Sappa (cable provider)|Sappa]].

====Turkey====
Cable television was introduced to Turkey in the early 1980s when several cable companies appeared such as Sky, Amunarie, ODus and Mediafield.

====United Kingdom====
When the infant [[BBC Television]] service was started in 1936, [[Rediffusion]], which had supplied cable radio services since 1928, started providing "Pipe TV" to its customers who had difficulties tuning into the weak TV broadcast signal.<ref>{{cite web|author=Writer Russ J Graham EMAIL MORE ARTICLES WEBSITE |url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tmc/tvh/history/history.php |title=A short history of Rediffusion by Russ J Graham |publisher=Transdiffusion.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-12}}</ref>

Suspended during World War II, the BBC service was re-established in June 1946, and had only one transmitter, at [[Alexandra Palace]], which served the London area. From the end of 1949, new transmitters were steadily opened to serve other major conurbations, and then smaller areas of population. The areas on the fringes of the transmitter coverage provided an opportunity for [[Rediffusion]] and other commercial companies to expand cable systems to enlarge the viewing audience for the one [[BBC]] television channel which then existed. The first was in Gloucester in 1950<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aldricharchive.com/cable_systems.html |title=The Michael Aldrich Archive - Cable Systems |publisher=Aldricharchive.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref> and the process gathered pace over the next few years, especially after a second television channel, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], was launched in 1955 to compete with BBC. By the late 1970s, two and a half million British homes received their television service via cable.<ref>1982 Aldrich MJ co-author ''Cable Systems'' p18 HMSO London ISBN 0-11-630821-4</ref>

By law, these cable systems were restricted to the relay of the public broadcast channels, which meant that as the transmitter network became more comprehensive, the incentive to subscribe to cable was reduced and they began to lose customers. In 1982, a radical liberalization of the law on cable was proposed by the Information Technology Advisory Panel,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aldricharchive.com/cable_story.html |title=The Michael Aldrich Archive - The Cable Story |publisher=Aldricharchive.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref> for the sake of promoting a new generation of [[broadband]] cable systems leading to the wired society.<ref>1982 Aldrich MJ co-author ''Cable Systems'' HMSO London ISBN 0-11-630821-4</ref> After setting up and receiving the conclusions of the Hunt Inquiry into Cable Expansion and Broadcasting Policy, the Government decided to proceed with liberalization and two pieces of legislation: the Cable and Broadcasting Act and the Telecommunications Act, were enacted in 1984.

The result was that cable systems were permitted to carry as many new television channels as they liked, as well as providing a telephone service and interactive services of many kinds (as since made familiar by the Internet). To maintain the momentum of the perceived commercial interest in this new investment opportunity, in 1983, the Government itself granted eleven interim franchises for new broadband systems each covering a community of up to around 100,000 homes, but the competitive franchising process was otherwise left to the new regulatory body, the [[Cable Authority]], which took on its powers from January 1, 1985.

The franchising process proceeded steadily, but the actual construction of new systems was slow, as doubts about an adequate payback from the substantial investment persisted. By the end of 1990 almost 15 million homes had been included in franchised areas, but only 828,000 of these had been passed by broadband cable and only 149,000 were actually subscribing.<ref>Cable Authority, Final Report and Accounts 1990</ref> Thereafter, however, construction accelerated and take-up steadily improved.

The first new television channels launched for carriage on cable systems (going live in March 1984) were [[Sky1|Sky Channel]], [[Screensport]], [[Music Box (TV channel)|Music Box]] and [[The Movie Channel (UK)|The Movie Channel]]. Others followed, some were merged or closed down, but the range expanded. A similar flux was seen among the operators of cable systems: franchises were granted to a host of different companies, but a process of consolidation saw the growth of large multiple system operators, until by the early 2000s, virtually the whole industry was in the hands of two companies, NTL and [[Telewest]].

In 2005, it was announced that NTL and Telewest would merge, after a period of co-operation in the preceding few years. This merger was completed on March 3, 2006, with the company being named '''ntl Incorporated'''. For the time being, the two brand names and services were marketed separately. However, following NTL's acquisition of [[Virgin Mobile]], the NTL and Telewest services were rebranded ''[[Virgin Media]]'' on February 8, 2007, creating a single cable operator covering more than 95% of the UK cable market.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

There are a small number of other surviving cable television companies in the UK outside of NTL including [[WightFibre]] ([[Isle of Wight]]) and [[Smallworld Cable]] ([[Ayrshire]], [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]] and [[Lancashire]]).

Cable TV faces intense competition from [[BSkyB]]'s [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] [[satellite television]] service. Most channels are carried on both platforms. However, cable often lacks "interactive" features (e.g. text services, and extra video-screens), especially on BSkyB owned channels, and the satellite platform lacks services requiring high degrees of two-way communication, such as true [[video on demand]].

However, subscription-funded [[digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) proved less of a competitive threat. The first system, [[ITV Digital]], went into liquidation in 2002.  Also, [[Top Up TV]] was launched in 2004 and closed on {{date|2013-11-01}} because of low take-up, a dwindling offering, and competition from services such as [[Lovefilm]] and [[Netflix]].{{cn|date=November 2013}}

Another potential source of competition in the future will be TV over broadband internet connections; this is known as Internet Protocol television ([[IPTV]]). Some IPTV services are currently available in [[London]], while services operated in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] ceased in April 2006.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} As the speed and availability of broadband connections increase, more TV content can be delivered using protocols such as IPTV. However, its impact on the market is yet to be measured, as is consumer attitude toward watching TV programs on [[personal computer]]s instead of [[television set]]s. At the end of 2006, BT (the UK's former state owned monopoly phone company) started offering [[BT Vision]], which combines the digital free-to-air standard [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] through an aerial, and on-demand IPTV, delivered over a BT Broadband connection through the Vision set-top box (BT have chosen to deploy Microsoft's Mediaroom platform for this).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===North America===

====Canada====
{{Further|Multichannel television in Canada}}
In 1949, Broadcast Relay Service began negotiations for the implementation of what was to be the first large scale cable TV system in North America.
The development of the system relied on reaching agreement with Quebec Hydro-Electric Commission to utilise their existing network of power poles supplying power to the Montreal Metro area.
Initial discussions began with a meeting with Montreal City Council on June 21, 1949. After many months of negotiation, agreement was reached between Hydro Quebec and [[Rediffusion]] on February 28, 1950 for an initial 5-year period.
The Rediffusion cable system was operational in 1952 and eventually supplied 80,000 homes in Montreal Quebec.
Cable television in Canada began in 1952 with community antenna connections in [[Vancouver]] and [[London, Ontario]]; which city is first is not clear. Initially, the systems brought American stations to viewers in Canada who had no Canadian stations to watch; broadcast television, though begun late in 1952 in Toronto and Montreal, did not reach a majority of cities until 1954.

In time, cable television was widely established to carry available Canadian stations as well as import American stations, which constituted the vast majority of signals on systems (usually only one or two Canadian stations, while some systems had duplicate or even triplicate coverage of American networks). During the 1970s, a growing number of Canadian stations pushed American channels off the systems, forcing several to expand beyond the original 12-channel system configurations. At the same time, the advent of fibre-optic technology enabled companies to extend their systems to nearby towns and villages that by themselves were not viable cable television markets.

====United States====
{{main|Cable television in the United States}}
Cable television in the [[United States]] is a common form of [[television]] delivery, generally by subscription. Cable television first became available in the United States in 1948, with [[subscription]] services in 1949. Data by [[SNL Financial|SNL Kagan]] shows that as of 2006 about 58.4% of all [[United States]] homes subscribe to basic cable television services. Most cable viewers in the US are in the [[suburb]]s and tend to be [[Middle class in the United States|middle class]];<ref name="www.marketingcharts.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.marketingcharts.com/television/snl-kagan-cable-subscription-data-contradicts-fcc-chairman-kevin-martin-2634/snl-kagan-cable-summary-data-2006jpg/ |title=Chart close-up from SNL Kagan Cable Subscription Data Contradicts FCC Chairman Kevin Martin |publisher=Marketingcharts.com |date=2012-01-29 |accessdate=2012-02-12}}</ref> cable television is less common in [[low income]], [[inner city]], and [[rural]] areas.<ref name="www.marketingcharts.com"/>

[[Cable television franchise fee]]s stem from a community's basic right to charge for use of the property it owns. The cable television franchise fees represent part of the compensation a community receives in exchange for the cable operator's occupation and the [[easement|right-of-way]] use of [[public property]]. A franchise fee is not a [[tax]]; it is a [[Renting|rental charge]].

===South America===

====Argentina====
Cable television was first introduced to [[Argentina]] in 1965, in the city of [[Junín, Buenos Aires Province|Junín]]. In the 1990s cable television became very popular in Argentina and by 1996 53% of Argentinian homes had access to cable television.<ref>{{cite web|author=Clarin|title=La otra televisión|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/96/09/27/cables.htm|year=1996}} Retrieved 2013-09-05.</ref> The rapid growth of cable television in Argentina continued throughout the 2000s and currently 83% of Argentinian households subscribe to cable television, the fourth highest rate in the world, surpassed only by Canada, the United States and Denmark.

====Chile====
Cable television was first demonstrated in [[Chile]] in the early 1960s, and was formally introduced in 1986 in the commune of [[Providencia, Chile|Providencia]] in [[Santiago Province, Chile|Santiago Province]]. The first cable television operator in Chile was Intercom, owned by the newspaper company [[El Mercurio]], and featured 4 in-house produced channels. In the 1990s cable television became very popular in Chile and more cable operators sprung up in those years to provide cable television in Chile. Currently there are many cable television providers in Chile, the largest being [[VTR (telecom company)|VTR]], followed by [[Claro Americas]].

====Dominican Republic====
Cable television in the [[Dominican Republic]] is provided by a variety of companies. These companies offer both English- and Spanish-language television, plus a range of channels in other languages, [[High-definition television|high definition]] channels, [[pay-per-view]] movies and events, sports packages and [[Pay television|premium]] movie channels such as [[HBO Latin America Group|HBO]], [[Playboy TV]], [[Cinecanal]], etc. Also, the channels are from not only the Dominican Republic, but also the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. In the Dominican Republic television spectrum, there are 46 [[VHF]], [[UHF]], and [[free-to-air]] (FTA) channels. The free of charge channels programming consists mainly of locally produced entertainment shows, news, and comedy shows; and foreign sit-coms, [[soap operas]], movies, cartoons, and sports programs.

The main service provider in the Dominican Republic is Telecable from Tricom. Aster is concentrated in Santo Domingo, but is expanding its service throughout the Dominican Republic. There are also new companies using new technologies that are expanding quickly such as Claro TV ([[IPTV]]), Wind Telecom ([[MMDS]]) and [[SKY México|SKY]] ([[Satellite TV]]).

====Panama====
Panamanian company Rexa introduced cable TV in Panama City in 1983. In other regions they also had local cable companies. Rexa's successor, Cable Onda, was dominant throughout the 1990s, and expanded to Chiriqui Province. Since 2000 the largest Panamanian cable TV companies are: Cable Onda (40% share), Cable and Wireless (started in late 2009) and CTV.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Other cable-based services==
Coaxial cables are capable of bi-directional carriage of signals as well as the transmission of large amounts of [[data]]. Cable television signals use only a portion of the [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] available over coaxial lines. This leaves plenty of space available for other digital services such as [[cable internet]], [[cable telephony]] and wireless services, using both unlicensed and licensed spectrum.

[[Broadband internet access]] is achieved over coaxial cable by using [[cable modem]]s to convert the [[television network|network]] data into a type of digital signal that can be transferred over coaxial cable. One problem with some cable systems is the older amplifiers placed along the cable routes are unidirectional thus in order to allow for uploading of data the customer would need to use an analog telephone modem to provide for the upstream connection. This limited the upstream speed to 31.2k and prevented the always-on convenience broadband internet typically provides. Many large cable systems have upgraded or are upgrading their equipment to allow for bi-directional signals, thus allowing for greater upload speed and always-on convenience, though these upgrades are expensive.

In [[North America]], [[Australia]] and [[Europe]], many cable operators have already introduced [[cable telephone]] service, which operates just like existing fixed line operators. This service involves installing a special telephone interface at the customer's premises that converts the analog signals from the customer's in-home wiring into a digital signal, which is then sent on the [[local loop]] (replacing the analog [[last mile]], or [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS)) to the company's switching center, where it is connected to the public switched telephone network ([[PSTN]]). The biggest obstacle to cable telephone service is the need for nearly 100% reliable service for emergency calls. One of the standards available for digital cable telephony, [[PacketCable]], seems to be the most promising and able to work with the [[Quality of Service]] (QOS) demands of traditional analog [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) service. The biggest advantage to digital cable telephone service is similar to the advantage of digital cable TV, namely that data can be compressed, resulting in much less bandwidth used than a dedicated analog circuit-switched service. Other advantages include better voice quality and integration to a [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) network providing cheap or unlimited nationwide and international calling. Note that in many cases, digital cable telephone service is separate from [[cable modem]] service being offered by many cable companies and does not rely on [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) traffic or the Internet.

Beginning in 2004 in the United States, the traditional cable television providers and traditional telecommunication companies increasingly compete in providing voice, video and data services to residences. The combination of TV, telephone and Internet access is commonly called '''[[Triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]]''' regardless of whether CATV or [[Telephone company|telcos]] offer it.

More recently, several US cable operators have begun offering wireless services to their subscribers. Most notably was the September 2008 launch of [[Optimum Wi-Fi]] by [[Cablevision]]. This service is made available, at no additional cost, to Optimum Broadband subscribers, and is available at over 14,000 locations across [[Long Island, NY]], parts of [[New Jersey|NJ]] and [[Connecticut|CT]]. Cablevision has reported a double digit reduction in subscriber churn since launching Optimum Wi-Fi, even as [[Verizon]] has rolled out [[FiOS]], a competitive residential broadband service in the Cablevision footprint. Other Tier 1 cable operators, including [[Comcast]], have announced trials of a similar service in sections of the US Northeast.

==History and beginnings of cable TV-originated live programs==
During the 1980s, in the United States, mandated regulations not unlike [[public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) channels created the beginning of the cable-originated [[live television]] program that evolved into what is known today in the 2010s where many cable networks provide live cable-only broadcasts of many varieties, cable-only produced [[television movie]]s, and [[miniseries]]. Various live [[local program]]s with local interests were rapidly being created all over the United States in most major [[television market]]s in the early 1980s.  One of the first was in Columbus, Ohio where Richard Sillman became the nation's youngest cable TV Director at age sixteen.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ddWvXulV5WYC&pg=PA340&lpg=PA340&dq=richard+sillman+cable#v=onepage&q=richard%20sillman%20cable&f=false |title=Media Management in the Age of Giants, Business Dynamics of Journalism |publisher=Iowa State University Press, first edition 2003.  Second edition, University of New Mexico Press, 2012 |date= |accessdate=2013-05-13}}</ref>

With the development of the internet, by the late 1990s and early 2000, much of that regulation had been replaced where newer industry technologies developed, offering viewers alternate choices for local events and programming leading to what is today, that being Digital Cable, Internet, and Phone being offered to consumers, bundled, by 2010.
