'''Bassas da India''' is an uninhabited, roughly circular [[atoll]] that is part of the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]]. Located in the southern [[Mozambique Channel]], about halfway between [[Mozambique]] and [[Madagascar]] (about {{convert|385|km|0|abbr=on}} further east) and around {{convert|110|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Europa Island]], the rim of the atoll averages around 100&nbsp;m in width and encloses a shallow [[lagoon]] of depth no greater than 15&nbsp;m. Overall, the atoll is about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, rising steeply from the [[seabed]] 3000&nbsp;m below to encircle an area (including lagoon) of {{convert|80|km²|0|abbr=on}}. Its [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ), {{convert|123700|km²|0|abbr=on}} in size, is [[Contiguity|contiguous]] with that of Europa Island.

The atoll consists of ten barren rocky islets, with no vegetation, totalling 0.2&nbsp;km² (.077 sq mi) in area. Those on the north and east sides are 2.1 to 3&nbsp;m high, while those on the west and south sides are 1.2&nbsp;m high. The reef, whose coastline measures {{convert|35.2|km|0|abbr=on}}, is completely covered by the sea from three hours before [[Tide|high tide]] to three hours afterward. The region is also subject to [[cyclone]]s, making the atoll a long-time maritime hazard and the site of numerous shipwrecks.

[[Jaguar Seamount]] and [[Hall Tablemount]] lie, respectively, about 40 and 70&nbsp;km further southwest.

== History ==

The Bassas da India was first recorded by [[Portuguese explorers]] in the early sixteenth century as the "'''''Baixo da'' Judia'''" ("''Jewess'' Shoals"). The ''Judia'' ("''Jewess''", for the ancestry of its owner [[Fernão de Loronha]]<ref>Bernardo Gomes de Brito. ''Historia Tragico-Maritima. Em que se escrevem chronologicamente os Naufragios que tiverão as Naos de Portugal, depois que se poz em exercicio a Navegação da India.'' Lisboa 1735</ref>) was the Portuguese ship that discovered the feature by running aground on it in 1506.<ref>Natal Museum. ''Natal Museum journal of humanities'', Vol. 12. The Museum Council (Pietermaritzburg), 2000.</ref> The name became "'''Bassas da India'''" due to transcription errors by cartographers. The ''Santiago'' broke up on the shoal in 1585.

It was rediscovered by the ''Europa'' in 1774, whence the name "Europa Rocks".<ref>"...Europa [R]ocks, was {{sic}} discovered by the ship ''Europa'' in 1774." In ''Africa pilot, Part 3'' Hydrographic Office of Great Britain.</ref> The ''Malay'' was lost 27 July 1842 on the Europa Rocks.<ref>Historical Sketch of Salem, 1626-1879.</ref>

In 1897, the shoal became a [[Third French Republic|French]] possession, later being placed under the administration of a commissioner residing in [[Réunion]] in 1968. [[Madagascar]] continues to claim sovereignty over the islands.
