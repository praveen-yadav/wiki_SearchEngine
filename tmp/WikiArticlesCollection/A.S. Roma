'''Associazione Sportiva Roma''' ({{ISE|IT0001008876|ASR}}, {{lse|0DMN}}), commonly referred to as simply '''Roma''', is a professional [[Football in Italy|Italian football club]] based in Rome. Founded by a merger arranged by the Fascist regime in 1927, Roma have participated in the top-tier of Italian football for all of their existence except for [[1951–52 Serie B|1951–52]]. For their 62nd season in a row (81st overall), Roma are competing in [[Serie A]] for the [[2013–14 Serie A|2013–14 season]].

Roma have won [[Serie A]] three times, first in [[1941–42 Serie A|1941–42]] then in [[1982–83 Serie A|1982–83]] and again in [[2000–01 Serie A|2000–01]], as well as winning nine [[Coppa Italia]] titles and two [[Supercoppa Italiana]] titles. On the [[UEFA|European stage]] Roma won an [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] in [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1960-61|1960–61]], coming close to [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] victory in [[European Cup 1983-84|1983–84]] (lost the [[1984 European Cup Final|one-legged final played at home]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] after a penalty shootout), and finishing as runners-up in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] for [[1990–91 UEFA Cup|1990–91]] ([[1991 UEFA Cup Final|two-legged aggregate defeat]] against [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]]).

Home games are currently played at the [[Stadio Olimpico]], a venue they share with city rivals [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]]. With a capacity of over 72,000, it is the [[List of football stadiums in Italy|second largest]] of its kind in Italy, with only the [[San Siro]] able to seat more. In September 2009 the club unveiled plans to build a [[Stadio Franco Sensi|new 55,000-capacity stadium]] in the western suburbs of Rome. Its design was modeled after [[Football in England|English football]] stadiums with the objective being to give fans a closer view of the pitch.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=680854&cc=3888|publisher=soccernet.com|title=Roma stadium to be inspired by English Model|date=29 September 2009}}</ref> In September 2011, it was announced that the new president, [[Thomas R. DiBenedetto]], had reached an agreement with the mayor of Rome, Gianni Alemanno, to have the new stadium completed by 2016. Like the previous plan by Sensi, this new stadium is to be modeled after English stadiums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/86/italy/2011/09/21/2676287/new-roma-stadium-planned-for-2014 |title=New Roma stadium planned for 2014 |publisher=Goal.com |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of A.S. Roma}}

A.S. Roma was founded in the summer of 1927 when a secretary of the  ruling [[National Fascist Party]], [[Italo Foschi]],<ref name = lastoria/> initiated the merger of three older [[Italian Football Championship]] clubs from the city of Rome; [[Roman F.C.|Roman FC]], [[S.S. Alba-Audace Roma|SS Alba-Audace]] and [[Fortitudo-Pro Roma S.G.S.|Fortitudo-Pro Roma SGS]].<ref name = lastoria/> The purpose of the merger was to give the Italian capital a strong club to rival that of the more dominant [[Northern Italy|Northern Italian]] clubs of the time.<ref name="lastoria">{{cite web|url=http://www.asroma.it/DocList.aspx?Categoria=42|publisher=ASRoma.it|title=La Storia|archivedate=23 December 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071223014855/http://www.asroma.it/DocList.aspx?Categoria=42|publisher=AS Roma|language=Italian}}</ref> The only major Roman club to resist the merger was [[S.S. Lazio]] because of the intervention of the army General Vaccaro, member of the club and executive of Italian Football Federation.
The club played its earliest seasons at the ''Motovelodromo Appio'' stadium,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://albionroad.com/club-profiles/roma.html|publisher=AlbionRoad.com|title=A.S. Roma|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> before settling in the working-class streets of [[Testaccio]], where it built an all-wooden ground ''Campo Testaccio''; this was opened in November 1929.<ref name = "Testaccio" /> An early season in which Roma made a large mark was the [[1930–31 Serie A|1930–31]] championship, the club finished as runners-up behind [[Juventus]].<ref name = league/> Captain [[Attilio Ferraris]] along with [[Guido Masetti]], [[Fulvio Bernardini]] and [[Rodolfo Volk]] were highly important players during this period.<ref>{{cite news|url=

===First title victory and decline===
After a slump in league form and the departure of high key players, Roma eventually rebuilt their squad adding goalscorers such as the Argentine [[Enrique Guaita]].<ref name="stars">{{cite news|url=http://www.asrtalenti.altervista.org/index.php?a=calciatoriG.htm|publisher=Viva la Roma|title=Tutti i calciatori dell'A.S. Roma|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> Under the management of [[Luigi Barbesino]], the Roman club came close to their first title in [[1935–36 Serie A|1935–36]]; finishing just one point behind champions [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.asromaultras.it/35-36.html|publisher=ASRomaUltras.it|title=1935–'36: Io Faccio I Gol Non La Guerra! |date=24 June 2007}}</ref>

Roma returned to form after being inconsistent for much of the late 1930s; Roma recorded an unexpected title triumph in the [[1941–42 Serie A|1941–42]] season by winning their first ever'' scudetto'' title.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.asrtalenti.altervista.org/index.php?a=campionato4142.htm|publisher=ASRTalenti|title=Campionato 1941–42 – Roma campione d'Italia|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> The eighteen goals scored by local player [[Amedeo Amadei]] were essential to the [[Alfréd Schaffer]] coached Roma side winning the title. At the time Italy was involved in World War II and Roma were playing at the ''[[Stadio Nazionale PNF|Stadio del Partito Nazionale Fascista]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.asromaultras.it/soprannomi.html|publisher=ASRomaUltras.it|title=I Campi da Gioco|date=24 June 2007}}</ref>

In the years just after the war, Roma were unable to recapture their league stature from the early 1940s. Roma finished in the lower half of Serie A for five seasons in a row, before eventually succumbing to their only ever relegation to [[Serie B]] at the end of the [[1950–51 Serie A|1950–51]] season;<ref name = league/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/ital52.html|publisher=RSSSF.com|title=Italy 1951–52 – Serie B|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> around a decade after their championship victory. Under future [[Italy national football team|national team]] manager [[Giuseppe Viani]], promotion straight back up was achieved.<ref name = "managers" />

After returning to the Serie A, Roma managed to stabilise themselves as a top half club again with players such as [[Egisto Pandolfini]], [[Dino Da Costa]] and Dane [[Helge Bronée]].<ref name = league/> Their best finish of this period was under the management of Englishman [[Jesse Carver]], when in [[1954–55 Serie A|1954–55]] they finished as runners-up, after [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] who originally finished second were relegated for corruption.<ref name = league/>
Although Roma were unable to break into the top four during the following decade, they did achieve some measure of cup success. Their first honour outside of Italy was recorded in [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1960-61|1960–61]] when Roma won the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] by beating [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 4–2 in the finals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec196061.html#icfc|publisher=RSSSF.com|title=Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1960–61|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> A few years later Roma won their first [[Coppa Italia]] trophy in 1963–64, by beating [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] 1–0.<ref name="coppaitalia">{{cite news|url=http://www.vilacom.net/football/coppa.php|publisher=Vilacom Sports|title=TIM Cup – Coppa Italia|date=24 June 2007}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref>

Their lowest point came during the 1964–65 season when manager [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] announced that the club could not pay its players and was unlikely to be able to afford to travel to [[Vicenza]] to fulfil its next fixture. Supporters kept the club going with a fundraiser at the Sistine Theatre and bankruptcy was avoided with the election of a new club president [[Franco Evangelisti (politician)|Franco Evangelisti]].

Their second Coppa Italia trophy was won in 1968–69 when it was competed in a small league like system.<ref name = "coppaitalia" /> [[Giacomo Losi]] set a Roma appearance record during 1969 with 450 appearances in all competitions, the record he set would last for 38 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://asroma.hunsport.hu/?us=23|publisher=ASRoma Hunsports|title=Rekordok, statisztikák|date=24 June 2007}}</ref>

===Time of mixed fortunes===
Roma were able to add another cup to their collection in 1972, with a 3–1 victory over [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/angloit72.html|publisher=RSSSF.com|title=Anglo-Italian Cup 1972|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> During much of the 1970s Roma's appearance in the top half of Serie A was sporadic. The best place the club were able to achieve during the decade was third in [[1974–75 Serie A|1974–75]].<ref name = league/> Notable players who turned out for the club during this period included midfielders [[Giancarlo De Sisti]] and [[Francesco Rocca]].

The dawning of a newly successful era in Roma's footballing history was brought in with another Coppa Italia victory, they beat [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] on penalties to win the 1979–80 cup.<ref name = "coppaitalia" /> Roma would reach heights in the league which they had not touched since the 1940s by narrowly and [[Turone's goal|controversially]] finishing as runners-up to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in [[1980–81 Serie A|1980–81]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=420526|publisher=Goal.com|title=Roma – Juventus: A Historical Look|date=24 June 2007}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> Former [[A.C.

Roma Legends|date=24 June 2007}}</ref>

The second ''scudetto'' did not elude Roma for much longer; in [[1982–83 Serie A|1982–83]] the Roman club won the title for the first time in 41 years, amidst celebrations in the capital.<ref name="officialtitles">{{cite web | url=http://www.lega-calcio.it/ita/atim_albo.shtml| title=Campionato Serie A – Albo D'oro| work=Lega Calcio | accessdate=August 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070824141336/http://www.lega-calcio.it/ita/atim_albo.shtml| archivedate= 24 August 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The [[1983–84 Serie A|following season]] Roma finished as runners-up in Italy<ref name = league/> and collected a Coppa Italia title,<ref name = "coppaitalia" /> they also finished as runners-up in the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] final of [[1984 European Cup Final|1984]].<ref name = "liverpoolfinal" /> The European Cup final with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] ended in a 1–1 draw with a goal from Pruzzo, but Roma eventually lost the penalty shoot-out.<ref name="liverpoolfinal">{{cite news|url=http://www.europeancuphistory.com/euro84.html|publisher=European Cup History|title=Season 1983–84|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> Roma's successful run in the 1980s would finish with a runners-up spot in [[1985–86 Serie A|1985–86]]<ref name = league/> and a Coppa Italia victory, beating out [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] 3–2.<ref name = "coppaitalia" />

After that a comparative decline began in the league, one of the few league highs from the following period being a third place finish in [[1987–88 Serie A|1987–88]].<ref name = league/> At the start of the 1990s the club was involved in an all-Italian [[UEFA Cup]] final, where they lost 2–1 to [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] in [[1990–91 UEFA Cup|1991]];<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=428273|publisher=Goal.com|title=Roma – Inter: A Historical Look|date=24 June 2007}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> the same season the club won its [[1990–91 Coppa Italia|seventh]] Coppa Italia trophy<ref name = "coppaitalia" /> and ended runners-up to [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] in the [[Supercoppa Italiana]]. Aside from finishing runners-up to [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] in a Coppa Italia final,<ref name = "coppaitalia" /> the rest of the decade was largely sub-par in the history of Roma; especially in the league where the highest they could manage was fourth in [[1997–98 Serie A|1997–98]].<ref name = league/> The early 1990s also saw the emergence of homegrown striker [[Francesco Totti]] who would go on to be an important member of the team and the club's iconic captain.

===In the new millennium===

====2000–2010====
[[File:curva sud roma campione.jpg|thumb|right|17 June 2001 – Roma-Parma 3–1: Roma won its third Italian championship in its history. Fans of the [[Curva (stadia)|Curva]] Sud are overjoyed]]
Roma returned to form in the 2000s, starting the decade in great style by winning their third ever Serie A title in [[2000–01 Serie A|2000–01]]; the ''scudetto'' was won on the last day of the season by beating [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] 3–1, edging out Juventus by two points.<ref name = league/> The club's captain, [[Francesco Totti]] was a large reason for the title victory and he would become one of the main heroes in the club's history,<ref name = "legends" /> going on to break several [[A.S.

The club attempted to defend the title in the [[2001–02 Serie A|following season]] but ended as runners-up to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] by just one point.<ref name = league/> This would be the start of Roma finishing as runners-up many times in both Serie A and [[Coppa Italia]] during the 2000s; they lost out 4–2 to [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]] in the Coppa Italia final of [[2002–03 Coppa Italia|2003]]<ref name = "coppaitalia" /> and lost out to Milan again by finishing second in [[Serie A]] for the [[2003–04 Serie A|2003–04]] season.<ref name="league">{{cite book| first = Panini Edizioni | last = Modena| title = Almanacco Illustrato del Calcio – La Storia 1898–2004| year = 2005}}</ref> The club also re-capitalized several time in 2003–04 season. In November 2003 €37.5 million was injected by "Roma 2000" to cover the half-year loss and loss carried from previous year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://109.75.174.100/~asroma/downloads/corporate_investor/1287661113.pdf|title=INFORMATIVA ROMA 2000 S.R.L.|date=12 November 2003|accessdate=18 April 2011|work=AS Roma|language=Italian}}</ref> and again on 30 June for €44.57 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://109.75.174.100/~asroma/downloads/corporate_investor/1287664872.pdf|title=APPROVAZIONE SITUAZIONE MENSILE AL 31 MAGGIO 2004<br/>Roma 2000 sottoscrive l’aumento di capitale per 44,57 milioni di euro|date=30 June 2004|accessdate=18 April 2011|work=AS Roma|language=Italian}}</ref> Through stock market, a further €19.850 million of new shares issued, and at the year end, the share capital was €19.878 million,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://109.75.174.100/~asroma/downloads/corporate_investor/1287640447.pdf|title=AS ROMA Spa.

The following season also saw the departure of [[Walter Samuel]] for €25 million and [[Emerson Ferreira da Rosa|Emerson]] for €28 million, which decreased the strength of the squad, thus ''Giallorossi'' finished as the eighth place, one of the worst of recent season.

[[File:Coppa Italia 2008 premiazione.jpg|thumb|[[Francesco Totti]], current captain, with the [[2007–08 Coppa Italia]]]]
A [[2006 Serie A scandal|Serie A scandal]] was revealed during 2006 and Roma were one of the teams not involved; after punishments were handed out, Roma was re-classified as runners-up for [[2005–06 Serie A|2005–06]];<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/5215178.stm|publisher=BBC.co.uk|title=Punishments cut for Italian clubs|date=24 June 2007 | accessdate=5 January 2010 | location=London}}</ref> the same season in which they finished second in the Coppa Italia losing to [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]].<ref name="coppaitalia" /> In the two following seasons, [[2006–07 Serie A|2006–07]] and [[2007–08 Serie A|2007–08]], Roma finished as Serie A runners-up, meaning that in the 2000s Roma have finished in the top two positions more than any other decade in their history<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Speciali/serie_a_2007/index.shtml|publisher=Gazzetta.it|title=Serie A 2006–07|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> Meanwhile in the [[UEFA Champions League]] during both of these seasons, they reached the quarter-finals before going out to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. Despite the sloppy start in [[UEFA Champions League 2008–09]], Roma managed to reach the knockout stage ahead of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in their group, thus finishing for the first time in their history as winners of the group stage. However, the ''Giallorossi'' would lose to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the knockout stage on penalty kicks, ending their Champions League campaign.

After a disappointing start to the 2009–10 season, [[Claudio Ranieri]] replaced [[Luciano Spalletti]] as head coach. At the time of the switch, Roma lay bottom of the Serie A table after losses to Juventus and Genoa. Despite this setback, Roma would later embark on an incredible unbeaten streak of 24 matches in the league – with the last of the 24 being a 2–1 win over rivals Lazio, whereby Roma came from 1–0 down at half-time to defeat their city rivals after Ranieri courageously substituted both Totti and De Rossi at the interval.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://roma.theoffside.com/team-news/a-tribute-to-claudio-ranieris-coconuts.html |title=A Tribute To Claudio Ranieri's Coconuts – The Offside – AS Roma blog |publisher=Roma.theoffside.com |date=19 April 2010 |accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref> The Giallorossi were on top of the table at one point, before a loss to U.C. Sampdoria later in the season. Roma would finish runners-up to Inter yet again in both Serie A and the Coppa Italia. This rounded out a highly successful decade in Roma's history, following somewhat mediocre results of the 1990s. During the 2000s, Roma had finally recaptured the Scudetto, two Coppa Italia trophies, and their first two Supercoppa Italiana titles. Other notable contributions to the club's history have included a return to the UEFA Champions League Quarter-finals (in the 2006–2007 and 2007–2008 editions) since 1984, six runners up positions in the league, four Coppa Italia finals and three Supercoppa finals – marking Roma's greatest ever decade.

====The "DiBenedetto AS Roma LLC" era====
In the summer of 2010, the Sensi family agreed to relinquish their control of AS Roma as part of a debt-settlement agreement. This brought an end to the presidential reign of the Sensi family who had presided over the club since 1993. Until a new owner was appointed, Rosella Sensi would continue her directorial role of the club. The 2010–11 season had once again seen Roma start off with mixed fortunes on both a domestic and European level. These included losses against teams like Cagliari, Brescia and a 2–0 defeat against Bayern Munich in the group stages of the Champions League (a match which saw manager Claudio Ranieri openly criticised by his own players). However, these were accompanied by victories against Inter Milan and a sensational victory against Bayern Munich in the return fixture, which saw Roma fight back from 0–2 down at half-time to emerge as 3–2 winners. Following a series of poor results which saw Roma engage in a winless-streak of five consecutive matches, Claudio Ranieri resigned as head coach in February 2011, and former striker Vincenzo Montella was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. It was also during this season that Roma icon, Francesco Totti, scored his 200th Serie A goal against Fiorentina in March 2011 – becoming only the sixth ever player to achieve such a feat.

On 16 April 2011, the takeover contract was closed with a USA investment group lead by [[Thomas R. DiBenedetto]]. "DiBenedetto AS Roma LLC" consists of 4 other shareholders (or 3 not counting the family trust), namely [[James Pallotta]] (25%) (of "Tudor Investment"), Michael Ruane (25%) (director of "TA Realty"; partially own the "DiBenedetto AS Roma LLC" through family trust for 22.5%) and Richard D'Amore (25%) (of "North Bridge Venture Partners" and [[Veeco]]).<ref>http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=84385&privcapId=22127&previousCapId=251349&previousTitle=ANADARKO%20PETROLEUM%20CORP</ref> DiBenedetto became the 22nd president of the club, served from September 27, 2011 to August 27, 2012and was succeeded by [[James Pallotta]].<ref>http://www.gazzettagiallorossa.it/2012/08/gazzetta-dello-sport-pallotta-e-tua-tra-basket-e-soccer-la-scalata-di-mister-james-per-fare-grande-la-roma/</ref>
 
The new ownership immediately went into effect by making significant changes in the club, hiring [[Walter Sabatini]] as director of football and former Spanish international and [[FC Barcelona B]] coach [[Luis Enrique Martínez García|Luis Enrique]] as manager; the first high-profile signings from the duo were attacking midfielder [[Erik Lamela]] from [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]], forward [[Bojan Krkic]] from [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], goalkeeper [[Maarten Stekelenburg]] from [[AFC Ajax]] and unattached defender [[Gabriel Heinze]]. The club also sold and released high earner, namely defender [[John Arne Riise]], keeper [[Doniéber Alexander Marangon|Doni]], forward [[Jérémy Ménez]] and [[Mirko Vucinic]].

However, Roma was eliminated from [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League]] play-off round. After the formal takeover on 18 August, Roma bought forward [[Pablo Daniel Osvaldo]], midfielder [[Miralem Pjanic]], [[Fernando Gago]] and defender [[Simon Kjær]], as well as youngster [[Fabio Borini]], made the club costed more than 40 million if the loan deal were successfully turned to definitive deal.

On 12 June 2013, Roma's president [[James Pallotta]] announced that [[Rudi Garcia]] had been appointed the new manager of Roma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asroma.it/en/news/06/12/2013_rudi_garcia/|title=RUDI GARCIA|publisher=[[asroma.it]]|date=12 June 2013 | accessdate = 02 November 2013}}</ref> He enjoyed a fantastic start to his Roma career, winning his first ten consecutive games (an all time [[Serie A]] record) including a 2−0 derby win against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], a 3−0 victory away to [[Inter Milan]] and a 2−0 home win over title rivals [[SSC Napoli|Napoli]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24694928|title=Roma set record for best start to Serie A season|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=27 October 2013 | accessdate = 28 October 2013}}</ref> During this run, Roma scored 24 times while conceding just once, away to [[Parma F.C.|Parma]].

Roma|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> White shorts and black socks are usually worn with the red shirt, however in particularly high key games the shorts and socks are the same colour as the home shirt.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.viewimages.com/Search.aspx?mid=56943226&epmid=2&partner=Google|publisher=ViewImages.com|title=Roma – Lazio: February 2006|date=24 June 2007}}</ref>

The kit itself was originally worn by ''[[Roman F.C.|Roman Football Club]]''; one of the three clubs who merged to form the current incarnation in 1927.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.asromaultras.it/roman.html|publisher=ASRomaUltras.it|title=Il Roman – La storia (tratta da "La Roma")|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> Because of the colours they wear, Roma are often nicknamed ''i giallorossi'' meaning the yellow-reds.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.footballinitaly.com/roma.html|publisher=Football in Italy|title=A.S. Roma|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> Roma's away kit is traditionally white, with a third kit changing colour from time to time. Maybe because of modern sport marketing, the last few years have seen the golden trim and details substituted by light orange. Modern alternate kits have included all orange and orange-maroon versions.

A popular nickname for the club is ''i lupi'' (the wolves), the animal has always featured on the club's badge in different forms throughout their history. Currently the emblem of the team is the one which was used when the club was first founded. It portrays the female wolf with the two infant brothers [[Romulus and Remus]], illustrating the [[Founding of Rome|myth of the founding of Rome]],<ref name="legend_rome"/> superimposed on a bipartite golden yellow over maroon red shield.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/search/?query_id=21223833&page=2&brand_id=30492|publisher=BrandsoftheWorld.com|title=Roma|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> In the myth from which the club take their nickname and logo, the twins (sons of [[Mars (god)|Mars]] and [[Rhea Silvia]]) are thrown into the [[River Tiber]] by their uncle [[Amulius]], a she-wolf saved the twins and looked after them.<ref name="legend_rome"/> Eventually the two twins took revenge on Amulius, before falling out themselves; [[Romulus]] killed [[Remus]] and as thus was made king of a new city named in his honour, Rome.<ref name="legend_rome">{{cite news|url=http://museums.ncl.ac.uk/Reticulum/NORTHERNFRONTIER/WeCameWeSawWeConq/WhereDidTheyComeFrom/Story.htm|publisher=Museums.ncl.ac.uk|title=The Legend of Romulus and Remus|date=24 June 2007}}</ref>

==Facilities==

===Stadiums===
{{main|Stadio Olimpico|Campo Testaccio|Stadio Nazionale PNF|Stadio Flaminio}}
The very first sport facility A.S. Roma used was [[Motovelodromo Appio]] which was previously used by [[S.S. Alba-Audace Roma|Alba-Audace]]. A.S. Roma only played the [[1927–28 Divisione Nazionale|1927-28 season]] there until they moved to [[Stadio Nazionale PNF|Stadio Nazionale]] the very next season.

[[File:Stadio olimpico as roma.jpg|thumb|left|Olimpico, Roma's current stadium]]
In the 1953-54 season A.S. Roma moved to the Olympic arena, [[Stadio Olimpico]]. The arena has undergone several changes over the years. The most significant change took place in the nineties when Stadio Olimpico was demolished and then reconstructed to for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|Football World Cup 1990]], witch took place in Italy.

A.S. Roma has played almost every season since 1953−54, with exception of the 1989−90 seasons due to the reconstruction of Stadio Olimpico. That year Roma played its home games at [[Stadio Flaminio]].

30 December 2012 AS Roma president [[James Pallotta]] announced the construction of a new stadium in the [[Tor di Valle]] area of Rome. The new structure is scheduled for opening in 2016. The new stadium will have a capacity of 60,000 spectators.<ref>http://www.ilmessaggero.it/sport/asroma/roma_nuovo_stadio_tor_di_valle_totti_tifosi_sognavano/notizie/241248.shtml</ref>

===Training Centre===
A Training center located in [[Trigoria]] at kilometer 3600 in south-east of Rome, was purchased July 22, 1977 by the then club president [[Gaetano Anzalone]]. It was opened in 23 July 1979 and was the president Anzalones last act of his presidency.<ref>http://archiviostorico.unita.it/cgi-bin/highlightPdf.cgi?t=ebook&file=/archivio/uni_1979_07/19790724_0010.pdf</ref> The complex had its first expansion in 1984 when the club was chaired by [[Dino Viola]] and another in 1998 under the chairmanship of [[Franco Sensi]].<ref>http://www.ilsussidiario.net/News/roma/2011/11/4/TRIGORIA-Il-Trapezio-tra-i-Campi-della-Roma-e-il-Campus-Universitario/219070/</ref>

The Centre is also known for hosting the [[Argentina national football team|Argentinian football team]] during [[1990 FIFA World Cup|Football World Cup 1990]].

==Supporters and rivalries==
[[File:ASRomaOlimpico.jpg|thumb|left|Roma fans at the Stadio Olimpico]]
Roma is the fifth most supported football club in Italy behind [[Juventus FC|Juventus]], [[FC Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]], [[AC Milan|Milan]] and [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] with around 7% of Italian football fans supporting the club (according to the Doxa Institute-L'Espresso's research of April 2006).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/dettaglio-archivio/163496|publisher=L'Expresso|title=''L'altra metà del pallone'': Supporters of football clubs in Italy|date=April 2006}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> Historically the largest section of Roma supporters in the city of Rome have come from the [[Inner city|inner-city]], especially [[Testaccio]].<ref name="Testaccio">{{cite news|url=http://www.asrtalenti.altervista.org/index.php?a=campo_testaccio.htm|publisher=Viva la Roma|title=Campo Testaccio|date=24 June 2007}}</ref>

The traditional [[ultras]] group of the club was ''Commando Ultrà Curva Sud''<ref name = "fans" /> commonly abbreviated as ''CUCS''; this group was founded by the merger of many smallers groups and was considered one of the most historic in the history of [[European football]].<ref name = "fans" /> However, by the mid-1990s ''CUCS'' had been usurped by rival factions and ultimately broke up. Since that time, the ''[[Curva (stadia)|Curva]] Sud'' of the [[Stadio Olimpico]] has been controlled by more right-wing groups;<ref name = "fans" /> ''A.S. Roma Ultras'', ''Boys'', ''Giovinezza'' and others. The oldest group ''Fedayn'' is [[apolitical]] however and politics is not the main identity of Roma, just a part of their overall identity. In September 2009 the club unveiled plans to build a new [[Stadio Franco Sensi|55,000-capacity stadium]] in Rome's western suburbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssConsumerGoodsAndRetailNews/idUSLT15248220090929|title=Soccer-Roma plan new English-style stadium|date=29 September 2009|publisher=Reuters|author=Meadows, Mark}}</ref>

[[File:OlimpicoRoma.JPG|thumb|[[Stadio Olimpico]] during a Roma match]]
The most known club anthem is ''Roma (non si discute, si ama)'', also known as ''Roma Roma'',<ref>{{it}} {{cite web|url=http://www.sonoromanista.it/wiki/Inno_As_Roma|title=Inno AS Roma|website=Sonoromanista.it (AS Roma fans' social network)|accessdate=26 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-US/Squadra.aspx?IdSquadra=7&SEOTeamName=AS+Roma|publisher=Goal.com|title=Roma Profile|date=April 2006}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> by singer [[Antonello Venditti]]. The title roughly means "Roma is not to be questioned, it is to be loved" and is sung before each match. The song ''Grazie Roma'', by the same singer, is played at the end of victorious home games. Recently, the main riff of [[The White Stripes]] song ''[[Seven Nation Army]]'' has also become widely popular at games.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indie-rock.it/news_look.php?id=408|publisher=Indie-Rock.it|title= 'Seven Nation Army' coro dei tifosi romanisti|date=29 June 2007}}</ref>

===Rivalries===
In [[Italian football]] Roma is a club with many rivalries; first and foremost is their rivalry with [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], the club who they share the Stadio Olimpico stadium with. The [[Local derby|derby]] between the two is called the ''[[Derby della Capitale]]'', it is amongst the most heated and emotional [[Major football rivalries|footballing rivalries]] in the world. The fixture has seen some occasional instances of violence in the past including the death of [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] fan, Vincenzo Paparelli in [[1979–80 Serie A|1979–80]] as a result of an [[Flare gun|emergency flare]] fired from the Curva Sud,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ultraslazio.it/ukstory.htm|publisher=UltrasLazio.it|title=Ultras History|date=29 June 2007}}</ref> and the abandonment of a game in march [[2003–04 Serie A|2004]], following unfounded rumours of a fatality which led to violence outside the stadium.<ref name="derby">{{cite news|url=http://www.footballinrome.co.uk/news.html|publisher=FootballInRome.co.uk|title=22&nbsp;March: Derby confusion|date=29 June 2007}}</ref>

With [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], Roma also compete in the ''[[Derby del Sole]]'' rivalry meaning the "Derby of the Sun".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.footballderbies.com/index.php?country=2 |publisher=FootballDerbies.com|title= Football Derby matches in Italy|date=29 June 2007}}</ref> Nowadays fans also consider other Serie A giants like [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] (rivalry born especially in the 1980s), [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] (increased in recent years) among their rivals as these four compete for the top four spots in the league table to secure a spot in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].<ref name="fans">{{cite news|url=http://website.lineone.net/~view_from_the_terrace/italsce.html |publisher=View from the Terrace|title= Italian Ultras Scene|date=29 June 2007}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref>

There have been a number of instances of conflict in recent years between some Roma supporters and fans of English clubs, and the subsequent violence outside the stadium which saw a number of Liverpool fans stabbed.<ref name="Times call for final move">{{cite news|url=http://timesonline.typepad.com/thegame/2009/03/ahead-of-the-14.html|title=Times call for final move|date=19 March 2009}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> Since then, there have been further instances of some English supporters being attacked and stabbed in Rome, including incidents in 2001 when Liverpool visited Roma twice and subsequent clashes with Middlesbrough fans in 2006 and Manchester United fans in 2007. In March 2009, a coach carrying Arsenal supporters was attacked by a group of Roma "Ultras" just outside the Stadio Olimpico. The coach's windows were smashed and at least one person entered the vehicle, letting off a flare and stabbed a supporter in the knee.<ref name="Times call for final move" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7938851.stm|title=Arsenal fan attacked in Rome|date=12 March 2009 | work=BBC News | accessdate=5 January 2010 | location=London}}</ref>

In April 2008, after months of speculation, [[George Soros]] was confirmed by Rosella Sensi, CEO of Italian [[Serie A]] association football club A.S. Roma, to be bidding for a takeover.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Squadre/Roma/Primo_Piano/2008/04_Aprile/18/puntoroma.shtml |language=Italian |publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport |accessdate=26 April 2008 |date=18 April 2008| title=La stretta finale di Soros distrae lo sprint della Roma| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080421190310/http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Squadre/Roma/Primo_Piano/2008/04_Aprile/18/puntoroma.shtml| archivedate= 21 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The takeover bid was successively rejected by the Sensi family, who instead preferred to maintain the club's ownership.
