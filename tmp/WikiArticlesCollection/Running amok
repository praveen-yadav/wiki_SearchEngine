== Indonesian origin ==
Amok originated from the Indonesian word ''mengamuk'', which when roughly defined means “to make a furious and desperate charge”.<ref>Hempel, A. A., Levine, R. D., Meloy, J. D., & Westermeyer, J. D. (2000). Cross-cultural review of sudden mass assault by a single individual in the oriental and occidental cultures. Journal of Forensic Sciences, 45(3), 582–588.</ref> According to Indonesian culture, amok was rooted in a deep spiritual belief.<ref>Van Loon, F. H. G. (1927). "Amok and Latah".

As a result of the belief, those in Indonesian culture tolerated amok and dealt with the after effects with no ill will towards the assailant.<ref name="ncbi">{{cite journal | last = Saint Martin | first = Michael | year = 1999 | title = Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | issn = 0160-6689| pmc = 181064 | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pmid = 15014687 | pages = 66–70 }}</ref>

Although commonly used in a colloquial and less-violent sense, the phrase is particularly associated with a specific sociopathic [[culture-bound syndrome]] in [[Culture of Malaysia|Malaysian culture]]. In a typical case of ''running amok'', an individual (often male), having shown no previous sign of anger or any inclination to violence, will acquire a weapon (traditionally a sword or dagger, but presently any of a variety of weapons) and in a sudden frenzy, will attempt to kill or seriously injure anyone he encounters and himself.<ref>Saint Martin, M. (1999, June 1). Running Amok. Retrieved 1 April 2013 from PMC.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC181064/]</ref> Amok typically takes place in a well populated or crowded area. Amok episodes of this kind normally end with the attacker being killed by bystanders or committing [[suicide]], eliciting theories that amok may be a form of intentional suicide in cultures where suicide is heavily stigmatized.<ref>http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23464</ref> Those who do not commit suicide and are not killed typically lose consciousness, and upon regaining consciousness, claim amnesia.

An early Western description of the practice appears in the journals of [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]], a British explorer, who encountered amok firsthand in 1770 during a voyage around the world. Cook writes of individuals behaving in a reckless, violent manner, without cause and "indiscriminately killing and maiming villagers and animals in a frenzied attack." <ref>(Jackson, Y. (Ed.).(2006). Encyclopedia of multicultural psychology. University of Kansas: Sage Publications)</ref>

A widely accepted explanation links amok with male [[honor]] (amok by women is virtually unknown).<ref>{{cite web|last=Alexanra Ringe|first=Carrie McLaren|title=Curious Mental Illnesses Around the World|url=http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/archives/21/mental_illness.html|publisher=stayfreemagazone.org|accessdate=march 25,2013}}</ref> 
Running amok would thus be both a way of escaping the world (since perpetrators were normally killed) and re-establishing one's reputation as a man to be feared and respected.
Some observers{{Who|date=March 2012}} have related this explanation to [[Islam in the Philippines|Islam]]'s ban on suicide, which, it is suggested, drove Indonesian men to create circumstances in which [[suicide by cop|others would kill them]].

== Contemporary syndrome ==
"Running amok" is used to refer to the behavior of someone who, in the grip of strong emotion, obtains a weapon and begins attacking people indiscriminately, often with multiple fatalities.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Manuel L. Saint|title=Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC181064/|publisher=NCBI|accessdate=March 25, 2013}}</ref> An episode of amok may be triggered by a period of depression or highly aggressive behavior.   The slang term [[going postal]] is similar in scope.
Police describe such an event as a [[spree killer|killing spree]]. If the individual is seeking death an alternate method is often [[suicide by cop]].

Amok is often described as a culture-bound (or culture-specific) syndrome,<ref name="pmid15014687">{{cite journal |author=Saint Martin ML |title=Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome |journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=66–70 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=15014687 |pmc=181064 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid1427677">{{cite journal |author=Gaw AC, Bernstein RL |title=Classification of amok in DSM-IV |journal=Hosp Community Psychiatry |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=789–93 |year=1992 |month=August |pmid=1427677 |doi= |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1427677}}</ref> which is a psychological condition whose manifestation is strongly shaped by cultural factors. Other reported culture-bound syndromes are [[latah]] and [[Penis panic|koro]]. Amok is also sometimes considered one of the subcategories of [[dissociative disorders]] (cross-cultural variant).

== Officially classified as a psychiatric condition ==
In 1849, amok was officially classified as a psychiatric condition based on numerous reports and case studies that showed the majority of individuals who committed amok were, in some sense, mentally ill.<ref name="ncbi" /> However, DSM-IV does now break amok down into two official categories; beramok and amok. Beramok is considered to be the more common of the two and is associated with the depression and sadness resulting from a loss and the subsequent brooding process. Loss includes, but is not limited to, the death of a spouse or loved one, divorce, loss of a job, money, power, etc. Beramok is associated with mental issues of severe depression or other mood disorders. Amok, the rarer form, is believed to stem from rage, insult, or a vendetta against a person, society, or object for a wide variety of reasons. Amok has been more closely associated with psychosis, personality disorders, bipolar disorder, and delusions.<ref name="ncbi" />

== Historical and cross-cultural [[wikt:comparanda|comparanda]] ==
Early travelers in Asia sometimes describe a kind of military amok, in which soldiers apparently facing inevitable defeat suddenly burst into a frenzy of violence which so startled their enemies that it either delivered victory or at least ensured what the soldier in that culture considered an honourable death. This form of amok appears to resemble the [[berserker]] of the [[Norsemen|Norse]], the cafard or cathard (Polynesia), mal de pelea (Puerto Rico), iich'aa (Navaho), Laos, and Papua New Guinea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/ant100/pdf/MedicalAnthropology.pdf|title=Medical Anthropology: Culture-bound syndromes|accessdate=2009-04-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In contemporary [[Indonesia]], the term ''amok'' (''amuk'') generally refers not to individual violence, but to frenzied violence by mobs. Indonesians now commonly use the term 'gelap mata' (literally 'darkened eyes') to refer to individual amok.

In the [[Philippines]], ''amok'' also means unreasoning murderous rage by an individual. In 1876, the Spanish governor-general of the Philippines [[José Malcampo]] coined the term ''[[juramentado]]'' for the behavior (from ''juramentar'' - "to take an oath"), surviving into modern [[Filipino language]]s as ''huramentado''.<ref name=Hurley14>{{cite book |last1=Hurley |first1=Vic |title=Swish of the Kris; The Story of the Moros |url=http://www.nikhef.nl/~tonvr/keris/keris2/swish/index.html |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |edition= |series= |volume= |issue= |date= |year=1936 |month= |origyear= |publisher=E.P.

Norse [[berserker]]s and the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] battle trance are two other examples of the tendency of certain groups to work themselves up into a killing frenzy. The 1911 ''Webster Encyclopedia'' comments:

:''In 1634, the eldest son of the [[raja]] of [[Jodhpur]] ran amok at the court of [[Shah Jahan]], failing in his attack on the emperor, but killing five of his officials. During the 18th century, again, at [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] (Sind), two envoys, sent by the Jodhpur chief in regard to a quarrel between the two states, stabbed the prince and twenty-six of his suite before they themselves fell.''
