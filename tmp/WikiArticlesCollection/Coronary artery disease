<!--Signs and symptoms and cause -->
While the symptoms and signs of coronary artery disease are noted in the advanced state of disease, most individuals with coronary artery disease show no evidence of disease for decades as the disease progresses before the first onset of symptoms, often a "sudden" [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], finally arises.  Symptoms of stable ischaemic heart disease include [[angina pectoris|angina]] (characteristic [[chest pain]] on exertion) and decreased exercise tolerance. Unstable IHD presents itself as chest pain or other symptoms at rest, or rapidly worsening angina. The risk of artery narrowing increases with age, [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[hypercholesterolaemia|high blood cholesterol]], [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], and is more common in men and those who have close relatives with CAD. Other causes include [[coronary vasospasm]],<ref name="pmid9538315">{{cite journal |author=Williams MJ, Restieaux NJ, Low CJ|title=Myocardial infarction in young people with normal coronary arteries |journal=Heart |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=191–4|year=1998 |month=February |pmid=9538315 |url=http://heart.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9538315 |pmc=1728590|doi=10.1136/hrt.79.2.191}}</ref> a spasm of the blood vessels of the heart, it is usually called [[Prinzmetal's angina]].<ref name="pmid18056026">{{cite journal |author=Rezkalla SH, Kloner RA |title=Cocaine-induced acute myocardial infarction |journal=Clin Med Res |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=172–6 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=18056026 |doi=10.3121/cmr.2007.759 |url=http://www.clinmedres.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18056026 |pmc=2111405}}</ref>

<!-- Diagnosis and treatment -->
Diagnosis of IHD is with an [[electrocardiogram]], [[blood test]]s ([[cardiac marker]]s), [[cardiac stress test]]ing or a [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiogram]]. Depending on the symptoms and risk, treatment may be with medication, [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (angioplasty) or [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] (CABG).

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Angina pectoris|Angina]] (chest pain) that occurs regularly with activity, after heavy meals, or at other predictable times is termed stable angina and is associated with high grade [[stenosis|narrowings]] of the [[heart]] [[artery|arteries]].  The symptoms of angina are often treated with betablocker therapy such as [[metoprolol]] or [[atenolol]].  Nitrate preparations such as [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|nitroglycerin]], which come in short-acting and long-acting forms are also effective in relieving symptoms but are not known to reduce the chances of future heart attacks. Many other more effective treatments, especially of the underlying [[atheroma]]tous disease, have been developed.

Angina that changes in intensity, character or frequency is termed unstable. Unstable angina may precede myocardial infarction, and requires urgent medical attention. It may be treated with oxygen, intravenous nitroglycerin, and aspirin. Interventional procedures such as [[angioplasty]] may be done. About 80% of chest pains have nothing to do with the heart.

[[Heart failure]] (difficulty in breathing or swelling of the extremities due to weakness of the heart muscle)
[[Heartburn]]

== Risk factors ==
Risk factors can be classified as: fixed (such as age, sex, family history) and modifiable (such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, etc.)

There are various risk assessment systems for determining the risk of coronary artery disease, with various emphasis on different variables above. A notable example is ''Framingham Score'', used in the [[Framingham Heart Study]]. It is mainly based on age, gender, diabetes, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, tobacco smoking and systolic blood pressure.<ref>[http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/risk/coronary.html framinghamheartstudy.org > Coronary Heart Disease (10-year risk)](based on Wilson, D'Agostino, Levy et al. 'Prediction of Coronary Heart Disease using Risk Factor Categories', Circulation 1998)</ref>

Coronary artery disease has a number of well determined risk factors. The most common risk factors include [[smoking]], [[Family history (medicine)|family history]], [[hypertension]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes]], high alcohol consumption, lack of exercise, stress, and [[hyperlipidemia]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Causes |date=29 June 2012 |id=DS00064 |work=Coronary artery disease |publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/coronary-artery-disease/DS00064/DSECTION=causes}}</ref> Smoking is associated with about 54% of cases and obesity 20%.<ref name=Kivi2012/> Lack of exercise has been linked to 7–12% of cases.<ref name=Kivi2012/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee IM, Shiroma EJ, Lobelo F, Puska P, Blair SN, Katzmarzyk PT |title=Effect of physical inactivity on major non-communicable diseases worldwide: an analysis of burden of disease and life expectancy|journal=Lancet |volume=380 |issue=9838 |pages=219–29 |year=2012 |month=July |pmid=22818936 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61031-9 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(12)61031-9 |pmc=3645500}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Blausen 0257 CoronaryArtery Plaque.png|thumb|Illustration depicting atherosclerosis in coronary artery.]]
[[File:Blausen 0259 CoronaryArteryDisease 02.png|thumb|Illustration depicting coronary artery disease]]
Limitation of blood flow to the heart causes [[ischemia]] (cell starvation secondary to a lack of oxygen) of the myocardial cells.  Myocardial cells may die from lack of [[oxygen]] and this is called a [[myocardial infarction]] (commonly called a heart attack). It leads to [[cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] damage, [[cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] death and later [[myocardial scarring]] without [[cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] regrowth. Chronic high-grade stenosis of the coronary arteries can induce transient ischemia which leads to the induction of a ventricular arrhythmia, which may terminate into ventricular fibrillation leading to death.

Typically, coronary artery disease occurs when part of the smooth, elastic lining inside a [[coronary artery]] (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) develops [[atherosclerosis]]. With atherosclerosis, the artery's lining becomes hardened, stiffened, and swollen with all sorts of "gunge" - including calcium deposits, fatty deposits, and abnormal inflammatory [[Cell (biology)|cells]] - to form a [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]]. Deposits of calcium phosphates (hydroxyapatites) in the muscular layer of the blood vessels appear to play not only a significant role in stiffening arteries but also for the induction of an early phase of coronary [[arteriosclerosis]].  This can be seen in a so-called metastatic mechanism of calcification as it occurs in chronic kidney disease and haemodialysis  (Rainer Liedtke 2008). Although these patients suffer from a kidney dysfunction, almost fifty percent of them die due to coronary artery disease. Plaques can be thought of as large "pimples" that protrude into the channel of an artery, causing a partial obstruction to blood flow. Patients with coronary artery disease might have just one or two [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]]s, or might have dozens distributed throughout their [[coronary arteries]]. However, there is a term in medicine called cardiac syndrome X, which describes chest pain ([[Angina pectoris]]) and chest discomfort in people who do not show signs of blockages in the larger [[coronary arteries]] of their hearts when an [[angiogram]] (coronary angiogram) is being performed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lanza GA |title=Cardiac syndrome X: a critical overview and future perspectives |journal=Heart |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=159–66 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=16399854 |doi=10.1136/hrt.2005.067330 |url= |pmc=1861371}}</ref>

No one knows exactly what causes [[cardiac syndrome X]]. One explanation is [[microvascular dysfunction]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=E|coauthors=Eteiba, W; Merz, NB|title=Cardiac syndrome X and microvascular coronary dysfunction|journal=Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine|date=2012 Aug|volume=22|issue=6|pages=161–8|pmid=23026403|doi=10.1016/j.tcm.2012.07.014|pmc=3490207}}</ref> It is not completely clear why women are more likely than men to have it however, [[hormone]]s and other risk factors unique to women may play a role.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kaski JC |title=Pathophysiology and management of patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteriograms (cardiac syndrome X) |journal=Circulation |volume=109 |issue=5 |pages=568–72 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14769677 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000116601.58103.62 |url=}}</ref>

CAD has always been a tough disease to diagnose without the use of invasive or stressful activities.  The development of the [[Multifunction cardiogram|Multifunction Cardiogram (MCG)]] has changed the way CAD is diagnosed.  The MCG consists of a 2 lead resting EKG signal is transformed into a mathematical model and compared against tens of thousands of clinical trials to diagnose a patient with an objective severity score, as well as secondary and tertiary results about the patients condition.  The results from MCG tests have been validated in 8 clinical trials {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} which resulted in a database of over 50,000 patients where the system has demonstrated accuracy comparable to [[coronary angiography]] (90% overall sensitivity, 85% specificity).
This level of accuracy comes from the application of advanced techniques in signal processing and systems analysis combined with a large scale clinical database which allows MCG to provide quantitative, evidence-based results to assist physicians in reaching a diagnosis.  The MCG has also been awarded a Category III CPT code by the [[American Medical Association]] in the July 2009 CPT update {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}.

The diagnosis of "Cardiac Syndrome X" - the rare coronary artery disease that is more common in women, as mentioned, an "exclusion" diagnosis. Therefore, usually the same tests are used as in any patient with the suspicion of coronary artery disease:
* [[Baseline (medicine)|Baseline]] [[electrocardiography]] (ECG)
* Exercise ECG – [[Cardiac stress test|Stress test]]
* Exercise radioisotope test (nuclear stress test, myocardial [[scintigraphy]])
* [[Echocardiography]] (including stress echocardiography)
* [[Coronary angiography]]
* [[Intravascular ultrasound]]
* [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI)

The diagnosis of coronary disease underlying particular symptoms depends largely on the nature of the symptoms. The first investigation is an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG/EKG), both for "stable" angina and acute coronary syndrome. An [[Chest X-ray|X-ray of the chest]] and [[blood test]]s may be performed.

===Stable angina===
{{main|Angina pectoris}}

In "stable" angina, chest pain with typical features occurring at predictable levels of exertion, various forms of [[cardiac stress test]]s may be used to induce both symptoms and detect changes by way of electrocardiography (using an ECG), [[echocardiography]] (using [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] of the heart) or [[scintigraphy]] (using uptake of [[radionuclide]] by the heart muscle). If part of the heart seems to receive an insufficient blood supply, [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiography]] may be used to identify [[stenosis]] of the coronary arteries and suitability for [[angioplasty]] or [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]].

===Acute coronary syndrome===
{{main|Acute coronary syndrome}}
Diagnosis of [[acute coronary syndrome]] generally takes place in the [[emergency department]], where ECGs may be performed sequentially to identify "evolving changes" (indicating ongoing damage to the heart muscle). Diagnosis is clear-cut if ECGs show elevation of the "[[Electrocardiogram#ST segment|ST segment]]", which in the context of severe typical chest pain is strongly indicative of an acute [[myocardial infarction]] (MI); this is termed a STEMI (ST-elevation MI), and is treated as an emergency with either urgent [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiography]] and [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (angioplasty with or without [[stent]] insertion) or with [[thrombolysis]] ("clot buster" medication), whichever is available. In the absence of ST-segment elevation, heart damage is detected by [[cardiac marker]]s (blood tests that identify heart muscle damage). If there is evidence of damage ([[infarction]]), the chest pain is attributed to a "non-ST elevation MI" (NSTEMI). If there is no evidence of damage, the term "unstable angina" is used. This process usually necessitates admission to hospital, and close observation on a [[coronary care unit]] for possible complications (such as [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s – irregularities in the heart rate).

Depending on the risk assessment, stress testing or angiography may be used to identify and treat coronary artery disease in patients who have had an NSTEMI or unstable angina.

===Heart failure===
{{main|Heart failure}}

In people with heart failure, stress testing or coronary angiography may be performed to identify and treat underlying coronary artery disease.

== Prevention ==
Prevention involves: [[exercise]], decreasing [[obesity]], treating [[hypertension]], a [[healthy diet]], decreasing [[cholesterol]] levels, and [[smoking cessation|stopping smoking]]. Medications and exercise are roughly equally effective.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Naci|first=H.|coauthors=Ioannidis, J. P.

In [[diabetes mellitus]], there is little evidence that very tight [[blood sugar]] control improves cardiac risk although improved sugar control appears to decrease other problems like kidney failure and blindness. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends "low to moderate alcohol intake" to reduce risk of coronary artery disease although this remains without scientific cause and effect proof.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/5_population_nutrient/en/index12.html |title=5.

=== Secondary prevention ===
Secondary prevention is preventing further sequelae of already established disease. Regarding coronary artery disease, this can mean risk factor management that is carried out during cardiac rehabilitation, a 4-phase process beginning in hospital after MI, angioplasty or heart surgery and continuing for a minimum of three months. Exercise is a main component of cardiac rehabilitation along with diet, smoking cessation, and blood pressure and cholesterol management. Beta blockers may also be used for this purpose.<ref>{{cite book |last=Awtry |first=Eric H. |coauthors=Joseph Loscalzo |title=Cecil Essentials of Medicine |pages=87–108 |chapter=Coronary Heart Disease |year=2004 |edition=6 |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0-7216-0147-2}}</ref>

*2. Coronary interventions as [[angioplasty]] and [[coronary stent]]-implantation;
*3. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG - [[coronary artery bypass surgery]]).
Recent research efforts focus on new angiogenic treatment modalities ([[angiogenesis]]) and various (adult) [[stem cell]] therapies.

===Lifestyle===
Lifestyle changes have been shown to be effective in reducing (and in the case of diet, reversing) coronary disease:

====Aspirin====
In those with no other heart problems [[aspirin]] decreases the risk of a myocardial infarction in men but not women and increases the risk of bleeding, most of which is from the stomach. It does not affect the overall risk of death in either men or women.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wolff|first=T|coauthors=Miller, T; Ko, S|title=Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: an update of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|journal=Annals of internal medicine|date=2009 Mar 17|volume=150|issue=6|pages=405–10|pmid=19293073|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-150-6-200903170-00009}}</ref>

More specifically, high-risk persons are 'those with a 5-year risk ≥ 3%'.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

====Anti-platelet therapy====
Clopidogrel plus aspirin reduces cardiovascular events more than aspirin alone in those with an [[STEMI]].
