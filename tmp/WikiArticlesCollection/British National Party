The '''British National Party''' ('''BNP''') is a [[far-right]] political party in the [[United Kingdom]]. Formed as a splinter group from the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] by [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] in 1982, since 1999 it has been led by [[Nick Griffin]]. The BNP [[party platform]] is centred on the advocacy of "voluntary resettlement whereby immigrants and their descendants are afforded the opportunity to return to their lands of ethnic origin."<ref name="bnp2010"/> As well as anti-immigration rhetoric, the party advocates the reintroduction of [[capital punishment]], and opposes [[same-sex marriage]], and what it perceives as the [[Islamization|Islamification]] of the UK.

The party's ideology has been described as [[fascism|fascist]] by political scientists and commentators,<ref name="bnpelection2004"/><!--See additional references in infobox and 'Policies' section--> but the party formally denies this label. High-profile groups and people including [[The Royal British Legion]] and [[David Cameron]] have criticised the BNP, and BNP membership is prohibited for people of certain occupations. It restricted membership to "indigenous British" people until a 2010 legal challenge to its constitution.<ref>{{cite web |title=Court ruling in legal challenge to the BNP's constitution |url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/news/2010/january/court-ruling-in-legal-challenge-to-the-bnps-constitution/ |publisher=Equality and Human Rights Commission |accessdate=19 April 2013 |date=28 January 2010}}</ref>

The BNP finished fifth in the [[London mayoral election, 2008|2008 London mayoral election]] with 5.3% of the vote, winning a seat in the [[London Assembly]]. In 2009 it won its first county council seats and two seats in the [[European Parliament]], with leader [[Nick Griffin]] and [[Andrew Brons]] being elected as [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEP) in the North West and Yorkshire and Humber regions. Brons resigned from the BNP in 2011. During the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]], the BNP received 1.9% of the vote and failed to win any seats. According to the BNP's statement of accounts in December 2012, its membership was 4872, compared to over 12,000 in 2009. A number of breakaway parties have been formed from former BNP members.

The British National Party{{#tag:ref|The name British National Party had been used in politics previously by four organisations, most notably by the [[British National Party (1942)|a Mosleyite party]] which became the [[English National Association]] and by [[British National Party (1960s)|a 1960s party]] initiated by [[John Bean]], which became part of the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]]. Tyndall was a leading member of the 1960s BNP and a founder of the present party.|group=note}} was founded in 1982 following a split within the far right [[British National Front|National Front]] (NF) two years before.<ref name="cook">{{harvnb|Cook|2000|p=88}}</ref> After a poor showing at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], internal factional division heightened within the NF, culminating in chairman [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] leaving the party in 1980,<ref name="betz">{{harvnb|Betz|1998|p=145}}</ref> and founding the New National Front, which became the BNP two years later.<ref>{{harvnb|Barberis|2005|p=191}}</ref>

Tyndall's new BNP absorbed the membership of the [[British Democratic Party]], a small [[British nationalism|British nationalist]] party led by [[Anthony Reed Herbert]] which was attempting to distance itself from [[neo-nazism]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|Bell|1988|p=92}}</ref> and which had itself earlier split from the NF.<ref>{{harvnb|Plowright|2006|p=37}}</ref> Also joining were members of the [[Constitutional Movement]], another NF splinter group who had distanced themselves from fascism and violent subcultures such as [[football hooliganism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Barberis|McHugh|Tyldesley|2005|p=188}}</ref> However, despite Tyndall's attempt to distance the BNP from fascism, several individuals of the disintegrating [[British Movement]] were allowed to join.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|Bell|1988|p=146}}</ref>

===Early years: 1983–1990===
{{main|History_of_the_British_National_Party#Early_years:_1983.E2.80.931990|l1=History of the BNP (early years)}}
In 1983, Tyndall sought to make an electoral impact by fielding 53 candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], which guaranteed a free party broadcast,<ref name="eightthree">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/roots/1979.stm |title=BNP: under the skin, 1979–1983 |accessdate=4 January 2010 |work=BBC News}}</ref> but all of the BNP's candidates combined – including Tyndall and his wife Valerie – achieved only 14,621 votes and as a result they lost all of their deposits.<ref name="butler">{{harvnb|Butler|1983|p=345}}</ref> It was revealed afterwards that the BNP Deputy Chairman [[Ray Hill]] had been working as a mole on behalf of the anti-fascist magazine ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]''.<ref name="bnpbarb">{{harvnb|Barberis|2005|p=178}}</ref>

Tyndall attempted to distance the party from neo-nazism and the skinhead subculture,<ref>{{harvnb|Larsen|1998|p=1207}}</ref> claiming that the party's more moderate image attracted 3,000 enquiries for membership after the 1983 general election.<ref>{{harvnb|Copsey|2004|p=32}}</ref> However, despite an increase in membership and media exposure, the BNP continued to poll very low in council elections, ranging from 1 - 3%, the sole exception being a council by-election in [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] in 1984, where the party polled 11.7%.<ref>{{harvnb|Copsey|2004|p=39}}</ref>

In 1986, Tyndall and [[John Morse (British politician)|John Morse]] were imprisoned for inciting racial hatred.<ref>{{harvnb|Szajkowski|2004|p=498}}</ref> While Tyndall was imprisoned, the party ceased its electoral activity; only one candidate stood in the London Borough council elections.<ref>{{harvnb|Copsey|2004|p=40}}</ref> While Tyndall and Morse served 4-month prison sentences, membership of the party had shrunk, and with little financial income, Tyndall decided not to stand candidates in the 1987 general election.<ref>{{harvnb|Copsey|2004|pp=39–43}}</ref> In 1989, the BNP had 800 members.<ref>{{harvnb|Copsey|2004|p=45}}</ref>

In 1994, in the aftermath of losing its first locall council seat, the British National Party clashed with paramilitary organisation, [[Combat 18]].<ref>{{harvnb|Copsey|2004|p=67}}</ref> That same year, the BNP proscribed membership of the group<ref name="twothree"/> and claimed it had been infiltrated by [[MI5]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7736000/7736870.stm |title=Interview with the British National Party |author=BBC Radio 4 |date=19 November 2008 |accessdate=16 April 2013 |work=BBC News}}</ref> In September 1995, Tyndall maintained that in response to the BNP's victory in Millwall, Combat 18 had been 'created' by the State security services in order to wreck the BNP and its electoral support.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=September 1995 |title= |journal=Spearhead |volume=319 |issue= |pages=6–10 |publisher=British National Party}}</ref> Political opponents claimed that "racist incidents" occurred around the BNP's headquarters and instigated a "close down the BNP" march in October 1993.<ref name="welling">{{cite web |url=http://www.dkrenton.co.uk/welling.html |title=Memories of Welling |publisher=DK Renton |accessdate=16 April 2013}}</ref> Thousands of people attended the demonstration, for which 2,600 police officers were deployed.<ref name="hans">{{Cite news |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1993/oct/18/welling-disturbances |title=Welling: Disturbances |work=Hansard |date=18 October 1993 |accessdate=16 April 2013}}</ref> In 1995, [[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley Council]] shut down the BNP headquarters.<ref>{{harvnb|Saggar|1998|p=136}}</ref> The same year, relations were built up with [[William Luther Pierce]]'s US-based [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://buildingdemocracy.org/reports/Beyond_a_Dead_Mans_Deeds_color_web.pdf |title=Beyond A Dead Man's Deeds: The National Alliance After William Pierce |publisher=Center for New Community |year=2002 |accessdate=16 April 2013}}</ref>

In August 1995 Tyndall committed the party to contesting 50 seats at the next general election.<ref>{{harvnb|Copsey|2004|p=69}}</ref> However the party was in a poor state, as the membership had dropped to 700 and there was an on-going conflict with Combat 18.<ref>{{harvnb|Copsey|2004|pp=68–69}}</ref> The party attempted to further modernise its image for the upcoming [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]]. [[Nick Griffin]] joined the party in 1995, having led a faction of the National Front and Tyndall employed him to edit ''Spearhead''. Griffin believed the British National Party needed to be further modernised, with no fascist connections, but through a forthright commitment to what he regarded as [[historical revisionism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Copsey|2004|p=71}}</ref> The party managed to save two deposits in this election, Tyndall with 7.26 per cent and Dave King with 7.5 per cent, in the [[East End of London]] and [[Canning Town]].<ref>{{harvnb|Eatwell|2004|p=67}}.</ref>

Following the 1997 general election, the BNP once again suffered a setback. At local elections in May 1998, the BNP fielded five more candidates than in 1994 but its average vote fell from just over 13% to a derisory 3.28%. In Tower Hamlets, its average share of the poll slumped by almost half.<ref name="copsey73">{{harvnb|Copsey|2004|p=73}}</ref> At the end of 1998, membership stood at 1,100.<ref name="copsey73"/>

===Griffin leadership, identity nationalism===

In October 1999, Nick Griffin, supported by [[Tony Lecomber]], stood against Tyndall for leadership of the BNP.<ref name="eatw"/>
John Tyndall received just 411 (30%) of the votes, while Griffin the majority.<ref>{{harvnb|Copsey|2004|p=23}}</ref> After Griffin won he began modernising the party's image,<ref name="eatw"/> though the crucial policy change from compulsory to voluntary [[repatriation]] had already been accomplished under Tyndall's leadership. A new monthly newspaper, ''The Voice of Freedom'', was initiated, as well as a journal, ''Identity''.<ref name="eatw"/>

It asserted that the BNP operated with a "network of false identities" and organised rendezvous points to allow members to be directed to "clandestine meetings". Party members were directed to avoid "any racist or anti-semitic language in public". Cobain also claimed that the membership in central London had expanded beyond the party's traditional range, now including "dozens of company directors, computing entrepreneurs, bankers and estate agents, and a handful of teachers".<ref name="Cobain Inside"/> The BNP was investigated by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] in 2007, after ''The Guardian'' revealed that it had set up a front organisation to raise money from sympathisers in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |title=BNP faces inquiry over US fundraising |author=Matthew Taylor |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/apr/12/thefarright.politics |work=The Guardian |date=12 April 2007 |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref>

The constitution of the BNP has been criticised by members for giving far too much power to the chairman and for not being easily accessible by the membership.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/auty-quits-after-bnp-leadership-bid-fails-1-2191159 |title=Auty quits after BNP leadership bid fails |publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post |author=Richard Edwards |accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref> In 2007, a leadership challenge by Christian (Chris) Jackson succeeded in forcing an election, but Griffin retained the role.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/hate-groups/nf/ |title=National Front |publisher=Hope not Hate |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref>

Following disappointing election results in 2011, and a General Members Meeting which did away with the virtually insurmountable nominations' requirement for a leadership election, a [[British National Party leadership election, 2011|leadership election]] took place in 2011.

These executive positions work alongside an Advisory Council, the party's senior policy body, which meets at least three times a year. Its role is to "inspect the party's accounts, ensuring proper conduct of the party's finances, and to act as a forum for the party's leadership to discuss vital issues and carve out the party's agenda".<ref name="BNP-Party">{{cite web |url=http://www.bnp.org.uk/donate/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080123101730/http://www.bnp.org.uk/donate/ |archivedate=2008-01-23 |title=Party Structure and Organisation. |publisher=British National Party |accessdate=14 April 2013}}</ref>

===Ideology===
It has been claimed that the BNP has, since its foundation, been fascist. John Tyndall, founder of the BNP, proclaimed: "''[[Mein Kampf]]'' is my bible".<ref>{{cite news |title=Expelled BNP founder plans court battle |author=Jamie Doward |url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/aug/24/uk.thefarright |newspaper=The Observer |date=24 August 2003 |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> Piero Ignazi has said that the "proto-Nazi" mould of the NF, and the "generalised nostalgia for all sorts of fascist tendencies" and association with "foreign ideologies", which continued under the BNP, accounted for the lack of success for both parties in comparison to successful far-right parties in Europe, which disavowed traditional fascism.<ref>{{harvnb|Ignazi|2003}}</ref>

An editorial in ''The Guardian'' characterises the BNP as "a racist organisation with a fascist pedigree".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/oct/15/bnp-question-time-bbc-griffin |title=The BNP on Question Time is the wrong party on the wrong programme |date=15 October 2009 |work=The Guardian |publisher= |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> According to [[David Cameron]]: "If you vote for the BNP you are voting for a bunch of fascists&nbsp;...

The BNP denies that it is fascist and claims that opposition parties are trying to "prevent freedom of speech".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/3497436.stm |work=BBC News |title=Ex-BNP member backs anti-fascists |date=10 March 2004 |accessdate=13 pril 2013}}</ref> Griffin has said that such accusations are "a smear that comes from the far left."

===Economic policy===
The economic policy of the party has developed over time. In the 1990s, the party reflected [[protectionism]] and [[economic nationalism]], although in comparison with other radical nationalist parties, the BNP focuses less on [[corporatism]].<ref name="routledge">{{harvnb|Davies|2002|p=149}}</ref> It has called for British ownership of its own industries and resources and the "subordination of the power of the City to the power of the government".<ref name="routledge"/> It has promoted the regeneration of farming in the United Kingdom, with the object of achieving maximum [[self-sufficiency]] in food production.<ref name="routledge"/> It has advocated ending overseas aid in order to provide aid within the UK and to finance the repatriation of immigrants.<ref name="routledge"/> In 2002, the party criticised corporatism as a "mixture of big capitalism and state control", saying it favoured a "[[distributism|distributionist]] tradition established by home-grown thinkers" favouring small business.<ref name="eatw">{{harvnb|Eatwell|2004|p=69}}.</ref> In its 2005 manifesto, the BNP opposed "[[globalism]], [[international socialism]], [[laissez-faire capitalism]] and [[economic liberalism]]".<ref name="bbcmanifesto">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/BNP_uk_manifesto.pdf |work=BBC News |title=BNP General Election Manifesto 2005 |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> The BNP rejects the notion of [[Thatcherism]] and "submitting to the dictates of the international marketplace" which "has no loyalty to this country".<ref name="bbcmanifesto"/> The BNP has claimed that it is possible for a national economy to thrive outside of the [[laissez-faire]] model, pointing to 21st century examples such as Japan, South Korea and Singapore.<ref name="bbcmanifesto"/> The BNP claims that, while immigration increases the [[Aggregate income|aggregate GNP]] by providing cheap labour, it decreases the [[Per capita income|per-capita GNP]], which the BNP claims is most representative of the economic well-being of British people.<ref name="bbcmanifesto"/>

In the BNP 2010 Manifesto some of their key economic policies are summed up as follows:<ref name="bnp2010"/>
* The BNP will forbid the development and importation of genetically modified produce.
* The BNP will ensure that globalist corporations pay their fair share of the tax burden.
* A BNP government would tackle the national debt problem by cutting expenditure on all projects which they think do not serve British interests.

===European Union===
The British National Party are [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptics]], who wish to move towards a greater national self-sufficiency.<ref name="radical right">{{cite journal |last1=Minkenberg |first1=Michael |last2=Perrineau |first2=Pascal |year=2007 |title=The Radical Right in the European Elections 2004 |journal=International Political Science Review |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=34–26 |publisher= |doi= 10.1177/0192512107070401|url=}}</ref> According to the BNP 2010 Manifesto: "The BNP demands an immediate withdrawal from the European Union, which is an organisation dedicated to usurping British sovereignty and to destroying our nationhood and national identity".<ref name="bnp2010"/>

===Social and cultural policy===
Some key social and cultural policies of the British National Party are summed up below from its most recent manifesto:<ref name="bnp2010">{{cite web |url=http://communications.bnp.org.uk/ge2010manifesto.pdf |title=Democracy, Freedom, Culture and Identity |date=6 May 2010 |work=The Manifesto of the British National Party |publisher=British National Party |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref>
* The BNP will oppose the intrusion of non-British and alien cultural influences which undermine our traditional value systems.
* The BNP will introduce a new Bill of Rights which will guarantee certain basic civil liberties.
* The BNP will encourage the teaching of British history, culture and traditions at schools.
* The BNP will ensure that the National Health Service is used to serve British people and not used as an International Health Service.
* The BNP will repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act and withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights.
* The BNP will ensure that appropriate areas of public life, including school assemblies, are based on a commitment to the values of traditional Western Christianity, as a benchmark for a decent and civilised society.

In 2005 the BNP proposed to reintroduce compulsory [[National Service]] for the young and proposed that men should keep a rifle and ammunition in their homes.<ref name="bbcmanifesto" /> In its 2010 Manifesto, the BNP expanded on its policy of National Service, claiming the youths who take National Service would subsequently be funded for their university or further education.<ref name="bnp2010"/>

A further BNP policy is "to end the conflict in Ireland by welcoming [[Republic of Ireland|Eire]] {{sic}} as well as [[Northern Ireland|Ulster]] as equal partners in a federation of the nations of the British Isles".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080120155729/www.bnp.org.uk/sms-news-texts/ |title=British National Party Policies |publisher=British National Party |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref>

===Crime===
The BNP advocates capital punishment for "drug dealers, child murderers, multiple murderers, murderers of policemen on duty and terrorists where guilt is proven beyond all doubt".<ref name="bnp2010"/><ref name="bbcmanifesto"/> Other key BNP policies on crime include:<ref name="bnp2010"/>
* The BNP will abolish political correctness from the police service in favour of real crime fighting.
* The BNP will establish a penal station for hardened and repeat criminals on the British island of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]].
* The BNP will reintroduce the right of householders to defend themselves and their property using whatever means they deem necessary.

===Immigration===
Since its formation the British National Party has staunchly opposed immigration. The BNP argues that: "To ensure that we do not become a minority in our own homeland, and that the native British peoples of our Islands retain their culture and identity, we call for an immediate halt to all further immigration."<ref name="bbcmanifesto"/> Under the leadership of [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] the party advocated total repatriation for all ethnic minorities.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8320241.stm |title=Profile: Nick Griffin |date=23 October 2009 |work=BBC News |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> When [[Nick Griffin]] became chairman in 1999, the BNP changed their total [[repatriation]] policy to only voluntary, a key policy which remains to date, offering financial "incentives for immigrants and their descendants to return home."<ref name="bnp2010"/> The party maintains that ethnic minorities legally in Britain are entitled to stay as long as they always remain the minority population demographically:<ref name="bnp2010"/>

In their 2010 Manifesto the BNP argues that Islamic immigration must be "halted and reversed as it presents one of the most deadly threats yet to the survival of our nation".<ref name="bnp2010"/> Furthermore their policy is also to "deport all foreigners convicted of crimes in Britain, regardless of their immigration status" as well as deport illegal immigrants and "reject all asylum seekers who passed safe countries on their way to Britain".<ref name="bnp2010"/>

====British Army immigrant issue====
It has been claimed that the BNP is opposed to allowing British Army [[Gurkha]]s the right of settlement in the United Kingdom. In 2009, Nick Griffin said: "We don't think the most overcrowded country in Europe, can realistically say, 'Look, you can all come and all your relatives'...&nbsp;When the Gurkhas signed up—frankly as mercenaries—they expected a pension which would allow them to live well in their own country".<ref name="Daily Mirror">{{cite web |url=http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/news/article/1195/keep-brave-gurkhas-out-of-britain-says-bnp |title=Keep brave Gurkhas out of Britain says BNP |work=Daily Mirror  |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> Later, he said that if he could swap "100,000 members of the Muslim community, who say that they support al Qaeda" for the Gurkhas it "would be a good exchange".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/695720/bnp-leader-pulls-out-of-palace-garden-party |title=BNP Leader Pulls Out Of Palace Garden Party |publisher=Sky News |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> Nick Griffin has described the commentary about his party's polices on the Gurkhas as "lies",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6474863.ece  |work=The Times  |first=Russell |last=Jenkins |title=BNPs Nick Griffin finally gets to make a speech |date=10 June 2009}}{{subscription required}}</ref> stating the party has "never before even debated this issue".

On 17 May 2009, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that the BNP's leader, Nick Griffin, had branded Lance Corporal [[Johnson Beharry]], a black recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], an "immigrant" whose bravery was simply "routine". The ''Telegraph'' quoted the BNP website as calling Beharry's award of the Victoria Cross "positive discrimination by the [[political correctness|PC]]-mad government".<ref name="Telegraph">{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/5336891/BNP-war-hero-Johnson-Beharry-only-got-medal-because-he-is-black.html |title=BNP: war hero Johnson Beharry only got medal because he is black |work=The Daily Telegraph  |date=17 May 2009 |accessdate=13 April 2013 |first=Ben |last=Leach}}</ref> Beharry was awarded the Victoria Cross in 2005 for action in Iraq, when he returned to his burning armoured personnel carrier three times, under sustained enemy fire, to lift his wounded comrades from the vehicle.<ref name="Ministry of Defence">{{cite web |url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.operations.mod.uk/telic/ophons05/beharry.htm |title=Private Johnson Gideon Beharry – Victoria Cross |publisher=Ministry of Defence |date=18 March 2005 |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> The BNP claimed: "All he did was drive away very fast from a combat zone."<ref name="Telegraph"/>

===Race===
During the leadership of Tyndall, the party firmly supported [[white nationalism]] and the BNP 1997 Manifesto thus called for Britain to be made "once again a white country" through a total repatriation programme for all ethnic minorities. The BNP's 1992 General Election manifesto said that the party had "no quarrel with the ordinary Jew who goes about his own business and does not attempt to influence national affairs in the interests of his racial group", but was opposed to Jewish people "whose activities in pursuit of the interests of their own co-racialists here and around the world can sometimes bring them into conflict with British interests".<ref name=1992Manifesto/> In 1990, the BNP under Tyndall was described by the [[European Parliament|European Parliament's]] committee on racism and xenophobia as an "openly Nazi party&nbsp;..."<ref name="bnputs">{{Cite news |title=BNP: under the skin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/roots/1984.stm |work=BBC News |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> In 1993, the party's deputy leader [[Richard Edmonds]] said, "We are 100 per cent racist".<ref name="bnputs"/> However, under the leadership of [[Nick Griffin]], from 1999, the party began to radically change its stance on race issues. Writing in the party's newspaper, ''The Voice of Freedom'', Nick Griffin wrote an article entitled "The BNP and Race" in 2001 to clarify that the "The BNP is no longer a genuine White Racial Nationalist party" and that:

{{quote|"The BNP is not a 'race supremacist' party. The BNP does not claim that any one race is superior to any other, simply that they are different. The party merely wishes to preserve those differences which make up the rich tapestry of human kind&nbsp;... to protect and preserve the racial and cultural integrity of the British people – and of others too – the party believes in separation&nbsp;...

The BNP under Griffin espouses "[[ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalism]]" based on "concern for the well-being of the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish ethnic nations that compose the United Kingdom". According to Griffin, regarding the BNP's racial views in 2004: "we don't hate black people, we don't hate asians, we don't oppose any ethnic group for what God made them, they have a right to their own identity as such as we do, all we want to do is to preserve the ethnic and cultural identity of the British people."<ref>{{harvnb|Passmore|2002|p=119}}</ref> Scholars of political science have noted this change in racial ideology and consider it to be [[ethnopluralism]] or 'differentialism' ([[racial realism]]), influenced by the [[European New Right]].<ref>{{harvnb|Art|2011|p=101}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Liang|2007|p=250}}</ref> Speaking on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Andrew Marr Show|Andrew Marr Show]]'' in 2009, Nick Griffin declared that the BNP "does not want all-white UK" because "Nobody out there wants it or would pay for it" and that the claims he was a fascist were smears.<ref>{{cite news |title=BNP 'does not want all-white UK' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8146585.stm |accessdate=13 April 2013 |work=BBC News |date=12 July 2009}}</ref>

In 2010, following legal action by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the party changed its constitution which had restricted membership to "indigenous British" people.

The party has stated that it does not oppose the Jewish, Hindu or Sikh religions but does not accept practising Sikhs or Hindus as ethnically British since they are not indigenous.<ref name=Blake2005>{{cite web |url=http://www.bnp.org.uk/news_detail.php?newsId=390 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071014195804/http://www.bnp.org.uk/news_detail.php?newsId=390 |archivedate=2007-10-14 |title="Asians" in Britain: A personal message from the BNP's webeditor |last=Blake |first=Steve |date=12 July 2005 |publisher=British National Party}}</ref> The BNP sums up its views on non-indigenous British as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bnp.org.uk/resource/english-democrats-vs-british-national-party |title=English Democrats Vs the British National Party |publisher=British National Party |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref>
* The British National Party&nbsp;... recognises pro-British members of assimilated minorities as British in a civic sense, and welcomes their contribution to our fight for fair play for, and the future survival of, the indigenous peoples of these islands.
* But we absolutely reject the poisonous, Politically Correct, anti-indigenous fiction that they are English, or Scottish, or Welsh, or Irish. They may well be very decent people, but if any of us went to Nigeria or Afghanistan, no-one would dream of pretending that we were Nigerians or Afghans.

The BNP is opposed to mixed-race relationships because "when whites take partners from other ethnic groups, a white family line that stretches back into deep pre-history is destroyed."<ref name=bnpfaq>{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20020203190553/www.bnp.org.uk/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=British National Party |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> Nick Griffin has also stated: "...&nbsp;while the BNP is not racist, it must not become multi-racist either. Our fundamental determination to secure a future for white children is restated, and an area of uncertainty is addressed and a position which is both principled and politically realistic is firmly established. We don't hate anyone, especially the mixed race children who are the most tragic victims of enforced multi-racism, but that does not mean that we accept [[miscegenation]] as moral or normal.

====Support from ethnic minorities====
The BNP under Griffin's leadership has worked with extremists from the Sikh and Hindu communities on anti-Muslim campaigns from 2001<ref>{{cite news |title=Hindu and Sikh extremists in link with BNP |author=Paul Harris |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/dec/23/race.politics |newspaper=The Observer |date=23 December 2001 |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Sikh admits to BNP talks |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1535348.stm |work=BBC News |date=10 September 2001 |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> and has also actively tried to win Jewish votes.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/apr/10/thefarright.race |title=BNP seeks to bury antisemitism and gain Jewish votes in Islamophobic campaign |work=The Guardian  |date=10 April 2008 |accessdate=13 April 2013 |first=Matthew |last=Taylor}}</ref> When the party changed its constitution on membership which allowed ethnic minorities to join, a 78-year-old Sikh, Rajinder Singh, became the first Asian member.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sikh campaigner for BNP set to become party's first non-white member |author=Haroon Siddique |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/nov/20/sikh-man-bnp-member |work=The Guardian |date=20 November 2009 |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> In 2010, Reverend James Gitau joined the BNP and became its first black member claiming he only joined because it "was the only party that boldly speaks against sodomy in public"; however, he left the party a week later when he was not nominated to stand for [[Croydon Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon Central]] and instead joined and stood as a [[Christian Party (UK)|Christian Party]] candidate.<ref>{{cite news |title=BNP "too racist" for black vicar |author=Kirsty Whalley |url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/8123879.BNP__too_racist__for_black_vicar/ |newspaper=Croydon Guardian |date=28 April 2010  |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref>

The BNP has also fielded a small number of ethnic minority candidates and claims it has an elected "Jewish" councillor, [[Patricia Richardson (politician)|Patricia Richardson]]. Formerly, the party also had a half-Turkish Cypriot, half-English councillor, [[Lawrence Rustem]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/membership/other/lawrence_rustem.stm |title=Lawrence Rustem |work=BBC News |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> In 2006, Sharif Abdel Gawad, partly Armenian and Greek, was chosen as a council candidate in [[Bradford]].

====Criticism of Islam====
The party states that it "has moved on in recent years, casting off the leg-irons of conspiracy theories and the thinly veiled anti-semitism which has held this party back for two decades. The real enemies of the British people are home grown Anglo-Saxon Celtic liberal-leftists&nbsp;... and the Crescent Horde—the endless wave of Islamics who are flocking to our shores to bring our island nations into the embrace of their barbaric desert religion".<ref name="Nationalism and Israel">{{cite web |url=http://www.bnp.org.uk/news_detail.php?newsId=1057 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071014195726/http://www.bnp.org.uk/news_detail.php?newsId=1057 |archivedate=2007-10-14 |title=Nationalism and Israel |date=28 July 2006 |publisher=British National Party |accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref>

Consequently, the party has shifted allegiance in conflicts involving Israel. In 2009, Griffin stated: "I have brought the British National party from the frankly an anti-semitic and racist organisation, into the only party which in the clashes between Israel and Gaza supported Israel's right to deal with Hamas terrorists."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/6411261/BNP-on-BBCs-Question-Time-key-quotes.html |title=BNP on BBC's Question Time: key quotes |date=23 October 2009 |work=The Daily Telegraph  |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref>

Griffin has said that this shift in emphasis is designed to increase the party's appeal: "We should be positioning ourselves to take advantage for our own political ends of the growing wave of public hostility to Islam currently being whipped up by the mass media".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bnp.org.uk/columnists/chairman2.php?ngId=30 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071014195717/http://www.bnp.org.uk/columnists/chairman2.php?ngId=30 |archivedate=2007-10-14 |title=By their fruits (or lack of them) shall you know them |last1=Griffin |first1=Nick |date=21 March 2006 |publisher=British National Party |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref>

The party summarized its position on the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] by stating that "the BNP supports the right of Israel to be Jewish. This ethno-nationalist concept is at the heart of the party’s desire to keep Britain British. The BNP also supports the rights of the Palestinians to their own state, and argues that a two-state solution is the only obvious, fair and reasonable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bnp.org.uk/news/israel-%E2%80%98protect-its-jewish-nature%E2%80%99-building-concentration-camp-10000-african-%E2%80%9Cinfiltrators%E2%80%9D |title=Israel to ‘Protect its Jewish nature’ by Building Concentration Camp for 10,000 African "Infiltrators" |publisher=British National Party |accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref>

===Family===
The British National Party promotes [[familialism]] and supports the [[nuclear family]] of [[Western culture|Western tradition]], as well as favouring traditional [[gender role]]s for women and men. The 1992 BNP Manifesto thus asserts their belief that although women and men should be treated equal, women should "regard home-and family-making as the highest vocation for their sex" before their jobs or career.<ref name=1992Manifesto>{{cite web |url=http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/man/bnp_1992.htm |title=British National Party Election Manifesto for 1992 |work= |publisher=British National Party |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> In September 2011, scholar Matthew Goodwin, an expert in electoral behaviour at the University of Nottingham has claimed in an article that: "particular members of the BNP" feel as though there has been a "substantial decline in family values" under the leadership of the Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties.<ref>{{cite news |title=Viewpoint: What are BNP supporters really like? |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15083475 |accessdate=13 April 2013 |work=BBC News |date=28 September 2011}}</ref>

The BNP 2010 Manifesto also declares their wish to promote traditional concepts of civility and courteousness in schools.<ref>{{cite news |title=At-a-glance: BNP general election manifesto |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8640896.stm |accessdate=13 April 2013 |work=BBC News |date=23 April 2010}}</ref>

====Opposition to abortion====
The BNP wish to "encourage a responsible approach to family life, and to reverse the dangerous downturn in the birth rate".<ref name=1992Manifesto/> The BNP opposes abortion and, in 2007, worked on a campaign with the [[UK Life League]], an anti-abortion lobby group.<ref>{{cite news |last=McDonald |first=Henry |title=BNP seeks anti-abortion Catholic votes |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/mar/04/thefarright.otherparties |accessdate=13 April 2013 |newspaper=The Observer |date=3 March 2007 }}</ref>

==Electoral performance==
{{Main|British National Party election results}}
The BNP has contested seats in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Research from Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin shows that BNP support is concentrated among older and less educated working-class men living in the declining industrial towns of the North and Midlands regions, in contrast to previous significant far-right parties like the National Front, which drew support from a younger demographic.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ford |first1=Robert |last2=Goodwin |first2=Matthew J. |year=2010 |title=Angry White Men: Individual and Contextual Predictors of Support for the British National Party |journal=Political Studies |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=1–25 |publisher= |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.2009.00829.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9248.2009.00829.x/pdf}}</ref>

The Employment Tribunal held that members of racist organisations could lawfully be dismissed on health and safety grounds if there was a danger of violence occurring in the workplace.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emplaw.co.uk/lawguide?startpage=2005irlr744.htm |title=Disclaw Publishing – Employment Law, unfair dismissal, redundancy pay |publisher=Emplaw.co.uk |accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref> In November 2012, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] made a majority ruling (4 to 3) that in Redfearn's case against the UK government, his rights under Article 11 (free association) had been infringed,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/nov/06/bus-driver-bnp-wins-rights-case |title=Bus driver sacked for BNP membership wins case in Strasbourg |date=6 November 2012 |publisher=The Guardian |first=Owen |last=Bowcott}}</ref> but not those under Article 10 (free expression) or Article 14 (discrimination).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-114240 |title=CASE OF REDFEARN v.

===Association with violence===
John Hagan claims that the BNP has conducted [[Right-wing politics and violence|right-wing extremist violence]] in order to gain "institutionalized power".<ref name="haganwilliam">{{harvnb|Heitmeyer|2003|p=406}}</ref> Critics of the BNP, such as [[Human Rights Watch]] in a 1997 report, have asserted that the party recruits from skinhead groups and that it promotes racist violence.<ref>{{harvnb|Human Rights Watch|1997|p=13}}</ref>

In the past, Nick Griffin has defended the threat of violence to further the party's aims. In 1986, when Griffin was Deputy Chairman of the NF, he advised his audience at an anti-[[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] rally to use the "traditional British methods of the brick, the boot and the fist."<ref>{{cite news |title= |author= |url= |newspaper=Yorkshire Post |date=17 February 1986}}</ref> After the BNP won its first council seat in 1993, he wrote that the BNP should not be a "postmodernist rightist party" but "a strong, disciplined organisation with the ability to back up its slogan 'Defend Rights for Whites' with well-directed boots and fists. When the crunch comes, power is the product of force and will, not of rational debate". In 1997 he said: "It is more important to control the streets of a city than its council chambers."<ref name="guardng">{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2002/sep/01/features.magazine37 |title=Flying the flag |last=Anthony |first=Andrew |date=1 September 2002 |work=The Guardian  |accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref>

===Equality and Human Rights Commission===
The [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] sent the BNP a letter in 2009, ahead of legal action, setting out concerns about the BNP's constitution and membership criteria. It alleged that the BNP's constitution restricting membership to white people was unlawful under the Race Relations Act. The BNP chose to fight this opinion in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]]. The Commission issued county court proceedings against party leader Nick Griffin and two other officials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/news/2009/august/commission-issues-county-court-proceedings-against-the-bnp/ |title=Commission issues county court proceedings against the BNP |date=24 August 2009 |publisher=Equality and Human Rights Commission |accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref>

The conclusion of the case in October 2009 saw costs awarded against the BNP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/news/2009/october/commission-forces-bnp-to-change-its-constitution-and-membership-criteria-after-legal-case-victory/ |title=Commission forces BNP to change its constitution and membership criteria after legal case victory |date=15 October 2009 |publisher=Equality and Human Rights Commission |accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref> The BNP stated that Griffin was "required in Brussels" on that day.

The BNP agreed to suspend further membership applications until an Extraordinary General Meeting in January 2010 confirming changes to the constitution. The case was adjourned in order to ensure compliance.<ref name="dailymail.co.uk" /> As a result of the case, the Secretary of State for Wales, [[Peter Hain]] protested against the BBC's inclusion of Griffin on the [[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]] programme, claiming the court case meant the BNP was "an unlawful body". [[Shami Chakrabarti]], director of [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]], said: "A shiny new constitution does not a democratic party make. It would be a pyrrhic victory, to say the least, if anyone thought that giving the BNP a facelift would make the slightest difference to a body with so much racism and hatred pumping through its veins."<ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/>

The courts declared that the new constitution still breached equality laws and was still indirectly discriminatory. Judge Paul Collins ordered the BNP to pay costs and said its membership list must remain "closed" until it complied with race relations laws. The BNP claimed that it had a waiting list of black and Asian people and wanted more applications from ethnic minorities.<ref name="New BNP rules rejected by court">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8564742.stm |work=BBC News |title=New BNP rules rejected by court |date=12 March 2010 |accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref>

Some opponents of fascism call for no coverage to be given to groups or individuals enunciating what they describe as "[[hate speech]]".
