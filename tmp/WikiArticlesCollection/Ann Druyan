==Religious and philosophical views==
As an [[agnostic]], Druyan holds that belief in a [[deity]] is not necessary to a healthy appreciation for life and a sense of unity with the [[universe]].

In an interview with [[Joel Achenbach]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', Druyan stated that her early interest in science stemmed from a fascination with [[Karl Marx]]. Achenbach commented that "She had, at the time, rather vaporous standards of evidence," a reference to her belief in the [[ancient astronauts]] of [[Erich von Däniken]] and the theories of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] pertaining to the solar system.<ref>{{cite book |author=Achenbach, Joel |title=Captured by Aliens: the search for life and truth in a very large universe |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=0-684-84856-2 |pages=95–6 |quote=Her interest in science came primarily from her interest in the philosophy of Karl Marx. ... Druyan herself had, at the time, rather vaporous standards of evidence for her many sundry beliefs (as she later acknowledged). She believed ... that Immanuel Velikovsky in the 1950s had correctly deduced the truth about the solar system. ... She believed in the ancient astronauts of Erich von Daniken.}}</ref>  Druyan freely acknowledged her past views but also asserted that they changed dramatically after marrying [[Carl Sagan]].

{{Quote|I really believe that the marijuana laws are a terrible injustice. They make no sense scientifically, ethically, legally, or any way. They cost a fortune to enforce and we incarcerate hundreds of thousands of people who have done nothing else, but possess or distribute marijuana. Maybe it's because I'm a child of the 60's and marijuana has been such a positive part of my life. I have never seen it as being addictive, having spent weeks, and months, and days of my life (and years) without using marijuana in any form. For me, it's a kind of a sacrament, something that should be used wisely and in the context of a loving family existence. [...] There's a place for alcohol too, but there's no reason why adults shouldn't be allowed to do something which not only doesn't add harm to themselves or others, but is a way to enhance the beauty of life, the beauty of eating, of listening to music, of being with friends and family, of being with the one you love.| Ann Druyan – from her [[video podcast]] ''At Home in the Cosmos with Annie Druyan''<ref>{{cite podcast | url = http://www.ovguide.com/ann-druyan-9202a8c04000641f8000000000008b85 | title = Ann Druyan – A Plea for a Change in the Marijuana Laws Video | publisher = published by Ann Druyan | host = [[OVGuide]] | accessdate = 2013-10-02}}</ref>}}

{{Quote|When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me-it still sometimes happens-and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl. But, the great thing is that when we were together, for nearly twenty years, we lived with a vivid appreciation of how brief and precious life is. We never trivialized the meaning of death by pretending it was anything other than a final parting. Every single moment that we were alive and we were together was miraculous-not miraculous in the sense of inexplicable or supernatural. We knew we were beneficiaries of chance. . . . That pure chance could be so generous and so kind. . . . That we could find each other, as Carl wrote so beautifully in Cosmos, you know, in the vastness of space and the immensity of time. . . . That we could be together for twenty years. That is something which sustains me and it’s much more meaningful. . . . The way he treated me and the way I treated him, the way we took care of each other and our family, while he lived. That is so much more important than the idea I will see him someday. I don't think I'll ever see Carl again. But I saw him. We saw each other. We found each other in the cosmos, and that was wonderful.| Ann Druyan interviewed by the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]<ref name="csicop" />}}

{{Quote|I think the roots of this antagonism to science run very deep. They're ancient. We see them in Genesis, this first story, this [[founding myth]] of ours, in which the first humans are doomed and cursed eternally for asking a question, for partaking of the fruit of the "Tree of Knowledge". It's puzzling that Eden is synonymous with paradise when, if you think about it at all, it's more like a maximum-security prison with twenty-four hour surveillance. It's a horrible place. Adam and Eve have no childhood. They awaken full-grown. What is a human being without a childhood? Our long childhood is a critical feature of our species. It differentiates us, to a degree, from most other species. We take a longer time to mature. We depend upon these formative years and the social fabric to learn many of the things we need to know.| Ann Druyan interviewed by the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]<ref name="csicop"/>}}
