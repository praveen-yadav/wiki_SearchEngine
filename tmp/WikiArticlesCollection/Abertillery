'''Abertillery''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˌ|æ|b|ər|t|ɨ|ˈ|l|ɛər|i}}; {{etymology|cy|Abertyleri|mouth of the river Tyleri}}, {{IPA-cy|abɛrtəˈleːrɪ}}) is a town in the county borough of [[Blaenau Gwent]] in [[South Wales]], {{convert|16|mi}} north-west of [[Newport]], originally on the [[Great Western Railway]].<ref name="Chisholm">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Abertillery|volume=1|page=61}}</ref> Its population rose steeply during the period of [[Mining in Wales|mining]] development in [[South Wales]], being 10,846 in the [[Census in the United Kingdom|1891 census]] and 21,945 ten years later.<ref name="Chisholm"/> Lying in the [[South Wales coalfield|mountainous mining district]] of the former counties of [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] and [[Glamorganshire]], in the valley of the [[Ebbw River|Ebbw Fach]], the population was traditionally employed in the numerous coal-mines, ironworks and tin-plate works, now defunct.<ref name="Chisholm"/> Further up the same valley are the mining townships of [[Nantyglo]] and [[Blaina]].

Abertillery has a traditional-style town centre and several small schools. Today, its population numbers just over 11,000 and is thought to be declining. In 2003, Abertillery was found to have the cheapest [[house]]s in the [[United Kingdom]], according to a survey by the [[Halifax (United Kingdom bank)|Halifax]], with an average price of only [[Pound sterling|£]]37,872.<ref name=cheapest>{{cite news | title = Abertillery's the cheapest town | publisher = South Wales Echo | page = 3 | date = 25 January 2003 }}</ref> Noted for its unspoilt rural scenery, Abertillery neighbours the small districts of [[Aberbeeg]] (''Aber-bîg''), [[Llanhilleth]] (''Llanhiledd''), [[Cwmtillery]] (''Cwmtyleri''), and [[Six Bells]] (''Chwe Chloch'').

The [[coal mining|coal mines]] were the predominant economic emphasis from the 1850's until the mines closed in the 1980's.<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |title=Abertillery |edition = 15th |year=2010|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=30}}</ref> Over the past couple of decades the town has been transformed from an industrial relic into the clean, modernised area it is today – this has largely been achieved due to large amounts of [[European Union]] [[Objective One]] funding which has helped the town remove unsightly reminders of the industrial past. Many of these areas have been utilised as playing fields, [[business park]]s or mixed use land (including the local [[comprehensive school]]). A complete regeneration of the town centre is planned for 2012-2013.

The town's name is pronounced with the emphasis on the penultimate syllable, i.e. it rhymes with ''Mary'', as in a song made popular by Welsh entertainer [[Ryan Davies]]: "''Blodwen and Mary'' from Abertillery..."

The reopening of [[Abertillery railway station]] has been identified as a potential future development of the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]].

According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] and information gathered by The [[Welsh Language Board]] ({{lang-cy|Bwrdd yr Iaith Gymraeg}}), 1,146 (9.9%) of Abertillery speaks Welsh.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.byig-wlb.org.uk/English/publications/Pages/PublicationItem.aspx?puburl=/English%2fpublications%2fPublications%2f786.xls |title=No. & Percentage Welsh speakers 3+ By Community and Age |author=The Welsh Language Board |date=26 February 2004 |format=[[Microsoft Excel#File formats|XLS]] |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>
