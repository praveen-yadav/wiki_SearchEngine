== Bicycling ==
{{Main|Bicycling in Denmark}}
Bicycling in Denmark is a common and popular [[recreation]]al and [[utility cycling|utilitarian]] activity. [[Bicycle-friendly#Cycling_infrastructure|Bicycling infrastructure]] is a dominant feature of both city and countryside infrastructure with [[bicycle path]]s and [[segregated cycle facilities|bicycle ways]] in many places and an extensive network of [[national and regional bicycle routes throughout Denmark|bicycle routes]] extending more than {{convert|12000|km|mi}} nationwide<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.visitdenmark.dk/danmark/da-dk/menu/turist/inspiration/aktivferie/cykel/cykel-ruter-og-regioner.htm | title = Cykelruter og regioner | accessdate =16 August 2011 | publisher = [[VisitDenmark]] | language = Danish}}</ref> (in comparison [[Denmark#Geography|Denmark's coastline]] is {{convert|7314|km|mi}}). As a unique thing, Denmark has a [[Danish bicycle VIN-system|VIN-system for bicycles]] which is mandatory by law. Often bicycling and bicycle-culture in [[Denmark]] is compared to the [[cycling in the Netherlands|Netherlands as a bicycle-nation]].
