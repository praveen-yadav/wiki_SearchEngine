==Name origin==
In 1798, The Holland Land Company hired [[Theophile Cazenove]] of Philadelphia as its agent in the newly established hub for the area in nearby [[Batavia, NY]]. Cazenove then hired Joseph Ellicott to survey the area and establish a village next to Buffalo Creek. Ellicott decided to utilize a hub-and-spoke pattern for the streets of his new village, which he called "New Amsterdam," and centered it around Niagara Square. In 1800, residents of the small village decided they did not like the name "New Amsterdam" and chose to call it "Buffalo." In 1808, the name was officially changed to the Village of Buffalo.

The earliest name—origin theory to appear in print (1825) relates a story about stolen horsemeat being passed off as bison flesh, with the site of the illicit picnic thenceforth remembered as "Buffalo," but the author who conveyed this tale expressed his skepticism.<ref>Ball, Sheldon. ''[http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=nys;cc=nys;idno=nys294;node=nys294%3A1;size=s;frm=frameset;seq=6;view=image;page=root Buffalo in 1825].'' Buffalo, NY: S. Ball, 1825</ref>

A currently popular account also holds that the name "Buffalo" is a corruption of the French phrase ''beau fleuve,'' "beautiful river," a phrase said to have been exclaimed by French explorers upon seeing the [[Niagara River]]. This speculation, however, appears to be contradicted by primary sources; French explorers actually referred to Buffalo Creek in print as ''Rivière aux Chevaux,'' "Horse River."<ref>Houghton, Frederick. The Name Buffalo. Buffalo, NY: Buffalo Historical Society Publications, v. 24, pp. 63–69 [http://books.google.com/books?id=fY4MAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=Buffalo+first+appeared+on+a+map&source=web&ots=Dg-YQZb0Ur&sig=MOPlDcMG_xdKlwbd_3RzF0wjM_U&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPR3,M1 Books.google.com]</ref>

Much current popular opinion assumes that the city of Buffalo could not have been named after the animal so representative of North America, because buffalo ([[bison]]) supposedly never lived in what is now New York State. However, the historical evidence indicates that buffalo were widespread and well known during colonial times in eastern North America, including the area of the current city of Buffalo. Father Louis Hennepin, in his 1698 book "A New Discovery of a Vast Country in America," described his travels through the area (during which his party discovered nearby [[Niagara Falls]]), and in Chap XXX included an unmistakable drawing and description of a bison in a wooded setting (p.&nbsp;146 of reprint of Hennepin's second London issue of 1698, edited by Reuben Gold Thwaites, A.C. McMlurg & Co., Chicago, 1903). In his 1889 book "The Extermination of the American Bison," William T. Hornaday, superintendent of the former National Zoological Park, relayed early European explorers' eyewitness accounts of bison along the shores of Lake Erie very near, if not within, the current location of the city of Buffalo, and as far east as the eastern seaboard. Other sources also indicate that bison were familiar to the earliest European explorers of the eastern seaboard and exclaimed about in their writings, and that later explorers of the interiors of the present Great Lakes states, as well as of most states east of the Mississippi, continued to make note of sightings of bison.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17748/17748-h/17748-h.htm |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Extermination of the American Bison, by William T. Hornaday |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=February 10, 2006 }}</ref>

Thus, although there exists no universally accepted account of exactly how the name of the city came about, it seems probable that it was derived from that of the animal. Many current cities and counties in the Great Lakes region take their names from former English or French frontier forts, and one widely accepted theory points out that the closest of the first European forts to the current site of the city of Buffalo (other than Fort Niagara) was the French Fort Le Boeuf, located inland on a river flowing into Lake Erie in western Pennsylvania, east of Erie and near the current NY border. Fort Le Boeuf existed from 1753 to 1759 at the western boundary of the immense and very hostile Iroquois country, still unsubdued and virtually unsettleable by Europeans at the time. Fort Le Boeuf can be translated as "Fort Buffalo," since it is believed that the name "buffalo" originated with French fur trappers, who called the American bison "boeufs," meaning oxen or bullocks.<ref>{{cite web|author=ddblade |url=http://www3.northern.edu/natsource/MAMMALS/Bison1.htm |title=Bison |publisher=.northern.edu |date=July 24, 1998 }}</ref> Given the sparseness of settlement and the lack of specificity in many frontier place-names, not to mention the uncertainties and inaccuracies in early maps, it is not implausible that the city of Buffalo derived its name directly or indirectly from Fort Le Boeuf.

This theory is lent credence by the fact that the first known written use of the name "Buffalo" in the area of the current city of Buffalo appeared close to the time when Fort Le Boeuf ceased its six years of operations. The Buffalo River may have been named before the town itself, with the city of Buffalo deriving its name from that river, [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo Creek]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/83593/Buffalo/235380/History#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&title=Buffalo%20%3A%3A%20History%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia |title=Encyclopædia Britannica: Buffalo, NY, USA |publisher=Britannica.com |date= }}</ref> as Buffalo Creek first appeared on a map in 1759–1760.<ref>Houghton, p. 63</ref>  The Buffalo River may therefore simply inherited the nearby fort's place-name on maps, with appropriate translation to English, desired because the usual translation of Le Boeuf to "ox" would have lost the desired unique American connotation possessed by the word "buffalo."

Modern-day confusion about the existence of bison in the Buffalo area, despite widespread descriptions of bison by the earliest explorers in most areas east of the Mississippi, may have resulted because reference to bison in the area indeed seem to end before widespread European settlement and the establishment of the city of Buffalo, perhaps due to the advance of European weaponry to the eastern Indians before the advance of European settlements. However, by the time of the establishment of the city of Buffalo, bison (known then popularly as buffalo) had already been established as a spectacular and representative North American animal in the minds of people involved in renaming the city of Buffalo, and a history of naming nearby settlements and locations for the animal had been established even when those settlements were not connected in any way with any landmarks or events unique to the city of Buffalo.

It is therefore likely that Buffalo was directly or indirectly named after the common term for bison, even if the naming was purely historical in the sense that the city was named at a time the animal was probably extirpated in the city's locale, and although Fort Le Boeuf had ceased operation a generation earlier.

However, without additional historical discoveries, it is unlikely that an indisputable historical thread can be established leading to the city of Buffalo's naming.

Prior to the [[Iroquois]] occupation of the region, the region was settled by the [[Neutral Nation]]. Later, the Senecas of the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy conquered the Neutrals. In 1804, [[Joseph Ellicott]], a principal agent of the [[Holland Land Company]], designed a radial street and grid system that branches out from downtown like bicycle spokes.<ref>{{cite web |last = Priebe Jr.|first = J.

On November 4, 1825 the [[Erie Canal]] was completed with Buffalo strategically positioned at the western end of the system. At the time, the population was about 2,400. The Erie Canal brought a surge in population and commerce which led Buffalo to incorporate as a city in 1832, with a population of about 10,000 people.

The City of Buffalo has long been home to African-Americans. An example is the 1828 village directory which listed 59 "Names of Coloured" heads of families.<ref>{{cite web |last = Fordham |first = Monroe |title = Michigan Street Church |work = African American history of Western New York |month = April | year = 1996 |url = http://www.math.buffalo.edu/~sww/0history/hwny-michigan.st.church.html |accessdate = 2007-09-08}}</ref> In 1845, construction was begun on the [[Macedonia Baptist Church (Buffalo, New York)|Macedonia Baptist Church]] (commonly called the ''Michigan Street Baptist Church''). This African-American church was an important meeting place for the abolitionist movement. On February 12, 1974 the church was added to the [[List of Registered Historic Places in Erie County, New York|National Register of Historic Places]]. Abolitionist leaders such as [[William Wells Brown]] made their home in Buffalo.<ref>{{cite web |title= African American history of Western New York |url= http://www.math.buffalo.edu/~sww/0history/wwb0.html |accessdate = 2007-09-08}}</ref> Buffalo was also a terminus point of the [[Underground Railroad]]<ref>{{cite web |title= Underground Railroad Sites in Buffalo, NY |url=http://www.buffaloresearch.com/ugrr.html |accessdate = 2010-07-25}}</ref> with many fugitives crossing the [[Niagara River]] from Buffalo to [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] and freedom.

During the 1840s, Buffalo's port continued to develop. Both passenger and commercial traffic expanded with some 93,000 passengers heading west from the port of Buffalo.<ref name="The City of Buffalo 1840-1850" >{{cite web |last = Priebe Jr. |first = J.

In 1843, the world's first steam-powered [[grain elevator]] was constructed by local merchant Joseph Dart, Jr. and engineer Robert Dunbar. The "Dart Elevator" enabled faster unloading of [[lake freighter]]s along with the transshipment of grain in bulk from lakers to canal boats and, later on, rail cars.<ref name = "The City of Buffalo 1840-1850"/>

Abraham Lincoln visited Buffalo on February 16, 1861 on his trip to accept the presidency of the United States.

[[Grover Cleveland]] served as Sheriff of Erie County (1871–1873), and was Mayor of Buffalo in 1882. He was later [[Governor of New York]] (1883–1885), 22nd President of the United States (1885–1889) and 24th President (1893–1897).

In May 1896, the [[Ellicott Square Building]] opened. For the next 16 years, it was the largest office building in the world. It was named after the surveyor Joseph Ellicott.

At the dawn of the 20th century, local mills were among the first to benefit from [[hydroelectric power]] generated via the Niagara River. The city got the nickname ''City of Light'' at this time due to the widespread electric lighting.<ref name="cityjournal">[http://www.city-journal.org/html/17_4_buffalo_ny.html Can Buffalo Ever Come Back?] from ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]''</ref> In 1881, Buffalo deployed the first electric street lights in the United States.

President [[William McKinley]] was [[William McKinley assassination|shot and mortally wounded]] at the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in Buffalo on September 6, 1901. He died in the city eight days later and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was sworn in at the [[Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site|Wilcox Mansion]] as the 26th President of the United States.

An international bridge, known as the [[Peace Bridge]], linking Buffalo to [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] was opened in 1927. The [[Buffalo Central Terminal]], a 17-story [[Art Deco]] style station designed by architects [[Fellheimer & Wagner]] for the [[New York Central Railroad]], was finished just weeks before the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].

During [[World War II]], Buffalo saw a period of prosperity and low unemployment due to its position as a manufacturing center.<ref>{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = 1941–1945| work = History| publisher =Parkside Community Association| date =| url = http://www.parksidebuffalo.org/history.html| doi =| accessdate = }}</ref><ref>{{cite web

With the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in 1957, which cut the city off from valuable trade routes; deindustrialization; and the nation-wide trend of suburbanization; the city's economy began to deteriorate. Like much of the [[Rust Belt]], Buffalo, which peaked at more than half a million people in the 1950s, has seen its population decline by almost 50 percent as industries shut down and people left for the suburbs or other cities.

Like other [[rust belt]] cities such as [[Flint, Michigan]], Buffalo has attempted to revitalize its beleaguered economy and crumbling infrastructure. In the first decade of the 21st century, a massive increase in economic development spending has attempted to reverse its dwindling prosperity. $4 billion was spent in 2007 compared to a $50 million average for the previous ten years.<ref>{{cite web |title= current city development projects 2007|url= http://www.ci.buffalo.ny.us/files/1_2_1/splanning/listofprojects/ListBuffDev101007.pdf |accessdate = 2007-11-04|format=PDF}}</ref> New proposals and renovations are numerous, especially in the downtown core. As of 2008, the population has continued to decrease, despite the efforts of city officials. (See demographics section.) In September 2011, the city received national attention about bullying when [[Suicide of Jamey Rodemeyer|Jamey Rodemeyer]] committed suicide due to anti-gay bullying.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/jamey-rodemeyer-suicide-ny-police-open-criminal-investigation/story?id=14580832 Jamey Rodemeyer Suicide: Police Consider Criminal Bullying Charges] retrieved November 17, 2012</ref>

==Geography and climate==
[[File:BuffaloAvgTemps.png|right|thumb|Buffalo average temperatures]]

===Geography===
Buffalo is located on the eastern end of [[Lake Erie]], opposite [[Fort Erie, Ontario]], and at the beginning of the [[Niagara River]], which flows northward over [[Niagara Falls]] and into [[Lake Ontario]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|52.5|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|40.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|11.9|sqmi|km2}} is water. The total area is 22.66% water.

===Climate===
[[File:BuffInBloom.jpg|thumb|right|Buffalo in bloom]]
[[File:Blizzard of 1977.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blizzard of 1977]]]]
The Buffalo area experiences a fairly humid, [[humid continental climate|continental-type]] climate, but with a definite [[maritime climate|maritime]] flavor due to strong modification from the [[Great Lakes]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] "Dfb"&nbsp;— uniform precipitation distribution). The transitional seasons are very brief in Buffalo and Western New York.

Buffalo has a reputation for snowy winters, but it is rarely the [[Golden Snowball Award|snowiest city in New York State]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldensnowball.com/yearly-winners-golden-award.htm|author=Madsen, Steve|title=Comparison Golden Snowball  City Stats 1940 - 2007|publisher=Goldensnowball}}, Retrieved 2013-5-31.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://weatherbug.excite.com/StormCentral/Excite/StormCentral.aspx?no_cookie_zip=90012&no_cookie_stat=LNFR3&no_cookie_world_stat=&zcode=z4639&story_id=6117&lid=SCSPS|date=January 3, 2012|author=WeatherBug Meteorologists|title=What Are The Snowiest Cities In The U.S.?|publisher=Weatherbug}}, Retrieved 2013-5-31.</ref> Winters in Western New York are generally cold and [[snowstorm|snowy]], but are changeable and include frequent thaws and rain as well. Winters can also be quite long in Western New York, usually spanning from mid-November to mid-March. Snow covers the ground more often than not from late December into early March, but periods of bare ground are not uncommon. Over half of the annual snowfall comes from the [[lake effect snow|lake effect]] process and is very localized. Lake effect snow occurs when cold air crosses the relatively warm lake waters and becomes saturated, creating clouds and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] downwind. Due to the prevailing winds, areas south of Buffalo receive much more lake effect snow than locations to the north. The lake snow machine starts as early as mid-November, peaks in December, then virtually shuts down after [[Lake Erie]] freezes in mid-to-late January. The most well-known snowstorm in Buffalo's history, the [[Blizzard of 1977|Blizzard of '77]], was not a lake effect snowstorm in Buffalo in the normal sense of that term (Lake Erie was frozen over at the time), but instead resulted from a combination of high winds and snow previously accumulated both on land and on frozen Lake Erie. Snow does not typically impair the city's operation, but can cause significant damage during the autumn as with the [[Lake Storm "Aphid"|October 2006 storm]].

Buffalo has the sunniest and driest summers of any major city in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], but still has enough rain to keep vegetation green and lush.<ref>[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/buf/bufclifo.htm Buffalo's Climate]. ''National Weather Service''. Retrieved July 5, 2006.</ref> Summers are marked by plentiful sunshine and moderate [[humidity]] and temperature. It receives, on average, over 65% of possible sunshine in June, July and August. Obscured by the notoriety of Buffalo's winter snow is the fact that Buffalo benefits from other lake effects such as the cooling southwest breezes off [[Lake Erie]] in summer that gently temper the warmest days. As a result, the Buffalo station of the National Weather Service has never recorded an official temperature of {{convert|100|F|1|abbr=on}} or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USNY0181?from=tenDay_bottomnav_undeclared |title=Weather.com.

The stabilizing effect of [[Lake Erie]] continues to inhibit [[thunderstorms]] and enhance sunshine in the immediate Buffalo area through most of July. August usually has more showers and is hotter and more humid as the warmer lake loses its temperature-stabilizing influence.

The highest recorded temperature in Buffalo was {{convert|99|°F|0}} on August 27, 1948,<ref name="Aug Averages">{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/health/fitness/wxclimatology/daily/USNY0181?climoMonth=8 |title=August Daily Averages for Buffalo, NY  |publisher=weather.com |accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref> and the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|−20|°F|0}} on February 9, 1934 and February 2, 1961.<ref name="Feb Averages">{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/health/fitness/wxclimatology/daily/USNY0181?climoMonth=2 |title= February Daily Averages for Buffalo, NY |publisher=weather.com |accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref>

===City proper===
Like most formerly industrial cities of the Great Lakes region, Buffalo has experienced an economic depression brought about by the loss of its industrial base. The city's population peaked in 1950, when it was the 15th largest city in the United States and its population has declined every census since then. The demographic change and the impact of such change on the industrial cities of the region, including Buffalo, is significant; based on the 2006 US Census estimate, Buffalo's current population is equivalent to its population in the year 1890, reversing 120 years of demographic change.

Although the trend is inconclusive at this time, current census estimates indicate the rate of population loss may be decelerating to a stable state. The 2008–2009 loss estimate is 50% less than the years prior, and is at less than 1% year-over-year loss. Whether this trend will continue will not be evident until next year's estimate.

At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], the city's population was 50.4% White (45.8% non-Hispanic White alone), 38.6% Black or African American, 0.8% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.2% Asian, 3.9% from some other race and 3.1% from two or more races. 10.5% of the total population was Hispanic or Latino of any race.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/3611000.html |title=Buffalo Demographics: 2010 |publisher=quickfacts.census.go |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref>

At the time of the 2000 census there were 292,648 people, 122,720 households, and 67,005 [[family|families]] residing in the city. The population density is 7,205.8 people per square mile (2,782.4/km²). There are 145,574 [[house|housing]] units at an average density of 3,584.4 per square mile (1,384.1/km²). The [[Race (U.S. Census)|racial]] makeup of the city is 54.43% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 37.23% African American, 0.77% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 1.40% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.04% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 3.68% from other races, and 2.45% from two or more races. 7.54% of the population are [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or Latino of any race. The top 5 largest ancestries include [[German American|German]] (13.6%), [[Irish American|Irish]] (12.2%), [[Italian American|Italian]] (11.7%), [[Polish American|Polish]] (11.7%), and [[English American|English]] (4.0%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/city/Buffalo-New-York.html |title=Buffalo, New York (NY) Detailed Profile – relocation, real estate, travel, jobs, hospitals, schools, crime, news, sex offenders |publisher=City-data.com |date= }}</ref>

There were 122,720 households out of which 28.6% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 27.6% are married couples living together, 22.3% have a female householder with no husband present, and 45.4% are non-families. 37.7% of all households are made up of individuals and 12.1% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 2.29 and the average family size is 3.07.

In the city the population included 26.3% under the age of 18, 11.3% from 18 to 24, 29.3% from 25 to 44, 19.6% from 45 to 64, and 13.4% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 34 years. For every 100 females there are 88.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 83.5 males.

The [[median household income|median income]] for a household in the city is $24,536, and the median income for a family is $30,614. Males have a median income of $30,938 versus $23,982 for females. The per capita income for the city is $14,991. 26.6% of the population and 23.0% of families are below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 38.4% of those under the age of 18 and 14.0% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.

[[File:Buffalo NY historical population.png|left|thumb|Population of Buffalo, 1830–2006]]

Buffalo has very sizable populations of [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian American|Italian]], [[Polish American|Polish]], [[German American|German]], [[Jewish American|Jewish]], [[Greek American|Greek]], [[Arab American|Arab]], African American, [[Indian American|Indian]], and [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Rican]] descent. Major ethnic neighborhoods still exist but they changed significantly in the second half of the 20th century. In 1940, [[non-Hispanic Whites]] were 96.8% of the city's population.<ref>{{cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html}}</ref> Traditionally, [[Polish-Americans]] were the predominant occupants of the [[East Side, Buffalo, New York|East Side]], while Italian-Americans composed a close-knit neighborhood in the west side. The [[East Side, Buffalo, New York|East Side]] is now a predominantly African American neighborhood, while the West Side has become a [[melting pot]] of many ethnicities, with Latino culture being the strongest influence. Throughout the history of Buffalo, the neighborhoods collectively called the First Ward, as well as much of [[South Buffalo]], have comprised almost entirely people of [[Irish descent]]. Recently, there has been an influx of inhabitants that are of Arab descent, mainly from Yemen, as the city's [[Muslim]] population has increased to approximately 3000 according to an estimate.<ref>http://wings.buffalo.edu/sa/muslim/LocalMosques.htm {{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> Since the 1950s and 1960s, the greater portion of the Jewish population has moved to the suburban areas outside of the city, or to the city's upper West Side.

===History===
Buffalo and the surrounding area were long involved in railroad commerce, steel manufacture, [[automobile]] production, aircraft/aerospace design and production, Great Lakes shipping, and grain storage. Most of these industries have left the city through the years. Major steel production no longer exists in the area, although several smaller steel mills remain in operation. For example, Gibraltar Industries, a leading manufacturer, processor, and distributor of steel products for the building, industrial, and vehicular markets is headquartered in Buffalo. As of the [[1950 United States Census]], Buffalo was the 15th largest city in the country, the nation's largest inland port (twelfth overall), second biggest rail center, sixth largest steel producer, and eighth largest manufacturer.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Greater Look at Greater Buffalo|page=58|publisher=Windsor Publications|isbn=978-0-89781-198-9|year=1986|author=Bisco, Jim}}</ref>

The regional economy can now best be described as a mix of industrial, light manufacturing, high technology and service-oriented private sector companies. Instead of relying on a single industry or sector for its economic future, the region has taken a diversified approach that have the potential to create opportunities for growth and expansion in the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://rkn.buffalo.edu/reports/region_quick_results.cfm?type=4 |title= Binational Buffalo Niagara Region Report |author= University at Buffalo Regional Institute|publisher= UB Regional Institute|year=2011 |work=Regional Knowledge Network |accessdate=February 2, 2011 }}</ref>

===Race===
On October 25, 2008 the United Nations released a report entitled "State of the World's Cities" in which the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area was specifically cited as having one of the worst rates of economic inequality in the world and that it was racially based. The report specifically stated "the report cited figures from western New York state, where 40 per cent of black, Hispanic and ethnically mixed households earned less than $15,000 in 1999, as compared to 15 per cent of white households."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2008/10/2008102321493551343.html |title=UN: Major inequality in US cities – Americas |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= }}</ref> In addition, the United States Census department also released information placing the Buffalo-Niagara metro area, as the 8th most segregated area in America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusscope.org/us/rank_dissimilarity_white_black.html |title=Segregation: Dissimilarity Indices |publisher=CensusScope |date= }}</ref>

===Employment===
Overall, employment in Buffalo has shifted as its population has declined and manufacturing has left. Buffalo's 2005 unemployment rate was 6.6%, contrasted with New York State's 5.0% rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.labor.state.ny.us/workforceindustrydata/wny/WesternSlideShows.asp |title=See Erie County |publisher=Labor.state.ny.us |date= }}</ref> And from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the fourth quarter of 2006, Erie County had no net job growth, ranking it 271st among the 326 largest counties in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cewqtr.t01.htm |title=BLS, Table 1.

Yet other sectors of the economy have outdistanced manufacturing and are seeing large increases. Educational and health services added over 30,400 jobs in 2006 and over 20,500 jobs have been added in the professional and business (mostly finance) arena.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/ |title='&#39;bizjournals.com'&#39; |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=October 24, 2012 }}</ref>

===Life sciences===
Buffalo has increasingly become a center for [[bioinformatics]] and [[human genome]] research, including work by researchers at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] and the [[Roswell Park Cancer Institute]]. This consortium is known as the [[Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus]]. It also includes: Buffalo Hearing & Speech Center, Buffalo Medical Group Foundation, [[Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute]], Kaleida Health, Olmsted Center for the Visually Impaired, Cleveland BioLabs and Upstate New York Transplant Services. The DNA samples used in The Human Genome Project were also collected from anonymous donors from Buffalo.

Entrepreneurial resources and life science business consultants accelerate the growth and development of emerging companies found within the [[Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus]] and Upstate New York Region. For example, Buffalo BioSciences is a technology commercialization partner to the New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics & Life Sciences and contributed to the launch and early success of Empire Genomics&nbsp;–- a firm based on research conducted at Roswell Park Cancer Institute by Dr. Norma Nowak<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empiregenomics.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=60&Itemid=82 |title=About the Founder |publisher=Empiregenomics.com |date=March 18, 2008 }}</ref> enabling the delivery of personalized medicine.

===Banking===
[[File:Buffalo savingsbank.JPG|thumb|right|[[Buffalo Savings Bank]] Building]]
Buffalo is the headquarters of [[M&T Bank]], a large regional bank with assets over $79B (as of June 2011).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mtb.com/aboutus/Pages/WhoIsMT.aspx |title=M&T Bank : Who Is M&T |publisher=Mtb.com |date= }}</ref> [[HSBC Bank USA]] has reduced its local operations in Buffalo, and Upstate NY as a whole, as it closed its retail banking centers. Many of the shuttered HSBC retail banking centers in upstate were acquired by First Niagara Bank (see below). Other banks, such as [[Bank of America]] and [[KeyBank]] have corporate operations in Buffalo. [[Citigroup]] also has regional offices in [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]], Buffalo's largest suburb. Buffalo has also become a hub of the debt collection industry.<ref>{{cite news| last = Thompson | first = Carolyn | authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Buffalo's debt collectors accused of bullying =| agency = Associated Press| date = January 5, 2010| url = http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Buffalos-debt-collectors-apf-2226423347.html?x=0| doi =| accessdate = 2010-01-05}}</ref>

[[First Niagara Bank]] recently moved its headquarters to downtown Buffalo from nearby [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport]]. First Niagara has branches from Buffalo to [[Albany, New York]], and since September 2009 has had branches as far south as [[Pittsburgh]]. On September 10, 2009, First Niagara announced the relocation of its corporate headquarters from Lockport to downtown Buffalo. The company says facilities in Lockport will remain open and fully staffed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fnfg.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=847 |title=First Niagara 2009 |publisher=Fnfg.com |date= }}</ref> First Niagara, which had been considering expanding into [[Western Pennsylvania]] for some time,<ref name=PNC>[http://kdka.com/business/PNC.First.Niagara.2.978660.html KDKA-TV] {{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> benefited from [[PNC Financial Services]] being required by the [[United States Department of Justice]] to sell off 50 [[National City Corp.|National City]] branches in the [[Pittsburgh]] area and 11 more branches in and around [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] to competitors,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/branches-divested.pdf |title=United States Department of Justice |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}</ref> since the two banks had significant overlap in [[Western Pennsylvania]] and had potential [[antitrust]] issues in that area.

[[File:Buffalo City Hall HDR.jpg|thumb|right|Buffalo's [[Art Deco]] [[Buffalo City Hall|city hall]]]]
{{See also|List of mayors of Buffalo, New York}}

At the [[City (New York)|municipal]] level, the City of Buffalo has a mayor and a council consisting of nine [[city council|councilmembers]]. Buffalo also serves as the seat of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] with some of the 11 members of county legislature representing at least a portion of Buffalo. At the state level, there are three state [[New York State Assembly|assemblymembers]] and two state [[New York State Senate|senators]] representing parts of the city proper. At the federal level, Buffalo is represented by three members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

In a trend common to Northern "[[Rust Belt]]" regions, political life in Buffalo has been dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] for the last half-century, and has been roiled by racial division and social issues. The last time anyone other than a Democrat held the position of Mayor in Buffalo was 1965 [Chester A. Kowal].<ref>[[Chester A. Kowal]]</ref> In 1977, Democratic Mayor [[James D. Griffin]] was first elected as the nominee of two minor parties, the [[Conservative Party (New York)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Right to Life Party]], after he lost the Democratic primary for Mayor to then Deputy State Assembly Speaker [[Arthur Eve]]. Griffin switched political allegiance several times during his 16 years as Mayor, generally hewing to socially conservative platforms. His successor, Democrat [[Anthony M. Masiello]] (elected in 1993) continued to campaign on [[social conservatism]], often crossing party lines in his endorsements and alliances. In 2005, however, Democrat [[Byron Brown]] was elected the city's first African-American mayor in a landslide (64%–27%) over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Kevin Helfer, who ran on a conservative platform.

This change in local politics was preceded by a fiscal crisis in 2003 when years of economic decline, a diminishing tax-base, and civic mismanagement left the city deep in debt and teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. At the urging of [[New York State Comptroller]] [[Alan Hevesi]], the state took over the management of Buffalo's finances, appointing the [[Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority]]. Conversations about merging the city with the larger Erie County government were initiated the following year by Mayor Tony Masiello, but came to naught.

===Parks===
{{Main|Buffalo, New York parks system}}
[[File:Buffalo Botanical Gardens.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens]]]]

One of Buffalo's many monikers is the ''City of Trees'', which describes the abundance of green in the city. In fact, Buffalo has more than 20 parks with multiple ones being accessible from any part of the city.

The Olmsted Park and Parkway System is the hallmark of Buffalo's many green spaces. Three-fourths of city park land is part of the system, which comprises six major parks, eight connecting parkways, nine circles and seven smaller spaces. Begun in 1868 by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and his partner [[Calvert Vaux]], the system was integrated into the city and marks the first attempt in America to lay out a coordinated system of public parks and parkways. The Olmsted designed portions of the Buffalo park system are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and are maintained by the [http://www.buffaloolmstedparks.org/ Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy].

===Waterfront===
[[File:Buffharbor view.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]
[[File:Buff harbor.jpg|thumb|right|225px]]
Situated at the confluence of [[Lake Erie]] and the [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo River]] and [[Niagara River]]s, Buffalo is a waterfront city. The city's rise to economic power came through its waterways in the form of [[transshipment]], manufacturing, and an endless source of energy. Buffalo's waterfront remains, though to a lesser degree, a hub of commerce, trade, and industry.

As of 2009, a significant portion of Buffalo's waterfront is being transformed into a focal point for social and recreational activity. Recently excavated and rewatered is the Erie Canal [[Commercial Slip]], which is the original western terminus of the Erie Canal System. This is intended to revitalize the original [[Erie Canal Harbor]], with shops, eateries, and high-rise condominiums. Buffalo's intent is to stress its relatively architectural and historical heritage, creating a tourism destination.

===Standard of living===
The loss of traditional jobs in manufacturing, rapid suburbanization and high costs of labor have led to economic decline, making Buffalo one of the poorest among U.S. cities with populations of more than 250,000 people. An estimated 28.7–29.9% of Buffalo residents live below the poverty line, behind either only Detroit,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/cchd/povertyusa/povfact6.shtml |title=Poverty USA – Catholic Campaign for Human Development – A hand up, not a hand out |publisher=Usccb.org |date=July 27, 2011 }}</ref> or only Detroit and [[Cleveland]].<ref>[http://www.wgrz.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=60244&catid=37 Buffalo 3rd Poorest Large City].

This, in part, has led to the [[Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area]] having the most affordable housing market in the U.S. today. The quarterly NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index (HOI) noted that nearly 90% of the new and existing homes sold in the metropolitan area during the second quarter were affordable to families making the area's median income of $57,000. The area median price of homes was $75,000.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Buffalo faces issues with vacant and abandoned houses, as the city ranks second only to [[St. Louis]] on the list of American cities with the most vacant properties per capita. Since 2000, the city has torn down 2,000 vacant homes but as many as 10,000 still remain. Mayor Byron W. Brown recently unveiled a $100 million, five-year plan to demolish 5,000 more houses.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/13/nyregion/13vacant.html?_r=1&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/B/Belson,%20Ken&oref=slogin Vacant Houses, Scourge of a Beaten-down Buffalo].

==Culture==

===Nicknames===
"The Queen City", Buffalo's most common moniker, first appeared in print in the 1840s, referring to the city's status as the second largest city in New York State after New York City. "The Queen City" was also used during the 19th century to describe Buffalo as the second largest American city on the [[Great Lakes]] after Chicago. Buffalo has also been called ''The Nickel City'' due to the appearance of a bison on the back of [[Nickel (U.S. coin)|Indian Head nickel]] in the early part of the 20th century. ''The City of Good Neighbors'' refers to the helpful, friendly spirit of its inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite news| last =| first =| coauthors =| title = Buffalo Widely Knows as 'City of Good Neighbors'| newspaper = Washington Afro-American| location =| page = 20| publisher =| date = August 14, 1951| url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2238&dat=19510814&id=CjsmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rv4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=4955,329648| accessdate =April 4, 2010}}</ref> In the early 20th century, the city began calling itself the ''City of Light'' both because of the plentiful hydroelectric power made possible by nearby [[Niagara Falls]] and because it was the first city in America to have electric street lights.<ref name="cityjournal"/>

===People===
Buffalo was first settled primarily by [[New England]]ers. The first wave of European immigrants was a large influx of [[German American|Germans]]. The city was further populated by [[Irish American|Irish]] immigrants first, Erie Canal builders and then escaping [[Irish Potato Famine (1845–1849)|famine]], and infused by [[Polish American|Polish]], [[Italian American|Italian]], [[Jewish American|Jewish]], and more recently Latino populations, all of which have made it a [[melting pot]] of ethnic cultures. The newest immigrants are from Somalia, Sudan and Asia.

The Old First Ward retains a strong Irish identity, and Kaisertown reflects a German heritage. Buffalo's [[Polish diaspora|Polonia]] is centered at the Broadway Market on the East Side. The market serves as a microcosm of Polish/Slavic traditions and delicacies.<ref>{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = The History of the Broadway Market| work =| publisher = The Broadway Market| year = 2009| url = http://broadwaymarket.org/?page_id=2| format =| doi =| accessdate =April 4, 2010}}</ref> The East Side is now home to African Americans, many of whom came north during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. The annual [[Juneteenth]] Festival is a large cultural celebration organized by African Americans<ref>[http://www.juneteenthofbuffalo.com/ Juneteenth Festival of Buffalo, NY]. Retrieved July 7, 2007.</ref> in [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] Park.

The West Side is home to the city's [[Hispanic]] community, predominantly of Puerto Rican descent. The West Side was once Buffalo's "Little Italy," but in the 1980s much of Buffalo's Italian American community moved to North Buffalo. There is also a small Italian-American enclave in the East Side neighborhood of Lovejoy. Many Buffalo households, churches, and restaurants continue to observe the Sicilian custom of preparing [[St. Joseph's Day]] (March 19) tables, at which various meatless [[Lent]]en courses are laid out for the poor.

Buffalo is also home to a large [[American Jews|Jewish]] community. [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] immigrants originally settled on Buffalo's Westside in the mid-19th century. Lower income [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Russian Jews]] and [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] immigrating to the [[Niagara Frontier]] in the early 20th century initially settled on the Lower East Side, near William Street and Jefferson Avenue. The community migrated to the Masten Park neighborhood on the East Side, and then to [[North Buffalo, Buffalo, New York|North Buffalo]] between the 1940s and the 1960s. Although many still live in the city, particularly in North Buffalo and the Delaware District on the city's Westside, the majority of the Buffalo area's Jews now live in the northeastern suburbs. Buffalo's [[Jewish Community Center|Jewish Community centers]] are located in the Delaware District, North Buffalo and Amherst.

The New York Times has declared that Buffalo is one of the top cities in America for architecture. Approximately 80 sites are included on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Buffalo, New York|National Register of Historic Places]]. All of the major American architects of the 19th and early 20th century built masterpieces in Buffalo, most of which are still standing. They include:

The country's largest intact parks system designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]], including [[Delaware Park-Front Park System|Delaware Park]]. Buffalo was the first city for which Olmsted designed (in 1869) an interconnected park and parkway system rather than stand-alone parks.

The [[Prudential (Guaranty) Building (Buffalo, New York)|Guaranty Building]], by [[Louis Sullivan]], was one of the first steel-supported, curtain-walled buildings in the world, and its 13 stories made it, at the time it was built (1895), the tallest building in Buffalo and one of the world's first true skyscrapers.<ref>[http://ah.bfn.org/a/church/28/tc.html Louis Sullivan – Guaranty / Prudential Building]. Retrieved July 7, 2007 {{Wayback | url=http://ah.bfn.org/a/church/28/tc.html | date=20070702045925 }}</ref> It is a [[National Historic Landmark]].

The Hotel Buffalo (originally the Statler Hotel) by August Esenwein and [[James A. Johnson (architect)|James A. Johnson]] was the first hotel in the world to feature a private bath in each room.

The [[H. H. Richardson Complex]], originally the New York State Asylum for the Insane, is [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] in style and was the largest commission designed by prominent architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson]]. The grounds of this hospital were designed by Olmsted. Though currently in a state of disrepair, New York State has allocated funds to restore this treasure.

There are several buildings by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], including the [[Darwin D. Martin House]], [[George Barton House]], [[William R. Heath House]], [[Walter V. Davidson House]], [[Graycliff|The Graycliff Estate]], as well as the now demolished [[Larkin Administration Building]].<ref>[http://ah.bfn.org/a/soldiers/76/ William Heath House].

Along as a tourist destination, it functionally serves many Buffalo-area rowing teams belonging to the West Side Rowing Club. Buffalo has more [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] buildings than any other city except Chicago.

The [[Buffalo City Hall]] building by George Dietel and John J. Wade is a spectacular [[art deco]] skyscraper and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It is also because New York law allows bars to be open until 4&nbsp;am (However, local municipalities can override it to an earlier time.)

Several distinct and [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]] districts have grown around clusters of bars and nightclubs in the city. The most visible nightlife district is West Chippewa Street,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westchippewa.com/ |title=Buffalo Bills, Buffalo Sabres, Buffalo NightLife, chippewa street, west chippewa street, Chippewa Street, West Chippewa Street |publisher=Westchippewa.com |date= }}</ref> located between Main Street and South Elmwood Avenue.  [[Allentown, Buffalo, New York|Allentown]] is a several minute walk north to Allen Street. Allen Street near Main Street houses several bars, while Allen near Elmwood has many bars that feature live music. Continuing up Elmwood Avenue from Allentown is the Elmwood Strip, which runs about two miles (3&nbsp;km) to [[Buffalo State College]]. This strip has numerous small boutiques and restaurants, with few large corporate establishments.

===Public festivals===
Like many large cities, numerous festivals have become part of the city's culture and tradition. Though most of the festivals occur during the summer months, the city has recently pushed efforts to have winter festivals as well in an effort to capitalize on the region's snowy reputation.

===Airport===
Buffalo is served by the [[Buffalo Niagara International Airport]], located in [[Cheektowaga]]. The airport, recently re-constructed, serves over 5 million passengers a year and is still growing. Buffalo Niagara International Airport ranks among the five cheapest airports from which to fly in the country, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The average round trip flight cost is $295.58.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buffaloniagara.org/files/content/Industry/Back_Office.pdf|title=Buffalo Niagara Region Shared Services Opportunities|publisher=Buffaloniagra.org}}, Retrieved 2013-5-31.</ref> In the last few years there has been a surge in Canadians flying out of Buffalo, mainly due to much cheaper tax and airline surcharges, as compared with Canadian airports and the ability to fly on some US based discount carriers not available in Canada (for example, [[JetBlue Airways]] and [[Southwest Airlines]]). As of 2006, plans are in the works by U.S. Senator [[Charles Schumer]] to make the under-used [[Niagara Falls International Airport]] into an international cargo hub for New York and [[Toronto]], as well as Canada as a whole.<ref>{{cite news|title=Niagara airport pushed as trade hub; Schumer joins effort to bring global cargo|author=Bill Michelmore|work=Buffalo News|page=B1|date=June 26, 2006}}</ref>
[[File:Main Court Building, Buffalo.JPG|right|thumb|The [[Buffalo Metro Rail|Metro Rail]] in downtown]]

===Public transit===
[[File:NFTAMetroRail.jpg|thumb|right|An outbound NFTA Metro Rail train pulls into Fountain Plaza Station]]
The [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]] (NFTA) operates Buffalo Niagara International Airport and [[Niagara Falls International Airport]], and the [[public transport|public transit]] system throughout the Buffalo area. The [[NFTA]] operates bus lines throughout the city and suburbs, as well as the [[Buffalo Metro Rail|Metro Rail]] transit system in the city.

The Buffalo Metro Rail is a {{convert|6.4|mi|km}} long, single line [[light rail]] system that extends from [[Erie Canal Harbor]] in downtown Buffalo to the [[University Heights, Buffalo, New York|University Heights]] district (specifically, the South Campus of [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]]) in the northeastern part of the city. The downtown section of the line runs above ground and is free of charge to passengers. North of Theater Station, at the northern end of downtown, the line moves underground, remaining underground until it reaches the northern terminus of the line at University Heights. Passengers pay a fare to ride this section of the rail.

A new NFTA project is underway, often called "Cars on Main Street", that will substantially revise the downtown portion of the Metro Rail. It will allow vehicular traffic and Metro Rail cars to share Main St. in a manner similar to that of the trolleys of [[Muni Metro|San Francisco]]. The design includes new stations and pedestrian-friendly improvements. The first phase of the project, restoring two way traffic on Main Street between Edward and West Tupper, was completed in 2009. When the entire project is complete in the next few years, the downtown portion of Main St. will be re-opened to vehicular traffic for the first time in almost 30 years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Intercity rail===
Two train stations, [[Buffalo-Depew (Amtrak station)|Buffalo-Depew]] and [[Buffalo-Exchange Street Station|Buffalo-Exchange Street]] serve the city and are operated by [[Amtrak]]. Historically the city was a major stop on through routes between Chicago and New York City through the lower Ontario peninsula.<ref name=drury>{{cite book | last = Drury | first = George H. | authorlink =  | coauthors = | title = The Historical Guide to North American Railroads: Histories, Figures, and Features of more than 160 Railroads Abandoned or Merged since 1930 | publisher = Kalmbach Publishing | year = 1994 | location = [[Waukesha, Wisconsin]] | pages = 91, 229–231| doi = | id = | isbn = 0-89024-072-8}}</ref> Additionally, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] ran trains between Buffalo and [[Washington, D.C.]] on the [[Buffalo Line]] through central [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>1957 Pennsylvania Railroad schedules reprinted at http://www.therailwire.net/forum/index.php?topic=17913.15</ref>

Freight service for Buffalo is served by [[CSX Transportation]] and [[Norfolk Southern]] (NS), as well as [[Canadian National]] (CN) and [[Canadian Pacific]] (CP) railroads from across the Border. The area has 4 large rail yards: Frontier (CSX), Bison (NS), SK (NS / CP) and Buffalo Creek (NS / CSX). A large amount of hazardous cargo also crosses through the Buffalo area, such as liquid [[propane]] and [[anhydrous ammonia]].

===Waterways===
Buffalo is at the eastern end of one of the [[Great Lakes]], [[Lake Erie]], which boasts the greatest variety of freshwater sportfish in the country. The Lake serves as a playground for numerous personal yachts, sailboats, power boats and watercraft. The city has an extensive [[breakwall]] system protecting its inner and outer Lake Erie [[harbor]]s, which are maintained at commercial navigation depths for [[Great Lakes]] freighters.

A Lake Erie tributary that flows through south Buffalo is the [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo River]], for which the city is named. Buffalo is historically linked to the fabled [[Erie Canal]], which ends where the [[Black Rock Channel]] enters [[Lake Erie]]. When the Canal was dedicated in 1825, its conceiver, New York State governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] took waters from Lake Erie at Buffalo's Western Terminus of the Canal (now the [[Commercial Slip]]). He sailed to New York City on the Canal packet ''[[Seneca Chief]]'', which later returned to Buffalo with Atlantic Ocean water. The seawater was poured into the Lake by Judge and future Buffalo Mayor [[Samuel Wilkeson]]. Once a major route for passengers and cargo, the Erie Canal played a primary role in opening up the American West to settlers from the east.  The Canal is now used primarily for pleasure craft and some light local freight, and in Buffalo it bypasses the swift upper reach of the [[Niagara River]]. A tributary of the Niagara River is [[Scajaquada Creek]], which flows though Buffalo, via the [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]-designed Delaware Lake and Park.
