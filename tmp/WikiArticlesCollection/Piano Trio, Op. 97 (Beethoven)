The '''Piano Trio in B-flat major''', [[opus number|Op.]] 97, by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] is a [[piano trio]] for [[piano]], [[violin]], and [[cello]], finished in 1811.  It is commonly referred to as the '''Archduke Trio''', because it was dedicated to [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria (1788–1831)|Archduke Rudolph of Austria]], an amateur pianist who was a friend and composition student of Beethoven.

The trio was written late in the composer's so-called "middle period". He began composing it in the summer of 1810, and completed it in March 1811.

The first public performance was given by Beethoven himself, [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]] (violin) and Josef Linke (cello) at the Viennese hotel Zum römischen Kaiser on 11 April 1814, as his deafness continued to encroach upon his ability as a performer.  The violinist and composer [[Louis Spohr]] wrote: "In forte passages the poor deaf man pounded on the keys until the strings jangled and in piano he played so softly that whole groups of notes were omitted." It was Beethoven's last performance in the role of pianist.<ref>[http://www.supraphon.cz/cs/novinky/archiv-dle-kategorii/vazna-hudba/&list%5Bsort%5D=&list%5Boffset%5D=5?item=639 Sleevenote of the Supraphon CD (SU 3959-2)]</ref> 

Although the "Archduke Trio" is sometimes numbered as "No. 7", the numbering of Beethoven's twelve piano trios is not standardized, and in other sources the Op. 97 trio may be shown as having a different number, if any.
