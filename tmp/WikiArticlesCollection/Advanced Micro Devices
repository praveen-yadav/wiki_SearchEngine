'''Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.''' is an [[United States|American]] multinational [[semiconductor industry|semiconductor]] company based in [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], [[California]], [[United States]], that develops [[Central processing unit|computer processors]] and related technologies for commercial and consumer markets. While initially it manufactured its own processors, the company became [[Fabless manufacturing|fabless]] after [[GlobalFoundries]] was spun off in 2009. AMD's main products include [[microprocessor]]s, [[motherboard]] [[chipset]]s, [[embedded processor]]s and [[Graphics processing unit|graphics processors]] for [[server (computing)|server]]s, [[workstation]]s and personal computers, and [[embedded systems]] applications.

AMD is the second-largest global supplier of microprocessors based on the [[x86 architecture]] and also one of the largest suppliers of graphics processing units. It also owns 8.6% of [[Spansion]], a supplier of non-volatile [[flash memory]].<ref name="AMD 10k sec filing">{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/sec-filings/100219/ADVANCED-MICRO-DEVICES-INC_10-K/ | title=2010 AMD 10k sec filing |publisher=AMD|date=February 19, 2010}}</ref>

AMD is the only significant rival to [[Intel]] in the central processor (CPU) market for (x86 based) personal computers. Since acquiring [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] in 2006, AMD and its competitor [[Nvidia]] have dominated the discrete graphics processor unit (GPU) market.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lilly|first=Paul|title=Nvidia Leads in Discrete Desktop GPU Market Share, AMD in Notebook Graphics|url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/nvidia_leads_discrete_desktop_gpu_market_share_amd_notebook_graphics|work=Maximum PC|accessdate=February 18, 2012|date=May 6, 2011}}</ref>

Advanced Micro Devices was founded on May 1, 1969,<ref>{{cite book|last=Rodengen|first=Jeffrey L.|title=The spirit of AMD, Advanced Micro Devices|year=1998|publisher=Write Stuff Engerprises|location=Fort Lauderdale, FL|isbn=978-0-945903-21-5|page=30}}</ref> by a group of former executives from [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], including [[Jerry Sanders (businessman)|Jerry Sanders III]], [[Edwin Turney|Ed Turney]], John Carey, Sven Simonsen, [[Jack Gifford (Businessman)|Jack Gifford]] and three members from Gifford's team, Frank Botte, Jim Giles, and Larry Stenger. The company began as a producer of logic chips, then entered the [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] chip business in 1975. That same year, it introduced a [[reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] clone of the [[Intel 8080]] [[microprocessor]]. During this period, AMD also designed and produced a series of [[bit-slice]] processor elements ([[Am2900]], Am29116, Am293xx) which were used in various minicomputer designs.

During this time, AMD attempted to embrace the perceived shift towards [[RISC]] with their own [[AMD Am29000]] (29k) processor, and also attempted to diversify into graphics and audio devices as well as [[EPROM]] memory. It had some success in the mid-1980s with the AMD7910 and AMD7911 "World Chip" [[frequency-shift keying|FSK]] modem, one of the first multistandard devices that covered both Bell and [[ITU-T|CCITT]] tones at up to 1200 baud half duplex or 300/300 full duplex. The 29k survived as an [[embedded processor]] and AMD spinoff Spansion continues to make [[flash memory]]. AMD decided to switch gears and concentrate solely on Intel-compatible microprocessors and flash memory, placing them in direct competition with Intel for x86-compatible processors and their flash memory secondary markets.

AMD announced the acquisition of [[ATI Technologies]] on July 24, 2006. AMD paid $4.3&nbsp;billion in cash and 58&nbsp;million shares of its [[stock]], for a total of US$5.4&nbsp;billion. The transaction completed on October 25, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/October2006/25/c4187.html |title=AMD Completes ATI Acquisition and Creates Processing Powerhouse |publisher=NewsWire |date=October 25, 2006}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> Since 2010, all of the company's graphics processing products have been marketed under the AMD brand name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/358774/ati_re-branded_amd/ |title=ATI to be re-branded as AMD – branding, ATI Radeon, ati, amd – ARN |publisher=Arnnet.com.au |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}</ref>

It was reported in December 2006 that AMD, along with its main rival in the graphics industry [[Nvidia]], received subpoenas from the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] regarding possible [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] violations in the graphics card industry, including the act of fixing prices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9584_22-6140041.html |title=Justice Dept. subpoenas AMD, NVIDIA|work=New York Times |date=December 1, 2006}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

In October 2008, AMD announced plans to spin off manufacturing operations in the form of a multibillion-dollar joint venture with [[Advanced Technology Investment Company|Advanced Technology Investment Co.]], an investment company formed by the government of [[Abu Dhabi]]. The new venture is called [[GlobalFoundries|GlobalFoundries Inc.]].  This partnership will allow AMD to focus solely on chip design.<ref>{{cite news

===IBM PC and the x86 architecture===
{{Main|Am286|Am386|Am486|Am5x86}}

In February 1982, AMD signed a contract with [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], becoming a licensed second-source manufacturer of [[Intel 8086|8086]] and [[Intel 8088|8088]] processors. [[IBM]] wanted to use the Intel 8088 in its [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], but IBM's policy at the time was to require at least two sources for its chips. AMD later produced the [[Am286]] under the same arrangement, but Intel canceled the agreement in 1986 and refused to convey technical details of the [[Intel 80386|i386]] part. AMD challenged Intel's decision to cancel the agreement and won in arbitration, but Intel disputed this decision. A long legal dispute followed, ending in 1994 when the [[Supreme Court of California]] sided with AMD. Subsequent legal disputes centered on whether AMD had legal rights to use derivatives of Intel's [[microcode]]. In the face of uncertainty, AMD was forced to develop [[clean room design]]ed versions of Intel code.

In 1991, AMD released the [[Am386]], its clone of the Intel 386 processor. It took less than a year for the company to sell a million units. Later, the [[Am486]] was used by a number of large [[original equipment manufacturer]]s, including [[Compaq]], and proved popular. Another Am486-based product, the [[Am5x86]], continued AMD's success as a low-price alternative. However, as product cycles shortened in the PC industry, the process of reverse engineering Intel's products became an ever less viable strategy for AMD.

===K5, K6, Athlon, Duron, and Sempron===
{{Main|AMD K5|AMD K6|Athlon|Duron|Sempron}}

AMD's first in-house x86 processor was the [[AMD K5|K5]], which was launched in 1996.<ref name="CPU-INFO K5">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpu-info.com/index2.php?mainid=html/cpu/amdk5.php |title=AMD K5 |accessdate=July 11, 2007 |publisher=CPU-INFO.COM | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070818021000/http://www.cpu-info.com/index2.php?mainid=html/cpu/amdk5.php| archivedate= August 18, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The "K" was a reference to [[Kryptonite]]. (In comic books, the only substance which could harm [[Superman]] was Kryptonite, which was formed from radioactive pieces of his home planet, [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. This is a reference to Intel's hegemony over the market, i.e., an anthropomorphization of them as Superman.<ref name="Forbes-Chip-Names">{{cite news | first=Arik | last=Hesseldahl | coauthors= | title=Why Cool Chip Code Names Die | date=July 6, 2000 |work=Forbes Inc | url =http://www.forbes.com/2000/07/06/mu2.html | pages = | accessdate = July 14, 2007 | language = }}</ref>) The numeral "5" refers to the fifth processor generation, which Intel introduced as Pentium, because the US Trademark and Patent Office ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked.

In 1996, AMD purchased [[NexGen]], specifically for the rights to their Nx series of x86-compatible processors. AMD gave the NexGen design team their own building, left them alone, and gave them time and money to rework the Nx686. The result was the [[AMD K6|K6]] processor, introduced in 1997. Although the K6 was based on [[Socket 7]], variants such as K6-3/450 were faster than Intel's Pentium II (sixth generation processor).

The K7 was AMD's seventh-generation x86 processor, making its debut on June 23, 1999, under the brand name Athlon. Unlike previous AMD processors, it could not be used on the same motherboards as Intel's, due to licensing issues surrounding Intel's [[Slot 1]] connector, and instead used a [[Slot A]] connector, referenced to the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] processor bus.  The [[Duron]] was a lower-cost and limited version of the Athlon (64KB instead of 256KB L2 cache) in a 462-pin socketed PGA (socket A) or soldered directly onto the motherboard. [[Sempron]] was released as a lower-cost Athlon XP, replacing Duron in the [[socket A]] PGA era. It has since been migrated upward to all new sockets, up to [[AM3]].

On October 9, 2001, the Athlon XP was released. On February 10, 2003, the Athlon XP with 512KB L2 Cache was released.<ref name="The AMD Athlon XP Processor with 512KB L2 Cache">{{cite news | first=Jack | last=Huynh | coauthors= | title=The AMD Athlon XP Processor with 512KB L2 Cache | date=February 10, 2003 | publisher=AMD | url =http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/white_papers_and_tech_docs/26485A_AthlXPwp_2-20.pdf |format=PDF| work=amd.com | pages = | accessdate = October 2, 2007 | language = | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071026182602/http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/white_papers_and_tech_docs/26485A_AthlXPwp_2-20.pdf| archivedate= October 26, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The K8 was a major revision of the K7 architecture, with the most notable features being the addition of a [[64-bit]] extension to the x86 instruction set (called [[x86-64]], AMD64, or x64), the incorporation of an on-chip memory controller, and the implementation of an extremely high performance point-to-point interconnect called [[HyperTransport]], as part of the [[Direct Connect Architecture]]. The technology was initially launched as the [[Opteron]] server-oriented processor on April 22, 2003.<ref>Scott Wasson. "[http://www.techreport.com/reviews/2003q3/workstation/index.x?pg=1 Workstation platforms compared]", ''techreport.com'', The Tech Report, LLC., 2003-09-15, Retrieved on July 29, 2007.</ref> Shortly thereafter it was incorporated into a product for desktop PCs, branded [[Athlon 64]].<ref>Scott Wasson.

On April 21, 2005, AMD released the first [[dual core]] [[Opteron]], an x86-based server CPU.<ref>Scott Wasson. "[http://www.techreport.com/reviews/2005q2/opteron-x75/index.x?pg=1 AMD's dual-core Opteron processors]", ''techreport.com'', The Tech Report, LLC., April 21, 2005.

Retrieved on July 29, 2007.</ref> In early May 2007, AMD had abandoned the string "64" in its dual-core desktop product branding, becoming Athlon X2, downplaying the significance of [[x86-64|64-bit computing]] in its processors. Upcoming updates involved some of the improvements to the microarchitecture, and a shift of target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dual-core desktop systems. In 2008, AMD started to release dual-core Sempron processors exclusively in China, branded as the Sempron 2000 series, with lower HyperTransport speed and smaller L2 cache. Thus AMD completed its dual-core product portfolio for each market segment.

After K8 came [[AMD K10|K10]]. On September 10, 2007, AMD released the first K10 processors: nine quad-core Third Generation Opteron processors. This was followed by the [[Phenom (processor)|Phenom]] processor for desktop. K10 processors came in dual-core, [[Multi-core|triple-core]],<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_543~120741,00.html AMD announcement]. Retrieved September 17, 2007.</ref> and [[Multi-core|quad-core]] versions, with all cores on a single die. AMD released a new platform, codenamed "[[AMD Spider|Spider]]", which utilized the new Phenom processor, as well as an R770 GPU and a 790 GX/FX chipset from the [[AMD 700 chipset series]]. However, AMD built the Spider at [[65nm]], which was uncompetitive with Intel's smaller and more power-efficient [[45nm]].

In January 2009, AMD released a new processor line dubbed [[Phenom II]], a refresh of the original [[AMD Phenom|Phenom]] built using the 45&nbsp;nm process. AMD's new platform, codenamed “[[AMD Dragon|Dragon]]”, utilised the new Phenom II processor, and an [[ATI (brand)|ATI]] R770 GPU from the [[Radeon R700|R700]] GPU family, as well as a 790 GX/FX chipset from the [[AMD 700 chipset series]]. The Phenom II came in dual-core, triple-core and quad-core variants, all using the same die, with cores disabled for the triple-core and dual-core versions. The Phenom II resolved issues that the original Phenom had, including low clock speed, a small L3 cache and a [[Cool'n'Quiet]] bug that decreased performance. The Phenom II cost less but was not performance-competitive with Intel's mid-to-high-range [[Core 2]] Quads. The Phenom II also enhanced the Phenom's memory controller, allowing it to use [[DDR3]] in a new native socket [[AM3]], while maintaining backwards compatibility with [[AM2+]], the socket used for the Phenom, and allowing the use of the [[DDR2 SDRAM|DDR2]] memory that was used with the platform.

In April 2010, AMD released a new Phenom II hexa-core (6-core) processor codenamed "Thuban". This was a totally new die based on the hexa-core “Istanbul” [[Opteron]] processor. It included AMD's “turbo core” technology, which allows the processor to automatically switch from 6 cores to 3 faster cores when more pure speed is needed. AMD's Enthusiast platform, codenamed “[[AMD Leo|Leo]]”, utilized the new Phenom II, a new chipset from the [[AMD 800 chipset series]] and an [[ATI (brand)|ATI]] “Cypress” GPU from the [[Evergreen (GPU family)]] GPU series.

The Magny Cours and Lisbon server parts were released in 2010.{{update after|2010|12|31}} The Magny Cours part came in 8 to 12 cores and the Lisbon part came in 4 and 6 core parts. Magny Cours is focused on performance while the Lisbon part is focused on high performance per watt. Magny Cours is an MCM ([[Multi-Chip Module]]) with two hexa-core “Istanbul” [[Opteron]] parts. This will use a new G34 socket for dual and quad socket processors and thus will be marketed as Opteron 61xx series processors. Lisbon uses C32 socket certified for dual socket use or single socket use only and thus will be marketed as Opteron 41xx processors. Both will be built on a 45&nbsp;nm SOI process.

===Fusion, Bobcat, Bulldozer, Vishera, and Hondo===
{{Main|AMD Accelerated Processing Unit|AMD mobile platform|Bulldozer (processor)|Bobcat (processor)}}
After the merger between AMD and ATI, an initiative codenamed ''[[AMD Fusion|Fusion]]'' was announced that will merge a [[CPU]] and [[GPU]] on some of their mainstream chips, including a minimum 16 lane [[PCI Express]] link to accommodate external PCI Express peripherals, thereby eliminating the requirement of a [[Northbridge (computing)|northbridge]] chip completely from the motherboard. The initiative will see some of the processing originally done on the CPU (e.g. [[floating-point unit]] operations) moved to the GPU, which is better optimized for calculations such as floating-point unit calculations. This is referred to by AMD as an [[accelerated processing unit]] (APU).<ref name="APU">{{cite web| url=http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/02/amd-reveals-fusion-cpugpu-to-challege-intel-in-laptops.ars| title=AMD reveals Fusion CPU+GPU, to challege Intel in laptops| first=Jon| last=Stokes| publisher=Ars Technica| date=February 8, 2010| accessdate=February 9, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210011231/http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/02/amd-reveals-fusion-cpugpu-to-challege-intel-in-laptops.ars| archivedate= February 10, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

This will, however, not be based on the new bulldozer core and will in fact be similar to the current [[Phenom II]] "Deneb" processor serving as AMD's high-end processor until the release of the new 32&nbsp;nm parts. On September 28, 2011, AMD said that the third quarter of 2011 won't have a 10% revenue increase as AMD planned before, because of the manufacturing problem with the 32&nbsp;nm Llano Fusion chips.<ref>Jeffrey Burt, eWeek.

'''Bulldozer''' is AMD's CPU codename for the second latest server and desktop processors released on October 12, 2011. This [[List of AMD CPU microarchitectures#x86 microarchitectures|family 15h microarchitecture]] is the successor to the [[AMD 10h|family 10h (K10)]] microarchitecture ''M-SPACE'' design methodology.

Bulldozer is designed from scratch, not a development of earlier processors.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.techpowerup.com/138328/Bulldozer-50-Faster-than-Core-i7-and-Phenom-II.html |title=Bulldozer 50% Faster than Core i7 and Phenom II |publisher=techPowerUp |date= |accessdate=2012-01-23}}</ref> The core is specifically aimed at 10-125 [[watt]] [[Thermal Design Power|TDP]] computing products. AMD claims dramatic performance-per-watt efficiency improvements in [[high-performance computing]] (HPC) applications with Bulldozer cores.

'''Vishera''' is an AMD former processor series

'''Llano''' was AMD's first APU built for [[laptop]]s

'''''Jaguar''''' is the latest [[x86]] processor core from AMD aimed at low-power/low-cost market.

Jaguar's predecessor, Bobcat, was revealed during a speech from AMD executive vice-president Henri Richard in [[Computex]] 2007 and was put into production Q1 2011.<ref name="Hruska"/> One of the major supporters was executive vice-president [[Mario A. Rivas]] who felt it was difficult to compete in the x86 market with a single core optimized for the 10-100&nbsp;Watts range and actively promoted the development of the simpler core with a target range of 1-10&nbsp;Watts. In addition, it was believed that the core could migrate into the hand-held space if the power consumption can be reduced to less than 1&nbsp;W.

===ARM architecture-based chip===
AMD intends to release [[ARM architecture|ARM]] System on Chips (SoC) that will begin sampling in early 2014 and release later in the year.  They will be for use in servers as a low-power alternative to current x86 chips.  The ARM architecture is codenamed "Seattle" and will be 64 bit ARM processors, based on the Cortex A57 core design (ARM v8), and will contain 8 and 16 cores each.  They will include the proprietary SeaMicro "Freedom Fabric", as well as support for 128 GB RAM, and ten gigabit Ethernet.<ref name=cunningham2013>{{Citation

==Products and technologies==

===Graphics products===
{{See also|Comparison of AMD graphics processing units|Free and open-source device drivers: graphics#ATI/AMD|l2=Graphics hardware and FOSS|Comparison of ATI chipsets}}

AMD's portfolio of dedicated [[graphics processor]]s includes product families and associated technologies aimed at the consumer, professional and [[high-performance computing]] markets.

*'''[[Radeon]]''' is AMD's line of consumer 3D accelerator add-in cards. '''[[Radeon|Mobility Radeon]]''' is a series of power-optimized versions of Radeon graphics chips for use in laptops.  They introduced innovations such as modularized RAM chips, [[DVD]] (MPEG2) acceleration, notebook GPU card sockets, and power management technology. AMD recently announced DirectX 11.1-compatible versions of its mobile processors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.techworld.com/mobile-wireless/3209713/amd-launches-directx-11-graphics-chips-for-laptops/|title=AMD launches DirectX 11 graphics chips for laptops|date=January 8, 2010| publisher=techworld.com|accessdate=2010-01-08}}</ref>
*'''FirePro''' is AMD's line of professional graphics processors for [[workstation]]s. Based on the Radeon series, it succeeds the FireGL series of workstation CAD/CAM video cards, and the FireMV series for workstations with 2D acceleration.
*'''[[AMD FireStream|FireStream]]''' is a [[stream processing|stream processor]] designed to utilize the stream processing/[[GPGPU]] (General Purpose Graphics Processing Units) concept for heavy [[Floating point|floating-point]] computations to target various industries, such as the [[High-performance computing|High Performance Computing]] (HPC), scientific, and financial sectors. The AMD FireStream can also be used as a floating-point [[co-processor]] for offloading CPU calculations, which is part of the [[Torrenza]] initiative.
* '''EyeFinity''' – Allows up to 6 monitors to be connected to one card to allow surround-screen panoramic view.
* '''EyeSpeed''' – Allows to experience games with true-to-life actions-and reactions. Features such as physics effects, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and more.

[[AMD Catalyst]] is a collection of proprietary [[device driver]]s software available for most platforms, including [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], and [[Linux]]. Linux users can also opt to use open-source drivers, whose development is assisted by AMD. Hardware component companies which only provide proprietary drivers have always been urged by the [[free-software community]] to make their drivers [[free software]], or at least provide the necessary documentation for the community to write their own drivers.

Since 2007, the AMD has partly cooperated with the development of free graphics drivers, but have not made their Catalyst drivers free. The programming specifications for a number of chipsets and features were published in several rounds. This greatly changed their support of the development of free graphics drivers, as until that moment only unsupported free drivers existed. Besides releasing the specifications, AMD also funded the development of new "open source" drivers, and has even hired some employees to actively work on free software drivers.<ref name="ubuntugamer">[http://www.ubuntugamer.com/2011/01/ubuntu-graphics-driver-overview/# An overview of graphic card manufacturers and how well they work with Ubuntu] Ubuntu Gamer, January 10, 2011 (Article by Luke Benstead)</ref>{{Dead link|date=December 2011}}

=== AMD chipsets ===
{{See also|Comparison of AMD chipsets}}
Before the launch of [[Athlon 64]] processors in 2003, AMD designed [[chipset]]s for their processors spanning the [[AMD K6|K6]] and [[AMD K7|K7]] processor generations. The chipsets include the AMD-640, AMD-751 and the AMD-761 chipsets. The situation changed in 2003 with the release of [[Athlon 64]] processors, and AMD chose not to further design its own chipsets for its desktop processors while opening the desktop platform to allow other firms to design chipsets. This was the “[[Open Platform Management Architecture]]” with [[ATI Technologies|ATI]], [[VIA Technologies|VIA]] and [[Silicon Integrated Systems|SiS]] developing their own chipset for [[Athlon 64]] processors and later [[Athlon 64 X2]] and [[Athlon 64 FX]] processors, including the [[AMD Quad FX platform|Quad FX platform]] chipset from Nvidia.

The initiative went further with the release of [[Opteron]] server processors as AMD stopped the design of server chipsets in 2004 after releasing the AMD-8111 chipset, and again opened the server platform for firms to develop chipsets for Opteron processors. As of today, [[Nvidia]] and [[Broadcom]] are the sole designing firms of server chipsets for Opteron processors.

As the company completed the acquisition of ATI Technologies in 2006, the firm gained the ATI design team for chipsets which previously designed the [[Xpress 200|Radeon Xpress 200]] and the [[Xpress 3200|Radeon Xpress 3200]] chipsets. AMD then renamed the chipsets for AMD processors under AMD branding (for instance, the CrossFire Xpress 3200 chipset was renamed as [[AMD 580 chipset series|AMD 580X CrossFire chipset]]). In February 2007, AMD announced the first AMD-branded chipset since 2004 with the release of the AMD [[AMD 690 chipset series|690G]] chipset (previously under the development codename ''RS690''), targeted at mainstream [[Integrated Graphics Processor|IGP]] computing. It was the industry's first to implement a [[HDMI]] 1.2 port on motherboards, shipping for more than a million units. While ATI had aimed at releasing an Intel IGP chipset, the plan was scrapped and the inventories of [[AMD 690 chipset series#Radeon Xpress 1250|Radeon Xpress 1250]] (codenamed ''RS600'', sold under ATI brand) was sold to two OEMs, Abit and ASRock. Although AMD states the firm will still produce Intel chipsets, Intel had not granted the license of {{nowrap|1333 MHz}} FSB to ATI.

On November 15, 2007, AMD announced a new chipset series portfolio, the [[AMD 700 chipset series|AMD 7-Series chipsets]], covering from enthusiast multi-graphics segment to value IGP segment, to replace the [[AMD 580 chipset series|AMD 480/570/580 chipsets]] and [[AMD 690 chipset series|AMD 690 series chipsets]], marking AMD's first enthusiast multi-graphics chipset.  Discrete graphics chipsets were launched on November 15, 2007 as part of the codenamed ''Spider'' desktop platform, and IGP chipsets were launched at a later time in Spring 2008 as part of the codenamed ''Cartwheel'' platform.

AMD returned to the server chipsets market with the [[AMD 800 chipset series|AMD 800S series server chipsets]]. It includes support for up to six [[Serial ATA#SATA Revision 3.0 (SATA 6Gb/s)|SATA 6.0 Gbit/s]] ports, the C6 power state, which is featured in [[AMD Fusion|Fusion]] processors and [[Advanced Host Controller Interface|AHCI]] 1.2 with SATA [[port multiplier#FIS(Frame Information Structure)–based switching|FIS–based switching]] support. This is a chipset family supporting [[Phenom (processor)|Phenom]] processors and [[AMD Quad FX platform|Quad FX enthusiast platform]] (890FX), [[Integrated Graphics Processor|IGP]](890GX).

AMD's [[x86 virtualization]] extension to the 64-bit x86 architecture is named ''AMD Virtualization'', also known by the abbreviation ''[[AMD-V]]'', and is sometimes referred to by the code name "Pacifica". AMD processors using [[Socket AM2]], [[Socket S1]], and [[Socket F]] include AMD Virtualization support. AMD Virtualization is also supported by release two (8200, 2200 and 1200 series) of the Opteron processors. The third generation (8300 and 2300 series) of [[Opteron]] processors will see an update in virtualization technology, specifically the Rapid Virtualization Indexing (also known by the development name ''Nested Page Tables''), alongside the Tagged [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] and Device Exclusion Vector (DEV).

AMD also promotes the "AMD I/O Virtualization Technology" (also known as [[IOMMU]]) for I/O virtualization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_543~117440,00.html|title=AMD press release}}</ref> The AMD IOMMU specification has been updated to version 1.2.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/white_papers_and_tech_docs/34434.pdf | title=AMD IOMMU specification 1.2 | format=PDF}}</ref> The specification describes the use of a [[HyperTransport]] architecture.

AMD's commercial initiatives include the following:
* AMD Trinity, provides support for virtualization, security and management.

* [[Torrenza]], [[coprocessor]]s support through interconnects such as [[HyperTransport]], and [[PCI Express]] (though more focus was at [[HyperTransport]] enabled coprocessors), also opening processor socket architecture to other manufacturers, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] and [[IBM]] are among the supporting consortium, with rumoured [[POWER7]] processors would be socket-compatible to future Opteron processors. The move made rival [[Intel]] respond with the opening of [[Front Side Bus]] (FSB) architecture as well as [[PCI Express|Geneseo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20060927comp_a.htm|title=Intel Geneseo press release}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> a collaboration project with [[IBM]] for coprocessors connected through [[PCI Express]].
* Various certified systems programs and platforms: AMD Commercial [[Stable Image Platform]] (CSIP), together with AMD Validated Server program, AMD True Server Solutions, AMD Thermally Tested Barebones Platforms and AMD Validated Server Program, providing certified systems for business from AMD.

===Desktop platforms===
Starting in 2007, AMD, following Intel, began using [[codename]]s for its desktop platforms such as ''[[AMD Spider|Spider]]'' or ''[[AMD Dragon|Dragon]]''. The platforms, unlike Intel's approach, will refresh every year, putting focus on platform specialization. The platform includes components as AMD processors, chipsets, ATI graphics and other features, but continued to the open platform approach, and welcome components from other vendors such as VIA, SiS, and Nvidia, as well as wireless product vendors.

Updates to the platform includes the implementation of [[IOMMU]] [[AMD Virtualization|I/O Virtualization]] with [[45 nm]] generation of processors, and the [[AMD 800 chipset series]] in 2009.<ref>[http://download.amd.com/Corporate/MarioRivasDec2007AMDAnalystDay.pdf AMD Financial Analyst Day 2007 presentation]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}, presented by Mario Rivas, page 24 of 28.

===Embedded systems===
{{Main|Alchemy (processor)|Geode (processor)}}

In February 2002, AMD acquired Alchemy Semiconductor for its [[Alchemy (processor)|Alchemy]] line of [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] processors for the hand-held and [[portable media player]] markets. On June 13, 2006, AMD officially announced that the line was to be transferred to Raza Microelectronics, Inc., a designer of MIPS processors for embedded applications.<ref name='Alchemy'>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=AMD Alchemy processor product line acquired by Raza Microelectronics | date=June 14, 2006 | publisher=technologynewsdaily.com | url =http://www.technologynewsdaily.com/node/3336 | work=TechNews | pages = | accessdate = July 11, 2007 | language = }}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

In August 2003, AMD also purchased the [[Geode (processor)|Geode]] business which was originally the [[Cyrix]] [[MediaGX]] from [[National Semiconductor]] to augment its existing line of embedded x86 processor products. During the second quarter of 2004, it launched new low-power Geode NX processors based on the K7 Thoroughbred architecture with speeds of fanless processors {{nowrap|667 MHz}} and {{nowrap|1 GHz}}, and {{nowrap|1.4 GHz}} processor with fan, of [[Thermal Design Power|TDP]] 25 [[Watt|W]]. This technology is used in a variety of embedded systems (Casino slot machines and customer kiosks for instance), several [[Ultra Mobile PC|UMPC]] designs in Asia markets, as well as the [[One Laptop per Child|OLPC]] [[OLPC XO-1|XO-1 computer]], an inexpensive laptop computer intended to be distributed to children in developing countries around the world.  The Geode LX processor was announced in 2005 and is said will continue to be available through 2015.

For the past couple of years AMD has been introducing [[x86-64|64-bit]] processors into its embedded product line starting with the AMD [[Opteron]] processor.  Leveraging the high throughput enabled through [[HyperTransport]] and the [[Direct Connect Architecture]] these server class processors have been targeted at high end telecom and storage applications. In 2007 AMD added the AMD Athlon, AMD Turion and Mobile AMD Sempron processors to its embedded product line. Leveraging the same [[x86-64|64-bit]] instruction set and [[Direct Connect Architecture]] as the AMD [[Opteron]] but at lower power levels, these processors were well suited to a variety of traditional embedded applications. Throughout 2007 and into 2008 AMD has continued to add both single-core Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors and [[Multi-core (computing)|dual-core]] AMD Athlon X2 and AMD Turion processors to its embedded product line and now offers embedded [[x86-64|64-bit]] solutions starting with 8W TDP Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors for fan-less designs up to multi-processor systems leveraging multi-core AMD Opteron processors all supporting longer than standard availability.<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us/products/embedded/Pages/embedded.aspx AMD Embedded Solutions that are scalable, x86- based, low-power and feature-rich products]. Amd.com (November 5, 2010). Retrieved on 2010-11-09.</ref>

The ATI acquisition included the [[Imageon]] and [[Xilleon]] product lines. In late 2008, the entire handheld division was sold off to [[Qualcomm]], who have since produced the [[Adreno]] series. The Xilleon division was sold to [[Broadcom]].

In April 2007, AMD announced the release of the [[AMD 690 chipset series#M690T|M690T]] integrated graphics chipset for embedded designs. This enabled AMD to offer complete processor and chipset solutions targeted at embedded applications requiring high performance 3D and video such as emerging digital signage, kiosk and Point of Sale applications. The M690T was followed by the [[AMD 690 chipset series#M690E|M690E]] specifically for embedded applications which removed the TV output, which required [[Macrovision]] licensing for OEMs, and enabled native support for dual [[Transition Minimized Differential Signaling|TMDS]] outputs, enabling dual independent [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] interfaces.

In 2008, AMD announced the Radeon E2400, the first discrete GPU in their embedded product line offering the same long term availability as their other embedded products. That was followed in 2009 with the higher performance Redeon E4690 discrete GPU.

In 2009, AMD announced their first BGA packaged e64 architecture processors, known as the ASB1 family.

In 2010, AMD announced a second generation BGA platform referred to as ASB2. They also announced several new AM3 based processors with support for DDR3 memory.

In January 2011, AMD Announced the AMD Embedded G-Series [[AMD Accelerated Processing Unit|Accelerated Processing Unit]].  The first Fusion family APU for embedded applications. This announcement was followed by announcements for the high performance AMD Radeon E6760 and the value-conscious Radeon E6460 discrete GPUs.  These solutions all added support for [[DirectX 11]], [[OpenGL]] 4.1 and [[OpenCL]] 1.1.

In May 2012, AMD Announced the AMD Embedded R-Series <ref name='R-Series'>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=AMD Embedded R-Series Platform | date=July 10, 2012 | publisher=amd.com | url =http://www.amd.com/us/products/embedded/processors/Pages/r-series.aspx | work=AMD | pages = | accessdate = July 10, 2012 | language = }}</ref> [[AMD Accelerated Processing Unit|Accelerated Processing Unit]].

One of the initiatives being discussed since August 2007 is the Light Weight [[Profiling (computer programming)|Profiling]] (LWP), providing internal hardware monitor with runtimes, to observe information about executing process and help the re-design of software to be optimized with multi-core and even multi-threaded programs. Another one is the extension of Streaming SIMD Extension (SSE) instruction set, the [[SSE5]].

==Production and fabrication==
{{Main|GlobalFoundries}}

Ever since the spin-off of AMD's fabrication plants in early 2009, [[GlobalFoundries]] has been responsible for producing AMD's processors.

[[GlobalFoundries]]' main microprocessor manufacturing facilities are located in [[Dresden]], Germany. Additionally, highly integrated microprocessors are manufactured in Taiwan made by third-party manufacturers under strict license from AMD. Between 2003 and 2005, they constructed a second manufacturing plant ({{nowrap|300 mm}} [[90 nm]] process [[silicon on insulator|SOI]]) in the same complex in order to increase the number of chips they could produce, thus becoming more competitive with [[Intel]]. The new plant was named "Fab 36", in recognition of AMD's 36 years of operation, and reached full production in mid-2007. Fab 36 was renamed to "Fab 1" during the spin-off of AMD's manufacturing business during the creation of [[GlobalFoundries]]. In July 2007, AMD announced that they completed the conversion of Fab 1 Module 1 from {{nowrap|90 nm}} to [[65 nm]].  They then shifted their focus to the [[45 nm]] conversion.<ref>Rick C. Hodgin. While AMD was in the progression to 45 nm, its rival Intel Corp was one year ahead in manufacturing technology and releasing its 32 nm technology (Intel "tick-tock" advancement roadmap) "[http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/33105/135/1/3/ Wrap-up: AMD outlines a bright future at Technology Analyst Day]", ''tgdaily.com'', Tigervision Media, 2007-07-26, pp.4.

==Corporate affairs==

=== Partnerships ===
AMD utilizes strategic industry partnerships to further its business interests as well as to tackle Intel's dominance and resources.

A partnership between AMD and Alpha Processor Inc. developed [[HyperTransport]], a point-to-point interconnect standard which was turned over to an industry standards body for finalization. It is now used in modern motherboards that are compatible with AMD processors.

AMD also formed a strategic partnership with IBM, under which AMD gained [[silicon on insulator]] (SOI) manufacturing technology, and detailed advice on [[90 nm]] implementation. AMD announced that the partnership would extend to 2011 for [[32 nm]] and [[22 nm]] fabrication-related technologies.<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/DarylOstranderAMDAnalystDay.pdf AMD Analyst Day June 2006 Presentation], slide 10</ref>{{dead link|date=March 2012}}

To facilitate processor distribution and sales, AMD is loosely partnered with end-user companies, such as [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Compaq]], [[ASUS]], [[Acer (company)|Acer]], and [[Dell]].

In 1993, AMD established a 50-50 partnership with [[Fujitsu]] called FASL, and merged into a new company called FASL LLC in 2003. The joint venture went public under the name [[Spansion]] and ticker symbol SPSN in December 2005, with AMD shares drop to 37%. AMD no longer directly participates in the Flash memory devices market now as AMD entered into a non-competition agreement, as of December 21, 2005, with Fujitsu and Spansion, pursuant to which it agreed not to directly or indirectly engage in a business that manufactures or supplies standalone semiconductor devices (including single chip, multiple chip or system devices) containing only Flash memory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.shareholder.com/s/viewerContent.aspx?companyid=SPSN&docid=4095716|title=Press release}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

On May 18, 2006, Dell announced that it would roll out new servers based on AMD's Opteron chips by year's end, thus ending an exclusive relationship with Intel. In September 2006, Dell began offering AMD Athlon X2 chips in their desktop line-up.

Since 2002, AMD has been a sponsor of the [[Scuderia Ferrari]] Marlboro F1 Team. Since 2004, AMD has been a sponsor of the [[Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team]]. In 2009, AMD became the jersey sponsor of the [[United Soccer Leagues|USL]] expansion team [[Austin Aztex FC]].

In June 2011,  HP announced new business and consumer notebooks equipped with the latest versions of AMD APUs{{spaced ndash}}accelerated processing units.

===Litigation with Intel===
{{See also|AMD v. Intel}}
AMD has a long history of litigation with former partner and x86 creator [[Intel Corporation|Intel]].<ref name=litigation>{{cite web |url=http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/AMD_-_Intel_Litigation_History.pdf |format=PDF|title=AMD-INTEL LITIGATION HISTORY |publisher=AMD |accessdate=January 12, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070108093846/http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/AMD_-_Intel_Litigation_History.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = January 8, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amd.com/us/Documents/Complaint_summary.pdf|title=Summary U.S. antitrust complaint against Intel|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amd.com/us/Documents/AMD-Intel_Full_Complaint.pdf|title=Full text of U.S. antitrust complaint against Intel|format=PDF}}</ref>
*In 1986 Intel broke an agreement it had with AMD to allow them to produce Intel's micro-chips for [[IBM]]; AMD filed for [[arbitration]] in 1987 and the arbitrator decided in AMD's favor in 1992. Intel disputed this, and the case ended up in the [[Supreme Court of California]]. In 1994, that court upheld the arbitrator's decision and awarded damages for breach of contract.
*In 1990, Intel brought a copyright infringement action alleging illegal use of its 287 microcode. The case ended in 1994 with a jury finding for AMD and its right to use Intel's microcode in its microprocessors through the 486 generation.
*In 1997, Intel filed suit against AMD and [[Cyrix]] Corp. for misuse of the term [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]]. AMD and Intel settled, with AMD acknowledging MMX as a trademark owned by Intel, and with Intel granting AMD rights to market the AMD K6 MMX processor.
*In 2005, following an investigation, the Japan Federal Trade Commission found Intel guilty on a number of violations. On June 27, 2005, AMD won an [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] suit against Intel in Japan, and on the same day, AMD filed a broad antitrust complaint against Intel in the U.S. Federal District Court in [[Delaware]]. The complaint alleges systematic use of secret rebates, special discounts, threats, and other means used by Intel to lock AMD processors out of the global market. Since the start of this action, the court has issued [[subpoena]]s to major computer manufacturers including [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Dell]], [[Lenovo]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and [[Toshiba]].
*In November 2009, Intel agreed to pay AMD $1.25bn and renew a five-year patent cross-licensing agreement as part of a deal to settle all outstanding legal disputes between them.<ref name="amd suit">"[http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/technology/amd-intel-settle-legal-disputes/ Intel, AMD Settle Legal Disputes]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}"</ref>

===Events and publications===
Although AMD frequently refuses to provide information about upcoming products and plans, it does hold annual Analyst Days  to reveal and explain key future technologies, and to present official [[technology roadmap]]s. The event held in mid-year is referred to as "Technology Analyst Day", with its main focus on upcoming technologies and trends. The end-of-year event is referred to as "Financial Analyst Day" and focuses on the financial performance of the company through the previous year.<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/InvestorRelations/0,,51_306_15401,00.html?redir=IRAD01 AMD Financial Analyst Day 2007 page]. Retrieved December 14, 2007.</ref>

In addition to these events, AMD also publishes [[printed media]]. Publications include the AMD Accelerate and the discontinued AMDEdge. The AMD Accelerate magazine, originally published through [[Ziff Davis|Ziff Davis Media]], focuses on [[Small and medium enterprises|SME]] and business applications, while AMD Edge focused on overall technologies from AMD. Since Ziff Davis Media filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the AMD Accelerate magazine has been published through [[International Data Group|IDG]]. AMD also has electronic [[newsletter]]s to promote its server-oriented [[Opteron]] processors and related business solutions.

===Guinness World Record Achievement===
