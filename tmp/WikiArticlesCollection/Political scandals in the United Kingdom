{{Political corruption sidebar}}
'''Political scandals in the United Kingdom''' are commonly referred to by the press and commentators as "''''sleaze'''".

==Sleaze==
A number of [[political scandal]]s in the 1980s and 1990s created the impression of what was described in the [[British press]] as "sleaze": a perception that the then [[British Conservative Party|Conservative]] government was associated with [[political corruption]] and [[hypocrisy]]. This was revived in the late 1990s due to accounts of so-called "sleaze" by the Labour government.

===Conservative Party cash controversies===
In particular, the successful entrapment of [[Graham Riddick]] and [[David Tredinnick (politician)|David Tredinnick]] in the [[Cash-for-questions affair|"cash for questions" scandal]] of 1994,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-cashforquestions-affair-major-rocked-as-payments-scandal-grows-minister-resigns-over-cash-for-questions-pm-reveals-he-knew-of-allegations-by-harrods-owner-three-weeks-ago-1444057.html|title= The Cash-for-Questions Affair: Major rocked as payments scandal grows: Minister resigns over 'cash for questions' PM reveals he knew of allegations by Harrods owner three weeks ago|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref> the contemporaneous misconduct as ministers by [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] (who lost a consequent libel action against ''[[The Guardian]]''), [[Tim Smith]], and the convictions of former Cabinet member [[Jonathan Aitken]] and former party deputy chairman [[Jeffrey Archer]] for [[perjury]] in two separate cases leading to custodial sentences damaged the Conservatives' public reputation. Persistent rumours about the activities of the party treasurer [[Michael Ashcroft]] furthered this impression. At the same time, a series of revelations about the private lives of various Conservative politicians made the headlines.

===Back to Basics===
[[John Major]]'s [[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]] campaign backfired because of media focus on its moral aspects, where they exposed "sleaze" within the Conservative Party and, most damagingly, within the Cabinet itself. A number of ministers were then revealed to have committed sexual indiscretions, and Major was forced by media pressure to dismiss them. In September 2002 it was revealed that, prior to his promotion to the cabinet, Major had himself had a long-standing extramarital affair with a fellow MP, [[Edwina Currie]].

===Sleaze in the Labour Party===
During its term in office from 1997 to 2010, controversies affecting the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Government]] such as [[David Blunkett]]'s affair with [[The Spectator|Spectator]] editor [[Kimberly Fortier]] and financial scandals involving senior ministers and officials shifted the focus to sleaze within the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. There was some perception that sleaze may be endemic in [[Politics of United Kingdom|British Politics]] as a whole.
