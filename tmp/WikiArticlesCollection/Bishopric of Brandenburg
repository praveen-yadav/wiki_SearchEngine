The '''Bishopric of Brandenburg''' was a [[Roman Catholic]] [[diocese]] established by [[Otto the Great]] in 948, including the territory between the [[Elbe]] on the west, the [[Oder]] on the east, and the [[Schwarze Elster]] on the south, and taking in the [[Uckermark]] to the north. Its seat was [[Brandenburg an der Havel|Brandenburg upon Havel]]. It was a state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] for some time, probably starting at 1161/1165, but never managed to gain control over a significant territory, being overshadowed by the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which was originally seated in the same city. Chapter and cathedral, surrounded by further ecclesiastical institutions, were located on Dominsel (cathedral island), which formed a ''prince-episcopal [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]] district'', distinct from the city of Brandenburg. Only in 1929 the - meanwhile former - immunity district was incorporated into the city itself.

==History==
[[Image:Brb dom 19jh.jpg|thumb|left|280px|The ''Cathedral of Ss. Peter and Paul'' in Brandenburg upon Havel, nineteenth century.]] The diocese was originally a [[suffragan]] of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]], but in 968 it came under the archiepiscopal jurisdiction of [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Magdeburg]]. The [[Lutici|Lutician uprising of 983]] practically annihilated it; bishops continued to be named, but they were merely titular, until the downfall of the [[Wends]] in the twelfth century and the [[Ostsiedlung|German eastward settlement]] in the diocesan region revived the bishopric.

Bishop [[Wigers, Bishop of Brandenburg|Wigers]] (1138–60) was the first of a series of bishops of the [[Premonstratensian Order]], which chose the occupants of the [[episcopal see|see]] until 1447; in that year a bull of [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]] gave the right of nomination to the [[elector of Brandenburg]], with whom the bishops stood in a close feudal relation.

[[File:Burg Ziesar 14.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Castle of Ziesar'' (Burg Ziesar), now a museum also showing the history of the Prince-Bishopric of Brandenburg.]] As rulers of [[imperial immediacy]], regnant in a, however, dispersed territory partitioned into the four bailiwicks ({{lang-de|Ämter}}) of Brandenburg/Havel, [[Ketzin]], [[Teltow]] and [[Ziesar]], the prince-bishops resided in their fortress in Ziesar. The last actual bishop was [[Matthias von Jagow]] (d. 1544), who took the side of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], married, and in every way furthered the undertakings of Elector [[Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim II]].

There were two more nominal bishops, but on the petition of the latter of these, the electoral prince [[John George, Elector of Brandenburg|John George]], the secularisation of the bishopric was undertaken and finally accomplished, in spite of legal proceedings to reassert the imperial immediacy of the [[prince-bishopric]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] and so to likewise preserve the diocese, which dragged on into the seventeenth century.
