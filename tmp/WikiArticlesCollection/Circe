[[File:Dosso Dossi, Circe and her Lovers (in a Landscape).jpg|thumb|''Circe and her Lovers in a Landscape'' (1514–16) by [[Dosso Dossi]]]]
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Circe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɜr|s|iː}}; [[Greek language|Greek]] Κίρκη ''Kírkē'' {{IPA-el|kírkɛ͜ɛ|pron}}) was renowned for her vast knowledge of drugs and herbs. Through the use of magical potions and a [[wand]] she [[Shapeshifting|transformed]] her enemies, or those who offended her, into animals. She was a minor [[goddess]] of magic (or sometimes a [[nymph]], [[witch]], [[Magician (paranormal)|enchantress]] or sorceress). Some say she was exiled to the solitary island of [[Aeaea]] by her subjects and her father for ending the life of her husband, the prince of [[Colchis]]. Later traditions tell of her leaving or even destroying the island and moving to Italy. In particular she was identified with [[Cape Circeo]] there.

By most accounts, Circe was the daughter of [[Helios]], the god of the sun, and [[Oceanid|Perse]], an [[Oceanid]]. Her brothers were [[Aeetes]], the keeper of the [[Golden Fleece]], and [[Perses (brother of Aeetes)|Perses]], and her sister was [[Pasiphaë]], the wife of [[Minos|King Minos]] and mother of the [[Minotaur]].<ref>Homer, ''Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+10.135&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 10.135]; Hesiod, ''Theogony'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+956&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130 956]; Apollodorus, ''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9%3Asection%3D1 1.9.1]; Apollonius Rhodius, ''Argonautica ''.</ref> Other accounts make her the daughter of [[Hecate]], the goddess of witchcraft herself.<ref>Grimal; Smith</ref> 

==In ancient literature==

===Homer's Odyssey===
In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', Circe is described as living in a mansion that stands in the middle of a clearing in a dense wood. Around the house prowled strangely docile [[panthera leo|lions]] and [[wolf|wolves]], the drugged victims of her magic;<ref>Homer, ''Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+10.212&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 10.212ff].</ref> they were not dangerous, and fawned on all newcomers. Circe worked at a huge [[loom]].<ref>Refer [[Weaving (mythology)]].</ref> She invited [[Odysseus]]' crew to a feast of familiar food, a pottage of cheese and meal, sweetened with honey and laced with wine, but also laced with one of her magical potions, and she turned them all into [[swine]] with a wand after they gorged themselves on it. Only [[Eurylochus (mythology)|Eurylochus]], suspecting treachery from the outset, escaped to warn Odysseus and the others who had stayed behind at the ships. Odysseus set out to rescue his men, but was intercepted by the messenger god, [[Hermes]], who had been sent by Athena. Hermes told Odysseus to use the holy herb [[moly (herb)|moly]] to protect himself from Circe's potion and, having resisted it, to draw his sword and act as if he were to attack Circe. From there, Circe would ask him to bed, but Hermes advised caution, for even there the goddess would be treacherous. She would take his manhood unless he had her swear by the names of the gods that she would not.

Odysseus followed Hermes's advice, freeing his men and then remained on the island for one year, feasting and drinking wine. According to Homer, Circe suggested two alternative routes to Odysseus to return to Ithaca: toward [[Planctae]], the "Wandering Rocks", or passing between the dangerous [[Scylla]] and the whirlpool-like [[Charybdis]], conventionally identified with the [[Strait of Messina]]. She also advised Odysseus to go to the Underworld and gave him directions.<ref>Homer, ''Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D475 10.475&mdash;541].</ref>

===Later Greek literature===
Towards the end of [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' (1011f), it is stated that Circe bore Odysseus three sons: [[Ardeas]] or Agrius (otherwise unknown); [[Latinus]]; and [[Telegonus]], who ruled over the Tyrsenoi, that is the [[Etruscans]]. The [[Telegony]] (Τηλεγόνεια), an epic now lost, relates the later history of the last of these. Circe eventually informed him who his absent father was and, when he set out to find Odysseus, gave him a poisoned spear. With this he killed his father unknowingly. Telegonus then brought back his father's corpse, together with [[Penelope]] and Odysseus' other son [[Telemachus]], to Aeaea. After burying Odysseus, Circe made the others immortal. According to [[Lycophron]]'s ''Alexandra'' (808) and [[John Tzetzes]]' [[scholia]] on the poem (795 - 808), however, Circe used magical herbs to bring Odysseus back to life after he had been killed by Telegonus. Odysseus then gave Telemachus to Circe's daughter Cassiphone in marriage. Some time later, Telemachus had a quarrel with his mother-in-law and killed her; Cassiphone then killed Telemachus to avenge her mother's death. On hearing of this, Odysseus died of grief. 

[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (1.72.5) cites Xenagoras, the second century BC historian, as claiming that Odysseus and Circe had three sons: Romus, Anteias, and Ardeias, who respectively founded three cities called by their names: [[Rome]], [[Antium]], and [[Ardea (RM)|Ardea]]. In a very late Alexandrian epic from the 5th century AD, the ''Dionysiaca'' of Nonnus, her son by [[Poseidon]] is mentioned under the name of Phaunos.<ref>Timothy Peter Wiseman, ''Remus: A Roman Myth'', Cambridge University 1995, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7LPNHRUlWacC&lpg=PA48&ots=-_sY_Y5iRY&dq=Phaunos%20Circe&pg=PA47#v=onepage&q=Phaunos%20Circe&f=false pp 47-8]</ref>

In the 3rd century BC epic, the [[Argonautica]], Apollonius Rhodius relates that Circe purified the [[Argonauts]] for the death of [[Absyrtus]],<ref>"They escaped neither the vast sea's hardships nor vexatious tempests till Kirké<!--Kirké in original--> should wash them clean of the pitiless murder of Apsyrtos" ([[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''Argonautica'', iv.586-88, in Peter Grean's translation).</ref> maybe reflecting an early tradition.<ref>See the ancient concept of ''[[Miasma (Greek mythology)|miasma]]'', a Peter Green's commentary on iv. 705-17, ''The Argonautika Apollonios Rhodios'', (1997, 2007) p 322.</ref> In this poem, the animals that surround her are not former lovers transformed but primeval ‘beasts, not resembling the beasts of the wild, nor yet like men in body, but with a medley of limbs.’<ref>
[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/830/830-h/830-h.htm#2H_4_0006 iv:659-84]</ref>

Three ancient plays about Circe have been lost: the work of the tragedian [[Aeschylus]] and of the 4th century BC comic dramatists [[Ephippus of Athens]] and Anaxilas. The first told the story of Odysseus' encounter with Circe. Vase paintings from the period suggest that Odysseus' half-transformed animal-men formed the chorus in place of the usual Satyrs. Fragments of Anaxilas also mention the transformation and one of the characters complains of the impossibility of scratching his face now that he is a pig.<ref>John E. Thorburn, ''FOF Companion to Classical Drama'', New York 2005, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k3NnUyqzRNYC&lpg=PA138&ots=sq7kt-2MFW&dq=Aeschylus%2C%20%22Circe%22%20%20%22fragment%22&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q=Circe&f=false p.138]</ref> {{-}}

===Latin literature===
The theme of turning men into a variety of animals was elaborated by later writers, especially in Latin. In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Aeneas skirts the Italian island where Circe now dwells, and hears the cries of her many victims, who now number more than the pigs of earlier accounts:
::::The roars of lions that refuse the chain, 
::::The grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears, 
::::And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' ears.<ref>[http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.7.vii.html Dryden’s translation]</ref>

Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' collects more transformation stories in its 14th book. The fourth episode covers Circe's encounter with Ulysses, with the detail that he too is changed to a pig and only [[Eurylochus (mythology)|Eurylochus]] remains to rescue the men (lines 242-307). The first episode in that book deals with the story of [[Glaucus]] and [[Scylla]], in which the enamoured sea-god seeks a love filtre to win Scylla's love, only to have the sorceress fall in love with him. When she is unsuccessful, she takes revenge on her rival by turning Scylla into a monster (lines 1-74). The story of the Latin king [[Picus]] is told in the fifth episode (and also alluded to in the ''Aeneid''). Circe fell in love with him too; when he preferred to remain faithful to his wife Canens, she turned him into a woodpecker (lines 308-440).<ref>[http://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidMetamorphoses14.html Online translation]</ref>

The ''[[Mamilia (gens)|gens Mamilia]]'' - described by [[Livy|Titus Livius]] as one of the most distinguished families of Latium<ref>''Dictionary of Greek & Roman Biography & Mythology''</ref><ref>[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', 1:49</ref> - claimed descent from Mamilia, a grand-daughter of Odysseus and Circe through [[Telegonus]]. One of the most well known of them was [[Octavius Mamilius]] (died 498 BC) , [[princeps]] of [[Tusculum]] and son-in-law of [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] the seventh and last king of [[Rome]].

Although some scenes from the ''Odyssey'' remained favorites of the vase-painters, notably the visually dramatic episode of Polyphemus, the Circe episode was rarely depicted. In describing an unusual miniature fifth-century Greek bronze in the [[Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore,<ref>Walters Art Museum, acc. no. 54.1483.</ref> that takes the form of a man on all fours with the foreparts of a pig, Dorothy Kent Hill expressed the artist's dilemma: how could an artist depict a man bewitched into a pig other than as a man with a pig's head? "An author can discuss the mind and the voice, but an artist cannot show them."<ref>Hill, "Odysseus' Companions on Circe's Isle" ''The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery'' '''4''' (1941:119-122) p. 120.</ref> In an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] bronze mirror relief, a common barnyard pig is depicted at the feet of Circe: Odysseus and Elpenor approach her, swords drawn.

The vase collection of the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]] in Athens, Greece holds a 5th-century BC [[lekythos]] with a depiction of this episode described as "Odysseus' companions turned into swine"<ref>AthensWalker, More pigs... at the [http://athenswalker.blogspot.com/2011/08/more-pigs-at-national-archaeological.html National Archaeological Museum of Athens]</ref>

{{see also|Circe in popular culture}}
[[File:The witch Circe poisons Odysseu's friends.jpg|thumb|Circe changing the companions of Ulysses into animals, an English mural from 1580]]

[[Giovanni Boccaccio]] provided a digest of what was known of Circe during the Middle Ages in his ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'' (''Famous Women'', 1361-1362). While following the tradition that she lived in Italy, he comments wryly that there are now many more temptresses like her to lead men astray.<ref>tr. Virginia Brown, Harvard University 2003 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3Nj04ULC0s8C&lpg=PA76&ots=PJw_ycvL0D&dq=boccaccio%20Circe&pg=PA74#v=onepage&q=boccaccio%20Circe&f=false ch.38, pp.74-6]</ref> 

There is a very different interpretation of the encounter with Circe in [[John Gower]]'s long didactic poem ''Confessio Amantis'' (1380). Ulysses is depicted as deeper in sorcery and readier of tongue than Circe and through this means leaves her pregnant with Telegonus. Most of the account deals with the son's later quest for and accidental killing of his father, drawing the moral that only evil can come of the use of sorcery.<ref>John Gower, English Works,  [http://archive.org/stream/completeworksofj03goweuoft#page/204/mode/2up 6.1391-1788]; there is also a [http://www.ellinanderson.com/Circe%20and%20Ulysses.html modern translation] by Ellin Anderson</ref>

The story of Ulysses and Circe was retold as an episode in [[:de:Georg Rollenhagen|Georg Rollenhagen]]'s German verse epic, ''Froschmeuseler'' (The frogs and mice, Magdeburg, 1595). In this 600-page expansion of the pseudo-Homeric ''[[Batrachomyomachia]]'', it is related at the court of the mice and takes up sections 5-8 of the first part.<ref>The German original is available on [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KPI6AAAAcAAJ&pg=PT241#v=onepage&q&f=false GoogleBooks]</ref>

In [[Lope de Vega]]'s miscellany ''La Circe - con otras rimas y prosas'' (Madrid 1624), the story of her encounter with Ulysses appears as a verse epic in three cantos.<ref>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=3qoS6eckQ-kC&printsec=titlepage&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false Pages 1-69]</ref> This takes its beginning from Homer’s account, but it is then embroidered; in particular, Circe’s love for Ulysses remains unrequited.

As "Circe's Palace", [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] retold the Homeric account as the third section in his collection of stories from Greek mythology, ''[[Tanglewood Tales]]'' (1853). The transformed Picus continually appears in this, trying to warn Ullyses, and then Eurylochus, of the danger to be found in the palace, and is rewarded at the end by being given back his human shape. In most accounts Ulysses only demands this for his own men.<ref>The third section of the [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/976/976-h/976-h.htm#2H_4_0003 Gutenberg edition]</ref>

==Scientific interpretations==
[[Image:Snowdrop Galanthus elwesii.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Snowdrop, perhaps the herb [[moly (herb)|moly]]]]

In botany the Circaea are plants belonging to the [[enchanter's nightshade]] genus. The name was given by botanists in the late 16th century in the belief that this was the herb used by Circe to charm Odysseus' companions.<ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/enchanter's%2Bnightshade Oxford Dictionary]</ref> 

Medical historians have speculated that the transformation to pigs was not intended literally but refers to [[anticholinergic]] intoxication.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Plaitakis A, Duvoisin RC |title=Homer's moly identified as ''Galanthus nivalis L.'': physiologic antidote to stramonium poisoning |journal=Clin Neuropharmacol |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |year=1983 |month=March |pmid=6342763 |doi=10.1097/00002826-198303000-00001}}</ref> Symptoms include [[amnesia]], [[hallucinations]], and [[delusions]]. The description of "moly" fits the [[snowdrop]], a [[flower]] of the region that contains [[galantamine]], which is an [[anticholinesterase]] and can therefore counteract anticholinergics.

The "Circe effect", coined by the enzymologist William P. Jencks, refers to a scenario where an [[enzyme]] lures its [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] towards it through electrostatic forces exhibited by the enzyme molecule before transforming it into [[Product (biology)|product]]. Where this takes place, the catalytic velocity (rate of reaction) of the enzyme may be significantly faster than that of others.<ref>{{cite book |isbn=978-0-7167-6766-4 |author=Jeremy M. Berg, John L. Tymoczko, Lubert Stryer. |year=2006 |publisher=Freeman |location=New York, NY |title=Biochemistry}}</ref>

[[Linnaeus]] named a genus of the Venus clams (Veneridae) after Circe in 1778.<ref>[http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=216564 Species details]; there are pictures on the [http://www.conchology.be/?t=65&family=VENERIDAE Conchology site]</ref> Her name has also been given to [[34 Circe]], a large, dark main-belt asteroid first sighted in 1855.

There are also a variety of chess variants named [[Circe chess|Circe]] in which captured pieces are reborn on their starting positions. The rules for this were formulated in 1968.

Indian author [[Nirad C. Chaudhuri]] named his 1965 book of essays "[[The Continent of Circe]]", using the Greek mythological character as a metaphor for his interpretation of India's history.
