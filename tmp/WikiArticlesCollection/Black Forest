The '''Black Forest''' ({{lang-de|Schwarzwald}}, {{IPA-de|ˈʃvaʁt͡svalt|pron}}) is a [[forest|wooded]] [[mountain range]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]], southwestern [[Germany]]. It is bordered by the [[Rhine]] valley to the west and south. The highest peak is the [[Feldberg (Black Forest)|Feldberg]] with an elevation of 1,493 metres (4,898&nbsp;ft). The region is almost rectangular with a length of {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} and breadth of up to {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

==Geology==
[[File:Schwarzwald topo.jpg|thumb|Topography of the Black Forest]]
The Black Forest consists of a cover of [[sandstone]] on top of a core of [[gneiss]] and [[granite]]s. Formerly it shared tectonic evolution with the nearby [[Vosges Mountains]]. Later during the Middle [[Eocene]] a [[rifting]] period affected the area and caused formation of the [[Rhine graben]]. During the last [[glacial period]] of the [[Würm glaciation]], the Black Forest was covered by glaciers; several [[Tarn (lake)|tarns (or lakes)]] such as the [[Mummelsee]] are remains of this period.

==Rivers==
Rivers in the Black Forest include the [[Danube]] (which originates in the Black Forest as the confluence of the [[Brigach]] and [[Breg (river)|Breg]] rivers), the [[Enz]], the [[Kinzig (Rhine)|Kinzig]], the [[Murg (Northern Black Forest)|Murg]], the [[Nagold River|Nagold]], the [[Neckar]], the [[Rench]], and the [[Wiese]]. The Black Forest occupies part of the [[continental divide]] between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] [[drainage basin]] (drained by the [[Rhine]]) and the [[Black Sea]] drainage basin (drained by the Danube).

==Mountains==
Some of the highest mountains in the Black Forest are:
* [[Feldberg (Black Forest)|Feldberg]] ({{convert|1493|m|abbr=on}}), highest mountain of the Black Forest
* [[Herzogenhorn]] ({{convert|1415|m|abbr=on}})
* [[Belchen]] ({{convert|1414|m|abbr=on}})
* [[Schauinsland]] ({{convert|1284|m|abbr=on}})
* [[Kandel (mountain)|Kandel]] ({{convert|1241|m|abbr=on}})
* [[Blauen (Badenweiler)|Blauen]] ({{convert|1165|m|abbr=on}})
* [[Hornisgrinde]] ({{convert|1164|m|abbr=on}}), highest mountain of the Northern Black Forest

==Political jurisdiction==
[[File:Schwarzwaelderin in Tracht um 1900.jpg|thumb|An unmarried Girl of the Black Forest wearing a red [[Bollenhut]] (1900)]]

Administratively, the Black Forest belongs completely to the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]] and comprises the cities of [[Pforzheim]], [[Baden-Baden]] and [[Freiburg]] as well as the following districts (''[[Districts of Germany|Kreise]]''). In the north: [[Enz (district)|Enz]], [[Rastatt (district)|Rastatt]] and [[Calw (district)|Calw]]; in the middle: [[Freudenstadt (district)|Freudenstadt]], [[Ortenaukreis]] and [[Rottweil (district)|Rottweil]]; in the south: [[Emmendingen (district)|Emmendingen]], [[Schwarzwald-Baar]], [[Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald]], [[Lörrach (district)|Lörrach]] and [[Waldshut (district)|Waldshut]].

==Ecology and economy==
The forest mostly consists of [[pine]]s and [[fir]]s, chiefly a mixture of the European native [[Norway Spruce]] and American imported [[Douglas Fir]] and [[White Pine]]. Some of them are grown in commercial [[monoculture]]. Similar to other forested regions, the Black Forest has had areas that were annihilated by mass [[logging]]. Due to logging and land use changes the forest proper is only a fraction of its original size and the original hardwood trees were replaced by fast-growing conifers. The cyclone [[Lothar (storm)|Lothar]] downed trees on hundreds of acres of mountaintops in 1999. This left some of the high peaks and scenic hills bare, with only primary growth shrubs and young fir trees.

The main industry is [[tourism]]. In addition to the towns and monuments noted below, the Black Forest is crossed by numerous [[long distance footpath]]s, including some of the first to be established. The [[European long-distance path]] [[European walking route E1|E1]] crosses the Black Forest following the routes of some of the local long-distance paths. There are numerous shorter paths suitable for day walks, as well as [[mountain biking]] and [[cross-country skiing]] trails. The total network of tracks amounts to around {{convert|23000|km}}, and is maintained and overseen by a voluntary body, the ''[[Schwarzwaldverein]]'' (Black Forest Society), which has around 90,000 members (figures from Bremke, 1999, p.&nbsp;9).

[[Black Forest clockmakers]] are renowned for their precision clocks. Most of the mechanical clocks are now sold as antiquities as many factories were shut down after the [[First World War]] and the [[Second World War]]. A few factories survived the structural change.

There are many historic towns in the Black Forest. Popular tourist destinations include [[Freiburg]], [[Calw]] (the birth town of [[Hermann Hesse]]), [[Gengenbach]], [[Staufen, Germany|Staufen]], [[Schiltach]], [[Haslach im Kinzigtal|Haslach]] and [[Altensteig]]. Other popular destinations include such mountains as the Feldberg, the [[Belchen]], the [[Kandel (Black Forest)|Kandel]], and the Schauinsland; the [[Titisee]] and [[Schluchsee]] lakes; the [[All Saints Waterfalls]]; the [[Triberg Waterfalls]], not the highest, but the most famous waterfalls in Germany; and the [[canyon|gorge]] of the River [[Wutach (river)|Wutach]].

The [[Black Forest Open Air Museum]] is an open-air museum that shows the life of 16th or 17th century farmers in the region, featuring a number of reconstructed Black Forest farms. The [[German Clock Museum]] in [[Furtwangen im Schwarzwald|Furtwangen]] portrays the history of the [[clock]] industry and of [[watch]]makers.

For drivers, the main route through the region is the fast [[Bundesautobahn 5|A 5]] (E35) motorway, but a variety of signposted scenic routes such as the [[Schwarzwaldhochstraße]] ({{convert|60|km|abbr=on}}, [[Baden-Baden]] to [[Freudenstadt]]), Schwarzwald Tälerstraße ({{convert|100|km|abbr=on}}, the [[Murg (Northern Black Forest)|Murg]] and [[Kinzig (Rhine)|Kinzig]] valleys) or Badische Weinstraße (Baden Wine Street, {{convert|160|km|abbr=on}}, a wine route from [[Baden-Baden]] to [[Weil am Rhein]]) offers calmer driving along high roads.<ref>[http://travel.independent.co.uk/europe/article97082.ece]</ref> The last is a picturesque trip starting in the south of the Black Forest going north and includes numerous old wineries and tiny villages. Another, more specialized route is the German Clock Route (''Deutsche Uhrenstraße''),<ref>[http://www.deutsche-uhrenstrasse.de/sofindensieunsen.htm]</ref> a circular route which traces the [[horology|horological]] history of the region.

Due to the rich mining history dating from medieval times (the Black Forest was one of the most important mining regions of Europe circa 1100) there are many mines re-opened to the public. Such mines may be visited in the Kinzig valley, the Suggental, the Muenster valley, and around Todtmoos.

The Black Forest was visited on several occasions by Count [[Otto von Bismarck]] during his years as Prussian and later German chancellor (1862–1890). Allegedly, he especially was interested in the [[Triberg Waterfalls]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=GOwOyUl7-TMC&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=bismarck+triberg&source=bl&ots=o0tRfEUt2Z&sig=EddXNLXfR1TCIzsN2HxkV2MnM_4&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result]</ref> There is now a monument in Triberg dedicated to Bismarck, who apparently enjoyed the tranquility of the region as an escape from his day-to-day political duties in Berlin.

==Fauna==
In addition to the expected kinds of wildlife to be found in a European forest area, the following types of animals may be observed in the Black Forest.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070813055539/http://www.blackforest-tourism.com/index.php/layout/set/print/sprachversionen/natur/natur_mit_allen_sinnen_wahrnehmen__1 Enjoy nature with all the senses / Nature / Home / Inhalte – Schwarzwald Tourismus GmbH<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Culture==
[[File:Du200613.gif|thumb|upright|A cuckoo clock, symbol of the Black Forest and Germany.]]
Dialects spoken in the Black Forest area are [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] and [[Swabian German|Swabian]].

===Crafts===
[[Wood-carving]] is a traditional cottage industry in the region and carved ornaments now are produced in substantial numbers as souvenirs for tourists. [[Cuckoo clock]]s are a popular example; they have been made in the region since the early 18th century and much of their development occurred there. 

In the past [[singing bird box]]es were produced as well.

===Culinary===
[[Black Forest ham]] originated from this region, and so, by name and reputation at least, did the [[Black Forest Cake]]. It also is known as the "Black Forest Cherry Cake" or "Black Forest Gateau" and is made with chocolate cake, cream, sour cherries and [[Kirsch]].<ref>http://www.europeancuisines.com/German-Schwarzwalder-Kirschtorte-Recipe-Black-Forest-Cake-Cherry-Kirsch</ref> The Black Forest variety of ''[[Tarte flambée|Flammkuchen]]'' is a Badisch specialty made with ham, cheese and cream. ''[[Pancake|Pfannkuchen]]'', a [[crêpe]] or [[Pancake#Regional varieties|crêpe-like]] (''[[:de:Eierkuchen|Eierkuchen]]'' or ''[[Palatschinken]]'') pastry, is also common. 
The Black Forest is also known for its long tradition in gourmet cuisine. No fewer than 17 [[Michelin star]]red restaurants are located in the region, among them two restaurants with 3 stars (Restaurants Bareiss and Schwarzwaldstube in [[Baiersbronn]])<ref>[http://www.viamichelin.de/web/Restaurants  Michelin Restaurants]. Via Michelin. Retrieved 18 June 2011</ref> as well as the only restaurant in Germany that has been awarded a Michelin star every year since 1966. At Schwarzwald Hotel Adler in Häusern, three generations of chefs from the same family have defended the award from the first year the ''[[Michelin Guide]]'' selected restaurants in Germany until today.<ref>[http://www.adler-schwarzwald.de/en/adler-magazine/michelin-guide/ "The ''[[Michelin Guide]]'' and the Zumkeller Chefs"]. Schwarzwald Hotel Adler. Retrieved 18 June 2011</ref>

===Fasnet===
The German holiday of [[Fastnacht]], or Fasnet, as it is known in the Black Forest region, occurs in the time leading up to [[Lent]]. On [[Fasnetmendig]], or the Monday before [[Ash Wednesday]], crowds of people line the streets, wearing wooden, mostly hand-carved masks. One prominent style of mask is called the Black Forest Style, originating from the Black Forest Region.
