{{spanish name 2|Valderrama|Palacio}}
'''Carlos Alberto Valderrama Palacio''' ({{IPA-es|ˈkarlos alˈberto βaldeˈrama paˈlasjo}};<ref>[[Colombian Spanish]] pronunciation.</ref> born September 2, 1961 in [[Santa Marta]], [[Colombia]]), also known as ''El Pibe'' ("The Kid") is a former Colombian [[association football|football player]]. His mass of blond afro hair, coupled with his flamboyant technique on the ball, made him one of Colombia's most recognizable [[Association football|footballers]], and arguably, one of the most recognizable footballers around the globe historically.

Valderrama was well known during his time in [[Major League Soccer]]. Perhaps one of the most noticeable foreign players to ever grace MLS, he played a huge role in the uprising of the league itself during the 1990s; most noticeably by becoming a pioneer that inspired a wave of Colombian (as well as general foreign) footballers to play their talents in the league causing a huge influence of increasing both the popularity and strength of the league itself. To this day, he is an icon as one of the most decorated [[playmaker]]s to ever play in the MLS.<ref>http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1614638.html</ref><ref>http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/03/08/colombians-mls-stability-status-influence-recent-shift</ref><ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/19/mls-colombia-colombians-portland-timbers-diego-chara</ref><ref>http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1110/major-league-soccer/2010/10/19/2172421/colombia-makes-an-impact-on-major-league-soccer</ref>

Valderrama was a member of the [[Colombia national football team]] in the 1990s. Between 1985 and 1998 he represented [[Colombia]] in 111 full internationals and scored 11 times, making him the most capped [[Association footballer|player]] in the country's history. Valderrama was known for the accuracy of his passing, his tactical brain which allowed him to have a strong presence without the necessity of running as much as it would be expected, his exquisite technique on the ball, and his ability to provide assists that were very immaculate.<ref>http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=1451394.html</ref><ref>http://www.fifa.com/newscentre/features/news/newsid=1619243/index.html?intcmp=newsreader_news_box_4</ref> Valderrama played a huge role during the golden era of Colombian football during the 1990s. In 2004, Valderrama was included in the [[FIFA 100]], a list of "greatest living footballers" chosen by [[Pelé]] to celebrate the 100th anniversary of [[FIFA]].

==Career==
Valderrama began his career at [[Unión Magdalena]] of the Colombian First Division in 1981. He also played for [[Millonarios]] and [[Deportivo Cali]] before joining [[Montpellier Hérault SC|Montpellier]] of the [[Ligue 1|French First Division]] in 1988. He then went on to play for [[Independiente Medellín]] and then [[Atlético Junior]], for whom he won the Colombian championship in 1993 and 1995. In 1996, he went to the US to play for the [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] (1996–97, 2000–01), [[Miami Fusion]] (1998–99), and [[Colorado Rapids]] (2001–02). While a member of the Mutiny, the team would sell Carlos Valderrama wigs at [[Tampa Stadium]]. In [[Major League Soccer]], Valderrama scored relatively few goals (16) for a midfielder, but is the league's second all-time leader in assists (114) after [[Steve Ralston]] (121), a former teammate. In 2005, he was named to the [[MLS All-Time Best XI]]. He was also named one of the top players of the 20th century by [[Pelé]] in 1999.<ref>[[FIFA 100]]</ref>

As a player, Valderrama was known for his excellent field vision and elegance on the ball.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} He captained Colombia's national football team to victory in the 1994 Fifa World Cup [[CONMEBOL]] qualifiers. He always wore the number 10 jersey, and was a complete free kick specialist.

==Retirement as player==

Valderrama has since become assistant manager of Atlético Junior. On November 1, 2007, Valderrama accused a referee of corruption by waving cash in the face of Oscar Julian Ruiz when the official awarded a penalty to [[América de Cali]]. Junior lost the match 4–1, which ended the club's hopes of playoff qualification.<ref>[[Associated Press|AP]] (2007), [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2007-11-01-3659438715_x.htm Valderrama expelled from match for taunting referee with cash], [[USA Today]], 1 November 2007, usatoday.com.
