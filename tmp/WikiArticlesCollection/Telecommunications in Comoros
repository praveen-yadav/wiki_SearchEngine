==Special projects==

In October 2011 the State of Qatar launched a special program for the construction of a [[wireless network]] to interconnect the three islands of the archipelago, by means of low cost, repeatable technology. The project has been developed by [[Qatar University]] and [[Politecnico di Torino]], under the supervision of prof. Mazen Hasna and prof. [[Daniele Trinchero]], with a major participation of local actors (Comorian Government, NRTIC, University of Comoros). The project has been referred as an example of [[technology transfer]] and Sustainable Inclusion in [[Developing country|developing countries]]
