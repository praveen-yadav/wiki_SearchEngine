'''Augustin-Jean Fresnel''' ({{IPAc-en|f|r|eɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|l}} {{respell|fray|NEL|'}}; {{IPA-fr|ɔ.ɡy.stɛ̃ ʒɑ̃ fʁɛ.nɛl|lang}}; 1788–1827)<!--Per MOS, full dates in infobox need not be repeated in lede-->, was a [[France|French]] [[engineer]] and [[physicist]] who contributed significantly to the establishment of the theory of [[wave|wave optics]]. Fresnel studied the behaviour of light both theoretically and experimentally.

He is perhaps best known as the [[inventor]] of the [[Fresnel lens]], first adopted in [[lighthouse]]s while he was a French commissioner of lighthouses, and found in many applications today.  His [[Fresnel equations]] on waves and [[reflectivity]] also form the basis for many applications in [[computer graphics]] today - for instance, the rendering of [[water]].

==Biography==

Fresnel was the son of an architect, born at [[Broglie, Eure|Broglie]] ([[Eure]]). His early progress in learning was slow, and he still could not read when he was eight years old. At thirteen he entered the École Centrale in [[Caen]], and at sixteen and a half the [[École Polytechnique]], where he acquitted himself with distinction. From there he went to the [[École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées|École des Ponts et Chaussées]]. He served as an engineer successively in the departments of [[Vendée]], [[Drôme]] and [[Ille-et-Vilaine]]; but having supported the [[Bourbon house|Bourbons]] in 1814 he lost his appointment on [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] return to power.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1815, on the second restoration of the monarchy, he obtained a post as engineer in [[Paris]], where he spent much of his life from that time onwards.  He appears to have begun his research in optics around 1814, when he prepared a paper on the [[aberration of light]], although it was never published. In 1818 he wrote a memoir on [[diffraction]], for which he received the prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des Sciences]] at Paris in the ensuing year. He was the first to construct a special type of lens, now called a [[Fresnel lens]], as a substitute for mirrors in lighthouses.  In 1819, he was nominated to be a commissioner of lighthouses.  In 1823 he was unanimously elected a member of the academy, and in 1825 he became a member of the [[Royal Society of London]].  In 1827, the time of his last illness, the Royal Society of London awarded him the [[Rumford Medal]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Fresnel died of [[tuberculosis]] at [[Ville-d'Avray]], near Paris.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He received only scant public recognition during his lifetime for his labours in the cause of optical science.  Some of his papers were not printed by the Académie des Sciences until many years after his death. But as he wrote to Young in 1824: in himself "that sensibility, or that vanity, which people call love of glory" had been blunted. "All the compliments," he says, "that I have received from [[François Arago|Arago]], [[Pierre Simon, Marquis de Laplace|Laplace]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Biot|Biot]] never gave me so much pleasure as the discovery of a theoretic truth, or the confirmation of a calculation by experiment".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

His name is one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower]].

==Research==
[[File:David d'Angers - Fresnel.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bust of Augustin Fresnel by [[David d'Angers]].]]

His discoveries and mathematical deductions, building on experimental work by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], extended the [[Huygens' principle|wave theory]] of [[light]] to a large class of [[optical phenomenon|optical phenomena]], especially, to the [[Birefringence|double-refraction]] property of [[Iceland Spar]], or [[calcite]].<ref name="Whittaker" /> In 1817, Young had proposed a small transverse component to light, while yet retaining a far larger longitudinal component. Fresnel, by the year 1821, was able to show via mathematical methods that [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] could be explained only if light was ''entirely'' transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.

He proposed the [[aether drag hypothesis]] to explain a lack of variation in astronomical observations.

His use of two plane mirrors of metal, forming with each other an angle of nearly 180°, allowed him to avoid the diffraction effects caused (by the apertures) in the experiment of [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|F. M. Grimaldi]] on [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]]. This allowed him to conclusively account for the phenomenon of interference in accordance with the wave theory.

With [[François Arago]] he studied the laws of the interference of polarized rays. He obtained circularly polarized light by means of a rhombus of glass, known as a [[Fresnel rhomb]], having obtuse angles of 126° and acute angles of 54°.

Perhaps Fresnel's most widely interpreted written work was his Memoir on the Diffraction of Light, submitted to the Academe of science in 1818. Below are translations of his publications into English:
