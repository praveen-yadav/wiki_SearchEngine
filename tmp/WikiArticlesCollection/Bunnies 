'''''Bunnies & Burrows''''' (''B&B'') is a [[role-playing game]] (RPG) inspired by the novel ''[[Watership Down]]''.<ref name="GURPS">''GURPS Bunnies & Burrows'' (1992), [[Steve Jackson Games]], ISBN 978-1-55634-237-0</ref> Published by [[Fantasy Games Unlimited]] in [[1976 in games|1976]], the game centered on intelligent [[rabbits]]. It introduced several innovations to role-playing game design, being the first game to allow players to have non-[[humanoid]] roles, and the first to have detailed [[martial arts]] and skill systems. Fantasy Games Unlimited published a second edition of the game in 1982, and the game was modified and republished by [[Steve Jackson Games]] as an official [[List of GURPS books|''GURPS'' supplement]] in 1992.

As [[rabbit]]s, [[player character]]s are faced with dangers mirroring those in the real world. The only true "[[monster]]s" in the game are humans, but there are many predators and natural hazards. The characters' position in the [[food chain]] promotes an emphasis on role-playing and problem solving over combat.

==History==

Originally published by [[Fantasy Games Unlimited]] in 1976, only two years after the first role-playing game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' was published,<ref name="sos"/> this edition is now long out of print. The game was inspired by [[Richard Adams]]' fantasy novel ''[[Watership Down]]'',<ref>{{cite book | last = Magill | first = Frank Northen | year = 1983 | title = Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature | publisher = [[Salem Press]] | isbn = 0-89356-450-8 }}</ref> and the players were given the opportunity to take on the role of rabbits.<ref name="sos"/> As such, the game emphasized role-playing over combat for, according to [[Steffan O'Sullivan]], "You're playing a rabbit, after all â€“ how much combat do you want to do?"<ref name="sos"/> The poor production values provided a barrier to the acceptance of the game. The art, by Charles Loving, was "sketchy and of poor quality", while the document as a whole gave the appearance of having been [[Typewriter|typewritten]].<ref name="rpgnet1">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_4598.html |title=Bunnies and Burrows |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author=Jason Morningstar |date=2001-08-07 |work= |publisher=[[RPGnet]]}}</ref> 

Building on this first edition, in 1979, B. Dennis Sustare wrote ''"Different Worlds Present the World of Druid's Valley: A Bunnies & Burrows Campaign"'' in ''[[Different Worlds]]'', a magazine published by [[Chaosium]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nobleknight.com/ProductDetailSearch.asp_Q_ProductID_E_4939_A_InventoryID_E_2147574686_A_ProductLineID_E__A_ManufacturerID_E__A_CategoryID_E__A_GenreID_E_ |title= #3 "Blackmoor, Bunnies & Burrows Campaign"|accessdate=2008-09-03 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Noble Knight Games}}</ref> It detailed how to combine the world of ''Bunnies & Burrows'' with other [[fantasy world]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sustare |first=B.

The original game was very innovative for its time (less than two years after the first published RPG). Not only could you play non-humanoids for the first time, but it was the first role-playing game to have detailed martial arts rules, the first attempt at a skill system, and the first RPG to appeal as widely to women as to men<ref name="sos" />

''Bunnies & Burrows'' was the first role-playing game to allow for non-humanoid play.<ref name="sos">{{cite web |url=http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/bunny.html|title=Bunnies & Burrows|accessdate=2007-09-11|author=Steffan O'Sullivan|date=1998-06-20|publisher=SOS' Gameviews}}</ref><ref name="ptgptb3">{{cite web |url=http://ptgptb.org/0003/news3.html |title=RPG News |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author= |date=Issue 3, June 1998 |work= |publisher=Places to Go, People to Be}}</ref> In addition, it was also the first role-playing game to have detailed martial arts rules (known as "''Bun Fu''")<ref name="rpgnet2">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12907.phtml |title=Review of GURPS Bunnies & Burrows |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author=Lev Lafayette |date=2007-04-16 |work= |publisher=[[RPGnet]]}}</ref> and the first attempt at a skill system.<ref name="sos"/> For its time, the game was considered "light years" ahead of the [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|Original ''Dungeons & Dragons'']].<ref name="rpgnet1"/>

[[Player (game)|Players]] of ''Bunnies & Burrows'' take the role of [[rabbit]]s as their [[player characters]]. Interaction with many different animal species is part of normal gameplay. [[Human]]s, whose thought processes and motivations are completely [[Alien (signifier)|alien]], are the only monster to be encountered.<ref name="rollsite">{{cite web |url=http://translate.google.com/translate?sourceid=navclient&hl=en&u=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2eroliste%2ecom%2fdetail%2ejsp%3fid%3d8166 |title=Bunnies & Burrows (French) |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Rollsite}}</ref>

''Bunnies & Burrows'' has the advantage of offering players an intuitive grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in [[Fictional universe|game worlds]] that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told their character is confronted with a [[fox]]. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker than many of the dangers they face, the game is one of the first to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.<ref name="rollsite"/>

The mechanics of the [[role-playing game system]] were created specifically for ''Bunnies & Burrows'', common at the time of its original publishing. It features eight [[statistic (role-playing games)|abilities]] and eight [[character class|classes]]. The task resolution system is based on rolls of [[percentile dice]].<ref name="rollsite"/> Although newer systems have updated game mechanics significantly, the ideas presented in ''Bunnies & Burrows'' created the framework for modern role-playing games.<ref name="played"/>

''GURPS Bunnies & Burrows'' uses the [[GURPS|''GURPS'' system]] common in all ''GURPS'' products.<ref name="sjg"/> Steffan O'Sullivan, who wrote ''GURPS Bunnies & Burrows'' notes, "The game has also been published as a GURPS supplement, but I usually play it in [[Fudge (role-playing game system)|Fudge]] these days - the simpler rules seem to work better for this genre in particular. I've also run it in Sherpa, which is oddly evocative of the original rules."<ref>[http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/bunny.html "Bunnies & Burrows"], remarks by [[Steffan O'Sullivan]], June 20, 1998</ref>

==Reception==
Although the game had "incredible role-playing potential", the concept of role-playing rabbits can be viewed as bizarre, and as such at least one commentator believes that "most people thought it was stupid" when it was first released.<ref name="Astinus">{{cite journal | author = Astinus | url = http://ptgptb.org/0003/hist3.html | title = The History of Roleplaying | accessdate = 2008-09-12 | date = June, 1998 |work = Places to Go, People to Be  | issue = 3 }}</ref> This view is mirrored by Lev Lafayette, who, when describing his first exposure to the game, says "Oh, how we laughed. 'Who on earth would want to roleplay a rabbit?', we mocked. 'What's the point? You can't do anything!'".<ref name="rpgnet2" /> In spite of these first impressions, the game has generally received positive reviews: Lafayette, for example, goes on to say that it is "really hard to fault ''GURPS Bunnies & Burrows''", as it is educational, realistic, whimsical and clever,<ref name="rpgnet2" /> while the game has also been described as a "work of genius".<ref name="Astinus" />
