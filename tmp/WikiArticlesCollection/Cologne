'''Cologne''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|k|ə|ˈ|l|oʊ|n}}, {{lang-de|Köln}} {{IPA-de|kœln||Koeln.ogg}}, {{lang-ksh|Kölle}} {{IPA-dedia|ˈkœɫə||Koelle.ogg}}) is Germany's [[List of cities in Germany by population|fourth-largest city]] (after [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Munich]]), and is the largest city both in the German Federal State of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and within the [[Rhine-Ruhr|Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Area]], one of the major European metropolitan areas with more than ten million inhabitants.

Cologne is located on both sides of the [[Rhine]] River. The city's famous [[Cologne Cathedral]] (''Kölner Dom'') is the seat of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[List of bishops and archbishops of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]]. The [[University of Cologne]] (''Universität zu Köln'') is one of Europe's oldest and largest universities.<ref name="Cologneeconomy">{{cite web|title=Economy|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/economy|publisher=KölnTourismus|accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref>

Cologne was founded and established in the first century AD, as the [[Roman colony|Roman]] ''[[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]]'' in [[Ubii]] territory.<ref name="Cologne History">{{cite web|title=From Ubii village to metropolis|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/history/from_ubii_village_metropolis|publisher=City of Cologne|accessdate=16 April 2011}}</ref> It was the capital of the Roman province of ''[[Germania Inferior]]'' and the headquarters of the military in the region until occupied by the [[Ripuarian Franks|Franks]] in 462. During the Middle Ages it flourished as one of the most important major [[trade routes]] between east and west in Europe. Cologne was one of the leading members of the [[Hanseatic League]] and one of the largest cities north of the [[Alps]] in medieval and renaissance times. Up until World War II the city had undergone several other occupations by the French and also the British. Cologne was one of the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|most heavily bombed cities]] in Germany during World War II. The bombing reduced the population by 95% and destroyed almost the entire city. With the intention of restoring as many historic buildings as possible, the rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape.

Cologne is a major cultural center of the [[Rhineland]]; it is home to more than thirty [[museum]]s and hundreds of galleries. Exhibitions range from local ancient Roman archeological sites to contemporary graphics and sculpture. The [[Cologne Trade Fair]] hosts a number of [[trade show]]s such as [[Art Cologne]], [[imm Cologne]], [[Gamescom]], and the [[Photokina]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Cologne}}

===Roman Cologne===
The first urban settlement on the grounds of modern-day Cologne was ''Oppidum Ubiorum'', founded in 38 BC by the [[Ubii]], a [[Germani cisrhenani|Cisrhenian]] [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]]. In 50 AD, the Romans founded Colonia on the [[Rhine]]<ref name="Cologne History"/> and the city became the provincial capital of [[Germania Inferior]] in 85 AD.<ref name="Facts and figures">{{cite web|title=Facts and figures|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/history/facts_and_figures|publisher=City of Cologne|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> The city was named "''[[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]]''" in 50 AD.<ref name="Facts and figures"/> Considerable Roman remains can be found in present-day Cologne, especially near the wharf area, where a notable discovery of a 1900-year-old Roman boat was made in late 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18208 |title=C.Michael Hogan, '&#39;Cologne Wharf'&#39;, The Megalithic Portal, editor Andy Burnham, 2007 |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref> From 260 to 271 Cologne was the capital of the [[Gallic Empire]] under [[Postumus]], [[Marcus Aurelius Marius|Marius]], and [[Victorinus]]. In 310 under [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] a bridge was built over the Rhine at Cologne. Roman imperial governors resided in the city and it became one of the most important trade and production centers in the Roman Empire north of the Alps.<ref name="Cologne History"/>

Maternus, who was elected as [[bishop]] in 313, was the first known bishop of Cologne. The city was the capital of a Roman province until occupied by the [[Ripuarian Franks]]  in 462. Parts of the original Roman sewers are preserved underneath the city, with the [[Cologne sewerage system|new sewerage system]] having opening in 1890.

===Middle Ages===
Early medieval Cologne was part of [[Austrasia]] within the [[Frankish Empire]]. 
Cologne had been the seat of a bishop since the Roman period;  under [[Charlemagne]], in 795, bishop [[Hildebold]] was promoted to [[archbishop]].<ref name="Cologne History"/>

In 953, the archbishops of Cologne first gained noteworthy secular power, when bishop [[Bruno I, Archbishop of Cologne|Bruno]] was appointed as duke by his brother Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]]. In order to weaken the secular nobility, who threatened his power, Otto endowed Bruno and his successors on the bishop's see with the prerogatives of secular princes, thus establishing the [[Electorate of Cologne]],  formed by the temporal possessions of the archbishopric and included in the end a strip of territory along the left Bank of the [[Rhine]] east of [[Jülich]], as well as the [[Duchy of Westphalia]] on the other side of the Rhine, beyond [[Berg (state)|Berg]] and [[County of Mark|Mark]]. 
By the end of the 12th century, the Archbishop of Cologne was one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Emperor.  Besides being prince elector, he was Arch-chancellor of [[Italy]] as well, technically from 1238 and permanently from 1263 until 1803.

Following the [[Battle of Worringen]] in 1288, Cologne gained its independence from the archbishops and became a [[Free Imperial City|Free City]]. Archbishop [[Sigfried II von Westerburg]]  was forced into exile in [[Bonn]].<ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia">Harry de Quetteville. "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04116a.htm History of Cologne]". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', Nov 28, 2009.</ref> 
The archbishop nevertheless preserved the right of [[capital punishment]]. Thus the municipal council (though in strict political opposition towards the archbishop) depended upon him in all matters concerning criminal justice. This included torture, which sentence was only allowed to be handed down by the episcopal judge, the so-called "Greve". This legal situation lasted until the French conquest of Cologne.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Besides its economic and political significance Cologne also became an important center of medieval pilgrimage, when Cologne's Archbishop [[Rainald of Dassel]] gave the relics of the [[Three Wise Men]] to Cologne's cathedral in 1164 (after they in fact had been captured from [[Milan]]). Besides the three magi Cologne preserves the relics of [[Saint Ursula]] and [[Albertus Magnus]].<ref>Joseph P. Huffman, ''Family, Commerce, and Religion in London and Cologne'' (1998) covers from 1000 to 1300.</ref>

Cologne's location on the river Rhine placed it at the intersection of the major [[trade route]]s between east and west and was the basis of Cologne's growth. Cologne was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]]  in 1475, when [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] confirmed the city's imperial immediacy.<ref name="Cologne History"/>

[[File:Cologn1411.jpg|thumb|550px|center|Cologne around 1411]]

===Early modern history===
The economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterized by the city's status as a major harbour and transport hub upon the Rhine. Craftsmanship was organized by self-administering guilds, some of which were exclusive to women.

As a free city Cologne was a sovereign state within the Holy Roman Empire and as such had the right (and obligation) to maintain its own military force. Wearing a red uniform these troops were known as the ''Rote Funken'' (red sparks). These soldiers were part of the Army of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ("Reichskontingent") and fought in the wars of the 17th and 18th century, including the wars against revolutionary France, when the small force was almost completely wiped out in combat. The tradition of these troops is preserved as a military persiflage by Cologne's most outstanding carnival society, the ''Rote Funken''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rote-funken.de/ |title=Rote Funken - Kölsche Funke rut-wieß vun 1823 e.V. - Rote Funken Koeln |publisher=Rote-funken.de |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref>

The free city of Cologne must not be confused with the [[Archbishopric of Cologne]] which was a state of its own within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Since the second half of the 16th century the archbishops were taken from the [[Bavaria]]n dynasty [[Wittelsbach]]. Due to the free status of Cologne, the archbishops were usually not allowed to enter the city. Thus they took up residence in [[Bonn]] and later in [[Brühl, North Rhine-Westphalia|Brühl]] on the Rhine. As members of an influential and powerful family and supported by their outstanding status as [[Prince-elector|electors]], the archbishops of Cologne repeatedly challenged and threatened the free status of Cologne during the 17th and 18th century, resulting in complicated affairs, which were handled by diplomatic means and propaganda as well as by the supreme courts of the Holy Roman Empire.

===From the 19th century until World War II===
Cologne lost its status as a [[Free Imperial City|free city]] during the French period. According to the Peace [[Treaty of Lunéville]] (1801) all the territories of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the left bank of the Rhine were officially incorporated into the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] (which had already occupied Cologne in 1794). Thus this region later became part of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] Empire. Cologne was part of the French [[Department (administrative division)|Département]] [[Roer (department)|Roer]] (named after the River Roer, German: [[Rur]]) with [[Aachen]] (French: Aix-la-Chapelle) as its capital. The French modernized public life, for example by introducing the [[Napoleonic code]] and removing the old elites from power. The [[Napoleonic code]] remained in use on the left bank of the Rhine until 1900, when a unified civil code (the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'') was introduced in the [[German Empire]]. In 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]], Cologne was made part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], first in the [[Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|Jülich-Cleves-Berg province]] and then the [[Rhine province]].

The permanent tensions between the Roman Catholic [[Rhineland]] and the overwhelmingly Protestant Prussian state repeatedly escalated with Cologne being in the focus of the conflict. In 1837 the archbishop of Cologne, [[Clemens August von Droste-Vischering]], was arrested and imprisoned for two years after a dispute over the legal status of marriages between Protestants and Roman Catholics (''Mischehenstreit''). In 1874, during the [[Kulturkampf]], Archbishop [[Paul Melchers]] was imprisoned before taking refuge in the Netherlands. These conflicts alienated the Catholic population from Berlin and contributed to a deeply felt anti-Prussian resentment, which was still significant after World War II, when the former mayor of Cologne, [[Konrad Adenauer]], became the first West German chancellor.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Cologne absorbed numerous surrounding towns, and by World War&nbsp;I had already grown to 700,000 inhabitants. Industrialization changed the city and spurred its growth. Vehicle and engine manufacturing were especially successful, though heavy industry was less ubiquitous than in the [[Ruhr area]]. The [[Cologne Cathedral|cathedral]], started in 1248 but abandoned around 1560, was eventually finished in 1880 not just as a place of worship but also as a German national monument celebrating the newly founded [[German empire]] and the continuity of the German nation since the Middle Ages. Some of this urban growth occurred at the expense of the city's historic heritage with much being demolished (for example, the city walls or the area around the cathedral) and sometimes replaced by present-day buildings.

Cologne was designated as one of the [[Fortresses of the German Confederation]].<ref name=USM>[http://books.google.com/books?dq=%22Federal+Fortress+on+the+Upper+Rhine%22&pg=PA254&id=B77POH6Wgk4C United Services Magazine], December 1835</ref> It was turned into a heavily armed fortress (opposing the French and Belgian fortresses of [[Verdun]] and [[Liège (city)|Liège]]) with two fortified belts surrounding the city, the remains of which can be seen to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altearmee.de/zwischenwerk/index.htm |title=Festung Köln |accessdate=April 2011}}</ref> The military demands on what became Germany's largest fortress presented a significant obstacle to urban development, with forts, bunkers, and wide defensive dugouts completely encircling the city and preventing expansion; this resulted in a very dense built-up area within the city itself.

During [[World War&nbsp;I]] Cologne was the target of several but minor air raids and survived the hostilities without significant damage. Until 1926 Cologne was occupied by the [[British Army of the Rhine]] under the terms of the armistice and the subsequent [[Peace Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Peace Treaty]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,721598,00.html Cologne Evacuated], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', February 15, 1926</ref>
Contrary to the harsh measures taken by French occupation troops, the British acted with more tact towards the local population. The mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933 and future West German chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] acknowledged the political impact of this approach, especially that the British had opposed French plans for a permanent Allied occupation of the Rhineland.

As part of the de-militarization of the [[Rhineland]] the fortifications had to be dismantled. This was taken as an opportunity to create two green belts (''Grüngürtel'') around the city by converting the fortifications and their clear fields of fire into large public parks. However, this project was not completed until 1933. In 1919 the [[University of Cologne]], closed by the French in 1798, was refounded. This re-foundation was considered a replacement for the loss of the German [[University of Strasbourg]], which reverted to France with the rest of [[Alsace]]. Cologne prospered during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–33) and progress was made especially with respect to public governance, city planning, housing and social affairs. Social housing projects were considered exemplary and copied by other German cities. As Cologne competed for hosting the Olympics a modern sports stadium was erected at Müngersdorf. When the British occupation ended, the prohibition of civil aviation was removed and [[Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport]] soon became a hub for national and international air traffic—second in Germany only to [[Tempelhof International Airport|Berlin Tempelhof Airport]].

The democratic parties lost the local elections in Cologne in March 1933 to the [[Nazi Party]] and other right wing parties. Thereafter [[KPD|Communist]] as well as [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] members of the city assembly were imprisoned and Mayor Adenauer was dismissed by the new holders of power. However, compared to other major cities, the Nazis never gained decisive support in Cologne (significantly, the number of votes cast for the Nazi Party in [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] elections had always been the national average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080211085633/http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archivedate=2008-02-11 |title=Weimarer Wahlen |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-02-11 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wahlen-in-deutschland.de/wrtwkoelnaachen.htm |title=Voting results 1919-1933 Cologne-Aachen |publisher=Wahlen-in-deutschland.de |date= |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref> By 1939 the population had risen to 772,221 inhabitants.

===World War II===
[[File:Koeln 1945.jpg|thumb|The devastation of Cologne, 1945]]
During World War II, Cologne was a Military Area Command Headquarters (''Militärbereichshauptkommandoquartier'') for the [[Military district (Germany)|Military District]] (''Wehrkreis'') VI of [[Münster]]. Cologne was under the command of Lieutenant-General Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, who was responsible for military operations in [[Bonn]], [[Siegburg]], [[Aachen]], [[Jülich]], [[Düren]], and [[Monschau]]. Cologne was home to the 211th Infantry Regiment and the 26th Artillery Regiment.

During the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II]], Cologne endured 262 air raids<ref>{{cite web|author=koelnarchitektur |url=http://www.koelnarchitektur.de/pages/de/home/news_archiv/823.htm |title=on the reconstruction of Cologne |publisher=Koelnarchitektur.de |date=2003-07-15 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref> by the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], which caused approximately 20,000 civilian casualties and almost completely wiped out the center of the city. During the night of 31 May 1942, Cologne was the target of "[[Operation Millennium]]", the first 1,000 bomber raid by the [[Royal Air Force]] in World War&nbsp;II. 1,046 heavy bombers attacked their target with 1,455 tons of explosives, approximately two-thirds of which were incendiary.<ref>Tourtellot, Arthur B. et al. ''Life's Picture History of World War&nbsp;II'', p. 237. Time Incorporated, New York, 1950.</ref> This raid lasted about 75 minutes, destroyed {{convert|600|acre|ha|0}} of built-up area, killed 486 civilians and made 59,000 people homeless. By the end of the war, the population of Cologne had been reduced by 95 percent. This loss was mainly caused by a massive evacuation of the people to more rural areas. The same happened in many other German cities in the last two years of war. By the end of 1945, however, the population had already recovered to approximately 500,000.

By the end of the war, essentially all of Cologne's pre-war [[Jewish]] population of 11,000 had been deported or killed by the Nazis.<ref>Kirsten Serup-Bilfeld, Zwischen Dom und Davidstern. Jüdisches Leben in Köln von den Anfängen bis heute. Köln 2001, page 193</ref> The six [[synagogue]]s of the city were destroyed. The [[Roonstrasse Synagogue|synagogue on Roonstraße]] was rebuilt in 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgk.de/index.php/historie.html |title=Synagogen-Gemeinde Köln |publisher=Sgk.de |date=1931-06-26 |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref>

===Post-war Cologne until today===
[[File:KölnFromTheISS.jpg|275px|thumb|Cologne, seen from the [[International Space Station]]]]
Despite Cologne's status as the largest city in the region, nearby [[Düsseldorf]] was chosen as the political capital of the [[States of Germany|federated state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. With [[Bonn]] being chosen as the provisional capital (''provisorische Bundeshauptstadt'') and seat of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany (then informally [[West Germany]]), Cologne benefited by being sandwiched between two important political centers. The city became and still is home to a number of federal agencies and organizations. After reunification in 1990, Berlin was made the capital of Germany.

In 1945 architect and urban planner [[Rudolf Schwarz (architect)|Rudolf Schwarz]] called Cologne the "world's greatest heap of rubble". Schwarz designed the master plan of reconstruction in 1947, which called for the construction of several new thoroughfares through the downtown area, especially the ''Nord-Süd-Fahrt'' ("North-South-Drive"). The master plan took into consideration the fact that even shortly after the war a large increase in automobile traffic could be anticipated. Plans for new roads had already, to a certain degree, evolved under the Nazi administration, but the actual construction became easier in times when the majority of downtown lots were undeveloped.

The destruction of 95% of the city center including the famous [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]] like [[St. Gereon's Basilica|St.&nbsp;Gereon]], [[Great St. Martin Church|Great St.&nbsp;Martin]], [[St.&nbsp;Maria im Kapitol]] and several other monuments in World War&nbsp;II meant a tremendous loss of cultural treasures. The rebuilding of those churches and other landmarks like the Gürzenich event hall was not undisputed among leading architects and art historians at that time, but in most cases, civil intention prevailed. The reconstruction lasted until the 1990s, when the Romanesque church of [[St. Kunibert (Cologne)|St.&nbsp;Kunibert]] was finished.

In 1959, the city's population reached pre-war numbers again. It then grew steadily, exceeding 1 million for about one year from 1975. It has remained just below that until mid-2010, when it exceeded 1 million again.

===Post-reunification===
In the 1980s and 1990s Cologne's economy prospered for two main reasons. Firstly, a growth in the number of media companies, both in the private and public sectors; they are especially catered for in the newly developed Media Park, which creates a strongly visual focal point in the Cologne town center and includes the ''KölnTurm'', one of Cologne's most prominent high-rise buildings. Secondly, a permanent improvement of the diverse traffic infrastructure made Cologne one of the most easily accessible metropolitan areas in Central Europe.

Due to the economic success of the [[Cologne Trade Fair]], the city arranged a large extension to the fair site in 2005. At the same time the original buildings, which date back to the 1920s are rented out to [[RTL Group|RTL]], Germany's largest private broadcaster, as their new corporate headquarters.

==Geography==
The metropolitan area encompasses over {{convert|405|km2|0|abbr=off}}, extending around a centerpoint that lies at 50° 56' 33 latitude and 6° 57' 32 longitude.  The city's highest point is {{convert|118|m|1|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (the Monte Troodelöh) and its lowest point is {{convert|37.5|m|1|abbr=on}} above sea level (the [[Worringer Bruch]]).<ref>Bezirksregierung Köln: Topografische Karte 1:50.000 (TK 50), Blatt L 5108 Köln-Mülheim.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Cologne}}
Cologne is the fourth-largest city in Germany in terms of inhabitants after [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Munich]]. As of 30 June 2011, there were officially 1,010,269 residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/a/daten/amtlichebevoelkerungszahlen/index.html |title=Information und Technik Nordrhein-Westfalen (IT.NRW) - Amtliche Bevölkerungszahlen |publisher=It.nrw.de |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> Cologne is the center of the [[Cologne/Bonn Region]] with around 3&nbsp;million inhabitants (including the neighboring cities of [[Bonn]], [[Hürth]], [[Leverkusen]], and [[Bergisch Gladbach]]).

According to local statistics, in 2006, the [[population density]] in the city was 2,528 inhabitants per square kilometre. 31.4 percent of the population has migrated there, and 17.2 percent of Cologne's population is non-German. The largest group, comprising 6.3 percent of the total population, is Turkish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadt-koeln.de/zahlen/bevoelkerung/artikel/04600/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080128135300/http://www.stadt-koeln.de/zahlen/bevoelkerung/artikel/04600/ |archivedate=2008-01-28 |title=2007 - Einwohnerdaten im Überblick - Zahlen + Statistik - Bevölkerung - Stadt Köln |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-01-28 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref> As of September 2007, there are about 120,000 Muslims living in Cologne, mostly of Turkish origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdr.de/studio/koeln/lokalzeit/hintergrund/moschee.jhtml |title=WDR Article of 15.08.2007 |publisher=Wdr.de |date= |accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref> Cologne also has the oldest and one of the largest Jewish communities in Germany.<ref>{{cite news|last=Serup-Bilfeldt|first=Kirsten|title=Cologne: Germany's Oldest Jewish Community|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1684525,00.html|accessdate=6 September 2011|newspaper=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=19 August 2005}}</ref>

==Government==
{{See also|Cologne City Hall}}
The city's administration is headed by the [[List of mayors of Cologne|mayor]] and the three deputy mayors. [[Jürgen Roters]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] has been mayor since 20 October 2009.<ref name=CologneMayor>{{cite web|title=Der Oberbürgermeister|url=http://www.stadt-koeln.de/1/oberbuergermeister/|accessdate=15 April 2011|language=German}}</ref>

===Political traditions and developments===
The long tradition of a free imperial city, which long dominated an exclusively Catholic population and the age-old conflict between the church and the bourgeoisie (and within it between the patricians and craftsmen) has created its own political climate in Cologne. Various interest groups often form the basis of societal socialization and therefore beyond party boundaries. The resulting network of relationships, with political, economic, and cultural links with each other in a system of mutual favors, obligations and dependencies, is called the Cologne coterie. This has often led to an unusual proportional distribution in the city government and degenerated at times into corruption: in 1999, a "waste scandal" over kickbacks and illegal campaign contributions came to light, which led not only to the imprisonment of the entrepreneur Hellmut Trienekens, but also to the downfall of almost the entire leadership staff of the ruling Social Democrats.

===Mayor===
The Lord Mayor of Cologne is [[Jürgen Roters]] of the Social Democratic Party. As the joint candidate of the SPD and the Greens, he received 54.67% of the vote on 30 August 2009 at the municipal election. He has been Lord Mayor since 21 October 2009.

===Elections===
City Councillors are elected for a five-year term and the Mayor has a six-year term.<ref name="Election 1">{{cite web|title=Wahlperiode|url=http://www.stadt-koeln.de/1/wahlen/abisz/03612/|publisher=City of Cologne|accessdate=15 April 2011|publisher=City of Cologne|language=German}}</ref>

The inner city of Cologne was completely destroyed during World War&nbsp;II. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. Thus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the "Wiederaufbauzeit" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house by [[Wilhelm Riphahn]], are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Nevertheless, the uncompromising style of the [[Cologne Opera]] house and other modern buildings has remained controversial.

Green areas account for over a quarter of Cologne which is approximately {{convert|75|m²|2|abbr=on}} of public green space for every citizen of the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green Cologne|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/exploring_city/green_cologne|publisher=KölnTourismus|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref>

==Wildlife==
The presence of animals in Cologne is generally limited to insects, small rodents, and several species of birds. [[Pigeon]]s are the most often seen animals in Cologne, although the number of birds are augmented each year by a growing population of [[Feral organism|feral]] exotics, most visibly [[parrots]] such as the [[rose-ringed Parakeet]]. The sheltered climate in southeast [[Westphalia]] allows these birds to survive through the winter, and in some cases they are displacing native species. The plumage of Cologne's green [[parrots]] is highly visible even from a distance, and contrasts starkly with the otherwise muted colors of the cityscape.<ref>{{cite web|title=In NRW behaupten sich immer mehr exotische Vögel|url=http://www.rp-online.de/wissen/leben/in-nrw-behaupten-sich-immer-mehr-exotische-voegel-1.2313710|publisher=RP Online|accessdate=16 January 2013}}</ref>

==Tourism==
Cologne had 4.31 million overnight stays booked and 2.38 million arrivals in 2008.<ref name="Cologneglance"/>  The city also has the most pubs per capita in [[Germany]].<ref name="Nightlife">{{cite web|title=Nightlife|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/nightlife|publisher=KölnTourismus|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> The city has 70 clubs, "countless" bars, restaurants, and pubs.<ref name="Nightlife"/>

===Landmarks===

====Churches====
* [[Cologne Cathedral]] (German: ''Kölner Dom'') is the city's most famous monument and the Cologne residents' most respected landmark. It is a [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Church (building)|church]], started in 1248, and completed in 1880. In 1996, it was designated a [[World Heritage site]]; it houses the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]], which supposedly contains the [[relic]]s of the [[Biblical Magi|Three Magi]] (see also<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koelner-dom.de/index.php?id=dreikoenigenschrein |title=Offizielle Webseite des Kölner Doms &#124; Bedeutende Werke |publisher=Koelner-dom.de |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref>). Residents of Cologne sometimes refer to the cathedral as "the eternal construction site" (''die ewige Baustelle'').
* [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]]: These buildings are outstanding examples of medieval church architecture. The origins of some of the churches go back as far as Roman times, for example St.&nbsp;Gereon, which was originally a chapel in a Roman graveyard. With the exception of St. Maria Lyskirchen all of these churches were very badly damaged during World War&nbsp;II. Reconstruction was only finished in the 1990s.

====Medieval houses====
The Cologne City Hall (''Kölner Rathaus''), founded in the 12th century, is the oldest [[city hall]] in Germany still in use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cologne.strategicmanagement.net/tuesday.php |title=Strategic Management Society - Cologne Conference - Cologne Information |publisher=Cologne.strategicmanagement.net |date=2008-10-14 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref> The Renaissance style loggia and tower were added in the 15th century. Other famous buildings include the Gürzenich, Haus Saaleck and the Overstolzenhaus.

===Streets===
{{Main|Streets in Cologne}}
* The [[Cologne Ring]] boulevards (such as ''Hohenzollernring'', ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ring'', ''Hansaring'') with their medieval city gates (such as ''Hahnentorburg'' on ''Rudolfplatz'') are also known for their night life.
* [[Hohe Straße]] (literally: ''High Street'') is one of the main shopping areas and extends past the cathedral in an approximately southerly direction. The street contains many gift shops, clothing stores, fast food restaurants and electronic goods dealers.
* [[Schildergasse]] – connects the ''Neumarkt'' plaza on its west end to the southern end of the ''Hohe Strasse'' shopping street at its east end and has been named the busiest shopping street in Europe with 13,000 people passing through every hour.
* Ehrenstraße – the shopping area around ''Apostelnstrasse'', ''Ehrenstrasse'', and ''Rudolfplatz'' is a little more on the eccentric and stylish side.

===Bridges===
Several bridges cross the Rhine in Cologne. They are (from South to North): the [[Cologne Rodenkirchen Bridge]], [[South Bridge (Cologne)|South Bridge]] (railway), Severin Bridge, Deutz Bridge, [[Hohenzollern Bridge]], Zoo Bridge (''Zoobrücke'') and [[Cologne Mülheim Bridge]]. In particular the iron [[tied arch bridge|tied arch]] Hohenzollern Bridge (''Hohenzollernbrücke'') is a dominant landmark along the river embankment. A Rhine river crossing of a special kind is provided by the [[Cologne Cable Car]] (German: ''Kölner Seilbahn''), a cableway that runs across the Rhine between the [[Cologne Zoological Garden]] in Riehl and the [[Rheinpark]] in Deutz.

===High-rise structures===
Cologne's tallest structure is the [[Colonius]] telecommunication tower at {{convert|266|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}. The observation deck has been closed since 1992. A selection of the tallest buildings in Cologne are listed below. Other tall structures include the Hansahochhaus (designed by architect Jacob Koerfer and completed in 1925—it was at one time Europe's tallest office building), the Kranhaus buildings at [[Rheinauhafen]], and the [[Messeturm Köln]] ("trade fair tower").

==Culture==
[[File:Kolumba Köln - Innenhof.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of the [[Kolumba]] museum in 2007, designed by [[Peter Zumthor]]]]
Cologne has [[List of museums in Cologne|several museums]]. The famous [[Roman-Germanic Museum]] features art and architecture from the city's distant past; the [[Museum Ludwig]] houses one of the most important collections of [[modern art]] in Europe, including a [[Picasso]] collection matched only by the museums in [[Museu Picasso|Barcelona]] and [[Musée Picasso|Paris]]. The [[Museum Schnütgen]] of religious art is partly housed in St.&nbsp;Cecilia, one of Cologne's [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]].

Several [[orchestras]] are active in the city, among them the [[Gürzenich Orchestra]] and the [[WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne]], both based at the Cologne Philharmonic Orchestra Building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koelner-philharmonie.de/en/00_home/00_home.php?Style=eb281b060898acfab42beae0870f44f6  |title=Kölner Philharmonie |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-12-11 |accessdate=2010-08-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071211142559/http://www.koelner-philharmonie.de/en/00_home/00_home.php?Style=eb281b060898acfab42beae0870f44f6 |archivedate = 2007-12-11}}</ref> Other orchestras are the [[Musica Antiqua Köln]] and the [[WDR Rundfunkorchester Köln]], as well as the [[Cologne Opera]] and several choirs, including the [[WDR Rundfunkchor Köln]]. Cologne was also an important center of electronic music in the 1950s (Studio für elektronische Musik, [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]) and again from the 1990s onward. The public radio and TV station [[WDR]] was involved in promoting musical movements such as [[Krautrock]] in the 1970s; the influential [[Can (band)|Can]] was formed there in 1968. There are several centers of nightlife, among them the ''Kwartier Latäng'' (the student quarter around the Zülpicher Straße) and the nightclub-studded areas around [[Hohenzollernring]], Friesenplatz and Rudolfplatz.

The large annual literary festival Lit.Cologne features regional and international authors. The main literary figure connected with Cologne is writer [[Heinrich Böll]], winner of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].

Cologne is well known for its beer, called [[Kölsch (beer)|Kölsch]]. [[Kölsch dialect|Kölsch]] is also the name of the local dialect. This has led to the common joke of Kölsch being the only language one can drink.

Cologne is also famous for [[Eau de Cologne]] (German: ''Kölnisch Wasser''; lit: "Water of Cologne"), a perfume created by Italian expatriate [[Johann Maria Farina]] at the beginning of the 18th century. During the 18th century this perfume became increasingly popular, was exported all over Europe by the Farina family and ''Farina'' became a household name for ''Eau de Cologne''. In 1803 Wilhelm Mülhens entered into a contract with an unrelated person from Italy named Carlo Francesco Farina who granted him the right to use his family name and Mühlens opened a small factory at Cologne's Glockengasse. In later years and after various court battles his grandson [[Ferdinand Mülhens]] had to abandon the name ''Farina'' for the company and their product. He decided to use the house number given to the factory at Glockengasse during French occupation in the early 19th century, [[4711 (brand)|4711]]. Today, original Eau de Cologne is still produced in Cologne by both the [[Johann Maria Farina gegenüber dem Jülichs-Platz|Farina family]], currently in the eighth generation, and by [[Mäurer & Wirtz]] who bought the 4711 brand in 2006.

===Carnival===
The [[Cologne carnival]] is one of the biggest street festivals in Europe. In Cologne, the carnival season officially starts on 11 November at 11 minutes past 11 a.m. with the proclamation of the new Carnival Season, and continues until [[Ash Wednesday]]. However, the so-called "Tolle Tage" (crazy days) don't start until ''Weiberfastnacht'' (Women's Carnival) or, in dialect, ''Wieverfastelovend'' (the Thursday before Ash Wednesday), which is the beginning of the street carnival. Zülpicher Strasse and its surroundings, Neumarkt square, Heumarkt and all bars and pubs in the city are crowded with people in costumes dancing and drinking in the streets. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Cologne during this time. Generally, around a million people celebrate in the streets on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadt-koeln.de/en/koelntourismus/karneval/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080125230206/http://www.stadt-koeln.de/en/koelntourismus/karneval/ |archivedate=2008-01-25 |title=Carnival - Cologne's "fifth season" - Cologne Sights & Events - Stadt Köln |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-01-26 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref>

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Cologne}}

===Road transport===
[[File:Koelner Ring.png|thumb|left|Major [[List of streets in Cologne|roads through and around Cologne]].]]
Road building had been a major issue in the 1920s under the leadership of mayor [[Konrad Adenauer]]. The first German limited access road was constructed after 1929 between Cologne and [[Bonn]]. Today, this is the [[Bundesautobahn 555]]. In 1965, Cologne became the first German city to be fully encircled by a [[freeway]] [[beltway|belt]]. Roughly at the same time a downtown bypass freeway (''Stadtautobahn'') was planned, but only partially put into effect, due to opposition by environmental groups. The completed section became ''Bundesstraße ("Federal Road") B 55a'' which begins at the ''Zoobrücke'' ("Zoo Bridge") and meets with [[Bundesautobahn 4|A&nbsp;4]] and [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] at the interchange Cologne East. Nevertheless, it is referred to as ''Stadtautobahn'' by most locals. In contrast to this the ''Nord-Süd-Fahrt'' ("North-South-Drive") was actually completed, a new four/six-lane downtown thoroughfare, which had already been anticipated by planners like [[Fritz Schumacher (architect)|Fritz Schumacher]] in the 1920s. The last section south of ''Ebertplatz'' was completed in 1972.

In 2005, the first stretch of an eight-lane freeway in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] was opened to traffic on [[Bundesautobahn&nbsp;3]], part of the eastern section of the [[Cologne Beltway]] between the interchanges Cologne East and Heumar.

===Cycling===

[[File:Rheinexpressinkoelnhbf.jpg|thumb|right|Train at [[Köln Hauptbahnhof|Köln Hbf (Cologne Central Station)]]]]

Like most German cities, Cologne has a traffic layout designed to be [[bicycle-friendly]]. There is an extensive cycle network, featuring pavement-edge cycle lanes linked by cycle priority crossings. In some of the narrow one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways.

===Rail transport===
Cologne has a railway service with [[Deutsche Bahn]] [[InterCity|Intercity]] and [[InterCityExpress|ICE]]-trains stopping at ''[[Köln Hauptbahnhof]]'' (Cologne Central Station), ''[[Köln Messe/Deutz station|Köln Messe/Deutz]]'' and ''[[Cologne/Bonn Airport station|Cologne/Bonn Airport]]''. ICE and [[Thalys|TGV Thalys]] high-speed trains link Cologne with [[Amsterdam]], [[Brussels]] (in 1h47, 6 departures/day) and Paris (in 3h14, 6 departures/day). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including [[Frankfurt am Main]] and Berlin. ICE Trains to [[London]] via the [[Channel Tunnel]] are planned for 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/travel/travel-news/highspeed-trains-to-link-england-and-germany-20111013-1lmq8.html |title=High-speed trains to link England and Germany |publisher=Brisbanetimes.com.au |date=2011-10-16 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref>

The [[Cologne Stadtbahn|Cologne city railway]] operated by [[Kölner Verkehrs-Betriebe|Kölner Verkehrsbetriebe]] (KVB)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kvb-koeln.de/ |title=Kölner Verkehrsbetriebe (KVB) |publisher=Kvb-koeln.de |date= |accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref> is an [[List of Cologne KVB stations|extensive]] [[light rail]] system that is partially underground (referred to as [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]) and serves Cologne and a number of neighboring cities. Nearby [[Bonn]] is linked by both the city railway and Deutsche Bahn trains, and occasional recreational boats on the [[Rhine]]. [[Düsseldorf]] is also linked by [[S-Bahn]] trains which are operated by Deutsche Bahn.

There are also frequent buses covering most of the city and surrounding suburbs, and [[Eurolines]] coaches to London via [[Brussels]].

===Water transport===
''[[Häfen und Güterverkehr Köln]]'' (Cologne Ports and Railways) (HGK) is one of the largest operators for [[inland port]]s in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hgk.de/neu/english/contents/HGK_ports_cargo-handling-points.html |title=Häfen und Güterverkehr Köln AG |publisher=Hgk.de |date= |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref> [[Port]]s include Köln-Deutz, Köln-Godorf, and Köln-Niehl&nbsp;I and II. [[Köln-Düsseldorfer]] offers Rhine [[river cruise]]s along the entire Rhine.

===Air transport===
Cologne's international airport is [[Cologne Bonn Airport|Cologne/Bonn Airport]] (CGN). It is also called Konrad Adenauer Airport after Germany's first post-war Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], who was born in the city and was [[mayor of Cologne]] from 1917 until 1933. The airport is shared with the neighbouring city of [[Bonn]]. Cologne is headquarters to the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA). The airport is also the main hub of the airline [[Germanwings]].
