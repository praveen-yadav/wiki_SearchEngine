The '''[[Cameroon]]ian Armed Forces''' generally has been an apolitical force where [[civilian control of the military]] predominates.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Traditional dependence on the French defense capability, although reduced, continues to be the case as French military advisers remain closely involved in preparing the Cameroonian forces for deployment to the contested [[Bakassi Peninsula]]. The armed forces number 38,000-40,000 personnel in ground, air, and naval forces.

The Cameroonian armed forces have bases spread all over Cameroon, including in [[Ngaoundéré]]. Air Force bases are located in [[Garoua]], [[Yaoundé]], [[Douala]] and [[Bamenda]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

"China has an ongoing military-military relationship with Cameroon, which includes training for Cameroonian military students each year in China, technical advisors to assist in repairing Cameroonian military vehicles and naval vessels, and Chinese military sales."<ref>[[Wikileaks]] [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] 10YAOUNDE95</ref>

==Army ==
With 20,000 men (including a rate of feminization of nearly 10%) the Army remains the most important component in terms of numbers.<ref>http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/actions-france_830/defense-securite_9035/cooperation-securite-defense_9037/revue-freres-armes_12582/freres-armes-258-dossier-cameroun_18857/dossier_19041/armee-terre_64741.html</ref> The Army is under the responsibility of the Chief of Staff, [[Général de division]] Nkoa Atenga, whose staff is in [[Yaoundé]].

Currently the organization dates from 2001 with a distribution in several types of units: combat units, response units (unités d'intervention), unités de soutien et d'appui et finally special reserve units as part of 3 joint military régions (''interarmees'') and the 10 military land sectors.<ref>Source: Revue Freres Armees, French Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ref>

Army units have been trained and equipped to fight in the swampy coastal terrain facing the [[Bakassi peninsula]]. Although prepared for an armed conflict with Nigeria in recent years, the Cameroon Army does not have operational experience against other forces, therefore, it is not possible to assess its ability to respond to changing threats and opposing tactics.

Combat units of the army include:<ref>Niagalé Bagayoko, [http://www.africansecuritynetwork.org/site/components/com_medialibrary/emedia/Cameroons%20Security%20Apparatus%20Actors%20and%20Structures.pdf CAmeroon's Security Apparatus: Actors and Structures], 21.</ref>
* "The General Headquarter Brigade, located in Yaoundé. This brigade is responsible for protecting the capital and supporting the institutions. The President of the Republic has to allow any of its deployments."
* "Three command and support battalions;"
* "The Rapid Intervention Brigade, (which currently has no general staff) and is made up of three rapid intervention battalions, stationed in Doula, Tiko and Koutaba. These three battalions are respectively the Bataillon Special Amphibie (BSA), the Bataillon des Troupes Aeroportees (BTAP) and the Bataillon Blinde de Reconnaissance (BBR). The BSA is inspired by the French Special Forces. This brigade is a tactical battle unit under the authority of the Chief of Staff of the armed forces. For this to be engaged, the President’s agreement is necessary. Amongst its three battalions, only the BTAP is operational;"
* "Five motorised infantry brigades, supposed to be stationed in one military sector but which can then be engaged without any regard to the territorial division of the country. These brigades currently do not have a general staff. In theory, they consist of 11 motorised infantry battalions; 5 support battalions and 3 backing battalions; however, the motorised battalions are in reality not operational due to a lack of staff, equipment and vehicles."
* "Three rapid intervention battalions, the so-called BIR."

==Cameroonian Air Force==

The air force has bases in [[Garoua]], [[Koutaba]], [[Yaoundé]], [[Douala]] and [[Bamenda]]. The Cameroonian Air Force was founded in 1960 the year of independence from France.There are around 600 troops in the air force.

==Cameroonian Navy==

There are about 1,100 troops in the navy including naval infantry.

Around May 1999, [[Philip Njaru]] wrote a newspaper article where he alleged ill-treatment of civilians conducted by the 11th Navy Battalion based in Ekondo-Titi. In late May Njaru was approached by the local [[captain (Navy)|captain]] who asked Njaru "to stop writing such articles and to disclose his sources". Refusing to do this, Njaru five days later found his house encircled by armed soldiers, and escaped to [[Kumba]].<ref name="UN">{{cite web |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/40142/Njaru-v-Cameroon-HRC-Decision |title=Njaru v Cameroon HRC Decision |accessdate=2008-09-14 |work= |publisher=hosted by Scribd |date=3 April 2007 }}</ref> Here, he was assaulted by police in June 2001, with no particular reason stated.<ref name="UN"/> Njaru complained to the local authorities, but later learned that "his complaint had not been received".<ref name="UN"/>

Cameroon's Marine Nationale République modernised and increased its capabilities during 2000 with the acquisition of a number of small Rodman patrol craft and the retirement of some small older craft. A number of small patrol boats have been acquired or ordered from France. Latest estimates indicate naval strength consists of two combat patrol vessels, three coastal patrol vessels and approximately 30 smaller inshore and river patrol craft allocated to both the navy and the local gendarmerie. These include two 135 tonne Yunnan-class landing craft, which are able to carry and launch smaller craft for troop insertions. Some effort has been made to assess equipment needs to bring L'Audacieux P103 and Bakassi P104 to an effective combat status. This has resulted in weapons capabilities being reduced in favour of an increase in serviceability and the service is now effectively without missile attack capabilities. Bakassi (a Type P 48S missile patrol craft) completed a major refit at Lorient, France in August 1999. This included removing the Exocet missile system and EW equipment, and fitting a funnel aft of the mainmast to replace the waterline exhausts. New radars were also installed. Bakassi is now armed only with 40&nbsp;mm cannon. Although the Bizerte (P48 large patrol craft) class L'Audacieux is fitted for SS-12M missiles these are not embarked and its operational status is in some doubt, having not been reported at sea since 1995. The Quartier-Maître Alfred Moto patrol boat was listed as out of service in 1991 but has since been reactivated.
