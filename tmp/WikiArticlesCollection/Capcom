==History==
The original companies that spawned Capcom's Japanese branch were I.R.M Corporation founded on May 30, 1979,<ref name="ign25th">{{cite web |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/881/881137p1.html |title=Capcom Marks 25th Anniversary |author=Ocampo, Jason |date=June 11, 2008 |work=[[IGN.com]] |publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc |accessdate=July 21, 2010}}</ref> as well as its subsidiary Japan Capsule Computers Co., Ltd., both of which were devoted to the manufacturing and distribution of electronic game machines.<ref name="history" /> The two companies underwent a name change to Sambi Co., Ltd. in September 1981,<ref name="history" /> while Capcom Co., Ltd. itself was first established on June 11, 1983,<ref name="ign25th" /> for the purpose of taking over the internal sales department.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/company/history.html |title=会社情報 カプコンの歴史 |language=Japanese |date=September 30, 2009 |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=July 21, 2010}}</ref>

In January 1989, the old affiliate company Capcom Co., Ltd. merged with Sambi Co., Ltd., resulting in the current Japanese branch.<ref name="history" /> The name Capcom is a [[portmanteau]] of "Capsule Computers", a term coined by the company to describe the [[Video game arcade cabinet|arcade machines]] it solely manufactured in its early years, designed to set themselves apart from [[personal computer]]s that were becoming widespread at that time.<ref name="name">{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/company/name.html |title=会社情報 社名の由来 |language=Japanese |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=July 22, 2010}}</ref> The word capsule alludes to how Capcom likened its game software to "a capsule packed to the brim with gaming fun", as well as to the company's desire to protect its intellectual property with a hard outer shell, preventing illegal copies and inferior imitations.<ref name="name" />

While Capcom's first product was the coin-operated ''Little League'' from July 1983, its first real video game, the [[Arcade game|arcade title]] ''[[Vulgus]]'', was released in May 1984.<ref name="history" /> Beginning with a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] port of ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]'' published in December 1985, the company started to venture into the market of [[home console]] video games,<ref name="history" /> which became its main business segment a few years later.<ref name="businesssegments" /> Since then, Capcom created 15 multi-million-selling game series, the most successful of which is ''[[Resident Evil]]''.<ref name="salesdata">{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/salesdata.html |title=Business Strategies & IR Data: Total Sales Units Data |date=March 31, 2010 |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=July 21, 2010}}</ref>

In 1994, Capcom adapted its ''Street Fighter'' series of fighting games into [[Street Fighter (film)|a film of the same name]]. While commercially successful, the production received almost universal criticism. [[Resident Evil (film)|A 2002 adaptation of its ''Resident Evil'']] series faced similar criticism but was also successful in theaters. The company sees films as a way to build sales for its video games.<ref name="Gaudiosi">Gaudiosi, John. "Capcom Seeks More Playtime in HWood." Hollywood Reporter 397 (2006): 4,4,29.

==Corporate structure==

===Development studios===
In the first few years after its establishment, the Japanese branch of Capcom had three development groups referred to as "Planning Rooms", led by [[Tokuro Fujiwara]], Takashi Nishiyama and [[Yoshiki Okamoto]], respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Gameside |title=ゲーム業界を"爆発"させた"ストライダー"の父 「四井浩一」 　ディスコグラフィー |date=February 2009 |issue=16 |language=Japanese |publisher=Micro Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game |title=[[Strider (arcade game)|Strider Hiryū]] |developer=Capcom Co., Ltd |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd. |date=March 7, 1989 |scene=staff credits}}</ref> Later, games developed internally used to be created by several numbered "Production Studios", each assigned to different games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/775/775450p1.html |title=The Future of PSP – Capcom |author=Nix, Marc |date=March 23, 2007 |work=[[IGN.com]] |publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc |accessdate=May 11, 2011}}</ref><ref name="annualreport2009" /> Starting in 2002, the development process was reformed to better share technologies and expertise, and all of the individual studios were gradually restructured into bigger departments responsible for different tasks.<ref name="annualreport2009" /> While there are self-contained departments for the creation of arcade, pachinko and pachislo, online, and mobile games, the Consumer Games R&D Division instead is an amalgamation of subsections in charge of various game development stages.<ref name="annualreport2009" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/interview/2008/ |title=Developer Interview 2008 |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=July 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name="annualreport2007">{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/2007annual/Annual2007e.pdf |title=Annual Report 2007 |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=July 22, 2010}}</ref>

In addition to these internal teams, Capcom also commissions outside development studios to ensure a steady output of titles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20100407010514/http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/interview/2009/vol08/index.html |title=Developer Interview 2009: vol08.Keiji Inafune |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=November 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/interview/2010/vol01/03.html |title=Developer Interview 2010: vol01.Jun Takeuchi |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=November 6, 2010}}</ref> However, following poor sales of ''[[Dark Void]]'' and ''[[Bionic Commando (2009 video game)|Bionic Commando]]'', the company's management has decided to limit outsourcing to sequels and newer versions of installments in existing franchises, reserving the development of original titles for its in-house teams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5540859/bionic-commando-dark-void-last-straws-for-capcom |title=Bionic Commando, Dark Void Last Straws For Capcom |author=Orsini, Lauren |date=May 17, 2010 |work=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=November 6, 2010}}</ref> The production of games, budgets, and platforms supported are decided upon in development approval meetings, attended by the company management and the marketing, sales, and quality control departments.<ref name="annualreport2009" />

==Games==
{{main|List of Capcom games}}

Capcom launched its ''[[Street Fighter]]'' franchise in 1987. The series of [[fighting game]]s are among the most popular in their genre, and have sold over 30 million units. That same year, 1987, the company introduced its ''[[Mega Man]]'' series. Selling nearly 30 million units, the series serves as Capcom's flagship franchise.

The company developed the inaugural entry in its ''[[Resident Evil]]'' survival horror series in 1996. The series has achieved enormous success, selling nearly 50 million units. Following work on the second entry in the ''Resident Evil'' series, Capcom began work on a ''Resident Evil'' game for the new [[PlayStation 2]]. Radically different from the existing series, Capcom decided to spin off the game into its own series, ''[[Devil May Cry]]''. While it released the first two entries exclusively for the PS2 the company brought further entries to non-[[Sony]] consoles. The series as a whole has seen sales in excess of 10 million units. Capcom also initiated its ''[[Monster Hunter]]'' series in 2004. The games have seen sales of over 20 million units on a variety of consoles.

While often criticized for its reliance on existing franchises, the company developed several titles for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] based on original intellectual property: ''[[Lost Planet: Extreme Condition|Lost Planet]]'' and ''[[Dead Rising]]''.<ref name="New Blood">"Lost Planet & Dead Rising; Capcom Brings New Blood to Xbox 360." EGM [i] 2006: 1-41. ProQuest Research Library. Web. 30 May 2012.</ref> Each title has since spawned at least one sequel. Also of note are the titles ''Okami'' and ''Okamiden''.

==Controversies==
In recent years, Capcom has been criticized for controversial sales tactics, such as having to pay for additional content which is already available within the game's files, most notably in ''[[Street Fighter X Tekken]]''. Capcom has defended the practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamespot.com/news/capcom-defends-on-disc-dlc-report-6369371|title=Capcom defends on-disc DLC - Report|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|date=2012-04-02}}</ref> The company has also been criticized for other questionable business decisions, such as not releasing certain games outside of Japan, abruptly cancelling anticipated projects, and shutting down [[Clover Studio]].<ref>ScrewAttack, [http://www.gametrailers.com/videos/jjgeac/screwattack-s-top-ten-top-10-capcom-mistakes Top 10 Capcom Mistakes], GameTrailers.com, 09/05/2012.</ref>
