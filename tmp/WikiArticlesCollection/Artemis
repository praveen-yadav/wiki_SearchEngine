'''Artemis''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|t|ɨ|m|ɨ|s}} was one of the most widely venerated of the Ancient Greek deities.

In the classical period of [[Greek mythology]], Artemis ({{lang-grc|Ἄρτεμις}}) was often described as the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin sister of [[Apollo]]. She was the Hellenic goddess of the [[Hunting|hunt]], [[Wildlife|wild animals]], [[wilderness]], [[childbirth]], [[virginity]] and protector of young girls, bringing and relieving disease in women; she often was depicted as a huntress carrying a bow and arrows.<ref name="Hammond">“Her proper sphere is the earth, and specifically the uncultivated parts, forests and hills, where wild beasts are plentiful" Hammond and Scullard (editors), ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary''. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1970) 126.</ref> The [[deer]] and the [[Cupressus|cypress]] were sacred to her. In later Hellenistic times, she even assumed the ancient role of [[Eileithyia]] in aiding childbirth.

==Etymology==
[[File:Didrachme de Ionie.jpg|thumb|Didrachm from [[Ephesus]], [[Ionia]], representing the goddess Artemis]]
The name Artemis ([[Proper noun|''noun'']], [[Gender (linguistics)|''feminine'']]) is of unknown or uncertain origin and etymology<ref>{{cite web|title=Artemis|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Artemis&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}</ref><ref name="Babiniotis"/> although various ones have been proposed.<ref name="Andrew Lang"/><ref name="Charles Anthon"/> 
For example according to [[Johann Theodor Jablonski|Jablonski]],<ref name="Charles Anthon"/> the name is also [[Phrygia]]n and could be "compared with the royal appellation ''Artemas'' of [[Xenophon]]. According to [[Charles Anthon]] the primitive root of the name is probably of Persian origin from arta*, art*, arte*,.. all meaning great, excellent, holy,.. thus Artemis "becomes identical with the great mother of Nature, even as she was worshipped at Ephesus".<ref name="Charles Anthon">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Anthon |first=Charles |author= |authorlink=Charles Anthon |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia= A Classical dictionary |title=Artemis |url=http://books.google.gr/books?id=TIYMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA210#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate= |edition= |date= |year=1855 |month= |publisher=Harper & Brothers|volume= |location=New York |id= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |pages=210 |quote= }}</ref> Anton Goebel "suggests the root στρατ or ῥατ, "to shake," and makes Artemis mean the thrower of the dart or the shooter".<ref name="Andrew Lang"/> [[Georgios Babiniotis|Babiniotis]] while accepting that the etymology is unknown, states that the name is already attested in [[Mycenean Greek]] and is possibly of [[Pre-Greek substrate|pre-Hellenic]] origin.<ref name="Babiniotis">{{cite book|title=[[Dictionary of Modern Greek|Λεξικό της Νέας Ελληνικής Γλώσσας]]|first=Georgios|last=Babiniotis|authorlink=Georgios Babiniotis|location=Athens|year=2005|publisher=Κέντρο Λεξικολογίας|chapter=Άρτεμις|page=286}}</ref><br>
The name could also be possibly related to [[Greek language|Greek]] ''árktos'' ‘[[bear]]’ (from [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] *''h₂ŕ̥tḱos''), supported by the bear cult that the goddess had in [[Attica]] ([[Brauronia#Cult of Artemis Brauronia|Brauronia]]) and the [[Neolithic]] remains at the [[Arkoudiotissa Cave]], as well as the story about [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], which was originally about Artemis ([[Arcadia]]n epithet ''kallisto'');<ref>Michaël Ripinsky-Naxon, ''The Nature of Shamanism: Substance and Function of a Religious Metaphor'' (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1993), 32.</ref> this cult was a survival of very old totemic and shamanistic rituals and formed part of a larger [[bear worship|bear cult]] found further afield in other [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] cultures (e.g., Gaulish [[Artio]]).

===Birth===
[[File:Artemis Apollo Louvre Myr199.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Artemis'' (on the left, with a deer) and ''Apollo'' (on the right, holding a lyre) from [[Myrina, Greece|Myrina]], dating to approximately 25 BC]]
[[File:Apollo Artemis Brygos Louvre G151.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Apollo (left) and Artemis''. [[Brygos]] (potter, signed), [[Briseis Painter]], Tondo of an Attic red-figure cup, ca. 470 BC, [[Louvre]].]]

Various conflicting accounts are given in Classical Greek mythology of the birth of Artemis and her twin brother, Apollo. All accounts agree, however, that she was the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]] and that she was the twin sister of Apollo.

An account by [[Callimachus]] has it that Hera forbade Leto to give birth on either terra firma (the mainland) or on an island. Hera was angry with Zeus, her husband, because he had impregnated Leto. But the island of [[Delos]] (or [[Ortygia]] in the [[Homeric Hymn|Homeric Hymn to Artemis]]) disobeyed Hera, and Leto gave birth there.<ref>Hammond. ''Oxford Classical Dictionary.'' 597-598.</ref>

In ancient Cretan history Leto was worshipped at [[Phaistos]] and in Cretan mythology Leto gave birth to Apollo and Artemis at the islands known today as the [[Paximadia (islands)|Paximadia]].

A ''[[scholium]]'' of [[Servius]] on ''[[Aeneid]]'' iii. 72 accounts for the island's archaic name Ortygia<ref>Or as a separate island birthplace of Artemis— "Rejoice, blessed Leto, for you bare glorious children, the lord Apollon and Artemis who delights in arrows; her in Ortygia, and him in rocky Delos," says the [[Homeric Hymn]]; the etymology ''Ortygia'', "Isle of Quail", is not supported by modern scholars.</ref> by asserting that Zeus transformed Leto into a [[quail]] (''ortux'') in order to prevent Hera from finding out his infidelity, and Kenneth McLeish suggested further that in quail form Leto would have given birth with as few birth-pains as a mother quail suffers when it lays an egg.<ref>Kenneth McLeish, ''Children of the Gods'' pp 33f; Leto's birth-pangs, however, are graphically depicted by ancient sources.</ref>

The myths also differ as to whether Artemis was born first, or Apollo. Most stories depict Artemis as born first, becoming her mother's mid-wife upon the birth of her brother Apollo.

===Childhood===
[[File:Artemis Kephisodotos Musei Capitolini MC1123.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman marble ''Bust of Artemis'' after [[Cephisodotus the Elder|Kephisodotos]] ([[Musei Capitolini]]), Rome.]]
The childhood of Artemis is not fully related in any surviving myth. The ''[[Iliad]]'' reduced the figure of the dread goddess to that of a girl, who, having been thrashed by [[Hera]], climbs weeping into the lap of Zeus.<ref>''Iliad'' xxi.505-13;</ref> A poem of [[Callimachus]] to the goddess "who amuses herself on mountains with archery" imagines some charming vignettes:  according to Callimachus, at three years old, Artemis, while sitting on the knee of her father, Zeus, asked him to grant her six wishes: to remain always a virgin; to have many names to set her apart from her brother [[Apollo]]; to be the '''Phaesporia''' or Light Bringer; to have a bow and arrow and a knee-length tunic so that she could hunt; to have sixty "daughters of [[Okeanos]]", all nine years of age, to be her choir; and for twenty Amnisides Nymphs as handmaidens to watch her dogs and bow while she rested. She wished for no city dedicated to her, but to rule the mountains, and for the ability to help women in the pains of childbirth.<ref>[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisMyths.html#Childhood Hymn Around Artemis' Childhood]</ref>

Artemis believed that she had been chosen by [[Moirai|the Fates]] to be a midwife, particularly since she had assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin brother, Apollo.<ref>[http://www.katinkahesselink.net/other/artemis.html On-line English translation].</ref> All of her companions remained virgins, and Artemis closely guarded her own chastity. Her symbols included the golden bow and arrow, the hunting dog, the stag, and the moon. Callimachus tells<ref name="ReferenceA">Callimachus, Hymn III to Artemis 46</ref> how Artemis spent her girlhood seeking out the things that she would need to be a huntress,  how she obtained her bow and arrows from the isle of [[Lipari|Lipara]], where [[Hephaestus]] and the [[Cyclops]] worked.

Okeanus' daughters were filled with fear, but the young Artemis bravely approached and asked for bow and arrows. Callimachus then tells how Artemis visited [[Pan (god)|Pan]], the god of the forest, who gave her seven bitches and six dogs. She then captured six golden-horned deer to pull her chariot. Artemis practiced with her bow first by shooting at trees and then at wild beasts.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Intimacy===
As a virgin, Artemis had interested many gods and men, but only her hunting companion, Orion, won her heart.  Orion was accidentally killed either by Artemis or by Gaia.

[[Alpheus (mythology)|Alpheus]], a river god, was in love with Artemis, but he realizes that he can do nothing to win her heart. So he decides to capture her. Artemis, who is with her companions at Letrenoi, goes to Alpheus, but, suspicious of his motives, she covers her face with mud so that the river god does not recognize her. In another story, Alphaeus tries to rape Artemis' attendant [[Arethusa (mythology)|Arethusa]]. Artemis pities Arethusa and saves her by transforming Arethusa into a spring in Artemis' temple, [[Artemis Alphaea]] in Letrini, where the goddess and her attendant drink.

Bouphagos, the son of the Titan Iapetos, sees Artemis and thinks about raping her. Reading his sinful thoughts, Artemis strikes him at Mount Pholoe.

Sipriotes is a boy, who, either because he accidentally sees Artemis bathing or because he attempts to rape her, is turned into a girl by the goddess.

===Actaeon===
Multiple versions Actaeon myth survive, though many are fragmentary.  The details vary but at the core they involve a great hunter, [[Actaeon]] who Artemis turns into a stag for a transgression and who is then killed by hunting dogs.  Usually the dogs are his own, who no longer recognize their master.  Sometimes they are Artemis' hounds.

According to the standard modern text on the work, Lamar Ronald Lacey's ''The Myth of Aktaion: Literary and Iconographic Studies'', the most likely original version of the myth is that Actaeon was the hunting companion of the goddess who, seeing her naked in her sacred spring, attempts to force himself on her.  For this hubris he is turned into a stag and devoured by his own hounds.  However, in some surviving versions Actaeon is a stranger who happens upon her.  Different tellings also diverge in the hunter's transgression, which is sometimes merely seeing the virgin goddess naked, sometimes boasting he is a better hunter than she, or even merely being a rival of [[Zeus]] for the affections of [[Semele]].

===Adonis===
[[File:Giuseppe-Mazzuoli-The-Death-of-Adonis-hermitag.jpg|thumb|right|''The Death of Adonis'', by [[Giuseppe Mazzuoli (1644-1725)|Giuseppe Mazzuoli]], 1709 - ''[[Hermitage Museum]]''.]]
In some versions of the story of [[Adonis]], who was a late addition to Greek mythology during the Hellenistic period, Artemis sent a [[Boar|wild boar]] to kill Adonis as punishment for his hubristic boast that he was a better hunter than she.

In other versions, Artemis killed Adonis for revenge. In later myths, Adonis had been related as a favorite of [[Aphrodite]], and Aphrodite was responsible for the death of [[Hippolytus (mythology)#Hippolytus as Virbius|Hippolytus]], who had been a favorite of Artemis. Therefore, Artemis killed Adonis to avenge Hippolytus’s death.

In yet another version, Adonis was not killed by Artemis, but by Ares, as punishment for being with Aphrodite.

===Orion===
[[Orion (mythology)|Orion]] was Artemis' hunting companion. In some versions, he is killed by Artemis, while in others he is killed by a [[Scorpius#Mythology|scorpion]] sent by [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. In some versions, Orion tries to seduce [[Opis]],<ref>"Another name for Artemis herself", [[Karl Kerenyi]] observes, ''The Gods of the Greeks'' (1951:204).</ref> one of her followers, and she killed him. In a version by [[Aratus]],<ref>Aratus, 638</ref> Orion took hold of Artemis' robe and she killed him in [[self-defense]].

In yet another version, Apollo sends the scorpion. According to [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]]<ref>Hyginus, ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'', ii.34, quoting the Greek poet Istrus.</ref> Artemis once loved Orion (in spite of the late source, this version appears to be a rare remnant of her as the pre-Olympian goddess, who took consorts, as [[Eos]] did), but was tricked into killing him by her brother Apollo, who was "protective" of his sister's maidenhood.

===The Aloadae===
These twin sons of [[Iphidemia]] and [[Poseidon]], Otos and Ephialtes, grew enormously at a young age. They were aggressive, great hunters, and could not be killed unless they killed each other. The growth of the [[Aloadae]] never stopped, and they boasted that as soon as they could reach heaven, they would kidnap Artemis and [[Hera]] and take them as wives. The gods were afraid of them, except for Artemis who captured a fine deer (or in another version of the story, she changed herself into a doe) and jumped out between them. The Aloadae threw their spears and so mistakenly killed each other.

===Callisto===
[[File:Tizian 015.jpg|thumb|''[[Diana and Callisto]]'' by [[Titian]].]]
[[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]] was the daughter of Lycaon, King of Arcadia and also was one of Artemis's hunting attendants. As a companion of Artemis, she took a vow of chastity. Zeus appeared to her disguised as Artemis, or in some stories Apollo, gained her confidence, then took advantage of her (or raped her, according to [[Ovid]]). As a result of this encounter she conceived a son, Arcas.

Enraged, Hera or Artemis (some accounts say both) changed her into a bear. Arcas almost killed the bear, but Zeus stopped him just in time. Out of pity, Zeus placed Callisto the bear into the heavens, thus the origin of Callisto the Bear as a constellation. Some stories say that he placed both Arcas and Callisto into the heavens as bears, forming the [[Ursa Minor]] and [[Ursa Major]] constellations.

===Iphigenia and the Taurian Artemis===
Artemis punished [[Agamemnon]] after he killed a sacred stag in a [[sacred grove]] and boasted that he was a better hunter than the goddess. When the Greek fleet was preparing at [[Aulis (ancient greece)|Aulis]] to depart for [[Troy]] to begin the [[Trojan War]], Artemis becalmed the winds. The seer [[Calchas]] advised Agamemnon that the only way to appease Artemis was to sacrifice his daughter [[Iphigenia]]. Artemis then snatched Iphigenia from the altar and substituted a deer. Various myths have been told around what happened after Artemis took her. Either she was brought to Tauros and led the priests there, or became Artemis' immortal companion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisFavour.html#Iphigeneia |title=FAVOUR OF ARTEMIS : Greek mythology |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |author=Aaron J. Atsma |accessdate=2011-01-28}}</ref>

===Niobe===
A Queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and wife of [[Amphion]], [[Niobe]] boasted of her superiority to Leto because while she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven boys and seven girls, Leto had only one of each. When Artemis and Apollo heard this impiety, Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics,  and Artemis shot her daughters, who died instantly without a sound. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions two of the Niobids were spared, one boy and one girl. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, killed himself. A devastated Niobe and her remaining children were turned to stone by Artemis as they wept. The gods themselves entombed them.

===Chione===
Chione was a princess of Pokis. She was beloved by two gods, [[Hermes]] and [[Apollo]], and boasted that she was prettier than Artemis because she made two gods fall in love with her at once. Artemis was furious and killed Chione with her arrow or struck her dumb by shooting off her tongue. However, some versions of this myth say Apollo and Hermes protected her from Artemis' wrath.

===Atalanta, Oeneus and the Meleagrids===
[[File:Artemis libation Louvre CA599.jpg|thumb|right|Artemis pouring a libation, c. 460-450 BC.]]
Artemis saved the infant [[Atalanta]] from dying of exposure after her father abandoned her. She sent a female bear to suckle the baby, who was then raised by hunters. But she later sent a bear to hurt Atalanta because people said Atalanta was a better hunter. This is in some stories.

Among other adventures, Atalanta participated in the hunt for the [[Calydonian Boar]], which Artemis had sent to destroy [[Calydon]] because King [[Oeneus]] had forgotten her at the harvest sacrifices. In the hunt, Atalanta drew the first blood, and was awarded the prize of the skin. She hung it in a sacred grove at [[Tegea]] as a dedication to Artemis.

[[Meleager]] was a hero of Aetolia.  King [[Oeneus]] had him gather heroes from all over Greece to hunt the [[Calydonian Boar]].  After the death of [[Meleager]], Artemis turned his grieving sisters, the [[Meleagrids]] into [[guineafowl]] that Artemis loved very much.

===Aura===
In [[Nonnus]] ''[[Dionysiaca]]'',<ref>Aura does not appear elsewhere in surviving literature and appears to have been offered no [[Cult (religion)|cult]].</ref> [[Aura (mythology)|Aura]] was Greek goddess of breezes and cool air, daughter of [[Lelantos]] and [[Periboia]]. She was a virgin huntress, just like Artemis and proud of her maidenhood. One day, she claimed that the body of Artemis was too womanly and she doubted her virginity. Artemis asked [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]] for help to avenge her dignity and caused the rape of Aura by [[Dionysus]]. Aura became a mad and dangerous killer. When she bore twin sons, she ate one of them while the other one, Iakhos, was saved by Artemis. Iakhos later became an attendant of [[Demeter]] and the leader of [[Eleusinian Mysteries]].

===Trojan War===
Artemis may have been represented as a supporter of Troy because her brother [[Apollo]] was the patron god of the city and she herself was widely worshipped in western Anatolia in historical times. In the ''[[Iliad]]''<ref>Homer, ''Iliad'' 21.470 ff).</ref> she came to blows with Hera, when the divine allies of the Greeks and Trojans engaged each other in conflict. Hera struck Artemis on the ears with her own quiver, causing the arrows to fall out. As Artemis fled crying to Zeus, Leto gathered up the bow and arrows.

Artemis played quite a large part in this war. Like her mother and brother, who was widely worshiped at Troy, Artemis took the side of the Trojans. At the Greek's journey to Troy, Artemis becalmed the sea and stopped the journey until an oracle came and said they could win the goddess' heart by sacrificing [[Iphigenia]], [[Agamemnon]]'s daughter. Agamemnon once promised the goddess he would sacrifice the dearest thing to him, which was Iphigenia, but broke the promise. Other sources{{which|date=November 2010}} said he boasted about his hunting ability and provoked the goddess' anger. Artemis saved Iphigenia because of her bravery. In some versions of the myth,{{which|date=November 2010}}, Artemis made Iphigenia her attendant or turned her into [[Hecate]], goddess of night, witchcraft, and the underworld.

[[Aeneas]] was helped by Artemis, Leto, and Apollo. Apollo found him wounded by Diomedes and lifted him to heaven. There, the three of them secretly healed him in a great chamber.

==Worship of Artemis==
[[File:Jerash Temple of Artemis.jpg|thumb|''Roman Temple of Artemis'' in [[Jerash, Jordan]], built during the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]].]]

{{Main|Brauronia}}

Artemis, the goddess of forests and hills, was worshipped throughout [[ancient Greece]].<ref>“. . . a goddess universally worshiped in historical Greece, but in all likelihood pre-Hellenic.” Hammond, ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 126.</ref> Her best known [[Cult (religious practice)|cults]] were on the island of [[Delos]]
(her birthplace); in Attica at [[Brauron]] and Mounikhia (near [[Piraeus]]); in [[Sparta]]. She was often depicted in paintings and statues in a forest setting, carrying a bow and arrows, and accompanied by a deer.

The ancient Spartans used to sacrifice to her as one of their patron goddesses before starting a new [[military campaign]].

[[Athenian festivals]] in honor of Artemis included [[Elaphebolia]], [[Mounikhia]], Kharisteria, and [[Brauronia]]. The festival of [[Artemis Orthia]] was observed in [[Sparta]].

Pre-pubescent and adolescent Athenian girls were sent to the sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron to serve the Goddess for one year. During this time, the girls were known as ''arktoi'', or little she-bears. A myth explaining this servitude states that a bear had formed the habit of regularly visiting the town of Brauron, and the people there fed it, so that, over time, the bear became tame. A girl teased the bear, and, in some versions of the myth, it killed her, while, in other versions, it clawed out her eyes. Either way, the girl's brothers killed the bear, and Artemis was enraged. She demanded that young girls "act the bear" at her sanctuary in atonement for the bear's death.

Virginal Artemis was worshipped as a fertility/childbirth goddess in some places, assimilating [[Ilithyia]], since, according to some myths, she assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin. During the [[classical antiquity|Classical period]] in [[Athens]], she was identified with [[Hecate]]. Artemis also assimilated [[Caryatis]] ([[Carya (goddess)|Carya]]).

===Epithets===
As '''Aeginaea''', she was worshiped in [[Sparta]]; the name means either huntress of [[chamois]], or the wielder of the javelin ({{lang|grc|αἰγανέα}}).<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], iii. 14. § 3.</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Schmitz |first=Leonhard |author-link =  |contribution=Aeginaea |editor-last=Smith | editor-first=William |title=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |volume=1 |page=26 |publisher= |place=Boston |year=1867 |contribution-url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0035.html |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref> She was worshipped at [[Naupactus]] as '''Aetole'''; in her temple in that town there was a statue of white marble representing her throwing a javelin.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], x. 38. § 6.</ref> This "Aetolian Artemis" would not have been introduced at Naupactus, anciently a place of [[Ozolian Locris]], until it was awarded to the [[Aetolia]]ns by [[Philip II of Macedon]]. Strabo records another precinct of "Aetolian Artemos" at the head of the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]].<ref>"Among the Heneti certain honours have been decreed to Diomedes; and, indeed, a white horse is still sacrificed to him, and two precincts are still to be seen — one of them sacred to the Argive Hera and the other to the Aetolian Artemis. (Strabo, v.1.9 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/5A*.html on-line text]).</ref> As [[Agoraea]] she was the protector of the [[agora]].

As '''[[Agrotera]]''', she was especially associated as the patron goddess of hunters. In [[Elis]] she was worshiped as '''[[Artemis Alphaea|Alphaea]]'''. In Athens Artemis was often associated with the local [[Aegina|Aeginian]] goddess, '''[[Aphaea]]'''. As '''[[Potnia Theron]]''', she was the patron of wild animals; [[Homer]] used this title. As '''Kourotrophos''', she was the nurse of youths. As '''Locheia''', she was the goddess of childbirth and midwives. She was sometimes known as '''[[Cynthia]]''', from her birthplace on [[Cynthus|Mount Cynthus]] on [[Delos]], or '''Amarynthia''' from a festival in her honor originally held at Amarynthus in [[Euboea]]. She was sometimes identified by the name '''Phoebe''', the feminine form of her brother Apollo's solar epithet [[Phoebus]].<br/>
In Sparta the Artemis ''Lygodesma'' was worshipped. This epithet means "willow-bound" from the Gr. ''lygos'' (λυγός, willow) and ''desmos'' (δεσμός, bond). The willow tree appears in several ancient Greek myths and rituals.<ref>[http://books.google.gr/books?id=YTfxZH4QnqgC&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=artemis+lygodesma&source=bl&ots=g1MyQhf-b8&sig=gBMucGkaGbYr7-hTHT11NCFovPo&hl=el&sa=X&ei=y-KoT-i4D4Kd8gPFivnLBA&ved=0CFIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=artemis%20lygodesma&f=false Bremmer Jan N.

==Artemis in art==
[[File:Bust of the goddess of Issa, Vis Museum, Croatia.JPG|thumb|right|Fourth century [[Praxiteles|Praxitelean]] bronze head of a goddess wearing a [[lunate]] crown, found at Issa ([[Vis (island)|Vis]], Croatia).]]

The oldest representations of Artemis in Greek Archaic art portray her as ''[[Potnia Theron]]'' ("Queen of the Beasts"): a winged goddess holding a stag and leopard in her hands, or sometimes a leopard and a lion. This winged Artemis lingered in ex-votos as [[Artemis Orthia]], with a sanctuary close by [[Sparta]].

In Greek classical art she is usually portrayed as a maiden huntress, young, tall and slim, clothed in a girl's short skirt,<ref>Homer portrayed Artemis as girlish in the ''[[Iliad]]''.</ref> with hunting boots, a quiver, a bow<ref>Greek poets could not decide whether her bow was silver or gold: "Over the shadowy hills and windy peaks she draws her golden bow." ([[Homeric Hymn]] to Artemis), and it is a golden bow as well in [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 1.693, where her nymph's is of horn. "And how often goddess, didst thou make trial of thy silver bow?", asks [[Callimachus]] for whom it is a [[Cydonia (ancient Greece)|Cydonia]]n bow that the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]] make for her (Callimachus, Hymn 3 to Artemis).</ref> and arrows. Often, she is shown in the shooting pose, and is accompanied by a [[hunting dog]] or stag. When portrayed as a goddess of the moon, Artemis wore a long robe and sometimes a veil covered her head. Her darker side is revealed in some vase paintings, where she is shown as the death-bringing goddess whose arrows fell young maidens and women, such as the daughters of [[Niobe]].

Only in post-Classical art do we find representations of Artemis-Diana with the crown of the [[crescent]] [[moon]], as [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]]. In the ancient world, although she was occasionally associated with the moon, she was never portrayed as the moon itself. Ancient statues of Artemis have been found with crescent moons, but these moons are always Renaissance-era additions.

On June 7, 2007, a Roman era bronze sculpture of ''[[Artemis and the Stag]]'' was sold at [[Sotheby's]] auction house in New York state by the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]] for $25.5 million.

===Attributes===
* '''Bow and arrow'''
[[File:Ac artemisephesus.jpg|thumb|The site of the [[Temple of Artemis]] at Ephesus.]]
According to the [[Homeric Hymn]] to Artemis, she had golden bow and arrows, as her epithet was '''Khryselakatos''', "of the Golden Shaft", and '''Iokheira''' (Showered by Arrows). The arrows of Artemis could also to bring sudden death and disease to girls and women. Artemis got her bow and arrow for the first time from The Kyklopes, as the one she asked from her father. The bow of Artemis also became the witness of Callisto's oath of her virginity. In later cult, the bow became the symbol of waxing moon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Bow |title= Bow |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>
* '''Chariots'''
Artemis' chariot was made of gold and was pulled by four golden horned deer (Elaphoi Khrysokeroi). The bridles of her chariot were also made of gold.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Chariot |title= Chariot|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>
* '''Spears, nets, and lyre'''
<!-- [[File:Artemis Spear.jpeg|thumb|right|upright=0.56|Artemis With A Hunting Spear, a statue at Venetia. {{deletable image-caption}}]]-->
Although quite seldom, Artemis is sometimes portrayed with a hunting spear. Her cult in Aetolia, the Artemis Aetolian, showed her with a hunting spear. The description about Artemis' spear can be found in Ovid's Metamorphosis,{{Where|date=July 2011}} while Artemis with a fishing spear connected with her cult as a patron goddess of fishing.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Spears |title= Spears|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>

As a goddess of maiden dances and songs, Artemis is often portrayed with a lyre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisGoddess.html#Dance |title= Dance |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>

====Fauna====
* '''[[Deer]]'''
Deer were the only animals held sacred to Artemis herself. On seeing a deer larger than a bull with horns shining, she fell in love with these creatures and held them sacred. Deer were also the first animals she captured. She caught five golden horned deer called '''Elaphoi Khrysokeroi''' and harnessed them to her chariot.<ref name=autogenerated1/> The [[Labours of Hercules|third labour of Heracles]], commanded by [[Eurystheus]], consisted in catching the [[Cerynitian Hind]] alive. Heracles begged Artemis for forgiveness and promised to return it alive. Artemis forgave him but targeted Eurystheus for her wrath.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Kerynitian |title=Kerynitian |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>
* '''Hunting dog'''
Artemis got her hunting dogs from [[Pan (god)|Pan]] in the forest of Arcadia. Pan gave Artemis two black-and-white dogs, three reddish ones, and one spotted one - these dogs were able to hunt even lions. Pan also gave Artemis seven bitches of the finest Arcadian race. However, Artemis only ever brought seven dogs hunting with her at any one time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Pack|title=Pack |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>
* '''[[Bear]]'''
The sacrifice of a bear for Artemis started with the Brauron cult. Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis' temple at Brauron. The Byzantine writer Suidos relayed the legend in Arktos e Brauroniois. A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced to the people of Athens. They touched it and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them. A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge. The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague. The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear's blood, no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple ('played the bear for the goddess').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Cult/ArtemisCult.html |title=Cult |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>
* '''[[Boar]]'''
The boar is one of the favorite animals of the hunters, and also hard to tame. In honor of Artemis' skill, they sacrificed it to her. Oineus and Adonis were both killed by Artemis' boar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Animals |title=Animals |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref>
* '''[[Guinea fowl]]'''
Artemis felt pity for the Meleagrids as they mourned for their lost brother, Meleagor, so she transformed them into Guinea Fowl to be her favorite animals.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}
* '''Buzzard [[hawk]]'''
Hawks were the favored birds of many of the gods, Artemis included.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

====Flora====
[[Arecaceae|Palm]] and [[Cypress]] were issued{{Clarify|date=August 2010}} to be her birthplace. Other plants sacred to Artemis are [[Amaranth]] and [[Asphodelus|Asphodel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Plants|title= Plants |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Artemis as ''the Lady of Ephesus''==
{{Main|Temple of Artemis}}
[[File:Statue of Artemis Ephesus.jpg|thumb|right|The Artemis of Ephesus, 1st century AD ([[Ephesus Archaeological Museum]])]]

At Ephesus in [[Ionia]], Turkey, her temple became one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World]]. It was probably the best known center of her worship except for Delos. There the Lady whom the Ionians associated with Artemis through ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'' was worshiped primarily as a mother goddess, akin to the Phrygian goddess [[Cybele]], in an ancient sanctuary where her [[cult image]] depicted the "Lady of Ephesus" adorned with multiple rounded breast like protuberances on her chest. They have been variously interpreted as multiple [[accessory breast]]s, as eggs, grapes, acorns,<ref>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:0SOozeq02TUJ:www.jtsa.edu/Documents/pagedocs/JANES/1992%252021/Hill21.pdf+artemis+of+ephesus+bead+necklace&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESimXSOUK1jN_JyphYXDpEbYTYEcMjh3Z1EEbjOcxutzRONT6lGq3Pf1KJ9h1W2PtLZqKjYMqjb1Knl59DocUY2sTBbKNP8SNxzLFjyR2yagDin0W--O8BHG8Vt2HwVsRQGI2POC&sig=AHIEtbQd7fbFB62estQtWfQM8RPIMXQmSQ "Ancient Art and Artemis: Toward Explaining the Polymastic Nature of the Figurine" by Andrew E.

==Artemis in astronomy==
A [[minor planet]], [[(105) Artemis]]; a [[Artemis (crater)|lunar crater]]; the [[Artemis Chasma]] and the [[Artemis Corona]] have all been named for her.

Artemis is the acronym for "Architectures de bolometres pour des Telescopes a grand champ de vue dans le domaine sub-Millimetrique au Sol," a large [[bolometer]] camera in the [[Submillimetre astronomy|submillimeter]] range that was installed in 2010 at the [[Atacama Pathfinder Experiment]] (APEX), located in the [[Atacama desert|Atacama Desert]] in northern Chile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apex-telescope.org/instruments/pi/artemis/ |title=APEX - Artemis |publisher=Apex-telescope.org |date=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>
