The '''Central Pacific Railroad''' (CPRR) is the former name of the railroad network built between [[California]] and [[Utah]], [[USA]] that formed part of the "[[First Transcontinental Railroad]]" in [[North America]]. It is now part of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. 

Many 19th century national proposals to build a transcontinental railroad failed because of the energy consumed by political disputes over [[slavery]]. With the [[secession]] of [[Southern United States|the South]], the modernizers in the [[Republican Party (US)|Republican Party]] controlled the [[US Congress]]. They passed legislation authorizing the railroad, with financing in the form of government railroad bonds. These were all eventually repaid with interest.<ref>{{cite book|last=Daggett|first=Stuart|title=Railroad Reorganization|year=1908|publisher=Harvard University Press|url=http://cprr.org/Museum/RR_Reorganization_1908.pdf|accessdate=13 December 2011|page=256|chapter=Union Pacific|volume=4}}</ref> The government and the railroads both shared in the increased value of the land grants, which the railroads developed.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Leo Sheep Co. v.

==Authorization and construction==
Planned by [[Theodore Judah]], the Central Pacific Railroad was authorized by Congress in 1862. It was financed and built through "[[The Big Four (Central Pacific Railroad)|The Big Four]]" (who called themselves "The Associates"): [[Sacramento, California]] businessmen [[Leland Stanford]], [[Collis Huntington]], [[Charles Crocker]], and [[Mark Hopkins (railroad)|Mark Hopkins]]. Crocker was in charge of construction. The western labor teams were primarily made up of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] emigrant workers with up to 12,000 such laborers employed by the Central Pacific Railroad representing 90 percent of the entire work force.<ref>George Kraus, "Chinese Laborers and the Construction of the Central Pacific," ''Utah Historical Quarterly'', vol. 37, no. 1 (Winter 1969), pp. 41-57.</ref> They laid the first rails in 1863. The "[[Golden spike]]", connecting the western railroad to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory, Utah]], was hammered on May 10, 1869.<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11371/ |title = Ceremony at "Wedding of the Rails," May 10, 1869 at Promontory Point, Utah |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1869-05-10 |accessdate = 2013-07-20 }}</ref> Coast-to-coast train travel in eight days became possible, replacing months-long sea voyages and lengthy, hazardous travel by wagon trains.

In 1885 the Central Pacific Railroad was leased by the [[Southern Pacific Company]]. Technically the CPRR remained a corporate entity until 1959, when it was formally merged into Southern Pacific. (It was reorganized in 1899 as the Central Pacific "Railway".) The original right-of-way is now controlled by the [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]], which purchased Southern Pacific in 1996.

The Union Pacific-Central Pacific (Southern Pacific) mainline followed the historic [[Overland Trail|Overland Route]] from [[Omaha, Nebraska]] to [[San Francisco Bay]].

==Financing==
[[File:Central_Pacific_Railroad_First_Mortgage_Bonds_Advertisement_1867.jpg|thumb|right|Advertisement for CPRR First Mortgage Bonds (1867)]]
Construction of the road was financed primarily by 30-year, 6% [[United States Treasury security|U.S. government bonds]] authorized by Sec. 5 of the [[Pacific Railway Acts|Pacific Railroad Act of 1862]]. They were issued at the rate of $16,000 per mile of tracked grade completed west of the designated base of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range near Roseville, CA where California state geologist Josiah Whitney had determined were the geologic start of the Sierras' foothills.<ref>[http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_Railroad_Acts.html#1862-05 Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 §5]</ref> Sec. 11 of the Act also provided that the issuance of bonds "shall be treble the number per mile" (to $48,000) for tracked grade completed over and within the two mountain ranges (but limited to a total of {{convert|300|mi|km}} at this rate), and "doubled" (to $32,000) per mile of completed grade laid between the two mountain ranges.<ref>[http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_Railroad_Acts.html#1862-11 Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 §11]</ref> The U.S. Government Bonds, which constituted a lien upon the railroads and all their fixtures, were repaid in full (and with interest) by the company as and when they became due.

Sec. 10 of the 1864 amending Pacific Railroad Act (13 Statutes at Large, 356) additionally authorized the company to issue its own "First Mortgage Bonds"<ref>[http://cprr.org/Museum/Bond_Adv_CPRR_1867.html FIRST MORTGAGE BONDS OF THE CENTRAL PACIFIC RAILROAD, Business Prospects and Operations of the Company, 1867.]</ref> in total amounts up to (but not exceeding) that of the bonds issued by the United States. Such company-issued securities had priority over the original Government Bonds.<ref>[http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_Railroad_Acts.html#1864-10 Pacific Railroad Act of 1864 §10]</ref> (Local and state governments also aided the financing, although the City and County of San Francisco did not do so willingly. This materially slowed early construction efforts.) Sec. 3 of the 1862 Act granted the railroads {{convert|10|sqmi|km2|0}} of public land for every mile laid, except where railroads ran through cities and crossed rivers. This grant was apportioned in 5 sections on alternating sides of the railroad, with each section measuring {{convert|0.2|mi|m}} by {{convert|10|mi|km}}.<ref>[http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_Railroad_Acts.html#1862-03 Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 §3]</ref> These grants were later doubled to {{convert|20|sqmi|km2|0}} per mile of grade by the 1864 Act.

[[File:San Francisco Pacific Railroad Bond WPRR 1865.jpg|thumb|left|An 1865 San Francisco '''Pacific Railroad Bond''' approved in 1863 but delayed for two years by the opposition of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors]]
Although the Pacific Railroad eventually benefited the Bay Area, the City and County of San Francisco obstructed financing it during the early years of 1863-1865. When Stanford was Governor of California, the Legislature passed on April 22, 1863, "An Act to Authorize the Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco to take and subscribe One Million Dollars to the Capital Stock of the Western Pacific Rail Road Company and the Central Pacific Rail Road Company of California and to provide for the payment of the same and other matters relating thereto" (which was later amended by Section Five of the "Compromise Act" of April 4, 1864). On May 19, 1863, the electors of the City and County of San Francisco passed this bond by a vote of 6,329 to 3,116, in a highly controversial Special Election.

The City and County's financing of the investment through the issuance and delivery of Bonds was delayed for two years, when Mayor [[Henry P. Coon]], and the County Clerk, Wilhelm Loewy, each refused to countersign the Bonds. It took legal actions to force them to do so: in 1864 the Supreme Court of the State of California ordered them under Writs of Mandamus (''The People of the State of California ''ex rel'' the Central Pacific Railroad Company vs. Henry P. Coon, Mayor; Henry M. Hale, Auditor; and Joseph S. Paxson, Treasurer, of the City and County of San Francisco.'' 25 Cal. 635) and in 1865, a legal judgment against Loewy (''The People ''ex rel'' The Central Pacific Railroad Company of California vs. The Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco, and Wilhelm Lowey, Clerk'' 27 Cal. 655) directing that the Bonds be countersigned and delivered. In 1863 the legislature's forcing of City and County action became known as the "Dutch Flat Swindle". Critics claimed the CPRR intended to build a railroad only as far as Dutch Flat, to connect to the Dutch Flat Wagon Road which they already controlled.

==Museums and archives==
[[Image:Lmc tdj.jpg|thumb|right|CPRR Original Chief Assistant Engineer [http://cprr.org/Museum/Lewis_Metzler_Clement.html L.M. Clement] (''l'') & Chief Engineer T.D. Judah (''r'')]]A replica of the [[Sacramento, California]] Central Pacific Railroad passenger station is part of the [[California State Railroad Museum]], located in the [[Old Sacramento State Historic Park]].

Nearly all the company's early correspondence is preserved at [[Syracuse University]], as part of the Collis Huntington Papers collection. It has been released on microfilm (133 reels). The following libraries have the microfilm: [[University of Arizona]] at Tucson; and [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] at Richmond. Additional collections of manuscript letters are held at Stanford University and the [[Mariners' Museum]] at [[Newport News, Virginia]]. [[Alfred A. Hart]] was the official [[photographer]] of the CPRR construction.

==Locomotives==
The Central Pacific's first three locomotives were of the then common [[4-4-0]] type, although with the [[American Civil War]] raging in the east, they had difficulty acquiring engines from eastern builders, who at times only had smaller [[4-2-4]] or [[4-2-2]] types available. Until the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental rail link]] and the railroad's opening of its own shops, all locomotives had to be purchased by builders in the northeastern U.S. The engines had to be dismantled, loaded on a ship, which would embark on a four month journey that went around [[Cape Horn|South America's Cape Horn]] until arriving in Sacramento where the locomotives would be unloaded, re-assembled, and placed in service.

[[File:CPRR Locomotive -113 FALCON 1869.jpg|thumb|left|CPRR #113 ''FALCON'', a Danforth 4-4-0, at Argenta, Nevada, March 1, 1869 (Photo: J.B. Silvis)]]Locomotives at the time came from many manufacturers, such as [[Cooke Locomotive and Machine Works|Cooke]], [[Schenectady Locomotive Works|Schenectady]], Mason, Rogers, Danforth, Norris, Booth, and McKay & Aldus, among others. Interestingly, the railroad had been on rather unfriendly terms with the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]], one of the more well-known firms. It is not clear as to the cause of this dispute, though some attribute it to the builder insisting on cash payment (though this has yet to be verified).  Consequently, the railroad refused to buy engines from Baldwin, and three former [[Western Pacific Railroad (1862–1870)|Western Pacific Railroad]] (which the CP had absorbed in 1870) engines were the only Baldwin engines owned by the Central Pacific.  The Central Pacific's dispute with Baldwin remained unresolved until well after the road had been acquired by the [[Southern Pacific]].

In the 1870s, the road opened up its own locomotive construction facilities in Sacramento. [[Central Pacific 173|Central Pacific's 173]] was rebuilt by these shops and served as the basis for CP's engine construction.
The locomotives built before the 1870s were given names as well as numbers. By the 1870s, it was decided to eliminate the names and as each engine was sent to the shops for service, their names would be removed. However, one engine that was built in the 1880s did receive a name, the [[El Gobernador]].
Construction of the rails was often dangerous work. Towards the end of construction, almost all workers were Chinese immigrants. The ethnicity of workers depended largely on the "gang" of workers/ specific area on the rails they were working.

==Preserved locomotives==
{{see also|List of preserved Southern Pacific Railroad rolling stock}}

The following CP engines have been preserved:
* [[Gov. Stanford|Central Pacific 1, ''Gov. Stanford'']]
* CP 233, a [[2-6-2T]] the railroad had built, is stored at the [[California State Railroad Museum]].
* [[C. P. Huntington|Central Pacific 3, ''C. P. Huntington'']]
* [[Stockton Terminal and Eastern No. 1|Former Western Pacific ''Mariposa'']], Central Pacific's second number 31. Was sold to [[Stockton Terminal and Eastern]] in 1914 and renumbered 1. Currently at the [[Travel Town Museum]] in Los Angeles.
* [[Virginia and Truckee Railroad]], though ''[[Virginia and Truckee 18 Dayton|The Dayton]]'' was not built for, nor served on the Central Pacific, the engine was one of two locomotives built by the CP's Sacramento shops in preservation (the other being CP 233). Moreover, its specifications were derived from CP 173, and thus is the only surviving example of that engine's design.
* Central Pacific's numbers [[Jupiter (locomotive)|60, ''Jupiter'']], and 63 ''Leviathan''. Although both engines have been scrapped, and therefore technically do not count as having been preserved, there were exact, full size operating replicas built in recent years. The ''Jupiter'' was built for the [[National Park Service]] along with a replica of Union Pacific's 119 for use at their [[Golden Spike National Historic Site]]. ''Leviathan'' was finished in 2009, is privately owned, and travels to various railroads to operate.

Results suggest that even without land grants, rates of return were high enough to induce investment. Also, land grants did not pay for the construction of the railroad. Land grants, however, did produce large social returns in western states by accelerating construction of the system.

The author summarizes and criticizes previous treatments of this subject, and discusses his own findings. Using the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific systems as the basis for his investigation, the author concludes that the railroad owners received unaided rates of return that substantially exceeded the private rate of return on the average alternative project in the economy during the same period. Thus, the projects were profitable, although contemporary observers expected that the roads would be privately unprofitable without the land grant aid. The land grants did not have a major effect, increasing the private rate of return only slightly. Nevertheless, he says the policy of subsidizing those railroad systems was beneficial for society since the social rate of return from the project was substantial and exceeded the private rate by a significant margin.
* {{cite journal| title=The Central Pacific Railroad and Exploitation of Chinese Labor| first = Paul M.| last = Ong| journal = Journal of Ethnic Studies| volume = 13| issue = 2| year = 1985| pages = 119–124}} Ong tries to resolve the apparent inconsistency in the literature on Asians in early California, with contradictory studies showing evidence both for and against the exploitation of Chinese labor by the CPRR, using [[monopsony]] theory as developed by Joan Robinson. Because CPRR set different wages for whites and Chinese (each group had different elasticities of supply) and used the two classes in different types of positions, the two groups were complementary, rather than interchangeable. Calculations thus show higher levels of exploitation of the Chinese than found in previous studies.

Analyzing the period 1869-1893, the author shows how Stanford and his associates repeatedly entered into pooling arrangements to prevent competition, bought out competitors, or forced rivals to agree not to compete. He concludes that Stanford and his partners viewed ''laissez-faire'' as applicable only to government controls, and not to businessmen's destruction of competition within the system.
