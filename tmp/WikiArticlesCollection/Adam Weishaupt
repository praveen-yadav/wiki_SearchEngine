==Early life==
Adam Weishaupt was born on 6 February 1748 in [[Ingolstadt]]<ref name="ADB Vol. 41"/><ref name="books.google.com">Engel [http://books.google.com/books?id=v72fDHzuMf0C&pg=PR6#PPA22,M1 22].</ref> in the [[Electorate of Bavaria]]. Weishaupt's father Johann Georg Weishaupt (1717–1753) died<ref name="books.google.com"/> when Adam was five years old. After his father's death he came under the tutelage of his [[Godparent|godfather]] [[Johann Adam von Ickstatt|Johann Adam Freiherr von Ickstatt]]<ref>''Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie'' [http://mdz10.bib-bvb.de/~db/bsb00008371/images/index.html?seite=742 Vol. 13, pp. 740–741].</ref> who, like his father, was a professor of law at the [[University of Ingolstadt]].<ref>Freninger, Franz Xaver, ed. ''Das Matrikelbuch der Universitaet Ingolstadt-Landshut-München''. München: A. Eichleiter, 1872. 31.</ref> Ickstatt was a proponent of the philosophy of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]],<ref>Hartmann, Peter Claus. ''Bayerns Weg in die Gegenwart''. Regensburg: Pustet, 1989. 262. Also, Bauerreiss, Romuald. ''Kirchengeschichte Bayerns''. Vol. 7. St. Ottilien: EOS Verlag, 1970. 405.</ref> and he influenced the young Weishaupt with his [[rationalism]]. Weishaupt began his formal education at age seven<ref name="ref name="ADB Vol. 41"/> at a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school. He later enrolled at the University of Ingolstadt and graduated in 1768<ref>Freninger 47.</ref> at age 20 with a [[Juris Doctor|doctorate of law]].<ref>Engel [http://books.google.com/books?id=v72fDHzuMf0C&pg=PR6#PPA25,M1 25–28].</ref> In 1772<ref>Freninger 32.</ref> he became a professor of law. The following year he married Afra Sausenhofer<ref>Engel [http://books.google.com/books?id=v72fDHzuMf0C&pg=PR6#PPA31,M1 31].</ref> of [[Eichstätt]].

After [[Pope Clement XIV]]’s [[suppression of the Society of Jesus]] in 1773, Weishaupt became a professor of [[canon law]],<ref>Engel [http://books.google.com/books?id=v72fDHzuMf0C&pg=PR6#PPA33,M1 33]. Also, ''Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie'' [http://mdz10.bib-bvb.de/~db/bsb00008399/images/index.html?seite=542 Vol. 41, p. 540].</ref> a position that was held exclusively by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] until that time. In 1775 Weishaupt was introduced<ref>Engel [http://books.google.com/books?id=v72fDHzuMf0C&pg=PR6#PPA61,M1 61–62].</ref> to the [[Empiricism|empirical]] philosophy of [[Johann Georg Heinrich Feder]]<ref>''Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie'' [http://mdz10.bib-bvb.de/~db/bsb00008364/images/index.html?seite=597 Vol. 6, pp. 595–597].</ref> of the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]]. Both Feder and Weishaupt would later become opponents of [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[idealism]].<ref>Beiser, Frederick C. ''The Fate of Reason''. Harvard University Press, 1987. [http://books.google.com/books?id=5ihJn9EKCl4C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#PPA186,M1 186–88].</ref>

==Founder of the Illuminati==
On 1 May 1776 Weishaupt formed the "Order of Perfectibilists". He adopted the name of "Brother [[Spartacus]]" within the order. Although the Order was not [[egalitarian]] or democratic internally, it sought to promote the doctrines of equality and freedom throughout society.<ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia">Catholic Encyclopedia: [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07661b.htm Illuminati], sourcing Illuminati papers</ref>

The actual character of the society was an elaborate network of spies and counter-spies. Each isolated cell of initiates reported to a superior, whom they did not know, a party structure that was effectively adopted by some later groups.<ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia" />

Weishaupt was initiated into the [[Masonic Lodge]] "Theodor zum guten Rath", at Munich in 1777. His project of "illumination, enlightening the understanding by the sun of reason, which will dispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice" was an unwelcome reform.<ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia" /> Soon however he had developed [[gnostic]] mysteries of his own{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}, with the goal of "perfecting human nature" through re-education to achieve a communal state with nature, freed of government and organized religion. He began working towards incorporating his system of Illuminism with that of Freemasonry.<ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia" />

Weishaupt's radical rationalism and vocabulary was not likely to succeed. Writings that were intercepted in 1784 were interpreted as seditious, and the Society was banned by the government of [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Karl Theodor]], Elector of Bavaria, in 1784. Weishaupt lost his position at the University of Ingolstadt and fled Bavaria.<ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia" />

==Activities in exile==
He received the assistance of [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg|Duke Ernest II]] of [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]] (1745–1804), and lived in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]] writing a series of works on illuminism, including ''A Complete History of the Persecutions of the Illuminati in Bavaria'' (1785), ''A Picture of Illuminism'' (1786), ''An Apology for the Illuminati'' (1786), and ''An Improved System of Illuminism'' (1787). Adam Weishaupt died in Gotha on 18 November 1830.<ref name="ADB Vol. 41"/><ref name="Engel 1906"/><ref name="van Dülmen 1975"/><ref name="Stauffer 1918"/> He was survived by his second wife, Anna Maria (née Sausenhofer), and his children Nanette, Charlotte, Ernst, [[Karl von Weishaupt|Karl]], [[Eduard von Weishaupt|Eduard]], and Alfred.<ref name="Engel 1906"/> Weishaupt was buried next to his son Wilhelm who preceded him in death in 1802.

After Weishaupt's Order of the Illuminati was banned and its members dispersed, it left behind no enduring traces of an influence, not even on its own erstwhile members, who went on in the future to develop in quite different directions.<ref>Dr. Eberhard Weis in ''Die Weimarer Klassik und ihre Geheimbünde'', edited by Professor Walter Müller-Seidel and Professor Wolfgang Riedel, Königshausen und Neumann, 2003, pp. 100-101</ref>

==References in pop culture==
Adam Weishaupt is referred to repeatedly in ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'', written by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]], as the founder of the [[Bavarian Illuminati]] and as an imposter who killed [[George Washington]] and took his place as the first president of the [[United States]]. Washington's portrait on the [[U.S. one-dollar bill]] is said to actually be Weishaupt's.

Another version of Adam Weishaupt appears in the extensive comic book novel ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark]]'' by [[Dave Sim]], as a combination of Weishaupt and George Washington. He appears primarily in the ''Cerebus'' and ''[[Church & State I]]'' volumes. His motives are [[republic]]an confederalizing of city-states in Estarcion (a pseudo-Europe) and the accumulation of capital unencumbered by government or church.

Weishaupt's name is one of many references made to the [[Illuminati]] and other conspiracies in the 2000 PC game ''[[Deus Ex]]''. During JC Denton's escape from Versalife labs in Hong Kong, he recovers a virus engineered with the molecular structure in multiples of [[23 enigma|17 and 23]]. Tracer Tong notes "1723... the birthdate of Adam Weishaupt" even though this reference is actually incorrect: Weishaupt was born in 1748.

Adam Weishaupt is also mentioned ("[[George W. Bush|Bush]] got a [[ouija]] to talk to Adam Weishaupt") by the New York rapper [[Cage Kennylz|Cage]] in [[El-P]]'s "Accidents Don't Happen", the ninth track on his album ''[[Fantastic Damage]]'' (2002).

Adam Weishaupt is briefly mentioned in [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Prague Cemetery]]''.<ref>Umberto Eco, ''The Prague Cemetery'' (Boston and New York 2011), 49.</ref>
