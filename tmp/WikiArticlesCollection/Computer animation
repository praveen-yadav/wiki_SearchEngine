[[Image:Activemarker2.PNG|right|thumb|300px|An example of computer animation which is produced in the "[[motion capture]]" technique]]
'''Computer animation''' or '''CGI animation''' is the process used for generating [[animation|animated images]] by using [[computer graphics]]. The more general term [[computer-generated imagery]] encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images, while ''computer animation'' only refers to moving images.

[[virtual cinematography|Modern computer animation]] usually uses [[3D&nbsp;computer graphics]], although [[2D&nbsp;computer graphics]] are still used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time renderings. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another [[Recording medium|medium]], such as [[film]].

Computer animation is essentially a digital successor to the [[stop motion]] techniques used in [[traditional animation]] with 3D models and frame-by-frame animation of 2D illustrations. Computer generated animations are more controllable than other more physically based processes, such as constructing [[Miniature effect|miniatures]] for effects shots or hiring [[extra (actor)|extras]] for crowd scenes, and because it allows the creation of images that would not be feasible using any other technology. It can also allow a single graphic artist to produce such content without the use of actors, expensive set pieces, or [[Theatrical property|props]].

To create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the [[computer monitor]] and repeatedly replaced by a new image that is similar to it, but advanced slightly in time (usually at a rate of 24 or 30 frames/second). This technique is identical to how the illusion of movement is achieved with [[television]] and [[film|motion pictures]].

For 3D animations, objects (models) are built on the computer monitor (modeled) and 3D figures are rigged with a virtual skeleton. For 2D figure animations, separate objects (illustrations) and separate transparent layers are used, with or without a [[Skeletal animation|virtual skeleton]]. Then the limbs, eyes, mouth, clothes, etc. of the figure are moved by the animator on [[key frame]]s. The differences in appearance between key frames are automatically calculated by the computer in a process known as [[Inbetweening|tweening]] or [[morphing]]. Finally, the animation is [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]].

For 3D animations, all frames must be rendered after modeling is complete. For 2D vector animations, the rendering process is the key frame illustration process, while tweened frames are rendered as needed. For pre-recorded presentations, the rendered frames are transferred to a different format or medium such as film or digital video. The frames may also be rendered in real time as they are presented to the end-user audience. Low bandwidth animations transmitted via the internet (e.g.&nbsp;[[Adobe Flash|2D&nbsp;Flash]], [[X3D]]) often use software on the end-users computer to render in real time as an alternative to [[streaming media|streaming]] or pre-loaded high bandwidth animations.

==A simple example==
 [[Image:CompAnimationExample.gif|right|146px|framed|Computer animation example]]
The screen is blanked to a background color, such as black. Then, a goat is drawn on the [[Display device|screen]]. Next, the screen is blanked, but the goat is re-drawn or duplicated slightly to the left of its original position. This process is repeated, each time moving the goat a bit to the left. If this process is repeated fast enough, the goat will appear to move smoothly to the left. This basic procedure is used for all moving pictures in films and television.

The moving goat is an example of shifting the location of an object. More complex transformations of object properties such as size, shape, lighting effects often require calculations and [[computer rendering]] instead of simple re-drawing or duplication.

==Explanation==
To trick the [[Human eye|eye]] and [[Human brain|brain]] into thinking they are seeing a smoothly moving object, the pictures should be drawn at around 12 [[frame rate|frames per second]] (frame/s) or faster (a [[Film frame|frame]] is one complete image). With rates above 75-120 frames/s no improvement in realism or smoothness is perceivable due to the way the eye and brain process images. At rates below 12 frame/s most people can detect [[jerkiness]] associated with the drawing of new images which detracts from the illusion of realistic movement. Conventional hand-drawn cartoon animation often uses 15 frames/s in order to save on the number of drawings needed, but this is usually accepted because of the stylized nature of cartoons. Because it produces more realistic imagery computer animation demands higher frame rates to reinforce this realism.

Movie film seen in theaters in the United States runs at 24 frames per second, which is sufficient to create the illusion of continuous movement. For high resolution, adapters are used.

==History==
{{Main|History of computer animation|}}
{{See also|Timeline of computer animation in film and television}}
Early digital computer animation was developed at [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in the 1960s by Edward E. Zajac, Frank W. Sinden, Kenneth C. Knowlton, and A. Michael Noll. Other digital animation was also practiced at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].

An early step in the [[history of computer animation]] was the sequel to the 1973 movie ''[[Westworld]],'' a science-fiction film about a society in which robots live and work among humans. The sequel, ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976),  used 3D [[Wire-frame model|Wire-frame]] imagery which featured a computer-generated hand and face created by [[University of Utah]] graduates [[Edwin Catmull]] and [[Fred Parke]]. This imagery had originally appeared in their student film ''[[A Computer Animated Hand]]'', which they completed in 1971.<ref name="sltrib">{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/mobile/53193670-90/film-catmull-computer-animation.html.csp|title=Pixar founder’s Utah-made ''Hand'' added to National Film Registry|work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=December 28, 2011|accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref>

Developments in CGI technologies are reported each year at [[SIGGRAPH]], an annual conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques which is attended each year by tens of thousands of computer professionals.  Developers of computer games and 3D video cards strive to achieve the same visual quality on personal computers in real-time as is possible for CGI films and animation. With rapid advancement of real-time rendering quality, artists began to use [[game engine]]s to render non-interactive movies, leading to the art form [[Machinima]].

The first feature-length computer animated film was the 1995 movie ''[[Toy Story]]'' by [[Pixar]].<ref>"Our Story", Pixar, 1986-2013. Retrieved on 2013-02-15. {{cite web |url= http://www.pixar.com/about/Our-Story |title=The Pixar Timeline, 1979 to Present. |publisher=Pixar}}</ref> It followed an adventure centered around toys and their owners. The groundbreaking film was the first of many fully computer animated films.

Computer animation created blockbuster films such as ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' (2010), ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009), ''[[Shrek 2]]'' (2004), ''[[Cars 2]]'' (2011), and ''[[Life of Pi (film)|Life of Pi]]'' (2012).

==Methods of animating virtual characters==
[[Image:Stickwalkav.gif|thumb|left|In this [[Graphics Interchange Format|.gif]] of a 2D [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] animation, each 'stick' of the [[stick figure|figure]] is [[Keyframe#Animation by means of computer graphics|keyframed]] over time to create motion.]]
<!--[[Image:FromRealToReal.jpg|thumb|200px|In [[motion capture]], the positions of the white dots on the actor's face and body are recorded in 3D, as shown here with ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' character Davy Jones.]] This is a non-free image and no rationale for it's use on this page exists -->
In most 3D computer animation systems, an animator creates a simplified representation of a character's anatomy, analogous to a [[skeleton]] or [[stick figure]]. The position of each segment of the skeletal model is defined by ''animation variables'', or [[Avar (animation variable)|Avars]].
In human and animal characters, many parts of the skeletal model correspond to actual bones, but [[skeletal animation]] is also used to animate other things, such as facial features (though other methods for [[facial animation]] exist). The character "Woody" in ''[[Toy Story]]'', for example, uses 700 Avars, including 100 Avars in the face. The computer does not usually [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the skeletal model directly (it is invisible), but uses the skeletal model to compute the exact position and orientation of the character, which is eventually rendered into an image. Thus by changing the values of Avars over time, the animator creates motion by making the character move from frame to frame.

There are several methods for generating the Avar values to obtain realistic motion. Traditionally, animators manipulate the Avars directly. Rather than set Avars for every frame, they usually set Avars at strategic points (frames) in time and let the computer interpolate or '[[tweening|tween]]' between them, a process called [[Keyframe#Animation by means of computer graphics|keyframing]]. Keyframing puts control in the hands of the animator, and has roots in hand-drawn [[traditional animation]].

In contrast, a newer method called [[motion capture]] makes use of [[live action]]. When computer animation is driven by motion capture, a real performer acts out the scene as if they were the character to be animated. His or her motion is recorded to a computer using [[video camera]]s and markers, and that performance is then applied to the animated character.

Each method has its advantages, and as of 2007, games and films are using either or both of these methods in productions. Keyframe animation can produce motions that would be difficult or impossible to act out, while motion capture can reproduce the subtleties of a particular actor. For example, in the 2006 film [[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]], actor [[Bill Nighy]] provided the performance for the character [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]]. Even though Nighy himself doesn't appear in the film, the movie benefited from his performance by recording the nuances of his body language, posture, facial expressions, etc. Thus motion capture is appropriate in situations where believable, realistic behavior and action is required, but the types of characters required exceed what can be done through conventional costuming.

==Creating characters and objects on a computer==
3D computer animation combines 3D models of objects and programmed or hand "keyframed" movement. Models are constructed out of geometrical vertices, faces, and edges in a 3D coordinate system. Objects are sculpted much like real clay or plaster, working from general forms to specific details with various sculpting tools. A bone/joint animation system is set up to deform the CGI model (e.g., to make a humanoid model walk). In a process called rigging, the virtual marionette is given various controllers and handles for controlling movement. Animation data can be created using [[motion capture]], or [[keyframing]] by a human animator, or a combination of the two.

3D models rigged for animation may contain thousands of control points - for example, the character "Woody" in [[Pixar]]'s movie ''[[Toy Story]]'', uses 700 specialized animation controllers. [[Rhythm and Hues Studios]] labored for two years to create [[Aslan]] in the movie ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' which had about 1851 controllers, 742 in just the face alone. In the 2004 film ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'', designers had to design forces of extreme weather with the help of video references and accurate meteorological facts. For the [[King Kong (2005 film)|2005 remake]] of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', actor [[Andy Serkis]] was used to help designers pinpoint the gorilla's prime location in the shots and used his expressions to model "human" characteristics onto the creature. Serkis had earlier provided the voice and performance for [[Gollum]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy.

==Computer animation development equipment==
[[Image:Jack-in-cube solid model, light background.gif|thumb|A ray-traced 3-D model of a jack inside a cube, and the jack alone below.]]

Computer animation can be created with a computer and animation software. Some impressive animation can be achieved even with basic programs; however, the [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]]ing can take a lot of time on an ordinary home computer. Because of this, [[video game]] animators tend to use low resolution, low polygon count renders, such that the graphics can be rendered in real time on a home computer. Photorealistic animation would be impractical in this context.

Professional animators of movies, television, and video sequences on computer games make photorealistic animation with high detail. This level of quality for movie animation would take tens to hundreds of years to create on a home computer. Many powerful [[workstation]] computers are used instead. Graphics workstation computers use two to four processors, and thus are a lot more powerful than a home computer, and are specialized for [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]]ing. A large number of workstations (known as a [[render farm]]) are networked together to effectively act as a giant computer. The result is a computer-animated movie that can be completed in about one to five years (this process is not composed solely of rendering, however). A workstation typically costs $2,000 to $16,000, with the more expensive stations being able to render much faster, due to the more technologically advanced hardware that they contain. Professionals also use digital [[movie camera]]s, [[motion capture]] or [[performance capture]], [[Chroma key|bluescreen]]s, [[List of video editing software|film editing software]], [[Theatrical property|prop]]s, and other tools for movie animation.

==Modeling human faces==
{{Main|Computer facial animation}}
The realistic modeling of human facial features is both one of the most challenging and sought after elements in computer-generated imagery. [[Computer facial animation]] is a highly complex field where models typically include a very large number of [[Avar (animation variable)|animation variables]]. Historically speaking, the first [[SIGGRAPH]] tutorials on ''State of the art in Facial Animation'' in 1989 and 1990 proved to be a turning point in the field by bringing together and consolidating multiple research elements, and sparked interest among a number of researchers.<ref>''Computer facial animation'' by Frederic I. Parke, Keith Waters 2008 ISBN 1-56881-448-8 page xi</ref>

The [[Facial Action Coding System]] (with 46 ''action units'' such as "lip bite" or "squint") which had been developed in 1976 became a popular basis for many systems.<ref name=Magnenat122 >'Handbook of Virtual Humans'' by [[Nadia Magnenat Thalmann]] and [[Daniel Thalmann]], 2004 ISBN 0-470-02316-3 pages 122</ref> As early as 2001 [[MPEG-4]] included 68 [[Face Animation Parameter]]s (FAPs) for lips, jaws, etc., and the field has made significant progress since then and the use of facial [[microexpression]] has increased.<ref name=Magnenat122 /><ref>''The MPEG-4 book'' by Fernando C. N. Pereira, Touradj Ebrahimi 2002 ISBN 0-13-061621-4 page 404</ref>

In some cases, an [[Affect measures|affective space]] such as the [[PAD emotional state model]] can be used to assign specific emotions to the faces of [[avatar (computing)|avatars]]. In this approach the PAD model is used as a high level emotional space, and the lower level space is the [[MPEG-4]] Facial Animation Parameters (FAP). A mid-level Partial Expression Parameters (PEP) space is then used to in a two level structure: the PAD-PEP mapping and the PEP-FAP translation model.<ref>S. Zhang et al. ''Facial Expression Synthesis using PAD Emotional Parameters for a Chinese Expressive Avatar'' in "Affective computing and intelligent interaction" edited by Ana Paiva, Rui Prada, Rosalind W. Picard 2007 ISBN 3-540-74888-1 pages 24-33</ref>

==Realism in the future of computer animation==
Realism in computer animation can mean making each frame look [[photorealism|photorealistic]], in the sense that the scene is rendered to resemble a photograph, or to making the animation of characters believable and lifelike.  This article focuses on the second definition.  Computer animation can be realistic with or without photorealistic rendering.

One of the greatest challenges in computer animation has been creating human characters that look and move with the highest degree of realism.  Many animated films instead feature characters that are [[anthropomorphic]] animals (''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', ''[[Bolt (2008 film)|Bolt]]'', ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'', ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'', ''[[Alpha and Omega (film)|Alpha and Omega]]'')  machines (''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', ''[[Robots (film)|Robots]]''), insects (''[[Antz]]'', ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[The Ant Bully (film)|The Ant Bully]]'', ''[[Bee Movie]]'')  fantasy creatures and characters (''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[TMNT (film)|TMNT]]'', ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'', ''[[Epic (film)|Epic]]''), or humans with nonrealistic, cartoon-like proportions (''[[The Incredibles]]'', ''[[Despicable Me]]'', ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'', ''[[Megamind]]'', ''[[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'', ''[[Planet 51]]'', ''[[Hotel Transylvania (film)|Hotel Transylvania]]'', ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'').

Part of the difficulty in making pleasing, realistic human characters is the [[uncanny valley]]: a concept where, up to a point, people have an increasingly negative emotional response as a human replica looks and acts more and more human.  Also, some materials that commonly appear in a scene like cloth, foliage, fluids, and hair have proven more difficult to faithfully recreate and animate than others.  Consequently, special software and techniques have been developed to better simulate these specific elements.

In theory, realistic computer animation can reach a point where it is indistinguishable from real action captured on film.  Where computer animation achieves this level of realism, it may have major repercussions for the film industry.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The goal of computer animation is not always to emulate live action as closely as possible.  Computer animation can also be tailored to mimic or substitute for other types of animation, such as traditional stop motion animation (''[[Flushed Away]]'').  Some of the long-standing [[12 basic principles of animation|basic principles of animation]], like squash & stretch, call for movement that is not strictly realistic, and such principles still see widespread application in computer animation.

==Movies==
[[File:Machinima sample reindeer full size.ogg|thumb|Right|[[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] film made using [[Machinima]]]]
CGI short films have been produced as [[independent animation]] since 1976, though the popularity of computer animation (especially in the field of [[special effect]]s) skyrocketed during the [[Modern animation in the United States|modern era of U.S. animation]]. The first completely computer-generated television series was ''[[ReBoot]]'', in 1994, and the first completely computer-generated animated movie was ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995). <!--Here must go a brief history--> See [[List of computer-animated films]] for more.

==Amateur animation==
The popularity of [[website]]s that allow members to upload their own movies for others to view has created a growing community of [[amateur]] computer animators. With utilities and programs often included free with modern [[operating system]]s, many users can make their own animated movies and shorts. Several [[free and open source software|free and open source]] animation software applications exist as well. A popular amateur approach to animation is via the animated [[GIF]] format, which can be uploaded and seen on the web easily.

==Detailed examples and pseudocode==
In 2D computer animation, moving objects are often referred to as “[[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s.” A sprite is an image that has a location associated with it. The location of the sprite is changed slightly, between each displayed frame, to make the sprite appear to move. The following [[pseudocode]] makes a sprite move from left to right:

 '''var''' ''int'' x := 0, y := screenHeight / 2;
 '''while''' x < screenWidth
 drawBackground()
 drawSpriteAtXY (x, y) ''// draw on top of the background''
 x := x + 5 ''// move to the right''

Computer animation uses different techniques to produce animations. Most frequently, sophisticated [[mathematics]] is used to manipulate complex three dimensional [[polygon]]s, apply “[[Texture mapping|texture]]s”, lighting and other effects to the polygons and finally [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] the complete image. A sophisticated [[graphical user interface]] may be used to create the animation and arrange its choreography. Another technique called [[constructive solid geometry]] defines objects by conducting boolean operations on regular shapes, and has the advantage that animations may be accurately produced at any resolution.

Let's step through the rendering of a simple image of a room with flat wood walls with a grey pyramid in the center of the room. The pyramid will have a spotlight shining on it. Each wall, the floor and the ceiling is a simple polygon, in this case, a rectangle. Each corner of the rectangles is defined by three values referred to as X, Y and Z. X is how far left and right the point is. Y is how far up and down the point is, and Z is far in and out of the screen the point is. The wall nearest us would be defined by four points: (in the order x, y, z). Below is a representation of how the wall is defined

<pre>
(0, 10, 0)                        (10, 10, 0)

(0,0,0)                           (10, 0, 0)
</pre>

The far wall would be:
<pre>
(0, 10, 20)                        (10, 10, 20)

(0, 0, 20)                         (10, 0, 20)
</pre>

The pyramid is made up of five polygons: the rectangular base, and four triangular sides. To draw this image the computer uses math to calculate how to project this image, defined by three dimensional data, onto a two dimensional computer screen.

First we must also define where our view point is, that is, from what vantage point will the scene be drawn. Our view point is inside the room a bit above the floor, directly in front of the pyramid. First the computer will calculate which polygons are visible. The near wall will not be displayed at all, as it is behind our view point. The far side of the pyramid will also not be drawn as it is hidden by the front of the pyramid.

Next each point is perspective projected onto the screen. The portions of the walls ‘farthest’ from the view point will appear to be shorter than the nearer areas due to perspective. To make the walls look like wood, a wood pattern, called a texture, will be drawn on them. To accomplish this, a technique called “[[texture mapping]]” is often used. A small drawing of wood that can be repeatedly drawn in a matching tiled pattern (like [[desktop wallpaper]]) is stretched and drawn onto the walls' final shape. The pyramid is solid grey so its surfaces can just be rendered as grey. But we also have a spotlight. Where its light falls we lighten colors, where objects blocks the light we darken colors.

Next we render the complete scene on the computer screen. If the numbers describing the position of the pyramid were changed and this process repeated, the pyramid would appear to move.

== Computer-assisted vs computer-generated animation ==

''To animate means "to give life to" and there are two basic ways that animators commonly do this.''

'''Computer-assisted animation''' is usually classed as two-dimensional ([[2D computer graphics|2D]]) animation. Creators drawings either hand drawn (pencil to paper) or interactively drawn(drawn on the computer) using different assisting appliances and are positioned into specific software packages. Within the [[software]] package the creator will place drawings into different [[key frame]]s which fundamentally create an outline of the most important movements. The computer will then fill in all the " in-between frames" commonly known as [[Inbetweening|Tweening]]. Computer assisted animation is  basically using new technologies to cut down the time scale that [[traditional animation]] could take, but still having the elements of traditional drawings of characters or objects.<ref name="Roos">Roos, Dave. "How Computer Animation Works", HowStuffWorks, Inc, 1998 - 2013. Retrieved on 2013-02-15. {{cite web |url= http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/computer-animation.htm |title=How Computer Animation Works |publisher=HowStuffWorks}}</ref>

Two examples of films using computer-assisted animation are [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|''Beauty and the Beast'']] and [[Antz|''Antz'']].

'''Computer-generated animation''' is known as 3 dimensional ([[3D computer graphics|3D]]) animation. Creators will design an object or character with an X,Y and Z axis. Unlike the traditional way of animation no pencil to paper drawings create the way computer generated animation works. The object or character created will then be taken into a software, key framing and tweening are also carried out in computer generated animation but are also a lot of techniques used that do not relate to [[traditional animation]]. [[Animator]]s can break physical laws by using mathematical [[algorithm]]s to  cheat, [[mass]], [[force]] and [[Gravitation|gravity]] rulings. Fundamentally, time scale and quality could be said to be a preferred way to produce animation as they are two major things that are enhanced by using computer generated animation. Another great aspect of CGA is the fact you can create a flock of creatures to act independently when created as a group. An animal's fur can be [[Computer programming|programmed]] to wave in the wind and lie flat when it rains instead of programming each strand of hair separately.<ref name="Roos" />

Three examples of computer-generated animation movies are [[Toy Story|''Toy Story'']], [[The Incredibles|''The Incredibles'']] and [[Shrek|''Shrek'']].
