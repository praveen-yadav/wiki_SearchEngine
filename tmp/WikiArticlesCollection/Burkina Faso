'''Burkina Faso''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Burkina Faso.ogg|b|ər|ˌ|k|iː|n|ə|_|ˈ|f|ɑː|s|oʊ}} {{respell|bər|KEE|nə}} {{respell|FAH|soh}}; {{IPA-fr|bu<!--not [y]-->ʁkina faso|lang}}), also known by its short-form name '''Burkina''', is a [[landlocked country]] in [[West Africa]] around {{convert|274200|km2}} in size. It is surrounded by six countries: [[Mali]] to the north; [[Niger]] to the east; [[Benin]] to the southeast; [[Togo]] and [[Ghana]] to the south; and [[Ivory Coast]] to the southwest. Its capital is [[Ouagadougou]]. In 2010, its population was estimated at just under 15.75 million.<ref name="INSD"/>

Formerly called the [[Republic of Upper Volta]], the country was [[Geographical renaming|renamed]] "Burkina Faso" on 4 August 1984 by then-President [[Thomas Sankara]], using a word from each of the country's two major native languages, [[Mòoré language|Mòoré]] and [[Dioula language|Dioula]]. [[Literal and figurative language|Figuratively]], "Burkina", from Mòoré, may be translated as "men of integrity", while "Faso" means "fatherland" in Dioula. "Burkina Faso" is thus meant to be understood as "Land of upright people" or "Land of honest people". Inhabitants of Burkina Faso are known as ''Burkinabè'' ({{IPAc-en|b|ər|ˈ|k|iː|n|ə|b|eɪ}} {{respell|bər|KEE|nə-bay}}).

Between 14,000 and 5000&nbsp;BC, Burkina Faso was populated by [[hunter-gatherer]]s in the country's northwestern region. Farm settlements appeared between 3600 and 2600 BC.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} What is now central Burkina Faso was principally composed of [[Mossi Kingdoms|Mossi]] kingdoms. These Mossi Kingdoms became a French protectorate in 1896. After gaining independence from France in 1960, the country underwent many governmental changes until arriving at its current form, a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] republic. The president is [[Blaise Compaoré]].

Burkina Faso is a member of the [[African Union]], [[Community of Sahel-Saharan States]], [[La Francophonie]], [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] and [[Economic Community of West African States]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Burkina Faso}}
{{more footnotes|date=October 2012}}

===Early history===
The northwestern part of today's Burkina Faso was populated by [[hunter-gatherer]]s between 14,000 and 5000 BC. Their tools, including [[scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], [[chisel]]s and [[arrowhead]]s, were rediscovered in 1973.

[[Agricultural]] settlements were established between 3600 and 2600 BC. The people began using iron, ceramics and polished stone between 1500 and 1000 BC and had developed religion, as shown by burial remains.

The [[Dogon people|Dogon]] lived in Burkina Faso's north and northwest regions until sometime in the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries, when they left for the cliffs of [[Bandiagara]]. The ruins of high walls built by an unknown culture remain in southwest Burkina Faso. [[Loropeni]] is a pre-European stone ruin which was linked to the gold trade. It was declared Burkina Faso's first [[World Heritage Site]] in 2009.

The central part of Burkina Faso included a number of [[Mossi Kingdoms|Mossi]] kingdoms, the most powerful of which were Wagadogo (Ouagadougou) and Yatenga. These kingdoms probably emerged in the early sixteenth century, though their origins are obscured by a legend featuring a heterogeneous set of warrior figures.<ref name="ReferenceA">Michel Izard, Moogo. L'émergence d'un espace étatique ouest-africain au XVIe siècle</ref>

===From colony to independence===
[[File:Burkina-faso-dourtenga.jpg|thumb|Traditional homes in south-east Burkina Faso.]]
[[File:Tiebele traditional house decoration Burkina Faso.jpg|thumb|Traditional Tiebele house decoration.]]
After a decade of intense rivalry and competition between the British and the French, waged through treaty-making expeditions under military or civilian explorers, the Mossi kingdom of Ouagadougou was defeated by French colonial forces and became a French protectorate in 1896. The eastern region and the western region, where a standoff against the forces of the powerful ruler [[Samori Ture]] complicated the situation, came under French occupation in 1897. By 1898, the majority of the territory corresponding to Burkina Faso today was nominally conquered; however, control of many parts remained uncertain.

The French and British convention of 14 June 1898 ended the scramble between the two colonial powers and drew the borders between the countries' colonies. On the French side, a war of conquest against local communities and political powers continued for about five years. In 1904, the largely pacified territories of the [[Volta River|Volta basin]] were integrated into the [[Upper Senegal and Niger]] colony of [[French West Africa]] as part of the reorganization of the French West African colonial empire. The colony had its capital in [[Bamako]].

[[Conscription|Draftees]] from the territory participated in the European fronts of [[World War I]] in the battalions of the [[Tirailleurs sénégalais|Senegalese Rifles]]. Between 1915 and 1916, the districts in the western part of what is now Burkina Faso and the bordering eastern fringe of Mali became the stage of one of the most important armed oppositions to colonial government, known as the Volta-Bani War.<ref>Mahir Saul and Patrick Royer, West African Challenge to Empire, 2001</ref> The French government finally suppressed the movement, but only after suffering defeats and being forced to gather the largest expeditionary force of its colonial history up to that point. Armed opposition also wracked the Sahelian north when the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and allied groups of the Dori region ended their truce with the government.
[[File:Sudanese Style Railway Station Bobo Dioulasso Burkina Faso.jpg|thumb|A railway station in [[Bobo Dioulasso]], built during the colonial era, that is still in operation.]]
[[French Upper Volta]] was established on 1 March 1919. This move was a result of French fears of the recurrence of armed uprising along with economic considerations, and to bolster its administration, the colonial government separated the present territory of Burkina Faso from Upper Senegal and Niger. The new colony was named [[French Upper Volta|Haute Volta]] and François Charles Alexis Édouard Hesling became its first [[List of governors of Upper Volta|governor]]. Hesling initiated an ambitious road-making program and promoted the growth of cotton for export. The cotton policy – based on [[coercion]] – failed, and revenue stagnated. The colony was later dismantled on 5 September 1932, being split up between Côte d'Ivoire, [[French Sudan]] and [[Niger]]. Côte d'Ivoire received the largest share, which contained most of the population as well as the cities of Ouagadougou and [[Bobo-Dioulasso]].

The decision to split the colony was reversed during the intense anti-colonial agitation that followed the end of [[World War II]]. On 4 September 1947 the colony was revived as a part of the [[French Union]], with its previous boundaries. On 11 December 1958 it achieved [[Self-governance|self-government]] and became the [[Republic of Upper Volta]] and a member of the Franco-African Community. A revision in the organization of French Overseas Territories began with the passage of the Basic Law (Loi Cadre) of 23 July 1956. This act was followed by reorganizational measures approved by the French parliament early in 1957 to ensure a large degree of self-government for individual territories. Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the French community on 11 December 1958.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Full independence from France was received in 1960.<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/635|title=More (Language of the Mossi Tribe) Phrase Book|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref>

===Upper Volta===
[[File:Flag of Upper Volta.svg|thumb|right|The [[Flag of Upper Volta|flag]] of the [[Republic of Upper Volta]].]]
{{main|Republic of Upper Volta}}
The Republic of Upper Volta ({{lang-fr|République de Haute-Volta}}) was established on 11 December 1958 as a [[self-governing colony]] within the [[French Community]]. The name Upper Volta indicated that the country is situated on the upper reaches of the [[Volta River]]. The river's three [[Tributary|tributaries]] are called the [[Black Volta]], [[White Volta]] and [[Red Volta]], and the colors of the national flag corresponded to these parts of the river system.

Before attaining autonomy it had been [[French Upper Volta]] and part of the [[French Union]]. On 5 August 1960, it attained full independence from [[French Fourth Republic|France]]. The first president, [[Maurice Yaméogo]], was the leader of the [[Voltaic Democratic Union]] (UDV). The 1960 constitution provided for election by universal suffrage of a president and a national assembly for five-year terms. Soon after coming to power, Yaméogo banned all political parties other than the UDV. The government lasted until 1966 when after much unrest—mass demonstrations and strikes by students, labor unions, and civil servants—the military intervened.

The military coup deposed Yaméogo, suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lt. Col. [[Sangoulé Lamizana]] at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for four years, and on 14 June 1970, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a four-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. After conflict over the 1970 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977, and Lamizana was reelected by open elections in 1978.

Lamizana's government faced problems with the country's traditionally powerful trade unions, and on 25 November 1980, Col. [[Saye Zerbo]] overthrew President Lamizana in a bloodless coup. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.

Colonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later, on 7 November 1982, by Maj. Dr. [[Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo]] and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP). The CSP continued to ban political parties and organizations, yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution.

Factional infighting developed between moderates in the CSP and the radicals, led by Capt. [[Thomas Sankara]], who was appointed prime minister in January 1983. The internal political struggle and Sankara's leftist rhetoric led to his arrest and subsequent efforts to bring about his release, directed by Capt. [[Blaise Compaoré]]. This release effort resulted in yet another military coup d'état on 4 August 1983.

After the coup, Sankara formed the National Council for the Revolution (CNR), with himself as president. Sankara also established Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDRs) to "mobilize the masses" and implement the CNR's revolutionary programs. The CNR, whose exact membership remained secret until the end, contained two small intellectual Marxist-Leninist groups. Sankara, Compaore, Capt. [[Henri Zongo]], and Maj. [[Jean-Baptiste Lingani]]—all leftist military officers—dominated the regime.

On 4 August 1984,<ref name=WDL1/> as a final result of President Sankara's activities, the country's name was eventually changed from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso.  The name combines a word of [[Mossi language|Mossi]] origin with a word of [[Mande languages|Mande]] origin, in order to be inclusive of the different ethnic groups in country, and translates to "land of honest people".<ref>Kingfisher Geography Encyclopedia. ISBN 1-85613-582-9. Page 170</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Patrick|title=Francophone Sub-Saharan Africa: 1880-198|year=1988|publisher=New York|location=Cambridge}}</ref>

===Burkina Faso===
[[File:Pionniers de la révolution.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Children during the 1983–1987 revolution.]]
On 15 October 1987, Sankara was killed by an armed gang with twelve other officials{{Clarify|date=September 2013|reason=Ambiguous. Does it mean "Sankara and twelve other officials were killed by an armed gang..."?}} in a coup d'état organized by his former colleague and current president, [[Blaise Compaoré]]. Deterioration in relations with neighbouring countries was one of the reasons given, with Compaoré stating that Sankara jeopardised foreign relations with former colonial power France and neighbouring Côte d'Ivoire. [[Prince Johnson]], a former Liberian warlord allied to [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]], told Liberia's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) that it was engineered by Charles Taylor. After the coup and although Sankara was known to be dead, some CDRs mounted an armed resistance to the army for several days.

Sankara's body was dismembered and he was quickly buried in an unmarked grave, while his widow and two children fled the country. Compaoré immediately reversed the nationalizations, overturned nearly all of Sankara's policies, returned the country back under the IMF fold, and ultimately spurned most of Sankara's legacy. As of 2010, Compaoré was entering his 23rd year in power. He "has become immensely wealthy", while Burkina Faso ranks as the third least developed country in the world.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Between February and April 2011, the death of a schoolboy provoked [[2011 Burkinabè protests|an uprising]] throughout the country, coupled with a military mutiny and a magistrates' strike.

== Politics ==
[[File:Tertius Zongo.jpg|thumb|Former prime minister Tertius Zongo.]]
{{main|Politics of Burkina Faso}}

With French help, the incumbent Blaise Compaoré seized power in a coup d'état in 1987, betraying his long-time friend and ally [[Thomas Sankara]], who was killed in the coup.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13101197 "Burkina Faso's Blaise Compaore sacks his government"], ''BBC News'', 15 April 2011</ref>

The constitution of 2 June 1991 established a semi-presidential government with a parliament which can be dissolved by the President of the Republic, who is elected for a term of seven years.

In 2000, the constitution was amended to reduce the presidential term to five years. The amendment took effect during the 2005 elections. The amendment also would have prevented the incumbent president, [[Blaise Compaoré]], from being reelected.

However, in October 2005, notwithstanding a challenge by other presidential candidates, the constitutional council ruled that, because Compaoré was the sitting president in 2000, the amendment would not apply to him until the end of his second term in office. This cleared the way for his candidacy in [[Burkina Faso presidential elections, 2005|the 2005 election]]. On 13 November, Compaoré was reelected in a landslide, because of a divided political opposition.

In the 2010 November Presidential elections, President Compaoré was re-elected. Only 1.6 million Burkinabès voted, out of a total population 10 times that size.

The parliament consists of one chamber known as the National Assembly which has 111 seats with members elected to serve five-year terms. There is also a constitutional chamber, composed of ten members, and an economic and social council whose roles are purely consultative.

There are attempts to decentralize power by the government of President Blaise Compaoré by devolving some of its powers to regions and municipal authorities. But the distrust towards politicians and the lack of political involvement complicates this process. Critics still speak of hybrid decentralisation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Failure Likely |author=Aristide Tiendrebeongo|publisher=dandc.eu |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/decentralisation-burkina-faso-coming-against-obstacles-because-local-people-are-distrustful}}</ref> 

Political freedoms are severely restricted in Burkina Faso, with human rights organizations decrying numerous acts of state-sponsored violence against journalists and other politically active members of society.

== Military, police and security forces ==
{{main|Military of Burkina Faso}}

The country employs numerous police and security forces, generally modeled after organizations used by [[French police]], and France continues to provide significant support and training to police forces in Burkina Faso.<ref>Das, Dilip K. and Palmiotto, Michael J., ''World Police Encyclopedia'', Routledge, ISBN 0-415-94250-0, ISBN 978-0-415-94250-8, (2005), pp. 139–141</ref>  The ''Gendarmerie Nationale'' is organized along military lines, with most police services delivered at the brigade level.<ref name="Das, pp. 139–141">Das, pp. 139–141</ref>  The [[Gendarmerie]] operates under the authority of the Minister of Defence, and its members are employed chiefly in the rural areas and along borders.<ref name="Das, pp. 139–141"/>

There is also a municipal police force controlled by the Ministry of Territorial Administration; a national police force controlled by the Ministry of Security; and an autonomous Presidential Security Regiment (''Régiment de la Sécurité Présidentielle'', or RSP), a ‘palace guard’ devoted to the protection of the President of the Republic.<ref name="Das, pp. 139–141"/>  Both the gendarmerie and the national police are subdivided into both administrative and judicial police functions; the former are detailed to protect public order and provide security, the latter are charged with criminal investigations.<ref name="Das, pp. 139–141"/>

All foreigners and citizens are required to carry photo ID passports, or other forms of identification or risk a fine, and police spot identity checks are commonplace for persons traveling by auto, [[Share taxi|bush-taxi]], or bus.<ref>U.S. Dept. of State, [http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1075.html Burkina Faso: Country Specific Information]</ref><ref>Foreign and Commonwealth Office, [http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travelling-and-living-overseas/travel-advice-by-country/sub-saharan-africa/burkina-faso ''Sub-Saharan Africa: Burkina Faso'']</ref>

The army consists of some 6,000 men in voluntary service, augmented by a part-time national People's Militia composed of civilians between 25 and 35 years of age who are trained in both military and civil duties. According to ''Jane’s Sentinel Country Risk Assessment'', Burkina Faso's Army is undermanned for its force structure and poorly equipped, but has numbers of wheeled light-armour vehicles, and may have developed useful combat expertise through interventions in Liberia and elsewhere in Africa.

In terms of training and equipment, the regular Army is believed to be neglected in relation to the élite Presidential Security Regiment (RSP).  Reports have emerged in recent years of disputes over pay and conditions.<ref>''[http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Sentinel-Security-Assessment-West-Africa/Army-Burkina-Faso.html Jane's Sentinel Security Assessment – West Africa]'', 15 April 2009</ref>  There is an air force with some 19 operational aircraft, but no navy, as the country is landlocked. Military expenses constitute approximately 1.2% of the nation’s GDP.

In April 2011, there was an [[2011 Burkina Faso mutiny|army mutiny]]; the president named new chiefs of staff, and a curfew was imposed in [[Ouagadougou]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13107109|accessdate=17 April 2011|title=Burkina Faso capital under curfew after army mutiny|publisher=BBC News|date=16 April 2011}}</ref>

{{main|Geography of Burkina Faso|Climate of Burkina Faso}}

Burkina Faso lies mostly between latitudes [[9th parallel north|9°]] and [[15th parallel north|15°N]] (a small area is north of 15°), and longitudes [[6th meridian west|6°W]] and [[3rd meridian east|3°E]].

It is made up of two major types of countryside. The larger part of the country is covered by a [[peneplain]], which forms a gently undulating landscape with, in some areas, a few isolated hills, the last vestiges of a [[Precambrian]] [[massif]]. The southwest of the country, on the other hand, forms a [[sandstone]] massif, where the highest peak, Ténakourou, is found at an elevation of {{convert|749|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. The massif is bordered by sheer cliffs up to {{convert|150|m|ft|0|sp=us}} high. The average altitude of Burkina Faso is {{convert|400|m|ft|0|sp=us}} and the difference between the highest and lowest terrain is no greater than {{convert|600|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. Burkina Faso is therefore a relatively flat country.

The country owes its former name of Upper Volta to three rivers which cross it: the [[Black Volta]] (or ''Mouhoun''), the [[White Volta]] (''Nakambé'') and the [[Red Volta]] (''Nazinon''). The Black Volta is one of the country's only two rivers which flow year-round, the other being the [[Komoé River|Komoé]], which flows to the southwest. The basin of the [[Niger River]] also [[drainage basin|drains]] 27% of the country's surface.

The Niger's [[tributary|tributaries]] – the Béli, the Gorouol, the Goudébo and the Dargol – are [[Torrent (stream)|seasonal streams]] and flow for only four to six months a year. They still can flood and overflow, however. The country also contains numerous lakes – the principal ones are Tingrela, [[Lake Bam|Bam]] and Dem. The country contains large ponds, as well, such as Oursi, Béli, Yomboli and Markoye. [[Drought|Water shortages]] are often a problem, especially in the north of the country.
[[File:WP 35, SDr9776.JPG|right|thumb|[[Savanna]]h near the [[Gbomblora Department]], on the road from [[Gaoua]] to [[Batié, Burkina Faso|Batié]]]]

Burkina Faso has a primarily tropical climate with two very distinct seasons. In the rainy season, the country receives between {{convert|600|and|900|mm|in|1|sp=us}} of rainfall; in the dry season, the [[harmattan]] – a hot dry wind from the Sahara – blows. The rainy season lasts approximately four months, May/June to September, and is shorter in the north of the country. Three climatic zones can be defined: the Sahel, the Sudan-Sahel, and the Sudan-Guinea. The [[Sahel]] in the north typically receives less than {{convert|600|mm|in|1|sp=us}}<ref name=relationship>{{cite web|url=http://www.sim.org/country.asp?fun=1&CID=18|title=SIM Country Profile: Burkina Faso|accessdate=5 August 2006}}</ref> of rainfall per year and has high temperatures, {{convert|5|–|47|°C|°F|1|lk=on}}.

A relatively dry [[tropical savanna]], the Sahel extends beyond the borders of Burkina Faso, from the [[Horn of Africa]] to the Atlantic Ocean, and borders the [[Sahara]] to its north and the fertile region of the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] to the South. Situated between 11°3' and 13°5' north [[latitude]], the Sudan-Sahel region is a transitional zone with regards to rainfall and temperature. Further to the south, the Sudan-Guinea zone receives more than {{convert|900|mm|in|1|sp=us}}<ref name=relationship /> of rain each year and has cooler average temperatures.

Burkina Faso's natural resources include [[manganese]], [[limestone]], [[marble]], [[phosphate]]s, [[pumice]], [[Salt mining|salt]] and small deposits of gold.

Burkina Faso's [[Wildlife in Burkina Faso|fauna and flora]] are protected in two national parks and several reserves: see [[List of national parks in Africa]], [[Nature reserves of Burkina Faso]].

{{main|Economy of Burkina Faso}}

Burkina Faso has one of the lowest GDP per capita figures in the world: $1,400.<ref>{{cite web |title=CIA World Factbook, GDP Per Capita Rank Order |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html}}</ref> Agriculture represents 32% of its gross domestic product and occupies 80% of the working population. It consists mostly of livestock but also, especially in the south and southwest, of growing [[sorghum]], [[pearl millet]], [[maize|maize (corn)]], [[peanut]]s, rice and cotton. A large part of the economic activity of the country is funded by international aid.

Burkina Faso was ranked the 111th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Euromoney Country Risk |url=http://www.euromoneycountryrisk.com/ |work=Euromoney Country Risk |publisher=Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC |accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref>

[[Remittance]]s used to be an important source of income to Burkina Faso until the 1990s, when unrest in [[Côte d'Ivoire]], the main destination for Burkinabe emigrants, forced many to return home. Remittances now account for less than 1% of GDP.

Burkina Faso is part of the [[West African Monetary and Economic Union]] (UMEOA) and has thus adopted the [[CFA Franc]], which is issued by the [[Central Bank of the West African States]] (BCEAO), situated in [[Dakar]], Senegal. The BCEAO is not only responsible for the monetary and reserve policy of the member states, but also for the regulation and oversight of financial sector and banking activity. A legal framework regarding licensing, bank activities, organizational and capital requirements, inspections and sanctions (all applicable to all countries of the Union) is in place and underwent significant reforms in 1999. [[Micro-finance]] institutions are governed by a separate law, which regulates micro-finance activities in all WAEMU countries. The insurance sector is regulated through the Inter-African Conference on Insurance Markets (CIMA).<ref>[http://www.mfw4a.org/burkina-faso/burkina-faso-financial-sector-profile.html MFW4A]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

There is mining of copper, iron, [[manganese]], gold, [[cassiterite]] (tin ore), and phosphates.<ref>[http://www.inadev.org/profile_-_burkina_faso.htm Profile - Burkina Faso<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> These operations provide employment, international aid, and in some cases hospitals at mines for the public. Gold production increased 32% in 2011 at six gold mine sites, making Burkina Faso the fourth largest gold producer in Africa, after South Africa, Mali and Ghana.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/iamgolds-growing-investment-in-burkina-faso/article2403056/page2/ |location=Toronto |work=The Globe and Mail |title=Search |date=27 April 2012}}</ref>

Burkina Faso also hosts the International Art and Craft Fair, Ouagadougou, better known by its French name as [[SIAO]], ''Le Salon International de l' Artisanat de Ouagadougou'', one of the most important African handicraft fairs.

Burkina Faso is a member of the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] (OHADA).<ref>{{cite web |title=OHADA.com: The business law portal in Africa |url=http://www.ohada.com/index.php |accessdate=22 March 2009 |postscript=}}</ref>

While [[Tertiary sector of the economy|services]] remain underdeveloped, one [[state-owned]] [[utility company]] run along commercial lines is emerging as one of the best performing utility companies in Africa, the National Office for Water and Sanitation (ONEA).<ref name=ODI1>Peter Newborne 2011.

== Demographics ==
[[File:Ouagadougou place nations unies.JPG|thumb|United Nations Square in [[Ouagadougou]].]]
[[File:Burkina Faso girl.jpg|thumb|Girl in Burkina Faso]]
{{main|Demographics of Burkina Faso|Languages of Burkina Faso}}

Burkina Faso's 15.3&nbsp;million people belong to two major West African cultural groups—the [[Gur languages|Voltaic]] and the Mande (whose common language is [[Dioula language|Dioula]]). The Voltaic [[Mossi people|Mossi]] make up about one-half of the population. The Mossi claim descent from warriors who migrated to present-day Burkina Faso from Ghana and established an empire that lasted more than 800 years. Predominantly farmers, the Mossi kingdom is still led by the [[Mogho Naba]], whose court is in Ouagadougou.<ref name=bn>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2834.htm "Burkina Faso"]. U.S. Department of State, June 2008.<br/>{{PD-notice}}</ref>

Burkina Faso is an ethnically integrated, secular state. Most of Burkina's people are concentrated in the south and center of the country, sometimes exceeding 48 per square kilometer (125/sq. mi.). Hundreds of thousands of Burkinabe migrate to Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, many for seasonal agricultural work. These flows of workers are obviously affected by external events; the September 2002 coup attempt in Côte d'Ivoire and the ensuing fighting there have meant that hundreds of thousands of Burkinabe returned to Burkina Faso.<ref name=bn/>

The [[total fertility rate]] of Burkina Faso is 6.07 children born per woman (2012 estimates), the sixth highest in the world.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uv.html CIA - The World Factbook<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The practice of [[Slavery in modern Africa|slavery]] in Burkina Faso, as in the [[Sahel]] states in general, is an entrenched phenomenon with a long history, going back to the [[Arab slave trade]], and it continues today.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7693397.stm West Africa slavery still widespread]". BBC News. October 27, 2008.</ref>

===Health===
{{main|Health in Burkina Faso}}
Average life expectancy at birth in 2004 was estimated at 52 for females and 50 for males.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.afro.who.int/home/countries/fact_sheets/burkinafaso.pdf |title=WHO Country Offices in the WHO African Region – WHO &#124; Regional Office for Africa |publisher=Afro.who.int |accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref>  The median age of its inhabitants is 16.7.

{{main|Religion in Burkina Faso}}
Statistics on religion in Burkina Faso are inexact because [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] are often practiced in tandem with indigenous religious beliefs. The [[Government of Burkina Faso]] stated in its most recent census (2006) that 60.5% of the population practice Islam, and that the majority of this group belong to the [[Sunni]] branch,<ref name=RGPH2006>{{cite web |url=http://cns.bf/IMG/pdf/Depliant_Resultats_Definitifs_du_RGPH_2006.pdf |title=Recensement général de la population et de l'habitation de 2006 |author=Comité national du recensement |date=July 2008 |publisher=Conseil national de la statistique |accessdate=20 January 2011}}</ref><ref name=report2010>[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148665.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2010: Burkina Faso]. United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] (17 November 2010). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref> while a small minority adheres to [[Shia]] branch. A significant number of Sunni Muslims identify with the [[Tijaniyah]] [[Sufi]] order. The Government also estimated that some 23.2% are Christians (19% being Roman Catholics and 4.2% members of various Protestant denominations), 15.3% follow [[African traditional religion|Traditional indigenous beliefs]], 0.6% have other religions, and 0.4% have none (atheism is virtually nonexistent).<ref name=RGPH2006/><ref name=report2010/>

A popular saying in Burkina Faso claims that "50% are Muslim, 50% are Christian, and 100% are [[animist]]". This shows the large level of acceptance of the various religions amongst each other. Even for Muslims and Christians, ancient animist rites are still highly valued. The Great Mosque of [[Bobo-Dioulasso]] was built by people of different faiths working together.

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Burkina Faso}}

[[Literature in Burkina Faso]] is based on the [[oral tradition]], which remains important. In 1934, during French occupation, Dim-Dolobsom Ouedraogo published his ''Maximes, pensées et devinettes mossi'' (''Maximes, Thoughts and Riddles of the Mossi''), a record of the oral history of the [[Mossi people]].<ref name="KS">{{cite book |last=Salhi |first=Kamal |title=Francophone Voices |publisher=Intellect Books |year=1999 |page=37 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=G9u9TeDegXMC |isbn=1-902454-03-0}}</ref> The oral tradition continued to have an influence on Burkinabè writers in the post-independence Burkina Faso of the 1960s, such as [[Nazi Boni]] and Roger Nikiema.<ref name="TJA">{{cite book |last=Allan |first=Tuzyline Jita |title=Women's Studies Quarterly: Teaching African Literatures in a Global Literary |publisher=[[Feminist Press]] |year=1997 |page=86 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=QD8TgZVWugYC |isbn=1-55861-169-X}}</ref> The 1960s saw a growth in the number of playwrights being published.<ref name="KS" /> Since the 1970s, literature has developed in Burkina Faso with many more writers being published.<ref name="JM">{{cite book |last=Marchais |first=Julien |title=Burkina Faso |publisher=Petit Futé |pages=91–92 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=6jsBLSzJWYsC |language=French |isbn=2-7469-1601-0 |year=2006}}</ref>

The [[theatre of Burkina Faso]] combines traditional Burkinabè performance with the colonial influences and post-colonial efforts to educate rural people to produce a distinctive national theatre. Traditional ritual ceremonies of the many ethnic groups in Burkina Faso have long involved dancing with [[mask]]s. Western-style theatre became common during colonial times, heavily influenced by [[French theatre]]. With independence came a new style of theatre inspired by [[Theatre of the Oppressed|forum theatre]] aimed at educating and entertaining Burkina Faso's rural people.

===Arts and crafts===
[[File:Burkina faso artisan painted gourds.jpg|thumb|Artisan garland of decorative painted [[gourd]]s in [[Ouagadougou]].]]
There is also a large artist community in Burkina Faso, especially in [[Ouagadougou]].  Much of the crafts produced are for the growing tourist industry. [[Tigoung Nonma]] was set up by a group of disabled artisans and sells crafts to provide a sustainable income for disabled artisans in Burkina Faso.<ref>Tigoung Nonma http://www.internationalservice.org.uk/where_we_work/burkina_faso/partners_burkina_faso.aspx</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{main|Burkinabé cuisine}}
Typical of West African cuisine, Burkina Faso's cuisine is based on [[staple food]]s of [[sorghum]], [[millet]], rice, maize, [[peanut]]s, potatoes, [[bean]]s, [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]s and [[okra]].<ref name="ox">{{cite web |title=Oxfam's Cool Planet – Food in Burkina Faso |publisher=[[Oxfam]] |url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet/ontheline/explore/journey/burkina/food.htm |accessdate=21 May 2008}}</ref> The most common sources of animal protein are chicken, chicken eggs and fresh water fish. A typical Burkinabè beverage is Banji or Palm Wine, which is fermented [[Palm wine|palm sap]] and Zoom-kom[?].

===Cinema===
[[File:BoboDioulasso-CineSanyonE.JPG|left|thumb|Cinema Sanyon in [[Bobo-Dioulasso]].]]
{{main|Cinema of Burkina Faso}}
The [[cinema of Burkina Faso]] is an important part of West African and African film industry.<ref>Spaas, Lieve, "Burkina Faso," in ''The Francophone Film: A Struggle for Identity,''  pp. 232–246. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000</ref> Burkina's contribution to [[African cinema]] started with the establishment of the film festival [[FESPACO]] (Festival Panafricain du Cinéma et de la Télévision de Ouagadougou), which was launched as a film week in 1969. Many of the nation's filmmakers are known internationally and have won international prizes. For many years the headquarters of the Federation of Panafrican Filmmakers (FEPACI) was in Ouagadougou, rescued in 1983 from a period of moribund inactivity by the enthusiastic support and funding of President Sankara (In 2006 the Secretariat of FEPACI moved to South Africa but the headquarters of the organization is still in Ouagaoudougou). Among the best known directors from Burkina Faso are [[Gaston Kaboré]], [[Idrissa Ouedraogo]] and [[Dani Kouyate]].<ref>Turégano, Teresa Hoefert, ''African Cinema and Europe: Close-Up on Burkina Faso'', Florence: European Press Academic, 2005.</ref>  Burkina also produces popular television series such as Bobodjiouf. The internationally known filmmakers such as Ouedraogo, Kabore, Yameogo, and Kouyate also make popular television series.

===Sports===
{{main|Sport in Burkina Faso}}
Sport in Burkina Faso is widespread and includes football (soccer), basketball, cycling, Rugby union, handball, tennis, athletics, boxing and martial arts. Football is very popular in Burkina Faso, played both professionally, and informally in towns and villages across the country. The national team is nicknamed "Les Etalons" ("the Stallions") in reference to the legendary horse of Princess [[Yennenga]]. In 1998, Burkina Faso hosted the African Cup of Nations for which the Omnisport Stadium in Bobo-Dioulasso was built.  In 2013, Burkina Faso qualified for the African Cup of Nations in South Africa, reached the final, but then lost to Nigeria by the score of 0 to 1.  The country is currently ranked 42nd in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/index.html|accessdate=10 July 2013|title=FIFA.com – The FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking}}</ref>

== Education ==
[[Image:Dourtenga school.JPG|thumb|right|280px|School children in [[Dourtenga]].]]
{{main|Education in Burkina Faso}}

Education in Burkina Faso is divided into primary, secondary and higher education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Burkina-Faso-EDUCATION.html |title=Education – Burkina Faso |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |accessdate=1 October 2009}}</ref> However schooling costs approximately CFA 50,000 ($97 USD) per year, which is far above the means of most Burkinabè families. Boys receive preference in schooling; as such, girls' education and literacy rates are far lower than their male counterparts. An increase in girls' schooling has been observed because of the government's policy of making school cheaper for girls and granting them more scholarships. In order to proceed from elementary to middle school, middle to high school or high school to college, national exams must be passed. Institutions of higher education include the [[University of Ouagadougou]], The Polytechnical University in [[Bobo-Dioulasso]] and the University of Koudougou, which is also a teacher training institution. There are private colleges in the capital city of [[Ouagadougou]] but these are affordable by only a small portion of the population.

There is also the [[International School of Ouagadougou]] (ISO), an American-based private school located in Ouagadougou.

The UN Development Program Report ranks Burkina Faso as the country with the lowest level of literacy in the world, despite a concerted effort to double its literacy rate from 12.8% in 1990 to 25.3% in 2008.<ref>[http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr_20072008_en_complete.pdf]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref>

== National and independent media ==
[[File:Burkina Faso media 2010.jpg|thumb|right|A member of the Burkinabé media at work in [[Ougadougou]].]]
{{main|Media of Burkina Faso|Communications in Burkina Faso}}

The nation's principal media outlet is its state-sponsored combined television and radio service, ''Radiodiffusion-Télévision Burkina'' (RTB).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtb.bf/ |title=Radiodiffusion-Télévision Burkina |publisher=Rtb.bf |accessdate=1 October 2009}}</ref> ''RTB'' broadcasts on two [[medium-wave]] ([[Amplitude modulation|AM]]) and several [[Frequency modulation|FM]] frequencies. Besides RTB, there are also a number of privately owned sports, cultural, music, and religious FM radio stations.  ''RTB'' also maintains a worldwide short-wave news broadcast (''Radio Nationale Burkina'') in the French language from the capital at Ouagadougou using a 100&nbsp;kW transmitter on 4.815 and 5.030&nbsp;MHz.<ref>Radio Station World, ''[http://radiostationworld.com/locations/burkina_faso/ Burkina Faso: Governmental Broadcasting Agencies]''</ref>

Attempts to develop an independent press and media in Burkina Faso have been intermittent. In 1998, investigative journalist [[Norbert Zongo]], his brother Ernest, his driver, and another man were assassinated by unknown assailants, and the bodies burned. The crime was never solved.<ref name="autogenerated2">Committee to Protect Journalists, [http://www.cpj.org/africa/burkina-faso/ ''Burkina Faso'']</ref>  However, an independent Commission of Inquiry later concluded that Norbert Zongo was killed for political reasons because of his investigative work into the death of David Ouedraogo, a chauffeur who worked for François Compaoré, President Blaise Compaoré's brother. In January 1999, François Compaoré was charged with the murder of David Ouedraogo, who had died as a result of torture in January 1998. The charges were later dropped by a military tribunal after an appeal. In August 2000, five members of the President's personal security guard detail (''Régiment de la Sécurité Présidentielle'', or RSP) were charged with the murder of Ouedraogo. RSP members Marcel Kafando, Edmond Koama, and Ousseini Yaro, investigated as suspects in the Norbert Zongo assassination, were convicted in the Ouedraogo case and sentenced to lengthy prison terms.<ref>Reporters Sans Frontieres, ''[http://www.rsf.org/spip.php?page=article&id_article=2485 What’s Happening About The Inquiry Into Norbert Zongo’s Death?]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}''</ref><ref>Reporters Sans Frontieres, ''[http://www.ifex.org/burkina_faso/2006/07/21/outrageous_denial_of_justice_in/ Outrageous Denial Of Justice]'' 21 July 2006</ref>

Since the death of Norbert Zongo, several protests regarding the Zongo investigation and treatment of journalists have been prevented or dispersed by government police and security forces. In April 2007, popular radio reggae host Karim Sama, whose programs feature reggae songs interspersed with critical commentary on alleged government injustice and corruption, received several death threats.<ref>IFEX, ''[http://www.ifex.org/burkina_faso/2007/04/30/radio_station_temporarily_pulls/ Radio Station Temporarily Pulls Programme After Host Receives Death Threats]'', 26 April 2007</ref>  Sama's personal car was later burned outside the private radio station ''Ouaga FM'' by unknown vandals.<ref>FreeMuse.org, ''[http://www.freemuse.org/sw19077.asp Death threat against Reggae Radio Host]'', 3 May 2007</ref>  In response, the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ) wrote to President Compaoré to request his government investigate the sending of e-mailed death threats to journalists and radio commentators in Burkina Faso who were critical of the government.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>  In December 2008, police in Ouagadougou questioned leaders of a protest march that called for a renewed investigation into the unsolved Zongo assassination. Among the marchers was Jean-Claude Meda, the president of the Association of Journalists of Burkina Faso.<ref>Keita, Mohamed, ''[http://cpj.org/blog/2008/12/burkina-faso-police-question-zongo-protesters.php#more Burkina Faso Police Question Zongo Protesters]'', Committee to Protect Journalists, 15 December 2008</ref>
