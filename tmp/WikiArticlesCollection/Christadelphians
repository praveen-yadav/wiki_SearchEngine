== History ==

=== 19th century ===
The Christadelphian religious group traces its origins to Dr [[John Thomas (Christadelphian)|John Thomas]] (1805–1871), who migrated to North America from England in 1832.<ref name="ch3">{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/bc2/Bereans/Cornerstones/Pioneers/Life/toc.html |title=Dr Thomas: His Life and Work. Chapter 3: Emigration to America |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>  Following a near shipwreck he vowed to find out the truth about [[human existence | life]] and God through personal [[Bible study (Christian) | Biblical study]].<ref name="ch3"/> Initially he sought to avoid the kind of [[sectarianism]] he had seen in England. In this he found sympathy with the rapidly emerging [[Restoration Movement]] in the United States of America at the time. This movement sought for a reform based upon the [[Sola scriptura|Bible alone]] as a sufficient guide and rejected all [[creed]]s. However this liberality eventually led to dissent as John Thomas developed in his personal beliefs and started to question mainstream orthodox Christian beliefs.  Whilst the Restoration Movement accepted Thomas's right to have his own beliefs, when he started preaching that they were essential to [[salvation]], it led to a fierce series of debates with a notable [[leadership | leader]] of the movement, [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]].  John Thomas believed that scripture, as God's word, did not support a multiplicity of differing beliefs, and challenged the leaders to continue with the process of restoring 1st-century Christian beliefs and correct interpretation through a process of debate.  The history of this process appears in the book ''Dr. Thomas, His Life and Work'' (1873) by a Christadelphian, [[Robert Roberts (Christadelphian)|Robert Roberts]].<ref>

During this period of formulating his ideas John Thomas was [[baptism|baptised]] twice,<ref>
John Thomas was baptised by Walter Scott of the Disciples of Christ in 1832 and again in 1847 (probably by John Tomline Walsh, according to Peter Hemingray ''John Thomas—His Friends and His Faith'' 2003 p.145) after publishing ''A Confession and Abjuration'' in which he renounced previously held beliefs as false.</ref> the second time after renouncing the beliefs he previously held. He based his new position on a new appreciation for the reign of Christ on David's throne.<ref>
{{cite web|url=http://www.antipas.org/books/faith_in_last_days/fld_014.html |title=Faith In The Last Days |publisher=Antipas.org |date=2011-08-05 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref> The abjuration of his former beliefs eventually led to the Restoration Movement disfellowshipping him when he toured England and they became aware of his abjuration in the United States of America.

The Christadelphian community in Britain effectively dates from Thomas's first lecturing tour (May 1848 – October 1850). His message found a particular welcome in Scotland, and [[Campbellite]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and [[Adventist]] friends separated to form groups of "Baptised Believers". Two thirds of ecclesias, and members, in Britain before 1864 were in Scotland.<ref>Wilson, AB op cit</ref><ref>Evans, Christmas. The Christadelphian 1956–63
</ref><ref>Norrie, William "Early History of the Gospel of the Kingdom of God in Britain" Earlston 1904
</ref> In 1849, during his tour of Britain, he completed (a decade and a half before the name ''Christadelphian'' was conceived) ''[[Elpis Israel]]''<ref>
John Thomas, ''Elpis Israel: an exposition of the Kingdom of God with reference to the time of the end and the age to come'' (London: 1849). Available [http://www.thechristadelphian.com/books/readonline/elpisisrael/default.html online]
</ref> (''elpis'' being Greek for "hope") – in which he laid out his understanding of the main doctrines of the Bible.{{wikisource|Elpis Israel}} Since his medium for bringing change was print and debate, it was natural for the origins of the Christadelphian body to be associated with journals and books, namely the ''Herald of the Kingdom'' and ''The Ambassador'' (which later became ''[[The Christadelphian]]'').

In this desire to seek to establish Biblical truth and test out orthodox Christian beliefs through independent scriptural study he was not alone and, amongst other churches, he also had links with [[Adventist]] movement and with [[Benjamin Wilson (Biblical scholar)|Benjamin Wilson]] (who later set up the [[Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith]] in the 1860s).

Although the Christadelphian movement originated through the activities of John Thomas, he never saw himself as setting up his own disciples. Rather he believed he had rediscovered 1st-century beliefs from the Bible alone,<ref>
'The Lecturer [John Thomas] commenced by denying a statement which had appeared in many of the London and country newspapers, and amongst them, one made by a religious Editor in this town, to the effect that he assumed to himself the true, infallible, prophetic character, as one sent from God, ''verbatim''. He would appeal to his writings -- and he had written a great deal in twelve years -- and to his speeches, whether he had ever claimed to be such, in the remotest degree whatever. He believed truth as it was taught in the scriptures of truth...' {{cite news

</ref> and sought to prove that through a process of challenge and debate and writing journals. Through that process a number of people became convinced and set up various fellowships that had sympathy with that position. Groups associated with John Thomas met under various names, including Believers, Baptised Believers, the Royal Association of Believers, Baptised Believers in the Kingdom of God, Nazarines (or Nazarenes) and The Antipas<ref name = "anrvrv"/> until the time of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865). At that time, church affiliation was required{{Where|date=July 2011}} to register for [[conscientious objector]] status, and in 1865 Thomas chose for registration purposes the name ''Christadelphian''.<ref name="ourname"/>

Through the teaching of John Thomas and the need in the American Civil War for a name, the Christadelphians emerged as a denomination, but they were formed into a lasting structure through a passionate follower of Thomas's interpretation of the Bible, [[Robert Roberts (Christadelphian)|Robert Roberts]]. Roberts's mother took him as a boy of 10 to hear John Thomas speak in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]]. At the age of 13 he read Thomas's ''Elpis Israel''. He was baptised in 1853 at the age of 14 in the [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|River Dee]] and joined the "Baptised Believers". He was 're-baptised' in 1863 "on attaining to an understanding of the things concerning the name of Jesus, of which he was ignorant at his first immersion".<ref>
''The Christadelphian'' Vol. 11 1874, p.610 (Birmingham: Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association)
</ref> In 1864 he began to publish ''The Ambassador'' magazine.<ref>

</ref> Roberts was prominent in the period following the death of John Thomas in 1871, and helped craft the structures of the Christadelphian body.<ref>
Andrew Wilson writes of Roberts that "The organising ability of Robert Roberts was very important: he gave the movement its rules, institutions and much of its literature". Andrew Wilson, ''History of the Christadelphians 1864–1885: the emergence of a denomination'' 1997 p.399.</ref>

Robert Roberts was certain that John Thomas had rediscovered the truth, and it is largely down to Roberts' organisation that the Christadelphian body exists in its present form.{{cn|date=October 2013}} His life was characterised by debates over issues that arose within the fledgling organisation; some of these debates can be found in the book ''Robert Roberts—A study of his life and character'' by Islip Collyer. He also wrote a booklet called a ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias''.<ref name="online">Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883). Available [http://www.thechristadelphians.org/htm/books/guide/index.html online]
</ref> which has been significant in establishing the basic structure most ecclesias follow today.

Initially the denomination grew in the English-speaking world, particularly in the [[English Midlands]] and in parts{{which?|date=October 2013}} of North America. In the early days after the death of John Thomas the group could have moved in a number of directions. Doctrinal issues arose, debates took place and statements of faith were created and amended as other issues arose. These attempts were felt necessary by many{{cn|date=October 2013}} to both settle and define a doctrinal stance for the newly emerging denomination and to keep out error.

* In 1873, the [[Nazarene fellowship|Nazarene Fellowship]], led by Edward Turney of Nottingham, separated over the atonement. The division was relatively short-lived, however, with most of the 200 people who had left returning within the next few years.<ref>Wilson, B., ''Sects and Society'', p. 243</ref> Following his death in 1879, Turney's most active supporter, David Handley of Maldon, returned to the main grouping,<ref>Christadelphian Magazine 1881</ref> and the group gradually died out. In the 1950s Ernest Brady revived Turney's cause and the name of the group.<ref>{{cite web | title = Introduction | url = http://www.thenazarenefellowship.co.uk | accessdate =2008-02-09 }}</ref>

* In 1885, the Suffolk Street Fellowship formed over the [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]] of the Bible. Robert Ashcroft, a leading member, wrote an article which challenged Christadelphian belief in [[Wiktionary:plenary|plenary]] inspiration and which, although he himself left, led to a division in the main body. One group formed a new ecclesia which later met in Suffolk Street, Birmingham. Other ecclesias throughout the world which supported them became known as the "Suffolk Street fellowship" to distinguish them from the group they had separated from, which became known as the "Temperance Hall fellowship". The main magazine of this group from 1884–1957 was ''The Fraternal Visitor'', whose editors included J.J. Bishop and J.J. Hadley (d. 1912), then [[Thomas Turner (metallurgist)|Thomas Turner]], and finally Cyril Cooper (till reunion in 1957).

* In 1898, the [[Unamended Christadelphians|Unamended Fellowship]] separated as a result of differing views on who would be raised to judgment at the return of Christ. The majority of Christadelphians believe that the judgment will include anyone who had sufficient knowledge of the gospel message, and is not limited to baptized believers.<ref>The Sydney Ecclesia, Australia had already "disfellowshipped" 10 members for denying this in 1883. The Christadelphian Magazine 1884, ecclesial news p.90 and editorial comment p.382
</ref> The majority in Britain, Australia and North America amended their statement of faith accordingly. Those who opposed the amendment in North America became known as the "Unamended fellowship" and allowed the teaching that God either could not or would not raise those who had no covenant relationship with him. Opinions vary as to what the established position was on this subject prior to the controversy.<ref>For example: [http://www.genusa.com/Truth/UnamendedErrors.html Website] claiming views held by Amended community were original Christadelphian beliefs Versus [http://www.republic-christadelphians.org/Unamended.html Website] claiming views held by Unamended community were original Christadelphian beliefs.</ref> In North America those who continued to associate with Britain on the basis of the amended 1898 statement became known as the [[Amended Christadelphians|Amended Fellowship]], in contrast to the Unamended Fellowship, who took their lead from the ''Christadelphian Advocate'' Magazine of [[Thomas Williams (Christadelphian)|Thomas Williams]] of Chicago.

* In 1923, the [[Berean Christadelphians|Berean Fellowship]] was formed, as a result of varying views on military service in Britain, and on the atonement in North America. In 1942 the Bereans again divided over marriage and divorce with the stricter party forming the Dawn Fellowship.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew Longman |url=http://www.dawnchristadelphian.co.uk/ |title=The Dawn Christadelphian Homepage |publisher=Dawnchristadelphian.co.uk |date=2007-01-05 |accessdate=2010-03-15}}<p>{{*}}{{cite web|url=http://www.dawnchristadelphians.org |title=A Dawn Christadelphian's Website |publisher=Dawnchristadelphians.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> The majority of the North American Bereans re-joined the main body of Christadelphians in 1952; though a number continue as a separate community {{as of | 2013 | lc = on}}.

=== 20th century ===
The Christadelphian position on conscientious objection came to the fore with the introduction of conscription during the [[World War I|First World War]]. Varying degrees of exemption from military service were granted to Christadelphians in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. In the Second World War, this frequently required the person seeking exemption to undertake civilian work under the direction of the authorities.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] the Christadelphians in Britain assisted in the [[Kindertransport]], helping to relocate several hundred Jewish children away from Nazi persecution and founding a hostel [[Elpis Lodge]].<ref>{{cite web  | title =Kinderball piano score | publisher =Imperial War Museum   | url = http://london.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1463 | accessdate =2008-02-08 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Morrell | first=Leslie | title =The Christadelphian Response to the Holocaust | url = http://lesliemorrell.com/papers/Response.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate =2008-02-08 }}</ref> In Germany the small Christadelphian community founded by [[Albert Maier]] went underground from 1940–1945, and a leading brother, [[Albert Merz]], was imprisoned as a conscientious objector and later executed.<ref>April 1941 in Berlin.Bogner, Gustav. Geschichte der Christadelphians in Deutschland (2) http://www.projekt-glauben.de/?p=205</ref>

In the 20th century, more moves were taken to try to reunite various of the earlier divisions. In the early 1950s the majority of the Berean Fellowship re-joined the Temperance Hall Fellowship, with the remainder continuing as a separate community. In 1957–1958, there was further reunion with the Suffolk Street Fellowship, which had already incorporated many of the Unamended Fellowship outside North America. This re-united group, which now included the large majority of Christadelphians, became known as the Central fellowship<ref name="Birmingham 1933, p. 376">The first use of the term "Birmingham (Central) fellowship" in ''The Christadelphian'' magazine was in volume 70, 1933, p. 376. The term was used to distinguish those ecclesias in fellowship with the Birmingham (Central) ecclesia from those in the "Suffolk Street fellowship". By 1939 the word "Birmingham" was dropped and the term "Central fellowship" was thereafter used with some regularity (342 times between 1939 and 2000) in ''[[The Christadelphian]]'' magazine</ref> named after the Birmingham Central ecclesia. In Australia and New Zealand a union occurred in 1958 between the Central fellowship and the Shield fellowship (which was allied to the Suffolk Street fellowship) through an understanding expressed in a document called the Cooper-Carter Addendum. Those who held that the reasons for separation from the Suffolk Street Fellowship remained, opposed the re-union and formed the Old Paths Fellowship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gospeltruth.info |title=Old Paths Fellowship (Australia) |publisher=Gospeltruth.info |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}<p>{{*}}{{cite web|url=http://www.christadelphians.co.uk |title=Old Paths Fellowship (UK) |publisher=Christadelphians.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> There is also some co-operation between the Central (Amended) and Unamended Fellowships in North America – most recently in the Great Lakes region, where numerous Amended & Unamended ecclesias have opened fellowship to one another despite the failure of wider attempts at re-union under the North American Statement of Understanding (NASU)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasu.ca |title=North American Statement of Understanding |publisher=Nasu.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> in recent years.

Despite success in reuniting large sections of the wider Christadelphian community and periodic efforts at reuniting smaller offshoots, there are still a number of small groups who remain separate from other bodies of Christadelphians. These include the Berean Fellowship,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bereans.org |title=Berean Christadelphians |publisher=Bereans.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> the Dawn Fellowship, the Old Paths Fellowship, the Companion Fellowship<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.companionchristadelphians.org |title=Companion Christadelphians |publisher=Companion Christadelphians |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> and the Pioneer Fellowship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pioneerchristadelphians.org |title=Pioneer Christadelphians | publisher=Pioneer Christadelphians |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref> However, Dawn Christadelphians and the former Lightstand Fellowship in Australia united in November 2007.<ref>The Dawn Christadelphian Magazine, January 2008</ref> Most of the divisions still in existence within the Christadelphian community today stem from further divisions of the Berean fellowship.<ref>Phillips, Jim, ''The Berean Christadelphians: Why the Bereans?''

=== Today ===
The post-war, and post-reunions, period saw an increase in co-operation and interaction between ecclesias, resulting in the establishment of a number of week-long Bible schools and the formation of national and [[international]] organisations such as the Christadelphian Bible Mission<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbm.org.uk/cbm2histo.htm |title=History of the Christadelphian Bible Mission |publisher=Cbm.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> (for preaching and pastoral support overseas), the Christadelphian Support Network<ref>see http://www.chsn.org.uk http://www.caregroup.org.au http://www.caringnetwork.ca</ref> (for counselling), and the [[Meal-a-Day Fund|Christadelphian Meal-A-Day Fund]] (for charity and humanitarian work).

The period following the reunions was accompanied by expansion in the developing world, which now accounts for around 40% of Christadelphians.<ref>Based on figures from ''CBM Worldwide Guide 2006'', Christadelphian Bible Mission (UK), 2006</ref>

=== Fellowships today ===
Since the reunions in the UK and Australia in 1957, two generations of Christadelphians have grown up with little awareness of the existence of the minority "fellowships", or awareness that the main group is called "Central" by the minority groups. Parallel with this generational change, many articles and books by member of the Central grouping on the doctrine and practice of fellowship now reject the notion itself of separate "fellowships" among those who recognise the same baptism, viewing such separations as schismatic.<ref>[http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/oates-pearce-1957-booklet-fellowship-and-withdrawal.doc Oates & Pearce ''Fellowship and Withdrawal'' (doc)] 1957<p>{{*}}[http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/whittaker_fellowship_1973.doc H.A. Whittaker ''Block Disfellowship?'' (doc)] articles from [[Testimony Magazine]] 1973<p>{{*}}{{cite web|url=http://www.christadelphianbooks.org/booker/bible_fellowship/ch01.html |title=Biblical Fellowship |publisher=Christadelphianbooks.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}<p>{{*}}Perry, Andrew. ''Fellowship Matters'', Willow publications, 2nd edition, 1996</ref> A third significant change, outside North America, has been the shrinking of the minority "fellowships" due to defection to the main group and natural causes. According to [[Bryan Wilson]], functionally the definition of a "fellowship" within Christadelphian history has been mutual or unilateral exclusion of groupings of ecclesias from the breaking of bread.<ref>See Wilson op.cit.</ref> This functional definition still holds true in North America, where two other sizeable groups, [[Unamended Christadelphians]] and the [[Church of the Blessed Hope|CGAF]], are not received by most North American [[Amended Christadelphians|Amended]] ecclesias. But outside North America this functional definition no longer holds. Many ecclesias in the "Central" grouping would not refuse a baptised Christadelphian from a minority "fellowship" from breaking bread; the exclusion is more usually the other way.

Today the Christadelphian body remains divided into a number of "fellowships", by far the largest being the Central fellowship (with ~55,000 members), named after the now-defunct Birmingham Central ecclesia, once its largest and most influential ecclesia.<ref name="Birmingham 1933, p. 376"/>  There remains a large number of Unamended Christadelphians, particularly in the US and Canada. Smaller fellowships include the Berean Christadelphians, the Dawn Christadelphians, the Old Paths Christadelphians, and the Pioneer Christadelphians.  The number of adherents to the various smaller groups of Christadelphians varies from approximately 1,850 members (the Unamended Christadelphians as of 2006)<ref>''2006 Christadelphian Ecclesial Directory''. Also see ''Unamended Christadelphian'' Wikipedia entry [[Unamended Christadelphians#Organization & worship|here]]</ref> to groups made up of little more than one or two [[Nuclear family|immediate families]].

They tend to operate organisationally fairly similarly, although there are different emphases. For instance the [[Berean Christadelphians]] focus on the pioneer Christadelphians and the Dawn Christadelphians put a huge importance on the need to follow a consistent set of disciplines regarding divorce and remarriage. These different Christadelphian fellowships are to some degree localised.  For example, the Unamended Fellowship exists only in North America, and some of the others are confined to the English-speaking world.

{{wikisource|Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith}}Each fellowship has a statement of faith, the most common of which is the ''Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith'' (BASF), named after an ecclesia in Birmingham. This is used by all Old Paths ecclesias without amendment from the days of Robert Roberts.  Most Unamended ecclesias have a similar statement of faith called the ''Birmingham Unamended Statement of Faith'' (BUSF)<ref>''Birmingham Unamended Statement of Faith''. Available [http://www.monroechristadelphians.com/browser/unamendedsof.html online]</ref> with one clause being different. The Berean Christadelphians generally use BASF.<ref>[www.bereans.org/basf.html Bereans.org BASF] With some exceptions including the Lampasas Texas Berean Ecclesia. Some have an amendment in the Doctrines to be Rejected which prohibits a person being a police constable.</ref> The Dawn Christadelphians<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawnchristadelphians.org |title=Dawn Christadelphians |publisher=Dawn Christadelphians |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> use a statement of faith which is based on the original 1886 statement of faith, but has four additions addressing issues that have arisen since that time. Some Christadelphian groups which are separated to a greater or lesser degree from the main body of Christadelphians use [[statement of faith|statements of faith]] which differ in some regard from the BASF and from each other.  Within the "Central" grouping individual ecclesias also may have their own statement of faith, whilst still accepting the statement of faith of the larger community.

For each fellowship, anyone who publicly assents to the doctrines described in the statement and is in good standing in their "home ecclesia" is generally welcome to participate in the activities of any other ecclesia although some ecclesias have statements around their positions, especially on divorce and re-marriage, making clear that offence would be caused by anyone in that position seeking to join them at the 'Breaking of Bread' service.

There are now clear differences between a number of ecclesias arising from a more 'liberal' view being taken on a number of issues which, in the past, would not have been tolerated.

=== General organisation ===
In the absence of centralised organisation, some differences exist amongst Christadelphians on matters of belief and practice.  This is because each congregation (commonly styled 'ecclesias') is organised [[wiktionary:autonomous|autonomously]], typically following common practices which have altered little since the 19th century. Most ecclesias have a constitution,<ref>Example: [http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/constitution.htm Constitution of the Birmingham Christadelphian Ecclesia, Midland Institute] c.1932-onwards</ref> which includes a 'Statement of Faith', a list of 'Doctrines to be Rejected' and a formalized list of 'The Commandments of Christ'.<ref>This list as published by [[The Christadelphian Magazine]] contains 53 paraphrases of Bible verses which were originally read weekly as part of the service at Temperance Hall ecclesia. Other versions, of unconfirmed origin, exist with the list expanded to 100 including some verses justifying division.</ref> With no central authority individual congregations are responsible for maintaining orthodoxy in belief and practice, and the statement of faith is seen by many as useful to this end. The statement of faith acts as the official standard of most ecclesias to determine fellowship within and between ecclesias, and as the basis for co-operation between ecclesias. Congregational discipline and conflict resolution are applied using various forms of consultation, mediation, and discussion, with disfellowship (similar to [[excommunication]]) being the final response to those with unorthodox practices or beliefs.<ref>Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883), Sections 32, 35–36</ref>

The relative uniformity of organisation and practice is undoubtedly due to the influence of a booklet, written early in Christadelphian history, called ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias''.<ref name="online"/> It recommends a basically democratic arrangement by which congregational members elect 'brothers' to arranging and serving duties,<ref>Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883), Sections 17–27</ref> and includes guidelines for the organisation of committees, as well as conflict resolution between congregational members and between congregations.<ref>Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883), Sections 35–38, 41–42</ref> Christadelphians do not have paid [[minister of religion|ministers]]. Male members are assessed by the congregation for their eligibility to teach and perform other duties, which are usually assigned on a rotation basis, as opposed to having a permanently appointed preacher. Congregational governance typically follows a [[democracy|democratic]] model, with an elected arranging committee for each individual ecclesia. This unpaid committee is responsible for the day-to-day running of the ecclesia and is answerable to the rest of the ecclesia's members.

Inter-ecclesial organisations co-ordinate the running of, among other things, Christadelphian schools<ref>For example: Christadelphian [[Heritage College (Cooranbong)|Heritage College, Cooranbong]] and Christadelphian [[Heritage College (Sydney)|Heritage College Sydney]], Kemps Creek.</ref> and elderly care homes, the [[Christadelphian Isolation League]] (which cares for those prevented by distance or infirmity from attending an ecclesia regularly) and the publication of [[:Category:Christadelphian magazines|Christadelphian magazines]].

== Beliefs ==
Due to the way the Christadelphian body is organised there is no central authority to establish and maintain a standardised set of beliefs and it depends what statement of faith is adhered to and how liberal the ecclesia is, but there are core doctrines most Christadelphians would accept.  In the formal statements of faith a more complete list is found. For instance in the Central fellowship, the BASF, the standard statement of faith, has 30 doctrines to be accepted and 35 to be rejected.

=== The Bible ===
Christadelphians state that their beliefs<ref>See, e.g., the ''[http://www.christadelphia.org/basf.htm Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith]''</ref> are based wholly on the [[Bible]],<ref name="hyndman"/> and they do not see other works as inspired by [[God]].<ref>{{cite book | last =Bull  | first =Mike| title =The Bible—The Word of God | publisher =Printland Publishers | location =Hyderabad | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_bible.htm | isbn =81-87409-52-5 }}</ref> They regard the Bible as inspired by God and, therefore, believe that, in its original form, it was error free (errors in later copies are thought to be due to 'errors of transcription or translation').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christadelphia.org/basf.htm |title=The Christadelphian Statement of Faith |publisher=Christadelphia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref> Based on this, Christadelphians teach what they believe to be true Bible teaching.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truebibleteaching.co.nz |title=True Bible Teaching Home |publisher=Truebibleteaching.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truebibleteaching.co.nz/teaching/12-the-bible-our-guide.html |title=True Bible Teaching Teaching |publisher=Truebibleteaching.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref>

If I be asked, what is the manner in which he teaches this religion, I reply in the same way that all teachers convey instruction to their pupils; ''by words, either spoken or written''. ... Now Paul says that the ''sacred Scriptures are able to make us wise to salvation, by the faith'' (or gospel) ''which is through Jesus Christ''. What more do we want than wisdom in relation to this matter? If the sacred Scriptures are able to make us wise, we need no other instrumentality. The Holy Spirit by the word, without infusing a single idea into it more than it actually and ordinarily contains, and without any collateral influence, teaches us all wisdom and knowledge that is necessary ...' John Thomas, ''The Apostasy Unveiled'', as quoted in G. Pearce, ''The Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit Gifts'', pp. 71-2</ref>

== Other historical groups and individuals with some shared doctrines ==
One criticism of the Christadelphian movement has been over the claim of John Thomas and Robert Roberts to have "rediscovered" scriptural truth.<ref>Christendom Astray, Robert Roberts, written 1862, Lecture 1: 'Do you mean to say, asks the incredulous enquirer, that the Bible has been studied by men of learning for eighteen centuries without being understood?  and that the thousands of ministers set apart for the very purpose of ministering in its holy pages are all mistaken?'  (He then goes on to suggest that social conditioning, self interest by the clergy and an incomplete reformation prevented its rediscovery.)</ref><ref>In an article 'A Glance at The History and Mystery of Christadelphianism', a contemporary of John Thomas, David King, from the Restoration Movement 1881, argues that a complete losing of truth would have been unlikely.  Available [http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~pdover/histmyst.htm online]</ref> However, although both men believed that they had "recovered" the true doctrines for themselves and contemporaries, they also believed there had always existed a group of true believers throughout the ages, albeit marred by the apostasy.<ref>'An arrangement of this sort was absolutely necessary for '''the preservation and protection of the One Body, witnessing for the truth''' against "the worshipping of the daemonials and idols", in the midst of the nations, and "before the God of the earth;" the weapons of whose warfare were civil disabilities, and the infernal tortures of anti-heretical crusaders and inquisitions.', John Thomas, 'Eureka' (1915 edition), volume 2, chapter 11, section 2.1</ref><ref>''''Thus, the history of the ages and the generations of the unmeasured Court is in strict harmony with this prophecy of the witnesses'''. For a period considerably over a thousand years after Rome renounced its old gods for the ghosts, dry bones, and fables of the catholic superstition, '''the Spirit had provided himself with Two Witnessing Classes, to whose custody he providentially committed the truth''', and its judicial vindication by fire and sword.', John Thomas, 'Eureka', volume 2, chapter 11, section 2.2</ref><ref>'Though the apostles died, their work continued, '''and the generation of believers that went to the grave with them were succeeded by other believers who maintained the integral structure of the temple of God, founded in Europe'''. True, the work was marred and corrupted by the apostasy of the mass: '''still, a real work—a real temple, existed, consisting of the remnant of true believers preserved by God as His witnesses in the midst of the prevailing corruption'''.', Robert Roberts, 'Thirteen Lectures On The Apocalypse' (4th edition 1921), page 98</ref>

The most notable Christadelphian attempts to find a continuity of those with doctrinal similarities since that point have been geographer [[Alan Eyre]]'s two books ''The Protesters''<ref>http://www.antipas.org/books/protesters/prot_toc.html</ref> (1975) and ''Brethren in Christ''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antipas.org/books/brethren_in_christ/binc_toc.html |title=Brethren In Christ Contents Contents |publisher=Antipas.org |date=2012-10-07 |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref> (1982) in which he shows that many individual Christadelphian doctrines had been previously believed.  Eyre focused in particular on the [[Radical Reformation]], and also among the [[Socinians]] and other early [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and the [[English Dissenters]]. In this way, Eyre was able to demonstrate substantial historical precedents for individual Christadelphian teachings and practices, and believed that the Christadelphian community was the 'inheritor of a noble tradition, by which elements of the Truth were from century to century hammered out on the anvil of controversy, affliction and even anguish'.<ref name="Alan Eyre page 8">Alan Eyre, 'The Protestors', page 8 (1975)</ref>  Although noting in the introduction to 'The Protestors' that 'Some recorded herein perhaps did not have "all the truth" — so the writer has been reminded',<ref name="Alan Eyre page 8"/> Eyre nevertheless claimed that the purpose of the work was to 'tell how a number of little-known individuals, groups and religious communities strove to preserve or revive the original Christianity of apostolic times',<ref>Alan Eyre, 'The Protestors', page 11 (1975)</ref> and that 'In faith and outlook they were far closer to the early springing shoots of 1st-century Christianity and the penetrating spiritual challenge of Jesus himself than much that has passed for the religion of the Nazarene in the last nineteen centuries'.<ref>Alan Eyre, 'The Protestors', pages 11–12 (1975)</ref>

Eyre's research has been criticized by some of his Christadelphian peers,<ref>Both of Eyre's works were criticized by Ruth McHaffie 'Finding Founders and Facing Facts' (2001), in which evidence was presented suggesting that Eyre had misread a number of his sources, and that some his claims could not be supported from (and were often contradicted by) the available historical evidence.</ref> and as a result Christadelphian commentary on the subject was subsequently more cautious and circumspect, with caveats being issued concerning Eyre's claims,<ref>'But some, though having neither time nor opportunity to search archives, knew enough to realise that the claims were exaggerated, however praiseworthy the intention. Moreover, misgivings increased as the years passed and when members examined the subject more closely for themselves.  As explained in the November 1993 issue of The Endeavour Magazine, Brother Ron Coleman in 1986, when preparing an address for the Oxford ecclesia to commemorate the 450th anniversary of William Tyndale's death, not only sought information from The Protesters but also from Tyndale's own writings. He was surprised to find serious misrepresentations in our community's publication.', Ruth McHaffie, 'Finding Founders And Facing Facts', (2001), page 8</ref><ref>'In 1989 when an article by Brother Alan appeared in The Christadelphian containing a number of inaccuracies on the hymn writer Isaac Watts,, editor of The Christadelphian, and subsequently corresponded with Alan in the manner which becomes Brethren.  Scholarly evidence to disprove Ron's criticisms was not forthcoming with regard to either Tyndale or Watts, and the editor was requested to publish a short note of amendment on both writers, but there appears to have been no response.', Ruth McHaffie, 'Finding Founders And Facing Facts', (2001), page 8</ref> and the two books less used and publicized than in previous years.

Nevertheless, all the distinctive Christadelphian doctrines, down to interpretations of specific verses, can be found particularly among 16th century [[Socinianism|Socinian]] writers (e.g. the rejection of the doctrines of the trinity, [[pre-existence of Christ]], immortal souls, a literal hell of fire, original sin)<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Pope  | first = Hugh  | contribution = Socinianism  | year = 1912  | title = The Catholic Encyclopedia  | editor-last =   | editor-first =  | volume = 14  | place = New York  | publisher =  Robert Appleton Company  | contribution-url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14113a.htm  | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref> Early English Unitarian writings also correspond closely to those of Christadelphians. Also, recent discoveries and research have shown a large similarity between Christadelphian beliefs and those held by [[Isaac Newton#Religious views|Isaac Newton]] who, among other things, rejected the doctrines of the trinity, immortal souls, a personal devil and literal demons. Even with most source writings of those later considered "heretics" destroyed, evidence can be provided that since the 1st century CE there have been various groups and individuals who have held certain individual Christadelphian beliefs or similar ones.

For example:
* The typical Old Testament belief in unconsciousness till resurrection,<ref>The Christadelphian understanding of Daniel 12:2, etc.<p>{{*}}‘Barr is surely right to stress that the Genesis story as it now stands indicates that humans were not created immortal, but had (and lost) the chance to gain unending life.’, Wright, ‘The Resurrection of the Son of God’, p. 92 (2003); Wright himself actually interprets some passages of Scripture as indicating alternative beliefs, ‘The Bible offers a spectrum of belief about life after death’,Wright, ‘The Resurrection of the Son of God’, p. 129 (2003)<p>{{*}}‘In contrast to the two enigmatic references to Enoch and Elijah, there are ample references to the fact that death is the ultimate destiny for all human beings, that God has no contact with or power over the dead, and that the dead do not have any relationship with God (see, inter alia, Ps. 6:6, 30:9–10, 39:13–14, 49:6–13, 115:16–18, 146:2–4). If there is a conceivable setting for the introduction of a doctrine of the afterlife, it would be in Job, since Job, although righteous, is harmed by God in the present life. But Job 10:20–22 and 14:1–10 affirm the opposite.’, Gillman, ‘Death and Afterlife, Judaic Doctrines Of’, in Neusner, ‘The Encyclopedia of Judaism’, volume 1, p. 176 (2000)<p>{{*}}‘ “Who knows whether the breath of human beings rises up and the breath of an animal sinks down to the earth?” (Eccles 3:21).

Organised worship in England for those whose beliefs anticipated those of Christadelphians only truly became possible in 1779 when the [[Act of Toleration 1689]] was amended to permit denial of the Trinity, and only fully when property penalties were removed in the [[Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813]].

== Modern mainstream theology developing similar beliefs ==
Over the last 100 years some mainstream Christian theologians and Biblical scholars have gradually been developing beliefs which the Christadelphian community has historically held. Example areas are satan and demons; the atonement; justification; heaven and hell; the state of the dead.

* '''The state of the dead''': The majority of standard scholarly Jewish and Christian sources today describe the state of the dead in terms identical or very close to the Christadelphian view.<ref>‘For a Hebrew, ‘soul’ indicated the unity of a human person; Hebrews were living bodies, they did not have bodies. This Hebrew field of meaning is breached in the Wisdom of Solomon by explicit introduction of Greek ideas of soul. A dualism of soul and body is present: ‘a perishable body weighs down the soul’ (9:15). This perishable body is opposed by an immortal soul (3:1-3). Such dualism might imply that soul is superior to body. In the nt, ‘soul’ retains its basic Hebrew field of meaning. Soul refers to one’s life: Herod sought Jesus’ soul (Matt. 2:20); one might save a soul or take it (Mark 3:4). Death occurs when God ‘requires your soul’ (Luke 12:20). ‘Soul’ may refer to the whole person, the self: ‘three thousand souls’ were converted in Acts 2:41 (see Acts 3:23). Although the Greek idea of an immortal soul different in kind from the mortal body is not evident, ‘soul’ denotes the existence of a person after death (see Luke 9:25; 12:4; 21:19); yet Greek influence may be found in 1 Peter’s remark about ‘the salvation of souls’ (1:9). A moderate dualism exists in the contrast of spirit with body and even soul, where ‘soul’ means life that is not yet caught up in grace. See also ‘Flesh and Spirit; Human Being’, Neyrey, ‘Soul’, in Achtemeier, Harper, & Row (eds.), ‘Harper’s Bible Dictionary’, pp. 982-983 (1st ed. 1985)<p>{{*}}‘Indeed, the salvation of the “immortal soul” has sometimes been a commonplace in preaching, but it is fundamentally unbiblical. Biblical anthropology is not dualistic but monistic: human being consists in the integrated wholeness of body and soul, and the Bible never contemplates the disembodied existence of the soul in bliss.’, Myers (ed.), ‘The Eerdmans Bible Dictionary’, p. 518 (1987)<p>{{*}}‘A particular instance of the Heb. avoidance of dualism is the biblical doctrine of man. Greek thought, and in consequence many Hellenizing Jewish and Christian sages, regarded the body as a prison-house of the soul: sōma sēma ‘the body is a tomb’. The aim of the sage was to achieve deliverance from all that is bodily and thus liberate the soul. But to the Bible man is not a soul in a body but a body/soul unity; so true is this that even in the resurrection, although flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, we shall still have bodies (1 Cor. 15:35ff.).’, Cressey, ‘Dualism’, in Cressey, Wood, & Marshall (eds.), ‘New Bible Dictionary’, p. 284 (3rd. ed. 1996)<p>{{*}}‘Even as we are conscious of the broad and very common biblical usage of the term “soul,” we must be clear that Scripture does not present even a rudimentarily developed theology of the soul. The creation narrative is clear that all life originates with God. Yet the Hebrew Scripture offers no specific understanding of the origin of individual souls, of when and how they become attached to specific bodies, or of their potential existence, apart from the body, after death. The reason for this is that, as we noted at the beginning, the Hebrew Bible does not present a theory of the soul developed much beyond the simple concept of a force associated with respiration, hence, a life-force.’, Avery-Peck, ‘Soul’, in Neusner, et al. (eds.), ‘The Encyclopedia of Judaism’, p. 1343 (2000)<p>{{*}}‘Gn. 2:7 refers to God forming Adam ‘from the dust of the ground’ and breathing ‘into his nostrils the breath of life’, so that man becomes a ‘living being’. The word ‘being’ translates the Hebrew word nep̄eš which, though often translated by the Eng. word ‘soul’, ought not to be interpreted in the sense suggested by Hellenistic thought (see Platonism; Soul, Origin of). It should rather be understood in its own context within the OT as indicative of men and women as living beings or persons in relationship to God and other people. The lxx translates this Heb. word nep̄eš with the Gk. word psychē, which explains the habit of interpreting this OT concept in the light of Gk. use of psychē. Yet it is surely more appropriate to understand the use of psychē (in both the lxx and the NT) in the light of the OT’s use of nep̄eš. According to Gn. 2, any conception of the soul as a separate (and separable) part or division of our being would seem to be invalid. Similarly, the popular debate concerning whether human nature is a bipartite or tripartite being has the appearance of a rather ill-founded and unhelpful irrelevancy. The human person is a ‘soul’ by virtue of being a ‘body’ made alive by the ‘breath’ (or ‘Spirit’) of God.’, Ferguson & Packer (eds.),’New Dictionary of Theology’, pp. 28-29 (electronic ed. 2000)<p>{{*}}‘Far from referring simply to one aspect of a person, “soul” refers to the whole person. Thus, a corpse is referred to as a “dead soul,” even though the word is usually translated “dead body” (Lev. 21:11; Num. 6:6). “Soul” can also refer to a person’s very life itself 1 Kgs. 19:4; Ezek. 32:10).“Soul” often refers by extension to the whole person.’, Carrigan, ‘Soul’, Freedman, Myers, & Beck (eds.) ‘Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible’, p. 1245 (2000)<p>{{*}}‘There is no suggestion in the OT of the transmigration of the soul as an immaterial, immortal entity. Man is a unity of body and soul—terms that describe not so much two separate entities in a person as much as one person from different standpoints.

This implies that man is composed of soul and body, and the Bible makes it plain that this is so.

The majority have held that immortality also includes continuing existence of the soul or person between death and resurrection. Almost every detail of this general confession and its biblical basis, however, has been disputed. The debate has been fueled by the development of beliefs about the afterlife within the Bible itself and the variety of language in which they are expressed. The Hebrew Bible does not present the human soul (nepeš) or spirit (rûah) as an immortal substance, and for the most part it envisions the dead as ghosts in Sheol, the dark, sleepy underworld. Nevertheless it expresses hope beyond death (see Pss. 23 and 49:15) and eventually asserts physical resurrection (see Isa. 26:19; Dan. 12:2).’, Cooper, ‘Immortality’, in Fahlbusch & Bromiley (eds.), ‘The Encyclopedia of Christianity’, volume 2, p. (2003)<p>{{*}}‘soul. The idea of a distinction between the soul, the immaterial principle of life and intelligence, and the body is of great antiquity, though only gradually expressed with any precision. Hebrew thought made little of this distinction, and there is practically no specific teaching on the subject in the Bible beyond an underlying assumption of some form of afterlife (see immortality)., Cross & Livingstone, (eds.), ‘The Oxford dictionary of the Christian Church’, p. 1531 (3rd rev. ed. 2005)<p>{{*}}‘The English translation of nepeš by the term “soul” has too often been misunderstood as teaching a bipartite (soul and body—dichotomy) or tripartite (body, soul, and spirit—trichotomy) anthropology. Equally misleading is the interpretation that too radically separates soul from body as in the Greek view of human nature. See body; spirit. N. Porteous (in IDB, 4:428) states it well when he says, “The Hebrew could not conceive of a disembodied nepeš, though he could use nepeš with or without the adjective ‘dead,’ for corpse (e.g., Lev. 19:28; Num. 6:6).” Or as R. B. Laurin has suggested, “To the Hebrew, man was not a ‘body’ and a ‘soul,’ but rather a ‘body-soul,’ a unit of vital power” (BDT, 492). In this connection, the most significant text is Gen. 2:7, “the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life [nišmat hayyîm], and the man became a living being [nepeš hayyâ]” (the KJV rendering “living soul” is misleading).’, Lake, ‘Soul’, in Silva & Tenney (eds.), ‘The Zondervan Encyclopedia of the Bible’, volume 5, p. 586 (rev. ed. 2009)</ref>

* '''The atonement''': The majority Christian interpretation of the [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselmian]]-[[John Calvin|Calvinist]] doctrine of the atonement as [[penal substitution]] has been criticized in mainstream Christianity since the 19th century,<ref>'The character of the needed reform became more and more clear : Christian thought must be brought over from the point of view of law to that of the conscience, it must be raised from legality to morality. Those even who wished to adhere as far as possible to the tradition of the past, tried to find a new foundation for the doctrine of substitution in the moral fact of solidarity. They gave up justifying the expiatory condemnation of Christ on the plea that divine justice must be satisfied; they were content to insist upon the organic bond which united the Son of man with the whole race. This method of argumentation, the first sketch of which was given by Ch. Secretan, and which was powerfully developed by so many orators, among whom should be mentioned E. Bersier, Ed. de Pressense, and Ch. Bois, has the advantage of being modem; but it remains to be seen whether, from a logical point of view, the argument does not ruin the ancient edifice it was destined to support.', Sabatier, 'The Doctrine of the Atonement: And Its Historical Evolution and Religion; and, Religion and Modern Culture ', pp. 92-93 (1904)<p>{{*}}‘But new challenges to the position arose in the modern period and were accepted by more and more churches. Able apologists for the penal substitutionary view also defended and developed that position against these new theories.’, Allison, ‘History of the Doctrine of the Atonement’, Southern Baptist Journal of Theology ( 11.2.15), 2007)</ref> resulting in increasing rejection of traditional penal substitution.<ref>‘In the twenty-first century, the doctrine of the atonement has come under fierce attack. Particularly singled out for criticism is the penal-substitutionary theory because, according to its detractors, it privileges one (outmoded) metaphor of the atonement, it fosters passivity in the face of evil and oppression, and it even encourages child abuse. Some evangelicals, disturbed by these criticisms, have sought to revise the traditional doctrine. Many evangelicals, however, rehearse and defend the penal substitutionary model.’, Allison, ‘History of the Doctrine of the Atonement’, Southern Baptist Journal of Theology ( 11.2.16-17), 2007)</ref> The Christadelphian distinction between representation and substitution has been noted in the relevant scholarly literature,<ref>'Christadelphian writers point to the fact that there is a great difference between a 'representative' and a 'substitute'. A representative, they hold, is not disconnected from those represented, whereas a substitute performs a role instead of those for whom he or she is substitute.', Scotland, 'Sectarian Religion in Contemporary Britain', p. 49 (2000)</ref> and representative participation (an interpretation long held by Christadelphians)<ref>‘The true believer is in Christ “for the obtaining of the blessings promised,” it is true, but his obtainment thereof is strictly subject to his recognition of the means by which they were “purchased.” The first act he is called upon to perform is a participation in those means, viz., the death of Christ.’, Roberts, ‘Answers to Correspondents’, Christadelphian Magazine (7.67.23), 1870<p>{{*}}‘Therefore, in the very act of putting on the name of Christ “for the obtaining of the blessings promised,” he is made to endorse and morally participate in the “condemnation of sin in the flesh,” which Jesus underwent in the “body preared” for the purpose.— (Heb. 10:5.) ’ , ibid.<p>{{*}}‘By this three-fold preparation, entering within the circle of righteousness, participation in the one great sacrifice, and “the washing of water by the Word,” we antitypically enter into the Holy place, where the candlestick was to be seen in the type.’, WHB, ‘The Temple Exhibition’, Christadelphian Magazine (44.522.540), 1907<p>{{*}}‘This, then, is the way of approach to God—by voluntary entrance into Christ and a participation in his death.

But at least they help convey the sense of a continuing identification with Christ in, through, and beyond his death, which, as we shall see, is fundamental to Paul’s soteriology.’,  Dunn, ‘The Theology of Paul the Apostle’, p. 223 (2006)<p>{{*}}‘In the Roman Church, after the critique by Sabourin and Lyonnet and under the climate created by Teilhard de Chardin and Rahner, few scholars of note, if any, have maintained it.

In their later writings Moltmann and Pannenberg have come closer to evangelical language. However, Moltmann denies that God’s wrath was appeased (25–26), and Pannenberg, despite strong statements of penal substitution (425–27), claims that “the reconciling death of Christ is not a payment that Christ made to God in place of others” (429; 448, against “satisfaction”).’, Vanhoozer, et al (eds.), 'Dictionary for theological interpretation of the Bible', p. 73 (2005)<p>{{*}}'Sanders goes so far as to argue that "the purpose of Christ's death [for Paul is] that Christians may participate in it, not that their sins may be atoned for.".', Finlan, 'The background and content of Paul's cultic atonement metaphors', p. 117 (2004)<p>{{*}}'On the other hand, the New Testament leaves no doubt that atonement is accomplished through the believer’s participation with the Lord in his death rather than merely by Christ’s death on the cross (Rom. 6:2, 6, 8; cf.

== Practices and worship ==
[[File:Christadelphian Chapel Sign.JPG|thumb | A sign showing the service times of a Christadelphian ecclesia in [[Buffalo, New York]].]]
Christadelphians are organised into local congregations, that commonly call themselves ''ecclesias'',<ref name="hyndman">{{cite book | last =Hyndman  | first =Rob | title =The Christadelphians (Brothers and Sisters in Christ): Introducing a Bible-based Community | publisher =Bethel Publications | year =1999 | location =Beechworth, VIC | url =http://robjhyndman.com/christadelphians/ | isbn =81-87409-34-7 }}</ref> which is taken from usage in the New Testament<ref>e.g. see Greek of Acts 5:11; 7:38</ref> and is Greek for ''gathering of those summoned''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ecclesia |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |date=3 February 2009 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/177746/Ecclesia |accessdate= }}</ref> Congregational worship, which usually takes place on Sunday, centres on the remembrance of the death and celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ by the taking part in the "memorial service". Additional meetings are often organised for worship, prayer, preaching and Bible study.

Ecclesias are typically involved in preaching the gospel ([[evangelism]]) in the form of public lectures on Bible teaching,<ref>Examples of lecture titles on [http://www.handsworth-cdelph.co.uk/ Handsworth Christadelphians] website</ref> college-style seminars on reading the Bible,<ref>For example: [http://www.biblecourse.f9.co.uk/ Learn to Read the Bible Effectively]</ref> and Bible Reading Groups. Correspondence courses<ref>For example: [http://www.thisisyourbible.com/pages/course.php This is Your Bible]</ref> are also used widely, particularly in areas where there is no established Christadelphian presence. Some ecclesias, organisations or individuals also preach through other media like video,<ref>For example: Christadelphian Auxiliary Lecturing Society (CALS) [http://www.christadelphian.org/videos.htm videos], Williamsburgh Christadelphian Foundation (WCF) [http://www.wcfoundation.org/res/videolauncher.htm videos], the Christadelphians of Southern California's [http://thisisyourbible.org/video.asp videos], and Christadelphian [http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=youpreach YouPreach] on [[YouTube]].</ref> podcasts<ref>For example: [http://washwoodheath.thepositiveword.com/index.php?cat=Proclamation Washwood Heath] Christadelphians' podcasts, [http://biblestudypodcast.wordpress.com Bible Study Podcasts] and [http://www.searchforhope.org/podcasts Search for Hope] podcasts.</ref> and internet forums.<ref>For example: [http://www.openbibleforum.org/forums/index.php?act=home Open Bible Forum], [http://www.thechristadelphians.org/forums/ Bible Discussion Forum] and [http://www.btdf.org/forums/ Bible Truth Discussion Forum]</ref> There are also a number of Bible Education/Learning Centres around the world.<ref>For example, the [http://www.biblelearningcentre.org/nottingham/ Bible Learning Centre] in the [[Westfield Broadmarsh|Broadmarsh Shopping Centre]], [[Nottingham]] (UK); [[Solihull]] [http://www.biblelearningcentre.org/sol_blc/ Bible Learning Centre] (UK); [[Dandenong, Victoria|Dandenong]] [http://biblecourses.com.au/ Bible Education Centre], [[Melbourne]] (Aus.); [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]] [http://www.castlehillbec.org.au/ Bible Education Centre], [[Sydney]] (Aus.); [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]] [http://liverpoolbec.org.au/ Bible Education Centre], [[South-western Sydney]] (Aus.); the [http://www.mustardseedbec.org.au/ Mustard Seed Bible Education Centre], [[Adelaide]] (Aus.); [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]] [http://bibleeducationcenter.org/ Bible Education Center], [[Champaign County, Illinois]] (USA); [[Durban]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1NXKf0yrM Bible Education Centre] (SA).

Only baptised (by complete immersion in water) believers are considered members of the ecclesia. Ordinarily, baptism follows someone making a "good confession" (cf. 1 Tim. 6:12) of their faith before two or three nominated elders of the ecclesia they are seeking to join. The good confession has to demonstrate a basic understanding of the main elements - "first principles" - of the faith of the community. The children of members are encouraged to attend Christadelphian [[Sunday Schools]] and youth groups. Interaction between youth from different ecclesias is encouraged through regional and national youth gatherings. Many ecclesias organise holidays for young people, the most popular form in the UK being [[camping]] holidays and Youth Weekends such as Swanwick and others locally organised by different ecclesias.

Christadelphians understand the Bible to teach that male and female believers are equal in God's sight, and also that there is a distinction between the roles of male and female members.<ref>{{Citation

 | url = http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/wpriests.htm}}</ref> Women are typically not eligible to teach in formal gatherings of the ecclesia when male believers are present, are expected to cover their heads (using hat or scarf, etc.) during formal services, and do not sit on the main ecclesial arranging (organising) committees. They do, however: participate in other ecclesial and inter-ecclesial committees; participate in discussions; teach children in Sunday Schools as well as at home, teach other women and non-members; perform music; discuss and vote on business matters; and engage in the majority of other activities. Generally, at formal ecclesial and inter-ecclesial meetings the women wear head coverings when there are acts of worship and prayer.

There are ecclesially-accountable committees for co-ordinated [[evangelism|preaching]], youth and Sunday School work, [[conscientious objection]] issues, care of the elderly, and humanitarian work. These do not have any legislative authority, and are wholly dependent upon ecclesial support. Ecclesias in an area may regularly hold joint activities combining youth groups, fellowship, preaching, and Bible study.

Christadelphians refuse to participate in any military (and Police forces) because they are conscientious objectors.<ref name="gospelandstrife">{{cite book | last =Norris | first =Alfred | title =The Gospel and Strife | publisher =Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/norris_gospelandstrife.doc}}</ref><ref name="warandpolitics">{{cite book | last =Watkins | first =Peter | title =War and Politics: The Christian's Duty | publisher =Christadelphian Auxiliary Lecturing Society | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/watkins_warandpoliticsthechristiansduty.doc }}</ref>

Christadelphians do not vote in political elections, as they take direction from Romans 13:1-4, which they interpret as meaning that God puts into power those leaders He deems worthy.  To vote for a candidate that does not win an election would be considered to vote against God's will.  To avoid the risk of such conflict, Christadelphians abstain from voting.

There is a strong emphasis on personal Bible reading and study<ref>'They are characterized by holding a firm belief in the inspired status of the Bible and place enormous emphasis upon biblical study', Evans, John S, 'The Prophecies of Daniel 2', page 251, USA:Xulon Press (2008)<p>{{*}}'Christadelphian devotion centers on daily Bible study and weekly meetings', page 421, Fahlbusch, Erwin and Bromiley, Geoffrey W, 'The Encyclopedia of Christianity', USA:Wm.

=== Hymnody and music ===
Christadelphians are a [[liturgy|non-liturgical]] denomination. Christadelphian ecclesias are autonomous and free to adopt whatever pattern of worship they choose. However, in the English-speaking world, there tends to be a great deal of uniformity in order of service and [[hymn]]ody.

Christadelphian hymnody makes considerable use of the hymns of the Anglican and British Protestant traditions (even in US ecclesias the hymnody is typically more British than American). In many Christadelphian hymn books a sizeable proportion of hymns are drawn from the [[Psalter|Scottish Psalter]] and non-Christadelphian hymn-writers including [[Isaac Watts]], [[Charles Wesley]], [[William Cowper]] and [[John Newton]].  Despite incorporating non-Christadelphian hymns however, Christadelphian hymnody preserves the essential teachings of the community.<ref>'Hymnody was an important part of Christadelphianism from its beginning, and, along with the journal, The Christadelphian, gave independent ecclesias a broader fellowship. Hymns reflected the essential doctrines and principles of their faith. These principles were anti-Trinitarianism. They also believed that God would establish his kingdom on earth through the return of Jesus to reign a thousand years in Jerusalem', Wesley Roberts, Professor of Music, Campbellsville University, Kentucky, in the magazine 'Hymn', July 1997</ref>

The earliest hymn book published was the "Sacred Melodist" which was published by [[Benjamin Wilson (Biblical scholar)|Benjamin Wilson]] in Geneva, Illinois in 1860.<ref>{{cite book |first=Rachel |last=Hocking |title=A Study of Christadelphian Hymnody: singing with the spirit and with the understanding |date=2000, 7 |url= http://sites.google.com/site/rachelhockingsite/articles/christadelphian-hymnody |accessdate= }}</ref> The next was the hymn book published for the use of ''Baptised Believers in the Kingdom of God'' (an early name for Christadelphians)<ref name = "anrvrv">Peter Hemingray, ''John Thomas: His Friends and His Faith'' 2003 p. 235</ref> by George Dowie in Edinburgh in 1864.<ref>Andrew Wilson, ''History of the Christadelphians 1864–1885: the emergence of a denomination'' 1997 p. 326</ref> In 1865 [[Robert Roberts (Christadelphian)|Robert Roberts]] published a collection of Scottish psalms and hymns called ''The Golden Harp'' (which was subtitled "Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, compiled for the use of Immersed Believers in 'The Things concerning the Kingdom of God and the Name of Jesus Christ'").<ref>Peter Hemingray, ''John Thomas: His Friends and His Faith'' 2003 p. 195</ref> This was replaced only five years later by the first "Christadelphian Hymn Book" (1869), compiled by J. J. and A. Andrew,<ref>Ambassador of the Coming Age Vol. 6, P. 148</ref> and this was revised and expanded in 1874, 1932 and 1964. A thorough revision by the Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association resulted in the latest (2002) edition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thechristadelphian.com/acatalog/2002HymnBooks.html |title=The CMPA online bookshop |publisher=Thechristadelphian.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> which is almost universally used by English-speaking Christadelphian ecclesias. In addition some Christadelphian fellowships have published their own hymn books.

A more contemporary worship style is now popular in some quarters. The ''Praise the Lord'' songbook<ref>''Praise the Lord'' (Hoddesdon Christadelphian Service, 1993, 2000)</ref> was produced with the aim of making contemporary songs which are consistent with Christadelphian theology more widely available.  This book is either used as a supplement to the more traditional Hymn Book or is used in place of the traditional Hymn Book. Another publication, the "Worship" book<ref>{{cite web |title=Worship |work=Worship Book Committee, NCC, 2008, 2010 |url=http://www.theworshipbook.com |publisher=Theworshipbook.com |date= |accessdate= }}</ref> is a compilation of songs and hymns that have been composed only by members of the Christadelphian community. This book was produced with the aim of providing extra music for non-congregational music items within services (e.g. voluntaries, meditations, etc) but has been adopted by congregations worldwide and is now used to supplement congregational repertoire.

In the English-speaking world, worship is typically accompanied by organ or piano, though in recent years a few ecclesias have promoted the use of other instruments (e.g. strings, wind and brass as mentioned in the Psalms). This trend has also seen the emergence of some Christadelphian bands<ref>An example is the Christadelphian folk rock band [[Fisher's Tale]] (albeit this is a witness project as opposed to being for the purpose of church worship)</ref> and the establishment of the Christadelphian Art Trust to support performing, visual and dramatic arts within the Christadelphian community.

In other countries, hymnbooks have been produced in local languages,<ref>e.g. ''Liedboek van de Broeders in Christus'' (Holland, circa 1980)</ref> sometimes resulting in styles of worship which reflect the local culture.  It has been noted that Christadelphian hymnody has historically been a consistent witness to Christadelphian beliefs, and that hymnody occupies a significant role in the community.<ref>'Considering the scope of hymnic literature by Christadelphians, we might conclude that few branches of Christianity can claim such a close relationship between hymn writing and their own religious development, and such a high percentage of hymnists in their membership.  As their hymns become better known, this close relationship will reveal that the heritage and faith of Christadelphians has been enhanced through a strong emphasis on hymnody, from their beginnings to the present day', Wesley Roberts, Professor of Music, Campbellsville University, Kentucky, in the magazine 'Hymn', July 1997</ref>
