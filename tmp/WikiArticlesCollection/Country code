'''Country codes''' are short alphabetic or numeric [[geography|geographical]] [[code]]s ([[geocode]]s) developed to represent [[country|countries]] and [[dependent area]]s, for use in [[data processing]] and [[communication]]s. Several different systems have been developed to do this. The best known of these is [[ISO 3166-1]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The term ''country code'' frequently refers to international dialing codes, the [[E.164]] [[list of country calling codes|country calling codes]].

==ISO 3166-1==
{{main|ISO 3166-1}}

This standard defines for most of the countries and dependent areas in the world:
*a two-letter ([[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]])
*a three-letter ([[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]]), and
*a three-digit numeric ([[ISO 3166-1 numeric]]) code.

The two-letter codes are used as the basis for some other codes or applications, for example,
*for [[ISO 4217]] [[currency]] codes and
*with deviations, for country code [[top-level domain]] names (ccTLDs) on the Internet: [[list of Internet TLDs]].
For more applications see [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]].

==Other country codes==
*[[European Union]]:
**Before the [[Enlargement of the European Union|2004 EU enlargement]] the EU used the UN Road Traffic Conventions [[List of international license plate codes|license plate codes]]; since then, it uses [[ISO 3166-1]]
**The ''[[Nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques]]'' (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics, NUTS) of the [[European Union]], mostly focusing on subdivisions of the EU member states
*[[FIFA]] (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) assigns a three-letter code (dubbed FIFA Trigramme) to each of its member and non-member countries: [[List of FIFA country codes]]
*[[Federal Information Processing Standard]] (FIPS) [[FIPS 10-4|10-4]] defined two-letter codes used by the U.S. government and in the [[CIA World Factbook]]: [[list of FIPS country codes]]. On September 2, 2008, FIPS 10-4 was one of ten standards withdrawn by [[NIST]] as a Federal Information Processing Standard.<ref>''Federal Register'', September 2, 2008 (Volume 73, Number 170), page 51276</ref>
* [[GOST 7.67]]: country codes in [[Cyrillic]] from the [[GOST]] standards committee
*From the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO):
**[[Aircraft Registration#List of countries/regions and their registration prefixes and patterns|The national prefixes used in aircraft registration numbers]]
**[[International Civil Aviation Organization#Registered codes|Location prefixes]] in four-character [[ICAO airport code]]s
*[[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) three-letter codes used in sporting events: [[list of IOC country codes]]
*From the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU):
**the [[E.164]] international telephone dialing codes: [[list of country calling codes]] with 1-3 digits,
**the [[IMSI|E.212]] [[mobile country codes]] (MCC), for mobile/wireless phone addresses,
**the first few characters of call signs of radio stations (maritime, aeronautical, [[amateur radio]], broadcasting, and so on) define the country: the [[ITU prefix]],
**[[ITU letter codes]] for member-countries,
**[[ITU prefix - amateur and experimental stations]] - The [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU) assigns national telecommuncation prefixes for [[amateur radio|amateur]] and experimental radio use, so that operators can be identified by their country of origin. These prefixes are legally administered by the national entity to which prefix ranges are assigned.
**Three-digit codes used to identify countries in maritime mobile radio transmissions, known as [[maritime identification digits]]
*[[License plate]]s for automobiles:
**Under the 1949 and 1968 United Nations Road Traffic Conventions (distinguishing signs of vehicles in international traffic): [[List of international license plate codes]].<ref>[http://www.unece.org/trans/conventn/Distsigns_Sept2003.pdf UNECE.org]</ref>
**[[Diplomatic license plates in the United States]], assigned by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]].
*[[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) used two-letter codes of its own: [[list of NATO country codes]]. They were largely borrowed from the FIPS 10-4 codes mentioned below. In 2003 the eighth edition of the Standardisation Agreement (STANAG) adopted the ISO 3166 three-letter codes with one exception (the code for Macedonia). With the ninth edition, NATO is transitioning to four- and six-letter codes based on ISO 3166 with a few exceptions and additions
*[[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) also has its own list of [[List of UNDP country codes|trigram country codes]]
* [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO): [[WIPO ST.3]] gives two-letter codes to countries and regional intellectual property organizations
*[[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) has its own list of country codes, used in reporting meteorological observations
* UIC (the [[International Union of Railways]]): [[UIC Country Code]]s

The developers of ISO 3166 intended that in time it would replace other coding systems in existence.

==Other codings==
The following can represent countries:
*The initial digits of International Standard Book Numbers ([[ISBN]]) are group identifiers for countries, areas, or language regions.
*The first three digits of [[GS1]] Company Prefixes used to identify products, for example, in [[barcode]]s, designate (national) numbering agencies.
