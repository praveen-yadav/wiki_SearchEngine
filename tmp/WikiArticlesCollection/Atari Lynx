The '''Atari Lynx''' is a 16-bit [[handheld game console]] that was released by [[Atari Corporation]] in September 1989. The Lynx holds the distinction of being the world's first [[handheld electronic game]] with a [[color]] [[LCD]]. The system is also notable for its forward-looking features, advanced graphics, and [[ambidextrous]] layout. As part of the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|fourth generation of gaming]], the Lynx competed with [[Nintendo]]'s [[Game Boy]] (released just a month earlier), the [[Sega Game Gear]] and [[NEC]]'s [[TurboExpress]], both released the following year. However, the Game Boy in particular, as well as the Sega Game Gear, outsold the Lynx. Atari failed to achieve the sale numbers required to attract quality third party developers and the Lynx was eventually abandoned.

Today, as with many older consoles, there is still a small group of devoted fans, creating and selling games for the system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atariage.com/company_page.html?SystemID=LYNX&CompanyID=92 |title=Atari Age Self Published Lynx Games |publisher=atariage.com}}</ref>

==Features==
The Atari Lynx has several innovative features including it being the first color handheld, with a backlit display, a switchable right-handed/left-handed (upside down) configuration, and the ability to network with up to 17 other units via its "Comlynx" system (though most games would network eight or fewer players). [[Comlynx]] was originally developed to run over infrared links (and was codenamed RedEye). This was changed to a cable-based networking system before the final release.

The Lynx was also the first gaming console with [[Graphics processing unit|hardware]] support for zooming/distortion of [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], allowing fast [[pseudo-3D]] games and a capacity for drawing filled polygons with limited CPU intervention. ''[[Blue Lightning]]'', a game with ''[[After Burner]]''-like graphics, was featured in TV advertising for the console.

The Atari Lynx was the first console to feature integrated math and graphics co-processors (including a [[Blitter]] unit) which aided in hardware scaling and rotation of graphical elements, over a year before the Super Nintendo, which was unable to scale sprites and confined to the limits of [[Mode 7]].

The games were originally meant to be loaded from [[Compact Cassette|tape]], but were later changed to load from ROM. The game data still needed to be copied from ROM to RAM before it could be used, so less memory was available and the games loaded relatively slowly.<ref name="retrogamer">{{cite journal |author=Peter Latimer |year=2005 |month=July |title=Atari Lynx |journal=Retro Gamer |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=Pages 24–31 |issn=1742-3155 }}</ref>

== History ==
The Lynx was the second handheld game with the Atari name to actually be produced. The first was Atari Inc.'s [[handheld electronic game]] [[Touch Me (arcade game)|Touch Me]]. Atari Inc. had previously worked on several other handheld projects including the ''[[Breakout (arcade game)|Breakout]]'', ''[[Space Invaders]]'', and the [[Atari Cosmos]] portable/tabletop console. However, those projects were shut down during development, some just short of their intended commercial release.

The Lynx system was originally developed by [[Epyx]] as the '''Handy Game'''. Planning and design of the console began in 1986 and was completed in 1987.<ref name="retrogamer"/> Epyx first showed the Handy system at the Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) in January 1989. Facing financial difficulties, Epyx sought out partners. Atari Corp. and Epyx eventually agreed that Atari Corp. would handle production and marketing, while Epyx would handle software development.

Atari Corp. changed the internal speaker and removed the thumb-stick on the control pad before releasing it as the Lynx, initially retailing in the US at US$179.95. Atari Corp. then showed the Lynx to the press at the Summer 1989 CES as the "Portable Color Entertainment System", which was changed to Lynx when actual consoles were distributed to resellers.<ref name="retrogamer"/>

However, [[Nintendo]]'s new [[Game Boy]] was also introduced at the 1989 CES. At $90, it was much less expensive than the Lynx, without the color or custom chips. Nintendo had no problems supplying retailers with the Game Boy for the Christmas season while Atari Corp. managed only limited distribution of their Lynx by year's end.

During 1990, the Lynx had moderate sales but Nintendo's Game Boy continued to gain market share. In 1991, Atari Corp. relaunched the Lynx with a new marketing campaign, new packaging, slightly improved hardware, better battery life and a new sleek look. The new system (referred to within Atari Corp. as the "Lynx II") featured rubber hand grips and a clearer backlit color screen with a power save option (which turned off the LCD panel's backlighting). It also replaced the monaural headphone jack of the original Lynx with one wired for stereo. The new packaging made the Lynx available without any accessories, dropping the price to $99. Although sales improved, Nintendo still dominated the handheld market.

As with the actual console units, the game cartridges themselves evolved over the first year of the console's release. The first generation of cartridges were flat, and were designed to be stackable for ease of storage. However, this design proved to be very difficult to remove from the console and was replaced by a second design. This style, called "tabbed" or "ridged", used the same basic design as the original cartridges with the addition of two small tabs on the cartridge's underside to aid in removal. The original flat style cartridges could be stacked on top of the newer cartridges, but the newer cartridges could not be easily stacked on each other, nor were they stored easily. Thus a third style, the "curved lip" style was produced, and all official and third-party cartridges during the console's lifespan were released (or re-released) using this style.<ref>[http://www.atariage.com/system_labels.html?SystemID=LYNX Atari Lynx] cartridge style illustrations at AtariAge.com.</ref>

In May 1991, [[Sega]] launched its [[Game Gear]] portable gaming handheld. Also a color handheld, in comparison to the Lynx it had a higher cost and shorter battery life (3–4 hours as opposed to 4-5 for the Lynx), but it was less bulky and was backed up by significantly more games. In North America the Game Gear took second place, and while in Europe sales of the Lynx were initially quite strong on the back of the popular [[Atari ST]], it still could not compete with the software library of the Game Gear and was pushed into third place. Retailers such as [[Game (retailer)|Game]] and [[Toys R Us]] continued to sell the Lynx well into the mid-90s on the back of the [[Atari Jaguar]] launch, helped by magazines such as ''[[Ultimate Future Games]]'' who continued to cover the Lynx alongside the new generation of 32-bit and 64-bit consoles.

US sales in 1990 were approximately 500,000 units according to the [[Associated Press]]<ref name="1990 sales">{{cite press release|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1991/Sega-Woos-Game-Boy-Lynx-Users-With-32-Color-Hand-Held-Video-System/id-a1288531efff2f9504f70dbcd9f8b6cc |title=Sega Woos Game Boy, Lynx Users With 32-Color, Hand-Held Video System |accessdate=November 7, 2013 |publisher=[[Associated Press]]| date =January 4, 1991|author=Catalina Ortiz}}</ref> and lifetime sales amounted to less than 7&nbsp;million units when combined with the Game Gear. On the other hand, the Game Boy sold 16 million units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950105&slug=2097913 |title=Virtual Fun - Nintendo Adds A New Dimension To Games |accessdate=November 7, 2013 |publisher=[[Seattle Times]]| date =January 5, 1995|author=Steven Kent}}</ref> [[1UP.com]] and [[GamePro]] stated overall sales were less than 500,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/day-history-atari-lynx-launches |title=This Day in History: The Atari Lynx Launches |accessdate=November 7, 2013 |publisher=[[1UP.com]]| date =May 7, 2010|author=Frank Cifaldi}}</ref><ref name="handheldgamepro2">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/125749.shtml|title=The 10 Worst-Selling Handhelds of All Time| accessdate=2008-07-05|first=Blake|last=Snow|publisher=[[GamePro]]|date=2007-07-30|page=2|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071013043037/http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/125749.shtml|archivedate=2007-10-13}}</ref>

In 1994, Atari Corp. shifted its focus away from the Lynx. As Nintendo's [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]] and Sega's [[Sega Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]] filled retailers' shelves, Atari Corp. refocused its efforts on its Jaguar console. A handful of games were released during this time, including ''Battlezone 2000''. In 1996, Atari shut down its internal game development.

Telegames released a number of games in the second half of the 1990s, including a port of ''[[Raiden (arcade game)|Raiden]]'' and a platformer called ''Fat Bobby'' in 1997, as well as an action sports game called ''Hyperdrome'' in 1999. At the end of the 1990s, Hasbro, the owners of the Atari properties at the time, released the rights to develop for the system to the public domain. Since then a number of independent developers released games into the new decade, like ''[[Championship Rally (Atari Lynx)|Championship Rally]]'', ''CyberVirus'', and ''Alpine Games''.<ref>[http://www.duranik.com Alpine Games by Duranik]</ref> Some of the late 90s/early 2000s games were under development by other companies at one time, but rights to the game programs and all of the existing code was bought and finished by other developers.<ref>[http://songbird-productions.com/cybervirus.shtml Songbird Productions'] development page for CyberVirus</ref>

In 2008 Atari was honored at the 59th Annual [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]]s for pioneering the development of [[handheld games]] with its Lynx game unit.<ref>http://www.gamespot.com/news/6184421.html</ref>

On October 24, 2009, North American company [[Super Fighter Team]] released ''[[Zaku (video game)|Zaku]]'', a horizontal shooter for the Lynx developed by PenguiNet. It was the first new game for the system since the 1990s whose game card has an authentic "curved lip" plastic shell instead of a custom bare circuit board.<ref>[http://www.zaku-lynx.com/ Official Zaku website]</ref>

==Reception==
Although it was innovative and unique for its time, gamers found the Atari Lynx to be quite large and bulky, even the 2nd version of the unit.

However, the game system was reviewed in 1990 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #155 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the Lynx 5 out of 5 stars, stating that it "throws the Gameboy into the prehistoric age", and praising the built-in object scaling capabilities, the multiplayer feature of the ComLynx cable, and the strong set of launch games.<ref name="Dragon155">{{cite journal
