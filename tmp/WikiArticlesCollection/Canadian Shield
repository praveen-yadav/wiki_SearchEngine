}}
The '''Canadian Shield''', also called the '''Laurentian Plateau''', or '''''Bouclier Canadien''''' (French), is a large area of exposed [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] and [[high-grade metamorphic rock]]s ([[geological shield]]) that forms the ancient geological core of the North American continent ([[North American craton|North American or Laurentia craton]]), covered by a thin layer of [[soil]].<ref name =EG>Essentials of Geology, 3rd ed, Stephen Marshak</ref> It is an area mostly composed of [[igneous rock]] which relates to its long volcanic history. It has a deep, common, joined [[bedrock]] region in Eastern and central [[Canada]] and stretches North from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Arctic Ocean]], covering over half of Canada; it also extends South into the Northern reaches of the United States. Human population is sparse, and industrial development is minimal,<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/65/ca/CanadSh.html Canadian Shield] - Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2005</ref> while mining is very prevalent.

== Geographical extent ==
The Canadian Shield is a [[Physiographic regions of the world|physiographic division]], consisting of five smaller physiographic provinces, the [[Laurentian Upland]], [[Kazan Region]], Davis, Hudson, and James.<ref name=ca-atlas>{{Cite web| authorlink =Atlas of Canada |title=Physiographic Regions Map|author=The Atlas of Canada |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |date=|url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/english/maps/reference/anniversary_maps/physiographicregions/map.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-12-27 }}</ref> The shield extends into the [[United States geology|United States]] as the [[Adirondack Mountains]] (connected by the [[Frontenac Axis]]) and the [[Superior Upland#The Superior Upland|Superior Upland]]. The Canadian Shield is U-shaped, but almost semi-circular, which yields an appearance of a [[warrior]]'s shield, and is a subsection of the Laurentia [[craton]] signifying the area of greatest [[glacial]] impact (scraping down to bare rock) creating the thin soils. The Canadian Shield is more than 3.96 billion years old. The Canadian Shield once had jagged peaks, higher than any of today's mountains, but millions of years of erosion have changed these mountains to rolling hills.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The Canadian Shield is a collage of [[Archean]] plates and accreted juvenile arc [[terrane]]s and [[sedimentary basin]]s of the [[Proterozoic]] Eon that were progressively amalgamated during the interval 2.45 to 1.24 [[Ga (unit)|Ga]], with the most substantial growth period occurring during the [[Trans-Hudson orogeny]], between ca. 1.90 to 1.80 Ga.<ref name=Corrigan>{{cite journal |author=Corrigan, D. |year=2008 |title=Metallogeny and Tectonic Evolution of the Trans-Hudson Orogen |url=http://www.pdac.ca/pdac/conv/2008/pdf-tech-session/ts-corrigan.pdf | accessdate =2008-03-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080409105436/http://www.pdac.ca/pdac/conv/2008/pdf-tech-session/ts-corrigan.pdf |archivedate = April 9, 2008}}</ref> The Canadian Shield was the first part of North America to be permanently elevated above sea level and has remained almost wholly untouched by successive encroachments of the sea upon the continent. It is the Earth's greatest area of exposed Archean rock. The [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] [[Rock (geology)|base rocks]] are mostly from the [[Precambrian]] [[Era (geology)|Era]] (between 4.5 billion and 540 million years ago), and have been repeatedly uplifted and eroded. Today it consists largely of an area of low relief {{convert|300|to|610|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level with a few [[monadnock]]s and low mountain ranges (including the [[Torngat Mountains|Torngat]] and [[Laurentian Mountains]]) probably eroded from the plateau during the [[Cenozoic]] Era. During the [[Pleistocene]] Epoch, continental ice sheets depressed the land surface (see [[Hudson Bay]]), scooped out thousands of lake basins, and carried away much of the region's soil.

When the [[Greenland]] section is included, the Shield is approximately circular, bounded on the northeast by the northeast edge of Greenland, with [[Hudson Bay]] in the middle. It covers much of Greenland, [[Labrador]], most of [[Quebec]] north of the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]], much of [[Ontario]] including northern sections of the southern peninsula between the [[Great Lakes]], the [[Adirondack Mountains]]<ref>Peterson Field Guide to Geology of Eastern North America by Roberts, David & Roger Tory Peterson.</ref> of northern [[New York]], the northernmost part of Lower [[Michigan]] and all of [[Upper Michigan]], northern [[Wisconsin]], northeastern [[Minnesota]], the central/northern portions of [[Manitoba]] away from Hudson Bay, northern [[Saskatchewan]], a small portion of northeastern [[Alberta]],<ref>[http://www.abheritage.ca/abnature/shield/shield.htm Alberta Heritage - Alberta Online Encyclopedia] - The Canadian Shield Region of Alberta</ref> and the mainland northern Canadian territories to the east of a line extended north from the Saskatchewan/Alberta border ([[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]]).<ref name=britannica>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9019922|author=Encyclopædia Britannica|authorlink=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Canadian Shield|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref> In total, it covers approximately {{convert|8000000|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}. It covers even more area and stretches to the Western Cordillera in the west and [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] in the east, but the formations are still underground. The underlying rock structure does include Hudson Bay and the submerged area between North America and Greenland<!---, but by some definitions these submerged regions may not ''technically'' be part of the Shield since they are not on the surfaces --->.

The multitude of rivers and lakes in the entire region is caused by the [[drainage basin|watersheds]] of the area being so young and in a state of sorting themselves out with the added effect of [[post-glacial rebound]]. The Shield was originally an area of very large [[mountain]]s (about {{convert|12000|m|disp=or}})<ref>

Each belt probably grew by the coalescence of accumulations erupted from numerous vents, making the tally of volcanoes reach the hundreds. Many of Canada's major ore deposits are associated with Precambrian volcanoes.

Mountains have deep roots and float on the denser [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] much like an [[iceberg]] at [[sea]]. As mountains erode, their roots rise and are eroded in turn. The rocks that now form the surface of the [[Shield (geology)|Shield]] were once far below the Earth's surface.

The high pressures and temperatures at those depths provided ideal conditions for [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralization]]. Although these mountains are now heavily eroded, many large mountains still exist in Canada's far north called the [[Arctic Cordillera]]. This is a vast deeply dissected [[mountain range]], stretching from northernmost [[Ellesmere Island]] to the northernmost tip of [[Labrador]]. The range's highest peak is [[Nunavut]]'s [[Barbeau Peak]] at {{convert|2616|m}} above [[sea level]].<ref>{{cite bivouac|261|Barbeau Peak}}</ref> [[Precambrian]] rock is the major component of the [[bedrock]].

The [[North American craton]] is the bedrock forming the heart of the North American continent and the Canadian Shield is the largest exposed part of the craton's bedrock.

The Canadian Shield is part of an ancient continent called [[Arctica]], which was formed about 2.5 billion years ago during the [[Neoarchean]] era. It was split into Greenland, Laurentia, [[Scotland]], [[Siberia]], [[East Antarctica]] and is now roughly situated in the [[Arctic]] around the current [[North Pole]].

== Ecology ==
<!---not quite ready to delete this yet, but it does not seem germane to geology. Definitely of use to a GEOGRAPHY article about the same area--->
The current [[geomorphology|surface expression]] of the Shield is one of very thin soil lying on top of the [[bedrock]], with many bare outcrops. This arrangement was caused by severe [[glacier|glaciation]] during the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]], which covered the Shield and scraped the rock clean.

The lowlands of the Canadian Shield have a very dense soil that is not suitable for forestation, but it also contains many marshes and bogs. The rest of the region has coarse soil that does not retain moisture well and is frozen as [[permafrost]] year round. Forests are not as dense in the north.

The Shield is covered in parts by vast [[boreal forest]]s in the south that support natural [[ecosystem]]s as well as a major [[logging]] industry. This boreal forest area includes ecoregions such as the [[Eastern Canadian Shield taiga]] that covers northern Quebec and most of Labrador, and the [[Midwestern Canadian Shield forests]] that run westwards from [[Northwestern Ontario]]. [[Hydrography|Hydrographical]] drainage is generally poor, the effects of [[glaciation]] being one of the many reasons. [[Tundra]] typically prevails in the northern regions. Many mammals such as [[caribou]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[moose]], [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[wolverine]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[mink]], [[otter]]s, [[grizzly bear]], [[polar bear]]s and [[American black bear|black bears]] are present.<ref>{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=na0612|name=Northern Canadian Shield taiga}}</ref> In the case of polar bears (''Ursus maritimus'') the Shield area contains many of the [[Maternity den|denning]] locations such as the [[Wapusk National Park]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan (2008) [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=36084 ''Polar Bear: Ursus maritimus'', Globaltwitcher.com, ed. Nicklas Stromberg]</ref>

== Mining and economics ==
The Shield is one of the world's richest areas in terms of [[mineral]] [[ore]]s. It is filled with substantial deposits of [[nickel]], [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[copper]]. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and one of the best known, is [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]]. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the [[Sudbury Basin]] is an ancient [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]]. Ejecta from the meteorite impact was found in the [[Rove Formation]] in May 2007. The nearby, but less known [[Temagami Magnetic Anomaly]], has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. This suggests it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.<ref name="GH">[http://gdcinfo.agg.nrcan.gc.ca/app/3Dimaging/temagami_e.html 3-D Magnetic Imaging using Conjugate Gradients: Temagami anomaly] Retrieved on 2008-03-12</ref>

In northeastern Quebec, the giant [[Manicouagan Reservoir]] is the site of an extensive hydroelectric project (Manic-cinq, or Manic-5). This is one of the largest-known [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]]s on Earth.

The [[Flin Flon greenstone belt]] in central [[Manitoba]] and east-central [[Saskatchewan]] is one of the largest [[Paleoproterozoic]] volcanic-hosted massive [[sulfide]] (VMS) districts in the world, containing 27 [[copper]]-[[zinc]]-([[gold]]) deposits from which more than 183 million tons{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}<!--metric, short or long tons?--> of sulfide have been mined.<ref name=Norris>{{Cite journal |author=Norris, Jessica |title=Report on the 2007 Diamond Drilling Program McClarty Lake Project, Manitoba |publisher=Aurora Geosciences Ltd. |year=2007 |url=http://www.troymet.com/i/pdf/2007McClarty43-101.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-02-22 }}</ref>

The Shield, particularly the portion in the [[Northwest Territories]], has recently been the site of several major [[diamond]] discoveries. The [[kimberlite]] pipes in which the diamonds are found are closely associated with cratons, which provide the deep [[lithosphere|lithospheric]] [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] required to stabilize diamond as a [[mineral]]. The kimberlite eruptions then bring the diamonds from over {{convert|150|km}} depth to the surface. Currently the [[Ekati Diamond Mine|Ekati]] and [[Diavik Diamond Mine|Diavik]] mines are actively mining kimberlite diamonds.
