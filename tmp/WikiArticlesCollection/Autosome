An '''autosome''' is a [[chromosome]] that is not an [[allosome]] (i.e., not a [[sex chromosome]]).<ref>{{Cite book | last=Griffiths | first=Anthony J. F. | title=An Introduction to genetic analysis | year=1999 | publisher=W.H. Freeman | location=New York  | isbn=0-7167-3771-X | pages= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=autosome&rid=iga.section.222}}</ref>  Autosomes appear in pairs whose members have the same form but differ from other pairs in a [[diploid]] cell, whereas members of an allosome pair may differ from one another and thereby determine sex.  

For example, [[human]]s have a [[diploid]] [[human genome|genome]] that usually contains 22 pairs of autosomes and one allosome pair (46 chromosomes total). The autosome pairs are labeled with numbers (1-22 in humans) roughly in order of their sizes in base pairs, while allosomes are labeled with their letters.<ref>http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=autosome</ref>  By contrast, the allosome pair consists of two [[X chromosome]]s in females or one X and one [[Y chromosome]] in males. (Unusual combinations of [[XYY syndrome|XYY]], [[Klinefelter syndrome|XXY]], [[Triple X syndrome|XXX]], [[XXXX syndrome|XXXX]], [[XXXXX syndrome|XXXXX]] or [[XXYY syndrome|XXYY]], among [[Aneuploidy|other allosome combinations]], are known to occur and usually cause developmental abnormalities.)
