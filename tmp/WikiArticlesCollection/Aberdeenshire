'''Aberdeenshire''' ({{lang-gd|Siorrachd Obar Dheathain}}) is one of the 32 [[Council areas of Scotland|council areas]] of Scotland, and a [[lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy area]].

The present day Aberdeenshire council area does not include the [[City of Aberdeen]], now a separate council area, from which its name derives. Together, the modern council area and the city formed historic Aberdeenshire – one of the [[counties of Scotland]] formerly used for local government purposes. Within these borders, the [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|'''County of Aberdeen''']] remains in existence as a [[registration county]].<ref>[http://www.ros.gov.uk/pdfs/map.pdf Land Register Counties & Operational Dates<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Aberdeenshire Council is headquartered at Woodhill House, in [[Aberdeen]]; the only Scottish council whose headquarters are based outwith its area's border. Aberdeenshire borders [[Angus]] and [[Perth and Kinross]] to the south, and [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] and [[Moray]] to the west.

Traditionally, it has been economically dependent upon the primary sector (agriculture, fishing, and forestry) and related
processing industries. Over the last 40 years, the development of the oil and gas industry and associated service sector has broadened Aberdeenshire's economic base, and contributed to a rapid population growth of some 50%.<ref name="Aberdeenshire Profile 2012" /> since 1975, while the land covered represents 8% of Scotland's overall territory. It covers an area of {{convert|6313|sqkm}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aberdeenshire profile|url=http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/statistics/area/AberdeenshireProfile201320813.pdf|publisher=Aberdeenshire Council|accessdate=9 October 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6KEgkjX43|archivedate=9 October 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name=Turner>{{cite encyclopedia|pages = 1301|encyclopedia= The Statesman's Yearbook 2014| editor-first= Barry|editor-last=Turner|year = 2013 | publisher = Macmillan Publishers Ltd.|isbn = 978-0-230-37769-1|title = Scotland}}</ref>

==History==
Aberdeenshire has a rich prehistoric and historic heritage. It is the locus of a large number of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] archaeological sites, including [[Longman Hill]], [[Kempstone Hill]], [[Catto Long Barrow]] and [[Cairn Lee]]. The area was settled in the [[Bronze Age]] by the [[Beaker culture]], who arrived from the south around 2000-1800 BC.<ref name=EB/> Stone circles and cairns are predominantly from this era. In the [[Iron Age]], hill forts were built.<ref name=EB/> Around the 1st century AD, the [[Taexali]] people, which have left little history were believed to have resided along the coast.<ref name=EB/> The [[Picts]] were the next documented inhabitants of the area, and were no later than 800-900 AD. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] also were in the area during this period, as they left signs at [[Kintore, Aberdeenshire|Kintore]].<ref name=EB/> Christianity influenced the inhabitants early on, and there were [[Celts|Celtic]] monasteries at [[Old Deer]] and [[Monymusk]].<ref name=EB/> Since [[medieval]] times there have been a number of crossings of the [[Mounth]] (a spur of mountainous land that extends from the higher inland range to the [[North Sea]] slightly north of [[Stonehaven]]) through present day Aberdeenshire from the Scottish Lowlands to the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. Some of the most well known and historically important [[trackway]]s are the [[Causey Mounth]] and [[Elsick Mounth]].<ref>[[W. Douglas Simpson]], "The Early Castles of Mar", Proceedings of the Society, 102, 10 December 1928</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18037 |title=C.Michael Hogan, '&#39;Elsick Mounth'&#39;, Megalithic Portal, ed.

Aberdeenshire played an important role in the fighting between the Scottish [[clan]]s. [[Clan MacBeth]] and [[House of Dunkeld|Clan Canmore]] were 2 of the larger clans. [[Lumphanan]] saw Macbeth fall in 1057.<ref name=EB/> During the [[Anglo-Norman]] penetration, other families arrives such as [[House of Balliol]], [[Clan Bruce]], and [[Clan Cumming]] (Comyn).<ref name=EB/> When the fighting amongst these newcomers resulted in the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]], the English king [[Edward I]] traveled across the area twice, in 1296 and 1303. In 1307, [[Robert the Bruce]] was victorious near [[Inverurie]]. Along with his victory came new families, namely the [[Clan Forbes|Forbeses]] and the [[Clan Gordon|Gordons]]. These new families set the stage for the upcoming rivalries during the 14th and 15th centuries.<ref name=EB/> This rivalry grew worse when religion became a focal point, as the Gordon family adhered to [[Catholicism]] and the [[Forbes]] to [[Protestantism]]. Three universities were founded in the area prior to the 17th century, [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]] in [[Old Aberdeen]] (1494), [[Marischal College]] in [[Aberdeen]] (1593), and the [[University of Fraserburgh]] (1597).<ref name=EB/>

After the end of the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], there was a peaceful period, interrupted by minor events such as the [[Rising of 1715]] and the [[Rising of 1745]], which in turn lead to the end of the ascendancy of [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalianism]], and the feudal power of landowners and in turn lead to the era of increased agricultural and industrial progress.<ref name=EB/> During the 17th century, Aberdeenshire was the location of more fighting, centered around the [[Marquess of Montrose]] and the [[English Civil Wars]].<ref name=EB/> This period also saw increased wealth due to the increase in trade with [[Germany]], [[Poland]], and the [[Low Countries]].<ref name=EB/>

The present council area is named after the historic [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|county of Aberdeen]], which had different boundaries and was abolished in 1975 under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]]. It was replaced by [[Grampian Region|Grampian Regional Council]] and five district councils: [[Banff and Buchan]], [[Gordon, Scotland|Gordon]], [[Kincardine and Deeside]], [[Moray]] and the [[City of Aberdeen]]. The current Aberdeenshire consists of all of former [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]], former [[Kincardineshire]] and the northeast portions of [[Banffshire]].<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |title=Aberdeenshire|edition = 15th |year=2010|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=28-29}}</ref> Local government functions were shared between the two levels. In 1996, under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], the Banff and Buchan district, Gordon district and Kincardine and Deeside district were merged to form the present Aberdeenshire council area, with the other two districts becoming autonomous council areas.

==Demographics==
The council area has a population of approximately 247,600,<ref name="Aberdeenshire Profile 2012">{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/statistics/area/AberdeenshireProfile2012.pdf |title=Aberdeenshire Council – Profile 2012 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=11 July 2012}}</ref> representing 4.7% of Scotland's total, a rise of over 50% from 1971. Aberdeenshire's population has grown steadily over recent years, increasing by 9.1% since 2001. Over this period Scotland's population grew by 3.8%.
The population currently has a relatively high proportion of under 16s and slightly less people of working-age compared with the Scottish average.<ref name="Aberdeenshire Profile 2012" /> The twelve biggest settlements in Aberdeenshire (with 2011 population estimates) are:

==Economy==
Aberdeenshire's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated at £3,496m (2011), representing 5.2% of the Scottish total. Aberdeenshire's economy is closely linked to Aberdeen City's (GDP £7,906m) and in 2011 the region as a whole was calculated to contribute 16.8% of Scotland's GDP. Between 2012 and 2014 the combined Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen City economic forecast GDP growth rate is 6.8%, the highest growth rate of any local council area and above the Scottish rate of 4.8%.<ref name="Aberdeenshire Profile 2012" />

A significant proportion of Aberdeenshire's working residents commute to Aberdeen City for work, varying from 11.5% from Fraserburgh to 65% from Westhill.

Average Gross Weekly Earnings (for full-time employees employed in work places in Aberdeenshire in 2011) are £570.60. This is lower than the Scottish average by £4.10 and a fall of 2.6% on the 2010 figure. The average gross weekly pay of people resident in Aberdeenshire is much higher, at £641.90, as many people commute out
of Aberdeenshire, principally into Aberdeen City.<ref name="Aberdeenshire Profile 2012" />

Total employment (excluding farm data) in Aberdeenshire is estimated at 93,700 employees (Business Register and
Employment Survey 2009). The majority of employees work within the service sector, predominantly in public administration, education and health. Almost 19% of employment is within the public sector. Aberdeenshire's economy remains closely linked to Aberdeen City's and the North Sea oil industry, with many employees in oil related jobs.

The average monthly unemployment (claimant count) rate for Aberdeenshire in 2011 was 1.5%. This is lower than the average rates for Aberdeen City (2.3%), Scotland (4.2%) and the UK (3.8%).<ref name="Aberdeenshire Profile 2012" />

==Major Industries==
* '''Energy''' – There is significant energy related infrastructure, presence and expertise in Aberdeenshire. Peterhead is an important centre for the energy industry. Peterhead Port, which includes an extensive new quay with adjacent lay down area at Smith Quay, is a major support location for North Sea oil and gas exploration and production and the fast growing global sub-sea sector. The Gas Terminal at St Fergus handles around 15% of the UK's natural gas requirements and the Peterhead power station is looking to host the UK's first carbon capture and storage power generation project.<ref name="Aberdeenshire Profile 2012" />

* '''Fishing''' – Aberdeenshire is Scotland's foremost fishing area. In 2010, catches landed at Aberdeenshire's ports accounted for over half the total fish landings of Scotland, and almost 45% in the UK. Peterhead and Fraserburgh ports, alongside Aberdeen City, provide much of the employment in these sectors.<ref name=EB/>

* '''Agriculture''' – Aberdeenshire is rich in arable land, with an estimated 9,000 people employed in the sector, and is best known for rearing livestock. Sheep are important in the higher ground.<ref name=EB/>

* '''Tourism''' – this sector continues to grow, with a range of sights to be seen in the area. From the lively Cairngorm Mountain range, to the bustling fishing ports on the North-east coast, Aberdeenshire samples a bit of everything. Aberdeenshire also has rugged coastline to complete many sandy beaches, and is a hot spot for tourist activity throughout the year. Almost 1.3 million tourists visited the region in 2011 – up 3% on the previous year.<ref name="AberdeenshireProfile2012">{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/statistics/area/AberdeenshireProfile2012.pdf |title=Aberdeenshire Council – Profile 2012 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>

* '''Whiskey-distilling''' is still a practiced art in the area.<ref name=EB/>
