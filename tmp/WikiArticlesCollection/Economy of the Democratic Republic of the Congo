Sparsely populated in relation to its area, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] is home to a vast potential of natural resources and [[mineral]] wealth, its untapped deposits of raw minerals are estimated to be worth in excess of US$ 24 trillion, yet the '''economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo''' has declined drastically since the mid-1980s. At the time of its independence in 1960, the Democratic Republic of the Congo was the second most industrialized country in Africa after [[South Africa]]; it boasted a thriving mining sector and its agriculture sector was relatively productive.<ref name=CENADEP>

==Economic Implications of Conflicts==
The two recent conflicts (the [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s), which began in 1996, have dramatically reduced national output and government revenue, have increased external debt, and have resulted in deaths of more than five million people from war, and associated [[famine]] and disease. [[Malnutrition]] affects approximately two thirds of the country's population.<ref>

[[Agriculture]] is the mainstay of the [[economy]], accounting for 57.9% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] in 1997. In 1996, agriculture employed 66% of the work force.

==History==
[[File:Democratic Republic of the Congo GDP evolution-fr.svg|thumb|left|Evolution of GDP]]
[[File:2006Congo(Zaire) exports.PNG|thumb|left|Congolese exports in 2006]]

===1990s===
[[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD) Trust Fund for the Congo.
Poor [[infrastructure]], an uncertain legal framework, corruption, and lack of openness in government economic policy and financial operations remain a brake on investment and growth. A number of [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[World Bank]] missions have met with the new government to help it develop a coherent economic plan but associated reforms are on hold. Faced with continued currency depreciation, the government resorted to more drastic measures and in January 1999 banned the widespread use of U.S. dollars for all domestic commercial transactions, a position it later adjusted. The government has been unable to provide foreign exchange for economic transactions, while it has resorted to printing money to finance its expenditure. Growth was negative in 2000 because of the difficulty of meeting the conditions of international donors, continued low prices of key exports, and post-coup instability.

===2000s===
Conditions improved in late 2002 with the withdrawal of a large portion of the invading foreign troops. A number of IMF and World Bank missions have met with the government to help it develop a coherent economic plan, and President Kabila has begun implementing reforms.

===2010s===

====Special Economic Zone====
The DRC is embarking on the establishment of special economic zones to encourage the revival of its industry. The first SEZ should come into being in 2012 in N'Sele, a commune of Kinshasa, and will focus on agro-industries. The Congolese authorities are already planning to open another dedicated to mining (Katanga) and a third dedicated to the cement (in the Bas-Congo).<ref>[http://www.lecho.be/actualite/economie_-_politique_international/Congo-_Le_-paradis-_ou_le_droit_fera_la_loi.8989989-3164.art] Le "paradis" où le droit fera la loi, L'Echo, novembre 2010 {{fr icon}}</ref>

==Implications of Instability on Economy==
Ongoing conflicts dramatically reduced government revenue 
increased external debt. As Reyntjens wrote, “Entrepreneurs of insecurity are engaged in extractive activities that would be impossible in a stable state environment. The criminalization context in which these activities occur offers avenues for considerable factional and personal enrichment through the trafficking of arms, illegal drugs, toxic products, mineral resources and dirty money.”16

==International Relations==

====Ease of Doing Business Rank (EDBR)====
The Democratic Republic of Congo ranks 181 on the low end of the ease of doing business scale as ranked by the World Bank. This measures the difficulties of starting a business, enforcing contracts, paying taxes, resolving insolvency, protecting investors, trading across borders, getting credit, getting electricity, registering property, dealing with construction permits and registering property (World Bank 2013:8).

==Sectors==

===Agriculture===
{{Main|Agriculture in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, accounting for 57.9% of the GDP in 1997. Main cash crops include [[coffee]], [[palm oil]], [[rubber]], [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[tea]], and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]]. Food crops include [[cassava]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[maize]], [[Bambara groundnut|groundnuts]], and [[rice]]. In 1996, agriculture employed 66% of the work force.

===Fishing===
The Democratic Republic of Congo also possesses 50 percent of Africa’s forests and a river system that could provide [[hydro-electric]] power to the entire continent, according to a [[United Nations]] report on the country’s strategic significance and its potential role as an economic power in [[central Africa]].<ref>[http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=69718 Democratic Republic of the Congo economic and strategic significance]</ref> Fish are the single most important source of animal protein in the DRC. Total production of marine, river, and lake fisheries in 2003 was estimated at 222,965 tons, all but 5,000 tons from inland waters. PEMARZA, a state agency, carries on marine fishing.

===Forestry===
Forests cover 60 percent of the total land area. There are vast [[timber]] resources, and commercial development of the country’s 61 million hectares (150 million acres) of exploitable wooded area is only beginning. The [[Mayumbe area]] of [[Bas-Congo]] was once the major center of timber exploitation, but forests in this area were nearly
depleted. The more extensive forest regions of the central cuvette and of the [[Ubangi River]] valley have increasingly been tapped. Roundwood removals were estimated at 72,170,000 m<sup>3</sup> in 2003, about 95 percent for fuel. Some 14 species are presently being harvested. Exports of forest products in 2003 totalled $25.7 million. Foreign capital is necessary in order for forestry to expand, and the government recognizes that changes in tax structure and export procedures will be needed to facilitate economic growth.

===Mining===

The [[coltan]] is a major source of [[tantalum]], which is used in the fabrication of electronic components in computers and mobile phones. In 2002, [[tin]] was discovered in the east of the country, but, to date, mining has been on a small scale.

{{Main|Transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

Ground transport in the Democratic Republic of Congo has always been difficult. The terrain and climate of the [[Congo Basin]] present serious barriers to road and rail construction, and the distances are enormous across this vast country. Furthermore, chronic economic mismanagement and internal conflict has led to serious under-investment over many years.

On the other hand, the Democratic Republic of Congo has thousands of kilometres of [[navigable]] [[waterway]]s, and traditionally water transport has been the dominant means of moving around approximately two-thirds of the country.
