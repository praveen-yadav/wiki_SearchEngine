'''Bubble and squeak''' is a traditional British dish made with the shallow-fried [[leftovers|leftover]] vegetables from a [[roast dinner]]. The main ingredients are [[potato]] and [[cabbage]], but [[carrot]]s, [[pea]]s, [[Brussels sprout]]s, or any other leftover vegetables can be added. The chopped vegetables (and cold chopped meat if used) are fried in a pan together with mashed potatoes or crushed roast potatoes until the mixture is well-cooked and brown on the sides. The dish is so named because it makes bubbling and squeaking sounds during the cooking process.<ref>{{citation |author=Pickett, Joseph P. et al. |title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2000 }}</ref> It is often served with cold meat from the [[Sunday roast]], and pickles or [[brown sauce]], or as an accompaniment to a [[full breakfast|full English breakfast]].

The meat was traditionally added to the bubble and squeak itself, although nowadays it is more commonly made without meat. The earliest known recipe was by [[A New System of Domestic Cookery|Maria Rundell]] in 1806.<ref name="rundell">Rundell, Maria Eliza Ketelby (1808). Bubble and Squeak.

Bubble and squeak was a popular dish during [[World War II]], as it was an easy way of using leftovers during a period when most foods were subject to [[rationing]]. In more recent times, pre-prepared frozen and tinned versions have become available.
