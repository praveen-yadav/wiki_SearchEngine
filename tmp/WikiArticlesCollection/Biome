'''Biomes''' are [[climatic]]ally and [[geographical]]ly defined as contiguous areas with similar climatic conditions on the [[Earth]], such as [[Community (ecology)|communities]] of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[Soil biology|soil organisms]],<ref>[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/index.php The World's Biomes], Retrieved August 19, 2008, from  [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/index.php University of California Museum of Paleontology]</ref> and are often referred to as [[ecosystems]]. Some parts of the earth have more or less the same kind of [[abiotic]] and [[biotic]] factors spread over a large area, creating a typical ecosystem over that area. Such major ecosystems are termed as biomes. Biomes are defined by factors such as plant structures (such as [[trees]], [[shrubs]], and [[grasses]]), leaf types (such as [[broadleaf]] and needleleaf), plant spacing ([[forest]], [[woodland]], [[savanna]]), and climate. Unlike [[ecozone]]s, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of [[ecological succession]] and [[climax vegetation]] (quasiequilibrium state of the local ecosystem). An [[ecosystem]] has many [[biotope]]s and a biome is a major [[habitat]] type. A major habitat type, however, is a compromise, as it has an intrinsic [[Homogeneity (ecology)|inhomogeneity]]. Some examples of habitats are ponds, trees, streams, creeks, under rocks and burrows in the sand or soil.

The [[biodiversity]] characteristic of each extinction, especially the diversity of fauna and subdominant plant forms, is a function of [[abiotic]] factors and the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] productivity of the dominant [[vegetation]]. In terrestrial biomes, species diversity tends to correlate positively with [[primary production|net primary productivity]], [[Ecohydrology|moisture availability]], and [[temperature]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Pidwirny | first = Michael| editor = Sidney Draggan | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Earth | title = Biomes | url = http://www.eoearth.org/article/Biomes | accessdate = 2006-11-16 | edition =  | date = 2006-10-16 | publisher = Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment | location = Washington, D.C.}}</ref> 

[[Ecoregions]] are grouped into both biomes and ecozones.

A fundamental classification of biomes are: 
# [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|Terrestrial]] (land) biomes
# [[Biome#Freshwater_biomes|Aquatic biomes]] (including freshwater biomes and marine biomes)
     
Biomes are often known in English by local names. For example, a [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|temperate grassland or shrubland]] biome is known commonly as ''[[steppe]]'' in central [[Asia]], [[prairie]] in [[North America]], and ''[[pampas]]'' in [[South America]]. Tropical grasslands are known as [[savanna]] in Australia, whereas in southern Africa it is known as certain kinds of ''[[veld]]'' (from [[Afrikaans]]). 

Sometimes an entire biome may be targeted for protection, especially under an individual nation's biodiversity action plan.

Climate is a major factor determining the distribution of terrestrial biomes. Among the important climatic factors are:
* [[Latitude]]: Arctic, boreal, temperate, subtropical, tropical
* [[Humidity]]: humid, semihumid, semiarid, and arid
** seasonal variation: Rainfall may be distributed evenly throughout the year or be marked by seasonal variations.
** dry summer, wet winter: Most regions of the earth receive most of their rainfall during the summer months; Mediterranean climate regions receive their rainfall during the winter months.
* [[Elevation]]: Increasing elevation causes a distribution of habitat types similar to that of increasing latitude.

The most widely used systems of classifying biomes correspond to [[latitude]] (or temperature zoning) and humidity. [[Biodiversity]] generally increases away from the poles towards the [[equator]] and increases with humidity.

==Biome classification schemes==
In this scheme, climates are classified based on the biological effects of temperature and rainfall on vegetation under the assumption that these two [[abiotic]] factors are the largest determinants of the type of vegetation found in an area. Holdridge uses the four axes to define 30 so-called "humidity provinces", which are clearly visible in the Holdridge diagram. While his scheme largely ignores soil and sun exposure, Holdridge did acknowledge that these, too, were important factors in biome determination.

===Holdridge scheme===
Biomes are classification schemes defined by climatic [[parameters]]. Particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, there was a significant push to understand the relationships between these climatic parameters and properties of ecosystem energetics because such discoveries would enable the prediction of rates of energy capture and transfer among components within ecosystems. Such a study was conducted by Sims et al. (1978) on North American grasslands. The study found a positive logistic correlation between [[evapotranspiration]] in mm/yr and above-ground net primary production in g/m<sup>2</sup>/yr. More general results from the study were that precipitation and water use lead to above-ground primary production, solar radiation and temperature lead to belowground primary production (roots), and temperature and water lead to cool and warm season growth habit.<ref>Pomeroy, Lawrence R. and James J. Alberts, editors. Concepts of Ecosystem Ecology. New York: Springer-Verlag, 1988.</ref>  These findings help explain the categories used in Holdridge’s bioclassification scheme, which were then later simplified in Whittaker’s. The number of classification schemes and the variety of determinants used in those schemes, however, should be taken as strong indicators that biomes do not all fit perfectly into the classification schemes created.

====Whittaker's biome-type classification scheme====

[[Robert Harding Whittaker|Whittaker]] appreciated biome-types as a representation of the great diversity of the living world, and saw the need to establish a simple way to classify them. He based his classification scheme on two abiotic factors: precipitation and temperature. His scheme can be seen as a simplification of Holdridge's, one more readily accessible, but perhaps missing the greater specificity that Holdridge's provides. 

Whittaker based his representation of global biomes on both previous theoretical assertions and an ever-increasing empirical sampling of global ecosystems. He was in a unique position to make such a holistic assertion because he had previously compiled a review of biome classification.<ref>Whittaker, Robert H., Botanical Review, Classification of Natural Communities, Vol. 28, No. 1 (Jan–Mar 1962), pp. 1–239.</ref>

====Key definitions for understanding Whittaker's scheme====

*'''Physiognomy''': The apparent characteristics, outward features, or appearance of ecological communities or species
*'''Biome''': a grouping of terrestrial ecosystems on a given continent that are similar in vegetation structure, physiognomy, features of the environment and characteristics of their animal communities
*'''Formation''': a major kind of community of plants on a given continent
*'''Biome-type''': grouping of convergent biomes or formations of different continents, defined by physiognomy
*'''Formation-type''': a grouping of convergent formations

Whittaker's distinction between biome and formation can be simplified: formation is used when applied to plant communities only, while biome is used when concerned with both plants and animals. Whittaker's convention of biome-type or formation-type is simply a broader method to categorize similar communities.<ref name="Whittaker1975">Whittaker, Robert H. Communities and Ecosystems. New York: MacMillan Publishing Company, Inc., 1975.</ref> <!---The world biome-types, as displayed on a world map, can be viewed at the following link: [http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/biomemap.html here] (This link is now dead.)--->

====Whittaker's parameters for classifying biome-types====

Whittaker, seeing the need for a simpler way to express the relationship of community structure to the environment, used what he called “gradient analysis” of ecocline patterns to relate communities to climate on a worldwide scale. Whittaker considered four main ecoclines in the terrestrial realm.<ref name="Whittaker1975"/>
# Intertidal levels: The wetness gradient of areas that are exposed to alternating water and dryness with intensities that vary by location from high to low tide
# Climatic moisture gradient
# Temperature gradient by altitude
# Temperature gradient by latitude

Along these gradients, Whittaker noted several trends that allowed him to qualitatively establish biome-types. 
* The gradient runs from favorable to extreme, with corresponding changes in productivity.
* Changes in physiognomic complexity vary with the favorability of the environment (decreasing community structure and reduction of stratal differentiation as the environment becomes less favorable).
* Trends in diversity of structure follow trends in species diversity; alpha and beta species diversities decrease from favorable to extreme environments.
* Each growth-form (i.e. grasses, shrubs, etc.) has its characteristic place of maximum importance along the ecoclines.
*The same growth forms may be dominant in similar environments in widely different parts of the world.

Whittaker summed the effects of gradients (3) and (4) to get an overall temperature gradient, and combined this with gradient (2), the moisture gradient, to express the above conclusions in what is known as the Whittaker classification scheme. The scheme graphs average annual precipitation (x-axis) versus average annual temperature (y-axis) to classify biome-types.

=== Walter system ===

The Heinrich Walter classification scheme, developed by Heinrich Walter, a German ecologist, differs from both the Whittaker and Holdridge schemes because it takes into account the seasonality of temperature and precipitation. The system, also based on precipitation and temperature, finds 9 major biomes, with the important climate traits and vegetation types summarized in the accompanying table. The boundaries of each biome correlate to the conditions of moisture and cold stress that are strong determinants of plant form, and therefore the vegetation that defines the region. Extreme conditions, such as flooding in a swamp, can create different kinds of communities within the same biome.

*I: Equatorial
**Always moist and lacking temperature seasonality
**Evergreen tropical rain forest
*II: Tropical
**Summer rainy season and cooler “winter” dry season
**Seasonal forest, scrub, or savanna
*III: Subtropical
**Highly seasonal, arid climate
**Desert vegetation with considerable exposed surface
*IV: Mediterranean
**Winter rainy season and summer drought
**Sclerophyllous (drought-adapted), frost-sensitive shrublands and woodlands
*V: Warm temperate
**Occasional frost, often with summer rainfall maximum
**Temperate evergreen forest, somewhat frost-sensitive
*VI: Nemoral
**Moderate climate with winter freezing
**Frost-resistant, deciduous, temperate forest
*VII: Continental
**Arid, with warm or hot summers and cold winters
**Grasslands and temperate deserts
*VIII: Boreal
**Cold temperate with cool summers and long winters
**Evergreen, frost-hardy, needle-leaved forest (taiga)
*IX: Polar
**Very short, cool summers and long, very cold winters
**Low, evergreen vegetation, without trees, growing over permanently frozen soils

===Bailey system===
Robert G. Bailey almost developed a [[biogeography|biogeographical]] classification system for the United States in a map published in 1976. He subsequently expanded the system to include the rest of North America in 1981, and the world in 1989. The Bailey system, based on climate, is divided into seven domains (polar, humid temperate, dry, humid, and humid tropical), with further divisions based on other climate characteristics (subarctic, warm temperate, hot temperate, and subtropical; marine and continental; lowland and mountain).<ref>http://www.fs.fed.us/land/ecosysmgmt/index.html Bailey System, US Forest Service</ref>

===WWF system===
A team of biologists convened by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) developed an [[ecological land classification]] system that identified fourteen biomes,<ref>Olson, David M. et al. (2001); [http://wolfweb.unr.edu/~ldyer/classes/396/olsonetal.pdf Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World]: A New Map of Life on Earth, BioScience, Vol. 51, No. 11., pp. 933–938.</ref> called '''major habitat types''', and further divided the world's land area into 867 [[terrestrial ecoregions]]. Each terrestrial ecoregion has a specific EcoID, format XXnnNN (XX is the [[ecozone]], nn is the biome number, NN is the individual number). This classification is used to define the [[Global 200]] list of [[ecoregion]]s identified by the WWF as priorities for conservation. The WWF major habitat types are: 

*01 [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] (tropical and subtropical, humid)
*02 [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests]] (tropical and subtropical, semihumid)
*03 [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests]] (tropical and subtropical, semihumid)
*04 [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] (temperate, humid)
*05 [[Temperate coniferous forests]] (temperate, humid to semihumid)
*06 [[Taiga|Boreal forests/taiga]] (subarctic, humid)
*07 [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] (tropical and subtropical, semiarid)
*08 [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] (temperate, semiarid)
*09 [[Flooded grasslands and savannas]] (temperate to tropical, fresh or brackish water inundated)
*10 [[Montane grasslands and shrublands]] (alpine or montane climate)
*11 [[Tundra]] (Arctic)
*12 [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] or [[sclerophyll forest]]s (temperate warm, semihumid to semiarid with winter rainfall)
*13 [[Deserts and xeric shrublands]] (temperate to tropical, arid)
*14 [[Mangrove]] (subtropical and tropical, salt water inundated)

==Anthropogenic biomes==
Humans have fundamentally altered global patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. As a result, vegetation forms predicted by conventional biome systems are rarely observed across most of Earth's land surface. [[Anthropogenic biomes]] provide an alternative view of the terrestrial biosphere based on global patterns of sustained direct human interaction with ecosystems, including agriculture, human settlements, urbanization, forestry and other uses of land. Anthropogenic biomes offer a new way forward in ecology and conservation by recognizing the irreversible coupling of human and ecological systems at global scales and moving us toward an understanding how best to live in and manage our biosphere and the anthropogenic biosphere we live in. The main biomes in the world are freshwater, marine, coniferous, deciduous, ice, mountains, boreal, grasslands, tundra, and rainforests.

===Major anthropogenic biomes===
* Dense settlements
* Villages
* Croplands
* Rangelands
* Forested

==Other biomes==
The [[endolith]]ic biome, consisting entirely of microscopic life in rock [[porosity|pores]] and cracks, kilometers beneath the surface, has only recently been discovered, and does not fit well into most classification schemes.
