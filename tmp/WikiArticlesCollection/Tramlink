'''Tramlink''' is a [[light rail]] system in [[south London]], England. It began operation in May 2000 as '''Croydon Tramlink''', serving mainly the [[London Borough of Croydon]]. It is operated by [[London Tramlink]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/1566.aspx |title=Transport for London -London Tramlink |publisher=Tfl.gov.uk |date=30 May 2000 |accessdate=9 May 2010}}</ref> an arm of [[Transport for London]] (TfL).

Tramlink serves seven [[National Rail]] stations and has one interchange with the [[London Underground]], at [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] for the [[District Line]], and one with [[London Overground]], at [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]] for the London Overground [[East London Line]]; one of the factors leading to its creation was that the London Borough of Croydon has no London Underground service.

Tramlink runs on a mixture of street track shared with other traffic, dedicated track in public roads, and off-street track consisting of new rights-of-way, former railway lines, and one section of alignment (not track) shared with a [[third rail]] electrified [[Network Rail]] line.

==History==
{{Main | Trams in London }}

===Construction===
In 1990 [[Croydon Council]] with the then [[London Regional Transport]] (LRT) put the project to Parliament and the Croydon Tramlink Act 1994 resulted, which gave LRT the power to build and run Tramlink.<ref name=tramlinkact>{{Cite web | title = Croydon Tramlink Act | year = 1994 | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/localact1994/ukla_19940011_en_2#pt1-l1g4 }}</ref>

In 1996 Tramtrack Croydon Limited (TCL) won a 99-year [[Private Finance Initiative]] (PFI) contract to design, build, operate and maintain  Tramlink. TCL was a partnership comprising [[First Group]], [[Bombardier Transportation]] (the builders of the system's trams), [[Sir Robert McAlpine]] and [[Amey Construction Ltd]] (who built the system), and [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] and [[3i]] (who arranged the finances). TCL kept the revenue generated by Tramlink and LRT had to pay compensation to TCL for any changes to the fares and ticketing policy introduced later.<ref name = tfln7741/>

TCL subcontracted operations to CentreWest Buses, now part of [[First London]].

===Former lines re-used===
[[File:028140 tramlink mitcham.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gauntlet track]] near Mitcham]] There are four routes: Route 1 – Elmers End to Croydon; Route 2 – Beckenham Junction to Croydon; Route 3 – New Addington to Wimbledon; and Route 4 – Therapia Lane to Elmers End

Route 2 runs parallel to the Crystal Palace to Beckenham Junction line of the [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]] network between [[Birkbeck station|Birkbeck]] and [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]] – the [[National Rail]] track had been singled some years earlier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/croydon/croydon1.html|title=Map of current system using existing and former British rail lines|accessdate=16 November 2007 |publisher=[[Newsquest|This is Local London]]}}</ref>

From Elmers End to Woodside route 1 and route 4 (and route 2 from Arena) follow the former [[British Rail]] branch line to [[Addiscombe railway station|Addiscombe]], then diverge to reach Addiscombe tram stop, which is 500 metres west of the demolished Addiscombe railway station. At Woodside the old station buildings stand disused, and the original platforms have been replaced by accessible low platforms.

From Woodside to near Sandilands (routes 1, 2 and 4) and from near Sandilands almost to Lloyd Park (route 3) Tramlink follows the former [[Woodside and South Croydon Railway]], including the Park Hill (or Sandilands) tunnels.

The section of Route 3 between [[Wimbledon railway station|Wimbledon]] and [[West Croydon railway station|West Croydon]] follows the single-track [[British Rail]] route for the most part, closed on 31 May 1997 so that it could be converted for Tramlink.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2002|journal=[[Railway Magazine]]|publisher=IPC Media |volume=148|page=51|issn=0033-8923}}</ref> Within this section, from near Phipps Bridge to near Reeves Corner, route 3 follows the [[Surrey Iron Railway]], giving Tramlink a claim to the one of the world's oldest railway alignments – {{gbmapscaled|TQ273680|300|Tramway Path}} beside Mitcham tram stop had its name long before Tramlink. A partial obstruction near this point has necessitated the use of [[gauntlet track|interlaced track]].

A Victorian footbridge beside Waddon New Road was dismantled to make way for the flyover<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.transport-of-delight.com/Tramlink/Pages/TramsinAction/Flyover-1.htm |title=Flyover 1 |publisher=Transport-of-delight.com |date= |accessdate=9 May 2010}}</ref> over the [[West Croydon railway station|West Croydon]] to [[Sutton railway station (London)|Sutton]] railway line. The footbridge has been re-erected at [[Corfe Castle railway station|Corfe Castle]] station on the [[Swanage Railway]] (although some evidence suggests that this was a similar footbridge removed from the site of [[Merton Park Railway Station]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Andrew|title=PRESTIGIOUS NATIONAL AWARD PLAQUE INSTALLED AT CORFE CASTLE ON 26th OCTOBER 2008|url=http://www.swanagerailway.co.uk/news482.htm|publisher=Swanage Railway|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Andrew|title=EX-STRATEGIC RAIL AUTHORITY CHAIRMAN OFFICIALLY OPENS CORFE CASTLE'S HISTORIC VICTORIAN RAILWAY FOOTBRIDGE ON 28th APRIL 2007|url=http://www.swanagerailway.co.uk/news363.htm|publisher=Swanage Railway|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref>)

===Buyout by Transport for London===
In March 2008 TfL announced that it had reached agreement to buy TCL for £98m. The purchase was finalised on 28 June 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/6-Statement-of-Acounts-2008.pdf|title=Statement of Accounts for the Year Ending 31&nbsp;March 2008|date=25 June 2008|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=27 June 2008 |at=p. 71, para. 30. c) }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The background to this purchase relates to the requirement that TfL (who took over from London Regional Transport in 2000) compensates TCL for the consequences of any changes to the fares and ticketing policy introduced since 1996. In 2007 that payment was £4m, with an annual increase in rate.<ref name=tfln7741>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx|title=TfL announces plans to take over Tramlink services|accessdate=18 March 2008 |publisher=[[Transport for London]]|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080412011803/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx |archivedate = 12 April 2008}}</ref>

In October 2008 TfL introduced a new livery, using the blue, white and green of the routes on TfL maps, to distinguish the trams from buses operating in the area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/latestnews/s-green-Tramlink/article-385546-detail/article.html|title=It's green for go at Tramlink|last=Kottegoda|first=Maheesha |date=9 October 2008|work=Croydon Advertiser|accessdate=10 October 2008}}</ref>

==Current system==

===Stops===
[[File:Croydon Tramlink Addiscombe Road.jpg|thumb|right|Tram 2530 in the original livery on 24 August 2004, leaving Croydon on an [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]] service]]

The tram stops have low platforms, {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} above rail level. They are unstaffed and have automated ticket machines. In general, access between the platforms involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing.
There are 39 stops, most being {{convert|32.2|m|abbr=on}} long. They are virtually level with the doors and are all wider than {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}. This allows [[wheelchair]]s, [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|prams]], [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|pushchairs]] and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. In street sections, the stop is integrated with the pavement.

Tramlink uses some former main-line stations on the Wimbledon–West Croydon and Elmers End–Coombe Road stretches of line. The railway platforms have been demolished and rebuilt to Tramlink specifications, except at Elmers End and Wimbledon where the track level was raised to meet the higher main-line platforms to enable [[cross-platform interchange]].

Thirty-eight stops opened in the phased introduction of tram services in May 2000. [[Centrale tram stop]] in Tamworth Road opened on 10 December 2005, increasing journey times slightly. As turnround times were already quite tight this raised the issue of buying an extra tram to maintain punctuality. Partly for this reason but also to take into account the planned restructuring of services (subsequently introduced in July 2006), TfL issued tenders for a new tram. However, nothing resulted from this.

All stops have disabled access, raised paving, CCTV, a Passenger Help Point, a Passenger Information Display (PID), litter bins, a ticket machine, a noticeboard and lamp-posts, and most also have seats and a shelter.

The PIDs display the destinations and expected arrival times of the next two trams. They can also display any message the controllers want to display, such as information on delays or even instructions to vandals to stop placing objects on the track.

Tramlink is shown on the [[Tube map#Official versions of the Tube map|"London Connections" map]] but not on the [[tube map]]. The original routes were was Line 1 [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] to [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]], Line 2 Croydon to [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]], and Line 3 Croydon to [[New Addington tram stop|New Addington]].<ref name="Tramlink p 10">''Tramlink: Your top 10 questions answered…'' Poster, 1995.</ref> On 23 July 2006 the network was restructured, with route 1 from Elmers End to Croydon, route 2 from Beckenham Junction to Croydon and route 3 from New Addington to Wimbledon. In June 2012 route 4 from Therapia Lane to Elmers End was introduced.

===Change in Route Colours===
When TfL took over a new network map was designed, combining Routes 1 and 2 as one service, coloured "Trams Green" (lime). (Originally, Line 1 was yellow, Line 2 red, and Line 3 a darker ([[District line]]) green.<ref name="Tramlink p 10"/>) Trams from Elmers End on Route 1 change their numbers in central [[Croydon]] to Route 2 (Beckenham Junction) and the reverse in the other direction, but this is likely to change in light of the introduction of Route 4.

===Fares and ticketing===
[[File:Gb-tramlink-tickets.jpg|thumb|A Tramlink Ticket Machine]]

TfL Bus Passes are valid on Tramlink, as are [[Travelcard]]s that include any of zones 3, 4, 5 and 6.

Cash fares and pay-as-you-go [[Oyster Card]] fares are the same as on [[London Buses]], although special fares may apply when using Tramlink feeder buses.

When using Oyster Cards, passengers must touch in on the platform before boarding the tram. Special arrangements apply at [[Wimbledon station]], where the Tramlink stop is within the [[National Rail]] and [[London Underground]] station.

==Rolling stock==
{{Main|CR4000|Croydon Variobahn}}

Tramlink is operated with 30 vehicles. The original fleet comprised 24 articulated [[low floor]] [[Flexity Swift]] [[CR4000]] trams built by [[Bombardier Transportation]] in [[Vienna]] numbered beginning at 2530, continuing from the highest-numbered tram 2529 on [[Trams in London|London's former tram network]], which closed in 1952. In 2006, the CR4000 fleet was refurbished, including a repaint into a new livery.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/news/Exclusive-End-era-Croydon-s-red-tram-turns-green/article-869210-detail/article.html|title=End of an era as Croydon's last red tram turns green}}</ref>

{{As of|2009|9}}, it was reported that four more trams were planned, and to avoid the extra costs of a short production run Tramlink was seeking to lease these from [[Edinburgh Trams]], where the construction of new track and depot facied long delays, but with rolling stock due for delivery from early in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/4587166.Scottish_trams_diverted_to_Croydon/|title=Scottish trams diverted to Croydon |last=Truman|first=Peter|date=9 September 2009|work=[[Croydon Guardian]]|accessdate=10 September 2009}}</ref> The [[Edinburgh Tram (vehicle)|Edinburgh Tram]] will be manufactured by [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] of Spain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edinburghtrams.com/index.php/story_so_far/view_details/21/|title=Preparation and Procurement...Tram Vehicles|work=Edinburgh Trams: The story so far|publisher=Transport Initiatives Edinburgh|accessdate=10 September 2009}}</ref> To accommodate the extra services, some sections of single-track line may be doubled.<ref name=railnewsapril09>{{Cite news|url=http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/metro/2009/04/01-tfl-croydon-tramlink.html|title=Hunt for trams in Europe as passenger numbers soar|last=Staff writer|date=1 April 2009|work=[[Railnews]]|accessdate=2 April 2009}}</ref>

==Future developments==
===Projected extensions===
The Mayor's Transport Strategy for London states that extensions to the network could be developed at relatively modest cost where there is potential demand from existing and new development to support concentrated passenger movements, and where Tramlink technology might be cost effective. Proposal 4D7 says that "The Mayor will explore the potential for extending the Tramlink network where doing so could help meet the objectives of the Transport Strategy cost effectively"<ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/transport/pdf/final_ch04d.pdf London Dockland and Croydon Tramlink Extensions]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref>  and sought initial views on the viability of a number of extensions by summer 2002.

An initial review of potential extensions has been prepared and discussed with interested parties. TfL now wishes to carry out initial development and evaluation work on the following routes:

Other extension proposals include Lewisham, Bromley town centre, Biggin Hill Airport/Village and a local spur/loop to penetrate further into Purley Way retail/industrial park.

Starting in the west, there are two corridors into Sutton town centre. The first, principally between Wimbledon and Sutton, was in view even before Tramlink opened: the trams were delivered with this as "line 4" on their destination blinds.

[[Tramlink route 5]] is the only extension being formally developed, linking Harrington Road with Crystal Palace, and Crystal Palace with Beckenham Junction, both terminating at Crystal Palace Parade. There were three options on how to get to the Parade: on-street, off-street and a mixture of the two.<ref>[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/trams/pdf/Crystal-Palace-2006-10-19.pdf Crystal Palace extension options to reach the Parade] [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]</ref> Following recent consultation the off-street option is favoured, with trams running along existing railway as far as [[Crystal Palace railway station|Crystal Palace Station]], and then round the western edge of [[Crystal Palace Park]] (within the park's perimeter) to the bus terminus near the parade. TfL has stated that due to lack of funding the plans for this extension will not be taken forward,<ref>[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/2055.aspx Tramlink extension to Crystal Palace]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref> but also says that it is committed to including new proposals for extensions to the tram as part of a future bid to Government.

===Extension A===
The Sutton to Wimbledon proposal utilises the existing line between Wimbledon and Morden Road, but the cramped terminus inside Wimbledon station is barely adequate for its present function. If another service is to serve Wimbledon a new terminus will be needed. Diverging from the present route, the Sutton line might adopt a segregated alignment within the highway along Morden Road, serving Morden station interchange. It would probably use Aberconway Road to reach Morden Hall Road before using the spacious St Helier Avenue as the direct route to St Helier, Rose Hill. St Helier Hospital is an important local traffic objective, despite the need to deviate from the direct route into Sutton via Angel Hill. A number of variants in Sutton Town centre are to be examined to see how the shopping centre, station and office complex can be accessed.
The alignment is served by busy bus routes and would give Tramlink direct with the Northern Line at Morden. A south-to-east curve may also be considered at Morden Road to permit direct links from St Helier to Mitcham and Croydon.<ref>[http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/19 Proposals to extend the Tramlink system] Always Touch Out</ref>

In July 2013, Mayor Boris Johnson affirmed that there is a reasonable business case for Tramlink to cover the Wimbledon - Sutton corridor. A map has been released showing the planned route. It would leave the existing route just to the east of Morden Road and head along the A24 and A297 to Rosehill Roundabout, then the B2230 through Sutton town centre, ending at the station. A loop via St Helier Hospital and a possible extension to Royal Marsden Hospital also are shown. Stops would be at Morden Hall, Ivy Lodge, Boxley Road, Langdon Road, Middleton Road, Rosehill Roundabout, St Helier Hospital (on loop), Rosehill Park, Sutton Tennis Centre, Angel Hill, Sutton Green, High Street North, Crown Road (northbound only), St Nicholas Road (northbound only), Throwley Way (southbound only) and Sutton Station<ref>[http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/] Your Local Guardian: London Mayor Boris Johnson tells City Hall there is 'reasonable business case' for extending tram route to Sutton</ref>

===Extension B===
The other Sutton proposal, to Tooting, is more ambitious and contains many more challenges than Sutton/Wimbledon link. Apart from workshop/depot facilities and a curve required to link the line into the existing system, this extension would share no infrastructure with it. If "line 4" is realised ahead of this proposal, the Tooting line would have the St Helier to Sutton section in common. North of St Helier, the alignment is likely to fit across parkland and open space to take in the Willow Lane Industrial Estate before serving Mitcham town centre. There would be some commonality here with the short separate proposal for a spur from Mitcham Junction to Mitcham town centre. From here, the extension would seek to use the pedestrianised town centre before sharing the carriageway with all traffic in London Road south of Figge’s Marsh, with room for segregation beyond the junction with Streatham Road. The most difficult leg arises immediately the Merton/Wandsworth boundary is crossed and the most effective way of reaching Tooting Broadway from this point will stir much debate.

===North and south from Croydon===
[[File:Gb-tramlink-croydoncentre-09.jpg|right|thumb|A tram travelling on Church Street, Croydon]]
To the north and south of Croydon are some busy bus corridors, which derive from earlier tram routes. These include the [[Purley, London|Purley]] – Croydon – [[Streatham]] corridor, which is proposed for conversion to tram operation.<ref name=SLTBrochure>{{Cite web | url = http://www.tramlink.co.uk/extensions/SLTBrochure.pdf | format = PDF | title = South London Trams – Transport for Everyone – The case for extensions to Tramlink | publisher=South London Partnership | accessdate = 2 September 2008 }}</ref><ref name=spext>{{Cite web | title = Tramlink Extensions | url = http://www.tramlink.co.uk/extensions/index.shtml | publisher=Croydon Tramlink – The Unofficial Site | accessdate = 2 September 2008 }}</ref>

To the south of Croydon, the proposal is for the new route to diverge from the central Croydon loop and use a highway alignment, probably South End and Brighton Road, to Purley. Beyond Purley, an extension to [[Coulsdon]] will be investigated. As this would be close to the [[M23 motorway]], a possibility would be the construction of a [[park and ride]] site. Finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of Purley, where Brighton Road is the [[A23 road|A23 trunk road]].<ref name="spext"/>

To the north of Croydon, it is proposed to use a highway alignment based on London Road. To the south of [[Thornton Heath Pond]], the use of a shared carriageway is a possibility. North of this point the road becomes the A23 again, but there are likely to be some opportunities for [[trambaan]] type segregation to [[Norbury]] and between Norbury and Streatham, although Norbury is a pinch point. The proposal is to terminate the line at [[Streatham railway station]], providing an interchange to the extended [[East London Line]].<ref name="spext"/>

===Other extensions===
Work currently commissioned will check out proposals to extend to [[Biggin Hill]], [[Bromley]] town centre, [[Lewisham]], and [[Purley Way]]. If initial examination shows promise, further work could follow to firm up more detailed routings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/misc/print.php?artid=572767|title=Tram network prepares to spread its wings across southern region|accessdate=16 November 2007 |publisher=[[Newsquest|This is Local London]]}}</ref>

On 15 November 2010, a boy aged seven was hit by a tram at [[Fieldway tram stop]] whilst crossing the tracks on the way to school.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23897544-boy-7-hit-by-tram-in-croydon-rush-hour.do| title=Boy, seven, crushed by tram as he crosses tracks on way to school | author=Justin Davenport | date=15 November 2010|publisher=[[Evening Standard]]}}</ref> He was taken to [[St George's Hospital]] with serious leg injuries.

On 5 April 2011, a woman tripped over and was dragged under a moving tram. She was taken to hospital in a serious condition. She is believed to have been running to catch the tram outside East Croydon Station when she tripped and fell.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/8954834.UPDATE__Croydon_woman_dragged_under_tram_in_serious_condition/ | title=Croydon woman dragged under tram in serious condition | date=5 April 2011|publisher=This Is Local London}}</ref>

On 8 August 2011, track and overhead line equipment between [[Reeves Corner tram stop|Reeves Corner]] and [[Church Street tram stop|Church Street]] were severely damaged by fire when the [[House of Reeves]] store 40 metres away was set alight during the [[2011 England riots|riots in London]]. Services were  suspended when rioting and looting began in the area at around 21:30. The fire was at the junction between the lines to Reeves Corner, Church Street and [[Centrale tram stop|Centrale]] tram stops, meaning that all trams were blocked from getting into Croydon from the west.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

On 17 February 2012, a tram derailed at East Croydon station, causing major delays.<ref>{{cite news | title=Trams delayed after derailment at East Croydon | url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/localnews/9537597.Trams_delayed_after_derailment_at_East_Croydon/ | work=Croydon Guardian|date=17 February 2012}}</ref>
