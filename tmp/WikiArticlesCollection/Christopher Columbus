Those voyages, and his efforts to establish permanent settlements on the island of [[Hispaniola]], initiated the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]] of the [[New World]].

In the context of emerging western [[imperialism]] and [[Competition (economics)|economic competition]] between [[Monarchies in Europe|European kingdoms]] seeking wealth through the establishment of [[trade route]]s and colonies, Columbus' speculative proposal, to reach the [[East Indies]] by sailing westward, eventually received the support of the Spanish crown, which saw in it a chance to gain the upper hand over rival powers in the contest for the lucrative [[spice trade]] with [[Asia]]. During his first voyage in 1492, instead of reaching Japan as he had intended, Columbus landed in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas archipelago]], at a locale he named ''San Salvador''. Over the course of three more voyages, Columbus visited the [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]], as well as the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Venezuela]] and Central America, claiming them for the [[Spanish Empire]]. 

Though Columbus was not the first European explorer to reach the Americas (having been preceded by the [[Norsemen|Norse]] expedition led by [[Leif Ericson]] in the 11th century<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/nl/meadows/index_e.asp|title=Parks Canada – L'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site of Canada|publisher=Pc.gc.ca|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=29 July 2009}}</ref>), Columbus' voyages led to the first lasting European contact with the Americas, inaugurating a period of European exploration, conquest, and colonization that lasted for several centuries. They had, therefore, an enormous impact in the historical development of the modern Western world. Columbus himself saw his accomplishments primarily in the light of [[Christianization|spreading the Christian religion]].<ref name="EB-online"/>

Never admitting that he had reached a continent previously unknown to Europeans, rather than the East Indies he had set out for, Columbus called the inhabitants of the lands he visited ''indios'' (Spanish for "[[India]]ns").<ref>Hoxie, Frederic E. ed.

The name ''Christopher Columbus'' is the [[Anglicisation]] of the [[Latin]] '''Christophorus Columbus'''. His name in Italian is '''Cristoforo Colombo''', and in Spanish, it is '''Cristóbal Colón'''. Columbus was born before 31 October 1451 in territory of the Republic of [[Genoa]], part of modern Italy, though the exact location remains disputed.<ref>Phillips, William D., and Carla Rahn Phillips. ''The Worlds of Christopher Columbus''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992. Page 9.<br />"''Even with less than a complete record, however, scholars can state with assurance that Columbus was born in the republic of Genoa in northern Italy, although perhaps not in the city itself, and that his family made a living in the wool business as weavers and merchants&nbsp;... The two main early biographies of Columbus have been taken as literal truth by hundreds of writers, in large part because they were written by individual closely connected to Columbus or his writings.&nbsp;... Both biographies have serious shortcomings as evidence.''"</ref> His father was [[Domenico Colombo]], a middle-class wool weaver who worked both in Genoa and [[Savona]] and who also owned a cheese stand at which young Christopher worked as a helper. Christopher's mother was [[Susanna Fontanarossa]]. Bartolomeo, Giovanni Pellegrino, and Giacomo were his brothers. Bartolomeo worked in a [[cartography]] workshop in [[Lisbon]] for at least part of his adulthood.<ref name= britannica>Encyclopædia Britannica, 1993 ed., Vol. 16, pp. 605ff / Morison, ''Christopher Columbus'', 1955 ed., pp. 14ff</ref> He also had a sister named Bianchinetta.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bergreen|first=Lawrence|title=Columbus The Four Voyages, 1493–1504.|year=2012|publisher=Penguin Group USA|isbn=978-0-14-312210-4}}</ref>

Columbus never wrote in his native language, which is presumed to have been a [[Genoese dialect|Genoese variety of Ligurian]] (his name would translate in the 16th-century Genoese language as ''Christoffa''<ref>Rime diverse, Pavia, 1595, p. 117</ref> ''Corombo''<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=re4OAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA203#v=onepage&q&f=false |first=Torquato|last=Tasso|title=Ra Gerusalemme deliverâ|location=Genoa|year=1755|page=XV-32 |publisher=Ra Stamparia de Tarigo|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref> pron. {{IPA-lij|kriˈʃtɔffa kuˈɹuŋbu}}<ref>Çittara zeneize – [http://books.google.it/books?id=m9AFAAAAQAAJ&dq=Chitarra%20zeneize&pg=PP24#v=onepage&q=Chitarra%20zeneize&f=false Regole d'Ortografia], Genoa, 1745</ref><ref>Consulta ligure, ''Vocabolario delle parlate liguri'', SAGEP, 1982, ISBN 88-7058-044-X</ref>). In one of his writings, Columbus claims to have gone to the sea at the age of 10. In 1470, the Columbus family moved to Savona, where Domenico took over a tavern. In the same year, Columbus was on a Genoese ship hired in the service of [[René of Anjou|René I of Anjou]] to support his attempt to conquer the [[Kingdom of Naples]].

[[File:ColombusNotesToMarcoPolo.jpg|thumb|Columbus' notes in Latin, on the margins of his copy of ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'']]
In 1473, Columbus began his apprenticeship as business agent for the important Centurione, Di Negro and [[Spinola family|Spinola families]] of Genoa. Later, he allegedly made a trip to [[Chios]], a Genoese colony in the [[Aegean Sea]].<ref>"[http://web.archive.org/web/20080705111026/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/columbus.html Christopher Columbus]".

In 1477, he was possibly in [[Iceland]]. In 1479, Columbus reached his brother Bartolomeo in [[Lisbon]], while continuing trading for the Centurione family. He married [[Filipa Moniz Perestrelo]], daughter of the [[Porto Santo]] governor and Portuguese nobleman of [[Lombardy|Lombard]] origin [[Bartolomeu Perestrello]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Antonio Maria de |last=Freitas |title=The Wife of Columbus: With Genealogical Tree of the Perestrello and Moniz Families |publisher=Stettinger, Lambert & Co |location=New York |year=1893 |url=http://www.archive.org/details/wifeofcolumbus00frei}}</ref> In 1479 or 1480, his son [[Diego Columbus]] was born.

Encyclopædia Britannica Online.</ref> Some records report that Filipa died in 1485. It is also speculated that Columbus may have simply left his first wife. In either case, Columbus found a mistress in Spain in 1487, a 20-year-old orphan named [[Beatriz Enríquez de Arana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://columbus-day.123holiday.net/christopher_columbus_2.html|title=Christopher Columbus Biography Page 2|publisher=Columbus-day.123holiday.net |accessdate=29 July 2009}}</ref>

Ambitious, Columbus eventually learned Latin, Portuguese, and Castilian, and read widely about astronomy, geography, and history, including the works of [[Claudius Ptolemy]], Cardinal [[Pierre d'Ailly]]'s ''Imago Mundi'', the travels of [[Marco Polo]] and Sir [[John Mandeville]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', and [[Pope Pius II]]'s ''Historia Rerum Ubique Gestarum''. According to historian [[Edmund Morgan (historian)|Edmund Morgan]],

{{quote|Columbus was not a scholarly man.

Throughout his life, Columbus also showed a keen interest in the Bible and in [[Bible prophecy|Biblical prophecies]], and would often quote biblical texts in his letters and logs. For example, part of the argument that he submitted to the Spanish [[Catholic Monarchs]] when he sought their support for his proposed expedition to reach the Indies by sailing west was based on his reading of the [[2 Esdras|Second Book of Esdras]] (see [http://www.biblestudytools.com/tmba/2-esdras/6-42.html 2 Esdras 6:42], which Columbus took to mean that the Earth is made of six parts of land to one of water). Towards the end of his life, Columbus produced a ''[[Book of Prophecies]]'', in which his career as an explorer is interpreted in the light of [[Christian eschatology]] and of [[apocalypticism]].<ref name=britannica/>

== Quest for Asia ==
[[File:ColombusMap.jpg|thumb|"Columbus map", drawn ca. 1490 in the [[Lisbon]] workshop of Bartolomeo and Christopher Columbus<ref>"Marco Polo et le Livre des Merveilles", p. 37. ISBN 978-2-35404-007-9</ref>]]

=== Background ===
Under the [[Mongol Empire]]'s hegemony over Asia (the so-called ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'', or ''Mongol peace''), Europeans had long enjoyed a safe land passage, the so-called "[[Silk Road]]", to China and India, which were sources of valuable goods such as silk, spices, and [[opium|opiates]]. With the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, the land route to Asia became much more difficult and dangerous. Portuguese navigators, under the leadership of King [[John II of Portugal|John II]], sought to reach Asia by sailing around Africa. Major progress in this quest was achieved in 1488, when [[Bartolomeu Dias]] reached the [[Cape of Good Hope]], in what is now South Africa. Meanwhile, in the 1480s, the Columbus brothers had developed a different plan to reach the Indies (then construed roughly as all of south and east Asia) by sailing west across the "Ocean Sea", ''i.e.,'' the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].

=== Geographical considerations ===
[[Washington Irving]]'s 1828 biography of Columbus popularized the idea that Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because many Catholic theologians insisted that the [[Flat Earth|Earth was flat]].<ref name=book3>{{Cite book|first=Paul F|last=Boller|title=Not So!:Popular Myths about America from Columbus to Clinton|year=1995|isbn= 978-0-19-509186-1|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}</ref> In fact, most educated Westerners had understood that the Earth was [[Spherical Earth|spherical]] at least since the time of [[Aristotle]], who lived in the 4th century BC and whose works were widely studied and revered in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]].<ref>Russell, Jeffrey Burton 1991. ''[[Inventing the Flat Earth]]. Columbus and modern historians'', Praeger, New York, Westport, London 1991;<br />Zinn, Howard 1980. ''A People's History of the United States'', HarperCollins 2001. p. 2</ref> The sphericity of the Earth is also accounted for in the work of [[Ptolemy]], on which [[Geocentric model|ancient astronomy]] was largely based. Christian writers whose works clearly reflect the conviction that the Earth is spherical include Saint [[Bede]] the Venerable in his ''Reckoning of Time'', written around AD 723. In Columbus' time, the techniques of [[celestial navigation]], which use the position of the sun and the stars in the sky, together with the understanding that the Earth is a sphere, had long been in use by astronomers and were beginning to be implemented by mariners.<ref>See, e.g. [http://www.ion.org/museum/item_view.cfm?cid=6&scid=13&iid=25 "Mariner's Astrolabe"], Navigation Museum, Institute of Navigation</ref>

Where Columbus ''did'' differ from the view accepted by scholars in his day was in his estimate of the westward distance from Europe to Asia. Columbus' ideas in this regard were based on three factors: his low estimate of the size of the Earth, his high estimate of the size of the [[Eurasia]]n landmass, and his belief that Japan and other inhabited islands lay far to the east of the coast of China.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} In all three of these issues Columbus was both wrong and at odds with the scholarly consensus of his day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

As far back as the 3rd century BC, [[Eratosthenes]] had correctly computed the circumference of the Earth by using simple geometry and studying the shadows cast by objects at two different locations: [[Alexandria]] and Syene (modern-day [[Aswan]]).<ref name="Sagan 40,04147">Sagan, Carl. ''Cosmos''; the mean circumference of the Earth is {{convert|40041.47|km|0|abbr=on}}.</ref> Eratosthenes's results were confirmed by a comparison of stellar observations at Alexandria and [[Rhodes]], carried out by [[Posidonius]] in the 1st century BC. These measurements were widely known among scholars, but confusion about the old-fashioned units of distance in which they were expressed had led, in Columbus's day, to some debate about the exact size of the Earth.

[[File:Atlantic Ocean, Toscanelli, 1474.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli|Toscanelli]]'s notions of the geography of the Atlantic Ocean, which directly influenced Columbus' plans]]
From d'Ailly's ''Imago Mundi'' Columbus learned of [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathīr al-Farghānī|Alfraganus]]'s estimate that a degree of [[latitude]] (or a degree of [[longitude]] along the equator) spanned 56⅔ miles, but did not realize that this was expressed in the Arabic mile (about 1,830 m) rather than the shorter [[Roman mile]] with which he was familiar (1,480 m).<ref>Morison ([[#CITEREFMorison1942|1942, pp. 65, 93]]).</ref> He therefore estimated the circumference of the Earth to be about 30,200&nbsp;km, whereas the correct value is {{convert|40000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

Furthermore, most scholars accepted [[Ptolemy]]'s estimate that [[Eurasia]] spanned 180° [[longitude]], rather than the actual 130° (to the Chinese mainland) or 150° (to Japan at the latitude of Spain). Columbus, for his part, believed the even higher estimate of [[Marinus of Tyre]], which put the longitudinal span of the Eurasian landmass at 225°, leaving only 135° of water. He also believed that Japan (which he called "Cipangu", following [[Marco Polo]]) was much larger, farther to the east from China ("Cathay"), and closer to the equator than it is, and that there were inhabited islands even farther to the east than Japan, including the mythical [[Antillia]], which he thought might lie not much farther to the west than the [[Azores]]. In this, he was influenced by the ideas of Florentine physician [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]], who corresponded with Columbus before his death in 1482 and who also defended the feasibility of a westward route to Asia.<ref name="Morison-Admiral">[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: The Life of Christopher Columbus'', (Boston: Atlantic-Little, Brown, 1942). Reissued by the Morison Press, 2007. ISBN 1-4067-5027-1</ref>

Columbus therefore estimated the distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan to be about 3,000 Italian miles (3,700&nbsp;km, or 2,300 statute miles), while the correct figure is {{convert|19600|km|mi|abbr=on}},{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}<!--- citation needs to clarify what distance 19600km is referring to---> or about 12,000&nbsp;km along a [[great circle]]. No ship in the 15th century could carry enough food and fresh water for such a long voyage, and the dangers involved in navigating through the uncharted ocean would have been formidable. Most European navigators reasonably concluded that a westward voyage from Europe to Asia was unfeasible. The [[Catholic Monarchs]], however, having completed [[Reconquista|an expensive war]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], were desperate for a competitive edge over other European countries in the quest for trade with the Indies. Columbus promised such an advantage.

=== Nautical considerations ===
Though Columbus was wrong about the number of degrees of longitude that separated Europe from the Far East and about the distance that each degree represented, he did possess valuable knowledge about the [[trade winds]], which would prove to be the key to his successful navigation of the Atlantic Ocean. During his first voyage in 1492, the brisk trade winds from the east, commonly called "[[easterlies]]", propelled Columbus' fleet for five weeks, from the [[Canary Islands]] to [[The Bahamas]]. To return to Spain against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique, called [[Close hauled#Close hauled|beating]], during which food and drinkable water would probably have been exhausted.

Instead, Columbus returned home by following the curving trade winds northeastward to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where he was able to catch the "[[westerlies]]" that blow eastward to the coast of [[Western Europe]]. There, in turn, the winds curve southward towards the Iberian Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|title=The First Voyage Log|accessdate=18 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/eurvoya/columbus.html|title=Christopher Columbus and the Spanish Empire|accessdate=18 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/virtualmuseum/climatechange1/08_1.shtml|title=Trade Winds and the Hadley Cell|accessdate=18 April 2008}}</ref>

It is unclear whether Columbus learned about the winds from his own sailing experience or if he had heard about them from others. The corresponding technique for efficient travel in the Atlantic appears to have been discovered first by the Portuguese, who referred to it as the ''[[Volta do mar]]'' ("turn of the sea"). Columbus' knowledge of the Atlantic wind patterns was, however, imperfect at the time of his first voyage. By sailing directly due west from the Canary Islands during [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|hurricane season]], skirting the so-called [[horse latitudes]] of the mid-Atlantic, Columbus risked either being becalmed or running into a [[tropical cyclone]], both of which he luckily avoided.<ref name="Morison-Admiral" />

=== Quest for support ===
In 1485, Columbus presented his plans to [[John II of Portugal|John II]], [[King of Portugal]]. He proposed that the king equip three sturdy ships and grant Columbus one year's time to sail out into the Atlantic, search for a western route to the [[Orient]], and return.

[[File:Monumento a Colón (Madrid) 02b.jpg|thumb|Columbus and Queen Isabella. Detail of the Columbus monument in [[Madrid]] (1885).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderkrogt.net/statues/object.php?webpage=CO&record=es034|title=Columbus Monuments Pages: Madrid| accessdate=3 January 2010}}</ref>]]
Columbus also requested he be made "Great Admiral of the Ocean", appointed governor of any and all lands he discovered, and given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands.

The king submitted Columbus' proposal to his experts, who rejected it. It was their considered opinion that Columbus' estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km|-1}} was, in fact, far too low.<ref name="Morison-Admiral"/>

In 1488, Columbus appealed to the court of Portugal once again, and once again, John II invited him to an audience. That meeting also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards [[Bartolomeu Dias]] returned to Portugal with news of his successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa (near the [[Cape of Good Hope]]). With an eastern sea route to Asia apparently at hand, King John was no longer interested in Columbus's far-fetched project.

Columbus traveled from Portugal to both [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], but he received encouragement from neither. Columbus had also dispatched his brother [[Bartholomew Columbus|Bartholomew]] to the court of [[Henry VII of England]], to inquire whether the English crown might sponsor his expedition, but also without success.

Columbus had sought an audience from the monarchs [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]], who had united many kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula by marrying, and were ruling together. On 1 May 1486, permission having been granted, Columbus presented his plans to Queen Isabella, who, in turn, referred it to a committee. After the passing of much time, the [[expert|savants]] of Spain, like their counterparts in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], replied that Columbus had grossly underestimated the distance to Asia. They pronounced the idea impractical and advised their Royal Highnesses to pass on the proposed venture.

However, to keep Columbus from taking his ideas elsewhere, and perhaps to keep their options open, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] gave him an annual allowance of 12,000 ''[[maravedis]]'' and, in 1489, furnished him with a letter ordering all cities and towns under their domain to provide him food and lodging at no cost.<ref>Durant, Will ''The Story of Civilization'' vol. vi, "The Reformation".

U.S. stamps reflecting the most commonly held view as to what Columbus' first fleet might have looked like. The ''[[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa Maria]]'', the flagship of Columbus' fleet, was a [[carrack]]—a merchant ship of between 400 and 600 tons, {{convert|75|ft|m}} long, with a beam of {{convert|25|ft|m}}, allowing it to carry more people and cargo. It had a deep draft of {{convert|6|ft|m}}. The vessel had three masts: a mainmast, a foremast, and a mizzenmast. Five sails altogether were attached to these masts. Each mast carried one large sail. The foresail and mainsail were square; the sail on the mizzen was a triangular sail known as a lateen mizzen. The ship had a smaller topsail on the mainmast above the mainsail and on the foremast above the foresail. In addition, the ship carried a small square sail, a [[spritsail (square-rigged)|spritsail]], on the [[bowsprit]].</span><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/christopher-columbus-ships.htm|title=Christopher Columbus Ships|publisher=Elizabethan-era.org.uk|accessdate=29 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evgschool.org/Columbus%27s%20Sailing%20Ships.htm|title=Columbus' Sailing Ships|publisher=Evgschool.org|accessdate=29 July 2010}}</ref>]]

=== Agreement with the Spanish crown ===
After continually lobbying at the [[Cortes Generales|Spanish court]] and two years of negotiations, he finally had success in 1492. Ferdinand and Isabella had just conquered [[Granada]], the last [[Al-Andalus|Muslim stronghold]] on the Iberian Peninsula, and they received Columbus in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], in the ''[[Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos|Alcázar]]'' castle. Isabella turned Columbus down on the advice of her [[confessor]], and he was leaving town by mule in despair, when Ferdinand intervened. Isabella then sent a royal guard to fetch him, and Ferdinand later claimed credit for being "the principal cause why those islands were discovered".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=William D.|last2=Phillips|first2=Carla Rahn|title=The Worlds of Christopher Columbus|year= 1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44652-5|page=132}}</ref>

About half of the financing was to come from private Italian investors, whom Columbus had already lined up. Financially broke after the Granada campaign, the monarchs left it to the royal treasurer to shift funds among various royal accounts on behalf of the enterprise. Columbus was to be made "Admiral of the Seas" and would receive a portion of all profits. The terms were unusually generous, but as his son [[Diego Columbus|Diego]] later wrote,{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} the monarchs did not really expect him to return.

In the "[[Capitulations of Santa Fe]]", King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella promised Columbus that if he succeeded he would be given the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and appointed Viceroy and Governor of all the new lands he could claim for Spain. He had the right to nominate three persons, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to 10% of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity. Additionally, he would also have the option of buying one-eighth interest in any commercial venture with the new lands and receive one-eighth of the profits.<ref name="Morison-Admiral">[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: The Life of Christopher Columbus'', (Boston: Atlantic-Little, Brown, 1942) p. 105.

Columbus was later arrested in 1500 and dismissed from his posts. He and his sons, Diego and Fernando, then conducted a lengthy series of court cases against the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian crown]], known as the ''[[pleitos colombinos]]'', alleging that the Crown had illegally reneged on its contractual obligations to Columbus and his heirs. The Columbus family had some success in their first litigation, as a judgment of 1511 confirmed Diego's position as Viceroy, but reduced his powers. Diego resumed litigation in 1512, which lasted until 1536, and further disputes continued until 1790.<ref>Mark McDonald, "Ferdinand Columbus, Renaissance Collector (1488–1539)", 2005, British Museum Press, ISBN 978-0-7141-2644-9</ref>

[[File:Viajes de colon en.svg|thumb|left|300px|Voyages of Christopher Columbus]]
Between 1492 and 1503, Columbus completed four round-trip voyages between Spain and the Americas, all of them under the sponsorship of the [[Crown of Castile]]. These voyages marked the beginning of the [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[Age of Discovery|exploration]] and [[History of colonialism|colonization]] of [[Americas|the American continents]], and are thus of enormous significance in [[Western history]]. Columbus always insisted, in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary, that the lands that he visited during those voyages were part of the Asian continent, as previously described by [[Marco Polo]] and other European travelers.<ref name=britannica /> Columbus' refusal to accept that the lands he had visited and claimed for Spain were not part of Asia might explain, in part, why the American continent was named after the [[Florence|Florentine]] explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and not after Columbus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.sunysb.edu/surgery/america.html|title=The Naming of America|publisher=Umc.sunysb.edu|accessdate=10 April 2011}}</ref>

=== First voyage ===
[[File:Landing of Columbus (2).jpg|thumb|12 October 1492 – Christopher Columbus discovers [[Americas|The Americas]] for [[Spain]], painting by [[John Vanderlyn]].]]
On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from [[Palos de la Frontera]] with three ships: a larger [[carrack]], the ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'' ex-''Gallega'' ("Galician"), and two smaller [[caravel]]s, the ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' ("Painted") and the ''Santa Clara'', nicknamed the ''[[Niña]]'' (<small>lit.</small> "Girl") after her owner Juan Niño of Moguer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenina.com/the_original_nina.html |title=THE ORIGINAL NIÑA |website=The Niña & Pinta |publisher=The Columbus Foundation |location=British Virgin Islands |accessdate=October 12, 2013}}</ref> The monarchs forced the [[Palos de la Frontera|Palos]] inhabitants to contribute to the expedition. The ''Santa María'' was owned by [[Juan de la Cosa]] and captained by Columbus. The ''Pinta'' and the ''Niña'' were piloted by the [[Pinzón brothers]] ([[Martín Alonso Pinzón|Martín Alonso]] and [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzón|Vicente Yáñez]]).

Columbus first sailed to the [[Canary Islands]], which belonged to [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], where he restocked the provisions and made repairs. After stopping over in [[Gran Canaria]], he departed from [[San Sebastián de La Gomera]] on 6 September, for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean. A lookout on the ''Pinta'', [[Rodrigo de Triana]] (also known as Juan Rodríguez Bermeo), spotted land about 2:00 on the morning of 12 October, and immediately alerted the rest of the crew with a shout. Thereupon, the captain of the ''Pinta'', Martín Alonso Pinzón, verified the discovery and alerted Columbus by firing a [[lombard (gun)|lombard]].<ref>Morison ([[#CITEREFMorison1942|1942]], p. 226); Lopez, ([[#CITEREFLopez1990|1990]], [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=wyh9-rhsaQgC&pg=PT14#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 14]); Columbus & Toscanelli ([[#CITEREFColumbusToscanelli2010|2010]], [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=MI7dzFQZHOoC&pg=PA35 p. 35])</ref> Columbus later maintained that he himself had already seen a light on the land a few hours earlier, thereby claiming for himself the lifetime pension promised by Ferdinand and Isabella to the first person to sight land.<ref>Lopez, ([[#CITEREFLopez1990|1990]], [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=wyh9-rhsaQgC&pg=PT15#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 15])</ref>

[[File:Columbus first voyage.jpg|thumb|400px|First voyage. Modern placenames in black, Columbus' placenames in blue.]]
Columbus called the island (in what is now [[The Bahamas]]) ''San Salvador''; the natives called it [[Guanahani]]. Exactly which island in the Bahamas this corresponds to is unresolved. Prime candidates are [[San Salvador Island]] (so named in 1925 on the theory that it was Columbus' San Salvador),<ref>William D. Phillips Jr., 'Columbus, Christopher', in David Buisseret (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to World Exploration'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, online edition 2012).</ref> [[Samana Cay]], and [[Plana Cays]].

The [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] he encountered, the [[Lucayan]], [[Taíno people|Taíno]], or [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]], were peaceful and friendly. Noting their gold ear ornaments, Columbus took some of the Arawaks prisoner and insisted that they guide him to the source of the gold.<ref name=Zinn>{{cite book|last=Zinn|first=Howard|title=A People's History of the United States|year=2003|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-052837-0|pages=1–22}}</ref> From the 12 October 1492 entry in his journal, in which he wrote of them, "Many of the men I have seen have scars on their bodies, and when I made signs to them to find out how this happened, they indicated that people from other nearby islands come to San Salvador to capture them; they defend themselves the best they can. I believe that people from the mainland come here to take them as slaves. They ought to make good and skilled servants, for they repeat very quickly whatever we say to them. I think they can very easily be made Christians, for they seem to have no religion. If it pleases our Lord, I will take six of them to Your Highnesses when I depart, in order that they may learn our language."<ref>Robert H. Fuson, ed., ''The Log of Christopher Columbus'', Tab Books, 1992, International Marine Publishing, ISBN 0-87742-316-4.</ref> He remarked that their lack of modern weaponry and even metal-forged swords or pikes was a tactical vulnerability, writing, "I could conquer the whole of them with 50 men, and govern them as I pleased."<ref>Columbus ([[#CITEREFColumbus1991|1991]], [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=OxbLxcS5uYgC&pg=PA87 p. 87]). Or "for with fifty men they can all be subjugated and made to do what is required of them." (Columbus & Toscanelli, [[#CITEREFColumbusToscanelli2010|2010]], [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=MI7dzFQZHOoC&pg=PA41 p. 41])</ref>

Columbus also explored the northeast coast of [[Cuba]], where he landed on 28 October. On 22 November, Martín Alonso Pinzón took the ''Pinta'' on an unauthorized expedition in search of an island called "Babeque" or "Baneque", which the natives had told him was rich in gold. Columbus, for his part, continued to the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]], where he landed on 5 December.<ref name="Pickering-1st">Keith A. Pickering, [http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1.shtml The First Voyage of Columbus]</ref>

There, the ''Santa María'' ran aground on Christmas Day 1492 and had to be abandoned. Columbus was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind. Columbus left 39 men, including [[Luis de Torres]], the Converso interpreter, who spoke Hebrew and Arabic, and founded the settlement of ''[[La Navidad]]'' at the site of present-day [[Môle-Saint-Nicolas]], Haiti.<ref>{{cite web|author=Maclean, Frances|title=The Lost Fort of Columbus|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/fort-of-columbus-200801.html|publisher=[[Smithsonian Magazine]]|month=January|year=2008|accessdate=24 January 2008}}</ref> Columbus took more natives prisoner and continued his exploration.<ref name=Zinn/> He kept sailing along the northern coast of Hispaniola with a single ship, until he encountered Pinzón and the ''Pinta'' on 6 January.

On 13 January 1493, Columbus made his last stop of this voyage in the New World. He landed on the [[Samaná Peninsula]], where he met the hostile Ciguayos who presented him with his only violent resistance during his first voyage to the Americas. The Ciguayos had refused to trade the amount of bows and arrows that Columbus desired; in the ensuing violence two were stabbed to death.<ref name=Zinn/> Because of this and because of the Ciguayos' use of arrows, he called the inlet where he met them [[Bay of Arrows|the Bay of Arrows (or Gulf of Arrows)]].<ref>Oliver Dunn and James Kelly, The Diario of Christopher Columbus' First Voyage to America (London: University of Oklahoma Press), 333–343.</ref> Today, the place is called the Bay of Rincón, in Samaná, the [[Dominican Republic]].<ref>Robert Fuson, The Log of Christopher Columbus (Camden, International Marine, 1987) 173.</ref> Columbus kidnapped about 10 to 25 natives and took them back with him (only seven or eight of the native ''Indians'' arrived in Spain alive, but they made quite an impression on [[Seville]]).<ref name=book2>{{cite book|author=James W.

Columbus headed for Spain, but another storm forced him into [[Lisbon]]. He anchored next to the King's harbor patrol ship on 4 March 1493 in Portugal. After spending more than one week in Portugal, he set sail for Spain. He crossed the bar of Saltes and entered the harbor of [[Palos de la Frontera|Palos]] on 15 March 1493. Word of his finding new lands [[Columbus Letter on the First Voyage|rapidly spread throughout Europe]].

=== Second voyage ===
[[File:Inspiracion de Cristobal Colon by Jose Maria Obregon, 1856.jpg|220px|thumb|left|right|''The Inspiration of Christopher Columbus'' by [[José María Obregón]], 1856.]]
Columbus left the port of [[Cadiz]] on 24 September 1493, with a fleet of [[Columbus's second voyage|17 ships]] carrying 1,200 men and the supplies to establish permanent colonies in the New World. The passengers included priests, farmers, and soldiers, who would be the new colonists. This reflected the new policy of creating not just "colonies of exploitation", but also "colonies of settlement" from which to launch missions dedicated to converting the natives to Christianity.<ref>Baccus, M. Kazim ''Utilization, Misuse, and Development of Human Resources in the Early West Indian Colonies'', Wilfrid Laurier University Press (2 January 2000) ISBN 978-0-88920-982-4 pp. 6–7</ref> Modern studies suggest that, as reported by the ''Washington Post'', "crew members may have included free black Africans who arrived in the New World about a decade before the slave trade began."<ref>"[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/17/AR2009051701885.html Who Went With Columbus? Dental Studies Give Clues.]". [[The Washington Post]]. 18 May 2009.</ref>

As in the first voyage, the fleet stopped at the [[Canary Islands]], from which it departed on 13 October, following a more southerly course than on the previous expedition. On 3 November, Columbus sighted a rugged island that he named [[Dominica]] (Latin for Sunday); later that day, he landed at [[Marie-Galante]], which he named ''Santa María la Galante''. After sailing past [[Les Saintes]] (''Los Santos'', "The Saints"), he arrived at the island of [[Guadeloupe]], which he named ''[[Santa María de Guadalupe]] de Extremadura'', after the image of the Virgin Mary venerated at the Spanish monastery of [[Villuercas]], in [[Guadalupe, Cáceres]], Spain. He explored that island from 4 to 10 November.

Michele da Cuneo, Columbus' childhood friend from [[Savona]], sailed with Columbus during the second voyage and wrote: "In my opinion, since Genoa was Genoa, there was never born a man so well equipped and expert in the art of navigation as the said lord Admiral."<ref>Felipe Fernández-Armesto, ''Columbus,'' Oxford Univ. Press, (1991) pp. 103–104</ref> Columbus named the small island of "Saona&nbsp;... to honor Michele da Cuneo, his friend from Savona."<ref>Paolo Emilio Taviani, ''Columbus the Great Adventure,'' Orion Books, New York (1991) p. 185</ref> The same childhood friend reported in a letter that Columbus had provided one of the captured indigenous women to him. He wrote, "While I was in the boat, I captured a very beautiful Carib woman, whom the said Lord Admiral gave to me. When I had taken her to my cabin she was naked—as was their custom. I was filled with a desire to take my pleasure with her and attempted to satisfy my desire. She was unwilling, and so treated me with her nails that I wished I had never begun. But—to cut a long story short—I then took a piece of rope and whipped her soundly, and she let forth such incredible screams that you would not have believed your ears. Eventually we came to such terms, I assure you, that you would have thought that she had been brought up in a school for whores."<ref>{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=J.M.|title=The Four Voyages of Christopher Columbus|year=1969|publisher=Penguin|location=NY|isbn=978-0-14-044217-5|page=139}}</ref> This letter has been interpreted by some as providing evidence that Columbus knowingly aided the rape of captured indigenous people.<ref name=hazlehurst>{{cite book|last=Hazlehurst|first=Kayleen M.|title=Popular justice and community regeneration: pathways of indigenous reform|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0275951316|pages=124}}</ref>

Pedro de las Casas, father of the priest [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], also accompanied Columbus on this voyage.<ref name="traboulay">{{cite book|last=Traboulay|first=David M.|title=Columbus and Las Casas|year=1994|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=0-8191-9642-8|page=48|url=http://books.google.com/?id=7Jmi4Wb1DdsC&pg=PA48&dq=pedro+de+las+casas+columbus#v=onepage&q=pedro%20de%20las%20casas%20columbus&f=false}}</ref>

[[File:Columbus second voyage.jpg|thumb|500px|Second voyage]]

The exact course of Columbus' voyage through the [[Lesser Antilles]] is debated, but it seems likely that he turned north, sighting and naming several islands, including:
* [[Montserrat]] (for Santa María de Montserrate, after the Blessed Virgin of the [[Monastery of Montserrat]], which is located on the Mountain of Montserrat, in Catalonia, Spain),
* [[Antigua]] (after a church in [[Seville]], Spain, called Santa María la Antigua, meaning "Old St. Mary's"),
* [[Redonda]] (''Santa María la Redonda'', Spanish for "St. Mary the Round", owing to the island's shape),
* [[Nevis]] (derived from the Spanish ''Nuestra Señora de las Nieves'', "Our Lady of the Snows", because Columbus thought the clouds over Nevis Peak made the island resemble a snow-capped mountain),
* [[Saint Kitts]] (for [[St. Christopher]], patron of sailors and travelers),
* [[Sint Eustatius]] (for the early Roman martyr, [[Saint Eustace|St. Eustachius]]),
* [[Saba]] (after the Biblical [[Queen of Sheba]]),
* [[Saint Martin]] (''San Martín''), and
* [[Saint Croix]] (from the Spanish ''Santa Cruz'', meaning "[[Christian cross|Holy Cross]]").

Columbus also sighted the chain of the [[Virgin Islands]], which he named ''Islas de Santa Úrsula y las Once Mil Vírgenes'', "Islands of [[Saint Ursula]] and the 11,000 Virgins" (shortened, both on maps of the time and in common parlance, to ''Islas Vírgenes''). He also named the islands of [[Virgin Gorda]] ("Fat Virgin"), [[Tortola]], and [[Peter Island]] (''San Pedro'').

He continued to the [[Greater Antilles]], and landed in [[Puerto Rico]], which he named ''San Juan Bautista'' in honor of [[Saint John the Baptist]] (a name that was later retained only for the capital city of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]). One of the first skirmishes between [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native Americans]] and Europeans since the time of the Vikings<ref name=book1>{{Cite book|author=Phillips, Jr., William D. & Carla Rahn Phillips|title=The Worlds of Christopher Columbus|year=1992|isbn= 978-0-521-35097-6|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}</ref> occurred when Columbus's men rescued two boys who had just been castrated by their captors.

On 22 November, Columbus returned to Hispaniola, where he intended to visit the fort of [[La Navidad]], built during his first voyage and located on the northern coast of [[Haiti]]. Columbus found the fort in ruins, destroyed by the native [[Taíno people|Taino]] people.<ref>[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/taino/taino-conquest.htm "The Spanish Conquest of the Tainos"] – Latin American Studies – Retrieved 10 July 2011.</ref> Among the ruins were the corpses of 11 of the 39 Spaniards who had stayed behind as the first colonists in the New World.

In retaliation for the attack on La Navidad, Columbus demanded that each [[Taíno people|Taino]] over 14 years of age deliver a hawk's bell full of gold powder every three months or, when this was lacking, twenty-five pounds of spun cotton. If this tribute was not delivered, the Taínos had their hands cut off and were left to bleed to death. Columbus then sailed more than 100 kilometers eastwards along the northern coast of Hispaniola, establishing a new settlement, which he called [[La Isabela]], in the present-day [[Dominican Republic]].<ref>"[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090319132954.htm Teeth Of Columbus's Crew Flesh Out Tale Of New World Discovery]". ''ScienceDaily''. 20 March 2009.</ref> However, [[La Isabela]] proved to be poorly located and the settlement was short-lived.

Columbus left Hispaniola on 24 April 1494, arriving at [[Cuba]] (which he named ''Juana'') on 30 April. He explored the southern coast of Cuba, which he believed to be part of a peninsula attached to mainland Asia, as well as several nearby islands, including the [[Isla de la Juventud|Isle of Pines]] (which he named ''La Evangelista'', "The Evangelist"). He reached [[Jamaica]] on 5 May.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} He retraced his route to Hispaniola, arriving on 20 August, before he finally returned to Spain.

=== Third voyage ===
On 30 May 1498, Columbus left with [[Columbus' third voyage|six ships]] from [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda|Sanlúcar, Spain]], for his third trip to the New World. Three of the ships headed directly for Hispaniola with much-needed supplies, while Columbus took the other three in an exploration of what might lie to the south of the Caribbean islands he had already visited, including a hope-for passage to continental Asia.<ref name="Minster-3rd">Christopher Minster, [http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/thevoyagesofcolumbus/p/columbusthird.htm "The Third Voyage of Christopher Columbus"]</ref>

[[File:Columbus third voyage.jpg|thumb|500px|Third voyage]]

Columbus led his fleet to the Portuguese island of [[Porto Santo]], his wife's native land. He then sailed to [[Madeira]] and spent some time there with the Portuguese captain João Gonçalves da Camara, before sailing to the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Cape Verde]]. As he crossed the Atlantic, Columbus discovered that the angle between North as indicated by a magnetic compass and North as measured by the position of the [[pole star]] changed with his position (a phenomenon now known as "[[Magnetic declination|compass variation]]"). He would later use his previous measurements of the compass variation to adjust his reckoning.<ref name="EB-online" />

After being becalmed for several days in the [[doldrums]] of the mid-Atlantic, Columbus' fleet regained its wind and, dangerously low on water, turned north in the direction of [[Dominica]], which Columbus had visited in his previous voyage. The ships landed on the southern coast of the island of [[Trinidad]] on 31 July. After resupplying with food and water, from 4 to 12 August Columbus explored the [[Gulf of Paria]], which separates Trinidad from what is now [[Venezuela]], near the delta of the [[Orinoco River]]. He then touched the mainland of South America at the [[Paria Peninsula]].

Columbus correctly interpreted the enormous quantity of fresh water that the Orinoco delivered into the Atlantic Ocean as evidence that he had reached a continental landmass. As he sailed the Gulf of Paria, he observed the diurnal rotation of the pole star in the sky, which he erroneously interpreted as evidence that the Earth was not perfectly spherical, but rather bulged out like a pear around the new-found continent.<ref name="EB-online" /> He also speculated that the new continent might be the location of the biblical [[Garden of Eden]]. He then sailed to the islands of [[Chacachacare]] and [[Margarita Island|Margarita]]. He sighted [[Tobago]] (which he named "Bella Forma") and [[Grenada]] (which he named "Concepción").

In poor health, Columbus returned to [[Hispaniola]] on 19 August, only to find that many of the Spanish settlers of the new colony were in rebellion against his rule, claiming that Columbus had misled them about the supposedly bountiful riches of the New World. A number of returning settlers and sailors lobbied against Columbus at the [[Cortes Generales|Spanish court]], accusing him and his brothers of gross mismanagement. Columbus had some of his crew hanged for disobedience. He had an economic interest in the enslavement of the Hispaniola natives and for that reason was not eager to baptize them, which attracted criticism from some churchmen.<ref name = "varela">Varela ([[#CITEREFVarela2006|2006]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=SwtMUtesSDEC&pg=PA111&hl=es#v=onepage&q&f=false p.111])</ref> An entry in his journal from September 1498 reads: "From here one might send, in the name of the Holy Trinity, as many slaves as could be sold&nbsp;..."

Columbus was eventually forced to make peace with the rebellious colonists on humiliating terms.<ref name="Pickering-3rd">Keith A. Pickering, [http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v3.shtml "The Third Voyage of Columbus, 1498–1500"]</ref> In 1500, the Crown had him removed as governor, arrested, and transported in chains to Spain (see [[Christopher Columbus#Accusations of tyranny and genocide during governorship|"Accusations of tyranny and genocide during governorship"]] section below). He was eventually freed and allowed to return to the New World, but not as governor.

=== Fourth voyage ===
[[File:Columbus fourth voyage.jpg|thumb|400px|Fourth voyage]]
Before leaving for his fourth voyage, Columbus wrote a letter to the Governors of the Bank of St. George, Genoa, dated at Seville, 2 April 1502.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TKgKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA128|title='Letter from Christopher Columbus to the Governors of the Bank of St. George, Genoa. Dated at Seville, April 2nd, 1502'|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=10 April 2011|year=1894}}</ref> He wrote "Although my body is here my heart is always near you."<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TKgKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA129|title=The authentic letters of Columbus – Google Books|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=29 July 2010|year=1894}}</ref>

Columbus made a fourth voyage nominally in search of the [[Strait of Malacca]] to the Indian Ocean. Accompanied by his brother [[Bartolomeo Columbus|Bartolomeo]] and his 13-year-old son [[Fernando Colón|Fernando]], he left [[Cadiz]] on 11 May 1502, with his flagship ''Santa María''<!--not ''Capitana''; that just means "flagship"--> and the vessels ''Gallega'', ''Vizcaína'', and ''Santiago de Palos''. He sailed to [[Arzila]] on the Moroccan coast to rescue [[Portugal|Portuguese]] soldiers whom he had heard were under siege by the [[Moors]]. On 15 June they landed at Carbet on the island of [[Martinique]] (''Martinica''). A [[hurricane]] was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on [[Hispaniola]]. He arrived at [[Santo Domingo]] on 29 June but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction. Instead, while Columbus' ships sheltered at the mouth of the Rio Jaina, the first [[Spanish treasure fleet]] sailed into the hurricane. Columbus' ships survived with only minor damage, while 29 of the 30 ships in the governor's fleet were lost to [[1492-1524 Atlantic hurricane seasons|the 1 July storm]]. In addition to the ships, 500 lives (including that of the governor, [[Francisco de Bobadilla]]) and an immense cargo of gold were surrendered to the sea.

After a brief stop at [[Jamaica]], Columbus sailed to Central America, arriving at [[Guanaja|Guanaja (Isla de Pinos)]] in the [[Islas de la Bahía department|Bay Islands]] off the coast of [[Honduras]] on 30 July. Here Bartolomeo found native merchants and a large canoe, which was described as "long as a galley" and was filled with cargo. On 14 August he landed on the continental mainland at [[Puerto Castilla, Honduras|Puerto Castilla]], near [[Trujillo, Honduras]]. He spent two months exploring the coasts of Honduras, [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]], before arriving in [[Almirante, Bocas del Toro|Almirante]] Bay in [[Panama]] on 16 October.

On 5 December 1502, Columbus and his crew found themselves in a storm unlike any they had ever experienced. In his journal Columbus writes,

{{quote|For nine days I was as one lost, without hope of life. Eyes never beheld the sea so angry, so high, so covered with foam. The wind not only prevented our progress, but offered no opportunity to run behind any headland for shelter; hence we were forced to keep out in this bloody ocean, seething like a pot on a hot fire. Never did the sky look more terrible; for one whole day and night it blazed like a furnace, and the lightning broke with such violence that each time I wondered if it had carried off my spars and sails; the flashes came with such fury and frightfulness that we all thought that the ship would be blasted. All this time the water never ceased to fall from the sky; I do not say it rained, for it was like another deluge. The men were so worn out that they longed for death to end their dreadful suffering.<ref>Morison, Samuel Eliot, ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', Boston, 1942, p. 617.</ref>}}

[[File:Eclipse Chistophe Colomb.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Columbus awes the Jamaican natives by predicting the [[lunar eclipse]] of 1504.]]

In Panama, Columbus learned from the [[Ngobe]] of gold and a strait to another ocean, but was told by local leader [[Quibían]] not to go past a certain point down the river. After much exploration, in January 1503 he established a [[garrison]] at the mouth of the [[Belén River]]. On 6 April one of the ships became stranded in the river. At the same time, the garrison was attacked by Quibían and the other ships were damaged. [[Shipworm]]s also damaged the ships in tropical waters.<ref>The History Channel. Columbus: The Lost Voyage.</ref> Columbus left for Hispaniola on 16 April heading north. On 10 May he sighted the [[Cayman Islands]], naming them "''Las Tortugas''" after the numerous [[sea turtle]]s there. His ships next sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of Cuba. Unable to travel farther, on 25 June 1503 they were beached in [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|St.&nbsp;Ann's Bay, Jamaica]].

For one year Columbus and his men remained stranded on [[Jamaica]]. A Spaniard, Diego Méndez, and some natives paddled a [[canoe]] to get help from [[Hispaniola]]. The governor, [[Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres]], detested Columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men. In the meantime Columbus, in a desperate effort to induce the natives to continue provisioning him and his hungry men, successfully won their favor by predicting a [[February 1504 lunar eclipse|lunar eclipse for 29 February 1504]], using [[Abraham Zacuto]]'s astronomical charts.<ref>Joy Jakim, ''The First Americans: Prehistory–1600 A History of US'' Oxford University Press 2005</ref><ref>Clayton J., Drees, ''The Late Medieval Age of Crisis and Renewal: 1300–1500 a Biographical Dictionary'', 2001, pp. 511</ref><ref>Djelal , Kadir, ''Columbus and the Ends of the Earth: Europe's Prophetic Rhetoric As Conquering Ideology.'',University of California Press, 1992, pp. 67–68</ref> Help finally arrived, no thanks to the governor, on 29 June 1504, and Columbus and his men arrived in [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda|Sanlúcar, Spain]], on 7 November.

==Accusations of tyranny and genocide during governorship==
Following his first voyage, Columbus was appointed Viceroy and Governor of the Indies under the terms of the [[Capitulations of Santa Fe]]. In practice, this primarily entailed the administration of the colonies in the island of [[Hispaniola]], whose capital was established in [[Santo Domingo]].

By the end of his third voyage, Columbus was physically and mentally exhausted: his body was wracked by [[arthritis]] and his eyes by [[ophthalmia]]. In October 1499, he sent two ships to Spain, asking the Court of Spain to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern.

By this time, accusations of tyranny and incompetence on the part of Columbus had also reached the Court. Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand responded by removing Columbus from power and replacing him with [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], a member of the [[Order of Calatrava]].

Bobadilla, who ruled as governor from 1500 until his death in a storm in 1502, had also been tasked by the Court with investigating the accusations of brutality made against Columbus. Arriving in Santo Domingo while Columbus was away in the explorations of his [[Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|Third voyage]], Bobadilla was immediately met with complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolomé, and Diego. A recently discovered report by de Bobadilla alleges that Columbus regularly used [[torture]] and [[mutilation]] to govern Hispaniola. The 48-page report, found in 2006 in the state archive in the Spanish city of [[Valladolid]], contains testimonies from 23 people, including both enemies and supporters of Columbus, about Columbus and his brothers' treatment of colonial subjects during his seven-year rule.<ref name=newspaper1/>

According to the report, Columbus once punished a man found guilty of stealing corn by having his ears and nose cut off and then selling him into slavery. Testimony recorded in the report claims that Columbus congratulated his brother Bartolomé on "defending the family" when the latter ordered a woman paraded naked through the streets and then had her tongue cut out for suggesting that Columbus was of lowly birth.<ref name=newspaper1/>

The document also describes how Columbus put down native unrest and revolt; he first ordered a brutal crackdown in which many natives were killed and then paraded their [[dismemberment|dismembered]] bodies through the streets in an attempt to discourage further rebellion.<ref name=A&E>{{cite web |title=Columbus Controversy |url=http://www.history.com/topics/columbus-controversy |publisher=, A&E Television Networks |accessdate=12 August 2013}}</ref>

"Columbus's government was characterised by a form of tyranny," Consuelo Varela, a Spanish historian who has seen the document, told journalists.<ref name=newspaper1/> "Even those who loved him [Columbus] had to admit the atrocities that had taken place."<ref name=newspaper1>{{Cite news |author=[[Giles Tremlett]] |title=Lost document reveals Columbus as tyrant of the Caribbean |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/aug/07/books.spain |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=7 August 2006 |accessdate=16 May 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze - Columbus Before the Queen.JPG|thumb|''Columbus before the Queen'', as imagined<ref>The Brooklyn Museum catalogue notes that the most likely source for Leutze's trio of Columbus paintings is [[Washington Irving]]'s best-selling ''Life and Voyages of Columbus'' (1828).</ref> by [[Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze]], 1843]]

Based on these testimonies and with Bobadilla denying him the chance to offer a defense, Columbus, upon his return, was chained and imprisoned to await return to Spain. On 1 October 1500, Columbus and his two brothers, likewise in chains, were sent back to Spain.

Once in Cadiz, a grieving Columbus wrote to a friend at court:

{{quote|It is now seventeen years since I came to serve these princes with the Enterprise of the Indies. They made me pass eight of them in discussion, and at the end rejected it as a thing of jest. Nevertheless I persisted therein&nbsp;... Over there I have placed under their sovereignty more land than there is in Africa and Europe, and more than 1,700 islands&nbsp;... In seven years I, by the divine will, made that conquest. At a time when I was entitled to expect rewards and retirement, I was incontinently arrested and sent home loaded with chains&nbsp;... The accusation was brought out of malice on the basis of charges made by civilians who had revolted and wished to take possession on the land&nbsp;...

I beg your graces, with the zeal of faithful Christians in whom their Highnesses have confidence, to read all my papers, and to consider how I, who came from so far to serve these princes&nbsp;... now at the end of my days have been despoiled of my honor and my property without cause, wherein is neither justice nor mercy.<ref>[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', p. 576.</ref>}}

Other testimony from the period accuses Columbus of systematic brutality against the natives and engineering a program of forced labor that reduced their population from millions to thousands in little over a decade. The priest [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], son of the merchant Pedro de las Casas who accompanied Columbus on his second voyage, described Columbus' treatment of the natives in his ''[[History of the Indies]]'':
<blockquote>Endless testimonies...prove the mild and pacific temperament of the natives... But our work was to exasperate, ravage, kill, mangle and destroy; small wonder, then, if they tried to kill one of us now and then... The admiral (Columbus), it is true, was blind as those who came after him, and he was so anxious to please the King that he committed irreparable crimes against the Indians.<ref name=delaCasas>{{cite book|last=de las Casas|first=Bartolome|title=History of the Indies|year=1971|publisher=Harper & Row|location=New York}}</ref></blockquote>

Under Columbus and subsequent governors, enslaved Hispaniola natives were forced to toil under brutal conditions in mining and farming camps. According to Las Casas, up to a third of the male slaves died during each six- to eight-month mining operation. The mines were many miles away from the farms, and the enslaved men and the women only saw each other every eight to ten months. This segregation, along with the grueling conditions, took its toll on the native population:
<blockquote>Thus husbands and wives were together only once every eight or ten months and when they met they were so exhausted and depressed on both sides. . . they ceased to procreate. As for the newly born, they died early because their mothers, overworked and famished, had no milk to nurse them, and for this reason, while I was in Cuba, 7000 children died in three months. Some mothers even drowned their babies from sheer desperation.... In this way, husbands died in the mines, wives died at work, and children died from lack of milk . . . and in a short time this land which was so great, so powerful and fertile ... was depopulated.... My eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature, and now I tremble as I write...."<ref name=delaCasas/></blockquote>

De las Casas records in stark numbers the genocide that took place under Columbus and the Spaniards, writing that when he first came to Hispaniola in 1508, "there were 60,000 people living on this island, including the Indians; so that from 1494 to 1508, over three million people had perished from war, slavery, and the mines. Who in future generations will believe this? I myself writing it as a knowledgeable eyewitness can hardly believe it...."<ref name=delaCasas/>

Columbus and his brothers lingered in jail for six weeks before busy King Ferdinand ordered their release. Not long after, the king and queen summoned the Columbus brothers to the [[Alhambra]] palace in [[Granada]]. There the royal couple heard the brothers' pleas; restored their freedom and wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus' fourth voyage. But the door was firmly shut on Columbus' role as governor. Henceforth [[Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres]] was to be the new governor of the West Indies.

While Columbus had always given the conversion of non-believers as one reason for his explorations, he grew increasingly religious in his later years. Probably with the assistance of his son Diego and his friend the [[Carthusian]] monk Gaspar Gorricio, Columbus produced two books during his later years: a ''[[Book of Privileges]]'' (1502), detailing and documenting the rewards from the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]] to which he believed he and his heirs were entitled, and a ''[[Book of Prophecies]]'' (1505), in which passages from the Bible were used to place his achievements as an explorer in the context of [[Christian eschatology]].<ref name=britannica />

In his later years, Columbus demanded that the Spanish Crown give him 10% of all profits made in the new lands, as stipulated in the [[Capitulations of Santa Fe]]. Because he had been relieved of his duties as governor, the crown did not feel bound by that contract and his demands were rejected. After his death, his heirs sued the Crown for a part of the profits from trade with America, as well as other rewards. This led to a protracted series of legal disputes known as the ''[[pleitos colombinos]]'' ("Columbian lawsuits").

== Illness and death ==
During a violent storm on his first return voyage, Columbus, then approximately 41, suffered an attack of what was believed at the time to be [[gout]]. In subsequent years, he was plagued with what was thought to be [[influenza]] and other fevers, bleeding from the eyes, and prolonged attacks of gout. The suspected attacks increased in duration and severity, sometimes leaving Columbus bedridden for months at a time, and culminated in his death fourteen years later.

Based on Columbus' lifestyle and the described symptoms, modern doctors suspect that he suffered from [[reactive arthritis|Reiter's Syndrome]], rather than gout.<ref name=UMD/><ref name=Hoenig>{{cite journal|last=Hoenig|first=LJ|title=The arthritis of Christopher Columbus|journal=The Archives of Internal Medinal|year=1992|month=February|volume=152|issue=2|pmid=1472175|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1472175|accessdate=11 August 2013|doi=10.1001/archinte.1992.00400140028008|pages=274–7}}</ref> Reiter's Syndrome is a common presentation of [[reactive arthritis]], a joint inflammation caused by intestinal bacterial infections or after acquiring certain sexually transmitted diseases (primarily [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] or [[gonorrhea]]). “It seems likely that [Columbus] acquired reactive arthritis from food poisoning on one of his ocean voyages because of poor sanitation and improper food preparation,” writes Dr. Frank C. Arnett, a [[rheumatology|rheumatologist]] and professor of internal medicine, pathology and laboratory medicine the University of Texas Medical School at Houston.<ref name=UMD>{{cite web|title=Christopher Columbus Suffered From a Fatal Form of Arthritis|url=http://umm.edu/news-and-events/news-releases/2005/christopher-columbus-suffered-from-a-fatal-form-of-arthritis|publisher=University of Maryland School of Medicine|accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref> <!-- AutoEd: rm unicode ctrl char w/no win-1252 mapping, intent unknown -->

On 20 May 1506, aged probably 54, Columbus died in [[Valladolid]], Spain.

Columbus' remains were first interred at Valladolid, then at the monastery of [[La Cartuja]] in [[Seville]] (southern Spain) by the will of his son [[Diego Colón|Diego]], who had been governor of [[Hispaniola]]. In 1542 the remains were transferred to [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Colonial Santo Domingo]], in the present-day [[Dominican Republic]]. In 1795, when France took over the entire island of [[Hispaniola]], Columbus' remains were moved to [[Havana]], Cuba. After Cuba became independent following the [[Spanish-American War]] in 1898, the remains were moved back to Spain, to the [[Cathedral of Seville]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12368307610158273876213/p0000001.htm|title=''Cristóbal Colón: traslación de sus restos mortales a la ciudad de Sevilla'' at Fundación Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes|publisher=Cervantesvirtual.com|accessdate=29 July 2009}}</ref> where they were placed on an elaborate [[catafalque]].

However, a lead box bearing an inscription identifying "Don Christopher Columbus" and containing bone fragments and a bullet was discovered at [[Santo Domingo]] in 1877.

To lay to rest claims that the wrong relics had been moved to Havana and that Columbus' remains had been left buried in the cathedral at [[Santo Domingo]], [[DNA]] samples of the corpse resting in [[Seville]] were taken in June 2003 (''History Today'' August 2003) as well as other DNA samples from the remains of his brother Diego and younger son [[Ferdinand Columbus|Fernando Colón]].

== Commemoration ==
[[File:Columbus 1892 Issue-$5.jpg|thumb|<center>~ Christopher Columbus ~</center><center>U.S. [[Columbian Issue]] of 1893.</center>]]
The anniversary of Columbus' 1492 landing in the Americas is usually observed as [[Columbus Day]] on 12 October in Spain and throughout the Americas, except Canada. In the United States it is observed annually on the second Monday in October.

The [[World Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, 1893, commemorated the 400th anniversary of the landing of Christopher Columbus in the Americas.<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11369/ |title = Bird's-Eye View of the World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893 |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1893 |accessdate = 2013-07-17 }}</ref> Over 27 million people attended the exposition during its six-month duration.

The [[U.S. Postal Service]] participated in the celebration issuing the first US [[Commemorative stamp|''commemorative postage stamps]], a series of 16 postage issues called the [[Columbian Issue]] depicting Columbus, Queen Isabella and others in the various stages of his several voyages. The issues range in value from the 1-cent to the 5-dollar denominations. Under Benjamin Harrison and his Postmaster General [[John Wanamaker]] the Columbian commemorative stamps were made available and were first issued at the [[World Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, Illinois, in 1893. Wanamaker originally introduced the idea of issuing the nation's first commemorative stamp to Harrison, the Congress and the U.S. Post Office. To demonstrate his confidence in the new Columbian commemorative issues Wanamaker purchased $10,000 worth of stamps with his own money. The Columbian Exposition lasted several months and, and over $40&nbsp;million in commemorative postage stamp had been sold.<ref name="JOHN WANAMAKER PMG">{{cite web |url=http://www.usps.com/postalhistory/_rtf/PMGWanamaker.rtf. |publisher=United States Postal Service |title=JOHN WANAMAKER, Postmaster General |accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref> The 400th anniversary Columbian issues were very popular in the United States; more than a billion of the two-cent editions were printed.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1982, a second Columbian issue was released that was identical to the first to commemorate the 500th anniversary. These issues were made from the original dies of which the first engraved issues of 1893 were produced. In 1992 along with the United States, Spain also issued an almost identical series of Columbian issues, (using 'Spain' instead of 'United States of America') celebrating the 500th anniversary of the voyages.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Though Christopher Columbus was long considered to be the "discoverer of America" in popular culture, his true historical legacy is more nuanced. America was first discovered by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|its indigenous population]], and Columbus was not even the first European to reach its shores as he was preceded by the [[Vikings]] at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]]. But the lasting significance of Columbus' voyages outshone that of his Viking predecessors because he managed to bring word of the continent back to Europe. By bringing the continent to the forefront of Western attention, Columbus initiated the enduring relationship between the [[Earth|Earth's]] two major landmasses and their inhabitants. "Columbus' claim to fame isn't that he got there first," explains historian Martin Dugard, "it's that he stayed."<ref name=dugard>Dugard, Martin. [[The Last Voyage of Columbus]]. Little, Brown and Company: New York, 2005.</ref>

The idea that he was the first person to envision a rounded earth is [[List of common misconceptions|popular misconception]]. The [[Spherical Earth|rounded shape of the earth]] had been known to scholars since [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], and was common knowledge among sailors.

[[File:1893 Nina Pinta Santa Maria replicas.jpg|thumb|Replicas of ''Niña'', ''Pinta'' and ''Santa Maria'' sailed from Spain to the [[Chicago Columbian Exposition]].]]
The scholar [[Amerigo Vespucci]], who sailed to America in the years following Columbus' first voyage, was the first to speculate that the land was not part of Asia but in fact constituted some wholly new continent previously unknown to Eurasians. His travel journals, published 1502–4, convinced [[Martin Waldseemüller]] to reach the same conclusion, and in 1507—a year after Columbus' death—Waldseemüller published a world map [[America (name)|calling the new continent]] ''America'' from Vespucci's Latinized name "Americus". According to Paul Lunde, "The preoccupation of European courts with the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the East partly explains their relative lack of interest in Columbus' discoveries in the West."<ref>"[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199203/piri.reis.and.the.columbus.map.htm Piri Reis and the Columbus Map]".

Historically, the British had downplayed Columbus and emphasized the role of the Venetian [[John Cabot]] as a pioneer explorer, but for the emerging United States, Cabot made for a poor national hero. Veneration of Columbus in America dates back to colonial times. The name [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] for "America" first appeared in a 1738 weekly publication of the debates of the British Parliament.<ref>[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&seq=5&size=1&id=gm.1738.6.x.8.x.x.285a ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', Vol. 8, June 1738, p. 285].</ref> The use of Columbus as a founding figure of New World nations and the use of the word "Columbia", or simply the name "Columbus", spread rapidly after the American Revolution. Columbus' name was given to the federal capital of the United States ([[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]), the [[capital city|capital cities]] of two U.S. [[State (United States)|states]] ([[Ohio]] and [[South Carolina]]), and the [[Columbia River]]. Outside the United States the name was used in 1819 for the [[Gran Colombia]], a precursor of the modern [[Republic of Colombia]]. Numerous cities, towns, counties, streets, and plazas (called Plaza Colón or Plaza de Colón throughout Latin America and Spain) have been named after him. A candidate for sainthood in the Catholic Church in 1866, celebration of Columbus' legacy perhaps reached a zenith in 1892 with the 400th anniversary of his first arrival in the Americas. Monuments to Columbus like the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago and [[Columbus Circle]] in New York City were erected throughout the United States and [[Latin America]] extolling him.

Sometime between 1531 and 1536, [[Alejo Fernández]] painted an altarpiece, ''[[The Virgin of the Navigators]]'', that includes a depiction of Columbus. The painting was commissioned for a chapel in Seville's [[Casa de Contratación]] (House of Trade) and remains there to this day, as the earliest known painting about the discovery of the Americas.<ref>John Noble, Susan Forsyth, Vesna Maric, Paula Hardy.

The most iconic image of Columbus is a portrait by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]], which has been reproduced in many textbooks. It agrees with descriptions of Columbus in that it shows a large man with auburn hair, but the painting dates from 1519 and cannot, therefore, have been painted from life. Furthermore, the inscription identifying the subject as Columbus was probably added later, and the face shown differs from other images, including that of the "Virgin of the Navigators."<ref name="Met-Piombo">[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110002098 "Portrait of a Man, Said to be Christopher Columbus"], Metropolitan Museum of Art</ref>
