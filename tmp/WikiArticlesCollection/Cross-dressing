{{Crossdressing}}

'''Cross-dressing''' refers to the act of wearing [[Clothes|clothing]] and other accoutrements commonly associated with the opposite [[gender role|sex]] within a particular [[society]].<ref>"cross-dress." ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition.'' Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004.</ref> Cross-dressing has been used for purposes of [[disguise]], comfort, and as a [[Trope (literature)|literary trope]] in modern times and throughout history. It does not, however, necessarily indicate [[transgender]] [[gender identity|identity]].

Nearly every human society throughout history has expected distinctions to be made between males and females by the style, color, or type of clothing they are expected to wear, and likewise most societies have had a set of [[Social aspects of clothing|social norms, views, guidelines, or even laws]] defining what type of clothing is appropriate for each gender. 

The term "cross-dressing" denotes an action or a behavior without attributing or implying any specific causes for that behavior. Some people automatically connect cross-dressing behavior to transgender identity or [[Human sexuality|sexual]], [[Sexual fetishism|fetishist]], and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] behavior, but the term  itself does not imply any motives.

==History==

Cross-dressing has been practiced throughout much of recorded history and in many societies. There are many examples in [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Norse mythology|Norse]], and [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] mythology. A reasonable number of historical figures are known to have cross-dressed to varying degrees and for a variety of reasons. There is a rich history of cross-dressing found in folklore, literature, theater, and music.

==Varieties==
There are many different kinds of cross-dressing and many different reasons why an individual might engage in cross-dressing behavior.<ref name = "eucwqo">''Rainbow Reader'', Fort Wayne, Indiana</ref> Some people cross-dress as a matter of comfort or style, out of personal preference for clothing associated with the opposite sex. In this case, a person's cross-dressing may or may not be apparent to other people. Some people cross-dress to shock others or challenge [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]].

'''Gender disguise''' has been used by women and girls to [[Passing (gender)|pass]] as [[male]] in society and by men and boys to pass themselves off as [[female]]. Gender disguise has also been used as a [[plot device]] in storytelling and is a recurring motif in literature, theater, and film. It is a common plot device in narrative [[ballads]].<ref name="child106">

</ref>  Historically, some women have cross-dressed to take up male-dominated or male-exclusive professions, such as military service. Conversely, some men have cross-dressed to escape from mandatory military service<ref>See the television series ''M.A.S.H.'' for an example of a cross-dresser who didn't want to be in the military (Klinger); although, the character was played for laughs, this is based on military regulations prohibiting cross-dressers.</ref> or as a disguise to assist in political or social protest, as men did in the [[Rebecca Riots]].

Single-sex theatrical troupes often have some performers who cross-dress to play roles written for members of the opposite sex ([[Travesti (theatre)|travesti]]). Cross-dressing, particularly the depiction of males wearing [[dress]]es, is often used for comic effect onstage and onscreen.

'''[[drag (clothing)|Drag]]''' is a special form of performance art based on the act of cross-dressing. A '''[[drag queen]]''' is usually a male-bodied person who performs as an exaggeratedly feminine character, in heightened costuming sometimes consisting of a showy dress, high-heeled shoes, obvious makeup, and [[Wig (hair)|wig]]. A drag queen may imitate famous female film or pop-music stars. A [[faux queen]] is a female-bodied person employing the same techniques.

A '''[[drag king]]''' is a counterpart of the drag queen but usually for much different audiences. A female-bodied person who adopt a masculine persona in performance or imitates a male film or pop-music star. Some female-bodied people undergoing [[gender reassignment therapy]] also self-identify as ''drag kings'' although this use of "drag king" would generally be considered inaccurate.
[[File:Lady Bunny and Sherry Vine by David Shankbone.JPG|thumb|left|[[Drag queen]]s are a form of cross-dressing as [[performance art]]]]

A [[transvestic fetishism|transvestic fetishist]] is a person (typically a [[heterosexual]] male) who cross-dresses as part of a [[sexual fetish]].

The term ''underdressing'' is used by male cross-dressers to describe wearing female undergarments under their male clothes. The famous low-budget filmmaker [[Edward D. Wood, Jr.]] said he often wore women's underwear under his military uniform during World War II.

Some people who cross-dress may endeavor to project a complete impression of belonging to another gender, down to mannerisms, [[Speech communication|speech]] patterns, and emulation of [[Sex-determination system|sexual characteristics]]. This is referred to as [[Passing (gender)|passing]] or "trying to pass" depending how successful the person is. An observer who sees through the cross-dresser's attempt to pass is said to have ''read'' or ''clocked'' them. There are videos, books, and magazines on how a man may look more like a woman.<ref>''Transformation'' magazine; interviews for ''Rainbow Reader'', Fort Wayne, Indiana</ref>

''Female masking'' is a form of cross-dressing in which men wear [[mask]]s that present them as female.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://vicestyle.com/en/news/today/post/female-masking | title=Female Masking | publisher=Vice Style|author=Jamie Clifton|date=August 30, 2011 | accessdate=2012-02-07 }}</ref>

Sometimes either member of a heterosexual couple will crossdress in order to arouse the other. For example, the male might wear skirts or lingerie and/or the female will wear boxers or other male clothing. (See also [[forced feminization]])

Others may choose to take a mixed approach, adopting some feminine traits and some masculine traits in their appearance. For instance, a man might wear both a [[dress]] and a [[beard]]. This is sometimes known as ''[[genderfuck]]''.

===Practical reasons===
Utilitarian purposes also bring about forms of crossdressing, such as:
* Support hose for men with bad circulation in their legs.
* Wearing bras for men with [[gynecomastia]] (male breasts).
* Male [[scuba divers]] wearing women's [[tights]] under their [[wetsuit]]s for a bit of extra warmth when diving in cold water.

==Clothes==

The actual determination of cross-dressing is largely [[socially constructed]]. For example, in Western society, trousers have been adopted for wear by women, and it is not regarded as cross-dressing. In cultures where men have traditionally worn [[Men's skirts|skirt-like garments]] such as the [[kilt]] or [[sarong]] these are not seen as female clothing, and wearing them is not seen as cross-dressing for men. As societies are becoming more global in nature, both [http://tonic-clothing.com/product-tag/mens/ men clothing] and [http://tonic-clothing.com/product-tag/womens/ women clothing] are adopting styles of dress associated with other cultures.

It was once considered [[taboo]] in Western society for women to wear clothing traditionally associated with men, except in certain circumstances such as cases of necessity (as per [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]'s guidelines in ''Summa Theologiae II''),<ref>{{cite web |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |title=Summa Theologiae Part II |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3.htm |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=28 August 2012.}}/ref> or in the case of the "holy transvestites" (cross-dressing female saints), of which there were many. The limiting guidelines on acceptability seemed to focus on ''passing''; the taboo was most strongly focused on the blending of genders. ref>Schibanoff, Susan. "Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc", ''Transvestism and Idolatry'', p39 ref> Cross dressing is somewhat cited as an "abomination" in the Bible in the book of [[Deuteronomy]] (22:5), although even in the Middle Ages, its applicability was occasionally disputed and still is.

The 15th-century French poet [[Martin le Franc]], concerning [[Joan of Arc]]:
:Don't you see that it was forbidden
:That anyone should eat of an animal
:Unless it had a cleft foot
:And chewed its cud?
:To eat of a hare no one dared
:Neither of sow nor of piglet,
:Yet should you now be offered any,
:You would take many a morsel. ref>Merkle, Gertrude H. "Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc", ''Martin Le Franc's Commentary on Jean Gerson's Treatise on Joan of Arc'', p182</ref>

While this prohibition remained in force in general throughout the middle and early modern ages, this is no longer the case and Western women are often seen wearing trousers, ties, and men's hats. Nevertheless, many cultures around the world still prohibit women from wearing trousers or other traditionally male clothing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

[[Cosplaying]] may also involve cross-dressing, for some females may wish to dress as a male, and vice versa (see [[Crossplay]]). Breast binding (for females) is not uncommon and is most likely needed to cosplay a male character.

In most parts of the world it remains socially frowned upon for men to wear clothes traditionally associated with women. Attempts are occasionally made, e.g. by fashion designers, to promote the acceptance of [[male skirt|skirts]] as everyday wear for men. Cross-dressers have complained that society permits women to wear pants or jeans and other masculine clothing, while condemning any man who wants to wear clothing sold for women.

While creating a more feminine figure, male cross-dressers will often utilize different types and styles of breast forms, which are silicone prostheses traditionally used by women who have undergone mastectomies to recreate the visual appearance of a breast.

While most male cross-dressers utilize clothing associated with modern women, there are some who are involved in subcultures that involve dressing as little girls or in [[vintage clothing]]. Some such men have written that they enjoy dressing as feminine as possible, so they will wear frilly dresses with lace and ribbons, [[bridal gown]]s complete with veils, as well as multiple [[petticoat]]s, [[corset]]s, [[girdle]]s and/or [[garter belt]]s with [[nylon stockings]].<ref>[http://www.pettipond.com pettipond.com]</ref>

==Social issues==
[[File:Hijra.jpg|right|190px|thumb|An Indian [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]]]]
Cross-dressers may begin wearing clothing associated with the opposite sex as children, using the clothes of a sibling, parent, or friend. Some parents have said they allowed their children to cross-dress and, in many cases, the child stopped when they became older. The same pattern often continues into adulthood, where there may be confrontations with a spouse. Married cross-dressers experience considerable anxiety and guilt if their spouse objects to their behavior. Most cross-dressers have periodically disposed of all their clothing, a practice called "purging", only to start collecting other gender's clothing again. .<ref name = "eucwqo"/>

==Analyses==
The historical associations of maleness with power and femaleness with submission and frivolity mean that in the present time a woman dressing in men's clothing and a man dressing in women's clothing evoke very different responses. A woman dressing in men's clothing is considered to be a  more acceptable activity.
Feminist advocacy for social change has done much to relax the constrictions of gender roles on men and women, but they are still heavily policed.<ref>Butler, Judith, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, Routledge, New York, 2008</ref><ref>Halberstam, Judith, Female Masculinity, Duke University Press, Durham and London, 1998</ref><ref>Epstein, Julia, Straub, Kristina; Eds, Body Guards: The Cultural Politics of Gender Ambiguity, Routledge, London, 1991</ref>
The reason it is so hard to have statistics for female-bodied crossdressers is that the line where non-crossdressing stops and crossdressing begins has become blurred, whereas the same line for men is just as defined. This is one of the many issues being addressed by third wave feminism as well as the modern-day [[masculism|masculist]] movement.

Culture can be very skewed about cross-dressing. A woman who wears her husband's shirt to bed is considered attractive while a man who wears his wife's nightgown to bed is considered transgressive.  Marlene Dietrich in a tuxedo was considered very erotic; Jack Lemmon in a dress was considered ridiculous.<ref>Blechner, M. J. (2009) ''Sex Changes: Transformations in Society and Psychoanalysis.''  New York: Routledge.</ref> All this may result from an overall gender role rigidity for males; that is, because of the prevalent gender dynamic throughout the world, men frequently encounter discrimination when deviating from masculine gender norms, particularly violations of [[heteronormativity]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/scmsAdmin/media/users/lec321/Sirin_Articles/Sirin_McCriery__Mahalik_2004.pdf |title=Differential Reactions to Men and Women's Gender Role Transgressions: Perceptions of Social Status, Sexual Orientation, and Value Dissimilarity |publisher=NYU |format=PDF |accessdate=1 June 2013 }}</ref> A man's adoption of feminine clothing is often considered a going down in the gendered social order whereas a woman's adoption of what are traditionally men's clothing (at least in the English-speaking world) has less of an impact because women have been traditionally subordinate to men, unable to affect serious change through style of dress. Thus when a male cross-dresser puts on his clothes, he transforms into the quasi-female and thereby becomes an intolerable embodiment of the conflicted gender dynamic. Following the work of [[Judith Butler|Butler]], gender proceeds along through ritualized performances, but in male cross-dressing it becomes a performative "breaking" of the masculine and a "subversive repetition" of the feminine.<ref name=Butler>{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Performative Acts and Gender Construction: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|url=http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/PoMoSeminar/Readings/BtlrPerfActs.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref>

Some psychoanalysts today do not regard cross-dressing by itself a psychological problem, unless it interferes with the functioning of a person's life. "For instance," said Dr. [[Joseph Merlino (doctor)|Joseph Merlino]], Senior Editor of the book ''Freud at 150: 21st Century Essays on a Man of Genius'', "[suppose that]...I'm a cross-dresser and I don't want to keep it confined to my circle of friends, or my party circle, and I want to take that to my wife and I don't understand why she doesn't accept it, or I take it to my office and I don't understand why they don't accept it, then it's become a problem because it's interfering with my relationships and environment."<ref>[[n:Dr. Joseph Merlino on sexuality, insanity, Freud, fetishes and apathy#Gender identity and Heteronormativity|Interview with Dr. Joseph Merlino]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', October 5, 2007.</ref>
