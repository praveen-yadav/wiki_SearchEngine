The '''Civilian Conservation Corps'''  ('''CCC''') was a public [[work relief program]] that operated from 1933 to 1942 in the United States for unemployed, unmarried men from relief families, ages 18–25 as part of Roosevelts New Deal. Robert Fechner was the head of the agency. A part of the [[New Deal]] of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who provided unskilled manual labor jobs related to the conservation and development of [[natural resources]] in rural lands owned by federal, state and local governments. The CCC was designed to provide jobs for young men, to  relieve families who had difficulty finding jobs during the [[Great Depression in the United States]] while at the same time implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory. Maximum enrollment at any one time was 300,000; in nine years 3 million young men participated in the CCC, which provided them with shelter, clothing, and food, together with a small wage of $30 a month ($25 of which had to be sent home to their families).<ref>Mastering Modern World History by Norman Lowe, second edition, p. 117</ref>

The American public made the CCC the most popular of all the New Deal programs.<ref>Perry H. Merrill, ''Roosevelt's Forest Army, A History of the Civilian Conservation Corps'' (1981) p. 196</ref> Principal benefits of an individual's enrollment in the CCC included improved physical condition, heightened morale, and increased employability. Of their pay of $30 a month, $25 went to their parents.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771421,00.html "Conservation: Poor Young Men, ''Time'' Feb. 6, 1939 online]</ref>  Implicitly, the CCC also led to a greater public awareness and appreciation of the outdoors and the nation's natural resources; and the continued need for a carefully planned, comprehensive national program for the protection and development of natural resources.<ref>Robert Allen Ermentrout, "Forgotten Men: The Civilian Conservation Corps," (1982) p. 99</ref> 

During the time of the CCC, volunteers planted nearly 3 billion trees to help reforest America, constructed more than 800 parks nationwide and upgraded most state parks, updated forest fire fighting methods, and built a network of service buildings and public roadways in remote areas.<ref>[http://www.ccclegacy.org/ccc_legacy.htm CCC Legacy Web site April 7, 2010]</ref>

Despite its popular support, the CCC was never a permanent agency. It depended on emergency and temporary Congressional legislation for its existence. By 1942, with World War II and [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]] in operation,  need for work relief declined and Congress voted to close the program.<ref>Wirth, pp. 105, 142-144</ref>

==Founding==
As governor of New York, Roosevelt had run a similar program on a small scale. Long interested in conservation,<ref>John A. Salmond, ''The Civilian Conservation Corps 1933–1942: a New Deal case study.'' (1967), ch. 1 [http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/ccc/salmond/chap1.htm online edition]</ref> now, as president, he proposed to Congress a much larger national program on 21 March 1933:<ref>"Message to Congress on Unemployment Relief. March 21," ''The Presidential Papers of Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933'' (1938)</ref>
{{quote|I propose to create [the CCC] to be used in simple work, not interfering with normal employment, and confining itself to forestry, the prevention of soil erosion, flood control and similar projects. I call your attention to the fact that this type of work is of definite, practical value, not only through the prevention of great present financial loss, but also as a means of creating future national wealth.}}
He promised this law would provide 250,000 young men with meals, housing, uniforms, and medical care for working in the national forests and other government properties. The Emergency Conservation Work (ECW) Act was introduced to Congress the same day and enacted by voice vote on 31 March. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6101 on 5 April 1933 which established the CCC organization and appointed a director, [[Robert Fechner]], a former labor union official who served until 1939. The organization and administration of the CCC was a new experiment in operations for a federal government agency. The order indicated that the program was to be supervised jointly by four government departments: [[United States Department of Labor|Labor]], which recruited the young men, [[United States Department of War|War]], which operated the camps, [[United States Department of Agriculture|Agriculture]] and [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior]], which organized and supervised the work projects. A CCC Advisory Council was composed of a representative from each of the supervising departments. In addition, the [[Office of Education]] and [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] participated in the program. To end the opposition from labor unions (which wanted no training programs started when so many of their men were unemployed)<ref>Neil M. Maher, ''Nature's New Deal: The Civilian Conservation Corps and the Roots of the American Environmental Movement'' (2009), p. 79</ref> Roosevelt chose Robert Fechner, vice president of the American Machinists Union, as director of the corps. [[William Green (labor leader)|William Green]], head of the [[American Federation of Labor]], was taken to the first camp to demonstrate that there would be no job training involved beyond simple manual labor.<ref>On the formation see Frank Freidel, ''Franklin D. Roosevelt: Launching the New Deal'' (1973), pp. 255-266</ref>

==US Army==
Reserve officers from the U.S. Army were in charge of the camps, but there was no military training. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] was placed in charge of the program<ref>Darby, Jean
Douglas. [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]], Twenty-First Century Books, 1989, p. 47</ref> but stated that the number of Army officers and soldiers assigned to the camps was affecting the readiness of the Regular Army.<ref>Imparato, Edward T., editor ''Effect of the Civilian Conservation Corps Project upon Army Activity and Readiness for Emergency'' ''General MacArthur Speeches and Reports 1908–1964''  Turner Publishing Company, 2000, p. 58</ref>

==Early Years, 1933–1934==
The legislation and mobilization of the program occurred quite rapidly. Roosevelt made his request to Congress on March 21, 1933; the legislation was submitted to Congress the same day; Congress passed it by voice vote on 31 March; Roosevelt signed it the same day, then issued an executive order on April 5 creating the agency, appointing its director (Fechner), and assigning War Department corps area commanders the task to commence enrollment. The first CCC [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/enroll enrollee] was selected 8 April and subsequent lists of unemployed men were supplied by state and local welfare and relief agencies for immediate enrollment. On 17 April the first camp, [[NF-1, Camp Roosevelt]],<ref>[http://www.ccclegacy.org/camp_roosevelt_history.htm ]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref> was established at [[George Washington National Forest]] near Luray, Virginia. On 18 June, the first of 161 soil erosion control camps was opened, in Clayton, Alabama.<ref>{{cite web|title=Timeline. Surviving the Dust Bowl. American Experience . WGBH - PBS|accessdate=2012-03-02|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/timeline/dustbowl/}}</ref> By 1 July 1933 there were 1,463 working camps with 250,000 junior enrollees (18–25 years of age), 28,000 [[veterans]], 14,000 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]], and 25,000 Locally Enrolled (or Experienced) Men (LEM).<ref>Ermentrout, p. 15</ref><ref name="Fechner">{{cite book|last=Fechner|first=Robert, Director|authorlink=Robert Fechner|title=Pamphlet: Objectives and Results of the Civilian Conservation Corps Program|publisher=Civilian Conservation Corps|year=1938|location=Washington, D.C}}</ref>

===Enrollees===
The typical CCC enrollee was a U.S. citizen, unmarried, unemployed male, 18–25 years of age. Normally his family was on local relief. Each enrollee volunteered and, upon passing a physical exam and/or a period of conditioning, was required to serve a minimum six-month period with the option to serve as many as four periods, or up to two years if employment outside the Corps was not possible. Enrollees worked 40 hours a week over five days, sometimes including Saturdays if poor weather dictated. In return they received $30 a month with a compulsory allotment $22–25 sent to a family dependent, as well as food, clothing and medical care.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wirth|first=Conrad L.|year=1980|title=Parks, Politics and the People|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|pages=94–99|isbn=0-8061-1605-6}}</ref> Following the second [[Bonus Army]] march on Washington D.C., President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6129 (11 May 1933) to amend the CCC program, to include work opportunities for veterans. Veteran qualifications differed from the junior enrollee; one needed to be certified by the Veterans Administration by application, they could be any age, and married or single as long as they were in need of work. Veterans were mostly assigned to entire veteran camps.<ref name="Ermentrout2">{{cite book|last=Ermentrout|first=Robert Allen|title=Forgotten Men: The Civilian Conservation Corps|year=1982|location=Smithtown, NY|publisher=Exposition Press|page=17|isbn=0-682-49805-X}}</ref> Enrollees were eligible for "rated" positions to help with camp administration: senior leader, mess steward, store keeper and two cooks; assistant leader, company clerk, assistant educational advisor and three second cooks. These men received additional pay ranging from $36 to $45 per month depending on their rating.

===Camps===
Each CCC camp was located in the area of particular conservation work to be performed, and organized around a complement of up to 200 civilian enrollees in a designated numbered "company" unit. The CCC camp was a temporary community in itself, structured to have barracks (initially Army tents) for 50 enrollees each, officer/technical staff quarters, medical dispensary, mess hall, recreation hall, educational building, lavatory and showers, technical/administrative offices, tool room/blacksmith shop and motor pool garages. The company organization of each camp had a dual-authority supervisory staff: firstly, Department of War personnel or [[Reserve components of the United States armed forces|Reserve]] officers (until 1 July 1939), a "company commander" and junior officer, who were responsible for overall camp operation, logistics, education and training; and secondly, ten to fourteen technical service civilians, including a camp "superintendent" and "foreman," employed by either the Departments of Interior or Agriculture, responsible for the particular field work. Also included in camp operation were several non-technical supervisor LEMs, who provided knowledge of the work at hand, "lay of the land" and paternal guidance for inexperienced enrollees.<ref>"Your CCC, A Handbook for Enrollees" Happy Days Pub. Co., Inc. (1940) pp. 8–13</ref><ref>Ermentrout, pp. 16, 76-77</ref> Enrollees were organized into work detail units called "sections" of 25 men each, according to the barracks they resided in.<ref>"United States Army Civilian Conservation Corps. Company 114th," Francis P. Waversak, Stone Walls, Spring 1990 p. 23</ref> Each section had an enrollee [[leadership|"senior leader"]] and "assistant leader" who were accountable for the men at work and in the barracks.

===Work classifications===
The CCC performed 300 possible types of work projects within ten approved general classifications:
#Structural improvements: bridges, [[fire lookout tower]]s, service buildings
#Transportation: truck trails, minor roads, [[hiking trail|foot trails]] and airport landing fields
#[[Erosion control]]: check dams, terracing and vegetable covering
#[[Flood control]]: irrigation, drainage, dams, ditching, channel work, [[rip rap|riprapping]]
#[[Forestry|Forest culture]]: planting trees and shrubs, timber stand improvement, seed collection, nursery work
#[[Forest protection]]: [[Wildfire|fire]] prevention, fire pre-suppression, firefighting, [[pest control|insect and disease control]]
#[[Landscape architecture|Landscape]] and [[recreation]]: public camp and picnic ground development, lake and pond site clearing and development
#[[Rangeland|Range]]: stock driveways, elimination of predatory animals
#[[Wildlife]]: stream improvement, [[fish stocking]], food and cover planting
#Miscellaneous: [[emergency service|emergency work]], [[surveying|surveys]], [[mosquito]] control<ref>Merrill, Perry H. (1981) ''Roosevelt's Forest Army, A History of the Civilian Conservation Corps'', p. 9</ref>

The responses to this six-month experimental conservation program were enthusiastic, and on 1 October 1933 Director Fechner was instructed to arrange for a second period of enrollment. By January 1934, 300,000 men were enrolled. In July 1934 this cap was increased by 50,000 to include men from midwest states that had been affected by [[drought]]. The temporary tent camps had also transitioned from tents to wooden barracks. An education program had been established emphasizing job training and [[literacy]].<ref name="Fechner">, p. 10</ref>

Approximately 55% of enrollees were from rural communities, a majority of which were non-farm; 45% came from urban areas.<ref>"Your CCC, A Handbook for Enrollees", Happy Days Pub. Co., Inc. (1940) p. 9</ref> Level of education for the enrollee averaged 3% illiterate, 38% less than eight years of school, 48% did not complete high school, 11% were high school graduates.<ref name="Ermentrout2"/> At the time of entry, 70% of enrollees were malnourished and poorly clothed. Few had work experience beyond occasional odd jobs. Peace was maintained by the threat of "dishonorable discharge". "This is a training station; we're going to leave morally and physically fit to lick 'Old Man Depression,'" boasted the [[newsletter]], ''Happy Days'', of a [[North Carolina]] camp.

===Minorities===
The total of 200,000 African-American enrollees were [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] after 1935 but received equal pay and housing. Black leaders lobbied to secure leadership roles.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Calvin W.|last=Gower|title=The Struggle of Blacks for Leadership Positions in the Civilian Conservation Corps: 1933–1942|journal=Journal of Negro History|volume=61|issue=2|year=1976|pages=123–135|jstor=2717266}}</ref> Secretary of the Interior [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]] pressured Director [[Robert Fechner]] to appoint prominent African-Americans to supervisory positions such as education directors in the 143 segregated camps.

The separate Indian Division was a major relief force for Native Americans.  No women were ever enrolled.

===Indian Division===
The CCC operated an entirely separate division for members of federally recognized tribes: the Indian Emergency Conservation Work, IECW, or CCC-ID. Native men from reservations worked on roads, bridges, clinics, shelters, and other public works near their reservations. Although classified as camps there were no actual permanent camps; instead, organized groups moved with their family from project to project, for which a rental allowance was issued in their pay.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Calvin W.|last=Gower|title=The CCC Indian Division: Aid for Depressed Americans, 1933–1942|journal=Minnesota History|year=1972|volume=43|issue=1|pages=3–13}}</ref> The CCC often provided the only paid work in remote reservations. Enrollees had to be between the ages of 17 and 35. For example, during 1933 about half the male heads of households on the [[Sioux]] reservations in [[South Dakota]] were employed by the CCC-ID.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Roger|last=Bromert|title=The Sioux and the Indian-CCC|journal=South Dakota History|year=1978|volume=8|issue=4|pages=340–356}}</ref> With grants from the [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA), the Indian Division built schools and operated an extensive road-building program in and around many reservations. The mission was to reduce erosion and improve the value of Indian lands. Crews built dams of many types on creeks, then sowed grass on the eroded areas from which the damming materials had been taken. They built roads and planted shelter-belts on federal lands. The steady income created an improved sense of self-worth for participants who used the funds to improve their lifestyles. [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]] the federal [[Commissioner of Indian Affairs]] and Daniel Murphy, the director of the CCC-ID, both centered the basic goals of the program around Indian self-rule and the restoration of tribal lands, governments, and cultures. In Collier's words, "no previous undertaking in Indian Service has so largely been the Indians' own undertaking". Education programs also trained participants in gardening, stock raising, safety, native arts, and some academic subjects.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Carolyn G.|last=Hanneman|title=Baffles, Bridges, and Bermuda: Oklahoma Indians and the Civilian Conservation Corps-Indian Division|journal=Chronicles of Oklahoma|year=1999|volume=77|issue=4|pages=428–449}}</ref> IECW differed from other CCC activities in that it explicitly trained men to be carpenters, truck drivers, radio operators, mechanics, surveyors, and technicians. With the passage of the National Defense Vocational Training Act of 1941, enrollees began participating in defense oriented training. The classes were paid for by the government and after course completion and a passed competency test, automatic employment in the defense work was guaranteed. A total of 85,000 Native Americans were enrolled. This proved valuable human capital for the 24,000 alumni who later served in the military and the 40,000 who left the reservations for city jobs supporting the war effort.

===Program Expansion, 1935–1936===
Responding to favorable public opinion to alleviate unemployment, Congress approved the [[Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935]], on 8 April 1935, which included continued funding for the CCC program through 31 March 1937. The age limit was also expanded to 18-28 to include more men.<ref name="Fechner">, p. 11</ref><ref>[http://digilab.browardlibrary.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/ccc&CISOPTR=691&CISOSHOW=658 Roosevelt message to Congress, 21 March 1933]</ref> From 1 April 1935 to 31 March 1936 was the period of greatest activity and work accomplished by the CCC program. Enrollment had peaked at 505,782 in about 2,900 camps by 31 August 1935, followed by a reduction to 350,000 enrollees in 2,019 camps by 30 June 1936.<ref>Ermentrout, p. 33</ref> During this period the public response to the CCC program was overwhelmingly popular. A [[Gallup poll]] of 18 April 1936 asked "Are you in favor of the CCC camps?"; 82% of respondents said yes, including 92% of [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 67% of [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].<ref>''Public Opinion, 1935–1946'' ed. by Hadley Cantril and Mildred Strunk 1951. p. 111</ref>

===Change of Purpose, 1937–1938===
On 28 June 1937 the Civilian Conservation Corps was legally established, transferred from its original designation as the Emergency Conservation Work program. Funding was also extended for three more years by Public Law No. 163, [[75th Congress]], effective 1 July 1937. Congress changed the age limits to 17–23 years old, and changed the requirement that enrollees be on relief to ''"not regularly in attendance at school, or possessing full time employment."''<ref>Civilian Conservation Corps, "Standards of Eligibility and Selection for Junior Enrollees," United States Dept. of Labor, Office of the Secretary, 1 August 1938</ref> The 1937 law mandated the inclusion of vocational and academic training for a minimum of 10 hours per week. Another change allowed for those in school to be enrolled during (summer) vacation.<ref>Ermentrout, pp. 48–49, 51</ref> During this period, the CCC was called in to help with disaster relief following 1937 floods in New York, Vermont and the [[Ohio River flood of 1937|Ohio]] and Mississippi River Valleys, and response and clean-up after the [[New England Hurricane of 1938|1938 hurricane in New England]].

===Conservation to Defense, 1939–1940===
In 1939 Congress ended the independent status of the CCC and transferred control to the [[Federal Security Agency]], along with other agencies such as the [[National Youth Administration]], U.S. Employment Service, the Office of Education and the [[Works Progress Administration]]. About 5,000 Reserve officers for the camps were affected, transferred to Civil Service and military ranks and titles were eliminated. Despite this loss of an obvious military leadership in the camps by July 1940, with war in Europe and Asia, an increasing number of CCC projects focused on resources for national defense, developing infrastructure for military training facilities and forest protection. By 1940 the CCC was no longer wholly a relief agency, rapidly losing its non-military character, and becoming a system for work-training as its ranks had become increasingly younger, with life-inexperienced enrollees.<ref>Ermentrout, pp. 55, 62, 64</ref>

===Decline and Disbandment 1941–1942===
Although the CCC was probably the most popular New Deal program, it never became a permanent agency. The program had been reduced in operations as the Depression waned and employment opportunities improved. Fewer eligible young men were available after [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|conscription]] commenced in 1940. Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941 all federal programs were revised to emphasize the war effort. Most CCC work, except for wildland firefighting, was shifted onto U.S. military bases to help with construction. The CCC disbanded one year earlier than planned, as the [[77th United States Congress]] ceased funding, causing it to conclude operations formally at the end of the federal fiscal year on 30 June 1942. The end of the CCC program and closing of the camps involved arrangements to leave the incomplete work projects in the best possible state, the separation of about 1,800 appointed employees, the transfer of CCC property to the War and Navy Departments and other agencies, and the preparation of final accountability records. Liquidation of the CCC was ordered by Congress by the Labor-Federal Security Appropriation Act (56 Stat. 569) on 2 July 1942; and virtually completed on 30 June 1943.<ref>[[Conrad L. Wirth|Wirth, Conrad L.]], ''Civilian Conservation Corps Program of the US Dept. of the Interior, March 1933 to 30 June 1942'', a Report to [[Harold L. Ickes]], January 1944</ref> Liquidation appropriations for the CCC continued through 20 April 1948.

Some former CCC sites in good condition were reactivated from 1941 to 1947 as [[Civilian Public Service]] camps where [[conscientious objector]]s performed "work of national importance" as an alternative to military service. Other camps were used to hold [[Japanese American internment|Japanese American internees]] or German [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. After the CCC disbanded, the federal agencies responsible for administration of [[public lands]] organized their own seasonal fire crews, modeled after the CCC, which performed a firefighting function formerly done by the CCC and provided the same sort of outdoor work experience for young people. Approximately 47 young men died while in this line of duty.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==The CCC model==
{{refimprove|date=March 2012}}
The CCC program was never officially terminated. Congress provided funding for closing the remaining camps in 1942 with the equipment being reallocated.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/timeline/ccc/2/ The American Experience]</ref> It became a model for conservation programs that were implemented in the period after World War II. Present-day corps are national, state and local programs that engage primarily youth and young adults (ages 16–25) in community service, training and educational activities. The nation's approximate 113 corps programs operate in 41 states and the [[District of Columbia]]. During 2004, they enrolled more than 23,000 young people. The Corps Network, known originally as the [[National Association of Service and Conservation Corps]] (NASCC), works to expand and enhance corps-type programs throughout the country. The Corps Network began in 1985, when the nation's first 24 Corps directors banded together to secure an advocate at the federal level and a repository of information on how best to start and manage a corps. Early financial assistance from the [[Ford Foundation|Ford]], [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation|Hewlett]] and [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation|Mott Foundations]] was critical to establishing the association.

Another similar program is the [[National Civilian Community Corps]], part of the AmeriCorps program, a team-based national service program in which 18- to 24-year-olds spend 10 months working for non-profit and government organizations.

===Student Conservation Association===
The CCC program became a model for the creation of team-based national service youth conservation programs such as the [[Student Conservation Association]] (SCA). The SCA, founded in 1959, is a nonprofit organization that offers conservation internships and summer trail crew opportunities to more than 4,000 people each year. The SCA mission is to build a new generation of conservation managers by inspiring lifelong [[stewardship]] of the environment and communities by engaging high school and college-age volunteers in hands-on service to the land. SCA program is active nation-wide in the USA, including national and state parks, forests, wildlife refuges, seashores and historic sites. SCA National Headquarters is located in [[Charlestown, New Hampshire]] with regional offices across the country.

===Texas Conservation Corps===
Established in 1995, Environmental Corps, now Texas Conservation Corps (TxCC), is an American YouthWorks program which allows youth, ages 17 to 28, to contribute to the restoration and preservation of parks and public lands in Texas. The only conservation corps in Texas, TxcC is a 501(c)3 non profit corporation based in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Texas, which serves the entire state. Their work ranges from disaster relief to trail building to habitat restoration. TxCC has done projects in national, state, and city parks.

===California Conservation Corps===
In 1976, [[Governor of California]] [[Jerry Brown]] established the [[California Conservation Corps]]. This new program had many similar characteristics - residential centers, high expectations for participation, emphasis on hard work on public lands. Young adults from different backgrounds were recruited for a term of one-year. Corps members attended a training academy before being assigned to one of the centers. Life at CCC centers is rigorous, starting with early morning exercises, breakfast, roll call and a full day's work. After hours included education, life skills workshops, community meetings. Project work was also similar to the CCC of the 1930s - work on public forests, state and federal parks.
