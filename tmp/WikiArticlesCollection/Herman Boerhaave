'''Herman Boerhaave''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɦɛrmɑn ˈbuːrˌɦaːvə|lang}}, 31 December 1668 – 23 September 1738) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]]  botanist, [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[physician]] of European fame. He is regarded as the founder of clinical teaching and of the modern academic [[hospital]]. His main achievement was to demonstrate the relation of symptoms to lesions.  In addition, he was the first to isolate the chemical [[urea]] from [[urine]].<ref>{{Cite journal

From 1950 to 1970, Boerhaave's image was printed on Dutch 20-[[guilder]] banknotes. The [[Leiden University Medical Centre]] organises medical trainings called ''Boerhaave-courses''.

==Biography==
[[Image:Oud poelgeest trekvaart.JPG|thumbnail|left|200px|[[Oud Poelgeest]] Castle, Herman Boerhaave's home in [[Oegstgeest]], near Leiden. This was the site of his outdoor botanical garden that was renowned during his lifetime and rivaled [[Hortus Cliffortianus]], the garden of his friend and sponsor to [[Linnaeus]]. He travelled back and forth to his friend's garden and to the Leiden University by [[trekschuit]].]]
Boerhaave was born at [[Voorhout]] near [[Leiden]]. Entering the [[University of Leiden]] he took his degree in philosophy in 1689, with a dissertation ''De distinctione mentis a corpore'' (on the difference of the mind from the body), in which he attacked the doctrines of [[Epicurus]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]. He then turned to the study of medicine, in which he graduated in 1693 at [[University of Harderwijk|Harderwijk]] in present-day [[Gelderland]]. 

In 1701 he was appointed lecturer on the institutes of medicine at Leiden; in his inaugural discourse, ''De commendando [[Hippocrates|Hippocratis]] studio'', he recommended to his pupils that great physician as their model. In 1709 he became professor of [[botany]] and medicine, and in that capacity he did good service, not only to his own university, but also to botanical science, by his improvements and additions to the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|botanic garden of Leiden]], and by the publication of numerous works descriptive of new species of plants. 

On 14 September 1710, Boerhaave married Maria Drolenvaux, the daughter of the rich merchant, Alderman Abraham Drolenvaux. They had four children, of whom one daughter, Maria Joanna, lived to adulthood [http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2404.html]. In 1722, he began to suffer from an extreme case of [[gout]], recovering the next year.

In 1714, when he was appointed rector of the university, he succeeded [[Govert Bidloo]] in the chair of practical medicine, and in this capacity he introduced the modern system of clinical instruction. Four years later he was appointed to the chair of chemistry as well. In 1728 he was elected into the [[French Academy of Sciences]], and two years later into the [[Royal Society]] of London. In 1729 declining health obliged him to resign the chairs of chemistry and botany; and he died, after a lingering and painful illness, at Leiden.

==Legacy==
His reputation so increased the fame of the University of Leiden, especially as a school of medicine, that it became popular with visitors from every part of Europe. All the princes of Europe sent him pupils, who found in this skillful professor not only an indefatigable teacher, but an affectionate guardian. When [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] went to Holland in 1716 (he was in Holland before in 1697 to instruct himself in maritime affairs), he also took lessons from Boerhaave. [[Linnaeus]] traveled to see him, as did [[Voltaire]]. His reputation was not confined to Europe; a Chinese mandarin sent him a letter addressed to "the illustrious Boerhaave, physician in Europe," and it reached him in due course. The operating theatre of the University of Leiden in which he once worked as an anatomist is now at the center of a museum named after him; the [[Boerhaave Museum]]. The [[near-Earth object|near-Earth]] [[minor planet]] [[(8176) 1991 WA]] in the [[list of Apollo asteroids|Apollo group]] is nicknamed Booerhaave in his honor.
 
Boerhaave first described [[Boerhaave syndrome]], which involves tearing of the esophagus, usually a consequence of vigorous vomiting.  He notoriously described in 1724 the case of Baron Jan von Wassenaer, a Dutch admiral who died of this condition following a gluttonous feast and subsequent regurgitation.<ref>Boerhaave H. Atrocis, nec descripti prius, morbii historia: secundum medicae artis leges conscripta. Leiden, the Netherlands: Lugduni Batavorum Boutesteniana, 1724</ref>  This condition was uniformly fatal prior to modern surgical techniques allowing repair of the esophagus.

Boerhaave was critical of his [[Netherlands (terminology)#Dutch|Dutch]] contemporary, [[Baruch Spinoza]], attacking him in his dissertation in 1689.
