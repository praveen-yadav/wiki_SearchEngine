The '''''brit milah''''' ({{lang-he|בְּרִית מִילָה}} {{IPA-he|bʁit miˈla|}}, [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] pronunciation {{IPA-he|bʁis ˈmilə|}}, "covenant of circumcision"; [[Yiddish]] pronunciation,  '''bris''' {{IPA-yi|bʀɪs|}}) is a Jewish religious male [[Religious male circumcision#In_Judaism|circumcision ceremony]] performed on 8-day-old male infants by a [[mohel]]. The ''brit milah'' is followed by a celebratory meal (''[[seudat mitzvah]]'').

[[File:Isaac's circumcision, Regensburg c1300.jpg|thumb|left|240px|"Isaac's Circumcision", Regensburg Pentateuch, c1300]]
According to the [[Hebrew Bible]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|17:10-14|HE}})  [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] commanded the Biblical patriarch [[Abraham]] to be circumcised, an act to be followed by his descendants:
{{quote|10 This is My covenant, which ye shall keep, between Me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised. 11 And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt Me and you. 12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner, that is not of thy seed. 13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised; and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 14 And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken My covenant.}}

Also, {{bibleverse||Leviticus|12:3|HE}} provides: "And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised."

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], it was "a reproach" for an [[Israelite]] to be uncircumcised ([[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 5:9.)  The term ''arelim'' ("uncircumcised" [plural]) is used opprobriously, denoting the [[Philistines]] and other non-Israelites ([[Books of Samuel|I Samuel]] 14:6, 31:4; II Samuel 1:20) and used in conjunction with ''tameh'' (unpure) for heathen ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 52:1). The word ''arel'' ("uncircumcised" [singular]) is also employed for "impermeable" ([[Leviticus]] 26:41, "their uncircumcised hearts"; compare [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 9:25; [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 44:7,9); it is also applied to the first three years' fruit of a tree, which is forbidden ([[Leviticus]] 19:23).

However, the Israelites born in the wilderness after the [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt were not circumcised. [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 5:2-9, explains, "all the people that came out" of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] were circumcised, but those "born in the wilderness" were not. Therefore Joshua, before the celebration of the [[Passover]], had them circumcised at [[Gilgal]] specifically before they entered Canaan. Abraham, too, was circumcised when he moved into Canaan.

The prophetic tradition emphasizes that God expects people to be good as well as pious, and that non-Jews will be judged based on their ethical behavior, see [[Noahide Law]]. Thus, Jeremiah 9:25-26 says that circumcised and uncircumcised will be punished alike by the Lord; for "all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart."

The penalty of non-observance is ''[[kareth]]'' (spiritual excision from the Jewish nation), as noted in {{bibleverse||Genesis|17:1-14|HE}}. [[Conversion to Judaism]] for non-Israelites in Biblical times necessitated circumcision otherwise one could not partake in the [[Passover]] offering ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}). Today, as in the time of Abraham, it is required of converts in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] [[Judaism]]. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|34:14-16|HE}}).

As found in Genesis 17:1-14, ''brit milah'' is considered to be so important that should the eighth day fall on [[Shabbat|the Sabbath]], actions that would normally be forbidden because of the sanctity of the day are permitted in order to fulfill the requirement to circumcise. The [[Talmud]], when discussing the importance of Milah, compares it to being equal to all other mitzvot (commandments) based on the [[gematria]] for ''brit'' of 612 (Tractate [[Nedarim (tractate)|Nedarim]] 32a).

Covenants in ancient times were sometimes sealed by severing an animal, with the implication that the party who breaks the covenant will suffer a similar fate. In Hebrew, the verb meaning "to seal a covenant" translates literally as "to cut". It is presumed by Jewish scholars that the removal of the foreskin symbolically represents such a sealing of the covenant.<ref>"Circumcision." Mark Popovsky. Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion.

==Ceremony==
[[File:Circumcision set.jpg|thumb|right|Family circumcision set and trunk, ca. eighteenth century Wooden box covered in cow hide with silver implements: silver trays, clip, pointer, silver flask, spice vessel.]]

===Time and place===
It is customary for the brit to be held in a synagogue, but it can also be held at home or any other suitable location. The brit is performed on the eighth day from the baby's birth, taking into consideration that according to the Jewish calendar, the day begins at the sunset of the day before. If the baby is born on Sunday before sunset, the Brit will be held the following Sunday. However, if the baby is born on Sunday night after sunset, the Brit is on the following Monday. The brit takes place on the eighth day following birth even if that day is Shabbat or a holiday. A brit is traditionally performed in the morning, but it may be performed any time during daylight hours.

====Postponement for health reasons====
The Talmud explicitly instructs that a boy must not be circumcised if he had two brothers who died due to complications arising from their circumcisions;<ref name="JewEncMor">{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=Morbidity|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=763&letter=M}}</ref> this may be due to a concern about [[haemophilia]].<ref name="JewEncMor" /> An Israeli study found a high rate of urinary tract infections if the bandage is left on too long.<ref>{{cite web |first=Ofri |last=Ilani |title=Traditional circumcision raises risk of infection, study shows |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1043807.html |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2008-05-12 |accessdate=15 August 2009}}</ref> 

If the child is born [[premature baby|prematurely]] or has other serious medical problems, the brit milah will be postponed until the doctors and mohel deem the child strong enough.

====Anesthetic====
Most prominent ''[[acharonim]]'' rule that the ''[[mitzvah]]'' of brit milah lies in the pain it causes, and anesthetic, sedation, or ointment should generally not be used.<ref name="Rabbi Yaakov Montrose, 2011, pp. 29-32">Rabbi Yaakov Montrose. ''Halachic World - Volume 3: Contemporary [[Halakha|Halachic]] topics based on the [[Parshah]]''. "Lech Lecha - No Pain, No Bris?" Feldham Publishers 2011, pp. 29-32</ref> [[Eliezer Waldenberg]], [[Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg]], [[Shmuel Wosner]], [[Moshe Feinstein]] and others agree that the child should not be sedated, although pain relieving ointment may be used under certain conditions; [[Shmuel Wosner]] particularly asserts that the act ought to be painful, as per [[Psalms]] 44:23.<ref name="Rabbi Yaakov Montrose, 2011, pp. 29-32"/> Regarding an adult circumcision, pain is ideal, but not mandatory.

===Kvater===
The title of ''kvater'' (male) or ''kvaterin'' (female) among [[Ashkenazi Jews]] is for the person who carries the baby from the mother to the father, who in turn carries him to the ''[[mohel]].'' This honor is usually given to a couple without children, as a merit or ''[[Segula (Kabbalah)|segula]]'' (efficacious remedy) that they should have children of their own. The origin of the term may simply be "Gevatter", an archaic [[German language|German]] word for [[godparent|godfather]],<ref>[http://beritmila.org/Glossary.html ]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref> but it is also said to be a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] erroneous combination of the words ''kavod'' ("honor" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) and ''tor'' ("door" in Yiddish), meaning "The person honored by bringing the baby". Another source is a mix of [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]] meaning 'like the father'.

===Seudat mitzvah===
[[File:GerrerRebbe.JPG|thumb|left|100px|[[Yaakov Aryeh Alter]] as ''Sandek'']]
[[File:Chair of Elijah.JPG|thumb|right|100px|"Chair of Elijah" used during the brit milah ceremony]]
After the ceremony, a [[Seudat mitzvah|celebratory meal]] takes place. At the ''[[birkat hamazon]]'' additional introductory lines, known as ''Nodeh Leshimcha'', are added. These lines praise God and request the permission of God, the [[Torah]], [[Kohen|Kohanim]] and distinguished people present to proceed with the grace. When the four main blessings are concluded, special ''ha-Rachaman'' prayers are recited. They request various blessings by God that include:
#the parents of the baby, to help them raise him wisely;
#the ''[[sandek]]'';
#the baby boy to have strength and grow up to trust in God and perceive Him [[Three pilgrim festivals|three times a year]];
#the ''mohel'' for unhesitatingly performing the ritual;
#to send the [[Jewish Messiah]] speedily in the merit of this ''[[mitzvah]]'';
#to send [[Elijah (prophet)|Elijah]] the prophet, known as "The Righteous Kohen", so that God's covenant can be fulfilled with the re-establishment of the throne of King [[David]].

However, on ritual circumcisions performed by a mohel, the epithelium is most commonly peeled off only after the foreskin has been amputated. This procedure is called ''priah'' ({{lang-he|פריעה}}), which means: 'uncovering'.

According to Rabbinic interpretation of traditional Jewish sources,<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=SF6fbjNe0yYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=when+did+metzitzah+start#v=onepage&q=milah&f=false | title = Marked in Your Flesh: Circumcision from Ancient Judea to Modern America | isbn = 9780195176742 | author1 = Glick | first1 = Leonard B | date = 2005-06-30}}</ref> the 'priah' has been performed as part of the Jewish circumcision since the [[Israelites]] first inhabited the [[Land of Israel]].<ref>[[Talmud Bavli]] Tractate Yebamoth 71b: Rabbah b. Isaac stated in the name of Rab: The commandment of uncovering the corona at circumcision was not given to Abraham; for it is said, At that time the Lord said unto Joshua: 'Make thee knives of flint etc.' But is it not possible [that this applied to] those who were not previously circumcised; for it is written, For all the people that came out were circumcised, but all the people that were born etc.? — If so, why the expression. 'Again!' Consequently it must apply to the uncovering of the corona.</ref>
However, the ''Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'', argues that many Hellenistic Jews had an operation performed to conceal the fact of their circumcision, and that similar action was taken during the Hadrianic persecution, in which period a prohibition against circumcision was issued. Thus, hypothesize the editors, it was probably in order to prevent the possibility of obliterating the traces of circumcision that the rabbis added to the requirement of cutting the foreskin that of priah.<ref>Werblowsky, R.J. Zwi & Wigoder, Geoffrey (1997) The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion.

According to Shaye J. D.

D | date = 2005-09-06}}</ref> David Gollaher has written that the rabbis added the procedure of priah to discourage men from trying to restore their foreskins: ‘Once established, priah was deemed essential to circumcision; if the mohel failed to cut away enough tissue, the operation was deemed insufficient to comply with God's covenant’ and ‘Depending on the strictness of individual rabbis, boys (or men thought to have been inadequately cut) were subjected to additional operations.’<ref>{{Cite book | title =Circumcision: A History of The World’s Most Controversial Surgery | author= David Gollaher | publisher =Basic Books 2000 | pages =17}}</ref>

In addition to ''{{transl|he|milah}}'' (the actual circumcision) and ''{{transl|he|p'riah}}'', mentioned above, the [[Talmud]] ([[Mishnah]] Shabbat 19:2) mentions a third step, ''{{transl|he|metzitzah}}'', translated as suction, as one of the steps involved in the circumcision rite.

| quote = The mohel brings the baby’s organ into his mouth immediately after the excision of the foreskin and sucks blood from it vigorously. This action lowers the internal pressure in the tissues of the organ, in the blood vessels of the head of the organ and in the exposed ends of the arterioles that have just been cut. Thus, the difference between the pressure in the blood vessels in the base of the organ and the pressure in the blood vessels at its tip is increased. This requirement has deep religious significance as well as medical benefits....Immediately after incising or injuring an artery, the arterial walls contract and obstruct, or at least reduce, the flow of blood. Since the arterioles of the orlah, or the foreskin, branch off from the dorsal arteries (the arteries of the upper side of the organ), cutting away the foreskin can result in a temporary obstruction in these dorsal arteries. This temporary obstruction, caused by arterial muscle contraction, continues to develop into a more enduring blockage as the stationary blood begins to clot. The tragic result can be severe hypoxia (deprivation of the supply of blood and oxygen) of the glans penis.28 If the arterial obstruction becomes more permanent, gangrene follows; the baby may lose his glans, and it may even become a life-threatening situation. Such cases have been known to occur. Only by immediately clearing the blockage can one prevent such clotting from happening. Performing metzitzah immediately after circumcision lowers the internal pressure within the tissues and blood vessels of the glans, thus raising the pressure gradient between the blood vessels at the base of the organ and the blood vessels at its distal end—the glans as well as the excised arterioles of the foreskin, which branch off of the dorsal arteries. This increase in pressure gradient (by a factor of four to six!) can resolve an acute temporary blockage and restore blood flow to the glans, thus significantly reducing both the danger of immediate, acute hypoxia and the danger of developing a permanent obstruction by means of coagulation. How do we know when a temporary blockage has successfully been averted? When the “blood in the further reaches [i.e., the proximal dorsal artery] is extracted,” as Rambam has stated.}}

There are other modern antiseptic and antibiotic techniques—all used as part of the ''brit milah'' today—which many say accomplish the intended purpose of ''metzitzah'', however, since ''metzitzah'' is one of the four steps to fulfill Mitzvah, it continues to be practiced by many Orthodox and Hassidic Jews.<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> The practice has become a controversy in both secular and [[Jewish medical ethics]]. The ritual of ''metzitzah'' is found in [[Mishnah]] Shabbat 19:2, which lists it as one of the four steps involved in the circumcision rite. [[Moses Sofer]] (1762–1839) observed that the Talmud states that the rationale for this part of the ritual was hygienic — i.e., to protect the health of the child.  The Chasam Sofer permitted ''metzitzah'' with a sponge to be used instead of oral suction in a case presented to him for a ruling. His letter was published in ''Kochvei Yitzchok.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/top/editletcontent.php3?artid=4591 |title=Editorial & Opinion |publisher=The Jewish Week |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> [[Moshe Shik]] (1807–1879), a student of Moses Sofer, states in his book of Responsa, ''She’eilos u’teshuvos Maharam Shik'' (Orach Chaim 152,){{Elucidate|date=July 2011}} that Moses Sofer gave the ruling in that specific instance only and that it may not be applied elsewhere. He also states (''Yoreh Deah'' 244) that the practice is possibly a Sinaitic tradition, i.e., [[Halacha l'Moshe m'Sinai]].

[[Chaim Hezekiah Medini]] claimed the practice to be ''Halacha l'Moshe m'Sinai'' and  elaborates on what prompted Moses Sofer to give the above ruling.<ref>Sdei Chemed vol.8 page 238</ref> He tells the story that a student of Moses Sofer, [[Lazar Horowitz]], author of ''Yad Elazer'' and [[Chief Rabbi of Vienna]] at the time, needed the ruling because of a governmental attempt to ban circumcision completely if it included ''metztitzah b'peh.'' He therefore asked Sofer to give him permission to do ''brit milah'' without ''metzitzah b’peh.''

Because of the risk of infection, some rabbinical authorities have ruled that the traditional practice of direct contact should be replaced by using a glass tube between the wound and the [[mohel]]'s mouth, so there is no direct oral contact. The [[Rabbinical Council of America]], the largest group of [[Modern Orthodox]] rabbis, endorses this method.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=100605 |title=Metzitza Be'Peh - Halachic Clarification Regarding Metzitza Be'Peh, RCA Clarifies Halachic Background to Statement of March 1, 2005 |publisher=Rabbis.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}</ref>  The RCA paper states: ''"Rabbi Schachter even reports that Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik reports that his father, Rav Moshe Soloveitchik, would not permit a mohel to perform metzitza be’peh with direct oral contact, and that his grandfather, Rav Chaim Soloveitchik, instructed mohelim in Brisk not to do metzitza be’peh with direct oral contact.

In September 2012, the [[New York Department of Health]] unanimously ruled that the practice of metztizah b'peh should require informed consent from the parent or guardian of the child undergoing the ritual.<ref>[http://www.vosizneias.com/113562/2012/09/13/new-york-ny-city-approves-metzitzah-bpeh-consent-form/ New York, NY - City Approves Metzitzah B’Peh Consent Form (full video NYC DOH debate)], Vosizneias.com, Published September 13, 2012</ref> Prior to the ruling, several hundred rabbis, including Rabbi David Neiderman, the executive director of the United Jewish Organization of Williamsburg, signed a declaration stating that they would not inform parents of the potential dangers that came with metzitzah b'peh, even if informed consent became law.<ref>[http://www.vosizneias.com/112847/2012/09/02/new-york-rabbis-say-theyll-defy-state-law-on-metzitzah-bpeh New York - Rabbis Say They’ll Defy Law On Metzitzah B’peh], Vosizneias.com, Published September 2, 2012</ref>

===Hatafat dam brit===
A brit milah is more than circumcision, it is a sacred ritual in Judaism, as distinguished from its non-ritual requirement in [[Islam]]. One ramification is that the brit is not considered complete unless a drop of blood is actually drawn. The standard medical methods of [[circumcision]] through constriction do not meet the requirements of the [[halakhah]] for brit milah, because they cause [[hemostasis]], ''i.e.'', they stop the flow of blood. Morever, circumcision alone, in the absence of the brit milah ceremony, does not fulfill the requirements of the mitzvah. Therefore, in cases where a Jew who was circumcised outside of a brit milah, an already-circumcised convert, or an [[Aposthia|aposthetic]] (born without a foreskin) individual, the mohel draws a symbolic drop of blood ({{lang-he|הטפת דם}}, {{transl|he|''hatafat-dam''}})from the penis at the point where the foreskin would have been or was attached.<ref>[[Shulchan Aruch]], [[Yoreh De'ah]], 263:4</ref>

==''Milah l'shem giur''==
[[File:Göttingen-Beschneidungswerkzeuge.02.JPG|thumb|right|Set of brit milah implements,  [[Göttingen]] city museum]]
A ''Milah L'shem giur'' is a "Circumcision for the purpose of conversion". In [[Orthodox Judaism]], this procedure is usually done by adoptive parents for adopted boys who are being converted as part of the adoption or by families with young children converting together. The conversion of a minor is valid in both [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] until a child reaches the age of majority (13 for a boy, 12 for a girl); at that time the child has the option of renouncing his conversion and Judaism, and the conversion will then be considered retroactively invalid. He must be informed of his right to renounce his conversion if he wishes. If he does not make such a statement it is accepted that the boy is halakhically Jewish. [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis will generally not convert a non-Jewish child raised by a mother who has not converted to Judaism.<ref>Rabbi Paysach J. Krohn, ''Bris Milah'' [[Artscroll|Mesorah Publications Ltd]], 1985, pp.103-105</ref>

The laws of conversion and conversion-related circumcision in [[Orthodox Judaism]] have numerous complications, and authorities recommend that a rabbi be consulted well in advance.

In [[Conservative Judaism]], the Milah l'Shem giur procedure is also performed for a boy whose mother has not converted, but with the intention that the child be raised Jewish.  This conversion of a child to Judaism without the conversion of the mother is allowed by [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] interpretations of [[halakha]]. Conservative Rabbis will authorize it only under the condition that the child be raised as a Jew in a single-faith household. Should the mother convert, and if the boy has not yet reached his third birthday, the child may be immersed in the [[mikveh]] with the mother, after the mother has already immersed, to become Jewish.  If the mother does not convert, the child may be immersed in a mikveh, or body of natural waters, to complete the child's conversion to Judaism. This can be done before the child is even one year old. If the child did not immerse in the [[mikveh]], or the boy was too old, then the child may choose of their own accord to become Jewish at age 13 as a [[Bar Mitzvah]], and complete the conversion then.<ref>[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19861990/reisner_conversion.pdf Rabbi Avram Israel Reisner, On the conversion of adoptive and patrilineal children], Rabbinical Assembly  [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]], 1988 {{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref>

*The ceremony, when performed l'Shem giur, does not have to be performed on a particular day, and does not override [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish Holidays]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/212,657813/Can-a-brit-take-place-on-Yom-Kippur.html |title=Can a brit take place on Yom Kippur? - holidays general information holiday information life cycle circumcision the brit |publisher=Askmoses.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahavat-israel.com/torat/britmila.php |title=The Mitzvah of Brit Milah (Bris) |publisher=Ahavat Israel |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}</ref>
*In Orthodox Judaism, there is a split of authorities on whether the child receives a [[Hebrew name]] at the Brit ceremony or upon immersion in the [[Mikvah]]. According to ''Zichron Brit LeRishonim'', naming occurs at the Brit with a different formula than the standard Brit Milah. The more common practice among [[Ashkenazic]] Jews follows Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], with naming occurring at immersion.

Where the procedure was performed but not followed by immersion or other requirements of the conversion procedure (e.g., in [[Conservative Judaism]], where the mother has not converted), if the boy chooses to complete the conversion at [[Bar Mitzvah]], a ''Milah l'shem giur'' performed when the boy was an infant removes the obligation to undergo either a full brit milah or ''hatafat dam brit''.

==Reasons for circumcision==

In ''Of the Special Laws, Book 1'', the Jewish philosopher [[Philo]] (20 BC - AD 50) gives six reasons for the practice of circumcision.<ref>

</ref>  He attributes four of the reasons to "men of divine spirit and wisdom".  These include the idea that circumcision:
# protects against disease,
# secures cleanliness "in a way that is suited to the people consecrated to God", 
# causes the circumcised portion of the penis to resemble a heart, thereby representing a physical connection between the "breath contained within the heart [that] is generative of thoughts, and the generative organ itself [that] is productive of living beings", and 
# promotes prolificness by removing impediments to the flow of semen.  To these, Philo added two of his own reasons, including the idea that circumcision 
# "signified figuratively the excision of all superfluous and excessive pleasure" and 
# "that it is a symbol of a man's knowing himself".

[[Saadia Gaon|Rabbi Saadia Gaon]] considers something to be 'complete', if it lacks nothing, but also has nothing that is unneeded. He regards the foreskin an unneeded organ that God created in man, and so by amputating it, the man is completed.<ref>

[[Maimonides]] (Moses ben Maimon "Rambam", CE 1135-1204), who apart from being a great Torah scholar was also a physician and philosopher, argued that circumcision serves as a common bodily sign to members of the same faith. He also asserted that the main purpose of the act is to repress sexual pleasure, with the strongest reason being that it is difficult for a woman to separate from an uncircumcised man with whom she has had sex.<ref>

The author of [[Sefer ha-Chinuch]]<ref>2nd commandment</ref> provides three reasons for the practice of circumcision:
#To complete the form of man, by removing what he claims to be a redundant organ;
#To mark the chosen people, so their body will be different as their soul is; The organ chosen for the mark is the one responsible for the sustenance of the species.
#Said completion isn't congenital, but left to the man. This implies, that as he completes the form of his body, so can he complete the form of his soul.

Talmud professor [[Daniel Boyarin]] offered two explanations for circumcision.  One is that it is a literal inscription on the Jewish body of the name of God in the form of the letter "[[yodh|yud]]" (from "yesod").  The second is that the act of bleeding represents a feminization of Jewish men, significant in the sense that the covenant represents a marriage between Jews and (a symbolically male) God.<ref>Boyarin, Daniel. "`This We Know to Be the Carnal Israel': Circumcision and the Erotic Life of God and Israel," Critical Inquiry. (Spring, 1992), 474-506.</ref>

==Reform Judaism==
The leaders of Reform Judaism in early nineteenth century Germany at first rejected circumcision, claiming it to be 'barbaric'.<ref>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/The_Origins_of_Reform_Judaism.html ''The Origins of Reform Judaism'', The American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise], 2010 (retrieved November 11, 2010)</ref> [[Theodor Herzl]], the founder of Zionism and associated with the Reform movement, notably refused to allow his son to be circumcised.<ref>''Female Circumcision: Multicultural Perspectives'',

Kimmel, SUNY Press, 2005, page 181</ref> By 1871, rabbinic leadership in the German Reform Movement reasserted "the supreme importance of circumcision in Judaism", though those who had not been circumcised would continue to be considered as Jews. Although the issue of circumcision of converts continues to be debated, the necessity of Brit Milah for Jewish infant boys has been stressed in every subsequent Reform rabbis manual or guide.<ref>{{cite web

However, the connection of the Reform movement to an anti-circumcision, pro-symbolic stance is a historical one. From the early days of the movement in Germany, some classical Reformers hoped to replace ritual circumcision "with a symbolic act, as has been done for other bloody practices, such as the sacrifices."<ref>Katz, Jacob (1998) Divine Law in Human Hands: Case Studies in Halakhic Flexibility. Jerusalem: Hebrew University ISBN 978-965-223-980-8</ref>  As a result, many European Jewish fathers during the nineteenth century chose not to circumcise their sons, including [[Theodore Herzl]].<ref>Stewart, Desmond (1974) Theodore  Herzl. New York: Doubleday ISBN 978-0-385-08896-1</ref> In the US, an official Reform resolution in 1893 abolished circumcision for converts,<ref>Meyer, Michael "''Berit Mila'' within the History  of the Reform Movement" in Barth, Lewis (1990) ''Berit Mila'' in the Reform Context. New York: Berit Milah Board of reform Judaism</ref> and this ambivalence towards the practice has carried over to classical-minded Reform Jews today. In Elyse Wechterman's essay ''A Plea for Inclusion'', she argues that, even in the absence of circumcision, committed Jews should never be turned away, especially by a movement "where no other ritual observance is mandated". She goes on to advocate for an alternate covenant ceremony, ''brit atifah'', for both boys and girls as a welcoming ritual into Judaism.<ref>Mark, Elizabeth Wyner (2003) The Covenant of Circumcision. Lebanon, NH: Brandeis ISBN 1-58465-307-8</ref> With a continuing negativity towards circumcision still present within a minority of modern-day Reform, Judaic scholar Jon Levenson has warned that if they "continue to judge ''brit milah'' to be not only medically unnecessary but also brutalizing and mutilating...the abhorrence of it expressed by some early Reform leaders will return with a vengeance", proclaiming that circumcision will be "the latest front in the battle over the Jewish future in America."<ref>Levenson, Jon (March 2000) "The New Enemies of Circumcision", ''Commentary''</ref>

In [[Israel]], a small number of families who have chosen not to have their sons circumcised formed a support group in the year 2000. Over two and a half years, 200 couples have enlisted.<ref name="ReferenceA">Hilary Leila Kreiger, ''A cut above the rest'', Jerusalem Post, 21 November 2002</ref> Meanwhile, Ya'acov Malkin, the academic director of the College of Judaism as Culture in Israel, who circumcised his own son 50 years before "because of habit, because it was a custom, it is a custom of the Jews", says of circumcision: "I don't regard it as a religious act at all... if it's medically not necessary, it's not necessary."  [[Humanistic Judaism]] argues that "circumcision is not required for Jewish identity."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://jewishcircumcision.org/israel_news.htm |author=Hilary Leila Kreiger |title= A cut above the rest |publisher= Jerusalem Post|date=21 November 2002}}</ref>
