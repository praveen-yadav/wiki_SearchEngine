'''Caste''' is a form of [[social stratification]] characterized by [[endogamy]], hereditary transmission of a lifestyle which often includes an occupation, ritual status in a hierarchy and customary social interaction and exclusion based on cultural notions of purity and pollution.<ref name=OxfordDictionarySociology>{{citation|last1=Scott|first1=John|last2=Marshall|first2=Gordon|title=A Dictionary of Sociology|chapter=caste|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=id8iAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA66|location=Oxford, UK; New York, NY|accessdate=10 August 2012|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-860987-2|page=66}}</ref><ref name=winthrop-1991>{{citation|last=Winthrop|first=Robert H.|chapter=Caste|title=Dictionary of Concepts in Cultural Anthropology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3xoB_3C5N5QC&pg=PA27|accessdate=10 August 2012|year=1991|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-313-24280-9|pages=27–30}}</ref>  Its paradigmatic  ethnographic example is the division of Indian society into rigid social groups, with roots in India's ancient history and persisting until today. However, the economic significance of the [[caste system in India]] has been declining as a result of urbanization and [[affirmative action]] programs. A subject of much scholarship by sociologists and anthropologists, the Indian caste system is sometimes used as an analogical basis for the study of caste-like social divisions existing outside India.

==Etymology==
The English word "caste" derives from the Spanish and Portuguese ''casta'', which the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] quotes [[John Minsheu]]'s Spanish dictionary (1599) to mean, "race, lineage, or breed."<ref name=oed-caste>{{cite web|publisher = Oxford English Dictionary|year = 1989|title=Caste, n|url=http://www.oed.com}}</ref>  When the Spanish colonized the New World, they used the word to mean a "clan or lineage."   However, it was the Portuguese who employed ''casta'' in the primary modern sense when they applied it to the many in-marrying hereditary Hindu social groups  they encountered upon their arrival in India in 1498.<ref name=oed-caste/><ref name=pitt-rivers>{{citation|last=Pitt-Rivers|first=Julian|editor=T O Beidelman|title=The translation of culture essays to E.E.

Historically, the caste system in India has consisted of thousands of endogamous groups called [[Jatis]] or Quoms (among Muslims). The scholarly Brahmans of India envisaged the four well-known categories to classify the society (the [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varnas]]):<ref>{{cite journal|title=Closed Social Stratification in India|author=F.G.

* [[Kshatriya]]s (warriors, administrators and law enforcers)
* [[Vaishya]]s (agriculturists, cattle raisers and traders)
* [[Shudra]]s (service providers and artisans)

It has been pointed out that some people were considered left out from these four caste classifications, and in certain places were called Panchama (literally, the fifth).

===Nepal===
{{Main|Nepalese caste system|Ethnicity and caste in Nepal}}
The [[Nepal]]ese caste system resembles that of the Indian [[Jāti]] system with numerous Jāti divisions with a Varna system superimposed for a rough equivalence. But since the culture and the society is different some of the things are different. Inscriptions attest the beginnings of a caste system during the Lichchhavi period.  Jayasthiti Malla (1382–95) categorized Newars into 64 castes (Gellner 2001). A similar exercise was made during the reign of Mahindra Malla (1506–75). The Hindu social code was later set up in Gorkha by Ram Shah(1603–36).

===Pakistan===
{{Main|Caste system among South Asian Muslims}}

Religious, historical and sociocultural factors have helped define the bounds of endogamy for Muslims in some parts of [[Pakistan]]. There is a preference for endogamous marriages based on the clan-oriented nature of the society, which values and actively seeks similarities in social group identity based on several factors, including religious, sectarian, ethnic, and tribal/clan affiliation. Religious affiliation is itself multilayered and includes religious considerations other than being Muslim, such as sectarian identity (e.g. Shia or Sunni, etc.) and religious orientation within the sect (Isnashari, Ismaili, Ahmedi, etc.).

Both ethnic affiliation (e.g. Pathan,Sindhi, Baloch, Punjabi, etc.) and membership of specific biraderis or zaat/quoms are additional integral components of social identity.<ref name="barth">{{cite book | last = Barth | first = Fredrik | editor = E.

Ancient Sri Lankan texts such as the Pujavaliya, Sadharmaratnavaliya and Yogaratnakaraya and inscriptional evidence show that the above hierarchy prevailed throughout the feudal period. The repetition of the same caste hierarchy even as recently as the 18th century, in the British/Kandyan period Kadayimpoth - Boundary books as well, indicates the continuation of the tradition right up to the end of Sri Lanka's monarchy.

{{Main|Balinese caste system}}
[[Bali]]nese caste structure has been described in early 20th-century European literature to be based on three categories &ndash; triwangsa (thrice born) or the nobility, dwijati (twice born) in contrast to ekajati (once born) the low folks. Four statuses were identified in these sociological studies, spelled a bit differently than the caste categories for India:<ref name=boon>{{cite book|title=The Anthropological Romance of Bali 1597-1972: Dynamic Perspectives in Marriage and Caste, Politics and Religion|author=James Boon|year=1977|isbn=0-521-21398-3}}</ref>
*Brahmanas - priest
*Satrias - knighthood
*Wesias - commerce
*Sudras - servitude

The Brahmana caste was further subdivided by these Dutch ethnographers into two: Siwa and Buda. The Siwa caste was subdivided into five &ndash; Kemenuh, Keniten, Mas, Manuba and Petapan. This classification was to accommodate the observed marriage between higher caste Brahmana men with lower caste women. The other castes were similarly further sub-classified by these 19th-century and early-20th-century ethnographers based on numerous criteria ranging from profession, endogamy or exogamy or polygamy, and a host of other factors in a manner similar to [[casta]]s in Spanish colonies such as Mexico, and caste system studies in British colonies such as India.<ref name=boon/>

During the period of [[Yuan Dynasty]], ruler [[Kublai Khan]] enforced a ''Four Class System'', which was a legal caste system. The order of four classes of people was maintained by the information of the descending order were:-
* [[Mongols|Mongolian]]
* [[Semu]] people
* [[Han Chinese|Han]] people (in the northern areas of China)
* Southerners (people of the former Northern [[Song Dynasty]])

Some scholars notes that it was a kind of psychological indication that the earlier they submitted to Mongolian people, the higher social status they would have. The 'Four Class System' and its people received different treatment in political, legal, and military affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/history/yuan/four-class-system.htm |title='Four-Class System' of Yuan Dynasty |publisher=Travelchinaguide.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref><ref>"The Cambridge History of China: Volume 6, Alien Regimes and Border States, 710-1368", by Denis C.

====Japan====
{{Main|Feudal Japan hierarchy}}
[[File:Samurai and servant.jpg|thumb|Japanese [[samurai]] of importance and servant.]]

In Japan's history, social strata based on inherited position rather than personal merits, was rigid and highly formalized. At the top were the Emperor and Court nobles ([[kuge]]), together with the Shogun and daimyo. Below them the population was divided into four classes in a system known as ''mibunsei'' (身分制). These were: [[samurai]], peasants, craftsmen and merchants. Only the samurai class was allowed to bear arms. A samurai had a right to kill any peasants and other craftsmen and merchants whom he felt were disrespectful. Craftsmen produced products, being the third, and the last merchants were thought to be as the meanest class because they did not produce any products. The castes were further sub-divided; for example, the peasant caste were labelled as ''furiuri'', ''tanagari'', ''mizunomi-byakusho'' amongst others. The castes and sub-classes, as in Europe, were from the same race, religion and culture.

Howell, in his review of [[Japan]]ese society notes that if a Western power had colonized Japan in the 19th century, they would have discovered and imposed a rigid four-caste hierarchy in Japan.<ref>{{cite book|title=Geographies of identity in nineteenth-century Japan|author=David L. Howell|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-24085-5|year=2005}}</ref>

De Vos and Wagatsuma observe that a systematic and extensive caste system was part of the Japanese society. They also discuss how alleged caste impurity and alleged racial inferiority, concepts often quickly assumed to be slightly different, are superficial terms, two faces of identical inner psychological processes, which expressed themselves in Japan and other countries of the world.<ref name=gdvhw>{{cite book|title=Japan's invisible race: caste in culture and personality|author=George De Vos and Hiroshi Wagatsuma|publisher=University of California Press|year=1966|isbn=978-0-520-00306-4}}</ref>

The Osu caste is determined by one's birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual. Once born into Osu caste, this Nigerian person is an outcast, shunned and ostracized, with limited opportunities or acceptance, regardless of his or her ability or merit. Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities.<ref name=Obinna1/>

The ''osu'' class systems of eastern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Cameroon]] are derived from indigenous religious beliefs and discriminate against the "Osus" people as "owned by deities" and outcasts.

The Songhai economy was based on a caste system. The most common were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters. Lower caste participants consisted of mostly non-farm working immigrants, who at times were provided special privileges and held high positions in society. At the top were noblemen and direct descendants of the original Songhai people, followed by freemen and traders.<ref>[http://www.africankingdoms.com African Kingdoms Songhai Class System]</ref>

In a review of social stratification systems in Africa, Richter reports that the term caste has been used by French and American scholars to many groups of West African artisans. These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in [[Cote d'lvoire]], with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Further considerations of caste in West Africa: The Senufo|author=Dolores Richter|journal=Africa|date= January 1980|volume=50|pages=37–54|doi=10.2307/1158641}}</ref>

Similarly, the [[Mandé peoples|Mandé]] societies in [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Senegal]] and [[Sierra Leone]] have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the ''jonow'' slaves as inferior. Similarly, the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the ''geer'' (freeborn/nobles), ''jaam'' (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass ''neeno''. In various parts of West Africa, [[Fula people|Fulani]] societies also have class divisions. Other castes include ''Griots'', ''Forgerons'', and ''Cordonniers''.

Tamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Tukulor, Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, Fulani, and Tuareg. Castes appeared among the ''Malinke'' people no later than 14th century, and was present among the ''Wolof'' and ''Soninke'', as well as some ''Songhay'' and ''Fulani'' populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the ''Sosso-Malinke'' war described in the ''Sunjata'' epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire.

As West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specializations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.<ref name=tamari1>{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1991|volume=32|pages=221–250|doi=10.1017/S0021853700025718|title=The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa|author=Tal Tamari}}</ref>

====East Africa====
In a review published in 1977, Todd reports that numerous scholars report a system of social stratification in different parts of Africa that resembles some or all aspects of caste system. Examples of such caste systems, he claims, are to be found in Rwanda and Ethiopia in communities such as the ''Gurage'' and ''Konso''. He then presents the ''Dime'' of South-West Ethiopia, amongst whom there operates a system which Todd claims can be unequivocally labelled as caste system. The ''Dime'' have seven castes whose size varies considerably. Each broad caste level is a hierarchical order that is based on notions of purity, non-purity and impurity. It uses the concepts of defilement to limit contacts between caste categories and to preserve the purity of the upper castes. These caste categories have been exclusionary, endogamous and the social identity inherited.<ref>{{cite journal|title=LA CASTE EN AFRIQUE? (Caste in Africa?)|author=D. M.

The [[Borana Oromo]] of southern [[Ethiopia]] in the [[Horn of Africa]] also have a class system, where the Watta, an acculturated [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] group, represent the poorest class.

The traditionally [[nomad]]ic [[Somali people]] are divided into clans, wherein the [[Rahanweyn]] agro-pastoral clans and the occupational clans such as the [[Madhiban]] are sometimes treated as outcasts.<ref>I. M. Lewis, ''A pastoral democracy: a study of pastoralism and politics among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa'', (LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster: 1999), pp.13-14</ref>

===Europe===
====France and Spain====
For centuries, through the modern times, the majority regarded [[Cagot]]s of western France and northern Spain as an inferior caste, the untouchables. While they had the same skin color and religion as the majority, in the Churches, they had to use segregated doors, drink from segregated fonts, receive communion on the end of long wooden spoons. It was a closed social system. The socially isolated Cagots were endogamous, and chances of social mobility non-existent.<ref>{{cite news|title=The last untouchable in Europe|author=Sean Thomas|date=28 July 2008|publisher=The Independent, United Kingdom|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-last-untouchable-in-europe-878705.html|location=London}}</ref><ref name="Hansson1996">{{cite book|author=Anders Hansson|title=Chinese Outcasts: Discrimination and Emancipation in Late Imperial China|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&pg=PA15|year=1996|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10596-6|pages=15–16}}</ref>

[[Spain]] followed the ''[[Casta]]'', which was based on race. There were four main categories of race:-

* Peninsular, a Spaniard born in Spain;
* Criollo (feminine, criolla), a person of Spanish descent born in the New World;
* Indio (fem. india), a person who is descendent of the original inhabitants of the Americas;
* Negro (fem. negra) - a person of black African descent, usually a slave or their free descendants
