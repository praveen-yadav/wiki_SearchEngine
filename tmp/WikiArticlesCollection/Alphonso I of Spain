There has not been a monarch known as '''Alphonso''' or '''Alfonso I of Spain''', the first king of that name of the unified Spain being [[Alfonso XII of Spain]] (1874–1885).

Several precursor kingdoms have had an '''Alfonso I'''. You may be looking for:
*[[Alfonso I of Asturias]] (739–757).
*[[Alfonso I of Aragon]] and Navarre (1104–1134), known as ''the Battler''
*[[Alfonso II of Aragon]], aka Alfons I, Count of Barcelona, (1162–1196) known as ''el Cast (the Chaste)'' or ''el Trobador (the Troubadour)''
