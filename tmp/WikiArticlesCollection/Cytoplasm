The '''cytoplasm''' comprises [[cytosol]] – the gel-like substance enclosed within the [[cell membrane]] – and the [[organelle]]s – the [[cell (biology)|cell]]'s internal sub-structures. All of the contents of the cells of [[prokaryote]] organisms (such as [[bacteria]], which lack a [[cell nucleus]]) are contained within the cytoplasm.  Within the cells of [[eukaryote]] organisms the contents of the [[cell nucleus]] are separated from the cytoplasm, and are then called the [[nucleoplasm]]. The cytoplasm is about 80% water and usually colorless.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fi.edu/qa97/biology/cells/cell3.html | title =Cytoplasm | author =''[[Franklin Institute]]'' | publisher =fi.edu | date =November 23, 2013}}</ref>

It is within the cytoplasm that most cellular activities occur, such as many [[metabolic pathway]]s including [[glycolysis]], and processes such as [[cell division]]. The inner, granular mass is called the [[endoplasm]] and the outer, clear and glassy layer is called the [[cell cortex]] or the [[ectoplasm (cell biology)|ectoplasm]].

Movement of [[calcium ion]]s in and out of the cytoplasm is thought to be a [[Recognition signal|signaling]] activity for [[metabolic]] processes.<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Calcium?topic=49557 ''Calcium''. eds. A.Jorgensen, C. Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth]. National Council for Science and the Environment.</ref>

In [[plant]]s, movements of the cytoplasm around vacuoles are known as [[cytoplasmic streaming]].

== Constituents ==
The cytoplasm has three major elements; the cytosol, organelles and inclusions.

=== Cytosol ===
{{main|Cytosol}}

The cytosol is the portion of the cytoplasm not contained within membrane-bound organelles. Cytosol makes up about 70% of the cell volume and is composed of water, salts and organic molecules.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070331230518/http://sun.menloschool.org/~birchler/cells/animals/cytoplasm/ Cytoplasm Composition]. menloschool.org</ref> 
The cytosol is a complex mixture of [[cytoskeleton]] filaments, dissolved molecules, and water that fills much of the volume of a cell. The cytosol also contains the [[protein filament]]s that make up the [[cytoskeleton]], as well as soluble [[proteins]] and small structures such as [[ribosome]]s, [[proteasome]]s, and the mysterious [[Vault (organelle)|vault complexes]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=van Zon A, Mossink MH, Scheper RJ, Sonneveld P, Wiemer EA |title=The vault complex |journal=Cell. Mol. Life Sci. |volume=60 |issue=9 |pages=1828–37 |year=2003 |month=September |pmid=14523546 |doi=10.1007/s00018-003-3030-y}}</ref> The inner, granular and more fluid portion of the cytoplasm is referred to as endoplasm.[[Image:Localisations02eng.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Proteins in different [[cellular compartment]]s and structures tagged with [[green fluorescent protein]]]]

Due to this network of fibres and high concentrations of dissolved [[macromolecule]]s, such as [[protein]]s, an effect called [[macromolecular crowding]] occurs and the cytosol does not act as an [[ideal solution]]. This crowding effect alters how the components of the cytosol interact with each other.

=== Organelles ===
{{main|Organelles}}
Organelles (literally "little organs"), are usually membrane-bound, and are structures inside the cell that have specific functions. Some major organelles that are suspended in the cytosol are the [[mitochondria]], the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], the [[Golgi apparatus]], [[vacuoles]], [[lysosomes]], and in plant cells [[chloroplast]]s.

=== Cytoplasmic inclusions ===
{{main|Cytoplasmic inclusion}}
The inclusions are small particles of insoluble substances suspended in the cytosol. A huge range of inclusions exist in different cell types, and range from crystals of [[calcium oxalate]] or [[silicon dioxide]] in plants,<ref name=Prychid1999>{{Cite journal | author = Prychid, Christina J.; Rudall, Paula J. | year = 1999 | title = Calcium Oxalate Crystals in Monocotyledons: A Review of their Structure and Systematics | journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 84 | issue = 6 | page = 725 | doi = 10.1006/anbo.1999.0975 | url = http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/84/6/725}}</ref><ref name=Prychid2003>{{Cite journal | author = Prychid, C.

===Controversy and research===
The cytoplasm, mitochondria and most organelles are contributions to the cell from the maternal gamete. There is considerably less research and understanding on [[Non-Mendelian inheritance|cytoplasmic inheritance/maternal inheritance]] and mitochondrial DNA compared to the cell nucleus and genomic DNA. Historically, there has been neglect of researching whatever has been labeled female or feminine. The cytoplasm is one organelle that has been labeled feminine.<ref name=Shiebinger>{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has feminism changed science?|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge: Harvard University Press|page=147|isbn=0674005449}}</ref> The cytoplasm/nucleus being labeled as feminine/masculine follows the example of egg/sperm being gendered; both cytoplasm and egg are considered nonresistant to the efforts and pursuits of the active nucleus and sperm.
