'''Academic elitism''' is the criticism that [[academia]] or academics are prone to [[elitism]]. The term "[[ivory tower]]" often carries with it an implicit critique of academic elitism.

== Description ==


Economist [[Thomas Sowell]]'s ''[[Intellectuals and Society]]'' claims that intellectuals have an undeserved "[[halo effect]]" and face fewer [[disincentive]]s than other professions against speaking outside their expertise. In Sowell's estimation, academics respected for their contributions in their particular discipline often become known to the general public by commenting on policy issues outside that discipline. 

Critics of academic elitism{{specify|date=August 2013}} argue that highly-educated people tend to form an isolated social group whose views tend to be overrepresented among [[journalists]], [[professor]]s, and other members of the [[intelligentsia]] who often draw their salary and funding from taxpayers. Economist Dan Klein shows that the worldwide top-35 economics departments pull 76 percent of their faculty from their own graduates. He argues that the academic culture is pyramidal, not [[Polycentric law|polycentric]], and resembles a closed and genteel social circle. Meanwhile, he claims, academia draws on resources from taxpayers, foundations, endowments, and tuition payers, and it judges the social service delivered{{clarify|date=August 2013}}. The result is a self-organizing and self-validating circle.<ref>

Another criticism{{by whom|date=August 2013}} is that universities tend more to [[pseudointellectual|pseudo-intellectualism]] than intellectualism per se; for example, academicians may be charged with over-complicating problems and expressing them in obscure language (e.g., the [[Sokal affair]], [[obscurantism]]).

Academic elitism suggests{{clarify|date=August 2013}} that in highly competitive academic environments only those individuals who have engaged in [[scholarly method|scholarship]] are deemed to have anything worthwhile to say, or do{{attribution needed|date=August 2013}}. It suggests{{clarify|date=August 2013}} that individuals who have not engaged in such scholarship are [[Crank (person)|cranks]]. Steven Zhang of the ''[[Cornell Daily Sun]]'' has described the graduates of elite schools, especially those in the [[Ivy League]], as having a "smug sense of success" because "It makes us believe gaining entrance into the Ivy League is an accomplishment unto itself."<ref>
