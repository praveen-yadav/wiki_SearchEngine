'''The economy of the [[Cayman Islands]]''', a [[British overseas territory]] located in the western [[Caribbean Sea]], is mainly fueled by the [[tourism|tourism sector]] and by the [[Financial services|financial services sector]], together representing 70-80 percent of the country's [[gross domestic product]] (GDP).<ref name="USDep" /> The Cayman Islands Investment Bureau, a [[government agency]], has been established with the mandate of promoting investment and economic development in the territory.<ref>[http://www.investcayman.ky Cayman Islands Investment Bureau].</ref> 

The emergence of what are now considered the Cayman Islands' "twin pillars of economic development" (tourism and [[international finance]]) started in the 1950s with the introduction of modern [[transportation]] and [[telecommunications]].<ref name="USDep">[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5286.htm Background Note: Cayman Islands].

==History==

From the earliest settlement of the [[Cayman Islands]], economic activity was hindered by isolation and a limited natural resource base. The harvesting of [[sea turtle]]s to resupply passing sailing ships was the first major economic activity on the islands, but local stocks were depleted by the 1790s. [[Agriculture]], while sufficient to support the small early settler population, has always been limited by the scarcity of arable land. [[Fishing]], [[shipbuilding]], and [[cotton]] production boosted the [[economy]] during the early days of settlement.  In addition, settlers scavenged shipwreck remains from the surrounding coral reefs. 

The boom in the Cayman Islands' international finance industry can also be at least partly attributed to the [[British overseas territory]] having no [[direct taxation]].  A popular legend attributes the tax-free status to the heroic acts of the inhabitants during a maritime tragedy in 1794, often referred to as "Wreck of the Ten Sails".<ref>[http://www.caymanchamber.ky/visitor/poi.htm#wreck Points of Interest: The Wreck of the Ten Sails]. Cayman Islands Chamber of Commerce, 2003. Retrieved 11 September 2008.</ref> The wreck involved nine British merchant vessels and their naval escort, the [[frigate]] HMS Convert, that ran aground on the reefs off [[Grand Cayman]]. Due to the rescue efforts by the Caymanians using canoes, the loss of life was limited to eight.<ref>[http://www.nationaltrust.org.ky/info/eelight.html The East End Lighthouse Park]. National Trust of the Cayman Islands, 8 June 2006. Retrieved 11 September 2008.</ref> However, records from the colonial era indicate that Cayman Islands, then a [[Dependent territory|dependency]] of [[Jamaica]], was not tax-exempt during the period that followed. In 1803, the inhabitants signed a petition addressed to the [[governors of Jamaica|Jamaican governor]] asking him to grant them a tax exemption from the "Transient Tax on Wreck Goods".<ref>Smith, Roger C.

==International finance and tourism==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2008}}

The Cayman Islands' tax-free status has attracted numerous banks and other companies to its shores.  

More than 40,000 companies were registered in the Cayman Islands as of 2000, including almost 600 [[bank]]s and [[trust company|trust companies]], with banking assets exceeding $500 billion. Large corporations based in the Cayman Islands such as [[Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation]] (SMIC).  The [[Cayman Islands Stock Exchange]] was opened in 1997.

[[Tourism]] is also a mainstay, accounting for about 70% of GDP and 75% of foreign currency earnings.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cj.html].</ref>  The tourist industry is aimed at the luxury market and caters mainly to visitors from [[North America]]. Unspoiled beaches, [[duty-free shop]]ping, [[scuba diving]], and deep-sea fishing draw almost a million visitors to the islands each year. Due to the well-developed tourist industry, many citizens work in service jobs in that sector.

==Diversification==
The Cayman Islands is seeking to diversify beyond its two traditional industries, and invest in health care and technology. [[Health City Cayman Islands]] is a planned medical tourism hospital in East End being lead by surgeon [[Devi Shetty]]. [[Cayman Enterprise City]] is a [[special economic zone]] planned for Savannah for technology, finance, and education investment. Cayman Sea Salt and Cayman Logwood products are now made in the Cayman Islands.

==Standard of living==

Because the islands cannot produce enough goods to support the population, about 90% of their food and consumer goods must be imported. In addition, the islands have few natural fresh water resources. [[Desalination]] of sea water is used to solve this.
Despite those challenges, the Caymanians enjoy one of the highest outputs per capita and one of the highest standards of living in the world. The Cayman Islands produces gourmet sea salt.

Education is compulsory to the age of 16 and is free to all Caymanian children. Most schools follow the British educational system. Ten primary, one special education, a high school and a middle school ('junior high school') are operated by the government, along with three private high schools. In addition, there is a law school, a university-college and a medical school.
