'''Commonwealth''' is a traditional English term for a political community founded for the common good. Historically, it has sometimes been synonymous with "[[republicanism]]".

More recently it has been used for fraternal associations of some sovereign nations. Most notably, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], an association primarily of former members of the [[British Empire]], is often referred to as simply "the Commonwealth".

==Etymology==
The [[England|English]] noun ''commonwealth'' in the sense meaning "public welfare; general good or advantage" dates from the 15th century.<ref>{{citation |title=Commonwealth |journal=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=dictionary.oed.com | date=1989, 2nd ed. | accessdate=13 March 2010 |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50045157?query_type=word&queryword=commonwealth&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&result_place=1&search_id=Hr0v-iyV0EE-153&hilite=50045157}}</ref> The original phrase "the common-wealth" or "the common weal" (echoed in the modern synonym "public weal") comes from the old meaning of "wealth," which is "well-being", and is itself a loose translation of the Latin [[res publica]] (republic). The term literally meant "common well-being." In the 17th century the definition of "commonwealth" expanded from its original sense of "public welfare" or "commonweal" to mean "a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people; a republic or democratic state."<ref>"Better things were done, and better managed ... under a Commonwealth than under a King."

==Historic usage==

===Iceland===
The [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] or the [[Icelandic Free State]] (Icelandic: Þjóðveldið) was the state existing in Iceland between the establishment of the [[Althing]] in 930 and the pledge of fealty to the [[King of Norway|Norwegian king]] in 1262. It was initially established by a public consisting largely of recent immigrants from [[Norway]] who had fled the unification of that country under [[King]] [[Harald Fairhair]].

===Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth===
{{Main|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
''Republic'' is still an alternative translation of the traditional name of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. [[Wincenty Kadłubek]] (Vincent Kadlubo, 1160–1223) used for the first time the original Latin term ''res publica'' in the context of Poland in his "Chronicles of the Kings and Princes of Poland." The name was used officially for the confederal country formed by [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] 1569–1795.

It is also often referred as "[[Golden Liberty|Nobles' Commonwealth]]" (1505–1795, i.e. before the union).
In contemporary political doctrine of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], "our state is a Republic (Commonwealth) under presidency of the King." The commonwealth introduced a doctrine of religious tolerance called [[Warsaw Confederation]], had its own parliament ''[[Sejm]]'' (although elections were restricted to the [[nobility]] and elected kings, who were bound to certain contracts ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'' from the beginning of the reign. 

"A commonwealth of good counsaile" was the title of the 1607 English translation of the work of [[Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki]] "De optimo senatore" that presented to English readers many of the ideas present in the political system of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

===England===
The [[Commonwealth of England]] was the official name of the political unit (''de facto'' military rule in the name of parliamentary supremacy) that replaced the [[Kingdom of England]] (after the [[English Civil War]]) from 1649–53 and 1659–60, under the rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and his son and successor [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]]. From 1653 to 1659, although still legally known as a Commonwealth, the republic, united with the former [[Kingdom of Scotland]], operated under different institutions (at times as a ''de facto'' monarchy) and is known by historians as the Protectorate. The Commonwealth of England formed the first [[republic]] in the [[Anglosphere|English-speaking world]]. In an English context, it is sometimes referred to as the "Old Commonwealth."

==National==

===Australia===
The term also served when six Australian [[colony|colonies]] [[Federation of Australia|federated]] to form the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]] in 1901. The [[Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act]] created a federal system, in which power is divided between the federal, or national, government and the [[States and territories of Australia|States]]—the evolved status of the colonies. The Constitution stipulated that Australia was a [[constitutional monarchy]], where the [[Head of State]] is the British (or, since 1942, Australian) monarch, who is represented at the federal level by a Governor-General, and at the state level by six Governors, one for each state. The [[Parliament of Australia]] was derived from the British and American systems to form a uniquely Australian system. It is largely based on the British [[Westminster System]], adopting many of its practices and precedents, but with a similar structure—[[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and [[Australian Senate|Senate]]—to the U.S. Congress. In an Australian context, the term "Commonwealth" (capitalised) thus refers to the [[Government of Australia|federal government]] and "Commonwealth of Australia" is the official name of the country.

===Dominica===
The small [[Caribbean]] republic of [[Dominica]] has used the official style ''Commonwealth of Dominica'' since 1970.

===The Bahamas===

[[The Bahamas]] uses the official style ''Commonwealth of The Bahamas''.

[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] left the CIS in August 2008 after [[2008 South Ossetia war|a clash]] with [[Russia]] over [[South Ossetia]]. Its creation signaled the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], its purpose being to "allow a civilized divorce" between the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]].
