'''Sir Alan Ayckbourn''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born 12 April 1939) is a prolific English playwright. He has written and produced more than seventy full-length plays in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] and [[London]] and was, between 1972 and 2009, the artistic director of the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre]] in Scarborough, where all but four of his plays have received their first performance. More than 40 have subsequently been produced in the [[West End theatre|West End]], at the [[Royal National Theatre]] or by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] since his first hit ''[[Relatively Speaking (play)|Relatively Speaking]]'' opened at the Duke of York's Theatre in 1967.

Major successes include ''[[Absurd Person Singular]]'' (1975), ''[[The Norman Conquests]]'' trilogy (1973), ''[[Bedroom Farce (play)|Bedroom Farce]]'' (1975), ''Just Between Ourselves'' (1976), ''A Chorus of Disapproval'' (1984), ''[[Woman in Mind]]'' (1985), ''[[A Small Family Business]]'' (1987), ''[[Man Of The Moment (play)|Man Of The Moment]]'' (1988), [[House & Garden (plays)|''House'' & ''Garden'']] (1999) and ''[[Private Fears in Public Places]]'' (2004). His plays have won numerous awards, including seven London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' Awards. They have been translated into over 35 languages and are performed on stage and television throughout the world. Ten of his plays have been staged on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], attracting two [[Tony Awards|Tony]] nominations, and one [[Tony Awards|Tony]] award.

==Life==

===Childhood===

Ayckbourn was born in [[Hampstead]], London.<ref name=p9>P. Allen, 2001, p. 9</ref><ref name=webbio>[http://biography.alanayckbourn.net/index.htm Biography on the official Alan Ayckbourn website] accessed 5 January 2009</ref> His mother Irene Worley ("Lolly") was a writer of short stories who published under the name "Mary James".<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 10</ref>  His father, Horace Ayckbourn, was an orchestral violinist, at one time deputy leader of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]].<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 6</ref> His parents, who separated shortly after [[World War II]], never married, and Ayckbourn's mother divorced her ''first'' husband to marry again in 1948.<ref name=p9/><ref name=biography>P. Allen, 2001,</ref>

Ayckbourn wrote his first play at Wisborough Lodge (a preparatory school in the village of [[Wisborough Green]]) when he was about 10.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 20</ref> Whilst at prep school as a boarder, his mother wrote to tell him she was marrying Cecil Pye, a bank manager; when he went home for the holidays his new family consisted of his mother, his stepfather and Christopher, his stepfather's son by an earlier marriage. This relationship too, reportedly ran into difficulties early on.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 17–19</ref>

Ayckbourn attended [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Haileybury]], in the village of [[Hertford Heath]], and whilst there toured Europe and America with the school's Shakespeare company.<ref name=webbio/><ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 30–33</ref>

===Adult life===

After leaving school at 17, Ayckbourn's career took several temporary jobs in various places before starting a temporary job at the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre|Scarborough Library Theatre]], where he was introduced to the artistic director, [[Stephen Joseph]].<ref name=webbio/><ref name=p41>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 43–46</ref> It is said that Joseph became both a mentor and father figure for Ayckbourn until his untimely death in 1967,<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 118–119</ref> and he has consistently spoken highly of him.<ref>Ayckbourn, Alan (2003). ''The Crafty Art of Playmaking'', Faber, ISBN 0-571-21509-2</ref>

Ayckbourn's career was briefly interrupted when he was called for [[National Service]]. He was swiftly discharged, officially on medical grounds, but it is suggested that a doctor who noticed his reluctance to join the Armed Forces deliberately failed the medical as a favour.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 72–75</ref> Although Ayckbourn continued to move where his career took him, he settled in Scarborough, eventually buying Longwestgate House, the house formerly owned by [[Stephen Joseph]].<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 145–146</ref>

In 1957, Ayckbourn married Christine Roland, another member of the Library Theatre company,<ref name=20facts>[http://biography.alanayckbourn.net/BiographyFacts.htm 20 Facts about Alan Ayckbourn] accessed 5 January 2009</ref><ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 297–299</ref><ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 65–67</ref> and indeed Ayckbourn's first two plays were written jointly with her under the pseudonym of "Roland Allen".<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 67–72</ref> They had two sons, Steven and [[Philip Ayckbourn|Philip]].<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 69, 85</ref> However, the marriage had difficulties which eventually led to their separation in 1971. Alan Ayckbourn said that his relationship with Christine became easy once they agreed their marriage was over. Around this time, he started to share a home with Heather Stoney,<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 132</ref> an actress he had first met ten years earlier.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 88</ref> Like his mother, neither he nor Christine sought a divorce for the next thirty years and it was only in 1997 that they formally divorced; Ayckbourn married Heather Stoney.<ref name=20facts/><ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 297–298</ref> One side-effect of the timing is that, as Alan was awarded a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] a few months before the divorce,<ref name=knighted>P. Allen, 2001, p. 295</ref> both his first and second wife are entitled to take the title of Lady Ayckbourn.

In February 2006, he suffered a [[stroke]] in Scarborough, and stated: "I hope to be back on my feet, or should I say my left leg, as soon as possible, but I know it is going to take some time. In the meantime I am in excellent hands and so is the Stephen Joseph Theatre."<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.scarborougheveningnews.co.uk/news/Ayckbourn-has-stroke.1368917.jp |title='&#39;Scarborough Evening News'&#39;, 28 February 2006 |publisher=Scarborougheveningnews.co.uk |date= 28 February 2006 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> He left hospital after eight weeks and returned to directing after six months,<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Lawson |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2006/oct/04/theatre.health |title='&#39;The Guardian'&#39;, 4 October 2006 |publisher=Guardian |date= 4 October 2006|accessdate=2011-08-29 |location=London}}</ref> but the following year he announced he would step down as artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre.<ref name="BBC News, 4 June 2007">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/6720029.stm |title=BBC News, 4 June 2007 |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-06-04 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> Ayckbourn, however, continues to write and direct his own work at the theatre.

===Influence on plays===

Since Alan Ayckbourn's plays started becoming established in the West End, interviewers have raised the question of whether his work is autobiographical.<ref name=auto>P. Allen, 2001, p. 123</ref> There is no clear answer to this question. There has only been one biography, written by Paul Allen, and this primarily covers his career in the theatre.<ref name=biography/> Ayckbourn has frequently said he sees aspects of himself in all his characters. For example, in ''[[Bedroom Farce (play)|Bedroom Farce]]'' (1975), he admitted to being, in some respects, all four of the men in the play.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 155</ref> It has been suggested that, after Ayckbourn himself, the person who is used the most in his plays is his mother, particularly as Susan in ''[[Woman in Mind]]''<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 3</ref> (1985).

What is less clear is how much influence events in Ayckbourn's life have had on his writing. It is true that the theme of marriages in various difficulties was heavily present throughout his plays in the early seventies, around the time his own marriage was coming to an end. However, by this time, he had also witnessed the failures of his parents' relationships as well as those of some of his friends.<ref name=auto/> Which relationships, if any, he drew on for his plays, is unclear. In Paul Allen’s biography, Ayckbourn is briefly compared to Dafydd and Guy in ''[[A Chorus of Disapproval (play)|A Chorus of Disapproval]]'' (1984). Both characters feel themselves in trouble, and there was speculation that Alan Ayckbourn himself may have felt himself to be in trouble. At the time, he had reportedly become seriously involved with another actress, which threatened his relationship with Heather Stoney.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 209–210</ref> But again, it is unclear whether this had any effect on the writing, and Paul Allen's view is that it is not current experience that Ayckbourn uses for his plays.

It could be that Ayckbourn had written plays with himself and his own issues in mind, but as Ayckbourn is portrayed as a guarded and private man,<ref name=biography/> it is hard to imagine him exposing his own life in his plays to any great degree. In the biography, Paul Allen wrote, regarding a suggestion in ''Cosmopolitan'' that his plays were becoming autobiographical: "If we take that to mean that his plays tell his own life story, he still hasn't started."<ref name=auto/>

==Career==

===Early career and acting===

On leaving school his theatrical career started immediately, with an introduction to Sir [[Donald Wolfit]] by his French master.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 32</ref> Ayckbourn joined Wolfit on tour to the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] as an acting assistant stage manager (meaning a role that involved both acting and stage management) for three weeks,<ref name=webbio/><ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 36–38</ref> with his first role on the professional stage being various parts in ''The Strong are Lonely'' by [[Fritz Hochwälder]].<ref name=acting>{{cite web|url=http://biography.alanayckbourn.net/BiographyActing.htm |title=Acting career on official Ayckbourn site |publisher=Biography.alanayckbourn.net |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110723010505/http://biography.alanayckbourn.net/BiographyActing.htm| archivedate= 23 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In the following year, Ayckbourn appeared in six other plays at the Connaught Theatre, [[Worthing]],<ref name=webbio/><ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 38–40</ref> and the Thorndyke theatre, [[Leatherhead]].<ref name=webbio/><ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 41–43</ref>

In 1957, Ayckbourn was employed by the director [[Stephen Joseph]] at the Library Theatre, [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], the predecessor to the modern [[Stephen Joseph Theatre]].<ref name=webbio/><ref name=p41/> His role, again, was initially an acting stage manager.<ref name=webbio/><ref name=p41/> This employment led to Ayckbourn's first professional script commission, in 1958. When he complained about the quality of a script he was performing, Joseph challenged him to write a better one. The result was ''The Square Cat'', written under the pseudonym Roland Allen and first performed in 1959.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 65</ref> In this play, Ayckbourn himself played the character Jerry Watiss.<ref name=acting/>

After thirty-four appearances in plays at the Library Theatre, including four of his own, in 1962 Ayckbourn moved to [[Stoke-on-Trent]] to help set up the Victoria Theatre, (now the [[New Vic Theatre|New Vic]]),<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 87–88</ref> where he appeared in a further eighteen plays.<ref name=acting/> His final appearance in one of his own plays was as the Crimson Gollywog in the disastrous children's play ''Christmas v Mastermind''.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 90</ref> He left the Stoke company in 1964, officially to commit his time to the London production of ''Mr. Whatnot'', but reportedly because was having trouble working with the artistic director, [[Peter Cheeseman]].<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 98–99</ref> By now, his career as a writer was coming to fruition, and his acting career was sidelined.

His final role on stage was as Jerry in ''[[Two for the Seesaw]]'' by [[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson]], at the [[Rotherham Civic Theatre and Arts Centre|Civic Theatre]] in [[Rotherham]].<ref name=acting/> He was left stranded on stage because Heather Stoney was unable to re-appear because the props had been left unpacked, and this led him to decide acting was more trouble than it was worth.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 99–100</ref> The assistant stage manager on the production, [[Bill Kenwright]], would become one of the UK's most successful producers.

===Writing===

Alan Ayckbourn's earliest plays were written and produced at a time when the Scarborough Library theatre, like most regional theatres, regularly commissioned work from their own actors to keep costs down{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} (the other notable actor whose work was being commissioned being [[David Campton]]).<ref>[http://www.samuelfrench-london.co.uk/sf/Pages/feature/campton.html David Campton Feature] on Samuel French website</ref> His first play, ''The Square Cat'', was sufficiently popular locally to secure further commissions, but neither this nor the following three plays had any major impact outside of Scarborough.<ref>History of early plays on official Ayckbourn site [http://thesquarecat.alanayckbourn.net/SquareCatHistory.htm] [http://loveafterall.alanayckbourn.net/LoveAfterAllHistory.htm] [http://dadstale.alanayckbourn.net/DadsTaleHistory.htm] [http://standingroomonly.alanayckbourn.net/StandingRoomOnlyHistory.htm]</ref> But, after his transfer to [[New Vic Theatre|Victoria Theatre]] in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], there came ''Christmas v Mastermind'', which flopped and is now universally regarded as Ayckbourn's greatest disaster.<ref>[http://christmasvmastermind.alanayckbourn.net/ChristmasVMastermindHistory.htm ''Christmas v Mastermind'' history] on official Ayckbourn site.</ref><ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 89–90</ref>

His fortunes began to revive in 1963 with ''Mr. Whatnot'', again premièring at the Victoria Theatre. This was the first play that Ayckbourn was sufficiently happy with to allow performances today, and the first play to receive a [[West End theatre|West End]] performance. However, the West End production flopped, in part down to misguided casting.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 96, 101–102</ref><ref>[http://mrwhatnot.alanayckbourn.net/MrWhatnotHistory.htm ''Mr. Whatnot'' history] on official Ayckbourn site.</ref> After this, Ayckbourn experimented by collaborating with comedians, first writing a monologue for [[Tommy Cooper]], and later with [[Ronnie Barker]], who played Lord Slingsby-Craddock in the London production of ''Mr Whatnot'' in 1964, for the scripts of for [[London Weekend Television|LWT]]'s ''[[Hark at Barker]]''. Ayckbourn used the pseudonym 'Peter Caulfield' because he was under exclusive contract to the [[BBC]] at the time.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 108</ref>

Then, in 1965, back at the Scarborough Library Theatre, ''Meet my Father'' was produced, later retitled ''[[Relatively Speaking (play)|Relatively Speaking]]''. This time, the play was a massive success, both in Scarborough and the West End, making Alan Ayckbourn rich and earning him a congratulatory telegram from [[Noël Coward]].<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 109–113</ref><ref>[http://relativelyspeaking.alanayckbourn.net/RelativelySpeakingHistory.htm ''Relatively Speaking'' history] on official Ayckbourn site</ref> This was not quite the end of Ayckbourn's hit-and-miss record, because his following play, ''[[The Sparrow (1967 play)|The Sparrow]]'' only ran for three weeks at Scarborough.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 119</ref><ref>[http://thesparrow.alanayckbourn.net/TheSparrowHistory.htm ''The Sparrow'' history] on official Ayckbourn site</ref> However, the following play, ''How the Other Half Loves'', secured his runaway success as a playwright.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 122–123</ref><ref>[http://howtheotherhalfloves.alanayckbourn.net/HowTheOtherHalfLovesHistory.htm ''How the Other Half Loves'' history] on official Ayckbourn site</ref>

The height of Ayckbourn's commercial success included ''[[Absurd Person Singular]]'' (1975), ''[[The Norman Conquests]]'' trilogy (1973), ''[[Bedroom Farce (play)|Bedroom Farce]]'' (1975) and ''Just Between Ourselves'' (1976), all plays that focused heavily on marriage in the British middle classes. The only failure during this period was a 1975 musical with [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], ''[[Jeeves (musical)|Jeeves]]'', and even this did little to dent Ayckbourn's popularity.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 146–148</ref><ref>[http://jeeves.alanayckbourn.net/JeevesHistory.htm ''Jeeves'' history] on official Ayckbourn site</ref> Although his plays have received major West End productions almost from the beginning of his writing career, and hence have been reviewed in [[United Kingdom newspapers|British newspapers]], Ayckbourn's work was for years routinely dismissed as being too slight for serious study.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Recently, scholars have begun to view Ayckbourn as an important commentator on the lifestyles of the British [[suburb]]an [[middle class]], and as a stylistic innovator who experiments with theatrical styles within the boundaries set by popular tastes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

From the 1980s, Ayckbourn began to move away from the recurring themes of marriage and explore other contemporary themes, one example being ''[[Woman in Mind]]'', a play performed entirely from the perspective of a Woman going through a nervous breakdown.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 213–217</ref><ref>[http://womaninmind.alanayckbourn.net/WomanInMindHistory.htm ''Woman in Mind'' history] on official Ayckbourn site</ref> He also experimented with several more unconventional ways of writing plays, such as ''Intimate Exchanges'', which has one beginning and sixteen possible endings, and ''[[House & Garden (plays)|House & Garden]]'', where two plays take place simultaneously of two different stages, as well as diversifying into children's theatre (such as ''[[Mr A's Amazing Maze Plays]]'' and musical plays, such as ''[[By Jeeves]]'' (a more successful rewrite of the original ''Jeeves'').

With a résumé of over seventy plays, of which more than forty have played at the National Theatre or in the West End, Alan Ayckbourn is one of England’s most successful living playwrights. Despite his success, honours and awards (which include a prestigious [[Laurence Olivier Award]]), Alan Ayckbourn remains a relatively anonymous figure dedicated to regional theatre.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Gibson | first = Melissa | title = Alan Ayckbourn: Grinning at the Edge | journal = Theatre Journal | year = 2002 | url = http://links.jstor.org | accessdate = 2007-12-10 }}</ref> Throughout his writing career, all but four of his plays were premièred at the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre]] in Scarborough in its three different locations.<ref name=webbio/>

Alan Ayckbourn received the CBE in 1987<ref name=webbio/><ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 220</ref> and was knighted in 1997.<ref name=webbio/><ref name=knighted/> It is frequently claimed<ref>See, for example [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/alan-ayckbourn-you-ask-the-questions-586304.html] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/jul/06/1] [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/4550763/Alan-Ayckbourn-Why-my-shows-must-go-on.html]</ref> (but not proven)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biography.alanayckbourn.net/BiographyFAQPopularity.htm |title=FAQ popularity on Ayckbourn site |publisher=Biography.alanayckbourn.net |date=1983-11-02 |accessdate=2011-08-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110723010523/http://biography.alanayckbourn.net/BiographyFAQPopularity.htm| archivedate= 23 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> that Alan Ayckbourn is the most performed living English playwright, and the second most performed of all time after [[Shakespeare]].

Although Alan Ayckbourn's plays no longer dominate the theatrical scene on the scale of his earlier works, he continues to write, his most recent major success being ''[[Private Fears in Public Places]]'' that had a hugely successful [[Off-Broadway]] run, and in 2006 was made into a film ''[[Cœurs]]'', directed by [[Alain Resnais]].<ref>[http://privatefears.alanayckbourn.net/PrivateFearsInPublicPlacesHistory.htm ''Private Fears in Public Places'' history] on official Ayckbourn site</ref> After suffering a stroke, there was uncertainly as to whether he could continue to write<ref>{{cite web|last=Hudson |first=Lincoln |url=http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/inthepaper/2007/03/its-easier-to-return-to-directing-than-writing-say/ |title='&#39;The Stage'&#39;, 22 March 2007 |publisher=Blogs.thestage.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110720192153/http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/inthepaper/2007/03/its-easier-to-return-to-directing-than-writing-say/| archivedate= 20 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> (the Ayckbourn play premièred immediately after the stroke, ''[[If I Were You (play)|If I Were You]]'', was written before his illness), but his first play written afterwards, ''[[Life and Beth]]'', was premièred in the summer of 2008. Ayckbourn continues to write for the Stephen Joseph Theatre on invitation of his successor as artistic director, Chris Monks, with the first new play under this arrangement, ''[[My Wonderful Day]]'', performed in October 2009.<ref>[http://www.alanayckbourn.net/NewsCalender.htm News calendar] on official Ayckbourn site.</ref>

===Directing===

Although Alan Ayckbourn is best known as a writer, it is said that he only spends 10% of his time writing plays. Most of the rest of his time is spent directing.<ref name=10pc>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 84–85</ref>

Alan Ayckbourn began directing at the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre|Scarborough Library Theatre]] in 1961, with a production of ''[[Gas Light]]'' by [[Patrick Hamilton (dramatist)|Patrick Hamilton]].<ref name=10pc/><ref name=direct-early>{{cite web|url=http://directing.alanayckbourn.net/Plays%20-%20Library.htm |title=List of plays directed by Ayckbourn 1961–1976 |publisher=Directing.alanayckbourn.net |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110723011515/http://directing.alanayckbourn.net/Plays%20-%20Library.htm| archivedate= 23 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> He directed five other plays that year and the following year in Scarborough, and after transferring to the [[New Vic Theatre|Victoria Theatre]], directed a further six plays in 1963. Between 1964 and 1967 (when much of his time was taken up by various productions of his early successes ''Mr. Whatnot'' and ''[[Relatively Speaking (play)|Relatively Speaking]]'') he only directed one play (''[[The Sparrow (1967 play)|The Sparrow]]'', written by himself, later withdrawn), but in 1968 he resumed regularly directing plays, mostly at Scarborough.<ref name=direct-early/> At this time he also worked as a radio drama producer for the BBC, based in Leeds.

At first, his directing career was separate from his writing career. It was not until 1963 that Ayckbourn directed a play of his own (a revival of ''Standing Room Only''), 1967 that Ayckbourn directed a première of his own (''The Sparrow'').<ref name=direct-early/> The London premières remained in the hands of other directors for longer, with the first play of his both written and directed by him in London (''[[Bedroom Farce (play)|Bedroom Farce]]'') waiting until 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://directing.alanayckbourn.net/Plays%20-%20SJTITR.htm |title=List of plays directed by Ayckbourn 1976–1995 |publisher=Directing.alanayckbourn.net |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110723010448/http://directing.alanayckbourn.net/Plays%20-%20SJTITR.htm| archivedate= 23 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name=playguide>{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Allen|title=A Pocket Guide to Alan Ayckbourn's Plays|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=2004|isbn=0-571-21492-4}}</ref>

After the death of [[Stephen Joseph]] in 1967, the position of Director of Productions was appointed on an annual basis. Alan Ayckbourn was offered this position in 1969 and 1970, succeeding Rodney Wood, but he handed the position over to Caroline Smith in 1971 (having spent most of his time that year in the USA with ''How the Other Half Loves''). He became Director of Productions again in 1972, and this time, on 12 November that same year, he was made the permanent artistic director of the theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biography.alanayckbourn.net/BiographyAD.htm |title=Notes on Ayckbourn site on artistic director position |publisher=Biography.alanayckbourn.net |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110723010611/http://biography.alanayckbourn.net/BiographyAD.htm| archivedate= 23 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In mid-1986, Ayckbourn accepted an invitation to work as a visiting director for two years at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in London, form his own company, and perform a play in each of the three auditoria provided at least one was a new play of his own.<ref name=p219>P.

! Play number<ref group=nb>This numbering is the system used by the official Ayckbourn site as to how many plays have been written. This includes the full-length plays performed but later withdrawn and full-length plays for family audiences, but excludes revues and musical entertainments, adaptations of other plays, plays for children, individual one-act plays, "grey plays" (those written for performance but not publication) and plays for television. It also treats each of the plays in ''[[The Norman Conquests]]'', ''[[House & Garden (plays)|House and Garden]]'' and ''[[Damsels In Distress (plays)|Damsels in Distress]]'' as one play each, the one-acts from ''[[Confusions]]'' as a single full-length play, all variations of ''Intimate Exchanges'' as one play (likewise for ''Sisterly Feelings'' and ''It Could Be Any One Of Us''), both parts of ''[[The Revengers' Comedies]]'' as a single play, and the rewrites of ''Jeeves'' and ''Callisto 5'' as the same play as the original.
