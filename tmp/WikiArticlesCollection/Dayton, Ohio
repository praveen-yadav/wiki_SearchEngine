== History ==
Dayton was founded on April 1, 1796, seven years before the admission of Ohio to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in early 1803, by a group of 12 settlers known as "The Thompson Party." They traveled in March from [[Cincinnati]] up the [[Great Miami River]] by [[pirogue]] and landed at what is now St. Clair Street, where they found two small camps of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Among the settlers was Benjamin Van Cleve,<ref>{{cite book |title=Early Dayton |author=Robert W. Steele and Mary Davies Steele |year=1896 |publisher=W.J. Shuey |page=23}}</ref> whose memoirs provide insights into the history of the Ohio Valley. Two other groups who were travelling overland arrived several days later.<ref>{{cite book|title=An Outline of the History of Dayton, Ohio 1796–1896|editor=Board of Education|publisher=W.J. Shuey|year=1896|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/outlineofhistory00dayt/outlineofhistory00dayt_djvu.txt}}</ref>

In 1797, [[Daniel C. Cooper]] had laid out the [[Mad River Road]], the first overland connection between [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], and Dayton, opening the "Mad River Country" at Dayton and the upper Miami Valley to settlement.

The city was incorporated in 1805 and was named after [[Jonathan Dayton]], who owned the land. Dayton had been a captain in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and was a signer of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].<ref name="Brief History of Dayton">{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofdayton.org/cco/Pages/BriefHistory.aspx|title=Brief History of Dayton|accessdate=2011-08-22|publisher=City of Dalton}}</ref> By 1827, construction on the Dayton-Cincinnati canal began as a way to better transport goods from Dayton to Cincinnati. The canal provided the main source of growth for Dayton at the time.<ref name="Brief History of Dayton"/>

Historically, Dayton has been the site for many patents and inventions since the 1870s.<ref name="Dayton Inventions" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daytoncvb.com/helpful-resources/dayton-fast-facts-and-inventors/ |title=Fast facts and inventors|accessdate=3 September 2011|publisher=Dayton Montgomery County & Visitors Bureau|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110722025406/http://www.daytoncvb.com/helpful-resources/dayton-fast-facts-and-inventors/ <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref> Famous inventors such as the [[Wright brothers]], who invented the practical [[airplane]], and [[Charles F. Kettering]], who had numerous inventions, also came from Dayton. According to the [[National Park Service]], citing information from the [[U.S. Patent Office]], Dayton had more granted patents per capita than any other U.S. city in 1890 and ranked fifth in the nation as early as 1870.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/daav/introduction.htm|title=What Dreams We Have|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2009-03-09}}

The 1890s brought several key persons to the forefront of Dayton's historical achievements. The first, [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]] an African American poet, began his most famous works in the 1890s and is an integral part of Dayton's history. Dunbar became a nationally recognized poet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dunbarsite.org/biopld.asp|title=Paul Lawrence Dunbar Biography|accessdate=2011-08-25|publisher= University of Dayton}}</ref> The second were the [[Wright brothers]] who were credited for inventing the world's first successful airplane and founding the [[Wright Cycle Company]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/|title=Wright Brother Information|accessdate=2011-08-25|publisher=Smithsonian Institution: National Air and Space Museum Home}}</ref>

[[File:Dayton 1870.JPG|thumb|Dayton in 1870]]
In 1884, The [[National Cash Register Company]] was founded by [[John Henry Patterson (NCR owner)|John Henry Patterson]] which manufactured the first cash registers in existence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncr.com/about_ncr/company_overview/history.jsp|title=NCR historical timeline|publisher=National Cash Register|accessdate=2011-08-25}}</ref> The company played a crucial role in the success and shaping of Dayton as a manufacturing center and in the livelihood of Dayton residents as a source of employment and tax revenue. In 1906, [[Charles F. Kettering]] introduced the first electric cash register to the company. This helped to further increase the presence and production of NCR.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/NCR-Corporation-Company-History.html|title=NCR history information|publisher=Funding Universe|accessdate=2011-08-25}}</ref> After the Great Dayton Flood, John Patterson donated nearly one million dollars to help with cleanup and rescue efforts. This move helped to further draw the importance of the company to Dayton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=296|title=John H Patterson |accessdate=2011-08-25|publisher=Ohio History central}}</ref> NCR was also known for its code-breaking machines, including the American [[Bombe#US Navy Bombe|Navy bombe]] designed by [[Joseph Desch]] which helped crack the [[Enigma machine]] cipher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daytonhistory.org/archives/codebreaker.htm|title=NCR WWII Code breaking machines|accessdate=2011-08-25|publisher=The Archive Centre}}</ref>

The catastrophic [[Great Dayton Flood]] of March 1913 severely affected much of the city, stimulated the growth of suburban communities outside central Dayton in areas lying further from the Miami River and on higher ground, and led to the establishment of the [[Miami Conservancy District]] in 1914.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiconservancy.org/flood/index.asp|title= Flood Protection|accessdate=2011-08-25|publisher=Miami Conservancy District}}</ref> The flood remains an event of note in popular memory and local histories. The high waters damaged some of the Wright brothers' glass plate photographic negatives of their glider flights at Kitty Hawk and power flights over [[Huffman Prairie]] near Dayton.

During World War II, Dayton, like many other American cities, was heavily involved in the war effort. Residential neighborhoods in Dayton and in nearby Oakwood hosted the [[Dayton Project]], in which the [[Monsanto|Monsanto Chemical Company]] developed methods to industrially produce [[polonium]] for use in the triggers of early atomic bombs, including those dropped by the United States on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/index.php?id=83&option=com_content&task=view|title=The Dayton Project|accessdate=2011-08-25|publisher=Atomic Heritage}}</ref> Because of Dayton's manufacturing boom to support war efforts, housing in the Dayton area was in extremely high demand. In an attempt for the region to keep up, emergency housing was put into place because of a lack of dwellings in the region. Many of these dwellings that were meant to be temporary are still inhabited today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daytonology.blogspot.com/2008/11/world-war-ii-housing-daytonfairborn.html|title=WWII Emergency Housing|accessdate=2011-08-25|publisher=Daytonology Blogspot}}</ref>

Between the 1940s and the 1970s, significant suburban growth began to take place. Along with the implementation of the [[Interstate Highway System]], more than 127,000 homes were built in Montgomery County alone between 1950 and 1960. Many of these homes were built in neighboring suburbs as growth in the city proper of Dayton slowed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbadayton.com/site/publisher/files/ohio_modern.pdf|title=Dayton Modern History|accessdate=2011-08-25|publisher=Ohio Historical Society}}</ref> Despite Dayton's slowed growth, many of Dayton's high-rise buildings were also constructed during this period.

From the 1980s to recent times, Dayton's population has declined due to the drop in heavy [[manufacturing]] and national economic woes. Despite this, Dayton has diversified its workforce from manufacturing to [[healthcare]] and defense.  It is recognized as Ohio's [[aerospace]] hub.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gdaha.org/advocacy|title=Advocacy|accessdate=2011-08-25|publisher=Greater Dayton Area Hospital Association}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daytontechtown.com/Technology/AerospaceHub|title=Dayton Recognized as Ohio's Aerospace Hub|accessdate=2011-08-25|publisher=Tech Town}}</ref>

The 2000s brought revitalization to Dayton's urban core. [[Fifth Third Field (Dayton)|Fifth Third Field]], home of the [[Dayton Dragons]], was built in 2000. The stadium and minor league baseball team have been an important part of Dayton's culture.  The Dragons have the nation's longest sellout streak in all professional sports, and they remain very popular in the region.<ref name=DragonsSellout>{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110710&content_id=21677950&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb|title=Dayton Dragons all time professional sellout streak MLB|publisher=MLB Advanced Media}}</ref> The [[Schuster Center]] performing arts theater, which opened in 2003, provides a new arts venue for the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schustercenter.org/about/historical.html|title=About the Schuster Center|accessdate=2011-08-25|publisher=Schuster Center|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110208175515/http://schustercenter.org/about/historical.html|archivedate=2012-11-24}}</ref> [[Miami Valley Hospital]] added a 12-story patient tower.

In 2010, the Downtown Dayton Partnership, in cooperation with the City of Dayton and community leaders, introduced the Greater Downtown Dayton Plan. It focuses on job creation and retention, infrastructure improvements, housing, recreation, and collaboration. The plan is to be implemented through the year 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.downtowndayton.org/plan/pdfs/priorityrecs_overview.pdf|title=The Greater Downtown Dayton Plan|accessdate=2011-08-25|publisher=}}</ref>

=== Peace accords ===
{{Main|Dayton Agreement}}
The [[Dayton Agreement]], a peace accord between the parties to the hostilities of the [[Yugoslav wars|conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the former Yugoslavia]], was negotiated at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]]. Negotiations took place from November 1, 1995, to November 21, 1995, at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], near Fairborn, Ohio.

[[Richard Holbrooke]] wrote about this event in his memoirs:
<blockquote> There was also a real Dayton out there, a charming Ohio city, famous as the birthplace of the [[Wright brothers|Wright Brothers]].<!-- Not a proper name; should be "Wright brothers". Preserved Holbrooke's capitalization usage in quote. --> Its citizens energized us from the outset. Unlike the population of, say, [[New York City|New York]], [[Geneva]] or [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], which would scarcely notice another conference, Daytonians were proud to be part of history. Large signs at the commercial airport hailed Dayton as the "temporary center of international peace". The local newspapers and television stations covered the story from every angle, drawing the people deeper into the proceedings. When we ventured into a restaurant or a shopping center downtown, people crowded around, saying that they were praying for us. [[Warren Christopher]] was given at least one standing ovation in a restaurant. Families on the air base placed "candles of peace" in their front windows, and people gathered in peace vigils outside the base. One day they formed a "peace chain", although it was not large enough to surround the sprawling eight-thousand-acre base. Ohio's famous ethnic diversity was on display.<ref>[[Richard Holbrooke]], ''To End a War'', p. 234</ref></blockquote>

=== Nickname ===
Dayton is known as the "Gem City." The origin of the nickname is uncertain, but several theories exist. In the early 19th century, a well-known [[racehorse]] named "Gem" hailed from Dayton. In 1845, an article published in the ''Cincinnati Daily Chronicle'' by an author known as "T" stated: 
:"In a small bend of the Great Miami River, with canals on the east and south, it can be fairly said, without infringing on the rights of others, that Dayton is the gem of all our interior towns. It possesses wealth, refinement, enterprise, and a beautiful country, beautifully developed."<ref name="Dayton FAQs">{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.dayton.oh.us/Public_Affairs/faq.asp |title=City of Dayton FAQ's |accessdate=2007-07-23|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070701001047/http://www.ci.dayton.oh.us/Public_Affairs/faq.asp |archivedate = July 1, 2007|deadurl=yes|publisher=}}</ref>
[[File:SacredHeartChurchDayton.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|Historic Sacred Heart Church]]

In the late 1840s, Major William D. Bickham of the ''Dayton Journal'' initiated a campaign to officially nickname Dayton as the "Gem City". The name was eventually adopted by the city's Board of Trade several years later.<ref name="Dayton FAQs" /> [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]] referred to the nickname in his poem, "Toast to Dayton", as noted in the following excerpt:
<blockquote><poem>
She shall ever claim our duty,
For she shines--the brightest gem
That has ever decked with beauty
     Dear Ohio's diadem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dunbarsite.org/gallery/AToasttoDayton.asp|title=Toast to Dayton|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}</ref>
</poem></blockquote>

Dayton also plays a role in a nickname given to the state of Ohio – "Birthplace of Aviation". Dayton is the hometown of the [[Wright brothers]], aviation pioneers who are credited with inventing and building the world's first successful [[airplane]]. After their first manned flights in [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina]], which had been chosen due to its ideal weather and climate conditions, the Wrights returned to Dayton and continued testing at nearby [[Huffman Prairie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/fly/1904/index.cfm|title= The Wright Brothers | publisher= Smithsonian Air and Space Museum|accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref>

== Geography ==

== Government ==
The Dayton City Commission is composed of the Mayor and four City Commissioners. Each City Commission member is elected at-large on a non-partisan basis for four-year, overlapping terms. All policy items are decided by the City Commission, which is empowered by the City Charter to pass ordinances and resolutions, adopt regulations and appoint the City Manager. The City Manager is responsible for budgeting and implementing policies and initiatives. Dayton was the first large American city to adopt the city manager form of municipal government, in 1913.<ref>City Commission. http://www.daytonohio.gov Retrieved 2013-08-30</ref>

== Cityscape ==
[[File:DaytonView.jpg|thumb|center|800px|<center>Panorama of Dayton]]<center/>

=== Architecture ===
{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Dayton|National Register of Historic Places listings in Dayton, Ohio}}
Unlike many [[midwest]]ern cities of its age, Dayton has very broad and straight downtown streets (generally two or three full lanes in each direction), facilitating access to the downtown even after the automobile became popular. The main reason for the broad streets was that Dayton was a marketing and shipping center from its beginning: streets were broad to enable wagons drawn by teams of three to four pairs of oxen to turn around. In addition, some of today's streets were once barge canals flanked by draw-paths.
[[File:MutualHomeSavingsBuilding.jpg|thumbnail|180px|Right|Mutual Home Savings Building]]
A courthouse building was constructed in downtown Dayton in 1888 to supplement Dayton's original [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] courthouse, which still stands. This second, "new" courthouse has since been replaced with new facilities as well as a park. The Old Court House has been a favored political campaign stop.
