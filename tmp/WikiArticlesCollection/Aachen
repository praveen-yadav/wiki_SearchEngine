'''Aachen''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʔaːxən|-|De-Aachen-2.ogg}}), also known as '''Bad Aachen''' ([[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]]: ''Óche'', [[Limburgish]]: ''Aoke'', French: ''Aix-La-Chapelle'', [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Aquisgrana'', Dutch: ''Aken'', Spanish: ''Aquisgrán'', [[Latin]]: ''Aquisgranum'') is a [[spa town]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany. Sometimes in English (especially in old use), the city is referred to as '''Aix-la-Chapelle''' ({{IPA-fr|ɛkslaʃapɛl}}). Aachen was a favoured residence of [[Charlemagne]], and later the place of coronation of the [[List of German monarchs|German kings]].

==History==
{{see also|Free Imperial City of Aachen}}
[[File:Aachen1566.jpg|thumb|right|Medieval architecture can be found in Aachen.]]
[[File:Construction d Aix-la-Chapelle.jpg|thumb|right|Construction of Aix-la-Chapelle, by [[Jean Fouquet]].]]

===Early history===
Flint quarries on the [[Lousberg]], Schneeberg, and Königshügel, first used during [[Neolithic]] times (3,000-2,500 {{smallcaps|b}}.{{smallcaps|c}}.), attest to the long occupation of the site of Aachen, as do recent finds under the modern city's ''Elisengarten'' pointing to a former settlement from the same period. [[Bronze Age]] (''ca''. 1600 {{smallcaps|b}}.{{smallcaps|c}}.) settlement is evidenced by the remains of barrows (burial mounds) found, for example, on the Klausberg. During the [[Iron Age]], the area was settled by Celtic peoples<ref>Schumacher, Wolfgang (2009)</ref> who were perhaps drawn by the marshy Aachen basin's [[hot spring|hot sulphur springs]] where they worshiped [[Grannus]], god of light and healing.

Later, the 25-hectare Roman spa resort town of ''Aquae Granni'' was, according to legend, founded by Grenus, under [[Hadrian]], in ''ca''. {{smallcaps|a}}.{{smallcaps|d}}. 124. Instead, the fictitious founder refers to the Celtic god, and it seems it was the Roman 6th Legion at the start of the 1st century that first channelled the hot springs into a spa at Büchel,{{refn| group = nb |This audio file is Andreas Schaub explaining the archaeological record in court in ''Archäologie am Hof''.<ref name=CVDE/><ref>Schaub, Andreas (2013)</ref>}} adding at the end of the same century the ''Münstertherme'' spa,<ref>www.archaeologie-aachen.de (2013)</ref> two water pipelines, and a likely sanctuary dedicated to Grannus. A kind of forum, surrounded by colonnades, connected the two spa complexes. There was also an extensive residential area. The Romans built bathhouses near [[Burtscheid]]. A temple precinct called ''Vernenum'' was built near the modern [[Kornelimünster/Walheim]]. Today, all that remains are two fountains in the ''Elisenbrunnen'' and the Burtscheid bathhouse.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Roman civil administration fell apart in Aachen between the end of the 4th and beginning of the 5th centuries. Rome withdrew its troops from the area but the town remained populated. By 470, the town came to be ruled by the [[Ripuarian Franks]]<ref name=Coll>Held, Colbert C. (1997)</ref> and subordinated to their capital, [[Cologne]].

===The Middle Ages===
After Roman times, [[Pepin the Short|Pippin the Younger]] had a castle residence built in the town, and [[Einhard]] mentions that in 765–6 [[Pepin the Short|Pippin]] spent both Christmas and Easter at ''Aquis villa'' ("{{lang|la|Et celebravit natalem Domini in Aquis villa et pascha similiter.}}"),<ref>Eginhard (2012)</ref> which must have been sufficiently equipped to support the royal household for several months. In the year of his coronation as King of Franks, 768, [[Charlemagne]] came to spend [[Christmas]] at Aachen for the first time. This is in dispute, as some history books state that Charlemagne was in fact born in Aachen in 742.<ref name=WB/> He went on to remain there in a [[Palace of Aachen|mansion]] which he may have extended, although there is no source attesting to any significant building activity at Aachen in his time, apart from the building of the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]] (since 1929, cathedral) and the palatial presentation halls. Charlemagne spent most winters in Aachen between 792 and his death in 814. Aachen became the focus of his court and the political centre of his empire. After his death, the king was buried in the church which he had built; his original tomb has been lost, while his alleged remains are preserved in the shrine where he was reburied after being declared a saint; his saintliness, however, was never very widely acknowledged outside the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège|bishopric of Liège]] where he may still be venerated by tradition.<ref name=CVDE/>

In 936, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] was crowned king of the kingdom in the collegiate church built by Charlemagne. While [[Otto II]] ruled, the nobles revolted and the [[West Francia|West Frank]]s raided Aachen in the ensuing confusion.<ref>Kitchen Martin (1996); p. 35</ref> Aachen was attacked again, this time by [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Odo of Champagne]] who attacked the imperial palace while [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad]] was absent. He relinquished it quickly and was killed soon thereafter.<ref>Kitchen, Martin (1996); p. 40</ref> Over the next 500 years, most [[List of German monarchs|kings of Germany]] destined to reign over the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were crowned in Aachen. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] was not crowned in Aachen after his father [[John of Bohemia|John]] dies in battle, due to Aachen siding with [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Ludwig]], in a dispute dating back twenty years. So he was crowned in [[Bonn]].<ref>Kitchen, Martin (1996); p. 69</ref> The last king to be crowned here was [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in 1531.<ref name=CVDE/><ref name=AAE/> During the [[Middle Ages]], Aachen remained a city of regional importance, due to its proximity to [[Flanders]], achieving a modest position in the trade in [[wool]]len cloths, favoured by imperial privilege. The city remained a [[Free imperial city|Free Imperial City]], subject to the Emperor only, but was politically far too weak to influence the policies of any of its neighbours. The only dominion it had was over [[Burtscheid]], a neighbouring territory ruled by a [[Benedictine]] [[abbess]]. It was forced to accept that all of its traffic must pass through the "Aachener Reich". Even in the late 18th century the Abbess of Burtscheid was prevented from building a road linking her territory to the neighbouring estates of the [[Duchy of Jülich|duke of Jülich]]; the city of Aachen even deployed its handful of soldiers to chase away the road-diggers.

===16th through 18th Centuries===

As an imperial city, Aachen held certain political advantages that allowed it to remain independent of the troubles of Europe for many years. It remained a direct vassal of the Holy Roman Empire throughout most of the Middle Ages. It also was the site of many important church councils. These included the [[Council of 836]], and the [[Council of 1166]], a council convened by the [[antipope]] [[Paschal III]].<ref name=EA/> In 1598, following the invasion of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] troops from the [[Netherlands]], [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf]], deposed all Protestant office holders in Aachen and even went as far as expelling them from the city.<ref>Holbor, Hajo (1982); p. 295</ref> From the early 16th century, Aachen started losing its power and influence. It started with the crowning of emperors occurring not in Aachen but in [[Frankfurt]], followed by the religious wars, and the great fire of 1656.<ref name="eb">Encyclopædia Britannica Online (2006)</ref> It then culminated in 1794, when the French, led by General [[Charles Dumouriez]],<ref name=Coll/> occupied Aachen.<ref name=AAE/>

Aachen became attractive as a spa by the middle of the 17th century, not so much because of the effects of the hot springs on the health of its visitors but because Aachen was then — and remained well into the 19th century — a place of high-level [[prostitution]] in Europe. Traces of this hidden agenda of the city's history is found in the 18th-century guidebooks to Aachen as well as to the other spas; the main indication for visiting patients, ironically, was [[syphilis]]; only by the end of the 19th century had rheuma become the most important object of cures at Aachen and Burtscheid. Aachen was chosen as the site of several important congresses and peace treaties: the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|first congress of Aachen]] (often referred to as ''Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle'' in English) in 1668, leading to the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|First Treaty of Aachen]] in the same year which ended the [[War of Devolution]].<ref>Holborn, Hajo (1982(a)) p. 70</ref> The [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|second congress]] ended with the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|second treaty]] in 1748, finishing the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].<ref name=CVDE/><ref>Holborn, Hajo (1982(a)); p. 217</ref> In 1789, there was a constitutional crisis within the Aachen government.<ref>Wilson, Peter H. (2004); p. 301</ref>

===The 19th century===

On 9 Feb. 1801, the [[Peace of Luneville]] removed the ownership of Aachen and the entire "left bank" of the Rhine from Germany and granted it to France.<ref name=Coll/> In 1815, control of the town was passed to [[Prussia]], by an act that was passed by the [[Congress of Vienna]].<ref name=AAE/> The [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|third congress]] took place in 1818 to decide the fate of occupied [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]ic France.

By the middle of the 19th century, industrialisation swept away most of the city's medieval rules of production and commerce, although the entirely corrupt remains of the city's medieval constitution was kept in place (compare the famous remarks of Georg Forster in his ''Ansichten vom Niederrhein'') until 1801, when Aachen became the "[[Prefectures in France|chef-lieu]] du [[Roer (department)|département de la Roer]]" in Napoleon's [[First French Empire]]. In 1815 after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] took over and the city became one of its most socially and politically backward centres until the end of the 19th century.<ref name=CVDE/> Administered within the [[Rhine Province]], by 1880 the population was 80,000. Starting in 1838, the [[rail transport|railway]] from [[Cologne]] to [[Belgium]] passed through Aachen.<ref>Holborn ?Hajo (1982(b)); p. 11</ref> The city suffered extreme overcrowding and deplorable sanitary conditions up to 1875 when the medieval fortifications were finally abandoned as a limit to building operations and new, less miserable quarters were built in the eastern part of the city, where drainage of waste liquids was easiest. In December 1880, the [[Trams in Aachen|Aachen tramway network]] was opened, and in 1895 it was electrified.<ref>Van der Gragt, F. (1968)</ref> In the 19th century and up to the 1930s, the city was important for the production of railway locomotives and carriages, [[iron]], [[pin]]s, [[sewing needle|needles]], [[button]]s, [[tobacco]], woollen goods, and [[silk]] goods.

===The 20th century===

After [[World War I]], Aachen was occupied by the Allies until 1930.<ref name=AAE/> Aachen was one of the locations involved in the ill-fated [[Rhenish Republic]]. On October 21, 1923 an armed band took over city hall. Similar actions took place in [[Munchen-Gladbach]], [[Duisburg]], and [[Krefeld]]. This Republic lasted only about a year.<ref>Holborn, Hajo (1982(b)); p. 614</ref> Aachen was heavily damaged during [[World War II]]. The city and its fortified surroundings were encircled 13 September–16 October 1944 by the US 1st Infantry Division and 3rd Armored Division in conjunction with the US 2nd Armored Division and 30th Infantry Division during the prolonged [[Battle of Aachen]], later reinforced by US 28th Infantry Division elements. Direct assaults through the heavily defended city finally forced the German garrison to surrender on 21 October 1944.<ref>Stanton, Shelby (2006)</ref> Aachen was the first German city to be captured by the Allies, and its residents welcomed the soldiers as liberators.<ref name="baker2004">Baker, Anni P. (2004)</ref> The city was destroyed partially — and in some parts completely — during the fighting,<ref name=CVDE/> mostly by [[United States Army|American]] [[artillery]] fire and demolitions carried out by the [[Waffen-SS]] defenders. Damaged buildings included the medieval churches of [[Foillan|St. Foillan]], [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] and [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]], and the [[Aachen Rathaus|Rathaus]] (city hall), although [[Aachen Cathedral]] was largely unscathed. Only 4,000 inhabitants remained in the city; the rest had followed evacuation orders. Its first Allied-appointed mayor, [[Franz Oppenhoff]], was murdered by an SS commando unit.

The [[Palace of Aachen|emperor's palace]] no longer exists.{{when|reason=when was it destroyed?|date=October 2013}}

== Geography ==
Aachen lies on the [[tripoint]] of Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium in the middle of the [[Meuse–Rhine Euroregion]], which contains an open valley basin and includes tributaries of the [[Wurm]] and the [[Rur]] rivers. The city is located in the basin of the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]], directly on the northern edge of the [[Eifel]] region of the [[Rhenish Massif]], about {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=off}} north of the [[High Fens]].

The highest point of Aachen measures 410 m [[Normalnull]] (NN) and lies in the far southeast of the city. The lowest point is 125 m NN and is located in the north, on the border with the Netherlands. The length of the city border is {{convert|87.7|km|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|23.8|km|1|abbr=on}} of which border Belgium and {{convert|21.8|km|1|abbr=on}} border the Netherlands. From north to south, the city is {{convert|21.6|km|1|abbr=on}} at its widest, and from east to west, it is {{convert|17.2|km|1|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

=== Climate ===
As the westernmost city in Germany (and close to the Low Countries), Aachen and the surrounding area belongs to a [[Temperate climate|temperate climate zone]], with humid weather, mild winters, and warm summers. Because of its location north of the [[Eifel]] and the [[High Fens]] and its subsequent prevailing westerly weather patterns, rainfall in Aachen (on average 805&nbsp;mm/year) is comparatively higher than, for example, [[Bonn]] (with 669&nbsp;mm/year). Another factor in the local weather forces of Aachen is the occurrence of [[Foehn winds]] on the southerly air currents, which results from the city's geographic location on the northern edge of the Eifel.<ref name="foehn">www.wetter-deutschland.com (2013)</ref>

Because the city is surrounded by hills, it suffers from [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion-related]] [[smog]]. Some areas of the city have become [[Urban heat island]]s as a result of poor heat exchange, both because of the area's natural geography, as well as from human activity. The city's numerous cold air corridors, which are slated to remain as free as possible from new construction, therefore plays an important role in the urban climate of Aachen.<ref>Aachen Department of Environmental (2013)</ref>

The January average is 
{{convert|3.0|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while the July average is {{convert|18.5|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Precipitation is almost evenly spread throughout the year.

== Geology ==
[[File:Aachen Felsen St.Adalbert.JPG|thumb|layered [[sandstone]] and [[claystone]] [[formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] from the [[Devonian]] period below St. Adalbert Church in Aachen]]

The geology of Aachen is very structurally heterogeneous. The oldest occurring rocks in the area surrounding the city originate from the [[Devonian]] period and include [[carboniferous]] [[sandstone]], [[Graywacke]], [[claystone]] and [[limestone]]. These formations are part of the [[Rhenish Massif]], north of the High Fens. In the [[Pennsylvanian]] subperiod of the [[Carboniferous]] geological period, these rock layers were narrowed and folded as a result of the [[Variscan orogeny]]. After this event, and over the course of the following 200 million years, this area has been continuously flattened.{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Ernest Masson|editor1-last= Healy|editor1-first=David|year= 2012|title=Faulting, Fracturing and Igneous Intrusion in the Earth's Crust|issue=367|volume=367|publisher=Geological Society of London|isbn=1862393478|issn=0305-8719}}

During the [[Cretaceous]] period, the ocean penetrated the continent from the direction of the [[North Sea]] up to the mountainous area near Aachen, bringing with it clay, sand, and chalk deposits. While the clay (which was the basis for a major [[pottery]] industry in nearby [[Raeren]]) is mostly found in the lower areas of Aachen, the hills of the [[Aachen Forest]] and the [[Lousberg]] were formed from upper Cretaceous sand and chalk deposits. More recent sedimentation are mainly located in the north and east of Aachen and were formed through [[tertiary]] and [[quarternary]] river and wind activities.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Along the major [[thrust fault]] of the [[Variscan orogeny]], there are over 30 [[thermal spring]]s in Aachen and [[Burtscheid]]. Additionally, the subsurface of Aachen is traversed by numerous active faults that belong to the Rurgraben fault system, which has, in the past, been responsible for numerous [[earthquake]]s, including the 1756 [[Düren]] Earthquake<ref name="duerenEQ">University of Cologne, Seismological Station Bensberg (2013)</ref> and the [[1992 Roermond earthquake]],<ref name="Roermond">Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia (2013)</ref> which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in the [[Netherlands]].

=== Boroughs ===
The city is divided into seven administrative districts, or boroughs, each with its own district council, district leader, and district authority.

[[File:GermanyNetherlansBelgiumBORDER.jpg|thumb|German–[[Netherlands|Dutch]]–[[Belgium|Belgian]] border as seen from the town area]]
[[Aachen Cathedral]] was erected on the orders of [[Charlemagne]] in AD 796<ref name=EA/> and was, on completion, the largest cathedral north of the [[Alps]]. It was modelled after the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], in [[Ravenna]], [[Italy]],<ref name=AAE/> and was built by [[Odo of Metz]].<ref name=EA/> On his death, Charlemagne's remains were interred in the cathedral and can be seen there to this day. The cathedral was extended several times in later ages, turning it into a curious and unique mixture of building styles. For 600 years, from 936 to 1531, Aachen Cathedral was the church of coronation for 30 German kings and 12 queens. The church built by Charlemagne is still the main attraction of the city.<ref>www.aachen.de (2013)</ref> In addition to holding the remains of its founder, it became the burial place of his successor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]. Aachen Cathedral has been designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

The [[Aachen Rathaus|city hall]], dated from 1330,<ref name=WB>Merkl, Peter H. (2007)</ref> lies between two central places, the ''Markt'' (market place) and the ''Katschhof'' (between city hall and cathedral). The coronation hall is on the first floor of the building. Inside you can find five frescoes by the Aachen artist Alfred Rethel which show legendary scenes from the life of Charlemagne, as well as Charlemagne's signature. It also contains the hall of the emperors.<ref name=EB>Hoiber, Dale H. (2010)</ref>

The ''Grashaus'', a late medieval house at the Fisch Markt, is one of the oldest non-religious buildings in downtown Aachen. It hosts the city archive. The Grashaus was the former city hall before the present building took over this function.

The ''Elisenbrunnen'' is one of the most famous sights of Aachen. It is a neo-classical hall covering one of the city's famous fountains. It is just a minute away from the cathedral. Just a few steps in south-eastern direction lies the 19th-century [[Theater Aachen|theatre]].

Also of note are two remaining city gates, the ''[[Ponttor]]'', one half-mile northwest of the cathedral, and the ''Kleinmarschiertor'', close to the central railway station. There are also a few parts of both medieval city walls left, most of them integrated into more recent buildings, but some others still visible. There are even five towers left, some of which are used for housing.

[[St. Michael's Church, Aachen]] was built as a church of the Aachen Jesuit Collegium in 1628. It is attributed to the Rhine mannerism and a sample of a local Renaissance-architecture. The rich façade remained unfinished until 1891 when the historistic architect Peter Friedrich Peters added to it. The church is a Greek Orthodox church today, but the building is used also for concerts because of its good acoustics.

The Jewish [[synagogue]] in Aachen which was destroyed at the [[Night of Broken Glass]] ([[Kristallnacht]]) on 9 November 1938, was reinaugurated on 18 May 1995.<ref>American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise (2013)</ref><ref>Knufinke, Ulrich (2013)</ref> One of the contributors for the reconstructions of the synagogue was [[Jürgen Linden]], the Lord Mayor of Aachen from 1989 to 2009. On 30 March 2011, it was reported that a swastika was spray-painted on a wall of the synagogue at Aachen, as an [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] act.<ref>Schmetz, Oliver (2011)</ref>{{clr}}

There are numerous other notable [[church (building)|church]]es and [[monastery|monasteries]], a few remarkable 17th- and 18th-century buildings in the particular Baroque style typical of the region, a Jewish [[synagogue]], a collection of statues and monuments, park areas, cemeteries, among others. Among the museums in the town are the [[Suermondt-Ludwig Museum]], which has a fine sculpture collection and the [[Aachen Museum of the International Press]], which is dedicated to newspapers from the 16th century to the present.<ref name=EB/> The area's industrial history is reflected in dozens of 19th- and early 20th-century manufacturing sites in the city.

==Economy==
[[File:Aachen Ford-Entwicklungszentrum.jpg|thumb|[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] Research Center, Aachen.]]
There have been a number of spin-offs from the university's [[Information technology|IT]] technology department.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Aachen was the administrative centre for the coal-mining industries in neighbouring places to the northeast.

Products manufactured in or around{{clarify|reason=don't want "around." Want stuff that is in the city. If there is a metro article, "around" can go there|date=October 2013}} Aachen include electronics, chemicals, plastics, machinery, furniture, metal products, textiles, glass, cosmetics, rubber products, foodstuffs (chocolate and candy), and needles and pins.<ref name=AAE>Ranson, K. Anne (1998)</ref><ref name=Cohen/> Though once a major player in Aachen's economy, today glassware and textile production make up only 10% of total manufacturing jobs in the city.<ref name="name" />

==Culture==
[[File:Aachen Rosenmontag 2009.jpg|thumb|Aachen is also famous for its [[carnival]] (Karneval, Fasching), in which families dress in colorful costumes.]]
In 1372, Aachen became the first coin-minting city in the world to regularly place an [[Anno Domini]] date on a general circulation [[coin]], a [[groschen]].

The [[Scotch-Club]] in Aachen was the first [[discothèque]]; it has been open since 19 October 1959. Klaus Quirini as DJ Heinrich was the first DJ ever.

The local specialty of Aachen is an originally hard type of sweet bread, baked in large flat loaves, called ''[[Aachener Printen]]''. Unlike [[gingerbread]] (''{{lang-de|[[Lebkuchen]]}}''), which is sweetened with honey, ''Printen'' are sweetened with sugar. Today, a soft version is sold under the same name which follows an entirely different recipe.

==Education==
[[File:Aachen RWTH Hauptgebaeude.jpg|thumb|The main building of RWTH Aachen University|right]]
[[File:Aachen-ElegantStreet.JPG|thumb|Typical Aachen street with early 20th-century [[Gründerzeit]] houses|right]]
[[RWTH Aachen|RWTH Aachen University]], established as Polytechnicum in 1870, is one of the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative|Germany's Universities of Excellence]] with strong emphasis on technological research, especially for electrical and mechanical engineering, computer sciences, physics, and chemistry. The university clinics attached to the RWTH, the [[Klinikum Aachen]], is the biggest single-building hospital in Europe.<ref>Aachen Institute for Advanced Study in Computational Engineering Science (2009)</ref> Over time, a host of software and computer industries have developed around the university. It also maintains a [[botanical garden]] (the [[Botanischer Garten Aachen]]).

[[FH Aachen]], [[Aachen University of Applied Sciences]] (AcUAS) was founded in 1971. The AcUAS offers a classic engineering education in professions like Mechatronics, Construction Engineering, Mechanical Engineering or Electrical Engineering. German and international students are educated in more than 20 international or foreign-oriented programs and can acquire German as well as international degrees (Bachelor/Master) or Doppeldiplome (double degrees). Foreign students account for more than 21% of the student body.

The [[German Army]]'s Technical School (''Technische Schule des Heeres und Fachschule des Heeres für Technik'') is in Aachen.<ref name="MeerOpitz1998">Van der Meer, Willemina; Richter, Elisabeth; Opitz, Helmut (1998); p. 718</ref>

==Sports==
The annual CHIO (short for the French term ''Concours Hippique International Officiel'') is the biggest [[equestrianism|equestrian]] meeting of the world and among horsemen considered to be as prestigious for equitation as the tournament of [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] for tennis. Aachen hosted the [[2006 FEI World Equestrian Games]] and [[2011 CHIO Aachen]].
[[File:Aachen Tivoli under construction.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[New Tivoli]], home ground of [[Alemannia Aachen]].]] 
The local [[Association football|football]] team [[Alemannia Aachen]] had a short run-out in Germany's [[Fußball-Bundesliga|first division]], after its promotion in 2006. However, the team could not sustain its status and is now back in the fourth division. The stadium [[Old Tivoli|"Tivoli"]], opened in 1928, served as the venue for the team's home games and was well known for its incomparable atmosphere throughout the whole of the second division.<ref name="GdawietzLeroi2007">Gdawietz, Gregor; Leroi, Roland (2008); p. 28</ref> Before the old stadium's demolition in 2011, it was used by amateurs, whilst the Bundesliga Club held its games in the new stadium "Neuer Tivoli" – meaning [[New Tivoli]]- a couple of metres down the road. The building work for the stadium which has a capacity of 32.960, began in May 2008 and was completed by the beginning of 2009.

The city's biggest tennis club, "TC Grün Weiss", annually hosts the ATP Tournament.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Transport==
[[File:OecherLongWajong1.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Bi-articulated bus]] [[Van Hool]] [[Van Hool AGG300|newAGG300]] from ASEAG at the [[bus stop]] [[Klinikum Aachen|university hospital]].]]

===Rail===
Aachen's [[railway station]], the [[Aachen Central Station|Hauptbahnhof]] (Central Station), was constructed in 1841 at the [[Cologne-Aachen high-speed railway|Cologne-Aachen railway line]] and replaced in 1905, moving it significantly closer to the city centre. It serves main lines to Cologne, [[Aachen–Mönchengladbach railway|Mönchengladbach]] and [[HSL 3|Liège]] as well as branch lines to [[Heerlen]], [[Alsdorf]], [[Stolberg (Rhineland)|Stolberg]] and [[Eschweiler]]. [[Intercity-Express|ICE high speed trains]] from [[Brussels]] via [[Cologne]] to [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Thalys]] trains from [[Paris]] to Cologne also stop at Aachen Central Station. Four [[Regional-Express|RE]] lines and two [[Regionalbahn|RB]] lines connect Aachen with the [[Ruhr]]gebiet, Mönchengladbach, Liège, [[Düsseldorf]] and the [[Siegerland]]. The ''[[Euregiobahn]]'', a regional railway system, reaches several minor cities in the Aachen region.

There are four smaller stations in Aachen: ''[[Aachen West station|Aachen West]]'', ''[[Aachen Schanz station|Aachen Schanz]]'', ''[[Aachen-Rothe Erde station|Aachen-Rothe Erde]]'' and ''[[Eilendorf station|Eilendorf]]''. Slower trains stop at these. Aachen-West has developed priority with the expansion of [[RWTH Aachen]] University.

===Roads===
Aachen is connected to the [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] (West-East), [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]] (North-South) and A544 (a smaller motorway from the A4 to the''Europaplatz'' near the city centre). There are plans to eliminate traffic jams as the Aachen road interchange

==Charlemagne Prize==

[[File:Angela Merkel, Karlspreisverleihung 2008 - 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Current [[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]], wearing the Charlemagne Prize awarded to her in 2008.]]
Since 1950, a committee of Aachen citizens annually awards the [[Charlemagne Prize]] ({{lang-de|Karlspreis}}) to personalities of outstanding service to the unification of Europe. It is traditionally awarded on [[Ascension Day]] at the [[Aachen Rathaus|City Hall]]. Most recently in 2013, the Charlemagne Award was awarded to [[Dalia Grybauskaitė]], the [[President of Lithuania]].<ref>Speigel Online (2013)</ref>

The International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen was awarded in the year 2000 to the [[President of the United States]],  [[Bill Clinton]], for his special personal contribution to co-operation with the states of Europe, for the preservation of peace, freedom, democracy and human rights in Europe, and for his support of the enlargement of the European Union. In 2004, [[Pope John Paul II]]'s efforts to unite Europe were honoured with an ‘Extraordinary Charlemagne Medal’, which was awarded for the only time ever.

==Notable residents==
[[File:Mies van der Rohe - Wohnhaus II.JPG|thumb|House of the family of [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]].]]
