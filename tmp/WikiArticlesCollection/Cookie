In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] a '''cookie''' is a small, flat, baked treat, usually containing [[flour]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[sugar]], and either [[butter]] or [[cooking oil]], and often including ingredients such as [[raisin]]s, [[oat]]s, or [[chocolate chip]]s.



==Terminology==

In most English-speaking countries outside [[North America]], including the [[United Kingdom]], the most common word for this type of treat is '''[[biscuit]]''' and the term '''cookie''' is often used to describe only certain types of biscuits. However, in many regions both terms are used, such as the American-inspired [[Maryland Cookies]], while in others the two words have different meanings. 

In [[North American English]] a '''biscuit''' is a kind of [[quick bread]] similar to a [[Scone (bread)|scone]].

In Scotland the term '''cookie''' is sometimes used to describe a plain [[bun]].<ref>http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026125/cookie</ref>

==Etymology==
Its American name derives from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''koekje'' or (informal) ''koekie'' which means ''little cake,'' and arrived in [[American English]] through the Dutch in North America.

According to the [[Scottish National Dictionary]], its Scottish name derives from the [[diminutive form]]  (+ suffix ''-ie'') of the word ''cook'', giving the [[Middle Scots]] ''cookie'', ''cooky'' or ''cu(c)kie''. It also gives an alternative etymology, from the Dutch word ''koekje'', the diminutive of ''koek'', a cake. There was much trade and cultural contact across the [[North Sea]] between the [[Low Countries]] and Scotland during the [[Middle Ages]], which can also be seen in the [[history of curling]] and, perhaps, [[History of golf|golf]].

==Description==
[[File:Různé druhy cukroví (2).jpg|thumb|right|A dish full of cookies]]
Cookies are most commonly baked until crisp or just long enough that they remain soft, but some kinds of cookies are not baked at all. Cookies are made in a wide variety of styles, using an array of ingredients including sugars, [[spice]]s, chocolate, [[butter]], [[peanut butter]], [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, or dried [[fruit]]s. The softness of the cookie may depend on how long it is baked.

A general theory of cookies may be formulated this way. Despite its descent from cakes and other sweetened breads, the cookie in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for cohesion. Water in cakes serves to make the base (in the case of cakes called "batter"<ref>''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', Tenth Edition. Merriam-Webster, Inc.: 1999.</ref>) as thin as possible, which allows the bubbles – responsible for a cake's fluffiness – to better form. In the cookie, the agent of cohesion has become some form of oil. Oils, whether they be in the form of butter, egg yolks, vegetable oils, or lard, are much more viscous than water and evaporate freely at a much higher temperature than water. Thus a cake made with butter or eggs instead of water is far denser after removal from the oven.

Oils in baked cakes do not behave as soda tends to in the finished result. Rather than evaporating and thickening the mixture, they remain, saturating the bubbles of escaped gases from what little water there might have been in the eggs, if added, and the [[carbon dioxide]] released by heating the baking powder. This saturation produces the most texturally attractive feature of the cookie, and indeed all fried foods: crispness saturated with a moisture (namely oil) that does not sink into it.

==History==
[[File:Koekjestrommel open.jpg|thumb|left|Cookies packed in a tin for shipment]]
Cookie-like hard wafers have existed for as long as baking is documented, in part because they deal with travel very well, but they were usually not sweet enough to be considered cookies by modern standards.<ref>http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcookies.html</ref>

Cookies appear to have their origins in 7th century AD [[Persia]], shortly after the use of sugar became relatively common in the region.<ref name="whatscookingamerica">{{cite web |url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/CookieHistory.htm |title=History of Cookies - Cookie History |publisher=Whatscookingamerica.net}}</ref> They spread to Europe through the [[Muslim conquest of Spain]]. By the 14th century, they were common in all levels of society throughout Europe, from royal cuisine to street vendors.

With global travel becoming widespread at that time, cookies made a natural travel companion, a modernized equivalent of the travel cakes used throughout history. One of the most popular early cookies, which traveled especially well and became known on every continent by similar names, was the [[Jumble (cookie)|jumble]], a relatively hard cookie made largely from nuts, sweetener, and water.

Cookies came to America in the early English settlement (the 17th century), although the name "koekje" arrived with the Dutch. This became Anglicized to "cookie" or '''cooky'''. Among the popular early American cookies were the [[macaroon]], [[gingerbread cookie]]s, and of course jumbles of various types.

The most common modern cookie, given its style by the creaming of butter and sugar, was not common until the 18th century.<ref>http://www.ochef.com/25.htm</ref>

==Classification of cookies==
[[File:Holiday Cookie Tray.jpg|thumb|Traditional holiday cookie tray]]

Cookies are broadly classified according to how they are formed, including at least these categories:
* ''Bar cookies'' consist of batter or other ingredients that are poured or pressed into a pan (sometimes in multiple layers) and cut into cookie-sized pieces after baking. In [[British English]], bar cookies are known as "tray bakes". Examples include [[chocolate brownie|brownies]], fruit squares, and bars such as [[date square]]s.
* ''Drop cookies'' are made from a relatively soft dough that is dropped by spoonfuls onto the baking sheet. During baking, the mounds of dough spread and flatten. [[Chocolate chip]] cookies (Toll House cookies), [[oatmeal]] (or oatmeal raisin) cookies, and [[rock cake]]s are popular examples of drop cookies. In the UK, the term "cookie" often refers only to this particular type of product.
* ''Filled cookies'' are made from a rolled cookie dough filled with a fruit or confectionery filling before baking. [[Hamantash]] are a filled cookie.
* ''Molded cookies'' are also made from a stiffer dough that is molded into balls or cookie shapes by hand before baking. [[Snickerdoodle]]s and [[peanut butter cookies]] are examples of molded cookies. Some cookies, such as [[hermit]]s or [[biscotti]], are molded into large flattened loaves that are later cut into smaller cookies.
* ''No-bake cookies'' are made by mixing a filler, such as cereal or nuts, into a melted confectionery binder, shaping into cookies or bars, and allowing to cool or harden. [[Oatmeal cluster]]s and [[Rum ball]]s are no-bake cookies.
* ''Pressed cookies'' are made from a soft dough that is extruded from a [[cookie press]] into various decorative shapes before baking. [[Spritzgebäck]] are an example of a pressed cookie.
* ''Refrigerator cookies'' (also known as ''icebox cookies'') are made from a stiff dough that is refrigerated to become even stiffer. The dough is typically shaped into cylinders which are sliced into round cookies before baking. [[Pinwheel cookie]]s and those made by [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] are representative.
* ''Rolled cookies'' are made from a stiffer dough that is rolled out and cut into shapes with a [[cookie cutter]]. [[Gingerbread man|Gingerbread men]] are an example.
* ''Sandwich cookies'' are rolled or pressed cookies that are assembled as a [[sandwich]] with a sweet filling. Fillings include [[marshmallow]], [[jam]], and [[icing (food)|icing]]. The [[Oreo]] cookie, made of two chocolate cookies with a [[vanilla]] icing filling, is an example.
Cookies also may be decorated with an icing, especially [[chocolate]], and closely resemble a type of [[confectionery]].

==Biscuits (cookies) in the United Kingdom==
A basic biscuit (cookie) recipe includes [[flour]], [[shortening]] (often [[lard]]), [[baking powder]] or [[sodium bicarbonate|soda]], [[milk]] ([[buttermilk]] or sweet milk), and sugar. Common savory variations involve substituting [[sugar]] with an ingredient such as cheese or other dairy products. [[Shortbread]] is a popular biscuit in the UK.
