'''Astrology''' comprises several systems of [[divination]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Astrology|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/39971/astrology}}</ref>  based on the premise that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events in the human world. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and the [[Hindu astrology|Indians]], [[Chinese astrology|Chinese]], and [[Mayans]] developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. In the West, astrology most often consists of a system of [[horoscope]]s that claim to explain aspects of a person's [[personality]] and predict future events in their life based on the positions of the sun, moon, and other planetary objects at the time of their birth. 
 
Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium [[BCE]], with roots in [[Calendrical calculation|calendrical]] systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications.<ref>{{cite book |last=Koch-Westenholz |first=Ulla |title=Mesopotamian astrology : an introduction to Babylonian and Assyrian celestial divination |year=1995 |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |location=Copenhagen |isbn=978-87-7289-287-0 |pages=Foreword, 11}}</ref> A form of astrology was practised in the first dynasty of [[Mesopotamia]] (1950–1651 BCE). Chinese astrology was elaborated in the [[Zhou dynasty]]  (1046–256 BCE). [[Hellenistic astrology]] after 332 BCE mixed [[Babylonian astrology]] with Egyptian [[Decans|Decanic astrology]] in [[Alexandria]], creating [[horoscopic astrology]]. [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of [[Asia]] allowed astrology to spread to [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. In Rome, astrology was associated with '[[Chaldea]]n wisdom'. After the collapse of Alexandria in the 7th century, astrology was taken up by Islamic scholars, and Hellenistic texts were translated into Arabic and Persian. In the 12th century, Arabic texts were imported to Europe and [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]], helping to initiate the European [[Renaissance]], when major astronomers including [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo]] practised as court astrologers. Astrological references appear in literature in the works of poets such as [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], and of playwrights such as [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[William Shakespeare]].

Through most of its history, astrology was considered a scholarly tradition. It was accepted in political and academic contexts, and was connected with other studies, such as [[astronomy]], [[alchemy]], [[meteorology]], and medicine.<ref name=Kassell>{{cite journal|last=Kassell| first=Lauren |title=Stars, spirits, signs: towards a history of astrology 1100–1800 |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences |date=5 May 2010 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=67–69 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2010.04.001}}</ref> At the end of the 17th century, new scientific concepts in astronomy and physics (such as [[heliocentrism]] and [[classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]]) called astrology into question.

Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no validity or explanatory power for describing the universe (a [[pseudoscience]]).

== Principles and practice ==
Advocates have defined astrology as a symbolic language, an [[art]] form, a [[science]], and a method of divination.<ref>''The New Encyclopaedia Britannica, Encyclopaedia Britannica,' v.5, 1974, p. 916</ref><ref>Dietrich, Thomas: 'The Origin of Culture and Civilization,'' Phenix & Phenix Literary Publicists, 2005, p. 305</ref>

Although most cultural systems of astrology share common roots in ancient philosophies that influenced each other, many have unique methodologies which differ from those developed in the West. These include Hindu astrology (also known as "Indian astrology" and in modern times referred to as "Vedic astrology") and Chinese astrology, both of which have influenced the world's cultural history.

{{Details|Western astrology}}
[[Western astrology]] is a form of [[divination]] based on the construction of a [[horoscope]] for an exact moment, such as a person's birth.<ref>{{cite book |first=Philip P. Wiener, ed. in chief |title=Dictionary of the history of ideas |year=1974 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=0-684-13293-1 |url=http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=DicHist/uvaBook/tei/DicHist1.xml;brand=default;}}</ref> It uses the tropical zodiac, which is aligned to the [[Equinox|equinoctial points]].<ref>James R. Lewis, 2003. ''The Astrology Book: the Encyclopedia of Heavenly Influences''. Visible Ink Press. Online at Google Books.</ref>

Western astrology is founded on the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies such as the Sun, Moon, planets, which are analyzed by their movement through [[Astrological sign|signs]] of the [[zodiac]] (twelve spatial divisions of the [[ecliptic]]) and by their [[Astrological aspect|aspects]] (based on geometric angles) relative to one another. They are also considered by their placement in [[House (astrology)|houses]] (twelve spatial divisions of the sky).<ref>{{cite book |last=Hone |first=Margaret |title=The Modern Text-Book of Astrology |year=1978 |publisher=L.

The horoscope visually expresses the set of relationships for the time and place of the chosen event. These relationships are between the seven 'planets', signifying tendencies such as war and love; the twelve signs of the zodiac; and the twelve houses. Each planet is in a particular sign and a particular house at the chosen time, when observed from the chosen place, creating two kinds of relationship.<ref name=Kremer>{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2864524 | title=Horoscopes and History. by J.

Along with [[tarot divination]], astrology is one of the core studies of [[Western esotericism]], and as such has influenced systems of [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] belief not only among Western esotericists and [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]], but also belief systems such as [[Wicca]] that have borrowed from or been influenced by the Western esoteric tradition. [[Tanya Luhrmann]] has said that "all magicians know something about astrology," and refers to a [[table of correspondences]] in [[Starhawk]]'s ''[[The Spiral Dance]]'', organized by [[planets in astrology|planet]], as an example of the astrological lore studied by magicians.<ref name="Luhrmann">{{cite book | title=Persuasions of the witch's craft: ritual magic in contemporary England | publisher=Harvard University Press | author=Luhrmann, Tanya | year=1991 | pages=147–151 | isbn=0-674-66324-1}}</ref>

There is scattered evidence to suggest that the oldest known astrological references are copies of texts made in the ancient world. Two, from the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]] (compiled in [[Babylon]] around 1700 BCE) are reported to have been made during the reign of king [[Sargon of Akkad]] (2334–2279 BCE).<ref>Two texts which refer to the 'omens of Sargon' are reported in E. F. Weidner, 'Historiches Material in der Babyonischen Omina-Literatur' ''Altorientalische Studien'', ed. Bruno Meissner, (Leipzig, 1928-9), v. 231 and 236.</ref> Another, showing an early use of [[electional astrology]], is ascribed to the reign of the [[Sumer]]ian ruler [[Gudea of Lagash]] (c. 2144 – 2124 BCE). This describes how the gods revealed to him in a dream the constellations that would be most favorable for the planned construction of a temple.<ref>From scroll A of the ruler Gudea of Lagash, I 17 – VI 13. O. Kaiser, ''Texte aus der Umwelt des Alten Testaments'', Bd. 2, 1–3. Gütersloh, 1986–1991. Also quoted in A. Falkenstein, 'Wahrsagung in der sumerischen Überlieferung', ''La divination en Mésopotamie ancienne et dans les régions voisines''. Paris, 1966.</ref> However, there is controversy about whether they were genuinely recorded at the time or merely ascribed to ancient rulers by posterity. The oldest undisputed evidence of the use of astrology as an integrated system of knowledge is therefore attributed to the records of the first dynasty of [[Mesopotamia]] (1950–1651 BCE). This astrology had a small number of parallels with [[Hellenistic]] Greek (western) astrology, including the zodiac, a norming point near 9 degrees in Aries, the trine aspect, planetary exaltations, and the dodekatemoria (the twelve divisions of 30 degrees each).<ref name=Rochberg-Halton>{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/603245 | title=Elements of the Babylonian Contribution to Hellenistic Astrology | author=Rochberg-Halton, F. | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | year=1988 | volume=108 | issue=1 | pages=51–62}}</ref> However, the Babylonians viewed celestial events as possible signs rather than as causes of physical events.<ref name=Rochberg-Halton/>

The system of Chinese astrology was elaborated during the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BCE) and flourished during the [[Han Dynasty]] (2nd century BCE to 2nd century CE), during which all the familiar elements of traditional Chinese culture – the Yin-Yang philosophy, theory of the five elements, Heaven and Earth, Confucian morality – were brought together to formalise the philosophical principles of Chinese medicine and divination, astrology and alchemy.<ref name=Kistemaker />{{rp|3,4}}

====Ancient objections====
[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|upright|The Roman orator [[Cicero]] objected to astrology.]]
[[Cicero]] stated the twins objection (that with close birth times, personal outcomes can be very different), later developed by Saint Augustine.<ref>Long, 2005. p. 173.</ref> He argued that since the other planets are much further from the earth than the moon, they could have only very tiny influence compared to the moon's.<ref>Long, 2005. pp.&nbsp;173–174.</ref> He also argued that if astrology explains everything about a person's fate, then it wrongly ignores the visible effect of inherited ability and parenting, changes in health worked by medicine, or the effects of the weather on people.<ref>Long, 2005. p. 177.</ref>

[[Plotinus]] argued that since the fixed stars are much further away than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on mankind should depend on their position with respect to the zodiac. He also argues that the interpretion of the moon's conjunction with a planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of her surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the moon is full to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.<ref>Long, 2005. p. 174.</ref>

[[Favorinus]] argued that it was absurd to imagine that stars and planets would affect human bodies in the same way as they affect the tides,<ref>Long, 2005. p. 184.</ref> and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates. [[Sextus Empiricus]] argued that it was absurd to link human attributes with myths about the signs of the zodiac.<ref>Long, 2005. p. 186.</ref> [[Carneades]] argued that belief in fate denies [[free will]] and [[morality]]; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.<ref>{{cite book | title=Lament, Death, and Destiny | publisher=Peter Lang | author=Hughes, Richard | year=2004 | page=87}}</ref>

===Hellenistic Egypt===

With the occupation by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BC, Egypt became [[Hellenistic]].  The city of [[Alexandria]] was founded by Alexander after the conquest, becoming the place where [[Babylonian astrology]] was mixed with Egyptian [[Decans|Decanic astrology]] to create [[Horoscopic astrology]]. This contained the Babylonian zodiac with its system of planetary [[exaltation (astrology)|exaltation]]s, the triplicities of the signs and the importance of eclipses. It used the Egyptian concept of dividing the zodiac into thirty-six decans of ten degrees each, with an emphasis on the rising decan, and the Greek system of planetary Gods, sign rulership and [[four elements]].<ref>Holden, 1996. pp.&nbsp;11–13.</ref> 2nd century BC texts predict positions of planets in zodiac signs at the time of the rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis.<ref>Barton, 1994. p. 20.</ref> The [[astrologer]] and astronomer [[Ptolemy#Astrology|Ptolemy]] lived in Alexandria.

'Introduction' p. xii.</ref>

=== Greece and Rome ===
The conquest of [[Asia]] by [[Alexander the Great]] exposed the Greeks to ideas from [[Syria]], Babylon, Persia and central Asia.<ref>Campion, 2008.  p. 173.</ref> Around 280 BC, [[Berossus]], a priest of [[Marduk|Bel]] from Babylon, moved to the Greek island of [[Kos]], teaching astrology and Babylonian culture.<ref>Campion, 2008. p. 84.</ref> By the 1st century BC there were two varieties of astrology, one using [[horoscope]]s to describe the past, present and future; the other, [[theurgic]], emphasising the [[soul|soul's]] ascent to the stars.<ref>Campion, 2008.  pp.&nbsp;173–174.</ref> Greek influence played a crucial role in the transmission of astrological theory to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].<ref name=B32>Barton, 1994. p. 32.</ref>

The first definite reference to astrology in Rome comes from the orator [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], who in 160 BC warned farm overseers against consulting with Chaldeans,<ref>Barton, 1994. p.&nbsp;32–33.</ref> who were described as Babylonian 'star-gazers'.<ref name=Campion227>Campion, 2008.  pp.&nbsp;227–228.</ref> Among both Greeks and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], Babylonia (also known as [[Chaldea]]) became so identified with astrology that 'Chaldean wisdom' became [[synonym]]ous with [[divination]] using planets and stars.<ref>Parker, 1983. p. 16.</ref>  The 2nd-century Roman poet and satirist [[Juvenal]] complains about the pervasive influence of Chaldeans, saying "Still more trusted are the Chaldaeans; every word uttered by the astrologer they will believe has come from [[Jupiter Hammon|Hammon's]] fountain".<ref>[[Juvenal]], Satire 6: ''[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/juvenal_satires_06.htm The Ways of Women]'' (translated by G.

===Demarcation===
Under the criterion of [[falsifiability]], first proposed by [[philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]], astrology is a pseudoscience.<ref name=PopperStanford>{{cite web|author=Stephen Thornton, Edward N. Zalta (older edition)|title=Karl Popper|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> Popper regarded astrology as "pseudo-empirical" in that "it appeals to observation and experiment", but "nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards".<ref name=Popper>{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl|title=Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-28594-1|edition=Reprinted.|chapter=}}

To Kuhn, although astrologers had, historically, made predictions that "categorically failed", this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do the attempts by astrologers to explain away the failure by claiming it was due to the creation of a horoscope being very difficult. Rather, in Kuhn's eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to [[medieval medicine]]; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,<ref name=Kuhn />{{rp|8}} and so "they had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise".<ref name=Wright />{{rp|401}}<ref name=Kuhn>{{cite book|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|title=Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science [held at Bedford College, Regent's Park, London, from July 11th to 17th 1965] |year=1970 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-09623-5 |edition=Reprint |editor=[[Imre Lakatos]] & [[Alan Musgrave]]}}</ref>{{rp|8}} While an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological [[hypothesis]] in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.<ref name=Kuhn />{{rp|8}}

Philosopher [[Paul Thagard]] believed that astrology can not be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative.<ref name=Thagard />{{rp|228}} To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience was that the state of the art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be "selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations".<ref name=Thagard />{{rp|227–228}} Progress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years.<ref name=Thagard />{{rp|228}}<ref name=Hurley />{{rp|549}} To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in [[Normal science]] believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the "many unsolved problems", and in the face of better alternative theories (Psychology).

For the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.<ref name=EdwardJ />{{rp|34}}

{{quote|What if throughout astrological writings we meet little appreciation of coherence, blatant insensitivity to evidence, no sense of a hierachy of reasons, slight command over the contextual force of critieria, stubborn unwillingless to pursue an argument where it leads, stark naivete concerning the effiacacy of explanation and so on? In that case, I think, we are perfectly justified in rejecting astrology as irrational.&nbsp;... Astrology simply fails to meet the multifarious demands of legitimate reasoning."|Edward W.

===Lack of mechanisms and consistency===
Testing the validity of astrology can be difficult because there is no consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict.<ref name=Cosmic />{{rp|83}} Most professional astrologers are paid to predict the future or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.<ref name="Cosmic"/><ref name="Eysenck1982"/>{{rp|83}}

Some of these astrologers have proposed conventional [[Causality|causal agent]]s such as [[electromagnetism]] and [[gravity]].<ref name=ChrisFrench/><ref name=SundayTimes /> Scientists reject these mechanisms as implausible<ref name=ChrisFrench /> since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances.<ref name=SundayTimes>{{cite web|last=Randi|first=James|title=UK MEDIA NONSENSE — AGAIN|url=http://www.randi.org/jr/052104uk.html|work=21 May 2004|publisher=Swift, Online newspaper of the [[JREF]]|accessdate=8 July 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110722055123/http://randi.org/jr/052104uk.html|archivedate=22 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=Shermer>{{cite book|last=editor|first=Michael Shermer,|title=The Skeptic encyclopedia of pseudoscience.|year=2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1-57607-653-9|page=241}}</ref>

Astrologers usually have only a small knowledge of astronomy and they often do not take into account basic features such as the [[Precession#Axial precession (precession of the equinoxes)|precession of the equinoxes]] which would change the position of the sun with time; they commented on the example of Elizabeth Teissier who claimed that "the sun ends up in the same place in the sky on the same date each year" as the basis for claims that two people with the same birthday but a number of years apart should be under the same planetary influence. Charpak and Broch noted that "there is a difference of about twenty-two thousand miles between Earth's location on any specific date in two successive years" and that thus they should not be under the same influence according to astrology. Over a 40 years period there would be a difference greater than 780,000 miles.<ref name=Charpak>{{cite book|last=Charpak|first=Georges|title=Debunked!: ESP, telekinesis, and other pseudoscience|year=2004|publisher=Johns Hopkins Univ.

== Theological viewpoints ==
{{see also|Christianity and astrology|Jewish views on astrology|Muslim views on astrology}}

===Ancient===
[[St. Augustine]] (354-430) believed that the determinism of astrology conflicted with the Christian doctrines of man's free will and responsibility, and God not being the cause of evil,<ref>{{cite book | title=Magic and Divination at the Courts of Burgundy and France: Text and Context of Laurens Pignon's "Contre les Devineurs" (1411) | publisher=Brill | author=Veenstra, J.R. | year=1997 | isbn=978-90-04-10925-4|pages=184–185}}</ref> but he also grounded his opposition philosophically, citing the failure of astrology to explain twins who behave differently although conceived at the same moment and born at approximately the same time.<ref name=Hess>{{cite book |last=Hess |first=Peter M.J. |title=Catholicism and science |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood |location=Westport |isbn=978-0-313-33190-9 |page=11 |edition=1st |coauthors=Allen, Paul L.}}</ref>

===Medieval===
Some of the practices of astrology were contested on theological grounds by medieval Muslim astronomers such as [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius), [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) and [[Avicenna]]. They said that the methods of astrologers conflicted with orthodox religious views of [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]] through the suggestion that the Will of God can be known and predicted in advance.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Saliba |first=George |authorlink=George Saliba |year=1994b |title=A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam |publisher=[[New York University Press]] |isbn=0-8147-8023-7 |pages=60 & 67–69 |postscript=.}}</ref>

For example, Avicenna's 'Refutation against astrology' ''Risāla fī ibṭāl aḥkām al-nojūm'', argues against the practice of astrology while supporting the principle of planets acting as the agents of divine causation which express God's absolute power over creation. Avicenna considered that the movement of the planets influenced life on earth in a deterministic way, but argued against the capability of determining the exact influence of the stars.<ref>Catarina Belo, Catarina Carriço Marques de Moura Belo, ''Chance and determinism in Avicenna and Averroës'', p. 228. Brill, 2007. ISBN 90-04-15587-2.</ref> In essence, Avicenna did not refute the essential dogma of astrology, but denied our ability to understand it to the extent that precise and fatalistic predictions could be made from it.<ref>[[George Saliba]], ''Avicenna'': 'viii. Mathematics and Physical Sciences'. Encyclopaedia Iranica, Online Edition, 2011, available at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-viii</ref>

[[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]] (1292–1350), in his ''Miftah Dar al-SaCadah'', also used [[physics|physical]] arguments in astronomy to question the practice of judicial astrology.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah: A Fourteenth Century Defense against Astrological Divination and Alchemical Transmutation|first=John W.|last=Livingston|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=91|issue=1|year=1971|pages=96–103|doi=10.2307/600445|jstor=600445|postscript=.}}</ref> He recognized that the [[star]]s are much larger than the [[planet]]s, and argued:

{{blockquote|And if you astrologers answer that it is precisely because of this distance and smallness that their influences are negligible, then why is it that you claim a great influence for the smallest heavenly body, Mercury? Why is it that you have given an influence to al-Ra's and [[al-Dhanab]], which are two imaginary points [ascending and descending nodes]?|Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya<ref name=Livingston>{{Cite journal|title=Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah: A Fourteenth Century Defense against Astrological Divination and Alchemical Transmutation|first=John W.|last=Livingston|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=91|issue=1|year=1971|pages=96–103 [99]|doi=10.2307/600445|jstor=600445|postscript=.}}</ref>}}

===Modern===

Divination, including predictive astrology, is stated in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] to be incompatible with modern [[Catholicism|Catholic]] beliefs<ref>{{cite book|last=editor|first=Peter M.J. Stravinskas,|title=Our Sunday visitor's Catholic encyclopedia|year=1998|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Pub.|location=Huntington, Ind.|isbn=0-87973-669-0|edition=Rev. ed.|page=111}}</ref> such as free will:<ref name=Hess />

{{blockquote|All forms of divination are to be rejected: recourse to Satan or demons, conjuring up the dead or other practices falsely supposed to "unveil" the future. Consulting horoscopes, astrology, palm reading, interpretation of omens and lots, the phenomena of clairvoyance, and recourse to mediums all conceal a desire for power over time, history, and, in the last analysis, other human beings, as well as a wish to conciliate hidden powers.

In the West, political leaders have sometimes consulted astrologers. [[Louis de Wohl]] worked as an astrologer for the British intelligence agency [[MI5]], after it was claimed that [[Hitler]] used astrology to time his actions. The War Office was "interested to know what Hitler's own astrologers would be telling him from week to week".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JrdVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5bADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6779,6948658&dq=hitler-astrologer&hl=en | title=The Strange Story Of Britain's "State Seer" | publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=August 30, 1952 | accessdate=July 21, 2012}}</ref> In fact de Wohl's predictions were so inaccurate that he was soon labelled a "complete charlatan" and it was later shown that Hitler considered astrology to be "complete nonsense".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/mar/04/nationalarchives.secondworldwar | title=Star turn: astrologer who became SOE's secret weapon against Hitler | publisher=The Guardian | date=March 4, 2008 | accessdate=July 21, 2012}}</ref> After [[John Hinckley]]'s attempted assassination of U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], first lady [[Nancy Reagan]] commissioned astrologer [[Joan Quigley]] to act as the secret White House astrologer.

There was a boom in interest in astrology in the late 1960s. The sociologist [[Marcello Truzzi]] described three levels of involvement of "Astrology-believers" to account for its revived popularity in the face of scientific discrediting. He found that most astrology-believers did not claim it was a scientific explanation with predictive power. Instead, those superficially involved, knowing "next to nothing" about astrology's 'mechanics', read newspaper astrology columns, and could benefit from "tension-management of anxieties" and "a cognitive belief-system that transcends science".<ref name=Truzzi>{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4105818 | title=The Occult Revival as Popular Culture: Some Random Observations on the Old and the Nouveau Witch | author=Truzzi, Marcello | journal=The Sociological Quarterly | year=1972 | volume=13 | issue=1 | pages=16–36}}</ref>

Those at the second level usually had their horoscopes cast and sought advice and predictions. They were much younger than those at the first level, and could benefit from knowledge of the language of astrology and the resulting ability to belong to a coherent and exclusive group. Those at the third level were highly involved and usually cast horoscopes for themselves. Astrology provided this small minority of astrology-believers with a "''meaningful'' view of their universe and [gave] them an ''understanding'' of their place in it."{{efn|Italics in original.}} This third group took astrology seriously, possibly as a "sacred canopy", whereas the other two groups took it playfully and irreverently.<ref name=Truzzi/>

In [[Japan]], a strong belief in astrology has led to dramatic changes in the fertility rate and the number of abortions in the years of "Fire Horse". Women born in ''hinoeuma'' years are believed to be unmarriageable and to bring bad luck to their father or husband.

===Literature and music===
[[File:Woman in the Moon.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Title page of [[John Lyly]]'s astrological play, ''The Woman in the Moon'', 1597]]
The fourteenth-century English poets [[John Gower]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] both referred to astrology in their works, including Gower's ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' and Chaucer's ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.<ref name=Wedel/> Chaucer commented explicitly on astrology in his ''Treatise on the Astrolabe'', demonstrating personal knowledge of one area, judicial astrology, with an account of how to find the ascendant or rising sign.<ref name=WoodAstrolabe>Wood, 1970. pp.12–21</ref>

Although references to astrology were already frequent in the romances of the fourteenth century, these still retained the signs of being foreign importations. It was only in the fifteenth century that astrological similes and embellishments became a matter of course in the literature of England.<br>Such innovations, one must confess, were due far more to Chaucer than to Gower. Although Gower, too, saw artistic possibilities in the new astrological learning, and made prompt use of these in his retelling of the Alexander legend, he confined himself, for the most part, to a bald rehearsal of facts and theories. It is accordingly, as a part of the long encyclopaedia of natural science which he inserted into his ''Confessio Amantis'', and in certain didactic passages of the ''Vox Clamantis'' and the ''Mirour de l'Omme'', that Astrology figures most largely in his works&nbsp;... Gower's sources on the subject of astrology&nbsp;... were Albumasar's ''Introductorium in Astronomiam'', the Pseudo-Aristotelian ''Secretum Secretorum'', Brunetto Latini's ''Tr&eacute;sor'', and the ''Speculum Astronomiae'' ascribed to Albert the Great.}}</ref>

The most famous piece of music to be influenced by astrology is the orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]''. Written by the British composer [[Gustav Holst]] (1874–1934), and first performed in 1918, the framework of ''The Planets'' is based upon the astrological symbolism of the planets.<ref>Campion, Nicholas.:''A History of Western Astrology: Volume II: The Medieval and Modern Worlds''. (Continuum Books, 2009) pp.&nbsp;244–245 ISBN 978-1-84725-224-1</ref> Each of the seven movements of the suite is based upon a different planet, though the movements are not in the order of the planets from the Sun. The composer [[Colin Matthews]] wrote an eighth movement entitled "Pluto, the Renewer", first performed in 2000.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=6045052 | title='Pluto the Renewer' is no swan song | publisher=National Public Radio (NPR) | date=2006-09-10 | accessdate=2013-06-13 | author=Adams, Noah}}</ref>
