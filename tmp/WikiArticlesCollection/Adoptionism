'''Adoptionism''', sometimes called [[monarchianism|dynamic monarchianism]],  is a minority Christian belief that Jesus was adopted as God's [[Son of God|Son]] either at his [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]], his [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], or his [[ascension of Jesus|ascension]]. According to [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]]'s account of the [[Ebionites]], the group believed that Jesus was chosen because of his sinless devotion to the will of God.<ref>Epiphanius of Salamis (403 CE). pp. 30:3 & 30:13.</ref>

Adoptionism was declared heresy at the end of the 2nd century and was rejected by the [[First Council of Nicaea]], which defined the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox doctrine]] of the [[Trinity]] and identified the man Jesus with [[Nicene Creed|the eternally begotten Son or Word of God]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Harnack|first=Adolf Von|title=History of Dogma|year=1889|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma1.II.III.III.html}}</ref>

Some scholars see Adoptionist concepts in the [[Gospel of Mark]] and in the writings of the [[Apostle Paul]]. According to this view, though Mark has Jesus as the Son of God, references occurring at the strategic points in 1:1 ("The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God", but not in all versions, see [[Mark 1]]), 5:7 ("What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?") and 15:39 ("Surely this man was the Son of God!"), the concept of the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus]] had not been developed or elucidated at the time of the writing of this early Christian text.<ref>{{cite book|last=Witherington|first=Ben|title=What Have They Done With Jesus?|year=2006|publisher=Harper Collins|location=San Francisco|page=7}}</ref> By the time the Gospels of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] were written, Jesus is identified as being the Son of God from the time of birth. Finally, the [[Gospel of John]] portrays him as the pre-existent Word ({{lang-el|λόγος}}) [[Pre-existence of Christ|as existing "in the beginning"]].<ref name=Ehr_The>{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart|title=The Orthodox Corruption of the Scripture|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=74–75}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Early primary writings ===

In ''The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture'',  popular author and text critic [[Bart D. Ehrman]] argues that the ''Adoptionist Theology'' may date back almost to the [[Cultural and historical background of Jesus|time of Jesus]] and his view is shared by many other scholars{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

Due to recorded predictions of the destruction of the temple, the ''Gospel of Mark''  is believed by many [[higher criticism|critical]] scholars to have been composed around or shortly after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|fall of Jerusalem]] due to prophecies assumed to be ''ex post facto'' regarding the destruction of the temple, and critical scholarly consensus maintains that it was the first written gospel, though the earliest traditional consensus puts Matthew's Gospel as the first of the [[canonical gospel]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crossan|first=John Dominic|title=The Historical Jesus|year=1991|publisher=Harper Collins|location=San Francisco}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Eisenman|first=Robert|title=James the Brother of Jesus|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|page=56}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Millard|first=Alan|title=Reading and writing in the time of Jesus|year=2000|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|page=56}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Irenaeus|title=Against Heresies|year=180|page=3:1}}</ref> The phrase "Son of God" is not present in some early manuscripts at {{bibleverse||Mark|1:1|esv}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Metzger|first=Bruce|title=A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament|year=1996|pages= Mark 1:1|publisher=United Bible Societies|location=New York}}</ref> Ehrman uses this omission to support the notion that the title "Son of God" is not used of Jesus until his baptism, and that ''Mark'' reflects an adoptionist view. The words, "''Today I have begotten you''," are omitted from the canonical ''Gospel of Mark'', however, and it is therefore generally believed to have less adoptionist tendencies than the ''Gospel of the Hebrews''.<ref name=Ehr_The />

Paul's writings do not explicitly mention a Virgin birth of Christ. Paul wrote that Jesus was "born of a woman, born under the law" and "as to his human nature was a descendant of David" in the [[Epistle to the Galatians]] and  the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. {{bibleverse || Hebrews|1:5|esv}} states that God said, "You are my son. ''Today I have begotten you''," a phrase that shows adoptionist tendencies.  It is also almost a direct quote from {{bibleverse || Psalm|2 || esv}}.

== Adoptionism and Christology ==

Adoptionism is one of two main forms of [[monarchianism]] (the other is [[modalism]], which regards "Father" and "Son" as two historical or [[soteriology|soteriological]] roles of a single divine Person). Adoptionism (also known as [[dynamic monarchianism]]) denies the eternal [[pre-existence of Christ]], and although it explicitly affirms his deity subsequent to events in his life, many classical [[Trinity|trinitarians]] claim that the doctrine implicitly denies it by denying the constant hypostatic union of the eternal Logos to the human nature of Jesus.<ref>Justo L. González, ''Essential Theological Terms'', page 139 (Westminster John Knox Press, 2005). ISBN 978-0-664-22810-1</ref>  Under Adoptionism Jesus is currently divine and has been since his adoption, although he is not equal to the Father, per "my Father is greater than I" ({{bibleverse||John|14:28}}).<ref>Ed Hindson, Ergun Caner (editors), ''The Popular Encyclopedia of Apologetics: Surveying the Evidence for the Truth of Christianity'', page 16 (Harvest House Publishers, 2008). ISBN 978-0-7369-2084-1</ref> and as such is a kind of [[subordinationism]].

Adoptionism was one position in a long series of Christian disagreements about the precise nature of Christ (see [[Christology]]) in the developing dogma of the [[Trinity]], an attempt to explain the relationship between Jesus of Nazareth, both as man and God, and God the Father while confidently claiming to be uncompromisingly [[monotheism|monotheistic]]. It differs significantly from the doctrine of the Trinity that was later affirmed by the [[ecumenical council]]s.

=== Second century: ante-Nicene Christology ===

The first known exponent of Adoptionism in the 2nd century is [[Theodotus of Byzantium]]. According to [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (''[[Philosophumena]]'', VII, xxiii) Theodotus taught that Jesus was a man born of a virgin, according to the Council of Jerusalem, that he lived like other men, and was most pious; but that at his baptism in the Jordan the "Christ" came down upon the man Jesus in the likeness of a dove. Therefore wonders (Greek ''dynameis'') were not wrought in him until the Spirit (which Theodotus called Christ) came down and was manifested in Him. (''[[Philosophumena]]'', VII, xxiii) The belief was declared heretical by [[Pope Victor I]].

The 2nd-century work [[Shepherd of Hermas]] also taught that Jesus was a virtuous man filled with the Holy Spirit and adopted as the Son.<ref>"The Holy Pre-existent Spirit. Which created the whole creation, God made to dwell in flesh that he desired. This flesh, therefore, in which the Holy Spirit dwelt, was subject unto the Spirit, walking honorably in holiness and purity, without in any way defiling the Spirit. When then it had lived honorably in chastity, and had labored with the Spirit, and had cooperated with it in everything, behaving itself boldly and bravely, he chose it as a partner with the Holy Spirit; for the career of this flesh pleased [the Lord], seeing that, as possessing the Holy Spirit, it was not defiled upon the earth. He therefore took the son as adviser and the glorious angels also, that this flesh too, having served the Spirit unblamably, might have some place of sojourn, and might not seem to have lost the reward for its service; for all flesh, which is found undefiled and unspotted, wherein the Holy Spirit dwelt, shall receive a reward." [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/shepherd-lightfoot.html]</ref><ref>"Hermas never mentions Jesus Christ, or the Word, but only the Son of God, who is the highest angel. As holy spirit the Son dwells in the flesh; this human nature is God's adopted son" in, Patrick W. Carey, Joseph T. Lienhard (editors), ''Biographical Dictionary of Christian Theologians'', page 241 (Greenwood Press, 2008). ISBN 0-313-29649-9</ref> While the Shepherd of Hermas was popular and sometimes bound with the canonical scriptures, it didn't retain canonical status, if it ever had it.

In the 3rd century, [[Paul of Samosata]], [[Patriarch of Antioch]], promoted adoptionism. He said Jesus had been a man who kept himself sinless and achieved union with God. His views, however, did not neatly fit in either of the two main forms of Monarchianism.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}<!-- why not? -->

== Medieval and modern Adoptionism ==

=== Spanish Adoptionism ===

[[Spanish Adoptionism]] was a theological position which was articulated in [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Umayyad]] and [[Kingdom of Asturias|Christian]]-held regions of the [[Iberian peninsula]] in the 8th and 9th centuries. The issue seems to have begun with the claim of archbishop [[Elipandus of Toledo]] that – in respect to his human nature – Christ was ''adoptive'' [[Son of God]]. Another leading advocate of this Christology was [[Felix of Urgel]]. In Spain, Adoptionism was opposed by [[Beatus of Liebana]], and in the [[Carolingian]] territories, the Adoptionist position was condemned by [[Pope Hadrian I]], [[Alcuin of York]], [[Agobard]], and officially in Carolingian territory by the Council of Frankfurt (794).

Despite the shared name of "Adoptionism" the Spanish Adoptionist Christology appears to have differed sharply from the Adoptionism of early Christianity. Spanish advocates predicated the term ''adoptivus'' of Christ only in respect to his humanity; once the divine Son "emptied himself" of divinity  and "took the form of a servant" (Philippians 2:7), Christ's human nature was "adopted" as divine.<ref>James Ginther, ''Westminster Handbook to Medieval Theology'', (Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 2009), 3.</ref>

Historically, many scholars have followed the Adoptionists' Carolingian opponents in labeling Spanish Adoptionism as a minor revival of “Nestorian” Christology.<ref>For an example of this characterization, see Adolph Harnack, ‘’History of Dogma’’, vol. 5, trans. Neil Buchanan, (New York: Dover, 1961), 280.</ref> John C. Cavadini has challenged this notion by attempting to take the Spanish Christology in its own Spanish/North African context in his important study, ''The Last Christology of the West: Adoptionism in Spain and Gaul, 785–820''.<ref>John C. Cavadini, ‘’The Last Christology of the West: Adoptionism in Spain and Gaul, 785–820’’, (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), 4–5.</ref>

=== 12th century and later: Neo-adoptionism ===

A third wave was the revived form ("Neo-Adoptionism") of [[Peter Abelard]] in the 12th century. Later, various modified and qualified adoptionist tenets emerged from some theologians in the 14th century. [[Duns Scotus]] (1300) and [[Durandus of Saint-Pourçain]] (1320) admit the term ''Filius adoptivus'' in a qualified sense. In more recent times the Jesuit [[Gabriel Vásquez]], and the Lutheran divines [[Georgius Calixtus]] and [[Johann Ernst Immanuel Walch]], have defended adoptionism as essentially orthodox.

=== 19th century, Psilanthropism ===

A form of adoptionism surfaced in [[Unitarianism]] during the 18th century as the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] was increasingly denied by Unitarians {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. In the 19th century the term  [[Psilanthropism]], was applied by such as [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] who so called his own view that Jesus was the son of Joseph.<ref>Cyclopædia of Biblical, theological, and ecclesiastical literature, Volume 2 By John McClintock, James Strong</ref>)
