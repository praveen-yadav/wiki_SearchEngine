The '''Burgundians''' ({{lang-la|Burgundiōnes}}<!-- also Burgundī -->; {{lang-on|Burgundar}}; {{lang-ang|Burgendas}}<!-- also Burgendan and Burgende -->; {{lang-el|Βούργουνδοι}}<!-- also Βουρούγουνδοι and Οὐρουγοῦνδοι -->) were an [[Germanic peoples|East Germanic tribe]] which may have emigrated from mainland [[Scandinavia]] to the Baltic island of [[Bornholm]], and from there to the [[Vistula]] basin, in middle modern Poland. A part of the Burgundian tribes migrated further westward, where they may have participated in the 406 [[Crossing of the Rhine]], after which they settled in the [[Rhine Valley]] and established the [[Kingdom of the Burgundians]]. Another part of Burgundians stayed in their previous homeland in Oder-Vistula basin and formed a contingent in [[Attila]]'s [[Hunnic]] army by 451.<ref name=Appolinarius>Sidonnius Appolinarius, ''Carmina'', 7, 322</ref><ref name=Luebe>Luebe, ''Die Burgunder'', in Krüger II, p. 373 n. 21, in Herbert Schutz, ''Tools, weapons and ornaments: Germanic material culture in Pre-Carolingian Central Europe, 400-750'', BRILL, 2001, p.36</ref>

Their name survives in the regional appellation, [[Burgundy]].

==Name==
{{see also|Bornholm}}
The name of the Burgundians has since remained connected to the area of modern France that still bears their name: see the later history of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. Between the 6th and 20th centuries, however, the boundaries and political connections of this area have changed frequently; with none of the changes having had anything to do with the original Burgundians. The name ''Burgundians'' used here and generally used by English writers to refer to the Burgundiones is a later formation and more precisely refers to the inhabitants of the territory of Burgundy which was named from the people called Burgundiones.  The descendants of the Burgundians today are found primarily among the west [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]] and neighbouring regions of France.

==History==

===Background===
[[File:DenmarkBornholm2.png|thumb|right|220px|Location of the island of [[Bornholm]]]]
The Burgundians had a tradition of [[Scandinavia]]n origin which finds support in place-name evidence and archaeological evidence (Stjerna) and many consider their tradition to be correct (e.g. Musset, p.&nbsp;62). Roman sources considered the Burgundians as simply another East Germanic tribe and do not mention where they came from, possibly because Scandinavia was beyond the horizon of the earliest Roman sources, including [[Tacitus]] (who only mentions one Scandinavian tribe, the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Suiones]]). The first Roman references place them east (i.e., non-Roman side) of the [[Rhine]] (''inter alia'', [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], XVIII, 2, 15). In ''[[Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar]]'' (''The Saga of Thorstein, Viking's Son''), Veseti settled in an island or holm, which was called Borgund's holm, i.e. Bornholm. [[Alfred the Great]]'s translation of ''[[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'' uses the name ''Burgenda land''. The poet and early mythologist [[Viktor Rydberg]] (1828&ndash;1895), (''Our Fathers' Godsaga'') asserted from an early medieval source, ''[[Sigismund of Burgundy|Vita Sigismundi]]'', that themselves retained oral traditions about their Scandinavian origin.

The Burgundians are believed to have originated in mainland Scandinavia and at some time emigrated to the Baltic island of [[Bornholm]] ("the island of the Burgundians" in [[Old Norse]]). However, by about 250 the population of Bornholm had largely disappeared from the island. Most cemeteries ceased to be used, and those that were still used had few burials (Stjerna, in Nerman 1925:176).

By the end of the 4th century the Burgundians appeared in the [[Vistula]] basin, in central modern Poland. In 369, the Emperor [[Valentinian I]] enlisted the aid of the Burgundians in his war against another Germanic tribe, the [[Alamanni]] (Ammianus, XXVIII, 5, 8-15). According to the mid-6th century historian of the [[Goths]], [[Jordanes]], at that time the Burgundians were possibly living in the Vistula basin. Sometime after the war against the Alamanni, the Burgundians were overwhelmed and almost annihilated after being beaten in battle by [[Goth]]ic [[Fastida]], king of the [[Gepids]], whose kingdom was at the mouth of the Vistula.

Approximately four decades later, the Burgundians appear again. Following [[Stilicho]]'s withdrawal of troops to fight [[Alaric I]] the [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] in AD 406-408, the northern tribes crossed the Rhine and entered the Empire in the ''[[Völkerwanderung]]'', or Germanic migrations.  Among them were the [[Alans]], [[Vandals]], the [[Suevi]], and possibly some Burgundians. A part of Burgundians migrated westwards and settled as ''[[foederati]]'' in the Roman province of [[Germania Secunda]] along the [[Middle Rhine]]. Another part of Burgundians stayed in their previous homeland in Oder-Vistula interfluvial and formed a contingent in [[Attila]]'s [[Hunnic]] army by 451.<ref name=Appolinarius /><ref name=Luebe />

===Kingdom===
{{Main|Kingdom of the Burgundians}}

====Establishment====
In 411, the Burgundian king [[Gunther|Gundahar]] (or ''Gundicar'') set up a puppet emperor, [[Jovinus]], in cooperation with [[Goar]], king of the [[Alans]]. With the authority of the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallic emperor]] that he controlled, Gundahar settled on the left (Roman) bank of the Rhine, between the river [[Lauter (Rhine)|Lauter]] and the [[Nahe (river)|Nahe]], seizing [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Speyer]], and [[Strassburg]]. Apparently as part of a truce, the Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] later officially "granted" them the land, (Prosper, a. 386) with its capital at the old Celtic Roman settlement of Borbetomagus (present [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]).

Despite their new status as ''foederati'', Burgundian raids into Roman Upper [[Gallia Belgica]] became intolerable and were ruthlessly brought to an end in 436, when the Roman general [[Flavius Aëtius|Aëtius]] called in [[Hun]] mercenaries who overwhelmed the Rhineland kingdom in 437. Gundahar was killed in the fighting, reportedly along with the majority of the Burgundian tribe. (Prosper; ''Chronica Gallica 452''; Hydatius; and Sidonius Apollinaris)

The destruction of Worms and the Burgundian kingdom by the Huns became the subject of heroic legends that were afterwards incorporated in the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''&mdash;on which [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] based his [[Ring Cycle]]&mdash;where King Gunther (Gundahar) and Queen [[Brünnehilde|Brünhild]] hold their court at Worms, and [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] comes to woo Kriemhild. (In Old Norse sources the names are ''Gunnar'', ''Brynhild'', and ''Gudrún'' as normally rendered in English.)  In fact, the ''Etzel'' of the ''Nibelungenlied'' is based on [[Attila the Hun]].

===Settlement in Savoy===
[[File:Map Burgundian Kingdom EN.png|thumb|right|230px|The Second Burgundian Kingdom between 443 and 476]]
For reasons not cited in the sources, the Burgundians were granted ''foederati'' status a second time, and in 443 were resettled by [[Flavius Aëtius|Aëtius]] in the region of ''Sapaudia''. (''Chronica Gallica 452'')  Though the precise geography is uncertain, ''Sapaudia'' corresponds to the modern-day [[Savoy]], and the Burgundians probably lived near ''Lugdunum'', known today as [[Lyon]]. (Wood 1994, Gregory II, 9)  A new king [[Gundioc]] or ''Gunderic'', presumed to be Gundahar's son, appears to have reigned following his father's death. (Drew, p.&nbsp;1) The historian Pline{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} tells us that Gonderic reigned the areas of Saône, Dauphiny, Savoie and a part of Provence. He set up [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] as the capital of the kingdom of Burgundy. In all, eight Burgundian kings of the house of Gundahar ruled until the kingdom was overrun by the Franks in 534.

As allies of Rome in its last decades, the Burgundians fought alongside Aëtius and a confederation of Visigoths and others in the battle against [[Attila the Hun|Attila]] at the [[Battle of Châlons]] (also called "The Battle of the Catalaunian Fields") in 451.  The alliance between Burgundians and Visigoths seems to have been strong, as Gundioc and his brother Chilperic I accompanied [[Theodoric II]] to Spain to fight the Sueves in 455. (Jordanes, ''Getica'', 231)

====Aspirations to the Empire====
Also in 455, an ambiguous reference ''infidoque tibi Burdundio ductu'' ([[Sidonius Apollinaris]] in ''Panegyr. Avit''. 442.) implicates an unnamed treacherous Burgundian leader in the murder of the emperor [[Petronius Maximus]] in the chaos preceding the sack of Rome by the [[Vandals]].  The Patrician [[Ricimer]] is also blamed; this event marks the first indication of the link between the Burgundians and Ricimer, who was probably Gundioc's brother-in-law and [[Gundobad]]'s uncle, (John Malalas, 374)

The Burgundians, apparently confident in their growing power, negotiated in 456 a territorial expansion and power sharing arrangement with the local Roman senators. (Marius of Avenches)

In 457, Ricimer overthrew another emperor, [[Avitus]], raising [[Majorian]] to the throne.  This new emperor proved unhelpful to Ricimer and the Burgundians.  The year after his ascension, Majorian stripped the Burgundians of the lands they had acquired two years earlier. After showing further signs of independence, he was murdered by Ricimer in 461.

Ten years later, in 472, Ricimer&ndash;who was by now the son-in-law of the Western Emperor [[Anthemius]]&ndash;was plotting with Gundobad to kill his father-in-law; Gundobad beheaded the emperor (apparently personally). (''Chronica Gallica 511''; John of Antioch, fr. 209; Jordanes, ''Getica'', 239)  Ricimer then appointed [[Olybrius]]; both died, surprisingly of natural causes, within a few months.  Gundobad seems then to have succeeded his uncle as Patrician and king-maker, and raised [[Glycerius]] to the throne. (Marius of Avenches; John of Antioch, fr. 209)

In 474, Burgundian influence over the empire seems to have ended. Glycerius was deposed in favor of [[Julius Nepos]], and Gundobad returned to Burgundy, presumably at the death of his father Gundioc.  At this time or shortly afterward, the Burgundian kingdom was divided between Gundobad and his brothers, Godigisel, Chilperic II, and Gundomar I. (Gregory, II, 28)

====Consolidation of the Kingdom====
[[File:Conquests of Clovis.png|thumbnail|Kingdom of the Burgundians in around 500]]
According to [[Gregory of Tours]], the years following Gundobad's return to Burgundy saw a bloody consolidation of power. Gregory states that Gundobad murdered his brother Chilperic, drowning his wife and exiling their daughters (one of whom was to become the wife of [[Clovis I|Clovis]] the [[Franks|Frank]], and was reputedly responsible for his conversion).<ref>Gregory, II, 28. Gregory's chronology of the events surrounding Clovis and Gundobad has been questioned by Bury, Shanzer, and Wood, among others. Gregory was somewhat of a Frankish apologist, and commonly discredited the enemies of Clovis by attributing to them some fairly shocking acts.  As with Godegisel, he also commonly refers to the treachery of Clovis' allies, when in fact Clovis seems to have bought them off (e.g., in the case of the Ripuarians).</ref> This is contested by, e.g., Bury, who points out problems in much of Gregory's chronology for the events.

C.500, when Gundobad and Clovis were at war, Gundobad appears to have been betrayed by his brother Godegisel, who joined the Franks; together Godegisel's and Clovis' forces "crushed the army of Gundobad." (Marius a. 500; Gregory, II, 32)  Gundobad was temporarily holed up in Avignon, but was able to re-muster his army and sacked Vienne, where Godegisel and many of his followers were put to death.  From this point, Gundobad appears to have been the sole king of Burgundy. (e.g., Gregory, II, 33)  This would imply that his brother Gundomar was already dead, though there are no specific mentions of the event in the sources.

Either Gundobad and Clovis reconciled their differences, or Gundobad was forced into some sort of vassalage by Clovis' earlier victory, as the Burgundian king appears to have assisted the Franks in 507 in their victory over [[Alaric II]] the Visigoth.

During the upheaval, sometime between 483-501, Gundobad began to set forth the ''Lex Gundobada'' (see below), issuing roughly the first half, which drew upon the ''Lex Visigothorum''. (Drew, p.&nbsp;1)  Following his consolidation of power, between 501 and his death in 516, Gundobad issued the second half of his law, which was more originally Burgundian.

====Fall====
[[File:Map Burgundian Kingdom 2 EN.png|thumb|right|230px|Burgundy as part of the Frankish Empire between 534 and 843]]

The Burgundians were extending their power over southeastern [[Gaul]]; that is, northern Italy, western Switzerland, and southeastern France. In 493 [[Clovis I|Clovis]], king of the Franks, married the Burgundian princess [[Clotilde|Clotilda]] (daughter of Chilperic), who converted him to the Catholic faith.

At first allied with [[Clovis I|Clovis']] [[Franks]] against the [[Visigoths]] in the early 6th century, the Burgundians were eventually conquered at [[Battle of Autun (532)|Autun]] by the Franks in 532 after a first attempt in the [[Battle of Vézeronce]]. The Burgundian kingdom was made part of the [[Merovingian]] kingdoms, and the Burgundians themselves were by and large absorbed as well.

The '''Burgundian language''' belonged to the [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic language group]]. It appears to have become extinct during the late sixth century.<ref name=Lockwood>W.B. Lockwood, "A Panorama of Indo-European Languages"</ref>

Little is known of the language. Some proper names of Burgundians are recorded, and some words used in the area in modern times are thought to be derived from the ancient Burgundian language,<ref name=Lockwood/> but it is often difficult to distinguish these from Germanic words of other origin, and in any case the modern form of the words is rarely suitable to infer much about the form in the old language.

==Culture==

===Religion===
Somewhere in the east the Burgundians had converted to the [[Arianism|Arian]] form of Christianity from their native [[Germanic polytheism]]. Their Arianism proved a source of suspicion and distrust between the Burgundians and the Catholic Western Roman Empire. Divisions were evidently healed or healing circa AD 500, however, as [[Gundobad]], one of the last Burgundian kings, maintained a close personal friendship with [[Avitus of Vienne|Avitus]], the [[bishop of Vienne]].  Moreover, Gundobad's son and successor, [[Sigismund of Burgundy|Sigismund]], was himself a Catholic, and there is evidence that many of the Burgundian people had converted by this time as well, including several female members of the ruling family.

===Law===
The Burgundians left three [[legal code]]s, among the earliest from any of the Germanic tribes.

The '''[[Lex Gundobada|Liber Constitutionum sive Lex Gundobada]]''' (''The Book of the Constitution following the Law of Gundobad''), also known as the ''Lex Burgundionum'', or more simply the ''Lex Gundobada'' or the ''Liber'', was issued in several parts between 483 and 516, principally by Gundobad, but also by his son, Sigismund. (Drew, p.&nbsp;6-7)  It was a record of Burgundian customary law and is typical of the many Germanic law codes from this period.  In particular, the ''Liber'' borrowed from the ''[[Lex Visigothorum]]'' (Drew, p.&nbsp;6) and influenced the later ''[[Lex Ribuaria]]''. (Rivers, p.&nbsp;9)  The ''Liber'' is one of the primary sources for contemporary Burgundian life, as well as the history of its kings.

Like many of the Germanic tribes, the Burgundians' legal traditions allowed the application of separate laws for separate ethnicities.  Thus, in addition to the ''Lex Gundobada'', Gundobad also issued (or codified) a set of laws for Roman subjects of the Burgundian kingdom, the ''[[Lex Romana Burgundionum]]'' (''The Roman Law of the Burgundians'').

In addition to the above codes, Gundobad's son Sigismund later published the ''Prima Constitutio''.  <!--''&ndash;I have been unable to find a source for this &ndash;[[User:Ryanmcdaniel|Ryan McDaniel]]'' -->
