'''Behavior''' or '''behaviour''' is the range of actions and mannerisms made by [[organism]]s, [[systems]], or [[Artificial Intelligence|artificial entities]] in conjunction with their environment, which includes the other systems or organisms around as well as the physical environment. It is the response of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs, whether [[internal]] or [[external]], [[conscious]] or [[subconscious]], [[Openness|overt]] or [[covert]], and [[voluntary]] or [[involuntary]].

{{main|Ethology}}
Although there is some disagreement as to how to precisely define behavior in a biological context, one common interpretation based on a meta-analysis of scientific literature states that "behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Levitis|first=Daniel|coauthors=William Z. Lidicker, Jr, Glenn Freund|title=Behavioural biologists do not agree on what constitutes behaviour|journal=Animal Behaviour|year=2009|month=June|issue=78|url=http://academic.reed.edu/biology/courses/bio342/2010_syllabus/2010_readings/levitis_etal_2009.pdf}}</ref> 

Behaviors can be either [[innate]] or learned. 

Behavior can be regarded as any action of an organism that changes its relationship to its environment. Behavior provides outputs from the organism to the environment.<ref>Dusenbery, David B. (2009).

===Human behavior===
{{main|Human behavior}}
Human behavior is believed to be controlled primarily by the [[endocrine system]] and the [[nervous system]]. It is most commonly believed that complexity in the behavior of an organism is correlated to the complexity of its nervous system. Generally, organisms with more complex nervous systems have a greater capacity to [[learn]] new responses and thus adjust their behavior.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Other fields==
Behavior outside of psychology includes [[physical property]] and [[chemical reactions]].

===Earth sciences===
In environmental [[environmental science|modeling]] and especially in [[hydrology]], a "behavioral model" means a model that is acceptably [[consistent]] with observed natural processes, i.e., that [[simulate]]s well, for example, observed [[discharge (hydrology)|river discharge]]. It is a key concept of the so-called Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation ([[GLUE (uncertainty assessment)|GLUE]]) methodology to quantify how uncertain environmental [[predictions]] are.
