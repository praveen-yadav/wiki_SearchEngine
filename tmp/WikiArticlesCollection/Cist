A cist may have been associated with other monuments, perhaps under a [[cairn]] or long [[tumulus|barrow]].  It would not be uncommon to find several cists close together within the same cairn or barrow. Often ornaments have been found within an excavated cist, indicating the wealth or prominence of the interred individual.

In Devonshire a local word for a cist in [[Cornish language|Modern Cornish]] is ''[[kistvaen]]''. There are numerous [[Dartmoor kistvaens]].

In the [[Welsh language]] (whose origins, like Cornish, are from the ancient British or [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] language line), ''cist'' is also used for such ancient graves, but in modern use, can also mean a chest, a coffer, a box,<ref>http://www.geiriadur.net/index.php?page=ateb&term=Cist&direction=we&type=all&whichpart=exact</ref> or even the boot / trunk of a car.<ref>http://translate.google.com/#cy|en|cist</ref>
