{{Infobox aluminium}}
'''Aluminium''' (or '''aluminum''') is a [[chemical element]] in the [[boron group]] with symbol&nbsp;'''Al''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;13. It is a silvery white, soft, ductile [[metal]]. Aluminium is [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|the third most abundant element]] (after [[oxygen]] and [[silicon]]), and the [[element abundance|most abundant metal]], in the [[Earth]]'s [[crust (geology)|crust]]. It makes up about 8% by weight of the Earth's solid surface. Aluminium metal is so chemically reactive that [[Native metal|native specimens]] are rare and limited to extreme [[Redox|reducing]] environments. Instead, it is found combined in over 270 different [[mineral]]s.<ref>

Aluminium is remarkable for the metal's low [[density]] and for its ability to resist [[corrosion]] due to the phenomenon of [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]. Structural components made from aluminium and its [[aluminium alloy|alloys]] are vital to the [[aerospace]] industry and are important in other areas of [[transport]]ation and structural materials. The most useful compounds of aluminium, at least on a weight basis, are the [[oxides]] and [[sulfates]].

Despite its prevalence in the environment, aluminium [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] are not known to be used by any form of life. In keeping with its pervasiveness, aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals.<ref name=Ullmann/> Owing to their prevalence, potential beneficial (or otherwise) biological roles of aluminium compounds are of continuing interest.

===Physical===
Aluminium is a relatively soft, durable, lightweight, [[ductility|ductile]] and [[malleable]] [[metal]] with appearance ranging from silvery to dull gray, depending on the surface roughness. It is nonmagnetic and does not easily ignite. A fresh film of aluminium serves as a good reflector (approximately 92%) of [[visible light]] and an excellent reflector (as much as 98%) of medium and far [[infrared]] radiation. The [[yield (engineering)|yield strength]] of pure aluminium is 7–11 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]], while [[aluminium alloy]]s have yield strengths ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa.<ref name="polmear">

===Chemical===
[[Corrosion]] resistance can be excellent due to a thin surface layer of [[aluminium oxide]] that forms when the metal is exposed to air, effectively preventing further [[oxidation]]. The strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to [[galvanic cell|galvanic]] reactions with alloyed [[copper]].<ref name="polmear" /> This corrosion resistance is also often greatly reduced by aqueous salts, particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals.

Owing to its resistance to corrosion, aluminium is one of the few metals that retain silvery reflectance in finely powdered form, making it an important component of [[silver (color)|silver-colored]] paints. Aluminium mirror finish has the highest [[reflectance]] of any metal in the 200–400&nbsp;nm ([[ultraviolet|UV]]) and the 3,000–10,000&nbsp;nm (far [[infrared|IR]]) regions; in the 400–700&nbsp;nm visible range it is slightly outperformed by [[tin]] and [[silver]] and in the 700–3000 (near IR) by [[silver]], [[gold]], and [[copper]].<ref>

Aluminium is [[oxidized]] by [[water]] to produce [[hydrogen]] and heat:
:2 Al + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O → Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>
This conversion is of interest for the production of hydrogen. Challenges include circumventing the formed oxide layer which inhibits the reaction and the expenses associated with the storage of energy by regeneration of the Al metal.<ref>{{cite web|date=January 1, 2008|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/aluminium_water_hydrogen.pdf| title=Reaction of Aluminum with Water to Produce Hydrogen| publisher=U.S. Department of Energy}}</ref>

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of aluminium}}
Aluminium has many known [[isotope]]s, whose mass numbers range from 21 to 42; however, only <sup>27</sup>Al ([[stable isotope]]) and <sup>26</sup>Al ([[radioactive decay|radioactive]] isotope, [[half-life|''t''<sub>1/2</sub>]]&nbsp;= 7.2×10<sup>5</sup> [[year|y]]) occur naturally. <sup>27</sup>Al has a natural abundance above 99.9%. <sup>26</sup>Al is produced from [[argon]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] by [[spallation]] caused by [[cosmic-ray]] [[proton]]s. Aluminium isotopes have found practical application in dating [[ocean|marine]] sediments, manganese nodules, glacial ice, [[quartz]] in [[rock (geology)|rock]] exposures, and [[meteorite]]s. The ratio of <sup>26</sup>Al to <sup>10</sup>[[beryllium|Be]] has been used to study the role of transport, deposition, [[sediment]] storage, burial times, and erosion on 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> year time scales.<ref>

Meteorite research has also shown that <sup>26</sup>Al was relatively abundant at the time of formation of our planetary system.

==Production and refinement==
{{See also|Category:Aluminium minerals|List of countries by aluminium production}}
[[File:Bauxite hérault.JPG|thumb|right|Bauxite, a major aluminium ore. The red-brown colour is due to the presence of [[iron]] minerals.]]

Aluminium forms strong [[chemical bond]]s with oxygen. Compared to most other metals, it is difficult to extract from ore, such as [[bauxite]], due to the high reactivity of aluminium and the high melting point of most of its ores. For example, direct reduction with [[carbon]], as is used to produce [[iron]], is not chemically possible because aluminium is a stronger reducing agent than carbon. Indirect carbothermic reduction can be carried out using carbon and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which forms an intermediate Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> and this can further yield aluminium metal at a temperature of 1900–2000 °C. This process is still under development; it requires less energy and yields less CO<sub>2</sub> than the [[Hall-Héroult process]], the major industrial process for aluminium extraction.<ref>

}}</ref> Electrolytic smelting of alumina was originally cost-prohibitive in part because of the high melting point of alumina, or aluminium oxide, (about {{convert|2000|°C|-2|abbr=on}}). Many minerals, however, will dissolve into a second already molten mineral, even if the temperature of the melt is significantly lower than the melting point of the first mineral. Molten [[cryolite]] was discovered to dissolve alumina at temperatures significantly lower than the melting point of pure alumina without interfering in the smelting process. In the [[Hall-Héroult process]], alumina is first dissolved into molten cryolite with [[calcium fluoride]] and then electrolytically reduced to aluminium at a temperature between 950 and 980 °C (1,740 to 1,800 °F). Cryolite is a chemical compound of aluminium and [[sodium]] [[fluoride]]s: (Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>). Although cryolite is found as a mineral in [[Greenland]], its synthetic form is used in the industry. The aluminium oxide itself is obtained by refining bauxite in the [[Bayer process]].

The electrolytic process replaced the [[Wöhler process]], which involved the reduction of anhydrous aluminium chloride with [[potassium]]. Both of the [[electrode]]s used in the electrolysis of aluminium oxide are carbon. Once the refined alumina is dissolved in the electrolyte, it disassociates and its ions are free to move around. The reaction at the [[cathode]] is:

: Al<sup>3+</sup> + 3 e<sup>−</sup> → Al

Here the aluminium ion is being [[redox|reduced]]. The aluminium metal then sinks to the bottom and is tapped off, usually cast into large blocks called [[Bar stock|aluminium billets]] for further processing.

At the [[anode]], oxygen is formed:
: 2 O<sup>2−</sup> → O<sub>2</sub> + 4 e<sup>−</sup>

To some extent, the carbon anode is consumed by subsequent reaction with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. The anodes in a reduction cell must therefore be replaced regularly, since they are consumed in the process. The cathodes do erode, mainly due to electrochemical processes and metal movement. After five to ten years, depending on the current used in the electrolysis, a cell has to be rebuilt because of cathode wear.

[[File:Aluminium - world production trend.svg|thumb|World production trend of aluminium]]

Aluminium electrolysis with the [[Hall-Héroult]] process consumes a lot of energy, but alternative processes were always found to be less viable economically and/or ecologically. The worldwide average specific energy consumption is approximately 15±0.5 [[kilowatt-hour]]s per kilogram of aluminium produced (52 to 56 [[megajoule|MJ]]/kg). The most modern smelters achieve approximately 12.8&nbsp;kW·h/kg (46.1 MJ/kg). (Compare this to the [[heat of reaction]], 31 MJ/kg, and the [[Gibbs free energy]] of reaction, 29 MJ/kg.) Reduction line currents for older technologies are typically 100 to 200 [[kiloampere]]s; state-of-the-art smelters operate at about 350 kA. Trials have been reported with 500 kA cells.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The Hall-Heroult process produces aluminium with a purity of above 99%. Further purification can be done by the [[Hoope process]]. The process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium, barium and aluminium fluoride electrolyte. The resulting aluminium has a purity of 99.99%.<ref>

Electric power represents about 20% to 40% of the cost of producing aluminium, depending on the location of the smelter.

===Recycling===
[[File:41 ALU Recycling Code.svg|150px|thumb|Aluminium [[recycling code]]]]
{{Main|Aluminium recycling}}
Aluminium is theoretically 100% recyclable without any loss of its natural qualities. According to the [[International Resource Panel]]'s [[Metal Stocks in Society report]], the global [[per capita]] stock of aluminium in use in society (i.e. in cars, buildings, electronics etc.) is 80&nbsp;kg. Much of this is in more-developed countries (350–500&nbsp;kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (35&nbsp;kg per capita). Knowing the per capita stocks and their approximate lifespans is important for planning recycling.

Recovery of the metal via [[recycling]] has become an important use of the aluminium industry. Recycling was a low-profile activity until the late 1960s, when the growing use of aluminium [[beverage can]]s brought it to the public awareness.

Recycling involves melting the scrap, a process that requires only 5% of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore, though a significant part (up to 15% of the input material) is lost as [[dross]] (ash-like oxide).<ref>

Recycled aluminium is known as secondary aluminium, but maintains the same physical properties as primary aluminium. Secondary aluminium is produced in a wide range of formats and is employed in 80% of alloy injections. Another important use is for extrusion.

White dross from primary aluminium production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be extracted industrially.<ref>

==Compounds==

===Oxidation state +3===
The vast majority of compounds, including all Al-containing minerals and all commercially significant aluminium compounds, feature aluminium in the oxidation state 3+. The coordination number of such compounds varies, but generally Al<sup>3+</sup> is six-coordinate or tetracoordinate. Almost all compounds of aluminium(III) are colorless.<ref name=Greenwood1997/>

====Halides====
All four trihalides are well known. Unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides, [[aluminium fluoride]] (AlF<sub>3</sub>) features six-coordinate Al. The octahedral coordination environment for AlF<sub>3</sub> is related to the compactness of [[fluoride]] ion, six of which can fit around the small Al<sup>3+</sup> centre. AlF<sub>3</sub> sublimes (with cracking) at {{convert|1291|°C|0|abbr=on}}. With heavier halides, the coordination numbers are lower. The other trihalides are dimeric or polymeric with tetrahedral Al centers. These materials are prepared by treating aluminium metal with the halogen, although other methods exist. Acidification of the oxides or hydroxides affords hydrates. In aqueous solution, the halides often form mixtures, generally containing six-coordinate Al centres, which are feature both halide and [[metal aquo complex|aquo ligands]]. When aluminium and fluoride are together in aqueous solution, they readily form complex ions such as {{chem|[AlF(H|2|O)|5|]|2+}}, {{chem|AlF|3|(H|2|O)|3}}, and {{chem|[AlF|6|]|3-}}. In the case of chloride, polyaluminium clusters are formed such as [Al<sub>13</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>24</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>12</sub>]<sup>7+</sup>.

====Oxide and hydroxides====
Aluminium forms one stable oxide, known by its mineral name [[corundum]]. [[Sapphire]] and [[ruby]] are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals. The two oxide-hydroxides, AlO(OH), are [[boehmite]] and [[diaspore]]. There are three trihydroxides: [[bayerite]], [[gibbsite]], and [[nordstrandite]], which differ in their crystalline structure ([[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]). Most are produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base. Heating the hydroxides leads to formation of corundum. These materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful.

====Carbide, nitride, and related materials====
[[Aluminium carbide]] (Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub>) is made by heating a mixture of the elements above {{convert|1000|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The pale yellow crystals consist of tetrahedral aluminium centres. It reacts with water or dilute acids to give [[methane]]. The [[metal acetylide|acetylide]], Al<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, is made by passing [[acetylene]] over heated aluminium.

[[Aluminium nitride]] (AlN) is the only nitride known for aluminium. Unlike the oxides it features tetrahedral Al centres. It can be made from the elements at {{convert|800|°C|0|abbr=on}}. It is air-stable material with a usefully high [[thermal conductivity]]. [[Aluminium phosphide]] (AlP) is made similarly, and hydrolyses to give [[phosphine]]:

: AlP + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O → Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> + PH<sub>3</sub>

}}</ref> These species usually feature tetrahedral Al centers, e.g. "[[trimethylaluminium]]" has the formula Al<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub> (see figure). With large organic groups, triorganoaluminium exist as three-coordinate monomers, such as [[triisobutylaluminium]]. Such compounds are widely used in industrial chemistry, despite the fact that they are often highly [[pyrophoric]]. Few analogues exist between organoaluminium and organoboron compounds except for large organic groups.

The important aluminium hydride is [[lithium aluminium hydride]] (LiAlH<sub>4</sub>), which is used in as a reducing agent in [[organic chemistry]]. It can be produced from [[lithium hydride]] and aluminium trichloride:

: 4 LiH + AlCl<sub>3</sub> → LiAlH<sub>4</sub> + 3 LiCl

Several useful derivatives of LiAlH<sub>4</sub> are known, e.g. [[Red-Al|sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)dihydridoaluminate]]. The simplest hydride, [[aluminium hydride]] or alane, remains a laboratory curiosity. It is a polymer with the formula (AlH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>''n''</sub>, in contrast to the corresponding boron hydride with the formula (BH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.

===Oxidation states +1 and +2===
Although the great majority of aluminium compounds feature Al<sup>3+</sup> centers, compounds with lower oxidation states are known and sometime of significance as precursors to the Al<sup>3+</sup> species.

====Aluminium(I)====
AlF, AlCl and AlBr exist in the gaseous phase when the trihalide is heated with aluminium. The composition AlI is unstable at room temperature with respect to the triiodide:<ref name=al1/>

: 3 AlI → AlI<sub>3</sub> + 2 Al

A stable derivative of aluminium monoiodide is the cyclic [[adduct]] formed with [[triethylamine]], Al<sub>4</sub>I<sub>4</sub>(NEt<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>. Also of theoretical interest but only of fleeting existence are Al<sub>2</sub>O and Al<sub>2</sub>S.

* Some guitar models sport aluminium diamond plates on the surface of the instruments, usually either chrome or black. [[Kramer Guitars]] and [[Travis Bean]] are both known for having produced guitars with necks made of aluminium, which gives the instrument a very distinct sound.

Aluminium is usually alloyed – it is used as pure metal only when corrosion resistance and/or workability is more important than strength or hardness. A thin layer of aluminium can be deposited onto a flat surface by [[physical vapour deposition]] or (very infrequently) [[chemical vapour deposition]] or other chemical means to form [[optical coating]]s and [[mirror]]s.

===Aluminium compounds===
Because aluminium is abundant and most of its derivatives exhibit low toxicity, the compounds of aluminium enjoy wide and sometimes large-scale applications.

====Alumina====
{{main|Aluminium oxide}}
[[Aluminium oxide]] (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and the associated oxy-hydroxides and trihydroxides are produced or extracted from minerals on a large scale. The great majority of this material is converted to metallic aluminium. About 10% of the production capacity is used for other applications. A major use is as an absorbent, for example alumina will remove water from hydrocarbons, to enable subsequent processes that are poisoned by moisture. Aluminium oxides are common catalysts for industrial processes, e.g. the [[Claus process]] for converting [[hydrogen sulfide]] to sulfur in [[refineries]] and for the [[alkylation]] of [[amine]]s. Many industrial catalysts are [[catalyst support|"supported"]], meaning generally that an expensive catalyst (e.g., [[platinum]]) is dispersed over a high surface area material such as alumina. Being a very hard material ([[Mohs hardness]] 9), alumina is widely used as an abrasive and the production of applications that exploit its inertness, e.g., in [[high pressure sodium]] lamps.

====Sulfates====
Several sulfates of aluminium find applications. [[Aluminium sulfate]] (Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>18</sub>) is produced on the annual scale of several billions of kilograms. About half of the production is consumed in [[water treatment]]. The next major application is in the manufacture of paper. It is also used as a mordant, in [[fire extinguisher]], as a food additive, in fireproofing, and in leather tanning. Aluminium ammonium sulfate, which is also called [[ammonium alum]], (NH<sub>4</sub>)Al(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·12H<sub>2</sub>O, is used as a [[mordant]] and in [[leather]] tanning.<ref name=Ullmann>

}}</ref> Aluminium potassium sulfate ([Al(K)](SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>12</sub> is used similarly. The consumption of both alums is declining.

====Chlorides====
[[Aluminium chloride]] (AlCl<sub>3</sub>) is used in [[petroleum]] [[refining]] and in the production of synthetic [[rubber]] and polymers. Although it has a similar name, [[aluminium chlorohydrate]] has fewer and very different applications, e.g. as a hardening agent and an [[antiperspirant]]. It is an intermediate in the production of aluminium metal.

====Niche compounds====
Given the scale of aluminium compounds, a small scale application could still involve thousands of tonnes. One of the many compounds used at this intermediate level include [[aluminium acetate]], a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] used in solution as an [[astringent]]. [[Aluminium borate]] (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>·B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is used in the production of [[glass]] and [[ceramic]]s. [[Aluminium fluorosilicate]] (Al<sub>2</sub>(SiF<sub>6</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) is used in the production of synthetic [[gemstone]]s, glass and ceramic. [[Aluminium phosphate]] (AlPO<sub>4</sub>) is used in the manufacture: of glass and ceramic, [[Wood pulp|pulp]] and paper products, [[cosmetics]], paints and [[varnish]]es and in making dental [[cement]]. [[Aluminium hydroxide]] (Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>) is used as an [[antacid]], as a mordant, in [[water]] purification, in the manufacture of glass and ceramic and in the waterproofing of fabrics. [[Lithium aluminium hydride]] is a powerful reducing agent used in [[organic chemistry]]. [[Organoaluminium chemistry|Organoaluminiums]] are used as [[Lewis acid]]s and cocatalysts. For example, [[methylaluminoxane]] is a cocatalyst for [[Ziegler-Natta]] [[olefin]] [[polymerization]] to produce [[vinyl polymer]]s such as [[polyethene]].

Aqueous aluminium ions (such as found in aqueous aluminium sulfate) are used to treat against fish parasites such as ''[[Gyrodactylus salaris]]''.
* In many vaccines, certain aluminium salts serve as an immune [[Immunologic adjuvant|adjuvant]] (immune response booster) to allow the protein in the vaccine to achieve sufficient potency as an immune stimulant.

===Aluminium alloys in structural applications===
{{Main|Aluminium alloy}}
[[File:Aluminium foam.jpg|thumb|[[Aluminium foam]]]]

Aluminium alloys with a wide range of properties are used in engineering structures. Alloy systems are classified by a number system ([[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]]) or by names indicating their main alloying constituents ([[DIN]] and [[International Organization of Standardization|ISO]]).

The strength and durability of aluminium alloys vary widely, not only as a result of the components of the specific alloy, but also as a result of heat treatments and manufacturing processes. A lack of knowledge of these aspects has from time to time led to improperly designed structures and gained aluminium a bad reputation.

One important structural limitation of aluminium alloys is their [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] strength. Unlike steels, aluminium alloys have no well-defined [[fatigue limit]], meaning that fatigue failure eventually occurs, under even very small cyclic loadings. This implies that engineers must assess these loads and design for a [[Fatigue (material)#Design against fatigue|fixed life]] rather than an infinite life.

Another important property of aluminium alloys is their sensitivity to heat. Workshop procedures involving heating are complicated by the fact that aluminium, unlike steel, melts without first glowing red. Forming operations where a [[blow torch]] is used therefore require some expertise, since no visual signs reveal how close the material is to melting. Aluminium alloys, like all structural alloys, also are subject to internal stresses following heating operations such as welding and casting. The problem with aluminium alloys in this regard is their low [[melting point]], which make them more susceptible to distortions from thermally induced stress relief. Controlled stress relief can be done during manufacturing by heat-treating the parts in an oven, followed by gradual cooling—in effect [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] the stresses.

The low melting point of aluminium alloys has not precluded their use in rocketry; even for use in constructing combustion chambers where gases can reach 3500&nbsp;K. The [[RM-81 Agena|Agena]] upper stage engine used a regeneratively cooled aluminium design for some parts of the nozzle, including the thermally critical throat region.

Another alloy of some value is [[aluminium bronze]] (Cu-Al alloy).

==History==
[[File:Eros-piccadilly-circus.jpg|thumb|right|The statue of the [[Anteros]] (commonly mistaken for either ''The Angel of Christian Charity'' or ''Eros'') in [[Piccadilly Circus]], London, was made in 1893 and is one of the first statues to be cast in aluminium.]]

Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used aluminium salts as dyeing mordants and as astringents for dressing wounds; [[alum]] is still used as a [[styptic]].
<!--
There is some reason to believe that Romans stumbled on a technique to refine aluminum, but that the technique was lost. [[Pliny the Elder]] recounts in [[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]] the following tale which has been interpreted<ref>
{{cite web
 |title=Aluminium in history

 |publisher=[[International Aluminium Institute]]
 |accessdate=2012-03-06
}}</ref> as referring to aluminum:

<blockquote>
"One day a goldsmith in Rome was allowed to show the Emperor [[Tiberius]] a dinner plate of a new metal. The plate was very light, and almost as bright as silver. The goldsmith told the Emperor that he had made the metal from plain clay. He also assured the Emperor that only he, himself, and the Gods knew how to produce this metal from clay. The Emperor became very interested, and as a financial expert he was also a little concerned. The Emperor felt immediately, however, that all his treasures of gold and silver would decline in value if people started to produce this bright metal of clay. Therefore, instead of giving the goldsmith the regard expected, he ordered him to be beheaded."
</blockquote>
-->
In 1761, [[Guyton de Morveau]] suggested calling the base alum ''alumine.'' In 1808, [[Humphry Davy]] identified the existence of a metal base of alum, which he at first termed ''alumium'' and later ''aluminum'' (see [[#Etymology|etymology section]], below).

The metal was first produced in 1825 in an impure form by [[Denmark|Danish]] physicist and chemist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]]. He reacted [[anhydrous]] [[aluminium chloride]] with [[potassium]] [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]], yielding a lump of metal looking similar to tin.<ref name="woehler">

By 1895, the metal was being used as a building material as far away as [[Sydney]], Australia in the dome of the [[Chief Secretary's Building]].

With the explosive expansion of the airplane industry during World War I (1914-1917), major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light, strong airframes. They often subsidized factories and the necessary electrical supply systems.<ref>Mats Ingulstad, “‘We Want Aluminum, No Excuses’: Business-Government Relations in the American Aluminum Industry, 1917–1957,” in ''From Warfare to Welfare: Business-Government Relations in the Aluminium Industry,'' ed. Mats Ingulstad and Hans Otto Frøland, 33–68. (Oslo: Tapir Academic Press, 2012.)</ref>

Many navies have used an aluminium [[superstructure]] for their vessels; the 1975 fire aboard [[USS Belknap (CG-26)|USS ''Belknap'']] that gutted her aluminium superstructure, as well as observation of battle damage to British ships during the [[Falklands War]], led to many navies switching to all [[steel]] superstructures. The [[Arleigh Burke class|''Arleigh Burke'' class]] was the first such U.S. ship, being constructed entirely of steel.

[[Aluminium wire]] was once widely used for domestic electrical wiring. Owing to corrosion-induced failures, a number of fires resulted.

==Etymology==
Two variants of the metal's name are in current use, ''aluminium'' and ''aluminum'' (besides the obsolete ''alumium''). The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) adopted ''aluminium'' as the standard international name for the element in 1990 but, three years later, recognized ''aluminum'' as an acceptable variant. Hence their periodic table includes both.<ref>[http://www.iupac.org/highlights/periodic-table-of-the-elements.html IUPAC Periodic Table of the Elements]. iupac.org</ref> IUPAC prefers the use of ''aluminium'' in its internal publications, although nearly as many IUPAC publications use the spelling ''aluminum''.<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?q=aluminum&sitesearch=iupac.org IUPAC Web site publication search for 'aluminum'].</ref>

Most countries use the spelling ''aluminium''. In the United States and Canada, the spelling ''aluminum'' predominates.<ref name=Greenwood1997/><ref>Bremner, John ''Words on Words: A Dictionary for Writers and Others Who Care about Words'', pp. 22–23. ISBN 0-231-04493-3.</ref> The [[Canadian Oxford Dictionary]] prefers ''aluminum'', whereas the Australian [[Macquarie Dictionary]] prefers ''aluminium''. In 1926, the [[American Chemical Society]] officially decided to use ''aluminum'' in its publications; American dictionaries typically label the spelling ''aluminium'' as "chiefly British".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aluminium |title= Aluminium - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary  |accessdate=2013-07-23}}</ref><ref>

The various names all derive from its status as a base of [[alum]].

The earliest citation given in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] for any word used as a name for this element is ''alumium'', which British chemist and inventor [[Humphry Davy]] employed in 1808 for the metal he was trying to isolate electrolytically from the mineral ''[[alumina]]''. The citation is from the journal ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'': "Had I been so fortunate as to have obtained more certain evidences on this subject, and to have procured the metallic substances I was in search of, I should have proposed for them the names of silicium, alumium, zirconium, and glucium."<ref>"alumium", ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Ed. J.A. Simpson and E.S.C. Weiner, second edition Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. OED Online Oxford University Press. Accessed 29 October 2006. Citation is listed as "1808 SIR H. DAVY in Phil. Trans. XCVIII. 353". The ellipsis in the quotation is as it appears in the ''OED'' citation.</ref><ref>

Davy settled on ''aluminum'' by the time he published his 1812 book ''Chemical Philosophy'': "This substance appears to contain a peculiar metal, but as yet Aluminum has not been obtained in a perfectly free state, though alloys of it with other metalline substances have been procured sufficiently distinct to indicate the probable nature of alumina."<ref name=Davy1812>

The ''-ium'' suffix conformed to the precedent set in other newly discovered elements of the time: potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and [[strontium]] (all of which Davy isolated himself). Nevertheless, ''-um'' spellings for elements were not unknown at the time, as for example [[platinum]], known to Europeans since the 16th century, [[molybdenum]], discovered in 1778, and [[tantalum]], discovered in 1802. The ''-um'' suffix is consistent with the universal spelling [[alumina]] for the [[oxide]] (as opposed to aluminia), as [[lanthana]] is the oxide of [[lanthanum]], and [[magnesium oxide|magnesia]], [[ceria]], and [[thoria]] are the oxides of [[magnesium]], [[cerium]], and [[thorium]] respectively.

The spelling used throughout the 19th century by most U.S. chemists was ''aluminium'', but common usage is less clear.<ref name="wwwords">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/aluminium.htm |title=ALUMINIUM VERSUS ALUMINUM: Why two spellings? |author=Quinion, Michael |publisher=World Wide Words |date=December 16, 2000}}, "In the USA, the position was more complicated. Noah Webster's Dictionary of 1828 has only aluminum, though the standard spelling among US chemists throughout most of the 19th century was aluminium; it was the preferred version in The Century Dictionary of 1889 and is the only spelling given in the Webster Unabridged Dictionary of 1913."</ref> The ''aluminum'' spelling is used in the [[Webster's Dictionary]] of 1828. In his advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal 1892, Charles Martin Hall used the ''-um'' spelling, despite his constant use of the ''-ium'' spelling in all the patents<ref name="Hall-patent"/> he filed between 1886 and 1903.<ref>{{cite web |author = Meiers, Peter |publisher = The History of Fluorine, Fluoride and Fluoridation |title = Manufacture of Aluminum |url =http://www.fluoride-history.de/p-aluminum.htm}}</ref> It has consequently been suggested{{whom|date=June 2013}} that the spelling reflects an easier to pronounce word with one fewer syllable, or that the spelling on the flier was a mistake. Hall's domination of production of the metal ensured that the spelling ''aluminum'' became the standard in North America.

Despite its natural abundance, aluminium has no known function in biology. It is remarkably nontoxic, aluminium sulfate having an [[LD50]] of 6207&nbsp;mg/kg (oral, mouse), which corresponds to 500&nbsp;grams for a 80&nbsp;kg person.<ref name=Ullmann/> The extremely low acute toxicity notwithstanding, the health effects of aluminium are of interest in view of the widespread occurrence of the element in the environment and in commerce.

Some toxicity can be traced to deposition in bone and the central nervous system, which is particularly increased in patients with reduced renal function. Because aluminium competes with calcium for absorption, increased amounts of dietary aluminium may contribute to the reduced skeletal mineralization (osteopenia) observed in preterm infants and infants with growth retardation. In very high doses, aluminium can cause [[neurotoxicity]], and is associated with altered function of the [[blood–brain barrier]].<ref>{{cite journal |author = Banks, W.A. |year = 1989 |title = Aluminum-induced neurotoxicity: alterations in membrane function at the blood–brain barrier |journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev |volume = 13 |issue = 1 |pages = 47–53 |doi = 10.1016/S0149-7634(89)80051-X |pmid = 2671833 |last2 = Kastin |first2 = AJ}}</ref> A small percentage of people are [[allergy|allergic]] to aluminium and experience [[contact dermatitis]], [[digestion|digestive]] disorders, [[vomiting]] or other symptoms upon contact or ingestion of products containing aluminium, such as [[deodorant]]s or antacids.

[[Wheat]]'s [[adaptation]] to allow aluminium tolerance is such that the aluminium induces a release of [[organic compound]]s that bind to the harmful aluminium [[cations]]. [[Sorghum]] is believed to have the same tolerance mechanism. The first gene for aluminium tolerance has been identified in wheat.
