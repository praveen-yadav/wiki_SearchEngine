==Biblical history==
In the passage from 1 Samuel, [[Nabal]] demonstrates ingratitude towards [[David]], and Abigail attempts to placate David in order to stop him taking revenge. She gives him food, and speaks to him, urging him not to "have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed" (verse 31, [[NIV]]) and reminding him that [[Yahweh|God]] will make him a "[[Davidic line|lasting dynasty]]" (verse 28). [[Jon Levenson]] calls this an "undeniable [[wikt:adumbration|adumbration]]" of [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]]'s prophecy in [[Covenant (biblical)#Davidic covenant|2 Samuel 7]].<ref name=Levenson>[[Jon D. Levenson]], "1 Samuel 25 as Literature and History," ''[[Catholic Biblical Quarterly|CBQ]]'' 40 [1978] 20.</ref> [[Alice Bach]] notes that Abigail pronounces a "crucial prophecy,"<ref>[[Alice Bach]], "[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=1945&C=1780 The Pleasure of Her Text]," ''[[Union Seminary Quarterly Review]]'' 43 [1989] 44.</ref> and the [[Talmud]] regards her as one of the [[Tanakh]]'s seven female prophets.<ref>[[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] [http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Megilah.pdf 14a]</ref> Levenson, however, suggests that she "senses the drift of history" from intelligence rather than from special revelation.<ref name=Levenson />

After Abigail reveals to Nabal what she has done, "[[Yahweh]] struck Nabal and he died," (v.38), after which David married her.

The text explicitly describes Abigail as "intelligent and beautiful" (1 Samuel 25:3, [[NIV]], also in the [[JPS Tanakh]]). The [[Talmud]] amplifies this idea, mentioning her as being one of the "four women of surpassing beauty in the world."<ref>[[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] [http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Megilah.pdf 15a]</ref> In terms of her moral character, [[Abraham Kuyper]] argues that Abigail's conduct indicates "a most appealing character and unwavering faith,"<ref>[[Abraham Kuyper]], ''Women of the Old Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1941), 106.</ref> but Alice Bach regards her as subversive.<ref>Alice Bach, "[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=1945&C=1780 The Pleasure of Her Text]," ''Union Seminary Quarterly Review'' 43 [1989] 41.</ref>

[[Jon D. Levenson|Levenson]] and [[Halpern]] suggest that Abigail may, in fact, also be the same person as [[Abigail (mother of Amasa)|Abigail, mother of Amasa]].<ref>[[Jon D. Levenson]] and [[Baruch Halpern]], "The Political Import of David's Marriages," ''[[Journal of Biblical Literature|JBL]]'' 99 [1980] 511-512.</ref> [[Richard M. Davidson]], however, points out that "on the basis of the final form of Old Testament canon, references to Abigail in the biblical accounts indicate two different individuals."<ref>{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Richard M.|author-link=Richard M. Davidson|title=Flame of Yahweh: A Theology of Sexuality in the Old Testament|year=2007|publisher=Hendrickson|page=444}}</ref>

==Generic use==
Abigail's self-styling as a ''[[handmaid]]''<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|25:25|}} and following</ref> led to ''Abigail'' being the traditional term for a waiting-woman, for example as the ''waiting [[gentlewoman]]'' in [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s ''[[The Scornful Lady]]'', published in 1616. [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Henry Fielding]] use ''Abigail'' in this generic sense, as does [[Charlotte Brontë]]. [[Anthony Trollope]] makes two references to ''the abigail'' (all lower case) in ''[[The Eustace Diamonds]]'', at the beginning of Chapter 42. [[William Rose Benet]] notes the notoriety of [[Abigail Hill]], better known as "Mrs Masham", a [[lady-in-waiting]] to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].<ref>''The Reader's Encyclopedia'', 1948, ''s.v.'' "Abigail".</ref>
