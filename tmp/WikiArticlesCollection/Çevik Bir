He took a major part in several important international missions in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. He was born in [[Buca]], [[Izmir Province]], in 1939 and is married with one child.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |title=Orgeneral Çevik Bir’in Biyografisi |publisher=Türkiye Kalite Derneği |url=http://www.kalder.org/genel/download/12%20Ulusal%20Kalite%20Kongresi/cevik%20-%20bir%20cv-turkce.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061003073946/http://www.kalder.org/genel/download/12%20Ulusal%20Kalite%20Kongresi/cevik%20-%20bir%20cv-turkce.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-03 |accessdate=2012-05-06 |language=Turkish and English}}</ref>

He graduated from the [[Turkish Military Academy]] as an engineer officer in 1958, from the [[Army War College (Turkey)|Army Staff College]] in 1970 and from the [[Armed Forces College (Turkey)|Armed Forces College]] in 1971. He graduated from [[NATO Defense College]], [[Rome, Italy]] in 1973.<ref name=bio/>

From 1973 to 1985, he served at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]], NATO's headquarters in Belgium. He was promoted to [[brigadier general (Turkey)|brigadier general]] and commanded an armed brigade and division in Turkey. From 1987 to 1991, he served as [[major general]], and then was promoted to [[lieutenant general]].<ref name=bio/>

After the dictator [[Siad Barre]]’s ousting, conflicts between the General [[Mohammed Farah Aidid|Farah Aidid's]] party and other clans in [[Somalia]] had led to famine and lawlessness throughout the country. An estimated 300,000 people had died from starvation. A combined military force of [[United States]] and [[United Nations]] (under the name "UNOSOM") were deployed to [[Mogadishu]], to monitor the ceasefire and deliver food and supplies to the starving people of Somali. Çevik Bir, who was then a lieutenant-general of [[Turkey]], became the force commander of [[UNOSOM II]] in 1993.<ref>{{cite web |title=United Nations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II) |publisher=Department of Public Information |url=http://www.un.org/Depts/DPKO/Missions/unosom2b.htm |date=1997-03-21 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref> Despite the retreat of US and UN forces after several deaths due to local hostilities mainly led by Aidid, the introduction of a powerful military force opened the transportation routes, enabling the provision of supplies and ended the famine quickly.

He became a four-star general and served three years as vice chairman of the [[Turkish Armed Forces]], then appointed commander of the [[Turkish First Army]], in Istanbul. While he was vice chairman of the TAF, he signed the Turkish-Israeli Military Coordination agreement in 1996.

Çevik Bir became the Turkish army's deputy chief of general staff shortly after the Somali operation and played a vital role in establishing a Turkish-[[Israel]]i entente against the emerging fundamentalism in the Middle East.
Çevik Bir retired from the army on August 30, 1999.<ref name=bio/> He is a former member of the [[Association for the Study of the Middle East and Africa]] (ASMEA).

On April 12, 2012, Bir and 30 other officers were taken in custody for their role in the [[1997 military memorandum (Turkey)|1997 military memorandum]] that forced the then Turkish government, led by the Refah Partisi ([[Welfare Party]]), to step down.<ref>{{cite news |title=Turkish Military Leaders Held for Role in ’97 Coup |first=Sebnem |last=Arsu |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/world/middleeast/turkey-detains-military-leaders-for-role-in-1997-coup.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-04-12 |accessdate=2012-04-13}}</ref>
