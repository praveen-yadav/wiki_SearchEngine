The term '''clairvoyance''' (from French ''clair'' meaning "clear" and ''voyance'' meaning "vision") is used to refer to the ability to gain information about an object, person, location or physical event through means other than the known human [[sense]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/clairvoyance |title=Merriam-Webster Online dictionary, Retrieved 2007-10-05 "1: the power or faculty of discerning objects not present to the senses 2: ability to perceive matters beyond the range of ordinary perception: penetration" |publisher=Mw1.merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9364105 Britannica Online Encyclopedia], Retrieved 2007-10-07. The ESP entry includes clairvoyance</ref> i.e., a form of [[extra-sensory perception]].  A person said to have the ability of clairvoyance is referred to as a '''clairvoyant''' ("one who sees clearly").

Claims for the existence of [[paranormal]] and [[psychic]] abilities such as clairvoyance have not been supported by scientific evidence published in high [[impact factor]] [[peer reviewed]] journals.<ref name=skepdic1>Carrol, Robert (2003), "[http://www.skepdic.com/clairvoy.html Clairvoyance]" – ''Skeptics Dictionary'', Wiley, ISBN 0-471-27242-6 {{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref> [[Parapsychology]] explores this possibility, but the existence of the paranormal is not accepted by the [[scientific community]].<ref name=skepdic>{{cite web |url=http://www.skepdic.com/clairvoy.html |title=clairvoyance or second sight|publisher=The Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com |work= |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}</ref> Parapsychology, including the study of clairvoyance, is an example of [[pseudoscience]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pseudoscience |title=Dictionary.com "Pseudoscience" |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy "Science and Pseudo-Science" |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date=September 3, 2008 |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/russian.html |title=Science Needs to Combat Pseudoscience: A Statement by 32 Russian Scientists and Philosophers |publisher=Quackwatch.com |date=July 17, 1998 |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csj.org/studyindex/studycrthk/study_pseddoscience/study_factscnfiction5.htm |title=International Cultic Studies Association "Science Fiction in Pseudoscience" |publisher=Csj.org |date= |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref>

==Usage==

Pertaining to the ability of clear-sightedness, clairvoyance refers to the supposed [[paranormal]] ability to see persons and events that are distant in time or space.  It can be divided into roughly three classes: [[retrocognition]], [[premonition]], and the perception of contemporary events happening outside of the range of normal perception.<ref>Melton, J. Gorgon, editor (2001). ''The Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology'', p. 297. Gale Group, Detroit. ISBN 081039488.</ref>

==Status of clairvoyance==
The concept of clairvoyance gained some support from the US and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] governments both during and after the [[Cold War]], and both governments made several attempts to harness it as an intelligence gathering tool.<ref name=Time>{{Cite news|first=Douglas |last=Waller |authorlink=Douglas C. Waller |date=December 11, 1995 |title=The Vision Thing |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983829,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=May 30, 2009|unused_data=mdy}}</ref>

According to skeptics, clairvoyance is the result of fraud, self-[[delusion]],<ref name=skepdic1/> [[Forer effect|Barnum effects]], [[Confirmation bias|confirmatory biases]], or failures to appreciate the base rate of chance occurrences. For example, in a scientific experiment of clairvoyance, a purported clairvoyant participant will inevitably make correct guesses some of the time (i.e., during some of the trials within the same experiment), simply because of chance. Furthermore, because of the nature of the statistical tests used by experimenters, a very small proportion of all experiments conducted will yield an overall statistically significant result (suggesting that clairvoyance took place at above-chance levels), again simply because of chance. A proper summary of the experimental evidence on clairvoyance should include a summary of all experiments that were conducted, taking into account their probabilities of turning out false positive and false negative results, and making sure that studies are not included in the review selectively. Some researchers on clairvoyance have tended to purposefully exclude negative findings from their reviews,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Tart, C. T. |year=1983 |title=Information acquisition rates in forced-choice ESP experiments: precognition does not work as well as present-time ESP |journal=Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research |issn=0003-1070 |volume=77 |issue=4 |pages=293–310}}</ref> thus biasing their own conclusions.

==Clairvoyance and related phenomena throughout history==
There have been [[anecdotal]] reports of clairvoyance and 'clear' abilities throughout history in most cultures.  Often clairvoyance has been associated with religious or [[shaman]]ic figures, offices and practices. For example, ancient Hindu religious texts list clairvoyance amongst other forms of 'clear' experiencing, as [[siddhi]]s, or 'perfections', skills that are yielded through appropriate meditation and personal discipline. But a large number of anecdotal accounts of clairvoyance are of the spontaneous variety among the general populace. For example, many people report seeing a loved one who has recently died before they have learned by other means that their loved one is deceased.  While anecdotal accounts do not provide scientific proof of clairvoyance, such common experiences continue to motivate research into such phenomena.

The earliest record of somnambulistic clairvoyance is credited to the [[Marquis de Puységur]], a follower of [[Mesmer]], who in 1784 was treating a local dull-witted peasant named Victor Race. During treatment, Race reportedly would go into trance and undergo a personality change, becoming fluent and articulate, and giving diagnosis and prescription for his own disease as well as those of others.  When he came out of the trance state he would be unaware of anything he had said or done. This behavior is somewhat reminiscent of the reported behaviors of the 20th century medical clairvoyant and psychic [[Edgar Cayce]]. It is reported that although Puységur used the term 'clairvoyance', he did not think of these phenomena as "[[paranormal]]", since he accepted [[mesmerism]] as one of the natural sciences.

Clairvoyance was a reported ability of some mediums during the [[spiritualist]] period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and psychics of many descriptions have claimed clairvoyant ability up to the present day.

Early researchers of clairvoyance included [[William Gregory (chemist)]], Gustav Pagenstecher, and [[Rudolf Tischner]]. These were largely qualitative experiments in which selected participants sought to identify a concealed target image, or to provide accurate information about the history of a target object. [[Charles Richet]], the noted physiologist and, later, Ina Jephson, a member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]], introduced more quantitative methods. A significant development in clairvoyance research came when [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]], a psychologist at [[Duke University]], introduced a standard methodology, with a standard statistical approach to analysing the data, as part of his research into [[extrasensory perception]]. Perhaps the best-known study of clairvoyance in recent times has been the US government-funded [[remote viewing]] project at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]]/[[Science Applications International Corporation|SAIC]] during the 1970s through the mid-1990s; at least those studies amongst these that did not involve "agents" visiting or being otherwise aware of the target sites.

Some parapsychologists{{who|date=May 2012}} have proposed that our different functional labels (clairvoyance, [[telepathy]], [[precognition]], etc.) all refer to one basic underlying mechanism, although there is not yet any satisfactory theory for what that mechanism may be.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Parapsychological research==
Although some parapsychological research studies of [[remote viewing]] and clairvoyance have produced favorable results significantly above chance, the overwhelming majority have not found support for either.  For instance, at the [[Stanford Research Institute]], in 1972, [[Harold Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]] initiated a series of human subject studies to determine whether participants (the ''viewers'' or ''percipients'') could reliably identify and accurately describe salient features of remote locations or ''targets''. In the early studies, a human ''sender'' was typically present at the remote location, as part of the experiment protocol. A three-step process was used, the first step being to randomly select the target conditions to be experienced by the senders. Secondly, in the viewing step, participants were asked to verbally express or sketch their impressions of the remote scene. Thirdly, in the judging step, these descriptions were matched by separate judges, as closely as possible, with the intended targets. The term [[remote viewing]] was coined to describe this overall process.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Targ and Puthoff both believed that [[Uri Geller]], retired police commissioner Pat Price and artist [[Ingo Swann]] all had genuine psychic abilities.<ref>''Mind-Reach: Scientists Look at Psychic Abilities,'' by Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, Dell Pub Co., 1978</ref> They published their findings in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''<ref>R. Targ, and H,E, Puthoff, H.E "Information transfer under conditions of sensory shielding," ''Nature'', 251, 602-607. (1974).</ref> and the ''[[Proceedings of the IEEE]]''.<ref>Puthoff, H.E. and Targ, R. "A Perceptual Channel for Information Transfer over kilometer distances: Historical perspective and recent research." ''Proc. IEEE,'' Vol. 64, no. 3, 329-254. (1976)</ref> Their work however met criticism from a number of writers, such as psychologists [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] and [[Richard Kammann]] in their 1980 book ''[[The Psychology of the Psychic]]''.<ref>Marks, D. and Kammann, R., (1980) ''The Psychology of the Psychic'', p26. Prometheus Books. ISBN 1-57392-798-8</ref>

In order to explore the nature of remote viewing channel, the viewer in some experiments was secured in a double-walled copper-screened [[Faraday cage]]. Although this provided attenuation of radio signals over a broad range of frequencies, the researchers found that it did not alter the subject's remote viewing capability. They postulated that [[extremely low frequency]] (ELF) propagation might be involved, since Faraday cage screening is less effective in the ELF range. Such a hypothesis had previously been put forward by telepathy researchers in the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=kogan>{{Cite journal|author=Kogan I |title=Information theory analysis of telepathic communication experiments |journal=Telecommunications and Radio Engineering |volume=23 |issue=2 |month=March |year=1968 |pages=122–125 |issn=0040-2508}}</ref>

The first paper by Puthoff and Targ on psychic research to appear in a mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journal was published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in March 1974; in it, the team reported some degree of remote viewing success.<ref name=nat251>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/251602a0 |title=Information transmission under conditions of sensory shielding |year=1974 |first=Russel |last=Targ |coauthors=Harold Puthoff |journal=Nature |volume=251 |pages=602–607 |pmid=4423858 |issue=5476}}</ref> One of the individuals involved in these initial studies at SRI was [[Uri Geller]], a well-known celebrity psychic at the time. The research team reported witnessing some of Geller's trademark metal spoon-bending performances, but admitted that they were unable to conduct adequately controlled experiments to confirm any paranormal hypothesis about them.

[[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) techniques were also used by team to examine ESP phenomena. In these investigations, a sender, who was isolated in a visually opaque, electrically and acoustically shielded chamber, was stimulated at random by bursts of strobe-light flickers The experimenters reported that, for one receiver, differential alpha block on control and stimulus trials were observed, which showed that some information transfer had occurred. In contrast, this person's expressed statements of when the stimulus occurred were no different than that which would be expected by chance. The researches were unable to identify the physical parameters by which the EEG effect was mediated.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=4468758 |year=1974 |month=April |author=Rebert, CS; Turner, A |title=EEG spectrum analysis techniques applied to the problem of psi phenomena |volume=6 |issue=1–12 |pages=18–24 |issn=0005-7932 |journal=Behavioral neuropsychiatry}}</ref>

After the publication of these findings, various attempts to replicate the remote viewing findings were quickly carried out. Several of these follow-up studies, which involved viewing in group settings, reported some limited success. They included the use of face-to-face groups,<ref name=hast1>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10369 |title=A confirmatory remote viewing experiment in a group setting |year=1976 |month=October |author=Hastings, A.C. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1544–1545 |last2=Hurt |first2=D.B.|issue=10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10371 |title=Preliminary experiments in group 'Remote viewing' |year=1976 |month=October |author=Whitson, T.W. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1550–1551 |last2=Bogart |first2=D.N. |last3=Palmer |first3=J. |last4=Tart |first4=C.T.|issue=10}}</ref> and remotely-linked groups using computer conferencing.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10372 |title=Remote viewing experiments through computer conferencing |year=1976 |month=October |author=Vallee, J. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1551–1552 |last2=Hastings |first2=A.C. |last3=Askevold |first3=G.|issue=10}}</ref>

The various debates in the mainstream scientific literature prompted the editors of 'Proceedings of the IEEE' to invite [[Robert Jahn]], then Dean of the School of Engineering at [[Princeton University]], to write a comprehensive review of psychic phenomena from an engineering perspective. His paper,<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1982.12260 |title=The persistent paradox of psychic phenomena: An engineering perspective |year=1982 |month=February |author=Jahn, R.G. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=70 |pages=136–170|issue=2}}</ref> published in February 1982, includes numerous references to remote viewing replication studies at the time.

Clairvoyance experiments involving [[Zener cards]] currently exist on the [[Internet]]. One such online system, the Anima Project,<ref name="Anima">{{cite web|url=http://www.animaproject.org |title=The Anima Project |accessdate=April 8, 2008 }}</ref> gathers user results into a master database which is then analyzed using a variety of statistical techniques.

==Scientific research==
Parapsychological research is regarded by its critics as a [[pseudoscience]].<ref>Marks, D.F. (2000). ''The Psychology of the Psychic'' (2nd Ed.) New York: Prometheus Books. ISBN 1-57392-798-8 {{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref> In 1988, the [[United States National Research Council|US National Research Council]] concluded that it "...finds no scientific justification from research conducted over a period of 130 years, for the existence of parapsychological phenomena."<ref>[http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/parapsychology.html ''An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural''] James Randi</ref>

[[Scientific skepticism|Skeptics]] say that if clairvoyance were a reality it would have become abundantly clear.  They also contend that those who believe in [[paranormal]] phenomena do so for merely psychological reasons.  According to David G. Myers (''Psychology,'' 8th ed.):

<blockquote>The search for a valid and reliable test of clairvoyance has resulted in thousands of experiments. One controlled procedure has invited 'senders' to telepathically transmit one of four visual images to 'receivers' deprived of sensation in a nearby chamber (Bem & Honorton, 1994). The result? A reported 32 percent accurate response rate, surpassing the chance rate of 25 percent. But follow-up studies have (depending on who was summarizing the results) failed to replicate the phenomenon or produced mixed results (Bem & others, 2001; Milton & Wiseman, 2002; Storm, 2000, 2003).<br /><br />One skeptic, magician [[James Randi]], has a longstanding offer—now [[One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge|U.S. $1 million]]—“to anyone who proves a genuine psychic power under proper observing conditions” (Randi, 1999). French, Australian, and Indian groups have parallel offers of up to 200,000 euros to anyone with demonstrable paranormal abilities (CFI, 2003). Large as these sums are, the scientific seal of approval would be worth far more to anyone whose claims could be authenticated. To refute those who say there is no ESP, one need only produce a single person who can demonstrate a single, reproducible ESP phenomenon. So far, no such person has emerged. Randi’s offer has been publicized for three decades and dozens of people have been tested, sometimes under the scrutiny of an independent panel of judges. Still, nothing.  "People's desire to believe in the paranormal is stronger than all the evidence that it does not exist."  [[Susan Blackmore]], "Blackmore's first law", 2004.</blockquote>

===Psychiatric interpretation===

In mainstream [[psychiatry]] clairvoyance is considered as [[hallucination]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blom|first1=Jan Dirk|title=A Dictionary of Hallucinations|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=qbF44AEMGdcC&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99&dq=clairvoyance+is+hallucination&source=bl&ots=DWUXEwghqR&sig=XhJlAbFciinqaXoKOGVIW-pw1oo&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=tvENT8rOPIWk-ga0ybStBw&ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=clairvoyance%20is%20hallucination&f=false|accessdate=January 11, 2012|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media, LLC|location=New York, Dordrecht, Heidelberg, London|isbn=978-1-4419-1222-0|oclc=|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-1223-7|page=99|quote='''Clairvoyance'''<br><br>Also known as lucidity, telesthesia, and cryptestesia.

==Other related terms==
The words "clairvoyance" and "psychic" are often used to refer to many different kinds of paranormal sensory experiences, but there are more specific names:

===Clairsentience (feeling/touching)===
In the field of parapsychology, '''clairsentience''' is a form of [[extra-sensory perception]] wherein a person acquires [[psychic]] knowledge primarily by feeling.<ref>[http://parapsych.org/historical_terms.html Parapsychological Association historical terms glossary], retrieved 2006-12-17</ref> The word “clair” is French for "clear", and “sentience” is derived from the Latin sentire, “to feel”.

In addition to parapsychology, the term also plays a role in some religions. For example: clairsentience is one of the six human special functions mentioned or recorded in [[Buddhism]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It is an ability that can be obtained at advanced meditation level. Generally the term refers to a person who can feel the vibration of other people. There are many different degrees of clairsentience ranging from the perception of diseases of other people to the thoughts or emotions of other people. The ability differs from [[third eye]] in that this kind of ability cannot have a vivid picture in the mind. Instead, a very vivid feeling can form.

[[Psychometry (paranormal)|Psychometry]] is related to clairsentience. The word stems from ''psyche'' and ''metric'', which means "soul-measuring".<ref>Joseph Rodes Buchanan, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=o0RDAAAAIAAJ&ots=EAuuE0zscq&dq=Manual%20of%20psychometry%20%3A%20the%20dawn%20of%20a%20new%20civilization&pg=PA3 Manual of Psychometry : the Dawn of a New Civilization]'' Boston, Frank H. Hodges (4th edition), 1893 p.3</ref>

===Clairaudience (hearing/listening)===
In the field of parapsychology, '''clairaudience''' [from late 17th century French ''clair'' (clear) and audience (hearing)] is a form of [[extra-sensory perception]] wherein a person acquires information by [[paranormal]] auditory means. It is often considered to be a form of clairvoyance.<ref>[http://parapsych.org/historical_terms.html Parapsychological Association website, Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology], Retrieved 2006-01-24</ref> Clairaudience is essentially the ability to hear in a paranormal manner, as opposed to paranormal seeing (clairvoyance) and feeling ([[clairsentience]]). Clairaudient people have [[Psi (parapsychology)|psi]]-mediated hearing. Clairaudience may refer not to actual perception of sound, but may instead indicate impressions of the "inner mental ear" similar to the way many people think words without having auditory impressions. But it may also refer to actual perception of sounds such as voices, tones, or noises which are not apparent to other humans or to recording equipment.  For instance, a clairaudient person might claim to hear the voices or thoughts of the spirits of persons who are deceased.  In [[Buddhism]], it is believed that those who have extensively practiced [[Buddhist meditation]] and have reached a [[Higher consciousness|higher level of consciousness]] can activate their "third ear" and hear the [[music of the spheres]]; i.e. the music of the celestial [[gandharva]]s.  Clairaudience may be positively distinguished from the voices heard by the mentally ill when it reveals information unavailable to the clairaudient person by normal means (including [[cold reading]] or other magic tricks), and thus may be termed "[[psychic]]" or paranormal.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Clairalience (smelling)===
Also known as '''clairescence.'''  In the field of parapsychology, '''clairalience''' (or alternatively, '''clairolfactance''') [presumably from late 17th century French ''clair'' (clear) and alience (smelling)] is a form of [[extra-sensory perception]] wherein a person accesses psychic knowledge through the physical sense of smell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ghostvillage.com/resources/2003/resources_10132003.shtml |title=Supernatural Glossary |publisher=Ghostvillage.com |date= |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref>

===Claircognizance (knowing)===
In the field of parapsychology, '''claircognizance''' [presumably from late 17th century French ''clair'' (clear) and ''cognizance'' (< [[Middle English|ME]] ''cognisaunce'' < [[Old French|OFr]] ''conoissance'', knowledge)] is a form of [[extra-sensory perception]] wherein a person acquires psychic knowledge primarily by means of intrinsic knowledge. It is the ability to know something without a physical explanation why you know it, like the concept of [[mediumship|mediums]].

===Clairgustance (tasting)===
In the field of parapsychology, '''clairgustance''' is defined as a form of [[extra-sensory perception]] that allegedly allows one to taste a substance without putting anything in one's mouth.  It is claimed that those who possess this ability are able to perceive the essence of a substance from the spiritual or ethereal realms through taste.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
