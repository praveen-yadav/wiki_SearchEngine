{{Conservatism sidebar}}
'''Conservatism''' as a [[political philosophy|political]] and [[social philosophy]] promotes retaining traditional social institutions. A person who follows the philosophies of conservatism is referred to as a '''traditionalist''' or '''conservative. '''

Some conservatives seek to preserve things as they are, emphasizing stability and continuity, while others, called [[reactionary|reactionaries]], oppose modernism and seek a return to "the way things were".<ref>Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, "Conservatism", ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', Third Edition, "Sometimes it (conservatism) has been outright opposition, based on an existing model of society that is considered right for all time.  It can take a 'reactionary' form, harking back to, and attempting to reconstruct, forms of society which existed in an earlier period.", Oxford University Press, 2009, ISBN 978-0-19-920516-5.</ref><ref name="brit">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133435/conservatism|title=Conservatism (political philosophy)|publisher=Britannica.com}} Retrieved on 1&nbsp;November 2009.</ref> The first established use of the term in a political context originated with [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] in 1818,<ref>

during the period of the [[Bourbon restoration]] that sought to roll back the policies of the [[French Revolution]]. The term, historically associated with [[right-wing politics]], has since been used to describe a wide range of views. There is no single set of policies that are universally regarded as conservative, because the meaning of conservatism depends on what is considered traditional in a given place and time. Thus conservatives from different parts of the world—each upholding their respective traditions—may disagree on a wide range of issues.

[[Edmund Burke]], an [[Anglo-Irish]] politician who opposed the French Revolution, is credited as one of the main theorists of [[conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservatism in Great Britain in the 1790s]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank O'Gorman|title=Edmund Burke: His Political Philosophy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U-reNJAnv1oC&pg=PA171|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|page=171|isbn=9780415326841}}</ref> According to [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]], the chairman of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party in 1959]], "Conservatism is not so much a philosophy as an attitude, a constant force, performing a timeless function in the development of a free society, and corresponding to a deep and permanent requirement of human nature itself."<ref>{{cite book|author=Quintin Hogg Baron Hailsham of St. Marylebone|title=The Conservative Case|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=%22+attitude,+a+constant+force,+performing+a+timeless+function+in+the+development+of+a+free+society,+and+corresponding+to+a+deep+and+permanent+requirement+of+human+nature+itself%22&num=10|year=1959|publisher=Penguin Books}}</ref>

==Development of Western conservatism==
===Great Britain===
{{Main|Conservatism in the United Kingdom}}
{{Toryism|Related}}
In Britain conservative ideas (though not yet called that) emerged in the [[Toryism|Tory]] movement, during the English [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period (1660–1688). Toryism supported a hierarchical society with a monarch who ruled by [[Divine right of kings|divine right]].  Tories opposed the idea that sovereignty was derived from the people, and rejected the authority of parliament and freedom of religion. [[Robert Filmer]]'s ''Patriarcha: or the Natural Power of Kings'', which had been written before the [[English Civil War]], became accepted as the statement of their doctrine. However, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 destroyed this principle to some degree by establishing a constitutional government in England, leading to the hegemony of the opposed [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] ideology. Faced with defeat, the Tories reformed their movement, now holding that sovereignty was vested in the three estates of Crown, Lords, and Commons<ref>Eccleshall, pp. ix, 21</ref> rather than solely in the Crown. Toryism became marginalized during the long period of Whig ascendancy in the 18th century.
[[File:Richardhooker.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=photograph|[[Richard Hooker]] (1554–1600)]]
[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797)]]
Conservatives typically see [[Richard Hooker]] as the founding father of conservatism, along with the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]], [[David Hume]] and [[Edmund Burke]]. Halifax promoted pragmatism in government, whilst Hume argued against political [[rationalism]]. Burke was the private secretary to the Marquis of Rockingham and official pamphleteer to the Rockingham branch of the Whig Party.<ref>Stanlis, Peter J. ''Edmund Burke: selected writings and speeches''. New York: Transaction Publishers (2009), p. 18</ref> Together with the Tories, they were the conservatives in the late 18th century United Kingdom.<ref>Auerbach, M. Morton ''The Conservative Illusion''. Columbia University Press (1959), p. 33</ref> Burke's views were a mixture of liberal and conservative, with reference to the meaning of those terms in that time period (which was markedly different from their implications today). He supported the [[American Revolution]] but abhorred the violence of the [[French Revolution]]. He accepted the liberal ideals of private property and the economics of Adam Smith, but thought that economics should be kept subordinate to the conservative social ethic, that capitalism should be subordinate to the medieval social tradition and that the business class should be subordinate to aristocracy.<ref>Auerbach, M. Morton ''The conservative illusion.'' Columbia University Press (1959), p. 40</ref> He insisted on standards of honor derived from the medieval aristocratic tradition, and saw the aristocracy as the nation's natural leaders.<ref>Auerbach, M. Morton ''The Conservative Illusion''. Columbia University Press (1959), p. 37</ref> That meant limits on the powers of the Crown, since he found the institutions of Parliament to be better informed than commissions appointed by the executive.<ref>Auerbach, M. Morton ''The conservative illusion''. Columbia University Press (1959), p. 52</ref> He favored an [[established church]], but allowed for a degree of [[religious toleration]].<ref>Auerbach, M. Morton ''The conservative illusion''. Columbia University Press (1959), pp. 53–54</ref> Burke justified the social order on the basis of tradition: tradition represented the wisdom of the species and he valued community and social harmony over social reforms.<ref>Auerbach, M. Morton ''The conservative illusion.'' Columbia University Press (1959), p. 41</ref> Burke was a leading theorist in this early period, finding extreme idealism (either Tory or Whig) an endangerment to broader liberties, and (like Hume) rejecting "abstract reason" as a guide for political theory.<ref>http://www.wnd.com/2010/08/191121/</ref>
Despite their influence on future conservative thought, none of these early contributors were explicitly involved in Tory politics, which was at that time associated with the illegal [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause. Hooker lived in the 16th century, long before the advent of toryism, whilst Hume was an apolitical philosopher and Halifax similarly politically independent. Burke described himself as a Whig.

Shortly after Burke's death conservatism was revived as a mainstream political force as the Whigs suffered a series of internal divisions. This new generation of conservatives derived their politics from Burke's predecessor, the [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Viscount Bolingbroke]], who was a Jacobite and traditional Tory, lacking Burke's sympathies for Whiggish policies such as [[Catholic Emancipation]] and [[American Revolution|American independence]] (famously attacked by [[Samuel Johnson]] in "Taxation No Tyranny"). During this period [[John Reeves (activist)|John Reeves]] wrote a Tory response to the French Revolution, which is now largely forgotten.<ref>Eccleshall, p. 2</ref>

In the 19th century, conflict between wealthy businessmen and the aristocracy split the British conservative movement, with the aristocracy calling for a return to medieval ideas while the business classes called for laissez-faire capitalism.<ref>Auerbach, M. Morton ''The conservative illusion.'' Columbia University Press (1959), pp. 39–40</ref>

Although conservatives opposed attempts to allow greater representation of the middle class in parliament, in 1834 they conceded that electoral reform could not be reversed and promised to support further reforms so long as they did not erode the institutions of church and state. These new principles were presented in the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] which is considered by historians to be the basic statement of the beliefs of the new Conservative Party.<ref>Eccleshall, pp. 79–80</ref>
[[File:Robert Peel Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=photograph|[[Robert Peel]] (1788–1850)]]

Some conservatives lamented the passing of a pastoral world where the ethos of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' had promoted respect from the lower classes. They saw the [[Anglican Church]] and the aristocracy as balances against commercial wealth.<ref>Eccleshall, p. 83</ref> They worked toward legislation for improved working conditions and urban housing.<ref>Eccleshall, p. 90</ref> This viewpoint would later be called [[Tory Democracy]].<ref>Eccleshall, p. 121</ref> However since Burke there has always been tension between traditional aristocratic conservatism and the wealthy business class.<ref>Eccleshall, pp. 6–7</ref>

In 1835, Tory [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]] issued the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] in which he pledged to endorse moderate political reform. This marked the beginning of the transformation of British conservatism from [[High Tory]] reactionism towards a more modern form based on 'conservation.' The party became known as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] as a result, a name it has retained to this day. Peel, however, would also be the root of a split in the party between the traditional Tories (led by the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]]) and the 'Peelites' (led first by Peel himself, then by the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]]). The split occurred in 1846 over the issue of [[free-trade]], which Peel supported, versus [[protectionism]], supported by Derby. The majority of the party sided with Derby, whilst about a third split away, eventually merging with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and the [[radicalism (politics)|radicals]] to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Despite the split, the mainstream Conservative Party accepted the doctrine of free-trade in 1852.

[[File:Margaret Thatcher.png|thumb|160px|[[Margaret Thatcher]] (1925–2013)]]
In the second half of the century it was the Liberals who were faced with political schisms, the most major being over [[History of Ireland|Irish]] [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Home Rule]]. Leader [[William Gladstone]] (himself a former Peelite) sought to give Ireland a degree of autonomy, a move that was opposed by elements in both the left and right wings of his party. These split off to become the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] (led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]]), forming a coalition with the Conservatives before merging with them in 1912. The Liberal Unionist influence dragged the party towards the left; Conservative governments passing a number of progressive reforms at the turn of the 20th century. By the late 19th century, the traditional business supporters of the UK [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] had joined the Conservatives, making them the party of business and commerce.<ref>Feuchtwanger, p. 273</ref>

After a period of Liberal dominance before the [[First World War]], the Conservatives gradually became more influential in government, regaining full control of the cabinet in 1922. In the interwar period conservatism was the major ideology in Britain, as the Liberal Party vied with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] for control of the left. After the [[Second World War]], the first Labour government under [[Clement Attlee]] embarked on a program of nationalisation of industry and social welfare state. The policies were generally accepted by the Conservatives until the 1980s. Many of Labour's programs were reversed in the 1980s by the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]], which was guided by [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economics.

Small conservative political parties (such as the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]]) began to appear, although they have yet to make any significant impact at Westminster (the DUP is currently part of a ruling coalition in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]).

===Germany===
{{expand section|date=October 2012}}
{{Main|Conservatism in Germany}}
Conservative thought developed alongside nationalism in Germany, culminating in Germany's victory over France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the creation of the unified [[German Empire]] in 1871, and the simultaneous rise of [[Otto von Bismarck]] on the European political stage.  Bismarck's "balance of power" model maintained peace in Europe for decades at the end of the 19th century, and his "revolutionary conservatism" led to significant popular reforms in insurance law, labor, and wages.  These and other policies made socialism seem less desirable to the average German family, and propelled Bismarck to high renown during his lifetime. 

With the rise of [[Nazism]] in 1933, agrarian conservatism faded and was supplanted by a more command-based economy and forced social integration.  Though Adolf Hitler succeeded in garnering the support of many German industrialists, prominent traditionalists openly and secretly opposed his policies of euthanasia, genocide, and attacks on organized religion, including [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], [[Henning von Tresckow]], Bishop [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]], and the monarchist [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]].

More recently, the work of conservative [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] leader [[Helmut Kohl]] helped bring about [[German Reunification]], along with the closer integration of Europe in the form of the [[Maastricht Treaty]].  Today, German conservatism is often associated with Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], whose tenure has been marked by attempts to save the common European currency (EURO) from demise.

===United States===
{{expand section|date=June 2013}}
{{main|Conservatism in the United States}}
In the United States, conservatism is rooted in the [[American Revolution]] and its commitment to [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], sovereignty of the people, and the rights and liberties of Englishmen while expelling the king and his supporters. Most European conservative writers do not accept American conservatism as genuine; they consider it to be a variety of liberalism. Modern American liberals in the [[New Deal coalition|New Deal]] do not disagree with that consensus view, but conservatives spend much more emphasis on the Revolutionary origins, with the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] advocates use [[Boston Tea Party|an episode from the 1770s]] for their name and some even dress in costumes from that era at their rallies.

Historian Gregory Schneider identifies several constants in '''American conservatism''': respect for tradition, support of republicanism, "the rule of law and the Christian religion," and a defense of "Western civilization from the challenges of modernist culture and totalitarian governments."<ref name="GregorySchneider">Gregory Schneider, ''The Conservative Century: From Reaction to Revolution '' (Rowman & Littlefield. 2009) p. xii</ref>
[[File:Jmaistre.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Joseph de Maistre]] (1753–1821)]]

===Latin Europe===
Another form of conservatism developed in France in parallel to conservatism in Britain. It was influenced by [[Counter-Enlightenment]] works by men such as [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Louis de Bonald]]. Latin conservatism was less pragmatic and more [[reactionary]] than the conservatism of Burke.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Many Continental or Traditionalist conservatives do not support [[separation of Church and state]], with most supporting state recognition of and cooperation with the [[Catholic Church]], such as had existed in France before the Revolution.

Eventually conservatives added [[patriotism]] and [[nationalism]] to the list of traditional values they support. German conservatives were the first to embrace nationalism, which was previously associated with [[liberalism]] and the Revolution in France.<ref>ams, Ian Political Ideology Today (2nd edition), Manchester University Press, 2002, p. 46</ref>

==Forms of conservatism==
===Liberal conservatism===
{{Main|Liberal conservatism}}
[[Liberal conservatism]] is a variant of conservatism that combines conservative values and policies with classical [[Liberalism|liberal]] stances.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=xGNRRwkZFysC&pg=PA109 Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science]  Ellen Grigsby, Cengage Learning, 2008 ISBN 978-0-495-50112-1, ISBN 978-0-495-50112-1 pp. 108, 109, 112, 347</ref> As these latter two terms have had different meanings over time and across countries, liberal conservatism also has a wide variety of meanings. Historically, the term often referred to the combination of [[Liberal theory of economics|economic liberalism]], which champions [[laissez-faire]] markets, with the classical conservatism concern for established [[tradition]], respect for authority and religious values. It contrasted itself with [[classical liberalism]], which supported [[Individual freedom|freedom for the individual]] in both the economic and social spheres.

Over time, the general conservative ideology in many countries adopted economic liberal arguments, and the term ''liberal conservatism'' was replaced with ''conservatism''. This is also the case in countries where liberal economic ideas have been the tradition, such as the United States, and are thus considered conservative. In other countries where liberal conservative movements have entered the political mainstream, such as [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], the terms ''liberal'' and ''conservative'' may be synonymous. The liberal conservative tradition in the United States combines the economic [[individualism]] of the classical liberals with a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] form of conservatism (which has also become part of the [[American conservatism|American conservative]] tradition, such as in the writings of [[Russell Kirk]]).

A secondary meaning for the term ''liberal conservatism'' that has developed in [[Europe]] is a combination of more modern conservative (less traditionalist) views with those of [[social liberalism]]. This has developed as an opposition to the more [[collectivist]] views of [[socialism]]. Often this involves stressing what are now conservative views of free-market economics and belief in individual responsibility, with social liberal views on defence of [[civil rights]], [[environmentalism]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. This philosophy is that of [[Sweden|Swedish]] Prime Minister [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]]. In continental Europe, this is sometimes also translated into [[English language|English]] as [[social conservatism]].
===Conservative liberalism===
{{Main|Conservative liberalism}}
[[Conservative liberalism]] is a variant of [[liberalism]] that combines liberal values and policies with conservative stances, or, more simply, the right wing of the liberal movement.<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm Ipolitique.fr]</ref><ref>[http://www.parties-and-elections.de/contents.html Parties-and-elections.de]</ref><ref name="Mair">[[Michael Gallagher (academic)|M.

Until the two [[World Wars]], in most European countries the political class was formed by conservative liberals, from [[Germany]] to [[Italy]]. Events after [[World War I]] brought the more radical version of classical liberalism to a more conservative (i.e. more moderate) type of liberalism.<ref>Allen R.T., ''Beyond Liberalism'', p. 13.</ref>

===Libertarian conservatism===
{{Main|Libertarian conservatism}}
[[Libertarian conservatism]] describes certain political ideologies within the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] which combine [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economic issues with aspects of conservatism. Its five main branches are [[Constitutionalism]], [[paleolibertarianism]], [[right-libertarianism|neolibertarianism]], [[American conservatism|small government conservatism]] and [[Christian libertarianism]]. They generally differ from [[paleoconservatives]], in that they are in favor of more [[liberty|personal]] and [[economic freedom]].

[[Agorist]]s such as [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] labeled libertarian conservatism [[right-libertarianism]].<ref name="nlm">{{cite web|title=New Libertarian Manifesto|url=http://agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf}}</ref><ref name="int">{{cite web|title=Interview With Samuel Edward Konkin III|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/software/konkin-interview.html}}</ref>

In contrast to [[paleoconservative]]s, libertarian conservatives support strict [[laissez-faire]] policies such as [[free trade]], opposition to any national bank and opposition to [[regulations|business regulations]]. They are vehemently opposed to [[environmental regulation]]s, [[corporate welfare]], [[subsidies]], and other areas of economic intervention.

===Fiscal conservatism===
{{Main|Fiscal conservatism}}
[[Fiscal conservatism]] is the economic philosophy of prudence in government spending and debt.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B10JkvO82x8C&pg=PA109 |title=Correctional Organization and Management: Public Policy Challenges, Behavior, and Structure |first=Robert M. |last=Freeman |publisher=Elsevier |year=1999 |page=109 |isbn=978-0-7506-9897-9}}</ref> Edmund Burke, in his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', argued that a government does not have the right to run up large debts and then throw the burden on the taxpayer:
<blockquote>
...[I]t is to the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor of the state, that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or implied...[T]he public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large.</blockquote>

===Green conservatism===
{{Main|Green conservatism}}
[[Green conservatism]] is a term used to refer to conservatives who have incorporated [[Green politics|green]] concerns into their [[ideology]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qiSp-MuGjZkC&pg=PA124 |title=Beyond the New Right |first=John |last=Gray |publisher=Routledge |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-415-10706-8 |page=124}}</ref> One of the first uses of the term ''green conservatism'' was by former United States [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]], in a debate on environmental issues with [[John Kerry]].<ref>[http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=20393&c=1&tb=1&pb=1&gd=04232007 We Can Have Green Conservatism – And We Should – HUMAN EVENTS].

===National and traditional conservatism===
{{Main|National conservatism|Traditional conservatism}}
National conservatism is a [[politics|political]] term used primarily in Europe to describe a variant of conservatism which concentrates more on national interests than standard conservatism as well as upholding cultural and ethnic identity,<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary Of Public Administration |last=Mandal |first= V.C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Sarup & Sons |location= |isbn=978-81-7625-784-8 |page=306  |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Hs0xJORVIHwC&pg=PA306&dq=%22National+conservatism%22+-inpublisher:icon&cd=8#v=onepage&q=%22National%20conservatism%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&f=false |accessdate=}}</ref> while not being outspokenly [[nationalism|nationalist]] or supporting a [[far-right politics|far-right]] approach.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} In Europe, national conservatives are usually [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptics]].<ref>http://www.parties-and-elections.de/content.html</ref><ref name="gua">Traynor, Ian, [http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/ian_traynor/2006/04/post_15.html The EU's weary travellers] ''The Guardian'', April 4, 2006</ref>

National conservatism is heavily oriented towards the traditional [[family]] and social stability as well as in favour of limiting [[immigration]]. As such, national conservatives can be distinguished from economic conservatives, for whom [[free market]] economic policies, [[deregulation]] and [[fiscal conservatism]] are the main priorities. Some commentators have identified a growing gap between national and economic conservatism: "most parties of the Right [today] are run by economic conservatives who, in varying degrees, have marginalized social, cultural, and national conservatives."<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n12_v49/ai_19559422 National questions - conservatives fragmenting as liberals unite], National Review, June 30, 1997</ref> National conservatism is also related to [[traditionalist conservatism]].

Traditionalist conservatism is a political philosophy emphasizing the need for the principles of [[natural law]] and transcendent moral order, [[tradition]], [[hierarchy]] and [[organic unity]], [[agrarianism]], [[classicism]] and [[high culture]], and the intersecting spheres of loyalty.<ref>Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, pp. 870–75.</ref>   Some traditionalists have embraced the labels "[[reactionary]]" and "[[counterrevolution]]ary", defying the stigma that has attached to these terms since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].  Having a hierarchical view of society, many traditionalist conservatives, including a few Americans, defend the [[monarchy|monarchical]] political structure as the most natural and beneficial social arrangement.

===Cultural and social conservatism===
{{Main|Cultural conservatism|social conservatism}}
Cultural conservatives support the preservation of the heritage of one nation, or of a shared culture that is not defined by national boundaries.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RbwDNb5jtzUC&printsec=frontcover |title=Cultural Conservatism, Political Liberalism: From Criticism to Cultural Studies |first=James |last=Seaton |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-472-10645-5}}</ref> The shared culture may be as divergent as [[Western culture]] or [[Chinese culture]]. In the United States, the term ''cultural conservative'' may imply a conservative position in the [[culture war]]. Cultural conservatives hold fast to traditional ways of thinking even in the face of monumental change. They believe strongly in traditional values and traditional politics, and often have an urgent sense of nationalism.

Social conservatism is distinct from cultural conservatism, although there are some overlaps. Social conservatives believe that the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing what they consider traditional values or behaviors. A social conservative wants to preserve traditional morality and social mores, often through civil law or regulation. Social change is generally regarded as suspect.

A second meaning of the term ''social conservatism'' developed in the [[Nordic countries]] and [[continental Europe]]. There it refers to [[liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]] supporting modern [[European welfare state]]s.

Social conservatives (in the first meaning of the word) in many countries generally favor the [[pro-life]] position in the [[abortion controversy]] and oppose human [[embryonic stem cell]] research (particularly if publicly funded); oppose both [[eugenics]] and [[human enhancement]] ([[transhumanism]]) while supporting [[bioconservatism]];<ref>[http://www.utne.com/2005-01-01/TheNextDigitalDivide.aspx?page=2 The Next Digital Divide] (utne article)</ref> support a traditional definition of marriage as being one man and one woman; view the [[nuclear family]] model as society's foundational unit; oppose expansion of [[civil marriage]] and [[child adoption]] rights to couples in [[same-sex relationship]]s; promote [[public morality]] and traditional [[family values]]; oppose atheism,<ref>"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots.

===Religious conservatism===

Religious conservatives principally seek to apply the teachings of particular religions to politics, sometimes by merely proclaiming the value of those teachings, at other times by having those teachings influence laws.<ref>Andersen, Margaret L., Taylor, Howard Francis.

===Progressive conservatism===
{{Main|Progressive conservatism}}
Progressive conservatism incorporates [[Progressivism|progressive]] policies alongside conservative policies. It stresses the importance of a [[social safety net]] to deal with [[poverty]], support of limited [[redistribution of wealth]] along with government regulation to regulate markets in the interests of both consumers and producers.<ref name="Patrick Dunleavy 2000. pp. 107–08">Patrick Dunleavy, Paul Joseph Kelly, Michael Moran.

==Historic Conservatism in different countries==
{{Further|Right-wing politics|Political spectrum}}
Conservative political parties vary widely from country to country in the goals they wish to achieve. Both conservative and liberal parties tend to favor private ownership of property, in opposition to communist, socialist and green parties, which favor communal ownership or laws requiring social responsibility on the part of property owners. Where conservatives and liberals differ is primarily on social issues. Conservatives tend to reject behavior that does not conform to some social norm. For many years{{Quantify|date=March 2012}}, conservative parties{{Which|date=March 2012}} fought to stop extension of voting rights to groups such as to non-Christians, non-whites and women. Modern conservative parties often define themselves by their opposition to liberal or labour parties. The United States usage of the term ''conservative'' is unique to that country.<ref>Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. ISBN 978-0-19-878076-2, pp. 31–33</ref>

[[Louis Hartz]] explained the absence of conservatism in Australia or the United States as a result of their settlement as radical or liberal fragments of Great Britain. Although he said English Canada had a negligible conservative influence, subsequent writers claimed that [[United Empire Loyalist|loyalists]] opposed to the American Revolution brought a Tory ideology into Canada.

Conservative elites have long dominated Latin American nations. Mostly this has been achieved through control of and support for civil institutions, the church and the armed forces, rather than through party politics. Typically the church was exempt from taxes and its employees immune from civil prosecution. Where national conservative parties were weak or non-existent, conservatives were more likely to rely on military dictatorship as a preferred form of government. However in some nations where the elites were able to mobilize popular support for conservative parties, longer periods of political stability were achieved. Chile, Colombia and Venezuela are examples of nations that developed strong conservative parties. Argentina, Brazil, El Salvador and Peru are examples of nations where this did not occur.<ref>Middlebrook, Kevin J. ''Conservative parties, the right, and democracy in Latin America''.

The conservative [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] governed the province of Quebec in periods from 1936 to 1960, in a close alliance with English Canadian business elites and the Catholic Church.

===Belgium===
Founded in 1945 as the Christian People's Party, the [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Flemish Christian Democrats]] (CD&V) dominated politics in post-war Belgium. In 1999, the party's support collapsed and it became the country's fifth largest party.<ref>Annesley, Claire. ''A political and economic dictionary of Western Europe''. London: Routledge, 2005. ISBN 978-1-85743-214-5, p. 124</ref>

===Canada===
{{Main|Conservatism in Canada}}
Canada's ''Conservatives'' had their roots in the Loyalists – Tories – who left America after the American Revolution. They developed in the socio-economic and political cleavages that existed during the first three decades of the 19th century, and had the support of the business, professional and established Church (Anglican) elites in Ontario and to a lesser extent in Quebec. Holding a monopoly over administrative and judicial offices, they were called the "[[Family Compact]]" in Ontario and the "[[Chateau Clique]]" in Quebec. [[John A. Macdonald]]'s successful leadership of the movement to confederate the provinces and his subsequent tenure as prime minister for most of the late 19th century rested on his ability to bring together the English-speaking Protestant oligarchy and the [[ultramontane]] Catholic hierarchy of Quebec and to keep them united in a conservative coalition.<ref>Kornberg, Allan and Mishler, William. ''Influence in Parliament, Canada''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1976. p. 38</ref>

The Conservatives combined [[economic liberalism|pro-market liberalism]] and [[Toryism]]. They generally supported an activist government and state intervention in the marketplace, and their policies were marked by ''[[noblesse oblige]]'', a paternalistic responsibility of the elites for the less well-off.<ref>Schultze, Rainer-Olaf; Sturm, Roland and Eberle, Dagmar.

===Colombia===
{{Main|Conservatism in Colombia}}
The [[Colombian Conservative Party]], founded in 1849, traces its origins to opponents of General [[Francisco de Paula Santander]]'s 1833–37 administration. While the term "liberal" had been used to describe all political forces in Colombia, the conservatives began describing themselves as "conservative liberals" and their opponents as "red liberals". From the 1860s until the present, the party has supported strong central government, and supported the Catholic Church, especially its role as protector of the sanctity of the family, and opposed separation of church and state. Its policies include the legal equality of all men, the citizen's right to own property and opposition to dictatorship. It has usually been Colombia's second largest party, with the [[Colombian Liberal Party]] being the largest.<ref>Osterling, p. 180</ref>

===Denmark===
Founded in 1915, the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party of Denmark]]. was the successor of ''Højre'' (literally "[[Right-wing politics|right"]]).  In the 2005 election it won 18 out of 179 seats in the ''Folketing'' and became a junior partner in coalition with the Liberals.<ref>Annesley, Claire. ''A political and economic dictionary of Western Europe''. London: Routledge, 2005. ISBN 978-1-85743-214-5, p. 68</ref> The party is preceded by 11 years by the [[Young Conservatives (Denmark)|Young Conservatives (KU)]], today the youth movement of the party. The Party suffered a major defeat in the parliamentary elections of September 2011 in which the party lost more than half of its seat and also lost governmental power.

===Finland===
The conservative party in Finland is the [[National Coalition Party]] (in Finnish ''Kansallinen Kokoomus'', ''Kok''). The party was founded in 1918 when several monarchist parties united.  Although in the past the party was right-wing, today it is a moderate party.  While the party advocates [[economic liberalism]], it is committed to the [[social market economy]].<ref>Siaroff, Alan.

===France===
Following the Second World War, conservatives in France supported Gaullist groups and have been nationalistic, and emphasized tradition, order, and the regeneration of France. Gaullists held divergent views on social issues. The number of Conservative groups, their lack of stability, and their tendency to be identified with local issues defy simple categorization.  Conservatism has been the major political force in France since the second world war.<ref>Viereck, Peter and Ryn, Claes G. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2005. ISBN 978-0-7658-0576-8 p. 205</ref> Unusually, post-war French conservatism was formed around the personality of a leader, [[Charles de Gaulle]], and did not draw on traditional French conservatism, but on the [[Bonapartism]] tradition.<ref>Ware, Alan.

''The government and politics of France''.  New York: Routledge, 2006. ISBN 978-0-415-35733-3 p. 211</ref>

===Greece===
The main interwar conservative party was called the [[People's Party (Greece)|People's Party]] (PP), which supported constitutional monarchy and opposed the republican Liberal Party. It was able to re-group after the Second World War as part of a ''United Nationalist Front'' which achieved power campaigning on a simple anticommunist, ultranationalist platform. However, the vote received by the PP declined, leading them to create an expanded party, the [[Greek Rally]], under the leadership of the charismatic General [[Alexandros Papagos]]. The conservatives opposed the far right dictatorship of the colonels (1967–1974) and established the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democratic Party]] following the fall of the dictatorship. The new party had four objectives: to confront Turkish expansionism in Cyprus, to reestablish and solidify democratic rule, to give the country a strong government, and to make a powerful moderate party a force in Greek politics.<ref>Penniman, Howard Rae. ''Greece at the polls: the national elections of 1974 and 1977''.  Washington: American Enterprise Institute, 1981. ISBN 978-0-8447-3434-7 pp. 49–59</ref>

The [[Independent Greeks]], a newly formed [[political party]] in [[Greece]] has also supported conservatism, particularly [[National conservatism|national]] and [[Religious conservatism|religious]] conservatism. The Founding Declaration of the Independent Greeks strongly emphasises in the preservation of the Greek state and its [[sovereignty]], the [[Greek people]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].<ref>[http://anexartitoiellines.gr/files/idritiki%20diakirixi.pdf Founding Declaration of Independent Greeks]</ref>

===Iceland===
Founded in 1926 as the Conservative Party, Iceland's [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] adopted its current name in 1929. From the beginning they have been the largest vote-winning party, averaging around 40%. They combine liberalism and conservatism, supporting nationalization and opposed to class conflict. While mostly in opposition during the 1930s, they embraced [[economic liberalism]], but accepted the welfare state after the war and participated in governments supportive of state intervention and protectionism. Unlike other Scandanivian conservative (and liberal) parties, it has always had a large working-class following.<ref>Grofman, Bernard and Lijpart, Arend, editors.

===Luxembourg===
Luxembourg's major conservative party, the [[Christian Social People's Party]] (CSV or PCS) was formed as the Party of the Right in 1914, and adopted its present name in 1945. It was consistently the largest political party in Luxembourg and dominated politics throughout the 20th century.<ref>Urwin, Derek W. ''A Dictionary of European History and Politics, 1945-1995''.

===Norway===
The [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party of Norway]] (Norwegian: Høyre, literally "[[Right-wing politics|right"]]) was formed by the old upper class of state officials and wealthy merchants to fight the populist democracy of the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]], but lost power in 1884 when parliamentarian government was first practised. It formed its first government under parliamentarism in 1889, and continued to alternate in power with the Liberals until the 1930s, when Labour became the dominant political party.  It has elements both of paternalism, stressing the responsibilities of the state and of economic liberalism.  It first returned to power in the 1960s.<ref>[[Knut Heidar|Heidar, Knut]].

The Swiss People's Party (SVP or UDC) was formed from the 1971 merger of the Party of Farmers, Traders, and Citizens, formed in 1917 and the smaller Swiss Democratic Party, formed in 1942.  The SVP emphasized agricultural policy, and was strong among farmers in German-speaking Protestant areas. As Switzerland considered closer relations with the European Union in the 1990s, the SVP adopted a more militant protectionist and isolationist stance. This stance has allowed it to expand into German-speaking Catholic mountainous areas.<ref>Siaroff, Alan ''Comparative European Party Systems''. New York: Garland, 2000.

{{Main|Conservatism in the United Kingdom}}
Conservatism in the [[United Kingdom]] is related to its counterparts in other Western nations, but has a distinct tradition. [[Edmund Burke]] is often considered the ''father of conservatism'' in the English-speaking world. Burke was a [[British Whig Party|Whig]], while the term ''[[Tory]]'' is given to the later Conservative Party. One [[Australia]]n scholar argues, "For Edmund Burke and Australians of a like mind, the essence of conservatism lies not in a body of theory, but in the disposition to maintain those institutions seen as central to the beliefs and practices of society."<ref name="gw">Worthington, Glen, [http://web.archive.org/web/20060913184447/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rn/2001-02/02RN29.htm Conservatism in Australian National Politics], Parliament of Australia Parliamentary Library, 19 February 2002</ref>

[[File:Thatcher - Reagan c872-9.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1981]]
The old established form of English and, after the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]], British conservatism, was the Tory Party. It reflected the attitudes of a rural land owning class, and championed the institutions of the monarchy, the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]], the family, and property as the best defence of the social order. In the early stages of the [[industrial revolution]], it seemed to be totally opposed to a process that seemed to undermine some of these bulwarks. The new industrial elite were seen by many as enemies to the social order. [[Robert Peel]] was able to reconcile the new industrial class to the Tory landed class by persuading the latter to accept the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846. He created a new political group that sought to preserve the old status quo while accepting the basics of [[laissez-faire]] and [[free trade]]. The new coalition of traditional landowners and sympathetic industrialists constituted the new Conservative Party.

[[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]] gave the new party a political ideology. As a young man, he was influenced by the [[romantic movement]] and [[medievalism]], and developed a devastating critique of industrialism. In his novels, he outlined an England divided into two nations, each living in perfect ignorance of each other. He foresaw, like [[Karl Marx]], the phenomenon of an alienated industrial proletariat. His solution involved a return to an idealised view of a corporate or organic society, in which everyone had duties and responsibilities towards other people or groups. This "one nation" conservatism is still a significant tradition in British politics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} It has animated a great deal of social reform undertaken by successive Conservative governments.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Although nominally a Conservative, Disraeli was sympathetic to some of the demands of the [[Chartists]] and argued for an alliance between the landed aristocracy and the working class against the increasing power of the middle class, helping to found the [[Young England]] group in 1842 to promote the view that the rich should use their power to protect the poor from exploitation by the middle class.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The conversion of the Conservative Party into a modern mass organisation was accelerated by the concept of [[Tory Democracy]] attributed to [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], father of Britain's wartime Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[File:CMEC 1 009.jpg|thumb|[[David Cameron]] is the current [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and leader of the Conservative Party.]]
A Liberal-Conservative coalition during [[World War I]], coupled with the ascent of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], hastened the collapse of the Liberals in the 1920s. After [[World War II]], the Conservative Party made concessions to the socialist policies of the Left. This compromise was a pragmatic measure to regain power, but also the result of the early successes of [[central planning]] and state ownership forming a cross-party consensus. This was known as [[Butskellism]], after the almost identical [[Keynesian]] policies of [[Rab Butler]] on behalf of the Conservatives, and [[Hugh Gaitskell]] for Labour.

However, in the 1980s, under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]], and the influence of [[Keith Joseph]], there was a dramatic shift in the ideological direction of British conservatism, with a movement towards [[free-market]] economic policies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} As one commentator explains, "The [[privatization]] of state owned industries, unthinkable before, became commonplace [during Thatcher's government] and has now been imitated all over the world."<ref name="mt">Davies, Stephen, [http://www.ashbrook.org/publicat/onprin/v1n2/davies.html Margaret Thatcher and the Rebirth of Conservatism], Ashbrook Center for Public Affairs, July 1993</ref> Some commentators have questioned whether [[Thatcherism]] was consistent with the traditional concept of conservatism in the [[United Kingdom]], and saw her views as more consistent with radical [[classical liberalism]]. Thatcher was described as "a radical in a conservative party",<ref name="mt"/> and her ideology has been seen as confronting "established institutions" and the "accepted beliefs of the elite",<ref name="mt"/> both concepts incompatible with the traditional conception of conservatism as signifying support for the established order and existing social convention.

==Modern Conservatism in different countries==
While conservatism has been seen as an appeal to traditional, hierarchical society, some writers, such as [[Samuel P. Huntington]], see it as situational.  Under this definition, conservatives are seen as defending the established institutions of their time.<ref>Winthrop and Lovell, pp. 163–66</ref>

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
Founded 1990 as [[Party of Democratic Action]]. It's one of the first Conservative parties in Bosnia after Yugoslavia collapse. It is also known as [[Bosniak]] Conservative Party. There is also Croatian Democratic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HDZBIH) which is considered Croatian Conservative Party and Serbian Democratic Party as Serbian Conservative Party. Conservativism is very popular in Bosnia.

===South Korea===

{{Main|Conservatism in South Korea}}
South Korea's major conservative party, the [[Saenuri Party]] or [[새누리당]], changed its form throughout its history.  First it was the Democratic-Republican Party(1963~1980); its head was [[Park Chung-hee]] who seized power in a 1961 military coup d'état and ruled as an unelected military strongman until his formal election as president in 1963.  He was president for 16 years, until his assassination on October 26, 1979. The [[Democratic Justice Party]] inherited the same ideology as the Democrati-Republican Party.  Its head, [[Chun Doo-hwan]], also gained power through a coup.  His followers called themselves the Hanahoe. The Democratic Justice Party changed its form and acted to suppress the opposition party and to follow the people's demand for direct elections.  The party's [[Roh Tae-woo]] became the first president who was elected through direct election.  The next form of the major conservative party was the Democratic-Liberal Party. Again, through election, its second leader, [[Kim Young-sam]], became the fourteenth president of Korea. When the conservative party was beaten by the opposition party in the general election, it changed its form again to follow the party members' demand for reforms. It became the New Korean Party. It changed again one year later since the President Kim Young-sam was blamed by the citizen for the IMF. It changed its name to Hannara-dang (1998~2011). In the election of 1997, the Hannara-dang became the opposition party for the first time. In the 2002 election the party lost again. The present form, the Saenuri Party was created in 2011. They changed their name because President [[Lee Myung-bak]] was accused of conspiracy in, for example, the Four Rivers Project, and of both family and personal corruption.

The meaning of "conservatism" in America has little in common with the way the word is used elsewhere. As Ribuffo (2011) notes, "what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism."<ref>Leo P. Ribuffo, "20 Suggestions for Studying the Right now that Studying the Right is Trendy," ''Historically Speaking'' Jan 2011 v.12#1 pp. 2–6, quote on p. 6</ref> Since the 1950s conservatism in the United States has been chiefly associated with the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].  However, during the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] many [[Southern Democrats]] were conservatives, and they played a key role in the [[Conservative Coalition]] that controlled Congress from 1937 to 1963.<ref>Kari Frederickson, ''The Dixicrat Revolt and the End of the Solid South, 1932–1968'', p. 12, "...conservative southern Democrats viewed warily the potential of New Deal programs to threaten the region's economic dependence on cheap labor while stirring the democratic ambitions of the disfranchised and undermining white supremacy.", The University of North Carolina Press, 2000, ISBN 978-0-8078-4910-1</ref>

Major movements within American conservatism include support for tradition, law-and-order, Christianity, anti-communism, and a defense of "Western civilization from the challenges of modernist culture and totalitarian governments."<ref name="GregorySchneider" /> Economic conservatives and libertarians favor [[small government]], low taxes, limited regulation, and free enterprise. Some social conservatives see traditional social values threatened by secularism, so they support [[school prayer]] and [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|oppose abortion]] and [[Opponents of same-sex marriage in the United States|homosexuality]].<ref name=Social>{{cite book|title=Texas Politics: Governing the Lone Star State|url=http://books.google.com/?id=fQFZCrbc9mIC&pg=PA87&dq=social+conservatism+abortion+marriage#v=onepage&q=social%20conservatism%20abortion%20marriage&f=false|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|accessdate=19 January 2012|author=Cal Jillson|date=22 February 2011|quote=Social conservatives focus on moral or values issues, such as abortion, marriage, school prayer, and judicial appointments.|isbn=9780203829417}}</ref> [[Neoconservatives]] want to expand American ideals throughout the world and show a strong support for Israel.<ref>Bruce Frohnen, ed.

The conservative movement of the 1950s attempted to bring together these divergent strands, stressing the need for unity to prevent the spread of "Godless Communism", which Reagan later labeled an "[[evil empire]]".<ref>Paul Edward Gottfried, ''Conservatism in America: Making Sense of the American Right'', p. 9, "Postwar conservatives set about creating their own synthesis of free-market capitalism, Christian morality, and the global struggle against Communism." (2009); Gottfried, ''Theologies and moral concern'' (1995) p. 12</ref> During the Reagan administration, conservatives also supported the so-called "[[Reagan Doctrine]]" under which the U.S., as part of a Cold War strategy, provided military and other support to guerrilla insurgencies that were fighting governments aligned with the Soviet Union.

Other modern conservative beliefs include [[world government|opposition to a world government]] and skepticism about the importance or validity of various environmental issues.<ref>Peter J. Jacques; Riley E. Dunlap; Mark Freeman, ''The organisation of denial: Conservative think tanks and environmental scepticism'', Environmental Politics. v12 m3 (2008), pp. 349–85</ref>

Most recently, the [[Tea Party movement]], founded in 2009, has proven a large outlet for populist American conservative ideas.  Their stated goals include rigorous adherence to the U.S. Constitution, lower taxes, and opposition to a growing role for the federal government in health care.  Electorally, it was considered a key force in Republicans reclaiming control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010.<ref>Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson, ''The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism'' (2012) pp. 45–82</ref><ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-12030-503544.html "Katie Couric interviews Tea Party Leaders", CBS News, January 25, 2010.]</ref>

{{see also|Biology and political orientation}}

Following the Second World War, psychologists conducted research into the different motives and tendencies that account for ideological differences between left and right. The early studies focused on conservatives, beginning with [[Theodor W. Adorno]]'s ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950). This book has been heavily criticized on theoretical and methodological grounds, but some of its findings have been confirmed by further empirical research.<ref name="Jost, J.J 2003">Jost, J.J, Glaser, J., Kruglanski, A.A., & Sulloway, F.J. (2003). Political conservatism as motivated social cognition. ''Psychological Bulletin, 129''(3), 339–75.</ref>

In 1973, British psychologist [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]] published an influential book providing evidence that a general factor underlying conservative beliefs is "fear of uncertainty".<ref>Wilson, G.D. (Ed.)(1973) The Psychology of Conservatism, London: Academic Press.</ref> A meta-analysis of research literature by Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, and Sulloway in 2003 found that many factors, such as [[Ambiguity tolerance|intolerance of ambiguity]] and need for [[Cognitive closure (psychology)|cognitive closure]], contribute to the degree of one's political conservatism.<ref name="Jost, J.J 2003"/> A study by Kathleen Maclay stated these traits "might be associated with such generally valued characteristics as personal commitment and unwavering loyalty." The research also suggested that while most people are resistant to change, liberals are more tolerant of it.<ref>[http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/07/22_politics.shtml Berkeley.edu]</ref>

According to psychologist [[Bob Altemeyer]], individuals who are politically conservative tend to rank high in [[Right-wing Authoritarianism|Right-Wing Authoritarianism]] on his RWA scale.<ref>Altemeyer, B. (1981). Right-wing authoritarianism. Winnipeg, Canada: University of Manitoba Press.</ref> This finding was echoed by [[Theodor Adorno]]. A study done on Israeli and Palestinian students in Israel found that RWA scores of right-wing party supporters were significantly higher than those of left-wing party supporters.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Rubinstein | first1=G. | doi=10.1177/0022022196272005 | title=Two Peoples in One Land: A Validation Study of Altemeyer's Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale in the Palestinian and Jewish Societies in Israel | journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | year=1996 | volume=27  |pages=216–30 | issue=2}}</ref> However, a 2005 study by H. Michael Crowson and colleagues suggested a moderate gap between RWA and other conservative positions. "The results indicated that conservatism is not synonymous with RWA."<ref>Crowson, H. Michael, Stephen J. Thoma, and Nita Hestevold. "Is political conservatism synonymous with authoritarianism?." The Journal of Social Psychology 145.5 (Oct 2005): 571(22). Expanded Academic ASAP. Gale. Remote Access. 20 May 2009 [http://find.galegroup.com/itx/start.do?prodId=EAIM Galegroup.com]</ref>

Psychologist Felicia Pratto and her colleagues have found evidence to support the idea that a high [[Social Dominance Orientation]] (SDO) is strongly correlated with conservative political views, and opposition to social engineering to promote equality, though Pratto's findings have been highly controversial.<ref name="pratto">{{cite journal |last1=Pratto |first1=Felicia |last2=Sidanius |first2=Jim |last3=Stallworth |first3=Lisa M. |last4=Malle |first4=Bertram F. |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.741 |title=Social dominance orientation: A personality variable predicting social and political attitudes |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=1994 |volume=67 |pages= 741–63 |issue=4 }}</ref> Pratto and her colleagues found that high SDO scores were highly correlated with measures of [[prejudice]]. They were refuted in this claim by [[David J. Schneider]], who wrote that "correlations between prejudice and political conservative are reduced virtually to zero when controls for SDO are instituted".<ref>The psychology of stereotyping, David J. Schneider,  Guilford Press, 2005 ISBN 978-1-59385-193-4, ISBN 978-1-59385-193-4. p. 275</ref> [[Kenneth Minogue]] criticized Pratto's work, saying "It is characteristic of the conservative temperament to value established identities, to praise habit and to respect prejudice, not because it is irrational, but because such things anchor the darting impulses of human beings in solidities of custom which we do not often begin to value until we are already losing them. Radicalism often generates youth movements, while conservatism is a condition found among the mature, who have discovered what it is in life they most value."<ref>The Social science encyclopedia, Jessica Kuper, Taylor & Francis, 1985 ISBN 978-0-7102-0008-2, ISBN 978-0-7102-0008-2. pp. 155–56</ref>

A 1996 study on the relationship between racism and conservatism found that the correlation was stronger among more educated individuals, though specifically anti-Black racism did not increase. They also found that the correlation between racism and conservatism could be entirely accounted for by their mutual relationship with social dominance orientation. The authors concluded that opposition to affirmative action, especially among more highly educated conservatives, was better explained by social dominance orientation than by principled conservatism.<ref name="sidanius96">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.476 |last1=Sidanius |first1= J |last2=Pratto |first2= F |last3=Bobo |first3= L |year=1996 |title=Racism, conservatism, affirmative action, and intellectual sophistication: A matter of principled conservatism or group dominance? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 70 |issue=3 |pages= 476–90 |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/bobo/pdf%20documents/Racism.pdf |format=PDF }}</ref>

A 2008 research report found that conservatives are happier than liberals, and that as income inequality increases, this difference in relative happiness increases, because conservatives (more than liberals) possess an ideological buffer against the negative hedonic effects of economic inequality.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02124.x|noedit}}</ref>
