{{Politics of Antigua and Barbuda}}
The '''politics of Antigua and Barbuda''' takes place in a framework of a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[monarchy]], wherein the [[Monarchy in Antigua and Barbuda|Sovereign of Antigua and Barbuda]] is the [[head of state]], appointing a [[List of Governors-General of Antigua and Barbuda|Governor-General]] to act as [[Viceroy|vice-regal]] representative in the nation. A [[List of Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda|Prime Minister]] is appointed by the Governor-General as the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]; the Prime Minister advises the Governor-General on the appointment of a Council of Ministers. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the two chambers of the [[Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda|Parliament]]. The [[bicameral]] Parliament consists of the Senate (seventeen-member body appointed by the Governor General) and the House of Representatives (seventeen seats; members are elected by proportional representation to serve five-year terms).

Antigua and Barbuda has a long history of free elections, three of which have resulted in peaceful changes of government. Since the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 1951|1951 general election]], the party system has been dominated by the personalist [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP), dominated by the Bird family, particularly Prime Ministers [[Vere Bird|Vere]] and [[Lester Bird]]. The opposition claimed to be disadvantaged by the ALP's longstanding monopoly on patronage and its control of the media, especially in the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 1999|1999 general election]]. The [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 2009|most recent elections]] to the House of Representatives were held on 12 March 2009. The [[United Progressive Party (Antigua and Barbuda)|United Progressive Party]] government was re-elected with nine seats and supported by the sole member from Barbuda, affiliated to the [[Barbuda People's Movement]]. The Antigua Labour Party has seven seats in the House of Representatives.

Constitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association. Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the eastern Caribbean court system. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Jurisprudence is based on English [[common law]].
