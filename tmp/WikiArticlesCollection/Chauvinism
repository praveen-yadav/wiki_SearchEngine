'''Chauvinism''', in its original meaning, is an exaggerated, [[patriotism]] and a belligerent belief in national superiority and glory.<ref name=oed>[[Oxford English Dictionary]]</ref> Its [[eponym]] is a French soldier [[Nicolas Chauvin]], who was badly wounded in the [[Napoleonic wars]]. He received a pension for his injuries but it was not enough to live on. After Napoleon abdicated, Chauvin was a fanatical Bonapartist despite the unpopularity of this view in Bourbon Restoration France. His single-minded blind devotion to his cause, despite neglect by his faction and harassment by its enemies, started the use of the term.

By extension, it has come to include an extreme and unreasoning [[Partisan (political)|partisanship]] on behalf of any group to which one belongs, especially when the partisanship includes malice and hatred towards rival groups. [[Jingoism]] is the British parallel form of this French word, but its meaning has not expanded beyond nationalism in the same way that the word ''chauvinism'' has.<ref name=oed/>

A contemporary use of the term in English is in the phrase ''[[male chauvinism]].''<ref>{{cite book |title=The Columbia Guide to Standard American English |url=http://www.bartleby.com/68/24/1224.html |accessdate=4 December 2008 |quote=''Chauvinism'' is "fanatical, boastful, unreasoning patriotism" and by extension "prejudiced belief or unreasoning pride in any group to which you belong." Lately, though, the compounds ''male chauvinism'' and ''male chauvinist'' have gained so much popularity that some users may no longer recall the patriotic and other more generalized meanings of the words.}}</ref>

In "Imperialism, Nationalism, Chauvinism", in ''The Review of Politics'' '''7'''.4, (October 1945), p.&nbsp;457, [[Hannah Arendt]], the political theorist, describes the concept:

{{quote|Chauvinism is an almost natural product of the national concept in so far as it springs directly from the old idea of the "national mission." ... [A] nation's mission might be interpreted precisely as bringing its light to other, less fortunate peoples that, for whatever reason, have miraculously been left by history without a national mission. As long as this concept did not develop into the ideology of chauvinism and remained in the rather vague realm of national or even nationalistic pride, it frequently resulted in a high sense of responsibility for the welfare of backward people.}}
Technical Chauvinism has been used for those examples where inventors of a particular nationality have been idolised, one case being that of the [[Propeller (marine)|ship's propeller]]. It had no sole inventor, but claims have been made for the Swede John Ericsson and the Czech Josef Ressel. The latter even has a national monument to him.

==Male chauvinism==
{{see also|androcentrism|machismo|patriarchy|masculism|feminism}}

''Male chauvinism'' is the belief that [[men]] are superior to [[women]].  This is closely associated with [[sexism]] and [[misogyny]], and other forms of believing that women are inferior to men, especially [[intellect]]ually. 

Author [[Michael Korda]] has defined male chauvinism as a "blind allegiance and simple minded devotion to one's maleness that is mixed with open or disguised belligerence toward women. It is also usually associated with an unconscious ritual to ward off anxiety engendered by these same women." <ref name="Korda, Michael 1973">Korda, Michael. Male Chauvinism! How It Works. New York: Random House, 1973. Print.</ref>

Male chauvinism was apparent long before the [[feminist movement]], and studies indicate that it has existed as long as [[racism]] and [[religious persecution]].<ref>Turkel, Ann Ruth. Reflections on the Development of Male Chauvinism. ''American Journal of Psychoanalysis'', 52.3 (1992): 263. Web. 31 Jan 2012.</ref><ref name="Lloyd, Cynthia B. 1975">Lloyd, Cynthia B., ed. Sex, Discrimination, and the Division of Labor. New York: Columbia University Press, 1975. Print.</ref> The first documented use of the phrase ''male chauvinism'' is in the 1935 [[Clifford Odets]] play ''[[Till the Day I Die]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mansbridge|first=Jane|coauthors=Katherine Flaster|title=Male Chauvinist, Feminist, Sexist, and Sexual Harassment: Different Trajectories in Feminist Linguistic Innovation|journal=American Speech|year=2005|volume=80|issue=3|page=261|publisher=Harvard University}}</ref>

===Male chauvinism in the workplace===
The balance of the [[workforce]] changed during [[World War II]] through the dramatic rise of women’s participation as men left their positions to enlist in the military and fight in the war. After the war ended and men returned home to find jobs in the workplace, male chauvinism was on the rise. Previously, men had been the main source of labour, and they expected to come back to their previous employment, but women had stepped into many of their positions to fill the void.<ref name="Lloyd, Cynthia B. 1975"/>

As they integrated back into the workforce, men returned to predominantly holding positions of power, and women worked as their secretaries, usually typing dictations and answering telephone calls. This division of labor was understood and expected, and women typically felt unable to challenge their position or male superiors.<ref name="Korda, Michael 1973"/><ref name="Lloyd, Cynthia B. 1975"/> 
There is less chauvinism seen in the general modern workplace, though it is still found in more personal relationships within businesses.

===Male chauvinism in the home===
Michael Korda, author of ''Male Chauvinism! How It Works'', compared chauvinistic husbands to the hedgehog from a well-known Russian fable, [[The Hedgehog and the Fox]]; they have one way of thinking, and it is so engrianed that they cannot change it. Chauvinistic men see marriage as a particular type of relationship, with defined responsibilities for each spouse. These expectations often match culturally endorsed [[Gender Roles]] with women expected stay home to cook, clean, and raise children, and men to work outside of the home, and are permitted to have whatever job they choose.

===Religio-cultural and geographic spread===
Male chauvinism is seen in different cultures. It is a classical concept of the [[Judaism|Jewish religious tradition]], and the [[Christian faith]] has long been criticized for the [[Biblical patriarchy|general superiority complex of males]]. Although [[Hindu]] religion and Indian cultural practice does not strictly dictate the status of women, many conservative leaders and [[gurus]] continue to hold and espouse deeply misogynistic views publicly,<ref>{{cite web|last=Daniel |first=Frank Jack |first2=Satarupa |last2=Bhattacharjya |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/01/09/india-delhi-gang-rape-asaram-bapu-views-idINDEE90809L20130109 |title=Asaram Bapu's view on Delhi rape raises anger, but shared by many |publisher=Reuters |date=9 January 2013 |accessdate=2013-02-20}}</ref> leading to clashes with more liberal Indians, both verbal<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-08/india/36216040_1_asaram-bapu-victims-of-sexual-assault-rapists |title=Activists slam Asaram Bapu for his comments on Delhi gang-rape incident |publisher=Times Of India |date=8 January 2013 |accessdate=2013-02-20}}</ref> and otherwise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/postdelhi-gangrape-comments-asaram-bapus-camp-vandalised-visit-to-kumbh-mela-opposed/1057538 |title=Post-Delhi gangrape comments, Asaram Bapu's camp vandalised, visit to Kumbh Mela opposed |publisher=Indian Express |date=10 January 2013 |accessdate=2013-02-20}}</ref>

===Role of women in perpetuating male chauvinism===
Some women are comfortable with being subjugated and/or relieved from positions of responsibility by men, and do not feel comfortable when they or other women are in power or authority.<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein |first=Angela |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-507148/Im-FEMALE-male-chauvinist--proud-it.html |title=I'm a FEMALE male chauvinist - and proud of it |publisher=Mail Online |date=10 January 2008 |accessdate=2013-02-20}}</ref> Such attitudes may be passed on to children, including female children, and lead to self-perpetuation. In some cases, this results from centuries of historical or religious conditioning into the subservient role.<ref>{{cite web|author=Reifenberg, Anne |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-05-20/news/9305210334_1_muslim-women-sharif-umm |title=To Muslim Women, Male Dominance Holy |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=May 20, 1993 |accessdate=2013-02-20}}</ref>

===Causes of male chauvinism===
[[Ann Turkel]] believes that chauvinistic attitudes of men stem from the early mother-child relationship, and that the concept of breast envy in men is crucial to understanding the connection between envy and devaluation, and thus the root of chauvinistic attitudes in men.  Devaluation is a defense mechanism for envy.<ref name="Lloyd, Cynthia B. 1975"/>

Chauvinism is also seen as an influential factor in some psychological personality tests, such as the [[Thematic Apperception Test|TAT]]. Through cross-examinations, the TAT exhibits a tendency toward chauvinistic stimuli for its questions and has the “potential for unfavorable clinical evaluation” for women.<ref>Potkay, Charles R., Matthew R. Merrens. Sources of Male Chauvinism in the TAT. Journal of Personality Assessment, 39.5 (1975): 471-479. Web. 31 Jan 2012.</ref>

An often cited study done in 1976 by Sherwyn Woods, Some Dynamics of Male Chauvinism, attempts to find the underlying causes of "male chauvinism."

:Male chauvinism was studied in the [[psychoanalytic]] therapy of 11 men. It refers to the maintenance of fixed beliefs and attitudes of male superiority, associated with overt or covert depreciation of women. Challenging chauvinist attitudes often results in anxiety or other symptoms. It is frequently not investigated in psychotherapy because it is ego-syntonic, parallels cultural attitudes, and because therapists often share similar bias or neurotic conflict. Male chauvinism was found to represent an attempt to ward off anxiety and shame arising from one or more of four prime sources: unresolved infantile strivings and regressive wishes, hostile envy of women, [[oedipal]] anxiety, and power and dependency conflicts related to masculine [[self-esteem]]. [[Mother]]s were more important than fathers in the development of male chauvinism, and resolution was sometimes associated with [[decompensation#Psychology|decompensation]] in wives.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Woods|first=Sherwyn M.|title=Some Dynamics of Male Chauvinism|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|date=January 1976|volume=33|issue=1|pages=63|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1976.01770010037007 |url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/1/63}}</ref>

==Female chauvinism==
''Female chauvinism'' is the symmetrical attitude that [[women]] are superior to [[men]]. The term ''female chauvinism'' has been adopted by critics of some types or aspects of [[feminism]]; second-wave feminist [[Betty Friedan]] is a notable example.<ref>"If I were a man, I would strenuously object to the assumption that women have any moral or spiritual superiority as a class. This is [...] female chauvinism." Friedan, Betty. 1998. ''It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women's Movement''. Harvard University Press</ref> [[Ariel Levy]] used the term in similar, but opposite sense in her book, ''[[Female Chauvinist Pigs]],'' in which she argues that many young women in the United States and beyond are replicating male chauvinism and older [[Misogyny|misogynist]] [[stereotype]]s.<ref>''Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture'', [[Ariel Levy]], 2006, ISBN 0-7432-8428-3</ref>
