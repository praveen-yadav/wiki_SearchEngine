'''Dice''' ([[Singular number|singular]] '''die''' or '''dice''';<ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/dice Definition of dice in English], Oxford Dictionaries</ref> from [[French language|French]] ''dé''; from [[Latin]] ''datum'' "something which is given or played")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/die_2?view=uk |title=die |publisher=AskOxford |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref> are small throwable objects with multiple resting positions, used for generating [[Statistical randomness|random numbers]]. Dice are suitable as [[gambling]] devices for games like [[craps]], and are also used in non-gambling [[tabletop game]]s.

A traditional die is a rounded [[cube (geometry)|cube]], with each of its six faces showing a different number of dots ([[pip (counting)|pips]]) from 1 to 6. When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing on its upper surface a random [[integer]] from one to six, each value being equally likely. A variety of similar devices are also described as dice; such specialized dice may have polyhedral or irregular shapes and may have faces marked with symbols instead of numbers. They may be used to produce results other than one through six. Loaded and crooked dice are designed to favor some results over others for purposes of [[cheating]] or amusement.

==History==
[[Image:Die bone.jpg|thumb|left|Bone die found at Cantonment Clinch (1823–1834), an American fort used in the [[American Civil War]] by both [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] and [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces at separate times]]
[[Image:historical dice.jpg|thumb|upright|A collection of historical dice from various regions of [[Asia]]]]
Dice have been used since before recorded history, and it is uncertain where they originated. The oldest known dice were excavated as part of a 5000-year-old [[backgammon]] set at the [[Burnt City]], an archeological site in south-eastern [[Iran]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=5668&sectionid=351020108 |title=presstv.ir |publisher=presstv.ir |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref> Other excavations from ancient tombs in the [[Indus Valley civilization]] indicate a [[South Asia]]n origin.<ref>Possehl, Gregory. "Meluhha". In: J. Reade (ed.) ''The Indian Ocean in Antiquity''. London: Kegan Paul Intl. 1996a, 133–208</ref> Dicing is mentioned as an [[History of India|Indian]] game in the ''[[Rigveda]]'', ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' and [[Buddha games list]].<ref>2.3, 4.38, 6.118, 7.52, 7.109</ref> It also plays a critical role in the great [[Hindu]] epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', where [[Yudhisthira]] plays a game of dice against the [[Kauravas]] for the northern kingdom of [[Hastinapura]], which becomes the trigger for a  war.{{fact|date=September 2013}} There are several [[Bible|biblical]] references to "casting lots", as in [[Psalms|Psalm]] 22, indicating that dicing (or a related activity) was commonplace when the psalm was composed. [[Knucklebones]] was a [[game of skill|skill game]] played by women and children; a derivative form had the four sides of the bone receive different values and count as modern dice.{{fact|date=September 2013}} Gambling with two or three dice was a very popular form of amusement in [[Greece]], especially with the upper classes, and a frequent accompaniment to [[symposium|symposia]].{{fact|date=September 2013}}

[[Image:Knuck dice Steatite 37x27x21 mm.JPG|thumb|left|[[Knucklebones]] die, made of [[steatite]]]]
Dice were originally made from the [[talus bone|talus]] of hoofed animals, colloquially known as "knucklebones". These are approximately [[tetrahedral]], leading to the nickname "bones" for dice. Modern [[Mongolia]]ns still use such bones as [[shagai]] for games and [[fortunetelling]].{{fact|date=September 2013}} Besides bone, materials like [[ivory]], wood and [[plastic]]s like [[cellulose acetate]] have been used. Dice are hard to distinguish from knucklebones in literature because ancient writers confused the two, but both were used in prehistoric times.{{fact|date=September 2013}}

The [[Culture of Ancient Rome|Romans]] were passionate gamblers, especially at the peak of the [[Roman Empire]], and dicing was common though forbidden except during the [[Saturnalia]]. [[Horace]] derided youths who wasted time on dicing instead of [[horse]]-chasing. Throwing dice for money was the cause of many special laws in Rome, one of which stated that no [[lawsuit]] could be filed by a person who allowed gambling in his house, even if he had been cheated or assaulted.{{fact|date=September 2013}} Professional gamblers were common, and some of their loaded dice are preserved in [[museum]]s. The public houses were the resorts of gamblers, and depictions of quarreling dicers can be seen on [[fresco]]s.{{fact|date=September 2013}} Twenty-sided dice date back to the 2nd century AD <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/Lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4205385 |title=christies.com |publisher=christies.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref> and late BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections?what=Dice |title=metmuseum.org (Dice) |publisher=metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref>

[[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] stated that the [[Germanic tribes|Germans]] were passionately fond of dicing,{{dubious|date=September 2013}} so much that they would stake their personal liberty when bankrupt.{{fact|date=September 2013}} During the Middle Ages, dicing became a favorite pastime of [[knight]]s, who formed dicing schools and guilds.{{fact|date=September 2013}} After the downfall of [[feudalism]], the [[landsknecht]]s established a reputation as the most notorious dicing gamblers of their time. In France, dice were used by both knights and ladies, despite repeated legislation against gambling with dice, including interdictions on the part of [[Louis IX of France|St. Louis]] in 1254 and 1256. The markings on [[Chinese dominoes]] evolved from the markings on dice.{{fact|date=September 2013}}

==Usage==
Dice are thrown onto a flat surface either from the hand or from a container designed for this (such as a dice cup). The face of the die that is uppermost when it comes to rest provides the value of the throw. One typical [[dice games|dice game]] today is [[craps]], where two dice are thrown at a time and wagers are made on the total value of the two dice. Dice are frequently used to randomize moves in [[board game]]s, usually by deciding the distance through which a piece will move along the board; examples of this are backgammon and ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]''.

The result of a die roll is determined by the way it is thrown, according to the laws of [[classical mechanics]].{{cn|date=October 2013}} A die roll is made random by uncertainty in minor factors such as tiny movements in the thrower's hand; They are thus a crude form of [[hardware random number generator]]. Perhaps to militate against concerns that the pips on the faces of certain styles of dice cause a small bias,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} casinos use precision dice with flush markings.

==Construction==
[[Image:dice01.jpg|frame|right|Western, Asian and [[casino]] dice]]
[[File:Chiralität von Würfeln V.2.svg|thumb|300px|[[Chirality]] of dice. Faces may be placed [[clockwise and counterclockwise|counterclockwise (top) ''or'' clockwise]]. ]]
===Arrangement===
Common dice are small [[cube (geometry)|cubes]] most commonly 1.6&nbsp;cm across,{{fact|date=September 2013}} whose faces are numbered from one to six, usually by patterns of round dots called pips. (While the use of [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]] is occasionally seen, such as in the game ''[[Trouble (board game)|Pop-O-Matic Trouble]]'', such dice are uncommon.) Opposite sides of a die traditionally add up to seven, implying that the 1, 2 and 3 faces share a vertex;<ref>Cf. [http://www.archive.org/details/greekanthology05newyuoft ''Greek Anthology''] Book 14, §8: "The Opposite Pairs of Numbers on a Die. The numbers on a die run so: six one, five two, three four."</ref> these faces may be placed [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise or counterclockwise]] about this vertex. If the 1, 2 and 3 faces run counterclockwise, the die is called "right-handed", and if those faces run clockwise, the die is called "left-handed". Western dice are normally right-handed, and Chinese dice are normally left-handed.<ref name=diceplay>[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/dice-play/DiceStandard.htm Standard Dice] from dice-play {{dead|date=September 2013}}</ref>

[[Image:Die Faces.svg|left|thumb|Typical facets of an Asian-style (top) and a Western-style die (bottom). The pips on the Asian-style facets are arranged more compactly than the Western-style facets.]]
The pips on dice are arranged in specific patterns as shown. Asian style dice bear similar patterns to Western ones, but the pips are closer to the centre of the face; in addition, the pips are differently sized on Asian style dice, and the pips are coloured red on the 1 and 4 sides. One possible explanation is that red fours are of Indian origin.<ref name=diceplay/><ref>[http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Culin/Dice1893/dice.html Chinese Dice] from the Elliott Avedon Museum & Archive of Games</ref> In some older sets, the "one" pip is a colorless depression.

===Manufacturing===
Non-precision dice are manufactured via the plastic [[injection molding]] process. The pips or numbers on the dice are a part of the mold. The coloring for numbering is achieved by submerging the dice entirely in paint, which is allowed to dry, and then polished via a [[tumble finishing]] process similar to rock polishing. The abrasive agent scrapes off all of the paint except for the indents of the numbering. A finer abrasive is then used to polish the die. This process also creates the smoother, rounded edges on the dice.<ref name=awesomedice>[http://www.awesomedice.com/blog/64/how-dice-are-made/ How Dice Are Made] from Awesome Dice</ref>

Precision casino dice may have a polished or sand finish, making them transparent or translucent respectively. Casino dice have their pips drilled, then filled flush with a paint of the same [[density]] as the material used for the dice, such that the center of gravity of the dice is as close to the geometric center as possible. All such dice are stamped with a serial number to prevent potential cheaters from substituting a die.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Precision backgammon dice are made the same way; they tend to be slightly smaller and have rounded corners and edges, to allow better movement inside the dice cup and stop forceful rolls from damaging the playing surface.{{fact|date=September 2013}}

==Terms==
While the terms ''[[ace]]'', ''deuce'', ''trey'', ''cater'', ''cinque'' and ''sice'' have been made obsolete by one to six, they are still used by some professional gamblers to designate different sides of the dice. ''Ace'' is from the Latin ''as'', meaning "a unit";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/ace |title=ace |publisher=AskOxford |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref> the others are 2 to 6 in old French.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Notation===
{{Main|Dice notation}}
Using Unicode characters, the faces <big>[[dice notation#In Unicode characters|&#x2680; &#x2681; &#x2682; &#x2683; &#x2684; &#x2685;]]</big>, can be shown in text using the range U+2680&ndash;U+2685 or using decimal <code>&amp;9856;&ndash;&amp;9861;</code>.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dice faces in block Miscellaneous Symbols|url=http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2600.pdf|work=The Unicode standard}}</ref>

In many gaming contexts, especially [[tabletop role-playing game]]s, the count and number of sides of dice to be rolled at any given time is reduced to a common set of notations; typically these involve the letter "d" for dice. Hence, <code>6d8</code> means six eight-sided dice and <code>2d6</code> means two common dice. If an addition to the total rolled is needed, this is added to the end. <code>3d6+4</code> instructs the reader to roll three six-sided dice, calculate the total shown, and add four to it.{{fact|date=September 2013}}

===Loaded dice===
A loaded,  weighted or crooked die is one that has been tampered with so that it will land with a specific side facing upwards more or less often than a fair die would. There are several methods for creating loaded dice, including round faces, off-square faces and weights. "Tappers" have a [[mercury (element)|mercury]] drop in a reservoir at the center, with a [[Capillary action|capillary tube]] leading to another reservoir at a side; the load is activated by tapping the die so that the mercury travels to the side.{{fact|date=September 2013}}

Another type of loaded die is hollow with a small weight and a semi-solid substance inside whose [[melting point]] is just lower than the temperature of the human body, allowing the cheater to change the loading of the die by applying body heat, causing the semi-solid to melt and the weight to drift down, making the chosen opposite face more likely to land up.{{fact|date=September 2013}} A less common type of loaded die can be made by inserting a magnet into the die and embedding a coil of wire in the game table; running current through the coil increases the likelihood of a certain side landing on the bottom, depending on the direction of the current. Transparent [[acetate]] dice, used in all reputable casinos, are harder to tamper with than other dice.{{fact|date=September 2013}}

A die may be shaved on one side, making it slightly shorter in one dimension, thus affecting its outcome. One countermeasure employed by casinos against shaved dice is to measure the dice with a [[micrometer]] before playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Art-of-Iugling-or-Legerdemaine.html |title=fullbooks.com |publisher=fullbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>

==Variants==

===Non-numeric===
The faces of most dice are labelled using sequences of whole numbers, usually starting at one, expressed with either pips or digits. However, there are some applications that require results other than numbers. Examples include letters for [[Boggle]], directions for ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battle]]'', playing card symbols for [[poker dice]], and instructions for sexual acts using [[sex dice]].

[[Image:BluePlatonicDice.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|A [[Platonic solid]]s set of five dice]]
[[File:Orange, 10-sided die.jpg|thumb|upright|[[10-sided die|10-sided dice]] are used in various games, often for generating percentages.]]
Seven- and eight-sided dice are described in the 13th century [[Libro de los juegos]] as having been invented by [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]] in order to speed up play in [[chess variants]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://games.rengeekcentral.com/tc4.html |title=games.rengeekcentral.com |publisher=games.rengeekcentral.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwmat.mat.fc.ul.pt/~jnsilva/HJT2k9/AlfonsoX.pdf |title=wwmat.mat.fc.ul.pt |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref> Around the end of 1960s, non-cubical dice became popular among players of [[Wargaming|wargames]],<ref name="Peterson2012">{{cite book|author=Jon Peterson|title=Playing at the World: A History of Simulating Wars, People and Fantastic Adventures, from Chess to Role-Playing Games|date=July 2012|publisher=Unreason Press|isbn=978-0-615-64204-8|pages=315–318}}</ref> and since have been employed extensively in [[role-playing game]]s and [[trading card game]]s. Reciprocally symmetric numerals like 6 and 9 are distinguished with a dot or underline.

The other four [[Platonic solid]]s are the most common non-cubical dice; these can have [[tetrahedron|4]], [[octahedron|8]], [[dodecahedron|12]], and [[icosahedron|20]] faces. The only other common non-cubical die is the [[pentagonal trapezohedron|10-sided die]]. The [[4-sided die|4-sided platonic solid]] is difficult to roll, and a few games like [[Dayakattai]] and [[Daldøs]] use a 4-sided rolling pin instead.{{fact|date=September 2013}} Using these dice in various ways, games can closely approximate the real probability distributions of the events they simulate. For instance, 10-sided dice can be rolled in pairs to produce a [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]] of random percentages; and summing the values of multiple dice will produce approximations to [[normal distribution]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minitab.com/uploadedFiles/Shared_Resources/Documents/Articles/CentralLimitTheorem.pdf |title= Tumbling Dice & Birthdays: Understanding the Central Limit Theorem |publisher=Minitab |author=Michelle Paret and Eston Martz |date=2009 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref>

Unlike other common dice, a tetrahedral die does not have a side that faces upward when it is at rest on a surface, so it has to be read in a different way. Many such dice have the numbers printed around the points, so that when it settles, the numbers at the vertex pointing up are the same and the one counted. Less commonly, the numbers on a tetrahedral die can be placed at the middle of the edges, in which case the numbers around the base are read.

A die can be constructed in the shape of a sphere, with the addition of an internal cavity in the shape of the [[dual polyhedron]] of the desired die shape and an internal weight. The weight will settle in one of the points of the internal cavity, causing it to settle with one of the numbers uppermost. For instance, a sphere with an octahedral cavity and a small internal weight will settle with one of the 6 points of the cavity held downwards by the weight.

====Standard variations====<!-- This section is linked from [[Dungeons & Dragons]] -->
Dice are often sold in sets, matching in color, of five or six different shapes. They are also sold frequently with a second 10-sided die of a complementary or contrasting color. Sometimes, dice are sold additionally with a die resembling the five Platonic solids, whose faces are [[regular polygon]]s, or the pentagonal [[trapezohedron]] die, whose faces are ten [[kite (geometry)|kites]], each with two different edge lengths, three different angles, and two different kinds of vertices.

Normally, the faces on a die will be numbered sequentially beginning with 1, and opposite faces will thus add up to one more than the number of faces (but in the case of a dice with 4 sides and dice with an odd-number of faces, this is simply not possible). Some dice, such as a dice with 10 sides, are usually numbered sequentially beginning with 0, in which case the opposite faces will add to one less than the number of faces.

|Rounded-off [[triangular prism]]
|This is a rounded-off triangular prism, intended to be rolled like a rolling-pin style die. The die is rounded-off at the edges to make it impossible for it to somehow land on the triangular sides, which makes it look a bit like a jewel. When the die is rolled, one edge (rather than a side) appears facing upwards. On either side of each edge the same number is printed (from 1 to 3). The numbers on either side of the up-facing edge are read as the result of the die roll. Another possible shape is the "[[American Football]]" or "[[Rugby ball]]" shape, where the ends are pointed (with rounded points) rather than just rounded. A third variety features faces that resemble warped squares.
|-

|[[Triangular prism]]
|This is a prism that is thin enough to land either on its "edge" or "face". When landing on an edge, the result is displayed by digits (2–4) close to the prism's top edge. The triangular faces are labeled with the digits 1 and 5.

|[[Pentagonal prism]]
|Similar in constitution to the 5-sided die. When landing on an edge, the topmost edge has pips for 1–5. The pentagonal faces are labeled with the digits 6 and 7.

"Uniform fair dice" are dice where equal probability of the faces follow from the symmetry of the die as it is [[face-transitive]]), and include:
* [[Platonic solid]]s, the five regular polyhedra: 4, 6, 8, 12, 20 sides
* [[Catalan solid]]s, the [[dual polyhedron|duals]] of the 13 [[Archimedean solid]]s: 12, 24, 30, 48, 60, 120 sides
* [[Bipyramid]]s, the duals of the infinite set of [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]], with triangle faces: any even number above 4
* [[Trapezohedron]]s, the duals of the infinite set of [[antiprism]]s, with kite faces: any even number above 4
* [[Disphenoid]]s, an infinite set of tetrahedra made from congruent non-regular triangles: 4 sides

Dice with an odd number of flat faces can be made as "rolling-pin style dice".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aleakybos.ch/Properties%20of%20Dice.pdf |title=Properties of Dice |publisher=http://www.aleakybos.ch |date= |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref> They are based on an infinite set of [[prism (geometry)|prisms]]. All the (rectangular) faces they may actually land on are congruent, so they are equally fair. (The other 2 sides of the prism are rounded or capped with a pyramid, designed so that the die never actually rests on those faces.)

==Application in role-playing games==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2008}}
[[Image:Wuerfel5.jpg|thumb|180px|Typical role-playing dice, showing a variety of colors and styles. Note the older hand-inked green 12-sided die (showing an 11), manufactured before pre-inked dice were common. Many players collect or acquire a large number of mixed and unmatching dice.]]
The fantasy role-playing game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' (D&D) is largely credited with popularizing dice in such games. Some games use only one type, like ''[[Exalted]]'' which uses only ten-sided dice. Others use numerous types for different game purposes, such as D&D, which makes use of all common polyhedral dice.

Dice are used to determine the outcome of events; such usage is called a ''check''. Games typically determine results either as a total on one or more dice above or below a fixed number, or a certain number of rolls above a certain number on one or more dice. Due to circumstances or character skill, the initial roll may have a number added to or subtracted from the final result, or have the player roll extra or fewer dice. To keep track of rolls easily, [[dice notation]] is frequently used.

A common special case is percentile rolls, referred to as <code>1d100</code> or <code>1d%</code>. Since [[zocchihedron|actual hundred-sided dice]] are large, almost spherical, and difficult to read, percentile rolls are instead handled by rolling two ten-sided dice together, using one as the "tens" and the other as the "units". A roll of ten or zero on either die is taken as a zero, unless both are zeros or tens, in which case this is 100. Some sets of percentile dice explicitly mark one die in tens and the other in units to avoid ambiguity.

Dice for role-playing games are usually plastic; early polyhedral dice from the 1970s and 1980s were made of a soft plastic that would easily wear as the die was used, and wear would gradually render the die unusable. Many early dice were unmarked, and players took great care in painting them. Some twenty-sided dice then were numbered zero through nine twice; half of the numbers had to be painted a contrasting color to differentiate faces. These could double as a ten-sided die by ignoring the distinguishing coloring.

==Application in divination==
Dice can be used for divination and using dice for such a purpose is called [[cleromancy]]. A pair of common dice is usual, though other forms of polyhedra can be used. Tibetan Buddhists sometimes use this [[Mo (divination)|method of divination]]. It is highly likely that the [[Pythagoreans]] used the [[Platonic solids]] as dice. They referred to such dice as "the dice of the gods" and they sought to understand the universe through an understanding of geometry in polyhedra.<ref>{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=Kenneth|title=The Pythagorean sourcebook and library : an anthology of ancient writings which relate to Pythagoras and Pythagorean philosophy|year=1988|publisher=Phanes Press|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|isbn=978-0-933999-50-3|oclc=255212063}}</ref>

Astrological dice are a specialized set of three 12-sided dice for divination; the first die represents planets, the Sun, the Moon, and the [[orbital node|nodes]] of the Moon, the second die represents the 12 zodiac signs, and the third represents the 12 houses. An icosahedron provides the answers of the [[Magic 8-Ball]], conventionally used to provide answers to yes-or-no questions.<!-- Does this little fact of trivia about the magic 8 ball really belong in this section?-->
