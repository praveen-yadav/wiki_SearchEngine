'''Cygnus''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|ɡ|n|ə|s}} is a northern [[constellation]] lying on the plane of the [[Milky Way]], deriving its name from the [[Latin]]ized [[Greek language|Greek]] word for [[swan]]. The swan is one of the most recognizable constellations of the northern summer and autumn, it features a prominent [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as the '''Northern Cross''' (in contrast to the [[Southern Cross]]). Cygnus was among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Cygnus contains [[Deneb]], one of the brightest stars in the night sky and one corner of the [[Summer Triangle]], as well as stars with planets, some  notable X-ray sources, and the giant [[stellar association]] of [[Cygnus OB2]]. One of the stars of this association, [[NML Cygni]], is one of the [[List of largest known stars|largest stars currently known]].

== History and mythology ==
[[Image:Lacerta, Cygnus, Lyra, Vulpecula and Anser retouched.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cygnus as depicted in Urania's Mirror, a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. Surrounding it are Lacerta, Vulpecula and Lyra.]]
In [[Greek mythology]], Cygnus has been identified with several different legendary swans. [[Zeus]] disguised himself as a swan to seduce [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], [[Sparta]]n king [[Tyndareus]]'s wife, who gave birth to the [[Castor and Pollux|Gemini]], [[Helen of Troy]] and [[Clytemnestra]];{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}}[[Orpheus]] was transformed into a swan after his murder, and was said to have been placed in the sky next to his [[lyre]] ([[Lyra]]); and the King [[Cygnus]] was transformed into a swan.

The Greeks also associated this constellation with the tragic story of [[Phaethon]], the son of [[Helios]] the sun god, who demanded to ride his father's sun chariot for a day.  Phaethon, however, was unable to control the reins, forcing Zeus to destroy the chariot (and Phaethon) with a thunderbolt, causing it to plummet to the earth into the river [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].  According to the myth, Phaethon's  brother, Cycnus, grieved bitterly and spent many days diving into the river to collect Phaethon's bones to give him a proper burial.  The gods were so touched by Cycnus's devotion to his brother that they turned him into a swan and placed him among the stars.<ref>P.K. Chen (2007) A Constellation Album: Stars and Mythology of the Night Sky, p. 70 (ISBN 978-1931559386).</ref>

In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', there are three people named Cygnus, all of whom are transformed into swans. Alongside Cycnus, noted above, he mentions a boy from [[Vale of Tempe|Tempe]] who commits suicide when [[Phyllius]] refuses to give him a tamed bull that he demands, but is transformed into a swan and flies away. He also mentions a son of [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]] who is an invulnerable warrior in the [[Trojan War]] who is eventually defeated by [[Achilles]], but Neptune saves him by transforming him into a swan.

Cygnus, together with other [[bird|avian]] constellations near the [[summer solstice]], [[Lyra#History|Vultur cadens]] and [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], may be a significant part of the origin of the myth of the [[Stymphalian Birds]], one of [[The Twelve Labours]] of [[Hercules]].<ref>Allen (1963) p. 56.</ref>

===In non-western astronomy===
In [[Polynesia]], Cygnus was often recognized as a separate constellation. In the [[Society Islands]] it was called ''Pirae-tea'', in [[Tonga]] it was called ''Tuula-lupe'', and in the [[Tuamotus]] it was called''Fanui-tai''. Deneb was also often given a name. In [[New Zealand]] it was called ''Mara-tea'', in the [[Society Islands]] it was called ''Pirae-tea'' or ''Taurua-i-te-haapa-raa-manu'', and in the Tuamotus it was called ''Fanui-raro''. Beta Cygni was named in New Zealand; it was likely called ''Whetu-kaupo''. Gamma Cygni was called ''Fanui-runga'' in the Tuamotus.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=282}}

== Characteristics ==
{{expand section|date=May 2013}}
Normally, Cygnus is depicted with Delta and Epsilon Cygni as its wings, Deneb as its tail, and Albireo as the tip of its beak.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}}

There are several [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]s in Cygnus. <!-- needs a sentence about Northern Cross -->[[Patchik 56]] is one less prominent, a small asterism that measures 3.3 by 2.2 arcminutes. Named for its discoverer, Dana Patchik, an amateur astronomer, it appears in small amateur telescopes as a group of six stars described as resembling a [[dolphin]].

{{See also|List of stars in Cygnus}}
There are several bright stars in Cygnus. [[Alpha Cygni]], called Deneb, is the brightest star in Cygnus. It is a blue-white hued [[blue supergiant|supergiant]] star of magnitude 1.3,<ref name="illinois-deneb">{{cite web |url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/deneb.html |title=Deneb |author=Jim Kaler |date=26 Jun 2009 |work=Stars |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 }}</ref> about 3200 light-years away.<ref name="earthsky">{{cite web |url=http://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/deneb-among-the-farthest-stars-to-be-seen |title=Deneb: A distant and very luminous star |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 }}</ref> Its traditional name means "tail" and refers to its position in the constellation. [[Albireo]], designated Beta Cygni, is a celebrated [[binary star]] among amateur astronomers for its contrasting hues. The primary is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 3.1 and the secondary is a blue-green hued star of magnitude 5.1. The system is 380 light-years away and is divisible in large binoculars and all amateur telescopes.<ref name="illinois-albireo">{{cite web |url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/albireo.html |title=Albireo |author=Jim Kaler |work=Stars |accessdate=15 January 2013}}</ref> [[Gamma Cygni]], traditionally named Sadr, is a yellow-tinged supergiant star of magnitude 2.2, 1500 light-years away.

The primary is a blue-white hued giant star of magnitude 2.9, and the secondary is a star of magnitude 6.6. The two components are divisible in a medium-sized amateur telescope.<ref name="illinois-deltacygni">{{cite web |url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/deltacyg.html |title=DELTA CYG |author=Jim Kaler |work=Stars |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 }}</ref> The fifth star in Cygnus above magnitude 3 is Gienah, designated [[Epsilon Cygni]].

There are several other dimmer double and binary stars in Cygnus. [[Mu Cygni]] is a binary star with an optical tertiary component. The binary system has a period of 790 years and is 73 light-years from Earth. The primary and secondary, both white stars, are of magnitude 4.8 and 6.2, respectively. The unrelated tertiary component is of magnitude 6.9. Though the tertiary component is divisible in binoculars, the primary and secondary currently require a medium-sized amateur telescope to split, as they will through the year 2020. The two stars will be closest between 2043 and 2050, when they will require a telescope with larger aperture to split. [[Omicron Cygni]] is a contrasting double star similar to the brighter Albireo. The components, [[30 Cygni]] and [[31 Cygni]], are divisible in binoculars. The primary, 31 Cygni, is an orange-hued star of magnitude 3.8, 1400 light-years from Earth. The secondary, 30 Cygni, is a blue-green hued star of magnitude 4.8, 720 light-years from Earth. 31 Cygni itself is a binary star; the tertiary component is a blue star of magnitude 7.0. [[Psi Cygni]] is a binary star divisible in small amateur telescopes, with two white components. The primary is of magnitude 5.0 and the secondary is of magnitude 7.5. [[61 Cygni]] is a binary star divisible in large binoculars or a small amateur telescope. It is 11.4 light-years from Earth and has a period of 650 years. Both components are orange-hued dwarf ([[main sequence]]) stars; the primary is of magnitude 5.2 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.1. 61 Cygni is significant because [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] determined its [[parallax]] in 1838, the first star to have a known parallax.

The constellation also contains the X-ray source [[Cygnus X-1]], which is now thought to be caused by a [[black hole]] accreting matter in a binary star system. The system is located close to the star Eta Cygni on star charts.<!--needs ''much'' more elaboration; probably most defining feature of constellation-->

Cygnus also contains several other noteworthy X-ray sources. [[Cygnus X-3]] is a [[microquasar]] containing a [[Wolf-Rayet star]] in orbit around a very compact object.<ref name="2Kim">{{cite doi|10.1088/0004-637X/772/1/41}}</ref> While the compact object is thought to be a [[neutron star]] or possibly a black hole,<ref name="Zdziarski">{{cite doi|10.1093/mnrasl/sls035}}</ref> it is possible that the object is instead a more exotic stellar remnant, possibly the first discovered [[quark star]], hypothesized due to its production of cosmic rays<ref name="Baym">{{cite doi|10.1016/0370-2693(85)91489-3}}</ref> that cannot be explained if the object is a normal neutron star.<!--needs more about short period, muon production, cosmic rays, intrinsic luminosity, and gamma-ray flares (this is a very interesting system)-->

Cygnus is also home to several [[variable star]]s. [[SS Cygni]] is a [[dwarf nova]] which undergoes outbursts every 7-8 days. The system's total magnitude varies from 12th magnitude at its dimmest to 8th magnitude at its brightest. The two objects in the system are incredibly close together, with an orbital period of less than 0.28 days.<ref name="Honey">{{cite journal | author=Honey, W.B., ''et al.'' | title=Quiescent and Outburst Photometry of the Dwarf Nova SS Cygni |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=236 |year=1989 |pages=727–734 |bibcode=1989MNRAS.236..727H }}</ref>  [[Chi Cygni]] is a [[red giant]] and the second-brightest [[Mira variable]] star at its maximum. Its maximum magnitude is 3.3 and its minimum magnitude is 14; it has a diameter of 300 [[solar diameter]]s. Chi Cygni has a period of 400 days and is 350 light-years from Earth. [[P Cygni]] is a [[luminous blue variable]] that, in 1600, brightened suddenly to 3rd magnitude. Since 1715, the star has been of 5th magnitude,<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert |last= Burnham, Jr. |year=1978 |title=Burnham's Celestial Handbook: An Observer's Guide to the Universe Beyond the Solar System |edition=Revised and Enlarged |volume=Volume Two |location=[[New York]] |publisher=Dover Publications |pages=772-773}}</ref> despite being more than 5000 light-years from Earth.

It has a maximum magnitude of 5 and a minimum magnitude 8; its period of 130 days.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}} [[NML Cygni]], a red [[hypergiant]] semi-regular variable star and possibly the [[List of largest known stars|largest star currently known]] in the universe, is in Cygnus; it has the magnitude of around 16.60 and an estimated period of about 940 days; it was 5,300 light-years from Earth and has the estimated radius of about 1,650 [[Solar radius|solar radii]].

Cygnus is one of the constellations that the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler satellite]] surveyed in its search for [[extrasolar planet]]s, and as a result, there are many stars in Cygnus with known planets.<ref name="KeplerLocation">{{cite journal |author=NASA Staff|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/314125main_Kepler_presskit_2-19_smfile.pdf |title=Kepler: NASA's First Mission Capable of Finding Earth-Size Planets |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=February 2009 |accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref> One of the most notable systems is the [[Kepler-11]] system, containing six [[transiting planet]]s, all within a plane of approximately one degree.

[[Image:Albireo.jpg|thumb|left|The two component stars of Albireo are easily distinguished, even in a small telescope.]]

=== Deep-sky objects ===
Several [[star cluster]]s and [[nebula]]e are found in Cygnus due to its position on the Milky Way. 

[[Messier 39|M39]] (NGC 7092) is an [[open cluster]] 950 light-years from Earth that is visible to the unaided eye under dark skies. It is loose, with about 30 stars arranged over a wide area; their conformation appears triangular. The brightest stars of M39 are of the 7th magnitude.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}} Another open cluster in Cygnus is [[NGC 6910]], also called the Rocking Horse Cluster, possessing 16 stars with a diameter of 5 arcminutes visible in a small amateur instrument; it is of magnitude 7.4. The brightest of these are two gold-hued stars, which represent the bottom of the toy it is named for. A larger amateur instrument reveals 8 more stars, nebulosity to the east and west of the cluster, and a diameter of 9 arcminutes. The nebulosity in this region is part of the Gamma Cygni Nebula. The other stars, approximately 3700 light-years from Earth, are mostly blue-white and very hot.<ref name="S&T"/>

Other open clusters in Cygnus include [[Dolidze 9]], [[Collinder 421]], [[Dolidze 11]], and [[Berkeley 90]]. Dolidze 9, 2800 light-years from Earth and relatively young at 20 million light-years old, is a faint open cluster with up to 22 stars visible in small and medium-sized amateur telescopes. Nebulosity is visible to the north and east of the cluster, which is 7 arcminutes in diameter. The brightest star appears in the eastern part of the cluster and is of the 7th magnitude; another bright star has a yellow hue. Dolidze 11 is an open cluster 400 million years old, farthest away of the three at 3700 light-years. More than 10 stars are visible in an amateur instrument in this cluster, of similar size to Dolidze 9 at 7 arcminutes in diameter, whose brightest star is of magnitude 7.5. It, too, has nebulosity in the east. Collinder 421 is a particularly old open cluster at an age of approximately 1 billion years; it is of magnitude 10.1. 3100 light-years from Earth, more than 30 stars are visible in a diameter of 8 arcseconds. The prominent star in the north of the cluster has a golden color, whereas the stars in the south of the cluster appear orange. Collinder 421 appears to be embedded in nebulosity, which extends past the cluster's borders to its west. Berkeley 90 is a smaller open cluster, with a diameter of 5 arcminutes. More than 16 members appear in an amateur telescope.<ref name="S&T">{{cite journal |title = Guide Me, Cygnus |last = French |first = Sue |pages = 58–60 |journal = Sky and Telescope |date = September 2012}}</ref>

[[NGC 6826]], the Blinking Planetary Nebula, is a [[planetary nebula]] with a magnitude of 8.5, 3200 light-years from Earth. It appears to "blink" in the eyepiece of a telescope because its central star is unusually bright{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=130–131}} (10th magnitude).{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}} When an observer focuses on the star, the nebula appears to fade out.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=130–131}} Less than one degree from the Blinking Planetary is the double star 16 Cygni.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}}

The [[North America Nebula]] (NGC 7000) is one of the most well-known nebulae in Cygnus, because it is visible to the unaided eye under dark skies, as a bright patch in the Milky Way. However, its characteristic shape is only visible in long-exposure photographs – it is difficult to observe in telescopes because of its low [[surface brightness]]. It has low surface brightness because it is so large; at its widest, the North America Nebula is 2 degrees across. Illuminated by a hot embedded star of magnitude 6, NGC 7000 is 1500 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}}

To the south of [[Epsilon Cygni]] is the [[Veil Nebula]] (NGC 6960, 6962, 6979, 6992, and 6995), a 5,000-year-old [[supernova remnant]] covering approximately 3 degrees of the sky -<ref name="objects"/> it is over 50 light-years long.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}} Because of its appearance, it is also called the [[Cygnus Loop]].<ref name="objects"/> The Loop is only visible in long-exposure astrophotographs. However, the brightest portion, NGC 6992, is faintly visible in binoculars, and a dimmer portion, NGC 6960, is visible in wide-angle telescopes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}}

The Northern Coalsack Nebula, also called the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Cygnus Rift]], is a [[dark nebula]] located in the Cygnus Milky Way.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134–137}}

The [[Gamma Cygni Nebula]] (IC 1318) includes both bright and dark nebulae in an area of over 4 degrees. [[DWB 87]] is another of the many bright emission nebulae in Cygnus, 7.8 by 4.3 arcminutes. It is in the Gamma Cygni area. Two other emission nebulae include [[Sharpless 2-112]] and [[Sharpless 2-115]]. When viewed in an amateur telescope, Sharpless 2–112 appears to be in a teardrop shape. More of the nebula's eastern portion is visible with an [[O III]] (doubly ionized oxygen) filter. There is an orange star of magnitude 10 nearby and a star of magnitude 9 near the nebula's northwest edge. Further to the northwest, there is a dark rift and another bright patch. The whole nebula measures 15 arcminutes in diameter. Sharpless 2–115 is another emission nebula with a complex pattern of light and dark patches. Two pairs of stars appear in the nebula; it is larger near the southwestern pair. The open cluster Berkeley 90 is embedded in this large nebula, which measures 30 by 20 arcminutes.<ref name="S&T"/> 

Also of note is the [[Crescent Nebula]] (NGC 6888), located between Gamma and Eta Cygni, which was formed by the [[Wolf-Rayet star]] [[WR 136|HD 192163]].

In recent years, amateur astronomers have made some notable Cygnus discoveries.  The "[[Soap bubble nebula]]" (PN G75.5+1.7), near the Crescent nebula, was discovered on a digital image by Dave Jurasevich in 2007.  In 2011, Austrian amateur Matthias Kronberger discovered a planetary nebula ([[Kronberger 61]], now nicknamed "The Soccer Ball") on old survey photos, confirmed recently in images by the Gemini Observatory; both of these are likely too faint to be detected by eye in a small amateur scope.

But a much more obscure and relatively 'tiny' object—one which is readily seen in dark skies by amateur telescopes, under good conditions—is the newly discovered nebula (likely reflection type) associated with the star 4 Cygni (HD 183056): an approximately fan-shaped glowing region of several arcminutes' diameter, to the south and west of the fifth-magnitude star.  It was first discovered visually near San Jose, California and publicly reported by amateur astronomer Stephen Waldee in 2007, and was confirmed photographically by Al Howard in 2010.  California amateur astronomer Dana Patchick also says he detected it on the Palomar Observatory survey photos in 2005 but had not published it for others to confirm and analyze at the time of Waldee's first official notices and later 2010 paper.

[[Cygnus-X (star complex)|Cygnus X]] is the largest star-forming region in the Solar neighborhood and includes not only some of the [[Most luminous stars|brightest]] and [[List of most massive stars|most massive]] stars known (such as [[Cygnus OB2-12]]), but also [[Cygnus OB2]], a massive [[stellar association]] classified by some authors as a young [[globular cluster]].

[[File:Stars Brewing in Cygnus X.jpg|thumb|right|A bubbling cauldron of star birth is highlighted in this image from NASA's [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].]]

More [[supernova]]e have been seen in the [[Fireworks Galaxy]] (NGC 6946) than in any other [[galaxy]].

[[Cygnus A]] is the first [[radio galaxy]] discovered; at a distance of 730 million light-years from Earth, it is the closest powerful radio galaxy. In the [[visible spectrum]], it appears as an [[elliptical galaxy]] in a small [[galaxy cluster|cluster]]. It is classified as an [[active galaxy]] because the [[supermassive black hole]] at its [[active galactic nucleus|nucleus]] is accreting matter, which produces two [[polar jet|jets]] of matter from the poles. The jets' interaction with the [[interstellar medium]] creates radio lobes, one source of radio emissions.<ref name="objects">{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |first1 = Jamie |last1 = Wilkins |first2 = Robert |last2 = Dunn |publisher = Firefly Books |year = 2006 |location = Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}</ref>
