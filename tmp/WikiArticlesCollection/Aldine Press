'''Aldine Press''' was the [[printing]] office started by [[Aldus Manutius]] in 1494 in [[Venice]], from which were issued the celebrated Aldine editions of the classics (Latin and Greek masterpieces plus a few more modern works). The Aldine Press is famous in the history of [[typography]], among other things, for the introduction of [[italics]]. The press was the first to issue printed books in the small [[octavo (book)|octavo]] size, similar to that of a modern paperback, and like that intended for portability and ease of reading. The press issued 127 editions during the lifetime of Aldus. The press was continued after Aldus’s death in 1515 by his wife and her father until his son Paolo (1512–1574) took over. His grandson Aldo then ran the firm until his death in 1597. Due to the firm's commercial success many pirated editions were also produced in Lyons and elsewhere. Today, antique books printed by the Aldine Press in Venice are referred to as '''Aldines'''.<ref name="princetonlibrary">{{cite web|url=http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/hb/cases/aldines/index.html|title=Hand Bookbindings|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Library|accessdate=12 January 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091127172502/http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/hb/cases/aldines/index.html| archivedate= 27 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Initial innovations==
The press was started by Aldus based on his love of classics, and at first printed new copies of Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek and Latin classics. He also printed dictionaries and grammars to help people interpret the books. While scholars wanting to learn Greek used to employ learned Greeks to teach them directly, the Aldine editions, edited by Greek scholars, allowed many scholars across Europe to study Greek.<ref>Eisenstein, E. (1979). ''The Printing Press as an Agent of Change''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.</ref> Historian [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]] claimed that the fall of [[Constantinople]] in 1453 had threatened the importance and survival of Greek scholarship, but publications such as those by the Aldine Press secured it. [[Erasmus]] was one of the scholars learned in Greek that the Aldine Press employed. 

When the press expanded to current titles, they wrote some books themselves and employed other writers, including [[Erasmus]]. As this expansion into current languages (mainly Italian and French) and current topics continued, the press took on another role and made perhaps even more important contributions. Beyond the preservation of Hellenic studies, Aldus's contributions are also respected in the development of a smaller type than others in use. His contemporaries called it ''Aldine Type''; today we call it ''italics''. Their logo of the anchor and dolphin is represented today in the symbols and names used by some modern publishers such as [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]].
