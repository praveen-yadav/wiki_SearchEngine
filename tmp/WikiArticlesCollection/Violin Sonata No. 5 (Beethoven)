The '''Violin Sonata No. 5''' in [[F major]], Opus 24, is a [[violin sonata]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. It is often known as the "Spring" sonata (Fr√ºhlingssonate), and was published in [[1801 in music|1801]].  Its dedicatee was [[:de:Moritz Reichsgraf von Fries|Count Moritz von Fries]], a patron to whom the [[Violin Sonata No. 4 (Beethoven)|fourth violin sonata]], the [[String Quintet, Op. 29 (Beethoven)|string quintet]] of the same year, and the [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|seventh symphony]] were also dedicated.

The work is in four movements:

#''[[Allegro (music)|Allegro]]''
#''[[Adagio (music)|Adagio]] molto espressivo''
#''[[Scherzo]]: [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] molto''
#''[[Rondo]]: [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] ma non troppo''

The Scherzo and its trio are particularly brief. The entire sonata takes approximately 22 minutes to perform.

The Allegro movement is featured in stage show [[Fame (musical)|"Fame"]].
