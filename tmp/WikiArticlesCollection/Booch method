The '''Booch method''' is a technique used in [[software engineering]]. It is an [[object modeling language]] and methodology that was widely used in [[object-oriented analysis and design]]. It was developed by [[Grady Booch]], while at [[Rational Software]] (now part of [[IBM]]).

The notation aspect of the Booch method has now been superseded by the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), which features graphical elements from the Booch method along with elements from the [[object-modeling technique]] (OMT) and [[object-oriented software engineering]] (OOSE).

Methodological aspects of the Booch method have been incorporated into several methodologies and processes, the primary such methodology being the [[Rational Unified Process]] (RUP).

The Booch design methodology, like OMT, is extensively used and has ample documentation and support tools.
