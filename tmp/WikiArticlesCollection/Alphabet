An '''alphabet''' is a standard set of [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] (basic written [[symbols]] or [[graphemes]]) which is used to write one or more [[language]]s based on the general principle that the letters represent [[phoneme]]s (basic significant sounds) of the [[spoken language]]. This is in contrast to other types of [[writing system]]s, such as [[syllabary|syllabaries]] (in which each character represents a [[syllable]]) and [[logograph]]ies (in which each character represents a word, [[morpheme]], or semantic unit).

A '''true alphabet''' has letters for the [[vowel]]s of a language as well as the [[consonant]]s. The first "true alphabet" in this sense is believed to be the [[Greek alphabet]],<ref name="Blackwell">{{cite book|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|title=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems|year=1996|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |location=Oxford|isbn=0-631-21481-X}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Millard|1986|p=396}}</ref> which is a modified form of the [[Phoenician alphabet]]. In other types of alphabet either the vowels are not indicated at all, as was the case in the Phoenician alphabet (such systems are known as [[abjad]]s), or else the vowels are shown by [[diacritic]]s or modification of consonants, as in the [[devanagari]] used in India and Nepal (these systems are known as [[abugida]]s or alphasyllabaries).

There are dozens of alphabets in use today, the most popular being the [[Latin alphabet]]<ref>{{harvnb|Haarmann|2004|p=96}}</ref> (which was derived from the Greek). Many languages use modified forms of the Latin alphabet, with additional letters formed using diacritical marks. One of these is the English language, which has 26 letters as goes like this; a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z. While most alphabets have letters composed of lines ([[linear writing]]), there are also [[non-linear writing|exceptions]] such as the alphabets used in [[Braille]], [[fingerspelling]], and [[Morse code]].

Alphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of their letters. This makes them useful for purposes of [[collation]], specifically by allowing words to be sorted in [[alphabetical order]]. It also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of "numbering" ordered items, in such contexts as [[numbered list]]s.

==Etymology==
The English word ''alphabet'' came into [[Middle English]] from the [[Late Latin]] word ''alphabetum'', which in turn originated in the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀλφάβητος (''alphabētos''), from ''[[alpha (letter)|alpha]]'' and ''[[beta (letter)|beta]],'' the first two letters of the [[Greek alphabet]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=alphabet&query=alphabet/ Encyclopædia Britannica Online&nbsp;– Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary]</ref> ''Alpha'' and ''beta'' in turn came from the first two letters of the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and originally meant ''ox'' and ''house'' respectively.

==History==
{{Main|History of the alphabet}}
[[File:Caslon-schriftmusterblatt.jpeg|thumb|300px|''A Specimen'' of [[typeset]] [[font]]s and [[language]]s, by [[William Caslon]], letter founder; from the 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]''.]]

===Middle Eastern scripts===
The history of the alphabet started in [[ancient Egypt]]. By the 27th century BC Egyptian writing had a set of some [[Egyptian uniliteral signs|24 hieroglyphs]] which are called uniliterals,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2451890 |title=The Development of the Western Alphabet |accessdate=2008-08-04 |author=Lynn, Bernadette |date=2004-04-08 |work=h2g2 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> to represent syllables that begin with a single [[consonant]] of their language, plus a vowel (or no vowel) to be supplied by the native speaker. These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for [[logogram]]s, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names.<ref name=Daniels>Daniels and Bright (1996), pp. 74–75</ref>

[[File:Ba`alat.png|thumb|left|A specimen of [[Proto-Sinaitic script]], one of the earliest (if not the very first) phonemic scripts]]
In the [[Middle Bronze Age]] an apparently "alphabetic" system known as the [[Proto-Sinaitic script]] appears in Egyptian turquoise mines in the [[Sinai peninsula]] dated to circa the 15th century BC, apparently left by Canaanite workers. In 1999, John and Deborah Darnell discovered an even earlier version of this first alphabet at Wadi el-Hol dated to circa 1800 BC and showing evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of Egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to circa 2000 BC, strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had been developed circa that time.<ref>J. C. Darnell, F. W. Dobbs-Allsopp, Marilyn J. Lundberg, P. Kyle McCarter, and Bruce Zuckermanet, “Two early alphabetic inscriptions from the Wadi el-Hol: new evidence for the origin of the alphabet from the western desert of Egypt.” The Annual of the American Schools of Oriental Research, 59 (2005).</ref> Based on letter appearances and names, it is believed to be based on Egyptian hieroglyphs.<ref name="Coulmas 140">Coulmas (1989), p. 140–141.</ref> This script had no characters representing vowels. An alphabetic [[cuneiform]] script with 30 signs including three which indicate the following vowel was invented in [[Ugarit]] before the 15th century BC. This script was not used after the destruction of Ugarit.<ref>''Ugaritic Writing'' [http://www.mazzaroth.com/ChapterThree/UgariticWriting.htm online]</ref>

The Proto-Sinaitic script eventually developed into the [[Phoenician alphabet]], which is conventionally called "Proto-Canaanite" before ca. 1050 BC.<ref name="Daniels 9296"/> The oldest text in Phoenician script is an inscription on the sarcophagus of King [[Ahiram]]. This script is the parent script of all western alphabets. By the tenth century two other forms can be distinguished namely [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] and [[Aramaic]]. The Aramaic gave rise to [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]].<ref>"Coulmas"(1989),p.142</ref>  The [[South Arabian alphabet]], a sister script to the Phoenician alphabet, is the script from which the [[Ge'ez alphabet]] (an [[abugida]]) is descended. Vowelless alphabets, which are not true alphabets, are called [[abjad]]s, currently exemplified in scripts including [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]]. The omission of vowels was not a satisfactory solution and some "weak" consonants were used to indicate the vowel quality of a syllable ([[Mater lectionis|matres lectionis]]). These had dual function since they were also used as pure consonants.<ref>"Coulmas" (1989) p.147.</ref>

The Proto-Sinatic or Proto Canaanite script and the [[Ugaritic script]] were the first scripts with limited number of signs, in contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time, [[Cuneiform]], [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], and [[Linear B]]. The Phoenician script was probably the first phonemic script<ref name="Coulmas 140"/><ref name="Daniels 9296">Daniels and Bright (1996), pp 92-96</ref> and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters, making it a script simple enough for common traders to learn. Another advantage of Phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages, since it recorded words phonemically.

The script was spread by the Phoenicians, across the Mediterranean.<ref name="Daniels 9296" /> In Greece, the script was modified to add the vowels, giving rise to the ancestor of all alphabets in the West. The indication of the vowels is the same way as the indication of the consonants, therefore it was the first true alphabet. The Greeks took letters which did not represent sounds that existed in Greek, and changed them to represent the vowels. The vowels are significant in the Greek language, and the syllabical [[Linear B]] script which was used by the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] Greeks from the 16th century BC had 87 symbols including 5 vowels. In its early years, there were many variants of the Greek alphabet, a situation which caused many different alphabets to evolve from it.

===European alphabets===
[[File:ZographensisColour.jpg|thumb|[[Codex Zographensis]] in the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] from Medieval [[Bulgaria]]]]
The [[Greek alphabet]], in its [[Euboean alphabet|Euboean form]], was carried over by Greek colonists to the Italian peninsula, where it gave rise to a variety of alphabets used to write the [[Italic languages]]. One of these became the [[Latin alphabet]], which was spread across Europe as the Romans expanded their empire. Even after the fall of the Roman state, the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works. It eventually became used for the descendant languages of Latin (the [[Romance languages]]) and then for most of the other languages of Europe.

Some adaptations of the Latin alphabet are augmented with [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], such as [[æ]] in [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Ou (letter)|Ȣ]] in [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]; by borrowings from other alphabets, such as the [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] þ in [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which came from the [[Runic alphabet|Futhark]] runes; and by modifying existing letters, such as the [[Eth (letter)|eth]] ð of Old English and Icelandic, which is a modified ''d''. Other alphabets only use a subset of the Latin alphabet, such as Hawaiian, and [[Italian language|Italian]], which uses the letters ''j, k, x, y'' and ''w'' only in foreign words.

Another notable script is [[Elder Futhark]], which is believed to have evolved out of one of the [[Old Italic alphabet]]s. Elder Futhark gave rise to a variety of alphabets known collectively as the [[Runic alphabet]]s. The Runic alphabets were used for Germanic languages from AD 100 to the late Middle Ages. Its usage is mostly restricted to engravings on stone and jewelry, although inscriptions have also been found on bone and wood. These alphabets have since been replaced with the Latin alphabet, except for decorative usage for which the runes remained in use until the 20th century.

The [[Old Hungarian script]] is a contemporary writing system of the Hungarians. It was in use during the entire history of Hungary, albeit not as an official writing system. From the 19th century it once again became more and more popular.

The [[Glagolitic alphabet]] was the initial script of the liturgical language [[Old Church Slavonic]] and became, together with the Greek uncial script, the basis of the [[Cyrillic script]]. Cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts, and is notable for its use in Slavic languages and also for other languages within the former [[Soviet Union]]. [[Cyrillic alphabets]] include the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian]], [[Macedonian alphabet|Macedonian]], [[Bulgarian alphabet|Bulgarian]], and [[Russian alphabet]]s. The Glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], while the Cyrillic alphabet was invented by the Bulgarian scholar [[Clement of Ohrid]], who was their disciple. They feature many letters that appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by the [[Greek alphabet]] and the [[Hebrew alphabet]].

===Asian alphabets===
Beyond the logographic [[Written Chinese|Chinese writing]], many phonetic scripts are in existence in Asia. The [[Arabic alphabet]], [[Hebrew alphabet]], [[Syriac alphabet]], and other [[abjad]]s of the Middle East are developments of the [[Aramaic alphabet]], but because these writing systems are largely [[consonant]]-based they are often not considered true alphabets.

Most alphabetic scripts of India and Eastern Asia are descended from the [[Brahmi script]], which is often believed to be a descendant of Aramaic.

[[File:Zhuyin on cell phone detail.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|[[Zhuyin]] on a cell phone]]

In [[Korea]], the [[Hangul]] alphabet was created by [[Sejong the Great]]<ref>"上親制諺文二十八字…是謂訓民正音(His majesty created 28 characters himself... It is [[Hunminjeongeum]] (original name for [[Hangul]]))", 《세종실록 (The Annals of the Choson Dynasty : Sejong)》 25년 12월.</ref> Hangul is a unique alphabet: it is a [[featural alphabet]], where many of the letters are designed from a sound's place of articulation (P to look like the widened mouth, L to look like the tongue pulled in, etc.); its design was planned by the government of the day; and it places individual letters in syllable clusters with equal dimensions, in the same way as [[Chinese characters]], to allow for mixed-script writing{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} (one syllable always takes up one type-space no matter how many letters get stacked into building that one sound-block).

[[Zhuyin]] (sometimes called ''Bopomofo'') is a [[semi-syllabary]] used to phonetically transcribe [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] in the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]]. After the later establishment of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and its adoption of [[Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]], the use of Zhuyin today is limited, but it's still widely used in [[Taiwan]] where the Republic of China still governs. Zhuyin developed out of a form of Chinese shorthand based on Chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary. Like an alphabet the phonemes of [[syllable onset|syllable initials]] are represented by individual symbols, but like a syllabary the phonemes of the [[syllable rime|syllable finals]] are not; rather, each possible final (excluding the [[Syllable#Medial and final|medial glide]]) is represented by its own symbol. For example, ''luan'' is represented as ㄌㄨㄢ (''l-u-an''), where the last symbol ㄢ represents the entire final ''-an''. While Zhuyin is not used as a mainstream writing system, it is still often used in ways similar to a [[romanization]] system—that is, for aiding in pronunciation and as an input method for Chinese characters on computers and cellphones.

European alphabets, especially Latin and Cyrillic, have been adapted for many languages of Asia. Arabic is also widely used, sometimes as an abjad (as with [[Urdu alphabet|Urdu]] and [[Persian alphabet|Persian]]) and sometimes as a complete alphabet (as with [[Kurdish alphabet|Kurdish]] and [[Uyghur alphabet|Uyghur]]).

{{alphabet}}

The term "alphabet" is used by [[Linguistics|linguists]] and [[paleographer]]s in both a wide and a narrow sense. In the wider sense, an alphabet is a script that is ''segmental'' at the [[phoneme]] level—that is, it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words. In the narrower sense, some scholars distinguish "true" alphabets from two other types of segmental script, [[abjad]]s and [[abugida]]s. These three differ from each other in the way they treat vowels: abjads have letters for consonants and leave most vowels unexpressed; abugidas are also consonant-based, but indicate vowels with [[diacritic]]s to or a systematic graphic modification of the consonants. In alphabets in the narrow sense, on the other hand, consonants and vowels are written as independent letters.<ref>For critics of the abjad-abugida-alphabet distinction, see Reinhard G. Lehmann: "27-30-22-26. How Many Letters Needs an Alphabet? The Case of Semitic", in: The idea of writing: Writing across borders / edited by Alex de Voogt and Joachim Friedrich Quack, Leiden: Brill 2012, p. 11-52, esp p. 22-27</ref> The earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is the [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|Wadi el-Hol script]], believed to be an abjad, which through its successor [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] is the ancestor of modern alphabets, including [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] (via the [[Old Italic alphabet]]), [[Cyrillic]] (via the Greek alphabet) and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] (via [[Aramaic]]).

Examples of present-day abjads are the [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew script]]s; true alphabets include [[Latin script|Latin]], Cyrillic, and Korean [[hangul]]; and abugidas are used to write [[tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], [[Amharic language|Amharic]], [[Hindi]], and [[Thai language|Thai]]. The [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]] are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as their name would imply, since each glyph stands for a consonant which is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel. (In a true syllabary, each consonant-vowel combination would be represented by a separate glyph.)

All three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs. [[Ugaritic script|Ugaritic]], for example, is basically an abjad, but has syllabic letters for {{IPA|/ʔa, ʔi, ʔu/}}. (These are the only time vowels are indicated.) Cyrillic is basically a true alphabet, but has syllabic letters for {{IPA|/ja, je, ju/}} (я, е, ю); [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] has a letter for {{IPA|/ti/}}. [[Devanagari]] is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for initial vowels, though some traditions use अ as a [[zero consonant]] as the graphic base for such vowels.

The boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always clear-cut. For example, [[Sorani]] [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is written in the [[Arabic script]], which is normally an abjad. However, in Kurdish, writing the vowels is mandatory, and full letters are used, so the script is a true alphabet. Other languages may use a Semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics, effectively making them abugidas. On the other hand, the [[Phagspa script]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] was based closely on the [[Tibetan script|Tibetan abugida]], but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks. Although short ''a'' was not written, as in the Indic abugidas, one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet. Conversely, the vowel marks of the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Tigrinya abugida]] and the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Amharic abugida]] (ironically, the original source of the term "abugida") have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script. Even more extreme, the Pahlavi abjad eventually became [[logogram|logographic]]. (See below.)
[[File:Ethiopic genesis.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Ge'ez Script]] of [[Ethiopia]]]]
Thus the primary [[Categorisation|classification]] of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels. For [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal languages]], further classification can be based on their treatment of tone, though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types. Some alphabets disregard tone entirely, especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load, as in [[Somali language|Somali]] and many other languages of Africa and the Americas. Such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels. Most commonly, tones are indicated with diacritics, the way vowels are treated in abugidas. This is the case for [[Vietnamese alphabet|Vietnamese]] (a true alphabet) and [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] (an abugida). In Thai, tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant, with diacritics for disambiguation. In the [[Pollard script]], an abugida, vowels are indicated by diacritics, but the placement of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone. More rarely, a script may have separate letters for tones, as is the case for [[Hmong alphabet|Hmong]] and [[Zhuang alphabet|Zhuang]]. For most of these scripts, regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used, the most common tone is not marked, just as the most common vowel is not marked in Indic abugidas; in [[Zhuyin]] not only is one of the tones unmarked, but there is a diacritic to indicate lack of tone, like the [[virama]] of Indic.

The number of letters in an alphabet can be quite small. The Book [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] script, an abjad, had only twelve letters at one point, and may have had even fewer later on. Today the [[Rotokas alphabet]] has only twelve letters. (The [[Hawaiian alphabet]] is sometimes claimed to be as small, but it actually consists of 18 letters, including the [[ʻokina]] and five long vowels.  However, [[Hawaiian Braille]] has only 13 letters.) While Rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent (just eleven), Book Pahlavi was small because many letters had been ''conflated''—that is, the graphic distinctions had been lost over time, and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes. For example, a comma-shaped letter represented ''g, d, y, k,'' or ''j''. However, such apparent simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated. In later Pahlavi [[papyrus|papyri]], up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions of these twelve letters were lost, and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all, but instead each word had to be learned as a whole—that is, they had become [[logogram]]s as in Egyptian [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]]. 

The largest segmental script is probably an abugida, [[Devanagari]]. When written in Devanagari, Vedic [[Sanskrit]] has an alphabet of 53 letters, including the ''visarga'' mark for final aspiration and special letters for ''kš'' and ''jñ,'' though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used. The Hindi alphabet must represent both Sanskrit and modern vocabulary, and so has been expanded to 58 with the ''khutma'' letters (letters with a dot added) to represent sounds from Persian and English. Thai has a total of 59 symbols, consisting of 44 consonants, 13 vowels and 2 syllabics, not including 4 diacritics for tone marks and one for vowel length.

The largest known abjad is [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], with 51 letters. The largest alphabets in the narrow sense include [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] and [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] (for [[Cyrillic]]), with 58 and 56 letters, respectively, and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] (for the [[Latin script]]), with 46. However, these scripts either count [[digraph (orthography)|di- and tri-graphs]] as separate letters, as Spanish did with ''ch'' and ''ll'' until recently, or uses [[diacritic]]s like Slovak ''č''. The largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent is probably [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]], with 41 letters.

Syllabaries typically contain 50 to 400 glyphs, and the glyphs of logographic systems typically number from the many hundreds into the thousands. Thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script.

==Alphabetical order==
{{main|Alphabetical order}}
Alphabets often come to be associated with a standard ordering of their letters, which can then be used for purposes of [[collation]] – namely for the listing of words and other items in what is called ''[[alphabetical order]]''.

The Case of Semitic", in: The idea of writing: Writing across borders / edited by Alex de Voogt and Joachim Friedrich Quack, Leiden: Brill 2012, p. 11-52</ref> is well established, although languages using this alphabet have different conventions for their treatment of modified letters (such as the [[French language|French]] ''é'', ''à'', and ''ô'') and of certain combinations of letters ([[multigraph]]s). In French, these are not considered to be additional letters for the purposes of collation. However, in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], the accented letters such as ''á'', ''í'', and ''ö'' are considered to be distinct letters of the alphabet. In Spanish, ''ñ'' is considered a separate letter, but accented vowels such as ''á'' and ''é'' are not. The ''ll'' and ''ch'' were also considered single letters, but in 1994 the [[Real Academia Española]] changed collating order so that ''ll'' is between ''lk'' and ''lm'' in the dictionary and ''ch'' is between ''cg'' and ''ci'', and in 2010 the tenth congress of the [[Association of Spanish Language Academies]] changed it so they were no longer letters at all<ref>Real Academia Española. "Spanish Pronto!: Spanish Alphabet." Spanish Pronto! 22 April 2007. January 2009 [http://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html#english Spanish Pronto: Spanish ↔ English Medical Translators.]</ref><ref>"La “i griega” se llamará “ye”". Cuba Debate. 2010-11-05. Retrieved 12 December 2010. [http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2010/11/05/la-i-griega-se-llamara-ye-y-la-ch-y-la-ll-desaparecen-por-decreto-de-la-academia-espanola/ Cubadebate.cu]</ref>

In German, words starting with ''sch-'' (constituting the German phoneme {{IPAslink|ʃ}}) would be intercalated between words with initial ''sca-'' and ''sci-'' (all incidentally loanwords) instead of this graphic cluster appearing after the letter ''s'', as though it were a single letter—a [[Lexicography|lexicographical]] policy which would be de rigueur in a dictionary of [[Albanian alphabet|Albanian]], i.e. ''dh-'', ''ë-'', ''gj-'', ''ll-'', ''rr-'', ''th-'', ''xh-'' and ''zh-'' (all representing phonemes and considered separate single letters) would follow the letters ''d'', ''e'', ''g'', ''l'', ''n'', ''r'', ''t'', ''x'' and ''z'' respectively. Nor is, in a dictionary of English, the lexical section with initial ''th-'' reserved a place after the letter ''t'', but is inserted between ''te-'' and ''ti-''. German words with [[Trema (diacritic)|umlaut]] would further be alphabetized as if there were no umlaut at all—contrary to [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish]] which allegedly adopted the [[German alphabet|German]] [[grapheme]]s '''ö''' and '''ü''', and where a word like ''tüfek'', would come after ''tuz'', in the dictionary. An exception is the German phonebook where umlauts are sorted like ''ä'' = ''ae'' since names as ''Jäger'' appear also with the spelling ''Jaeger'', and there's no telling them apart in the spoken language.

The [[Danish and Norwegian alphabet]]s end with ''æ''—''ø''—''å'', whereas the Icelandic, Swedish and Finnish ones conventionally put ''å''—''ä''—''ö'' at the end.

It is unknown whether the earliest alphabets had a defined sequence. Some alphabets today, such as the [[Hanuno'o script]], are learned one letter at a time, in no particular order, and are not used for [[collation]] where a definite order is required. However, a dozen [[Ugaritic alphabet|Ugaritic]] tablets from the fourteenth century BC preserve the alphabet in two sequences. One, the ''ABCDE'' order later used in Phoenician, has continued with minor changes in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]], [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]], [[Cyrillic]], and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]]; the other, ''HMĦLQ,'' was used in southern Arabia and is preserved today in [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ethiopic]].<ref>Millard, A.R. "The Infancy of the Alphabet", ''World Archaeology'' 17, No. 3, Early Writing Systems (February 1986): 390–398. page 395.</ref> Both orders have therefore been stable for at least 3000 years.

The historical order was abandoned in [[Runic alphabet|Runic]] and [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], although Arabic retains the traditional [[abjadi order]] for numbering.

The [[Brahmic family]] of alphabets used in India use a unique order based on [[phonology]]: The letters are arranged according to how and where they are produced in the mouth. This organization is used in Southeast Asia, Tibet, Korean [[hangul]], and even Japanese [[kana]], which is not an alphabet.

==Names of letters==
The Phoenician letter names, in which each letter was associated with a word that begins with that sound, continue to be used to varying degrees in [[Samaritan alphabet|Samaritan]], [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]. The names were abandoned in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel (usually e) before or after the consonant (the exception is zeta, which was retained from Greek). In Cyrillic originally the letters were given names based on Slavic words; this was later abandoned as well in favor of a system similar to that used in Latin.

==Orthography and pronunciation==

When an alphabet is adopted or developed for use in representing a given language, an [[orthography]] generally comes into being, providing rules for the [[spelling]] of words in that language. In accordance with the principle on which alphabets are based, these rules will generally map letters of the alphabet to the [[phoneme]]s (significant sounds) of the spoken language. In a perfectly [[phonemic orthography]] there would be a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the letters and the phonemes, so that a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling. However this ideal is not normally achieved in practice; some languages (such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) come close to it, while others (such as English) deviate from it to a much larger degree.

The pronunciation of a language often evolves independently of its writing system, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.

Languages may fail to achieve a one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways:
* A language may represent a given phoneme with a combination of letters rather than just a single letter. Two-letter combinations are called [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s and three-letter groups are called [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s. [[German language|German]] uses the [[tetragraph]]s (four letters) "tsch" for the phoneme {{IPA-de|tʃ|}} and "dsch" for {{IPA|[dʒ]}}, although the latter is rare. [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] also uses a tetragraph for one of its phonemes, namely "кхъу". Two letters representing one sound is widely used in Hungarian as well (where, for instance, ''cs'' stands for [č], ''sz'' for [s], ''zs'' for [ž], ''dzs'' for [ǰ], etc.).
* A language may represent the same phoneme with two different letters or combinations of letters. An example is [[modern Greek]] which may write the phoneme {{IPA-el|i|}} in six different ways: {{angbr|ι}}, {{angbr|η}}, {{angbr|υ}}, {{angbr|ει}}, {{angbr|οι}}, and {{angbr|υι}} (though the last is rare).
* A language may spell some words with unpronounced letters that exist for historical or other reasons. For example, the spelling of the Thai word for "beer" [เบียร์] retains a letter for the final consonant "r" present in the English word it was borrowed from, but silences it.
* Pronunciation of individual words may change according to the presence of surrounding words in a sentence ([[sandhi]]).
* Different dialects of a language may use different phonemes for the same word.
* A language may use different sets of symbols or different rules for distinct sets of vocabulary items, such as the Japanese [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] syllabaries, or the various rules in English for spelling words from Latin and Greek, or the original [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] vocabulary.

National languages generally elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard. However, with an international language with wide variations in its dialects, such as [[English language|English]], it would be impossible to represent the language in all its variations with a single phonetic alphabet.

Some national languages like [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] ([[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]) and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes. Strictly speaking, these national languages lack a word corresponding to the verb "to spell" (meaning to split a word into its letters), the closest match being a verb meaning to split a word into its syllables. Similarly, the [[Italian language|Italian]] verb corresponding to 'spell (out)', ''compitare'', is unknown to many Italians because the act of spelling itself is rarely needed: Italian spelling is highly phonemic. In standard [[Spanish language|Spanish]], it is possible to tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling, but not vice versa; this is because certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way, but a given letter is consistently pronounced. [[French language|French]], with its [[silent letter]]s and its heavy use of [[nasal vowel]]s and [[elision]], may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation, but its rules on pronunciation, though complex, are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy.

At the other extreme are languages such as English, where the spelling of many words simply has to be memorized as they do not correspond to sounds in a consistent way. For English, this is partly because the [[Great Vowel Shift]] occurred after the orthography was established, and because English has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times, retaining their original spelling at varying levels. Even English has general, albeit complex, rules that predict pronunciation from spelling, and these rules are successful most of the time; rules to predict spelling from the pronunciation have a higher failure rate.

Sometimes, countries have the written language undergo a [[spelling reform]] to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language. These can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself, as when [[Turkey]] switched from the Arabic alphabet to a [[Turkish alphabet]] of Latin origin.

The sounds of speech of all languages of the world can be written by a rather-small universal phonetic-alphabet. A standard for this is the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].
