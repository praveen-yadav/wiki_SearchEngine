'''Clive Barker''' (born 5 October 1952) is an [[English people|English]] author, film director, video game designer and [[visual artist]] best known for his work in both [[fantasy]] and [[horror fiction]]. Barker came to prominence in the mid-1980s with a series of [[short stories]] which established him as a leading young horror writer. He has since written many novels and other works, and his fiction has been adapted into motion pictures, notably the ''[[Hellraiser (film series)|Hellraiser]]'' and ''[[Candyman (film)|Candyman]]'' series.

==Early life==

Clive Barker was born in [[Liverpool]], England, the son of Joan Ruby (née Revill), a painter and school welfare officer, and Leonard Barker, a personnel director for an industrial relations firm.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/98/Clive-Barker.html Clive Barker Biography]</ref><ref>[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800022056/bio Clive Barker Biography – Yahoo! Movies<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Educated at [[Dovedale Primary School]] and the former [[Quarry Bank High School]] now Calderstones [[Quarry Bank High School]], he studied English and Philosophy at [[University of Liverpool]].

As a 4-year-old child, Barker witnessed the death of [[Léo Valentin]], a French skydiver who plummeted to his death during a performance at an air show in Liverpool.  Barker would later allude to Valentin in many of his stories.<ref>{{cite book|title=Birdmen, Batmen, and Skyflyers: Wingsuits and the Pioneers Who Flew in Them, Fell in Them, and Perfected Them|first=Michael|last=Abrams|pages=131–132|publisher=[[Harmony Books]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4000-5491-6}}</ref>

==Personal life==

In 2003, Barker received The Davidson/Valentini Award at the [[15th GLAAD Media Awards]],<ref>[http://www.glaad.org/publications/resource_doc_detail.php?id=3545 The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Web Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Barker has been critical of organized religion throughout his career, but he has stated that the Bible influences his work and spirituality.<ref>[http://www.clivebarker.info/religion.html The Official Clive Barker Resource-Revelations-Barker on Spirituality<!-- Barker discusses Religion-->]</ref> In 2003, Barker remarked "I am, [a Christian]" during an episode of [[Real Time With Bill Maher]] when [[Ann Coulter]] implied he was not a Christian.<ref name="HBOMaher2003">{{Cite episode

Barker said in a December 2008 online interview (published March 2009) that he had polyps in his throat which were so severe that a doctor told him he was taking in ten percent of the air he was supposed to have been getting. He has had two surgeries to remove them and believes his resultant voice is an improvement over how it was prior to the surgeries. He said he did not have cancer and has given up cigars.<ref>''[http://www.strangehorizons.com/2009/20090316/snyder-a.shtml Art and the Artist: An Interview with Clive Barker]'' Strange Horizons interview</ref> On 27 August 2010, Barker underwent surgery yet again to remove new polyp growths from his throat.

In early February 2012 Barker fell into a [[coma]] after a visit to a dentist led to [[blood poisoning]]. Barker remained in a coma for eleven days but eventually came out of it. Fans were notified on his Twitter page about some of the experience and that Barker was recovering after the ordeal, but left with many strange visions.

===Relationships===

Barker has been openly gay<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=yGIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60&dq=clive+barker+homosexual#v=onepage&q=clive%20barker%20gay&f=false | title = Out | author1 = Publishing | first1 = Here | date = 2002-10}}</ref> since the early 1990s. His first longterm gay relationship with John Gregson<ref>[1]</ref> lasted from 1975 until 1986. It was during this period, with the love and financial support that John provided, that Clive was able to write the ''Books of Blood'' series and ''The Damnation Game''. He later spent fourteen years with David Armstrong; they separated in 2009.

==Writing career==

Barker is an author of contemporary [[horror fiction|horror]]/[[fantasy fiction|fantasy]], writing in the horror genre early in his career, mostly in the form of short stories (collected in ''[[Books of Blood]]'' 1 – 6), and the [[Faustian]] novel ''[[The Damnation Game (novel)|The Damnation Game]]'' (1985). Later he moved towards modern-day fantasy and [[urban fantasy]] with horror elements in ''[[Weaveworld]]'' (1987), ''[[The Great and Secret Show]]'' (1989), the world-spanning ''[[Imajica]]'' (1991) and ''[[Sacrament (novel)|Sacrament]]'' (1996), bringing in the deeper, richer concepts of reality, the nature of the mind and dreams, and the power of words and memories.

Barker's distinctive style is characterized by the notion of hidden fantastical worlds coexisting with our own, the role of sexuality in the [[supernatural]] and the construction of coherent, complex and detailed universes. Barker has referred to this style as "[[dark fantasy]]" or the "fantastique". His stories are notable for a deliberate blurring of the distinction between binary opposites such as hell and heaven, or pleasure and pain (the latter particularly so in ''The Hellbound Heart'').

When the ''Books of Blood'' were first published in the United States in paperback, [[Stephen King]] was quoted on the book covers: "I have seen the future of horror, his name is Clive Barker."<ref>http://www.clivebarker.info/newsstephenking.html</ref>  As influences on his writing, Barker lists [[Herman Melville]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[William Blake]], and [[Jean Cocteau]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clivebarker.info/influences.html| publisher= Clive Barker Revelations|title=Influences|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>

He is also the writer of the best-selling [[Abarat]] series, and plans on producing two more novels in the series.

Barker's basic philosophy and approach are revealed in his foreword to H.R. Giger's illustrated work, ''[[Necronomicon (H. R. Giger)|Necronomicon]]'' (1977).

==Film work==

Barker has a keen interest in movie production, although his films have received mixed receptions. He wrote the screenplays for ''[[Underworld (1985 film)|Underworld]]'' (aka ''Transmutations'' – 1985) and ''[[Rawhead Rex (film)|Rawhead Rex]]'' (1986), both directed by [[George Pavlou]].<ref>{{IMDb title|90233|Underworld}}</ref> Displeased by how his material was handled, he moved to directing with ''[[Hellraiser]]'' (1987), based on his novella ''[[The Hellbound Heart]]''. His early movies, the shorts ''The Forbidden'' and ''Salome'', are experimental art movies with surrealist elements, which have been re-released together to moderate critical acclaim. After his film ''[[Nightbreed]]'' (1990), which was widely considered to be a flop, Barker returned to write and direct ''[[Lord of Illusions]]'' (1995). A short story titled "The Forbidden", from Barker's ''Books of Blood'', provided the basis for the 1992 film ''[[Candyman (film)|Candyman]]'' and its two sequels (whereof he was also producer of the two first). Barker was an executive producer of the film ''[[Gods and Monsters]]'' (1998), which received major critical acclaim. He had been working on a series of movie adaptations of his ''The Abarat Quintet'' books under Disney's management, but has admitted that because of creative differences, this project will not go ahead.
In 2005, Barker created the film production company '''Midnight Picture Show''' together with horror film producer Jorge Saralegui, with the intent of producing two horror films per year.<ref>[http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/entertainment-news/2005/05/26/clive-barker-form-midnight-picture-show-16153 The Advocate, 25 May 2005: ''Clive Barker to form Midnight Picture Show''] Retrieved 2013-02-28</ref> Since then, the company has produced four films: ''[[The Plague (film)|The Plague]]'' (2006), ''[[The Midnight Meat Train]]'' (2008), ''[[Book of Blood]]'' (2009) and ''[[Dread (film)|Dread]]'' (2009).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/company/co0165062/ IMDb: ''Midnight Picture Show &#91;us&#93;''] Retrieved 2013-02-28</ref>

In October 2006, Barker announced through his official website that he will be writing the script to a forthcoming remake of the original ''Hellraiser'' movie.<ref>[http://www.clivebarker.info/intsrevel15.html The Official Clive Barker Resource – Revelations – Exclusive Interviews 15<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>''[http://www.fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=2994 Clive Barker remaking Hellraiser]'' – [[Fangoria (magazine)|Fangoria]] news, 20 October 2006</ref> He is also developing a film based on his ''[[Tortured Souls]]'' line of toys from [[McFarlane Toys]].

==Visual art and plays==

Barker is a prolific visual artist working in a variety of media, often illustrating his own books. His paintings have been seen first on the covers of his official fan club magazine, ''Dread'', published by [[Fantaco]] in the early '90s; on the covers of the collections of his plays, ''Incarnations'' (1995) and ''Forms of Heaven'' (1996); and on the second printing of the original UK publications of his ''Books of Blood'' series. Barker also provided the artwork for his young adult novel ''[[The Thief of Always]]'' and for the ''Abarat'' series. His artwork has been exhibited at Bert Green Fine Art in Los Angeles and Chicago, at the Bess Cutler Gallery in New York and La Luz De Jesus in Los Angeles. Many of his sketches and paintings can be found in the collection ''[[Clive Barker, Illustrator]]'', published in 1990 by Arcane/Eclipse Books, and in ''Visions of Heaven and Hell'', published in 2005 by Rizzoli Books. The most complete selection of Clive Barker's paintings and drawings are available to view in a gallery setting on the website.

He worked on the creative side of a horror video game, ''[[Clive Barker's Undying]]'', providing the voice for the character Ambrose. ''Undying'' was developed by [[DreamWorks Interactive]] and released in 2001. He also worked on ''[[Clive Barker's Jericho]]'' for [[Codemasters]], which was released in late 2007.

Barker created [[Halloween]] costume designs for Disguise Costumes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35356/dress-up-like-clive-barkers-nightmares|title=Dress Up Like Clive Barker's Nightmares}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18723|title=Clive Barkers Enters the 'Dark Bazaar' with JAKKS Pacific}}</ref>

==Comic books==

A longtime comics fan, Barker achieved his dream of publishing his own superhero books when [[Marvel Comics]] launched the [[Razorline]] imprint in 1993. Based on detailed premises, titles and lead characters he created specifically for this, the four interrelated titles&nbsp;— set outside the Marvel universe&nbsp;— were ''[[Ectokid]]'' (written first by [[James Dale Robinson|James Robinson]], then by future ''[[The Matrix|Matrix]]'' co-creator [[Wachowski brothers|Lana Wachowski]], with art by [[Steve Skroce]]), ''[[Hokum & Hex]]'' (written by [[Frank Lovece]], art by [[Anthony Williams (comics)|Anthony Williams]]), ''[[Hyperkind]]'' (written by Fred Burke, art by [[Paris Cullins]] and Bob Petrecca) and ''[[Saint Sinner (comics)|Saint Sinner]]'' (written by [[Elaine Lee]], art by [[Max Douglas]]). A 2002 Barker telefilm titled ''Saint Sinner'' bore no relation to the comic.

Barker horror adaptations and spinoffs in comics include the Marvel/[[Epic Comics]] series ''[[Hellraiser (comics)|Hellraiser]]'', ''[[Nightbreed (comics)|Nightbreed]]'', ''[[Pinhead (comics)|Pinhead]]'', ''The Harrowers'', ''Book of the Damned'', and ''Jihad''; [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse Books]]' series and [[graphic novels]] ''[[Tapping the Vein (comics)|Tapping The Vein]]'', ''Dread'', ''Son of Celluloid'', ''Revelations'' ''The Life of Death'', ''Rawhead Rex'' and ''The Yattering and Jack'', and [[Dark Horse Comics]]' ''Primal'', among others. Barker served as a consultant and wrote issues of the Hellraiser anthology comic book.

In 2005, IDW published a three-issue adaptation of Barker's children's fantasy novel ''[[The Thief of Always (comics)|The Thief of Always]]'', written and painted by Kris Oprisko and Gabriel Hernandez. IDW is publishing a 12 issue adaptation of Barker's novel ''[[The Great and Secret Show (comics)|The Great and Secret Show]]''.

In December 2007, Chris Ryall and Clive Barker announced an upcoming collaboration of an original comic book series, ''Torakator'', to be published by IDW.<ref>[http://www.clivebarker.info/newothersb.html The Official Clive Barker Resource – Revelations – Uncompleted Other Projects – B<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In October 2009, IDW published ''Seduth'' (Written by Clive Barker and Chris Monfette; art by [[Gabriel Rodriguez (artist)|Gabriel Rodriguez]]; colors by Jay Fotos; letters by Neil Uyetake; edits by [[Chris Ryall]]; and 3-D conversion by [[Ray Zone]]), the first time Barker has created a world specifically for the comic book medium in two decades. The work was released with three variant covers; cover a featuring art by [[Gabriel Rodriguez (artist)|Gabriel Rodriguez]] and cover b with art by Clive Barker and the third is a "retailer incentive signed edition cover" with art by Clive Barker.<ref>[http://www.idwpublishing.com/catalog/series/833 IDW Publishing]</ref>

In 2011, [[Boom studios|Boom! Studios]] began publishing an original Hellraiser comic book series. The comic book picks up 2 decades after the events of [[Hellbound: Hellraiser II]], and from there, builds its own mythology. The book has several credited writers: Chris Monfette, Anthony Diblasi, Mark Miller, and most recently [[Witch Doctor (comics)|Witch Doctor]] creator Brandon Seifert. The series is ongoing and has just celebrated its second anniversary in print.

In 2013, [[Boom studios|Boom! Studios]] announced the first original story by Barker to be published in comic book format: Next Testament. The story concerns a man, Julian Demond, who unearths the God of the Old Testament and discovers that he has bit off more than he can chew. The series is co written by Seraphim Films Vice President Mark MIller.
