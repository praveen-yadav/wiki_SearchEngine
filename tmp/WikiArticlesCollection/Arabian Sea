The '''Arabian Sea''' is a region of the [[Indian Ocean]] bounded on the north by [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]], on the south by northeastern [[Somalia]], on the east by [[India]], and on the west by the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Some of the ancient names of this body of water include ''Sindhu Sagar'' (meaning "Sea of [[Sindh]]" in Sanskrit)<ref>[http://www.kamat.com/indica/geography/arabian_sea.htm Geographica Indica - The Arabian Sea]</ref> and '''[[Erythraean Sea]]'''.

==Description==
[[File:Arabian Sea - October 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Arabian Sea from space]]
The Arabian Sea's surface area is about {{convert|3862000|km2|sqmi|-1|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/31653/Arabian-Sea Arabian Sea], Encyclopædia Britannica</ref> The maximum width of the Sea is approximately {{convert|2400|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}}, and its maximum depth is {{convert|4652|m|ft|0}}. The biggest river flowing into the Sea is the [[Indus River]].

The Arabian Sea has two important branches — the [[Gulf of Aden]] in the southwest, connecting with the [[Red Sea]] through the strait of [[Bab-el-Mandeb]]; and the [[Gulf of Oman]] to the northwest, connecting with the [[Persian Gulf]]. There are also the gulfs of [[Gulf of Cambay|Cambay]] and [[Gulf of Kutch|Kutch]] on the Indian coast.

[[File:PeriplusAncientMap.jpg|thumb|right|17th century map depicting the locations of the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'']]
The countries with coastlines on the Arabian Sea are [[Somalia]], [[Djibouti]], [[Yemen]], [[Oman]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and the [[Maldives]]. There are several large cities on the sea's coast including [[Karachi]], [[Gwadar]], [[Pasni City|Pasni]], [[Ormara]], [[Aden]], [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Mumbai]], [[Keti Bandar]], [[Salalah]] and [[Duqm]].

===Limits===
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Arabian Sea as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=7 February 2010}}</ref>

==Alternative names==

The Arabian Sea historically and geographically has been referred to by many different names by [[Arab]] travelers and European geographers, that include<ref>[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/periplus/periplus.html The Voyage around the Erythraean Sea]</ref> Sindhu Sagar,<ref>[http://www.kamat.com/indica/geography/arabian_sea.htm Geographica Indica - The Arabian Sea]</ref> [[Erythraean Sea]],<ref>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/8583367/The-Periplus-of-the-Erythraean-Sea The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea:Travel and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant of the First Century]</ref> Sindh Sea,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}, and Akhzar Sea.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Trade routes==

The Arabian Sea has been an important [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[trade route]] since the era of the ''coastal sailing vessels'' from possibly as early as the [[3rd millennium BCE]], certainly the late [[2nd millennium BCE]] through the later days known as the [[Age of Sail]]. By the time of [[Julius Caesar]], several well-established combined land-sea trade routes depended upon [[water transport]] through the Sea around the rough inland [[terrain feature]]s to its north.

[[File:Map of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Names, routes and locations of the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'']]

These routes usually began in the [[Far East]] or down river from [[Madhya Pradesh]] with [[transshipment]] via historic [[Bharuch]] (Bharakuccha), traversed past the inhospitable coast of today's [[Iran]] then split around [[Hadhramaut]] into two streams north into the [[Gulf of Aden]] and thence into the [[Levant]], or south into [[Alexandria]] via [[Red Sea]] ports such as [[Axum]]. Each major route involved transhipping to pack animal caravan, travel through desert country and risk of bandits and extortionate tolls by local potentiates.

This southern coastal route past the rough country in the southern [[Arabian peninsula]] ([[Yemen]] and [[Oman]] today) was significant, and the [[Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]]s built several shallow canals to service the trade, one more or less along the route of today's [[Suez canal]], and another from the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Nile River]], both shallow works that were swallowed up by huge [[sand storm]]s in antiquity. Later the [[kingdom of Axum]] arose in [[Ethiopia]] to rule a mercantile empire rooted in the trade with Europe via Alexandria.

===Major ports===
[[File:Karachi port and harbour aerial.jpg|thumb|The [[Port of Karachi]] in Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, with some of the city's residential areas visible. The port is one of the busiest in the Arabian Sea]]

The [[Port of Karachi]] (Urdu: بندر گاہ كراچى, ''{{transl|ur|ALA-LC|Bandargāh-i Karācī}}'') is [[Pakistan]]'s largest and busiest seaport, handling about 60% of the nation's cargo (25 million tons per annum). It is located between the Karachi towns of [[Kiamari]] and [[Saddar]], close to the main business district and several industrial areas. The geographic position of the port places it in close proximity to major shipping routes such as the [[Strait of Hormuz]]. The history of the port is intertwined with that of the city of Karachi. Several ancient ports have been attributed in the area including "Krokola", "Morontobara" (Woman's Harbour) (mentioned by [[Nearchus]]), [[Barbarikon]] (the [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]], and [[Debal]] (a city captured by the Muslim general [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] in 712 CE). There is a reference to the early existence of the port of Karachi in the "[[Umdah]]", by the Arab navigator [[Sulaiman al Mahri]] (AD 1511), who mentions "[[Ras al Karazi]]" and "[[Ras Karashi]]" while describing a route along the coast from [[Pasni City|Pasni]] to Ras Karashi.

Karachi is also mentioned in the sixteenth century [[Turkish language|Turkish]] treatise [[Mir'ât ül Memâlik]] (Mirror of Countries, 1557) by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] captain [[Seydi Ali Reis]], which is a compilation of sailing directions from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] island of [[Diu Island|Diu]] to [[Strait of Hormuz|Hormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]]. It warns sailors about whirlpools and advises them to seek safety in "[[Kaurashi]]" harbour if they found themselves drifting dangerously.

The gate facing the sea was called "Kharadar" (salt gate), and the gate facing the [[Lyari River]] was called "[[Mithadar]]" (sweet gate). The modern neighbourhoods around the location of the gates are called [[Mithadar]] and Kharadar. Surrounded by mangrove swamps to the east, the sea to the southwest, and the [[Lyari River]] to the north, the town was well defended and engaged in a profitable trade with Muscat and Bahrain.

[[File:Gwadar Port.jpg|framepx200|thumb|left|[[Gwadar port|Gwadar Port]], situated at [[Gwadar]] in [[Balochistan, Pakistan]]. Bird's eye view of [[Gwadar port]]]]

The [[Gwadar Port]] is a warm-water, deep-sea port situated at [[Gwadar]] in [[Balochistan, Pakistan]] at the apex of the Arabian Sea and at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, about 460&nbsp;km west of [[Karachi]] and approximately 75&nbsp;km (47&nbsp;mi) east of Pakistan's border with [[Iran]]. The port is located on the eastern bay of a natural hammerhead-shaped peninsula jutting out into the Arabian Sea from the coastline.

[[Port of Salalah]] in [[Salalah]], [[Oman]] is also a major port in the area. From a modest start in 1997, the Omani container transhipment port has achieved consistent growth. For a growing number of ships’ crew, the port of Salalah is a welcome sight after an unpleasant and often prolonged encounter with pirates.
The [[Port of Salalah]] is a key container transhipment hub on the Arabian Sea and is often used as the first port of call for vessels whose crew have just been released from the clutches of [[Piracy in Somalia|Somali pirates]] following ransom payments for withheld vessels and crew.
The port also plays host as a supply base for the visiting warships that provide protective escorts for merchant shipping in the sea lanes.
From that dual role has emerged another, one as an intelligence network — both military and civilian — to exchange information on possible pirate sightings and near misses.  Also, the International Task Force often uses the port as a base. There is a significant number of warships of all nations coming in and out of the port, which makes it a very safe bubble. The port handled just under 3.5m teu{{clarify|date=December 2012}} in 2009<ref>[http://www.portofsalalah.com/port_news_item.aspx?id=16655 Salalah’s versatility beats the slump], Port of Salalah</ref>

Major [[India]]n ports in the Arabian Sea are [[Kandla Port]], [[Nava Sheva]], [[Kochi]], [[Mumbai Port]] and  [[Mormugão]].<ref>[http://shipping.gov.in/writereaddata/l892s/7yearsTRAFFIC-42175832.pdf TRAFFIC HANDLED AT MAJOR PORTS (LAST 7 YEARS)]</ref><ref>[http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/PDFs/WORLD%20PORT%20RANKINGS%202009.pdf WORLD PORT RANKINGS - 2009]</ref>

==Islands==
There are several islands in the Arabian Sea, with the largest being [[Socotra]] ([[Yemen]]), [[Masirah]] ([[Oman]]), [[Astola Island]] ([[Pakistan]]) and [[Andrott]] ([[India]]).

[[File:Astola Island.jpg|thumb|left|[[Astola Island|Astola]] is a Pakistani island just off the coast of [[Balochistan, Pakistan]]]]
'''Astola Island''', also known as ''Jezira Haft Talar'' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|جزیرہ ہفت تلار}}}}) or 'Island of the Seven Hills', is a small, uninhabited island in the northern tip of the Arabian Sea in [[Pakistan]]'s territorial waters. It is a popular [[eco-tourism]] destination in the region.Overnight tourists camp on the island and bring their own provisions. Camping, fishing and scuba-diving expeditions are popular. It is also a site for observing turtle breeding. Endangered animals such as the [[Green Sea Turtle|Green turtle]] (''Chelonia mydas'') and the [[Hawksbill turtle]] (''Eretmochelys imbracata'') nest on the beach at the foot of the cliffs. The island is also a very important area for endemic reptiles such as the Astola [[Viperidae|Viper]] (''Echis carinatus astolae'').

[[File:Socotra satview.jpg|thumb|right|Landsat view over [[Socotra]], a Yemeni island.]]
'''Socotra''' ({{lang-ar|سُقُطْرَى}} ''{{transl|ar|Suquṭra}}''), also spelled '''Soqotra''', is the largest island, being part of a small [[archipelago]] of four islands. It lies some {{convert|240|km|mi}} east of the [[Horn of Africa]] and {{convert|380|km|mi}} south of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The island is very isolated and through the process of [[speciation]], a third of its plant life is found nowhere else on the planet. It has been described as the most alien-looking place on Earth.

'''Masirah''' ({{lang-ar|مصيرة}}) is an island off the East coast of [[Oman]].  The main industries here are [[fishing]] and traditional textile manufacturing. Formerly, traditional ship building was important. The rugged terrain of the island and surrounding rough coastline has led to the appearance of many wrecked [[dhow]]s on the beaches of the island, most of them well preserved by the salt water and intense heat.  The ocean bottom environment surrounding Masirah is hostile as the majority of the area is covered in either sand or hard rock. Despite the poor quality ocean bottom, the area is very productive with marine fisheries, and any hard objects (barrels, engines) are immediately colonized by local fauna.
