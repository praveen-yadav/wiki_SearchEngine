An '''audio file format''' is a [[file format]] for storing [[digital audio]] data on a [[computer]] system. This data can be stored uncompressed, or [[audio compression (data)|compressed]] to reduce the file size. It can be a raw [[bitstream]], but it is usually a [[container format (digital)|container format]] or an audio data format with defined storage layer.

==Format types==
It is important to distinguish between a [[file format]] and an [[audio codec]]. A codec performs the encoding and decoding of the raw audio data while the data itself is stored in a file with a specific audio file format. Although most audio file formats support only one type of audio data (created with an [[audio codec|audio coder]]), a multimedia container format (as [[Matroska]] or [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]]) may support multiple types of audio and video data.

There are three major groups of audio file formats:

* Uncompressed audio formats, such as [[WAV]], [[AIFF]], [[Au file format|AU]] or [[raw audio format|raw]] header-less [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]];
* Formats with [[lossless data compression|lossless]] compression, such as [[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]], [[Monkey's Audio]] ([[filename extension]] APE), [[WavPack]] ([[filename extension]] WV), [[TTA (codec)|TTA]], [[ATRAC]] Advanced Lossless, [[Apple Lossless]] ([[filename extension]] m4a), [[MPEG-4 SLS]], [[MPEG-4 ALS]], [[MPEG-4 DST]], [[Windows_Media_Audio#Windows_Media_Audio_Lossless|Windows Media Audio Lossless (WMA Lossless)]], and [[Shorten (file format)|Shorten]] (SHN).
* Formats with [[lossy data compression|lossy]] compression, such as [[MP3]], [[Vorbis]], [[Musepack]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[ATRAC]] and [[Windows_Media_Audio#WIndows_Media_Audio_Lossy|Windows Media Audio Lossy (WMA lossy)]].

===Uncompressed audio format===
{{See also|Uncompressed video}}
There is one major uncompressed audio format, [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]], which is usually stored in a .wav file on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] or in a .aiff file on [[Mac OS]]. The AIFF format is based on the [[Interchange File Format]] (IFF). The WAV format is based on the [[RIFF (File format)|Resource Interchange File Format]] (RIFF), which is similar to IFF. WAV and AIFF are flexible file formats designed to store more or less any combination of sampling rates or bitrates. This makes them suitable file formats for storing and archiving an original recording.

[[Broadcast Wave Format|BWF]] (Broadcast Wave Format) is a standard audio format created by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] as a successor to WAV. BWF allows [[metadata]] to be stored in the file. See ''[[Broadcast Wave Format|European Broadcasting Union: Specification of the Broadcast Wave Format]]'' (EBU Technical document 3285, July 1997). This is the primary recording format used in many professional audio workstations in the television and film industry. BWF files include a standardized [[timestamp]] reference which allows for easy synchronization with a separate picture element. Stand-alone, file based, multi-track recorders from Sound Devices,<ref>[http://www.sounddevices.com Sound Devices, LLC | Professional, Portable Audio Products<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Zaxcom,<ref>[http://www.zaxcom.com Zaxcom<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> HHB Communications Ltd,<ref>[http://www.hhb.co.uk/ HHB | Essential Tools for Audio Professionals<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Fostex]], Nagra, Aaton,<ref>http://aaton.com</ref> and [[TASCAM]] all use BWF as their preferred format.

Uncompressed audio can also be stored in [[raw audio format]].

===Lossless compressed audio format===
A lossless compressed format stores data in less space by eliminating unnecessary data.

Uncompressed audio formats encode both sound and silence with the same number of bits per unit of time. Encoding an uncompressed minute of absolute silence produces a file of the same size as encoding an uncompressed minute of music. In a lossless compressed format, however, the music would occupy a smaller portion of the file and the silence would take up almost no space at all.

Lossless compression formats enable the original uncompressed data to be recreated exactly. They include the common<ref>[http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=60145 2008 ripping/encoding general poll - Hydrogenaudio Forums<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Verify credibility|date=March 2011}}</ref> [[FLAC]], [[WavPack]], [[Monkey's Audio]], [[Apple Lossless|ALAC]] (Apple Lossless). They provide a compression ratio of about 2:1 (i.e. their files take up half the space of the originals). Development in lossless compression formats aims to reduce processing time while maintaining a good compression ratio.

===Lossy compressed audio format===
Lossy compression enables even greater reductions in file size by removing some of the data. Lossy compression typically achieves far greater compression than lossless compression by simplifying the complexities of the data.<ref name="Data">[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=4&hid=105&sid=6446f656-6968-4b11-9570-faba39949122%40sessionmgr114&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=tfh&AN=28833125 Lossy Data]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}<!--This is not [[WP:ROT]]. The link was dead when inserted.--></ref> This of course results in a reduction in audio quality, but a variety of techniques are used, mainly by exploiting [[psychoacoustics]], to remove the data that has least effect on perceived quality. The loss in data (and thus quality) may not always be easily perceived through casual listening. The popular [[MP3|MP3 format]] is probably the best-known example, but the [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC format]] found on the iTunes Music Store is also common. Most formats offer a range of degrees of compression, generally measured in [[bit rate]]. The lower the rate, the smaller the file and the more significant the quality loss.
