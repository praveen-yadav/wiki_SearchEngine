'''Active Directory''' ('''AD''') is a [[directory service]] implemented by [[Microsoft]] for [[Windows domain]] networks. It is included in most [[Windows Server]] operating systems.

An AD [[domain controller]] [[authentication|authenticates]] and [[authorization|authorizes]] all users and computers in a Windows domain type network—assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software. For example, when a user [[login|logs into]] a computer that is part of a Windows domain, Active Directory checks the submitted password and determines whether the user is a [[system administrator]] or normal user.<ref name="adw2k3">{{Cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc780036(WS.10).aspx#w2k3tr_ad_over_qbjd|title=Active Directory on a Windows Server 2003 Network|date=13 March 2003|work=Active Directory Collection|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=25 December 2010}}</ref>

Active Directory makes use of [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]] (LDAP) versions 2 and 3, Microsoft's version of [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]], and [[Domain Name System|DNS]].

==History==
Active Directory, like many information-technology efforts, originated out of a democratization of design using [[Request for Comments]] or RFCs. The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), which oversees the RFC process, has accepted numerous RFCs initiated by widespread participants. Active Directory incorporates decades of communication technologies into the overarching Active Directory concept then makes improvements upon them.

For example, LDAP, a long-standing directory technology, underpins Active Directory. Also X.500 directories and the Organizational Unit preceded the Active Directory concept that makes use of those methods. The Active Directory concept began to emerge even before the founding of Microsoft in April 1975, with RFCs as early as 1971. RFCs contributing to Active Directory include RFC 1823 (on the LDAP API, August 1995),<ref>

 |accessdate   = 2013-11-26
}}
</ref>
RFC 2307, RFC 3062, and RFC 4533{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}.

Microsoft previewed Active Directory in 1999, released it first with [[Windows 2000]] Server edition, and revised it to extend functionality and improve administration in [[Windows Server 2003]]. Additional improvements came with [[Windows Server 2003 R2]], [[Windows Server 2008#Active Directory roles|Windows Server 2008]], and [[Windows Server 2008 R2#Active Directory roles|Windows Server 2008 R2]]. With the release of the last, Microsoft renamed the domain controller role as ''Active Directory Domain Services'' (AD DS). It is also included in Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2.

==Structure==

===Objects===
An Active Directory structure is an arrangement of information about [[Object (computing)|objects]]. The objects fall into two broad categories: resources (e.g., printers) and [[security principal]]s (user or computer accounts and groups). Security principals are assigned unique [[security identifier]]s (SIDs).

Each object represents a single entity—whether a user, a computer, a printer, or a group—and its attributes. Certain objects can contain other objects. An object is uniquely identified by its name and has a set of attributes—the characteristics and information that the object represents— defined by a [[database schema|schema]], which also determines the kinds of objects that can be stored in Active Directory.

The [[schema object]] lets administrators extend or modify the schema when necessary. However, because each schema object is integral to the definition of Active Directory objects, deactivating or changing these objects can fundamentally change or disrupt a deployment. Schema changes automatically propagate throughout the system. Once created, an object can only be deactivated—not deleted. Changing the schema usually requires planning.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Windows Server 2003: Active Directory Infrastructure|year=2003|publisher=Microsoft Press|pages=1–8–1–9|isbn=0-7356-1438-5}}</ref>

====Site====
A '''Site''' object in Active Directory represents a geographic location that hosts networks.<ref name="technet1">{{cite web

    }} ''"A site is a set of well-connected subnets."''
</ref>

===Forests, trees, and domains===
The Active Directory framework that holds the objects can be viewed at a number of levels. The forest, tree, and domain are the logical divisions in an Active Directory network.

Within a deployment, objects are grouped into domains. The objects for a single domain are stored in a single database (which can be replicated). Domains are identified by their [[Domain Name System|DNS]] name structure, the [[namespace]].

A domain is defined as a logical group of network objects (computers, users, devices) that share the same active directory database.

A tree is a collection of one or more domains and domain trees in a contiguous namespace, linked in a transitive trust hierarchy.

At the top of the structure is the ''forest.'' A forest is a collection of trees that share a common global catalog, directory schema, logical structure, and directory configuration. The forest represents the security boundary within which users, computers, groups, and other objects are accessible.

====Organizational units====
The objects held within a domain can be grouped into [[Organizational Unit]]s (OUs).<ref>{{Cite web | title = Organizational Units | url = http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc978003.aspx | publisher = Microsoft Corporation | quote = An organizational unit in '''Active Directory''' is analogous to a directory in the file system | year = 2011 }}</ref> OUs can provide hierarchy to a domain, ease its administration, and can resemble the organization's structure in managerial or geographical terms. OUs can contain other OUs—domains are containers in this sense. Microsoft recommends using OUs rather than domains for structure and to simplify the implementation of policies and administration. The OU is the recommended level at which to apply [[group policies]], which are Active Directory objects formally named Group Policy Objects (GPOs), although policies can also be applied to domains or sites (see below). The OU is the level at which administrative powers are commonly delegated, but delegation can be performed on individual objects or attributes as well.

Organizational Units are an arrangement for the administrator and do not function as containers; the underlying domain is the true container. It is not possible, for example, to create user accounts with an identical username (sAMAccountName) in separate OUs, such as "fred.staff-ou.domain" and "fred.student-ou.domain", where "staff-ou" and "student-ou" are the OUs. This is so because sAMAccountName, a user object attribute, must be unique within the domain.
<ref>{{cite web
        | title      = sAMAccountName is always unique in a Windows domain… or is it?
        | url        = http://blog.joeware.net/2012/01/04/2357/

        | accessdate = 18 September 2013
        | quote       = examples of how multiple AD objects can be created with the same sAMAccountName}}
</ref> However, two users in different OUs can have the same Common Name (CN), the name under which they are stored in the directory itself.

In general the reason for this lack of allowance for duplicate names through hierarchical directory placement, is that Microsoft primarily relies on the principles of [[NetBIOS]], which is a flat-file method of network object management that for Microsoft software, goes all the way back to [[Windows NT 3.1]] and [[MS-DOS]] [[LAN Manager]]. Allowing for duplication of object names in the directory, or completely removing the use of NetBIOS names, would prevent backward compatibility with legacy software and equipment.

As the number of users in a domain increases, conventions such as "first initial, middle initial, last name" ([[Name order|Western order]]) or the reverse (Eastern order) fail for common [[family names]] like ''Li (李)'', ''Smith'' or ''Garcia''. Workarounds include adding a digit to the end of the username. Alternatives include creating a separate ID system of unique employee/student id numbers to use as account names in place of actual user's names, and allowing users to nominate their preferred word sequence within an [[acceptable use policy]].

Because duplicate usernames cannot exist within a domain, account name generation poses a significant challenge for large organizations that cannot be easily subdivided into separate domains, such as students in a public school system or university who must be able to use any computer across the network.

=====Shadow groups=====
[[File:Active directory - OUs can not be given rights to objects.png|thumb|right|In Active Directory, organizational units cannot be assigned as owners or trustees. Only groups are selectable, and members of OUs cannot be collectively assigned rights to directory objects.]]
In Microsoft's Active Directory, OUs do not confer access permissions, and objects placed within OUs are not automatically assigned access privileges based on their containing OU. This is a design limitation specific to Active Directory. Other competing directories such as Novell [[Novell eDirectory|NDS]] are able to assign access privileges through object placement within an OU.

Active Directory requires a separate step for an administrator to assign an object in an OU as a member of a group also within that OU. Relying on OU location alone to determine access permissions is unreliable, because the object may not have been assigned to the group object for that OU.

A common workaround for an Active Directory administrator is to write a custom [[PowerShell]] or [[Visual Basic]] script to automatically create and maintain a ''user group'' for each OU in their directory. The scripts are run periodically to update the group to match the OU's account membership, but are unable to instantly update the security groups anytime the directory changes, as occurs in competing directories where security is directly implemented into the directory itself. Such groups are known as ''Shadow Groups''. Once created, these shadow groups are selectable in place of the OU in the administrative tools.

Microsoft refers to shadow groups in the Server 2008 Reference documentation, but does not explain how to create them. There are no built-in server methods or console snap-ins for managing shadow groups.<ref>Microsoft Server 2008 Reference, discussing shadow groups used for fine-grained password policies: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc770394%28WS.10%29.aspx</ref>

The division of an organization's information infrastructure into a hierarchy of one or more domains and top-level OUs is a key decision. Common models are by business unit, by geographical location, by IT Service, or by object type and hybrids of these. OUs should be structured primarily to facilitate administrative delegation, and secondarily, to facilitate group policy application. Although OUs form an administrative boundary, the only true security boundary is the forest itself and an administrator of any domain in the forest must be trusted across all domains in the forest.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Specifying Security and Administrative Boundaries | url = http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755979(WS.10).aspx | publisher = Microsoft Corporation | quote = However, service administrators have abilities that cross domain boundaries. For this reason, the forest is the ultimate security boundary, not the domain. | date = 23 January 2005}}</ref>

==Physical matters==
''Sites'' are physical (rather than logical) groupings defined by one or more [[Internet Protocol|IP]] subnets.<ref>
   {{cite web
        | title     = Sites overview
        | url       = http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc782048(WS.10).aspx

        | date      = 21 January 2005
    }}
</ref> AD also holds the definitions of connections, distinguishing low-speed (e.g., [[Wide area network|WAN]], [[Virtual private network|VPN]]) from high-speed (e.g., [[local area network|LAN]]) links. Site definitions are independent of the domain and OU structure and are common across the forest. Sites are used to control network traffic generated by replication and also to refer clients to the nearest [[domain controller]]s (DCs). [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange Server 2007]] uses the site topology for mail routing. Policies can also be defined at the site level.

Physically, the Active Directory information is held on one or more peer [[domain controller]]s, replacing the [[Windows NT|NT]] [[Primary Domain Controller|PDC]]/[[Backup Domain Controller|BDC]] model. Each DC has a copy of the Active Directory. Servers joined to Active Directory that are not domain controllers are called Member Servers.<ref>{{cite web
        | title     = Planning for domain controllers and member servers

    }}
</ref>

The Active Directory database is organized in ''partitions'', each holding specific object types and following a specific replication pattern. AD synchronizes changes using ''[[multi-master replication]]''.<ref>{{cite web

        | title     = Directory data store

The 'Configuration' partition contains information on the physical structure and configuration of the forest (such as the site topology). Both replicate to all domain controllers in the Forest.  The 'Domain' partition holds all objects created in that domain and replicates only to Domain Controllers within its domain. So, for example, a user created in Domain X would be listed only in Domain X's domain controllers.
A subset of objects in the domain partition replicate to domain controllers that are configured as global catalogs. Global catalog (GC) servers provide a global listing of all objects in the Forest.<ref>{{cite web

However, to minimize replication traffic and keep the GC's database small, only selected attributes of each object are replicated. This is called the partial attribute set (PAS).

        | title     = Attributes Included in the Global Catalog

Earlier versions of Windows used [[NetBIOS]] to communicate. Active Directory is fully integrated with DNS and requires [[TCPIP|TCP/IP]]—DNS. To be fully functional, the DNS server must support [[SRV record|SRV resource records]], also known as service records.

==Replication==
Active Directory replication by default is 'pull' rather than 'push', meaning that replicas pull changes from the server where the change was effected.<ref>{{cite web
        | title     = What Is the Active Directory Replication Model?
        | url       = http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc737314(WS.10).aspx
        | publisher = Microsoft Corporation
        | date      = 28 March 2003
        | quote     = Domain controllers request (pull) changes rather than send (push) changes that might not be needed.
    }}
</ref> The ''Knowledge Consistency Checker'' (KCC) creates a replication topology of ''site links'' using the defined ''sites'' to manage traffic. Intrasite replication is frequent and automatic as a result of change notification, which triggers peers to begin a pull replication cycle. Intersite replication intervals are typically less frequent and do not use change notification by default, although this is configurable and can be made identical to intrasite replication.

Each link can have a 'cost' (e.g., [[Digital Signal 3|DS3]], [[Digital Signal 1|T1]], [[ISDN]] etc.) and the KCC alters the site link topology accordingly. Replication may occur transitively through several site links on same-protocol ''site link bridges'', if the cost is low, although KCC automatically costs a direct site-to-site link lower than transitive connections. Site-to-site replication can be configured to occur between a ''bridgehead server'' in each site, which then replicates the changes to other DCs within the site. Replication for Active Directory zones is automatically configured when DNS is activated in the domain based by site.

Replication of Active Directory uses [[Remote Procedure Call]]s (RPC) over IP (RPC/IP). Between Sites [[SMTP]] can be used for replication, but only for changes in the Schema, Configuration, or Partial Attribute Set (Global Catalog) NCs. SMTP cannot be used for replicating the default Domain partition.<ref>{{cite web

==Database==
'''The Active Directory''' [[database]], the ''directory store'', in Windows 2000 Server uses the [[Microsoft JET Blue|JET Blue]]-based [[Extensible Storage Engine]] (ESE98) and is limited to 16 terabytes and 2 billion objects (but only 1 billion security principals) in each domain controller's database. Microsoft has created NTDS databases with more than 2 billion objects.<ref name="blogs.technet.com">

</ref> (NT4's [[Security Account Manager]] could support no more than 40,000 objects). Called NTDS.DIT, it has two main tables: the ''data table'' and the ''link table''.  Windows Server 2003 added a third main table for [[security descriptor]] single instancing.<ref name="blogs.technet.com"/>

Programs may access the features of Active Directory via the [[Component Object Model|COM interfaces]] provided by ''Active Directory Service Interfaces''.<ref>

==Single server operations==
'''[[FSMO|Flexible Single Master Operations Roles]]''' ('''FSMO''', sometimes pronounced "fizz-mo") operations are also known as operations master roles. Although domain controllers allow simultaneous updates in multiple places, certain operations are supported only on a single server. These operations are performed using the roles listed below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!width="140px"| Role name
!width="140px"| Scope
! Description
|-
| Schema Master
| 1 per forest
| Schema modifications
|-
| Domain Naming Master
| 1 per forest
| Addition and removal of domains if present in root domain
|-
| PDC Emulator
| 1 per domain
| Provides backwards compatibility for NT4 clients for PDC operations (like password changes).  The PDC runs domain specific processes such as the Security Descriptor Propagator (SDP), and is the master time server within the domain. It also handles external trusts, the DFS consistency check, holds current passwords and manages all GPOs as default server.
|-
| RID Master
| 1 per domain
| Allocates pools of unique identifiers to domain controllers for use when creating objects
|-
| Infrastructure Master
| 1 per domain/partition
| Synchronizes cross-domain group membership changes.  The infrastructure master should not be run on a global catalog server (GCS) unless all DCs are also GCs, or the environment consists of a single domain.
|}

==Trusting==
To allow users in one domain to access resources in another, Active Directory uses trusts.<ref>{{cite web
        | title     = Domain and Forest Trusts Technical Reference
        | url       = http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc738955(WS.10).aspx

        | quote     = Trusts enable [...] authentication and [...] sharing resources across domains or forests}}</ref>

Trusts inside a forest are automatically created when domains are created. The forest sets the default boundaries of trust, and implicit, transitive trust is automatic for all domains within a forest.

===Terminology===
;One-way trust
:One domain allows access to users on another domain, but the other domain does not allow access to users on the first domain.
;Two-way trust
:Two domains allow access to users on both domains.
;Trusting domain
:The domain that allows access to users from a trusted domain.
;Trusted domain
:The domain that is trusted; whose users have access to the trusting domain.
;Transitive trust
:A trust that can extend beyond two domains to other trusted domains in the forest.
;Intransitive trust
:A one way trust that does not extend beyond two domains.
;Explicit trust
:A trust that an admin creates. It is not transitive and is one way only.
;Cross-link trust
:An explicit trust between domains in different trees or in the same tree when a descendant/ancestor (child/parent) relationship does not exist between the two domains.
;Shortcut
:Joins two domains in different trees, transitive, one- or two-way.
;Forest trust
:Applies to the entire forest. Transitive, one- or two-way.
;Realm
:Can be transitive or nontransitive (intransitive), one- or two-way.
;External
:Connect to other forests or non-AD domains. Nontransitive, one- or two-way.<ref>{{cite web

==== Forest trusts ====
Windows Server 2003 introduced the ''forest root trust''. This trust can be used to connect Windows Server 2003 forests if they are operating at the 2003 forest functional level. Authentication across this type of trust is [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]]-based (as opposed to [[NTLM]]).

Forest trusts are transitive for all the domains '''within''' the trusted forests.  However, forest trusts are ''not'' transitive '''between''' forests.

'''Example''':  Suppose that a two-way transitive forest trust exists between the forest root domains in Forest A and Forest B, and another two-way transitive forest trust exists between the forest root domains in Forest B and Forest C. Such a configuration lets users in Forest B access resources in any domain in either Forest A or Forest C, and users in Forest A or C can access resources in any domain in Forest B. However, it does ''not'' let users in Forest A access resources in Forest C, or vice versa. To let users in Forest A and Forest C share resources, a two-way transitive trust must exist between both forests.

==Unix integration==
Varying levels of interoperability with Active Directory can be achieved on most Unix-like operating systems through standards-compliant LDAP clients, but these systems usually do not interpret  many attributes associated with Windows components, such as [[Group Policy]] and support for one-way trusts.

The schema additions shipped with [[Windows Server 2003 R2]] include attributes that map closely enough to RFC 2307 to be generally usable. The reference implementation of RFC 2307, nss_ldap and pam_ldap provided by PADL.com, support these attributes directly. The default schema for group membership complies with RFC 2307bis (proposed).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.padl.com/~lukeh/rfc2307bis.txt |title=RFC 2307bis |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref> Windows Server 2003 R2 includes a [[Microsoft Management Console]] snap-in that creates and edits the attributes.

An alternate option is to use another directory service such as [[389 Directory Server]] (formerly Fedora Directory Server, FDS), ViewDS Identity Solutions - ViewDS v7.2 [[XML Enabled Directory]]  or Sun Microsystems [[Sun Java System Directory Server]],  with the latter two both being able to perform two-way synchronization with AD and thus provide a "deflected" integration, as Unix and Linux clients authenticate to this while Windows Clients authenticate to AD. Another option is to use [[OpenLDAP]] with its ''translucent'' overlay, which can extend entries in any remote LDAP server with additional attributes stored in a local database. Clients pointed at the local database see entries containing both the remote and local attributes, while the remote database remains completely untouched.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Administration (querying, modifying, and monitoring) of Active Directory can be achieved via many scripting languages, including PowerShell, VBScript, JScript/JavaScript, Perl, Python, and Ruby.<ref>{{cite web|title=Active Directory Administration with Windows PowerShell|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd378937%28WS.10%29.aspx|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Using Scripts to Search Active Directory|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee692830.aspx|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ITAdminTools Perl Scripts Repository|url=http://www.itadmintools.com/2011/09/itadmintools-perl-script-repository.html|publisher=ITAdminTools.com|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Win32::OLE|url=https://metacpan.org/module/Win32::OLE|publisher=Perl Open-Source Community|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> Using free AD administration tools <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/awards/teched-2012-winners-announced-143449|title= Free Active Directory Admin Tools from SolarWinds |date=January 2012 |publisher= MarketWire}}</ref> can help to simplify AD management tasks.
