A '''disaccharide''' or ''biose''<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/biose Biose on www.merriam-webster.org]</ref> is the [[carbohydrate]] formed when two [[monosaccharide]]s undergo a condensation reaction which involves the elimination of a small molecule, such as water, from the functional groups only. Like monosaccharides, disaccharides form an aqueous solution when dissolved in water. Three common examples are [[sucrose]], [[lactose]],<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=disaccharides|file=D01776}}</ref> and [[maltose]].

'Disaccharide' is one of the four chemical groupings of carbohydrates  ([[monosaccharide]], disaccharide, [[oligosaccharide]], and [[polysaccharide]]).

==Classification==
There are two different types of disaccharides: reducing disaccharides, in which one monosaccharide, the reducing sugar, still has a free [[hemiacetal]] unit; and non-reducing disaccharides, in which the components bond through an acetal linkage between their anomeric centers and neither monosaccharide has a free hemiacetal unit.  [[Cellobiose]] and [[maltose]] are examples of reducing disaccharides. [[Sucrose]] and [[trehalose]] are examples of non-reducing disaccharides.

==Formation==
Disaccharides are formed when two [[monosaccharide]]s are joined together and a molecule of water is removed, a process known as [[dehydration reaction]]. For example; milk sugar ([[lactose]]) is made from [[glucose]] and [[galactose]] whereas the sugar from sugar cane and sugar beets ([[sucrose]]) is made from [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. [[Maltose]], another notable disaccharide, is made up of two glucose molecules.<ref>{{cite book|last=Whitney|first=Ellie|title=Understanding Nutrition|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=California|isbn=0-538-73465-5|pages=100|edition=Twelfth|coauthors=Sharon Rady Rolfes|editor=Peggy Williams}}</ref> 
The two [[monosaccharide]]s are bonded via a [[dehydration reaction]] (also called a [[condensation reaction]] or dehydration synthesis) that leads to the loss of a molecule of water and formation of a [[glycosidic bond]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Properties==
The glycosidic bond can be formed between any hydroxyl group on the component monosaccharide.  So, even if both component [[sugar]]s are the same (e.g., [[glucose]]), different bond combinations (regiochemistry) and stereochemistry (''alpha-'' or ''beta-'') result in disaccharides  that are [[diastereoisomer]]s with different chemical and physical properties.

Depending on the [[monosaccharide]] constituents, disaccharides are sometimes crystalline, sometimes water-soluble, and sometimes sweet-tasting and sticky-feeling.

Maltose and cellobiose are [[hydrolysis]] products of the [[polysaccharide]]s [[starch]] and [[cellulose]], respectively.
