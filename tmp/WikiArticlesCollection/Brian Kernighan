'''Brian Wilson Kernighan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɜr|n|ɨ|h|æ|n}}; born January 1, 1942)<ref name="NYT 2002"/> is a Canadian [[computer scientist]] who worked at [[Bell Labs]] alongside [[Unix]] creators [[Ken Thompson (programmer)|Ken Thompson]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]] and contributed to the development of [[Unix]]. He is also coauthor of the [[AWK (programming language)|AWK]] and [[AMPL]] [[programming language]]s. The 'K' of [[The C Programming Language (book)|K&R C]] and the 'K' in [[AWK (programming language)|AWK]] both stand for 'Kernighan'. Brian Kernighan is currently a Professor at the Computer Science Department of [[Princeton University]], where he is also the Undergraduate Department Representative.  

Kernighan's name became widely known through co-authorship of the first book on the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] with [[Dennis Ritchie]]. Kernighan affirmed that he had no part in the design of the C language ("it's entirely Dennis Ritchie's work").<ref name="LJ 2003">{{cite web |title=Interview with Brian Kernighan |url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7035 |publisher =[[Linux Journal]] |first=Aleksey |last=Dolya |date=29 July 2003}}</ref> He authored many [[Unix]] programs, including [[ditroff]], and [[cron]] for [[Version 7 Unix]].

In collaboration with Shen Lin he devised well-known [[heuristics]] for two [[NP-complete]] optimization problems: [[graph partitioning]] and the [[travelling salesman problem]]. (In a display of authorial equity, the former is usually called the ''[[Kernighan–Lin]]'' algorithm, while the latter is styled ''[[Lin–Kernighan]]''.)

Kernighan was the software editor for [[Prentice Hall|Prentice Hall International]]. His "Software Tools" series spread the essence of 'C/Unix thinking' with makeovers for [[BASIC]], [[FORTRAN]], and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] - and most notably his '[[Ratfor]]' (rational FORTRAN) was put in the public domain.

He has said that if stranded on an island with only one programming language it would have to be [[C (programming language)|C]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~mihaib/kernighan-interview/index.html |title=An Interview with Brian Kernighan |first=Mihai |last=Budiu |date=July, 2000}}</ref>

Kernighan coined the term [[Unix]] in the 1970s. The original term he coined was Unics (for Uniplexed Information and Computing Service, a play on [[Multics]]), which was later changed to Unix.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Kernighan is also known as a coiner of the expression "'''What You See Is All You Get (WYSIAYG)'''", which is a sarcastic variant of the original "What You See Is What You Get" ([[WYSIWYG]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}
Kernighan's term is used to indicate that WYSIWYG systems might throw away information in a document that could be useful in other contexts.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Toronto]], Kernighan attended the [[University of Toronto]] between 1960 and 1964, earning his [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[Engineering Physics]].<ref name="LJ 2003" /> He received his PhD in [[electrical engineering]] from [[Princeton University]], where he has held a professorship in the department of computer science since 2000.  Each fall he teaches a course called "Computers in Our World", which introduces the fundamentals of computing to non-majors.

==Summary of achievements==
* The [[AMPL]] programming language
* The [[AWK (programming language)|AWK]] programming language, along with [[Al Aho]] and [[Peter J. Weinberger]], and its book ''[[The AWK Programming Language (book)|The AWK Programming Language]]''
* [[ditroff]], or "device independent [[troff]]", which allowed troff to be used with any device
* [[The Elements of Programming Style]], with [[P. J. Plauger]]
* The first documented [[Hello, world]] program, in Kernighan's [http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/btut.html "A Tutorial Introduction to the Language B"] (1972)
* [[Ratfor]]
* [[Software Tools]], a book and set of tools for [[Ratfor]], cocreated in part with P. J. Plauger
* [[Software Tools in Pascal]], a book and set of tools for [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], with P. J. Plauger
* [[The C Programming Language (book)|The C Programming Language]] along with C creator [[Dennis Ritchie]], the first book on C
* The [[eqn]] typesetting language for [[troff]], along with [[Lorinda Cherry]]
* The [[m4 (computer language)|m4]] macro processing language, with [[Dennis Ritchie]]
* The [[pic language|pic]] typesetting language for [[troff]]
* [[The Practice of Programming]], with [[Rob Pike]]
* [[The Unix Programming Environment]], a tutorial book along with [[Rob Pike]]
* [http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html "Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language"], a popular criticism of [[Niklaus Wirth]]'s [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. Some parts of the criticism are obsolete due to ISO 7185 (Programming Languages - Pascal), the criticism was written before ISO 7185 was created. (AT&T Computing Science Technical Report #100)
