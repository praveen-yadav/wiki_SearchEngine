The '''anus''' ({{etymology|la|anus|ring, anus}}, which is from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''ano–'', meaning "ring" ) is an opening at the opposite end of an animal's [[digestive tract]] from the mouth. Its function is to control the expulsion of [[feces]], unwanted semi-solid matter produced during digestion, which, depending on the type of animal, may include: matter which the animal cannot digest, such as [[coprolite|bones]];<ref name="ChinEtal1998KingSizeCoprolite">{{cite journal

Amphibians, reptiles, and birds use the same orifice (known as the [[cloaca]]) for excreting liquid and solid wastes, and for [[copulation]] and [[Egg (biology)|egg]]-laying. [[Monotreme]] mammals also have a cloaca, which is thought to be a feature inherited from the earliest [[amniote]]s via the [[therapsid]]s. [[Marsupial]]s have a single orifice for excreting both solids and liquids and, in females, a separate [[vagina]] for reproduction. Female [[placental]] mammals have completely separate orifices for [[defecation]], [[urination]], and reproduction; males have one opening for defecation and another for both urination and reproduction, although the channels flowing to that orifice are almost completely separate.

The development of the anus was an important stage in the evolution of multicellular animals. It appears to have happened at least twice, following different paths in [[protostome]]s and [[deuterostome]]s. This accompanied or facilitated other important evolutionary developments: the [[bilaterian|bilaterian body plan]], the [[coelom]], and [[Metamerism (biology)|metamerism]], in which the body was built of repeated "modules" which could later specialize, such as the heads of most [[arthropods]], which are composed of fused, specialized segments.

==Development==
{{main|Protostome|Deuterostome}}
In animals at least as complex as an [[earthworm]], the [[embryo]] forms a dent on one side, the [[blastopore]], which deepens to become the [[archenteron]], the first phase in the growth of the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]]. In deuterostomes, the original dent becomes the anus while the gut eventually tunnels through to make another opening, which forms the mouth. The protostomes were so named because it was thought that in their embryos the dent formed the mouth first (''[[wikt:proto-|proto–]]'' meaning "first") and the anus was formed later at the opening made by the other end of the gut. More recent research, however, shows that in protostomes the edges of the dent close up in the middle, leaving openings at the ends which become the mouth and anus.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Evolution of the bilaterian larval foregut | author=Arendt, D., Technau, U., and Wittbrodt, J. | journal=Nature | volume=409 | pages=81–85 | date=4 January 2001 | doi=10.1038/35051075 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6816/full/409081a0.html | accessdate=2008-07-14 | pmid=11343117 | issue=6816}}</ref>
