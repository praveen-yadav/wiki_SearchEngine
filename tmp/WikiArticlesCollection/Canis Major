'''Canis Major''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|eɪ|n|ɨ|s|_|ˈ|m|eɪ|dʒ|ər}} is one of the 88 modern [[constellation]]s, and was included in the 2nd-century astronomer [[Ptolemy]]'s 48 constellations. Its name is [[Latin]] for 'greater dog', and is commonly represented as one of the dogs following [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] the hunter (see also [[Canis Minor]] the 'lesser dog'). Canis Major contains [[Sirius]], the [[List of brightest stars|brightest star]] in the night sky, known as the 'dog star'. It is bright because of its proximity to our Solar System. In contrast, the other bright stars of the constellation are distant luminous [[bright giant]]s and [[supergiant]]s. At magnitude 1.5, [[Epsilon Canis Majoris]] (Adhara) is the second brightest star of the constellation, followed by [[Delta Canis Majoris|Delta]] (Wezen) at 1.8, [[Beta Canis Majoris|Beta]] (Mirzam) at 2.0 and [[Eta Canis Majoris|Eta]] (Aludra) at 2.4. The red [[hypergiant]] [[VY Canis Majoris]] is one of the [[List of largest known stars|largest stars known]].

== Characteristics ==
Canis Major is a constellation in the [[southern hemisphere]]'s summer (or northern hemisphere's winter) sky, bordered by [[Monoceros]] (which lies between it and [[Canis Minor]]) to the north, [[Puppis]] to the east and southeast, [[Columba (constellation)|Columba]] to the southwest, and [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]] to the west. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'CMa'.<ref name="pa30_469">{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | pages=469–71 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922}}</ref> The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 4 sides. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|06|12.5}} and {{RA|07|27.5}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between -11.03° and −33.25°.<ref name="boundary">{{cite journal | title=Canis Major, Constellation Boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#cma | accessdate=15 November 2012 }}</ref> Covering 380 square degrees, it ranks 43rd of the 88 constellations in size.

=== Stars ===
{{see also|List of stars in Canis Major}}
Johannes Bayer used the Greek letters Alpha through to Omicron to label the most prominent stars in the constellation,{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=73}} with Bode later adding Sigma, Tau and Omega.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=74}} Lacaille added lettered stars a to k but none are in use today.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=74}}  John Flamsteed numbered thirty one stars, with 3 CMa being placed by Lacaille into Columba as [[Delta Columbae]] (Flamsteed had not recognised Columba as a distinct constellation).{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=368}} 

Canis Major is a very prominent constellation because of its many bright stars. These include [[Sirius]] (α Canis Majoris), the brightest star in the night sky, as well as three other stars above magnitude 2.0.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99}}

[[Alpha Canis Majoris]], commonly known as Sirius, is the [[List of brightest stars|brightest star]] visible in the night sky at [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] −1.44, and is one of the [[closest stars to Earth]] at a distance of 8.6 [[light-year]]s. Its name comes from the Greek word for "scorching" or "searing". It is a [[variable star]], with a variation of approximately 0.1 magnitude; this variability was discovered by the [[Hipparcos]] satellite. Sirius is also a [[double star]]; its companion is called [[Sirius B]], which has a magnitude of 8.4. The two [[orbit]] each other every 50 years. Their closest approach last occurred in 1993 and they will be at their greatest separation between 2020 and 2025. Sirius was the basis for the [[ancient Egyptian calendar]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99}} It is part of the [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as the [[Winter Triangle]] in the Northern Hemisphere, or the [[Summer Triangle]] in the Southern. The star is also recognized as Canis Major's nose.

Flanking Sirius are [[Beta Canis Majoris|Beta]] and [[Gamma Canis Majoris]]. Also called Mirzam or Murzim, Beta is a blue-hued [[pulsating variable star]] of magnitude 2.0, which varies by a few hundredths of a magnitude with a period of 6 hours. Mirzam is 500 light-years from Earth, and its traditional name means "the announcer", referring to its position as the "announcer" of Sirius, as it rises a few minutes before Sirius does.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99}} Gamma is a much fainter star of magnitude 4.11, in reality a blue-white bright giant 402 light years from earth.

[[Epsilon Canis Majoris]], also called Adhara, is the second brightest star in Canis Major and the 23rd brightest star in the sky. It is a blue-hued [[giant star]] of magnitude 1.5, 430 light-years from Earth. It is a binary star; the secondary is of magnitude 7.4. Its traditional name means "the virgins". Nearby is [[Delta Canis Majoris]], also called Wezen. It is a white-hued [[supergiant star]] of magnitude 1.8, 1800 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name means "the weight".  [[Eta Canis Majoris]], also called Aludra, is a blue-hued supergiant star of magnitude 2.4, 3200 light-years away. Nestled between Adhara and Wezen lies [[Sigma Canis Majoris]], known as Unurgunite to the Boorong people, a red supergiant 1,120 light years away of apparent magnitude 3.41. To the west of Adhara lies [[Zeta Canis Majoris]] or Furud, a 3.0 magnitude star which is actually a spectroscopic binary.

Between these stars and Sirius lie [[Omicron1 Canis Majoris|Omicron1]] and [[Omicron2 Canis Majoris]], and [[Pi Canis Majoris]].

North of Sirius lie [[Theta Canis Majoris|Theta]] and [[Mu Canis Majoris]]. Mu is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 5.0, 900 light-years away. It is a double star; the secondary is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 7.0. [[Nu Canis Majoris]] is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 5.7, 278 light-years away; it is at the threshold of naked-eye visibility. It has a companion of magnitude 8.1.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99}}

Canis Major is also home to several [[variable star]]s. [[Tau Canis Majoris]] is an eclipsing binary. [[UW Canis Majoris]] is a [[Beta Lyrae variable]] star 3000 light-years from Earth. It is an [[eclipsing binary]] that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 5.3 to a maximum of 4.8. It has a period of 4.4 days.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99}} [[R Canis Majoris]] is another eclipsing binary.

[[VY Canis Majoris]] is one of the largest stars known, a remote red hypergiant of apparent magnitude 7.5.

=== Deep-sky objects ===
There are not many bright [[deep-sky object]]s in Canis Major. Its only [[Messier object]] is [[Messier 41|M41]] (NGC 2287), an [[open cluster]] of [[visual magnitude]] 4.5, 2100 light-years from Earth. It is noted for being particularly large and bright—it contains approximately 80 stars in an area of 0.5 square degrees, the size of the [[full Moon]], and is visible to the naked eye—M41 was mapped by the [[ancient Greek astronomy|ancient Greeks]]. The open cluster has many orange-hued giants, the brightest of which are of the 7th magnitude. Canis Major also features another noteworthy [[open cluster]], [[NGC 2362]], a small, compact grouping, 5200 light-years from Earth. It contains about 60 stars, the brightest of which is [[Tau Canis Majoris|τ Canis Majoris]], a [[blue giant]] of magnitude 4.4.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99}}

The band of the [[Milky Way]] goes through Canis Major and therefore background [[galaxy|galaxies]] are hidden behind [[cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] clouds. However, in 2003, [[Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy|Canis Major Dwarf]], the closest [[satellite galaxy]] to Earth, was found within the constellation.

[[Sirius]], its brightest star, means "scorching star", since the summer heat occurred just after Sirius' [[heliacal rising]]. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] referred to such times in the summer as ''dog days'', as only dogs would be mad enough to go out in the heat, leading to the star being known as the ''Dog Star''. Consequently, the constellation was named after it, as 'The Big Dog'.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

[[File:Stars fleeing a cosmic crash.jpg|thumb|[[ESO 489-056]] is an irregular [[dwarf galaxy]], located 16 million light-years.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stars fleeing a cosmic crash|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1332a/|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=ESA/Hubble Picture of the Week}}</ref> ]]

However, Canis Major does feature a pair of [[interacting galaxy|interacting galaxies]]. [[NGC 2207 and IC 2163]] are a pair of face-on spiral galaxies located 125 million light-years from Earth. About 40 million years ago, the two galaxies had a close encounter and are now moving farther apart; nevertheless, the smaller IC 2163 will eventually be incorporated into NGC 2207. As the interaction continues, gas and dust will be perturbed, sparking extensive [[star formation]] in both galaxies.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}

[[NGC 2359]] (Thor's Helmet or the Duck Nebula) is a relatively bright [[nebula]] in Canis Major, with an approximate magnitude of 10, which is 10,000 light-years from Earth. The nebula is shaped by [[HD 56925]], an unstable [[Wolf-Rayet star]] embedded within it.<ref>{{cite book |first = David H. |last = Levy |title = Deep Sky Objects |publisher = Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, New York |year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-59102-361-6 |page = 108}}</ref>

=== Mythology ===
In early classical Europe, Canis Major represented the dog [[Laelaps (mythology)|Laelaps]], a gift from [[Zeus]] to [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]; or sometimes the hound of [[Procris]], [[Diana (goddess)|Diana's]] nymph; or the one given by [[Eos|Aurora]] to [[Cephalus]], so famed for its speed that [[Zeus]] elevated it to the sky. <ref name=Allen>{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Richard Hinckley|title=Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning|year=1963|publisher=Dover|isbn=0-486-21079-0|page=117}}</ref>

It was also considered to represent one of Orion's hunting dogs,{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99}} pursuing [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]] the [[Hare]] or helping Orion fight [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] the Bull; and is referred to in this way by [[Aratus|Aratos]], [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]. The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] refer only to one dog, but by [[ancient Rome|Roman]] times, [[Canis Minor]] appears as Orion's second dog. <ref name=Allen />

Sirius was considered a dog in its own right; early Greek mythology sometimes tells that the constellation represents a two-headed dog. As such, together with the area of the sky that is deserted (now considered as the new and extremely faint constellations [[Camelopardalis]] and [[Lynx (constellation)|Lynx]]), and the other features of the area in the [[Zodiac]] sign of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] (i.e. the [[Milky Way]], and the constellations [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]], and [[Canis Minor]]), this may be the origin of the myth of the cattle of [[Geryon]], which forms one of [[The Twelve Labours]] of [[Heracles]].{{Or|date=December 2008}}

The Roman myth refers to Canis Major as ''[[Custos Europae]]'', the dog guarding [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] but failing to prevent her abduction by [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] in the form of a bull; and as ''[[Cerberus|Janitor Lethaeus]]'', the watchdog. <ref>{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Richard Hinckley|title=Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning|year=1963|publisher=Dover|isbn=0-486-21079-0|page=118}}</ref>

In [[Chinese astronomy]], the modern constellation of Canis Major lies in ''[[Vermilion Bird (Chinese constellation)|The Vermillion Bird of the South]]'' (南方朱雀, ''Nán Fāng Zhū Què'').{{sfn|AEEA|2006}}

Both the [[Maori people]] and the people of the [[Tuamotus]] recognized the figure of Canis Major as a distinct entity, though it was sometimes absorbed into other constellations. ''Te Huinga-o-Rehua'', also called ''Te Putahi-nui-o-Rehua'' and ''Te Kahui-Takurua'', ("The Assembly of Rehua" or "The Assembly of Sirius") was a Maori constellation that included both Canis Minor and Canis Major, along with some surrounding stars.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=212}}{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=215}} Related was ''Taumata-o-Rehua'', also called ''Pukawanui'', the Mirror of Rehua, formed from an undefined group of stars in Canis Major.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=258}}{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=247}} They called Sirius ''Rehua'' and ''Takarua'', corresponding to two of the names for the constellation, though ''Rehua'' was a name applied to other stars in various Maori groups and other Polynesian cosmologies.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=249}}{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=254}} The Tuamotu people called Canis Major ''Muihanga-hetika-o-Takurua'', "the abiding assemblage of Takurua".{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=236}} In their cosmology, Sirius had various names, including ''Takurua-te-upuupu'',{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=280}} ''Te Kaha'' ("coconut fiber"),{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=214}} ''Te Upuupu'',{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=265}} ''Taranga'',{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=257}} and ''Vero-ma-torutoru'' ("flaming and diminishing").{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=266}} Beta Canis Majoris was called ''Oupo''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=239}} Sirius itself was named by several other Polynesian cultures. The [[Hawaiian people]] had many names for Sirius, including ''Aa'' ("glowing"),{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=198}} ''Hoku-kauopae'',{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=280}} ''Kau-ano-meha'' (also ''Kaulanomeha''), "Standing-alone-and-sacred",{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=280}}{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=218}} ''Hiki-kauelia'' or ''Hiki-kauilia'' (the navigational name), ''Hiki-kau-lono-meha'' ("star of solitary Lono", the astrological name),{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=207}} ''Kaulua'' (also ''Kaulua-ihai-mohai'', "flower of the heavens"),{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=219}} ''Hiki-kauelia'', ''Hoku-hoo-kele-waa'' ("star which causes the canoe to sail", a marine navigation name),{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=209}} and ''Kaulua-lena'' ("yellow star").{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=219}} The people of the [[Society Islands]] called Sirius variously ''Taurua-fau-papa'', ''Taurua-nui-te-amo-aha'', and ''Taurua-e-hiti-i-tara-te-feiai''. Other names for Sirius included ''Palolo-mua'' ([[Futuna]]), ''Mere'' ([[Mangaia]]), ''Apura'' ([[Manihiki]]), ''Taku-ua'' ([[Marquesas Islands]]), and ''Tokiva'' ([[Pukapuka]]).{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=280}}

Depending on the faintness of stars considered, Canis Major can be shown to resemble a dog facing either above or below the [[ecliptic]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

=== Space Exploration ===
The [[Space probe]] [[Voyager 2]] is slowly moving in the direction of this constellation, though it will not be nearing any of the stars in this constellation for many thousands of years, by which time its batteries will be exhausted.
