An '''anti-diarrhoeal drug''' (or '''anti-diarrheal drug''' in American English) is any [[medication]] which provides symptomatic relief for [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]].

==Types==
* [[Electrolyte]] solutions are used to replace lost fluids and [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] in acute cases.
* [[Bulking agent]]s like [[methylcellulose]], [[guar gum]] or plant [[dietary fiber|fibre]] ([[bran]], [[sterculia]], [[Psyllium seed husks|isabgol]], etc.) are used for diarrhoea in functional bowel disease and to control [[ileostomy]] output.
* [[Absorption (chemistry)|Absorbent]]s absorb toxic substances that cause infective diarrhoea, methylcellulose is an absorbent.
* [[Anti-inflammatory]] solutions like [[bismuth subsalicylate]].
* [[Opioid]]s' classical use besides pain relief is as an anti-diarrhoeal drug. Opioids have [[agonist]] actions on the intestinal opioid receptors, which when activated cause [[constipation]]. Drugs such as [[morphine]] or [[codeine]] can be used to relieve diarrhoea this way. A notable opioid for the purpose of relief of diarrhoea is [[loperamide]] which is only an agonist of the [[mu Opioid receptor|μ opioid receptor]]s in the large intestine and does not have opioid affects in the [[central nervous system]] as it doesn't cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] in significant amounts. This enables [[loperamide hydrochloride]] to be used to the same benefit as other opioid drugs but without the CNS side effects or potential for abuse.
