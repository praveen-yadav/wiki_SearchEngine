===Health concerns===
While filming ''[[Æon Flux (film)|Æon Flux]]'' in Berlin, Germany, Theron suffered a [[Spinal disc herniation|herniated disc]] in her neck, caused by a fall while filming a series of back [[handspring (gymnastics)|handsprings]]. This required her to wear a neck brace for a month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/od/aeonflux/a/aeonct071705.htm|title= Charlize Theron Talks About Starring in "Aeon Flux"|accessdate=23 February 2008|first=Rebecca|last=  Murray|publisher=[[About.com]]}}</ref> In July 2009, Theron was diagnosed with a serious stomach virus, thought to be contracted while travelling outside the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,531461,00.html|title=Report: Charlize Theron Hospitalized With Serious Virus|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=10 July 2009|date=11 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/275825|title=Charlize Theron Recovering From 'Unknown' Virus|publisher=Digitaljournal.com|accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref> When filming ''[[The Road (2009 film)|The Road]],'' Theron injured her [[vocal cords]] during the [[childbirth|labour]] screaming scenes.<ref>The Road Region 1 DVD, Special feature: The Making of The Road</ref>

==Promotional deals==
Having signed a deal with [[John Galliano]] in 2004, Theron replaced [[Estonian people|Estonian]] model [[Tiiu Kuik]] as the spokeswoman in the "J'adore" advertisements by [[Christian Dior]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/08/13/news/newsmakers/charlize_dior|title=Dior signs Charlize Theron|publisher=CNN|date=13 August 2004}}</ref>

From October 2005 to December 2006, Theron earned US$3 million for the use of her image in a worldwide print media advertising campaign for [[Raymond Weil]] watches.<ref name="smoke">[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/1001082theron1.html Charlize Theron's Screen Gems] from [[The Smoking Gun]]</ref> In February 2006, she and her loan-out corporation were sued by Weil for breach of contract.<ref name="smoke" /><ref name="NewsMax">{{cite news|url=http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/2/6/140336.shtml |title=Actress Charlize Theron Sued by Swiss Watchmaker|agency=Associated Press|date= 6 February 2007}}</ref> The lawsuit was settled on 4 November 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/charlize-theron-settles-20m-lawsuit-brought-by-swiss-watchmaker_article_12006|title=Charlize Theron settles $20M lawsuit brought by Swiss watchmaker|publisher=Accesshollywood.com|date=4 November 2008|accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref>

==Activism==
The Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project (CTAOP) was created in 2007 by Charlize Theron, Academy Award winning actor and UN Messenger of Peace, in an effort to support African youth in the fight against HIV/AIDS. CTAOP’s mission is to help keep African youth safe from HIV/AIDS. The Project is committed to supporting community-engaged organizations that address the key drivers of the disease. Although the geographic scope of CTAOP is Sub-Saharan Africa, the primary concentration has mostly been Charlize’s home country of South Africa. CTAOP's approach is based on the belief that community-based organizations on the ground understand the social and structural relationships of their communities better than anyone. By supporting these organizations through grant giving, networking, and spotlighting their work, CTAOP enables communities to mobilize and empower themselves to prevent [[HIV]].<ref name="CTAOP">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlizeafricaoutreach.org|title=Message from Charlize}}</ref>

In December 2009, CTAOP and [[TOMS Shoes]] partnered to create a limited edition unisex shoe. The shoe was made from vegan materials and inspired by the African [[Adansonia digitata|baobab]] tree, the silhouette of which was embroidered on blue and orange canvas. Ten-thousand pairs were given to destitute children, and a portion of the proceeds went to CTAOP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com/2009/12/17/exclusive-charlize-theron-designs-a-shoe-with-toms-for-charity|title= Charlize Theron Designs Shoes with TOMS for Charity|work=People |date= 17 December 2009}}</ref>

Theron is involved in [[feminism|women's rights]] organisations, and has marched in [[pro-choice]] rallies.<ref>
{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/26/1082831473096.html|title=Hillary takes on Bush|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=26 April 2004}}</ref> Theron also is a supporter of [[animal rights]] and active member of [[PETA]]. She appeared in a PETA ad for its anti-fur campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.furisdead.com/feat/charlize|title=Charlize Theron Dogs the Fur Trade|publisher=People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)|accessdate=16 January 2008}}</ref>

She is a supporter of [[same-sex marriage]] and attended a march to support that in [[Fresno, California]], on 30 May 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thousands attend Fresno rally supporting gay marriage|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/05/thousand-attend-fresno-rally-supporting-of-gay-marriage.html|work=latimes.com|date=30 May 2009|accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref>
She is a gay rights activist and refuses to get married until same sex marriage is legal in the United States.
{{quote|I don't want to get married because right now the institution of marriage feels very one-sided, and I want to live in a country where we all have equal rights...
<p>...I think it would be exactly the same if we were married, but for me to go through that kind of ceremony, because I have so many friends who are gays and lesbians who would so badly want to get married, that I wouldn't be able to sleep with myself.<ref>{{cite news|title=Charlize Theron: I Won't Get Married Until My Gay Friends Can|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/17/charlize-theron-i-wont-ge_n_290073.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=17 November 2009|first=Katy|last=Hall|date=17 September 2009}}</ref>}}

In a June 2011 interview on ''[[Piers Morgan Tonight]]'', she stated

{{quote|When government starts to tell us who can love and what is good love… I do have a problem with that. I do have a problem with the fact that our government hasn’t stepped up enough to make this federal, to make [gay marriage] legal. I think everybody has that right.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charlize Theron, Piers Morgan Talk Gay Marriage, Long-Term Relationships|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/122316/charlize-theron-piers-morgan-gay-marriage/|accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>}}
