(registration required; initial 14-day free pass)</ref> --> is an American film and television [[actress]], [[singer]], and [[animal rights]] [[activist]].

Day began her career as a big band singer in 1939. Her popularity began to rise after her first hit recording, "[[Sentimental Journey (song)|Sentimental Journey]]", in 1945. After leaving [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown & His Band of Renown]] to try a solo career, she started her long-lasting partnership with [[Columbia Records]], which would remain her only recording label. The contract lasted from 1947 to 1967, and included more than 650 recordings, making Day one of the most popular and acclaimed singers of the 20th century. In 1948, after being persuaded by [[Sammy Cahn]], [[Jule Styne]] and her agent at the time, Al Levy, she auditioned for [[Michael Curtiz]], which led to her being cast in the female lead role in ''[[Romance on the High Seas]]''.{{Sfn | Hotchner | 1975 | p = 91}}

Over the course of her career, Day appeared in 39 films. She was ranked the biggest box-office star, the only woman on that list, for four years (1960, 1962, 1963 and 1964) ranking in the top 10 for ten years (1951–1952 and 1959–1966). She became the top-ranking female box-office star of all time and is currently ranked sixth among the top 10 box office performers (male and female), as of 2012.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html | publisher = Quigley Publishing | title = Annual Box Office Poll & All-Time Top Ten Stars List}}</ref> She received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for her performance in ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'', won three Henrietta Awards (World Film Favorite), received the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association| Los Angeles Film Critics Association's Career Achievement Award]] and, in 1989, received the [[Cecil B. DeMille Award]] for lifetime achievement in motion pictures. Day made her last film in 1968.

Day has also released 31 albums, and her songs have spent a total of 460 weeks in the Top 40 charts.{{Sfn | Santopietro | 2008 | p = 191}} She has been awarded a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and a [[Society of Singers|Legend Award from the Society of Singers]]. In 2011, she released her 29th studio album, ''[[My Heart (Doris Day album)|My Heart]]'', which debuted at No. 9 on the UK Top 40 charts. Day is the oldest artist to score a UK Top 10 with an album featuring new material.

Her strong commitment to animal welfare began in 1971, when she co-founded "Actors and Others for Animals". She started her own non-profit organization in the late 1970s, the Doris Day Animal Foundation and, later, the [[Doris Day Animal League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dorisday.com/work?id=0003 |title=Animal Welfare&nbsp;– Doris' Work |publisher=Doris Day | accessdate= April 4, 2012}}</ref> Establishing the annual observance [[Spay Day USA]] in 1994, The Doris Day Animal League now partners with the [[Humane Society of the United States]] and continues to be a leading advocacy organization. In 2004, she received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from President [[George W. Bush]] in recognition of her distinguished service to the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=President Bush Presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/06/20040623-8.html| publisher=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=July 4, 2013|date=June 23, 2004}}</ref>

Day has since retired from acting and performing, but has continued her work in animal rights causes and animal welfare. She currently lives in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]].

==Early life==
Doris Mary Ann Kappelhoff was born in [[Cincinnati]] to Alma Sophia (née Welz, a housewife) and William Kappelhoff (a music teacher and choir master) on April 3, 1924.<ref group=Note>As verification, the 1940 US census (enumerated on April 10, 1940) gave her age as 18 (1922 birth). However, in ''Doris Day: Her Own Story'', Day asserted that she "was named by my mother in honor of her favorite actress, [[Doris Kenyon]], a [[silent film|silent screen]] star of that year 1922." Day said she added two years to her age in order to get singing jobs.</ref> All of her grandparents were [[German American|German immigrants]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.wargs.com/other/day.html | title = Doris Day | type = ancestry | publisher = Wargs}}</ref>

The youngest of three siblings, she had two older brothers: Richard (who died before her birth) and Paul, several years older.{{Sfn | Hotchner | p = 18}} Due to her father's alleged infidelity,<ref>{{cite news|first=Cleveland|last=Amory|title=Doris Day talks about Rock Hudson, Ronald Reagan and her own story|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GIsfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IWMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5091,1222023&dq=doris-day&hl=en|accessdate=August 10, 2013|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=August 3, 1986}}</ref> her parents separated.

==Career==

===Early career (1938–1947)===
While recovering, Day started to sing along with the radio and discovered a talent that she didn't know she had. Day said: "During this long, boring period, I used to while away a lot of time listening to the radio, sometimes singing along with the likes of [[Benny Goodman]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Tommy Dorsey]] and [[Glenn Miller]] [...]. But the one radio voice I listened to above others belonged to [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. There was a quality to her voice that fascinated me, and I'd sing along with her, trying to catch the subtle ways she shaded her voice, the casual yet clean way she sang the words."{{Sfn | Hotchner | pp = 38–9}} Observing her daughter rekindled Alma's interest in show business, and she decided to give Doris singing lessons. She engaged a teacher, Grace Raine.{{Sfn | Hotchner | p = 38}} After three lessons, Raine told Alma that Doris had "tremendous potential," which led Alma to give her daughter three lessons a week for the price of one. Years later, Day said that Raine had the biggest effect on her singing style and career.{{Sfn | Hotchner | pp = 38–9}} During the eight months of singing lessons, Day had her first professional jobs as a vocalist in the [[WLW]] radio program, ''Carlin's Carnival'' and in a local restaurant, the Charlie Yee's Shanghai Inn.{{Sfn | Hotchner | pp = 40–41}} It was during her performances in the carnival that Day first caught the attention of [[Barney Rapp]], who sought a girl vocalist and asked if Day would like to audition for the job. According to Rapp, he had auditioned about 200 singers when Day got the job.{{Sfn | Hotchner | 1975 | p = 44}}

It was while working for Rapp in 1939 that she adopted the stage name "Day" (at Rapp's suggestion).<ref>{{cite web|title=Doris Day's sweet success|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3569113.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=August 10, 2013|date=April 3, 2004}}</ref> Rapp felt that "Kappelhoff" was too long for [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]], and he admired her rendition of the song "Day After Day." This was the origin of her [[stage name]].{{Sfn | Kaufman | 2008 |p = 22}}

After working with Rapp, Day worked with bandleaders [[Jimmy James (musician)|Jimmy James]],<ref>{{Citation | newspaper = The Lima (Ohio) News | date = April 17, 1940 | page = 11 | title = To Entertain at Convention Here}}</ref> [[Bob Crosby]],<ref name="Sutro2011">{{cite book|last=Sutro|first=Dirk|title=Jazz For Dummies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tqkRibY3RHoC&pg=PA112|accessdate=August 8, 2013|date=April 20, 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-06852-6|page=112}}</ref> and [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]].<ref name="Family2009">{{cite book|author=The Guinan Family|title=Lakewood Park|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zh0zVcyDFxUC&pg=PA72|accessdate=August 8, 2013|date=October 2009|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-6578-1|page=72}}</ref> It was while working with Brown that Day scored her first hit recording, [[Sentimental Journey (song)|"Sentimental Journey]]," released in early 1945.

By the time she left Brown's band in August of 1946, she was the highest paid female band vocalist in the world.

While singing with the Les Brown band and for nearly two years on Bob Hope's weekly radio program,<ref name="BrowneBrowne2001"/> she toured extensively across the United States. Her popularity as a radio performer and vocalist, which included a second hit record "[[My Dreams Are Getting Better All the Time]]", led directly to a career in films.

In 1950, U.S. servicemen in Korea voted her their favorite star. She continued to make minor and frequently nostalgic period musicals such as ''[[Starlift]]'', ''[[The West Point Story (film)|The West Point Story]]'', ''[[On Moonlight Bay (film)|On Moonlight Bay]]'', ''[[By the Light of the Silvery Moon (film)|By the Light of the Silvery Moon]]'', and ''[[Tea for Two (film)|Tea For Two]]'' for Warner Brothers.  Her most commercially successful film for Warners was "I'll See You in My Dreams," which broke box-office records of 20 years' standing during its premiere engagement at Radio City Music Hall in 1951. In 1953, Day appeared as the title character in the comedic western-themed musical, ''[[Calamity Jane (film)|Calamity Jane]]'', winning the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for "[[Secret Love (Doris Day song)|Secret Love]]" (her recording of which became her fourth #1 hit single in the U.S.).<ref name="Tyler2008">{{cite book|last=Tyler|first=Don|title=Music of the Postwar Era|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2dgJVseZAlsC&pg=PA110|accessdate=August 9, 2013|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34191-5|page=110}}</ref> Between 1950 and 1953, the albums from six of her movie musicals charted in the Top 10, three of them at #1.

[[File:Doris Day in Love Me or Leave Me trailer.jpg|right|thumb|Day in the trailer for ''[[Love Me or Leave Me (film)|Love Me or Leave Me]]'' (1955)]]
Day subsequently took on more dramatic roles, including her 1955 portrayal of singer [[Ruth Etting]] in the biographical film of Etting's life, ''[[Love Me or Leave Me (film)|Love Me or Leave Me]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Cagney]].<ref name="LisantiPaul2002">{{cite book|last1=Lisanti|first1=Tom|last2=Paul|first2=Louis|title=Film Fatales: Women in Espionage Films and Television, 1962-1973|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4VJCaXXANA0C&pg=PA104|accessdate=August 8, 2013|date=January 1, 2002|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1194-8|page=104}}</ref> Day would later call it, in her autobiography, her best film. The film garnered critical and commercial success, becoming Day's biggest hit so far.  Producer Joe Pasternak said, "I was stunned that Doris didn't get an Oscar nomination." The sound track album from that movie was a #1 hit that stayed charted for 28 weeks and became the recording industry's third biggest selling album of the entire decade.  Day starred in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s suspense film, ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1956) with [[James Stewart]]. She sang only two songs in the film, "[[Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)]]", which won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]],<ref name="Tyler2008">{{cite book|last=Tyler|first=Don|title=Music of the Postwar Era|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2dgJVseZAlsC&pg=PA113|accessdate=August 8, 2013|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34191-5|pages=113–114}}</ref> and "We'll Love Again".

He replied, "It wasn't me; it was Doris."  The film was Day's 10th movie to be in the Top 10 at the box office. Day played the title role in the thriller/noir ''[[Julie (1956 film)|Julie]]'' (1956) with [[Louis Jourdan]]. The film received poor press acclaim and was unpopular with audiences.

After three successive dramatic films, Day returned to her musical/comedic roots in 1957's ''[[The Pajama Game (film)|The Pajama Game]]'' with [[John Raitt]]. The film was based on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play of [[The Pajama Game|the same name]]. She worked with [[Paramount Pictures]] for the comedy ''[[Teacher's Pet (1958 film)|Teacher's Pet]]'' (1958), alongside [[Clark Gable]] and Gig Young (for the second time). Day co-starred with [[Richard Widmark]] and [[Gig Young]] in the romantic comedy film, ''[[The Tunnel of Love]]'' in 1958. She found meager success opposite [[Jack Lemmon]] in ''[[It Happened to Jane]]'', a comedy film released in 1959.  Billboard's annual nationwide poll of disc jockeys had ranked Day as the #1 female vocalist nine times in ten years (1949 through 1958), but her success and popularity as a singer was now being overshadowed by her box office appeal.

In 1962, Day appeared with Cary Grant in ''[[That Touch of Mink]]'', the first film in history ever to gross $1 million in one theatre (Radio City Music Hall). Day was in the Top 10 at the box office 10 times.  During 1960 and the 1962 to 1964 period, she ranked No. 1 at the box office, the only woman to be #1 four times.  She set an unprecedented record that has yet to be equaled, receiving seven consecutive Laurel Awards as the top female box office star.  <ref name="Morris1976">{{cite book|last=Morris|first=George|title=Doris Day|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bu9kAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=August 9, 2013|year=1976|publisher=Pyramid Publications|isbn=978-0-515-03959-7|page=10}}</ref>

By the late 1960s, the [[sexual revolution]] of the [[baby boomer]] generation had refocused public attitudes about sex. Times changed, but Day's films did not. Day's 1965 film, ''[[Do Not Disturb (1965 film)|Do Not Disturb]]'', was a box office failure and was unpopular with critics as well.

As a result, she slipped from the list of top box office stars, last appearing in the top ten in 1966 with the hit film ''[[The Glass Bottom Boat]]''.

===Bankruptcy and television career===
When third husband [[Martin Melcher|Marty Melcher]] died on April 20, 1968, a shocked Day discovered that Melcher and his business partner Jerome Bernard Rosenthal had squandered her earnings,<ref group =Note>Jerome Bernard Rosenthal (born April 1, 1911&nbsp;– died August 15, 2007) was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the State Bar of California]] on June 11, 1946 after graduating from the University of Chicago Law School. His clients included Ross Hunter, Van Johnson and Gordon MacRae. Rosenthal was Day's lawyer, business manager, and tax adviser under a May 1956 agreement (in which he was to receive 10% of virtually everything owned or earned by Day and Melcher).</ref> leaving her deeply in debt.<ref name="Sonneborn2002">{{cite book|last=Sonneborn|first=Liz|title=A to Z of American Women in the Performing Arts|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Yf2741A_BkYC&pg=PA52|accessdate=August 8, 2013|date=January 1, 2002|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0790-5|page=52}}</ref> Rosenthal had been her attorney since 1949, when he represented her in her uncontested divorce action against her second husband, saxophonist [[George W. Weidler]]. In February 1969, Day filed suit against Rosenthal and won the then-largest civil judgment (over $20&nbsp;million) in the state of California.  (She later settled for about one-quarter of the amount originally awarded. <ref name="metnews"/>

Day also learned that Melcher had committed her to a television series, which became ''[[The Doris Day Show]]''.
{{quote |"It was awful", Day told ''[[OK!|OK! Magazine]]'' in 1996. "I was really, really not very well when Marty [Melcher] passed away, and the thought of going into TV was overpowering. But he'd signed me up for a series. And then my son Terry [Melcher] took me walking in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] and explained that it wasn't nearly the end of it. I had also been signed up for a bunch of [[Television special|TV specials]], all without anyone ever asking me."}}

Day hated the idea of doing television, but felt obliged to it.<ref name="TCM2013"/> "There was a contract. I didn't know about it. I never wanted to do TV, but I gave it 100 percent anyway. That's the only way I know how to do it." The first episode of ''The Doris Day Show'' aired on September 24, 1968, and, from 1968 to 1973, employed "Que Sera, Sera" as its theme song. Day grudgingly persevered (she needed the work to help pay off her debts), but only after [[CBS]] ceded creative control to her and her son. The successful show enjoyed a five-year run (its second season finished in the Top 10 of the Nielsen ratings), and functioned as a curtain-raiser for ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]''.  It is remembered today for its abrupt season-to-season changes in casting and premise. It was not widely syndicated as many of its contemporaries were, and was re-broadcast very little outside the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom.{{Sfn | McGee | 2005 |pp = 227–8}} By the end of its run in 1973, public tastes had changed and her firmly established persona regarded as passé. She largely retired from acting after ''The Doris Day Show'', but did complete two television specials, ''The Doris Mary Anne Kappelhoff Special'' (1971) and ''Doris Day to Day'' (1975). She appeared in a [[John Denver]] TV special in 1974.<ref name="Day" />

In the 1985-86 season, Day hosted her own television talk show, ''Doris Day's Best Friends'' on [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Oberman|first=Tracy-Ann|title=Rock and Doris and Elizabeth: a moment that changed Hollywood|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/oct/15/rock-hudson-revealed-aids|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=July 4, 2013|date=October 16, 2012}}</ref> The network canceled the show after 26 episodes, despite the worldwide publicity it received.

===1970s===
On September 18, 1974, courts awarded Day $22,835,646 for fraud and [[malpractice]] in an hour-long oral decision by Superior Judge Lester E. Olson, ending a 99-day trial that involved 18 consolidated lawsuits and countersuits filed by Day and Rosenthal that involved Rosenthal's handling of her finances after she terminated him in July 1968.<ref name=metnews>{{cite news|last=Grace|first=Roger M.|title='Uncle Jerry' Faces the Music in Court, in State Bar Proceeding|url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/2007/perspectives100907.htm|accessdate=August 8, 2013|newspaper=Metropolitan News-Enterprise|date=October 9, 2007}}</ref> The civil trial included 14,451 pages of transcript from 67 witnesses. Represented by attorney Robert Winslow and the law firm of Mitchell, Silberberg & Knupp LLP, courts awarded Day $1&nbsp;million punitive damages, $5.6&nbsp;million plus $2&nbsp;million interest for losses incurred in a sham oil venture; $3.4&nbsp;million plus $1.2&nbsp;million interest over a hotel venture; $2.2&nbsp;million plus $793,800 interest for duplicate or unnecessary fees paid to Rosenthal; more than $2&nbsp;million to recoup loans to Rosenthal; $3.9&nbsp;million plus $1&nbsp;million interest for fraud, and $850,000 attorney fees for Day. Olson also enjoined Rosenthal from prosecuting any more lawsuits against Day or her business operations. (Rosenthal had filed more than 20 suits from 1969 to 1974). Olson, an expert in complex financial marital settlements, read every page of 3,275 individual exhibits and 68 boxes of miscellaneous financial records. In October 1979, Rosenthal's liability insurer settled with Day for about $6&nbsp;million payable in 23 annual installments.<ref name=Disbarred1987>{{cite news|last=Hager|first=Philip|title=Doris Day's Former Lawyer Disbarred|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-14/news/mn-4016_1_doris-day|accessdate=August 9, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 14, 1987}}</ref> Rosenthal continued to file an appeal in the 2nd District Court of Appeal. He also filed another half-dozen suits related to the case. Two were libel suits, one against Day and her publishers over comments she made about Rosenthal in her book in which he sought damages. The other suits sought court determinations that insurance companies and individual lawyers failed to defend Rosenthal properly before Olson and in appellate stages. In April 1979, he filed a suit to set aside the $6&nbsp;million settlement with Day and recover damages from everybody involved in agreeing to the payment supposedly without his permission.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===1980s and 1990s===
In October 1985, the California Supreme Court rejected Rosenthal's appeal of the multimillion-dollar judgment against him for legal malpractice, and upheld conclusions of a trial court and a Court of Appeal that Rosenthal acted improperly. In April 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the lower court's judgment. In June 1987, Rosenthal filed a $30&nbsp;million lawsuit against lawyers he claimed cheated him out of millions of dollars in real estate investments. He also named Day as a co-defendant, describing her as an "unwilling, involuntary plaintiff whose consent cannot be obtained". Rosenthal claimed that millions of dollars Day lost were in real estate sold after Melcher died in 1968, in which Rosenthal asserted that the attorneys gave Day bad advice, telling her to sell, at a loss, three hotels, in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[Dallas]] and [[Atlanta]] and some oil leases in [[Kentucky]] and [[Ohio]]. Rosenthal claimed he had made the investments under a long-term plan, and did not intend to sell them until they appreciated in value. Two of the hotels sold in 1970 for about $7&nbsp;million, and their estimated worth in 1986 was $50&nbsp;million. In July 1984, after a hearing panel of the State Bar Court, after 80 days of testimony and consideration of documentary evidence, the panel accused Rosenthal of 13 separate acts of misconduct and urged his disbarment in a 34-page unsigned opinion.<ref name=Disbarred1987 /> The State Bar Court's review department upheld the panel's findings, which asked the justices to order Rosenthal's disbarment. He continued representing clients in federal courts until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against him on March 21, 1988. Disbarment by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals followed on August 19, 1988. The Supreme Court of California, in affirming the disbarment, held that Rosenthal engaged in transactions involving undisclosed conflicts of interest, took positions adverse to his former clients, overstated expenses, double-billed for legal fees, failed to return client files, failed to provide access to records, failed to give adequate legal advice, failed to provide clients with an opportunity to obtain independent counsel, filed fraudulent claims, gave false testimony, engaged in conduct designed to harass his clients, delayed court proceedings, obstructed justice and abused legal process.

Rosenthal died August 15, 2007, at the age of 96.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.metnews.com/articles/2007/perspectives100107.htm |title= 'Uncle Jerry'—Jerome B.

Most of the interviews on the subject given to Hotchner (and included in Day's autobiography) paint an unflattering portrait of Melcher. Author David Kaufman asserts that one of Day's costars, actor [[Louis Jourdan]], maintained that Day herself disliked her husband,<ref>{{Citation | title = Doris Day's Vanishing Act | author-link = David Kaufman (author)| first = David | last = Kaufman | journal = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | month = May | year = 2008 | page = 260}}</ref> but Day's public statements regarding Melcher appear to contradict that assertion.{{Sfn | Hotchner | p = 226}}

===2000s===
In 2000, Day received the Ohio Medal of Honor, that state's highest civilian award.  In 2006, Day recorded a commentary for the DVD release of the fifth (and final) season of her television show. Day has participated in telephone interviews with a radio station that celebrates her birthday with an annual Doris Day music marathon. In July 2008, she appeared on the Southern California radio show of longtime friend, newscaster [[George Putnam (newsman)|George Putnam]], reported in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Day turned down a tribute offer from the [[American Film Institute]] and from the Kennedy Center Honors because they require attendance in person. In 2004, Day was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[George W. Bush]] for her achievements in the entertainment industry and for her work on behalf of animals. President Bush stated, "It was a good day for our fellow creatures when she gave her good heart to the cause of animal welfare."<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.ddal.org/about/dorisday/ | title = Doris Day | type = profile | publisher = DDAL}}</ref> Day declined to attend the ceremony because of her [[fear of flying]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Fear of flying keeps Doris Day grounded|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/06/24/tem_people24day.html|accessdate=August 8, 2013|newspaper=Enquirer|date=June 24, 2004}}</ref>

===2010s===
Day released ''[[My Heart (Doris Day album)|My Heart]]'' in the United Kingdom on September 5, 2011, her first new album in nearly two decades, since the release of ''[[The Love Album (Doris Day album)|The Love Album]]'', which, although recorded in 1967, was not released until 1994. The album is a compilation of previously unreleased recordings produced by Day's son, Terry Melcher, before his death in 2004. Tracks include the 1970s [[Joe Cocker]] hit "[[You Are So Beautiful]]", the [[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]]' "[[Disney Girls (1957)|Disney Girls]]" and jazz standards such as "[[My Buddy (song)|My Buddy]]", which Day originally sang in her 1951 film ''I'll See You in My Dreams''. Day dedicates this song to her son. The disc was released in the US via City Hall Records on December 6, and within two weeks had climbed to No. 12 on Amazon's best-seller list in spite of being priced over 25% higher than most CDs to raise funds for the [[Doris Day Animal League]]. It debuted at 135 on the Billboard 200, Day's first entry on that chart since 1963's ''[[Love Him (album)|Love Him]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/464665/weekly-chart-notes-doris-day-gloria-estefan-selena-gomez |title=Weekly Chart Notes: Doris Day, Gloria Estefan, Selena Gomez&nbsp;– Chart Beat|publisher=Billboard |accessdate= April 4, 2012}}</ref>

===Marriages===
In 1975, Day released her autobiography, ''Doris Day: Her Own Story'', an "as-told-to" work with [[A. E. Hotchner]]. The book detailed her first three marriages:
* To Al Jorden, a trombonist whom she first met when he was in Barney Rapp's Band, from March 1941 to 1943. Her only child, son [[Terry Melcher|Terrence "Terry" P. Jorden]], resulted from this marriage. Husband Jorden, who was reportedly physically abusive to Day, committed suicide in 1967 by gunshot.
* To [[George William Weidler|George Weidler]] (a saxophonist), from March 30, 1946 to May 31, 1949. Weidler, the brother of actress [[Virginia Weidler]], and Day met again several years later. During a brief reconciliation, he helped introduce her to Christian Science.
* To [[Martin Melcher]], whom she married on April 3, 1951. This marriage lasted until Melcher's death in 1968. Melcher adopted Day's son Terry, who, with the name [[Terry Melcher]], became a successful musician and record producer.<ref>{{cite news|title=Producer Terry Melcher Dies at 62|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/65546/producer-terry-melcher-dies-at-62|accessdate=August 8, 2013|newspaper=Billboard}}</ref> Martin Melcher produced many of Day's movies. She and Melcher were both practicing [[Christian Scientist]]s, resulting in her not seeing a doctor for some time after symptoms that suggested cancer. This distressing period ended when finally consulting a physician and, finding the lump was benign, she fully recovered. After publishing her autobiography, Day married one last time.
* Her fourth and latest marriage was to Barry Comden (born March 30, 1935&nbsp;– died May 25, 2009),<ref name=ComdenDeath>{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Valerie J.|title=Barry Comden dies at 74; restaurateur was 4th husband of Doris Day|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/02/local/me-barry-comden2|accessdate=August 8, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 2, 2009}}</ref> who was roughly a decade younger, from April 14, 1976, until 1981. Comden was the ''[[maître d'hôtel|maitre d']]'' at one of Day's favorite restaurants. Knowing of her great love of dogs, Comden endeared himself to Day by giving her a bag of meat scraps and bones on her way out of the restaurant. When this marriage unraveled, Comden complained that Day cared more for her "animal friends" than she did for him.<ref name="ComdenDeath"/>

==Animal welfare activism==
Day's interest in animal welfare and related issues apparently dates to her teen years. While recovering from an automobile accident, she took her dog Tiny for a walk without a leash. Tiny ran into the street and was killed by a passing car. Day later confessed guilt and loneliness about Tiny's untimely death. In 1971, she co-founded Actors and Others for Animals and appeared in a series of newspaper advertisements denouncing the wearing of fur, alongside [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Angie Dickinson]], and [[Jayne Meadows]].{{Sfn | Patrick | McGee | 2006 | p = 132 | ps =, photograph of ad.}} Day's friend, [[Cleveland Amory]], wrote about these events in {{Citation | title = Man Kind? Our Incredible War on Wildlife | year = 1974}}.

In 1978, Day founded her own Doris Day Pet Foundation, now the [[Doris Day Animal Foundation]].<ref name="Grudens2001">{{cite book|last=Grudens|first=Richard|title=Sally Bennett's Magic Moments|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R6M6S4t4ejcC&pg=PA115|accessdate=August 8, 2013|date=January 1, 2001|publisher=Celebrity Profiles Publilshing|isbn=978-1-57579-181-4|page=115}}</ref> A non-profit 501(c)(3) grant-giving public charity, DDAF funds other non-profit causes throughout the US that share DDAF's mission of helping animals and the people who love them. The Doris Day Animal Foundation continues to operate independently under Day's personal supervision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dorisdayanimalfoundation.org/about.html |title=About DDAF |publisher=Doris Day Animal Foundation |date= |accessdate= July 30, 2013}}</ref>

To complement the Doris Day Animal Foundation, Day formed the [[Doris Day Animal League]] in 1987, a national non-profit citizen's lobbying organization whose mission is to reduce pain and suffering and protect animals through legislative initiatives.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul: Stories about Pets as Teachers, Healers, Heroes, and Friends|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QIPdhSiMN48C&pg=PA385|accessdate=August 8, 2013|year=1998|publisher=HCI Books|isbn=978-1-55874-571-1|page=385}}</ref> Day actively lobbied the United States Congress in support of legislation designed to safeguard [[animal welfare]] on a number of occasions and in 1995 originated the annual [[Spay Day USA]]. The Doris Day Animal League merged into [[Humane society|The Humane Society]] of the United States in 2006.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/06/AR2006090601770.html | title = Merger Adds To Humane Society's Bite | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] | accessdate = June 5, 2007}}</ref> Staff members of DDAL took positions within The HSUS, and Day recorded public service announcements for the organization. The HSUS now manages '''World Spay Day''', the annual one-day spay/neuter event that Day originated.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.hsus.org/about_us/accomplishments/history/hsus_and_doris_day_animal_league.html | title = Humane Society and Doris Day | publisher = [[Humane society]] | location = [[United States|US]] | accessdate = June 5, 2007}}{{dead link|date=March 2012}}.</ref>

A facility to help abused and neglected horses opened in 2011 and bears her name&nbsp;— the Doris Day Horse Rescue and Adoption Center, located in [[Murchison, Texas]], on the grounds of an animal sanctuary started by her late friend, author [[Cleveland Amory]].<ref name="Patrick-Goudreau2011">{{cite book|last=Patrick-Goudreau|first=Colleen|title=Vegan's Daily Companion: 365 Days of Inspiration for Cooking, Eating, and Living Compassionately|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZNN8Cgwmj3kC&pg=PA49|accessdate=August 8, 2013|date=March 1, 2011|publisher=Quarry Books|isbn=978-1-61058-015-1|page=49}}</ref> Day contributed $250,000 toward the founding of the center.<ref>{{Cite web | author = Di Paola, Mike | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aVpJWv4TlTrA | title = Doris Day Center Gives Abused Horses Sanctuary with Elands, Emu| publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] | date = March 30, 2011 | accessdate = August 3, 2013}}</ref>
