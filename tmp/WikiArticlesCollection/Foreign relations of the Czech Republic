{{Politics of the Czech Republic}}
Until the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989, the foreign policy of [[Czechoslovakia]] had followed that of the [[Soviet Union]]. Since the revolution and the subsequent mutually-agreed [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|peaceful dissolution]] of Czechoslovakia into the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], the [[Czechs]] have made integration with Western institutions their chief foreign policy objective. This goal was rapidly met with great success, as the nation joined [[NATO]] in 1999 and the European Union in 2004, and held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency of the European Union]] during the first half of 2009.

==Participation in international organizations==
The Czech Republic participates in the [[United Nations]] (UN); [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO); [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF); [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD); [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA); North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the [[International Whaling Commission]].

Fundamental to this objective is Czech membership in the European Union. The Czech Republic became a member of the EU in May 2004. This followed signature of the Treaty of Accession with nine other candidate nations in 1993. Although there have been disagreements with established EU member nations over some economic issues, such as agricultural quotas and a recent{{When|date=November 2010}} amendment to the gaming law, relations are good.

The Czech Republic is a member of the United Nations and participates in its specialized agencies. It is a member of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]]. It maintains diplomatic relations with more than 85 countries, of which 63 have permanent representation in Prague. The Czech Republic became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, along with Poland and Hungary, on 12 March 1999. This membership represents a milestone in the country's foreign policy and security orientation.

==International disputes==
{{update|date=November 2010}}

===Liechtenstein===
Liechtenstein claims restitution for {{convert|1600|km2|abbr=on}} (which is ten times the size of Liechtenstein) of land in the Czech Republic confiscated from its princely family in 1918 by the then newly established state of Czechoslovakia, the predecessor of the Czech Republic; the Czech Republic insists that the power to claim restitution does not go back before February 1948, when the Communists seized power; Liechtenstein did not diplomatically recognize the Czech Republic until 2009, and the Czech Republic in turn did not diplomatically recognize Liechtenstein.

On 13 July 2009 the Czech Republic and Liechtenstein established diplomatic relations.<ref name="Liechtenstein1">{{cite web |title=Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic establish diplomatic relations |url=http://88.82.102.51/fileadmin/_pm.liechtenstein.li/en/090713_PM_Beziehungen_CzFl_en.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Government Spokesperson's Office, the Principality of Liechtenstein |date=13 July 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref><ref name="Liechtenstein2">{{cite web |title=Navázání diplomatických styků České republiky s Knížectvím Lichtenštejnsko |url=http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/cz/udalosti_a_media/prohlaseni_a_stanoviska/x2009_07_13_lilchtejnstejnsko_navazani_diplomatickych_vztahu.html |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic]] |language=Czech |date=13 July 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091213011215/http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/cz/udalosti_a_media/prohlaseni_a_stanoviska/x2009_07_13_lilchtejnstejnsko_navazani_diplomatickych_vztahu.html |archivedate=13 December 2009}}</ref>

==Placement of US National Missile Defense base==
In February 2007, the US started formal negotiations with Czech Republic and Poland concerning construction of missile shield installations in those countries for a Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6704669.stm | title = Europe diary: Missile defence |publisher=BBC News | date = 31 May 2007 | first = Mark | last = Mardell | authorlink = Mark Mardell}}</ref> Government of the Czech Republic agrees (while 67% Czechs disagree and only about 22% support it)<ref>{{Cite press release | url = http://www.cvvm.cas.cz/upl/zpravy/100761s_pm80306.pdf | trans_title = Citizens on U.S. Anti-Missile Radar Base in Czech Republic | title = Občané o americké radarové základně v ČR | format = PDF | language = Czech | publisher=Centrum pro výzkum veřejného mínění | date = 6 March 2008}}</ref> to host a missile defense radar on its territory while a base of missile interceptors is supposed to be built in Poland.

The main government supporter [[Alexandr Vondra]], Deputy Prime Minister for European affairs, used to be an ambassador to the USA. More problematic is that between 2004 and 2006 he was an executive director of a lobbying company Dutko Worldwide Prague. Dutko's and its strategic partner AMI Communications (PR company) customers are Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Nortrop Grumman, which are largest contractors for NMD development.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nenasili.cz/cs/2026_kdo-prosazuje-radar-v-cr | title = Kdo prosazuje radar v ČR? | publisher=Hnutí Nenásilí | date = 16 October 2008 | language = Czech}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.greenpeace.org/czech/protiraketova-obrana/protiraketova_lobby | title = Protiraketová lobby v USA a České republice | publisher=[[Greenpeace]] | language = Czech}}</ref> AMI Communications also received (without a formal selection procedure) a government contract to persuade Czechs to support US radar base.
