'''Alfonso XIII''' (Spanish: ''Alfonso León Fernando María Jaime Isidro Pascual Antonio de Borbón y Habsburg-Lorena''; English: ''Alphonse Leon Ferdinand Mary James Isidor Pascal Anthony of [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] and [[Habsburg-Lorraine]]''; 17 May 1886 –  28 February 1941) was [[List of Spanish monarchs|King of Spain]]  from 1886 until 1931.

Alfonso was monarch from birth, as his father [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]] had died the previous year. Until his 16th birthday in 1902, his mother, [[Maria Christina of Austria]], served as his regent, in a period which saw Spain lose its Caribbean and Pacific colonies during the [[Spanish-American War]]. Due to family ties to both sides,<ref>His wife was English, his mother Austrian, amongst other family relationships.</ref> Alfonso kept his kingdom neutral in [[World War I]] (1914–1918).

From 1923 to 1930, Alfonso supported the dictator [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]. In 1931, in the face of overwhelming popular rejection, Alfonso fled the country as
the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed. In exile, he retained his claim to the throne until 1941, when he abdicated in favor of his son [[Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona|Juan]]. He died six weeks later.

==Reign==

===Birth and regency===
[[File:Royal Monogram of King Alfonso XIII of Spain.svg|thumb|120px|Royal Monogram]]
[[File:Alfonso13pts20 1899.jpg|thumb|left|200px|As he was born King, early coins from Alfonso's reign, such as this 20 pesetas from 1889, featured his portrait as a baby.]]
Alfonso was born in [[Madrid]] on 17 May 1886. He was the posthumous son of [[Alfonso XII of Spain]], who had died in November 1885, and became King of Spain upon his birth. The French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' described the young king as "the happiest and best-loved of all the rulers of the earth".<ref>"The Happiest Living Monarch", ''New York Times.'' 14 August 1889.</ref> His mother, [[Maria Christina of Austria]], served as his regent until his 16th birthday. During the regency, in 1898, Spain lost its colonial rule over [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] as a result of the [[Spanish-American War]].

When he came of age in 1902, the week of his majority was marked by festivities, bullfights, balls and receptions throughout Spain.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C06E2D9103BE733A2575AC2A9659C946397D6CF&scp=101&sq=Alfonso+XIII&st=p "Alfonso's Reign Begins on 17 May; He Will Take the Oath on That Day – Festivities to Last a Week,"] ''New York Times,'' 29 March 1902.</ref>

===Engagement and marriage===
[[File:Atentado en la calle Mayor..jpg|thumb|left|200px|Photograph taken moments after the assassination attempt on Alfonso and [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] on their wedding day.]]
By 1905, Alfonso was looking for a suitable consort. On a state visit to the [[United Kingdom]], he stayed at [[Buckingham Palace]] with King [[ of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]. There he met [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]], the [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born daughter of Edward's youngest sister [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice]], and a granddaughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. He found her attractive, and she returned his interest. There were obstacles to the marriage. Victoria was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]], and would have to become a Catholic. Victoria's brother Leopold was a [[haemophilia]]c, so there was 50% chance that Victoria was a carrier of the trait. Finally,  Alfonso's mother Maria Christina wanted him to marry a member of her family, the [[House of Habsburg]].

Victoria was willing to change her religion, and her being a haemophilia carrier was only a possibility. Maria Christina was eventually persuaded to drop her opposition. In January 1906 she wrote an official letter to Princess Beatrice proposing the match. Victoria met Maria Christina and Alfonso in [[Biarritz]], [[France]], later that month, and converted to Catholicism in [[San Sebastián]] in March.

In May, diplomats of both kingdoms officially executed the agreement of marriage. Alfonso and Victoria were married at the [[San Jerónimo el Real|Royal Monastery of San Jerónimo]] in Madrid on 31 May 1906, with British royalty in attendance, including Victoria's cousins the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. The wedding was marred by an assassination attempt on Alfonso and Victoria by Catalan [[anarchist]] [[Mateu Morral]]. As  the wedding procession returned to the palace, he threw a bomb from a window which killed or injured several bystanders and members of the procession.<ref>http://edwardianpromenade.com/weddings/royal-wedding-1-victoria-eugenie-alfonso-xiii/</ref>

On 10 May 1907, the couple's first child, [[Alfonso, Prince of Asturias (1907–1938)|Alfonso, Prince of Asturias]], was born. However, Victoria was in fact a haemophilia carrier, and Alfonso inherited the condition. He bled continuously for many hours after his [[circumcision]].

Neither of the two daughters born to the King and Queen were haemophilia carriers, but another of their sons, [[Gonzalo of Spain|Gonzalo]] (1914-1934), had the condition. Alfonso distanced himself from his Queen for transmitting the condition to their sons.<ref>http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2002/339/1018871276.html</ref>

From 1914 on, he had several mistresses, and fathered five illegitimate children. (A sixth illegitimate child was born before his marriage.)

===World War I===
During the [[World War I]], because of his family connections with both sides and the division of popular opinion, Spain remained neutral. The King established an office for assistance to prisoners of war on all sides. This office used the Spanish diplomatic and military network abroad to intercede for thousands of POWs - transmitting and receiving letters for them, and other services. The office was located in the [[Palacio Real|Royal Palace]].

Alfonso became gravely ill during the [[1918 flu pandemic]]. Spain was neutral and thus under no wartime censorship restrictions, so his illness and subsequent recovery were reported to the world, while flu outbreaks in the belligerent countries were concealed. This gave the false impression that Spain was the most-affected area and led to the pandemic being dubbed "the Spanish Flu."<ref name="Barry">Barry 171.</ref>

===Rif War and Primo de Rivera===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09411, Primo de Rivera und der König von Spanien.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Alfonso (left) in 1930 with his dictatorial Prime Minister, [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]].]]
Following World War I, Spain entered the lengthy yet successful [[Rif War]] (1920–1926) to preserve its colonial rule over northern Morocco. Critics of the monarchy thought the war was an unforgivable loss of money and lives, and nicknamed Alfonso ''el Africano'' ("the African").<ref>http://www.rebelion.org/noticia.php?id=28088</ref> In 1923, General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] seized power in a military coup. He ruled as a dictator with Alfonso's support until 1930. The poetic [[Generation of '27]] and Catalan and Basque nationalism grew in this era

===Second Republic and Civil War===
[[File:Timbre AlphonseXIII surcharge RepublEspanola.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Postage stamps featuring Alfonso XIII, such as this 1930 issue, were overprinted when the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was declared in 1931.]]

In 1930, due to economic problems and general unpopularity, Primo de Rivera resigned. Alfonso as Primo de Rivera's ally shared the popular dislike. In April 1931, General [[José Sanjurjo]] told him even the army was not loyal. On 12 April, the republican parties won a landslide victory in municipal elections. On 14 April, he fled the country as the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed, but did not abdicate. He settled eventually in [[Italy]], where he lived in Rome.

In 1933, his two eldest sons, Alfonson and Jaime, renounced their claims to the throne, and in 1934 his youngest son Gonzalo died. This left his third son Juan his only heir. Juan was the father of the current King, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]].

When the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, Alfonso made it clear he favored the "Nationalist" military rebels against the Republic. But in September 1936 the Nationalist leader, General [[Francisco Franco]], declared that the Nationalists would not restore Alfonso as King. (The Nationalist army included many [[Carlism|Carlist]] supporters of a rival pretender.)

Nevertheless, he sent his son Juan to Spain in 1936, to participate in the uprising. However, General [[Emilio Mola|Mola]] had Juan arrested near the French border and expelled from the country.

On 29 September 1936, upon the death of [[Infante Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime]] (also the Carlist pretender, but known to French [[legitimists]] as '''Charles XII'''), Alfonso also became the senior heir of [[Hugh Capet]] and so was hailed by legitimists as '''King Alphonse I of France and Navarre'''.

===Abdication and death===
On 15 January 1941, Alfonso XIII abdicated his rights to the Spanish throne in favor of Juan. He died in Rome on 28 February of that year.

In Spain, the dictator Franco ordered three days of national mourning.<ref>"Mourning in Spain", ''The Times'' (3 March 1941): 3.</ref>  His funeral was held in Rome in the Church of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri]].  Alfonso was buried in the Church of [[Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli]], the Spanish national church in Rome, immediately below the tombs of [[Pope Callixtus III]] and [[Pope Alexander VI]].<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30916FB3859167B93C0A91788D85F458485F9&scp=1&sq=Italians+to+Mourn+Death+of+Alfonso&st=p "Italians to Mourn Death of Alfonso,"] ''The New York Times.'' 2 March 1931.</ref> In January 1980 his remains were transferred to [[El Escorial]] in Spain.<ref>"21 Guns for Dead King's Homecoming", ''The Times'' (21 January 1980): 4.</ref>

==Interests==
[[File:Palace Hotel (Madrid) 03.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Madrid's [[Hotel Palace]] was built on Alfonso's wishes in 1912.]]
Alfonso was a promoter of tourism in Spain. The need for the lodging of his wedding guests prompted the construction of the luxury [[Hotel Palace]] in Madrid. He also supported the creation of a network of state-run lodges ([[Parador]]) in historic buildings of Spain. His fondness for the sport of [[Association football|football]] led to the patronage of several "Royal" ("Real" in Spanish) football clubs, the first being [[Real Club Deportivo de La Coruña]] in 1907.<ref>http://www.football-espana.net/clubs/Deportivo/history</ref> Selected others include [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[Real Sociedad]], [[Real Betis]], [[Real Unión]] and [[Real Zaragoza]].

==Marriage and children==
{{Main|Descendants of Alfonso XIII of Spain}}

On 31 May 1906, Alfonso married [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] (1887–1969). A [[Serene Highness]] by birth, Ena, as she was known, was raised to [[Royal Highness]] status a month before her wedding to make the union equal.

Alfonso and Ena had six living children:
* [[Alfonso, Prince of Asturias (1907-1938)|Infante ''Alfonso'' Pío Cristino Eduardo Francisco Guillermo Carlos Enrique Fernando Antonio Venancio of Spain]], [[Prince of Asturias]] (1907–1938). A haemophiliac, he renounced his rights to the throne in 1933 to marry a commoner, [[Edelmira Sampedro y Robato|Edelmira Ignacia Adriana Sampedro-Robato]], and became Count of [[Covadonga]]. He later remarried to [[Marta Esther Rocafort-Altuzarra]], but had no issue by either of them.
* [[Infante Jaime of Spain, Duke of Segovia|Infante ''Jaime'' Leopoldo Isabelino Enrique Alberto Alfonso Víctor Acacio Pedro María of Spain]] (1908–1975). A deaf-mute due to a botched childhood operation, he renounced his rights to the throne in 1933 and became Duke of [[Segovia]], and later Duke of Madrid. As a legitimist pretender to the French throne from 1941 to 1975, he was known as the Duke of [[Anjou]].
* [[Infanta Beatriz of Spain|Infanta ''Beatriz'' Isabela Federica Alfonsa Eugenia Cristina María Teresa Bienvenida Ladislaa of Spain]] (1909–2002), who married [[Alessandro Torlonia, 5th Prince of Civitella-Cesi]].
* Infante Fernando, [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] (1910)
* [[Infanta Maria Cristina of Spain|Infanta ''María Cristina'' Teresa Alejandra Guadalupe María de la Concepción Victoria Eugenia of Spain]] (1911–1996), who married Enrico Eugenio Marone-Cinzano, 1st Conte Marone-Cinzano.
* Infante [[Juan de Borbón, Count of Barcelona|Juan Carlos Teresa Silvestre Alfonso of Spain]] (1913–1993), heir-apparent to the throne 1941-1969, Count of Barcelona, and father of the current King, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]].
* [[Infante Gonzalo of Spain|Infante Gonzalo Manuel María Bernardo Narciso Alfonso Mauricio of Spain]] (1914–1934), a haemophiliac, like his elder brother Alfonso. He died due to bleeding from injuries suffered in a car crash.

==Illegitimate issue==
Alfonso also had six illegitimate children:

* [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]], 1930:  Emperor Showa's second brother, [[Prince Takamatsu]], traveled to Madrid to confer the Great Collar of the Chrysanthemum on King Alfonso.  This honor was intended, in part, to commemorate the diplomatic and trading history which existed long before other Western nations were officially aware of Japan's existence.  [[Prince Takamatsu]] traveled with his wife, [[Princess Takamatsu]], to Spain.  Her symbolic role in this unique mission to the Spanish Court was intended to emphasize the international links which were forged by her 16th-century ancestor, [[Ieyasu Tokugawa]].  In the years before the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], that innovative [[daimyo]] from Western Japan had been actively involved in negotiating trade and diplomatic treaties with Spain and with the colonies of New Spain (Mexico) and the Philippines; and it was anticipated that the mere presence of the Princess could serve to underscore the range of possibilities which could be inferred from that little-known history.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40B1EFE3D5C117A93C1A9178AD95F448385F9&scp=4&sq=order+of+the+chrysanthemum+&st=p "Japan to Decorate King Alfonso Today; Emperor's Brother Nears Madrid With Collar of the Chrysanthemum for Spanish King,"] ''New York Times,'' 3 November 1930; ''see also'' Nutail, Zelia.

==Media==
Alfonso XIII appears as "King Buby" in [[Luis Coloma]]'s story of [[Ratoncito Pérez]] (1894), which was written for the King when he was 8 years old. The story of Ratoncito Pérez has been adapted into further literary works and movies since then, with the character of Alfonso XIII appearing in some. Alfonso XIII is also mentioned on the plaque to Ratoncito Pérez on the second floor of "[[la calle del Arenal]]".
