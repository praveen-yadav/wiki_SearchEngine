'''Branchiopoda''' is a [[class (biology)|class]] of [[crustacean]]s. It comprises [[Anostraca|fairy shrimp]], [[clam shrimp]], [[Cladocera]], [[Notostraca]] and the Devonian ''[[Lepidocaris]]''. They are mostly small, freshwater animals that feed on plankton and detritus, with the exception of the Cladocera, many of which are marine.

==Description==
Members of the Branchiopoda are unified by the presence of [[gill]]s on many of the animals' [[appendage]]s, including some of the [[arthropod mouthparts|mouthparts]]. This is also responsible for the name of the group<ref>{{cite book |title=The animal kingdom: arranged after its organization, forming a natural history of animals, and an introduction to comparative anatomy |author=[[Georges Cuvier]] (trans.

==Ecology==
Among the branchiopods, only some [[cladocera]]ns are marine; all the other groups are found in continental waters [[freshwater|fresh water]], including [[vernal pool|temporary pools]] and salt lakes.<ref>{{cite book |author=Sol Felty Light |title=Intertidal invertebrates of the central California coast |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-520-00750-5 |chapter=Phylum Arthropoda |pages=112–210}}</ref> Most branchiopodans eat floating [[detritus]] or [[plankton]], which they take using the [[seta]]e on their appendages.<ref name="Hyman"/>

==Taxonomy==
In early taxonomic treatments, the current members of the Branchiopoda were all placed in a single genus, ''Monoculus''. The taxon Branchiopoda was erected by [[Pierre André Latreille]] in 1817, initially at the [[taxonomic rank|rank]] of [[Order (biology)|order]].<ref>{{cite book |series=The animal kingdom arranged in conformity with its organization |volume=3 |title=The Crustacea, Arachnides and Insecta |author=[[Pierre André Latreille]] |editor=[[Georges Cuvier]] |translated=Henry M'Murtrie |publisher=G. & C. & H.

===Laevicaudata, Spinicaudata and Cyclestherida===
{{main|Clam shrimp}}
Clam shrimp are bivalved animals which have lived since at least the [[Devonian]]. The three groups are not believed to form a [[clade]]. They have 10–32 trunk segments, decreasing in size from front to back, and each bears a pair of [[arthropod leg|legs]] which also carry [[gill]]s. A strong muscle can close the two halves of the shell together.

The [[fossil record]] of branchiopods extends back at least into the [[Upper Cambrian]] and possibly further.
