'''Ann Noreen Widdecombe''', [[Order of St. Gregory the Great|DSG]] (born 4 October 1947) is a former British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician and has been a novelist since 2000.   She is a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillor]] and was the Member of Parliament for [[Maidstone (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone]] from 1987 to 1997 and for [[Maidstone and The Weald (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone and The Weald]] from 1997 to 2010. She was a [[social conservative]] and a member of the [[Conservative Christian Fellowship]]. She retired from politics at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]]. Since 2002 she has also made numerous television and radio appearances, including as a television presenter. She is a convert from [[Anglicanism]] to Roman Catholicism.

As an MP, Widdecombe was known for opposing the legality of abortion and supporting the re-introduction of the [[death penalty]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Bath, Somerset]], Widdecombe is the daughter of Rita Noreen (née Plummer; 1911-2007) and [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] civil servant James Murray Widdecombe. Widdecombe's maternal grandfather, James Henry Plummer, was born to an [[Irish Catholic]] family of English descent in [[Crosshaven]], [[County Cork]] in 1874. She attended the Royal Naval School in [[Singapore]],<ref name="BBCRet">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7032992.stm Ann Widdecombe set to stand down]; ''[[BBC News]]'', 7 October 2007</ref> and La Sainte Union [[Convent]] School in Bath.<ref name=AboutAnn>{{cite web|url=http://www.annwiddecombe.com/text.aspx?id=52|title=About Ann|publisher=annwiddecombe.com|accessdate=8 October 2009}}</ref> She then read [[Latin]] at [[Birmingham University]] and later attended [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]], to read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE). She worked for [[Unilever]] (1973–75) and then as an administrator at the [[University of London]] (1975–87) before entering Parliament.<ref name=AboutAnn />

===Councillor===
From 1976 to 1978, Widdecombe was a  [[councillor]] for [[Runnymede (borough)|Runnymede District]] in Surrey.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/nov/03/uk.conservatives|title=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/nov/03/uk.conservatives|date=3 November 2003|work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |accessdate=6 December 2008  | first=Jackie | last=Ashley}}</ref> She contested the seat of [[Burnley (UK Parliament constituency)|Burnley]] in Lancashire in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]] and then,  against [[David Owen]], the [[Plymouth Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Devonport]] seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge79/i04.htm|title=UK General Election results May 1979|date=3 May 1979|work=Political Science Resources|publisher=Richard Kimber|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060925040210/http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge79/i04.htm|archivedate=25 September 2006|accessdate=16 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge83/i16.htm|title=UK General Election results June 1983|date=9 June 1983|work=Political Science Resources|publisher=Richard Kimber|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080320065802/http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge83/i16.htm|archivedate=20 March 2008|accessdate=16 November 2008}}</ref>

==Member of Parliament==
She was first elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]] as member for the constituency of [[Maidstone (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone]] (which became [[Maidstone and The Weald (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone and The Weald]] in 1997).<ref>[http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/guide/seat-profiles/maidstoneandtheweald Maidstone and The Weald], UKPollingReport</ref>

===Political views===
As an MP, Widdecombe expressed conservative views, including opposition to abortion; it was understood during her time in frontline politics that she would not become [[Secretary of State for Health|Health Secretary]] as long as this involved responsibility for abortions. Although a committed Christian, she has characterised the issue as one of life and death on which her view had been the same when she was agnostic.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/280692.stm|work=BBC News  | title=Ann Widdecombe answers your questions | date=16 February 1999 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> Along with [[John Gummer]] MP, she converted from the [[Church of England]] to the Roman Catholic Church following the decision of the Church of England on the [[Ordination of women]] as priests.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/112152.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Widdecombe rejects abortion role | date=13 June 1998 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> In her speech at the 2000 Conservative conference, she called for a [[zero tolerance]] policy of prosecution, albeit with only £100 fines as the punishment, for users of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. This was well received by rank-and-file Conservative delegates.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2000/oct/06/drugsandalcohol.conservatives2000|title=Widdecombe fights back firm|last=Watt|first=Nicholas|date=200–10–06|work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=22 August 2009 }}</ref>

In 2003, together with fellow Roman Catholic MP [[Edward Leigh]], Widdecombe proposed an amendment opposing repeal of [[Section 28]] of the [[Local Government Act 1988|Local Government Act]], which banned the promotion of homosexuality by local governments. Out of the 17 parliamentary votes considered by the [[Public Whip]] website to concern equal rights for homosexuals, Widdecombe took the opposing position in 15 cases, not being present at the other two votes.<ref>[http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?mpid=1701&dmp=826 "Ann Widdecombe compared to 'Homosexuality – Equal rights'"], [[Public Whip]]. Retrieved on 24 June 2009.</ref>

She is a committed animal lover and one of the few Conservative MPs to have consistently voted for the ban on [[fox hunting]].<ref>[http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?mpid=1701&dmp=1050 "Ann Widdecombe compared to 'Fox hunting – Ban'"], [[Public Whip]]. Retrieved on 21 March 2009.</ref>

She has expressed a variety of views on [[climate change]] but has been opposed to legislation reducing emissions. Her views on the subject appear to have hardened over time. In 2007, she wrote that she did not want to belittle the issue but was sceptical of the claims that specific actions would prevent catastrophe,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/2489/Switching-lightbulbs-won-t-save-the-world |title=Switching Lightbulbs won't change the world |publisher=Express.co.uk |date=21 March 2007 |accessdate=26 August 2011}}</ref> then in 2008 that her doubts had been “crystalised” by Nigel Lawson's book ''[[An Appeal to Reason]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/ourcomments/view/48856 |title=Yes, I am a heretic on global warming |publisher=Express.co.uk |date=18 June 2008 |accessdate=26 August 2011}}</ref> before stating in 2009 that "There is no climate change, hasn’t anybody looked out of their window recently?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/79580/Now-the-EU-wants-to-ban-your-plasma-television |title=Article including refutation of any global warming |publisher=Express.co.uk |date=12 January 2009 |accessdate=26 August 2011}}</ref> In 2011 she expressed the view that "climate change money should go to armed services".<ref name="Express">{{cite web | url=http://www.express.co.uk/ourcomments/view/262765 | title=Climate change money should go to armed services |publisher=[[Daily Express]] |year=2011 |accessdate=October 9, 2012}}</ref>

Over the years, Widdecombe has expressed her support for a reintroduction of the death penalty, which was abolished in the UK in 1965. She notably spoke of her support for its reintroduction for the worst cases of murder in the aftermath of the [[Soham Murders|murder of two 10-year-old girls]] from [[Soham]], Cambridgeshire, in August 2002. She supported the argument that the death penalty would have deterrent value, as within five years of its abolition the national murder rate had more than doubled.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2204738.stm |title=UK &#124; Politics &#124; Death penalty call renewed |publisher=BBC News  |date=21 August 2002 |accessdate=26 August 2011}}</ref>

===In government===
Widdecombe joined [[John Major]]'s government as [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] for Social Security in 1990. In 1993, she was moved to the [[Department of Employment]], and she was promoted to [[Minister of State]] the following year. In 1995, she joined the [[Home Office]] as Minister of State for Prisons and visited every prison in Britain.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/talking_politics/104160.stm|title=Ann Widdecombe – political sketch |publisher=BBC Online |accessdate=17 June 2009 |date=2 June 1998 |location=London}}</ref>

===Shadow Cabinet===
After the fall of the Conservative government to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] in 1997, she served as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Health|Shadow Health Secretary]] between 1998 and 1999 and later as [[Shadow Home Secretary]] between 1999 and 2001 under [[William Hague]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/person/5516/ann-widdecombe|title=Ann Widdecombe: Electoral history and profile|work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=22 August 2009 }}</ref>

===Leadership contest and backbenches===
During the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2001|2001 Conservative leadership election]], she could not find sufficient support amongst Conservative MPs for her leadership candidacy. She first supported [[Michael Ancram]], who was eliminated in the first round, and then [[Kenneth Clarke]], who lost in the final round. She afterwards declined to serve in [[Shadow Cabinet of Iain Duncan Smith|Iain Duncan Smith's Shadow Cabinet]] (although she indicated on the television programme ''[[When Louis Met...]]'', prior to the leadership contest, that she wished to retire to the [[backbenches]] anyway).

In the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005|2005 leadership election]], she initially supported Kenneth Clarke again. Once he was eliminated, she turned support towards [[Liam Fox]]. Following Fox's subsequent elimination, she took time to reflect before finally declaring for [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]]. She expressed reservations over the eventual winner [[David Cameron]], feeling that he did not, like the other candidates, have a proven track record, and she was later a leading figure in parliamentary opposition to his A-List policy, which she has said is "an insult to women".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1221684/David-Cameron-risks-fury-Tory-grass-roots-plans-women-shortlists.html |title=Cameron cuties: Tory anger as leader calls for all-women MP shortlists |work=Daily Mail | location=London | first=Jason | last=Groves | date=21 October 2009}}</ref> At the October 2006 Conservative Conference, she was Chief Dragon in a political version of the television programme ''[[Dragons' Den]]'', in which A-list candidates were invited to put forward a policy proposal, which was then torn apart by her team of [[Rachel Elnaugh]], [[Oliver Letwin]] and [[Michael Brown (UK politician)|Michael Brown]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Iain Dale |url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/iain_dale/2006/10/when_youve_got_nothing_to_writ.html |title=Taking the media beast to the dragon's den at guardian.co.uk |publisher=Commentisfree.guardian.co.uk |accessdate=26 August 2011 |location=London |date=3 October 2006}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]'' in September 2006 she stated that if Parliament were of a normal length, it was likely she would retire at the next general election.<ref>{{cite news |author=Andrew Williams |title=60 Seconds: Ann Widdecombe |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/interviews/article.html?in_article_id=19578&in_page_id=11 |work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] |date=11 September 2006 |accessdate=6 September 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070926225229/http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/interviews/article.html?in_article_id=19578&in_page_id=11| archivedate= 26 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> She confirmed her intention to stand down to ''[[The Observer]]'''s Pendennis diary in September 2007,<ref name="Pendennis">{{cite news |author=Oliver Marre |title=Widdy knows the way to a man's heart |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/7days/story/0,,2160786,00.html |work=The Observer |location=London |date=2 September 2007 |accessdate=7 October 2007 }}</ref> and again in October 2007 after Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] quashed speculation of an autumn 2007 general election.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7032992.stm |work=BBC News  |title=Ann Widdecombe set to stand down | date=8 October 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>

Widdecombe was one of the 98 MPs who voted to keep their expense details secret.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1816072.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=How your MP voted on the FOI Bill |date=20 May 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |first1=Philippe |last1=Naughton |first2=Miles |last2=Costello}}</ref> When the expenses claims were [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|leaked]], however, Widdecombe was described by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as one of the "saints" amongst all MPs.<ref name=TGEx>{{cite news |title = MPs' expenses: The saints (Part i) |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5342811/MPs-expenses-The-saints-Part-i.html?image=5 |accessdate=21 June 2009 |date=18 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090521124714/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5342811/MPs-expenses-The-saints-Part-i.html?image=5| archivedate= 21 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In May 2009, following the resignation of [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]] as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]], it was reported that Widdecombe was gathering support for election as interim Speaker until the next general election.<ref>{{cite news |title=Speaker: Runners and riders|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8057450.stm |work=BBC   |date=21 May 2009 |accessdate=21 May 2009 |location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090521094143/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8057450.stm| archivedate= 21 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> On 11 June 2009, she confirmed her bid to be the Speaker.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8094377.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Ann Widdecombe seeks Speaker role | date=11 June 2009 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> She made it through to the second ballot but came last and was eliminated.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8111887.stm |title=Two left in Commons Speaker race |accessdate=22 June 2009 |date=22 June 2009 |publisher=BBC online |location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090622191726/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8111887.stm| archivedate= 22 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Widdecombe retired from politics at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]]. It was rumoured that she would be a Conservative candidate for [[Police and Crime Commissioner]] in 2012, but she refused. She has since spoken about her opposition to the Coalition Government and her surprise at not being given a peerage by [[David Cameron]].<ref name=chorley>[http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/04/15/ann-widdecombe-on-hating-the-coalition-doing-big-brother-and-her-rude-autobiography/ "Ann Widdecombe on hating the coalition, doing Big Brother and her rude autobiography" at blogs.independent.co.uk]</ref>

==Personal life and family==
Until her retirement at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], Widdecombe divided her time between her two homes – one in London and one in the village of [[Sutton Valence]], Kent, in her constituency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/w/ann-widdecombe |title=Ann Widdecombe at |publisher=Fantasticfiction.co.uk |accessdate=26 August 2011}}</ref> She sold both of these properties, however, upon deciding to retire at the next general election.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/regions/south_east/8288134.stm|title=An interview with Ann Widdecombe |last=Wharton|first=Craig|date=2 October 2009|work=The Politics Show|publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 October 2009 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/retirementproperty/3361350/Division-bell-rings-for-retiring-Ann-Widdecombe.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Division bell rings for retiring Ann Widdecombe | first=Nicola | last=Venning | date=21 May 2008}}</ref> She shared her home in London with her widowed mother, Rita Widdecombe, until Rita's death, on 25 April 2007, aged 95.<ref>Conservative MP's mother dies, aged 95.

She has never married nor had any children. In November 2007 on [[BBC Radio 4]] she described how a journalist once produced a profile on her with the assumption that she had had at least "one sexual relationship", to which Widdecombe replied: "Be careful, that's the way you get sued". When interviewer [[Jenni Murray]] asked if she had ever had a sexual relationship, Widdecombe laughed "it's nobody else's business".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/02/2007_45_tue.shtml |title=Ann Widdecombe on BBC "Woman's Hour" at |publisher=BBC  |accessdate=26 August 2011}}</ref> Widdecombe has a fondness for cats and has a section of her website devoted to all the pet cats with which she has shared her life.<ref>http://www.annwiddecombe.com/text.aspx?id=57</ref>

===Religious views===
Widdecombe is a practising [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]]. She converted in 1993 after leaving the [[Church of England]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7157409.stm|title=Tony Blair joins catholic church|publisher=bbconline|accessdate=17 June 2009 | date=22 December 2007 | location=London}}</ref> Her reasons for leaving the latter were many, as she explained to reporters from the ''[[New Statesman]]'':

:I left the Church of England because there was a huge bundle of straw. The ordination of women was the last straw, but it was only one of many. For years I had been disillusioned by the Church of England's compromising on everything. The Catholic Church doesn't care if something is unpopular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/religion/2010/07/catholic-church-religious|title=Ann Widdecombe – extended interview by Alyssa McDonald|work=New Statesman |location=UK|date=19 July 2010|accessdate=28 October 2010}}</ref>

In 2010, Widdecombe turned down an offer to be Britain's next ambassador to the [[Holy See]], being prevented from accepting by suffering a [[detached retina]].<ref name="Ann Widdecombe rules out Vatican appointment, The New Statesman, 2010">{{cite web|last=Crampton|first=Caroline|title=Ann Widdecombe rules out Vatican appointment|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/07/detached-retina-post-vatican|publisher=The New Statesman|accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref> She was made a Dame of the [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] for services to politics and public life on 31 January 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=21860 |title=Ann Widdecombe awarded papal honour |publisher=Independent Catholic News |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=2 February 2013}}</ref>

==Controversies==
In 1990, following the assassination of the Conservative politician [[Ian Gow]] by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), the [[Eastbourne by-election, 1990|Eastbourne by-election]] for his seat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] was won by the [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] [[David Bellotti]]. Upon the announcement, Widdecombe told the voters that the IRA would be "toasting their success".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2001/mar/20/profiles.parliament16 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Ann Widdecombe | date=20 March 2001 | accessdate=25 April 2010 | first=Andrew | last=Roth}}</ref>

In 1996, Widdecombe, as prisons minister, defended the Government's policy to shackle pregnant prisoners with handcuffs and chains when in hospital. Widdecombe told the Commons the restrictions were needed to prevent prisoners from escaping. "Some MPs may like to think that a pregnant woman would not or could not escape. Unfortunately this is not true. The fact is that hospitals are not secure places in which to keep prisoners, and since 1990, 20 women have escaped from hospitals"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chaining-women-backed-1323238.html|title=Chaining women backed|work=The Independent |location=London |date=10 January 1996 |accessdate=20 October 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101012143641/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chaining-women-backed-1323238.html| archivedate= 12 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2000/mar/18/fiction1|title=Hague's head girl|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=18 March 2000|accessdate=20 October 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100916011112/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2000/mar/18/fiction1| archivedate= 16 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 1997, during the Conservative leadership election of [[William Hague]], Widdecombe spoke out against [[Michael Howard]], under whom she had served when he was Home Secretary. She famously remarked "there is something of the night about him". The remark was considered to be extremely damaging to Howard, who was frequently satirised as a [[vampire]] thereafter.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/cartoons/stevebell/0,7371,1319967,00.html |title=Steve Bell cartoon at guardian.co.uk |work=Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=26 August 2011}}</ref> He came last in the poll. Howard went on to become party leader in 2003, however, and Widdecombe then stated, "I explained fully what my objections were in 1997 and I do not retract anything I said then. But this is 2005 and we have to look to the future and not the past."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/webchats/webchat.html?in_page_id=1868&in_article_id=343672 |title=Live chat with Tory Ann Widdecombe at |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |date=10 October 2002 |accessdate=26 August 2011}}</ref>

In 2001, when [[Michael Portillo]] was running for leader of the Conservative Party, Widdecombe described him and his allies as "backbiters". She went on to say that, should he be appointed leader, she would never give him her allegiance.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/>

She was the guest host of news quiz ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' twice, in 2006 and 2007. Following her second appearance, Widdecombe vowed she would never appear on the show again because of comments made by panellist [[Jimmy Carr]]. She wrote, "His idea of wit is a barrage of filth and the sort of humour most men grow out of in their teens.... [T]here's no amount of money for which I would go through those two recording hours again. At one stage I nearly walked out."<ref name="Carr's filth">Ann Widdecombe in the ''Daily Express'', as quoted by {{cite news |title=Widdecombe disgusted by Carr's 'filth' |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/mediamonkey/2007/11/widdecombe_disgusted_by_carrs.html |work=mediamonkey |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=28 November 2007 |accessdate=30 November 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071201081438/http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/mediamonkey/2007/11/widdecombe_disgusted_by_carrs.html| archivedate= 1 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> She did, however, stand by her appraisal of regular panellists [[Ian Hislop]] and [[Paul Merton]], whom she has called "the fastest wits in showbusiness".<ref name="Carr's filth"/>

Since 2007, Widdecombe has fronted a television [[Television season|series]] called ''Ann Widdecombe Versus'', on [[ITV1]], in which she speaks to various people about things related to her as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]], with an emphasis on confronting those responsible for problems she wished to tackle.

Widdecombe was eliminated from the competition on Sunday 5 December after the  public vote had been combined with the judges' score; she was with [[Scott Maslen]] of ''EastEnders'' in the bottom two.

Widdecombe is currently filming a new quiz show with herself as questionmaster, for the [[Sky Atlantic]] channel, called ''[[Cleverdicks]]''. The show is being shown in 30 one-hour episodes in an initial series, starting 2012.
