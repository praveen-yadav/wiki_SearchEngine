'''The Triumph of Time''' is a poem by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], published in 1866. It is in adapted [[ottava rima]] and is full of elaborate use of literary devices, particularly [[alliteration]]. The theme, which purports to be autobiographical, is that of rejected love. The (male) speaker deplores the ruin of his life, and in tones at times reminiscent of ''[[Hamlet]]'', craves oblivion, for which the sea serves as a constant metaphor.

'''''The Triumph of Time''''' is the US title of [[James Blish]]'s novel ''A Clash of Cymbals''.

A work for orchestra by the English composer [[Harrison Birtwistle]] is called '''''The Triumph of Time'''''. It is based on an allegorical painting by the sixteenth-century Flemish artist, [[Pieter Bruegel]]. Bruegel's picture shows the figure of Time riding in a cart surrounded by marauding bands of skeletons. The landscape is ravaged and the canvas is covered with manifold images of death. Birtwistle transfers these images to the present. We are invited to watch a slow funeral cortege as it passes us by. As spectators and listeners we are involved and yet uninvolved with the action at one and the same moment. Time is the inescapable mode of our existence and death our ultimate destination: thus we are involved. But there are moments when we can remove ourselves from the inevitability of time, moments when we can stand back from ourselves, moments when we can observe events with passive objectivity. The funeral cortege may be symbolic and activate our empathy or horror, but it may also be an event moving towards us and past us at a speed which allows us to contemplate only the gradual metamorphoses of visual planes. In other words, we are the observers of an event in slow motion.<ref>http://www.universaledition.com/Sir-Harrison-Birtwistle/composers-and-works/composer/64/work/5330/work_introduction</ref>
