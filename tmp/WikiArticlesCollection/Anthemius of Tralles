'''Anthemius of Tralles''' (c. 474 &ndash; before 558; {{lang-grc|Ἀνθέμιος ὁ Τραλλιανός}}) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] professor of [[Geometry]] in [[Constantinople]] and [[architect]], who collaborated with [[Isidore of Miletus]] to build the church of [[Hagia Sophia]] by the order of [[Justinian I]]. Anthemius came from an educated family, one of five sons of Stephanus of [[Aydın|Tralles]], a physician. Of his brothers, Dioscorus followed his father's profession in Tralles; Alexander became at [[Rome]] one of the most celebrated medical men of his time; Olympius was deeply versed in [[Roman law|Roman jurisprudence]]; and Metrodorus was a distinguished [[Philologist|grammarian]] in Constantinople.

As an architect he is best known for replacing the old church of [[Hagia Sophia]] at [[Constantinople]] in 532; his daring plans for the church strikingly displayed his knowledge. His skills seem also to have extended to engineering for he repaired the flood defences at [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Daras]].

Anthemius was also a capable mathematician. He described the string construction of the [[ellipse]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=|year=1991|chapter=Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics|pages=193|quote=The commentary by Eutocius on the ''Conics'' of [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]] was dedicated to Anthemius of Tralles (t534), an able mathematician and architect of St. Sophia of Constantinople, who described the string construction of the ellipse and wrote a work ''On Burning-mirrors'' in which the focal properties of the parabola are described.}} <br />Although Anthemius died not 534 but before 558, cf. [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]], p. 109.</ref> and he wrote a book on [[conic section]]s, which was excellent preparation for designing the elaborate vaulting of Hagia Sophia. He compiled a survey of mirror configurations in his work on remarkable mechanical devices which was known to [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematicians]] such as [[Alhazen|Ibn al-Haytham]].

A fragment of his treatise ''On burning-glasses'' was published as ''{{lang|grc|Περί παραδόξων μηχανημάτων}}'' ("Concerning wondrous machines") by L. Dupuy in 1777, and also appeared in 1786 in the forty-second volume of the ''Histoire de l'Academie des Instrumentistes''. A. Westermann gave a revised edition of it in his ''{{lang|grc|Παραδοξογράφοι}}'' (''Scriptores rerum mirabilium Graeci'', "Greek marvel-writers") in 1839. In the course of the constructions for surfaces to reflect to one and the same point
# all rays in whatever direction passing through another point,
# a set of parallel rays,
Anthemius assumes a property of an ellipse not found in Apollonius's work, that the equality of the angles subtended at a focus by two [[tangent]]s drawn from a point, and having given the focus and a double ordinate he goes on to use the focus and [[Directrix (conic section)|directrix]] to obtain any number of points on a [[parabola]]&mdash;the first instance on record of the practical use of the directrix.
