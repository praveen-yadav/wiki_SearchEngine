}}'''Bjarne Stroustrup''' ({{IPA-da|ˈbjɑːnə ˈsdʁʌʊ̯ˀsdʁɔb|lang}};<ref>[http://www.stroustrup.com/pronounciation.wav Bjarne Stroustrup pronounces his name]</ref> born 30 December 1950) is a Danish [[computer scientist]], most notable for the creation and the development of the widely used [[C++]] programming language. He is currently Professor and holder of the College of Engineering Chair in Computer Science at [[Texas A&M University]].<ref>[http://www.research.att.com/~bs/homepage.html Bjarne Stroustrup's Homepage]</ref><ref>{{cite doi| 10.1145/1629175.1629192}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi| 10.1109/MC.1998.683014}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1109/MC.2011.353}}</ref>

==Education==
Stroustrup has a [[master's degree]] in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] (1975) from [[Aarhus University]], [[Denmark]], and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in computer science (1979)<ref name="stroustrupphd">{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Bjarne|last=Stroustrup |title=Communication and control in distributed computer systems |publisher=University of Cambridge |date=1979 |url= http://ulmss-newton.lib.cam.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=14260|authorlink=Bjarne Stroustrup}}</ref> from the [[University of Cambridge]], England, where he was a student at [[Churchill College, Cambridge|Churchill College]]. His thesis advisor in Cambridge was [[David Wheeler (computer scientist)|David Wheeler]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stroustrup.com/bio.html|title=Stroustrup: Biographical Information}}</ref>

==Career==
Stroustrup began developing C++ in 1978 (then called "[[C (programming language)|C]] with Classes"), and, in his own words, "invented C++, wrote its early definitions, and produced its first implementation... chose and formulated the design criteria for C++, designed all its major facilities, and was responsible for the processing of extension proposals in the C++ standards committee."<ref>''The C++ Programming Language'', B. Stroustrup, p.10</ref> Stroustrup also wrote what many consider to be the standard textbook for the language, ''[[The C++ Programming Language]]''.

Stroustrup was the head of [[Bell Labs|AT&T Lab's]] Large-scale Programming Research department, from its creation until late 2002. Stroustrup was elected member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in 2004. He is a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] (1994) and an [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] Fellow. He currently works at [[Texas A&M University]], [[United States]], as a Distinguished Professor where he holds the College of Engineering Endowed Chair in [[Computer Science]].<ref>[http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bio.html Bjarne Stroustrup: Some Information about Bjorne Stroustrup.]</ref><ref>[http://www.cse.tamu.edu/people/faculty  Texas A&M CSE Department's Faculty Directory]</ref>
