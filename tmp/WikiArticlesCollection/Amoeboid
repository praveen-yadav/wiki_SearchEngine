</ref> and especially refer to a creature moving by using [[pseudopod]]ia.  Most references to "amoebas" or "amoebae" are to amoeboids in general rather than to the specific genus ''[[Amoeba]]''.  The genus ''Amoeba'' and amoeboids in general both derive their names from the ancient Greek word for change.

==Shape and structure==
Amoeboids [[Amoeboid movement|move using pseudopodia]], which are bulges of [[cytoplasm]].

Amoebas breathe using their entire [[cell membrane]] that is constantly immersed in water. Excess water can cross into the [[cytosol]]. Amoebas have a contractile [[vacuole]] to expel excess water.

Food sources vary in amoeboids. They may consume bacteria or other [[protist]]s. Some are [[detritivore]]s and eat dead organic material. They extend a pair of pseudopodia around food. They fuse to make a food vacuole which then fuses with a [[lysosome]] to add digestive chemicals. Undigested food is expelled at the cell membrane.

Amoebas use pseudopodia to move and feed. They are powered by flexible [[microfilament]]s near the membrane. Microfilaments are at least 50% of the [[cytoskeleton]]. The other parts are more stiff and are composed of [[intermediate filament]]s and [[microtubule]]s. These are not used in amoeboid movement, but are stiff skeletons on which [[organelles]] are supported or can move on.

The shells of amoebas are often composed of [[calcium]]. The proteins or materials are synthesised in the cell and exported just outside the cell membrane.

===Multicellular amoebas: Slime molds===
{{main|Slime mold}}
Amoebas seem to have connections with two phyla (now defunct) composed of [[multicellular organism]]s of the lineage of fungus-like protists, the so-called [[slime mold]]s. These two defunct phyla were the [[Myxomycota]] (i.e., plasmodial slime molds, now classified in the taxon [[Myxogastria]]), and [[Acrasiomycota]] (i.e. cellular slime molds, now divided into the taxa [[Acrasida]] and [[Dictyosteliida]]). These two phyla use amoeboid movement in their feeding stage. The former is basically a giant [[multinucleate]] amoeba, while the latter lives solitary until food runs out; in which a colony of these functions as a unit. Myxomycete slime molds use amoeboid gametes, as well.

==Diversity==
They have appeared in a number of different groups. Some cells in multicellular animals may be amoeboid, for instance human [[white blood cell]]s, which consume pathogens. Many [[protist]]s also exist as individual amoeboid cells, or take such a form at some point in their life-cycle. The most famous such organism is ''[[Amoeba|Amoeba proteus]]''; the name amoeba is variously used to describe its close relatives, other organisms similar to it, or the amoeboids in general.

==Classification==
As amoebas themselves are [[polyphyletic]] and subject to some imprecision in definition, the term "amoeboid" does not provide identification of an organism, and is better understood as description of locomotion.

When used in the broader sense, the term can include many different groups. One source includes 97 different genera.<ref name="urlThe Amoebae">{{cite web |url=http://www.bms.ed.ac.uk/research/others/smaciver/amoebae.htm |title=The Amoebae |work= |accessdate=2009-05-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090412100203/http://www.bms.ed.ac.uk/research/others/smaciver/amoebae.htm| archivedate= 12 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Others include far fewer.

===Older classification===
In older classification systems, amoeboids, under the taxon name '''Sarcodina''', had been divided into several [[Morphology_(biology)#Morphology_and_classification|morphological categories]] based on the form and structure of their [[pseudopod]]s.

Amoeboids with pseudopods supported by regular arrays of [[microtubule]]s were called '''actinopods''', whereas those that weren't were called '''rhizopods''', which were further subdivided into lobose, filose, and reticulose amoebae. In contrast to "rhizopods", where most of their morphologies can be mapped to modern classification systems, "actinopods" appear to be extensively [[polyphyletic]]. Actinopods are divided into [[radiolaria]] and [[heliozoa]] (itself a polyphyletic grouping).

Finally, there was also a strange group of giant marine amoeboids, the [[xenophyophore]]s, that did not fall into any of these categories.

===Modern classification===
More modern classifications are based upon [[cladistics]]. It has been stated that most amoeboid are now grouped in [[Amoebozoa]] or [[Rhizaria]].<ref name="pmid19335771">{{cite journal |author=Pawlowski J, Burki F |title=Untangling the phylogeny of amoeboid protists |journal=J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=16–25 |year=2009 |pmid=19335771 |doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.2008.00379.x}}</ref> However, in contexts where "amoeboid" is defined more loosely, there are many amoeboid species that are in the [[Excavata]] clade.

Phylogenetic analyses place these genera into the following groups (not all of these are considered amoeboid (or "amoebas") by all sources):

The naked filose amoebae also includes [[vampyrellid]]s.

* Reticulose pseudopods ([[Endomyxa]]): Reticulose pseudopods are cytoplasmic strands that branch and merge to form a net. They are found most notably among the [[Foraminifera]], a large group of marine protists that generally produce multi-chambered shells. There are only a few sorts of naked reticulose amoeboids, notably the [[gymnophryid]]s, and their relationships are not certain.

==Pathogenic interactions with other organisms==
Some amoeboids can infect other organisms [[pathogen]]ically (causing disease):

*''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'' is the cause of [[amoebiasis]], or ''amoebic dysentery''.
*''[[Naegleria fowleri]]'' (the "brain-eating amoeba") is a fresh-water-native species that can be fatal to humans if introduced through the nose.
*''[[Acanthamoeba]]'' can cause amoebic [[keratitis]] and [[encephalitis]] in humans.
*''[[Balamuthia mandrillaris]]'' is the cause of (often fatal) [[granulomatous amoebic meningoencephalitis]]
