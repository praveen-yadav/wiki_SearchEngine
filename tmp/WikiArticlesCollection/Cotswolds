The '''Cotswolds''' are a range of hills in southwestern and west-central England, an area {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} across and {{convert|90|mi|km|0}} long. The area has been designated as the Cotswold [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. The highest point in the Cotswolds range is [[Cleeve Hill]] at {{convert|1083|ft|m|0|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleevecommon.org.uk/200702/about-land.html|title=Landscape|publisher=Cleeve Common|accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref> {{convert|2.5|mi|km|0}} to the north of [[Cheltenham]].

The Cotswolds lie mainly within the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] of [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Oxfordshire]], but extend into parts of [[Wiltshire]], Somerset, [[Worcestershire]], and [[Warwickshire]]. The hills give their name to the [[Cotswold (district)|Cotswold]] local government district in Gloucestershire, which administers a large part of the area.

==Toponymy==
The name Cotswold is sometimes attributed the meaning, ''sheep enclosure in rolling hillsides'',<ref>{{cite web|title=The Kingscote, Gloucestershire area|url=http://www.kingscotepark.co.uk/index.asp?page=6913|publisher=Kingscote Park|accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=apcmAAAAMAAJ | title= ‪Local etymology: a derivative dictionary of geographical names‬ | first= Richard Stephen ‬ | last= Charnock | publisher= Houlston and Wright | year= 1859‬ | page= 76}}</ref> incorporating the term, ''[[The Wolds|wold]]'', meaning, woodland. The [[English Place-Name Society]] has for many years accepted that the term Cotswold is derived from ''Codesuualt'' of the twelfth century or other variations on this form, the etymology of which was given, 'Cod's-wold', which is 'Cod's high open land'.<ref>Smith, A. H. 1964 The Place-Names of Gloucestershire, part 1: The Rivers and Road-names, the East Cotswolds, Cambridge, p.2</ref> Cod was interpreted as an Old English personal name, which may be recognised in further names: [[Cutsdean]], Codeswellan, and Codesbyrig, some of which date back to the eighth century AD.<ref>Smith A. H. 1964 The Place-Names of Gloucestershire part 2: The North and West Cotswolds, Cambridge pp.7-8</ref> It has subsequently been noticed that "Cod" could derive philologically from a Brittonic female cogname "[[Cuda (goddess)|Cuda]]", which is the name of a [[mother goddess]] thought to have resided in the Cotswold region in [[Celtic mythology]].<ref>Yeates, S. J. 2008 The Tribe of Witches: The Religion of the Dobunni and the Hwicce pp.11-18</ref><ref>Yeates, S. J. 2006 River-Names, Celtic and Old English: their dual medieval and post-medieval personalities, Journal of the English Place-Name Society 38, pp.63-81</ref>

==Description==
{{wide image|Cotswolds Panorama Fields.jpg|780px|<center>Rolling hills and farm fields that typify the Cotswolds landscape</center>}}
The spine of the Cotswolds runs southwest to northeast through six counties, particularly Gloucestershire, west Oxfordshire, and south western Warwickshire. The northern and western edges of the Cotswolds are marked by steep [[escarpment]]s down to the [[River Severn|Severn valley]] and the [[River Avon (Warwickshire)|Warwickshire Avon]]. This escarpment or scarp feature, sometimes called the '''Cotswold Edge''', is a result of the uplifting (tilting) of the limestone layer, exposing its broken edge.<ref name="cotsstone">{{cite web|url=http://thecotswoldgateway.co.uk/cotswoldstone.htm|title=Cotswold Stone|publisher=Cotswold Gateway|accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref> This is a [[cuesta]], in geological terms. The [[dip slope]] is to the southeast. On the eastern boundary lies the city of [[Oxford]] and on the west is [[Stroud, England|Stroud]]. To the southeast, the upper reaches of the [[Thames Valley]] and towns such as [[Lechlade]], [[Tetbury]], and [[Fairford]] are often considered to mark the limit of this region. To the south the Cotswolds, with the characteristic uplift of the Cotswold Edge, reach beyond [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and towns such as [[Chipping Sodbury]] and [[Marshfield, Gloucestershire|Marshfield]] share elements of Cotswold character.

The area is characterised by attractive small towns and villages built of the underlying ''[[Cotswold stone]]'' (a yellow [[oolite|oolitic]] [[limestone]]).<ref name="cotsstone"/> This limestone is rich in [[fossil]]s, particularly of fossilised [[sea urchin]]s. In the [[Middle Ages]] the [[wool]] trade made the Cotswolds prosperous. Some of this money was put into the building of churches so the area has a number of large and handsome Cotswold stone "[[wool church]]es". The area remains affluent and has attracted wealthy people who own [[Vacation property|second homes]] in the area or have chosen to retire there.

Cotswold towns include [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], [[Broadway, Worcestershire|Broadway]], [[Burford]], [[Chipping Norton]], [[Cirencester]], [[Moreton-in-Marsh]], [[Northleach]], [[Stow-on-the-Wold]], [[Stroud]], and [[Winchcombe]].

The town of [[Chipping Campden]] is notable for being the home of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], founded by [[William Morris]] at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courtbarn.org.uk/history|title=History |publisher=Court Barn Museum|accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref> William Morris lived occasionally in [[Broadway Tower]], a folly, now part of a country park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldswebsite.com/broadway-tower.htm|title=Broadway Tower|publisher=Cotswold website|accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref> Chipping Campden also is known for the annual [[Cotswold Olimpick Games]], a celebration of sports and games dating back to the early seventeenth century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=862|title=Origins of Robert Dover's Games |publisher=Olympick Games|accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref>

==Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty==
[[Image:Cotswolds Cleeve Common.jpg|thumb|From Cleeve Common, near the highest point in the Cotswolds]]
The Cotswolds were designated as an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB) in 1966, with an expansion on 21 December 1990 to {{convert|1990|km2|sqmi|0}}. In 1991, all AONBs were measured again using modern methods. The official area of the Cotswolds AONB was increased to {{convert|2038|km2|sqmi|0}}. In 2000, the government confirmed that AONBs had the same landscape quality and status as [[National Parks]].<ref name="aonb">{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=AONB|title=AONB|publisher=Cotswolds AONB|accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref>
The Cotswolds AONB, which is the largest in England and Wales, stretches from the border regions of South Warwickshire and Worcestershire, through West Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire, and takes in parts of Wiltshire, [[Bath and North East Somerset|Bath, and north east Somerset]] in the South.
Gloucestershire County Council is responsible for sixty-three percent of the AONB.<ref>[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/aonb/cotswolds.aspx Cotswolds] ''[[Natural England]]''</ref>

The Cotswolds Conservation Board has the task of conserving and enhancing the AONB. Established under statute in 2004 as an independent public body, the Board carries out a range of work from securing funding for 'on the ground' conservation projects, to providing a strategic overview of the area for key decision makers, such as planning officials. The Board is funded by [[Natural England]] and the seventeen local authorities that are covered by the AONB.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=ccb|title=Cotswolds Conservation Board|publisher=Cotswolds AONB|accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref>

While the beauty of the Cotswolds AONB is intertwined with that of the villages that seem almost to grow out of the landscape, the Cotswolds were primarily designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] for the rare limestone grassland habitats as well as the old growth [[beech]] woodlands that typify the area. These habitat areas are also the last refuge for many other flora and fauna, with some so endangered that they are protected under the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]]. [[Cleeve Hill]], and its associated commons, is a fine example of a limestone grassland and it is one of the few locations where the [[Duke of Burgundy butterfly]] may still be found in abundance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Natural Areas - 55 Cotswolds|url=http://www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk/science/natural/NA_Details.asp?NA_Id=55|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref>

The uniqueness and value of the Cotswolds is shown in the fact that five European [[Special Area of Conservation|Special Areas of Conservation]], three [[National Nature Reserves in England|National Nature Reserves]] and more than eighty [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] are within the Cotswolds AONB.<ref>{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cotswold AONB|url=http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=aonb|publisher=Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty|accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref>

The [[Cotswold Voluntary Wardens]] Service, now part of the Cotswolds Conservation Board, was established in 1968 to help conserve and enhance the area and now has more than 300 wardens.

The [[Cotswold Way]] is a long-distance footpath, approximately {{convert|103|mi|km|0}} long, running the length of the AONB, mainly on the edge of the Cotswold escarpment with views over the [[Severn Valley (England)|Severn Valley]] and the Vale of [[Evesham]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/Cotswold/text.asp?PageId=2 | title= Cotswold Way&nbsp;— About this trail | work= National Trail | accessdate= 30 June 2007 }}</ref>

==Transport==
[[Image:Cotswold roads 1933.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map of Cotswolds roads from 1933]]
The Cotswolds lie between the [[M5 motorway|M5]], [[M40 motorway|M40]], and [[M4 motorway]]s. The main non-motorway roads through the area are the [[A46 road|A46]]: [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]&nbsp;– [[Stroud]]&nbsp;– [[Cheltenham]]; the [[A419 road|A419]]: [[Swindon]]&nbsp;– [[Cirencester]]&nbsp;– Stroud; the [[A429 road|A429]]: Cirencester&nbsp;– [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]&nbsp;– [[Moreton-in-Marsh]]; and the [[A40 road|A40]]: [[Oxford]]&nbsp;– [[Burford]]&nbsp;– Cheltenham. These all roughly follow the routes of ancient roads, some laid down by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]], such as [[Ermin Street]] and the [[Fosse Way]].

The area is bounded by two major rail routes: in the south by the main [[Great Western Main Line|Bristol–Bath–London High Speed line]] (including the [[South Wales Main Line]]) and in the west by the [[Cross Country Route|Bristol–Birmingham main line]]. In addition, the [[Cotswold Line]] runs through the Cotswolds from [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] to [[Worcester Shrub Hill|Worcester]], and the [[Golden Valley Line]] runs from Swindon via [[Stroud railway station|Stroud]] to [[Gloucester railway station|Gloucester]], carrying high speed and local services.

Mainline, high-speed rail services to the big cities run from stations such as [[Bath railway station|Bath]], [[Swindon railway station|Swindon]], [[Oxford]], [[Cheltenham Spa railway station|Cheltenham]], and [[Worcester Shrub Hill|Worcester]]. Mainline trains run by [[First Great Western]] to [[London Paddington]] also are available from [[Kemble railway station|Kemble station]] near Cirencester, [[Kingham railway station|Kingham station]] near Stow-on-the-Wold, [[Charlbury railway station|Charlbury station]], and [[Moreton-in-Marsh railway station|Moreton-in-Marsh station]].

Additionally, there is the [[Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway]], a steam heritage railway serving the Cotswolds from [[Cheltenham Racecourse railway station|Cheltenham]] to [[Winchcombe railway station|Winchcombe]] and [[Toddington railway station|Toddington]].

Cheltenham, which is located just West of the Cotswolds, is a hub for [[National Express Group|National Express]] coach services. There are local bus services across the area, but some are infrequent.

The [[River Thames]] flows from the Cotswolds and is navigable from [[Inglesham]] and Lechlade-on-Thames downstream to [[Oxford]].

==The Cotswolds in culture and the media==

The Cotswold region has inspired some of England's finest composers. In the early 1900s, [[Herbert Howells]] and [[Ivor Gurney]] used to go for long walks together over the hills and Gurney urged Howells to make the landscape, including the nearby [[Malvern Hills]], the inspiration for his future work. Accepting, and true to his word, in 1916, Howells wrote his first major piece, the Piano Quartet in A minor, inspired by the magnificent view of the [[Malvern Hills|Malverns]] - it was dedicated to "the hill at Chosen ([[Churchdown]]) and Ivor Gurney who knows it".<ref>[http://webspace.webring.com/people/th/hauntedtv/long_remembered_hills.htm  Long Remembered Hills] How the English composers Ivor Gurney and Herbert Howells were influenced by the Gloucestershire countryside.</ref> Another contemporary of theirs, [[Gerald Finzi]], lived in nearby [[Painswick]].

[[Gustav Holst]] titled his Symphony in F major, Op.8 H47 ''The Cotswolds''.
The composer Ralph Vaughan Williams composed his opera "Hugh the Drover" from 1913 to 1924, which depicts life in a Cotswold village and incorporates folk melodies derived from the area.
The film ''[[Better Things (film)|Better Things]]'', directed by Duane Hopkins, is set in a small Cotswold village. The fictional [[Agatha Raisin]] lives in the fictional village of Carsely in the Cotswolds. The [[Chipping Norton set]] are based in the Cotswolds.

In the television series [[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]] episode, [[A Hole in the World]], [[Angel]] and [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] go looking for the Deeper Well - the burial ground for the old ones of the demon age, and prepare to go speak with its guardian, [[Drogyn]].
