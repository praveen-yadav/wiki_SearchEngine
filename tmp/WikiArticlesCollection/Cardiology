'''Cardiology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|καρδίᾱ}}, ''kardiā'', "heart"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is a [[medical specialty]] dealing with disorders of the [[heart]] be it human or animal. The field includes [[medical diagnosis]] and treatment of [[congenital heart defect]]s, [[coronary artery disease]], [[heart failure]], [[valvular heart disease]] and [[electrophysiology]].  [[Physicians]] who specialize in this field of medicine are called '''cardiologists'''.  Physicians who specialize in cardiac surgery are called '''[[cardiac surgeon]]s'''.

== Specialization ==
Cardiology is a specialty of [[internal medicine]]. To be a cardiologist in the [[United States]], a three year residency in internal medicine is followed by a three year residency in cardiology. It is possible to specialize further in a sub-specialty. Recognized sub-specialties in the United States by the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|ACGME]] are:{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* [[Cardiac electrophysiology]] : Study of the electrical properties and conduction diseases of the heart.
* [[Echocardiography]] : The use of [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] to study the mechanical function/physics of the heart.
* [[Interventional cardiology]] : The use of [[catheter]]s for the treatment of structural and ischemic [[heart disease|diseases of the heart]].
* [[Nuclear cardiology]] : The use of [[nuclear medicine]] to visualize the uptake of an isotope by the heart using radioactive sources.

== The heart ==
{{main|heart|human heart}}

As the center focus of cardiology, the heart has numerous anatomical features (e.g., [[atrium (heart)|atria]], [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s, [[heart valve]]s) and numerous physiological features (e.g., [[systole (medicine)|systole]], [[heart sounds]], [[afterload]]) that have been encyclopedically documented for many centuries.

Disorders of the heart lead to [[heart disease]] and [[cardiovascular disease]] and can lead to a significant number of deaths: [[cardiovascular disease]] is the leading [[cause of death]] and caused 29.34% of all deaths in 2002.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The primary responsibility of the heart is to pump [[blood]] throughout the body.
It pumps blood from the body — called the [[systemic circulation]] — through the [[lung]]s — called the [[pulmonary circulation]] — and then back out to the body.
This means that the heart is connected to and affects the entirety of the body. Simplified, the heart is a circuit of the [[Circulatory system|Circulation]].
While plenty is known about the healthy heart, the bulk of study in cardiology is in disorders of the heart and restoration, and where possible, of function.

The heart is a muscle that squeezes blood and functions like a pump.
Each part of the heart is susceptible to failure or dysfunction and the heart can be divided into the mechanical and the electrical parts.

The electrical part of the heart is centered on the periodic contraction (squeezing) of the [[myocardium|muscle cells]] that is caused by the [[cardiac pacemaker]] located in the [[sinoatrial node]].
The study of the electrical aspects is a sub-field of [[electrophysiology]] called [[cardiac electrophysiology]] and is epitomized with the [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG/EKG).
The [[action potential]]s generated in the pacemaker propagate throughout the heart in a specific pattern. The system that carries this potential is called the [[electrical conduction system of the heart|electrical conduction system]].
Dysfunction of the electrical system manifests in many ways and may include [[Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome]], [[ventricular fibrillation]], and [[heart block]].

The mechanical part of the heart is centered on the [[fluid mechanics|fluidic movement]] of [[blood]] and the functionality of the heart as a [[pump]].
The mechanical part is ultimately the purpose of the heart and many of the disorders of the heart disrupt the ability to move blood.
Failure to move sufficient blood can result in failure in other organs and may result in death if severe.
[[Heart failure]] is one condition in which the mechanical properties of the heart have failed or are failing, which means insufficient blood is being circulated.

== Disorders ==
Cardiology is concerned with the normal functionality of the heart and the deviation from a healthy heart.
Many disorders involve the heart itself but some are outside of the heart.

=== Disorders of the coronary circulation ===
[[File:Coronary arteries.png|thumb|350px|Coronary arteries labeled in red text and other landmarks in blue text.]]

Contrary to a basic understanding of the cardiovascular system, the heart cannot itself receive enough oxygen and nutrients from the blood it pumps and it must be supplied with blood as if it were any other [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] in the body. Unlike the systemic organs the heart receives perfusion in the phase of diastole rather than systole. This circulation of blood is called the [[coronary circulation]].
The coronary circulation consists of [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]] and [[coronary vein]]s.

Disorders of the coronary circulation can have devastating effects to the heart since damage to the heart can reduce coronary circulation which causes further damage. A few examples are presented, as follows:

; [[Acute coronary syndrome]] (ACS) : Acute coronary syndrome is a broad term encompassing many acute [[myocardial infarction]] symptoms.
; [[Angina pectoris]]: Angina pectoris literally means "chest pain" that refers to pain caused by [[ischemia]] of the heart.
; [[Atherosclerosis]]: Atherosclerosis is the condition in which an artery wall thickens as the result of a build-up of fatty materials (e.g., [[cholesterol]]).  Atherosclerosis of a coronary artery leads to [[coronary heart disease]].
; [[Coronary heart disease]]: Coronary heart disease is a general term for any reduction in coronary circulation.  One such condition is [[atherosclerosis]].
; [[Myocardial infarction]] (aka heart attack) : A myocardial infarction is the death of a part of the heart which is typically caused by a blockage of the coronary circulation or [[coronary heart disease]].
; [[Restenosis]]: Recurrence of [[stenosis]] which would refer to a narrowing of a [[coronary artery]] in the context of the coronary circulation.

=== Cardiac arrest ===
[[File:Asystole11.JPG|thumb|350px|A rhythm strip showing a couple beats of normal sinus rhythm followed by an atrial beat and [[asystole]] ("flatline").]]

[[Cardiac arrest]] refers to the cessation(to cease)of normal systemic circulation due to failure in proper contraction of the heart.
There are several conditions that can cause cardiac arrest.

; [[Asystole]] ("flatline") : Asystole refers to the absence of electrical activity of the heart and is sometimes referred to as a "flatline" because the [[electrocardiogram]] shows a solid line due to the absence of electrical activity.
; [[Pulseless electrical activity]] (PEA) : Pulseless electrical activity is when the [[electrocardiogram]] shows a rhythm that should produce a [[pulse]] but it does not.  PEA is commonly caused by the 6 H's and 6 T's (see PEA article).
; [[Pulseless ventricular tachycardia]]: Pulseless [[ventricular tachycardia]] (VT) Is one classification of VT such that no [[pulse]] is felt because of an ineffective cardiac output which causes cardiac arrest.
; [[Sudden cardiac death]]: Sudden cardiac death is a concept of [[natural death]] rather than a specific medical condition.  There are several causes of sudden cardiac death and it is distinct from [[cardiac arrest]].
; [[Ventricular fibrillation]]: Ventricular fibrillation is [[fibrillation]] of the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s of the heart. Rhythmic contraction is necessary for efficient movement of blood and fibrillation disrupts this rhythm sufficiently to cause cardiac arrest

Treatment of cardiac arrest includes [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) and [[defibrillation]] depending on the exact cause of cardiac arrest.
