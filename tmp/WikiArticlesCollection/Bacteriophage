[[Image:PhageExterior.svg|right|thumb|300px|The structure of a typical myovirus bacteriophage]]

A '''bacteriophage''' (informally, ''phage'') is a [[virus]] that infects and replicates within [[bacteria]]. The term is derived from 'bacteria' and the [[Greek language|Greek]] φαγεῖν ''phagein'' "to devour". Bacteriophages are composed of [[proteins]] that [[Capsid|encapsulate]] a [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] [[genome]], and may have relatively simple or elaborate structures. Their genomes may encode as few as four [[genes]], and as many as hundreds of genes. Phage replicate within bacteria following the injection of their genome into the [[cytoplasm]]. Bacteriophage are among the most common and diverse entities in the [[biosphere]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite book | author = Mc Grath S and van Sinderen D (editors). | title = Bacteriophage: Genetics and Molecular Biology | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2007 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/phage | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/phage  ] | isbn = 978-1-904455-14-1}}</ref>

Phages are widely distributed in locations populated by [[bacteria]]l hosts, such as soil or the intestines of animals. One of the densest natural sources for phages and other viruses is sea water, where up to 9×10<sup>8</sup> [[virus|virions]] per milliliter have been found in microbial mats at the surface,<ref>{{cite doi|10.1128/MMBR.64.1.69-114.2000}}</ref> and up to 70% of marine bacteria may be infected by phages.<ref name="Prescott">Prescott, L. (1993). Microbiology, Wm. C. Brown Publishers, ISBN 0-697-01372-3</ref>

==Classification==
The dsDNA tailed phages, or ''Caudovirales'', account for 95% of all the phages reported in the scientific literature, and possibly make up the majority of phages on the planet.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> However, other phages occur abundantly in the biosphere, with different virions, genomes and lifestyles. Phages are classified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) according to morphology and nucleic acid.

Nineteen families are currently recognised that infect bacteria and archaea. Of these, only two families have RNA genomes and only five families are enveloped. Of the viral families with DNA genomes, only two have single-stranded genomes. Eight of the viral families with DNA genomes have circular genomes, while nine have linear genomes. Nine families infect bacteria only, nine infect archaea only, and one (''Tectiviridae'') infects both bacteria and archaea.

==History==
[[File:Felix d'Herelle.png|right|thumb|150px|Félix d'Herelle]]
Since ancient times, reports of river waters having the ability to cure infectious diseases have been documented<!--or "...documented reports of the ability of river water to cure infectious diseases," but illogical in original form-->, such as [[leprosy]]. In 1896, [[Ernest Hanbury Hankin]] reported that something in the waters of the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers in [[India]] had marked [[antibacterial]] action against [[cholera]] and could pass through a very fine porcelain filter. In 1915, [[United Kingdom|British]] [[bacteriologist]] [[Frederick Twort]], superintendent of the Brown Institution of London, discovered a small agent that infected and killed bacteria. He believed the agent must be one of the following:
# a stage in the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of the bacteria;
# an [[enzyme]] produced by the bacteria themselves; or
# a virus that grew on and destroyed the bacteria.

Twort's work was interrupted by the onset of [[World War I]] and shortage of funding. Independently, [[French-Canadian]] [[microbiology|microbiologist]] [[Félix d'Hérelle]], working at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Paris]], announced on 3 September 1917, that he had discovered "an invisible, antagonistic microbe of the [[dysentery]] bacillus". For d’Hérelle, there was no question as to the nature of his discovery: "In a flash I had understood: what caused my clear spots was in fact an invisible microbe ... a virus parasitic on bacteria."<ref name="Herelle1917">{{cite journal

==Phage therapy==
{{Main|Phage therapy}}

Phages were discovered to be antibacterial agents and were used in Georgia and the United States during the 1920s and 1930s for treating bacterial infections. They had widespread use, including treatment of soldiers in the Red Army. However, they were abandoned for general use in the West for several reasons:

* Medical trials were carried out, but a basic lack of understanding of phages made these invalid.
* Phage therapy was seen as untrustworthy, because many of the trials were conducted on totally unrelated diseases such as allergies and viral infections.
* Antibiotics were discovered and marketed widely. They were easier to make, store and to prescribe.
* Former Soviet research continued, but publications were mainly in Russian or Georgian languages, and were unavailable internationally for many years.
* Clinical trials evaluating the antibacterial efficacy of bacteriophage preparations were conducted without proper controls and were methodologically incomplete preventing the formulation of important conclusions

Their use has continued since the end of the Cold War in Georgia and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe. Globalyz Biotech is an international joint venture that commercializes bacteriophage treatment and its various applications across the globe. The company has successfully used bacteriophages in administering [[Phage therapy]] to patients suffering from bacterial infections, including: [[Staphylococcus]] (including [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]), [[Streptococcus]], [[Pseudomonas]], [[Salmonella]], skin and soft tissue, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and orthopedic infections. In 1923, the [[George Eliava Institute|Eliava Institute]] was opened in [[Tbilisi, Georgia]], to research this new science and put it into practice.

The first regulated randomized, double blind clinical trial was reported in the Journal of Wound Care in June 2009, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of a bacteriophage cocktail to treat infected venous leg ulcers in human patients. The study was approved by the FDA as a Phase I clinical trial. Study results satisfactorily demonstrated safety of therapeutic application of bacteriophages, however it did not show efficacy. The authors explain that the use of certain chemicals that are part of standard wound care (e.g. lactoferrin, silver) may have interfered with bacteriophage viability. Another regulated clinical trial in Western Europe (treatment of ear infections caused by ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'') was reported shortly after in the journal Clinical Otolaryngology in August 2009.[14] The study concludes that bacteriophage preparations were safe and effective for treatment of chronic ear infections in humans. Additionally, there have been numerous animal and other experimental clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of bacteriophages for various diseases, such as infected burns and wounds, and cystic fibrosis associated lung infections, among others. Meanwhile, Western scientists are developing engineered viruses to overcome antibiotic resistance, and engineering the phage genes responsible for coding enzymes which degrade the biofilm matrix, phage structural proteins and also enzymes responsible for lysis of bacterial cell wall. <Citation see #2, 3, 4>

==Replication==
[[File:Phage injection.png|thumb|right|Diagram of the DNA injection process]]
Bacteriophages may have a [[lytic cycle]] or a [[lysogenic cycle]], and a few viruses are capable of carrying out both. With ''lytic phages'' such as the [[T4 phage]], bacterial cells are broken open (lysed) and destroyed after immediate replication of the virion.  As soon as the cell is destroyed, the phage progeny can find new hosts to infect. Lytic phages are more suitable for [[phage therapy]]. Some lytic phages undergo a phenomenon known as lysis inhibition, where completed phage progeny will not immediately lyse out of the cell if extracellular phage concentrations are high. This mechanism is not identical to that of [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate phage]] going dormant and is usually temporary. 

In contrast, the ''[[lysogenic cycle]]'' does not result in immediate lysing of the host cell. Those phages able to undergo lysogeny are known as [[temperate phage]]s. Their viral genome will integrate with host DNA and replicate along with it fairly harmlessly, or may even become established as a [[plasmid]]. The virus remains dormant until host conditions deteriorate, perhaps due to depletion of nutrients; then, the [[endogenous]] phages (known as [[prophage]]s) become active. At this point they initiate the reproductive cycle, resulting in lysis of the host cell. As the lysogenic cycle allows the host cell to continue to survive and reproduce, the virus is reproduced in all of the cell’s offspring. 
An example of a bacteriophage known to follow the lysogenic cycle and the lytic cycle is the phage lambda of ''E. coli.''<ref>Mason, Kenneth A., Jonathan B. Losos, Susan R. Singer, Peter H Raven, and George B. Johnson. (2011). ''Biology'', p. 533. McGraw-Hill, New York. ISBN 978-0-07-893649-4.</ref>

Sometimes prophages may provide benefits to the host bacterium while they are dormant by adding new functions to the bacterial [[genome]] in a phenomenon called [[lysogenic conversion]]. Examples are the conversion of harmless strains of ''[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]'' or ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' by  bacteriophages to a highly virulent ones, which cause [[Diphtheria]] or [[cholera]], respectively.<ref name="pmid19007916">{{cite journal |author=Mokrousov I |title=Corynebacterium diphtheriae: genome diversity, population structure and genotyping perspectives |journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19007916 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2008.09.011 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid21799407">{{cite journal |author=Charles RC, Ryan ET |title=Cholera in the 21st century |journal=Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=472–7 |year=2011 |month=October |pmid=21799407 |doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e32834a88af |url=}}</ref>  Strategies to combat certain bacterial infections by targeting these toxin-encoding prophages have been proposed.<ref>{{cite doi|10.3389/fcimb.2012.00161}}</ref> 
===Attachment and penetration ===

[[Image:Phage.jpg|thumb|In this [[electron micrograph]] of bacteriophages attached to a bacterial cell, the viruses are the size and shape of coliphage T1.]]
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Trialphage.jpg|thumb|A 3D rendering of a T4 type bacteriophage landing on a bacterium to inject genetic material]] -->
To enter a host cell, bacteriophages attach to specific receptors on the surface of bacteria, including [[lipopolysaccharide]]s, [[teichoic acid]]s, [[protein]]s, or even [[flagella]]. This specificity means  a bacteriophage can infect only certain bacteria bearing receptors to which they can bind, which in turn determines the phage's host range. Host growth conditions also influence the ability of the phage to attach and invade them.<ref name="pmid9356254">{{cite doi|10.1006/jmbi.1997.1353}}</ref> As phage virions do not move independently, they must rely on random encounters with the right receptors when in solution (blood, lymphatic circulation, irrigation, soil water, etc.).

Myovirus bacteriophages use a [[hypodermic syringe]]-like motion to inject their genetic material into the cell. After making contact with the appropriate receptor, the tail fibers flex to bring the base plate closer to the surface of the cell; this is known as reversible binding. Once attached completely, irreversible binding is initiated and the tail contracts, possibly with the help of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] present in the tail,<ref name="Prescott"/> injecting genetic material through the bacterial membrane.
Podoviruses lack an elongated tail sheath similar to that of a myovirus, so they instead use their small, tooth-like tail fibers to enzymatically degrade a portion of the cell membrane before inserting their genetic material.

=== Synthesis of proteins and nucleic acid ===
Within minutes, bacterial [[ribosome]]s start translating viral mRNA into protein. For RNA-based phages, [[RNA replicase]] is synthesized early in the process. Proteins modify the bacterial [[RNA polymerase]] so it preferentially transcribes viral mRNA. The host’s normal synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids is disrupted, and it is forced to manufacture viral products, instead. These products go on to become part of new virions within the cell, helper proteins that help assemble the new virions, or proteins involved in cell [[lysis]]. [[Walter Fiers]] ([[University of Ghent]], [[Belgium]]) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a gene (1972) and of the viral genome of [[bacteriophage MS2]] (1976).<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/260500a0}}</ref>

===Virion assembly===
In the case of the [[T4 phage]], the construction of new virus particles involves the assistance of helper proteins. The base plates are assembled first, with the tails being built upon them afterwards. The head capsids, constructed separately, will spontaneously assemble with the tails. The DNA is packed efficiently within the heads. The whole process takes about 15 minutes.
[[Image:Tevenphage.svg|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of a typical tailed bacteriophage structure]]

===Release of virions===
Phages may be released via cell lysis, by extrusion, or, in a few cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called [[endolysin]], which attacks and breaks down the cell wall [[peptidoglycan]]. An altogether different phage type, the filamentous phages, make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a [[lysogenic]] cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as [[prophage]].

==Genome structure==
Bacteriophage genomes are especially mosaic: the genome of any one phage species appears to be composed of numerous individual modules.  These modules may be found in other phage species in different arrangements. [[Mycobacteriophages]] - bacteriophages with [[mycobacteria]]l hosts - have provided excellent examples of this mosaicism.  In these mycobacteriophages, genetic assortment may be the result of repeated instances of [[site-specific recombination]] and illegitimate recombination (the result of phage genome acquisition of bacterial host genetic sequences).<ref name="pmid18178732">{{cite journal |author=Morris P, Marinelli LJ, Jacobs-Sera D, Hendrix RW, Hatfull GF |title=Genomic characterization of mycobacteriophage Giles: evidence for phage acquisition of host DNA by illegitimate recombination |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=190 |issue=6 |pages=2172–82 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18178732 |pmc=2258872 |doi=10.1128/JB.01657-07 |url=http://jb.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18178732}}</ref> It should be noted, however, that evolutionary mechanisms shaping the genomes of bacterial viruses vary between different families and depend on the type of the nucleic acid, characteristics of the virion structure, as well as the mode of the viral life cycle.<ref name="pmid22126996">{{cite journal |author=Krupovic M, Prangishvili D, Hendrix RW, Bamford DH |title=Genomics of bacterial and archaeal viruses: dynamics within the prokaryotic virosphere |journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews : MMBR |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=610–35 |year=2011 |month=December |pmid=22126996 |pmc=3232739 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.00011-11 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=22126996}}</ref>

==In the environment==
{{Main|Marine bacteriophage}}
[[Metagenomics]] has allowed the in-water detection of bacteriophages that was not possible previously. These investigations revealed phages are much more abundant in the water column of both freshwater and marine habitats than previously thought,<ref>Breitbart, M, P Salamon, B Andresen, J Mahaffy, A Segall, D Mead, F Azam, F Rohwer (2002) Genomic analysis of uncultured marine viral communities. Proceedings of the National Academy USA. 99:14250-14255.</ref> and they can cause significant mortality of [[bacterioplankton]]. Methods in phage community ecology have been developed to assess phage-induced mortality of bacterioplankton and its role for food web process and [[biogeochemical]] cycle to genetically fingerprint phage communities or populations and estimate viral [[biodiversity]] by metagenomics. The [[lysis]] of bacteria by phages releases organic carbon that was previously particulate (cells) into dissolved forms, which makes the carbon more available to other organisms. Phages are not only the most abundant biological entities but also probably the most diverse ones. The majority of the sequence data obtained from phage communities have no equivalents in databases. These data and other detailed analyses indicate phage-specific genes and ecological traits are much more frequent than previously thought. To reveal the meaning of this genetic and ecological versatility, studies have to be performed with communities and at [[spatiotemporal]] scales relevant for microorganisms.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Bacteriophages have also been used in [[hydrology|hydrological]] tracing and modelling in [[river]] systems, especially where surface water and [[groundwater]] interactions occur. The use of phages is preferred to the more conventional [[dye]] marker because they are significantly less absorbed when passing through ground waters and they are readily detected at very low concentrations.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1747-6593.1988.tb01352.x}}</ref>

==Role in food fermentation==
A broad number of food products, commodity chemicals, and [[biotechnology]] products are manufactured industrially by large-scale bacterial [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] of various organic substrates. Because enormous amounts of bacteria are being cultivated each day in large fermentation vats, the risk of bacteriophage [[contamination]] could rapidly bring fermentation to a halt. The resulting economic setback is a serious threat in these industries. The relationship between bacteriophages and their bacterial hosts is very important in the context of the food fermentation industry. Sources of phage contamination, measures to control their [[self-replication|propagation]] and [[dissemination]], and biotechnological defense strategies developed to restrain phages are of interest. The dairy fermentation industry has openly acknowledged the problem of phages and has been working with academia and starter culture companies to develop defense strategies and systems to curtail the propagation and evolution of phages for decades.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

==Other areas of use==
Since 2006, the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and USDA have approved several bacteriophage products. Intralytix introduced LMP-102, also called ListShield as a food additive to target and kill ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]''. LMP-102 (ListShield by Intralytix) was approved for treating ready-to-eat (RTE) poultry and meat products. In that same year, the FDA approved LISTEX by [[Micreos]] (formerly EBI Food Safety) using bacteriophages on cheese to kill the ''L. monocytogenes'' bacteria, giving them [[generally recognized as safe]] (GRAS) status.<ref>U.S. FDA/CFSAN: Agency Response Letter, GRAS Notice No. 000198</ref> In July 2007, the same bacteriophage were approved for use on all food products.<ref>(U.S. FDA/CFSAN: Agency Response Letter, GRAS Notice No. 000218)</ref>  In 2011 USDA confirmed that LISTEX is a clean label processing-aid and is included in USDA.<ref>[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/oppde/rdad/fsisdirectives/7120.1.pdf FSIS Directive 7120]</ref> Research in the field of food safety is continuing to see if lytic phages are a viable option to control other food-borne pathogens in various food products.

Government agencies in the West have for several years been looking to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the former [[Soviet Union]] for help with exploiting phages for counteracting bioweapons and toxins, such as [[anthrax]] and [[botulism]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/americas/25iht-institute.4.5869943.html The New York Times: Studying anthrax in a Soviet-era lab - with Western funding]</ref> Developments are continuing among research groups in the US.  Other uses include spray application in horticulture for protecting plants and vegetable produce from decay and the spread of bacterial disease. Other applications for bacteriophages are as biocides for environmental surfaces, e.g., in hospitals, and as preventative treatments for catheters and medical devices prior to use in clinical settings. The technology for phages to be applied to dry surfaces, e.g., uniforms, curtains, or even sutures for surgery now exists. Clinical trials reported in the ''Lancet''<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1749-4486.2009.01973.x}}</ref> show success in veterinary treatment of pet dogs with otitis.

[[Phage display]] is a different use of phages involving a library of phages with a variable peptide linked to a surface protein. Each phage's genome encodes the variant of the protein displayed on its surface (hence the name), providing a link between the peptide variant and its encoding gene. Variant phages from the library can be selected through their binding affinity to an immobilized molecule (e.g., botulism toxin) to neutralize it. The bound, selected phages can be multiplied by reinfecting a susceptible bacterial strain, thus allowing them to retrieve the peptides encoded in them for further study.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The [[Sensing of phage-triggered ion cascades (SEPTIC)|SEPTIC]] bacterium sensing and identification method uses the ion emission and its dynamics during phage infection and offers high specificity and speed for detection.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Phage-ligand technology]] makes use of proteins, which are identified from bacteriophages, characterized and recombinantly expressed for various applications such as binding of bacteria and bacterial components (e.g. [[endotoxin]]) and lysis of bacteria.<ref>[http://www.hyglos.de/en/technology/technological-background.html Technological background Phage-ligand technology]</ref>
