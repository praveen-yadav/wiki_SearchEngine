'''Zahir-ud-din Muhammad Babur''' (14 February 1483{{spaced ndash}}26 December 1530; sometimes also spelt '''Baber''' or '''Babar''') was a conqueror from Central Asia who, following a series of setbacks, finally succeeded in laying the basis for the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal dynasty]] in the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and became the first Mughal emperor. He was a direct descendant of [[Timur]], from the Barlas clan, through his father, and a descendant also of [[Genghis Khan]] through his mother. Culturally, he was greatly influenced by the [[Persian culture]] and this affected both his own actions and those of his successors, giving rise to a significant expansion of the [[Persianate society|Persianate]] ethos in the [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref name="Ẓahīr-al-Dīn Moḥammad Bābor">F. Lehmann: [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/babor-zahir-al-din Ẓahīr-al-Dīn Moḥammad Bābor]. In [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]. Online Ed. December 1988 (updated August 2011).

His origin, milieu, training, and education were steeped in Persian culture and so Bābor was largely responsible for the fostering of this culture by his descendants, the Mughals of India, and for the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and historiographical results."''</ref><ref name="Robert L.

== Etymology ==

Ẓahīr ad-Dīn Muḥammad      ({{lang-fa|'''ﻇﻬﻴﺮﺍﻟﺪﻳﻦ محمد'''}}, also known by his royal titles as ''al-ṣultānu 'l-ʿazam wa 'l-ḫāqān al-mukkarram bādshāh-e ġāzī''), is more commonly known by his nickname, ''Bābur'' ('''<big>بابر</big>'''). He used the royal title of ''[[Padshah]]''.<ref>[http://dawn.com/2011/01/02/past-present-emperors-new-names/ Emperors new names (title) Mirza], the title of Mirza and not Khan or Padishah, which were the titles of the Mongol rulers.</ref>

According to Stephen Frederic Dale, the name ''Babur'' is derived from the Persian word ''babr'', meaning  "tiger", a word that repeatedly appears in [[Ferdowsi|Firdawsī's]] [[Shahnameh|Shāhnāma]]<ref name="Dale2004"/> and had also been borrowed by the Turkic languages of Central Asia.<ref>Chisholm, Hugh (1910), The Encyclopædia Britannica</ref><ref>Thumb, Albert, ''Handbuch des Sanskrit, mit Texten und Glossar'', German original, ed. C. Winter, 1953, [http://books.google.de/books?id=_kMeAAAAIAAJ&q=babr+sanskrit&dq=babr+sanskrit&lr=&as_brr=0&pgis=1 Snippet, p.318]</ref> This thesis is supported by the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, explaining that the Turko-Mongol name ''Timur'' underwent a similar evolution, from the Sanskrit word ''cimara'' ("iron") via a modified version ''*čimr'' to the final Turkicized version ''timür'', with ''-ür'' replacing ''-r'' due to need to provide vocalic support between ''m'' and ''r''. The choice of vowel would nominally be restricted to one of the four front vowels (''e'', ''i'', ''&ouml;'', ''&uuml;'' per the Ottoman vowel harmony rule (hence ''babr'' → ''babür'') although the rule is routinely violated for words of Persian or Arabic derivation.<ref>''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland'', Cambridge University Press, 1972. [http://books.google.de/books?id=W_ssAAAAIAAJ&q=babr+babur+tiger&dq=babr+babur+tiger&pgis=1 Snippet, p.104].</ref>

Contradicting these views, W.M. Thackston argues that the name cannot be taken from ''babr'' and instead must be derived from a word that has evolved out of the Indo-European word for ''beaver'', pointing to the fact that the name is pronounced ''bāh-bor''<ref name="baburnama">{{cite book | title=The Baburnama: Memoirs of Babur, Prince and Emperor |publisher=Modern Library |isbn=0-375-76137-3 |year=2002 |author=Babur, Emperor of Hindustan |others=translated, edited and annotated by W.M.

===Early life===
[[File:Umar Shaykh Mirza, 1875-1900.jpg|thumb|[[Umar Sheikh Mirza]]&nbsp;– Father of Babur, ca.1875–1900]]

He was the eldest son of [[Umar Sheikh Mirza|Omar Sheykh Mirzā]],<ref>{{cite web |quote=On the occasion of the birth of Babar Padishah (the son of Omar Shaikh) |url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/rash1.html |title=Mirza Muhammad Haidar |publisher=University of Washington |work=Silk Road Seattle |accessdate=2006-11-07 }}</ref> ruler of the Fergana Valley, the son of [[Abu Sa'id (Timurid dynasty)|Abū Saʿīd Mirza]] (and grandson of [[Miran Shah]], who was himself son of [[Timur]]) and his wife [[Qutlugh Nigar Khanum]], daughter of [[Yunus Khan]], the ruler of [[Moghulistan]] (and great-great grandson of [[Tughlugh Timur]], the son of [[Esen Buqa I]], who was the great-great-great grandson of [[Chaghatai Khan]], the second born son of [[Genghis Khan]]).<ref name="baburnama"/><ref>''Tarikh-i-Rashidi: A History of the Moghuls of Central Asia''. Elias and Denison Ross (ed. and trans.). 1898, reprinted 1972. ISBN 0-7007-0021-8</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2012}}

Although Babur hailed from the [[Barlas]] tribe which was of [[Mongol]] origin, his tribe had embraced [[Turkic people|Turkic]]<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-524 Babur] at [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]</ref> and [[Persian culture]],<ref name="Iranica"/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia |title=Timurids |url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/ti/Timurids.html |edition=6th Ed. |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |location=New York |accessdate=2006-11-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061205073939/http://bartleby.com/65/ti/Timurids.html| archivedate= 5 December 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> converted to Islam and resided in [[Turkestan]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. His mother tongue was the [[Chaghatai language]] (known to Babur as ''Turkī'', "Turkic") and he was equally fluent in [[Persian language|Persian]], the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Timurid elite.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-32175 Iran: The Timurids and Turkmen] at [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].</ref>

Hence Babur, though nominally a Mongol (or ''Moghul'' in Persian language), drew much of his support from the local Turkic and Iranian people of Central Asia, and his army was diverse in its ethnic makeup. It included [[Persian people|Persians]] (known to Babur as "[[Sart]]s" and "[[Tājik people|Tajiks]]"), [[Pashtun people|ethnic Afghans]], [[History of Arabs in Afghanistan|Arabs]], as well as Barlas and Chaghatayid Turco-Mongols from Central Asia.<ref>{{cite book |title=Central Asia in Historical Perspective |last=Manz |first=Beatrice Forbes |chapter=The Symbiosis of Turk and Tajik |publisher=Boulder, Colorado & Oxford |year=1994 |page=58 |isbn=0-8133-3638-4}}</ref> Babur's army also included [[Qizilbash|Qizilbāsh]] fighters, a militant religious order of [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] ''[[Sufism|Sufis]]'' from [[Safavid Empire|Safavid Persia]] who later became one of the most influential groups in the Mughal court.

Babur claimed in his memoir to be strong and physically fit, claiming to have swam across every major river he encountered, including twice across the [[Ganges River]] in [[North India]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Elliot |first=Henry Miers |others=John Dowson (ed.) |title=The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians |chapter=The Muhammadan Period |chapterurl=http://persian.packhum.org/persian//pf?file=80201014&ct=56 |accessdate=2008-04-02 |date=1867–1877 |publisher=Trubner |location=London |quote=...and on the same journey, he swam twice across the Ganges, as he said he had done with every other river he had met with. }}</ref> His passions could be equally strong.

My affection afterwards declined, and my shyness increased; in so much, that my mother the Khanum, used to fall upon me and scold me with great fury, sending me off like a criminal to visit her once in a month or forty days. }}</ref> Babur also had a great passion to kill people, cut heads off people and create pillars out of the cut off heads. He claimed to have created several such pillars in his autobiography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/baburnama017152mbp |title=Baburnama translated by Annette Susannah Beveridge 1922, pp. 232, 370, 371 |publisher=Archive.org |date=10 March 2001 |accessdate=2010-10-02}}</ref>{{primary source-inline|date=October 2013}}

Though religion had a central place in his life, Babur also approvingly quoted a line of poetry by one of his contemporaries: ''"I am drunk, officer. Punish me when I am sober"''. He quit drinking alcohol before the [[Battle of Khanwa]], only two years before his death for health reasons, and demanded that his court do the same. But he did not stop chewing narcotic preparations, and did not lose his sense of irony. He wrote, "Everyone regrets drinking and swears an oath (of [[abstinence]]); I swore the oath and regret that."<ref>Pope, Hugh (2005).

==Origins of the Mughal Empire==

===Military career===
[[File:1502 Acclamation of Nine Standards th.jpg|thumb|Babur and his [[Mughal Army]] saluting the Nine Standards introduced by [[Genghis Khan]].]]

In 1495, at twelve years of age, Babur succeeded his father as ruler of [[Farghana]], in present-day Uzbekistan.<ref>{{cite book|title=Other Routes: 1500 Years of African and Asian Travel Writing |page=162 |last=Khair |first=Tabish |isbn=1-904955-11-8 |publisher=Signal Books |date=6 January 2006}}</ref> His uncles were relentless in their attempts to dislodge him from this position as well as many of his other territorial possessions to come.<ref>{{cite book|title=Domesticity and Power in the Early Mughal World |last=Lal |first=Ruby |isbn=0-521-85022-3 |date=25 September 2005 |page=69 |quote=It was over these possessions, provinces controlled by uncles, or cousins of varying degrees, that Babur fought with close and distant relatives for much of his life.}}</ref> Thus, Babur spent a large portion of his life without shelter and in exile, aided by friends and peasants. In 1497, he  [[Siege of Samarkand (1497)|besieged the city of Samarkand]] for seven months before eventually gaining control of it.<ref name="Afghanistan">{{cite book |title= Afghanistan: A Short History of Its People and Politics |last=Ewans |first=Martin |isbn=0-06-050508-7 |publisher=HarperCollins |month=September | year=2002 |pages=26–7}}</ref> Meanwhile, a rebellion amongst nobles back home approximately {{convert|350|km|mi}} away robbed him of [[Farghana Valley|Farghana]].<ref name="Afghanistan" /> As he was marching to recover it, Babur's troops deserted in Samarkand, leaving him with neither Samarkand nor Fergana.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} 
[[File:Baburnama.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from the ''[[Baburnama]]''.]]

In 1501, he laid [[Siege of Samarkand (1501)|siege on Samarkand]] once more, but was soon after defeated by his most formidable rival, [[Muhammad Shaybani]], [[Khan (title)|khan]] of the Uzbeks.<ref name="Afghanistan" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/babur/babur1.html |quote=After being driven out of Samarkand in 1501 by the Uzbek Shaibanids... |title=The Memoirs of Babur |accessdate=2006-11-08 |publisher=University of Washington |work=Silk Road Seattle}}</ref> Samarkand, his lifelong obsession, was lost again. Escaping with a small band of followers from Fergana, for three years Babur concentrated on building up a strong army, recruiting widely amongst the Tajiks of [[Badakhshan]] in particular. In 1504, he was able to cross the snowy [[Hindu Kush]] mountains and [[Siege of Kabul (1504)|captured Kabul]]<ref name="Afghanistan" /> from the [[Arghun Dynasty|Arghunids]], who were forced to retreat to [[Kandahar]]. With this move, he gained a wealthy new kingdom and re-established his fortunes and assumed the title of ''[[Padshah]]''. In the following year, Babur united with [[Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqarah]] of [[Herat]], a fellow Timurid and distant relative, against the [[usurper]] [[Muhammad Shaybani]].<ref name="perspect">{{cite book |title=Perspectives on Persian Painting: Illustrations to Amir Khusrau's Khamsah |last=Brend |first=Barbara |date=20 December 2002 |isbn=0-7007-1467-7 |publisher=Routledge (UK) |page=188 }}</ref> However, the death of Sultan Husayn Mirza in 1506 delayed that venture. Babur instead stayed at [[Herat]], spending just two months there before being forced to leave due to diminishing resources.<ref name="perspect" /> Nevertheless, he marvelled at the intellectual abundance in Herat, which he stated was "filled with learned and matched men.",<ref>{{cite book |title=The Sewing Circles of Herat: A Personal Voyage Through Afghanistan |last=Lamb |first=Christina |page=153 |isbn=0-06-050527-3 |publisher=HarperCollins |month=February | year=2004 }}</ref> and became acquainted with the work of the [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]] poet [[Mir Ali Shir Nava'i]], who encouraged the use of [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] as a [[literary language]].

A potential rebellion finally forced him to return to [[Kabul]] from Herat, [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. He prevailed on that occasion, but two years later a revolt among some of his leading generals drove him out of Kabul. Escaping with very few companions, Babur soon returned to the city, capturing Kabul again and regaining the allegiance of the rebels. Meanwhile, [[Muhammad Shaybani]] was defeated and killed by [[Ismail I]], Shah of [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Persia]], in 1510,<ref>{{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions |last=Doniger |first=Wendy |isbn=0-87779-044-2 |month=September | year=1999 |page=539 |publisher=Merriam-Webster }}</ref> and Babur used this opportunity to attempt to reconquer his ancestral Timurid territories. Over the following few years, Babur and [[Shah]] Ismail would form a partnership in an attempt to take over parts of Central Asia. In return for Ismail's assistance, Babur permitted the Safavids to act as a suzerain over him and his followers.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Islamic World in Ascendancy: From the Arab Conquests to the Siege in Vienna |last=Sicker |first=Martin |isbn=0-275-96892-8 |month=August | year=2000 |page=189 |quote=Ismail was quite prepared to lend his support to the displaced Timurid prince, Zahir ad-Din Babur, who offered to accept Safavid suzerainty in return for help in regaining control of Transoxiana.}}</ref> Conversely, Shah Ismail reunited Babur with his sister [[Khanzada Begum|Khānzāda]], who had been imprisoned by and forced to marry the recently deceased [[Muhammad Shaybani|Shaybani]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Foreign Relations===
Babur's early relations with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] were poor because the Ottoman [[Sultan]] [[Selim I]] provided his arch rival Ubaydullah Khan with powerful [[matchlock]]s and [[cannon]]s.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=uB1uAAAAMAAJ&q=Ubaydullah+Khan#search_anchor Mughal-Ottoman relations: a study of political & diplomatic relations ... – Naimur Rahman Farooqi – Google Boeken<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In the year 1507, when ordered to accept [[Selim I]] as his rightful [[suzerainty|suzerain]] Babur refused, and gathered [[Qizilbash]] servicemen in order to counter the forces of Ubaydullah Khan during the [[Battle of Ghazdewan]]. In the year 1513, Ottoman Sultan [[Selim I]] reconciled with Babur (probably fearing that he would join the [[Safavid]]s), dispatched [[Ustad Ali Quli]] the artilleryman and [[Mustafa Rumi]] the [[Matchlock]] marksman and many other [[Ottoman Turk]]s, in order to assist Babur in his conquests. Thenceforth this particular assistance proved to be the basis of future Mughal-Ottoman relations.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=uB1uAAAAMAAJ&q=Babur&source=gbs_word_cloud_r&cad=6 Mughal-Ottoman relations: a study of political & diplomatic relations ... – Naimur Rahman Farooqi – Google Boeken<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[File:1526-First Battle of Panipat-Ibrahim Lodhi and Babur.jpg|thumb|Mughal artillery and troops in action during the [[Battle of Panipat (1526)]] .]]
Babur started his campaign in November 1525, when he reached [[Peshawar]] he got the news that Daulat Khan Lodi had switched sides and drove out Ala-ud-Din. Babur then marched onto Lahore to confront Daulat Khan Lodi, only to see Daulat's army melt away at their approach.<ref name="VDM0" /> Daulat surrendered and was pardoned, thus within three weeks of crossing the [[Indus]] Babur became the master of Punjab.

Babur marched onto Delhi via Sirhind, he reached the historical field of [[Panipat]] on 20 April 1526, where he met Ibrahim Lodi along with his numerically superior army of about 100,000 soldiers and 100 elephants.<ref name="VDM0" /><ref name="RSCHMI" /> The battle began on morning of 21 April 1526, Babur utilised the tactic of ''Tulugma'', encircled the Ibrahim Lodi's army and forcing them to face artillery fire directly, and frightening the war elephants utilised by the Delhi's army.<ref name="RSCHMI" /><ref name="acom" >{{cite web|last=Szczepanski|first=Kallie|title=The First Battle of Panipat|url=http://asianhistory.about.com/od/warsinasia/a/FirstbattleofPanipat.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=26 October 2013}}</ref>

Ibrahim Lodi died during the battle thus ending the Lodi Dynasty.<ref name="VDM0" /><ref name="acom" />

Babur wrote in his memoirs about his victory :
{{Quote|"By the grace of the Almighty God, this difficult task was made easy to me and that might army, in the space of a half a day was laid in dust."<ref name="VDM0" />}}

After the battle Babur occupied Delhi and Agra, seated himself on the throne of Lodi and laid the foundation of the Mughal Rule in India, but it was yet to be established and Babur was yet to become the ruler of India, as new contenders for the throne like, Rana Sanga, who rose to challenge his rule.<ref Name="VDM1">{{cite book|last=Mahajan|first=V.D.|title=History of medieval India|year=2007|publisher=S Chand|location=New Delhi|isbn=8121903645|edition=10th|pages=432–436}}</ref> However, Babur was able to take the fortress of Bayana, after sending the commander, Nizam Khan, a convincing poem in Persian:

====Battles with the Rajputs====
{{refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
[[File:KhusrauBabur.jpg|thumb|Khusrau Shah Kokultash pays homage and fealty to Babur, prior to the [[Battle of Khanwa]].]]

Although master of Delhi and Agra, Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless nights because of continuing worries over Raja Hasan Khan, ''Mewatpatti'' (title, Lord of Mewat), the Khanzada ruler of Mewat, [[Rana Sanga]], the [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Mewar]].

In A.D. 1526 a new power appeared in India. Babur, who claimed to be the representative of Timur Lang, after winning the battle of Panipat, took possession of Delhi and Agra, and determined that his enterprise should not be a mere raid like Timur's, but the foundation of a new and
lasting empire. Then it was that the Rajputs made their last great struggle for independence. They were led by Rana Sanga, a chief of Mewar, who invited the Mewatti chief, Hasan Khan, to aid the nation from which he had sprung in resisting the new horde of Musalmans from the north.<ref name="Gazetteer of Ulwur">Gazetteer of Ulwur</ref>{{full|date=November 2012}}

The political position of Hasan Khan at this time was a very important one. Babur, in his autobiography, speaks of him as the prime mover in all the confusions and insurrections of the period. He had, he states, vainly shown Hasan Khan distinguished marks of favour, but the affections of the infidel lay all on the side of the natives, the Hindus (Indians), and the propinquity of his country to Delhi made his opposition especially dangerous. Hasan Khan's seat at this time was at Ulwur, but local tradition says that he was originally established at Bahadarpur, eight miles from Ulwur.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Babur says that the ancestors of his opponent Hasan Khan had governed Mewat in uninterrupted succession for nearly 200 years, and that Tejara was their capital.<ref>Babur's Memoirs, pp. 368–69.</ref> In another place he calls him Raja Hasan Khan Mewati, an infidel, who was the prime mover and agitator in the insurrection against the Mughals.<ref>Babur's Memoirs, p. 335.</ref> The title of Raja and the term "infidel" show that Babur was aware of Hasan Khan's Hindu descent, and the period of '* nearly 200 years" most probably refers to the date when his ancestor became a Muslim in the reign of Firoz Shah between A.H. 752 and 790.<ref>Archaeological Survey of India Reports</ref>{{full|date=November 2012}}

The Rajput lords had, prior to Babur's intervention, succeeded in conquering some of the Sultanate's territory. They ruled an area directly to the southwest of Babur's new dominions, commonly known as [[Rajputana]] as well as fortified dominions in other parts of northern India. It was not a unified kingdom, but rather a confederacy of [[Principality|principalities]], under the informal suzerainty of Rana Sanga, head of the senior Rajput dynasty.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The Rajputs had possibly heard word of the heavy casualties inflicted by Lodi on Babur's forces, and believed that they could capture Delhi, and possibly all [[Hindustan]]. They hoped to bring it back into Hindu Rajput hands for the first time in almost three hundred and fifty years since [[Muhammad of Ghor|Sultan Shah-al Din Muhammad of Ghor]] defeated the Rajput [[Chauhan]] King [[Prithviraj III]] in 1192.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Furthermore, the Rajputs were well aware that there was dissent within the ranks of Babur's army. The hot Indian summer was upon them, and many troops wanted to return home to the cooler climes of Central Asia. The Rajputs' reputation for courage preceded them, and their superior numbers no doubt further contributed to the desire of Babur's army to retreat. According to Babur's own calculations the potential strength of the Rajput army was much larger than that deployed by the Lodis at [[Panipat]]. Babur resolved to make this an extended battle, and decided to push further into India, into lands never previously claimed by the Timurids. He needed his troops to defeat the Rajputs.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Despite the unwillingness of his troops to engage in further warfare, Babur was convinced he could overcome the Rajputs and gain complete control over Hindustan.  He made great propaganda of the fact that for the first time he was to battle non-Muslims, the ''[[Kafir]]'', to the extent of taking a vow to abstain from drinking (a common fraction among his people) for the rest of his life to win divine favour, and declared the war against Rana Sanga.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Death==
After Babur fell seriously ill, [[Humayun]], his eldest son, was summoned from his ''Jagir''.<ref Name="VDM">{{cite book|last=Mahajan|first=V.D.|title=History of medieval India|year=2007|publisher=S Chand|location=New Delhi|isbn=8121903645|edition=10th|page=438 ed}}</ref> He died at the age of 47 on {{OldStyleDate|January 5|1531|26 December 1530}}, and was succeeded by [[Humayun]]. In accordance to his will, his body was moved to [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] there it lies in [[Bagh-e Babur]] (Babur Gardens).<ref name="VDM" />

[[File:Baburnama 1.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Mughal Emperor]] Babur supervising the construction of an Imperial Garden.]]
It is generally agreed that, as a Timurid, Babur was not only significantly influenced by the [[Persian culture]], but that his empire also gave rise to the expansion of the [[Persianate society|Persianate]] ethos in the [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref name="Ẓahīr-al-Dīn Moḥammad Bābor"/><ref name="Robert L. Canfield 1991 p.20"/>

For example, F. Lehmann states in the [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]: 
{{Quotation|His origin, milieu, training, and culture were steeped in Persian culture and so Babur was largely responsible for the fostering of this culture by his descendants, the Mughals of India, and for the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and historiographical results.<ref name="Iranica">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Lehmann |first=F. |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/babor-zahir-al-din |title= Memoirs of Zehīr-ed-Dīn Muhammed Bābur |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]] |accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref>}}

Since he was a patrilineal descendant of [[Timur]], Babur regarded himself a Timurid and a Turk.<ref name=Dale>{{cite journal|last=Dale|first=Stephen F.|title=The Poetry and Autobiography of the Bâbur-nâma|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|year=1996|month=August|volume=55|issue=3|page=636|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2646449|accessdate=6 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Dale|first=Stephen F.|title=The Legacy of the Timurids|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society|date=24|year=2009|month=September|volume=8|issue=1|pages=43–58|doi=10.1017/S1356186300016424}}</ref> Some sources therefore claim that Babur's empire was Turkic in nature.<ref name="EB">{{cite encyclopedia

Babur is also held in high esteem in Afghanistan and Iran. In October 2005, [[Pakistan]] developed the [[Babur (cruise missile)|Babur Cruise Missile]], named in his honor.

===Babri mosque===

Babur is popularly believed to have demolished the Rama Temple at Ayodhya and built [[Babri Mosque]] in [[Ayodhya]], India. On 6 December 1992, Babri Masjid was demolished by [[Karsevak]]s of Ramajanmabhumi movement mobilised by the call given by organisations like [[Vishva Hindu Parishad|VHP]] and [[Bajrang Dal]]. [[L K Advani]] of [[BJP]] party was a leading figure of the movement, along with several other leaders of Hindu organisations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/news/india/report_sequence_of_events_on_december_6.php |title=Report: Sequence of events on December 6 |publisher=Ndtv.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref><ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/11/2009112454918803725.html Uproar over India mosque report: Inquiry into Babri mosque's demolition in 1992 indicts opposition BJP leaders] Al-Jazeera English – 24 November 2009</ref> Its destruction sparked off communal clashes around the country.<ref>The Crisis in Kashmir: Portents of War, Hopes of Peace By Šumit Ganguly R Page no 94, from [[Web Archive]]</ref> resulting in the killing of thousands of Muslims and Hindus.<ref>[http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/66354/20100928/ayodhya-supreme-court-babri-masjid-ram-temple.htm Anil das.
