'''Corona Australis''' {{IPAc-en|k|ɵ|ˈ|r|oʊ|n|ə|_|ɒ|ˈ|s|t|r|eɪ|l|ɨ|s}} or '''Corona Austrina''' {{IPAc-en|k|ɵ|ˈ|r|oʊ|n|ə|_|ɒ|ˈ|s|t|r|aɪ|n|ə}}{{sfn|Bagnall|2012|p=170}} is a [[constellation]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Its Latin name means "[[south]]ern [[crown (headgear)|crown]]", and it is the southern counterpart of [[Corona Borealis]], the northern crown. One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. The Ancient Greeks saw Corona Australis as a wreath rather than a crown and associated it with [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] or [[Centaurus]]. Other cultures have likened the pattern to a turtle, ostrich nest, a tent, or even a hut belonging to a [[rock hyrax]].

Although fainter than its namesake, the oval- or horseshoe-shaped pattern of its brighter stars renders it distinctive. [[Alpha Coronae Australis|Alpha]] and [[Beta Coronae Australis]] are the two brightest stars with an apparent magnitude of around 4.1. [[Epsilon Coronae Australis]] is the brightest example of a [[W Ursae Majoris variable]] in the southern sky. Lying alongside the [[Milky Way]], Corona Australis contains one of the closest [[Star formation|star-forming regions]] to our Solar System—a dusty [[dark nebula]] known as the [[Corona Australis Molecular Cloud]], lying about 430 light years away. Within it are stars at the earliest stages of their lifespan. The variable stars [[R Coronae Australis|R]] and [[TY Coronae Australis]] light up parts of the nebula, which varies in brightness accordingly.

== Characteristics ==

Corona Australis is a small constellation bordered by [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] to the north, [[Scorpius]] to the west, [[Telescopium]] to the south, and [[Ara (constellation)|Ara]] to the southwest. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'CrA'.{{sfn|Russell|1922|p=469}} The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of four segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|17|58.3}} and {{RA|19|19.0}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between −36.77° and −45.52°.{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Corona Australis}} Covering 128 square degrees, Corona Australis [[culmination|culminates]] at midnight around the 30th of June{{refn|name=Malin Frew 1995 p218}} and ranks 80th in area.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Constellations''}} Only visible at latitudes south of 53° north,{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Constellations''}} Corona Australis cannot be seen from the British Isles as it lies too far south,{{refn|name=Moore & Tirion 1997 pp164}} but it can be seen from southern Europe{{refn|name=Moore 2005 p202}} and readily from the southern United States.{{refn|name=Moore 'Stargazing' 2000 p86}}

== Notable features ==
[[Image:Constellation Corona Australis.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Corona Australis as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

While not a bright constellation, Corona Australis is nonetheless distinctive due to its easily identifiable pattern of stars,{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|2007|pp=126–127}} which has been described as horseshoe-{{refn|name=Falkner 2011 p100}} or oval-shaped.{{refn|name=Malin Frew 1995 p218}} Though it has no stars brighter than magnitude 2.4, it still has 21 stars visible to the unaided eye (brighter than magnitude 5.5),{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=130}} making it the second-brightest constellation.{{sfn|Bakich Podcast|26 August 2010}} [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] used the Greek letters Alpha through to Lambda to label the most prominent eleven stars in the constellation, designating two stars as Eta and omitting Iota altogether. [[Mu Coronae Australis]], a yellow star of spectral type G5.5III and apparent magnitude 5.21,{{sfn|SIMBAD Mu Coronae Australis}} was labelled by [[Johann Elert Bode]] and retained by [[Benjamin Apthorp Gould|Benjamin Gould]], who deemed it bright enough to warrant naming.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=114–115}}

=== Stars ===

{{see also|List of stars in Corona Australis}}

The only star in the constellation to have received a name is [[Alpha Coronae Australis|Alfecca Meridiana or Alpha CrA]]. The name combines the [[Arabic]] name of the constellation with the [[Latin]] for "middle".{{sfn|Allen|1963|pp=172–173}} In Arabic, ''Alfecca'' means "break", and refers to the shape of both Corona Australis and Corona Borealis.{{sfn|Kaler, ''Alfecca Meridiana''}} Also called simply "Meridiana",{{sfn|Bagnall|2012|p=170}} it is a white [[main sequence]] star located 130 light years away from Earth,{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|2007|pp=126–127}} with an [[apparent magnitude]] of 4.10 and [[Stellar classification|spectral type]] A2Va.{{sfn|SIMBAD Alpha Coronae Australis}} A rapidly rotating star, it spins at almost 200&nbsp;km per second at its equator, making a complete revolution in around 14 hours.{{sfn|Royer|Zorec|Gómez|2007|p=463}} Like the star [[Vega]], it has [[Infrared excess|excess infrared radiation]], which indicates it may be ringed by a disk of dust.{{sfn|Kaler, ''Alfecca Meridiana''}} <!-- cites two previous sentences --> It is currently a [[main-sequence star]], but will eventually [[stellar evolution|evolve]] into a [[white dwarf]]; currently, it has a luminosity 31 times greater, and a radius and mass of 2.3 times that of the Sun.{{sfn|Kaler, ''Alfecca Meridiana''}} [[Beta Coronae Australis]] is an orange [[giant star|giant]] 510 light years from Earth.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|2007|pp=126–127}} Its spectral type is K0II, and it is of apparent magnitude 4.11.{{sfn|SIMBAD Beta Coronae Australis}} Since its formation, it has evolved from a [[B-type star]] to a [[K-type star]]. Its [[luminosity class]] places it as a [[bright giant]]; its luminosity is 730 times that of the Sun,{{sfn|Kaler, ''Beta Coronae Australis''}} designating it one of the highest-luminosity K0-type stars visible to the naked eye.{{sfn|Bagnall|2012|p=170}} 100 million years old, it has a radius of 43 [[solar radius|solar radii]] (R<sub>☉</sub>) and a mass of between 4.5 and 5 [[solar mass]]es (M<sub>☉</sub>). Alpha and Beta are so similar as to be indistinguishable in brightness to the naked eye.{{sfn|Kaler, ''Beta Coronae Australis''}}

Some of the more prominent double stars include [[Gamma Coronae Australis]]—a pair of yellowish white stars 58 light years away from Earth, which orbit each other every 122 years. Widening since 1990, the two stars can be seen as separate with a 100&nbsp;mm aperture telescope;{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|2007|pp=126–127}} they are separated by 1.3 arcseconds at an angle of 61 degrees.{{sfn|Moore|Rees|2011|p=413}} They have a combined visual magnitude of 4.2;{{sfn|SIMBAD LTT 7565}} each component is an F8V [[dwarf star]] with a magnitude of 5.01.{{sfn|SIMBAD HR 7226}}{{sfn|SIMBAD HR 7227}} [[Epsilon Coronae Australis]] is an [[Binary star#Eclipsing binaries|eclipsing binary]] belonging to a class of stars known as [[W Ursae Majoris variable]]s. These star systems are known as [[Contact binary|contact binaries]] as the component stars are so close together they touch. Varying by a quarter of a magnitude around an average apparent magnitude of 4.83 every seven hours, the star system lies 98 light years away.{{sfn|Kaler, ''Epsilon Coronae Australis''}} Its spectral type is F4VFe-0.8+.{{sfn|SIMBAD Epsilon Coronae Australis}} At the southern end of the crown asterism are the stars [[Eta¹ Coronae Australis|Eta¹]] and [[Eta² Coronae Australis]], which form an [[optical double]].{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1991|pp=254–255}} Of magnitude 5.1 and 5.5, they are separable with the naked eye and are both white.{{sfn|Streicher|2008|pp=135–139}} [[Kappa Coronae Australis]] is an easily resolved optical double—the components are of apparent magnitudes 5.7 and 6.3 and are 1700 and 490 light years away respectively.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|2007|pp=126–127}} They appear at an angle of 359 degrees, separated by 21.6 arcseconds.{{sfn|Moore|Rees|2011|p=413}} Kappa² is actually the brighter of the pair and is more bluish white,{{sfn|Streicher|2008|pp=135–139}} with a spectral type of B9V,{{sfn|SIMBAD HR 6953}} while Kappa¹ is of spectral type A0III.{{sfn|SIMBAD HR 6952}} Lying 202 light years away, [[Lambda Coronae Australis]] is a double splittable in small telescopes. The primary is a white star of spectral type A2Vn and magnitude of 5.1,{{sfn|SIMBAD Lambda Coronae Australis}} while the companion star has a magnitude of 9.7.{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|2007|pp=126–127}} The two components are separated by 29.2 arcseconds at an angle of 214 degrees.{{sfn|Moore|Rees|2011|p=413}}

[[Zeta Coronae Australis]] is a rapidly rotating main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 4.8, 221.7 light years from Earth. The star has blurred lines in its hydrogen spectrum due to its rotation.{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1991|pp=254–255}} Its spectral type is B9V.{{sfn|SIMBAD Zeta Coronae Australis}} [[Theta Coronae Australis]] lies further to the west, a yellow giant of spectral type G8III and apparent magnitude 4.62.{{sfn|SIMBAD Theta Coronae Australis}} Corona Australis harbours [[RX J1856.5-3754]], an isolated [[neutron star]] that is thought to lie 140 (±40) parsecs, or 460 (±130) light years, away, with a diameter of 14&nbsp;km.{{sfn|Ho Wynn C. G. et al.|2007}} It was once suspected to be a [[Quark star#Strange star|strange star]],{{sfn|Drake, Jeremy J. et al.|2002}} but this has been discounted.{{sfn|Ho Wynn C. G. et al.|2007}}

=== Deep sky objects ===

[[File:R Coronae Australis region.jpg|The R Coronae Australis region imaged with the Wide Field Imager at [[ESO]]'s [[La Silla Observatory]]. According to ESO, "The light blue nebulosity seen in this picture is mostly due to the reflection of starlight off small dust particles." "A prominent dark lane crosses the image from the centre to the bottom left. Here the visible light emitted by the stars that are forming inside the cloud is completely absorbed by the dust. These objects could only be detected by observing at longer wavelengths, by using a camera that can detect infrared radiation."|right|thumb|300px]]

In the north of the constellation is the [[Corona Australis Molecular Cloud]], a dark [[molecular cloud]] with many embedded [[reflection nebula]]e,{{sfn|Kaler, ''Beta Coronae Australis''}} including [[NGC 6729]], [[NGC 6726]]–7, and [[IC 4812]].{{sfn|Malin|2010}} A [[star formation|star-forming region]] of around 7000 M<sub>☉</sub>,{{sfn|Kaler, ''Beta Coronae Australis''}} it contains [[Herbig–Haro object]]s ([[protostar]]s) and some very young stars.{{sfn|Malin|2010}} About 430 light years (130 parsecs) away, it is one of the closest star-forming regions to our solar system.{{sfn|Reipurth|2008|p=735}} The related NGC 6726 and 6727, along with unrelated NGC 6729, were first recorded by [[Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt]] in 1865.{{sfn|Steinicke|2010|p=176}}

[[R Coronae Australis]] is an irregular variable star ranging from magnitudes 9.7 to 13.9.{{refn|name=O'Meara 2002 pp273++}} Blue-white, it is of spectral type B5IIIpe.{{sfn|SIMBAD R Coronae Australis}} A very young star, it is still accumulating interstellar material.{{sfn|Malin|2010}} It is obscured by, and illuminates, the surrounding nebula, NGC 6729, which brightens and darkens with it.{{refn|name=O'Meara 2002 pp273++}} The nebula is often compared to a [[comet]] for its appearance in a telescope, as its length is five times its width.{{sfn|Bakich Podcast|25 June 2009}} [[S Coronae Australis]] is a G-class dwarf in the same field as R and is a [[T Tauri star]].{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1991|pp=254–255}} Nearby, another young variable star, [[TY Coronae Australis]], illuminates another nebula: reflection nebula NGC 6726–7. TY Coronae Australis ranges irregularly between magnitudes 8.7 and 12.4,and the brightness of the nebula varies with it.{{refn|name=O'Meara 2002 pp273++}} Blue-white, it is of spectral type B8e.{{sfn|SIMBAD TY Coronae Australis}} The largest young stars in the region, R, S, [[T|T Coronae Australis]], TY and [[VV Coronae Australis]], are all ejecting jets of material which cause surrounding dust and gas to coalesce and form Herbig–Haro objects, many of which have been identified nearby.{{sfn|Wang|Mundt|Henning|Apai|2004}} Lying adjacent to the nebulosity is the [[globular cluster]] known as [[NGC 6723]], which is actually in the neighbouring constellation of Sagittarius and is much much further away.{{refn|name=Coe 2007 p105}}

Near Epsilon and Gamma Coronae Australis is [[Bernes 157]], a [[dark nebula]] and star forming region. It is a large nebula, 55 by 18 arcminutes, that possesses several stars around magnitude 13. These stars have been dimmed by up to 8 magnitudes by its dust clouds.{{sfn|Bakich|2010|p=266}}

[[IC 1297]] is a [[planetary nebula]] of apparent magnitude 10.7, which appears as a green-hued roundish object in higher-powered amateur instruments.{{refn|name=Griffiths 2012 p132}} The nebula surrounds the variable star RU Coronae Australis, which has an average apparent magnitude of 12.9{{sfn|Moore, ''Data Book''|2000|pp=367–368}} and is a WC class [[Wolf–Rayet star]].{{sfn|SIMBAD RU Coronae Australis}} IC 1297 is small, at only 7 arcseconds in diameter; it has been described as "a square with rounded edges" in the eyepiece, elongated in the north-south direction.{{sfn|Bakich|2010|p=270}} Descriptions of its color encompass blue, blue-tinged green, and green-tinged blue.{{sfn|Bakich|2010|p=270}}

Corona Australis' location near the Milky Way means that galaxies are uncommonly seen. [[NGC 6768]] is a magnitude 11.2 object 35′ south of IC 1297. It is made up of two galaxies merging,{{sfn|Streicher|2008|pp=135–139}} one of which is an elongated [[elliptical galaxy]] of classification E4 and the other a [[lenticular galaxy]] of classification S0.{{sfn|NASA/IPAC NGC 6768}} [[IC 4808]] is a galaxy of apparent magnitude 12.9 located on the border of Corona Australis with the neighbouring constellation of Telescopium and 3.9 degrees west-southwest of [[Beta Sagittarii]]. However, amateur telescopes will only show a suggestion of its spiral structure. It is 1.9 arcminutes by 0.8 arcminutes. The central area of the galaxy does appear brighter in an amateur instrument, which shows it to be tilted northeast-southwest.{{sfn|Bakich Podcast|18 August 2011}}

Southeast of Theta and southwest of Eta lies the [[open cluster]] [[ESO 281-SC24]], which is composed of the yellow 9th magnitude star GSC 7914 178 1 and five 10th to 11th magnitude stars.{{sfn|Streicher|2008|pp=135–139}} Halfway between Theta Coronae Australis and [[Theta Scorpii]] is the dense globular cluster [[NGC 6541]]. Described as between magnitude 6.3{{refn|name=O'Meara 2002 pp273++}} and magnitude 6.6,{{sfn|Moore|Rees|2011|p=413}} it is visible in binoculars and small telescopes. Around 22000 light years away, it is around 100 light years in diameter.{{refn|name=O'Meara 2002 pp273++}} It is estimated to be around 14 billion years old.{{refn|name=O'Meara 2011 p322}} NGC 6541 appears 13.1 arcminutes in diameter and is somewhat resolvable in large amateur instruments; a 12-inch telescope reveals approximately 100 stars but the core remains unresolved.{{sfn|Bakich Podcast|5 July 2012}}

=== Meteor showers ===

The [[Corona Australids]] are a meteor shower that takes place between 14 and 18 March each year, peaking around 16 March.{{refn|name=Sherrod Koed 2003 p50}} This meteor shower does not have a high peak hourly rate. In 1953 and 1956, observers noted a maximum of 6 meteors per hour and 4 meteors per hour respectively; in 1955 the shower was "barely resolved".{{sfn|Weiss|1957|p=300}} However, in 1992, astronomers detected a peak rate of 45 meteors per hour.{{sfn|Rogers|Keay|1993|p=274}} The Corona Australids' rate varies from year to year.{{sfn|Weiss|1957|p=302}}{{sfn|Ellyett|Keay|1956|p=479}} At only six days, the shower's duration is particularly short,{{sfn|Rogers|Keay|1993|p=274}} and its [[meteoroid]]s are small; the stream is devoid of large meteoroids. The Corona Australids were first seen with the unaided eye in 1935 and first observed with [[radar]] in 1955.{{sfn|Ellyett|Keay|1956|p=479}} Corona Australid meteors have an entry velocity of 45 kilometers per second.{{sfn|Jenniskens|1994|p=1007}} In 2006, a shower originating near Beta Coronae Australis was designated as the Beta Coronae Australids. They appear in May, the same month as a nearby shower known as the May Microscopids, but the two showers have different trajectories and are unlikely to be related.{{sfn|Jopek et al.|2010|p=871–872}}

== History ==

{{see also|Corona Australis (Chinese astronomy)}}
[[File:Cororna Australis.jpg|thumb|right|Corona Australis depicted in the ''[[Atlas Coelestis]]'' of [[John Flamsteed]]]]

Corona Australis may have been recorded by ancient [[Mesopotamia]]ns in the [[MUL.APIN]], as a constellation called MA.GUR ("The Bark"). However, this constellation, adjacent to SUHUR.MASH ("The Goat-Fish", modern [[Capricornus (constellation)|Capricornus]]), may instead have been modern [[Epsilon Sagittarii]]. As a part of the southern sky, MA.GUR was one of the fifteen "stars of [[Ea (god)|Ea]]".{{sfn|Rogers|1998|p=19}}

In the 3rd century BC, the Greek [[Didacticism|didactic]] poet [[Aratus]] wrote of, but did not name the constellation,{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=83}} instead calling the two crowns Στεφάνοι (''Stephanoi''). The Greek astronomer [[Ptolemy]] described the constellation in the 2nd century AD, though with the inclusion of [[Alpha Telescopii]], since transferred to Telescopium.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Corona Australis}} Ascribing 13 stars to the constellation,{{refn|name=Malin Frew 1995 p218}} he named it Στεφάνος νοτιος (''Stephanos notios''), "Southern Wreath", while other authors associated it with either Sagittarius (having fallen off his head) or Centaurus; with the former, it was called ''Corona Sagittarii''.{{sfn|Allen|1963|pp=172–174}} Similarly, the Romans called Corona Australis the "Golden Crown of Sagittarius".{{sfn|Simpson|2012|p=148}} It was known as ''Parvum Coelum'' ("Canopy", "Little Sky") in the 5th century.{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1988|p=254}} The 18th-century French astronomer [[Jérôme Lalande]] gave it the names ''Sertum Australe'' ("Southern Garland"){{sfn|Allen|1963|pp=172–174}}{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1988|p=254}} and ''Orbiculus Capitis'', while German poet and author [[Philipp von Zesen|Philippus Caesius]] called it ''Corolla'' ("Little Crown") or ''Spira Australis'' ("Southern Coil"), and linked it with the Crown of Eternal Life from the New Testament. Seventeenth-century celestial cartographer [[Julius Schiller]] linked it to the Diadem of Solomon.{{sfn|Allen|1963|pp=172–174}}<!-- cites previous three sentences --> Sometimes, Corona Australis was not the wreath of Sagittarius but arrows held in his hand.{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1988|p=254}}

Corona Australis has been associated with the myth of [[Bacchus]] and [[Semele]]. [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] had impregnated Semele, causing [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] to become jealous. Juno convinced Semele to ask Jupiter to appear in his full splendor, which the mortal woman could not handle, causing her to burn. After Bacchus, Semele's unborn child, became an adult and the god of wine, he honored his deceased mother by placing a wreath in the sky.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=232–233}}

In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Corona Australis are located within the [[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|Black Tortoise of the North]] (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ'').{{sfn|AEEA|2006}} The constellation itself was known as ''ti'en pieh'' ("Heavenly Turtle") and during the [[Western Zhou]] period, marked the beginning of winter. However, [[Axial precession|precession]] over time has meant that the "Heavenly River" ([[Milky Way]]) became the more accurate marker to the ancient Chinese and hence supplanted the turtle in this role.{{refn|name=Porter 1996 pp35–36}} Arabic names for Corona Australis include ''Al Ķubbah'' "the Tortoise", ''Al Ĥibā'' "the Tent" or ''Al Udḥā al Na'ām'' "the Ostrich Nest".{{sfn|Allen|1963|pp=172–174}}{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1988|p=254}} It was later given the name ''Al Iklīl al Janūbiyyah'', which the European authors [[Edmund Chilmead|Chilmead]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Riccioli]] and Caesius transliterated as Alachil Elgenubi, Elkleil Elgenubi and Aladil Algenubi respectively.{{sfn|Allen|1963|pp=172–174}}

The [[ǀXam language|ǀXam]] speaking [[Bushmen]] of South Africa knew the constellation as ''≠nabbe ta !nu'' "house of branches"—owned originally by the Dassie ([[rock hyrax]]), and the star pattern depicting people sitting in a semicircle around a fire.{{sfn|Lloyd|1873}}

The indigenous Boorong people of northwestern Victoria saw it as ''Won'', a boomerang thrown by ''Totyarguil'' ([[Altair]]).{{sfn|Hamacher|Frew|2010}} The [[Aranda people]] of Central Australia saw Corona Australis as a [[Coolamon (vessel)|coolamon]] carrying a baby, which was accidentally dropped to earth by a group of sky-women dancing in the Milky Way. The impact of the coolamon created [[Gosses Bluff crater]], 175&nbsp;km west of [[Alice Springs]].{{sfn|Hamacher|28 March 2011}} The [[Torres Strait Islanders]] saw Corona Australis as part of a larger constellation encompassing part of Sagittarius and the tip of [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]]'s tail; the [[Pleiades]] and [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] were also associated. This constellation was [[Tagai]]'s canoe, crewed by the Pleiades, called the ''Usiam'', and Orion, called the ''Seg''. The myth of Tagai says that he was in charge of this canoe, but his crewmen consumed all of the supplies onboard without asking permission. Enraged, Tagai bound the Usiam with a rope and tied them to the side of the boat, then threw them overboard. Scorpius's tail represents a [[Remora|suckerfish]], while [[Eta Sagittarii]] and Theta Coronae Australis mark the bottom of the canoe.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=223–224}} On the island of [[Futuna (Wallis and Futuna)|Futuna]], the figure of Corona Australis was called ''Tanuma'' and in the [[Tuamotus]], it was called ''Na Kaua-ki-Tonga''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=281}}
