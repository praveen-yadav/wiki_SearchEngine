'''Algol''' ('''Beta&nbsp;Per''', '''β&nbsp;Persei''', '''β&nbsp;Per'''), known colloquially as the '''Demon Star''', is a bright [[star]] in the [[constellation]] [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]].  It is one of the best known [[eclipsing binary|eclipsing binaries]], the first such star to be discovered, and also one of the first (non-[[nova]]) [[variable star]]s  to be discovered. Algol is actually a three-star system (Beta Persei&nbsp;A, B, and&nbsp;C) in which the large and bright primary Beta Persei&nbsp;A is regularly eclipsed by the dimmer Beta Persei&nbsp;B. Thus, Algol's [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] is usually near-constant at&nbsp;2.1, but regularly dips to 3.4 every two days, 20&nbsp;hours and 49&nbsp;minutes during the roughly 10-hour long partial eclipses. There is also a secondary eclipse (the "second minimum") when the brighter star [[occultation|occults]] the fainter secondary. This secondary eclipse can only be detected photoelectrically.<ref>Beta Persei, American Association of Variable Star Observers.  http://www.aavso.org/vstar/vsots/0199.shtml{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> Algol gives its name to its class of eclipsing variable, known as [[Algol variable]]s.

==Observation history==
The association of Algol with a demon-like creature ([[Gorgon]] in the Greek tradition, [[ghoul]] in the Arabic tradition) suggests that its variability was known long before the 17th century,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wilk, Stephen R.| title=Mythological Evidence for Ancient Observations of Variable Stars |journal=The Journal of the American Association of Variable Star Observers  |volume= 24 |issue=2 |year=1996 |pages=129–33 |bibcode=1996JAVSO..24..129W |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996JAVSO..24..129W ADS|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1996JAVSO..24..129W&amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;type=PRINTER&amp;filetype=.pdf}}</ref> but there is still no indisputable evidence for this.<ref>G.A.&nbsp;Davis, "Why did the Arabs Call Beta Persei "al-Ghul"?", ''Sky and Telescope'', '''16''' (1957), 177 [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1957S%26T....16..177D ADS].</ref> Investigating a calendar for lucky and unlucky days composed in Egypt some 3200 years ago, scholars have noted a significant periodicity of 2.85 days and several empirical tests indicate that this periodicity may be connected to Algol.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Porceddu, S., Jetsu, L., Lyytinen, J., Kajatkari, P., Lehtinen, J., Markkanen, T, Toivari-Viitala, J.|title=Evidence of Periodicity in Ancient Egyptian Calendars of Lucky and Unlucky Days|journal = Cambridge Archaeological Journal|volume =18|issue=3|year = 2008|pages = 327-339|doi=10.1017/S0959774308000395|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=2374180}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Jetsu, L., Porceddu, S., Lyytinen, J., Kajatkari, P., Lehtinen, J., Markkanen, T, Toivari-Viitala, J.|title=Did the Ancient Egyptians Record the Period of the Eclipsing Binary Algol - The Raging One? |journal = The Astrophysical Journal|volume =773|issue=1|year = 2013|pages = A1 (14pp)|doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/773/1/1| url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...773....1J}}</ref>

The variability of Algol was first unambiguously recorded in 1667 by [[Geminiano Montanari]],<ref>G.&nbsp;Montanari, "Sopra la sparizione d'alcune stelle et altre novità celesti", in: ''Prose de Signori Accademici Gelati di Bologna'' (Bologna: Manolessi, 1671), pp.&nbsp;369-392 ([http://books.google.com/books?id=TfgLF4-BsqEC Google books]).</ref> but the periodic nature of its variations in brightness was not recognized until more than a century later, when the British amateur astronomer [[John Goodricke]] also proposed a mechanism for the star's variability.<ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1957Obs....77..191E ADS O.J.&nbsp;Eggen,"An Eighteenth Century Discussion of Algol", ''The Observatory'', '''77''' (1957), 191-197].</ref> In May 1783 he presented his findings to the [[Royal Society]], suggesting that the periodic variability was caused by a dark body passing in front of the star (or else that the star itself has a darker region that is periodically turned toward the Earth.) For his report he was awarded the [[Copley Medal]].<ref>{{cite web | date = 6 August 2003 | url = http://www.surveyor.in-berlin.de/himmel/Bios/Goodricke-e.html | title = John Goodricke, The Discovery of the Occultating Variable Stars  | accessdate = 31 July 2006 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060622004628/http://www.surveyor.in-berlin.de/himmel/Bios/Goodricke-e.html| archivedate= 22 June 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 1881, the Harvard astronomer [[Edward Charles Pickering]] presented evidence that Algol was actually an eclipsing binary.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pickering | first = Edward C. | title=Dimensions of the Fixed Stars, with especial reference to Binaries and Variables of the Algol type | journal=Astronomical register | year=1881 | pages=253–56 | bibcode=1881AReg...19..253. | issue = 1-2 | doi= | volume=50}}</ref> This was confirmed a few years later, in 1889, when the Potsdam astronomer [[Hermann Carl Vogel]] found periodic [[doppler shift]]s in the spectrum of Algol, inferring variations in the [[radial velocity]] of this binary system.<ref>{{cite journal | author = A. H. Batten | title=Two Centuries of Study of Algol Systems | journal=Space Science Reviews  | year=1989 | volume=50 | issue=1/2 | pages=1–8 | bibcode=1989SSRv...50....1B  | doi = 10.1007/BF00215914 }}</ref> Thus Algol became one of the first known [[spectroscopic binary|spectroscopic binaries]]. Dr. [[Joel Stebbins]] at the [[University of Illinois Observatory]] used an early selenium cell photometer to produce the first-ever photoelectric study of a variable star. The light curve revealed the second minimum and the reflection effect between the two stars.<ref>{{cite journal | author = J. Stebbins | title = The Measurement of the Light of Stars with a Selenium Photometer with an Application to the Variation of Algol |journal= Astrophysical Journal | year=1910 | volume=32 | pages=65–80}}</ref>
Some difficulties in explaining the observed spectroscopic features led to the conjecture that a third star may be present in the system; four decades later this conjecture was found to be correct.<ref>Meltzer, Alan S., A "Spectroscopic Investigation of Algol". ''Astrophysical Journal'', vol. 125, (1957), p.359, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1957ApJ...125..359M BibCode:1957ApJ...125..359M]</ref>

==System==
[[File:Algol AB movie imaged with the CHARA interferometer - labeled.gif|thumb|left|Algol B orbits Algol A. This animation was assembled from 55 images of the CHARA interferometer in the near-infrared H-band, sorted according to orbital phase. Because some phases are poorly covered, B jumps at some points along its path.]]

From the point of view of the Earth, Algol&nbsp;A and Algol&nbsp;B form an [[eclipsing binary]] because their [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] contains the  [[line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] to the Earth. To be more precise, Algol is a triple-star system: the eclipsing binary pair is separated by only 0.062&nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s (AU) from each other, whereas the third star in the system (Algol&nbsp;C) is at an average distance of 2.69&nbsp;AU from the pair, and the mutual [[orbital period]] of the trio is 681&nbsp;Earth days. The total mass of the system is about 5.8 solar masses, and the mass ratios of A, B and C are about 4.5 to 1 to 2.

Studies of Algol led to the '''[[Algol paradox]]''' in the theory of [[stellar evolution]]: although components of a binary star form at the same time, and massive stars evolve much faster than the less massive ones, it was observed that the more massive component Algol&nbsp;A is still in the [[main sequence]], while the less massive Algol&nbsp;B is a [[subgiant star]] at a later evolutionary stage. The paradox can be solved by [[mass transfer]]: when the more massive star became a subgiant, it filled its [[Roche lobe]], and most of the mass was transferred to the other star, which is still in the main sequence. In some binaries similar to Algol, a gas flow can be seen.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Izold | last=Pustylnik | title=On Accretion Component of the Flare Activity in Algol | journal=Baltic Astronomy | year=1995 | volume=4 | issue=1-2 | pages=64–78 | bibcode=1995BaltA...4...64P | doi= }}</ref>

This system also exhibits variable activities in the forms of [[x-ray]] and [[radio wave]] flares. The former is thought to be caused by the magnetic fields of the A and B components interacting with the mass transfer.<ref>{{cite journal | author=M.J. Sarna, S.K. Yerli, A.G.

Algol is located about 92.8&nbsp;[[light year]]s from the Sun, but about 7.3&nbsp;million years ago it passed within 9.8&nbsp;light years of the [[Solar System]]<ref>{{cite conference

Because the total mass of the Algol system is about 5.8&nbsp;solar masses, at the closest approach this might have given enough [[gravity]] to [[perturbation|perturb]] the [[Oort cloud]] of the Solar System somewhat and hence increase the number of [[comet]]s entering the inner solar system. However, the actual increase in net cometary collisions is thought to have been quite small.<ref>{{cite journal | author = J. García-Sánchez, R.A. Preston, D.L. Jones, P.R.

==Names==

The name ''Algol'' derives from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] '''رأس الغول''' ''ra's al-ghūl'' : head (ra's) of the ogre (al-ghūl) (see "[[ghoul]]").<ref>P.&nbsp;Kunitzsch & T.&nbsp;Smart, ''Short Guide to Modern Star Names and Their Derivations'' (Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1986), p 49.</ref> The English name "''Demon Star''" is a direct translation of this.<ref name=allen1899>{{cite book

In Hebrew folklore, Algol was called ''Rōsh ha Sāṭān'' or "Satan's Head", as stated by [[Edmund Chilmead]], who called it "Divels head" or ''Rosch hassatan''. A [[Latin]] name for Algol from the 16th century was ''Caput Larvae'' or "the Spectre's Head". Algol was also linked with "[[Lilith]]".<ref name=allen1899/> [[Hipparchus]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] made this a separate, though connected, constellation.<ref name=allen1899/>

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], {{lang|zh|大陵}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|Dà Líng}}), meaning ''[[Stomach (Chinese constellation)|Mausoleum]]'', refers to an asterism consisting of β Persei, [[9 Persei]], [[Tau Persei|τ Persei]], [[Iota Persei|ι Persei]], [[Kappa Persei|κ Persei]], [[Rho Persei|ρ Persei]], [[16 Persei]] and [[12 Persei]]. Consequently, β Persei itself is known as {{lang|zh|大陵五}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|Dà Líng wu}}, {{lang-en|the Fifth Star of Mausoleum}}.).<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060711.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 11 日]</ref> According to R.H. Allen the star bore the grim name of ''Tseih She'' {{lang|zh|叠尸}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|Dié Shī}}), meaning "Piled up Corpses"<ref name=allen1899/> but this appears to be a misidentification.<ref>[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/perseus.htm#chinese Ian Ridpath's ''Star Tales'' – Perseus]</ref>

Historically, the star has received a strong association with bloody violence across a wide variety of cultures. In the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', the 2nd-century astrological text of the Alexandrian astronomer [[Ptolemy]], Algol is referred to as "the [[Gorgon]] of [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]]" and associated with death by decapitation: a theme which mirrors the myth of the hero [[Perseus]]’ victory over the snake-haired [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]].<ref>Robbins, Frank E.
