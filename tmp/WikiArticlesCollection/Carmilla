'''''Carmilla''''' is a [[Gothic novel]]la by [[Sheridan Le Fanu|Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu]]. First published in 1872, it tells the story of a young woman's susceptibility to the attentions of a female [[vampire]] named Carmilla. ''Carmilla'' predates [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' by 25 years, and has been adapted many times for cinema.[[Image:carmilla.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration from ''The Dark Blue'' by [[D. H. Friston]], 1872]]

==Publication==
{{Wikisource}}
''Carmilla'' was first published in the magazine ''The Dark Blue'' in late 1871 and early 1872<ref>The story ran in one issue of 1871 (December, pp. 434–448) and in three issues of 1872 (January, pp. 592–606; February, pp. 701–714; and March, pp. 59–78).</ref> and then in the author's collection of short stories ''[[In a Glass Darkly]]'' in the latter year.

There were two [[illustrators]] for the story, the work of which appeared in the magazine but does not appear in modern printings of the book. The two illustrators, [[David Henry Friston]] and Michael Fitzgerald, show some inconsistencies in their depiction of the characters, and as a result some confusion has arisen in relating the pictures to the story's continuous plot.

==Plot summary==
The story is presented by Le Fanu as part of the casebook of Dr. Hesselius, whose departures from medical orthodoxy rank him as the first [[occult doctor]] in literature.<ref>[http://www.gwthomas.org/hesselius.htm Dr Martin Hesselius]</ref> The story is narrated by Laura, one of the two main protagonists of the tale.

Laura begins her tale by relating her childhood in a "picturesque and solitary" castle in the midst of an extensive forest in [[Styria]], where she lives with her father, a wealthy [[English people|English]] widower, retired from the Austrian Service. When she was six years old, Laura had a vision of a beautiful visitor in her bedchamber. She later claims to have been bitten on the chest, although no wounds are found on her.

12 years later, Laura and her father are admiring the sunset in front of the castle when her father tells her of a letter he received earlier from his friend, General Spielsdorf. The General was supposed to bring his niece, Bertha Rheinfeldt, to visit the two, but the niece suddenly died under mysterious circumstances. The General ambiguously concludes that he will discuss the circumstances in detail when they meet later.

Laura is saddened by the loss of a potential friend, and longs for a companion. A carriage accident outside Laura's home unexpectedly brings a girl of Laura's age into the family's care. Her name is Carmilla. Both girls instantly recognize the other from the "dream" they both had when they were young.

Carmilla appears injured after her carriage accident, but her mysterious mother informs Laura's father that her journey is urgent and cannot be delayed. She arranges to leave her daughter with Laura and her father until she can return in three months. Before she leaves, she sternly notes that her daughter will not disclose any information whatsoever about her family, past or herself, and that Carmilla is of sound mind. Laura comments that this information seems needless to say, and her father laughs it off.

Carmilla and Laura grow to be very close friends, but occasionally Carmilla's mood abruptly changes. She sometimes makes unsettling romantic advances towards Laura. Carmilla refuses to tell anything about herself or her background, despite questioning from Laura. Her secrecy isn't the only mysterious thing about her. Carmilla sleeps much of the day, and seems to sleepwalk at night. When a funeral procession passes by the two girls and Laura begins singing a hymn, Carmilla bursts out in rage and scolds Laura for singing a Christian song. When a shipment of family heirloom restored portraits arrives at the castle, Laura finds one of her ancestors, "Mircalla, [[Count]]ess Karnstein", dated 1698. The portrait resembles Carmilla exactly, down to the mole on her neck.

During Carmilla's stay, Laura has nightmares of a fiendish cat-like beast entering her room at night and biting her on the chest. The beast then takes the form of a female figure and disappears through the door without opening it. Laura's health declines and her father has a doctor examine her. He speaks privately with her father and only asks that Laura never be left unattended.

Her father then sets out with Laura in a carriage for the ruined village of Karnstein. They leave a message behind asking Carmilla and one of the governesses entreated to follow after once the perpetually late-sleeping Carmilla wakes up. En route to Karnstein, Laura and her father encounter General Spielsdorf. He tells them his own ghastly story.

Spielsdorf and his niece had met a young woman named Millarca and her enigmatic mother at a costume ball. The General's niece was immediately taken with Millarca. The mother convinced the General that she was an old friend of his and asked that Millarca be allowed to stay with them for three weeks while she attended to a secret matter of great importance.

[[Image:Fitzgerald, funeral from Carmilla.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Funeral'', illustration by Michael Fitzgerald for ''Carmilla'' in ''The Dark Blue'', January 1872]]

The General's niece fell mysteriously ill and suffered exactly the same symptoms as Laura. After consulting with a priestly doctor who he had specially ordered, the General came to the realization that his niece was being visited by a vampire. He hid in a closet with a sword and waited until seeing a fiendish cat-like creature stalk around his niece's bedroom and bite her on the neck. He then leapt from his hiding place and attacked the beast, which took the form of Millarca. She fled through the locked door, unharmed. The General's niece died immediately afterward.

When they arrive at Karnstein, the General asks a nearby woodsman where he can find the tomb of Mircalla Karnstein. The woodsman relates that the tomb was relocated long ago by the hero who vanquished the vampires that haunted the region.

While the General and Laura are left alone in the ruined chapel, Carmilla appears. The General and Carmilla both fly into a rage upon seeing each other and the General attacks her with an axe. Carmilla flees and the General explains to Laura that Carmilla is also Millarca, both anagrams for the original name of the vampire Countess Mircalla Karnstein.

The party is then joined by Baron Vordenburg, the descendant of the hero who rid the area of vampires long ago. Vordenburg is an authority on vampires and has discovered that his ancestor was romantically involved with the Countess Karnstein, before she died and became one of the undead. Using his forefather's notes, he locates the hidden tomb of Carmilla. An imperial commission is then summoned, who exhume and destroy the body of the vampire on behalf of the ruling [[Habsburg Monarchy]], within whose domains Styria is situated.

Afterwards, Laura's father takes her on a year-long vacation to recover from the trauma and regain her health.

==Sources==
As with ''[[Dracula]]'', critics have looked for the sources used in the writing of the text. Matthew Gibson proposes that Le Fanu used [[Antoine Augustin Calmet|Dom Augustin Calmet's]] ''Dissertations sur les apparitions des anges, des demons et des esprits, et sur les revenants et vampires de Hongrie, de Boheme, de Moravie, et de Silesie'' (1746),<ref>Calmet, Antoine Augustin. (1746). [http://archive.org/details/dissertationssu00conggoog ''Dissertations sur les apparitions des anges, des demons et des esprits, et sur les revenants et vampires de Hongrie, de Boheme, de Moravie, et de Silesie.''] Paris: De Bure l'aîné</ref> which was first anonymously translated into English in a single volume in 1759 as ''Dissertations Upon the Apparitions of Angels, Daemons, and Ghosts, and Concerning the Vampires of Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia,''<ref>Calmet, Antoine Augustin. (1759). ''Dissertations Upon the Apparitions of Angels, Daemons, and Ghosts, and Concerning the Vampires of Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia.'' (Anonymous, Trans.). London: M. Cooper</ref> and later translated into English in 1850 in two volumes as ''The phantom world, or, The philosophy of spirits, apparitions, &c.''<ref>Calmet, Antoine Augustin. (1850). ''The phantom world, or, The philosophy of spirits, apparitions, &c.'' (Henry Christmas, Trans.). London: Richard Bentley [http://archive.org/details/phantomworldorp00calmgoog ''Vol. 1 ''] [http://archive.org/details/phantomworldorp02calmgoog ''Vol. 2'']</ref> Gibson also believes that [[Sabine Baring-Gould|the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould]]'s ''The Book of Were-wolves'' (1863), and his account of [[Elizabeth Báthory]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''Christabel'', and Captain [[Basil Hall]]'s ''[[Schloss]] [[Hainfeld]]; or a Winter in [[Lower Styria]]'' (London and Edinburgh, 1836) are other sources for Le Fanu's work. Hall's account provides much of the Styrian background and in particular a model for both Carmilla and Laura in the figure of [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall|Jane Anne Cranstoun, Countess Purgstall]].<ref>Gibson, Matthew. [http://www.jslefanu.com/gibson.html ''Jane Cranstoun, Countess Purgstall: A Possible Inspiration for Le Fanu's “CARMILLA”]'' in ''Le Fanu Studies'', November 2007, ISSN 1932-9598</ref><ref>Gibson, Matthew (2006). ''Dracula and the Eastern Question: British and French Vampire Narratives of the Nineteenth-century Near East'', ISBN 1-4039-9477-3 & ISBN 1-4039-9477-3</ref>

==Influence==
Carmilla, the title character, is the original prototype for a legion of female and [[lesbian vampire]]s. Though Le Fanu portrays his vampire's [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] with the circumspection that one would expect for his time, it is evident that [[lesbian]] attraction is the main dynamic between Carmilla and the narrator of the story:

{{quotation|Sometimes after an hour of apathy, my strange and beautiful companion would take my hand and hold it with a fond pressure, renewed again and again; blushing softly, gazing in my face with languid and burning eyes, and breathing so fast that her dress rose and fell with the tumultuous respiration. It was like the ardour of a lover; it embarrassed me; it was hateful and yet overpowering; and with gloating eyes she drew me to her, and her hot lips travelled along my cheek in kisses; and she would whisper, almost in sobs, "You are mine, you ''shall'' be mine, and you and I are one for ever". ''("Carmilla", Chapter 4)''.}}

When compared to other literary vampires of the 19th century, Carmilla is a similar product of a culture with strict sexual mores and tangible religious fear. While Carmilla selected exclusively female victims, she only becomes emotionally involved with a few. Carmilla had [[nocturnal]] habits, but was not confined to the darkness. She had unearthly beauty and was able to change her form and to pass through solid walls. Her animal alter ego was a monstrous black cat, not a large dog as in ''Dracula''. She did, however, sleep in a coffin. Carmilla works as a gothic horror story because her victims are portrayed as succumbing to a perverse and unholy temptation that has severe metaphysical consequences for them.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Auerbach |first=Nina |title=Our Vampires, Ourselves |publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press |year=1995 |location= |page=42 |}}  ISBN 0-2260-3202-7</ref>

Some critics, among them [[William Veeder]], suggest that ''Carmilla'', notably in its outlandish use of narrative frames, was an important influence on [[Henry James]]' ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]''.

===Bram Stoker's ''Dracula''===
Although ''Carmilla'' is a lesser known and far shorter Gothic vampire story than the generally-considered master work of that genre, ''Dracula'', the latter is heavily influenced by Le Fanu's short story.

In the earliest manuscript of ''Dracula'', dated 8 March 1890, the castle is set in [[Styria]], although the setting was changed to [[Transylvania]] six days later. Stoker's posthumously published [[short story]] "[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories|Dracula's Guest]]", known as the deleted first chapter to ''Dracula'', shows a more obvious and intact debt to "Carmilla": Both stories are told in the [[first-person narrative|first person]]. ''Dracula'' expands on the idea of a first person account by creating a series of journal entries and logs of different persons and creating a plausible background story for them having been compiled. Stoker also indulges the air of mystery further than Le Fanu by allowing the characters to solve the enigma of the vampire along with the reader.

The descriptions of Carmilla and the character of Lucy in ''Dracula'' are similar, and have become archetypes for the appearance of the waif-like victims and seducers in vampire stories as being tall, slender, languid, and with large eyes, full lips and soft voices. Both women also [[Sleepwalking|sleepwalk]].

Stoker's Dr. [[Abraham Van Helsing]] is a direct parallel to Le Fanu's vampire expert Baron Vordenburg: both characters used to investigate and catalyse actions in opposition to the vampire, and symbolically represent knowledge of the unknown and stability of mind in the onslaught of chaos and death.<ref>"Le Fanu, J.S." in Jack Sullivan (ed) ''The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural'': 260</ref>

==In popular culture==

===Films===
*[[Danes|Danish]] director [[Carl Dreyer]] loosely adapted ''Carmilla'' for his 1932 film ''[[Vampyr]]'' but deleted any references to lesbian sexuality.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Grant |first=Barry Keith |authorlink= |last2=Sharrett |first2=Christopher |author2-link= |title=Planks of Reason: Essays on the Horror Film |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2004 |location= |page=73 |url =http://books.google.com/books?id=QHg7m_ESR54C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=0-8108-5013-3}}</ref> The credits of the original film say that the film is based on ''In A Glass Darkly''. This collection contains five tales, one of which is "Carmilla". Actually the film draws its central character, Allan Gray, from Le Fanu's Dr. Hesselius; and the scene in which Gray is buried alive is drawn from "The Room in the Dragon Volant".
*[[French people|French]] director [[Roger Vadim]]'s ''[[Blood and Roses|Et mourir de plaisir]]'' (literally ''And to die of pleasure'', but actually shown in England as ''Blood and Roses'', 1960) is based on ''Carmilla'' and is considered one of the greatest of the vampire genre. The Vadim film thoroughly explores the lesbian implications behind Carmilla's selection of victims, and boasts cinematography by [[Claude Renoir]]. The film's lesbian eroticism was however significantly cut for its US release. [[Mel Ferrer]] stars in the film.
*A more-or-less faithful adaptation starring [[Christopher Lee]] was produced in Italy in 1964 under the title ''[[La cripta e l'incubo]]'' (''Crypt of the Vampire'' in English). The character of Laura is played by Adriana Ambesi, who is possessed by the spirit of a dead ancestor, Carmilla. 
*The British [[Hammer Film Productions]] also produced a fairly faithful adaptation of "Carmilla" titled ''[[The Vampire Lovers]]'' (1970) with [[Ingrid Pitt]] in the lead role, [[Madeline Smith]] as her victim/lover and Hammer's regular [[Peter Cushing]]. It is the first installment of the [[Karnstein Trilogy]].
*''[[The Blood Spattered Bride]]'' (''La Novia Ensangrentada'') is a 1972 Spanish [[Horror film|horror]] [[film]] written and directed by [[Vicente Aranda]], is based on the text. The film has reached cult status for its mix of horror, vampirism and seduction with lesbian overtones.
*''Carmilla'' (1980) is a black-and-white television adaptation from Poland, starring singer [[Izabela Trojanowska]] in the title role, and Monika Stefanowicz as Laura.
*In 1989, [[Gabrielle Beaumont]] also adapted Carmilla into a medium length film with [[Meg Tilly]] as the vampiress.
*In the 2005 direct-to-video movie, ''[[The Batman vs. Dracula]]'', Carmilla Karnstein is referenced of being [[Count Dracula]]'s bride, who had been incinerated by sunlight years ago. Dracula hoped to revive her by sacrificing [[Vicki Vale]]'s soul, but the ritual was stopped by the [[Batman]].
*Carmilla is featured as the main antagonist in the 2009 movie ''[[Lesbian Vampire Killers]]'', a comedy starring [[Paul McGann]] and [[James Corden]].
*Styria (2013) is an adaptation of the novel set in late 1980s with Julia Pietrucha as Carmilla and Eleanor Tomlinson as Lara.

===Radio===
*The character of Dr. Hesselius is featured in a [[Mutual Broadcasting Network]] radio drama entitled "[[The Shadow People (radio drama)|The Shadow People]]", an episode from ''[[The Hall of Fantasy]]'' series (1946–1947, 1949–1952, 1952, 1953). The episode casts Dr. Hesselius as an occult sleuth and aired on September 5, 1952.
*On November 20, 1981, the [[CBC Radio]] series ''[[Nightfall (CBC)|Nightfall]]'' aired an adaptation of ''Carmilla'' written by [[Graham Pomeroy]] and [[John Gavin Douglas|John Douglas]].

===Music===
*[[Cradle of Filth]], a popular British [[extreme metal]] band, has produced an album called ''[[Dusk... and Her Embrace]]'', largely inspired by ''Carmilla'' and Le Fanu's writings in general, and have also recorded an instrumental track titled "Carmilla's Masque". The lyric "Portrait of the Dead Countess" in the track "A Gothic Romance" could be in reference to the portrait found in the novel of the Countess Mircalla. There is also a track on the accompanying EP ''[[V Empire or Dark Faerytales in Phallustein]]'' titled "Queen of Winter, Throned", which contains the lyrics: "Iniquitous/I share Carmilla's mask/A gaunt mephitic voyeur/On the black side of the glass". Lead singer [[Dani Filth]] has often cited [[Sheridan Le Fanu]] as an inspiration to his lyrics.
*[[Theatres des Vampires]], an Italian [[extreme gothic metal]] band, has produced a video single called "Carmilla" for its album ''[[Moonlight Waltz]]''.
*A [[chamber opera]] version of ''Carmilla'' appeared in 1970 (''Carmilla: A Vampire Tale'', music by Ben Johnston, script by Wilford Leach). Seated on a sofa, Laura and Carmilla recount the story retrospectively in song.
*The 1980s band [[LaHost]]'s track on the 1985 [[EMI]] compilation album 'Fire in Harmony' was 'Blood and Roses' - the lyrics of which are loosely based on the [[Roger Corman]] film version of Carmilla.

===Books===
*A vampire named Baron Karnstein appears in ''[[Anno Dracula series#Anno Dracula|Anno Dracula]]'' by [[Kim Newman]]. Carmilla herself is mentioned several times as a former (until her death at the hands of vampire hunters) friend of the book's vampire heroine Geneviève. Some short stories set in the ''Anno Dracula'' universe have also included Carmilla.
*The character of Camille in [[Cassandra Clare]]'s ''Mortal Instruments'' series may be based on Carmilla, given the similarity in their names and descriptions.
*In the Japanese [[light novel]] series [[High School DxD]] the vampires are depicted as having a society divided among two major factions: The Tepes and the Carmilla. The Carmilla faction favors a matriarchal society for the world of vampires while the Tepes prefer a patriarchal government.
*[[Elfriede Jelinek]]'s play ''[[Illness or Modern Women]]'' uses ''Carmilla'' as the name of one of its female protagonists, who becomes a vampire. In the play, a woman, Emily, transforms another woman, Carmilla, into a vampire, and both become lesbians and join together to drink the blood of children.
*Author [[Anne Rice]] has cited ''Carmilla'' as an inspiration for [[The Vampire Chronicles]]; a series of bestselling vampire books she wrote from 1976-2003.
*The novel Carmilla: The Wolves of Styria is a re-imagining of the original story. It is a derivative re-working, listed as being  authored by [[J.S. Le Fanu]] and David Brian, and involves a number of changes to the original story, including the introduction of werewolves into the plot.
*Carmilla: The Return by Kyle Marffin is the sequel of Carmilla.

===Comics===
* In 1991, Aircel Comics published a six-issue black and white miniseries of ''Carmilla'' by Steven Jones and [[John Ross (artist)|John Ross]]. It was based on the story by Sheridan Le Fanu and billed as "The Erotic Horror Classic of Female Vampirism". The first issue was printed in February 1991. The first three issues were an adaptation of the original story, while the latter three were a sequel set in the 1930s.<ref>[http://fuziondigital.com/SPJ/creditscomics.htm Steven Philip Jones Previous Credits in comics]</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=28117 The Grand Comics Database Team: Carmilla (1991 Series)]</ref>
