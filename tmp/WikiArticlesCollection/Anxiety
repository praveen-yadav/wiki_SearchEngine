Anxiety is a [[Mood (psychology)|mood]]. When it becomes a [[mental disorder]], that is, characterized by excessive, uncontrollable and often irrational worry about everyday things that is disproportionate to the actual source of worry, it is diagnosed as [[generalized anxiety disorder]] (GAD). GAD occurs without an identifiable triggering [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]]. It is called generalized because the remorseless worries are not focused on any specific<ref name="Natalie Hochoy">{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel L |title=Psychology |edition=2nd |year=2011 |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=New York |isbn=978–1-4292–3719–2 |page=559}}</ref> threat; they are, in fact, often exaggerated and irrational. It is distinguished from [[fear]], which is an appropriate cognitive and emotional response to a perceived threat and is related to the specific behaviors of [[fight-or-flight response]]s, defensive behavior or escape. Anxiety occurs in situations only perceived as uncontrollable or unavoidable, but not realistically so.<ref>{{cite book |last=Öhman |first=Arne |year=2000 |chapter=Fear and anxiety: Evolutionary, cognitive, and clinical perspectives |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Lewis |editor2-first=Jeannette M.  |editor2-last=Haviland-Jones |title=Handbook of emotions |pages=573–93 |location=New York |publisher=The Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-529-8}}</ref> David Barlow defines anxiety as "a future-oriented mood state in which one is ready or prepared to attempt to cope with upcoming negative events,"<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.55.11.1247 |title=Unraveling the mysteries of anxiety and its disorders from the perspective of emotion theory |year=2000 |last1=Barlow |first1=David H. |journal=American Psychologist |volume=55 |issue=11 |pages=1247–63 |pmid=11280938}}</ref> and that it is a distinction between future and present dangers which divides anxiety and fear.

Fear is defined as short lived, present focused, geared towards a specific threat, and facilitating escape from threat; while anxiety is defined as long acting, future focused, broadly focused towards a diffuse threat, and promoting excessive caution while approaching a potential threat and interferes with constructive coping. While almost everyone has experienced anxiety at some point in their lives, most do not develop long-term problems with anxiety. If long term or severe problems with anxiety develop, such problems are classified as an [[Anxiety disorder]]. Symptoms of anxiety can range in number, intensity, and frequency, depending on the person.
 
Subtypes of anxiety disorders are [[phobia]]s, [[social anxiety]], [[obsessive-compulsive]] behavior, and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]].<ref name="Henig"/> The physical effects of anxiety may include [[heart palpitations]], [[tachycardia]], [[muscle weakness]] and tension, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[nausea]], [[chest pain]], [[shortness of breath]], [[headache]], [[stomach aches]], or [[tension headache]]s. As the body prepares to deal with a threat, blood pressure, heart rate, perspiration, blood flow to the major muscle groups are increased, while [[immune system|immune]] and [[Digestion|digestive]] functions are inhibited (the ''[[fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]]'' response). External signs of anxiety may include [[pallor]], sweating, trembling, and [[mydriasis|pupillary dilation]]. For someone who suffers anxiety this can lead to a [[panic attack]]. [[Sir Aubrey Lewis]] even suggests that "anxiety" could be defined as agony, dread, terror, or even apprehension.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Susan |last1=Iacovou |month=July |year=2011 |title=What is the Difference Between Existential Anxiety and so Called Neurotic Anxiety?: 'The sine qua non of true vitality': An Examination of the Difference Between Existential Anxiety and Neurotic Anxiety |journal=Existential Analysis |issn=1752-5616 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=356–67 |url=http://www.biomedsearch.com/article/What-difference-between-existential-anxiety/288874227.html}}</ref>

Although [[panic attacks]] are not experienced by every person who suffers from anxiety, they are a common symptom. Panic attacks usually come without warning and although the fear is generally irrational, the subjective perception of danger is very real. A person experiencing a panic attack will often feel as if he or she is about to die or lose consciousness. Between panic attacks, people with panic disorder tend to suffer from anticipated anxiety- a fear of having a panic attack may lead to the development of phobias.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Neil R. |last1=Carlson |first2=C.

==Causes==
An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation is that increased anxiety serves the purpose of increased [[vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] regarding potential  threats in the environment as well as increased tendency to take proactive actions regarding such possible threats. This may cause [[false positive]] reactions but an individual suffering from anxiety may also avoid real threats. This may explain why anxious people are less likely to die due to accidents.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0016242 |title=The bright side of being blue: Depression as an adaptation for analyzing complex problems |year=2009 |last1=Andrews |first1=Paul W. |last2=Thomson Jr |first2=J.

The psychologist David H. Barlow of Boston University conducted a study that showed three common characteristics of people suffering from chronic anxiety, which he characterized as "a generalized biological vulnerability", "a generalized psychological vulnerability", and "a specific psychological vulnerability".<ref>{{cite book |last=Barlow |first=David H. |last2=Durand |first2=Vincent |title=Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach |year=2008 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=0-534-58156-0 |page=125}}{{primary source-inline|date=May 2013}}</ref> While chemical issues in the brain that result in anxiety (especially resulting from genetics) are well documented, this study highlights an additional environmental factor that may result from being raised by parents suffering from chronic anxiety.{{or|date=May 2013}}

Other contextual factors that are thought to contribute to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences. In particular, learning mastery (the degree to which people perceive their lives to be under their own control) and instrumentality, which includes such traits as self-confidence, independence, and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and anxiety. That is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, with higher levels of anxiety in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences. Research has demonstrated the ways in which facial prominence in photographic images differs between men and women. More specifically, in official online photographs of politicians around the world, women's faces are less prominent than men's. Interestingly enough, the difference in these images actually tended to be greater in cultures with greater institutional gender equality.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312450004 |title=Understanding Gender Differences in Anxiety: The Mediating Effects of Instrumentality and Mastery |year=2012 |last1=Zalta |first1=Alyson K. |last2=Chambless |first2=Dianne L. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=488–9}}</ref>

Research upon adolescents who as infants had been highly apprehensive, vigilant, and fearful finds that their [[nucleus accumbens]] is more sensitive than that in other people when deciding to make an action that determined whether they received a reward.<ref name="Bar-Haim">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02401.x |title=Neural Correlates of Reward Processing in Adolescents with a History of Inhibited Temperament |year=2009 |last1=Bar-Haim |first1=Yair |last2=Fox |first2=Nathan A. |last3=Benson |first3=Brenda |last4=Guyer |first4=Amanda E. |last5=Williams |first5=Amber |last6=Nelson |first6=Eric E. |last7=Perez-Edgar |first7=Koraly |last8=Pine |first8=Daniel S. |last9=Ernst |first9=Monique |journal=Psychological Science |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=1009–18 |pmid=19594857 |pmc=2785902}}</ref> This suggests a link between circuits responsible for fear and also reward in anxious people.

Although single genes have little effect on complex traits and interact heavily both [[epistasis|between themselves]] and with the external factors, research is under-way to unravel possible molecular mechanisms underlying anxiety and comorbid conditions.

Abnormal and pathological anxiety or fear may itself be a medical condition falling under the blanket term "anxiety disorder".

===Existential anxiety===
{{Further|Angst|Existential crisis|Nihilism}}

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], in ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]],'' described anxiety or dread associated with the "dizziness of freedom" and suggested the possibility for positive resolution of anxiety through the self-conscious exercise of responsibility and choosing. In ''Art and Artist'' (1932), the psychologist [[Otto Rank]] wrote that the [[psychological trauma]] of birth was the pre-eminent human symbol of existential anxiety and encompasses the creative person's simultaneous fear of – and desire for – separation, individuation and differentiation.

The [[theology|theologian]] [[Paul Tillich]] characterized existential anxiety<ref name="Tillich">{{cite book |authorlink=Paul Tillich |last=Tillich |first=Paul |year=1952 |title=The Courage To Be |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-08471-4|page=76}}</ref> as "the state in which a [[being]] is aware of its possible nonbeing" and he listed three categories for the nonbeing and resulting anxiety: ontic (fate and death), [[Morality|moral]] ([[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and condemnation), and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] (emptiness and [[Meaning (existential)|meaninglessness]]). According to Tillich, the last of these three types of existential anxiety, i.e. spiritual anxiety, is predominant in modern times while the others were predominant in earlier periods. Tillich argues that this anxiety can be [[Acceptance#Self acceptance|accepted]] as part of the [[human condition]] or it can be resisted but with negative consequences. In its pathological form, spiritual anxiety may tend to "drive the person toward the creation of certitude in systems of meaning which are supported by [[tradition]] and [[authority]]" even though such "undoubted certitude is not built on the rock of [[reality]]".<ref name=Tillich />

According to [[Viktor Frankl]], the author of ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', when a person is faced with extreme mortal dangers, the most basic of all human wishes is to find a [[meaning of life]] to combat the "trauma of nonbeing" as death is near.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Stranger and social anxiety===
{{Main|Stranger anxiety|Social anxiety}}

Humans generally require social acceptance and thus sometimes dread the disapproval of others. Apprehension of being judged by others may cause anxiety in social environments.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-375096-9.00028-6 |chapter=Introduction: Toward an Understanding of Social Anxiety Disorder |title=Social Anxiety |year=2010 |last1=Hofmann |first1=Stefan G. |last2=Dibartolo |first2=Patricia M. |isbn=978-0-12-375096-9 |pages=xix–xxvi}}</ref>

Anxiety during social interactions, particularly between strangers, is common among young people. It may persist into adulthood and become social anxiety or social phobia. "[[Stranger anxiety]]" in small children is not considered a phobia. In adults, an excessive fear of other people is not a developmentally common stage; it is called [[social anxiety]]. According to Cutting,<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=Ben |editor1-last=Thomas |editor2-first=Sally |editor2-last=Hardy |editor3-first=Penny |editor3-last=Cutting |year=1997 |title=Mental Health Nursing: Principles and Practice |publisher=Mosby |location=London |isbn=978-0-7234-2590-8}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref> social phobics do not fear the crowd but the fact that they may be judged negatively.

[[Social anxiety]] varies in degree and severity. For some people it is characterized by experiencing discomfort or awkwardness during physical social contact (e.g. embracing, shaking hands, etc.), while in other cases it can lead to a fear of interacting with unfamiliar people altogether. Those suffering from this condition may restrict their lifestyles to accommodate the anxiety, minimizing social interaction whenever possible. Social anxiety also forms a core aspect of certain personality disorders, including [[Avoidant Personality Disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10578-012-0307-0 |title=Social Functioning in Youth with Anxiety Disorders: Association with Anxiety Severity and Outcomes from Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy |year=2012 |last1=Settipani |first1=Cara A. |last2=Kendall |first2=Philip C. |journal=Child Psychiatry & Human Development |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |pmid=22581270}}</ref>

===Generalized anxiety===
{{Further|Generalized anxiety disorder|Cognitive behavioral therapy|}}

Overwhelming anxiety, if not treated early, can become a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), identified by symptoms of exaggerated and excessive worry, chronic anxiety and constant, irrational thoughts. These anxious thoughts and feelings are difficult to control and can cause serious mental anguish that interferes with normal, daily functioning.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Generalized anxiety disorder |month=June |year=2011 |journal=Harvard Mental Health Letter |volume=27 |issue=12 |pages=1–3 |url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/harvard_mental_health_letter/2011/June}}</ref>

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ([[DSM-IV]]) includes specific criteria for diagnosing generalized anxiety disorder. The DSM-IV states that a patient must experience chronic anxiety and excessive worry, almost daily, for at least 6 months from a number of stressors (such as work or school) and experience three or more defined symptoms, including, "restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)".<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/da.20658 |title=Generalized worry disorder: A review of DSM-IV generalized anxiety disorder and options for DSM-V |year=2010 |last1=Andrews |first1=Gavin |last2=Hobbs |first2=Megan J. |last3=Borkovec |first3=Thomas D. |last4=Beesdo |first4=Katja |last5=Craske |first5=Michelle G. |last6=Heimberg |first6=Richard G. |last7=Rapee |first7=Ronald M. |last8=Ruscio |first8=Ayelet Meron |last9=Stanley |first9=Melinda A. |journal=Depression and Anxiety |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=134–47 |pmid=20058241}}</ref> Generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to be found among people who are living in a big city, or one that is politically and economically unstable.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Daniel L. |last1=Schacter |first2=Daniel T. |last2=Gilbert |first3=Daniel M. |last3=Wegner |year=2011 |chapter=Generalized Anxiety Disorder |title=Psychology |edition=2nd}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref>

If symptoms of chronic anxiety are not addressed and treated in adolescence the risk of developing an anxiety disorder in adulthood increases.<ref name="Ellis D 2011">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10567-010-0065-0 |title=The Metacognitive Model of Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Children and Adolescents |year=2010 |last1=Ellis |first1=Danielle M. |last2=Hudson |first2=Jennifer L. |journal=Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=151–63 |pmid=20352491}}</ref> "Clinical worry is also associated with risk of comorbidity with other anxiety disorders and depression" and thus immediate treatment is important.<ref name="Ellis D 2011"/>

Generalized anxiety disorder can be treated through specialized therapies aimed at changing thinking patterns and in turn reducing anxiety-producing behaviors. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) and short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) can be used to treat GAD with positive effects lasting 12 months after treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=21878162 |year=2011 |last1=Salzer |first1=S |last2=Winkelbach |first2=C |last3=Leweke |first3=F |last4=Leibing |first4=E |last5=Leichsenring |first5=F |title=Long-term effects of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy in generalized anxiety disorder: 12-month follow-up |volume=56 |issue=8 |pages=503–8 |journal=Canadian journal of psychiatry}}</ref> Other treatment plans can be used in conjunction with behavioral therapy to reduce the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder.

According to Ghafoor, 90% of individuals suffering from a generalized anxiety disorder also struggle with at least one additional mental health issue. Of these individuals, up to 50% may have experienced a serious episode of depression by age 18. Mental health professionals in the field are thus asking more relevant questions of their patients to achieve more effective diagnoses. Ghafoor suggests that asking questions relating to personal symptoms (such as fatigue, irritability, or restlessness) offers a better a way for mental health professionals to create a more effective, personalized treatment plan.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=23243821 |year=2012 |last1=Ghafoor |first1=S |title=Managing anxiety |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=59 |journal=Nursing standard |doi=10.7748/ns2012.11.27.10.59.c9410}}</ref>

===Trait anxiety===
Anxiety can be either a short term 'state' or a long term "trait". Trait anxiety reflects a stable tendency to respond with state anxiety in the anticipation of threatening situations.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/notebook/anxiety.html|title = Anxiety|last = Schwarzer|first = R.|date = December 1997|accessdate = 2008-01-12|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070920115547/http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/notebook/anxiety.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate = 2007-09-20}}</ref> It is closely related to the personality trait of [[neuroticism]]. Such anxiety may be conscious or unconscious.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Giddey |first1=M. |last2=Wright |first2=H. |title=Mental Health Nursing: From first principles to professional practice |publisher=Stanley Thornes}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref>

===Choice or decision anxiety===
Anxiety induced by the need to choose between similar options is increasingly being recognized as a problem for individuals and for organizations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/fashion/trends/article85734.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=Premium choice anxiety |date=April 27, 2008 |accessdate=April 25, 2010 |first1=Jonathan |last1=Downey}}</ref>

In a decision context, unpredictability or uncertainty may trigger emotional responses in anxious individuals that systematically alter decision-making.<ref name="Hartley">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.12.027 |title=Anxiety and Decision-Making |year=2012 |last1=Hartley |first1=Catherine A. |last2=Phelps |first2=Elizabeth A. |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=113–8 |pmid=22325982}}</ref> There are primarily two forms of this anxiety type. The first form refers to a choice in which there are multiple potential outcomes with known or calculable probabilities. The second form refers to the uncertainty and ambiguity related to a decision context in which there are multiple possible outcomes with unknown probabilities.<ref name="Hartley"/>

===Positive psychology===
In [[positive psychology]], anxiety is described as the mental state that results from a difficult challenge for which the subject has insufficient coping skills.<ref name="Finding Flow">{{cite book |authorlink=Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi |last=Csíkszentmihályi |first=Mihály |title=Finding Flow |year=1997}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref>

==Prevention==
Several approaches to prevention of mental disorders in general are described in the article [[Mental disorders#Prevention|mental disorders]]. The use of treatments such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) for people at risk for anxiety has been shown to significantly reduce the number of episodes of generalized anxiety disorder and anxiety symptoms. Through managing negative thoughts and maladaptive behavior, significant improvements in explanatory style, hopelessness, and dysfunctional attitudes are observed.<ref name="Seligman et al">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/1522-3736.2.1.28a |title=The prevention of depression and anxiety |year=1999 |last1=Seligman |first1=Martin E.

==Treatments==
There are many ways to treat anxiety.

===Cognitive behavioral therapy===
The most notable treatment for anxiety is [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT).<ref name="Lippincott, Williams 2010">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/DBP.0b013e3181ea50ed |title=Cognitive and Behavioral Characterization of 16p11.2 Deletion Syndrome |year=2010 |last1=Hanson |first1=Ellen |last2=Nasir |first2=Ramzi H. |last3=Fong |first3=Alexa |last4=Lian |first4=Alyss |last5=Hundley |first5=Rachel |last6=Shen |first6=Yiping |last7=Wu |first7=Bai-Lin |last8=Holm |first8=Ingrid A. |last9=Miller |first9=David T. |journal=Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics |volume=31 |issue=8 |pages=649–57 |pmid=20613623 |last10=16p11.2 Study Group |first10=Clinicians}}</ref> Cognitive behavioral therapy involves the changing of one's thought by the therapist. Patients are asked to explain their feelings towards certain things or incidents that cause their anxious behavior.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cognitive-Behavioral therapy |work=CareNotes |publisher=[[Drugs.com]] |year=2012 |url=http://www.drugs.com/cg/cognitive-behavioral-therapy.html}}</ref>

One study found that [[Cognitive_behavioral_therapy#Computerized_CBT_and_computer-based_therapy|computerised CBT]] was equally effective as face-to-face CBT in adolescent anxiety.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0024512 |title=A randomized controlled trial of online versus clinic-based CBT for adolescent anxiety |year=2011 |last1=Spence |first1=Susan H. |last2=Donovan |first2=Caroline L. |last3=March |first3=Sonja |last4=Gamble |first4=Amanda |last5=Anderson |first5=Renee E. |last6=Prosser |first6=Samantha |last7=Kenardy |first7=Justin |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=629–42 |pmid=21744945}}</ref>

===Parental Anxiety Management===
Studies show that parental variables are sometimes involved in cases of anxiety thus Parental Anxiety Management (PAM) is also a viable treatment option.<ref name=PAM>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004583-199910000-00010 |title=Cognitive‐Behavioral Group Treatments in Childhood Anxiety Disorders: The Role of Parental Involvement |year=1999 |last1=Mendlowitz |first1=Sandra L. |last2=Manassis |first2=Katharina |last3=Bradley |first3=Susan |last4=Scapillato |first4=Donna |last5=Miezitis |first5=Solveiga |last6=Shaw |first6=Brian E |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=38 |issue=10 |pages=1223–9 |pmid=10517054}}</ref>

===Herbal treatments===
[[herbalism|Traditional herbal remedies]] have been used for centuries to treat anxiety but many lack strong evidence of efficacy. There is some limited promising data supporting the use of [[kava]] and, to some extent, [[inositol]], but the limited evidence available for [[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]], [[Valerian (herb)|valerian]], and [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s demonstrates little efficacy in anxiety and these remedies should not be recommended in place of more effective treatments.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17853630 |year=2007 |last1=Saeed |first1=SA |last2=Bloch |first2=RM |last3=Antonacci |first3=DJ |title=Herbal and dietary supplements for treatment of anxiety disorders |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=549–56 |journal=American family physician}}</ref>

===Caffeine elimination===
For some people, anxiety may be reduced by eliminating [[caffeine]] consumption.<ref name="Brucea">{{cite journal | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=4996824 |doi=10.1017/S003329170001117X | title = Caffeine abstention in the management of anxiety disorders | year = 2009 | last1 = Bruce | first1 = M.

===Combined treatments===
A combination of CBT and Parental Anxiety Management has been proven by psychologists and psychiatrists alike to be more effective than administering these treatments separately.<ref name="Lippincott, Williams 2010"/>

===Meditation===
The most simple form of meditating, directing attention to breathing, has been proven helpful. Even other simple activities like walking around or just lying down. The most key part is about having no disturbance and a low sound level.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.12m08083 |title=Randomized Controlled Trial of Mindfulness Meditation for Generalized Anxiety Disorder |year=2013 |last1=Hoge |first1=Elizabeth A. |last2=Bui |first2=Eric |last3=Marques |first3=Luana |last4=Metcalf |first4=Christina A. |last5=Morris |first5=Laura K. |last6=Robinaugh |first6=Donald J. |last7=Worthington |first7=John J. |last8=Pollack |first8=Mark H. |last9=Simon |first9=Naomi M. |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=74 |issue=8 |pages=786–92 |pmid=23541163 |laysummary=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/june3/meditate-060309.html |laysource=Stanford Report |laydate=June 3, 2009}}</ref>

===Other treatments===
Other methods used in treating anxiety include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and [[psychosurgery]]. Psychosurgery is used in very extreme cases, when other treatment techniques do not work.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schacter |first1=Daniel L. |last2=Gilbert |first2=Daniel T. |last3=Wegner |first3=Daniel M. |title=Psychology |publisher=Worth Publishers |year=2012 |page=615}}</ref>
