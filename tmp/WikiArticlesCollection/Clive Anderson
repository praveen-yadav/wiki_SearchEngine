==Career==
===Television===
Anderson was involved in the fledgling [[alternative comedy]] scene in the early 1980s and was the first act to come on stage at [[The Comedy Store, London|The Comedy Store]] when it opened in 1979.<ref name=Radio2>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/comedy/cliveanderson.shtml#biog |title=Clive Anderson's Chat Room |accessdate=29 July 2007 |publisher=BBC Radio 2}}</ref> He made his name as host of the improvised television comedy show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'', which ran for 10 series.<ref name=TVbio>{{cite web |url=http://uktv.co.uk/g2/item/aid/528014 |title=UKTV G2 Stars: Profile: Clive Anderson |accessdate=29 July 2007 |publisher=UKTV Interactive Limited}}</ref>

Anderson hosted his own chat-show, ''Clive Anderson Talks Back'', on [[Channel 4]], which ran for 10 series. Anderson moved to the BBC in 1996 and the show's name changed to ''Clive Anderson All Talk'' and was aired on [[BBC One]]. In one famous incident in 1997, Anderson interviewed the [[Bee Gees]], and throughout the interview he repeatedly joked about their life and career, ultimately prompting [[Barry Gibb]] to say "You're a tosser pal" to Anderson in a strong [[mancunian]] accent and walk out.<ref name=TVbio/> Anderson once had a glass of water poured over his head by a perturbed [[Richard Branson]]. He also famously asked [[Jeffrey Archer]], "Is there no beginning to your talents?" Archer retorted that "The old jokes are always the best," for Anderson to reply "Yes, I've read your books!" The last series of ''Clive Anderson All Talk'' aired in 2001.

He has been a frequent participant on ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', making ten appearances in total. He has also frequently appeared on ''[[QI]]''. In 2007, he featured as a regular panellist on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] comedy show ''[[News Knight]]''.
One of his most memorable exchanges on ''[[Have I Got News for You|HIGNFY]]'' occurred when he scathingly joked to fellow guest [[Piers Morgan]] that the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' was now, thanks to Morgan (then its editor), almost as good as ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]''. When asked by Morgan, "What do you know about editing newspapers?", he swiftly replied, "About as much as you do."

As a journalist for the BBC, he travelled around the world looking at problems "in out-of-the-way places," though mostly arguing about whether they could film there. ''Our Man in...'' featured episodes on [[ecotage|monkeywrenching]] in American logging and [[Advance-fee fraud|419 scams]] in Nigeria.

In 2005 he presented the short-lived [[Celador]] [[panel game]], ''[[Back in the Day (game show)|Back in the Day]]'' for [[Channel 4]].

In January 2008, he appeared on the second episode of ''[[Thank God You're Here (UK TV series)|Thank God You're Here]]'' and won.

On 25 February 2008, he started presenting ''[[Brainbox Challenge]]'', a new game show, for [[BBC Two]].

In 2008, he presented a reality TV talent show-themed television series produced by the BBC entitled [[Maestro (TV series)|Maestro]], starring eight celebrities who are "famous amateurs with a passion for classical music."

In 2009, Anderson was the television host of the BBC's [[Last Night of the Proms]].
