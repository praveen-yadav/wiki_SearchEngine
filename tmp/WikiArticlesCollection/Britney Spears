'''Britney Jean Spears''' (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, actress, former [[television]] [[music competition]] [[adjudicator|judge]], and occasional author. Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]], and raised in [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], she performed acting roles in stage productions and television shows as a child before signing with [[Jive Records]] in 1997. Spears's first and second studio albums, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), became international successes, with the former becoming the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist.<ref>Folkard, Claire (2003). ''Guinness World Records 2003''. Bantam Books. p. 288. ISBN 978-0-553-58636-7.</ref> Title tracks "[[...Baby One More Time]]" and "[[Oops!... I Did It Again]]" broke international sales records. In 2001, Spears released her third album, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'', and played the starring role in the film ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]''. She assumed creative control of her fourth album, ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), which yielded the worldwide success "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]".

In 2007, Spears's much-publicized personal struggles sent her career into hiatus. Her fifth record, ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'', was released later that year, and spawned hits "[[Gimme More]]" and "[[Piece of Me]]". Her erratic behavior and hospitalizations continued through the following year, at which point she was placed under a still on-going [[conservatorship]]. Spears's sixth album, ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008), included global chart-topping lead single "[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]". Its supporting tour [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]] was the highest-grossing global concert tour in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereotude.com/madonna/15-most-profitable-female-tours-ever.html|title=15 Most Profitable Female Tours Ever|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=July 27, 2010| last=Esmailian|first=Ani|work=Hollyscoop|publisher=DNA Group}}</ref> Later that October, "[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]" became Spears's third single to reach number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Her seventh album, ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011), became her first to yield three top-ten singles in the United States: "[[Hold It Against Me]]", "[[Till the World Ends]]" and "[[I Wanna Go]]". In 2012, Spears was featured on [[will.i.am]]'s single "[[Scream & Shout]]", which topped charts in over 24 countries. She also served as a judge during the [[The X Factor (U.S. season 2)|second season]] of the [[The X Factor (U.S. TV series)|American version]] of ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]''. Spears's eighth studio album ''[[Britney Jean]]'' is scheduled to be released in December 2013, at which time she will also begin the two-year [[residency show]] ''Britney: Piece of Me'' at the [[Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino]] in Las Vegas.

Spears was established as a [[pop icon]] and credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s. She became the 'best-selling teenaged artist of all time' before she turned 20,<ref>Ruggieri, Melissa (December 19, 2000). "Music Notes".

===1981–97: Early life and career beginnings===
Britney Jean Spears was born on December 2, 1981,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.biography.com/people/britney-spears-9542229 | title = Britney Spears Biography  | work = [[People (magazine)|People]] | accessdate = December 27, 2012}}</ref> the second child of [[Lynne Spears|Lynne Irene]] (née Bridges) and James Parnell Spears.

During her childhood, she also attended gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=56}}</ref><ref name=rs1>{{cite journal|title=Cover Story: Britney Spears: Britney Spears : Rolling Stone|date=April 15, 1999|work=Rolling Stone|last=Daly|first=Steven|issn=0035-791X|ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=foxnews>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html|title=Britney Spears' Biography |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=June 6, 2010|last=Reporter|first=Staff}}</ref> Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing "[[What Child Is This?]]" at her [[kindergarten]] graduation. She said about her ambition as a child, "I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age".<ref name=rs1/> At age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to [[Atlanta]] for an audition in the 1990s revival of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her for being too young to join the series at the time, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's vocals and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York. Spears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show ''[[Star Search]]'' and was cast in a number of commercials.<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=75}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Laufenberg|2005|p=616}}</ref> In December 1992, she was finally cast in ''The Mickey Mouse Club'', but returned to Kentwood after the show was canceled. She enrolled at [[Parklane Academy]] in nearby [[McComb, Mississippi]]. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to "the opening scene in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' with all the [[cliques]]. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more."<ref name=rs1/><ref name=rs2>{{cite journal|title=Cover Story: The Girl Can't Help It|date=May 25, 2000|work=Rolling Stone|last=Mundy|first=Chris|issn=0035-791X|ref=harv}}</ref>

In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join the female pop group [[Innosense]]. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song of [[Toni Braxton]]; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a [[Audio engineering|sound engineer]]. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing that audiences wanted pop bands such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] and the [[Spice Girls]], and "there wasn't going to be another [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], another [[Debbie Gibson]], or another [[Tiffany (singer)|Tiffany]]." Two weeks later, executives from [[Jive Records]] returned calls to Rudolph.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=145}}</ref> Senior vice president of [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that "It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'—is extremely important. And Britney had that."<ref name=rs1/> She then sang Houston's "[[I Have Nothing]]" (1992) for the executives, and got signed to the label.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Taylor, Chuck | url = http://books.google.com/?id=JQoEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA1&pg=PA80#v=onepage&q&f=false | journal=Billboard | title = Air Waves: Jive's Britney Spears Sets Top 40 Abuzz With Rhythm-Leaning 'Baby One More Time' | volume = 110 | issue = 43 | date = October 24, 1998 | accessdate = March 11, 2011 | issn = 0006-2510 | ref=harv}}</ref> They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from "lower and less poppy" delivery to "distinctively, unmistakably Britney."<ref name="Hughes 2005 147">{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=147}}</ref> After hearing the recorded material, president [[Clive Calder]] ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned "[[Sheryl Crow]] music, but younger more adult contemporary" but felt all right with her label's appointment of producers, since "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me." She flew to [[Cheiron Studios]] in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz Pop]] and [[Rami Yacoub]], among others.<ref name=rs1/>

===1998–2000: ''...Baby One More Time'' and ''Oops!... I Did It Again''===
After Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her forthcoming album. Her show was a four song set and she was accompanied by two back up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for [['N Sync]].<ref>{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=28}}</ref> Her debut album, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'', was released on January 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/britney-spears-teen-queen-rolling-stones-1999-cover-story-20110329|title=Britney Spears, Teen Queen: Rolling Stone's 1999 Cover Story|work=Rolling Stone|year=2011|accessdate=January 22, 2010}}</ref> It debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified two-times [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] after a month.

The April 1999 cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' featured Spears lying on her bed, clad with a bra, shorts and an open top. The [[American Family Association]] (AFA) referred to the shoot as "a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality" and called to "God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums." Spears responded to the outcry commenting, "What's the big deal? I have strong morals. [...] I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine.

==Artistry==

===Musical style===
Following her debut, Spears was credited with leading the revival of [[teen pop]] in the late 1990s. ''[[The Daily Yomiuri]]'' reported that "[m]usic critics have hailed her as the most gifted teenage pop idol for many years, but Spears has set her sights a little higher-she is aiming for the level of superstardom that has been achieved by Madonna and [[Janet Jackson]]."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Teen pop idols stage comeback|newspaper=Yomiuri Shimbun|page=1|date=November 25, 1999|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Rob Sheffield of ''Rolling Stone'' wrote: "Britney Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene."<ref>{{cite web|title=Oops!...I Did It Again – Album Review|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/oops-i-did-it-again-20040609|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=June 9, 2004|accessdate=October 8, 2009|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin, commented, "I know from [[Denniz Pop]] and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice.

''Oops!...I Did It Again'' and subsequent albums saw Spears working with several contemporary R&B producers, leading to "a combination of bubblegum, urban soul, and [[raga]]."<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen|title=Oops!...I Did It Again|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r478679|pure_url=yes}}|year=2000|accessdate=October 8, 2009|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Her third studio album, ''Britney'' derived from the teen pop niche, "[r]hythmically and melodically&nbsp;... sharper, tougher than what came before.

It has been widely reported that Spears [[lip-sync]]s in concert. Author Gary Giddins wrote in his book ''Natural selection: Gary Giddins on comedy, film, music, and books'' (2006) that "among many other performers accused of moving their lips while a machine does the labor are Britney Spears, [[Luciano Pavarotti]], Shania Twain, [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]], and Madonna."<ref name="Giddins">{{Cite book|last=Giddins|first=Gary|title=Natural selection: Gary Giddins on comedy, film, music, and books|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=288|year=2006|isbn=978-0-19-517951-4|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Rashod D. Ollison of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' observes: "Many pop stars&nbsp;... feel they have no choice but to seek vocal enhancement. Since the advent of MTV and other video music channels, pop audiences have been fed elaborate videos thick with jaw-dropping effects, awesome choreography, fabulous clothes, marvelous bodies. And the same level of perfection is expected to extend beyond the video set to the concert stage. So if Britney Spears, Janet Jackson or Madonna sounds shrill and flat without a backing track, fans won't pay up to $300 for a concert ticket."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ollison|first=Rashod|title=The pressure to be perfect singing live ; Audiences expect CD-quality sound; Observation|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|page=1.C|date=October 26, 2004|issn=19308965|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Giddins adds, "it was reported Britney Spears fans prefer her to lip-sync—despite her denials of doing so (contradicted by her own director)—because they expect flawless digitalization when they pay serious money for a concert."<ref name="Giddins"/>

In Australia, NSW Fair Trading Minister Virginia Judge has advised disclaimers be printed on any ticket for concerts which contain any prerecorded vocals. She commented: "There could have been some instances where people actually go and purchase a ticket thinking that they're going to have a live performance ... for some people that means that everything is live, it's fresh, it happens instantaneously, it's not something that's been pre-recorded.

Throughout her career, Spears has drawn frequent comparisons to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Janet Jackson]], in terms of vocals, choreography and stage presence, citing both as influences in her work.

Many critics have argued that Spears should not be considered in the same league of talent as Jackson or Madonna. Journalists Erika Montalvo and Jackie Sheppard of the ''[[Rocky Mountain Collegian]]'' observed "[s]ome may argue that Spears is not only a good recording artist but also an important cultural icon."<ref name="UWIRE"/> However, in examining her level of skill as an artist, it is questioned that "[a]lthough she has been classified among female elites such as Janet Jackson and Madonna, what does Ms. Spears really have in common with these divas of rock?"<ref name="UWIRE">{{Cite news|last1=Montalvo|first1=Erika|last2=Sheppard|first2=Jackie|title=CONCERT REVIEW: Pop's princess still reigns ... for now|newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain Collegian]]|publisher=[[UWIRE]]|date=November 16, 2001|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Joan Anderman of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' remarked that "[t]hirteen costume changes in 90 minutes won't bless her with Madonna's intelligence or cultural barometer. An army of cutting-edge R&B producers won't supply her with Janet Jackson's sense of humor or sincere smile&nbsp;... Britney's heroes aren't great singers. But they're real singers.

Reporter Ed Bumgardner commented her transition from teen pop start to adult sex symbol with her third studio album ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' "takes its cues from two other successful performers—Madonna and Janet Jackson—both of whom she brazenly rips off and both of whom, like Spears, are passable singers, at best."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bumgardner |first=Ed|title=CONFUSED: WOMAN OR A GIRL? SPEARS CAN'T DECIDE|newspaper=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|page=1|date=November 9, 2001|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Critic Shane Harrison wrote: "From the minimalist thump and "[[Nasty (song)|Nasty]]" feel of "[[I'm a Slave 4 U]]" to the scattered quotes in "[[Boys (Britney Spears song)|Boys]]", [''Britney''] feels like [Spears's] attempt at '[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]'."<ref name="shane"/>

Citing Jackson's resolve to incorporate personal and social issues into her work and Madonna's ability to constantly redefine the boundaries of socially acceptable material in the industry, Spears's catalog ultimately pales in comparison, because "[w]hile Jackson and Madonna wrote their own music about subjects of importance, [Spears's] music sounds like an upbeat version of either, 'I want to grow up but the media won't let me,' or 'Here kitty, kitty, I'm wearing my underwear outside of my leather pants'-type ballads."<ref name="UWIRE"/> In contrast, Guy Blackman argues that although "no one would argue that Spears is some kind of pioneering pop auteur, there’s still a lot to like about her back catalogue. During her world-conquering peak, she was just about as cutting edge as you could get in the world of global pop superstardom. Spears didn’t just work with big names, she gave big names their names, and maintained her high currency in the world’s most fickle industry for years, when most aspiring starlets are lucky to manage months."<ref name="The Age"/>

After meeting Spears face to face, Janet Jackson stated: "she said to me, 'I'm such a big fan; I really admire you.' That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place.

Barbara Ellen of ''[[The Observer]]'' has reported: "Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena&nbsp;— a child with a full-time career.

She's an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster.

Spears is no technical singer, that's for sure.
