'''Alyattes''', king of [[Lydia]] (619–560 BC), considered to be the founder of the [[Lydian empire]], was the son of [[Sadyattes]], of the house of the [[Mermnadae]].

== Life ==
For several years he continued the war against [[Miletus]] begun by his father, but was obliged to turn his attention towards the [[Medes]] and [[Babylonians]]. On May 28, 585 BC, during the [[Battle of Halys (585 BC)|Battle of Halys]] fought  against [[Cyaxares]], king of Media, a [[solar eclipse]] took place (see also [[Thales]]); hostilities were suspended, peace concluded, and the [[Kızılırmak (river)|Halys]] fixed as the boundary between the two kingdoms.

Alyattes drove the [[Cimmeria]]ns (see [[Scythia]]) from [[Asia Minor]], subdued the [[Carians]], and took several [[Ionia]]n cities (including [[İzmir|Smyrna]], [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]]). Smyrna was sacked and destroyed with its inhabitants forced to move into the countryside.

He standardised the weight of coins (1 Stater = 168 grains of wheat). The coins were produced using an anvil die technique and stamped with the Lion's head, the symbol of the Mermnadae.

He was succeeded by his son [[Croesus]]. His daughter [[Aryenis of Lydia]] was [[Queen consort]] of [[Astyages]], King of Media.

His [[tomb]] still exists on the plateau between Lake Gygaea and the river Hermus to the north of [[Sardis]]&mdash;a large mound of earth with a substructure of huge stones.  It was excavated by [[Spiegelthal]] in 1854, who found that it covered a large vault of finely cut marble blocks approached by a flat-roofed passage of the same stone from the south. The [[sarcophagus]] and its contents had been removed by early plunderers of the tomb. All that was left were some broken alabaster vases, pottery and charcoal. On the summit of the mound were large [[phallus|phalli]] of stone.
