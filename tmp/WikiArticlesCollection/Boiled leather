'''Boiled leather''', sometimes called '''''cuir bouilli''''', was a historical construction material for [[armour]]. It consists of thick [[leather]], boiled in water (some sources hold that [[Cooking oil|oil]] and [[wax]] were used as well; others posit the use of [[ammonia]] from fermented animal [[urine]]). The boiling causes the leather to be harder but also more brittle. The boiled leather can be fashioned into lames or [[Scale armour|scales]] to make [[lamellar armour|lamellar]] or [[scale armor]]. The leather remains flexible for a short time after boiling, allowing it to be molded into larger plates.

Cuir bouilli has also been employed to [[bookbinding|bind books]].
