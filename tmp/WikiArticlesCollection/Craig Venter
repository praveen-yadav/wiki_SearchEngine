Being confronted with wounded, maimed, and dying soldiers on a daily basis instilled in him a desire to study medicine<ref>'Artificial life' breakthrough announced by scientists, BBC, 21 May 2010. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science_and_environment/10138849.stm</ref> — although he later switched to biomedical research.

Venter graduated from [[Mills High School]] and began his college career at a [[community college]], [[College of San Mateo]] in [[California]]. He received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in [[biochemistry]] in 1972, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in [[physiology]] and [[pharmacology]] in 1975, both from the [[University of California, San Diego]]. At UCSD, he studied under biochemist [[Nathan O. Kaplan]].<ref name="Taubes">{{cite journal |url=http://archive.sciencewatch.com/sept-oct97/sw_sep-oct97_page3.htm |title=Craig Venter Takes Aim at the Big Questions |journal=[[ScienceWatch]] |date=September/October 1997 |volume=8 |issue=5 |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}</ref> and married former Ph.D. candidate Barbara Rae.<ref>[http://www.rae-venterlaw.com/who.htm Rae-Venter Law Group]</ref><ref name = "abfamb">{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/the-god-of-small-things/2007/01/25/1169594430068.html?page=fullpage |title=The god of small things |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=January 26, 2007}}</ref><ref>http://www.nndb.com/people/832/000163343/</ref> After working as an associate professor, and later as full professor, at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]], he joined the [[National Institutes of Health]] in 1984.

==Career==
===Scientific discoveries===
While at the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]], Venter learned of a technique for rapidly identifying all of the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]s present in a cell and began to use it to identify human brain genes. The short [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] sequence fragments discovered by this method are called [[expressed sequence tag]]s (ESTs), a name coined by Anthony Kerlavage at [[The Institute for Genomic Research]]. The NIH initially led an effort to patent these gene fragments, in which Venter coincidentally and controversially became involved.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Roberts | first = Leslie | date = October 11, 1991 | title = Genome patent fight erupts: an NIH plan to patent thousands of random DNA sequences will discourage industrial investment and undercut the Genome Project itself, the plan's critics charge | journal = [[Science (magazine)|Science]] | volume = 254 | issue = 5029 | pages = 184–186 | doi = 10.1126/science.1925568|bibcode = 1991Sci...254..184R }}</ref>{{Synthesis-inline|date=October 2009|reason=There's nothing at all "coincidental" here...}} The NIH later withdrew the patent applications, following public outcry. Subsequent court cases declared that ESTs were not directly patentable.<ref>{{Cite journal | year = 2006 | journal = [[Harvard Law Review]] | volume = 119 | title = Patent Law—Utility—Federal Circuit holds that expressed sequence tags lack substantial and specific utility unless underlying gene function is identified.—''In re Fisher'', 421 F.3d 1365 (Fed.

====Human Genome Project====
{{main|Human Genome Project}}
Venter was passionate about the power of genomics to radically transform healthcare. Venter believed that [[shotgun sequencing]] was the fastest and most effective way to get useful human genome data.<ref name="Weber1997">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Weber | first1 = James L.  | last2 = Myers | first2 = Eugene W.  | year = 1997 | journal = [[Genome Research]] | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | title = Human Whole-Genome Shotgun Sequencing | pages = 401–409 | doi = 10.1101/gr.7.5.401  | url = http://genome.cshlp.org/content/7/5/401.full  | doi_brokendate = 2010-05-20 | pmid=9149936

McElheny| title = Drawing the Map of Life: Inside the Human Genome Project| year = 2010| publisher = Basic Books (AZ)| isbn = 978-0-465-04333-0 }}</ref> The goal of the company was to sequence the entire human genome and release it into the [[public domain]] for non-commercial use in much less time and for much less cost than the public human genome project. The company planned to profit from their work by creating a value-added database of genomic data to which users could subscribe for a fee. The goal consequently put pressure on the public genome program and spurred several groups to redouble their efforts to produce the full sequence. [[DNA]] from five demographically different individuals was used by Celera to generate the sequence of the human genome; one of the individuals was Venter himself. In 2000, Venter and [[Francis Collins (geneticist)|Francis Collins]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]] and U.S. Public Genome Project jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome, a full three years ahead of the expected end of the Public Genome Program. The announcement was made along with [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Bill Clinton]], and [[U.K.]] [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]].<ref name="blueprint">{{cite news |first=Jamie |last=Shreeve |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31genome.htm |title=The Blueprint of Life |newspaper=[[U.S. News and World Report]] |date=October 31, 2005 |accessdate=January 30, 2007}}</ref> Venter and Collins thus shared an award for "Biography of the Year" from [[A&E Network]].<ref name="montgomery">"{{cite press release |url=http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/mc/news/press/00-463.html |title=Time Magazine Dubs Montgomery County "DNA Alley" |publisher=[[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County, Maryland Government]]|date=December 19, 2000 |accessdate=January 30, 2007}}</ref>
On the 15 February 2001, the Human Genome Project consortium published the first Human Genome in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], and was followed, one day later, by a Celera publication in Science.<ref name="Venter2001">{{Cite doi | 10.1126/science.1058040}}</ref><ref name="Lander2001">{{Cite  doi | 10.1038/35057062}}</ref> Despite some claims that [[shotgun sequencing]] was in some ways less accurate than the clone-by-clone method chosen by the Human Genome Project,<ref name="Olson2002">{{Cite journal  | last = Olson | first =  M.V. | year = 2002

Although Celera was originally set to sequence a composite of DNA samples, partway through the sequencing, Venter switched the samples for his own DNA.<ref name="dna switch">{{cite news |first=Emily |last=Singer |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/19328/?a=f |title=Technology Review |newspaper=[[Technology review]] |date=September 4, 2007 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref>

After contributing to the Human Genome, and its release into the public domain, Venter was fired by Celera in early 2002.<ref>{{cite news |first=Antonio |last=Regalo |title=Maverick biologist at work on next goal: creating life |newspaper=[[Seattle Times]] |date=July 24, 2005}}</ref> According to his biography, Venter was ready to leave Celera, and was fired due to conflict with the main investor, Tony White, that had existed since day one of the project. Venter writes that his main goal was always to accelerate science and thereby discovery, and he only sought help from the corporate world when he couldn't find funding in the public sector.

====Global Ocean Sampling Expedition====
The [[Global Ocean Sampling Expedition]] (GOS) is an [[ocean exploration]] [[genome project]] with the goal of assessing the [[genetic diversity]] in [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[microbial communities]] and to understand their role in nature's fundamental processes. Begun as a Sargasso Sea pilot sampling project in August 2003, Craig Venter announced the full Expedition on 4 March 2004. The project, which used Craig Venter's personal yacht, ''Sorcerer II'', started in Halifax, Canada, circumnavigated the globe and returned to the U.S. in January 2006.<ref name="for sale">{{cite news |title=Yacht for Sale: Suited for Sailing, Surfing, and Seaborne Metagenomics |work=GenomeWeb.com |publisher=GenomeWeb News|author=Larkman, Kirell |date=September 7, 2007 |accessdate=September 7, 2007}}</ref>

====Synthetic genomics====
Venter is currently the president of the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]], which conducts research in [[synthetic biology]]. In June 2005, he co-founded [[Synthetic Genomics]], a firm dedicated to using modified [[microorganisms]] to produce [[clean fuels]] and biochemicals. In July 2009, [[ExxonMobil]] announced a $600 million collaboration with Synthetic Genomics to research and develop next-generation [[biofuel]]s.<ref name="exxon">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/07/14/14greenwire-exxon-sinks-600m-into-algae-based-biofuels-in-33562.html |title=Exxon Sinks $600M Into Algae-Based Biofuels in Major Strategy Shift|work=NYTimes.com|publisher=New York Times|date=July 14, 2009 | first=Katie | last=Howell}}</ref> 

Venter is seeking to patent the first [[Artificial lifeform|life form created by humanity]], possibly to be named ''[[Mycoplasma laboratorium]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05180/530330.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Biologist Venter aims to create life from scratch | first=Antonio | last=Regalado | date=June 29, 2005}}</ref> There is speculation that this line of research could lead to producing bacteria that have been engineered to perform specific reactions, for example, produce [[fuels]], make [[medicines]], combat [[global warming]], and so on.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1553919/Man-made-microbe-to-create-endless-biofuel.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Man-made microbe 'to create endless biofuel' | first=Roger | last=Highfield | date=June 8, 2007 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref>

In May 2010, a team of scientists led by Venter became the first to successfully create what was described as "[[synthetic life]]".<ref>{{cite doi | 10.1126/science.1190719 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/05/scientists-create-first-self-replicating-synthetic-life/ |title = Scientists Create First Self-Replicating Synthetic Life | work=Wired | first=Rachel |last=Swaby |date=May 20, 2010}}</ref> This was done by synthesizing a very long DNA molecule containing an entire bacterium [[genome]], and introducing this into another [[Cell (biology)|cell]], analogous to the accomplishment of [[Eckard Wimmer]]'s group, who synthesized and ligated an [[RNA virus]] genome and "booted" it in cell lysate.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 20010599  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | doi=10.1038/nbt.1593 | volume=27 | issue=12 | year=2009 | month=December | pages=1163–72 | pmc=2819212 | title = Synthetic viruses: a new opportunity to understand and prevent viral disease | last1 = Wimmer | first1 = Eckard | last2 = Mueller | first2 = Steffen | last3 = Tumpey | first3 = Terrence M | last4 = Taubenberger | first4 = Jeffery K | journal = Nature Biotechnology}}</ref> The single-celled organism contains four "watermarks"<ref>[http://www.arcfn.com/2010/06/using-arc-to-decode-venters-secret-dna.html Using Arc to decode Venter's secret DNA watermark by Ken Shirriff]</ref>

In 2013 Venter said scientists would soon be able to use 3D printers to create synthetic life, possibly even recreating alien genomes whose DNA sequences are beamed back from probes like NASA's [[Curiosity rover]].<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/scientist-who-mapped-human-genome-says-we-will-be-able-to-print-alien-life-from-mars-8864252.html Scientist who mapped human genome says we will be able to 'print' alien life from Mars].

===Individual human genome===
On September 4, 2007, a team led by Sam Levy published the first complete (six-billion-letter) [[genome]] of an individual human—Venter's own DNA sequence.<ref name="PloS_VG">{{cite journal|journal=PLoS Biology|year=2007|volume=5|issue=10|title=The Diploid Genome Sequence of an Individual Human|author=Levy S |url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254|pages=e254|pmid=17803354|pmc=1964779|author-separator=,|author2=Sutton G|author3=Ng PC|author4=Feuk L|author5=Halpern AL|display-authors=5|last6=Walenz|first6=Brian P.|last7=Axelrod|first7=Nelson|last8=Huang|first8=Jiaqi|last9=Kirkness|first9=Ewen F.}}</ref> Some of the sequences in Venter's genome are associated with wet earwax,<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=117800 Omim - Ear Wax, Wet/Dry<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> increased risk of antisocial behavior, [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] and [[cardiovascular diseases]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Venter, J.C.| title = A Life Decoded| year = 2007| publisher = Viking| location = New York| isbn = 978-0-670-06358-1 }}</ref> This publication was especially interesting since it contained a [[diploid]] instead of a [[haploid]] genome and shows promise for [[personalized medicine]] via [[genotyping]].{{Or|date=October 2009}} This genome, dubbed HuRef by Levy and others, was a landmark accomplishment and as of mid-2010 is probably the highest quality personal genome sequence yet completed.

The Human Reference Genome Browser is a web application for the navigation and analysis of Venter's recently published genome. The HuRef database consists of approximately 32 million DNA reads sequenced using [[microfluidic Sanger sequencing]], assembled into 4,528 scaffolds and 4.1 million [[Mutation|DNA variation]]s identified by genome analysis. These variants include [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs), block [[point mutation|substitutions]], short and large [[indel]]s, and structural variations like [[insertion (genetics)|insertions]], [[deletion (genetics)|deletions]], [[chromosome inversion|inversions]] and [[copy number variation|copy number changes]].

The browser enables scientists to navigate the HuRef genome assembly and sequence variations, and to compare it with the NCBI human build 36 assembly in the context of the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] and [[Ensembl]] annotations. The browser provides a comparative view between NCBI and HuRef consensus sequences, the sequence multi-alignment of the HuRef assembly, Ensembl and dbSNP annotations, HuRef variants, and the underlying variant evidence and functional analysis. The interface also represents the [[haplotype]] blocks from which diploid genome sequence can be inferred and the relation of variants to gene annotations. The display of variants and gene annotations are linked to external public resources including [[dbSNP]], Ensembl, [[Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man]] (OMIM) and [[Gene Ontology]] (GO).

Users can search the HuRef genome using HUGO gene names, Ensembl and dbSNP identifiers, HuRef [[contig]] or scaffold locations, or NCBI chromosome locations. Users can then easily and quickly browse any genomic region via the simple and intuitive pan and zoom controls; furthermore, data relevant to specific loci can be exported for further analysis.

Venter appeared in the "Evolution" episode of the documentary television series ''[[Understanding (TV series)|Understanding]]''.

On May 16, 2004, Venter gave the commencement speech at [[Boston University]].<ref name="bu">Warren, Jessica.

Accessed August 2, 2008.</ref>

In a 2007 interview with ''[[New Scientist]]'' when asked "Assuming you can make [[Synthetic life|synthetic bacteria]], what will you do with them?", Venter replied:

{{bquote|Over the next 20 years, synthetic genomics is going to become the standard for making anything. The chemical industry will depend on it. Hopefully, a large part of the energy industry will depend on it. We really need to find an alternative to taking carbon out of the ground, burning it, and putting it into the atmosphere. That is the single biggest contribution I could make.}}

Furthermore it suggests that one of the main purposes for creating synthetic bacteria would be to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels through [[bioremediation]].<ref name="Aldhous2007">{{cite journal|last=Aldhous|first=Peter|year=2007|title=Interview: DNA's messengers |journal=[[New Scientist]]|issue=2626|pages=57}}</ref>

Venter was featured in Time Magazine's "The Top 10 Everything of 2008" article. Number three in 2008's Top 10 Scientific Discoveries was a piece outlining his work stitching together the 582,000 base pairs necessary to invent the genetic information for a whole new bacterium.<ref name="time">{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2008/top10/article/0,30583,1855948_1863947,00.html | work=Time | title=The Top 10 Everything Of 2008 | date=November 3, 2008 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref>

For an episode aired on July 27, 2009, Venter was interviewed on his boat by BBC One for the first episode of TV show [[Bang Goes the Theory]].

On May 8, 2010, Venter received an honorary doctor of science degree from [[Clarkson University]] for his work on the human genome.<ref name="clarkson">http://www.clarkson.edu/news/view.php?id=2455</ref>

On May 20, 2010, Venter announced the creation of first self-replicating semi-synthetic bacterial cell.<ref name="ted_a">http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/craig_venter_unveils_synthetic_life.html</ref>

On November 21, 2010 [[Steve Kroft]] profiled Venter and his research on [[60 minutes]].

On April 21, 2011, Venter received the 2011 Benjamin Rush Medal from [[William & Mary School of Law]].<ref name="bare_url">{{cite web|last=Welch-Donahue|first=Jaime|title=Benjamin Rush Scholars to Honor Dr. J.

In the June 2011 issue of [[Men's Journal]], Venter was featured as the "Survival Skills" celebrity of the month.  He shared various anecdotes, and advice, including stories of his time in [[Vietnam]], as well as mentioning a bout with [[melanoma]] upon his back, which subsequently resulted in "giving a pound of flesh" to surgery.<ref name="mensjournal">{{cite web |publisher=Men's Journal |url=http://www.mensjournal.com/survival-skills-craig-venter |date=May 20, 2011 |author=Will Cockrell |title=Survival Skills: Craig Venter}}</ref>

In the season finale of the first season of the [[BBC America]] science fiction series [[Orphan Black]] Venter is referenced as patenting and organism and encoding a message in the genome of that organism. it is revealed that Aldous Leekie did something similar with the clones. Cassima implies that such a patent made any contracts unenforceable as they made the clones property. Given that the clones are sentient human beings, anti-slavery laws make such a conclusion suspect. It is likely in actual practice that such a patent would either be entirely unenforceable or would to the genomic sequence of the organism only.

==Bibliography==
Venter is an [[Institute for Scientific Information|ISI]] [[ISI highly cited researcher|highly cited researcher]] and has authored over 200 publications in [[scientific journal]]s.<ref name="HighlyCited">{{cite web |title=Venter, J. Craig |work=[[ISIHighlyCited.com]] |url=http://hcr3.isiknowledge.com/author.cgi?&link1=Browse&link2=Results&id=770 |format=restricted access |date=August 19, 2003 |accessdate=October 17, 2009}}</ref>
<!--LIST CRITERIA-->
<!-- For inclusion on this list, a publication must meet ALL of the following criteria (see exceptions below):
(1) Include Venter as a ''primary'' author. He will invariably be listed first or last. THERE IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS CRITERION.
(2) Be cited in a peer-reviewed scientific journal with an [[impact factor]] of at least 10.
(3) It must have at least an average of 100 citations PER YEAR. If you are using ISIknowledge, just click on the number of times cited, then click on "analyze results", and rank by publication year. To calculate this manually, take the number of citations the article has (try using ISIknowledge.com) and divide it by the number of years since it was published. This rule is more flexible for articles published in the 20th century, as most can reasonably be expected not to be cited often anymore.

Exceptions to criteria 3 are:
(1) his autobiography
(2) an article that is a BIG DEAL but is too recent to have been so highly cited (for example, "Environmental genome shotgun sequencing of the Sargasso Sea" was a huge deal, but was only cited 60 times in 2004, a very low number for a Venter article)
(3) a review, editorial, etc., that is often cited and that provides a broad overview OF HIS OWN WORKS.

The criteria may seem incredibly high, but they account for the fact that Venter's articles are hugely cited and WP is not a directory.

<!--NOTE: the use of the ellipsis is prescribed by the [[APA]] when a work has more than 7 authors and a later one needs mentioning. For the purposes of this section (and with a modification so that it matches the output of citation templates), the first 7 authors are listed, followed by the spaced ellipsis, followed by the author (Venter), and, if necessary, followed by ''et al''.-->
