The '''Bantu languages''', technically the '''Narrow Bantu languages''', constitute a traditional sub-branch of the [[Niger–Congo languages]]. There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of [[mutual intelligibility]],<ref>Derek Nurse, 2006, "Bantu Languages", in the ''Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics''</ref> though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and ''[[Ethnologue]]'' counts 535 languages.<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=73-16 Ethnologue report for Southern Bantoid]. The figure of 535 includes the 13 [[Mbam languages]] considered Bantu in Guthrie's classification and thus counted by Nurse (2006)</ref> Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of the present day country of [[Cameroon]]; i.e., in the regions commonly known as [[Central Africa]], [[East Africa]], and [[Southern Africa]]. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map).

The Bantu language with the largest total number of speakers is [[Swahili language|Swahili]]; however, nearly all speakers know it as a [[second language]]. According to [[Ethnologue]], there are over 40 million L2 speakers, but only about 2 million native speakers.
{{sfn|Stanford|2013}}

According to [[Ethnologue]], [[Shona language|Shona]] is the most widely spoken as a first language,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size |title=Statistical Summaries: by Language Size |publisher=Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> with 10.8 million speakers, followed closely by [[Zulu language|Zulu]], with 10.3 million. Ethnologue also lists [[Manyika language|Manyika]] and [[Ndau language|Ndau]] as separate languages, though Shona speakers consider them to be two of the five main dialects of Shona. If the 3.4 million Manyika and Ndau speakers are included among the Shona, then Shona totals 14.2 million first-language speakers.

Ethnologue separates [[Kinyarwanda]] and [[Kirundi]], which are largely [[mutually intelligible]] and hence often considered dialects of a single [[Rwanda-Rundi]] language.  These two, grouped together, have 12.4 million speakers according to Ethnologue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size |title=Statistical Summaries |publisher=Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> (Other estimates may be significantly larger or smaller.  Estimates of number of speakers of most languages vary widely, due both to the lack of accurate statistics in most third-world countries and the difficulty in defining exactly where the boundaries of a language lie, particularly in the presence of a [[dialect continuum]].)

==Origin==
The Bantu languages descend from a common [[Proto-Bantu language]], which is believed to have been spoken in what is now [[Cameroon]] in [[West Africa]].<ref name="Adler">Philip J. Adler, Randall L. Pouwels, ''World Civilizations: To 1700 Volume 1 of World Civilizations'', (Cengage Learning: 2007), p.169.</ref> An estimated 2,500–3,000 years ago, although other sources put the start of the Bantu Expansion closer to 3000 BC,<ref>Genetic and Demographic Implications of the Bantu Expansion: Insights from Human Paternal Lineages  [http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/7/1581.abstract Gemma Berniell-Lee et al]</ref> speakers of the Proto-Bantu language began a series of migrations eastward and southward, carrying agriculture with them. This [[Bantu expansion]] came to dominate Sub-Saharan Africa east of Cameroon, an area where [[Bantu peoples]] now constitute nearly the entire population.<ref name="Adler"/><ref name="Falola">Toyin Falola, Aribidesi Adisa Usman, ''Movements, borders, and identities in Africa'', (University Rochester Press: 2009), p.4.</ref>

The technical term Bantu, simply meaning "people", was first used by [[Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel Bleek]] (1827–1875), as this is reflected in many of the languages of this group. A common characteristic of Bantu languages is that they use words such as ''muntu'' or ''mutu'' for "person", and the plural prefix for human nouns starting with ''mu-'' (class 1) in most languages is ''ba-'' (class 2), thus giving ''bantu'' for "people". Bleek, and later [[Carl Meinhof]], pursued extensive studies comparing the grammatical structures of Bantu languages.

==Classification==
{{main|Guthrie classification of Bantu languages}}
[[Image:Bantu zones.png|thumb|left|295px|The approximate locations of the sixteen Guthrie Bantu zones, including the addition of a zone J. The [[Jarawan languages]] are spoken in Nigeria.]]

The term 'narrow Bantu'  was coined by the ''Benue–Congo Working Group'' to distinguish Bantu as recognized by [[Malcolm Guthrie]] in his seminal 1948 classification of the Bantu languages, from the [[Bantoid languages]] not recognized as Bantu by Guthrie (1948). In recent times, the distinctiveness of Narrow Bantu as opposed to the other [[Southern Bantoid]] groups has been called into doubt (cf. Piron 1995, Williamson & Blench 2000, Blench 2011), but the term is still widely used. A coherent classification of Narrow Bantu will likely need to exclude many of the Zone A and perhaps Zone B languages.

There is no genealogical classification of the (Narrow) Bantu languages. The most widely used system, the alphanumeric coding system developed by Guthrie, is mainly geographic. However, based on reflexes of proto-Bantu tone patterns, zones A–C and part of D are grouped together as [[Northwest Bantu]] (or Forest Bantu), and zones D–S as [[Central Bantu]] (or Savanna Bantu). Northwest Bantu is more divergent internally than Central Bantu, and perhaps less [[conservative (language)|conservative]] due to contact with non-Bantu Niger–Congo languages; however, Central Bantu is likely the innovative line cladistically, with Northwest being the non-Central languages, not a family in their own right. Most attempted classifications are problematic as they consider only languages which happen to fall within traditional Narrow Bantu, rather than South Bantoid, which has been established, as a whole.

The only attempt at a detailed genetic classification to replace the Guthrie system is the 1999 "Tervuren" proposal of Bastin, Coupez, and Mann.<ref>The Guthrie, Tervuren, and SIL lists are compared side by side in [http://web.archive.org/web/20090325021837/http://www.african.gu.se/maho/downloads/bantulineup.pdf Maho 2002].</ref> However, it relies on [[lexicostatistics]], which, because it relies on similarity, rather than [[synapomorphy|shared innovations]], can lead to grouping together [[polyphyly|conservative languages which are not closely related]]. Meanwhile, ''[[Ethnologue]]'' has added languages to the Guthrie classification that Guthrie overlooked, while removing the [[Mbam languages]] (much of zone A), and shifting some languages between groups (much of zones D and E to a new zone J, for example, and part of zone L to K, and part of M to F) in an apparent effort at a semi-genetic, or at least semi-areal, classification. However, zone S ([[Southern Bantu]]) does appear to be a coherent group. The languages which share [[Dahl's Law]] may also form a valid group, [[Northeast Bantu]]. The infobox at right lists these together with various low-level groups that are fairly uncontroversial, though they continue to be revised. The development of a rigorous genealogical classification of many branches of Niger–Congo, not just Bantu, is hampered by insufficient data.

==Language structure==
Guthrie reconstructed both the phonemic inventory and the core vocabulary of Proto-Bantu.

The most prominent [[grammar|grammatical]] characteristic of Bantu languages is the extensive use of [[affix]]es (see [[Sesotho grammar|Sotho grammar]] and [[Luganda#Noun classes|Ganda noun classes]] for detailed discussions of these affixes). Each noun belongs to a [[Noun class|class]], and each language may have several numbered classes, somewhat like [[Gender (grammar)|genders]] in European languages. The class is indicated by a prefix that is part of the noun, as well as agreement markers on verb and qualificative roots connected with the noun. Plural is indicated by a change of class, with a resulting change of prefix.

The verb has a number of prefixes, though in the western languages these are often treated as independent words.<ref>Derek Nurse, 2008. ''Tense and aspect in Bantu'', p 70 (fn). In many of the Zone A, including [[Mbam languages|Mbam]], the verbs are clearly analytic.</ref> In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], for example, ''Mtoto mdogo amekisoma'', (also ''Kamwana kadoko kariverenga'' in [[Shona language]]) means 'The small child has read it [a book]'. ''Mtoto'' 'child' governs the adjective prefix ''m-'' and the verb subject prefix ''a-''. Then comes perfect tense ''-me-'' and an object marker ''-ki-'' agreeing with implicit ''kitabu'' 'book'. Pluralizing to 'children' gives ''Watoto wadogo wamekisoma'' (''Vana vadoko variverenga'' in Shona), and [[plural]]izing to 'books' (''vitabu'') gives ''Watoto wadogo wamevisoma''.

Bantu words are typically made up of [[open syllable]]s of the type CV (consonant-vowel) with most languages having syllables exclusively of this type. The [[Bushong language]] recorded by Vansina, however, has final consonants,<ref>Vansina, J. ''Esquisse de Grammaire Bushong''. Commission de Linguistique Africaine, Tervuren, Belgique, 1959.</ref> while slurring of the final syllable (though written) is reported as common among the [[Tonga language (Malawi)|Tonga]] of Malawi.<ref>Turner, Rev. Wm. Y., ''Tumbuka–Tonga$1–$2 $3ictionEnglish Dictionary''  Hetherwick Press, Blantyre, Malawi 1952. pages i–ii.</ref> The morphological shape of Bantu words is typically CV, VCV, CVCV, VCVCV, etc.; that is, any combination of CV (with possibly a V- syllable at the start). In other words, a strong claim for this language family is that almost all words end in a vowel, precisely because closed syllables (CVC) are not permissible in most of the documented languages, as far as is understood. This tendency to avoid [[consonant cluster]]s in some positions is important when words are imported from [[English language|English]] or other non-Bantu languages. An example from [[Chichewa]]: the word "school", borrowed from English, and then transformed to fit the sound patterns of this language, is ''sukulu''. That is, ''sk-'' has been broken up by inserting an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''-u-''; ''-u'' has also been added at the end of the word. Another example is ''buledi'' for "bread". Similar effects are seen in [[loanwords]] for other non-African CV languages like [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. However, a clustering of sounds at the beginning of a syllable can be readily observed in such languages as Shona,<ref>Doke, Clement M., ''A Comparative Study in Shona Phonetics'' University of Witwatersrand, Johannesberg, 1931.</ref> and the [[Makhuwa languages|Makhuwa]] variants.<ref>''Relatório do I Seminário sobre a Padronização da Ortografia de Línguas Moçambicanas''  NELIMO, Universidade Eduardo Mondlane. 1989.</ref>

===Reduplication===
[[Reduplication]] is a common morphological phenomenon in Bantu languages and is usually used to indicate frequency or intensity of the action signalled by the (unreduplicated) verb stem.<ref>Abdulaziz Lodhi, "[http://web.archive.org/web/20090325021837/http://www.african.gu.se/aa/pdfs/aa02004.pdf Verbal extensions in Bantu (the case of Swahili and Nyamwezi)]". ''Africa & Asia,'' 2002, 2:4–26, Göteborg University</ref>

*Example: in Swahili ''piga'' means "strike", ''pigapiga'' means "strike repeatedly".

Well-known words and names that have reduplication include
* [[Bafana Bafana]]
* [[Chipolopolo]]
* [[Eric Djemba-Djemba]]
* [[Lomana LuaLua|Lualua]]
* [[Ngorongoro]]
Repetition emphasizes the repeated word in the context that it is used. For instance, "Mwenda pole hajikwai," while, "Pole pole ndio mwendo," has two to emphasize the consistency of slowness of the pace. The meaning of the former in translation is, "He who goes slowly doesn't trip," and that of the latter is, "A slow but steady pace wins the race." Haraka haraka would mean hurrying just for the sake of hurrying, reckless hurry, as in "Njoo! Haraka haraka" [come here! Hurry, hurry].

On the contrary to the above definition, there are some words in some of the languages in which reduplication has the opposite meaning. It usually denotes short durations, and or lower intensity of the action and also means a few repetitions or a little bit more.

*Example 1: In Xitsonga and related, "famba" means to "walk" while "famba-famba" means to walk around.

*Example 2: in isiZulu and SiSwati ''hamba'' means "go", ''hambahamba'' means "go-go meaning go a little bit, but not much".

*Example 3: in both of the above languages ''shaya'' means "strike", ''shayashaya'' means "strike-strike, meaning strike a few more times lightly, but not heavy strikes and not too many times"

*Example 4: In Xitsonga, "hasahasa" means chaos. "Hasa" does not have a meaning.

==Notable Bantu languages==
Following are the principal Bantu languages of each country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.org |title=According to Ethnologue |publisher=Ethnologue.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> Included are those languages that constitute at least 1% of the population and have at least 10% the number of speakers of the largest Bantu language in the country.

Most languages are best known in English without the class prefix (''Swahili'', ''Tswana'', ''Ndebele''), but are sometimes seen with the (language-specific) prefix (''Kiswahili'', ''Setswana'', ''Sindebele''). In a few cases prefixes are used to distinguish languages with the same root in their name, such as [[Tshiluba]] and [[Kiluba]] (both ''Luba''), [[Umbundu]] and [[Kimbundu]] (both ''Mbundu''). The bare (prefixless) form typically does not occur in the language itself, but is the basis for other words based on the ethnicity. So, in the country of [[Botswana]] the people are the ''[[Batswana]]'', one person is a ''Motswana'', and the language is ''[[Setswana]]''; and in [[Uganda]], centred on the kingdom of ''[[Buganda]]'', the dominant ethnicity are the ''[[Baganda]]'' (sg. ''Muganda''), whose language is ''[[Luganda]]''.
