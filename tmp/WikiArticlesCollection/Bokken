A '''''bokken''''' ({{lang|ja|木剣}}, ''bok(u)'', "wood", and ''ken'', "sword") (or commonly as ''bokutō'' {{lang|ja|木刀}} in Japan) is a [[Japan]]ese [[waster|wooden sword]] used for training.  It is usually the size and shape of a ''[[katana]]'', but is sometimes shaped like other [[sword]]s, such as the ''[[wakizashi]]'' and ''[[tantō]]''.  Some ornamental bokken are decorated with mother-of-pearl work and elaborate carvings.

''Bokken'' should not be confused with ''[[shinai]]'', practice swords made of flexible bamboo.

==History==
''Bokken'' were designed to lessen the damage caused by fighting with real swords and were used for the training of [[samurai]] warriors in feudal Japan. Bokken eventually became lethal weapons themselves in the hands of trained experts.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Z9lmmkvQOpoC&pg=PA272&dq=samurai+bokken&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WUsuT-D4KIaftwftuqm-Cw&ved=0CGYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Secrets of the samurai: a survey of the martial arts of feudal Japan'',  Authors Oscar Ratti, Adele Westbrook, Contributor Adele, Westbrook Edition reprint, illustrated, Publisher Tuttle Publishing, 1991, ISBN 0-8048-1684-0, ISBN 978-0-8048-1684-7 P.272]</ref> 

[[Miyamoto Musashi]], a [[kenjutsu]] master, was renowned for fighting fully armed foes with only one or two bokken. In a famous legend, he defeated [[Sasaki Kojirō|Sasaki Kojiro]] with a bokken he had carved from an [[oar]] while traveling on a boat to the [[Ganryūjima|predetermined island]] for the duel.

==Usage==
[[File:Several bokken.jpg|thumb|130px|Various styles of bokken]]
The ''bokken'' is used as an inexpensive and relatively safe substitute for a real sword in several [[martial arts]] such as ''[[kendo]]'',  ''[[aikido]]'' and ''[[kenjutsu]]''. Its simple wooden construction demands less care and maintenance than a katana.  In addition, training with a bokken does not carry the same mortal risk associated with that of a sharp metal sword, both for the user and other practitioners near by. While its use has several advantages over use of a live edged weapon, it can still be deadly, and any training with a bokken should be done with due care. Injuries occurring from bokken are very similar to those caused by clubs and similar battering weapons and include compound fractures, ruptured organs, and other such blunt force injuries.  In some ways, a bokken can be more dangerous as the injuries caused are often unseen and inexperienced practitioners may underestimate the risk of harm. It is not a sparring weapon, but is intended to be used in [[kata]] and to acclimate the student to the feel of a real sword. For sparring, a bamboo [[shinai]] is typically used instead for obvious safety reasons.

In 2003, the [[All Japan Kendo Federation]] (AJKF) introduced a set of basic exercises using a ''bokuto'' called ''Bokuto Ni Yoru Kendo Kihon-waza Keiko-ho''. This form of practice is intended primarily for kendoka up to [[Dan (rank)#Ranks in Japanese|Nidan]], but can be beneficial for all kendo students.<ref>[http://zenkenren-shop.com/jp/kendo/book.html#010110 Bokuto Ni Yoru Kendo Kihon-waza Keiko-ho], 1 June 2003, All Japan Kendo Federation, Tokyo, Japan (no ISBN).</ref>

''[[Suburito]]'' are ''bokken'' designed for use in ''[[suburi]]''. ''Suburi'', literally "bare swinging," are solo cutting exercises. Suburito are thicker and heavier than normal ''bokken'' and users of suburito must therefore develop both strength and technique. Their weight makes them unsuitable for paired practice and kata. One famous user of the suburi-sized bokken is [[Miyamoto Musashi]] who used one in his duel against [[Sasaki Kojiro]].

Bokken are currently issued to the Los Angeles Police Mounted Unit for use as batons.<ref>{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Holly|title=Mounted Patrols Train for Handling Unrest at Convention|page=N3|accessdate=9 April 2011|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=August 6, 2000}}</ref><!-- April 8, 2011 - The August 6, 2000 Daily News cite is only for that the bokken were issued. It does not confirm that they are for use as batons. The Daily News article itself only has "The officers are also trained to use a bokken, a long wooden sword used only by mounted police." The LAPD's Mounted Unit is currently overseen by Captain Incontro (see http://www.lapdonline.org/metropolitan_division). I contacted him via e-mail and asked if the Wikipedia article claim "Bokken are currently issued to the Los Angeles Police Mounted Unit for use as batons" was true. He replied back with "We do use the bokken." -->

==Types of bokken==
Bokken can be made to represent any style of weapon required such as [[nagamaki]], [[Nodachi|no-dachi]], [[yari]], [[naginata]], [[kama (weapon)|kama]], etc. The most widely used styles are:

* ''daitō'' or ''tachi'' ([[katana]]-sized), long sword
* ''shoto'' or ''kodachi'' or ''wakizashi bo'', short sword, ([[wakizashi]]-sized)
* ''tantō bo'' ([[tantō]]-sized)
* ''suburito'' can be made in ''daitō'' and ''shoto'' sizes

Additionally, various [[koryu]] (traditional Japanese martial arts) have their own distinct styles of bokken which can vary slightly in length, tip shape, or in whether or not a tsuba (hilt guard) is added.

The [[All Japan Kendo Federation]] specify the dimensions of ''bokken'' for use in the modern kendo kata, called ''Nippon kendo kata''.<ref>[http://zenkenren-shop.com/en/eigo/index.html#050106 Japanese-English Dictionary of Kendo], All Japan Kendo Federation, Tokyo, Japan (no ISBN).</ref>
*Tachi: Total length, approx. 102&nbsp;cm; ''tsuka'' (handle) approx. 24&nbsp;cm.
*Kodachi: Total length, approx. 55&nbsp;cm; ''tsuka'' (handle) approx. 14&nbsp;cm.

==Bokken in fiction==

*In ''manga'', Hiroyuki Takei's  ''[[Shaman King]]'', Ryu possesses a wooden sword and uses it as his main weapon, and for that reason he is also known as Bokuto no Ryu (Wooden Sword Ryu).

*In anime ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'' is an example, Ikkaku Madarame carries a bokken when in his Gigai as he wasn't allowed to carry a real sword in public.

*In the manga/anime ''[[Gintama]]'', the main character, [[Gintoki Sakata]], wields a bokken as opposed to a katana, as the story takes place in an Edo period of an alternate timeline where a weapons ban has been imposed by imperialistic aliens.

*[[Date Masamune]] is often portrayed as using a bokken as his main weapon in several media he has appeared in, such as ''[[Samurai Deeper Kyo]]'' and the original ''[[Samurai Warriors]]''.

*In the [[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine limited series]] (1982) by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, Wolverine is beaten nearly to death by [[Shingen Yashida]], using a bokken.

*Kamiya Kaoru from "[[Rurouni Kenshin]]" is normally seen wielding a bokken.

*Tatewaki Kuno from "[[Ranma 1/2]]" as a Kendo practitioner and Captain of Kendo Club in Furinkan High, he always wield a bokken in his fight against ranma and other opponents.
* Aoi Kunieda and a member of the Red Tail, from the anime "Beelzeebub", use bokken as their main weapon.
