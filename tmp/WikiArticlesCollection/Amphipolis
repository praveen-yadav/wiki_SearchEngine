'''Amphipolis''' ({{lang-el|Ἀμφίπολις}}: ''Amphípolis'') is a municipality in the [[Serres (regional unit)|Serres regional unit]] of [[Greece]]. The seat of the municipality is [[Rodolivos]].<ref name=Kallikratis>[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}</ref>
In ancient times, it was a [[Polis|city]] in the region once inhabited by the [[Edoni]] people in the present-day [[modern regions of Greece|region]] of [[Central Macedonia]]. It was built on a raised plateau overlooking the east bank of the [[river]] [[Struma (river)|Strymon]] where it emerged from Lake Cercinitis, about 3 m. from the [[Aegean Sea]].

===Origins===
[[Archaeology]] has uncovered remains at the site dating to approximately 3000 BC.  Due to the strategic location of the site it was fortified from very early. In the 8th and 7th century BC the site of Amphipolis was ruled by [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boardman|first=John|title=The prehistory of the Balkans and the Middle East and the Aegean world, tenth to eighth centuries B.C.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vXljf8JqmkoC&pg=PA655&dq=Vergina+Illyrian&hl=en&ei=oB9PTKfaGMmisQbTvdG_AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Vergina%20Illyrian&f=false|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-22496-9|page=655}}</ref> [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes I]] [[Persia|of Persia]] passed during his invasion of Greece of 480 BC and buried alive nine young men and nine maidens as a sacrifice to the river god.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Near the later site of Amphipolis [[Alexander I of Macedon|Alexander I]] [[Macedon|of Macedon]] defeated the remains of Xerxes' army in 479 BC.

Throughout the 5th century BC, [[Delian League|Athens]] sought to consolidate its control over Thrace, which was strategically important because of its primary materials (the gold and silver of the [[Pangaion hills]] and the dense forests essential for naval construction), and the sea routes vital for Athens' supply of grain from [[Scythia]]. After a first unsuccessful attempt at colonisation in 497 BC by the [[Miletus|Milesian]] [[Tyrant]] [[Histiaeus]], the Athenians founded a first colony at Ennea-Hodoi (‘Nine Ways’) in 465, but these first ten thousand colonists were massacred by the [[Thracians]].<ref>[[Thucydides]] I, 100, 3</ref> A second attempt took place in 437 BC on the same site under the guidance of [[Hagnon]], son of [[Nicias]].

[[File:Plan Amphipolis-en.svg|thumb|250px|Map of Amphipolis.]]

The new settlement took the name of Amphipolis (literally, "around the city"), a name which is the subject of much debates about [[lexicography]]. Thucydides claims the name comes from the fact that the Strymon flows "around the city" on two sides;<ref>[http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&layout=&loc=4.102.3 Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> however a note in the [[Suda]] (also given in the lexicon of [[Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]) offers a different explanation apparently given by [[Marsyas]], son of [[Periander]]: that a large proportion of the population lived "around the city". However, a more probable explanation is the one given by [[Julius Pollux]]: that the name indicates the vicinity of an [[isthmus]]. Furthermore, the [[Etymologicum Genuinum]] gives the following definition: a city of the Athenians or of Thrace, which was once called Nine Routes, (so named) because it is encircled and surrounded by the Strymon river. This description corresponds to the actual site of the city (see adjacent map), and to the description of Thucydides.

Amphipolis subsequently became the main power base of the Athenians in Thrace and, consequently, a target of choice for their [[Sparta]]n adversaries. The Athenian population remained very much in the minority within the city.<ref>http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200;query=chapter%3D%23471;layout=;loc=4.105.1 Thucydide, IV.105.1=4.105</ref> A rescue expedition led by the Athenian strategos (general, and later historian) Thucydides had to settle for securing [[Eion]] and could not retake Amphipolis, a failure for which Thucydides was sentenced to exile. A new Athenian force under the command of [[Cleon]] failed once more in 422 BC during a [[Battle of Amphipolis|battle]] at which both Cleon and [[Brasidas]] lost their lives. Brasidas survived long enough to hear of the defeat of the Athenians and was buried at Amphipolis with impressive pomp. From then on he was regarded as the founder of the city<ref>[http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200;query=chapter%3D%23511;layout=;loc=5.10.1 Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Koukouli-Chrysanthaki Ch., "Excavating Classical Amphipoli", In (eds) Stamatopoulou M., and M., Yeroulanou <Excavating Classical Culture>, BAR International Series 1031, 2002:57-73</ref><ref>Agelarakis A., “Physical anthropological report on the cremated human remains of an individual retrieved from the Amphipolis agora”, In “Excvating Classical Amphipolis” by Koukouli-Chrysantkai Ch., <Excavating Classical Culture> (eds.)

and honoured with yearly games and sacrifices. The city itself kept its independence until the reign of the king [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] despite several other Athenian attacks, notably because of the government of [[Callistratus of Aphidnae|Callistratus]] [[Afidnes|of Aphidnae]].

===Conquest by the Romans===
[[File:Amphipolis fortifications.jpg|thumb|[[Fortification]]s and [[bridge]] of Amphipolis.]]

In 357 BC, Philip removed the block which Amphipolis presented on the road to Macedonian control over Thrace by conquering the town, which Athens had tried in vain to recover during the previous years. According the historian [[Theopompus]], this conquest came to be the object of a secret accord between [[Athens]] and Philip II, who would return the city in exchange for the fortified town of [[Pydna]], but the Macedonian king betrayed the accord, refusing to cede Amphipolis and laying siege to Pydna.

After the conquest by Philip II, the city was not immediately incorporated into the kingdom, and for some time preserved its institutions and a certain degree of autonomy. The border of Macedonia was not moved further east; however, Philip sent a number of Macedonian governors to Amphipolis, and in many respects the city was effectively ‘Macedonianized’. Nomenclature, the calendar and the currency (the [[Stater|gold stater]], installed by Philip to capitalise on the gold reserves of the Pangaion hills, replaced the Amphipolitan [[drachma]]) were all replaced by Macedonian equivalents. In the reign of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], Amphipolis was an important naval base, and the birthplace of three of the most famous Macedonian [[Admirals]]: [[Nearchus]], Androsthenes<ref>http://books.google.com/books?um=1&q=Androsthenes+Thasos&btnG=Search+Books</ref> and [[Laomedon of Mytilene|Laomedon]] whose burial place is most likely marked by the famous lion of Amphipolis.

Amphipolis became one of the main stops on the Macedonian royal road (as testified by a border stone found between [[Philippi]] and Amphipolis giving the distance to the latter), and later on the ‘[[Via Egnatia]]’, the principal [[Roman Road]] which crossed the southern Balkans. Apart from the ramparts of the lower town (see photograph), the gymnasium and a set of well-preserved frescoes from a wealthy villa are the only artifacts from this period that remain visible. Though little is known of the layout of the town, modern knowledge of its institutions is in considerably better shape thanks to a rich epigraphic documentation, including a military ordinance of [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] and an [[Ephebarchy|ephebarchic]] (?) law from the gymnasium. After the final victory of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] over Macedonia in a [[Battle of Pydna|battle]] in 168 BC, Amphipolis became the capital one of the four mini-republics, or ‘merides’, which were created by the Romans out of the kingdom of the [[Antigonid Dynasty|Antigonids]] which [[Alexander the Great#Legacy and division of the empire|succeeded]] Alexander’s Empire in Macedon. These 'merides' were gradually incorporated into the Roman client state, and later province, of [[Thracia]].

===Revival in Late Antiquity===
During the period of [[Late Antiquity]], Amphipolis benefited from the increasing economic prosperity of Macedonia, as is evidenced by the large number of [[Christianity|Christian Churches]] that were built. Significantly however, these churches were built within a restricted area of the town, sheltered by the walls of the [[acropolis]]. This has been taken as evidence that the large fortified perimeter of the ancient town was no longer defendable, and that the population of the city had considerably diminished.

Nevertheless, the number, size and quality of the churches constructed between the fifth and sixth centuries are impressive. Four [[basilica]]s adorned with rich [[mosaic]] floors and elaborate architectural sculptures (such as the ram-headed [[column]] capitals - see picture) have been excavated, as well as a church with a hexagonal central plan which evokes that of the [[Basilica of San Vitale|basilica]] of [[Saint Vitalis of Milan|St. Vitalis]] in [[Ravenna]]. It is difficult to find reasons for such municipal extravagance in such a small town. One possible explanation provided by the historian [[André Boulanger]] is that an increasing ‘willingness’ on the part of the wealthy upper classes in the late Roman period to spend money on local [[gentrification]] projects (which he terms ''[[euergetism]]'', from the Greek verb εύεργετέω, (meaning 'I do good') was exploited by the local church to its advantage, which led to a mass gentrification of the urban centre and of the agricultural riches of the city’s territory. Amphipolis was also a [[diocese]] under the [[suffragan]] of [[Thessaloniki]] - the Bishop of Amphipolis is first mentioned in 533.

===From the reduction of the urban area to the disappearance of the city===
<!---this title needs simplification. Too obscure--->
[[File:Amphipolis capitol.jpg|thumb|Ram-headed capital of a column from a pre-Christian temple.]]

The [[Human migration#The great migrations|Slavic invasions]] of the late 6th century gradually encroached on the back-country Amphipolitan lifestyle and led to the decline of the town, during which period its inhabitants retreated to the area around the acropolis. The ramparts were maintained to a certain extent, thanks to materials plundered from the monuments of the lower city, and the large unused cisterns of the upper city were occupied by small houses and the workshops of artisans. Around the middle of the 7th century AD, a further reduction of the inhabited area of the city was followed by an increase in the fortification of the town, with the construction of a new rampart with pentagonal towers cutting through the middle of the remaining monuments. The acropolis, the [[Thermae|Roman baths]], and especially the Episcopal basilica were crossed by this wall.

The city was probably abandoned in the eighth century, as the last bishop was attested in 787. Its inhabitants probably moved to the neighbouring site of ancient Eion, port of Amphipolis, which had been rebuilt and refortified in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]]  under the name “[[Chrysopolis]]”. This small port continued to enjoy some prosperity, before being abandoned during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]]. The last recorded sign of activity in the region of Amphipolis was the construction of a fortified tower to the north in 1367 by [[Grand Primicier]] Jean and the [[Stratopedarch]] Alexis to protect the land that they had given to the monastery of Pantokrator on [[Mount Athos]].

==Archaeology==
[[File:Amphipolis frescoes.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] from a house (Hellenistic period).]]

The site was rediscovered and described by many travellers and archaeologists during  the 19th century, including E. Cousinéry (1831) (engraver), L. Heuzey (1861), and P. Perdrizet (1894–1899). In 1934, M. Feyel, of the [[École française d'Athènes]], led an [[epigraphy|epigraphical mission]] to the site and uncovered the remains of a funeral lion (a reconstruction was given in the,<ref>[http://cefael.efa.gr/detail.php?site_id=1&actionID=page&prevpos=0&serie_id=BCH&volume_number=59&issue_number=0&startpos=289 Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique] {{fr icon}}</ref> a publication of the EfA which is available on line). However, excavations did not truly begin until after the Second World War. The [[Archaeological Society of Athens|Greek Archaeological Society]] under D. Lazaridis excavated in 1972 and 1985, uncovering a necropolis, the rampart of the old town (see photograph), the basilicas, and the acropolis.
