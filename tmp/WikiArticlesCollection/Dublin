'''Dublin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ʌ|b|l|i-|n}}; locally {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ʊ|b|(ə)|l|ən}}; {{Irish place name|Baile Átha Cliath|town of the hurdled ford}}, {{IPA-ga|blʲaˈklʲiə|pron}} or ''Áth Cliath'', {{IPA-ga|aː klʲiə|}}, occasionally ''Duibhlinn'') is the capital and most populous city of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geography.ie/geography/social/docs/dublin.pdf |title=The Growth and Development of Dublin |format=PDF |accessdate=30 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/primate+city |title=Primate City Definition and Examples |accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref> The English name for the city is derived from the Irish name ''Dubhlinn'', meaning "black pool". Dublin is situated in the province of [[Leinster]] near the midpoint of Ireland's east coast, at the mouth of the [[River Liffey]] and the centre of the [[Dublin Region]].

Founded as a [[Viking]] settlement, it evolved into the [[Kings of Dublin|Kingdom of Dublin]] and became the island's principal city following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]]. The city expanded rapidly from the 17th century; it was briefly the second largest city in the [[British Empire]] and the fifth largest in Europe. Dublin entered a period of stagnation following the [[Act of Union, 1800|Act of Union]] of 1800, but it remained the economic centre for most of the island. Following the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1922, the new parliament, the [[Oireachtas]], was located in [[Leinster House]]. Dublin became the capital of the [[Irish Free State]] and later the Republic of Ireland.

Like the cities of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Galway]] and [[Waterford]], Dublin is administered separately from its respective [[Counties of Ireland|County]] with its own [[Dublin City Council|City Council]]. The city is listed by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]] (GaWC) as a [[global city]], with a ranking of "Alpha-", placing Dublin among the top 30 cities in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zyen.com/GFCI/GFCI%208.pdf |title=Global Financial Centres Index 8 |format=PDF |accessdate=30 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2008t.html |title= The World According to GaWC 2008 |publisher=Globalization and World Cities Research Network: [[Loughborough University]] |accessdate=6 November 2009 |date=3 June 2009 }}</ref> It is a historical and contemporary cultural centre for the country, as well as a modern centre of education, the arts, administration, economy, and industry.

==History==
{{Main|History of Dublin}}

===Toponymy===
Although the area of [[Dublin Bay]] has been inhabited by humans since prehistoric times, the writings of [[Ptolemy]] (the Egyptian astronomer and cartographer) in about 140 AD provide possibly the earliest reference to a settlement there. He called the settlement {{lang|la|''[[Eblana|Eblana Civitas]]''}}.

The name ''Dublin'' comes from the Irish name ''Dubhlinn'' or ''Duibhlinn'', meaning "black pool". This is made up of the elements ''dubh'' (black) and ''linn'' (pool). In most Irish dialects, ''dubh'' is pronounced {{IPA-ga|ˈd̪ˠʊvˠ|}}. The original pronunciation is preserved in the names for the city in other languages such as [[Old English]] ''Di'''f'''elin'', [[Old Norse]] ''Dy'''f'''lin'', modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''Dy'''f'''linn'' and modern [[Manx language|Manx]] ''Di'''v'''lyn''. Other localities in Ireland also bear the name ''Duibhlinn'', variously anglicized as Devlin,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/14364.aspx |title=Placenames Database of Ireland: Duibhlinn/Devlin |date= |accessdate=2013-09-13}}</ref> Divlin<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/13534.aspx |title=Placenames Database of Ireland: Béal Duibhlinne/Ballydivlin |date= |accessdate=2013-09-13}}</ref> and Difflin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/16486.aspx |title=Placenames Database of Ireland: Duibhlinn/Difflin |date= |accessdate=2013-09-13}}</ref> Historically, scribes using the [[Insular script|Gaelic script]] wrote ''bh'' with a dot over the ''b'', rendering {{unicode|Duḃlinn}} or {{unicode|Duiḃlinn}}. Those without knowledge of Irish omitted the dot, spelling the name as ''Dublin''.

''{{lang|ga|Baile Átha Cliath}}'', meaning "town of the [[hurdle]]d [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]", is the common name for the city in modern Irish. ''{{lang|ga|Áth Cliath}}'' is a place name referring to a [[ford (crossing)|fording]] point of the [[River Liffey]] near [[Father Mathew Bridge]]. ''{{lang|ga|Baile Átha Cliath}}'' was an early Christian monastery, believed to have been in the area of Aungier Street, currently occupied by [[Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church]].

[[File:Dublin - Father Mathew Bridge - 110508 182542.jpg|thumb|[[Father Mathew Bridge]] is understood to be near the ancient "Ford of the Hurdles" (''Baile Átha Cliath''), the original crossing point on the [[River Liffey]].]]

The subsequent [[Scandinavia]]n settlement centred on the [[River Poddle]], a tributary of the Liffey in an area now known as [[Wood Quay]]. The Dubhlinn was a small lake used to moor ships; the Poddle connected the lake with the Liffey. This lake was covered during the early 18th century as the city grew. The Dubhlinn lay where the Castle Garden is now located, opposite the [[Chester Beatty Library]] in [[Dublin Castle]]. ''[[Táin Bó Cuailgne]]'' ("The Cattle Raid of Cooley") refers to ''Dublind rissa ratter Áth Cliath'', meaning "Dublin, which is called Ath Cliath".

===Middle Ages===
Dublin was established as a [[Viking]] settlement in the 9th century and, despite a number of rebellions by the native
Irish, it remained largely under Viking control until the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] was launched from [[Wales]] in 1169.<ref name="Davies">{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Norman | authorlink = Norman Davies | title = The Isles: a history | publisher=Macmillan | year = 1999 | location = London | page = 1222 | isbn = 0-333-76370-X}}</ref> The King of Leinster, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], enlisted the help of [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]], the Earl of Pembroke, to conquer Dublin. Following Mac Murrough's death, Strongbow declared himself King of Leinster after gaining control of the city. In response to Strongbow's successful invasion, King [[Henry II of England]] reaffirmed his sovereignty by mounting a larger invasion in 1171 and pronounced himself [[Lord of Ireland]].<ref name="Dublin.info">{{cite web|url=http://www.dublin.info/history|title=A Brief History of Dublin, Ireland|publisher=Dublin.info|accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref> Around this time, the county of the City of Dublin was established along with certain [[Liberty (division)|liberties]] adjacent to the city proper. This continued down to 1840 when the Barony of Dublin City was separated from the [[Barony of Dublin]]. Since 2001, both [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] have been redesignated the City of Dublin.

[[File:Dublin castle.JPG|thumb|left|[[Dublin Castle]] was the fortified seat of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British rule]] in Ireland until 1922.]]

[[Dublin Castle]], which became the centre of Norman power in Ireland, was founded in 1204 as a major defensive work on the orders of King [[John of England]].<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Fitzhenry, Meiler}}</ref> Following the appointment of the first [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]] in 1229, the city expanded and had a population of 8,000 by the end of the 13th century. Dublin prospered as a trade centre, despite an attempt by King [[Robert I of Scotland]] to capture the city in 1317.<ref name="Dublin.info"/> It remained a relatively small walled medieval town during the 14th century and was under constant threat from the surrounding native clans. In 1348, the [[Black Death]], a lethal plague which had ravaged Europe, took hold in Dublin and killed thousands over the following decade.<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=R688at3KskQC&pg=PA49&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Story of Ireland]''". Brian Igoe (2009). p.49.</ref><ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=yw3HmjRvVQMC&pg=PA58&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Black Death]''". Joseph Patrick Byrne (2004). p.58. ISBN 0-313-32492-1</ref>

Dublin was incorporated into the [[English Crown]] as [[the Pale]], which was a narrow strip of English settlement along the eastern seaboard. The [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] in the 16th century spelt a new era for
Dublin, with the city enjoying a renewed prominence as the centre of administrative rule in Ireland. Determined to make Dublin a Protestant city, Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] established [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in 1592 as a solely Protestant university and ordered that the Catholic [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] cathedrals be converted to Protestant.<ref name="visitingdublin">{{cite web|url=http://visitingdublin.com/downloads/HistoryOfDublin.pdf|title=A Brief History of Dublin|publisher=visitingdublin|accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>

The city had a population of 21,000 in 1640 before a plague in 1649–51 wiped out almost half of the city's inhabitants. However, the city prospered again soon after as a result of the wool and linen trade with England, reaching a population of over 50,000 in 1700.<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=gI8MYY6ASdcC&pg=PA34&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Dublin: a cultural history]''". Siobhán Marie Kilfeather (2005). [[Oxford University Press US]]. pp. 34–35. ISBN 0-19-518201-4</ref>

===Early modern===
[[File:HENRIETTA STREET - DUBLIN (402556531).jpg|thumb|[[Henrietta Street]], developed in the 1720s, is the earliest Georgian Street in Dublin.]]
As the city continued to prosper during the 18th century, [[Georgian Dublin]] became, for a short period, the second largest city of the [[British Empire]] and the fifth largest city in Europe, with the population exceeding 130,000. The vast majority of Dublin's most notable architecture dates from this period, such as the [[Four Courts]] and [[the Custom House]]. [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] and [[Grafton Street]] are two of the few remaining areas that were not affected by the wave of Georgian reconstruction and maintained their medieval character.<ref name="visitingdublin"/>

Dublin grew even more dramatically during the 18th century, with the construction of many famous districts and buildings, such as [[Merrion Square]], [[Irish Houses of Parliament|Parliament House]] and the [[City Hall, Dublin|Royal Exchange]].<ref name="visitingdublin"/>  The [[Wide Streets Commission]] was established in 1757 at the request of [[Dublin Corporation]] to govern architectural standards on the layout of streets, bridges and buildings. In 1759, the founding of the [[Guinness brewery]] resulted in a considerable economic gain for the city. For much of the time since its foundation, the brewery was Dublin's largest employer.

===Late modern and contemporary===
[[File:GeneralPostOfficeDublin 20060803 KaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|[[General Post Office (Dublin)|The GPO]] on [[O'Connell Street]] was at the centre of the 1916 Easter Rising.]]
Dublin suffered a period of political and economic decline during the 19th century following the [[Act of Union, 1800|Act of Union]] of 1800, under which the [[seat of government]] was transferred to the [[Westminster Parliament]] in London. The city played no major role in the [[Industrial Revolution]], but remained the centre of administration and a transport hub for most of the island. Ireland had no significant sources of coal, the fuel of the time, and Dublin was not a centre of ship manufacturing, the other main driver of industrial development in Britain and Ireland.<ref name="Davies"/> [[Belfast]] developed faster than Dublin during this period on a mixture of [[international trade]], factory-based linen [[cloth production]] and shipbuilding.<ref name="Lyons">{{cite book | last = Lyons | first = F.S.L. | authorlink = F.S.L. Lyons | title = Ireland since the famine | publisher=Collins / Fontana | year = 1973 | location = Suffolk | isbn = 0-00-633200-5 | page = 880}}</ref>

The [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, the [[Irish War of Independence]], and the subsequent [[Irish Civil War]] resulted in a significant amount of physical destruction in central Dublin. The [[Government of the Irish Free State]] rebuilt the city centre and located the new parliament, the [[Oireachtas]], in [[Leinster House]]. Since the beginning of [[Normans|Norman]] rule in the 12th century, the city has functioned as the capital in varying [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] entities: [[Lordship of Ireland]] (1171–1541), [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1541–1800), island as part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (1801–1922), and the [[Irish Republic]] (1919–1922). Following the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1922, it became the capital of the [[Irish Free State]] (1922–1949) and now is the capital of the Republic of Ireland. One of the memorials to commemorate that time is the [[Garden of Remembrance (Dublin)|Garden of Remembrance]].

Since 1997, the landscape of Dublin has changed immensely. The city was at the forefront of Ireland's rapid economic expansion during the [[Celtic Tiger]] period, with enormous private sector and state development of housing, transport and business.

==Government==

===Local===
[[File:Dublin City Council Civic Offices.JPG|thumb|Civic Offices of [[Dublin City Council]].]]
From 1842, the boundaries of the city were comprehended by the [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of Dublin City and  the [[Barony of Dublin]]. In 1930, the boundaries were extended by the Local Government (Dublin) Act.<ref>[[Irish Statute Book]]. [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1930/en/act/pub/0027/sched1.html#sched1 Local Government (Dublin) Act]</ref> Later in 1953, the boundaries were again extended by the Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1953/en/act/prv/0001/print.html |title=Irish statute book, Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Act, 1953 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=1953-03-28 |accessdate=2013-09-13}}</ref>

[[Dublin City Council]] is a [[unicameral]] assembly of 52 members elected every five years from [[Local Electoral Area|Local Election Areas]]. It is presided over by the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin|Lord Mayor]], who is elected for a yearly term and resides in [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]]. Council meetings occur at [[Dublin City Hall]], while most of its administrative activities are based in the Civic Offices on [[Wood Quay]]. The party or coalition of parties, with the majority of seats adjudicates committee members, introduces policies, and appoints the Lord Mayor. The Council passes an annual budget for spending on areas such as housing, traffic management, refuse, drainage, and planning. The Dublin City Manager is responsible for implementing City Council decisions.

===National===
[[File:Leinsterhouse.jpg|right|thumb|[[Leinster House]] on Kildare Street houses the [[Oireachtas]].]]
As the capital city, Dublin seats the national parliament of Ireland, the [[Oireachtas]]. It is composed of the [[President of Ireland]], [[Seanad Éireann]] as the upper house, and [[Dáil Éireann]] as the lower house. The President resides in [[Áras an Uachtaráin]] in the [[Phoenix Park]], while both houses of the Oireachtas meet in [[Leinster House]], a former ducal palace on [[Kildare Street]]. It has been the home of the Irish parliament since the creation of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922. The old [[Irish Houses of Parliament]] of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] were located in [[College Green]].

[[Government Buildings]] house the [[Department of the Taoiseach]], the Council Chamber, the Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General. It consists of a main building (completed 1911) with two wings (completed 1921). It was designed by Thomas Manley Dean and Sir [[Aston Webb]] as the [[Royal College of Science (Ireland)|Royal College of Science]]. The [[First Dáil]] originally met in the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]] in 1919. The Irish Free State government took over the two wings of the building to serve as a temporary home for some ministries, while the central building became the College of Technology until 1989.<ref>Department of the Taoiseach: Guide to Government Buildings (2005)</ref> Although both it and Leinster House were intended to be temporary, they became the permanent homes of parliament from then on.

For elections to [[Dáil Éireann]] the city is divided into five constituencies: [[Dublin Central (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin Central]] (4 seats), [[Dublin North-Central (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin North–Central]] (3 seats), [[Dublin North-East (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin North-East]] (3 seats), [[Dublin North–West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin North–West]] (3 seats), [[Dublin South-Central (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin South–Central]] (5 seats) and [[Dublin South–East (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin South–East]] (4 seats). 22 TD's are elected in total. Dublin North–East, Dublin North–West and Dublin South–Central also take in parts of [[Fingal]] and [[South Dublin]].

===Politics===
In the past Dublin city was regarded as a stronghold for [[Fianna Fáil]],{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} however following the [[Irish local elections, 2004]] the party was eclipsed by the centre-left [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/results/local/council.cfm?election=2004L&area=249 |title=2004 Local Elections&nbsp;— Electoral Area Details |publisher=Elections Ireland |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> In the 2011 general election the city elected 18 [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]], 17 [[Fine Gael]], 4 [[Sinn Féin]],2 [[Socialist Party]], 2 [[People Before Profit Alliance]] and 3 Independent TDs. Fianna Fáil lost all but one of its sitting TDs in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/results/general/31dail.cfm|title=2011 General Election|publisher=Elections Ireland |date= |accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref>

==Geography==

===Landscape===
[[File:Dublin SPOT 1023.jpg|thumb|Satellite image showing the [[River Liffey]] entering the [[Irish Sea]] as it divides Dublin into the [[Northside (Dublin)|Northside]] and the [[Southside (Dublin)|Southside]].]]
Dublin is situated at the mouth of the [[River Liffey]] and encompasses a land area of approximately 115&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. It is bordered by a low mountain range to the south and surrounded by flat farmland to the north and west.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/press/factsaboutdublin/pages/factsaboutdublin.aspx |title=Dublin City Council&nbsp;– Facts About Dublin City |publisher=Dublincity.ie |date= |accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref> The
Liffey divides the city in two between the [[Northside (Dublin)|Northside]] and the [[Southside (Dublin)|Southside]]. Each of these is further divided by two lesser rivers&nbsp;– the [[River Tolka]] running northwest from Dubin Bay, and the [[River Dodder]] running southwest from the mouth of the Liffey. Two further water bodies&nbsp;– the [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand Canal]] on the southside and the [[Royal Canal of Ireland|Royal Canal]] on the northside&nbsp;– ring the inner city on their way to the west and the [[River Shannon]].

The River Liffey bends at [[Leixlip]] from a predominantly east-west direction to a southwesterly route, and this point also marks the change from urban development to more agricultural land usage.<ref name="erdb">{{cite web|title = Characterisation of the Liffey Catchment Area | url= http://www.erbd.ie/Reports/CR/Section7.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref>

====Cultural divide====
A north-south division has traditionally existed, with the River Liffey as the divider. The [[Northside (Dublin)|Northside]] is generally seen as [[working class]], while the [[Southside (Dublin)|Southside]] is seen as [[Middle Class|middle]] to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle class]]. The divide is punctuated by examples of Dublin "sub-culture" [[stereotype]]s, with upper-middle class constituents seen as tending towards an accent and demeanour synonymous with the Southside, and working-class Dubliners seen as tending towards characteristics associated with Northside and inner-city areas. Dublin's economic divide is east-west as well as north-south. There are also social divisions evident between the coastal suburbs in the east of the city, including those on the northside, and the newer developments further to the west.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wn.com/s/dublincity/index2.html |title=Northside vs Southside |publisher=Wn.com |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2013-09-13}}</ref>

===Climate===
Similar to much of northwest Europe, Dublin experiences a [[maritime climate]] with mild winters, cool summers, and a lack of temperature extremes. The average maximum January temperature is {{convert|8.8|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while the average maximum July temperature is {{convert|20.2|°C|0|abbr=on}}. On average, the sunniest months are May and June, while the wettest month is October with {{convert|76|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain, and the driest month is February with {{convert|46|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year.

[[Ringsend]] in the south of the city records the least amount of rainfall in Ireland, with an average annual precipitation of {{convert|683|mm|0|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite web |publisher=European Climate Assessment & Dataset |title=Climatology details for station DUBLIN (RINGSEND), IRELAND and index RR: Precipitation sum |url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=0&periodid=1981-2010&indexid=RR&stationid=1958 |accessdate=21 December 2012}}</ref> with the average annual precipitation in the city centre being {{convert|714|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The main precipitation in winter is rain; however snow showers do occur between November and March. Hail is more common than snow. The city experiences long summer days and short winter days. Strong Atlantic winds are most common in autumn. These winds can affect Dublin, but due to its easterly location it is least affected compared to other parts of the country. However conversely in winter, easterly winds render the city more prone to snow showers.

[[File:O'Connell Street Dublin & Jim Larkin.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Spire of Dublin]] rises behind the statue of [[James Larkin|Jim Larkin]].]]
Dublin has many landmarks and monuments dating back hundreds of years. One of the oldest is [[Dublin Castle]], which was first founded as a major defensive work on the orders of King [[John of England]] in 1204, shortly after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169, when it was commanded that a castle be built with strong walls and good ditches for the defence of the city, the administration of justice, and the protection of the King's treasure.<ref name=history>{{cite book|last= McCarthy|first= Denis | coauthors= Benton, David |year= 2004|title= Dublin Castle: at the heart of Irish History|location= Dublin|publisher=Irish Government Stationary Office |pages= 12–18|isbn= 0-7557-1975-1}}</ref> Largely complete by 1230, the castle was of typical Norman courtyard design, with a central square without a [[keep]], bounded on all sides by tall defensive walls and protected at each corner by a circular tower. Sited to the south-east of Norman Dublin, the castle formed one corner of the outer perimeter of the city, using the [[River Poddle]] as a natural means of defence.

One of Dublin's newest monuments is the [[Spire of Dublin]], or officially titled "Monument of Light".<ref>

It replaces [[Nelson's Pillar]] and is intended to mark Dublin's place in the 21st century. The spire was designed by [[Ian Ritchie Architects]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archiseek.com/2010/2003-the-dublin-spire-oconnell-street-dublin/ |title=The Dublin Spire |publisher=Archiseek |year=2003 |accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref> who sought an "Elegant and dynamic simplicity bridging art and technology". During the day it maintains its steel look, but at dusk the monument appears to merge into the sky. The base of the monument is lit and the top is illuminated to provide a beacon in the night sky across the city.

Many people visit [[Trinity College, Dublin]] to see the [[Book of Kells]] in the library there. The Book of Kells is an illustrated manuscript created by Irish monks circa. 800 AD. The [[Ha'penny Bridge]]; an old iron footbridge over the River Liffey is one of the most photographed sights in Dublin and is considered to be one of Dublin's most iconic landmarks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traveldir.org/articles/europe/ireland/dublin/some_famous_landmarks_of_dublin.html |title=Some Famous Landmarks of Dublin&nbsp;– Dublin Hotels & Travel Guide |publisher=Traveldir.org |date=8 March 1966 |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>

Other popular landmarks and monuments include the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]], the [[Anna Livia (monument)|Anna Livia monument]], the [[Molly Malone|Molly Malone statue]], [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]], [[Saint Francis Xavier Church, Dublin|Saint Francis Xavier Church]] on [[Gardiner Street, Dublin|Upper Gardiner Street]] near [[Mountjoy Square, Dublin|Mountjoy Square]], [[The Custom House]], and [[Áras an Uachtaráin]]. The [[Poolbeg Generating Station|Poolbeg Towers]] are also iconic features of Dublin and are visible in many spots around the city.

===Parks===
Dublin has more green spaces per square kilometre than any other European capital city, with 97% of city residents living within 300 metres of a park area. The city council provides {{convert|2.96|ha|acre}} of public green space per 1,000 people and 255 playing fields. The council also plants approximately 5,000 trees annually and manages over {{convert|1500|ha|acre}} of parks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/RecreationandCulture/DublinCityParks/Pages/Facts%20About%20Our%20Parks.aspx |title=Dublin City Council&nbsp;– '&#39;Facts About Our Parks'&#39; |publisher=Dublincity.ie |date= |accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref>

[[File:St Stephen's Green.jpg|thumb|left|[[Saint Stephen's Green]]]]
There are many park areas around the city, including the [[Phoenix Park]], [[Herbert Park]] and [[St Stephen's Green]]. The Phoenix Park is about {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=in}} west of the city centre, north of the [[River Liffey]]. Its {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=in}} perimeter wall encloses {{convert|707|ha|acre}} one of the largest walled city parks in Europe.<ref>It is over twice the size of New York's Central Park.

The park is also home to [[Dublin Zoo]], the official residence of the [[United States Ambassador to Ireland|United States Ambassador]], and [[Ashtown Castle]]. Music concerts have also been performed in the park by many singers and musicians.

St Stephen's Green is adjacent to one of Dublin's main shopping streets, [[Grafton Street, Dublin|Grafton Street]], and to a shopping centre named for it, while on its surrounding streets are the offices of a number of public bodies and the city terminus of one of Dublin's [[Luas]] tram lines. [[Saint Anne's Park]] is a public park and recreational facility, shared between [[Raheny]] and [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]], both suburbs on the [[Northside (Dublin)|North Side of Dublin]].
The park, the second largest municipal park in Dublin, is part of a former {{convert|2|km²|0|abbr=out}} (500 acre) estate assembled by members of the [[Guinness family]], beginning with [[Benjamin Lee Guinness]] in 1835 (the largest municipal park is nearby (North) [[Bull Island]], also shared between Clontarf and Raheny).

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Dublin}}

The Dublin region is the economic centre of Ireland, and was at the forefront of the country's rapid economic expansion during the [[Celtic Tiger]] period. In 2009, Dublin was listed as the fourth richest city in the world by [[purchasing power]] and 10th richest by [[personal income]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/economics/usb-purchasing-power.html |title=Richest cities in the world by purchasing power in 2009 |publisher=City Mayors |accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/economics/richest_cities.html |title=Richest cities in the world by personal earnings in 2009 |publisher=Citymayors.com |date=22 August 2009 |accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> According to ''Mercer's 2011 Worldwide Cost of Living Survey'', Dublin is the 13th most expensive city in the [[European Union]] (down from 10th in 2010) and the 58th most expensive place to live in the world (down from 42nd in 2010).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0712/breaking23.html|title=Dublin falls in city-cost rankings |publisher=Irish Times |date=12 July 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> As of 2005, approximately 800,000 people were employed in the [[Greater Dublin Area]], of whom around 600,000 were employed in the services sector and 200,000 in the [[industrial sector]].<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20060901000000*/http://www.dubchamber.ie/Uploads/Policy.pdf Dublin employment] (archived link)|256&nbsp;KB}}</ref>{{Update after|2011|reason=Seven year have elapsed and the economy has tanked, so figures need updating or put in content to the current situation}}

[[File:Grafton St, Dublin.jpg|thumb|[[Grafton Street]] is a principal shopping street in Dublin's city centre]]
Many of Dublin's traditional industries, such as food processing, textile manufacturing, brewing, and distilling have gradually declined, although [[Guinness]] has been brewed at the [[St. James's Gate Brewery]] since 1759. Economic improvements in the 1990s have attracted a large number of global pharmaceutical, information and communications technology companies to the city and [[Greater Dublin Area]]. Companies such as [[Microsoft]], [[Google]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[eBay]], [[PayPal]], [[Yahoo!]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and [[Pfizer]] now have European headquarters and/or operational bases in the city. 

[[File:The Ulster Bank Group HQ, George's Quay Plaza - geograph.org.uk - 1743476.jpg|thumb|[[Ulster Bank]] on [[George's Quay Plaza]].]]
Financial services have also become important to the city since the establishment of Dublin's [[International Financial Services Centre]] in 1987, which is globally recognised as a leading location for a range of internationally traded financial services.  More than 500 operations are approved to trade in under the IFSC programme. The centre is host to half of the world's top 50 banks and to half of the top 20 insurance companies.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ifsc.ie/page.aspx?idpage=6|title=I.F.S.C |publisher=I.F.S.C.ie |date= 21 June 2010 |accessdate=21 January 2010}}</ref> Many international firms have established major headquarters in the city, such as [[Citibank]] and [[Commerzbank]]. The [[Irish Stock Exchange]] (ISEQ), [[Internet Neutral Exchange]] (INEX) and [[Irish Enterprise Exchange]] (IEX) are also located in Dublin. The [[Boom and bust|economic boom]] led to a sharp increase in construction, with large redevelopment projects in the [[Dublin Docklands]] and [[Spencer Dock]]. Completed projects include the [[Convention Centre Dublin|Convention Centre]], [[The O2 (Dublin)|The O<sub>2</sub>]], and the [[Grand Canal Theatre]].

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Dublin}}

===Road===
[[File:DublinM50.png|thumb|The [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50 motorway]] surrounding Dublin.]]
The road network in Ireland is primarily focused on Dublin. The [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50 motorway]], a semi-[[ring road]] which runs around the south, west and north of the city, connects important national primary routes to the rest of the country. In 2008, the [[West-Link]] toll bridge was replaced by the [[eFlow]] barrier-free tolling system, with a three-tiered charge system based on electronic tags and car pre-registration. The toll is currently €2 for vehicles with a pre-paid tag, €2.50 for vehicles whose number plates have been registered with [[eFlow]], and €3 for unregistered vehicles.<ref>{{cite web | title = E-Flow Website | publisher=eFlow | url = http://eflow.ie/| doi = | accessdate =29 July 2011 }}</ref>

The first phase of a proposed eastern bypass for the city is the [[Dublin Port Tunnel]], which officially opened in 2006 to mainly cater for heavy vehicles. The tunnel connects [[Dublin Port]] and the [[M1 motorway (Republic of Ireland)|M1 motorway]] close to Dublin Airport. The city is also surrounded by an inner and outer orbital route. The inner orbital route runs approximately around the heart of the Georgian city and the outer orbital route runs primarily along the natural circle formed by Dublin's two canals, the [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand Canal]] and the [[Royal Canal of Ireland|Royal Canal]], as well as the North and South Circular Roads.

Dublin is served by an extensive network of nearly 200 bus routes which serve all areas of the city and suburbs. The majority of these are controlled by [[Dublin Bus]], but a number of smaller companies also operate. Fares are generally calculated on a stage system based on distance travelled. There are several different levels of fares, which apply on most services. A "Real Time Passenger Information" system was introduced at Dublin Bus bus stops in 2012. Electronically displayed signs relay information about the time of the next bus' arrival based on its' GPS determined position.

===Rail===
[[File:LUAS trams at Tallacht terminus. - geograph.org.uk - 1387090.jpg|thumb|[[Luas]] trams at the [[Tallaght]] terminus.]]
[[Dublin Heuston railway station|Heuston]] and [[Dublin Connolly railway station|Connolly stations]] are the two main railway stations in Dublin. Operated by [[Iarnród Éireann]], the [[Dublin Suburban Rail]] network consists of five railway lines serving the [[Greater Dublin Area]] and [[commuter town]]s such as [[Drogheda]] and [[Dundalk]] in [[County Louth]]. One of these lines is the electrified [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) line, which runs primarily along the coast of Dublin, from [[Malahide]] and [[Howth]] southwards as far as [[Greystones]] in [[County Wicklow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublin.ie/transport/dart.htm|title=DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit)|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> [[Commuter (Irish Rail)|Commuter rail]] operates on the other four lines using Irish Rail [[diesel multiple unit]]s.

The [[Luas]] is a [[light rail]] system, run by [[Veolia Transport]], has been operating since 2004. The network consists of two lines; the [[Red Line (Luas)|Red Line]] links the [[Dublin Docklands|Docklands]] and city centre with the south-western suburbs, while the [[Green Line (Luas)|Green Line]] connects the city centre with suburbs to the south of the city and together comprise a total 54 stations and {{convert|38.2|km|mi}} of track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luas.ie/faqs.html|title=Luas&nbsp;– Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref> Construction of an extension to the Green Line, bringing it to the north of the city, commenced in June 2013.<ref>{{cite web |title=Luas Cross City |work=Projects & Investment |publisher=[[Irish Rail]] |date=August 2013 |url=http://www.irishrail.ie/index.jsp?p=124&n=293 |accessdate=2013-08-02 }}</ref>

Proposed multi-million euro projects such as the [[Dublin Metro]] and the [[DART Underground]] will also be considered in light of the current difficult economic climate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0702/breaking4.html|title=Metro decision due in September|publisher=Irish Times|accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>

===Airport===

It is the headquarters of Ireland's flag carrier [[Aer Lingus]], low-cost carrier [[Ryanair]] and regional airlines [[Aer Arann]] and [[CityJet]]. The airport offers an extensive [[flight length|short and medium haul]] network, as well as domestic services to many regional airports in Ireland. There are also extensive Long Haul services to the United States, Canada and the Middle East. Dublin Airport is the busiest airport in Ireland, followed by [[Cork Airport|Cork]] and [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]]. Construction of a second terminal began in 2007 and was officially opened on 19 November 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/1021/daa-business.html |title=Opening date for Terminal 2 set|publisher=RTÉ |date=21 October 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>

Dublin Airport currently ranks as the 25th busiest airport in Europe recording nearly 19 million passengers during 2011.

===Cycling===
Dublin City Council began installing cycle lanes and tracks throughout the city in the 1990s, and {{as of|2012|lc=y}} the city has over {{convert|200|km|miles}} of specific on- and off-road tracks for cyclists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincitycycling.ie/category/cycling-maps |title=Cycling Maps|publisher=Dublincitycycling.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-09-13}}</ref> In 2011, the city was ranked 9th of major world cities on the ''Copenhagenize Index of Bicycle-Friendly Cities''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://copenhagenize.eu/index/index.html |title=Copenhagenize Consulting – '&#39;Copenhagenize Index of Bicycle-Friendly Cities 2011'&#39; |publisher=Copenhagenize.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-13}}</ref>

[[Dublinbikes]] is a [[Bicycle sharing system|self-service bicycle rental scheme]] which has been in operation in Dublin since 2009. Sponsored by [[JCDecaux]], the scheme consists of 550 French-made [[unisex]] bicycles stationed at 44 terminals throughout the city centre. Users must make a subscription for either an annual Long Term Hire Card costing €10 or a 3 Day Ticket costing €2. The first 30 minutes of use is free, but after that a service charge depending on the extra length of use applies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublinbikes.ie/How-does-it-work|title=Dublinbikes&nbsp;– How does it work?|publisher=Dublinbikes|accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref> Dublinbikes now has over 58,000 subscribers and there are plans to dramatically expand the service across the city and its suburbs to provide for up to 5,000 bicycles and approximately 300 terminals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dublinobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Dublin-Bikes-Strategic-Planning-Framework-Document-Full.pdf|title=Dublinbikes Strategic Planning Framework 2011–2016|publisher=Dublin City Council|accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>

The 2011 Census revealed that 5.9 percent of commuters in Dublin cycled. A 2012 report by Dublin City Council on traffic flows crossing the canals in and out of the city found that just over 8% of all traffic was made up of cyclists, representing an increase of 17.5% on 2011 and a 70% increase on 2002 levels.{{cn|date=November 2013}}

==Education==
[[File:Trinity College.jpg|thumb|[[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]]]]
Dublin is the primary centre of education in Ireland, with three universities and many other higher education institutions. There are 20 third-level institutes in the city and in surrounding towns and suburbs.

Its sole constituent college, [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], was established by [[Royal Charter]] in 1592 under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and was closed to Roman Catholics until [[Catholic Emancipation]]. The [[Catholic Church hierarchy|Catholic hierarchy]] then banned Roman Catholics from attending it until 1970. It is situated in the city centre, on [[College Green]], and has 15,000 students.

The [[National University of Ireland]] (NUI) has its seat in Dublin, which is also the location of the associated ''constituent university'' of [[University College Dublin]] (UCD), the largest university in Ireland with over 22,000 students. UCD's main campus at Belfield is located about {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} south east of the city centre. The [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] (RCSI) is a [[medical school]] which is a recognised college of the NUI, it is situated at [[St. Stephen's Green]] in the city centre.

==Demographics==
The City of Dublin is the area administered by [[Dublin City Council]], but the term "Dublin" normally refers to the contiguous urban area which includes parts of the adjacent local authority areas of [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown]], [[Fingal]] and [[South Dublin]]. Together, the four areas form the traditional [[County Dublin]]. This area is sometimes known as the [[Dublin Region]].

===The arts===
Dublin has a world famous literary history, having produced many prominent literary figures, including [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureates]] [[William Butler Yeats]], [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Samuel Beckett]]. Other influential writers and playwrights include [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Jonathan Swift]] and the creator of [[Dracula]], [[Bram Stoker]]. It is arguably most famous as the location of the greatest works of [[James Joyce]], including ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', which is set in Dublin and full of topical detail. ''[[Dubliners]]'' is a collection of short stories by Joyce about incidents and typical characters of the city during the early 20th century. Other renowned writers include [[J. M. Synge]], [[Seán O'Casey]], [[Brendan Behan]], [[Maeve Binchy]], and [[Roddy Doyle]]. Ireland's biggest libraries and literary museums are found in Dublin, including the [[National Print Museum of Ireland]] and [[National Library of Ireland]]. In July 2010, Dublin was named as a UNESCO [[City of Literature]], joining [[Edinburgh]], Melbourne and [[Iowa City]] with the permanent title.<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/delight-at-city-of-literature-accolade-for-dublin-2272904.html ''Irish Independent''&nbsp;– Delight at City of Literature accolade for Dublin]. Retrieved 26 July 2010.</ref>
[[File:KellsFol032vChristEnthroned.jpg|thumb|left|[[Book of Kells]]]]
There are several theatres within the city centre, and various world famous actors have emerged from the Dublin theatrical scene, including [[Noel Purcell (actor)|Noel Purcell]], [[Michael Gambon|Sir Michael Gambon]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], [[Stephen Rea]], [[Colin Farrell]], [[Colm Meaney]] and [[Gabriel Byrne]]. The best known theatres include the [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin|Gaiety]], [[Abbey Theatre|Abbey]], [[Olympia Theatre (Dublin)|Olympia]], [[Gate Theatre|Gate]], and [[Grand Canal Theatre|Grand Canal]]. The Gaiety specialises in musical and operatic productions, and is popular for opening its doors after the evening theatre production to host a variety of live music, dancing, and films. The Abbey was founded in 1904 by a group that included [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]] with the aim of promoting indigenous literary talent. It went on to provide a breakthrough for some of the city's most famous writers, such as [[J. M. Synge|Synge]], Yeats himself and George Bernard Shaw. The Gate was founded in 1928 to promote European and American Avant Garde works. The Grand Canal Theatre is a new 2,111 capacity theatre which opened in March 2010 in the [[Grand Canal Dock]].

Apart from being the focus of the country's literature and theatre, Dublin is also the focal point for much of [[Irish art|Irish Art]] and the Irish artistic scene. The [[Book of Kells]], a world-famous manuscript produced by Celtic Monks in AD 800 and an example of [[Insular art]], is on display in [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]]. The [[Chester Beatty Library]] houses the famous collection of manuscripts, miniature paintings, prints, drawings, rare books and [[decorative art]]s assembled by American mining millionaire (and honorary Irish citizen) [[Sir Alfred Chester Beatty]] (1875–1968). The collections date from 2700 BC onwards and are drawn from Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. Work by local artists is often put on public display around [[St. Stephen's Green]], the main public park in the city centre. In addition large [[Art gallery|art galleries]] are found across the city, including the [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]], the [[National Gallery of Ireland|National Gallery]], the [[Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery]], [[City Arts Centre|The City Arts Centre]], [[Douglas Hyde Gallery|The Douglas Hyde Gallery]], [[Project Arts Centre|The Project Arts Centre]] and [[Royal Hibernian Academy|The Royal Hibernian Academy]]. Three branches of the [[National Museum of Ireland]] are located in Dublin: Archaeology in [[Kildare Street]], Decorative Arts and History in Collins Barracks and Natural History in [[Merrion Street]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.ie/en/homepage.aspx |title=National Museum of Ireland |publisher=Museum.ie |date=8 June 2010 |accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> The same area is also home to many smaller museums such as Number 29 on Fitzwilliam St. and [[The Little Museum of Dublin]] on St. Stephen's Green. Dublin is home to the [[National College of Art and Design]], which dates from 1746, and [[Dublin Institute of Design]], founded in 1991.

Dublin has long been a city with a strong underground arts scene. Temple Bar was the home of many artists in the 1980s, and spaces such as the Project Arts Centre were hubs for collectives and new exhibitions. ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that Dublin's independent and underground arts flourished during the economic recession of 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2010/nov/22/dublin-arts-scene-recession | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Richard | last=Conway | title=Dublin's independent arts scene is a silver lining in the recession-hit city | date=22 November 2010}}</ref> Dublin also has many acclaimed dramatic, musical and operatic companies, including Festival Productions, Lyric Opera Productions, The Pioneers Musical & Dramatic Society, The Glasnevin Musical Society, Second Age Theatre Company, Opera Theatre Company, and Opera Ireland. Ireland is well known for its love of baroque music, which is highly acclaimed at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tcdlocalportal.tcd.ie/pls/public/staff.detail?p_unit=music&p_name=johnstoa |title=Baroque Music in Dublin, Ireland}}</ref>

Perhaps the most famous Dublin theatre company is the renowned Rathmines and Rathgar Musical Society, which has been in existence since 1913. It produced full scale productions of popular musicals and operettas including ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[Carousel]]'', ''[[The Mikado]]'', ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', ''[[Me and My Girl]]'', ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', ''[[The Yeoman of the Guard]]'', ''[[Gigi]]'', ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', ''[[Anything Goes]]'', ''[[The Merry Widow]]'', ''[[Iolanthe]]'', ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' and ''[[HMS Pinafore]]''. At present, the society is performing a tribute concert to the works of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] at the [[National Concert Hall]]. The society recreated their 1913 production of ''[[The Mikado]]'' in November 2010 at the [[National Concert Hall]].
