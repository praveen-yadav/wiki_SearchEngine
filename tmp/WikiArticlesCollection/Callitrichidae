The '''Callitrichidae''' (also called '''Arctopitheci''' or '''Hapalidae''') is a [[family (biology)|family]] of [[New World monkeys]], including [[marmoset]]s and [[tamarin]]s. At times this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily, called Callitrichinae, of the family [[Cebidae]].

This taxon was traditionally thought to be a primitive lineage, from which all the larger bodied platyrrhines evolved.<ref>Hershkovitz, P. Living New World Monkeys (Platyrrhini) with an Introduction to the Primates. University of Chicago 1977.</ref> However, some works argue that callitrichids are actually a dwarfed lineage.<ref name="Ford1980">{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=S. M.|title=Callitrichids as phyletic dwarfs, and the place of the Callitrichidae in Platyrrhini|journal= Primates|volume= 21|issue=1|date= 1980-01-01| pages=31–43| issn= 0032-8332| doi=10.1007/BF02383822}}</ref><ref name = "Naish2012">Naish, Darren.

Ancestral [[stem group|stem-]]callitrichids would likely have been a "normal" sized [[Ceboidea|ceboids]] that was dwarfed through evolutionary time. This may exemplify a rare example of insular dwarfing in a mainland context, with the "islands" being formed by biogeographic barriers during arid climatic periods when forest distribution became patchy, and/or by the extensive river networks in the [[Amazon Basin]].<ref name="Ford1980"/>

All callitrichids are [[arboreal]]. They are the smallest of the [[simian]] [[primate]]s.  They eat insects, fruit, and the sap or gum from trees; occasionally they will take small vertebrates. The marmosets rely quite heavily on [[exudate]]s, with some species (e.g. ''[[Callithrix jacchus]]'' and ''[[Cebuella pygmaea]]'') considered [[obligate]] exudativores.<ref name="HarrisonTardif1994">{{Cite doi|10.1002/ajpa.1330950404}}</ref>

Callitrichids typically live in small, [[territory (animal)|territorial]] groups of about 5 or 6 animals.  Their [[Social organisation|social organization]] is unique among primates and is called a "cooperative polyandrous group".  This communal breeding system involves groups of multiple males and females, but only one female is reproductively active.  Females mate with more than one male and everyone shares the responsibility of carrying the offspring.<ref name="Sussman1">{{cite book | last = Sussman | first = R.W. | title = Primate Ecology and Social Structure | chapter = Chapter 1: Ecology: General Principles | page = 29 | publisher = Pearson Custom Publishing | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-536-74363-3}}</ref>

Studies in captivity, and the first field studies, suggested that the breeding group was invariably a single monogamous pair; subsequent field work on [[Brown-mantled tamarin]]s (''Saguinus fuscicollis''), has shown that many of the groups involve multiple males, and [[polyandry]] seems to be the commonest arrangement, though monogamous pairs do occur, and so, though rarely, does [[polygyny]]. In polyandrous groups, both (or all) the mature males regularly copulate with the female, and all contribute equally to parental care. It is now thought that this flexible system, with a tendency towards polyandry, may be the typical mating system among callitrichids, though until field studies on more species have been completed any generalisation must be tentative.<ref name="1988Goldizen">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0169-5347(88)90045-6 | last1 = Goldizen | first1 = A.W. | title = tamarin and marmoset mating systems: Unusual flexibility | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution | year = 1988 | volume = 3 | pages = 36–40 | issue = 2 | pmid = 21227069}}</ref>

They are the only primate group that regularly produce twins, which constitute over 80% of births in species that have been studied. Unlike other male primates, male callitrichids generally provide as much parental care as females. Parental duties may include carrying, protecting, feeding, comforting, and even engaging in play behavior with offspring. In some cases, such as in the [[cotton-top tamarin#Cooperation|cotton-top tamarin]] (''Saguinus oedipus''), males, particularly those that are paternal, will even show a greater involvement in caregiving than females.<ref name="CB2">Cleveland and Snowdon. Social development during the first twenty weeks in the cotton-top tamarin ('' Saguinus o. oedipus''). [[Animal Behaviour]] (1984) vol. 32 (2) pp. 432-444</ref> Typical social structure seems to constitute a breeding group, with several of their previous offspring living in the group and providing significant help in rearing the young.
