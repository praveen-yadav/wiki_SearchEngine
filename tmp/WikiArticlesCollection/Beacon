{{Other uses|Beacon (disambiguation)}}

A '''beacon''' is an intentionally conspicuous device designed to attract attention to a [[Geodetic datum|specific location]].

Beacons can also be combined with semaphoric or other indicators to provide important [[information]], such as the status of an airport, by the colour and rotational pattern of its [[aerodrome beacon|airport beacon]], or of pending weather as indicated on a [[weather beacon]] mounted at the top of a tall building or similar site. When used in such fashion, beacons can be considered a form of [[Telegraph#Optical_telegraph|optical telegraphy]].

==For navigation==

Beacons help guide [[navigation|navigators]] to their destinations. Types of navigational beacons include [[radar]] reflectors, [[radio beacons]], sonic and visual signals. Visual beacons range from small, single-pile structures to large [[lighthouse]]s or light stations and can be located on land or on water. Lighted beacons are called ''lights''; unlighted beacons are called ''daybeacon''s.

==For defensive communications==

Classically, beacons were fires lit at well-known locations on hills or high places, used either as [[lighthouse]]s for [[navigational aid|navigation at sea]], or for signalling over land that enemy troops were approaching, in order to alert defenses. As signals, beacons are an ancient form of [[optical telegraph]]y, and were part of a [[relay league]].

Systems of this kind have existed for centuries over much of the world. In [[Scandinavia]] many [[hill forts]] were part of beacon networks to warn against invading pillagers. In [[Wales]], the [[Brecon Beacons]] were named for beacons used to warn of approaching [[England|English]] raiders. In England, the most famous examples are the beacons used in [[Elizabethan England]] to warn of the approaching [[Spanish Armada]]. Many hills in [[England]] were named [[Beacon Hill]] after such beacons. In the [[Scottish borders]] country, a system of beacon fires was at one time established to warn of incursions by the English. [[Hume Castle|Hume]] and Eggerstone castles and Soltra Edge were part of this network.<ref>Ritchie, Leitch (1835). ''Scott and Scotland''. London : Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, and Longman, p. 53</ref> The Great Wall of China is also a beacon network. In Finland these beacons were called ''vainovalkeat'', "persecution fires", or ''vartiotulet'', "guard fires."

==On vehicles==

Vehicular beacons are rotating or flashing lights affixed to the top of a vehicle to attract the attention of surrounding vehicles and pedestrians. Emergency vehicles such as fire engines, ambulances, police cars, tow trucks, construction vehicles, and snow-removal vehicles carry beacon lights.  

The color of the lamps varies by jurisdiction; typical colors are blue and/or red for police, fire, and medical-emergency vehicles; amber for tow trucks, security personnel, and construction vehicles; green for volunteer firefighters, and violet for funerary vehicles. Beacons may be constructed with [[Automotive lamp types|halogen bulbs]] similar to those used in vehicle [[headlamp]]s, xenon [[flashtube]]s, or [[Light emitting diode|LED]]s.<ref>

The low power consumption of LEDs allows the vehicle's engine to remain turned off while the lights operate nodes.

==Other uses==
Beacons and [[bonfire]]s are also used to mark occasions and celebrate events. In [[Israel]] beacons identify the beginning of the month.

Beacons have also allegedly been abused by [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|shipwreckers]]. An illicit fire at a wrong position would be used to direct a ship against [[shoal]]s or [[beach]]es, so that its cargo could be looted after the ship sank or ran aground. There are, however, no historically substantiated occurrences of such intentional shipwrecking.

In wireless networks, a [[Electric_beacon#IEEE_802.11_Wi-Fi_beacons|beacon]] is a type of frame which is sent by the access point (or wifi router), to indicate that is on.

''Beaconing'' is the process that allows a network to self-repair network problems. The stations on the network notify the other stations on the ring when they are not receiving the transmissions. Beaconing is used in Token ring and FDDI networks.

In the fiction book [[The Lord of the Rings]], a series of beacons connects Gondor to Rohan. When they are lit, it is a way for one to call for military aid from the other, as per its historical use in medieval Europe.
