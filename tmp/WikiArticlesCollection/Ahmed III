== Biography ==
[[File:Ahmed III by John Young.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Portrait of Ahmed III by John Young]]
Ahmed III cultivated good relations with France, doubtless in view of [[Imperial Russia|Russia]]'s menacing attitude - in fact, both his wives were Frenchwomen. He afforded refuge in Ottoman territory to [[Charles XII of Sweden]] (1682–1718) after the Swedish defeat at the hands of [[Peter I of Russia]] (1672–1725) in the [[Battle of Poltava]] of 1709. In 1710 Charles XII convinced Sultan Ahmed III to declare war against Russia, and the Ottoman forces under [[Baltacı Mehmet Pasha]] won a major victory at the [[Russo-Turkish War (1710–1711)|Battle of Prut]]. In the aftermath, Russia returned [[Azov]] back to the Ottomans, agreed to demolish the fortress of [[Taganrog]] and others in the area, and to stop interfering in the affairs of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

[[File:Levni 002.jpeg|thumb|right|Miniature of Ahmed III.]]

Forced against his will into [[Russo-Turkish War, 1710-1711|war with Russia]], Ahmed III came nearer than any Ottoman [[sovereign]] before or since to breaking the power of his northern rival, whose armies his [[grand vizier]] [[Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha]] succeeded in completely surrounding at the [[Pruth River Campaign]] in 1711. The subsequent Ottoman victories against Russia enabled the Ottoman Empire to advance to Moscow, had the Sultan wished. However, this was halted as a report reached [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]<ref>''The Encyclopædia Britannica'', Vol.7, Edited by Hugh Chisholm, (1911), 3; ''Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish Empire...''</ref><ref>[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368294/Istanbul Britannica, Istanbul]:''When the Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923, the capital was moved to Ankara, and Constantinople was officially renamed Istanbul in 1930.''</ref> that the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] were invading the Ottoman Empire, causing a period of panic, turning the Sultan's attention away from Russia. 

Sultan Ahmed III had become unpopular by reason of the excessive pomp and costly luxury in which he and his principal officers indulged; on September 20, 1730, a mutinous riot of seventeen [[Janissary|janissaries]], led by the [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[Patrona Halil]], was aided by the citizens as well as the military until it swelled into an insurrection in front of which the Sultan was forced to give up the throne.

Ahmed voluntarily led his nephew [[Mahmud I]] (1730–54) to the seat of sovereignty and paid allegiance to him as Sultan of the Empire. He then retired to the [[Kafes]] previously occupied by Mahmud and died at [[Topkapı Palace]] after six years of confinement.

The reign of Ahmed III, which had lasted for twenty-seven years, although marked by the disasters of the [[Great Turkish War]], was not unsuccessful. The recovery of [[Azov]] and the [[Morea]], and the conquest of part of [[Persia]], managed to counterbalance the [[Balkans|Balkan]] territory ceded to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] through the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]], after the Ottoman Empire was defeated in [[Austro-Turkish War of 1716-18]]. In 1716, he sent an army of 33,000 men to capture [[Corfu]] from the [[Republic of Venice]].

Ahmed III left the finances of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in a flourishing condition, which had remarkably been obtained without excessive [[taxation]] or extortion procedures. He was a cultivated [[Patronage|patron]] of literature and art, and it was in his time that the first [[printing press]] authorized to use the Arabic or Turkish languages was set up in Constantinople, operated by [[Ibrahim Muteferrika]] (while the printing press had been introduced to Constantinople in 1480, all works published before 1729 were in Greek, Armenian, or Hebrew).

It was in this reign that an important change in the government of the [[Danubian Principalities]] was introduced: previously, the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] had appointed [[Hospodar]]s, usually native [[Moldavia]]n and [[Wallachia]]n [[boyar]]s, to administer those provinces; after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1710-1711|Russian campaign]] of 1711, during which [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] found an ally in [[Moldavia]] [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], the Porte began overtly deputizing [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] [[Greeks]] in that region, and extended the system to [[Wallachia]] after [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Stefan Cantacuzino]] established links with [[Prince Eugene of Savoy|Eugene of Savoy]]. The Phanariotes constituted a kind of ''[[Dhimmi]]'' nobility, which supplied the Porte with functionaries in many important departments of the state.

==Relations with the Mughal Empire==
===Jahandar Shah===

In the year 1712, the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Jahandar Shah]], a grandson of [[Aurangzeb]] sent gifts to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Ahmad III]] and referred to himself as the Ottoman Sultan's devoted admirer.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=uB1uAAAAMAAJ&q=Farrukhsiyar&source=gbs_word_cloud_r&cad=6</ref>

===Farrukhsiyar===

The [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Farrukhsiyar]] a grandson of [[Aurangzeb]], is also known to have sent a letter to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] but this time it was received by the [[Grand Vizier]] [[Nevşehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha]] providing a graphic description of the efforts of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] commander [[Sayyid Brothers|Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha]] against the [[Rajput]] and [[Maratha]] rebellion.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uB1uAAAAMAAJ&q=Farrukhsiyar&source=gbs_word_cloud_r&cad=6 |title=Mughal-Ottoman relations: a study of political & diplomatic relations ... - Naimur Rahman Farooqi |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref>

== Marriages and issue ==
He married [[Mihrimah Sultan|Aminā (Emine) Mihr-î-Mâh Sultan]] (wrong link), and [[Rabia Sharmi|Râbi'a Sermi Sultan]]. By the first wife he had [[Mustafa III]] and by the second wife he had [[Abdul Hamid I]].

==In fiction==
[[File:Ahmet III 1720.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Sultan Ahmed III]]
[[File:Jean-Baptiste van Mour 010.jpg|thumb|The Harem with the Sultan Ahmed III]]
A passage in [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]'' has the book's eponymous main character meet the deposed Ahmed III while on a ship from [[Venice]] to [[Constantinople]]. The Sultan is in the company of five other deposed European monarchs, and he tells Candide, who initially doubts his credentials:

<blockquote>I am not jesting, my name is Achmet III. For 
several years I was Sultan; I dethroned my brother; 
my nephew dethroned me; they cut off the heads of 
my viziers; I am ending my days in the old seraglio; 
my nephew, Sultan Mahmoud, sometimes allows me 
to travel for my health, and I have come to spend the 
Carnival at Venice" ([http://www.archive.org/stream/candideotherroma00voltuoft/candideotherroma00voltuoft_djvu.txt]).</blockquote>

This episode was taken up by the modern Turkish writer [[Nedim Gürsel]] and made into the setting of his 2001 novel ''Le voyage de Candide à Istanbul''.

In fact, there is no evidence of the deposed Sultan being allowed to make such foreign travels, nor did Voltaire (or Gürsel) assert that it had any actual historical foundation.
