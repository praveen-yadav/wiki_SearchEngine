An '''aircraft carrier''' is a [[warship]] with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying and recovering aircraft, acting as a seagoing airbase.<ref>dictionary.com [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/aircraft%20carrier Aircraft carrier]</ref> It is typically the [[capital ship]] of a fleet, as it allows a [[navy|naval force]] to project [[airpower]] worldwide without having to depend on local bases for staging aircraft operations, and is extremely expensive to build and important to protect. They have evolved from converted cruisers to nuclear-powered warships that can carry many fighters, strike aircraft, helicopters and other types. There is no single definition of an "aircraft carrier".<ref name="gscarrier">GlobalSecurity.org [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/carriers.htm World Wide Aircraft Carriers]</ref> Within modern navies, many variants are in use.

Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early 20th century, from wooden vessels used to deploy [[balloon]]s to [[Nuclear propulsion|nuclear-powered]] warships that carry dozens of aircraft, including fighter jets and helicopters. There are 36 aircraft carriers of all types in use world-wide with 12 navies. <!-- Of the nine nations that possess an aircraft carrier, seven possess only one. Excluding those of the [[United States Navy]], nine other aircraft carriers are active throughout the world {{as of|lc=y|2013|02}}. --> The [[United States Navy]] has 10 large nuclear-powered carriers, known as [[supercarrier]]s, carrying up to 90 aircraft, and they are the largest carriers in the world. As well as the supercarrier fleet, the USN has 9 [[amphibious assault ship]]s used primarily for helicopters; these can also carry up to 20-25 fighter jets and in some cases are as large as some other nations' fixed-wing carriers.

===By role===

A ''[[fleet carrier]]'' is intended to operate with the main fleet and usually provides an offensive capability.  These are the largest carriers capable of fast speeds. By comparison, ''[[escort carrier]]s'' were developed to provide defense for convoys of ships. They were smaller and slower with lower numbers of aircraft carried. Most were built from mercantile hulls or, in the case of [[merchant aircraft carrier]]s, were bulk cargo ships with a flight deck added on top. ''[[Light aircraft carrier]]s'' were carriers that were fast enough to operate with the fleet but of smaller size with reduced aircraft capacity.  Soviet aircraft carriers now in use by Russia are actually called ''heavy aviation cruisers'', these ships while sized in the range of large fleet carriers were designed to deploy alone or with escorts and provide both strong defensive weaponry and heavy offensive missiles equivalent to a guided missile cruiser in addition to supporting fighters and helicopters.

===By configuration===
There are four main configurations of aircraft carrier in service in the world's navies, divided by the way that aircraft take off and land:
* ''Catapult-assisted take-off but arrested-recovery'' (''[[CATOBAR]]''): these carriers generally carry the largest, heaviest, and most heavily armed aircraft, although smaller CATOBAR carriers may have other limitations (weight capacity of aircraft elevator, etc.). Three nations currently operate carriers of this type: ten by the United States, and one each by France and Brazil for a total of twelve in service.
* ''Short take-off but arrested-recovery'' (''[[STOBAR]]''): these carriers are generally limited to carrying lighter fixed-wing aircraft with more limited payloads. STOBAR carrier air wings, such as the [[Sukhoi Su-33]] and future [[Mikoyan MiG-29K]] wings of the [[Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov|''Admiral Kuznetsov'']] are often geared primarily towards air superiority and fleet defense roles rather than strike/power projection tasks,{{cn|date=November 2013}} which require heavier payloads (bombs and air-to-ground missiles). Currently, Russia, China, and India possess commissioned carriers of this type.
* ''Short take-off vertical-landing'' (''[[STOVL]]''): limited to carrying STOVL aircraft. STOVL aircraft, such as the [[Harrier Jump Jet]] family and [[Yakovlev Yak-38]] generally have very limited payloads, lower performance, and high fuel consumption when compared with conventional fixed-wing aircraft; however, a new generation of STOVL aircraft, currently consisting of the [[F-35]]B has much improved performance. This type of aircraft carrier is in service with one for India and two for Italy, Spain also operates one amphibious assault ship as a STOVL aircraft carrier for four ships total in active carrier service; the UK and Thailand each have one active STOVL carrier but both no longer have any operational STOVL aircraft in inventory. Some also count the nine US amphibious assault ships in their secondary light carrier role boosting the overall total to fifteen.
* ''Helicopter Carrier'':  Helicopter carriers have a similar appearance to aircraft carriers with regular fixed wing operations. Some are designed for addition of, or may include, a ski jump ramp allowing for future STOVL operations or may have an unused ski jump installed before retirement of STOVL aircraft and repurposing, in the past conventional carriers were converted and called commando carriers or [[Landing Platform Helicopter|LPH]]s. Currently the majority of helicopter carriers but not all are classified as [[amphibious assault ships]]. [[Republic of Korea Navy|South Korea]] has one of this type, Japan two, the UK two, France three, and Thailand one, and the US nine for a total of eighteen.  The US's LHA and LHD class ships do operate a few STOVL aircraft in normal deployment, the UK's [[Invincible-class aircraft carrier|''Illustrious'']], and the Thai [[HTMS Chakri Naruebet]] were STOVL aircraft carriers.

The [[Wright brothers|1903 advent]] of heavier-than-air, fixed-wing aircraft was closely followed in 1910 by the first experimental take-off of such an airplane from the deck of a [[United States Navy]] vessel (cruiser {{USS|Birmingham|CL-2|6}}), and the first experimental landings were conducted in 1911.

The development of flattop vessels produced the first large fleet ships. In 1918, {{HMS|Argus|I49|6}} became the world's first carrier capable of launching and landing naval aircraft.<ref>Geoffrey Till, "Adopting the Aircraft Carrier: The British, Japanese, and American Case Studies" in {{cite book |title= Military Innovation in the Interwar Period|edition=|editor1-first= Williamson|editor1-last= Murray|editor2-first= Allan R|editor2-last= Millet |year= 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= New York|isbn= 0-521-63760-0|page= 194}}</ref> As a result of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922, which limited the construction of new heavy surface combat ships, most early aircraft carriers were conversions of ships that were laid down (or had served) as different ship types: cargo ships, cruisers, battlecruisers, or battleships. These conversions gave rise to {{sclass-|Lexington|aircraft carrier|2}}s (1927), [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']] and [[Courageous-class aircraft carrier|''Courageous''-class]]. Specialist carrier evolution was well underway, with several navies began ordering and building warships that were purposefully designed to function as aircraft carriers by the mid-1920s, resulting in the commissioning of ships such as [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hōshō|''Hōshō'']] (1922), {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} (1924), and [[French aircraft carrier Béarn|''Béarn'']] (1927). During [[World War II]], these ships would become the backbone of the carrier forces of the United States, British, and Japanese navies, known as [[fleet carrier]]s.

===Prominence in World War II===

The aircraft carrier drastically changed naval combat in [[World War II]].

This was because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare. The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had higher range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}} launched a long-range [[Battle of Taranto|strike on the Italian fleet]] at their base in [[Taranto]], signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of [[HMS Glorious|HMS ''Glorious'']] by German battlecruisers during the [[Norwegian Campaign|Norwegian campaign in 1940]].

[[File:Attack on carrier USS Franklin 19 March 1945.jpg|thumb|left|Attack on carrier {{USS|Franklin|CV-13|6}}, 19 March 1945. The casualties included 724 killed.]]

This newfound importance of naval aviation forced nations to create a number of carriers, in efforts to provide air superiority cover for every major fleet in order to ward off enemy aircraft. This extensive usage required the construction of several new 'light' carriers. [[Escort aircraft carrier]]s, such as {{USS|Bogue|CVE-9|6}}, were sometimes purpose-built, but most were converted from merchant ships as a stop-gap measure to provide anti-submarine air support for convoys and amphibious invasions. Following this concept, [[Light aircraft carrier]]s built by the US, such as {{USS|Independence|CVL-22|6}}, represented a larger, more "militarized" version of the escort carrier. Although with similar complement to Escort carriers, they had the advantage of speed from their converted cruiser hulls.  The UK [[1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier]] was designed for building quickly by civilian shipyards and with an expected service life of about 3 years.<ref>Robbins, Guy ''The Aircraft Carrier Story: 1908–1945''. 2001 London: Cassel p91</ref> They served the Royal Navy during the war and was the hull design chosen for nearly all aircraft carrier equipped navies after the war until the 1980s. Emergencies also spurred the creation or conversion of highly unconventional aircraft carriers. [[CAM ship]]s, were cargo-carrying merchant ships that could launch (but not retrieve) a single fighter aircraft from a catapult to defend the convoy from long range German aircraft.

===Modern era===
[[File:USS Tripoli LPH10 a.jpg|thumb|USS ''Tripoli'', a US Navy ''Iwo Jima''-class helicopter carrier]]

Aircraft carrier designs since World War II have been effectively unlimited by any consideration save budgetary,{{clarify|date=October 2013}} and the ships have increased in size to handle the larger aircraft. Before World War II international naval treaties of [[Washington Naval Treaty|1922]], [[London Naval Treaty|1930]] and [[Second London Naval Treaty|1936]] limited the size of capital ships including carriers.  The large, modern {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|4}} of US carriers has a displacement nearly four times that of the World War II–era {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, yet its complement of aircraft is roughly the same&mdash;a consequence of the steadily increasing size and weight of military aircraft over the years.

Modern navies that operate such ships treat aircraft carriers as the [[capital ship]] of the fleet, a role previously held by the [[battleship]]. While some will call ballistic missile submarines capital ships, this is more in recognition of their overwhelming firepower as a national strategic nuclear deterrent than their role in the fleet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_5/ntlsecurity.html |title=The SSBN in National Security |publisher=Navy.mil |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26}}</ref> The change took place during World War II in response to air power becoming a significant factor in warfare. This change was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. Following the war, carrier operations continued to increase in size and importance. [[Supercarrier]]s, displacing 75,000&nbsp;tonnes or greater, have become the pinnacle of carrier development. Some are powered by [[nuclear reactor]]s and form the core of a fleet designed to operate far from home. Amphibious assault ships, such as {{USS|Tarawa|LHA-1|6}} and {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}}, serve the purpose of carrying and landing Marines, and operate a large contingent of helicopters for that purpose. Also known as "commando carriers"<ref>A number of British conversions of light fleet carriers to helicopter operations were known as commando carriers, though they did not operate landing craft</ref> or "helicopter carriers", many have a secondary capability to operate [[VSTOL]] aircraft.

Today's aircraft carriers are so expensive that nations which operate them risk significant political, economic, and military ramifications if a carrier was lost, or even used in conflict. Lacking the firepower of other warships, carriers by themselves are considered vulnerable to attack by other ships, aircraft, submarines, or missiles. Therefore, aircraft carriers are generally accompanied by a number of other ships to provide protection for the relatively unwieldy carrier, to carry supplies, and to provide additional offensive capabilities. This is often termed a battle group or carrier group, sometimes a [[carrier battle group]].

Observers{{vague|date=October 2013}} have opined that modern anti-ship weapons systems, such as torpedoes and missiles, have made aircraft carriers obsolete as too vulnerable for modern combat.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Nuclear weapons would threaten whole naval carrier groups in open generalised combat.  On the other hand, the proven or threatening role of aircraft carriers has an undeniably modern place in [[asymmetric warfare]], like the [[gunboat diplomacy]] of the past.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Furthermore, aircraft carriers facilitate quick and precise projections of overwhelming military power into such local and regional conflicts.<ref>Lekic, Slobodan, Associated Press.

==Structure==
[[File:USS Roosevelt CV-42 Med 1976-77.jpg|thumb|right|STOVL Harriers preparing to takeoff from CATOBAR carrier, {{USS|Franklin D. Roosevelt|CV-42}}]]

Carriers are large and long ships, although there is a high degree of variation depending on their intended role and [[air wing|aircraft complement]]. The size of the carrier has varied over history and among [[navy|navies]], to cater for the various roles that global climates have demanded from [[naval aviation]].

Regardless of size, the ship itself must house their complement of aircraft, with space for launching, storing, and maintaining them. Space is also required for the large crew, supplies (food, munitions, fuel, engineering parts), and propulsion. US supercarriers are notable for having [[nuclear reactors]] powering their systems and propulsion. This makes the carrier reasonably tall.

The top of the carrier is the flight deck, where aircraft are launched and recovered. On the starboard side of this is the island, where air-traffic control and the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] are located. The flight deck is where the most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway are found. Creating such a surface at sea poses constraints on the carrier&nbsp;– for example, the fact that it is a ship means that a full-length runway would be costly to construct and maintain. This affects take-off procedure, as a shorter runway length of the deck requires that aircraft [[accelerate]] more quickly to gain lift. This either requires a thrust boost, a vertical component to its velocity, or a reduced take-off load (to lower mass). These result in two main philosophies in order to keep the deck short: Catapult Assisted Take-Off (CATO-), and Vertical and/or Short Take-Off (V/STO-). Each method has advantages and disadvantages of its own. A catapult accelerates the plane by connecting it to a pressurised piston, and allows for even heavily-loaded aircraft to take off. Short take-off usually means either the use of a ski-jump and/or a reduced take-off load/capacity than normal to reduce the aircraft's mass. Vertical take-off or VTOL aircraft are specifically designed for that purpose, but are usually slower than conventionally-propelled aircraft.

On the recovery side of operations on the flight deck, this is mirrored: if the carrier deploys jets without VTOL capability, it will almost always have arrested-recovery systems (-BAR) to stop the plane, and an angled flight deck. If the aircraft are VTOL-capable or helicopters, they do not need to decelerate and hence there is no such need. The arrested-recovery system has used an angled deck since the 1950s because in the case that the aircraft cannot catch the arresting wire, the short deck makes it easier to take off, by reducing the amount of collidable objects between the aircraft and the end of the runway.  It also has the advantage of separating the recovery operation area from the launch area.

These constraints of affect the role of a given carrier strongly, as they influence the weight, type, and configuration of the aircraft that may be launched. For example, assisted launch mechanisms are used primarily for heavy aircraft, especially those loaded with air-to-ground weapons. CATOBAR is most commonly used on USN [[supercarriers]] as it allows the deployment of heavy jets with full loadouts, especially on ground-attack missions. STOVL is used by other navies because it is cheaper to operate and still provides good deployment capability for [[fighter aircraft]].

Due to the busy nature of the flight deck, only 20 or so aircraft may be on it at any one time. A hangar storage several decks below the flight deck is where most aircraft are kept, and aircraft are taken from the lower storage decks to the flight deck through the use of an elevator. The hangar is usually quite large and can take up several decks of vertical space.<ref>How Aircraft Carriers Work, ''How Stuff Works'', by  Tom Harris - http://science.howstuffworks.com/aircraft-carrier6.htm Accessed 5 Oct 2013</ref>

Munitions are commonly stored on the lower decks because they are highly explosive should the compartment they are in be breached. Usually this is below the water line so that the area can be flooded in case of emergency.

==Flight deck==
{{Main|Flight deck}}
[[File:DeHavilland Vampire HMS Ocean Dec1945 NAN1 47.jpg|thumb|The first carrier landing and take-off of a jet aircraft: [[Eric "Winkle" Brown]] landing on {{HMS|Ocean|R68}} in 1945.]]

As "runways at sea", aircraft carriers have a flat-top [[flight deck]], the job of which is to [[Takeoff|launch]] and [[landing|recover]] aircraft. Aircraft launch forward, into the wind, and are recovered from astern. The differing types of deck configuration, as above, influence the structure of the flight deck. The form of launch assistance a carrier provides is strongly related to the types of aircraft embarked and the design of the carrier itself.

On [[CATOBAR|Catapult Assisted Take-Off But Arrested Recovery]] (CATOBAR) carriers, a steam-powered [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] is used to accelerate conventional aircraft to a safe flying speed by the end of the catapult stroke, after which the aircraft is airborne and further propulsion is provided by its own engines. On STOVL or [[STOBAR|Short take-off but arrested recovery]] (STOBAR) carriers aircraft do not require catapult assistance for take off; instead on nearly all ships of this type an upwards vector is provided by a ski-jump at the forward end of the flight deck often combined with thrust vectoring by the aircraft; though a STOVL is able to launch without a ski-jump or catapult with reduced fuel and weapon load.

Carriers steam at speed, up to {{nowrap|35 [[knot (unit)|knots]]}} ({{nowrap|65&nbsp;km/h}}) into the wind during flight deck operations to increase wind speed over the deck to a safe minimum. This increase in effective wind speed provides a higher launch airspeed for aircraft at the end of the catapult stroke or ski-jump, as well as making recovery safer by reducing the difference between the relative speeds of the aircraft and ship.

[[File:F-18 - A 3-wire landing.ogv|thumb|F/A-18 landing video]]

When recovering onto an 'Arrested Recovery' (CATO''BAR'' or STO''BAR'') carrier, conventional aircraft rely on a [[tailhook]] that catches on [[arrestor wires]] stretched across the deck to bring them to a stop in a short distance.  Post-WWII Royal Navy research on safer CATOBAR recovery eventually lead to universal adoption of a landing area angled off axis to allow aircraft who missed the arresting wires to "bolt" and safely return to flight for another landing attempt rather than crashing into aircraft on the forward deck.  [[Helicopter]]s and aircraft capable of vertical or short take-off and landing ([[V/STOL]]) usually recover by coming abreast the carrier on the port side and then using their hover capability to move over the flight deck and land vertically without the need for arresting gear.

Since the early 1950s on conventional carriers it has been the practice to recover aircraft at an angle to port of the axial line of the ship. The primary function of this angled deck is to allow aircraft that miss the arresting wires, referred to as a [[Bolter (aviation)|bolter]], to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked forward. The angled deck allows the installation of one or two "waist" catapults in addition to the two bow cats. An angled deck also improves [[launch and recovery cycle]] flexibility with the option of simultaneous launching and recovery of aircraft.
 
===Staff===

Conventional ("tailhook") aircraft rely upon a [[landing signal officer]] (LSO, sometimes called ''paddles'') to monitor the aircraft's approach, visually gauge glideslope, attitude, and airspeed, and transmit that data to the pilot. Before the angled deck emerged in the 1950s, LSOs used colored paddles to signal corrections to the pilot (hence the nickname). From the late 1950s onward, visual landing aids such as [[Optical Landing System|optical landing system]] have provided information on proper [[glide slope]], but LSOs still transmit voice calls to approaching pilots by radio.

Key personnel involved in the flight deck include the shooters, the handler, and the air boss. Shooters are [[naval aviator]]s or [[Naval Flight Officer]]s and are responsible for launching aircraft. The handler works just inside the island from the flight deck and is responsible for the movement of aircraft before launching and after recovery. The "air boss" (usually a [[commander]]) occupies the top bridge (Primary Flight Control, also called ''primary'' or ''the tower'') and has the overall responsibility for controlling launch, recovery and "those aircraft in the air near the ship, and the movement of planes on the flight deck, which itself resembles a well-choreographed ballet."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/powerhouse/powerhouse.asp |title= The US Navy Aircraft Carriers |publisher=Navy.mil |accessdate=30 January 2009 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090221142917/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/powerhouse/powerhouse.asp |archivedate= 21 February 2009 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl= no}}</ref> The captain of the ship spends most of his time one level below primary on the Navigation Bridge. Below this is the Flag Bridge, designated for the embarked admiral and his staff.

To facilitate working on the flight deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier, the sailors wear colored shirts that designate their responsibilities. There are at least seven different colors worn by flight deck personnel for [[modern United States Navy carrier air operations]]. Carrier operations of other nations use similar color schemes.

===Deck structures===
[[File:DN-SD-07-00030.jpg|thumb|Ripples appear along the fuselage of a U.S. Navy [[E-2C Hawkeye]] due to loads from landing on the {{USS|Harry S. Truman|CVN-75}}.]]

The superstructure of a carrier (such as the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]], flight [[control tower]]) are concentrated to the [[starboard]] side of the deck in a relatively small area called an ''island'', a feature pioneered on the {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} in 1923. Very few carriers have been designed or built without an island. The ''flush deck'' configuration proved to have very significant drawbacks, complicating navigation, air traffic control, and had numerous other adverse factors.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

A more recent configuration, originally developed by the Royal Navy but since adopted by many navies for most smaller carriers, has a [[ski-jump ramp]] at the forward end of the flight deck. This was first developed to help launch [[STOVL]] aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. A ski-jump works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fuelled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully loaded and fuelled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either [[Stall (flight)|stalling out]] or crashing directly into the sea.
[[File:FRS.1 ski-jump take-off HMS Invincible.JPEG|thumb|left|Ski-jump on Royal Navy carrier {{HMS|Invincible|R05}}]]

Although STOVL aircraft are capable of taking off vertically from a spot on the deck, using the ramp and a running start is far more fuel efficient and permits a heavier launch weight. As catapults are unnecessary, carriers with this arrangement reduce weight, complexity, and space needed for complex steam or electromagnetic launching equipment, vertical landing aircraft also remove the need for arresting cables and related hardware. Russian, Chinese, and future Indian carriers include a ski-jump ramp for launching lightly loaded conventional fighter aircraft but recover using traditional carrier arresting cables and a tailhook on their aircraft.

The disadvantage of the ski-jump is the penalty it exacts on aircraft size, payload, and fuel load (and thus range); heavily laden aircraft can not launch using a ski-jump because their high loaded weight requires either a longer takeoff roll than is possible on a carrier deck, or assistance from a catapult or JATO rocket, for example the Russian Su-33 is only able to launch from the carrier ''Kuznetsov'' with a minimal armament and fuel load.  Another disadvantage is on mixed flight deck operations where helicopters are also present such as a US [[Landing Helicopter Dock]] or [[Landing Helicopter Assault]] amphibious assault ship a ski jump is not included as this would eliminate one or more helicopter landing areas, this flat deck limits the loading of Harriers but is somewhat mitigated by the longer rolling start provided by a long flight deck compared to many STOVL carriers.

The Australian version retains the ski-ramp from the Juan Carlos I, However the RAN has opted against a carrier based fixed-wing capability.

===China===

On 25 September 2012, [[NBCNews.com]] reported that the Chinese government had commissioned their first aircraft carrier, [[Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning|''Liaoning'']].  However, this carrier was not built by the Chinese, but rather laid down for the Soviet Navy in 1988 and partially completed at a Ukrainian shipyard as [[Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier#Hull 2 - Liaoning (ex-Varyag)|''Varyag'']].<ref name="bbc20110608">{{cite news |title= China aircraft carrier confirmed by general |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13692558 |newspaper= [[BBC News]] |date= 8 June 2011 |accessdate=9 June 2011 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110609071512/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13692558 |archivedate= 9 June 2011 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl= no}}</ref> It was later purchased as a stripped [[Hulk (ship)|hulk]] by China in 1998 on the pretext of use as a floating  casino, then partially rebuilt and towed to China for completion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://behindthewall.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/25/14092055-china-brings-its-first-aircraft-carrier-into-service-joining-9-nation-club?chromedomain=worldnews&lite |title=China brings its first aircraft carrier into service, joining 9-nation club - Behind The Wall |publisher=Behindthewall.nbcnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/liaoning.htm|title=Liaoning, ex-Varyag|publisher=Global Security|accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref> On 24 November 2012, China announced that for the first time ''Liaoning'' had successfully launched and recovered several [[Shenyang J-15|J-15]] fighter aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/312811/china-lands-first-jet-on-its-aircraft-carrier |title=China lands first jet on its aircraft carrier &#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2012-11-25 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}</ref>

According to James Nolt, senior fellow at the World Policy Institute in New York, it might take China many years to develop the technology, training, and operational capability necessary for an effective carrier.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2010/china-100921-voa01.htm China Working to Counter US Naval Power in the Pacific]</ref>

===France===

The [[French Navy]] has set in motion possible plans for a [[Future French aircraft carrier|second CTOL aircraft carrier]], to supplement [[French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle (R91)|''Charles de Gaulle'']]. The design would be much larger, at 65,000–75,000 tonnes,<ref>[http://www.defense.gouv.fr/marine/content_english/preparing-the-future/renewing-the-assets/(language)/fre-FR#SearchText=PA2#xtcr=1 Marine Nationale - Renewing the assets]</ref> and would not be nuclear-powered like ''Charles de Gaulle''. There are plans to base the carrier on the current [[Royal Navy CVF programme|Royal Navy design]] for [[CATOBAR]] operations (the [[Thales Group|Thales]]/[[BAE Systems]] design for the Royal Navy is for a STOVL carrier that can be reconfigured to CATOBAR operations.)

On 21 June 2008, French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] placed France's participation in the project on hold. He stated that a final decision on the future of the French carrier would be taken in 2011 or 2012. British plans for two aircraft carriers will proceed and were in no way conditional on French participation.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/engineering/article4183255.ece |title = President Sarkozy ditches Franco-British carrier project |work=The Times |location=UK |date= 21 June 2008 |accessdate=30 January 2009  |first=Adam |last=Sage}}</ref> The project was cancelled as part of the [[2013 French White Paper on Defence and National Security|2013 defence review]].

In December 2009, Navy chief Admiral Nirmal Verma said at his maiden navy week press conference that concepts currently being examined by the Directorate of Naval Design for the second indigenous aircraft carrier, the IAC-2, are for a conventionally powered carrier displacing over 50,000 tons and equipped with steam catapults (rather than the ski-jump on the ''Gorshkov''/''Vikramaditya'' and the IAC) to launch fourth-generation aircraft.<ref name="indiatoday.intoday.in"/> The aim is to have a total of three aircraft carriers in service, with two fully operational carriers and the third in refit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiastrategic.in/topstories2078_Indian_Navy_to_launch_indigenous_aircraft_carrier_Aug_12.htm |title=:: India Strategic ::.

===Russia===

Speaking in [[St. Petersburg, Russia]] on 30 June 2011, the head of Russia's [[United Shipbuilding Corporation]] said his company expected to begin design work for a new carrier in 2016, with a goal of beginning construction in 2018 and having the carrier achieve initial operational capability by 2023.<ref>RIA NOVOSTI, [http://en.rian.ru/mlitary_news/20110630/164924604.html "Russia to build Nuclear Aircraft Carrier by 2023"] 30 June 2011.</ref> Several months later, on 3 November 2011 the Russian newspaper ''[[Izvestiya]]'' reported that the naval building plan now included (first) the construction of a new shipyard capable of building large hull ships, after which Moscow will build two(80 000 tons full load each) nuclear-powered aircraft carriers by 2027. The spokesperson said one carrier would be assigned to the [[Russian Navy|Russian Navy's]] [[Northern Fleet]] at [[Murmansk]], and the second would be stationed with the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet]] at [[Vladivostok]].<ref>BarentsObserver.com, [http://www.barentsobserver.com/russia-to-build-two-aircraft-carriers.4980466-58932.html "Russia to Build Two Aircraft Carriers"] 3 November 2011.</ref>

===South Korea===

The [[Republic of Korea Navy]] believes it can deploy two light aircraft carriers by 2036 and expand its blue-water force to cope with the rapid naval buildups of China and Japan, according to a Navy source.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20131026/DEFREG03/310260005/}}</ref>

===United States===
[[File:USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) on the James River in 2013.JPG|thumb|left|[[USS Gerald R. Ford|USS ''Gerald R. Ford'']], a [[Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier|''Gerald R. Ford''-class aircraft carrier]] ]]

The current US fleet of [[Nimitz-class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz''-class]] carriers will be followed into service (and in some cases replaced) by the [[Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier|''Gerald R. Ford'' class]]. It is expected that the ships will be more automated in an effort to reduce the amount of funding required to maintain and operate its [[supercarrier]]s. The main new features are implementation of [[Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System]] (EMALS) (which replace the old steam catapults) and [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=4200&tid=200&ct=4 |title=Aircraft Carriers - CVN |publisher=US Navy |accessdate=26 October 2013}}</ref>

With the deactivation of the {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}} in December 2012 (decommissioning scheduled for 2013), the U.S. fleet comprises 10 supercarriers. The [[United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces|House Armed Services Seapower subcommittee]] on 24 July 2007, recommended seven or maybe eight new carriers (one every four years). However, the debate has deepened over budgeting for the $12–14.5&nbsp;billion (plus $12&nbsp;billion for development and research) for the 100,000 ton ''Gerald R. Ford''-class carrier (estimated service 2015) compared to the smaller $2&nbsp;billion 45,000 ton [[America-class amphibious assault ship|''America''-class amphibious assault ship]]s able to deploy squadrons of [[F-35B]] of which two are already under construction and twelve are planned.<ref name="AFAmag">{{cite journal |last = Kreisher |first = Otto|title = Seven New Carriers (Maybe) |journal=Air Force  Magazine |volume = 90 |issue = 10 |pages = 68–71 |month = October |year = 2007 |publisher=Air Force Association |url = http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2007/October%202007/1007carriers.aspx |accessdate =2 October 2007 |issn = 0730-6784 }}</ref>
