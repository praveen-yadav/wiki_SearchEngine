A '''building society''' is a [[financial institution]] owned by its members as a [[mutual organization]]. Building societies offer [[banking institution|banking]] and related [[financial services]], especially [[mortgage loan|mortgage lending]]. These institutions are found in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) and several other countries.

The term "''building society''" first arose in the 18th century in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] from [[cooperative banking|cooperative savings]] groups. In the UK today, building societies actively compete with [[bank]]s for most consumer banking services, especially mortgage lending and [[savings account]]s.

Every building society in the UK is a member of the [[Building Societies Association]]. At the start of 2008, there were 59 building societies in the UK, with total assets exceeding £360 billion.<ref name=multiple>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsa.org.uk |title=Building Societies Association |publisher=Bsa.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-06}}</ref> The number of societies in the UK fell by four during 2008 due to a series of mergers brought about, to a large extent, by the consequences of the [[financial crisis of 2007-2010]]. With three further mergers in each of 2009 and 2010, and a demutualisation and a merger in 2011, the current number of building societies is at 45.

==History==
The origins of the building society as an institution lie in late-18th century [[Birmingham]] – a town which was undergoing rapid economic and physical expansion driven by a multiplicity of small metalworking firms, whose many highly skilled and prosperous owners readily invested in property.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ashworth|first=Herbert|title=The Building Society Story|year=1980|publisher=Franey & Co.|location=London|isbn=0-900382-38-4|page=4}}; {{Cite book|last=Berg|first=Maxine|editor=Berg, Maxine|title=Markets and Manufacture in Early Industrial Europe|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NfkNAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=2010-09-07|year=1991|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-03720-4|page=194|chapter=Commerce and Creativity in Eighteenth-Century Birmingham|chapterurl=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NfkNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA173}}</ref> Many of the early building societies were based in [[tavern]]s or [[coffeehouse]]s, which had become the focus for a network of clubs and societies for co-operation and the exchange of ideas among Birmingham's highly active citizenry as part of the movement known as the [[Midlands Enlightenment]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Peter M.|title=Industrial Enlightenment: Science, technology and culture in Birmingham and the West Midlands, 1760-1820|year=2009|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0-7190-7770-2|page=65}}; {{Cite news|first=Carl|last=Chinn|title=Brum's building society origins|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Brum's+building+society+origins-a0188546654857|work=Strabane Mail|publisher=Birmingham Post and Mail Ltd.|date=2008-11-15|accessdate=1905-09-06}}</ref> The first building society to be established was [[Ketley's Building Society]], founded by Richard Ketley, the landlord of the ''Golden Cross'' inn, in 1775.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsa.org.uk/consumer/factsheets/100009.htm|title=The History of Building Societies|accessdate=2010-09-06|last=Rex|first=Simon|date=2010-04-20|publisher=Building Societies Association}}; {{Cite book|last=Ashworth|first=Herbert|title=The Building Society Story|year=1980|publisher=Franey & Co.|location=London|isbn=0-900382-38-4|page=2}}</ref> Members of Ketley's society paid a monthly subscription to a central pool of funds which was used to finance the building of houses for members, which in turn acted as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] to attract further funding to the society, enabling further construction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Christopher L.|year=1991|publisher=|month=October|title=Truth, Understanding, and High-Cost Consumer Credit: The Historical Context of the Truth in Lending Act|journal=Florida Law Review|issue=55|pages=839–840|url=|accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref> By 1781 three more societies had been established in Birmingham, with a fourth in the nearby town of [[Dudley]]; and 19 more formed in Birmingham between 1782 and 1795.<ref>{{Citation|last=Clark|first=Peter|year=2002|title=British Clubs and Societies 1580-1800: The Origins of an Associational World|publication-place=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=129|isbn=0-19-924843-5|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h18rP1hrNLQC&pg=PA129|accessdate=2010-11-20}}</ref> The first outside the [[English Midlands]] was established in [[Leeds]] in 1785.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cleary|first=E.

Most of the original societies were fully ''[[Terminating deposit|terminating]]'', where they would be dissolved when all members had a house: the last of them, First Salisbury, was wound up in March 1980.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rex|first=Simon|title=The History of Building Societies|url=http://www.bsa.org.uk/consumer/factsheets/100009.htm|publisher=[[Building Societies Association]]|accessdate=8 June 2010}}</ref> In the 1830s and 1840s a new development took place with the ''Permanent Building Society'', where the society continued on a rolling basis, continually taking in new members as earlier ones completed purchases, such as [[Leek United Building Society]]. The main legislative framework for the Building Society was the ''Building Society Act'' of 1874, with subsequent amending legislation in 1894, 1939 (see [[Coney Hall]]), and 1960.

In their heyday, there were hundreds of building societies: just about every town in the country had a building society named after that town. Over succeeding decades the number of societies has decreased, as various societies merged to form larger ones, often renaming in the process, and other societies opted for [[Demutualization|demutualisation]] followed by - in the great majority of cases - eventual takeover by a listed bank. Most of the existing larger building societies are the end result of the mergers of many smaller societies.

===1980s and 1990s===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}
In the 1980s, British banking laws were changed to allow building societies to offer banking services equivalent to normal [[bank]]s. The management of a number of societies still felt that they were unable to compete with the banks, and a new [[Building Societies Act 1986|Building Societies Act]] was passed in 1986 in response to their concerns. This permitted societies to '[[Demutualization|demutualise]]'. If more than 75% of members voted in favour, the building society would then become a [[limited company]] like any other. Members' mutual rights were exchanged for shares in this new company. A number of the larger societies made such proposals to their members and all were accepted. Some became independent companies quoted on the [[London Stock Exchange]], others were acquired by larger financial groups.

The process began with the demutualisation of the Abbey National building society in 1989. Then, from 1995 to late-1999, eight societies demutualised accounting for two thirds of building societies assets as at 1994. Five of these societies became joint stock banks (Plc), one merged with another and the other four were taken over by Plc’s (in two cases after the mutual had previously converted to a Plc).

Demutualisation moves succeeded immediately because neither Conservative nor Labour party UK Governments created a framework which put obstacles in the way of demutualisation. Political acquiescence in demutualisation was clearest in the case of the position on 'carpet baggers', that is those who joined societies by lodging minimum amounts of £100 or so in the hope of profiting from a distribution of surplus after demutualisation. The deregulating 1986 Building Societies Act contained an anti-carpet bagger provision in the form of a two year rule. This prescribed a qualifying period of two years before savers could participate in a residual claim. But, before the 1989 Abbey National Building Society demutualisation, the Courts found against the two year rule after legal action brought by Abbey National itself in order to circumvent the intent of the legislators. After this the legislation did prevent a cash distribution to members of less than two years standing, but the same result was obtained by permitting the issue of 'free' shares in the acquiring Plc, saleable for cash. The Thatcher Conservative government declined to introduce amending legislation to make good the defect in the 'two year rule'.

Building societies, like mutual life insurers, arose as people clubbed together to address a common need interest; in the case of the building societies, this was housing and members were originally both savers and borrowers. But it very quickly became clear that 'outsider' savers were needed whose motive was profit through interest on deposits. Thus permanent building societies quickly became mortgage banks and in such institutions there always existed a conflict of interest between borrowers and savers. It was the task of the movement to reconcile that conflict of interest so as to enable savers to conclude that their interests and those of borrowers were to some extent complementary rather than conflictive. Conflict of interest between savers and borrowers was never fully reconciled in the building societies but upon deregulation that reconciliation became something of a lost cause.

Once the opportunity to claim was presented by management the savers in particular could be relied upon to seize it. There were sufficient hard up borrowers to take the inducement offered them by management (in spite of few simple sums sufficing to demonstrate that they were probably going to end up effectively paying back the inducement).

Managements promoting demutualization also thereby met managerial objectives because the end of mutuality brought joint stock company (Plc) style remuneration committee pay standards and share options. Share options for management of converting societies appear to be a powerful factor in management calculation. Rasmusen (1988) refers to this in the following terms:
" ... perks do not rise in proportion to [mutual] bank size. If a mutual is large, or is expected to grow if it can raise capital by a conversion, its managers derive more value from a conversion but do not suffer much loss of perks than if the bank were small. Their benefit is in the right to purchase the new stock, which are valuable because the new issues are consistently underpriced [referring to USA mutual bank conversions]. Moreover, by no means are all mutual managers incompetent, and conversions allows the bank to expand more easily and to grant executive stock options that are valuable to skilled managers".

The management of building societies apparently could expend considerable time and resources (which belonged the organization) planning their effective capture—of as much of the assets as they could. If so, this is arguably insider dealing on a grand scale with the benefit of inside specialist knowledge of the business and resources of the firm not shared with outsiders like politicians and members (and, perhaps, regulators).

Instead of deploying their margin advantage as a defence of mutuality, around 1980 building societies began  setting mortgage rates with reference to market clearing levels. In sum they began behaving more like banks, seeking to maximize profit instead of the advantages of a mutual organization. Thus, according to the Bank of England's Boxall and Gallagher (1997), "... there was virtually no difference between banks and building society 'listed' interest rates for home finance mortgage lending between 1984 and 1997. This behaviour resulted in a return on assets for building societies which was at least as high as Plc banks and, in the absence of distribution, led to rapid accumulation of reserves". As Boxall and Gallagher (1997) also observe; "... accumulation of reserves in the early-1990's, beyond regulatory and future growth requirements, is difficult to reconcile with conventional theories of mutual behaviour".

Llewellyn (1996) draws a rather more direct and cynical conclusion;
"By adopting a policy of building up reserves by maintaining an excess margin, building societies simultaneously allowed banks to compete and may have undermined the long run viability of mutuality. A more cynical approach is that some societies may have adopted an excess-margin strategy simply to enhance their value for conversion".

Some of these managements ended up in dispute with their own members. Of the first major conversion of the Abbey in 1989, Kay (1991) observed;
" ... the paradox of the Abbey members who campaigned against flotation [conversion to a Plc bank] of their building society. They were fighting to preserve a degree of accountability to the membership which the management of the Society patently did not feel. For incumbent management, the contrary views of some of their members were not matters to be weighed in the balance and taken account of in formulation of policy. They were a nuisance to be dealt with by the costly use of public relations advisers and legal processes".

In the end, after a number of large demutualisations, and pressure from carpetbaggers moving from one building society to another to cream off the windfalls, most of the remaining societies modified their rules of membership in the late 1990s. The method usually adopted were membership rules to ensure that anyone newly joining a society would, for the first few years, be unable to get any profit out of a demutualisation. With the chance of a quick profit removed, the wave of demutualisations came to an end in 2000.

One academic study (Heffernan, 2003) found that demutualised societies' pricing behaviour on deposits and mortgages was more favourable to shareholders than to customers, with the remaining mutual building societies offering consistently better rates.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Effect of UK Building Society Conversion on Pricing Behaviour (March 2003) | author = Shelagh Heffernan | publisher = Faculty of Finance, CASS Business School, City of London | url = http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/facfin/papers/WP2003/Mutuals-WP.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 2007-10-10 }}</ref>

===2000s and 2010s===
The [[Butterfill Act]] was passed in 2007 giving building societies greater powers to merge with other companies. These powers have been used by the [[Britannia Building Society|Britannia]] in 2009 and [[Kent Reliance Building Society|Kent Reliance]] in 2011 leading to their demutualisation.

Prior to 31 December 2010, deposits with building societies of up to £50,000 per individual, per institution, were normally protected by the [[Financial Services Compensation Scheme]] (FSCS), but Nationwide and Yorkshire Building Societies negotiated a temporary change to the terms of the FSCS to protect members of the societies they acquired in late 2008/early 2009. The amended terms allowed former members of multiple societies which merge into one to maintain multiple entitlements to FSCS protection until 30 September 2009 (later extended to 30 December 2010), so (for example) a member with £50,000 in each of Nationwide, Cheshire and Derbyshire at the time of the respective mergers would retain £150,000 of FSCS protection for their funds in the merged Nationwide.<ref>http://www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk/news/product/bs_merger_compensation.html</ref> On 31 December 2010 the general FSCS limit for retail deposits was increased to £85,000 for banks and building societies and the transitional arrangements in respect of building society mergers came to an end.

=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], building societies evolved along British lines. Because of strict regulations on [[bank]]s, building societies flourished until the deregulation of the Australian financial industry in the 1980s. Eventually many of the smaller building societies disappeared, while some of the largest (such as [[St. George Bank|St. George]]) officially attained the status of banks.

A particular difference between Australian building societies and those elsewhere, is that Australian building societies are required to incorporate as [[limited companies]].

Current building societies are
*[[IMB Banking & Financial Services]]
*[[ABS Building Society]]
*[[Greater Building Society]]
*[[Heritage Building Society]]
*[[Hume Building Society]]
*[[Lifeplan Australia Building Society]]
*[[Maitland Mutual Building Society]]
*[[Newcastle Permanent Building Society]]
*[[The Rock Building Society (Rockhampton and Surrounds)]]

=== Ireland ===
The [[Republic of Ireland]] had around 40 building societies at the mid-20th century peak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibf.ie/Libraries/Guides_Forms/bsnames_1.sflb.ashx |title=List of Building Society Changes |publisher=Irish Banking Federation |date= |accessdate=2013-04-25}}</ref> Many of these were very small and, as the Irish commercial banks began to originate residential mortgages, the small building societies ceased to be competitive. Most merged or dissolved or, in the case of [[First Active|First Active plc]], converted into conventional banks. The last remaining building societies, [[EBS Building Society]] and [[Irish Nationwide Building Society]], demutualised and were transferred or acquired into Bank subsidiaries in 2011 following the effects of the [[2008–2011 Irish financial crisis]].

[[Leeds Building Society Ireland]] and [[Nationwide UK (Ireland)]] are Irish branches of building societies based in the United Kingdom.

=== Jamaica ===
In [[Jamaica]], four building societies compete with commercial banks and credit unions for most consumer financial services.

=== New Zealand ===
In [[New Zealand]], a number of building societies were established. Some, including [[Countrywide Bank (New Zealand)|Countrywide Building Society]] and [[United Building Society]], became banks in the 1980s and 1990s. Remaining building societies include:
*[[Nelson Building Society]]
*[[Southland Building Society]], which moved in October 2008 to become a registered bank known as SBS Bank. However,it remained a building society and so retained its mutual structure.
*[[Heartland Building Society]], created in 2011 through merger of Canterbury Building Society, Southern Cross Building Society and two other financial institutions.
* [http://www.general-equity.com General Equity Building Society] 
* [[Hastings Building Society]] 
* Heretaunga Building Society 
* International Building & Investment Society
* Kiwi Deposit Building Society (now in dissolution)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kiwideposit.com/index.php|publisher=Kiwi Deposit Building Society|title=Notice of Instrument of Dissolution|date= 18 April 2013|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref>
* [[Loan And Building Society]] 
* Manawatu Permanent Building Society 
* Manchester Unity Building Society 
* The Napier Building Society (Permanent)
* Wairarapa Building Society

Registration as a building society is largely a formality.  The Registrar of Building Societies does not conduct any prudential assessment of the new entity, nor of its financial soundness, as part of the registration process.

Once registered, the extent to which a building society is subject to prudential supervision depends on whether it takes deposits from New Zealanders:

* Building societies that accept deposits in New Zealand aresubject to certain prudential regulations. The [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]] (New Zealand's central bank) monitors compliance with these regulations.  However, the Reserve Bank does not supervise individual building societies for financial soundness.<ref name="rbnz.govt.nz">http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/regulation_and_supervision/cautions_and_notices/3765520.html</ref> (This is in contrast to New Zealand-registered banks, which are subject to a stringent prudential regime, including capital, liquity, and governance requirements.)<ref>http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/regulation_and_supervision/banks/prudential_requirements/</ref>

* Building societies that do not take deposits in New Zealand are not prudentially supervised. New Zealand law does not provide for an officially sanctioned offshore finance industry; there is no provision for the licensing or supervision of any form of offshore financial institutions that are incorporated in New Zealand but provide financial services only outside of New Zealand.<ref>http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/regulation_and_supervision/cautions_and_notices/4300863.html</ref> Further, the Reserve Bank has no jurisdiction to monitor transactions undertaken by building societies that operate offshore only (e.g. Kiwi Deposit Building Society and General Equity Building Society).<ref name="rbnz.govt.nz"/> The risk is that persons outside New Zealand may assume from the fact that such building societies are registered in New Zealand that they are supervised financial institutions, when they are in fact not. There is a concern that this enables non-residents to register building societies in New Zealand to engage in dubious financial practices or scams in other countries (as New Zealand residency or a presence in New Zealand is not required in order to register a building society in New Zealand.<ref>http://www.interest.co.nz/news/60461/entities-peddling-unregulated-nz-offshore-finance-companies-world-tout-their-benefits-and</ref><ref>http://www.interest.co.nz/news/58855/registered-here-and-operating-overseas-three-building-societies-feature-us55-bln-mine-ass</ref><ref>http://www.interest.co.nz/news/65696/general-equity-no-ordinary-new-zealand-building-society</ref>

===Other countries===
In other countries there are mutual organisations similar to building societies:
*'''Austria''': In [[Austria]] there are four co-operative banks: Allgemeine Bausparkasse (ABV), [[Raiffeisen Zentralbank|Raiffeisen-Bausparkasse]], Bausparkasse Wüstenrot AG and Bausparkasse der Sparkassen (savings bank).

*'''Finland:''' In [[Finland]] the [[Mortgage Society of Finland]], a permanent building society, was founded in 1860. Since 2002 mortgage loans are handled by [[Suomen AsuntoHypoPankki]], the licensed bank owned by the society.

*'''Germany:''' In [[Germany]] there are 11 Bausparkassen der [[German public banks#Sparkasse|Sparkassen]] ([[savings bank]]) named ''Landesbausparkassen'' (LBS) and 15 Bausparkassen of the [[private bank]]s, for example Schwäbisch Hall, Wüstenrot, Deutsche Bank Bauspar AG and so on.

*'''United States:''' In the [[United States]], [[savings and loan association]]s have a similar organisation and purpose.

==Operational differences from banks==
;Roll numbers:

Because most building societies were not direct members of the UK clearing system, it was common for them to use a '''roll number''' to identify accounts rather than to allocate a six-digit [[sort-code]] and eight-digit account number to the [[BACS]] standards.

More recently, building societies have tended to obtain sort-code and account number allocations within the clearing system, and hence the use of roll numbers has diminished. When using BACS, one needs to enter roll numbers for the reference field and the building society's generic sort code and account number would be entered in the standard BACS fields.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.experianpayments.com/glossary/roll-number.html |title=Roll Number |publisher= Experianpayments.com }}</ref>
