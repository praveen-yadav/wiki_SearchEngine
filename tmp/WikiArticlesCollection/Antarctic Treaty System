The '''Antarctic Treaty''' and related agreements, collectively called the '''Antarctic Treaty System''' ('''ATS)''', regulate [[international relations]] with respect to [[Antarctica]], Earth's only continent without a native human population. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all of the land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of [[60th parallel south|60°S latitude]]. The treaty, entering into force in 1961 and currently having 50 signatory nations, sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, establishes freedom of scientific investigation and bans [[Military activity in the Antarctic|military activity on that continent]]. The treaty was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]]. The [[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]] headquarters have been located in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, since September 2004.<ref>[http://www.ats.aq/index_e.htm ATS.aq]</ref>

The main treaty was opened for signature on December 1, 1959,<ref name=Brit>"Antarctic Treaty" in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica|The New Encyclopaedia Britannica]]''. Chicago: [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc.]], 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 439.</ref> and officially entered into force on June 23, 1961.<ref>{{cite web

|title=Information about the Antarctic Treaty and how Antarctica is governed.
|accessdate=February 6, 2011
|date=December 28, 2005
|publisher=Polar Conservation Organisation}}</ref> The original signatories were the 12 countries active in Antarctica during the [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY) of 1957–58. The twelve countries had significant interests in Antarctica at the time: [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Chile]], [[France]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[South Africa]], the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].<ref name=Brit/> These countries had established over 50 Antarctic stations for the IGY. The treaty was a diplomatic expression of the operational and scientific cooperation that had been achieved "on the ice".

===Articles of the Antarctic Treaty===
* '''Article 1''' – The area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited but military personnel and equipment may be used for scientific research or any other peaceful purpose;
* '''Article 2''' – Freedom of scientific investigations and cooperation shall continue;
* '''Article 3''' – Free exchange of information and personnel in cooperation with the United Nations and other international agencies;
* '''Article 4''' – The treaty does not recognize, dispute, nor establish territorial sovereignty claims; no new claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in force;
* '''Article 5''' – The treaty prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive wastes;
* '''Article 6''' – Includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves but not the surrounding waters south of [[60th parallel south|60 degrees 00 minutes south]];
* '''Article 7''' – Treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial observation, to any area and may inspect all stations, installations, and equipment; advance notice of all activities and of the introduction of military personnel must be given;
* '''Article 8''' – Allows for good jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own states;
* '''Article 9''' – Frequent consultative meetings take place among member nations;
* '''Article 10''' – All treaty states will discourage activities by any country in Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty;
* '''Article 11''' – All disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned or, ultimately, by the [[International Court of Justice]];
* '''Articles 12, 13, 14''' – Deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending the treaty among involved nations.

The main objective of the ATS is to ensure <cite>in the interests of all humankind that Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord</cite>. Pursuant to Article 1, the treaty forbids <cite>any measures of a military nature</cite>, but not the presence of military personnel or equipment for the purposes of scientific research.

===Other agreements===

Other agreements&nbsp;— some 200 recommendations adopted at treaty consultative meetings and ratified by governments&nbsp;— include:
* [[Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora]] (1964) (entered into force in 1982)
* The [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals]] (1972)
* The [[Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] (1982)
* The [[Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities]] (1988) (signed in 1988, not in force)
* The [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] was signed October 4, 1991 and entered into force January 14, 1998; this agreement prevents development and provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment through five specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna and flora, [[environmental impact assessment]]s, waste management, and protected areas. It prohibits all activities relating to mineral resources except scientific. A sixth annex&nbsp;— on liability arising from environmental emergencies&nbsp;— was adopted in 2005 but is yet to enter into force.

==Meetings==
The Antarctic Treaty System's yearly ''Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCM)'' are the international forum for the administration and management of the region. Only 28 of the 49 parties to the agreements have the right to participate in decision-making at these meetings, though the other 21 are still allowed to attend. The decision-making participants are the ''Consultative Parties'' and, in addition to the 12 original signatories, include 16 countries that have demonstrated their interest in Antarctica by carrying out substantial scientific activity there.<ref>[http://www.ats.aq/ Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]</ref>

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Claims overlap.<br>
<nowiki>**</nowiki> Reserved the right to claim areas.

As of 2013, there are 50 treaty member nations: 28 consultative and 22 acceding. Consultative (voting) members include the seven nations that claim portions of Antarctica as national territory. The 22 non-claimant nations either do not recognize the claims of others, or have not stated their positions.

==Antarctic Treaty Secretariat==
{{main|Antarctic Treaty Secretariat}}
The ''Antarctic Treaty Secretariat'' was established in Buenos Aires, Argentina in September 2004 by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM). Jan Huber (Netherlands) served as the first Executive Secretary for five years until August 31, 2009. He was succeeded on September 1, 2009 by Manfred Reinke (Germany), appointed for a four-year term.

The tasks of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat can be divided into the following areas:
* Supporting the annual Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) and the meeting of the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP).
* Facilitating the exchange of information between the Parties required in the Treaty and the Environment Protocol.
* Collecting, storing, arranging and publishing the documents of the ATCM.
* Providing and disseminating public information about the Antarctic Treaty system and Antarctic activities.

==Legal system==
Antarctica has no permanent population and therefore it has no citizenship nor government. All personnel present on Antarctica at any time are citizens or nationals of some sovereignty outside of Antarctica, as there is no Antarctic sovereignty. The majority of Antarctica is claimed by one or more countries, but most countries do not explicitly recognize those claims. The area on the mainland between [[90th meridian west|90 degrees west]] and [[150th meridian west|150 degrees west]], combined with the interior of the Norwegian Sector (the extent of which has never been officially defined){{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, is the only major land on Earth not claimed by any country.<ref>Wright, Minturn, "The Ownership of Antarctica, Its Living and Mineral Resources", ''Journal of Law and the Environment'' 4 (1987).</ref>  The Treaty prohibits any nation from claiming this area.

Governments that are party to the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection implement the articles of these agreements, and decisions taken under them, through national laws. These laws generally apply only to their own citizens, wherever they are in Antarctica, and serve to enforce the consensus decisions of the consultative parties: about which activities are acceptable, which areas require permits to enter, what processes of environmental impact assessment must precede activities, and so on. The Antarctic Treaty is often considered to represent an example of the [[Common heritage of mankind]] principle.<ref>Jennifer Frakes, The Common Heritage of Mankind Principle and the Deep Seabed, Outer Space, and Antarctica: Will Developed and Developing Nations Reach a Compromise? Wisconsin International Law Journal. 2003; 21:409</ref>

===Argentina===
According to Argentine regulations, any crime committed within 50 kilometers of any Argentine base is to be judged in [[Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego|Ushuaia]] (as capital of [[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica, and South Atlantic Islands]]). In the part of [[Argentine Antarctica]] that is also claimed by Chile and UK, the person to be judged can ask to be transferred there.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Australia===
Since the designation of the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]] pre-dated the signing of the Antarctic Treaty, Australian laws that relate to Antarctica date from more than two decades before the Antarctic Treaty era. In terms of criminal law, the laws that apply to the [[Jervis Bay Territory]] (which follows the laws of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]) apply to the Australian Antarctic Territory. Key Australian legislation applying Antarctic Treaty System decisions include the ''Antarctic Treaty Act 1960'', the ''Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980'' and the ''Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act 1981''.<ref>[http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=3358 Australian Antarctic Division – Australian environmental law and guidelines<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===United States===
The [[law of the United States]], including certain criminal offenses by or against U.S. nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under jurisdiction of other countries. To this end, the United States now stations special deputy [[United States Marshal|U.S. Marshals]] in Antarctica to provide a law enforcement presence.<ref>[http://www.usmarshals.gov/history/antarctica/ Marshals and Antarctica<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Some U.S. laws directly apply to Antarctica. For example, the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]], Public Law 95-541, {{UnitedStatesCode|16|2401}} ''et seq.'', provides civil and criminal penalties for the following activities, unless authorized by regulation or [[statute]]:
* the taking of native Antarctic mammals or birds
* the introduction into Antarctica of non-indigenous plants and animals
* entry into specially protected or scientific areas
* the discharge or disposal of pollutants into Antarctica or Antarctic waters
* the importation into the U.S. of certain items from Antarctica

Violation of the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to US$10,000 in fines and one year in prison. The Departments of [[United States Department of the Treasury|the Treasury]], [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce]], [[United States Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and [[United States Department of the Interior|the Interior]] share enforcement responsibilities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The Act requires expeditions from the U.S. to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the [[Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs]] of the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], which reports such plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Further information is provided by the [[Office of Polar Programs]] of the [[National Science Foundation]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===New Zealand===
In 2006, the New Zealand police reported that jurisdictional issues prevented them issuing warrants for potential American witnesses who were reluctant to testify during the Christchurch Coroner's investigation into the death by poisoning of Australian astrophysicist [[Rodney Marks (astrophysicist)|Rodney Marks]] at the [[South Pole]] base in May 2000.<ref name="stuffSunday">Hotere, Andrea.

Retrieved on December 19, 2006.</ref> Dr. Marks died while wintering over at the United States' [[Amundsen&ndash;Scott South Pole Station]] located at the geographic [[South Pole]]. Prior to autopsy, the death was attributed to natural causes by the [[National Science Foundation]] and the contractor administering the base. However, an autopsy in New Zealand revealed that Dr. Marks died from [[methanol]] poisoning. The [[New Zealand Police]] launched an investigation. In 2006, frustrated by lack of progress, the [[Christchurch]] Coroner said that it was unlikely that Dr. Marks ingested the methanol knowingly, although there is no certainty that he died as the direct result of the act of another person. During media interviews, the police detective in charge of the investigation criticized the National Science Foundation and contractor [[Raytheon]] for failing to co-operate with the investigation.<ref name="TelegraphChapman">Chapman, Paul.

===South Africa===
South African law applies to all South African citizens in Antarctica, and they are subject to the jurisdiction of the [[Magistrates' Courts of South Africa|magistrate's court]] in [[Cape Town]].<ref>Section 2 of the South African Citizens in Antarctica Act, No. 55 of 1962, as amended by the Environmental Laws Rationalisation Act, No. 51 of 1997.</ref> In regard to violations of the Antarctic Treaty and related agreements, South Africa also asserts jurisdiction over South African residents and members of expeditions organised in South Africa.<ref>Antarctic Treaties Act, No. 60 of 1996.</ref>
