Alredus, or '''Alfred of Beverley''', ([[floruit|fl.]] 1143),  [[English historians in the Middle Ages|English chronicler]], was [[sacristan]] of the church of [[Beverley]] in the first half of the twelfth century.

He wrote, apparently about the year 1143, a [[chronicle]] entitled ''Annales sive Historia de gestis regum Britanniae'',  which begins with [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]] and carries the history of England down to 1129.

[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] and [[Simeon of Durham]] are Alfred's chief sources.
