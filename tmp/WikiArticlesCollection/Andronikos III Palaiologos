'''Andronikos III Palaiologos''', Latinized as '''Andronicus III Palaeologus''' ({{lang-el|Ανδρόνικος Γ' Παλαιολόγος, ''Andronikos III Paleologos''}}; 25 March 1297 – 15 June 1341) was [[Byzantine emperor]] from  1328 to 1341, after being rival emperor since 1321. Andronikos III was the son of [[Michael IX Palaiologos]] and [[Rita of Armenia]] (renamed Maria). His maternal grandparents were King [[Levon II of Armenia (King)|Levon II of Armenia]] and [[Queen Keran of Armenia]].

== Life ==
Andronikos was born in  [[Constantinople]] on his grandfather's 38th birthday.

In 1320, Andronikos accidentally caused the death of his brother Manuel, whereupon their father died of grief. The murder, and the general dissolute behaviour of Andronikos and his coterie, mostly the young scions of the Empire's great aristocratic clans, resulted in a deep rift in the relations between him and his grandfather, [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]]. The elder Andronikos disowned his grandson, whereupon Andronikos III fled the capital and rallied his supporters around him in [[Thrace]]. From there he waged an intermittent [[Byzantine civil war of 1321–1328|civil war]] against his grandfather, which first secured him recognition of his post as co-emperor, and ultimately led to the deposition of Andronikos II in 1328.

Effective administrative authority during the reign of Andronikos III was wielded by his ''[[megas domestikos]]'' [[John Kantakouzenos]], while the Emperor enjoyed himself hunting or waging war. [[Treaty of Chernomen|An alliance]] with his brother-in-law [[Michael Shishman of Bulgaria|Michael Asen III of Bulgaria]] against [[Stefan Decanski|Stefan Uroš III Dečanski]] of [[Raška (state)|Serbia]] failed to secure any gains, as the Serbians defeated the Bulgarians before the latter could join with the Byzantines in the [[Battle of Velbazhd]] (modern [[Kyustendil]]) in 1330. Andronikos III's attempt to make up for this setback by annexing Bulgarian Thrace failed in 1332, when he was defeated by the new Bulgarian Emperor [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria|Ivan Alexander]] [[Battle of Rusokastro|at Rousokastron]]. Peace with Bulgaria was secured through territorial concessions and a diplomatic marriage between the children of the two emperors.

The subsequent years witnessed the gradual extinction of Byzantine rule in [[Asia Minor]], as [[Orhan I|Orhan]] of the [[Ottoman Turks]], who had already defeated Andronikos III at [[Battle of Pelekanos|Pelekanos]] in 1329, took [[İznik|Nicaea]] in 1331 and [[Nicomedia]] in 1337. After that, only [[Alaşehir|Philadelpheia]] and a handful of ports remained under Byzantine control in Asia Minor. Earlier Andronikos III had effected the recovery of the islands of [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]] and [[Chios]] from [[Martino Zaccaria]] in 1329 and  of [[Phocaea]] in 1334 from the last Genoese governor Domenico Cattaneo. However, this did little to stem the Ottoman advance in Asia Minor.

Under [[Stefan Dusan|Stefan Uroš IV Dušan]], Serbia expanded into Byzantine territory in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], taking [[Ohrid]], [[Prilep]], [[Kastoria]], [[Strumica]], and [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]] in about 1334. The one-time governor of [[Thessalonica]], [[Syrgiannes Palaeologos]], had deserted to the side of the Serbians and aided their advance into Macedonia. The Serbs, led by Syrgiannes, advanced as far as Thessalonica, but there Syrgiannes was betrayed and killed the by the Byzantine general Sphrantzes Palaiologos. This brought the Serbian army into disarray.<ref>Norwich, John Julius. ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1996) p. 283-284</ref> In August of 1334 Stefan Dusan and Andronikos made peace, and the forces of Andronikos were allowed to retake control of those parts of Macedonia that Syrgiannes had captured.<ref>Norwich. ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'' p. 284</ref>

Despite these troubles Andronikos III secured the extension of Byzantine control over [[Thessaly]] in 1333 and [[Epirus]] in 1337, by taking advantage of succession crises in these principalities.

Andronikos III reorganized the [[Byzantine navy]] (consisted of 10 ships by 1332) and reformed the [[Judiciary|judicial system]] by forming a panel of four universal judges whom he designated "Universal Justices of the Romans". In retrospect his reign may be said to end before the situation of the [[Byzantine Empire]] became untenable. In spite of several not insignificant reverses at the hands of Bulgarians, Serbians, and Ottomans, the Emperor had provided the Empire with active leadership, had cooperated with able administrators, and had come closer than any of his predecessors in re-establishing Byzantine control over the Greek peninsula.

The Muslim traveller [[Ibn Battuta]], who visited Constantinople towards the end of 1332, mentions in his memoirs having met Andronikos III. This is not attested in Byzantine sources.

Nicaea, until 1261 the capital of the Empire, was under siege by Ottoman Turks. In the summer of 1329, Andronikos III launched a relief attempt which culminated in a defeat at the Battle of Pelekanon on 10[15] June and in 1331, the city fell. Not wishing to see Nicomedia or the other few remaining forts in Asia Minor suffer the same fate, Andronikos III sought to pay off the Ottomans with tribute — the Ottomans did not stop at this and seized Nicomedia as well in 1337.

Andronikos III died at [[Constantinople]], aged 44, in 1341. Within a few months, the right to exercise the regency over his infant son, [[John V Palaiologos]], and the position of Andronikos' all-powerful chief minister and friend John Kantakouzenos led to the outbreak of a destructive [[Byzantine civil war of 1341-1347|seven-year civil war]].

== Family ==
Andronikos III was first married, in 1318, with [[Irene of Brunswick]], daughter of [[Henry I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]]; she died in 1324. They had an unnamed son, who died shortly after birth in 1321.

Andronikos III married as his second wife, in 1326, with [[Anna of Savoy]]. She was a daughter of Count [[Amadeus V, Count of Savoy]] and his second wife Maria of Brabant. They had several children, including:
* [[John V Palaiologos]]
* [[Michael Palaiologos (son of Andronikos III)|Michael Palaiologos]], ''[[despotes]]''
* Maria (renamed Eirene) Palaiologina, who married Emperor [[Michael Asen IV of Bulgaria]]
* Eirene Palaiologina (renamed Maria), who married [[Francesco I of Lesbos]]

According to [[Nicephorus Gregoras]], Andronikos also had an illegitimate daughter, [[Irene Palaiologina of Trebizond]]. She married [[Basil of Trebizond]] and took over the throne of the [[Empire of Trebizond]] from 1340 to 1341.<ref>{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/BYZANTIUM%2012611453.htm#EirenePdied1341 |title-date= |title= Profile of Irene |date=August 2012}}</ref> The ''Dictionnaire historique et Généalogique des grandes familles de Grèce, d'Albanie et de Constantinople'' (1983) by Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza adds a second illegitimate daughter of Andronikos, converting to [[Islam]] under the name Bayalun.

== Legacy ==
Under Andronikos the Byzantine Empire came closest to regaining a position of power in the Balkan Peninsula since the Fourth Crusade. Although an energetic campaigner, the empire during this period was just too weak to defeat its enemies in Anatolia, Bulgaria and Serbia. His loss of the empire's few remaining territories in Anatolia made the Ottoman Turks posed to expand into Europe as did its lack of strength following his reign to prevent the formation of the Serbian Empire. Yet none of this was due to a lack of leadership on Andronikos' part and his reign could be said to end before the Byzantine Empire's position became untenable due to the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347|ensuing civil war]] which consumed the empire's remaining resources on Andronikos's death.
