'''Arsenic''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&nbsp;'''As''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;33. Arsenic occurs in many [[mineral]]s, usually in conjunction with [[sulfur]] and [[metal]]s, and also as a pure elemental crystal. It was first documented by [[Albertus Magnus]] in 1250.<ref name="BuildingBlocks451-3">{{cite book |last=Emsley |first=John |title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements |year=2001 |isbn=0-19-850341-5|pages=43, 513, 529 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford}}</ref> Arsenic is a [[metalloid]]. It can exist in various [[allotropy|allotropes]], although only the gray form has important use in industry.

The main use of metallic arsenic is for strengthening [[alloy]]s of [[copper]] and especially [[lead]] (for example, in [[car batteries]]). Arsenic is a common n-type [[dopant]] in [[semiconductor]] electronic devices, and the [[optoelectronic]] compound [[gallium arsenide]] is the most common semiconductor in use after doped [[silicon]]. Arsenic and its compounds, especially the trioxide, are used in the production of [[pesticide]]s, treated wood products, [[herbicide]]s, and [[insecticide]]s. These applications are declining, however.<ref name=Ullmann>{{Ullmann|author = Sabina C. Grund, Kunibert Hanusch, Hans Uwe Wolf|title = Arsenic and Arsenic Compounds|doi = 10.1002/14356007.a03_113.pub2}}</ref>

Arsenic is notoriously [[poisonous]] to multicellular life, although [[#Bacteria|a few species of bacteria]] are able to use arsenic compounds as respiratory metabolites. [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater]] is a problem that affects millions of people across the world.

As of 2003, at least 33 [[radioisotope]]s have also been synthesized, ranging in [[atomic mass]] from 60 to 92. The most stable of these is <sup>73</sup>As with a [[half-life]] of 80.30&nbsp;days. All other isotopes have half-lives of under one day, with the exception of <sup>71</sup>As (t<sub>1/2</sub>=65.30 hours), <sup>72</sup>As (t<sub>1/2</sub>=26.0 hours), <sup>74</sup>As (t<sub>1/2</sub>=17.77 days), <sup>76</sup>As (t<sub>1/2</sub>=1.0942 days), and <sup>77</sup>As (t<sub>1/2</sub>=38.83 hours). Isotopes that are lighter than the stable <sup>75</sup>As tend to decay by [[beta decay|β<sup>+</sup> decay]], and those that are heavier tend to decay by [[beta decay|β<sup>−</sup> decay]], with some exceptions.

At least 10 [[nuclear isomer]]s have been described, ranging in atomic mass from 66 to 84. The most stable of arsenic's isomers is <sup>68m</sup>As with a half-life of 111&nbsp;seconds.<ref name="NUBASE"/>

===Chemistry===
When heated in air, arsenic [[oxidation|oxidizes]] to [[arsenic trioxide]]; the fumes from this reaction have an odor resembling [[garlic]]. This odor can be detected on striking [[arsenide]] minerals such as [[arsenopyrite]] with a hammer. Arsenic (and some arsenic compounds) [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimes]] upon heating at atmospheric pressure, converting directly to a gaseous form without an intervening liquid state at {{convert|887|K|C}}.<ref name="Gokcen1989" /> The [[triple point]] is 3.63&nbsp;MPa and {{convert|1090|K|C}}.<ref name="Holl"/><ref name="Gokcen1989" /> Arsenic makes [[arsenic acid]] with concentrated [[nitric acid]], [[arsenious acid]] with dilute nitric acid, and [[arsenic trioxide]] with concentrated [[sulfuric acid]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911|title=Arsenic|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.com/Arsenic}}</ref>

{{Category see also|Arsenic compounds}}
Arsenic compounds resemble in some respects those of [[phosphorus]] which occupies the same [[Group (periodic table)|group]] (column) of the [[periodic table]].  Arsenic is less commonly observed in the pentavalent state, however. The most common [[oxidation state]]s for arsenic are: −3 in the [[arsenide]]s, such as alloy-like intermetallic compounds; and +3 in the [[arsenite]]s, arsenates(III), and most organoarsenic compounds.  Arsenic also bonds readily to itself as seen in the square As{{su|b=4|p=3−}} ions in the mineral [[skutterudite]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0080-8784(01)80151-4 | chapter = Chapter 5 Skutterudites: Prospective novel thermoelectrics | title = Recent Trends in Thermoelectric Materials Research I | series = Semiconductors and Semimetals | year = 2001 | last1 = Uher | first1 = Ctirad | isbn = 9780127521787 | volume = 69 | pages = 139}}</ref>  In the +3 [[oxidation state]], arsenic is typically pyramidal owing to the influence of the [[lone pair]] of [[electron]]s.<ref name="Norman"/><!--page 30-->

===Inorganic compounds===
Arsenic forms colorless, odorless, crystalline [[oxide]]s [[Arsenic trioxide|As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>]] ("[[white arsenic]]") and [[Arsenic pentoxide|As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]] which are [[hygroscopic]] and readily soluble in water to form acidic solutions. [[Arsenic acid|Arsenic(V) acid]] is a weak acid. Its salts are called [[arsenate]]s which are the basis of [[arsenic contamination of groundwater]], a problem that affects many people. Synthetic arsenates include [[Paris Green]] (copper(II) acetoarsenite), [[calcium arsenate]], and [[lead hydrogen arsenate]]. These three have been used as [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[insecticide]]s and [[poison]]s.

The protonation steps between the arsenate and arsenic acid are similar to those between [[phosphate]] and [[phosphoric acid]]. Unlike [[phosphorous acid]], [[arsenous acid]] is genuinely tribasic, with the formula As(OH)<sub>3</sub>.

A broad variety of sulfur compounds of arsenic are known.  Orpiment ([[arsenic trisulfide|As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>]]) and realgar ([[tetraarsenic tetrasulfide|As<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>]]) are somewhat abundant and were formerly used as painting pigments. In As<sub>4</sub>S<sub>10</sub>, arsenic has a formal oxidation state of +2 in As<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> which features As-As bonds so that the total covalency of As is still 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com/webelements/compounds/text/As/As4S4-12279902.html|title=Arsenic: arsenic(II) sulfide compound data|accessdate=2007-12-10|publisher=WebElements.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071211100733/http://www.webelements.com/webelements/compounds/text/As/As4S4-12279902.html| archivedate= 11 December 2007|deadurl= no}}</ref>

All trihalides of arsenic(III) are well known except the astatide which is unknown.  [[Arsenic pentafluoride]] (AsF<sub>5</sub>) is the only important pentahalide, reflecting the lower stability of the 5+ oxidation state.  ([[Arsenic pentachloride|pentachloride]] is stable only below −50&nbsp;°C.<ref name="Holl"/>)

===Heredity===
Arsenic has been linked to [[epigenetics|epigenetic changes]], heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in [[DNA sequence]]. These include DNA methylation, histone modification, and [[RNA]] interference. Toxic levels of arsenic cause significant DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes p16 and p53, thus increasing risk of carcinogenesis. These epigenetic events have been studied ''in vitro'' using human kidney cells and ''in vivo'' using rat liver cells and peripheral blood leukocytes in humans.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baccarelli|first=A.|year=2009|title=Epigenetics and environmental chemicals|journal=Current Opinion in Pediatrics |issue=2 |volume=21 |pages=243–251 |doi=10.1097/MOP.0b013e32832925cc |pmid=19663042|last2=Bollati|first2=V.|pmc=3035853}}</ref> Inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is used to detect precise levels of intracellular arsenic and its other bases involved in epigenetic modification of DNA.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nicholis|first=I.|year=2009|title=Arsenite medicinal use, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and monitoring in human hair| journal=Biochimie| pmid=19527769| doi=10.1016/j.biochi.2009.06.003 |last2=Curis |last3=Deschamps|last4=Bénazeth|volume=91|first2=E.|first3=P.|first4=S.|issue=10|pages=1260–7}}</ref> Studies investigating arsenic as an epigenetic factor will help in developing precise biomarkers of exposure and susceptibility.

Low-level exposure to arsenic at concentrations of 100 parts per billion (i.e., above the 10 parts per billion drinking water standard) compromises the initial immune response to [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1 or swine flu]] infection according to NIEHS-supported scientists.

Some Canadians are drinking water that contains inorganic arsenic.  Private dug well waters are most at risk for containing inorganic arsenic.  Preliminary well water analyses typically does not test for arsenic.

Epidemiological evidence from [[Chile]] shows a dose-dependent connection between chronic arsenic exposure and various forms of cancer, in particular when other risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, are present. These effects have been demonstrated to persist below 50 ppb.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Arsenic exposure and its impact on health in Chile |journal=J Health Popul Nutr |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=164–75 |year=2006 |pmid=17195557|last1=Ferreccio |first1=C. |last2=Sancha |first2=A.

If they all consumed exactly 10 ppb arsenic in their drinking water, the previously cited multiple epidemiological study analysis would predict an additional 2,000 cases of bladder cancer alone. This represents a clear underestimate of the overall impact, since it does not include lung or skin cancer, and explicitly underestimates the exposure. Those exposed to levels of arsenic above the current WHO standard should weigh the costs and benefits of arsenic remediation.

Early (1973) evaluations of the removal of dissolved arsenic by drinking water treatment processes demonstrated that arsenic is very effectively removed by co-precipitation with either iron or aluminum oxides. The use of iron as a coagulant, in particular, was found to remove arsenic with efficiencies exceeding 90%.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Removal of Arsenic (V) from Water by Adsorption on Aluminum and Ferric Hydroxides|journal=J.

A team of European and Indian scientists and engineers have set up six arsenic treatment plants in [[West Bengal]] based on in-situ remediation method (SAR Technology). This technology does not use any chemicals and arsenic is left as an insoluble form (+5 state) in the subterranean zone by recharging aerated water into the aquifer and thus developing an oxidation zone to support arsenic oxidizing micro-organisms. This process does not produce any waste stream or sludge and is relatively cheap.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.insituarsenic.org|title = In situ arsenic treatment|work=insituarsenic.org|accessdate = 2010-05-13}}</ref>

Another effective and inexpensive method to remove arsenic from contaminated well water is to sink wells 500&nbsp;feet or deeper to reach purer waters. A recent 2011 study funded by the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' Superfund Research Program shows that deep sediments can remove arsenic and take it out of circulation. Through this process called adsorption in which arsenic sticks to the surfaces of deep sediment particles, arsenic can be naturally removed from well water.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ngeo1283|title=Arsenic migration to deep groundwater in Bangladesh influenced by adsorption and water demand|year=2011|last1=Radloff|first1=K.

Although discontinued, this application is also one of the most concern to the general public. The vast majority of older [[Timber treatment|pressure-treated]] wood was treated with CCA. CCA lumber is still in widespread use in many countries, and was heavily used during the latter half of the 20th century as a structural and outdoor [[building material]]. Although the use of CCA lumber was banned in many areas after studies showed that arsenic could leach out of the wood into the surrounding [[soil]] (from playground equipment, for instance), a risk is also presented by the burning of older CCA timber. The direct or indirect ingestion of wood ash from burnt CCA lumber has caused fatalities in animals and serious poisonings in humans; the lethal human dose is approximately 20&nbsp;grams of ash. Scrap CCA lumber from construction and demolition sites may be inadvertently used in commercial and domestic fires. Protocols for safe disposal of CCA lumber do not exist evenly throughout the world; there is also concern in some quarters about the widespread [[landfill]] disposal of such timber.

==Toxicity and precautions==
{{Main|Arsenic poisoning|Arsenic toxicity}}
Arsenic and many of its compounds are especially potent poisons. Many water supplies close to mines are contaminated by these poisons.

===Classification===
Elemental arsenic and arsenic compounds are classified as "[[toxicity|toxic]]" and "dangerous for the environment" in the [[European Union]] under [[directive 67/548/EEC]].
<!-- INDEX 033-001-00-X (arsenic) R23/25-50/53; S1/2-20/21-28-45-60-61 -->
<!-- INDEX 033-002-00-5 (other compounds) pareil -->The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) recognizes arsenic and arsenic compounds as [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|group 1 carcinogens]], and the EU lists arsenic trioxide, [[arsenic pentoxide]] and [[arsenate]] salts as category 1 [[carcinogen]]s.

Arsenic is known to cause [[Arsenic poisoning#Arsenicosis: chronic arsenic poisoning from drinking water|arsenicosis]] owing to its manifestation in drinking water, "the most common species being arsenate [{{chem|HAsO|4|2-}}; As(V)] and arsenite [H<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>3</sub>; As(III)]".

===Biological mechanism===
The high affinity of arsenic(III) oxides for [[thiol]]s is usually assigned as the cause of the high toxicity. Thiols, usually in the form of [[cysteine]] residues, but also in [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] such as [[lipoic acid]] and [[coenzyme A]], are situated at the active sites of many important [[enzyme]]s.<ref name=Ullmann/>

Arsenic disrupts [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production through several mechanisms. At the level of the [[citric acid cycle]], arsenic inhibits lipoic acid, which is a cofactor for [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]]. In addition, by competing with phosphate, arsenate uncouples [[oxidative phosphorylation]], thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD+]], mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which, it is speculated, has potential to form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. These metabolic interferences lead to death from multi-system [[organ failure]]. The organ failure is presumed to be from [[necrotic]] cell death, not [[apoptosis]], since energy reserves have been too depleted for apoptosis to occur.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0378-4274(02)00084-X | title = Arsenic toxicity and potential mechanisms of action | year = 2002 | last1 = Hughes | first1 = Michael F | journal = Toxicology Letters | volume = 133 | pages = 1–16 | pmid = 12076506 | issue = 1}}</ref>

===Exposure risks and remediation===
Occupational exposure and [[arsenic poisoning]] may occur in persons working in industries involving the use of inorganic arsenic and its compounds, such as wood preservation, glass production, nonferrous metal alloys, and electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Inorganic arsenic is also found in coke oven emissions associated with the smelter industry.<ref>{{cite web

The ability of arsenic to undergo redox conversion between As(III) and As(V) makes its availability in the environment more abundant. According to Croal, Gralnick, Malasarn and Newman, "[the] understanding [of] what stimulates As(III) oxidation and/or limits As(V) reduction is relevant for [[bioremediation]] of contaminated sites (Croal). The study of chemolithoautotrophic As(III) oxidizers and the heterotrophic As(V) reducers can help the understanding of the oxidation and/or reduction of arsenic.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Genetics of Geochemisty|journal=Annual Review of Genetics |volume=38 |year=2004 |pages=175–206|pmid=15568975 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.38.072902.091138|last1=Croal|first1=Laura R. |last2=Gralnick |first2=Jeffrey A. |last3=Malasarn |first3=Davin |last4=Newman |first4=Dianne K.}}</ref> It has been proposed that As (III) which is more toxic than Arsenic (V) can be removed from the ground water using baker's yeast ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Bioremediation of Arsenic (III) from Water Using Baker Yeast Sacchromyces cerevisiae.|journal=International Journal of Environmental Bioremediation & Biodegradation |volume=1 |year=2013 |pages=14–19|doi=10.12691/ijebb-1-1-3 |last1=Roy|first1=Debarshi |last2=Gaur |first2=Priya |last3=Verma |first3=Neeraj |last4=Pathireddy |first4=Monika |last5=Singh |first5=Krishna.P.}}</ref>

===Treatment===
Treatment of chronic arsenic poisoning is easily accomplished. British anti-lewisite ([[dimercaprol]]) is prescribed in doses of 5&nbsp;mg/kg up to 300&nbsp;mg every 4&nbsp;hours for the first day, then every 6&nbsp;hours for the second day, and finally every 8&nbsp;hours for 8 additional days.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Psychiatric, Psychogenic ans Somatopsychic Disorders Handbook|isbn=0-87488-596-5 |location=New Hyde Park, NY|publisher=Medical Examination Publishing Co |year=1978 |pages=81–82}}</ref> However the USA's [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR) states that the long-term effects of arsenic exposure cannot be predicted.<ref name="atsdr.cdc.gov"/> Blood, urine, hair, and nails may be tested for arsenic; however, these tests cannot foresee possible health outcomes from the exposure.<ref name="atsdr.cdc.gov"/> Excretion occurs in the urine and long-term exposure to arsenic has been linked to bladder and kidney cancer in addition to cancer of the liver, prostate, skin, lungs, and nasal cavity.<ref>[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxguides/toxguide-2.pdf?id=21&tid=3 The Tox Guide for Arsenic] (2007).
