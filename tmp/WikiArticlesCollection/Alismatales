'''Alismatales''' is an order of [[flowering plant]]s including about 4500 species. Plants assigned to this order are mostly tropical or aquatic.

==Description==
Alismatales comprise [[herbaceous]] flowering plants of aquatic and marshy habitats, and the only monocots known to have green [[embryo]]s other than the [[Amaryllidaceae]]. They also include the only marine angiosperms.<ref>[http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/welcome.html -Angiosperm Phylogeny Website]</ref> The [[flower]]s are usually arranged in [[inflorescence]]s, and the mature seeds lack [[endosperm]].

Both marine and freshwater forms include those with staminate flowers that detach from the parent plant and float to the surface where they become pollinated. In others,  pollination occurs underwater where pollen may form elongated strands, increasing chance of success. Most aquatic species have a totally submerged juvenile phase, and flowers are either floating or emergent. Vegetation may be totally submersed, have floating leaves, or protrude from the water. Collectively they are commonly known as "water plantain".<ref>[http://www.eeb.uconn.edu/people/les/Manuscript_Files/Encyclopedia_Life_Sciences.pdf  -Alismatales (Water Plantains)]</ref>

==Classification==
As understood, the order contains about 165 genera in 13 families, with a [[cosmopolitan distribution]].

===APG===
The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system ([[APG system|APG]]) of 1998 and [[APG II system|APG II]] (2003) assigned the Alismatales to the [[monocots]], which may be thought of as an unranked clade containing the families listed below. The biggest departure from [[list of systems of plant taxonomy|earlier systems]] (see below) is the inclusion of family [[Araceae]]. By its inclusion the order has grown enormously in number of species. The family Araceae alone accounts for about a hundred genera, totaling over two thousand species. The rest of the families together contain only about five hundred species.
* order Alismatales  APG-III
*: family [[Alismataceae]] (''including'' [[Limnocharitaceae]])
*: family [[Aponogetonaceae]]
*: family [[Araceae]]
*: family [[Butomus|Butomaceae]] <!-- monogeneric family -->

*: family [[Posidoniaceae]]
*: family [[Potamogetonaceae]]
*: family [[Ruppiaceae]]
*: family [[Scheuchzeriaceae]]
*: family [[Tofieldiaceae]]
*: family [[Zosteraceae]]

The [[APG III system]] (2009) differs only in that the [[Limnocharitaceae]] are combined with the [[Alismataceae]]; it was also suggested that the genus ''[[Maundia]]'' (of the [[Juncaginaceae]]) could be separated into a monogeneric family, [[Maundiaceae]], but the authors noted that more study was necessary before Maundiaceae could be recognized.<ref name="apgiii" />

===Earlier systems===
The [[Cronquist system]] (1981) places the Alismatales in subclass [[Alismatidae]], class [[Liliopsida]] [= monocotyledons] and includes only three families as shown:
* [[Alismataceae]]
* [[Butomaceae]]
* [[Limnocharitaceae]]
Cronquist's subclass [[Alismatidae]] conformed fairly closely to the order Alismatales as defined by APG, minus the Araceae.

The [[Dahlgren system]] places the Alismatales in the superorder [[Alismatanae]] in the subclass [[Liliidae]] [= monocotyledons] in the class [[Magnoliopsida]] [= angiosperms] with the following families included:
*  [[Alismataceae]]
*  [[Aponogetonaceae]]
*  [[Butomaceae]]
*  [[Hydrocharitaceae]]
*  [[Limnocharitaceae]]

In Tahktajan's classification (1997), the Order Alismatales contains only the Alismataceae and Limnocharitaceae making it equivalent to the Alismataceae as revised in APG-III. Other families included in the Alismatates as currently defined are here distributed among ten additional orders, all of which are assigned, with the following exception, to the Subclass Alismatidae. Araceae in Tahktajan 1997 is assigned to the [[Arales]] and placed in the Subclass Aridae; Tofieldiaceae to the Melanthiales and placed in the [[Liliidae]].<ref>[http://botany.csdl.tamu.edu/FLORA/newgate/cronang.htm -Flowering Plant Gateway]</ref>
