'''''Coronation Street''''' is a British television [[soap opera]] that was first broadcast on [[Granada Television]] on 9 December 1960. It was soon [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] on other [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] franchises. The programme concerns the lives of the residents of Coronation Street in [[Weatherfield]], a fictional town located in [[Greater Manchester]] and based on the area of [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a365197/coronation-street-writer-defends-salford-references.html |title='Coronation Street' writer defends Salford references - Coronation Street News - Soaps |publisher=Digital Spy |date=11 February 2012 |accessdate=27 November 2013}}</ref> Life for the residents centres on its [[Terraced house|terraced]] houses, cafe, corner shop, newsagents, textile factory and the [[Rovers Return Inn|Rovers Return]] [[public house|pub]].

The programme was devised in 1960 by local [[Screenwriter|scriptwriter]] [[Tony Warren]] at the recently formed [[Granada Television]] in [[Manchester]]. Warren's initial [[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink drama]] proposal was rejected by the station's founder [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]] but he was persuaded by producer [[Harry Elton]] to produce the programme for thirteen [[Television pilot|pilot]] episodes. It was first broadcast on 9 December 1960 and within six months had become the most-watched programme on British television. It has been one of the most financially lucrative programmes on British commercial television, underpinning the success of the Granada Television franchise and the broadcaster ITV. ''Coronation Street'' is ITV's longest running and most popular programme, attracting on average between eight and ten million viewers per episode, almost 53 years after it was first broadcast.

''Coronation Street'' is made by [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]] at [[Granada Studios]] in [[Manchester]]. It is shown in all ITV regions as well as internationally. On 17 September 2010, it became the world's longest-running TV soap opera in production.<ref name="Hemley">{{Cite news|title=Coronation Street breaks two world records|first=Matthew|last=Hemley|work=The Stage|date=24 September 2010|accessdate=26 September 2010|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/29700/coronation-street-breaks-two-world-records}}</ref> ''Coronation Street'' is noted for its depiction of a down-to-earth [[working class]] community combined with light-hearted [[Humour in Coronation Street|humour]] and strong characters.<ref>Little, Daran (1998).

== History ==

=== 1960s ===
[[File:Ken Barlow (1960) (small).jpg|thumb|left|[[Ken Barlow (Coronation Street)|Ken Barlow]] in the first episode of ''Coronation Street'']]
The [[Coronation Street: The First Episode|first episode]] was aired on 9 December 1960 and was not initially a critical success; ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' columnist Ken Iriwin claimed the series would only last three weeks. Granada Television initially commissioned only 13 episodes and some inside the company doubted the show would last beyond its planned production run.<ref>Little. (1995) p.10.</ref> Despite the criticism, viewers were immediately drawn to the serial, won over by ''Coronation Street'''s 'ordinary' characters.<ref>Little. (1995) p.26.</ref> The programme also made use of [[Northern English]] language and [[dialect]]; affectionate local terms like "eh, chuck?", "nowt" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|aʊ|t}}, means ''nothing''), and "by 'eck!" became widely heard on British television for the first time.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jeffrey |last=Miller |editor=Graham Nown |title=Street Talk: The Language of Coronation Street |publisher=[[Ward Lock]]|year=1986 |location=London|isbn= 978-0-7063-6514-6}}</ref>

Early episodes told the story of student [[Ken Barlow (Coronation Street)|Kenneth Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]), who had won a place at university and thus found his working-class background something of an embarrassment.<ref>TV Times. (1960) p.8.</ref> The character was one of the few to have experienced life 'outside' of ''Coronation Street'', and in some ways predicts the growth of [[globalisation]] and the decline of similar communities. In a 1961 episode, Barlow declares: "You can't go on just thinking about your own street these days. We're living with people on the other side of the world. There's more to worry about than [[Elsie Tanner]] and her boyfriends."<ref>{{cite video | people = Granada Television | title =Coronation Street 1961 | medium = Television serial drama  | publisher = Granada | location =Quay Street, Manchester | date =8 November 1961 }}</ref> Roache was the only remaining member of the original cast until [[Dennis Tanner]] ([[Philip Lowrie]]) returned on 12  May 2011, and is currently the longest-serving actor in ''Coronation Street'' and in British and global soap overall.

Also at the centre of many early stories was [[Ena Sharples]] ([[Violet Carson]]), caretaker of the Glad Tidings Mission Hall, and her friends: timid [[Minnie Caldwell]] ([[Margot Bryant]]) and bespectacled [[Martha Longhurst]] ([[Lynne Carol]]). The trio were likened to the [[Greek chorus]], and the [[Weird Sisters|three witches]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', as they would sit in the [[The snug|snug bar]] of the [[Rovers Return Inn|Rovers Return]], passing judgement over family, neighbours and frequently each other.<ref>Tinker. p.31.</ref> Headstrong Ena often clashed with Elsie Tanner, whom she believed espoused a dauntlessly loose set of morals. Elsie resented Ena's interference and gossip, which most of the time had little basis in reality.

In April 1961, [[Jed Stone]] made his first appearance and returned the following year in 1962. He left in 1963, but returned 3 years later in 1966. He left again and then returned 42 years later in 2008.

In March 1961, ''Coronation Street'' reached No.1 in the [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|television ratings]] and remained there for the rest of the year.<ref name="littlepg10"/> Earlier in 1961, a Television Audience Measurement (TAM) showed that 75% of available viewers (15 million) tuned into ''Corrie'' and by 1964 the programme had over 20 million regular viewers, with ratings peaking on 2 December 1964, at 21.36 million viewers.<ref>Little. (1995) p.35.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=BFI Most Watched 1960s|work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1960s.html|accessdate=29 January 2007}}</ref>

Storylines throughout the decade included: a mystery poison-pen letter received by Elsie Tanner, the 1962 marriage of Ken Barlow and [[Valerie Barlow|Valerie Tatlock]], [[Storylines of Coronation Street#Killing of Martha Longhurst|the death of Martha Longhurst]] in 1964, the birth of the Barlow twins in 1965, Elsie Tanner's wedding to Steve Tanner as well as a train crashing from the viaduct (both in 1967), the murder of Steve Tanner in 1968, and a coach crash in 1969.

In spite of rising popularity with viewers, ''Coronation Street'' was criticised by some for its outdated portrayal of the urban [[working class]], and its representation of a community that was a [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] fantasy.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert C| last=Allen|title=Soap Opera|work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/soapopera/soapopera.htm|accessdate=7 January 2007}}</ref> After the first episode in 1960, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' printed: "The programme is doomed from the outset&nbsp;... For there is little reality in this new serial, which apparently, we have to suffer twice a week."<ref>Tinker. pp.12–13.</ref> By 1967, critics were suggesting that the programme no longer reflected life in 1960s Britain, but reflected how life was in the ''1950s''. Granada hurried to update the programme, with the hope of introducing more issue-driven stories, including [[Lucille Hewitt]] becoming addicted to [[drugs]], [[Jerry Booth (Coronation Street)|Jerry Booth]] being in a storyline about [[homosexuality]], [[Emily Nugent]] having an out of wedlock child, and introducing a black family, but all of these ideas were dropped for fear of upsetting viewers.<ref>Little. (2000) p.45.</ref>

=== 1970s ===
The show's [[production team]] was tested when many core cast members left the programme in the early 1970s. When [[Arthur Leslie]] died suddenly in 1970, his character, Rovers' landlord Jack Walker, died with him.<ref>Little. (2000) p.67.</ref> [[Anne Reid]] quit as Valerie Barlow, and was killed off in 1971, electrocuting herself with a faulty hairdryer.<ref name="littlepg73"/> Ratings reached a low of 8 million in February 1973, [[Pat Phoenix]] quit as [[Elsie Tanner]], [[Violet Carson]] ([[Ena Sharples]]) was written out for most of the year due to illness, and [[Doris Speed]] ([[Annie Walker]]) took two months' leave.<ref name="littlepg86">Little. (2000) p.86.</ref> ITV's other flagship soap opera ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' saw a marked increase in viewers at this time, as its established cast, such as Meg Richardson ([[Noele Gordon]]), grew in popularity.<ref name="littlepg86"/> These sudden departures forced the writing team to quickly develop characters who had previously stood in the background. The roles of [[Bet Lynch]], [[Ivy Tilsley]] ([[Lynne Perrie]]), [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Hunt]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]), [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Littlewood]] ([[Barbara Knox]]) and [[Mavis Wilton|Mavis Riley]] ([[Thelma Barlow]]) were built up between 1972 and 1973 with characters such as [[Gail Platt|Gail Potter]] ([[Helen Worth]]), [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Patricia Cutts]] and [[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]) and [[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Elizabeth Dawn]]) first appearing in 1974. These characters would remain at the centre of the programme for many years.<ref name = "fsobxi">Little. (2000) p.93.</ref><ref>Little. (2000) p.79.</ref>

Comic storylines had been popular in the series in the 1960s but had become sparse during the early 1970s. These were re-introduced by new producer [[Bill Podmore]] who joined the series in 1976. He had worked on Granada comedy productions prior to his appointment.<ref>Little. (2000) p.107.</ref> Stan and Hilda Ogden were often at the centre of overtly funny storylines, with other comic characters including [[Eddie Yeats]] ([[Geoffrey Hughes]]), [[Fred Gee]] ([[Fred Feast]]) and [[Jack Duckworth]] ([[William Tarmey]]) all making their first appearances during the decade.

In 1976, Pat Phoenix returned to her role as Elsie Tanner and, after a spate of ill health, Violet Carson returned on a more regular basis as Ena.<ref>Little. (1995) p.131.</ref> ''Coronation Street's'' stalwart cast slotted back into the programme alongside the newcomers, examining new relationships between characters of different ages and backgrounds: Eddie Yeats became the Ogdens' lodger, Gail Potter and [[Suzie Birchall]] moved in with Elsie, [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) arrived in 1976 as the tough factory boss, and Annie Walker reigned at the Rovers with her trio of staff Bet Lynch, [[Betty Williams (Coronation Street)|Betty Turpin]] and Fred Gee.

Storylines throughout the decade included: a warehouse fire in 1975, the birth of [[Tracy Barlow|Tracy Langton]] in 1977, the murder of [[Ernest Bishop]] in 1978, a lorry crashing into the Rovers Return in 1979, and the marriage of [[Brian Tilsley]] and Gail Potter (also in 1979).

For eleven weeks, between August and October 1979, [[industrial action]] forced ''Coronation Street'' and the whole of the ITV network (apart from the [[Channel Islands]]) off the air. When ITV did return, its first evening schedule included a special "catch-up" edition of ''Coronation Street'', in which storylines which would have taken place during the strike were explained away in the form of a narrative chat between Len Fairclough and Bet Lynch. For several weeks the channel had very few fresh episodes to show, and episodes of the game show [[3-2-1]] were screened in its place. ''Coronation Street'' returned to ITV screens at a regular time late in 1979.

''Coronation Street'' had little competition within its prime time slot, and certain critics suggested that the programme had grown complacent, moving away from socially viable storylines and again presenting a dated view of working class life.<ref>Liddement. (2004)</ref>

=== 1980s ===
Between 1980 and 1989, ''Coronation Street'' underwent some of the biggest changes since its launch. By May 1984, Ken Barlow stood as the only original [[cast member]], after the departures of Ena Sharples (in 1980), Annie Walker (in 1983), Elsie Tanner (in 1984) and [[Albert Tatlock]] (also 1984).<ref>Little. (2000) p.134. and pp.153–59.</ref> In 1983, [[antihero]] [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson]]), one of the show's central male characters since 1961, was killed off, and in 1984, Stan Ogden (Bernard Youens) died.<ref>Little. (2000) pp.153–59.</ref> While the press predicted the end of ''Corrie'', H. V. Kershaw declared that "There are no stars in ''Coronation Street''."<ref>Tinker. p.62.</ref> Writers drew on the show's many archetypes, with previously established characters stepping into the roles left by the original cast.<ref name="little172">Little. (1995) p.172.</ref> [[Phyllis Pearce]] (Jill Summers) was hailed as the new Ena Sharples in 1982, the Duckworths moved into No.9 in 1983 and slipped into the role once held by the Ogdens, while Percy Sugden ([[Bill Waddington]]) appeared in 1983 and took over the grumpy war veteran role from Albert Tatlock.<ref>Little. (1995) p.162.</ref><ref>Little. (1995) p.171.</ref> The question of who would take over the Rovers Return after Annie Walker's 1983 exit was answered in 1985 when Bet Lynch (who also mirrored the vulnerability and strength of Elsie Tanner) was installed as landlady. In 1983, Shirley Armitage became the first major black character in her role as machinist at Baldwin's Casuals.<ref name="little172"/>

Ken Barlow married Deirdre Langton on 27 July 1981. The episode was watched by over 24 million viewers&nbsp;– more ITV viewers than the wedding of [[Prince Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana]] two days later.<ref>{{cite web|work=Icons&nbsp;– a portrait of England|title=Soaps through the decades |url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/the-archers/features/soaps-a-history|accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref> The 1980s also saw the cementing of relationships between established characters: [[Alf Roberts]] ([[Bryan Mosley]]) married [[Audrey Roberts|Audrey Potter]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) in 1985, [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) married [[Sally Webster|Sally Seddon]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]) in 1986.<ref>Little. (1995) p.174, pp.182–83.</ref> Bet Lynch married [[Alec Gilroy]] in 1987 and the marriages of Ivy Tilsley and [[Don Brennan (Coronation Street character)|Don Brennan]], and [[Derek Wilton]] and Mavis Riley took place in 1988.<ref>Little. (1995) pp.184, 189.</ref>

The arrival of [[Channel 4]] and its edgy new soap opera ''[[Brookside]]'' in 1982 was one of the biggest changes for ''Coronation Street''. Unlike ''Coronation Street'' which had a very nostalgic view of working-class life, ''Brookside'' brought together working and middle-class families in a more contemporary environment. The dialogue often included expletives and the stories were more hard-hitting and of the current Zeitgeist. Whereas stories at this time in ''Coronation Street'' were largely about family affairs, ''Brookside'' concentrated on social affairs such as [[industrial action]], [[unemployment]] and the [[black market]]. The BBC also introduced a new prime time soap opera, ''[[EastEnders]]'' in 1985.<ref name="littlepg165">Little. (2000) p.165.</ref> Like ''Brookside'', ''EastEnders'' had a more gritty premise than ''Coronation Street'', although unlike ''Brookside'' it tended to steer clear of blue language and politicised stories.

While ratings for ''Coronation Street'' remained consistent throughout the decade, ''EastEnders'' regularly obtained higher viewing figures.<ref>Little. (2000) p.170.</ref> With prime time competition, ''Corrie'' was again seen as being old fashioned, with the introduction of the 'normal' Clayton family in 1985 being a failure with viewers.<ref name="littlepg165" /> Between 1988 and 1989, many aspects of the show were modernised by new producer [[David Liddiment]]. A new exterior set had been built in 1982 and in 1989 it was redeveloped to include new houses and shops. Production techniques were also changed, with a new studio being built and the inclusion of more location filming, which had moved from being shot on film to [[videotape]] in 1988.<ref name="littlepg188">Little. (2000) p.188.</ref> New pressures also saw introduction of the third weekly episode on 20 October 1989, broadcast each Friday at 19:30.<ref name="littlepg188"/>

The 1980s featured some of the most prominent storylines in the programme's history, such as [[Deirdre Barlow]]'s affair with Mike Baldwin in 1983, the first soap storyline to receive widespread media attention.<ref>Little. (1995) p.165.</ref> The feud between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin would continue for many years, with Mike even marrying Ken's daughter, Susan. In 1986, there was a fire at the Rovers Return, which attracted an audience of just under 27 million, and between 1986 and 1989, the story of [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Fairclough]]'s [[psychological abuse]] at the hands of [[Alan Bradley (Coronation Street)|Alan Bradley]] ([[Mark Eden]]), and his subsequent death under the wheels of a [[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool tram]], was played out. The episode where Alan met his death under the tram gave ''Coronation Street'' its highest ever viewing figures of 26.9 million, and is still the 9th most watched UK broadcast of all time. Other stories included: the birth of [[Nick Tilsley|Nicky Tilsley]] in 1980, Elsie Tanner's departure and Stan Ogden's funeral in 1984, the birth of [[Sarah Platt|Sarah-Louise Tilsley]] in 1987, and Brian Tilsley's murder in 1989.

New characters were introduced, such as [[Terry Duckworth]] ([[Nigel Pivaro]]), [[Curly Watts]] ([[Kevin Kennedy (actor)|Kevin Kennedy]]), [[Martin Platt]] ([[Sean Wilson (actor)|Sean Wilson]]), [[Reg Holdsworth]] ([[Ken Morley]]) and the McDonald family; one of whom, [[Simon Gregson]], started on the show as [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve McDonald]] a week after his 15th birthday, and has been in the programme ever since.

=== 1990s ===
In spite of updated sets and production changes, ''Coronation Street'' still received criticism. In 1992, chairman of the [[Ofcom|Broadcasting Standards Council]], [[Lord Rees-Mogg]], criticised the low-representation of [[minority group|ethnic minorities]] and the programme's portrayal of the cosy familiarity of a bygone era. Some newspapers ran headlines such as "''Coronation Street'' shuts out blacks" (''[[The Times]]'') and "'Put colour in t'Street" (''Daily Mirror'').<ref>Little. (1995) p.217.</ref> Patrick Stoddart of ''The Times'' wrote: "The millions who watch ''Coronation Street''&nbsp;– and who will continue to do so despite Lord Rees-Mogg&nbsp;– know real life when they see it&nbsp;... in the most confident and accomplished soap opera television has ever seen".<ref>Little. (2000) p.205.</ref>'' Black and Asian characters had appeared, but it was not until 1999 that the show featured its first regular non-white family, the Desai family.

New characters [[Des Barnes|Des]] and Steph Barnes moved into one of the new houses in 1990, being dubbed by the media as '[[Yuppie]]s'.<ref>Little. (2000) p.194.</ref> [[Raquel Watts|Raquel Wolstenhulme]] ([[Sarah Lancashire]]) first appeared in 1991 and went on to become one of the most popular characters. The McDonald family were developed and the fiery relationships between [[Liz McDonald|Liz]], [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim]], [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve]] and [[Andy McDonald (Coronation Street)|Andy]] interested viewers.<ref>Little. (2000) p.199.</ref><ref>Little. (1995) p.211.</ref> Other newcomers were [[Maud Grimes]] ([[Elizabeth Bradley]]), [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]), Judy and Gary Mallett, [[Fred Elliott|Fred Elliot]] ([[John Savident]]) and [[Ashley Peacock]] ([[Steven Arnold]]). The amount of [[slapstick]] and physical humour in storylines increased during the 1990s, with comic characters such as Reg Holdsworth and his water bed.<ref>Little. (1995) p.220.</ref>

Storylines in the early part of the decade included: the death of newborn Katie McDonald in 1992, Mike Baldwin's wedding to Alma Sedgewick ([[Amanda Barrie]]) in 1992, [[Tommy Duckworth]] being sold by his father Terry in 1993, Deirdre Barlow's marriage to Moroccan Samir Rachid, and the rise of [[Tanya Pooley]] ([[Eva Pope]]) between 1993 and 1994.

Key character Bet Lynch departed in 1995 when her portrayer Julie Goodyear decided to leave. Bet would subsequently make brief return appearances in 1999, 2002 and 2003.

In 1997, Brian Park took over as producer, with the idea of promoting young characters as opposed to the older cast. On his first day he axed the characters of [[Derek Wilton]], [[Don Brennan (Coronation Street Character)|Don Brennan]], [[Percy Sugden]], [[Bill Webster]], Billy Williams and [[Maureen Holdsworth]].<ref name="littlepg235">Little. (2000) p.235.</ref> [[Thelma Barlow]], who played Derek's wife Mavis, was angered by the sacking of her co-star and resigned, while the production team also lost some of its key writers when Barry Hill, Adele Rose and Julian Roach all resigned.<ref name="littlepg235"/>

In line with Park's suggestion, younger characters were introduced: Nick Tilsley was recast, played by [[Adam Rickitt]], [[single parent|single mother]] [[Zoe Tattersall]] ([[Joanne Froggatt]]) first appeared, and the Battersbys moved into No.5. Storylines focussed on tackling 'issues', such as [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealers]], eco-warriors, religious cults and a transsexual woman.<ref name="little241">Little. (2000) p.241.</ref> Park quit in 1998, after deciding that he had done what he intended to do; he maintained that his biggest achievement was the introduction of [[Hayley Cropper|Hayley Patterson]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]), the first [[transsexual]] character in a British soap.<ref name="little241"/>

Some viewers were alienated by the new-look ''Coronation Street'', and the sections of the media voiced their disapproval. Having received criticism of being too out of touch, ''Corrie'' now struggled to emulate the more modern ''Brookside'' and ''EastEnders''. In the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', [[Victor Lewis-Smith]] wrote: "Apparently it doesn't matter that this is a first-class soap opera, superbly scripted and flawlessly performed by a seasoned repertory company."<ref name="littlepg235"/>

One of ''Coronation Street'''s best known storylines took place in March/April 1998, with [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Rachid]] being wrongfully imprisoned after a relationship with con-man Jon Lindsay. 19 million viewers watched Deirdre being sent to prison, and 'Free the Weatherfield One' campaigns sprung up in a media frenzy.<ref name="little241"/> The then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] even passed comment on Deirdre's sentencing in Parliament.<ref>{{cite news|title=PM supports Weatherfield One|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/71934.stm|date=31 March 1998|accessdate=7 January 2007}}</ref> Deirdre was freed after three weeks, with Granada stating that they had always intended for her to be released, in spite of the media interest.<ref name="little241"/>

=== 2000s ===
On 8 December 2000, the show celebrated its fortieth year by broadcasting a live, hour-long [[Coronation Street: 40th anniversary live episode|episode]]. [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]] appeared as himself in an [[ITV News]] bulletin report.<ref name="prince">{{cite news | work=BBC News| title= Prince stars in live soap |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1061585.stm| accessdate=2 September 2006 | date=8 December 2000}}</ref> Earlier in the year, 13-year-old [[Sarah-Louise Platt]] ([[Tina O'Brien]]) had become pregnant and given birth to a baby girl, [[Bethany Platt|Bethany]], on 4 June. The episode where [[Gail Platt|Gail]] was told of her daughter's pregnancy was watched by 15 million viewers.<ref name="littlepg256">Little. (2000) p.256.</ref> In September 2000, Mike Baldwin married Linda Sykes but shortly afterwards, his drunken son Mark confessed he and Linda had been having an affair behind his dad's back. The episode attracted an audience of 16.8 million and in the 2001 [[British Soap Awards]] won Best Storyline.

From 1999 to 2001, issue-led storylines were introduced such as [[Toyah Battersby]]'s rape, Roy and Hayley Cropper abducting their [[foster care|foster child]], Sarah Platt's [[Chat room|Internet chat room]] abduction and [[Alma Baldwin|Alma Halliwell]]'s death of [[cervical cancer]].<ref name=CNProd>{{cite web|title=Coronation Street Producer|publisher= Corrie.net |url=http://www.corrie.net/profiles/staff/producers.html|accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref> Such storylines were unpopular with viewers and ratings dropped and in October 2001, Macnaught was abruptly moved to another Granada department and Carolyn Reynolds took over. ''Corrie'' continued to struggle in the ratings, with ''EastEnders'' introducing some of its strongest stories. In 2002, Kieran Roberts was appointed as producer and aimed to re-introduce "gentle storylines and humour", after deciding that ''the Street'' should not try to compete with other soaps.<ref name=CNProd/> In 2002, Gail Platt married [[Richard Hillman]] ([[Brian Capron]]), a [[financial adviser|financial advisor]], who would go on to leave [[Duggie Ferguson]] to die, murder his ex-wife Patricia, attempt to murder his [[mother-in-law]], Audrey Roberts, murder [[Maxine Peacock]] and attempt to murder [[Emily Bishop]].

[[File:Coronation street cast photo 1960.jpg|thumb|250px|Cast of ''Coronation Street'', 1960]]

Since 1960, ''Coronation Street'' has featured many characters whose popularity with viewers and critics has differed greatly. The original cast was created by Tony Warren, with the characters of [[Ena Sharples]] ([[Violet Carson]]), [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Patricia Phoenix]]) and [[Annie Walker]] ([[Doris Speed]]) as central figures.<ref>Little. (1995) p.7.</ref> These three women remained with the show for 20 years or more, and became [[archetypes]] of British soap opera, often being emulated by other serials. Ena was the street's busybody, battleaxe and self-proclaimed moral voice.<ref>Tinker. p.38.</ref> Elsie was the [[Hooker with a heart of gold|tart with a heart]], who was constantly hurt by men in the search for true love.<ref>Tinker. p.57.</ref> Annie Walker, landlady of the [[Rovers Return Inn]], had [[delusions of grandeur]] and saw herself as better than other residents of ''Coronation Street''.<ref>Tinker. p.40.</ref>

''Coronation Street'' became known for the portrayal of strong female characters,<ref>Geraghty, Christine. ''Women and Soap Opera'', Polity Press, London, 1991. (ISBN 978-0-7456-0568-5)</ref> with characters like [[Sharples]], Walker and Tanner, and [[Hilda Ogden]], becoming household names during the 1960s.<ref>Little. (2000) p.5.</ref> Warren's programme was largely matriarchal, which some commentators put down to the female-dominant environment in which he grew up.<ref>{{cite web |first = Will |last = Hadcroft |title = Daran Little interview |url = http://www.corrie.net/profiles/interviews/little.html |work = Corrie.net |accessdate =22 February 2007}}</ref> Consequently, the show has a long tradition of psychologically abused husbands, most famously [[Stan Ogden]] and [[Jack Duckworth]], husbands of Hilda and Vera, respectively.

[[File:Coronation street 50th anniversary 2010 cast photo.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Cast at the 50th Anniversary of ''Coronation Street'', 2010]]
[[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]) entered the storyline as a young radical, reflecting the youth of 1960s Britain, where figures like [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and the model [[Twiggy]] were to reshape the concept of youthful rebellion. Though the rest of the original Barlow family were killed off, Ken, who for 27 years was the only character from the first episode remaining, has remained the constant link throughout the entire series. In 2011, [[Dennis Tanner]] ([[Philip Lowrie]]), another character from the first episode, returned to ''Coronation Street'' after a 43-year absence.

[[Stan Ogden]] and [[Hilda Ogden]] were introduced in 1964, with Hilda ([[Jean Alexander]]) becoming one of the most famous British soap characters of all time. In a 1982 poll, she was voted fourth most recognisable woman in Britain, after [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana]], [[Princess of Wales]].<ref>Little. (1995) p.188.</ref> Hilda's best-known attributes were her [[pinny]], hair curlers, and the "muriel" in her [[living room]] with three "flying" duck ornaments. Hilda Ogden's final episode on Christmas Day 1987, remains the highest-rated episode of ''Coronation Street'' ever, with nearly 27 million viewers.<ref>{{cite news |first = Dennis |last = Barker |title = Obituary: Leslie Duxbury |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1635800,00.html |work = The Guardian |date = 7 November 2005 |accessdate =2 September 2006 |location=London}}</ref>

[[Bet Lynch]] ([[Julie Goodyear]]) first appeared in 1966, before becoming a regular in 1970, and went on to become one of the most famous ''Corrie'' characters.<ref>Little. (2000) p.66.</ref> Bet stood as the central character of the show from 1985 until departing in 1995, often being dubbed as "Queen of the Street" by the media, and indeed herself. The character briefly returned in June 2002.<ref>{{cite web |title = Queen Of The Street The Amazing Life Of Julie Goodyear |url = http://www.alkenmrs.com/soapsrus/coronationstreet/csqueenstreet.html|work = Alken M R S |accessdate =9 March 2007}}</ref>

''Coronation Street'' and its characters often rely heavily on archetypes, with the characterisation of some of its current cast based loosely on past characters. [[Phyllis Pearce]], [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]])and [[Sylvia Goodwin]] embodied the role of the acid-tongued busybody originally held by Ena Sharples, [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]) has grown snobbish, like Annie Walker, and a number of the programme's female characters mirror the vulnerability of [[Elsie Tanner]] and [[Bet Lynch]]. Other recurring archetypes include the war veteran ([[Albert Tatlock]], [[Percy Sugden]] and [[Gary Windass]]), the bumbling retail manager ([[Leonard Swindley]], [[Reg Holdsworth]], [[Norris Cole]]), quick-tempered toughmen ([[Len Fairclough]], [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim McDonald]], [[Tommy Harris (Coronation Street)|Tommy Harris]] and [[Owen Armstrong]]), and the perennial losers ([[Stan Ogden|Stan]] and [[Hilda Ogden]], [[Jack Duckworth|Jack]] and [[Vera Duckworth]], [[Les Battersby-Brown]], [[Beth Tinker]] and [[Kirk Sutherland]]).<ref>{{cite video | people = David Liddiment | title =How Soaps Changed the World | medium = Television Documentary | publisher = Channel 4| date = 17 July 2004 }}</ref> The show's former archivist and scriptwriter [[Daran Little]] disagreed with the characterisation of the show as a collection of stereotypes. "Rather, remember that [[Elsie Tanner|Elsie]], [[Ena Sharples|Ena]] and Co. were the first of their kind ever seen on British television. If later characters are stereotypes, it's because they are from the same original mould. It is the hundreds of programmes that have followed which have copied ''Coronation Street''."<ref name="littlepg7">Little. (1998) p.7.</ref>

== Production ==

=== Broadcast format ===
Between 9 December 1960 and 3 March 1961, ''Coronation Street'' was broadcast twice weekly, on Wednesday and Friday.<ref name="littlepg10"/> During this period, the Friday episode was broadcast live, with the Wednesday episode being pre-recorded 15&nbsp;minutes later.<ref name = "xvvlbv">Kershaw. p.30.</ref> When the programme went fully networked on 6 March 1961, broadcast days changed to Monday and Wednesday.<ref name="littlepg10">Little. (2000) p.10.</ref> The last regular episode to be shown live was broadcast on 3 February 1961.

The series was transmitted in black and white for the majority of the 1960s. Preparations were made to film episode 923, to be transmitted Wednesday 29 October 1969, in colour. This instalment featured the street's residents on a coach trip to the Lake District. In the event suitable colour film stock for the cameras could not be found and the footage was shot in black and white. The following episode, transmitted Monday 3 November, was videotaped in colour but featured black and white film inserts and title sequence. Like [[BBC1]], the ITV network was officially broadcast in black and white at this point (though programmes were actually broadcast in colour as early as July that year for colour transmission testing and adjustment) so the episode was seen by most in black and white.

Daran Little, for many years the official programme archivist, claims that the first episode to be transmitted in colour was episode 930 shown on 24 November 1969.<ref>Little. (2000) p.58.</ref> The ITV network, like [[BBC1]], began full colour transmissions on 15 November 1969 and it is therefore possible that the first transmitted colour episode is number 928 shown on 17 November.

In October 1970 a technician's dispute turned into a [[work-to-rule]] when sound staff were denied a pay rise given to camera staff the year before for working with colour recording equipment . The terms of the work-to-rule were that staff refused to work with the new equipment (though the old black and white equipment had been disposed of by then) and therefore programmes were recorded and transmitted in black and white, including ''Coronation Street''<ref>Richard Marson. "Inside Updown&nbsp;– the story of "Upstairs Downstairs". Kaleidoscope publishing 2001. p.50.</ref> The dispute was resolved in early 1971 and the last black and white episode was broadcast on 8 February 1971.

Episode 5191, originally broadcast on 7 January 2002, was the first to be broadcast in [[16:9]] widescreen format. ''Coronation Street'' was the last British soap to make the switch to 16:9 (''[[Take the High Road]]'' remained in [[4:3]] until it finished in 2003).

From 22 March 2010, ''Coronation Street'' was produced in 1080/50i for transmission on HDTV platforms on [[ITV HD]]. First transmission in this format was episode 7351 on 31 May 2010 with a new set of titles and re-recorded theme tune. On 26 May 2010 ITV previewed the new HD titles on the ''Coronation Street'' website. Due to copyright reasons only viewers residing in the UK could see them on the ITV site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/s3/coronation-street/news/a219473/coronation-street-to-join-itv1-hd.html |title='Coronation Street' to join ITV1 HD |publisher=Digital Spy |date=12 May 2010|accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref>

=== Production staff ===
''Coronation Street's'' creator, [[Tony Warren]], wrote the first 13 episodes of the programme in 1960, and continued to write for the programme intermittently until 1976.<ref name="top10writers">{{cite web|title=Coronation Street's top ten writers|work=Corrie.net|url=http://www.corrie.net/profiles/staff/writers.html|accessdate=31 December 2006}}</ref> He still retains links with ''Coronation Street'', often advising on storylines.

[[H. V. Kershaw|Harry Kershaw]]<ref>{{cite web|title=H V Kershaw|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0449958/|accessdate=31 December 2006}}</ref> was the script editor for ''Coronation Street'' when the programme began in 1960, working alongside Tony Warren. Kershaw was also a script writer for the programme and the show's producer between 1962 and 1971. He remains the only person, along with John Finch, to have held the three posts of script editor, writer and producer. Kershaw continued to write for the programme until his retirement in January 1988.

[[Adele Rose]] was the longest-serving ''Coronation Street'' writer, completing 455 scripts between 1961 and 1998. She also created ''[[Byker Grove]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Adele Rose|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741220/|accessdate=31 December 2006}}</ref>

[[Bill Podmore]] was the show's longest serving producer. By the time he stepped down in 1988 he had completed 13 years at the production helm. Nicknamed the "godfather" by the tabloid press,<ref>Podmore, p.33.</ref> he was renowned for his tough, uncompromising style and was feared by both crew and cast alike. He is probably most famous for sacking [[Peter Adamson]], the show's Len Fairclough, in 1983.

[[Michael Apted]], best known for the ''[[Up Series|Up!]]'' series of documentaries was a director on the programme in the early 1960s. This period of his career marked the first of his many collaborations with writer [[Jack Rosenthal]]. Rosenthal, noted for such television plays as ''[[Bar Mitzvah Boy]]'', began his career on the show, writing over 150 episodes between 1961 and 1969.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jack Rosenthal|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0742768/#writer1960|accessdate=31 December 2006}}</ref> [[Paul Abbott]] was a story editor on the programme in the 1980s and began writing episodes in 1989, but left in 1993 to produce ''[[Cracker (British television)|Cracker]]'', for which he later wrote, before creating his own highly acclaimed dramas such as ''[[Touching Evil]]'' and ''[[Shameless (UK TV series)|Shameless]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paul Abbott|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0008036/|accessdate=31 December 2006}}</ref> [[Russell T Davies]] was briefly a storyliner on the programme in the mid-1990s,<ref name=RTDIMDb>{{cite web|title=Russell T Davies|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0203961/|accessdate=31 December 2006}}</ref> also writing the script for the [[direct-to-video]] special "[[Coronation Street: Viva Las Vegas!|Viva Las Vegas!]]"<ref name=RTDIMDb/> He, too, has become a noted writer of his own high-profile television drama programmes, including ''[[Queer as Folk (UK)|Queer as Folk]]'' and the 2005 revival of ''[[Doctor Who]]''.<ref>{{cite web | work=The Gallifrey Archives | title= Russell T Davies |url= http://www.gallifrey.org.uk/russelltdavies.html| accessdate=2 June 2006}}</ref> [[Jimmy McGovern]] also wrote some episodes.<ref>{{cite web |author= Jones, Judith | work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications | title= Coronation street |url= http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/coronationst/coronationst.htm| accessdate=2 September 2006}}</ref>
The current Executive Producer is Kieran Roberts who was once a Producer of "Emmerdale" and the Producer is ex-Doctor Who producer Phil Collinson, who took over from Kim Crowther in summer 2010.

=== Theme music ===
The show's [[theme music]], a [[cornet]] piece, accompanied by a [[Brass band (British style)|brass band]] plus [[clarinet]] and [[double bass]], reminiscent of northern band music, was written by [[Eric Spear]].<ref>Kershaw, p.25.</ref>

The identity of the trumpeter was not public knowledge until 1994, when jazz musician and journalist Ron Simmonds revealed that it was the Surrey musician Ronnie Hunt. He added, "an attempt was made in later years to re-record that solo, using Stan Roderick, but it sounded too good, and they reverted to the old one."<ref>Ron Simmonds, [http://www.jazzprofessional.com/interviews/Stan%20Roderick_3.htm "Stan Roderick&nbsp;– A tribute"], ''Jazz Professional'', 1994</ref> In 2004, the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' published a contradictory story that a young musician from Wilmslow called David Browning played the trumpet on both the original recording of the theme in 1960 and a re-recording in 1964, for a one-off payment of £36.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/127724_just_36_notes_for_corrie_trumpet.html|title=Just 36 notes for Corrie trumpet|work=Manchester Evening News|date=19 August 2004|last=Palmer|first=Carl|publisher=M.E.N.

[[ITV plc|ITV]] then confirmed to the ''Mail'' that a second version had been recorded in the 1970s, but was only used for a very short while before reverting to Hunt's 1960 recording. In the 1980s the same version was converted to [[stereo]].<ref name=MOS-2010-06-21>[http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/mail-on-sunday-london-england-the/mi_8003/is_2009_June_21/brass-warfare-coronation-street-rival/ai_n38243210/ Brass warfare on Coronation Street as rival trumpeters say: I played that solo], ''Mail on Sunday'', 21 June 2009</ref>

Ronnie Hunt said he was paid £6, and found the experience frustrating as Eric Spear insisted on many takes before obtaining the sound that he wanted. After taking a break in a local pub, Hunt achieved the desired mournful sound by playing very close to the microphone.<ref name=MOS-2010-06-21/>

A new, completely re-recorded version of the theme tune replaced the original when the series started broadcasting in HD on 31 May 2010. It accompanied a new montage-style credits sequence featuring images of Manchester and Weatherfield.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/soaps/coronationstreet/news/newopeningtitles/ |title=New Opening Titles|work= Coronation Street&nbsp;— ITV Soaps |publisher=ITV.com |date= |accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref>

The programme currently rates as one of the most watched programmes on UK television for every day it is aired. Viewership peaked on Christmas Day 1987 when an average of 28.5 million viewers tuned in to see Hilda Ogden leave the street to start a new life as a housekeeper for long term friend Dr Lowther (although there is some confusion as to whether or not this was actually the highest rating episode due to a special omnibus repeat of that week's episodes being combined with the original airing). Since EastEnders began in 1985, the two programmes have constantly battled it out for first place in the ratings.

The regular exterior buildings shown in ''Coronation Street'' include a row of terrace houses, several townhouses, and communal areas including a newsagents (''The Kabin''), a cafe (''Roy's Rolls''), a general grocery shop (''D&S Alahan's''), a factory (''Underworld'') and ''Rovers Return Inn'' [[public house]]. The Rovers Return Inn is the main meeting place for the show's characters.<ref name="littlepg73">Little. (2000) p.73.</ref>

Between 1960 and 1968 street scenes were filmed before a set constructed in a studio, with the house fronts reduced in scale to 3/4 and constructed from wood.<ref name="tinkerpg95">Tinker. p.95.</ref> In 1968 Granada built an outside set not all that different from the interior version previously used, with the wooden façades from the studio simply being erected on the new site.<ref name="tinkerpg95"/> These were replaced with brick façades, and back yards were added in the 1970s.

In 1982 a permanent full-street set was built in the Granada [[backlot]], constructed from reclaimed [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] brick.<ref name="tinkerpg95"/> The set was updated in 1989 with the construction of a new factory, two shop units and three modern town houses on the south side of the street.<ref name = "vuqqwe">Little.

Between 1989 and 1999 the [[Granada Studios Tour]] allowed members of the public to visit the set. The exterior set was extended and updated in 1999. This update added to the [[Rosamund Street]] and Victoria Street façades, and added a viaduct on Rosamund Street. Most interior scenes are shot in the adjoining purpose-built studio.<ref name = "vuqqwe"/>

== Broadcast history ==

=== United Kingdom ===
For 50 years, ''Coronation Street'' has remained at the centre of ITV's prime time schedule. The programme is currently shown in the UK in five episodes, over three evenings a week on ITV. From Friday 9 December 1960 until Friday 3 March 1961, the programme was shown in two episodes broadcast Wednesday and Friday at 19:00.<ref name="littlepg10"/> Schedules were changed and from Monday 6 March 1961 until Wednesday 11 October 1989, the programme was shown in two episodes broadcast Monday and Wednesday at 19:30.<ref name="littlepg10"/> The third weekly episode was introduced on Friday 20 October 1989, broadcast at 19:30.<ref name="littlepg188" /> From 1996, an extra episode was broadcast at 19:30 on Sunday nights. Aside from Granada, the programme originally appeared on the following stations of the ITV network: [[Anglia Television]], [[Associated-Rediffusion]], [[Television Wales and the West]], [[Scottish Television]], [[Southern Television]] and [[Ulster Television]]. From episode 14 on Wednesday 25 January 1961, [[Tyne Tees Television]] broadcast the programme. That left [[Associated Television|ATV]] in the Midlands as the only ITV station not carrying the show. When they decided to broadcast the programme, national transmission was changed from Wednesday and Friday at 19:00 to Monday and Wednesday at 19:30 and the programme became fully networked under this new arrangement from episode 25 on Monday 6 March 1961.

As the ITV network grew over the next few years, the programme was transmitted by these new stations on these dates onward: [[Westward Television]] from episode 40 on 29 April 1961, [[Border Television]] from episode 76 on 1 September 1961, [[Grampian Television]] from episode 84 on 30 September 1961, [[Channel Television]] from episode 180 on 1 September 1962 and [[Teledu Cymru]] (north and west Wales) from episode 184 on 14 September 1962. At this point, the ITV network became complete and the programme was broadcast almost continuously across the country at 19:30 on Monday and Wednesday for the next twenty-seven years.

From episode 2981 on Friday 20 October 1989 at 19:30, a third weekly episode was introduced and this increased to four episodes a week from episode 4096 on Sunday 24 November 1996, again at 19:30.<ref>Little. (2000) p.229.</ref> The second Monday episode was introduced in 2002 and was broadcast at 20:30 to usher in the return of [[Bet Lynch]].<ref>{{cite news |first= Chris| last= Diamond |title= Coronation Street Review|url = http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/reviews/2002/coronationstreet.htm|work= Off The Telly|date= 10 June 2002 |accessdate =9 March 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061014022108/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/reviews/2002/coronationstreet.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 14 October 2006}}</ref> The Monday 20:30 episode was used intermittently during the popular Richard Hillman story line but has become fully scheduled since episode 5568 on Monday 25 August 2003. Additional episodes have been broadcast during the weekly schedule of ITV at certain times, notably in 2004 when, between 22 and 26 November, eight episodes were shown.<ref>{{cite news  |first= Neil| last= Wilkes |title= Corrie to be aired eight times in one week|url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a16769/corrie-to-air-eight-times-in-one-week.html |work= Digital Spy|date= 5 November 2004 |accessdate =9 March 2007}}</ref>

Older episodes had been broadcast by satellite and cable channel [[Granada Plus]] from launch in 1996. The first episodes shown were from episode 1588 (originally transmitted on Monday 5 April 1976) onwards. Originally listed and promoted as ''Classic Coronation Street'', the "classic" was dropped in early 2002, at which stage the episodes were from late 1989. By the time of the channel's closure in 2004, the repeats had reached January 1994.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In addition to this, "specials" were broadcast on Saturday afternoons in the early years of the channel with several episodes based on a particular theme or character(s) were shown. The latest episode shown in these specials was from 1991. In addition, on 27 and 28 December 2003, several [[Christmas Day]] editions of the show were broadcast.

From 23 July 2009 ''Coronation Street'' has been broadcast in five weekly instalments, at 19:30 and 20:30 on Mondays and Fridays, and at 20:30 on Thursday. The Thursday episode replaces the former Wednesday show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jul/08/coronation-street-move-wednesdays|title=Coronation Street to move from Wednesdays&nbsp;– after nearly 50 years|accessdate=8 July 2009 | work=guardian.co.uk | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood | date=8 July 2009 | location=London}}</ref> Occasional late night episodes of ''Coronation Street'' begin at 22:00, due to the [[watershed (television)|watershed]]. Repeat episodes, [[omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus]] broadcasts and specials have been shown on ITV and [[ITV2]]. In January 2008 the omnibus returned to the main ITV channel where it was aired on Saturday mornings/afternoons depending on the schedule and times. In May 2008 it moved to Sunday mornings until August 2008 when it returned to Saturdays. In January 2009 it moved back to Sunday mornings usually broadcasting at around 09:25 until December 2010. In January 2011 the omnibus moved to Saturday mornings on ITV at 09:25. During the Rugby World Cup, which took place in New Zealand, matches had to be broadcast on a Saturday morning, so the omnibus moved to Saturday lunchtimes/afternoons during September and October 2011. However as of 22 October 2011 the omnibus moved back to Saturday mornings at 09:25 on ITV. From January 2012 the omnibus was no longer broadcast on ITV after 4 years, however it remains on ITV2.

On 30 June 2011 it was confirmed that Coronation Street would return to its traditional 19:30 timeslot on a Wednesday evening in September 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a327711/coronation-street-moves-back-to-wednesday-nights.html |title='Coronation Street' moves back to Wednesday nights&nbsp;— Coronation Street News&nbsp;— Soaps |publisher=Digital Spy |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref>

=== International syndication ===
''Coronation Street'' is also shown in many countries worldwide.

;Australia
The programme was first aired in Australia in 1963 on [[TCN]]-9 Sydney, [[GTV]]-9 Melbourne and [[NWS (TV station)|NWS]]-9 Adelaide, and by 1966 ''Coronation Street'' was more popular in Australia than in the UK.<ref>Little. (1995) p.67.</ref> The show eventually left free-to-air television in Australia in the 1970s. It briefly returned to the Nine Network in a daytime slot during 1994–95. In 2005 Channel Nine in Perth began to show episodes before the 18:00 news to improve the lead in to Nine News Perth, but this did not work and the show was cancelled a few months later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=3618&st=75&s=3d781df6ed1846c4dfd8bc83f262d6da |title=City by City Programming Differences&nbsp;– Forums&nbsp;– Page 4 |publisher=Media Spy |date= |accessdate=22 January 2010}}</ref> In 1996 Pay-TV began and [[Arena (television network)|Arena]] began screening the series in one-hour instalments on Saturday and Sundays at 18:30. The series was later moved to Pay-TV channel [[UKTV (Australia and New Zealand)|UKTV]] where it is still shown. Currently as at 2013 ''Coronation Street'' is shown on weeknights at 7.30pm. Episodes on UKTV are about 6 weeks behind the UK.<ref>{{cite web |work=UKTV Australia| title = Coronation Street|url = http://www.uktv.com.au/programme.asp?id=19|accessdate=9 March 2007}}{{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref> [[Seven Network|Seven's]] [[free-to-air]] digital channel [[7Two]] are currently  broadcasting episodes from year 2005, on weekdays at 10:00am. .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/tv-lounge/comment-page-1#comment-107682 |title=TV Lounge |publisher=TV Tonight |date= |accessdate=22 January 2010}}</ref>

;Belgium
In 2006, the small network Vitaya started broadcasting ''Coronation Street'' for viewers in Belgium, with episodes broadcast roughly two years behind the UK.<ref>{{cite news|title=Belgian Channel Takes Coronation Street|work=World Screen|url=http://www.worldscreen.com/newscurrent.php?filename=bel42706.htm|accessdate=8 March 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

;Canada
In Canada, ''Coronation Street'' is broadcast on [[CBC Television]]. Until 2011, episodes were shown in Canada approximately 10 months after they aired in Britain; however, beginning in the fall of 2011, the CBC began showing two episodes every weekday, in order to catch up with the ITV showings, at 18:30 and 19:00 local time Monday-Friday, with an [[omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus]] on Sundays at 07:30. During [[NHL playoffs]], it was broadcast at 15:30 local time each weekday afternoon. As of September 2012, the CBC was only two weeks behind Britain, leading to a show being reduced to a single showing weeknights at 19:30 local time, with a repeat showing at 00:00 local time.

The show debuted on Toronto's [[CBLT-DT|CBLT]] in July 1966.<ref name=Walrus>{{cite journal|last=Groen|first=Danielle|title=http://walrusmagazine.com/articles/2011.01-television-craving-corrie/1/|journal=[[The Walrus]]|year=2011|month=January|url=http://walrusmagazine.com/articles/2011.01-television-craving-corrie/1/}}</ref>  The 2002 edition of the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' recognises the 1,144 episodes sold to the now-defunct CBC-owned [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]], TV station [[CBKST]] by Granada TV on 31 May 1971 to be the largest number of TV shows ever purchased in one transaction.<ref>{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2002|page=160|publisher=Guinness|year=2001|isbn=0-85112-124-1}}</ref>  The show traditionally aired on weekday afternoons in Canada, with a Sunday morning omnibus.  In 2004, CBC moved the weekday airings from their daytime slot to [[prime time]].<ref name=Walrus/><ref>{{cite news |work=CBC Television, Canada| title= Coronation Street|url=http://www.cbc.ca/coronation/|accessdate=8 March 2007}}</ref>

In light of recent austerity measures imposed on the CBC in 2012, which includes further cutbacks on non-Canadian programming, one of the foreign shows to remain on the CBC schedule is ''Coronation Street'', according to the CBC's director of content planning Christine Wilson, who commented: "Unofficially I can tell you ''Coronation Street'' is coming back. If it didn't come back, something would happen on [[Parliament Hill]]."<ref>[http://www.therecord.com/whatson/artsentertainment/article/715097--cbc-to-jettison-wheel-of-fortune-jeopardy The Record: "CBC to jettison Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy!", 30 April 2012.]</ref> [[Kirstine Stewart]], the head of the CBC's English-language division, once remarked: "Coronation Street fans are the most loyal, except maybe for [[curling]] viewers, of all CBC viewers,"<ref name=Walrus/>

;Ireland
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], ''Coronation Street'' is [[simulcast]] on [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]]. The show is TV3's most watched programme with an average of 365,000 people watching each night. The show was so popular that an omnibus is also shown on weekends. For a number of months in 2009 TV3 provided repeats of the night's episode on sister channel [[3e]] at 21:00 Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights, this has since stopped. The show was first aired in 1978, beginning with episodes from 1976. Ireland eventually caught up with the current UK episodes in 1983. Until 1992 it was broadcast on [[RTÉ Two]] and from 1992 to 2001 it was broadcast on [[RTÉ One]]. In 2001 Granada TV bought 45% TV3, which resulted in TV3 broadcasting series since 2001. In 2006 ITV sold its share of the channel but TV3 and ITV have since agreed to allow the programme to remain on TV3. From 2015 [[UTV Ireland]] will broadcast Coronation Street, the channel is due to go on air in 2015.

;New Zealand
In New Zealand, ''Coronation Street'' has been shown locally since 1964, first on [[NZBC]] television until 1975,<ref>[http://tvnz.co.nz/cheers-to-50-years/1970s-tv-trivia-3484296 1970s: TV Trivia]</ref> and then on [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV One]], which now broadcasts it in double bills every Thursday and Friday at 19:30,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/coronation-street/returns-primetime-4424520 |title=Coronation Street returns to Primetime &#124; Coronation Street &#124; Television New Zealand &#124; Television &#124; TV One, TV2, U, TVNZ 7 |publisher=Tvnz.co.nz |date= |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> with episodes nearly 22 months behind Britain. Episodes 7718 and 7719 seen in the UK on 21 October 2011 will be screened by TVNZ on 8 August 2013. The serial previously aired on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 19:30 until October 2011, when the show moved to a 17:30 half-hour slot every weekday. The move proved highly unpopular with fans,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coronationstreetupdates.blogspot.com/2011/09/new-zealand-corrie-fans-outraged-at.html |title=Coronation Street Blog: New Zealand Corrie fans outraged at time change |publisher=Coronationstreetupdates.blogspot.com |date=28 September 2011 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> and the series was quickly moved into its present prime-time slot within weeks.

;The Netherlands
Dutch broadcaster [[VARA (broadcaster)|VARA]] showed 428 sub-titled episodes on Netherlands TV between 1967 and 1975. It wanted to terminate the series in 1971 but due to public pressure continued until 1975. Because VARA was running well behind the British broadcasts, causing the actors to refer to past British politics, a special episode was produced for VARA to bridge and jump the gap and allow VARA to broadcast newer episodes.
In 2011 Dutch broadcaster SBS6 started to show episodes from 26 November 2001 about 4 or 5 times a week during daytime (1:15 pm) starting with 3000 viewers every day, and till date (5 November) with an average of 35,000 viewers

;Sweden
In Sweden ''Coronation Street'' was shown in the country's largest broadcaster [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] during daytime in the early 2000s until it was taken off air a few years later. TV4 also broadcasts ''[[Emmerdale]]'' which (2012) is Swedens's most watched daytime programme and attracts some 150.000 to 200.000 viewers on a daily basis.

;United States
In the United States, ''Coronation Street'' is available by broadcast or cable only in northern markets where CBC coverage from Canada overlaps the border or is available on local cable systems. It was previously broadcast on CBC's former US cable channel, [[Trio (TV network)|Trio]] until the CBC sold their stake in the channel to Universal, before it was shut down in 2006.

Starting in 2009, episodes have been available in the United States through [[Amazon.com]]'s on demand service. Episodes are one month behind their original UK airdates.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a147727/coronation-street-goes-on-demand-in-us.html 'Coronation Street' goes 'on-demand' in US – Coronation Street News – Soaps – Digital Spy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The final series of shows available from Amazon appears to be from November 2012, as no new episodes have been uploaded.

On 15 January 2013, online distributor [[Hulu]] began airing episodes of the show, posting a new episode daily, two weeks after their original airdates.<ref>[http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/2013/01/exclusive-coronation-street-heading-to-hulu-and-hulu-plus#more-18909y<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://hulu.com/coronation-street<!-- Bot generate title -->]</ref>

== Merchandise ==
Several classic episodes were released on VHS video in the 1980s and 1990s in different sets, while a number of specially recorded feature-length episodes were released exclusively to video (see [[Coronation Street VHS and DVD releases]]).

''The Street'', a magazine dedicated to the show, was launched in 1989. Edited by Bill Hill, the magazine contained a summary of recent storylines, interviews, articles about classic episodes, and stories that occurred from before 1960. The format was initially [[A5 paper size|A5 size]], expanding to A4 from the seventh issue.<ref>''The Street'', Issue 7, The Street Ltd.</ref> The magazine folded after issue 23 in 1993 when the publisher's contract with Granada Studios Tour expired and Granada wanted to produce their own magazine.<ref>''The Street'', Issue 23, The Street Ltd.</ref>

During the time when the studios tour was operating, a huge amount of branded merchandise was available from an on-site shop—everything from soap, to tea-towels, to model houses. These items gradually became scarce as the tours complex was wound down. Although there were large numbers produced, these items are becoming collectable by fans.

On 25 June 2010 a video game of the show was released on [[Nintendo DS]]. Players take the role of a detective as they work through a brand new storyline and befriend the various characters from the street, including Ken, Norris, Maria and Blanche.

=== Discography ===

== Spin-offs and specials ==
Granada launched one spin-off in 1965, ''[[Pardon the Expression]]'', following the story of clothing store manager Leonard Swindley ([[Arthur Lowe]]) after he left Weatherfield. Swindley's management experience was tested when he was appointed assistant manager at a fictional [[department store]], Dobson and Hawks. Granada produced two series of the spin-off, which ended in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Lewisohn|title=Pardon The Expression!|work=BBC Comedy Guide |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/p/pardontheexpress_7775085.shtml|accessdate=3 January 2007}}{{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref>

In 1967, Arthur Lowe returned as Leonard Swindley in ''[[Turn out the Lights]]'', a short-lived sequel to ''Pardon the Expression''.

The German TV series ''[[Lindenstraße]]'' took ''Coronation Street'' as the model. ''Lindenstraße'' started in 1985.

In 1985, a sister series, ''[[Albion Market]]'' was launched. It ran for one year, with 100 episodes produced.

On 8 December 2000 and 9 December 2010, live episodes were aired to mark the 40th and 50th anniversaries of the show. The first was mainly based around [[Vera Duckworth]] in hospital and the campaign to save the cobbles. The second was based around events following the tram crash.

''Coronation Street: Family Album'' was several documentaries about various families living on the street.

"Farewell&nbsp;..." was several documentaries featuring the best moments of a single character who had recently left the series. Most notably, Farewell Blanche (Hunt), Farewell Jack (Duckworth), Farewell Mike (Baldwin), Farewell Vera (Duckworth), Farewell Janice (Battersby), Farewell Liz (McDonald) and Farewell Becky (McDonald).  Most of these were broadcast on the same day as the character's final scenes in the series.

On 21 December 2008, a web-based miniseries ran on ITV.com; called ''Corrie Confidential'' the first episode featured the characters [[Rosie Webster|Rosie]] and [[Sophie Webster]] in ''Underworld''.

''Stars on the Street'' was aired around Christmas of 2009. It featured actors from the soap talking about the famous guest stars who had appeared in the series including people who were in it before they were famous.

In 2010, several actors from the show appeared on ''[[The Jeremy Kyle Show]]'' as their soap characters: [[David Platt (Coronation Street character)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]), [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]) and [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]). In the fictional, semi-improvised scenario, David accused Nick (his brother) and Tina (his ex-girlfriend) of sleeping together.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/7458941/Jeremy-Kyle-takes-on-Coronation-Street.html |title=Jeremy Kyle takes on Coronation Street|publisher=The Telegraph|date=17 March 2010 |accessdate=16 February 2011|location=London}}</ref>

The ghosts were [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]], [[Maxine Peacock]], [[Derek Wilton]] and [[Vera Duckworth]]. Other special guests include [[Torvill and Dean]], [[Lorraine Kelly]] and [[Sheila Reid]]. The episode concluded with Norris learning the error of his ways and dancing on the cobbles. The original plan for this feature was to have included [[Jack Duckworth]], along with Vera, but actor [[Bill Tarmey]] died before filming commenced. In the end a recording of his voice was played.<ref>{{cite web|title=Corrie faves to return|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/corrie-faves-jack-duckworth-and-vera-1403343|publisher=The Mirror}}</ref>

=== Stage ===
{{main|Corrie!}}
In August 2010, many ''Coronation Street'' characters were brought to the stage to make a mockery of [[Jonathan Harvey (playwright)|Jonathan Harvey]]'s new comedy play ''[[Corrie!]]''. The play was commissioned to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the TV series and was presented at [[The Lowry]] in Salford, England<ref>[http://www.thelowry.com/event/corrie "Corrie! August 2010"], ''The Lowry'', Salford, August 2010; Retrieved 31 January 2011</ref> by [[ITV Studios]] and Phil McIntyre Entertainments. Featuring a cast of six actors who alternate roles of favourite characters including Ena Sharples, Hilda Ogden, Hayley and Roy, Richard Hillman, Jack Duckworth, Bet Lynch, Steve, Karen and Becky, the play weaves together some of the most memorable moments from the TV show. It toured UK theatres between February 2011 and July 2011 with guest star narrators including Roy Barraclough, Ken Morley and Gaynor Faye.<ref>[http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8831294745762/Gaynor+Faye+%26+Ken+Morley+Narrate+Corrie!+Tour.html "Gaynor Faye & Ken Morley Narrate Corrie!

=== Films ===
Over the years ''Coronation Street'' has released several straight-to-video films. Unlike other soaps which often used straight-to-video films to cover more contentious plot lines that may not be allowed by the broadcaster, ''Coronation Street'' has largely used these films to reset their characters in other locations.

In 1995, ''Coronation Street: The Cruise'' also known as ''Coronation Street: The Feature Length Special'' was released on VHS to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the show. ITV heavily promoted the programme as a direct-to-video exclusive but broadcast a brief version of it on 24 March 1996. The [[Independent Television Commission]] investigated the broadcast, as viewers complained that ITV misled them.<ref>{{cite news|last=MacDonald|first=Marianne|title='Street' cruises for fall over video's brief honeymoon |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/street-cruises-for-fall-over-videos-brief-honeymoon-1304046.html|accessdate=1 October 2010|publisher=The Independent|date=10 April 1996|location=London}}</ref>

In 1997, following the controversial cruise spin-off, ''[[Coronation Street: Viva Las Vegas!]]'' was released on VHS, featuring [[Jack Duckworth]], [[Vera Duckworth]], [[Fiona Middleton]] and [[Maxine Peacock]] on a trip to Las Vegas.

In 1999, six special episodes of ''Coronation Street'' were produced, following the story of [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve McDonald]], [[Vicky McDonald]], [[Vikram Desai]], [[Bet Gilroy]] and [[Reg Holdsworth]] in Brighton.<ref>Little. (2000) p.248.</ref> This video was titled ''Coronation Street: Open All Hours'' and released on VHS.

In 2008, ITV announced filming was to get underway for a new special DVD episode, ''[[Coronation Street: Out of Africa]]'', following the Battersby-Brown family, which saw the temporary return of [[Cilla Battersby-Brown]].

In 2009, another DVD special, ''[[Coronation Street: Romanian Holiday]]'', was released. The feature-length comedy drama followed [[Roy Cropper|Roy]], [[Hayley Cropper|Hayley]] and [[Becky Granger|Becky]] as they travelled to [[Romania]] for the wedding of a face from their past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a160096/roy-hayley-becky-for-romanian-corrie-dvd.html |title=Roy, Hayley, Becky for Romanian Corrie DVD |publisher=Digital Spy |date=15 June 2009 |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref>

On 1 November 2010, ''Coronation Street: A Knight's Tale'' was released. [[Reg Holdsworth]] and [[Curly Watts]] returned in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003YL40QC |title=Coronation Street-A Knight's Tale |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref> [[Mary Taylor (Coronation Street)|Mary]] tries to take [[Norris Cole|Norris]] to an apparently haunted castle where she hoped to seduce him. [[Rosie Webster|Rosie]] gets a job there and she takes [[Jason Grimshaw|Jason]] with her. [[Brian Capron]] also guest starred as an assumed relative of [[Richard Hillman]].  He rises out of a lake as a comedic "wink to the audience" after Hillman drowned in 2003.

=== 50th Anniversary (2010) ===
The BBC commissioned a one-off drama called ''[[The Road to Coronation Street]]'', about how the series first came into being. [[Jessie Wallace]] plays [[Pat Phoenix]] ([[Elsie Tanner]]) with [[Lynda Baron]] as [[Violet Carson]] ([[Ena Sharples]]), [[Celia Imrie]] as [[Doris Speed]] ([[Annie Walker]]) and James Roache as his own father [[William Roache]] ([[Ken Barlow (Coronation Street)|Ken Barlow]]). It was broadcast on 16 September 2010 on [[BBC Four]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/sep/17/the-road-to-coronation-street-tv-review |title=TV review: The Road to Coronation Street |work=The Guardian |date= 17 September 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2011|location=London}}</ref>

In December 2010, ITV made a few special programmes to mark the 50th anniversary. ''Coronation Street Uncovered: Live'', hosted by [[Stephen Mulhern]] was shown after the episode with the tram crash was aired on ITV 2. On 7 and 9 December a countdown on the greatest Corrie moments, ''Coronation Street: 50 Years, 50 Moments'', the viewers voted "The Barlows at Alcoholics Anonymous" as the greatest moment. On 10 December [[Paul O'Grady]] hosted a quiz show, ''Coronation Street: The Big 50'' with three teams from the soap and a celebrity team answering questions about Coronation Street and other soaps. Also, ''[[Come Dine with Me]]'' and ''[[Celebrity Juice]]'' aired Coronation Street specials in the anniversary week.

=== Crossovers ===
''Coronation Street'' and rival soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' had a crossover for ''[[Children in Need 2010|Children in Need]]'' in November 2010 called "[[East Street (Children in Need)|East Street]]". ''EastEnders'' stars that visited Weatherfield include [[Laurie Brett]] as [[Jane Beale]], [[Charlie G. Hawkins]] as [[Darren Miller]], [[Kylie Babbington]] as [[Jodie Gold]], [[Nina Wadia]] as [[Zainab Masood]] and [[John Partridge (performer)|John Partridge]] as [[Christian Clarke]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11773594|title=Coronation Street and EastEnders to merge for charity|date=17 November 2010|work=BBC News |accessdate=17 November 2010}}</ref>

''Coronation Street: Viva Las Vegas!'' also included some characters from ''[[Emmerdale]]''.

=== Corrie in popular culture ===
The British rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] produced a single "[[I Want to Break Free]]" in 1984 which reached number 3 position in UK charts and which is largely known for its music video for which all the band members dressed in women's clothes, which parodied the characters and is considered as a homage to the show.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sutcliffe, Phil; Hince, Peter and Mack, Reinhold|title=Queen: The Ultimate Illustrated History of the Crown Kings of Rock|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=adNONbUWLjgC&pg=PT183|date=15 November 2009|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-7603-3719-6 |page=180}}</ref> The video depicts Mercury as a housewife, loosely based on [[Bet Lynch]], who wants to "break free" from his life.
