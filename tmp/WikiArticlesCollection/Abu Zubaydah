'''Abu Zubaydah''' ({{pronunciation|En-us-Abu Zubaydah from Saudi Arabia pronunciation (Voice of America).ogg}} {{respell|AH|boo}} {{respell|zoo|BAY|dah}};{{Need-IPA}} {{Lang-ar|ابو زبيدة}}, ''Abū Zubaydah''; born March 12, 1971 as '''Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn''') is a Saudi Arabian citizen, never charged by the U.S. government, currently held in U.S. custody as an [[enemy combatant]] in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]s, in Cuba. He was arrested in Pakistan in March 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5322694.stm |title=Americas &#124; Profile: Key US terror suspects |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-02-11 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}</ref>

Abu Zubaydah has been in US custody for more than ten years, four-and-a-half of them in the CIA [[black site|secret prison network]]. President George W. Bush originally bragged about his capture, as the [[CIA]] thought he was a high-ranking member of [[al-Qaeda]]. They transferred him among prisons in various countries as part of their [[Extraordinary rendition by the United States|extraordinary rendition]] program. During interrogation in the Bush administration years, Zubaydah was [[waterboarding|water-boarded]] 83 times <ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/world/20detain.html?_r=0 NY Times</ref> and subjected to numerous other tortures including [[Nudity#Forced nudity|forced nudity]], [[sleep deprivation]], confinement in small dark boxes, deprivation of solid food, [[stress positions]], and physical assaults. These have been prohibited by the Obama administration.

In August 2010 it was reported that Zubaydah was first transferred to Guantanamo with three other high-value detainees in September 2003. Concerned that a pending Supreme Court decision might require revealing data about him, the CIA took back custody and transferred the four men from Guantanamo in March 2004.<ref name=AssociatedPress-2010-08-07>

It was not until September 2006 that these four, together with ten other "[[high-value detainees]]" were transferred to Guantanamo. He and other former [[CIA]] detainees are held in [[Camp Platinum (Guantanamo)#Camp seven/Camp Platinum|Camp 7]], where conditions are the most isolating. At his [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]] in 2007, Zubaydah said he was told that that CIA realized he was not significant.

== Early activities ==
By 1999, the U.S. Government was attempting to surveil Abu Zubaydah.<ref name="PressTrustIndia">[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-4648752_ITM "Pak leadership under Sharif offered to try to capture Osama"], The Press Trust of India Ltd. Through ''Asia Pulse'', March 28, 2004 (Access My Library Link, requires free membership)</ref> By March 2000, United States officials were reporting that Abu Zubaydah was a "senior bin Laden official", the "former head of Egypt-based Islamic Jihad", a "trusted aide" to bin Laden with "growing power," who had "played a key role in the East Africa embassy attacks."<ref name="DavidVise">[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-513940.html David A. Vise and Lorraine Adams, "Bin Laden Weakened, Officials Say"], ''The Washington Post''. March 11, 2000 (Highbeam News Database Link, requires free membership)</ref> None of these assertions has been corroborated. He was eventually described as a low-level person.

Abu Zubaydah was convicted ''in absentia'' in Jordan and sentenced to death<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/six-muslim-militants-sentenced-to-death-for-plotting-to-attack-tourists-in-jordan-699684.html "Six Muslim militants sentenced to death for plotting to attack tourists in Jordan"], ''[[The Independent]]'', September 19, 2000</ref> by a Jordanian court for his role in plots to bomb U.S. and Israeli targets there.<ref name="JamalHalaby">[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-26114220.html Jamal Halaby, "Arabs of Terror Linked to bin Laden", AP News Online] (Highbeam News Database Link, requires free membership)</ref> A senior Middle East security official said Zubaydah had directed the Jordanian cell and was part of “bin Laden’s inner circle."<ref name="TraineesInTerror">[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000305&slug=4008236 "Trainees in Terror"], ''The Seattle Times'', Sunday, March 5, 2000</ref>

In August 2001, a classified [[FBI]] report entitled, “Bin Laden determined to strike in U.S.”, said that the foiled millennium bomber, [[Ahmed Ressam]], had confessed that Zubaydah had  encouraged him to blow up the Los Angeles airport, and facilitated his mission.<ref name="BinLadenReport">[http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/10/august6.memo/index.html "Transcript: Bin Laden determined to Strike in US"], CNN.com, April 10, 2004</ref> The report said that Zubaydah was planning his own attack on the U.S. (This was not made public until 2004.)<ref name=BinLadenReport/> An unclassified FBI report said Ressam tried to buy a laptop for Zubaydah.<ref name="ElaineGanley">[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-80592999.html Elaine Ganley, "Terror Plot Took Typical Path"], AP Online, December 19, 2001 (Highbeam News Database Link, requires free membership)</ref> When Ahmed Ressam was tried in December 2001, federal prosecutors did not try to connect him to Abu Zubaydah.

== Capture ==
On March 28, 2002, CIA and FBI agents, in conjunction with Pakistani intelligence services, raided several safe houses in Pakistan searching for Abu Zubaydah.<ref name="GuantanamoFiles">Andy Worthington, ''The Guantanamo Files,'' Pluto Press, 2007</ref><ref name="TimMcGirk">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,227584,00.html Tim McGirk, "Anatomy of a Raid"], ''TIME Magazine,'' 8 April 2002</ref><ref name="JohnBurns">John Burns, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00EFDA123CF937A25757C0A9649C8B63 "A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FUGITIVES, In Pakistan’s Interior, A Troubling Victory in Hunt for Al Qaeda"].

His [[pocket litter]] supposedly contained two [[ATM card|bank cards]] which showed he had access to Saudi and Kuwaiti bank accounts; most al-Qaeda members used the preferred, untraceable [[hawala]] banking.<ref name="risen"/> According to [[James Risen]], "It is not clear whether an investigation of the cards simply fell through the cracks, or whether they were ignored because no one wanted to know the answers about connections between al Qaeda and important figures in the Middle East – particularly in Saudi Arabia."<ref name="risen"/>  One of Risen's sources chalks up the failure to investigate the cards to incompetence rather than foul play, "The cards were sent back to Washington and were never fully exploited. I think nobody ever looked at them because of incompetence."<ref name="risen"/> 

When Americans investigated the cards, they worked with "a Muslim financier with a questionable past, and with connections to the Afghan Taliban, al Qaeda, and Saudi intelligence."<ref name="risen"/> Risen wrote, "Saudi intelligence officials had seized all of the records related to the card from the Saudi financial institution in question; the records then disappeared. There was no longer any way to trace the money that had gone into the account."<ref name="risen"/>

A search of the safehouse turned up Zubaydah's personal 10,000-page diaries, in which he recorded his thoughts as a young boy, old man, and at his current age. What appears to be split personalities is how Zubaydah was piecing his memories together after his 1992 shrapnel head wound. As part of his therapy to regain his memories, he began recording the diary that detailed his life, emotions, and what people were telling him. He split information into categories, such as what he knew about himself and what people told him, and listed them under different names to distinguish one set from the other.

=== Top U.S. officials approved torture techniques ===
In the Spring of 2002, immediately following the capture of Abu Zubaydah, top Bush administration officials, Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Colin Powell, CIA Director George Tenet, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and US Attorney General John Ashcroft discussed at length whether or not the CIA could legally use harsh techniques against him.<ref name="MarkMazetti">[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/washington/25detain.html Mark Mazzetti, "Bush Aides Linked to Talks on Interrogations"], ''New York Times'', September 24, 2008</ref><ref name="BushAwareInterrogations">[http://abclocal.go.com/kfsn/story?section=news/national_world&id=6076727 "Bush aware of advisers’ interrogation talks"], ABC News, April 11, 2008</ref> Condoleezza Rice specifically mentioned the [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape|SERE]] program during the meeting, saying, “I recall being told that U.S. military personnel were subjected to training to certain physical and psychological interrogation techniques…”<ref name="MarkMazetti"/>

== Interrogation of Abu Zubaydah ==
{{Main|Interrogation of Abu Zubaydah}}
Abu Zubaydah was interrogated by two separate interrogation teams: the first from the FBI and one from the CIA. [[Ali Soufan]], one of the FBI interrogators, later testified in 2009 on these issues to the Senate Committee that was investigating detainee treatment.<ref name="SoufanOpEd"/> Soufan, who witnessed part of the CIA interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, described his treatment under the CIA as [[torture]].<ref name="SoufanOpEd">[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/opinion/23soufan.html Ali Soufan, "My Tortured Decision"], ''New York Times'', April 22, 2009</ref> The International Committee of the Red Cross and others later reached the same conclusion.<ref name="SoufanNewsweek">Michael Isikoff [http://www.newsweek.com/id/195089 "We Could Have Done This the Right Way"], ''Newsweek,'' 25 April 2009</ref><ref name="SoufanTestimony">[http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3842&wit_id=7906 "Congressional Testimony of Ali Soufan, May 13, 2009"], Congressional Testimony, 13 May 2009</ref><ref name="ICRC">[http://www.nybooks.com/icrc-report.pdf ''Report on the Treatment of Fourteen "High Value Detainees" in CIA Custody''], International Committee of the Red Cross, February 2007</ref>

Because of the urgency felt about the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, the CIA had consulted with the president about how to proceed. The General Counsel of the CIA asked for a legal opinion from the [[Office of Legal Counsel]], Department of Justice about what was permissible during interrogation.

===August 1, 2002 memo===
{{main|Torture Memos}}
It was later discovered that in August 2002, the Office of Legal Counsel, [[Jay Bybee]] and his assistant [[John Yoo]] drafted what became known as the first [[Torture Memo]].<ref name="August02TortureMemoReleased">[http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/24/cia.torture/index.html ''Previously Secret Torture Memo Released''] CNN.com, July 24, 2008</ref> Addressed to CIA acting General Counsel [[John A.

===2003 transfer to Guantanamo===
In August 2010 the Associated Press reported that the CIA, having concluded its agents had gotten most of the information from Abu Zubaydah, in September 2003 transferred him and three other high-value detainees to Guantanamo. They were held at what was informally known as "[[Strawberry Fields]]", a secret camp within the complex built especially for former CIA detainees. Concerned that a pending Supreme Court decision, ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'' (2004), might go against the Bush administration and require providing the prisoners with counsel and having to reveal data about them, on March 27, 2004 the CIA took the four men back into custody and transported them out of Guantanamo to one of their secret sites.<ref name=AssociatedPress-2010-08-07>

</ref> At the time, the moves were all kept secret.

===2005 Torture memos===
The OLC provided additional guidance to the CIA regarding the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah and other high-value detainees. Its May 10, 2005 torture memo said that no more than 60 applications of water could be conducted in a 30-day period during waterboarding. But, that number applied only to those applications of "ten seconds or more."<ref name="May102005BradburyMemo"/> 

A U.S. official with knowledge of the interrogation program reported in 2009 to [[Fox News]] that many of the applications lasted "a matter of seconds," and it was these less than ten-second applications "that created the huge numbers." He said "[a]ll of those individual pours were scrupulously counted by the CIA, according to the memos, to abide by the procedures set up for the waterboardings."<ref name="JosephAbrams">Joseph Abrams [http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/28/despite-reports-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-waterboarded-times "Despite Reports, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Was Not Waterboarded 183 Times"], Fox News, 28 April 2009</ref>

The May 10, 2005 torture memo discussed the 2004 Department of Justice, Inspector General report, noting,  
<blockquote> [T]he waterboard technique… was different from the technique described in the DOJ opinion and used in the SERE training. The difference was in the manner in which the detainee’s breathing was obstructed. At the SERE school and in the DOJ opinion, the subject’s airflow is disrupted by the firm application of a damp cloth over the air passage; the interrogator applies a small amount of water to the cloth in a controlled manner. By contrast, the Agency interrogator… applied large volumes of water to a cloth that covered the detainee’s mouth and nose. One of the psychologists/interrogators acknowledged that the Agency’s use of the technique is different from that used in SERE training because it is ‘for real’ and is ‘more poignant and convincing.’” The Inspector General further reported that “OMS contends that the expertise of the SERE psychologist/interrogator on the waterboard was probably misrepresented at the time, as the SERE waterboard experience is so different from the subsequent Agency usage as to make it almost irrelevant. Consequently, according to OMS, there was no a priori reason to believe that applying the waterboard with the frequency and intensity with which it was used by the psychologist/interrogators was either efficacious or medically safe."<ref name="May102005BradburyMemo"/></blockquote>

The Inspector General of DOJ in its 2004 report on interrogations noted that the use of waterboarding was discontinued in every armed services branch except the Navy SERE training "because of its dramatic effect on the students who were subjects."<ref name="May102005BradburyMemo"/> The CIA Office of Medical Services contradicted this conclusion, saying that 
<blockquote>“[w]hile SERE trainers believe that trainees are unable to maintain psychological resistance to the waterboard our experience was otherwise. Some subjects unquestionably can withstand a large number of applications, with no immediately discernible cumulative impact beyond their strong aversion to the experience.”<ref name="May102005BradburyMemo"/></blockquote>

=== International Committee of the Red Cross report ===
In February 2007, the International Committee of the Red Cross concluded a report on the treatment of "14 high-value detainees," who had been held by the CIA and, after September 2006, by the military at Guantanamo.<ref name="ICRC"/> The Red Cross customarily keeps such reports confidential in order to have continued access to prisoners and provide them service, as well as to try to negotiate with officials regarding care. The report was not made public until April 7, 2009.<ref name="ACLUICRC">[http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/39296prs20090407.html "Full ICRC Report Further Underscores Extent of Torture And Abuse By U.S. Officials"], ACLU, April 4, 2007</ref> The report is composed of interviews with the detainees. 

The ICRC said, "The ICRC wishes to underscore that the consistency of the detailed allegations provided separately by each of the fourteen [detainees] adds particular weight to the information provided."<ref name="ICRC"/> The ICRC described the twelve interrogation techniques covered in the OLC memos to the CIA: suffocation by water (waterboarding), prolonged stress standing position, beatings by use of a collar, beating and kicking, confinement in a box, prolonged nudity, sleep deprivation, exposure to cold temperature, prolonged shackling, threats of ill-treatment, forced shaving, and deprivation/restricted provision of solid food.<ref name="ICRC"/> Zubaydah was the only detainee of the 14 interviewed who had been  subjected to all 12 of the interrogation techniques.<ref name="ICRC"/>

He was also the only one of the 14 detainees to be put into close confinement.<ref name="ICRC"/> This was corroborated, in part, by one of the 2005 Torture Memos written by the Office of Legal Counsel, DOJ, which noted "[i]n OMS's view, however, cramped confinement "ha[s] not proved particularly effective" because it provides "a safehaven offering respite from interrogation."<ref name="May302005BradburyMemo">[http://luxmedia.vo.llnwd.net/o10/clients/aclu/olc_05302005_bradbury.pdf [[Steven G.

Zubaydah said of his experience with waterboarding:

====March 14, 2003 memo====
Written by John Yoo to William J. Hartley, general counsel of DOD, at this request, Yoo concluded in his legal opinion that federal laws did not apply to torture and other harsh treatment applied by interrogators overseas. He wrote this five days before the [[US invasion of Iraq]].

==== May 10, 2005 memo ====
Another memo addressed the legality of additional interrogation techniques such as nudity, dietary manipulation, abdominal slap, water dousing, and water flicking.<ref name="May102005BradburyMemo">[http://luxmedia.vo.llnwd.net/o10/clients/aclu/olc_05102005_bradbury46pg.pdf Steven Bradbury ''Memorandum for John A.

During that 30-day period the waterboard can be used no more than 5 days.

==== May 10, 2005 memo (combined interrogation techniques) ====
Another memo penned on May 10, 2005 authorized the use of the above outlined individual techniques in conjunction with one another, but stressed the importance of constant vigilance on the part of medical observers to ensure the techniques did not cause "severe physical or mental pain."<ref name="May102005BradburyCombinedMemo">[http://luxmedia.vo.llnwd.net/o10/clients/aclu/olc_05102005_bradbury20pg.pdf Steven Bradbury ''Memorandum For John A.

==== May 30, 2005 memo ====
The final memo mentioned Abu Zubaydah several times. It claimed that due to the enhanced interrogation techniques, Zubaydah "provided significant information on two operatives, [including] José Padilla[,] who planned to build and detonate a '[[dirty bomb]]' in the Washington DC area."<ref name="May302005BradburyMemo"/> This claim is strongly disputed by Ali Soufan, the [[FBI interrogator]] who first interrogated Abu Zubaydah following his capture, by traditional means. He said the most valuable information was gained before torture was used. Other intelligence officers have also disputed that claim.<ref name=mayer/><ref name="SoufanOpEd"/><ref name="SoufanNewsweek"/><ref name="SoufanTestimony"/><ref name="MazettiAndJohnston">[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/washington/09zubaydah.html?_r=1&ref=world&oref=slogin Mark Mazzetti and David Johnston ''Inquiry Begins Into Destruction of Tapes'']. ''New York Times'', December 9, 2007</ref> Soufan, when asked in 2009 by Senator [[Sheldon Whitehouse]] during a Congressional hearing if the memo was incorrect, testified that it was.<ref name="MarkBenjamin">[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/05/14/torture/ Mark Benjamin, "Soufan: CIA torture actually hindered our intelligence gathering"], ''Salon,'' May 14, 2009</ref> The memo noted that not all of the waterboarding sessions were necessary for Abu Zubaydah, since the on-scene interrogation team determined he had stopped producing actionable intelligence.<ref name="May302005BradburyMemo"/> The memo reads:
<blockquote>
This is not to say that the interrogation program has worked perfectly. According to the IG Report, the CIA, at least initially, could not always distinguish detainees who had information but were successfully resisting interrogation from those who did not actually have the information. See IG Report at 83–85. On at least one occasion, this may have resulted in what might be deemed in retrospect to have been the unnecessary use of enhanced techniques. On that occasion, although the on-scene interrogation team judged Abu Zubaydah to be compliant, elements within CIA Headquarters still believed he was withholding information. See id at 84. At the direction of CIA Headquarters, interrogators therefore used the waterboard one more time on Zubaydah.<ref name="May302005BradburyMemo"/>
</blockquote>

[[John E. McLaughlin|John McLaughlin]], former acting CIA director, stated in 2006, "I totally disagree with the view that the capture of Abu Zubaydah was unimportant. Abu Zubaydah was woven through all of the intelligence prior to 9/11 that signaled a major attack was coming, and his capture yielded a great deal of important information."<ref name="SuskindBlitzer">[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0606/20/sitroom.02.html ''Transcript for THE SITUATION ROOM with Wolf Blitzer''] CNN, June 20, 2006</ref> 

In his 2007 memoir, former [[Director of Central Intelligence|CIA Director]] [[George Tenet]] writes:
<blockquote>
A published report in 2006 contended that Abu Zubaydah was mentally unstable and that the administration had overstated his importance. Baloney. Abu Zubaydah had been at the crossroads of many al-Qa'ida operations and was in position to – and did – share critical information with his interrogators. Apparently, the source of the rumor that Abu Zubaydah was unbalanced was his personal diary, in which he adopted various personas. From that shaky perch, some junior Freudians leapt to the conclusion that Zubaydah had multiple personalities. In fact, Agency psychiatrists eventually determined that in his diary he was using a sophisticated literary device to express himself. And, boy, did he express himself.<ref name="GeorgeTenet">George Tenet, ''At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA,'' HarperCollins, 2007</ref></blockquote>

==Changing depiction of Abu Zubaydah==
When Abu Zubaydah was captured, the Bush Administration believed he was an unparalleled source of intelligence on al-Qaeda and terrorism plots. He was touted as the biggest catch of the War on Terror until the capture of [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]].<ref name="9/11MastermindNabbed">[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/02/terror/main542459.shtml ''Alleged 9-11 Mastermind Nabbed''] CBS News, March 1, 2003</ref> The director of the FBI stated Abu Zubaydah’s capture would help deter future attacks.<ref name="NewsSummary">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE5DB1E3AF937A35757C0A9649C8B63 ''NEWS SUMMARY: Arrest May Deter Attacks''].

===U.S. government accounts of Abu Zubaydah's importance===
As was later reported in 2009, the U.S. government overestimated Zubaydah's importance. Justice Department Officials said in 2009, he was "[t]he above ground support... To make him the mastermind of anything is ridiculous",<ref name="FinnAndWarrick"/> a "personnel clerk",<ref name="ScottShaneDivisionsArose">[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/18/world/middleeast/18zubaydah.html?ref=global-home Scott Shane, "Divisions Arose on Rough Tactics for Qaeda Figure"], ''The New York Times'', 17 April 2009</ref> a "logistics chief",<ref name="ConyersTranscript">[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-33608853_ITM "Transcript of Representative John Conyers Jr. Hearing on C.I.A.’s Destruction of Tapes"], Political/Congressional Transcript Wire, 20 December 2007 (Access My Library Link, requires free membership)</ref> and a "travel agent."<ref name="SuskindOnePercent"/> The CIA reportedly told Zubaydah during his interrogation that they had learned he was not an al-Qaeda fighter, partner, or even a member.<ref name="PeterFinnJulieTate">Peter Finn and Julie Tate [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/15/AR2009061503045.html?hpid=moreheadlines "CIA Mistaken on 'High-Value' Detainee, Document Shows"], ''The Washington Post'', 16 June 2009</ref>

Numerous anonymous U.S. officials also made allegations against Abu Zubaydah in the press.

While Zubaydah provided important intelligence, his value as an intel source was greatly inflated by the administration, much like his role in the global terror network. The U.S. Government has not officially charged Abu Zubaydah with any crimes.<ref name="CurrentChargeSheets">[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissions.html Department of Defense Military Commissions Cases Website], April 30, 2009</ref>

===Exploitation of Abu Zubaydah's perceived value===
President Bush personally used Abu Zubaydah’s perceived “value” as a detainee to justify the use of the CIA's harsher interrogation techniques<ref name="Bush092006Speech">[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/06/washington/06bush_transcript.html?pagewanted=all ''George W. Bush September 2006 Speech''] September 2006</ref> as well as Abu Zubaydah’s detention in secret CIA prisons around the world.<ref name="BushConcedesCIA">[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5776107 ''Bush Concedes CIA Held Suspects in Secret Prisons''] NPR, September 6, 2006</ref>

In a speech in 2006, President Bush claimed that Abu Zubaydah revealed useful intelligence when enhanced interrogation was used, including identification of two important suspects and information that allegedly helped foil a terrorist attack on American soil.<ref name="Bush092006Speech"/> These claims directly conflict with the reports of the F.B.I. agents who first interrogated Abu Zubaydah. He gave them the names before torture was used, and the third piece of information came from other sources.  who had been receiving crucial pieces of information from him without the use of harsher techniques,<ref name=mayer/><ref name="SoufanOpEd"/><ref name="SoufanNewsweek"/> as well as other government officials.<ref name="FinnAndWarrick"/><ref name="NYTimesProfileZubaydah">[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/z/abu_zubaydah/index.html "Abu Zubaydah"], ''New York Times'', April 20, 2009</ref>

====Iraq War (2003)====
The Bush administration relied on some of Zybaydah's claims in justifying the invasion of Iraq. U.S. officials stated that the allegations that Iraq and al-Qaeda were linked in the training of people on chemical weapons came from Abu Zubaydah.<ref name="HutchesonAndKuhnhenn">[http://www2.jsonline.com/news/nat/sep02/83149.asp Ron Hutcheson and James Kuhnhenn, "Iraq deal with Congress nears, Bush says"], ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,'' September 26, 2002</ref><ref name="BushSaysIraq">[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7430560_ITM "Bush Says He and Congress Will Band Together on Iraq; Capitol Hill Still Sour"], ''Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News,'' September 27, 2002 (Access My Library Link, requires free membership)</ref><ref name="TorturedLie">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/andrew_sullivan/article6168270.ece [[Andrew Sullivan]], "One tortured lie: that's all it took for war"], ''The Sunday Times,'' April 26, 2009</ref> The officials noted there was no independent verification of his claims.<ref name="HutchesonAndKuhnhenn"/><ref name="BushSaysIraq"/> 

The U.S. Government included statements made by Abu Zubaydah in regards to al Qaeda’s ability to obtain a dirty bomb to show a link between Iraq and al Qaeda.<ref name="FritzUmbach">[http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/04/13/document_dump/ Fritz Umbach, "Bush’s bogus document dump"], ''Salon,'' 13 April 2006</ref> According to a Senate Intelligence Committee report of 2004, Abu Zubaydah said "he had heard that an important al Qaeda associate, [[Abu Musab al Zarqawi]], and others had good relationships with Iraqi intelligence."<ref name="StephenHayes">[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/803czhfn.asp?pg=2 Stephen F. Hayes, "The Rice Stuff?"], ''The Daily Standard,'' October 20, 2004</ref> But the year before in June 2003, Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed were reported as saying there was no link between [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[al Qaeda]].<ref name="DiamondAndNichols">John Diamond and Bill Nichols [http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-06-08-cia-usat_x.htm "CIA in spotlight over reports leading to war"], 8  June 2003</ref><ref name="JamesRisen">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4D61539F93AA35755C0A9659C8B63 James Risen, "THREATS AND RESPONSES: C.I.A.; Captives Deny Qaeda Worked With Baghdad"], ''The New York Times'', 9 June 2003</ref>

In the Senate Armed Services Committee 2008 report on the abuses of detainees, the Bush administration was described as having applied pressure to interrogators to find a link between Iraq and Al-Qaeda prior to the Iraq War.<ref name="BanalityOfBush">[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/opinion/26rich.html Frank Rich, "The Banality of Bush White House Evil"], ''The New York Times'', 25 April 2009</ref> Major Paul Burney, a psychiatrist with the United States Army, said to the committee, "while we were [at Guantanamo] a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between Al Qaeda and Iraq and we were not being successful."<ref name="BanalityOfBush"/><ref name="ArmedServicesDetaineeReport">[http://armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf Senate Armed Services Committee, ''Inquiry Into the Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody''], Senate Armed Services Committee, 20 November 2008</ref> He said that higher-ups were "frustrated" and applied "more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results."<ref name="BanalityOfBush"/><ref name="ArmedServicesDetaineeReport"/><ref name="EdBrayton">[http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2009/05/the_lies_on_torture_just_keep.php Ed Brayton, "The Lies on Torture Just Keep Coming"], ''Science'' Blogs, 4 May 2009</ref>

Colonel Lawrence B. Wilkerson, the former chief of staff for former Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] has said:
<blockquote>
"Likewise, what I have learned is that as the administration authorized harsh interrogation in April and May of 2002—well before the Justice Department had rendered any legal opinion—its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at pre-empting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al-Qa'ida.

So furious was this effort that on one particular detainee, even when the interrogation team had reported to Cheney's office that their detainee "was compliant" (meaning the team recommended no more torture), the VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods. The detainee had not revealed any al-Qa'ida-Baghdad contacts yet. This ceased only after Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, under waterboarding in Egypt, "revealed" such contacts. Of course later we learned that al-Libi revealed these contacts only to get the torture to stop."<ref name=ArmedServicesDetaineeReport/></blockquote>

====Military Commissions Act (2006)====
President Bush referred to Abu Zubaydah in a speech to Congress September 2006 requesting a bill to authorize [[military commissions]], following the [[US Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' (2006) that held the tribunals as formulated by the executive branch were unconstitutional. Congress rapidly passed legislation that was signed by the president.<ref name="WarrenRichey">[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0915/p01s02-usju.html?s=widep Warren Richey, "‘Alternative’ CIA tactics complicate Padilla case"], ''Christian Science Monitor,'' September 15, 2006</ref> 

Less than one month after Abu Zubaydah’s capture, Justice Department officials said Abu Zubaydah was "a near-ideal candidate for a tribunal trial.”<ref name="NeilALewis">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E2DE103FF932A15757C0A9649C8B63 Neail A. Lewis ''A NATION CHALLENGED: THE DETAINEES; U.S. Is Seeking Basis to Charge War Detainees'']. ''New York Times'', April 21, 2002</ref> Several months later in 2002, US officials said there was “no rush” to try Abu Zubaydah via military commission.<ref name="FrankDavies">[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8932707_ITM Frank Davies, "U.S. readies tribunals for terrorism trials"], ''The Miami Herald,'' December 26, 2002</ref> 

The U.S. Government has not yet charged Abu Zubaydah.

===Domestic spying program===
According to reporting in 2005, the Bush administration used Abu Zubaydah’s capture as justification to accelerate development of its domestic spying program to allow quick action on the phone numbers and addresses seized.<ref name="RisenAndLichtblau">[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/12/16/news/spy.php?page=2 James Risen and Eric Lichtblau, "Bush altered rules on spying"], ''International Herald Tribune'', December 17, 2005</ref> The NSA expanded its surveillance beyond the numbers seized during Zubaydah’s capture.<ref name="AzizHug">[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-26038899_ITM Aziz Huq, "Who’s watching whom?"], League of Women Voters, 1 October 2006</ref> The spying program was later revamped in order to make it comply to legal opinion.<ref name=mayer/>

===Growing concerns about Abu Zubaydah's indefinite CIA detention===
In 2004 media coverage of Abu Zubaydah began listing him as a “disappeared” prisoner, claiming he had no access to the International Red Cross.<ref name="ReedBrody">[http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/11/opinion/edbrody.php Reed Brody ''Prisoners who disappear'']. ''International Herald Tribune'', October 12, 2004</ref> In February 2005, the CIA was reported as uncomfortable keeping Abu Zubaydah in indefinite custody.<ref name="JehlAndJohnstonAndLewis">Douglas Jehl, David Johnston, and Neil A. Lewis [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-105455175.html "CIA called uncomfortable with role on war prisoners Holding terror suspects raises concerns"], ''International Herald Tribune'', February 16, 2005</ref> Less than 18 months later, Abu Zubaydah and the thirteen other high-value detainees who had been in secret CIA custody were transferred to the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].<ref name="BartonGellman">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/19/AR2006061901211.html Barton Gellman, "The Shadow War, In a Surprising New Light"], ''Washington Post'', 20 June 2006, accessed 20 January 2013</ref>

After his transfer, the CIA denied access to Abu Zubaydah. In 2008, the Office of the [[Inspector General]], Department of Justice, complained that it had been prevented from seeing him, although it was conducting a study of the US treatment of its detainees.<ref name="EmmaSchwartz">[http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/2008/05/20/justice-dept-inspector-general-claims-cia-hampered-its-investigation.html Emma Schwartz, "Justice Dept. Inspector General Claims CIA Hampered its Investigation"], ''US News & World Report,'' 20 May 2008</ref>

===U.S. government admits Abu Zubaydah was never a member of al Qaeda===

But, in September 2009, the Obama administration acknowledged during Abu Zubaydah's ''[[habeas corpus]]'' petition, that Abu Zubaydah had never been a member of al-Qaeda, nor involved in the attacks on the African embassies in 1998, nor the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001 as exclusively reported by investigative reporter Jason Leopold http://www.consortiumnews.com/2010/040110a.html<ref name=GovernmentWithdrawsCharges>{{cite court

<blockquote>
Evidence indicating that Petitioner is not a member of al-Qaida or had ideological differences with al-Qaida is not inconsistent with the factual allegations made in the Government's factual return, because the Government has not contended in this proceeding that Petitioner was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida. Pg. 35, 36
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Respondent [The United States Government] does not contend that Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] was a "member" of al-Qaida in the sense of having sworn a <u>bayat</u> (allegiance) or having otherwise satisfied any formal criteria that either Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] or al-Qaida may have considered necessary for inclusion in al-Qaida. Nor is the Government detaining Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] based on any allegation that Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] views himself as part of al-Qaida as a matter of subjective personal conscience, ideology, or worldview.

<blockquote>
The Government has not contended in this proceeding that Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] had any direct role in or advance knowledge of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Pg. 82

<blockquote>
For example, for purposes of this proceeding the Government has not contended that Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executing either the 1998 embassy bombings... or the attacks on September 11, 2001. Pg. 34

====Charge sheet discrepancies====
In 2005, the U.S. Government charged several detainees at Guantanamo Bay and ordered them to stand trial in Military Commission Tribunals.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Of the ten detainees charged, four of them, Binyam Mohamed, Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi, Sufyian Barhoumi, and Jabrad Said bin Al-Qahtani referenced Abu Zubaydah in their charge sheets.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}<ref name="AlQahtani2005ChargeSheet">[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2005/d20051104qahtani.pdf ''Jabran Said bin Al-Qahtani 2005 Charge Sheet''] Department of Defense Website</ref><ref name="AlSharbi2005ChargeSheet">[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2005/d20051104sharbi.pdf ''Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi 2005 Charge Sheet''] Department of Defense Website</ref><ref name="Barhoumi2005ChargeSheet">[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2005/d20051104barhoumi.pdf ''Sufyian Barhoumi 2005 Charge Sheet''] Department of Defense Website</ref><ref name="Binyam2005ChargeSheet">[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2005/d20051104muhammad.pdf ''Binyam Mohamed 2005 Charge Sheet''] Department of Defense Website</ref>{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Three of the four detainees, Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi, Sufyian Barhoumi, and Jabran Said bin Al-Qahtani, had identical 2005 charge sheets and referenced Abu Zubaydah in six different paragraphs.<ref name="AlQahtani2005ChargeSheet"/><ref name="AlSharbi2005ChargeSheet"/><ref name="Barhoumi2005ChargeSheet"/> The fourth detainee, Binyam Mohamed, referenced Abu Zubaydah five times.<ref name="Binyam2005ChargeSheet"/>{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In 2006, before the U.S. Government could hold a trial of the four detainees in a Military Commission Tribunal, the Supreme Court struck down the Tribunals as unconstitutional in ''[[Hamdan v.

====International cases involving Abu Zubaydah====
Several individuals being held or tried internationally, who have been connected by the U.S. Government to Abu Zubaydah, have had their charges dropped, been released, or received other relief from their handlers.

=====Abousofian Abdelrazik=====
[[Abousofian Abdelrazik]] was alleged by the State Department to be closely associated with Abu Zubaydah.<ref name="BradFoss">[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-16119183_ITM Brad Foss ''State Department moves against Sudanese-Canadian for alleged terror ties''] The America’s Intelligence Wire, July 26, 2006</ref> In 2008, Canada asked the United Nations to remove Abousfian Abdelrazik from its terrorism watch-list.<ref name="PaulKoringOttawa">Paul Koring [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080502.SUDAN02/TPStory/Front&ord=123654973&brand=theglobeandmail&force_login=true ''Ottawa wants terrorism suspect taken off watch list''] Globe and Mail, February 5, 2008</ref> In June 2009, Canada agreed to repatriate Abousfian Abdelrazik from Sudan where he has been stranded since 2008.<ref name="MichaelComte">[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hUaf3TZSzmnZORHAtaID8uB1DNnw Michael Comte ''Canada will repatriate man said linked to Al-Qaeda''] AFP, June 18, 2009</ref>

=====Mohamed Harkat=====
Abu Zubaydah supposedly knew [[Mohamed Harkat]] “since the early 90’s”<ref name="PeterCheney">[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/front/RTGAM/20021218/wxalge1218/Front/homeBN/breakingnews Peter Cheney ''Bin Laden lieutenant identified suspect in Canada''] The Globe and Mail, December 18, 2002</ref> and claimed Harkat ran a guest house in Pakistan.<ref name="CanadaCourtUpholds">''Court upholds Harkat’s security certificate'' CTV News, March 22, 2005</ref> Mohamed Harkat’s attorney sought access to Abu Zubaydah for testimony relating to Harkat’s trial, but the US refused to respond to his requests.<ref name="HarkatLawyer">[http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Canada/2007/08/26/4448108.html ''Lawyer for accused terrorist seeks access to Guantanamo detainee''] Edmonton Sun, August 26, 2007</ref>

====Ahmed Ressam and the Millennium Plot====
In April 2001, Ahmed Ressam was convicted of plotting to detonate a bomb at the Los Angeles International Airport.<ref name="PBSAhmedRessam">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/trail/inside/cron.html |title=Amhed Ressam’s Millennium Plot |publisher=Pbs Frontline |date= |accessdate=2012-04-04}}</ref><ref name="RessamTestimony">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/trail/inside/testimony.html |title=Ahmed Ressam's Testimony at Mokhtar Haouari's Trial|publisher=PbS Frontline |date=1999-12-14 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}</ref> Ahmed Ressam had trained at the Khalden camp before coming to the United States to undertake his mission.<ref name="CsrtAbuZubaydahVerbatimTranscript"/><ref name="PBSAhmedRessam"/><ref name="RessamTestimony"/> 

Abu Zubaydah said in his [[CSRT]] testimony that he recommended to the leader of Khalden Camp that Ressam be allowed to train there.<ref name="CsrtAbuZubaydahVerbatimTranscript"/> Abu Zubaydah testified that he facilitated Ahmed Ressam’s travel to the camp, as well as to Algeria once Ressam’s training was complete.<ref name="CsrtAbuZubaydahVerbatimTranscript"/> The U.S. Government alleged, in Zubaydah’s summary of evidence, that Ressam identified Zubaydah as the leader of the Khalden camp and an associate of Usama Bin Laden “equal to and not subordinate to UBL.”<ref name="AbuZubaydahSummaryOfEvidence">[http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/csrt_arb/000784-000819.pdf "Abu Zubaydah Summary of Evidence"], Department of Defense</ref> The U.S. Government further alleged that Ressam said Zubaydah had “known of Ahmed Ressam’s operation, although not specifically the date and exact target” and that Zubaydah wanted Ressam to acquire “fraudulently-obtained Canadian passports” for himself and five others, in order to facilitate their travel into the United States to “possibly bomb several cities.”<ref name="AbuZubaydahSummaryOfEvidence"/>

Zubaydah said he tried to procure Canadian passports for Ressam and other trainees, but not for "terrorist-related activities.”.<ref name="CsrtAbuZubaydahVerbatimTranscript"/> Zubaydah denies ever having participated in the planning of the Millennium Plot or encouraging Ahmed Ressam to attack American targets or civilians.<ref name="CsrtAbuZubaydahVerbatimTranscript"/> This connection was not mentioned in Ressam's criminal trial.<ref name="RessamCaseDocs">Ressam Case Documents, Accessed via PACER, December 2008</ref> Ressam's confessions were referred to by his attorney at his sentencing to try to mitigate his sentence, and Ressam later recanted them.<ref name="RessamCaseDocs"/>

===Abu Zubaydah's mental health===
Some people are concerned about Abu Zubaydah's mental stability and how that has affected information he has given to interrogators. [[Ron Suskind]] noted in his book, ''[[The One Percent Doctrine]]: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11'' (2006), that Zubaydah was mentally ill or disabled due to a severe head injury. He described Zubaydah as keeping a diary "in the voice of three people: Hani 1, Hani 2, and Hani 3" – a boy, a young man and a middle-aged alter ego.<ref name="SuskindOnePercent"/> Abu Zubaydah's diaries spanned ten years and recorded in numbing detail "what he ate, or wore, or trifling things [people] said."<ref name="EggenPincusFBICIADebate"/> Dan Coleman, then the FBI's top al-Qaeda analyst, told a senior bureau official, "This guy is insane, certifiable, split personality."<ref name="SuskindOnePercent"/> According to Suskind, this judgment was "echoed at the top of CIA and was briefed to the President and Vice President."<ref name="SuskindOnePercent"/> Coleman stated Zubaydah was a "safehouse keeper" with mental problems, who "claimed to know more about al-Qaeda and its inner workings than he really did."<ref name="EggenPincusFBICIADebate"/> 

Joseph Margulies, Abu Zubaydah's co-counsel, wrote in an OpEd in the ''LA Times'':
<blockquote>"Partly as a result of injuries he suffered while he was fighting the communists in Afghanistan, partly as a result of how those injuries were exacerbated by the CIA and partly as a result of his extended isolation, Abu Zubaydah's mental grasp is slipping away. Today, he suffers blinding headaches and has permanent brain damage. He has an excruciating sensitivity to sounds, hearing what others do not. The slightest noise drives him nearly insane. In the last two years alone, he has experienced about 200 seizures. Already, he cannot picture his mother's face or recall his father's name. Gradually, his past, like his future, eludes him."<ref name="MarguliesZubaydah">[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-margulies30-2009apr30,0,3309097.story Joseph Margulies, "Abu Zubaydah's suffering"], ''Los Angeles Times'', April 30, 2009</ref></blockquote>

==Saudi and Pakistani connection allegations==
[[Gerald Posner]] in his book, ''Why America Slept: The Failure to Prevent 9/11'' (2003) claimed that Abu Zubaydah was duped by U.S. interrogators masquerading as Saudis and using painkillers and [[sodium pentathol]], sometimes called "truth serum". Zubaydah, he writes, thought he was in a Saudi prison, when in fact he was in Afghanistan. Posner says Zubaydah, "relieved" to find he was being quizzed by people he thought were Saudis, provided them with phone numbers for a senior member of the Saudi royal family who would "tell you what to do." The numbers were traced to Prince [[Ahmed bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz]], a nephew of [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]]. 

When the agents accused Zubaydah of lying, he revealed more details of Saudi and Pakistani ties to bin Laden, Posner said. The CIA passed on the information to the related governments. In the space of one week, three of the four persons named by him were dead. Prince Ahmed, 43, died of a heart attack on July 22, 2002. The next day, a car crash killed Saudi Prince [[Sultan bin Faisal bin Turki al-Saud]], 41. A week later, Prince [[Fahd bin Turki bin Saud al-Kabir]], 25, reportedly died "of thirst" while traveling east of [[Riyadh]]. Seven months later, a plane crash killed Pakistani Air Marshal [[Mushaf Ali Mir]], his wife and several aides in Pakistan. Posner acknowledged these events could have been coincidences.<ref>{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Pyle |title=Did Saudis know of 9–11 plot? |work=Associated Press, Newsday|date=3 September 2003}}</ref>
