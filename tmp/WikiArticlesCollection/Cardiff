The city is the country's chief commercial centre, the base for most national cultural and sporting institutions, the Welsh national media, and the seat of the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. The [[Unitary authorities of Wales|unitary authority area]]'s mid-2011 population was estimated to be 346,100, while the population of the [[Larger Urban Zone]] was estimated at 861,400 in 2009.

The city of Cardiff is the [[county town]] of the [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Glamorgan]] (and later [[South Glamorgan]]). Cardiff is part of the [[Eurocities]] network of the largest European cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurocities.org/|title=Eurocities|accessdate=20 May 2008}}</ref> The [[Cardiff Urban Area]] covers a slightly larger area outside of the county boundary, and includes the towns of [[Dinas Powys]] and [[Penarth]]. A small town until the early 19th century, its prominence as a [[port|major port]] for the transport of coal following the arrival of industry in the region contributed to its rise as a major city.

Cardiff was made a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] in 1905, and proclaimed the [[capital of Wales]] in 1955. Since the 1990s, Cardiff has seen significant development. A new waterfront area at [[Cardiff Bay]] contains the [[Senedd]] building, home to the Welsh Assembly and the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] arts complex. Current developments include the continuation of the redevelopment of the Cardiff Bay and city centre areas with projects such as the [[Cardiff International Sports Village]], a [[Roath Lock|BBC drama village]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Proposed BBC Drama Village at Media Capital, Roath Basin|url=http://wales.gov.uk/publications/accessinfo/drnewhomepage/economicdrs/2010/bbcdramavillage/?lang=en|publisher=Welsh Assembly Government|accessdate=6 April 2011|date=14 December 2009}}</ref> and a new business district in the city centre.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cardiff Business District 'needs skills and transport'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-12905961|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=6 April 2011|date=30 March 2011}}</ref>

Sporting venues in the city include the [[Millennium Stadium]] (the national stadium for the [[Wales national rugby union team]] and the [[Wales national football team]]), [[SWALEC Stadium]] (the home of [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club]]), [[Cardiff City Stadium]] (the home of [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City football team]]), [[Cardiff International Sports Stadium]] (the home of [[Cardiff Amateur Athletic Club]]) and [[Cardiff Arms Park]] (the home of [[Cardiff Blues]] and [[Cardiff RFC]] rugby union teams). The city is also HQ of the [[Wales Rally GB]] and was awarded with the European City of Sport in 2009 due to its role in hosting major international sporting events. It has been announced that Cardiff will again be the European City of Sport in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|title=City takes European sports capital title for 2014|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-news/2011/04/01/city-takes-european-sports-capital-title-for-2014-91466-28440348/|accessdate=6 April 2011|newspaper=South Wales Echo|date=1 April 2011}}</ref> The Millennium Stadium hosted 11 football matches as part of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], including the games' opening event and the men's bronze medal match.<ref>{{cite news|title=Olympic football in Cardiff|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-12905961|publisher=Visit Cardiff|accessdate=6 April 2011|date=30 March 2011}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
[[File:Cardiff Castle (Roman wall).jpg|thumb|left|The front wall of [[Cardiff Castle]], showing part of the original Roman fort from which the city may have derived its name.]]
''Caerdydd'' (the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name of the city) derives from the earlier Welsh form ''Caerdyf''. The change from ''-dyf'' to ''-dydd'' shows the colloquial alteration of Welsh ''f'' {{IPA-cy|v|}} and ''dd'' {{IPA-cy|ð|}}, and was perhaps also driven by [[folk etymology]] (''dydd'' is Welsh for 'day' whereas ''dyf'' has no obvious meaning). This [[sound change]] had probably first occurred in the [[Middle Ages]]; both forms were current in the [[Tudor period]]. ''Caerdyf'' has its origins in [[Sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman]] [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] words meaning "the fort of the [[River Taff|Taff]]". The [[Cardiff Roman Fort|fort]] probably refers to that established by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. ''Caer'' is Welsh for ''fort'' and ''-dyf'' is in effect a form of ''Taf'' (Taff), the river which flows by Cardiff Castle, with the {{angle bracket|t}} showing [[consonant mutation]] to {{angle bracket|d}} and the vowel showing [[Affection (linguistics)|affection]] as a result of a (lost) [[genitive case]] ending.<ref name=hwo>Hywel Wyn Owen and Richard Morgan, ''Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales''. University of Wales Press, 2007, ISBN 1-84323-901-9, p. 70.</ref>

The [[anglicisation|anglicised]] form ''Cardiff'' is derived from ''Caerdyf'', with the Welsh ''f'' {{IPA-cy|v|}} borrowed as ''ff'' {{IPAc-en|f}}, as also happens in ''Taff'' (from Welsh ''Taf'') and ''[[Llandaff]]'' (from Welsh ''Llandaf''). As English does not have the vowel {{IPA-cy|ɨ|}} the final vowel has been borrowed as /ɪ/.  

The antiquarian [[William Camden]] (1551–1623) suggested that the name Cardiff may derive from "Caer-Didi" ("the Fort of Didius"), a name supposedly given in honour of [[Aulus Didius Gallus]], governor of a nearby province at the time when the Roman fort was established. Although some sources repeat this theory, it has been rejected on linguistic grounds by modern scholars such as Professor Gwynedd Pierce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/videoexplorer/pages/?jumpTo=cardiff|title=What's In A Name? – Cardiff|last=Pierce|first=Gwynedd O|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=17 July 2008}}</ref>

Until the [[Roman conquest of Britain]], Cardiff was part of the territory of the [[Silures]] – a [[Iron Age tribes in Britain|Celtic British tribe]] that flourished in the [[Iron Age]] – whose territory included the areas that would become known as [[Breconshire]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] and Glamorgan.<ref name="Wales Hist 1">{{cite book|last=Davies|first=John|authorlink=John Davies (historian)|title=A History of Wales|publisher=Penguin|year=1994|location=London|pages=17–18|isbn=0-14-014581-8}}</ref> The {{convert|3.2|ha|acre|0|adj=on}} [[Cardiff Roman Fort|fort]] established by the [[Roman army|Romans]] near the mouth of the River Taff in 75 AD, in what would become the north western boundary of the centre of Cardiff, was built over an extensive settlement that had been established by the Silures in the 50s AD.<ref name="Coflein 2">{{cite web

Little is known about the fort and civilian settlement in the period between the Roman departure from Britain and the Norman Conquest. Historian William Rees suggests that the settlement probably shrank in size and may even have been abandoned. In the absence of Roman rule, Wales was divided into small kingdoms; early on, [[Meurig ap Tewdrig]] emerged as the local king in [[Glywysing]] (which later became Glamorgan). The area passed through his family until the advent of the Normans in the 11th century.<ref>{{cite book

=== Building of the docks ===
[[File:Cardiff Docks.jpg|thumb|[[Tiger Bay|Cardiff Docks]]—from where coal was shipped throughout the world]]
In 1793, [[John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute]] was born. He would spend his life building the Cardiff docks and would later be called "the creator of modern Cardiff".<ref name="Cardiffians"/> A twice-weekly boat service between Cardiff and [[Bristol]] was established in 1815,<ref name="Bob Sanders 2"/> and in 1821, the Cardiff Gas Works was established.<ref name="Bob Sanders 2"/>

After the Napoleonic Wars Cardiff entered a period of social and industrial unrest, starting with the trial and hanging of [[Dic Penderyn]] in 1831.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The town grew rapidly from the 1830s onwards, when the [[John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute|Marquess of Bute]] built a [[dock (maritime)|dock]], which eventually linked to the [[Taff Vale Railway]]. Cardiff became the main port for exports of coal from the [[Cynon Valley|Cynon]], [[Rhondda]], and [[Rhymney Valley|Rhymney]] valleys, and grew at a rate of nearly 80% per decade between 1840 and 1870. Much of the growth was due to [[human migration|migration]] from within and outside Wales: in 1841, a quarter of Cardiff's population were English-born and more than 10% had been born in Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Leary|first=Paul|title=Irish Migrants in Modern Wales|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year=2004|page=14|isbn=978-0-85323-858-4|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qkCmYNMVMxwC&printsec=frontcover#PPA14,M1|accessdate=2 October 2008}}</ref> By the 1881 census, Cardiff had overtaken both Merthyr and Swansea to become the largest town in Wales.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Francis Michael Longstreth|title=The Cambridge Social History of Britain, 1750–1950|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=311|isbn=978-0-521-43816-2|year=1993|url=http://books.google.com/?id=eozO2RzSAVUC&pg=PA311&lpg=PA311}}</ref> Cardiff's new status as the premier town in South Wales was confirmed when it was chosen as the site of the [[University of Wales|University College South Wales and Monmouthshire]] in 1893.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Wales"/>

Cardiff faced a challenge in the 1880s when [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies of Llandinam]] and the [[Barry Railway Company]] promoted the development of rival docks at [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]]. Barry docks had the advantage of being accessible in all [[tide]]s, and David Davies claimed that his venture would cause "grass to grow in the streets of Cardiff". From 1901 coal exports from Barry surpassed those from Cardiff, but the administration of the coal trade remained centred on Cardiff, in particular its [[Coal Exchange]], where the price of coal on the British market was determined and the first million-pound deal was struck in 1907.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Wales"/> The city also strengthened its industrial base with the decision of the owners of the [[Dowlais Ironworks]] in Merthyr (who would later form part of [[GKN|Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds]]) to build a new [[steel mill|steelworks]] close to the docks at East Moors, which Lord Bute opened on 4 February 1891.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archivesnetworkwales.info/cgi-bin/anw/fulldesc_nofr?inst_id=33&coll_id=77663&expand=|title=East Moors Steelworks, Cardiff collection (record of information achival)|date=1 February 2006|publisher=Glamorgan Records Office|accessdate=2 October 2008}}</ref>

=== City and capital city status ===
[[File:Welsh National War Memorial - geograph.org.uk - 904583.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Welsh National War Memorial]]]]
[[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] granted Cardiff [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] on 28 October 1905,<ref>{{cite book|last=Beckett|first=J.V.|title=City Status in the British Isles, 1830–2002|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd|year=2005|page=2|isbn=978-0-7546-5067-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=jqqSSOyjBEoC&pg=PP8&lpg=PP1|accessdate=2 October 2008}}</ref> and the city acquired a Roman Catholic Cathedral in 1916. In subsequent years an increasing number of national institutions were located in the city, including the [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum of Wales]], [[Welsh National War Memorial]], and the [[University of Wales]] Registry Building—however, it was denied the [[National Library of Wales]], partly because the library's founder, Sir John Williams, considered Cardiff to have "a non-Welsh population".<ref name="Encyclopedia of Wales"/>

After a brief post-war boom, Cardiff docks entered a prolonged decline in the [[interwar period]]. By 1936, their trade was less than half its value in 1913, reflecting the slump in demand for [[South Wales coalfield|Welsh coal]].<ref name="Encyclopedia of Wales"/> Bomb damage during the [[Cardiff Blitz]] in World War II included the devastation of [[Llandaff Cathedral]], and in the immediate postwar years the city's link with the Bute family came to an end.

[[File:Amgueddfa Genedlaethol Caerdydd.JPG|thumb|right|[[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum of Wales, Cardiff]]]]
The city was proclaimed capital city of Wales on 20 December 1955, by a written reply by the [[Home Secretary]] [[Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby|Gwilym Lloyd George]]. [[Caernarfon]] had also vied for this title.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cardiff as Capital of Wales: Formal Recognition by Government|publisher=The Times|date=21 December 1955}}</ref> Cardiff therefore celebrated two important [[anniversary|anniversaries]] in 2005. The Encyclopedia of Wales notes that the decision to recognise the city as the capital of Wales "had more to do with the fact that it contained marginal [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] constituencies than any reasoned view of what functions a Welsh capital should have". Although the city hosted the [[Commonwealth Games]] in 1958, Cardiff only became a centre of national administration with the establishment of the [[Welsh Office]] in 1964, which later prompted the creation of various other public bodies such as the [[Arts Council of Wales]] and the [[Welsh Development Agency]], most of which were based in Cardiff.

The East Moors Steelworks closed in 1978 and Cardiff lost population during the 1980s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10150530&c_id=10001043&add=N|title=Cardiff Wales Through Time – Population Statistics|accessdate=20 May 2008}}</ref> consistent with a wider pattern of [[counter urbanisation]] in Britain.

In the 1997 [[devolution]] [[referendum]], Cardiff voters rejected the establishment of the National Assembly for Wales by 55.4% to 44.2% on a 47% turnout, which Denis Balsom partly ascribed to a general preference in Cardiff and some other parts of Wales for a 'British' rather than exclusively [[Welsh people|'Welsh']] [[national identity|identity]].<ref>Balsom, Denis.

The city was [[county town]] of Glamorgan until the council reorganisation in 1974 paired Cardiff and the now [[Vale of Glamorgan]] together as the new county of [[South Glamorgan]]. Further local government restructuring in 1996 resulted in Cardiff city's [[Districts of Wales|district]] council becoming a [[unitary authority]], the [[Cardiff Council|City and County of Cardiff]], with the addition of Creigiau and [[Pentyrch]].

All of the city's residents have an extra vote for the [[South Wales Central]] region which increases proportionality to the Assembly. The most recent Welsh Assembly general election were held on [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2011|5 May 2011]].

In the Assembly Cardiff is represented by Jenny Rathbone (Labour) in [[Cardiff Central (Assembly constituency)|Cardiff Central]], [[Julie Morgan]] (Labour) in [[Cardiff North (Assembly constituency)|Cardiff North]], [[Vaughan Gething]] (Labour) in [[Cardiff South and Penarth (Assembly constituency)|Cardiff South and Penarth]] and Mark Drakeford (Labour) in [[Cardiff West (Assembly constituency)|Cardiff West]].

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Cardiff}}
The centre of Cardiff is relatively flat and is bounded by hills on the outskirts to the east, north and west. Its geographic features were influential in its development as the world's largest coal port, most notably its proximity and easy access to the coal fields of the south Wales valleys. The highest point in the authority is [[Garth Hill]] {{convert|307|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

[[File:View over Cardiff.jpg|thumb|Cardiff, looking south]]

Cardiff is built on reclaimed marshland on a bed of [[Triassic]] stones; this reclaimed marshland stretches from [[Chepstow]] to the [[Ely Estuary]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=7004|title=Cardiff Supplementary Planning Guidance: Archaeologically Sensitive Areas|date=20 July 2006|publisher=Cardiff County Council|accessdate=1 October 2008|format=PDF}}</ref> which is the natural boundary of Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. Triassic landscapes of this part of the world are usually shallow and low-lying which accounts and explains the flatness of the centre of Cardiff.<ref>{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Discussion on palaeoecology of the Late Triassic extinction event in the SW UK|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|publisher=Geological Society of London|volume=165|issue=5|pages=988–992|url=http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/cgi/content/full/165/5/988|accessdate=1 October 2008|doi=10.1144/0016-76492008-014|last1=Radley|first1=J.

J.|last3=Mander|first3=L.|last4=Cope|first4=J.C.W}}</ref> The classic Triassic [[marl]], [[sand]] and [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks are used predominantly throughout Cardiff as building materials. Many of these Triassic rocks have a purple complexion, especially the coastal [[marl]] found near Penarth. One of the Triassic rocks used in Cardiff is "Radyr Stone", a [[freestone (masonry)|freestone]] which as it name suggests is quarried in the Radyr district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englishstone.org.uk/documents/dimension%20stone%208.html|title=Triassic building sandstone resources|accessdate=7 July 2008}}</ref> Cardiff has also imported some materials for buildings: [[Devonian]] sandstones (the [[Old Red Sandstone]]) from the [[Brecon Beacons]] has been used. Most famously, the buildings of [[Cathays Park]], the civic centre in the centre of the city, are built of [[Portland stone]] which was imported from Dorset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swga.org.uk/pdf/CathaysPark.pdf|format=PDF|title=Geological Walks in Wales: Cathays Park|publisher=Geologists Association South Wales|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref> A widely used building stone in Cardiff is the yellow-grey [[Early Jurassic|Liassic]] [[limestone]] rock of the Vale of Glamorgan, including the very rare "Sutton Stone", a conglomerate of lias limestone and [[carboniferous]] limestone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.castlewales.com/morgraig.html|title=Castell Morgraig|last=Iowerth|first=Dylan|publisher=Castle Studies Group|year=1998|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref>

Cardiff is bordered to the west by the rural district of the Vale of Glamorgan—also known as The Garden of Cardiff—<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenofcardiff.com/|title=The Garden of Cardiff|accessdate=20 May 2008}}</ref> to the east by the city of Newport, to the north by the [[South Wales Valleys]] and to the south by the [[River Severn|Severn Estuary]] and [[Bristol Channel]]. The River Taff winds through the centre of the city and together with the [[River Ely]] flows into the freshwater lake of Cardiff Bay. A third river, the [[Rhymney River|Rhymney]] flows through the east of the city entering directly into the Severn Estuary.

Cardiff is situated near the [[Glamorgan]] [[Heritage Coast]], stretching westward from Penarth and Barry—[[commuter town]]s of Cardiff—with striped yellow-blue Jurassic limestone cliffs. The Glamorgan coast is the only part of the [[Celtic Sea]] that has exposed [[Jurassic]] ([[blue lias]]) geology. This stretch of coast, which has reefs, sandbanks and serrated cliffs, was a [[ship graveyard]]; ships sailing up to Cardiff during the industrial era often never made it as far as Cardiff as many were wrecked around this hostile coastline during west/south-westerly gales. Consequently, smuggling, deliberate shipwrecking and attacks on ships were common.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kenfig.org.uk/smuggling.html|title=Smuggling Around Kenfig|publisher=Kenfig.org|accessdate=19 April 2008}}</ref>

Official estimates derived from the census regarding the city's total population have been disputed. The city council has published two articles that argue the 2001 census seriously under reports the population of Cardiff and, in particular, the ethnic minority population of some inner city areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=3418&Language=|title=Cardiff Council Representations to ONS on the 2001 Census: Section 1|format=PDF|accessdate=28 December 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=3419&Language=|title=Cardiff Council Representations to ONS on the 2001 Census: Section 2|format=PDF|accessdate=28 December 2007}}</ref>

Cardiff has an ethnically diverse population due to its past trading connections, post-war immigration and the large numbers of foreign students who attend university in the city. The ethnic make-up of Cardiff's population at the time of the 2011 census was: 84.7% White, 1.6% mixed White and Black African/Caribbean, 0.7% mixed White and Asian, 0.6% mixed other, 8% Asian, 2.4% Black, 1.4% Arab and 0.6% other ethnic groups.<ref>{{cite web|last=Statistics|first=Neighbourhood|title=Demography: Cardiff Ethnicity|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=6275349&c=Cardiff&d=13&e=62&g=6497663&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1359926795372&enc=1&dsFamilyId=2477|work=2011 Census Key Statistics|publisher=ONS (Office for National Statistics)|accessdate=3 February 2013}}</ref>  This means that almost 53,000 people from a non-white ethnic group reside in the city. This diversity, and especially that of the city's long-established African and Arab communities, has been celebrated in a number of cultural exhibitions and events, along with a number of books which have been published on this subject.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Brian|title=Butetown and Cardiff Docks|publisher=The History Press|date=15 April 1999|isbn=978-0-7524-1582-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhac.org/black_history.html|title=Black History in Butetown|publisher=Butetown History & Arts Centre|accessdate=18 April 2008}}</ref>

=== Language ===
{{See also|Cardiff dialect}}

Cardiff has a chequered linguistic history with [[Welsh language|Welsh]], English, [[Latin]], [[Old Norse|Norse]] and [[Norman language|Norman]] preponderant at different times. Welsh was the majority language in Cardiff from the 13th century until the city's explosive growth in the [[Victorian era]].<ref name="welsh">{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Geraint H.|title=The Welsh Language before the Industrial Revolution|location=Cardiff|year=1997|isbn=978-0-7083-1418-0}}</ref> As late as 1850, five of the 12 [[Anglican]] churches within the current city boundaries conducted their services exclusively in the [[Welsh language]], while only two worshipped exclusively in English.<ref name="welsh"/> By 1891, the percentage of Welsh speakers had dropped to 27.9% and only [[Lisvane]], [[Llanedeyrn]] and [[Creigiau]] remained as majority Welsh-speaking communities.<ref>{{cite book|title=Language and Community in the Nineteenth Century|first=Geraint H.|last=Jenkins|isbn=0-7083-1467-8|year=1998|publisher=Univ. of Wales Press|location=Cardiff}}</ref> The Welsh language became grouped around a small cluster of chapels and churches, the most notable of which is Tabernacl in the city centre, one of four UK churches chosen to hold official services to commemorate the new millennium. Following the establishment of the city's first Welsh School (Ysgol Gymraeg Bryntaf) in the 1950s, Welsh has slowly regained some ground.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2755217.stm|title=Census shows Welsh language rise|date=14 February 2003|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=19 April 2008}}</ref> Aided by Welsh-medium education and migration from other parts of Wales, the number of Welsh speakers in Cardiff rose by 14,451 between 1991 and 2001; Welsh is now spoken by 11% of Cardiffians. The highest percentage of Welsh speakers is in [[Pentyrch]], where 15.9% of the population speak the language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pentyrch.cc/dogfennau/Policies/WelshLanguagePolicy.doc|format=DOC|title=Welsh Language Scheme|date=11 February 1999|accessdate=2 April 2013|publisher=Pentyrch Community Council}}</ref>

In addition to English and Welsh, the diversity of Cardiff's population (including foreign students) means that a large number of languages are spoken within the city. One study has found that Cardiff has speakers of at least 94 languages, with [[Somali language|Somali]], [[Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] being the most commonly spoken foreign languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cilt.org.uk/pdf/pubs/positively_plurilingual.pdf|title=Positively Plurilingual|format=PDF|accessdate=3 January 2008}}</ref>

==== Language schools ====
Due to its diversity, large student population, and convenient size and location, Cardiff has seen a rise in the number of people coming to the city to learn English. Foreign students are a common sight on the streets of Cardiff with a large percentage coming from Arabic and other European countries.<ref name="2008 population" /> The [[British Council]] has an office in the city centre and there are six accredited schools in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/accreditation-az-list.htm|title=A-Z list of accredited centres}}</ref>

Since 1922 Cardiff has included the suburban cathedral 'village' of Llandaff, whose bishop is also [[Archbishop of Wales]] since 2002. There is also a [[Cardiff Cathedral|Roman Catholic cathedral]] in the city. Since 1916 Cardiff has been the seat of a Catholic archbishop, but there appears to have been a fall in the estimated Catholic population, with estimated numbers in 2006 being around 25,000 less than in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dcard.html#stats|title=Archdiocese of Cardiff – Statistics|accessdate=18 April 2008}}</ref> Likewise, the Jewish population of the city also appears to have fallen—there are two synagogues in Cardiff, one in Cyncoed and one in Moira Terrace, as opposed to seven at the turn of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/Community/Cardiff.htm|title=JCR-UK – Cardiff Community|date=14 October 2005|accessdate=23 January 2008}}</ref> There are a significant number of [[nonconformism|nonconformist]] chapels, an early-20th century Greek Orthodox church and 11 mosques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/GLA/Roath/Chapels.html|title=Cardiff, Llandaff & Roath chapels database|accessdate=23 January 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nostos.com/church/|title=The Greek Orthodox Church in Great Britain|accessdate=23 January 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimdirectory.co.uk/displayresults.php?PHPSESSID=f0fb8b41d8758983e7d43cddb556b9df&businesstype=1&orgtype=&country=UK&city=Cardiff|title=Muslim Directory – Mosques in Cardiff|accessdate=23 January 2008}}</ref> In the 2001 census 66.9% of Cardiff's population described itself as Christian, a percentage point below the Welsh and UK averages.

The oldest of the non-Christian communities in Wales is Judaism. Jews were not permitted to live in Wales between the 1290 [[Edict of Expulsion]]—given by [[Edward I of England]]—and the 17th century.

The proportion of Cardiff residents declaring themselves to be Hindu, Sikh and Jewish were all considerably higher than the Welsh averages, but less than the UK figures.

As the capital city of Wales, Cardiff is the main engine of growth in the Welsh economy. Though the population of Cardiff is about 10% of the Welsh population, the economy of Cardiff makes up nearly 20% of Welsh GDP and 40% of the city’s workforce are daily in-commuters from the surrounding south Wales area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/economic_trends/Sub-regional_&_Local_Area_GDP.pdf|title=Sub-regional and local area gross domestic product|last=Clifton-Fearnside|first=Alex|coauthors=Adam Douglas|date=14 May 2002|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=18 April 2008|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statswales.wales.gov.uk/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=4903&IF_Language=isl|title=Statistics on Commuting in Wales|date=5 December 2007|publisher=Statistics for Wales|accessdate=18 April 2008}}</ref>

Industry has played a major part in Cardiff's development for many centuries. The main catalyst for its transformation from a small town into a big city was the demand for coal required in making iron and later steel, brought to the sea by [[packhorse]] from [[Merthyr Tydfil]]. This was first achieved by the construction of a {{convert|25|mi|km|sing=on}} long canal from Merthyr (510 feet above sea-level) to the Taff Estuary at Cardiff.<ref name="canal">{{cite web|url=http://www.alangeorge.co.uk/the_glamorganshire_canal.htm|title=The Glamorganshire Canal|accessdate=19 April 2008}}</ref> Eventually the [[Taff Vale Railway]] replaced the canal barges and massive marshalling yards sprang up as new docks were developed in Cardiff – all prompted by the soaring worldwide demand for coal from the South Wales valleys.

{{Main|Cycling in Cardiff}}

The [[Taff Trail]] is a [[walkway|walking]] and [[cycle path]] running for {{convert|55|mi|km|1}} between Cardiff Bay and [[Brecon]] in the [[Brecon Beacons]] National Park. It runs through Bute Park, [[Sophia Gardens]] and many other green areas within Cardiff. It is possible to cycle the entire distance of the [[Trail]] almost completely off-road, as it largely follows the [[River Taff]] and many of the old disused railways of the Glamorganshire valleys. On Sundays in summer the Beacons Bike Bus enables cyclists to take their bikes into the Beacons and then ride back to Cardiff along the Trail.

Prior to the [[Big Number Change]] on 22 April 2000 the area had shorter, six-digit local numbers with an area code of 01222 (with 0222 preceding this, prior to May 1995). There remains a common misconception that local numbers are still six digits long and that the code is 02920, despite the existence of newer Cardiff numbers in the ranges (029) 21xx xxxx and (029) 22xx xxxx.

== Landmarks and attractions ==
[[File:Old Library.JPG|thumb|170px|[[Cardiff Story]]]]
[[File:MillenniumStadiumNorth.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Millennium Stadium]]]]
Cardiff has many landmark buildings such as the Millennium Stadium, [[Pierhead Building]] the Welsh National Museum and the Senedd, the home of the National Assembly for Wales. Cardiff is also famous for Cardiff Castle, [[St David's Hall]], [[Llandaff Cathedral]] and the [[Wales Millennium Centre]].

Cardiff Castle is a major tourist attraction in the city and is situated in the heart of the [[Cardiff city centre|city centre]]. The [[St Fagans National History Museum|National History Museum at St Fagans]] in Cardiff is a large open air museum housing dozens of buildings from throughout Welsh history that have been moved to the site in Cardiff. The Civic Centre in [[Cathays Park]] comprises a collection of [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] buildings such as the [[City Hall, Cardiff|City Hall]], [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum and Gallery of Wales]], [[Cardiff Crown Court]], and buildings forming part of Cardiff University, together with more modern civic buildings. These buildings surround a small green space containing the [[Welsh National War Memorial]] and a number of other smaller memorials.

In addition to Cardiff Castle, [[Castell Coch]] (''Red Castle'') is located in [[Tongwynlais]], in the north of the city. The current castle is an elaborately decorated Victorian [[folly]] designed by [[William Burges]] for the Marquess and built in the 1870s, as an occasional retreat. However, the Victorian castle stands on the footings of a much older medieval castle possibly built by [[Ifor Bach]], a regional baron with links to Cardiff Castle also. The exterior has become a popular location for film and television productions. It rarely fulfilled its intended role as a retreat for the Butes, who seldom stayed there. For the Marquess, the pleasure had been in its creation, a pleasure lost following Burges's death in 1881.
