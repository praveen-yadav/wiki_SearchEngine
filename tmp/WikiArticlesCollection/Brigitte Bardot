She was one of the best known [[sex symbol]]s of the 1950s and '60s. Starting in 1969, Bardot's features became the official face of [[Marianne]] (who had previously been anonymous) to represent the liberty of France.<ref name=Sohn>Anne-Marie Sohn (teacher at the [[École Normale Supérieure|ENS]]-Lyon), [http://hist-geo.ac-rouen.fr/doc/bls/2004/marian.htm Marianne ou l'histoire de l'idée républicaine aux XIXe et XXe siècles à la lumière de ses représentations] (résumé of Maurice Agulhon's three books, ''Marianne au combat'', ''Marianne au pouvoir'' and ''Les métamorphoses de Marianne'') {{fr icon}}</ref>

Bardot was an aspiring ballet dancer in early life. She started her acting career in 1952 and, after appearing in 16 obscure films, became world-famous in 1957 with the release of the controversial film ''[[And God Created Woman (1956 film)|And God Created Woman]]''. She later starred in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s 1963 film ''[[Contempt (film)|Le Mépris]]''. Bardot was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress]] for her role in [[Louis Malle]]'s 1965 film ''[[Viva Maria!]]''. Bardot caught the attention of French intellectuals. She was the subject of [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s 1959 essay, ''The Lolita Syndrome'', which described Bardot as a "locomotive of women's history" and built upon [[existentialist]] themes to declare her the first and most liberated woman of post-war France.<ref name=guardot/>

Bardot retired from the [[entertainment industry]] in 1973. During her career in show business, she starred in 47 films, performed in several musical shows, and recorded over 60 songs. She was awarded the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1985, but refused to receive it.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-big-question-how-does-the-french-honours-system-work-and-why-has-kylie-been-decorated-822752.html "The Big Question: How does the French honours system work, and why has Kylie been decorated?"] (8 May 2008)''The Independent''</ref> After her retirement, Bardot established herself as an [[animal rights]] activist.

==Early life==
Brigitte Bardot was born on 28 September 1934 in Paris to Louis Bardot (1896–1975) and Anne-Marie "Toty" Bardot (née Mucel; 1912–1978). Louis Bardot had an engineering degree and worked with his own father, Charles Bardot, in the family business. Louis and Anne-Marie married in 1933. Bardot grew up in a middle-class Roman Catholic observant home.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/sep/27/profile-brigitte-bardot-and-god-created-bardot|title=Profile: Brigitte Bardot – And God created Bardot|publisher=[[Sunday Tribune]]|date=27 September 2009|accessdate=19 September 2010|first=Valerie|last=Shanley}}</ref>

Brigitte's mother enrolled Brigitte and her younger sister, Marie-Jeanne (born 5 May 1938), in dance. Marie-Jeanne eventually gave up dancing lessons and did not tell her mother, whereas Brigitte concentrated on ballet. In 1947, Bardot was accepted to the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. For three years she attended ballet classes by Russian choreographer Boris Knyazev. One of her classmates was [[Leslie Caron]]. The other ballerinas nicknamed Bardot "Bichette" ("Little Doe").<ref>[[Leslie Caron|Caron, Leslie]]. ''Thank Heaven'', Plume Publishing (2009)<!-- isbn needed --></ref>

At the invitation of an acquaintance of her mother, she modelled in a fashion show in 1949. In the same year, she modelled for a fashion magazine "''Jardin des Modes''" managed by journalist Hélène Lazareff. Aged 15, she appeared on an 8 March 1950 cover of ''[[ELLE]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/830:112/1/Brigitte_Bardot.htm|title=Brigitte Bardot Biography|publisher=The Biography Channel|accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref> and was noticed by a young film director, [[Roger Vadim]], while babysitting. He showed an issue of the magazine to director and screenwriter [[Marc Allégret]] who offered Bardot the opportunity to audition for ''Les lauriers sont coupés''. Although Bardot got the role, the film was cancelled, but it made her consider becoming an actress. Moreover, her acquaintance with Vadim, who attended the audition, influenced her further life and career.<ref name="InitialsBB"/><ref name="twolives"/>

==Career==
Although the [[European cinema|European film industry]] was then in its ascendancy, Bardot was one of the few European actresses to have the mass media's attention in the United States, an interest which she did not reciprocate; rarely, if ever, going to Hollywood. She debuted in a 1952 [[comedy film]] ''Le Trou Normand'' (English title: ''Crazy for Love''). From 1952–56, she appeared in seventeen films; in 1953 she played a role in [[Jean Anouilh]]'s stageplay ''L'Invitation au château'' (''Invitation to the Castle''). She received media attention when she attended the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in April 1953.<ref name="twolives"/>

[[File:Brigitte Bardot - 1965.jpg|thumb|left|Bardot in ''[[Dear Brigitte]]'' (1965)]]
Her films of the early and mid-1950s were generally lightweight romantic dramas, some historical, in which she was cast as [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingénue]] or [[siren]], often appeared nearly nude or nude. She played bit parts in three English-language films, the British comedy ''[[Doctor at Sea (film)|Doctor at Sea]]'' (1955) with [[Dirk Bogarde]], ''[[Helen of Troy (film)|Helen of Troy]]'' (1954), in which she was understudy for the [[Helen of Troy|title role]] but appears only as Helen's handmaid, and ''Act of Love'' (1954) with [[Kirk Douglas]]. Her French-language films were dubbed for international release.

[[Roger Vadim]] (her husband at the time) was not content with this light fare. The [[French New Wave|New Wave]] of [[French cinema|French]] and [[Italian cinema|Italian]] art directors and their stars were riding high internationally, and he felt Bardot was being undersold. Looking for something more like an art film to push her as a serious actress, he showcased her in ''[[And God Created Woman (1956 film)|And God Created Woman]]'' (1956), opposite [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]]. The film, about an immoral teenager in a respectable small-town setting, was a huge success and turned Bardot into an international star.<ref name="twolives"/>

During her early career, professional photographer Sam Lévin's photos contributed to her image of Bardot's sensuality. One showed Bardot from behind, dressed in a white corset. British photographer [[Cornel Lucas]] made images of Bardot in the 1950s and 1960s that have become representative of her public persona. She divorced Vadim in 1957. In 1959 she married actor [[Jacques Charrier]], with whom she starred in ''Babette Goes to War''. The press took great interest in her marriage, while she and her husband clashed over the direction of her career. Bardot's only child, Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, was a product of her marriage to Jacques Charrier.

Bardot was awarded a [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Award]] for Best Foreign actress for her role in ''[[A Very Private Affair]]'' (''Vie privée'', 1962), directed by [[Louis Malle]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000003/awards Awards for Brigitte Bardot info], IMDb.com; retrieved 21 August 2010</ref>

In May 1958, Bardot withdrew to the seclusion of [[Southern France]] where she had bought the house ''La Madrague'' in [[Saint-Tropez]]. In 1963, she starred in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s film ''[[Contempt (film)|Le Mépris]]''. Bardot was featured in many other films along with notable actors such as [[Alain Delon]] (''Famous Love Affairs''; ''[[Spirits of the Dead]]''); [[Jean Gabin]] (''[[In Case of Adversity]]''); [[Sean Connery]] (''[[Shalako (film)|Shalako]]''); [[Jean Marais]] (''[[Royal Affairs in Versailles]]''; ''School for Love''); [[Lino Ventura]] (''Rum Runners''); [[Annie Girardot]] (''The Novices''); [[Claudia Cardinale]] (''[[The Legend of Frenchie King]]''); [[Jeanne Moreau]] (''[[Viva Maria!]]''); [[Jane Birkin]] (''[[Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman]]''). In 1973, Bardot announced that she was retiring from acting as "a way to get out elegantly".<ref name="The Modesto Bee-7 June 1973">{{cite news|title=Brigitte Bardot Gives Up Films at Age of 39|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d-EpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AYEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3388%2C1836097|agency=UPI|newspaper=The Modesto Bee|location=Modesto, California|date=7 June 1973|page=A-8|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref>

She participated in several musical shows and recorded many popular songs in the 1960s and 1970s, mostly in collaboration with [[Serge Gainsbourg]], Bob Zagury and [[Sacha Distel]], including "Harley Davidson"; "Je Me Donne A Qui Me Plaît"; "Bubble gum"; "Contact"; "Je Reviendrais Toujours Vers Toi"; "L'Appareil À Sous"; "La Madrague"; "On Déménage"; "Sidonie"; "Tu Veux, Ou Tu Veux Pas?"; "Le Soleil De Ma Vie" (the cover of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "[[You Are the Sunshine of My Life]]"); and the notorious "[[Je t'aime... moi non-plus]]". Bardot pleaded with Gainsbourg not to release this duet and he complied with her wishes; the following year, he re-recorded a version with British-born model and actress [[Jane Birkin]], which became a massive hit all over Europe. The version with Bardot was issued in 1986 and became a popular download hit in 2006 when [[Universal Records]] made its back catalogue available to purchase online, with this version of the song ranking as the third most popular download.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6058742.stm|title=Bardot revived as download star|date=17 October 2006|work=BBC News|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref>

==Personal life==
On 21 December 1952, aged 18, Bardot married director [[Roger Vadim]], seven years her senior. To receive permission from Bardot's parents to marry her, Vadim, originally a [[Russian Orthodox]] Christian, was urged to convert to Catholicism, although it is not clear if he ever did so. They divorced five years later, but remained friends and collaborated in later work. Bardot had an affair with her ''And God Created Woman'' co-star [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] (married at the time to actress [[Stéphane Audran]]) before her divorce from Vadim.<ref name="InitialsBB">{{cite book|first=Brigitte|last=Bardot|title=Initiales B.B.|publisher=Grasset & Fasquelle|year=1996|isbn=2-246-52601-9}}</ref><ref name="twolives">{{cite book|author=[[Jeffrey Robinson{{!}}Robinson, Jeffrey]]|title=Bardot&nbsp;— Two Lives|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] (London)|edition=First British |year=1994|id=ASIN: B000KK1LBM}}</ref> The two lived together for about two years. Their relationship was complicated by Trintignant's frequent absence due to [[military service]] and Bardot's affair with musician [[Gilbert Bécaud]], and they eventually separated.<ref name="InitialsBB"/>

[[File:BBardo St Trop 1963t.jpg|thumb|190px|Bardot and [[Sami Frey]] in St. Tropez, 1963]]In early 1958, Bardot recovered, in Italy, from a reported nervous breakdown, according to newspaper reports. A suicide attempt with sleeping pills two days earlier was also noted, but was denied by her public relations manager.<ref name="latimesblog">{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/files/1958_0209_cover.jpg|title=LA times 1958|date=|accessdate=21 August 2010|work=The Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

On 18 June 1959, she married actor Jacques Charrier, by whom she had her only child, a son, Nicolas-Jacques Charrier (born 11 January 1960). After she and Charrier divorced in 1962, Nicolas was raised in the Charrier family and did not maintain close contact with Bardot until his adulthood.<ref name="InitialsBB"/>

Bardot's third marriage was to German millionaire playboy [[Gunter Sachs]] from 14 July 1966 to 1 October 1969.<ref name="InitialsBB"/><ref name="twolives"/> In the 1970s, Bardot lived with sculptor Miroslav Brozek and posed for some of his sculptures. In 1974, Bardot appeared in a nude photo shoot in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, which celebrated her 40th birthday.

Bardot's fourth and current husband is Bernard d'Ormale, former adviser of Jean-Marie LePen, leader of the far right and fascistic party Front National; they have been married since 16 August 1992.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8503379/Gunter-Sachs.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Gunter Sachs|date=9 May 2011}}</ref>

===Animal welfare activism===
In 1973, before her 39th birthday, Bardot announced her retirement. After appearing in more than forty motion pictures and recording several music albums, most notably with [[Serge Gainsbourg]], she chose to use her fame to promote [[animal rights]].

In 1986, she established the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the Welfare and Protection of Animals.<ref name=foundationhistory>

In August 2010, Bardot addressed a letter to the Queen of Denmark, [[Margrethe II of Denmark]], appealing for the sovereign to halt the [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands|killing of dolphins]] in the [[Faroe Islands]]. In the letter, Bardot describes the activity as a "macabre spectacle" that "is a shame for Denmark and the Faroe Islands ...

[[File:BrigitteBardot.jpg|right|thumb|270px|Brigitte Bardot (2002)]]In her 1999 book ''Le Carré de Pluton'' ("''Pluto's Square''"), Bardot criticizes the procedure used in the [[ritual slaughter]] of sheep during the Muslim festival of [[Eid al-Adha]]. Additionally, in a section in the book entitled, "Open Letter to My Lost France", Bardot writes that "my country, France, my homeland, my land is again invaded by an overpopulation of foreigners, especially Muslims". For this comment, a French court fined her 30,000 [[franc]]s in June 2000.

In her 2003 book, ''Un cri dans le silence'' ("''A Scream in the Silence''"), she warned of an “[[Islamicization]] of France", and said of Muslim immigration:{{quote|Over the last twenty years, we have given in to a subterranean, dangerous, and uncontrolled infiltration, which not only resists adjusting to our laws and customs but which will, as the years pass, attempt to impose its own.<ref name="Orland">{{cite news|title=Brigitte Bardot's Cry in the Silence|date=2 September 2003|url=http://vdare.com/misc/orland_silence.htm|accessdate=14 January 2008|publisher=By David Orland}}</ref>}}

In the book, she also made comparisons of her close gay friends to today's homosexuals, who "jiggle their bottoms, put their little fingers in the air and with their little castrato voices moan about what those ghastly heteros put them through" and that some contemporary homosexuals behave like "fairground freaks".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/may/15/france.davidhearst|title= Anti-gay, anti-Islam Bardot to be sued|last=Webster|first=Paul|coauthors=David Hearst|date=5 May 2003|work=The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=3 October 2009}}</ref> In her own defence, Bardot wrote in a letter to a French gay magazine: "Apart from my husband—who maybe will cross over one day as well—I am entirely surrounded by homos.

In 2008, Bardot was convicted of inciting racial/religious hatred in relation to a letter she wrote, a copy of which she sent to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] when he was [[Interior Minister of France]]. The letter stated her objections to Muslims in France [[Dhabihah|ritually slaughtering sheep]] by slitting their throats without anesthetizing them first. She also said, in reference to Muslims, that she was "fed up with being under the thumb of this population which is destroying us, destroying our country and imposing its habits".

In fashion, the Bardot neckline (a wide open neck that exposes both shoulders) is named after her. Bardot popularized this style which is especially used for knitted sweaters or jumpers although it is also used for other tops and dresses.

Bardot popularized the [[bikini]] in her early films such as ''[[Manina, the Girl in the Bikini|Manina]]'' (1952) (released in France as ''Manina, la fille sans voiles''). The following year she was also photographed in a bikini on every beach in the south of France during the [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Bikinis: a brief history|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/picturegalleries/10160619/Bikinis-a-brief-history.html?frame=2609664|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref> She gained additional attention when she filmed ''[[And God Created Woman (1956 film)|...And God Created Woman]]'' (1956) with [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]].  (released in France as ''Et Dieu, Crea La Femme'').  Bardot portrayed an immoral teenager cavorting in a bikini who seduces men in a respectable small-town setting. The film was an international success.<ref name="twolives"/> The bikini was in the 1950s relatively well accepted in France but was still considered risquè in the United States. As late as 1959, Anne Cole, one of the United State's largest swimsuit designers, said, "It's nothing more than a G-string. It's at the razor's edge of decency."<ref name=WOJSI>{{cite web |first=William |last=Oscar |last=Johnson  |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068171/3/index.htm  |title=In The Swim |publisher=Sports Illustrated |date= 7 February 1989 |accessdate=18 August 2013}}</ref>

Bardot also brought into fashion the ''[[choucroute]]'' ("Sauerkraut") hairstyle (a sort of [[beehive (hairstyle)|beehive hair style]]) and [[gingham]] clothes after wearing a checkered pink dress, designed by Jacques Esterel, at her wedding to Charrier.<ref name=femstyle>{{cite web|url=http://www.femminastyle.com/index.php?main_page=page&id=9|title=Style Icon: Brigitte Bardot|publisher=Femminastyle.com|accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref> She was the subject for an [[Andy Warhol]] painting.

In addition to popularizing the bikini swimming suit, Bardot has also been credited with popularizing the city of [[St. Tropez]] and the town of [[Armação dos Búzios]] in Brazil, which she visited in 1964 with her boyfriend at the time, Brazilian musician [[Bob Zagury]]. The place where she stayed in Búzios is today a small hotel, Pousada do Sol, and also a French restaurant, Cigalon.<ref>{{cite web|title=TOemBUZIOS.com|url=http://www.toembuzios.com|publisher=TOemBUZIOS.com|accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref>

A statue by Christina Motta<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buziosonline.com.br/indexe.htm |title=BuziosOnline.com|publisher=BuziosOnline.com |accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref> honours Brigitte Bardot in Armação dos Búzios.

Bardot was idolized by the young [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]].<ref name="MilesPage69">{{cite book | author=[[Barry Miles{{!}}Miles, Barry]]|title=[[Many Years From Now]]|publisher=[[Vintage (publisher)|Vintage]]–[[Random House]]|year=1998|isbn=0-7493-8658-4}} pg. 69</ref><ref name="Spitzp171">{{cite book|author=[[Bob Spitz{{!}}Spitz, Bob]]|title=The Beatles: The Biography| publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] (New York)| year=2005|isbn=1-84513-160-6}} pg. 171</ref> They made plans to shoot a film featuring [[The Beatles]] and Bardot, similar to ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', but the plans were never fulfilled.<ref name="twolives"/> Lennon's first wife [[Cynthia Powell]] lightened her hair color to more closely resemble Bardot, while [[George Harrison]] made comparisons between Bardot and his first wife [[Pattie Boyd]], as Cynthia wrote later in ''A Twist of Lennon''. Lennon and Bardot met in person once, in 1968 at the Mayfair Hotel, introduced by Beatles press agent [[Derek Taylor]]; a nervous Lennon took [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] before arriving, and neither star impressed the other. (Lennon recalled in a memoir, "I was on acid, and she was on her way out.")<ref name="LennonPage24">{{cite book|author=[[John Lennon{{!}}Lennon, John]]|title=[[Skywriting by Word of Mouth]]|publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|year=1986|isbn=0-06-015656-2}} pg. 24</ref> According to the liner notes of his first (self-titled) album, musician [[Bob Dylan]] dedicated the first song he ever wrote to Bardot. He also mentioned her by name in "I Shall Be Free", which appeared on his second album, ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]''.

She dabbled in pop music and played the role of a [[glamour model]]. In 1965, she appeared as herself in the Hollywood production ''[[Dear Brigitte]]'' (1965) starring [[James Stewart]], one of the few American films in which she appeared. She refused to travel to Hollywood to film her scene, requiring the needed cast and crew members to travel to film in Paris. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1970, sculptor [[Aslan (pin up)|Alain Gourdon]] used Bardot as the model for a bust of [[Marianne]], the French national emblem. In 2007, she was named among ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's 100 Sexiest Film Stars.<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/100sexiest/default.asp?star=98 Empireonline.com]; Retrieved 19 December 2007</ref>

The first-ever official exhibition spotlighting Bardot's influence and legacy opened in Paris on 29 September 2009 – a day after her 75th birthday.<ref>[http://www.connexionfrance.com/expatriate-news-article.php?art=375 Brigitte Bardot at 75: the exhibition], ''The Connexion'' (September 2009)</ref>

[[File:Dieselová lokomotiva v Maloměřicích.jpg|thumbnail|right|A picture of the so-called "Bardotka" locomotive with the "breasts" visible on the front.]]

A type of [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] [[Diesel locomotive|diesel-electric locomotives]] [[:cs:Lokomotiva 751|(Classes 751 and 749)]] manufactured in the 1960s and 70's has a nickname "Bardotka" – this comes from the fact that the locomotive has a distinctively shaped front, which resembles female breasts.
