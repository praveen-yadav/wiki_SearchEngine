'''Dynamite''' is an [[explosive material]] based on [[nitroglycerin]], using [[diatomaceous earth]] ([[American English|AmE]]: kieselgur; [[British English|BrE]]: kieselguhr), or another absorbent substance such as powdered shells, clay, sawdust, or wood pulp. Dynamites using organic materials such as sawdust are less stable and such use has been generally discontinued. Dynamite was invented by the [[Swedish people|Swedish]] chemist and engineer [[Alfred Nobel]] in [[Geesthacht]], Germany, and [[patented]] in 1867. Its name was coined by Nobel from the [[Ancient Greek]] word δύναμις ''dýnamis'', meaning "power".<ref>"dynamite." The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. 2003.

Dynamite is a [[High explosives|high explosive]], which means its power comes from [[detonation]] rather than [[deflagration]]. Dynamite is mainly used in the [[mining]], [[quarrying]], [[construction]], and [[demolition]] industries, and it has had some historical usage in warfare. However the unstable nature of nitroglycerin, especially if subjected to freezing, has rendered it obsolete for military uses. Public familiarity with dynamite led to [[metaphor]]ic uses, such as saying that a particular issue is "political dynamite."

==Description==
Classic dynamite consists of three parts [[nitroglycerin]], one part diatomaceous earth and a small admixture of [[sodium carbonate]]. This mixture is formed into short sticks and wrapped in paper. Nitroglycerin by itself is a very strong explosive, and in its pure form it is extremely shock-sensitive (that is, physical shock can cause it to explode), and degrades over time to even more unstable forms. This makes it highly dangerous to transport or use in its pure form.

Absorbed into diatomaceous earth or sawdust, nitroglycerin is less shock-sensitive. Over time, the dynamite will "weep" or "sweat" its nitroglycerin, which can then pool in the bottom of the box or storage area. (For that reason, explosive manuals recommend the repeated turning over of boxes of dynamite in storage.) Crystals will form on the outside of the sticks causing them to be even more shock, friction or temperature sensitive. This creates a very dangerous situation. While the risk of an explosion without the use of a [[blasting cap]] is minimal for fresh dynamite, old dynamite is dangerous.

Dynamite is usually sold in the form of cylinders about {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on|0}} long and about {{convert|1.25|in|cm|abbr=on|1}} in diameter, with a weight of about 0.5&nbsp;lb troy (0.186&nbsp;kg).<ref name="Austin Blaster Guide">{{cite web|url=http://www.austinpowder.com/BlastersGuide/docs/pib/Dynamite%20Series.PDF |title=Austin Powder Guide, Dynamite series page 2 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> Other sizes also exist. The maximum [[shelf life]] of nitroglycerin-based dynamite is recommended as one year from the date of manufacture under good storage conditions.<ref name="Austin Blaster Guide" />

Another form of dynamite consists of nitroglycerin dissolved in [[nitrocellulose]] and a small amount of [[ketone]]. This form of dynamite is similar to [[cordite]], and is much safer than the simple mix of nitroglycerin and diatomaceous earth. '''Military dynamite''' achieves greater stability by avoiding the use of nitroglycerin and uses much more stable chemicals.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ledgard |first=Jared |title=A Soldiers Handbook, Volume 1: Explosives Operations |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=U6f-Qlmm6zIC&pg=PA498&lpg=PA498&dq=Military+dynamite+TNT|year=2007 |isbn=0-615-14794-1 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==History and manufacture==
[[File:Nobels Extradynamit label.jpg|thumb|"Nobel's Extra Dynamite" manufactured by Nobel's old company, Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget.]]

Dynamite was invented by [[Alfred Nobel]] and was the first safely manageable explosive stronger than [[black powder]]. Nobel obtained [[patent]]s for his invention: in England on 7 May 1867 and in Sweden on 19 October 1867.<ref name=s&s-101>Schück & Sohlman (1929), p. 101.</ref> He originally sold dynamite as ''"Nobel's Blasting Powder"''. After its introduction, dynamite rapidly gained wide-scale use as a safe alternative to [[gunpowder]] and [[nitroglycerin]]. Nobel tightly controlled the patents, and unlicensed duplicating companies were quickly shut down. However, a few American businessmen got around the patent by using a slightly different formula.<ref name="USPat 234489">US Patent 234489 issued to Morse 16 November 1880</ref>

===South Africa===
For several decades beginning in the 1940s, the largest producer of dynamite in the world was the [[Union of South Africa]]. There the [[De Beers]] company established a factory in 1902 at [[Somerset West]]. The explosives factory was later operated by [[AECI]] (African Explosives and Chemical Industries). The demand for the product came mainly from the country's vast gold mines, centered on the [[Witwatersrand]]. The factory at Somerset West was in operation in 1903 and by 1907 it was already producing 340,000 cases [22 kilograms (50 pounds) each] annually. A rival factory at Modderfontein was producing another 200,000 cases per year.<ref>[http://www.caia.co.za/chsahs02.htm An MBendi Profile: South Africa - History of the Chemical Industry]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>

Dynamite was dangerous to manufacture. There were two large explosions at the Somerset West plant during the 1960s. Some workers died, but the loss of life was limited by the modular design of the factory and its earth works, and the planting of trees that directed the blasts upward. There were several other explosions at the Modderfontein factory. After 1985, pressure from trade unions forced AECI to phase out the production of dynamite. The factory then went on to produce ammonium nitrate emulsion-based explosives that are safer to manufacture and to handle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060630050905/http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm |archivedate=30 June 2006 |title=Historical Highlights 1980's |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=30 June 2006 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>

===United States===
[[Image:Aetna dynamite.jpg|thumb|upright|Advertisement for the Aetna Explosives Company of New York.]]
Dynamite was manufactured by the [[E. I du Pont de Nemours Company]] until the mid-1970s. Other American dynamite makers of that time period included the [[Hercules, California|Hercules Corporation]], Atlas, Trojan-US Powder, Austin, and several other smaller firms. Dynamite has been mostly phased out in favor of [[water gel explosive]]s, which are cheaper to manufacture, and in many ways safer to handle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Heritage/en_US/related_topics/explosives.html |title=DuPont Heritage: Explosives |publisher=.dupont.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>

In the United States, in 1885, the chemist Russell S. Penniman invented "ammonium dynamite", a form of explosive that used [[ammonium nitrate]] as a substitute for the more costly nitroglycerin. These dynamites were marketed with the trade name "Extra". Ammonium nitrate contains 85% of the [[chemical energy]] of nitroglycerin.

==Difference from TNT==
Though both [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT) and dynamite are high explosives, there is little similarity between them. Dynamite is an absorbent mixture soaked in nitroglycerin then compacted into a cylindrical shape and wrapped in paper. TNT is a chemical compound called 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene. ('''Military dynamite''' is a dynamite substitute, also formulated without nitroglycerin, containing 75% [[RDX]], 15% TNT, 5% SAE 10 motor oil, and 5% cornstarch, but much safer to store and handle for long time than Nobel's dynamite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uxoinfo.com/uxoinfo/ordfillers.cfm |title=Unexploded Ordnance Information: Ordnance Fillers |publisher=Uxoinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>)

A stick of dynamite (0.19&nbsp;kg, 75% nitroglycerin, no other explosives in the mixture of dynamite) contains roughly 1 M[[joule|J]] of energy. The energy density ([[joule]]s/[[kilogram]] or J/kg) of dynamite is approximately 5 MJ/kg, compared to 4.0 MJ/kg of TNT (for TNT r.e.factor=1.00; for Nobel dynamite r.e. factor=1.25;).
