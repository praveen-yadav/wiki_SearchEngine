[[File:Beverly Hillbillies Episode 18 Jed Saves The Drysdales Marriage.ogg|thumb|Beverly Hillbillies Episode 18: Jed Saves The Drysdales Marriage]]
'''''The Beverly Hillbillies''''' is an American situation comedy originally broadcast for nine seasons on [[CBS]] from 1962 to 1971, starring [[Buddy Ebsen]], [[Irene Ryan]], [[Donna Douglas]], and [[Max Baer, Jr.]]

The series is about a poor backwoods family transplanted to [[Beverly Hills, California]], after striking oil on their land. A [[Filmways]] production created by writer [[Paul Henning]], it is the first in a genre of "[[wiktionary:fish out of water|fish out of water]]" themed television shows, and was followed by other Henning-inspired country-cousin series on CBS. In 1963, Henning introduced ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', and in 1965 he reversed the rags to riches model for ''[[Green Acres]]''. The show paved the way for later culture-conflict programs such as ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'', ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', and ''[[Doc (TV series)|Doc]]''. Panned by many entertainment critics of its time, it quickly became a huge ratings success for most of its nine-year run on CBS.

''The Beverly Hillbillies'' ranked among the top twenty most watched programs on television for eight of its nine seasons, twice ranking as the number one series of the year, with a number of episodes that remain among the most watched television episodes of all time.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=chart_pass&charttype=chart_topshowsalltime| title = Top 100 TV Shows of All Time| accessdate = April 9, 2009| author = Nielsen Media Research| date = August 6, 2000| publisher = Variety}}</ref>

The ongoing popularity of the series spawned a [[The Beverly Hillbillies (film)|1993 film remake]] by [[20th Century Fox]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Hollywood To Make Movie Of Old 'Beverly Hillbillies'|work= Orlando Sentinel|date=|url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-01-24/news/9301240378_1_beverly-hillbillies-dabney-coleman-series-the-beverly|accessdate=2010-10-06}}</ref>

In 1997, the episode "Hedda Hopper's Hollywood" was ranked #62 on [[TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071028140448/http://members.aol.com/speaker606/jim/tv.html The 100 Greatest TV Episodes of All Time]</ref>

Reruns are still being broadcast on television. On [[TV Land]], the show is broadcast, but has been converted to color film. The show in its original form (Black & White) is broadcast on local Christian television channel in Florida, "Good Life 45".

==Overview==
''The Beverly Hillbillies'' series starts with the [[petroleum company|OK Oil Company]] learning of oil in Jed Clampett's swamp land and paying him a fortune to acquire the rights to drill on his land. Patriarch Jed moves with his family into a mansion next door to his banker (Milburn Drysdale, of the Commerce Bank of Beverly Hills), in the wealthy [[Los Angeles County]] city of [[Beverly Hills, California]], where he brings a moral, unsophisticated, and minimalistic lifestyle to the swanky, sometimes self-obsessed and superficial community. The theme song introduces the viewer to the world's most fortunate hunting accident, whereby Jed shoots at game but instead hits "[[Petroleum|black gold, Texas tea]]": [[Hydrocarbon exploration|he had discovered oil]]. [[Double entendre]]s and cultural misconceptions were the core of the sitcom's humor. Frequently, plots involved the outlandish efforts taken by Drysdale to keep the Clampetts in Beverly Hills and their money in his bank. The family's periodic attempts to return to the mountains were often prompted by Granny due to a perceived [[insult|slight]] she received from one of the "city-folk." ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' accumulated seven Emmy nominations during its run. Over a half century since its premiere, the series remains in syndication on [[MeTV]].

The Hillbillies themselves were [[Buddy Ebsen]] as the widowed patriarch Jed "J.D." Clampett; [[Irene Ryan]] as his [[ornery]] mother-in-law, Daisy May "Granny" Moses; [[Donna Douglas]] as his curvaceous and beautiful, yet tomboyish daughter Elly May Clampett; and [[Max Baer, Jr.]] as Jethro, the brawny, half-witted son of his cousin Pearl Bodine. Pearl (played by [[Bea Benaderet]]) appeared in most of the first season episodes, as did Jethro's twin sister Jethrine, played by Baer in [[drag (clothing)|drag]], using [[Linda Kaye Henning]]'s voiceover. Pearl was the relative who prodded Jed to move to California, after being told his modest property could yield $25 million.

The supporting cast featured [[Raymond Bailey]] as Jed's greedy, unscrupulous banker Milburn Drysdale; [[Harriet E. MacGibbon]] as Drysdale's ostentatious wife Margaret Drysdale; and [[Nancy Kulp]] as "Miss" Jane Hathaway, Drysdale's scholarly, "plain Jane" secretary, who occasionally pined for the clueless Jethro.

The creators of the series seemed to place the Beverly Hillbillies as having previously lived somewhere in a mountainous area of the Southern US, yet beyond this, consistent information about specifically which part of the South they were from is not available.  While Granny frequently mentioned that she was from [[Tennessee]], the series never specified the state from which the Clampetts moved to California. Various, sometimes conflicting clues can be found in certain episodes as to where the Beverly Hillbillies might have come from.  In season 5 episode 17 it is claimed that they came from the town of "Bug Tussle" in an unspecified state.

While there is indeed a town of [[Bugtussle, Oklahoma|Bugtussle]] in Oklahoma, this does not appear to be consistent with other geographical clues from other episodes (for one, Oklahoma is mostly plains and the series explicitly states Jed is a mountaineer).  In other episodes they often referred to nearby towns such as [[Joplin, Missouri|Joplin]], [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]], [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]], [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Silver Dollar City]], all of which are in or near southwest [[Missouri]]. In the eighth episode of season 8, named "Manhattan Hillbillies," Granny tells the police officer in Central Park that her family comes from Taney County (there is a [[Taney County, Missouri|Taney County]] in southwest Missouri). Early episodes also contained several references to [[Eureka Springs, Arkansas|Eureka Springs]], which is in northwest [[Arkansas]]. All of these communities are in mountainous portions (the [[Ozark Mountains|Ozarks]]) of the Southern United States. The [[Appalachian English|character accents]], initial poverty, and existence of oil, however, are all more consistent with an [[Appalachia]]n origin, much farther east. The show's creator and producer, [[Paul Henning]] is from [[Independence, Missouri]], and donated {{convert|1534|acres|0|abbr=on}} for the Ruth and Paul Henning Conservation Area near Branson.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dale Cox |url=http://www.exploresouthernhistory.com/henning1.html |title=Ruth and Paul Henning Conservation Area&nbsp;– Branson, Missouri |publisher=Exploresouthernhistory.com |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref>

A three-act stage play based on the pilot was written by David Rogers in 1968.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=XqzpiBNwn_EC&dq=beverly+hillbillies&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0 ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' stage play, adapted by David Rogers]</ref>

===Crossovers with related shows===
Two episodes of ''Petticoat Junction'' feature characters from ''The Beverly Hillbillies'': "Granny, the Baby Expert" featuring Granny, and "A Cake from Granny" featuring Granny and Miss Jane. Although none of the characters from ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' ever appeared on ''Green Acres'', an episode of ''Green Acres'' was named after ''The Beverly Hillbillies''. However, the Douglasses and Eb make cameo appearances in Season 7, Episode 10 of ''The Beverly Hillbillies''.   Irene Ryan, as Granny, appears in the "Love and the Single Horse" episode of Mr Ed.  Granny also makes a cameo appearance in the 1966 movie "Don’t Worry, We’ll Think of a Title" starring Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie.

The character of Sam Drucker as played by Frank Cady has appeared in 10 episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies, 165 episodes of Petticoat Junction and 142 episodes of Green Acres.

==Theme music==
The show's [[theme music|theme song]], "[[The Ballad of Jed Clampett]]", was written by producer and writer [[Paul Henning]] and originally performed by [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] artists [[Foggy Mountain Boys|Flatt and Scruggs]]. The song was sung by [[Jerry Scoggins]] (backed by Flatt and Scruggs) over the opening and end credits of each episode. Flatt and Scruggs subsequently cut their own version of the theme (with Flatt singing) for [[Columbia Records]]; released as a single, it reached #44 on [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] pop music chart and #1 on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Country]] chart (the lone country chart-topper for the duo).

The six main cast members participated on a 1963 Columbia soundtrack album which featured original song numbers in character. Additionally, Ebsen, Ryan, and Douglas each made a few solo recordings following the show's success, including Ryan's 1966 novelty single, "Granny's Miniskirt."

The series generally featured no [[country music]] beyond the bluegrass banjo theme song, although country star [[Roy Clark]] and the team of Flatt and Scruggs occasionally played on the program. Pop singer [[Pat Boone]] appeared on one episode as himself, with the premise that he hailed from the same area of the country as the Clampetts, though Boone is a native of [[Jacksonville, Florida]].

The 1989 film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' featured a [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] parody music video, "[[Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*]]," combining "[[The Ballad of Jed Clampett]]" and English rock band [[Dire Straits]]' 1985 hit song "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]".

==Reception==
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2013}}
Written off as lowbrow by some critics, the show shot to the top of the [[Nielsen ratings]] shortly after its premiere and stayed there for several seasons. During its first two seasons, it was the number one program in the U.S. During its second season, it earned some of the highest ratings ever recorded for a half-hour sitcom. The season two episode "The Giant Jackrabbit" also became the most watched telecast up to the time of its airing, and remains the [[List of most watched television broadcasts#Top 45 network primetime telecasts of all time (1964-Present)|most watched half-hour episode of a sitcom]] as well. The series enjoyed excellent ratings throughout its run, although it had fallen out of the top 20 most watched shows during its final season.

===Influence on other television shows===
Because of the show's high ratings, CBS asked creator Paul Henning to pen two more folksy comedies, spawning a mini-genre of rural sitcoms during the 1960s. ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'' featured an extended family, including three pretty young women of marrying age, running a small hotel in the isolated rural town of Hooterville. ''[[Green Acres]]'' flipped the Clampetts' fish-out-of-water concept by depicting two city sophisticates moving to [[Hooterville]], which was populated by oddball country bumpkins.

Certain actors appeared on more than one of these series:

* Bea Benaderet, who had played Jethro's mother during the first season of ''The Beverly Hillbillies,'' was the mother of the family on ''Petticoat Junction''.
* Linda Kaye Henning, who provided the voiceover for the ''Beverly Hillbillies'' character Jethrine, portrayed Benaderet's daughter Betty Jo Bradley on ''Petticoat Junction'' (the only female who remained all seven seasons).
* [[Edgar Buchanan]], who starred in all 222 episodes of ''Petticoat Junction'' and guest-starred in 17 episodes of ''Green Acres,'' also guested in three episodes of ''The Beverly Hillbillies,'' always as the character Uncle Joe Carson.
* [[Charles Lane (actor)|Charles Lane]] played Homer Bedloe, vice president of the C. & F. W. Railroad, on both shows.  He also played an apartment landlord to Jane Hathaway ("Foster Phinney") during the 1970–71 season.
* Sam Drucker, played by [[Frank Cady]], of both ''Petticoat Junction'' and ''Green Acres,'' also appeared in several episodes of the ''Beverly Hillbillies''.
* Several animal actors trained by [[Frank Inn]], including [[Higgins (dog)|Higgins the dog]], also moved between series as needed.

==Cast==

===J.D. "Jed" Clampett===
Although he had received little formal education, Jed Clampett ([[Buddy Ebsen]]) has a good deal of common sense. A good-natured man, he is the apparent head of the family. Jed's wife (Elly May's mother) died but is referred to in the episode "Duke Steals A Wife" as Rose Ellen. Jed is shown to be an expert marksman and is extremely loyal to his family and kinfolk. The huge oil pool in the swamp he owned was the beginning of his rags-to-riches journey to Beverly Hills. Although he longs for the old ways back in the hills, he makes the best of being in Beverly Hills. Whenever he has anything on his mind, he sits on the curbstone of his mansion and whittles until he comes up with the answer. His catchphrase is, "We-e-e-ell, doggies!" Jed's full first name is never given in the television series, though 'Jedediah' was used in the 1993 ''Beverly Hillbillies'' theatrical movie (coincidentally, on Ebsen's subsequent series, ''[[Barnaby Jones]]'', Barnaby's nephew J.R. was also named Jedediah). In one episode Jed and Granny reminisce about seeing [[Buddy Ebsen]] and [[Vilma Ebsen]]—a joking reference to the Ebsens' song and dance act. Jed appears in all 274 episodes.

===Granny===
Daisy May Moses ([[Irene Ryan]]), called "Granny" by all (relatives or not) is Jed's shotgun-toting mother-in-law and a true daughter of [[Dixie]]. Paul Henning, the show's creator/producer quickly disposed of the idea of Granny being Jed's mother, which would have changed the show's dynamics, making Granny the matriarch and Jed subordinate to her. Granny can be aggressive but is often overruled by Jed. She is a confederate to the core, defending President Jefferson Davis, the Stars and Bars, and the simple life.  Short-fused and easily angered, Granny fancies herself a "dunked" (not "sprinkled") Christian with forgiveness in her heart. She abhors "revenuers" and blue-coat Yankees. A self-styled "M.D."&nbsp;— "mountain doctor"&nbsp;— she claims to have an edge over expensive know-nothing city physicians. In lieu of anesthesia, Granny uses her "white lightning" brew before commencing on painful treatments such as leech bleeding and yanking teeth with pliers.

Short and scrappy, Granny often wields a double-barreled, 12-gauge shotgun and fires it numerous times during the run of the show (in a first-season episode she chases Milburn Drysdale with it when she found out his mother's family had a feud with her family back in the hills). She fires it once at the front lawn when Jed is witching for water and several times on the skeet shooting range. During the mock Indian invasion she believed she was shooting live shells, though Milburn Drysdale had removed the buckshot to protect the actors portraying the Indians. She fires rock salt and bacon rind at a crow during the "Happy Valley" episode, and again at the back of an armored truck in which Milburn Drysdale was taking refuge in.  She fires at (and hits in the posterior) Milburn Drysdale with rocksalt believing he is the ghost of "Lady Clemintine" ending their second visit to "Clampett Castle" in Kent, England.

Granny also fires "Lady Fingers" (which Elly had baked for Jethro to take to the Army Reserve) into the posterior of an actor portraying Gen. Ulysses S. Grant during "The Battle of Culpepper Plantation"

She is also able to tell the precise time via a sun dial and the weather via a beetle (Granny Versus the Weather Bureau). Without her glasses, Granny is extremely nearsighted&nbsp;— once in a crossover with the [[Petticoat Junction]] show, Granny mistakes a dog for a baby child and a coffee pot for a telephone. Two of Granny's phobias are "Injuns" (she actually buys wigs so the Clampetts won't be "scalped") and the "cement pond" (swimming pool–she has a fear of water). In a long [[story arc]] in the show's ninth season, Elly May dates a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] frogman, which confuses Granny: After seeing the frogman climb out of the pool in his skin-diving wear, she thinks that anyone who swims in the pool will be turned into a frog. She also has a peculiar way of retelling the [[War Between The States]], in which she thinks the South has won and [[Jefferson Davis]] is the president, while calling [[Sherman's March to the Sea|Sherman's March]] "Sherman's Retreat to the Sea". Any attempts to correct her meet with failure. She is also known for slicing off switches to use on Jethro, mainly whenever he goes too far with his dumb and idiotic schemes.

There are references to Granny growing up in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. From episode 9: "When I was a girl back in Tennessee, I set so many boys' hearts on fire that they took to calling that neck of the woods ''The Smoky Mountains''."

Granny's full name, Daisy Moses, allegedly an homage to the popular and dearly loved folk artist [[Anna Mary Robertson]], known to the world as [[Grandma Moses]]. (Grandma Moses died in 1961, a year before ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' made its television debut.) Granny is frequently referred to as "Granny Clampett" in a number of episodes but technically she is a Moses. Granny appears in all 274 episodes.

===Elly May Clampett===
Elly May ([[Donna Douglas]]), Jed's only child, is a mountain beauty with the body of a [[Pin-up girl|pinup girl]] and the soul of a [[tomboy]]. She can throw a [[fastball]] as well as "[[wrestling|rassle]]" most men to a fall, and she can be as tender with her friends, animals, and family as she is tough with anyone she rassles. She said once that animals could be better companions than people, but as she grew older she saw that, "fellas kin be more fun than critters." Elly is squired about by eager young [[Hollywood]] actors with stage names like "Dash Riprock" and "Bolt Upright." Other boyfriends for Elly include Sonny Drysdale, Beau Short, accountant Fred Penrod, beatnik Sheldon Epps, and Mark Templeton, a frogman.

Elly's most notable weakness, oft mentioned when she is being "courted," is her lack of kitchen skills. Family members cringe when, for plot reasons, Elly takes over the kitchen. Rock-like donuts and cookies, for example, are a plot function in an episode featuring [[Wally Cox]] as bird watching Professor Biddle.

Elly is briefly considered for film stardom at the movie studio owned by Jed. In one episode, hearing [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Cary Grant]] are both single, Granny asks that Elly be introduced to them.

During the final season Elly May takes a job as a secretary at the Commerce Bank after Jed and Granny persuade her that it would be a good way to "meet a husband."

In the 1981 TV movie of ''The Beverly Hillbillies'', Elly May is head of a zoo. Elly May appears in all 274 episodes.

In addition to the family dog, Duke (an old bloodhound), a number of animals lived on the Clampett estate thanks to animal-lover Elly. These animals were collectively known as her "critters". The most prominent pets were [[chimpanzee]]s, but other animals (from the typical dogs, cats to less-traditional house pets, such as deer, opossums, bears, goats, raccoons, kangaroos, etc.) were also occasionally featured.

===Jethro Bodine===
Jethro ([[Max Baer, Jr.]]) is the son of Jed's cousin, Pearl Bodine (though he addresses Jed as his uncle). He drove the Clampett family to their new home in California and stayed on with them to further his education. The whole family boasts of Jethro's "sixth-grade education" but nevertheless feels he is a bit of an idiot. Jethro is simply naive in the first season of the show but becomes incredibly ignorant and pompous as the series progresses. He often shows off his cyphering abilities with multiplication and "go-zin-ta's," as in "five gozinta five one times, five gozinta ten two times," etc.  The tallest student in his class in the town of Oxford (so named because "that's where the oxen used to ford the creek") because of his age, he is often impressing others that he graduated "top of his class at Oxford."  In Beverly Hills, he decides to go to college. He manages to enroll late in the semester at a local secretarial school due to his financial backing and earns his diploma by the end of the day because he did not understand what was going on in class and was too disruptive. This was an ironic [[in-joke]] – in real life, Max Baer, Jr., has a bachelor's degree in business administration from [[Santa Clara University]] (he also minored in philosophy).

Many stories in the series involve Jethro's endless career search, which include such diverse vocations as a millwright, a [[neurosurgeon|brain surgeon]], street car conductor, [[James Bond|double-naught spy]], Hollywood producer (a studio flunky remarks Jethro has the ''right qualifications'' for being a producer—a sixth-grade education and his uncle owns the studio. The in-joke gag of Jethro as a movie producer was replayed in the 1981 movie), [[soda jerk]], short order cook, and once as a [[bookkeeper]] for Milburn Drysdale's bank. More often than not, his overall goal in these endeavors is to obtain as many pretty girls as humanly possible. Of all the Clampett clan, he is the one who makes the most change from 'country bumpkin' to 'city boy.' Another [[running gag]] is that Jethro is known as the "six-foot stomach" for his ability to eat: in one episode, he eats a jetliner's entire supply of steaks; in another, Jethro tries to set himself up as a Hollywood agent for cousin "Bessie" – with a fee of 10,000 bananas for Bessie and 1,000 bananas for Jethro. At one time Jed mentions Jethro was the only baby he knew born with a full set of teeth "just like a beaver". Jethro appears in 272 episodes; he is not in the third- or second-to-last episodes, but Baer of course remains billed in the title credits. Baer claimed he only auditioned for the role of Jethro for fun and never expected to get the part. Supposedly, he clinched the part largely because of his grin.

===The Drysdales===
Milburn ([[Raymond Bailey]]), Margaret ([[Harriet E. MacGibbon]]), and Sonny ([[Louis Nye]]): The Drysdales are the Clampetts' next-door neighbors. Milburn is the Commerce Bank's tightwad president and the friendly bumpkins' confidant. The haughty Mrs. Drysdale touts a heritage that traces back to the Mayflower, but money-hungry Milburn's concerns are strictly monetary. When suffering an anxiety attack, Milburn sniffs a stack of money and is quickly revived. In the interest of keeping the Clampetts' account at all costs, Mr. Drysdale is prone to appease them and says that anything they do is unquestionably right. He often forces others, especially his secretary, to placate the Clampetts by granting their unorthodox requests. Although wife Margaret, a blue-blooded Bostonian, has obvious disdain for the "peasant" and "dreadful" hillbillies, she tacitly agrees to tolerate them (rather than Milburn lose their ever growing account—which is $96,000,000 in 1969, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|96000000|1969}}}} today). Margaret loathes all four "vagabonds," but her most heated rivalry is with Granny, with whom she occasionally has some "scraps." [[Raymond Bailey]] appears in 247 episodes. [[Harriet E. MacGibbon]] appears in 55 episodes between 1962 and 1969, she is not seen in the last two seasons of the show although is occasionally mentioned. Margaret's aged father has gambled away most of their money. Mrs. Drysdale's son—and Milburn's stepson—is Sonny (played by [[Louis Nye]]), who is introduced as a thirty-five year-old collegian who doesn't believe in working up a sweat and is an insufferable [[mama's boy]]. Finding Elly May a lovely, naive Pollyanna, he courts her until she literally tosses him. Although the character is fondly remembered by fans, Sonny only appears in four episodes, three in 1962 and a final appearance in 1966.

Jane Hathaway ([[Nancy Kulp]]), whom the Clampetts addressed as "Miss Jane", is Drysdale's loyal and efficient secretarial assistant. Though she always carried out his wishes, she was inherently decent and was frequently put off by her boss's greed. When she was annoyed with him, as was often the case, especially when one of Drysdale's schemes went too far, she would usually and forcefully say "Chief!". Jane was genuinely fond of the family (to the Clampetts, she was considered family; even Granny, the one most dead-set against living in California, liked her very much); in fact, she actually harbored something of a crush on Jethro for most of the series' run. At first, she mistook the Clampetts as the servants, until she realized who they really were (which almost cost her her job). Miss Hathaway frequently has to "rescue" Drysdale from his idiotic schemes, receiving little or no thanks for her efforts. In one episode, she and Granny, disguised as "[[Geisha#"Geisha girls"|geisha girl]]s", finally have enough and "crown" Drysdale and Jethro, who have made one too many comments about women serving men. Jane is loyal to Drysdale, as well, despite her misgivings toward his avarice and greed. In one episode, the Clampetts, feeling money has corrupted them, give all of their money to Virginia "Ginny" Jennings ([[Sheila Kuehl]]), a college student. While Drysdale moans the loss of the money, Jane immediately tells him to stop thinking about the Clampetts and start trying to get the Jennings account. Eventually, everyone discovered Jennings' real motives, and she was gone, with the Clampetts getting their money back, and things were as they were before. In one episode, it is established that Miss Jane sacrificed her job as the top secretary of the top executive of the top insurance company to join Mr. Drysdale at the Commerce Bank. Miss Jane was a [[Vassar College|Vassar]] graduate. [[Nancy Kulp]] appears in 246 episodes. In 1999, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked Jane Hathaway #38 on its "50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time" list.<ref>{{cite book|title=TV Guide Book of Lists|year=2007|publisher=Running Press|isbn=0-7624-3007-9|page=191}}</ref>

===Semiregulars===
; Pearl Bodine: Jed's cousin Pearl Bodine, portrayed by [[Bea Benaderet]], was Jethro's widowed mother. In the last season, Granny mentioned that her husband, Fred Bodine, had drowned in a fishing accident when Jethro was just a baby (although, in an earlier episode, Jethro shared some memories of his father with a psychiatrist).  Pearl was a generally well-meaning mother to Jethro. She also was a popular character, often used as a foil for Granny, and became a regular part-way through the first season (the end credits were even refilmed to include Pearl with the other family members). She disappeared after the first year because Benaderet had become the star of another [[Paul Henning]] series, ''Petticoat Junction''. Like Elly May, Pearl's name came from that of a character (Pearl Lester) in the popular rural-life novel, play, and film ''Tobacco Road''. Pearl Bodine appears in 22 of the first season's episodes, 1962–63, and later makes a cameo in the 1967 episode "Greetings From The President". In the episodes "The Clampetts Get Psychoanalyzed" and "The Psychiatrist Gets Clampetted" [[Herbert Rudley]] plays the psychiatrist Dr. Eugene Twombley. In the episodes Pearl is enamored with Dr. Twombley; Benaderet's real life husband was named [[Eugene Twombley]]. The role of Pearl was first offered to [[Shirley Collie Nelson|Shirley Collie]].

; Jethrine Bodine: Jethrine is Pearl's king-sized daughter, Jethro's twin (and is also played by Baer, though voiced by [[Linda Kaye Henning]]). Jethrine appears in 11 episodes in 1962–63; she moves with her mother to the Clampett mansion later that season but occasionally is not seen in episodes during her stay in California. Jethrine was upset in leaving the hills as it meant separation from her "sweetie", traveling salesman Jazzbo Depew. Late in the season it was explained in an episode that Jethrine had returned home to marry Depew, although the wedding was never seen in the series (nor was Jethrine ever seen again, although she was occasionally referenced). Jethro and Jethrine rarely appeared in the same scene in any of the programs, and then they were never on-camera at the same time except for the rare back-of-the-head shot of one done by a double. Jethrine appears in the 1993 movie version.

; Dash Riprock: Dash, played by [[Larry Pennell]], was the handsome Hollywood actor employed by Jed's movie studio. Elly May and he met while she was working as an extra at the studio. Once Dash saw the beautiful Elly in her bathing suit, he was smitten with her. The two had an on-and-off relationship. In one episode, Mr. Drysdale forced Dash into courting Elly May by threatening to put him in a television show called ''Crabman''. Elly initially liked Dash and enjoyed being with him on dates. Jethro, however, was more enamored with Dash and his playboy persona than was his comely cousin. Riprock was a send-up of the blatantly fake screen names employed by a number of movie actors of the period. Riprock's real name (before being changed by Hollywood moguls) was "Homer Noodleman," and he was from [[Peoria, Illinois]]. Dash Riprock was in 10 episodes, mainly between 1965–69.

; Lowell Redlings Farquhar: Lowell is the elderly father of Mrs. Drysdale; Granny considers him a potential beau. Lowell (played by [[Charles Ruggles]]) is in three episodes, 1965–66.

; [[Lester Flatt]] and [[Earl Scruggs]]: Country music stars Flatt and Scruggs (who play themselves in seven episodes, 1963–68) are longtime friends of the Clampetts "back home" ([[Kimberling City, Missouri]]) who visit with the Clampetts when they are on tour in California. The duo had a number-one [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] country single with the show's "The Ballad of Jed Clampett" (although the song is actually performed in the credits by [[Jerry Scoggins]] to Flatt and Scruggs' instrumental). Actress [[Joi Lansing]] played Flatt's wife, Gladys, in five episodes, 1963–68.

; John Brewster: Brewster (played by [[Frank Wilcox]]), is the President and CEO of the OK Oil Company, headquartered in Tulsa, who purchases the oil rights to the gusher on the Clampett home back in the hills. The Clampetts are quite fond of him, and his wife occasionally visits them in California. John Brewster appears in 14 episodes, 1962–1966.

; Janet Trego: Janet (played by [[Sharon Tate]]) is a beautiful secretary at the Commerce Bank. Although Janet appears in 15 episodes, 1963–65, her role is generally quite minor. Tate was later murdered by [[Charles Manson|Charles Manson's]] "family" just before the start of the eighth season.

; '''Sam Drucker''': Sam (played by [[Frank Cady]]) owns the general store in Hooterville. Granny is constantly under the impression Sam wants to marry her, but Sam has no intentions of doing so. He appears in 10 episodes between 1968 and 1970. Cady also starred as Sam Drucker in ''Petticoat Junction'' and ''Green Acres''. Cady reprised the role of Sam Drucker for the 1990 ''Green Acres'' reunion movie ''Return to Green Acres''.

; '''Helen Thompson''': Helen (played by Danielle Mardi) is a beautiful British secretary at the Commerce Bank. Helen takes over Jane Hathaway's job as Mr. Drysdale's secretary after Ms. Hathaway resigned. Helen appears in 17 episodes between 1969 and 1971. She was one of the ringleaders of the protest group the secretaries of the Commerce Bank created, GRUN (Girls Resist Unfair Neglect). She, along with many other secretaries, as well as Elly and Granny, lived with Ms. Hathaway for a short time in her apartment.

; Shorty Kellums: Shorty (played by [[Shug Fisher]]) is Jed's longtime buddy from back home, with whom Jed reunites in 1969 when the Clampetts go back for an extended period to the Hills. Shorty is a wiry little man who is crazy about voluptuous girls half his age. Shorty later moves into the Clampett mansion in Beverly Hills for a period. Shorty Kellums appears in 17 episodes in the 1969–70 season, and returned again briefly during 1970–71.

; Elverna Bradshaw: Elverna is Granny's longtime rival back in the Hills, a gossip second to none. She makes a brief appearance in a 1963 episode when the Clampetts go back to the Hills to fetch Pearl to California, but is not seen again until 1969, when the Clampetts return to their native land for an extended visit. However, both Granny and Jed referred to the character in several episodes throughout the series' run. Elverna (played by [[Elvia Allman]]) and Granny rekindle their feud in a match to see who will be first wed, Elverna's daughter or Elly May. For reasons not really explained, Elverna also moves into the Clampett Beverly Hills mansion during the same period Shorty does; both of them, however, are gone from the estate for the final 1970–71 season, presumably having returned home. Elverna Bradshaw appears in 13 episodes, 1963–1970.

; Matthew and Mark Templeton: The Templetons are two brothers, both played by actor [[Roger Torrey]], who originally auditioned (unsuccessfully) for the part of Jethro. Matthew is seen in three episodes in October 1969 during the Clampetts' stay in the Hills, where Granny tags the preacherman as a prospective husband for Elly. Unfortunately, Granny learns Matthew is married. Just a year later back in California, Elly meets Matthew's brother, Mark Templeton, who is a [[marine biologist]], a [[frogman]], whom Granny believes is actually part frog. The Mark Templeton storyline played out for nine episodes and was abruptly dropped, although advance publicity for the show indicated Elly May and Mark would be marrying during the season; however, the show was cancelled at the end of that season as part of the CBS [[Rural Purge]].

==Storylines==
Most episodes revolved around the clash between the "uncivilized" hillbilly culture represented by the Clampetts and the high society American culture of the Drysdales. The Clampetts lived as they always had, even in their large, elegant mansion, never abandoning their mountain attire or replacing the old rattletrap truck in which they had moved to California. Although when asked what kind of truck it is, Jethro said 'I think it's a Stutz', it is actually based on a 1921 Oldsmobile. All the Hillbillies were handy with firearms and always seemed to have their weapons close at hand and ready to draw. They continued to grow their own food, and Granny made [[soap|lye soap]] and [[moonshine]]. The extreme potency of the moonshine liquor and the harshness of the lye soap were running gags throughout the run of the series.

As another running joke, the movie theaters back in the hills were still showing films from the [[silent movie]] era and the Hillbillies were unaware of talking pictures or more contemporary movie stars. Granny's favorite actor was [[Hoot Gibson]], but she also had an intense crush on [[William S. Hart]], and the whole Clampett family adored [[Mary Pickford]]. Silent movie legend [[Gloria Swanson]] made a memorable guest appearance on the show as herself in an episode that featured a comic parody of a silent melodrama. The Clampetts did, however, have a television, on which they watched soap operas and "[[Professional wrestling|rasslin']]", as well as [[John Wayne]] movies, as he was apparently one of the few "talkie" movie stars of whom they were aware. Wayne made a brief cameo as himself after the Clampett mansion was "attacked" by stuntmen dressed as Native Americans.

Pearl and Granny often fought for kitchen supremacy. Pearl once told Granny "a blood cousin trumps a mother-in-law". This underscored a familial disconnect between Jethro and Granny; although they shared no bloodlines, Jethro still called her "Granny" (as did everyone else on the show, including Miss Jane and the Drysdales). Other than their kitchen wars, relations between Granny and Pearl were generally friendly. The second season began with a brief mention of Pearl having moved back to the hills, an ironic departure, as it was Pearl who had urged Jed to move to California. The change came about because actress Bea Benaderet had left the show to star in ''[[Petticoat Junction]]''. Mrs. Drysdale soon became Granny's main sparring partner.

Although both Douglas and Baer were well into their twenties when the series started, during the first years of the series, their characters were supposed to be teenagers. Elly May was enrolled in an elite girls' school in the first season, although no further mention was made of her education in later episodes. Jethro was enrolled in a sixth-grade class with much younger students; a few episodes later on, the scripts suggested that he was still in school.

Should Granny or one of her kin feel lonely for the hills, banker Drysdale would bend over backwards to placate the offended subject. Drysdale went so far as to recreate the [[log cabin]] the Clampetts had lived in and place it right next to the [[swimming pool|"cee-ment pond"]] and the [[still]] Granny had installed to make [[moonshine]]. Another time Drysdale followed the Clampetts to the "Hills" and bought up the [[Silver Dollar City]] "bank" just to make sure he had a controlling interest in the Clampetts' money. One [[running gag]] was that when Jed would take money out of his pocket, Drysdale's blood pressure would go up. A similar running joke was that when it seemed the Clampetts would take their money out of his bank, Drysdale's face would turn green. A variation of the joke of Drysdale's face changing color is in one episode when, after being given some of Granny's "Tennessee Tranquilizer" (moonshine), Drysdale's face turns red.

Another frequent source of humor dealt with Jethro's endless career search, which included such diverse vocations as soda jerk, brain surgeon, Hollywood celebrity, and secret "double naught" agent/spy. Jethro coveted movie star fame and relished becoming a "playboy" like Elly's beau Dash Riprock. Jethro's stupidity usually caused such career attempts to fail spectacularly, as when he decided to open a "topless" restaurant ("The Happy Gizzard"), where the waiters and waitresses were hatless. The one time in the series when Jethro almost succeeded as a "Hollywood celebrity" was when "Cousin Roy" ([[Roy Clark]]) tried to get Jethro to back him up as a country singer in Hollywood; Jethro refused and failed as usual. Jethro did have one success, of sorts. When he rescued a Bird Watchers girl troop who fell into the "cement pond" (they were attacked by ants), Jethro got a "lifesaving badge".

Misunderstandings were a general source of humor in the program, such as when the Clampetts did not understand something they had never encountered before (such as a water faucet), or when various city dwellers could not comprehend something the Clampetts were talking about. A group of businessmen overheard Jed talking about "[[crayfish|crawdad]]s" and concluded he was discussing a new type of military vehicle, in which they wanted to invest. Conversely, when Jed muses to Mr. Brewster about whether he can afford to move to Beverly Hills, Brewster responds with, "Why, Mr. Clampett, with your money, you could afford the [[Taj Mahal]]", to which Jed rejoins, "I'll take it!" When Brewster insists he was making a joke; Jed allows that he can go right ahead. Brewster: "Well, that was the joke." Jed: "Mr. Brewster, you're an awfully nice feller, but I've heard a sight better jokes than that!"

The Clampetts went back to the hills for Christmas during the first season, but did not return there until the eighth season, during which several episodes were filmed on location in [[Kimberling City, Missouri]]. During this period, Shug Fisher and Elvia Allman joined the cast as Shorty and Elverna (Allman had appeared on an episode in the first season playing the same character).

One constant throughout the series was that the Hillbillies, who were scrupulously honest, were surrounded by cynical, conniving and money-hungry "city-folk", whose plans were always foiled (usually unknowingly) by the Clampetts.

==Reunions==

===1981 CBS TV movie===
In 1981, a ''Return of the Beverly Hillbillies'' television movie, written and produced by series creator [[Paul Henning]], was aired on the CBS network. Irene Ryan had died in 1973, and Raymond Bailey had died in 1980. The script acknowledged Granny's passing but featured [[Imogene Coca]] as Granny's mother. Max Baer decided against reprising the role that both started and stymied his career, so the character of Jethro Bodine was given to another actor, [[Ray Young (actor)|Ray Young]].

The film's plot had Jed back in his old homestead in Bug Tussle, having divided his massive fortune among Elly May and Jethro, both of whom stayed on the West Coast. Jane Hathaway had become a Department of Energy agent and was seeking Granny's "White Lightnin'" recipe to combat the [[1979 energy crisis|energy crisis]]. Since Granny had gone on to "her re-ward", it was up to Granny's centenarian "Maw" ([[Imogene Coca]]) to divulge the secret brew's ingredients. Subplots included Jethro playing an egocentric, starlet-starved Hollywood producer, Jane and her boss ([[Werner Klemperer]]) having a romance and Elly May owning a large petting zoo. The four main characters finally got together by the end of the story.

Having been filmed a mere decade after the final episode of the original series, viewer consensus was that the series' original spirit was lost to the film on many fronts, chief of which being the deaths of Ryan and Bailey and Baer's absence, which left only three of the six original cast members available to reprise their respective roles. Further subtracting from the familiarity was the fact that the legendary Clampett mansion was unavailable for a location shoot as the owners' lease was too expensive. Henning himself admitted sheer embarrassment when the finished product aired, blaming his inability to rewrite the script due to the 1981 [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]] strike.<ref>{{cite web|author=20 maart 2008 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxn4V6p1OYw |title=Paul Henning&nbsp;– Archive Interview Part 8 of 8 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

===1993 television special===
In 1993, Ebsen, Douglas, and Baer reunited onscreen for the only time in the [[CBS-TV]] retrospective television special, ''The Legend of the Beverly Hillbillies'' which ranked as the fourth most watched television program of the week—a major surprise given the mediocre rating for the 1981 TV-movie. It was a rare tribute from the "Tiffany network", which owed much of its success in the 1960s to the series, but has often seemed embarrassed by it in hindsight, often down-playing the show in retrospective television specials on the network's history and rarely inviting cast members to participate in such all-star broadcasts.

''The Legend of The Beverly Hillbillies'' special ignored several plot twists of the TV movie, notably Jethro was now not a film director but a leading Los Angeles physician. Critter-loving Elly May was still in California with her animals, but Jed was back home in the Hills, having lost his fortune, stolen by the now-imprisoned banker Drysdale. Nancy Kulp had died in 1991 and was little referred to beyond the multitude of film clips that dotted the special. The special was released on VHS tape by [[CBS/Fox Video]] in 1995 and as a bonus feature on the Official Third Season DVD Set in 2009.

==Reruns and syndication==
''The Beverly Hillbillies'' is still televised daily around the world in syndication. In the United States, the show is broadcast on [[MeTV]] and was previously on [[Nick at Nite]], [[The Hallmark Channel]], [[TV Land]] and [[WGN America]].<ref>[http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2011/07/wgn-america-fall-2011-schedule-metv.html WGN America Fall 2011 Schedule; MeTV Network Celebrates Lucille Ball's 100th Birthday With 100 Episodes of Lucy Series - SitcomsOnline.com News Blog<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A limited number of episodes from the earlier portions of the series run have turned up in the [[public domain]] and as such are seen occasionally on many smaller networks.

The show is distributed by [[CBS Television Distribution]], the syndication arm of [[CBS Television Studios]] and the CBS network. It was previously distributed by CBS Films, [[Viacom Enterprises]], [[Paramount Domestic Television]], and [[CBS Paramount Domestic Television]] (all through corporate changes involving TV distribution rights to the early CBS library). The repeats of the show that debuted on [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS Daytime]] on September 5–9, 1966 as "Mornin' Beverly Hillbillies" through September 10, 1971 and on September 13–17, 1971 as "The Beverly HILLBILLIES" lasted up to winter 1971–1972. It aired at 11:00–11:30am Eastern/10:00-10:30am Central through September 3, 1971, then moved to 10:30–11:00am Eastern/9:30-10:00am Central for the last season on CBS Daytime.

==Media==

Fifty-five episodes of the series are in the [[public domain]], (all 36 season-one episodes and 19 season-two episodes), because [[Orion Television]], successor to Filmways, neglected to renew their copyrights. As a result, these episodes have been released on home video and DVD on many low-budget labels and shown on low-power television stations and low-budget networks in {{nowrap|16-mm}} prints. In many video prints of the public domain episodes, the original theme music has been replaced by generic music due to copyright issues.

Before his death, [[Paul Henning]], whose estate now holds the original film elements to the public domain episodes, authorized [[MPI Home Video]] to release the best of the first two seasons on DVD, the first "ultimate collection" of which was released in the fall of 2005. These collections include the original, uncut versions of the first season's episodes, complete with their original theme music and opening sponsor plugs. Volume 1 has, among its bonus features, the alternate, unaired version of the pilot film, ''The Hillbillies Of Beverly Hills'' (the version of the episode that sold the series to CBS), and the "cast commercials" (cast members pitching the products of the show's sponsors) originally shown at the end of each episode.

With the exception of the public domain episodes, the copyrights to the series were renewed by Orion Television.  However, any new compilation of ''Hillbillies'' material will be copyrighted by either MPI Media Group or CBS, depending on the content of the material used.

For many years, [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|20th Century Fox]], through a joint venture with CBS called [[CBS/Fox Video]], released select episodes of ''Hillbillies'' on videocassette. After [[Viacom]] merged with CBS, [[Paramount home entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]] (the video division of Paramount Pictures, which was acquired by Viacom in 1994) took over the video rights.

In 2006, Paramount announced plans to release the copyrighted episodes in boxed sets through [[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS DVD]] later that year. The show's second season (consisting of the public domain episodes from that season) was released on DVD in Region 1 on October 7, 2008 as "...The Official Second Season". The third season was released on February 17, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beverly-Hillbillies-Season-3/10886 |title=The Beverly Hillbillies DVD news: Announcement for The Beverly Hillbillies&nbsp;– The Official 3rd Season |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref> Both seasons are available to be purchased together from major online retailers.
