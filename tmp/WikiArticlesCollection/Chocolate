'''Chocolate''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-chocolate.ogg|ˈ|tʃ|ɒ|k|l|ə|t}} is a processed, typically sweetened [[food]] produced from the seed of the tropical ''[[Theobroma cacao]]'' tree. Cacao has been cultivated for at least three millennia in [[Mexico]], [[Central America]] and [[Northern South America]]. Its earliest documented use is around 1100 BC. The majority of the [[Mesoamerican]] people made chocolate beverages, including the [[Aztec]]s, who made it into a beverage known as ''[[Aztec cuisine|xocolātl]]'' {{IPA-nah|ʃoˈkolaːt͡ɬ|}}, a [[Nahuatl]] word meaning "bitter water". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense [[bitter (taste)|bitter]] taste, and must be [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] to develop the flavor.

After fermentation, the beans are dried, then cleaned, and then roasted, and the shell is removed to produce cacao nibs. The nibs are then ground to [[cocoa mass]], pure chocolate in rough form. Because this cocoa mass usually is liquefied then molded with or without other ingredients, it is called [[chocolate liquor]]. The liquor also may be processed into two components: [[cocoa solids]] and [[cocoa butter]]. Unsweetened [[Types of chocolate|baking chocolate]] (bitter chocolate) contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of [[sweet chocolate]], combining cocoa solids, cocoa butter or other fat, and sugar. [[Milk chocolate]] is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. [[White chocolate]] contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk but no cocoa solids.

Cocoa solids contain [[alkaloid]]s such as [[theobromine]], [[phenethylamine]] and [[caffeine]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Caffeine|url=http://www0.health.nsw.gov.au/factsheets/drugandalcohol/caffeine.html|work=New South Wales Government|accessdate=2 May 2013}}</ref> These have physiological effects on the body and are linked to [[serotonin]] levels in the brain.

Chocolate has become one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and a vast number of foodstuffs involving chocolate have been created. [[Chocolate chip cookie]]s have become very common, and very popular, in most parts of Europe and North America. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes have become traditional on certain holidays. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, to produce [[chocolate milk]] and [[hot chocolate]].

Cocoa mass was used originally in [[Mesoamerica]] both as a beverage and as an ingredient in foods. Chocolate played a special role in both [[Maya peoples|Maya]] and Aztec royal and religious events. Priests presented cacao seeds as offerings to the deities and served chocolate drinks during sacred ceremonies. All the cacao-bean-growing areas conquered by the Aztecs were ordered to pay the beans as a tax, or as the Aztecs called it, a "tribute".<ref>Justin Kerr. {{Cite web|url=http://archive.fieldmuseum.org/Chocolate/history_mesoamerican7.html|title=Chocolate: A Mesoamerican Luxury 1200—1521 – Obtaining Cacao|publisher=[[Field Museum]]|accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref>

The Europeans [[sweet]]ened and fattened it by adding refined sugar and milk, two ingredients unknown to the Mexicans. By contrast, the Europeans never infused it into their general diet, but have compartmentalized its use to sweets and desserts. In the 19th century, Briton [[John Cadbury]] developed an emulsification process to make solid chocolate, creating the modern chocolate bar. Although cocoa is originally from the Americas, today Western Africa produces almost two-thirds of the world's cocoa, with [[Côte d'Ivoire]] growing almost half of it.

==Etymology==
[[File:Philippe Sylvestre Dufour Chocolat 17th century.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|200px|''"Traités nouveaux & curieux du café du thé et du chocolate"'', by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685.]]
The word "chocolate" entered the English language from Spanish.<ref name=heritagedictionary>{{Cite web|title=The American Heritage Dictionary|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/68/C0316800.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080517202741/http://www.bartleby.com/61/68/C0316800.html|archivedate=17 May 2008|accessdate=9 May 2009}}</ref> How the word came into Spanish is less certain, and there are competing explanations. Perhaps the most cited explanation is that "chocolate" comes from Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, from the word ''chocolātl'', which many sources derived from ''xocolātl'' {{IPA-nah|ʃokolaːtɬ|}}, from ''xococ'' '[[sour]]' or 'bitter', and ''ātl'' 'water' or 'drink'.<ref name=heritagedictionary/> However, as [[William Bright]] noted,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Campbell|first=Lyle|title=Quichean Linguistic Prehistory; University of California Publications in Linguistics No. 81|location=Berkeley, California|publisher=University of California Press|page=104}}</ref> the word "chocolatl" does not occur in central Mexican [[Colonisation|colonial]] sources, making this an unlikely derivation. [[Francisco J. Santamaría|Santamaria]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Santamaria|first=Francisco|title=Diccionario de Mejicanismos|place=Mexico|publisher=Editorial Porrúa S. A.|pages=412–413}}</ref> gives a derivation from the [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]] word "chokol" meaning 'hot', and the Nahuatl "atl" meaning 'water'. Sophie and [[Michael D. Coe]] agree with this etymology.

Pointing to various sources dating from the time of the Spanish conquest, they identify ''cacahuatl'' ("cacao water") as the original Nahuatl word for the cold beverage consumed by the Aztecs. Noting that using a word with ''caca'' in it to describe a thick brown beverage would not have gone over well with most speakers of Spanish because "[[wikt:caca#Spanish|caca]]" means '[[faeces]]' in Spanish, the Coes suggest that the Spanish colonisers combined the Nahuatl ''atl'' with the Yucatec Maya ''chocol'', for, unlike the Aztec, the Maya tended to drink chocolate heated. The Spanish preferred the warm Mayan preparation of the beverage to the cold Aztec one, and so the colonisers substituted ''chocol'' in place of the culturally unacceptable ''caca''.<ref name="truehistory">{{Cite book|last1=Coe|first1=Michael D.|authorlink1=Michael D.

More recently, Dakin and [[Søren Wichmann|Wichmann]] derive it from another Nahuatl term, "chicolatl" from eastern Nahuatl, meaning "beaten drink". They derive this term from the word for the frothing stick, "chicoli".<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0956536100111058|title=Cacao and Chocolate: A Uto-Aztecan perspective|year=2000|last1=Dakin|first1=Karen|last2=Wichmann|first2=Søren|journal=Ancient Mesoamerica|volume=11|pages=55–75}}</ref> However, the Coes write that ''xicalli'' referred to the gourd out of which the beverage was consumed and that the use of a frothing stick (known as a ''molinollo'') was a product of [[creolisation]] between the Spanish and Aztec; the original frothing method used by the indigenous people was simply pouring the drink from a height into another vessel.<ref name="truehistory"/>

By the 15th century, the [[Aztecs]] gained control of a large part of Mesoamerica, and adopted cacao into their culture. They associated chocolate with [[Xochiquetzal]], the goddess of fertility,<ref name="Etymology">{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090122081418/http://www.chocolate.be/eng/history/history.htm|title=Etymology of the word chocolate|accessdate=27 June 2008|publisher=Chocolate.be|year=2008}}</ref> and often used chocolate beverages as sacred offerings.<ref name="Riches" /> The Aztec adaptation of the drink was a bitter, frothy, spicy drink called ''xocolatl'', made much the same way as the Mayan chocolate drinks. It was often seasoned with [[vanilla]], [[chile pepper]], and [[achiote]], and was believed to fight [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], which is probably attributable to the theobromine content, a mood enhancer. Because cacao would not grow in the dry central Mexican highlands and had to be imported, chocolate was an important luxury good throughout the Aztec empire, and cocoa beans were often used as currency.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1990_Jan/ai_8560999|title=When cocoa was used as currency – pre-Columbian America – The Fortunes of Money|last=Peniche Rivero|first=Piedad|accessdate=26 June 2008|publisher=[[UNESCO Courier]]|year=1990}}</ref> For example, the Aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost one hundred cacao beans and one fresh [[avocado]] was worth three beans.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Bill|last=Buford|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/10/29/071029fa_fact_buford|title=Notes of a Gastronome: Extreme Chocolate: Reporting & Essays: The New Yorker|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=17 May 2008}}</ref> South American and European cultures have used cocoa to treat diarrhea for hundreds of years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-09/chr-dch092905.php|title=Dark chocolate helps diarrhea|publisher=Children's Hospital & Research Center at Oakland|accessdate=2 May 2007}}</ref> All of the areas ruled by the Aztecs were ordered to pay a tax, leading those that grew the beans to offer cacao seeds as tribute.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20030104222742/http://www.fmnh.org/chocolate/history_mesoamerican7.html|title=Chocolate: A Mesoamerican Luxury 1200—1521 – Obtaining Cacao|publisher=Field Museum|accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref>

For hundreds of years, the chocolate-making process remained unchanged. When the [[Industrial Revolution]] arrived, many changes occurred that brought about the food today in its modern form. The Dutch [[Coenraad Johannes van Houten|van Houten]] family's inventions made mass production of shiny, tasty chocolate bars and related products possible. In the 18th century, mechanical mills were created that squeezed out cocoa butter, which in turn helped to create hard, durable chocolate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.fieldmuseum.org/Chocolate/history_contemp4.html|title=Chocolate: A Contemporary Confection 1750—1910 – Making Chocolate|publisher=Field Museum|accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> But, it was not until the arrival of the Industrial Revolution that these mills were put to bigger use.

At the end of the 18th century, the first form of solid chocolate was invented in [[Turin]] by Doret. This chocolate was sold in large quantities from 1826 by [[Pierre Paul Caffarel]] in Italy. In 1819, [[François-Louis Cailler|F. L. Cailler]] opened the first [[Swiss chocolate]] factory. In 1828, [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] Coenraad Johannes van Houten patented a method for extracting the fat from cocoa beans and making powdered cocoa and cocoa butter. Van Houten also developed the "so-called" [[Dutch process chocolate|Dutch process]] of treating chocolate with [[alkali]] to remove the bitter taste. This made it possible to form the modern chocolate bar.
The German company Jordan & Timaeus sold the first known chocolate bar made from cocoa, sugar and goat's milk in 1839.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/artikel.asp?id=2919650|title=Bissfeste Körnchen statt zartem Schmelz|publisher=Sächsiche Zeitung|language=German|trans_title=Firm granules instead of melting in one's mouth|accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> In England, the company, [[J. S. Fry & Sons]] discovered a way to mix some of the cocoa butter back into the Dutched chocolate, and added sugar, creating a paste that could be moulded. This led to the first British chocolate bar in 1847, followed in 1849 by the [[Cadbury-Schweppes|Cadbury]] brothers.

In 1865, an unknown employee at the [[Ghirardelli Chocolate Company]] discovered the [[Broma process]] of separating cocoa butter from cocoa solids (namely, that if chocolate is hung in a bag in a warm room, the butter will drip out naturally over time).

[[Daniel Peter]], a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] candle maker, joined his father-in-law's chocolate business. In 1867, he began experimenting with milk as an ingredient. He brought his new product, milk chocolate, to market in 1875. He was assisted in removing the water content from the milk to prevent mildewing by a neighbour, a baby food manufacturer named [[Henri Nestlé]]. [[Rodolphe Lindt]] invented the process called ''[[Conche|conching]]'', which involves heating and grinding the chocolate solids very finely to ensure that the liquid is evenly blended. This enabled [[Milton Hershey]] to make chocolate even more popular by mass-producing affordable chocolate bars.

Several types of chocolate can be distinguished. Pure, unsweetened chocolate contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, combining chocolate with sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk.

White chocolate is formed from a mixture of sugar, cocoa butter and milk solids. Although its texture is similar to milk and dark chocolate, it does not contain any cocoa solids. Because of this, many countries do not consider white chocolate as chocolate at all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr021004.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080321150727/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr021004.html|archivedate=21 March 2008|title=US Federal Register – White Chocolate; Establishment of a Standard of Identity|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=1 June 2008}}</ref> Although first introduced by [[Hebert Candy Mansion|Hebert Candies]] in 1955, [[Mars, Incorporated]] was the first to produce white chocolate within the United States.

Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cacao mixture. The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] calls this "sweet chocolate", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.<ref name="Europa"/> Dark chocolate, with its high cocoa content, is a rich source of [[epicatechin]] and [[gallic acid]], which are thought to possess cardioprotective properties.

Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter, vanilla and sometimes [[lecithin]] have been added. It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking.

Unsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor.

Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw cacao, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cacao. Because the act of processing results in the loss of certain vitamins and minerals (such as magnesium), some consider raw cacao to be a more nutritious form of chocolate.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=hEkOVtE1SCIC&pg=PT95&dq=raw+cacao#v=onepage&q=raw%20cacao&f=false|title=The Raw Food Lifestyle: The Philosophy and Nutrition Behind Raw and Live Foods – Ruthann Russo|publisher=Google Books|date=20 October 2009|accessdate=21 April 2012|isbn=9781556439490}}</ref>

Some people who purchase chocolate off the store shelf can be disappointed when they see whitish spots on the dark chocolate part. This is called [[chocolate bloom]] and is not an indication of chocolate gone bad. Instead, this is just an indication that sugar and/or fat has separated due to poor storage.

Chocolate is any product made primarily of cocoa solids and cocoa butter.

Production costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solid content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat. Cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called "chocolate", due to the risk of lower demand for their crops.<ref name="pantograph" /> The sequencing in 2010 of genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Chocolate industry avoids collapse as genome published|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11747616|accessdate=15 November 2010|newspaper=BBC|date=14 November 2010}}</ref>

There are two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy, chocolate makers and chocolatiers. Chocolate makers use harvested cacao beans and other ingredients to produce [[couverture chocolate]] (covering). <!--(Concerning "couverture", think "covering" or "coating", but see the reference, as well.)--> Chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies ([[chocolate bar|bars]], [[chocolate truffle|truffles]], etc.).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dallasfood.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=78|title=What's Noka Worth?

===Cacao varieties===
[[File:CacaoChonita14.JPG|thumb|left|Toasted cacao beans at a chocolate workshop at the [[La Chonita Hacienda]] in [[Tabasco]], Mexico.]]
Chocolate is made from [[cocoa bean]]s, the dried and partially fermented seeds of the cacao tree (''Theobroma cacao''), a small (4–8 m (or 15–26&nbsp;ft) tall) [[evergreen]] tree native to the deep tropical region of the Americas. Recent genetic studies suggest that the most common [[genotype]] of the plant originated in the [[Amazon basin]] and was gradually transported by humans throughout South and Central America. Early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now [[Venezuela]]. The scientific name, ''[[Theobroma]]'', means "food of the [[deity|deities]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/c/cacao-02.html|title=Cacao|accessdate=27 June 2008|publisher=Botanica.com|date=1995–2008}}</ref> The fruit, called a cacao pod, is ovoid, 15–30&nbsp;cm (or 6–12 in) long and 8–10&nbsp;cm (3–4&nbsp;in) wide, ripening yellow to orange, and weighs about 500 g (1&nbsp;lb) when ripe.

[[Cacao tree]]s are small, understory trees that need rich, well-drained soils. They naturally grow within 20 degrees of either side of the equator because they need about 2000 millimeters of rainfall a year, and temperatures in the range of 21 to 32 °C. Cacao trees cannot tolerate a temperature lower than 15 °C (59 °F).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xocoatl.org/tree.htm|title=All About Chocolate: The Cacao Tree|publisher=Xocoatl|accessdate=20 December 2007}}</ref>

The three main varieties of [[cacao bean]]s used in chocolate are [[criollo (cocoa bean)|criollo]], forastero, and trinitario.

Criollos are particularly difficult to grow, as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree. The flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex, low in classic chocolate flavor, but rich in "secondary" notes of long duration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sensationalchocolates.com/ingredients.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080328013647/http://www.sensationalchocolates.com/ingredients.html|archivedate=28 March 2008|title=Sensational Chocolates: Discover the Intense Robust flavor of 100% "Grand Cru" Chocolate|publisher=Sensational Chocolates|accessdate=17 May 2008}}</ref>

The most commonly grown bean is forastero,<ref name="ww" /> a large group of wild and cultivated cacaos, most likely native to the Amazon basin. The African cocoa crop is entirely of the forastero variety. They are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo. The source of most chocolate marketed,<ref name="ww" /> forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic "chocolate" flavor, but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors, producing "quite bland" chocolate.<ref name="ww" />

Trinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero. Trinitario originated in [[Trinidad]] after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop. Nearly all cacao produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lower-grade trinitario varieties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icco.org/questions/varieties.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060218083848/http://www.icco.org/questions/varieties.htm|archivedate=18 February 2006|title=What are the varieties of cocoa?|date=21 July 1998|accessdate=27 June 2006|publisher=International Cocoa Organization}}</ref>

===Processing {{Anchor|Harvesting|Refining|Processing|Chocolate liquor}}===
[[File:Making Chocolate in Oaxaca.ogg|thumb|Video of cacao beans being ground and mixed with other ingredients to make chocolate at a [[Mayordomo]] store in [[Oaxaca de Juarez|Oaxaca]], Mexico]]
[[Cacao pod]]s are harvested by cutting the pods from the tree using a [[machete]], or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins, allowing access to microorganisms so that fermentation of the [[pectin]]-containing material can begin. [[Yeast]] produce [[ethanol]], [[lactic acid bacteria]] produce [[lactic acid]] and [[acetic acid bacteria]] produce [[acetic acid]]. The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate taste.<ref>{{Cite pmid|15462126}}</ref>

It is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or there will be insufficient sugars in the white pulp for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days.<ref name="beans">{{Cite web|url=http://www.xocoatl.org/harvest.htm|title=Harvesting the seeds|publisher=Xocoatl|accessdate=20 May 2008}}</ref>

The dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), [[dry roasting|roasted]], and graded. Next, the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib. Finally, the nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form: chocolate liquor.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Making Chocolate from Scratch|url=http://api.ning.com/files/Gr6vd-Aqjs2vj5t4p5tX-cZBB1kpTzKVDk8I59vVV6*FgB5zFYsVooD0wRRlQHO8tNMURHMwKR5hmuPX2Pe3al3iWOhcsi5S/Makingchocolatefromscratch.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2011}}</ref> The liquor can be further processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.<ref name="tree">{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070114080555/http://www.cocoatree.org/frombeantobar/atthechocolatefactory.asp|title=At the chocolate factory|publisher=The Cocoa Tree|accessdate=20 May 2008}}</ref>

===Blending===
{{Main|Types of chocolate}}
Chocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couvertures. The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are as follows:
[[File:Chocolate fountain.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fountain chocolate is made with high levels of cocoa butter, allowing it to flow gently over a [[chocolate fountain]] to serve as [[Chocolate fondue|dessert fondue]].]]
* Dark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla
* Milk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla
* White chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla

Usually, an [[emulsifying agent]], such as [[soy lecithin]], is added, though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain [[Genetically modified organism|GMO]]-free, sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using [[Polyglycerol polyricinoleate|PGPR]], an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same [[mouthfeel]].

The texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus have a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.

Different manufacturers develop their own "signature" blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark chocolate couvertures contain at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couvertures contain only about 35% cocoa.

Producers of high quality, small batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad quality chocolate.<ref name="ww"/> Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter. Vegetable oils and [[artificial flavor|artificial]] vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.<ref name="ww"/>

In 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include [[The Hershey Company|Hershey]], [[Nestlé]], and [[Archer Daniels Midland]], [[lobbying|lobbied]] the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute [[partially hydrogenated vegetable oils]] for cocoa butter, in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bragg|first=Lynn|title=Letter to CMA from President (pdf)|year=2007|url=http://www.chocolateusa.org/pdfs/CMA-stakeholder.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070604203647/http://www.chocolateusa.org/pdfs/CMA-stakeholder.pdf|archivedate=4 June 2007|accessdate=8 June 2007|format=PDF}}</ref> Currently, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) does not allow a product to be referred to as "chocolate" if the product contains any of these ingredients.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/07p0085/07p-0085.htm|title=Adopt Regulations of General Applicability to all Food Standards that would Permit, within Stated Boundaries, Deviations from the Requirements of the Individual Food Standards of Identity|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=9 June 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.typetive.com/blogimages/07p-0085AppendixC.pdf|title=2007P-0085 Appendix C Changes Allowed to Modernize Food Standards While Retaining The Basic Nature and Essential Characteristics of Standardized Food|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=9 June 2007|format=PDF}}</ref> {{-}}

===Conching===
{{Main|Conching}}
[[File:Chocolate melanger.jpg|thumb|Chocolate melanger mixing raw ingredients]]
The penultimate process is called ''conching''. A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate prior to conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72&nbsp;hours, lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to approximately {{convert|45|–|50|C|F}} until final processing.<ref name="conch">{{Cite web|first=Stephanie|last=Zonis|url=http://www.sallys-place.com/food/columns/zonis/conching.htm|title=Conching: Crucial Step in Chocolate’s Flavor and Texture?
|publisher=Sally's Place|accessdate=20 May 2008}}</ref>

===Tempering===
The final process is called ''tempering''. Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be clearly seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken.<ref name="temp"/> The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the result of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.

The fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms ([[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphous crystallization]]).<ref name="temp"/><ref name="temp2"/> The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present. The six different crystal forms have different properties.

Making chocolate considered "good" is about forming as many type V crystals as possible. This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals, so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time. To accomplish this, the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization.

Generally, the chocolate is first heated to {{convert|45|°C|°F|abbr=on}} to melt all six forms of crystals.<ref name=
"temp">{{Cite web|first=Elizabeth|last=LaBau|url=http://candy.about.com/od/candybasics/ht/temperchoc.htm|title=How To Temper Chocolate|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=20 May 2008}}</ref><ref name="temp2">{{Cite journal|title=Phase Transitions and Polymorphism of Cocoa Butter|journal=Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society|author=Loisel C, Keller G, Lecq G, Bourgaux C, Ollivon M |doi=10.1007/s11746-998-0245-y|volume=75|issue=4|pages=425–439|year=1998 |quote=See Table 2 page 426 for tempering temperatures}}</ref> Next, the chocolate is cooled to about {{convert|27|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, which will allow crystal types IV and V to form. At this temperature, the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal "seeds" which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate. The chocolate is then heated to about {{convert|31|°C|°F|abbr=on}} to eliminate any type IV crystals, leaving just type V. After this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated. However, there are other methods of chocolate tempering used. The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid "seed" chocolate. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a [[chocolate temper meter]] to ensure accuracy and consistency. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.

Two classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:
* Working the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal "seeds"; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.
* Stirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to "inoculate" the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to "seed" the molten chocolate).

Chocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate, particularly for large volume applications.

===Storage===
[[File:Ghirardelli Chocolate Shop Inside, SF, CA, jjron 25.03.2012.jpg|thumb|right|Packaged chocolate in the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company shop is stored in controlled conditions]]
Chocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between {{convert|15|and|17|C|F}}, with a relative humidity of less than 50%. Various types of "blooming" effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly. Fat bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding 24 C while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below 15 C or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. One can get rid of bloom by re-tempering the chocolate or using it for anything that requires melting the chocolate.<ref>Frederic Bau (Ed.) (2011) ''Cooking With Chocolate: Essential Recipes and Techniques'', Paris: Flammarion, S.A., p. 147. ISBN 978-2-08-020081-5.</ref>

Chocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper.

If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Moving chocolate from one temperature extreme to another, such as from a refrigerator on a hot day, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is perfectly safe for consumption.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=[[Ghirardelli]]|title=Tips for Chocolate Care|url=http://www.ghirardelli.com/chocopedia/tips.aspx|accessdate=16 April 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|first=Teresa|last=Miller|url=http://www.cals.wisc.edu/media/news/01_97/milkfat_chocolate.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070609144511/http://www.cals.wisc.edu/media/news/01_97/milkfat_chocolate.html|archivedate=9 June 2007|title=Milkfat Fractions Help Beat Blooming Chocolate|publisher=College of Agricultural Life and Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison|accessdate=16 April 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cocoabella.com/chocolates02.php|publisher=CocoaBella|title=How to Store Chocolate|accessdate=16 April 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070208160345/http://www.cocoabella.com/chocolates02.php|archivedate=8 February 2007}}</ref>

==Labeling==
Some manufacturers provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of "cocoa" or "cacao". It should be noted that this refers to the combined percentage of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in the bar, not just the percentage of cocoa solids.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Molly|last=Stevens|url=http://www.taunton.com/finecooking/articles/sorting-out-chocolate.aspx|title=Sorting Out Chocolate|publisher=[[Taunton Press|Taunton]]|accessdate=17 May 2008}}</ref>

In the United States, some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper [[hydrogenated vegetable oil]] in place of cocoa butter to be sold as "chocolate". In June 2007, as a response to consumer concern after the proposed change, the FDA reiterated "Cacao fat, as one of the signature characteristics of the product, will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/consumer/updates/foodstandards061807.html|title=FDA's Standards for High Quality Foods|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=17 May 2008}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
[[File:White-Box-of-Chocolates.jpg|thumb|A box of assorted chocolates, often given as a gift.]]

===Holidays===
Chocolate is one of the most popular holiday gifts. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes have become traditional on certain holidays: chocolate bunnies and [[Easter egg|eggs]] are popular on Easter, chocolate coins on [[Hanukkah]], snowmen and other holiday symbols on Christmas, and chocolate [[heart (symbol)|hearts]] or chocolate in heart-shaped boxes on Valentine's Day.

On [[Valentine's Day]], a box of chocolates is traditional, usually presented with flowers and a [[greeting card]]. It may be given on other holidays, and birthdays. At [[Easter customs|Easter]], chocolate eggs are traditional. This is a confection made primarily of chocolate, and can either be solid, hollow, or filled with other sweets or fondant. Many confectioners make holiday-specific chocolate candies, usually variants of their standard fare.  Hollow chocolate bunnies (Easter) and hollow [[Santa Claus]] figures (Christmas) are two examples. The [[Hallmark holiday]] International Chocolate Day is observed on 13 September by the [[National Confectioners Association]] to celebrate ''"the mysteries and joys of chocolate"''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.candy.org/?p=949| title = International Chocolate Day|publisher =Candy.org| accessdate =4 September 2012}}</ref>

===Books and film===
Chocolate has been the center of several successful book and film adaptations. In 1964, [[Roald Dahl]] published a children's novel titled ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''. The novel centers on a poor boy named Charlie Bucket who takes a tour through the greatest chocolate factory in the world, owned by [[Willy Wonka]]. Two film adaptations of the novel were produced. The first was ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'', a 1971 film which later became a [[cult classic]], and spawned the real world [[The Willy Wonka Candy Company|Willy Wonka Candy Company]], which produces chocolate products to this day. Thirty-four years later, a second film adaptation was produced, titled ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''. The 2005 film was very well received by critics<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/charlie_and_the_chocolate_factory/|title=''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' at Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=29 May 2008}}</ref> and was one of the highest grossing films that year, earning over US$470,000,000 worldwide.<ref name="box">{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=charliechocolate.htm|title=Charlie and the Chocolate Factory at Box Office Mojo|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=29 May 2008}}</ref> ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was also recognized at the [[78th Academy Awards]], where it was nominated for [[Academy Award for Costume Design#2000s|Best Costume Design]] for Gabriella Pesucci.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/78academyawards/nomswins.html|title=Nominees and Winners – 78th Annual Academy Awards|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=7 June 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080408052925/http://www.oscars.org/78academyawards/nomswins.html|archivedate=8 April 2008}}</ref>

''[[Like Water for Chocolate]]'' (''Como agua para chocolate''), a 1989 love story by novelist [[Laura Esquivel]], was adapted to film in 1992. The plot incorporates [[magical realism]] with Mexican cuisine, and the title is a [[double entendre]] in its native language, referring both to a recipe for hot chocolate and to an idiom that is a metaphor for [[sexual arousal]]. The film earned 11 [[Ariel Award]]s from the [[Academia Mexicana de Artes y Ciencias Cinematográficas]], including Best Picture.

''[[Chocolat (novel)|Chocolat]]'', a 1999 novel by [[Joanne Harris]], tells the story of Vianne Rocher, a young mother, whose confections change the lives of the townspeople.
