'''Transportation in [[Cuba]]''' is composed of a system of railways, roads, airports, waterways, ports and harbours:

==Railways==
{{Main|Ferrocarriles de Cuba}}
[[Image:Ferrocarriles de cuba map.gif|250px|right|thumb|Railway network in Cuba]]
* ''total:'' 11,968&nbsp;km (4,226&nbsp;km + 7,742&nbsp;km)
* ''[[standard gauge]]:'' 4,226&nbsp;km {{RailGauge|sg}} gauge (140&nbsp;km electrified)
* ''note:'' an additional 7,742&nbsp;km of track is used by sugar plantations; about 65% of this track is standard gauge; the rest is [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] (2003)

Cuba built the first railway system in the Spanish empire, before [[History of rail transport in Spain|the 1848 start in the Iberian peninsula]]. While the rail infrastructure dates from colonial and early republican times, passenger service along the principal Havana to Santiago corridor is increasingly reliable{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and popular with tourists{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} who can purchase tickets in [[Cuban convertible peso]]s. As with most public transport in Cuba, the vehicles used are second hand, and the flagship ''[[Tren Francés]]'' ("French train") between [[Havana]] and [[Santiago de Cuba]] is operated by coaches originally used in Europe between Paris and Amsterdam on the ex-[[Trans Europ Express|TEE]] express. The train is formed by 12 coaches and a Chinese-built [[locomotive]].

With the order of 12 new Chinese locomotives, built specially for Cuban Railways at [[China Northern Locomotives and Rolling Stock Works]], services have been improving in reliability{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}. Those benefiting the most are long distance freight services with the French train Havana-Santiago being the only passenger train using one of the new Chinese locomotives regularly.  Various orders are in place for 100 locomotives from China and various freight wagons and passenger coaches.

Metro systems are not present in the island, although a [[Havana Suburban Railway|suburban rail network]] exists in [[Havana]].<ref>See: [[:es:Red del ferrocarril suburbano de La Habana]] and [[:File:Esquema ferrocarril habana.png]]</ref> Urban tramways worked until the half of 20th century in the cities of Havana, [[Matanzas]], [[Cárdenas, Cuba|Cárdenas]], [[Cienfuegos]], [[Camagüey]] and [[Santiago de Cuba]].<ref>[http://www.tramz.com/cu/tto.html "The tramways of Cuba" by Allen Morrison]: Infos, maps, pictures.</ref>

==Roads==
{{see also|Roads in Cuba}}
[[Image:Via Blanca-Matanzas.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Via Blanca highway near [[Matanzas, Cuba|Matanzas]]]]
The total length of Cuba's highways is 60,858&nbsp;km, including
*''paved:'' 29,820&nbsp;km (including 915&nbsp;km of expressways)<ref name=a>Source: ''Mapa de Carreteras de Cuba'' (Road map of Cuba, including the roads officially classified as ''Autopistas''). Ediciones GEO, [[Havana]] 2011 - ISBN 959-7049-21-X</ref>
*''unpaved:'' 31,038&nbsp;km (1999 est.)

Expressways ([[Controlled-access highway|autopistas]]) include:
*the Autopista Nacional (A1) from Havana to [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]] and [[Sancti Spiritus, Cuba|Sancti Spiritus]], with additional short sections near [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]] and [[Guantanamo]]
*the Autopista Este-Oeste (A4) from Havana to [[Pinar del Río]]
*the Autopista del Mediodia from Havana to [[San Antonio de los Baños]]
*an autopista from Havana to [[Melena del Sur]]
*an autopista from Havana to [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]]
*the Havana ring road ({{lang-es|1er anillo de La Habana|links=no}}), which starts at a [[:es:Túnel de La Habana|tunnel]] under the entrance to [[Havana Harbor]]
*the section of the [[Via Blanca (Cuba)|Via Blanca]] from [[Matanzas]] to [[Varadero]] (toll road)
*an autopista from [[Nueva Gerona]] to [[Santa Fe, Isle of Youth|Santa Fe]], in the [[Isla de la Juventud]]

Older roads include the [[Carretera Central (Cuba)|Carretera Central]], and the Via Blanca from Havana to Matanzas.

==Long-distance and inter-municipality buses in Cuba==
There are two national bus companies in Cuba. [http://www.viazul.com/ Viazul] operate a fleet of modern and comfortable coaches on longer distance routes designed principally for tourists. Schedules, prices and ticket booking can be done on line, at any of the major international airports or National Terminals across Cuba.

AstroBus, a bus service in Cuban National Pesos, designed to bring comfortable air conditioned coaches to Cuban locals at an affordable price.  The AstroBus lines operate with modern Chinese YUTONG buses, and are accessible to Cuban Residents of Cuba with their ID Card, and is payable in Cuba Pesos.  Routes that have benefited most so far are those from Havana to each of the 13 provincial capitals of the country.

==Urban buses==

[[Image:Autobus de TUSSAM en La Habana.jpg|thumb|A decommissioned bus from [[Seville]], now operating in Havana]]
In Havana urban transportation is provided by a colourful selection of buses imported from the Soviet Union or Canada. Many of these vehicles are second hand (such as the 1500 decommissioned Dutch buses, which the Netherlands donated to Cuba in the mid-1990s) and despite the United States trade embargo, American-style [[yellow school bus]]es (imported second-hand from Canada) are increasingly common sights. On seven key lines in and out of the city, service is provided by ''camellos'' ("camels" or "dromedaries", after their "humps"), [[trailer bus]]es that haul as many as two hundred passengers in a passenger carrying trailer. The camellos will be phased out in April 2008 with Chinese [[Zhengzhou Yutong Bus]]es.

After the upgrading of [[Seville]]'s public bus fleet to [[Compressed natural gas|CNG-powered]] and new vehicles, many of the [[IVECO|decommissioned ones]] were donated to the city of Havana. These bright orange buses still display the name of ''Transportes Urbanos de Sevilla, S.A.M.'', their former owner, and Seville's coat of arms as a sign of gratitude.<ref>The last lot was delivered in 2006: [http://www.sevilla.org/impe/sevilla/contenido?pag=/contenidos/centro_prensa/noticias_2006/Julio/28_07_2006_m&vE=D4268,9,15 "Entrega de 16 autobuses de TUSSAM a la Habana como gesto solidario"], nota de prensa del Ayuntamiento de Sevilla</ref>
<br clear=left>

On 18 July 2007 it was reported that Cuba will receive 100 urban buses from Belarus before years end, destined for use in Havana.<ref>[http://www.cubaheadlines.com/2007/07/18/4520/belarus_to_ship_100_urban_buses_to_cuba_by_late_2007.html "Belarus to ship 100 urban buses to Cuba by late 2007"] ''Cuban Daily News''</ref>

Cuban State Council Vice President Carlos Lage declared in 2007 that Cuba would receive 1,142 more Chinese buses for urban transport before years end<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2007-10/03/content_6151768.htm Cuba praises high quality of Chinese-made buses<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Automobiles ==
[[File:Cuban car.JPG|thumbnail|2011 A Cuban car]]
{{see also|Yank tank}}
Cuba is famous for its old cars and trucks, which can be seen in daily use throughout the country. For the first part of the 20th century, most new vehicles came to Cuba from the United States. The flow stopped in late 1959 when economic reforms by the then-new government of Fidel Castro prevented Cubans from buying cars on credit.<ref>[http://caristas.blogspot.com/2008/12/its-widely-held-that-flow-of-american.html Don't blame Dwight]</ref> A subsequent U.S. trade embargo, instituted in October 1960 in response to Cuba's seizure of U.S.-owned properties,<ref>Gebler, Carlo. ''Driving Through Cuba (an East-West Journey)''. London. Hamish Hamilton Ltd., 1988. ISBN 0-241-12286-4 p.12</ref> not only ensured that new vehicle exports would remain halted, but also denied Cuban motorists a direct source of replacement parts. As a result, Cubans became expert at adapting or fabricating parts to keep on the road cars that in other countries would long since have been recycled.<ref>Schweid, Richard. ''Che's Chevrolet, Fidel's Oldsmobile (On the Road in Cuba)''. Chapel Hill, London. University of North Carolina Press, 2004. ISBN 0-8078-2892-0 p.196</ref>

The Soviet Union supplied the island with Volgas, Moskvich 1500s, Ladas and other Eastern Bloc cars, mainly for state use. The Soviet Union also sent heavy trucks such as the ubiquitous ZIL and the rugged KrAZ.<ref>http://caristas.blogspot.com/2010/12/kraz-king-kong-of-trucks.html</ref> Cars also trickled in from Europe and, in later years, Asia. Since 2009, Cuba has imported sedans from Chinese automaker [[Geely]] to serve as police cars, taxis and rental vehicles.<ref>http://caristas.blogspot.com/2011/01/geely-prounced-jee-lee-or-in-cuba-heely.html</ref>

While many older Soviet and European cars remain in service in Cuba, they are largely eclipsed by the island's great 1950s Cadillacs, Packards,  De Sotos and similar products from one of the most ornate styling periods in U.S. auto history. Their pastel colours, tall fins and extensive chrome make them a favourite subject for tourist photographs.

As many as 60,000 American vehicles are in use on the island,<ref>Schweid, Richard. ''Che's Chevrolet, Fidel's Oldsmobile (On the Road in Cuba)''. Chapel Hill, London. University of North Carolina Press, 2004. ISBN 0-8078-2892-0</ref> nearly all in private hands. Pre-1960 vehicles remain the property of their original owners and descendants, and can be sold to other Cubans providing the proper ''traspaso'' certificate is in place. Such transactions can be difficult,<ref>http://caristas.blogspot.com/2009/04/and-sometimes-their-money-is-no-good.html</ref> but in 2010, reforms approved by a Communist Party congress were expected to legalize the sale between Cuban citizens of all cars, as well as real estate.<ref>Associated Press, May 9, 2011, "Cuba publishes awaited details of economic changes", http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h58oM9YBK_FAA4jVfqAnYftEVKcA?docId=981469f3f267429fb37d216f40bb94c6</ref>

Of Cuba's vintage American cars, many have been modified with newer engines, disc brakes and other parts, often scavenged from Soviet cars, and most bear the marks of decades of use.<ref>Schweid, Richard. ''Che's Chevrolet, Fidel's Oldsmobile (On the Road in Cuba)''. Chapel Hill, London. University of North Carolina Press, 2004. ISBN 0-8078-2892-0  p.196</ref> Others, however, have been lovingly preserved in their original condition, and would be coveted by collectors in other countries.<ref>http://caristas.blogspot.com/2011/01/sweetest-55-in-cuba.html</ref> Apart from a brief period in the 1990s, however, the Castro government has forbidden the sale of Cuban vehicles to foreigners.

=== Hitchhiking and carpooling ===
Since the start of the "[[Special Period]]" in 1991 ([[energy shortages]] caused by the loss of the Soviet Union as a trading partner), hitchhiking and carpooling have become important parts of Cuba's transportation system and society in general.  In 1999, an article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine claimed "In Cuba[...] hitchhiking is custom. Hitchhiking is essential. Hitchhiking is what makes Cuba move."<ref>http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,36287,00.html#ixzz1Ch67vm4p</ref>
