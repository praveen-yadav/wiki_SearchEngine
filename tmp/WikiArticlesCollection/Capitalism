'''Capitalism''' is an [[economic system]] in which trade, industry and the [[means of production]] are controlled by private owners with the goal of making [[Profit (economics)|profits]] in a [[market economy]].<ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/capitalism "Capitalism"] ''Oxford Dictionaries''.

The extent to which different markets are free, as well as the rules defining private property, is a matter of politics and [[policy]].

The term ''capitalism'', in its modern sense, is often attributed to [[Karl Marx]].<ref name="Scott">{{cite book |title=Industrialism: A Dictionary of Sociology|author=Scott, John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title="capitalism, n.2".

However, Marx rarely used the term "capitalism", although it was used twice in the more political interpretations of his work, which were primarily authored by his collaborator [[Friedrich Engels]]. In the 20th century defenders of the capitalist system often replaced the term ''capitalism'' with phrases such as ''free enterprise'' and ''private enterprise'' and replaced ''capitalist'' with ''[[rentier]]'' and ''[[investor]]'' in reaction to the negative connotations associated with capitalism.<ref name="Williams 1983 51">{{cite book |last= Williams|first= Raymond |title= Keywords: A vocabulary of culture and society, revised edition|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 1983|month= |isbn= 0-19-520469-7|page = 51|chapter= Capitalism}}</ref>

==Economic elements==
There are a number of different elements in the capitalist socio-economic system.

Capitalism is defined as a social and economic system that in which capital assets are mainly owned and controlled by private persons, labor is purchased for money wages, capital gains accrue to private owners, and the price mechanism is utilized to allocate capital goods between uses. The extent to which the price mechanism is used, the degree of competitiveness, and government intervention in markets distinguish exact forms of capitalism.<ref name="Modern Economics 1986, p. 54"/>

There are different variations of capitalism which have different relationships to markets and the state. In free-market and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' forms of capitalism, markets are utilized most extensively with minimal or no regulation over the pricing mechanism. In [[State intervention|interventionist]] and mixed economies, markets continue to play a dominant role but are regulated to some extent by government in order to correct [[market failure]]s, promote [[social welfare]], conserve natural resources, and fund [[military|defense]] and [[public safety]]. In [[state capitalist]] systems, markets are relied upon the least, with the state relying heavily on [[state-owned enterprises]] or indirect economic planning to accumulate capital.

Capitalism and capitalist economics is generally considered to be the opposite of [[socialism]], which contrasts with all forms of capitalism in the following ways: [[social ownership]] of the means of production, where returns on the means of production accrue to society at large, and goods and services are produced [[Production for use|directly for their utility]] (as opposed to being produced by profit-seeking businesses).

===Money, capital, and accumulation===
Money is primarily a standardized medium of exchange, and final means of payment, that serves to measure the value of all goods and commodities in a standard of value. It is an abstraction of economic value and medium of exchange that eliminates the cumbersome system of [[barter]] by separating the transactions involved in the exchange of products, thus greatly facilitating specialization and trade through encouraging the exchange of commodities. Capitalism involves the further abstraction of money into other exchangeable [[asset]]s and the accumulation of money through ownership, exchange, interest and various other [[financial instrument]]s.

The [[accumulation of capital]] refers to the process of "making money", or growing an initial sum of money through investment in production. Capitalism is based around the accumulation of capital, whereby [[financial capital]] is invested in order to realize a profit and then reinvested into further production in a continuous process of accumulation. In Marxian economic theory, this dynamic is called the [[law of value]].

===Capital and financial markets===
The defining feature of capitalist markets, in contrast to markets and exchange in pre-capitalist societies like [[feudalism]], is the existence of a market for capital goods (the means of production), meaning exchange-relations (business relationships) exist within the production process. Additionally, capitalism features a [[Labor market|market for labor]]. This distinguishes the capitalist market from pre-capitalist societies which generally only contained market exchange for final goods and secondary goods. The "market" in capitalism refers to [[capital market]]s and [[financial market]]s. Thus, there are three main markets in a typical capitalistic economy: labor, goods and services, and financial.

===Wage labor and class structure===
[[Wage labor]] refers to the class-structure of capitalism, whereby workers receive either a wage or a salary, and owners receive the [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] generated by the factors of production employed in the production of economic value. Individuals who possess and supply financial capital to productive ventures become owners, either jointly (as [[shareholders]]) or individually. In Marxian economics these owners of the means of production and suppliers of capital are generally called ''capitalists''. The description of the role of the ''capitalist'' has shifted, first referring to a useless intermediary between producers to an employer of producers, and eventually came to refer to owners of the means of production.<ref name="Williams 1983 51"/> The term ''capitalist'' is not generally used by supporters of mainstream economics.

"Workers" includes those who expend both manual and mental (or creative) labor in production, where production does not simply mean physical production but refers to the production of both tangible and [[Social capital|intangible]] economic value. "Capitalists" are individuals who derive income from [[investments]].

[[Labor (economics)|Labor]] includes all physical and mental human resources, including entrepreneurial capacity and management skills, which are needed to produce products and services. [[Production (economics)|Production]] is the act of making goods or services by applying [[labor power]].<ref>Ragan, Christopher T.S., and Richard G. Lipsey. ''Microeconomics''. Twelfth Canadian Edition ed. Toronto: Pearson Education Canada, 2008. Print.</ref><ref>Robbins, Richard H. ''Global problems and the culture of capitalism''. Boston: Allyn & Bacon, 2007. Print.</ref>

===Macroeconomics===
Macroeconomics keeps its eyes on things such as inflation: a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money; growth: how much money a government has and how quickly it accrues money; [[unemployment]], and rates of trade between other countries. Whereas microeconomics deals with individual firms, people, and other institutions that work within a set frame work of rules to balance prices and the workings of a singular government.

Both micro and macroeconomics work together to form a single set of evolving rules and regulations. Governments (the macroeconomic side) set both national and international regulations that keep track of prices and corporations' (microeconomics) growth rates, set prices, and trade, while the corporations influence what federal laws are set.<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor|first=Timothy|title=Principles of Economics: Economics and the Economy|year=2011|publisher=Textbook Media|location=USA|isbn=1-930789-13-0|page=744|url=http://www.texbookmedia.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Reisman|first=George|title=Economics and capitalism|url=http://www.capitalism.net/Capitalism/Economics%20and%20Capitalism.htm|work=CAPITALISM: A TREATISE ON ECONOMICS|publisher=The Jefferson School of Philosophy, Economics, and Psychology|accessdate=18 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Scott|first=Bruce R.|title=The Political Economy of Capitalism Bruce R.|url=http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/07-037.pdf|publisher=Harvard Business School|accessdate=20 February 2012}}</ref>

==Types of capitalism==
There are many variants of capitalism in existence that differ according to country and region. They vary in their institutional makeup and by their economic policies. The common features among all the different forms of capitalism is that they are based on the production of goods and services for profit, predominately market-based allocation of resources, and they are structured upon the accumulation of capital. The major forms of capitalism are listed below:

===Mercantilism===
{{Main|Mercantilism|Protectionism}}
Mercantilism is a nationalist form of early capitalism that came into existence approximately in the late 16th century. It is characterized by the intertwining of national business interests to state-interest and imperialism, and consequently, the state apparatus is utilized to advance national business interests abroad. An example of this is colonists living in America who were only allowed to trade with and purchase goods from their respective mother countries (Britain, France, etc.). Mercantilism holds that the wealth of a nation is increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations, and corresponds to the phase of capitalist development called the [[Primitive accumulation of capital]].

===Free-market capitalism===
{{See also|Free market|Laissez-faire}}
Free-market capitalism refers to an economic system where prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy. It typically entails support for highly competitive markets, private ownership of productive enterprises. ''Laissez-faire'' is a more extensive form of free-market capitalism where the role of the state is limited to protecting [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]].

===Social-market economy===
{{Main|Social market|Nordic model}}
A social-market economy is a nominally free-market system where government intervention in price formation is kept to a minimum but the state provides significant services in the area of social security, unemployment benefits and recognition of [[labor rights]] through national [[collective bargaining]] arrangements. This model is prominent in Western and Northern European countries, and Japan, albeit in slightly different configurations. The vast majority of enterprises are privately owned in this economic model.

[[Rhine capitalism]] refers to the contemporary model of capitalism and adaptation of the social market model that exists in continental Western Europe today.

===State capitalism===
{{Main|State capitalism}}
[[State capitalism]] consists of state ownership of the means of production within a state, and the organization of state enterprises as commercial, profit-seeking businesses. The debate between proponents of private versus state capitalism is centered around questions of managerial efficacy, productive efficiency, and fair distribution of wealth.

According to Aldo Musacchio, a professor at Harvard Business School, it is a system in which governments, whether democratic or autocratic, exercise a widespread influence on the economy, through either direct ownership or various subsidies. Musacchio also emphasizes the difference between today's state capitalism and its predecessors. Gone are the days when governments appointed bureaucrats to run companies. The world's largest state-owned enterprises are traded on the public markets and kept in good health by large institutional investors.<ref>{{cite web |last=Musacchio |first=Aldo |url=http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/802 |title=Economist Debates: State capitalism: Statements}}</ref>

===Corporate capitalism===
{{Main|Corporate capitalism}}
{{See also|State monopoly capitalism|Crony capitalism}}
Corporate capitalism is a free or mixed-market economy characterized by the dominance of hierarchical, bureaucratic corporations. State-monopoly capitalism was originally a [[Marxist]] concept referring to a form of corporate capitalism in which state policy is utilized to benefit and promote the interests of dominant or established corporations by shielding them from competitive pressures or by providing them with subsidies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Mixed economy===
{{Main|Mixed economy}}
{{See also|Economic interventionism}}
A mixed economy is a largely market-based economy consisting of both private and public ownership of the means of production and [[economic interventionism]] through macroeconomic policies intended to correct [[market failure]]s, reduce unemployment and keep inflation low. The degree of intervention in markets varies among different countries. Some mixed economies, such as France under [[dirigisme]], also featured a degree of [[Indicative planning|indirect economic planning]] over a largely capitalist-based economy.

Most capitalist economies are defined as "mixed economies" to some degree.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The term ''capitalist'' as referring to an owner of capital (rather than its meaning of someone adherent to the economic system) shows earlier recorded use than the term ''capitalism'', dating back to the mid-17th century. ''Capitalist'' is derived from ''capital'', which evolved from ''capitale'', a late [[Latin]] word based on ''caput'', meaning "head" — also the origin of ''[[Personal property|chattel]]'' and ''[[cattle]]'' in the sense of movable property (only much later to refer only to livestock). Capitale emerged in the 12th to 13th centuries in the sense of referring to funds, stock of merchandise, sum of money, or money carrying interest.<ref name="Braudel on capitalism">Braudel p. 232</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|cattle}}</ref><ref name="OED">James Augustus Henry Murray.

[[Benjamin Disraeli]] used the term ''capitalist'' in his 1845 work ''[[Sybil (novel)|Sybil]]''.<ref name="OED"/> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] used the term ''capitalist'' (''Kapitalist'') in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848) to refer to a private owner of capital.

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED), the term ''capitalism'' was first used by novelist [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] in 1854 in ''[[The Newcomes]]'', where he meant "having ownership of capital".<ref name="OED">James Augustus Henry Murray. "Capitalism" p. 94.</ref> Also according to the OED, [[Carl Adolph Douai]], a [[German-American]] [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]], used the term ''private capitalism'' in 1863.

The initial usage of the term ''capitalism'' in its modern sense has been attributed to [[Louis Blanc]] in 1850 and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in 1861.<ref>Braudel, Fernand. ''The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism 15th–18th Century'', Harper and Row, 1979, p. 237</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] referred to the ''capitalistic system'' (''kapitalistisches System'')<ref>Karl Marx.

Marx did not extensively use the form ''capitalism'', but instead those of ''capitalist'' and ''capitalist mode of production'', which appear more than 2600 times in the trilogy ''Das Kapital''.

Marx's notion of the capitalist mode of production is characterised as a system of primarily private ownership of the means of production in a mainly market economy, with a legal framework on [[commerce]] and a physical [[infrastructure]] provided by the state. He believed that no legal framework was available to protect the laborers, and so exploitation by the companies was rife.<ref>Karl Marx. ''Das Kapital''.</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Engels made more frequent use of the term ''capitalism''; volumes II and III of ''Das Kapital'', both edited by Engels after Marx's death, contain the word "capitalism" four and three times, respectively. The three combined volumes of ''Das Kapital'' (1867, 1885, 1894) contain the word ''capitalist'' more than 2,600 times.

An 1877 work entitled ''Better Times'' by Hugh Gabutt and an 1884 article in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' also used the term ''capitalism''.<ref name="OED"/> A later use of the term ''capitalism'' to describe the production system was by the German economist [[Werner Sombart]], in his 1902 book ''The Jews and Modern Capitalism'' (''Die Juden und das Wirtschaftsleben''). Sombart's close friend and colleague, [[Max Weber]], also used ''capitalism'' in his 1904 book ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (''Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus'').

==History==
{{Main|History of capitalism}}

Economic trade for profit has existed since at least the second millennium BC.<ref name="WarburtonDavid">Warburton, David, Macroeconomics from the beginning: The General Theory, Ancient Markets, and the Rate of Interest. Paris: Recherches et Publications, 2003.p49</ref> However, historians often trace capitalism in its modern form to the mercantilism of the 16th to the 18th Centuries.

===Mercantilism===
{{Main|Mercantilism}}
[[File:Lorrain.seaport.jpg|right|thumb|A painting of a French seaport from 1638 at the height of [[mercantilism]].]]

The European economy between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries is commonly labelled as [[mercantilism]].<ref name="Burnham">{{cite book |author=Burnham, Peter|title=Capitalism: The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003}}</ref> This period, the [[Age of Discovery]], saw geographic exploration being exploited by merchant overseas traders, especially from Russia, France, Spain, Portugal, England and the [[Low Countries]]; the [[European colonization of the Americas]]; and the rapid growth in overseas trade. Mercantilism involved trade for profit, although commodities were still largely produced by non-capitalist production methods.<ref name="Scott" />

While some scholars see mercantilism as the earliest stage of capitalism, others argue that capitalism did not emerge until later. For example, [[Karl Polanyi]], noted that "mercantilism, with all its tendency toward commercialization, never attacked the safeguards which protected [the] two basic elements of production—labor and land—from becoming the elements of commerce"; thus mercantilist attitudes towards economic regulation were closer to feudalist attitudes, "they disagreed only on the methods of regulation".

Moreover, Polanyi saw the hallmark of capitalism as the establishment of generalized markets for what he referred to as the "fictitious commodities": land, labor, and money. Accordingly, "not until 1834 was a competitive labor market established in England, hence industrial capitalism as a social system cannot be said to have existed before that date."<ref>Polanyi, Karl. ''The Great Transformation''. Beacon Press, Boston. 1944. p. 87</ref>

Evidence of long-distance merchant-driven trade motivated by profit exists from as early as the second millennium BCE, with the [[Old Assyrian Empire|Old Assyrian]] merchants.<ref name="WarburtonDavid" /> The earliest forms of mercantilism date back to the [[Roman Empire]] and [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]]. When the Roman Empire expanded, the mercantilist economy expanded throughout Europe. After the [[decline of the Roman Empire|collapse of the Roman Empire]], local [[feudal]] powers came to control most of the European economy, and mercantilism collapsed there; however, mercantilism persisted in [[Arabia]], the [[silk road|silk-road]] trade-routes continued, and mercantilism cycled following dynasty rise and collapse in East Asia. Due to their proximity to neighboring countries, the Arabs established trade routes to [[Egypt]], [[Persia]], and [[Byzantium]]. As [[Islam]] spread in the 7th century, mercantilism spread rapidly to Spain, Portugal, [[Northern Africa]], and Asia. Mercantilism revived in Greater Europe in the 14th century, as mercantilism spread from Portugal and Spain.<ref>

The doctrine of [[bullionism]], a major tenet of mercantilist theory, stressed the importance of accumulating [[precious metal]]s. Mercantilists argued that a state should export more goods than it imported so that foreigners would have to pay the difference in precious metals. Mercantilists argued that only raw materials that could not be extracted at home should be imported; and promoted government [[subsidy|subsidies]] (such as the granting of monopolies and protective [[tariff]]s) which mercantilists regarded as necessary to encourage home production of manufactured goods.

European [[merchant]]s, backed by state controls, subsidies, and [[monopoly|monopolies]], made most of their profits from the buying and selling of goods. In the words of [[Francis Bacon]], mercantilism aimed at "the opening and well-balancing of trade; the cherishing of manufacturers; the banishing of idleness; the repressing of waste and excess by sumptuary laws; the improvement and husbanding of the soil; the regulation of prices&nbsp;..."<ref>Quoted in Sir George Clark, ''The Seventeenth Century'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1961), p. 24.</ref>

Similar practices of economic regimentation had begun earlier in medieval European towns. However, under mercantilism, given the contemporaneous rise of political [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]], the state superseded the system of local [[guild]]s as the regulator of the economy. During that time the guilds essentially functioned like [[cartels]] that monopolized the quantity of craftsmen to earn above-market wages.<ref>Mancur Olson, ''The rise and decline of nations: economic growth, stagflation, and social rigidities'' (New Haven & London 1982).</ref>

From the 18th century, the commercial stage of capitalism originated from the start of the [[British East India Company]] (founded in 1600) and the [[Dutch East India Company]] (founded in 1602).<ref name=Banaji>

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] predicted that nations would move away from a capitalist model, and embrace lots of socialist ideologies similar to what is seen in many European countries.  He considered it to be the result of a compromise or truce between capitalism and communism, but in reality this topic is actually hotly debated and many people and nations disagree on both sides of the political spectrum.<ref>Yuichi Shionoya, ''Schumpeter and the Idea of Social Science: A Metatheoretical Study''.

A new group of economic theorists, led by [[David Hume]]<ref>{{cite book |author=Hume, David|title=Political Discourses|location=Edinburgh|publisher=A. Kincaid &amp; A. Donaldson|year=1752}}</ref> and [[Adam Smith]], in the mid-18th century, challenged fundamental [[mercantilist]] doctrines as the belief that the amount of the world's wealth remained constant and that a state could only increase its wealth at the expense of another state.

During the Industrial Revolution, the industrialist replaced the merchant as a dominant actor in the capitalist system and affected the decline of the traditional handicraft skills of [[artisan]]s, guilds, and [[journeyman|journeymen]]. Also during this period, the surplus generated by the rise of commercial agriculture encouraged increased mechanization of agriculture. Industrial capitalism marked the development of the [[factory]] system of manufacturing, characterized by a complex [[division of labor]] between and within work process and the routine of work tasks; and finally established the global domination of the capitalist mode of production.<ref name="Burnham" />

Britain also abandoned its [[protectionist]] policy, as embraced by mercantilism. In the 19th century, [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], who based their beliefs on the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]], initiated a movement to lower tariffs.<ref name="laissezf">{{cite web |title=laissez-faire|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/la/laissezf.html}}</ref> In the 1840s, Britain adopted a less protectionist policy, with the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] and the [[Navigation Acts]].<ref name="Burnham" /> Britain reduced [[tariffs]] and [[import quota|quotas]], in line with Adam Smith and David Ricardo's advocacy for [[free trade]].

Karl Polanyi argued that capitalism did not emerge until the progressive commodification of land, money, and labor culminating in the establishment of a generalized labor market in Britain in the 1830s. For Polanyi, "the extension of the market to the elements of industry – land, labor and money – was the inevitable consequence of the introduction of the factory system in a commercial society."<ref>Polanyi, Karl. ''The Great Transformation'', Beacon Press.

In the period following the global depression of the 1930s, the state played an increasingly prominent role in the capitalistic system throughout much of the world.

After [[World War II]], a broad array of new analytical tools in the [[social sciences]] were developed to explain the social and economic trends of the period, including the concepts of [[post-industrial society]] and the [[welfare state]].<ref name="Burnham" /> This era was greatly influenced by [[Keynesian]] economic stabilization policies. The postwar boom ended in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the situation was worsened by the rise of [[stagflation]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Barnes, Trevor J.|title=Reading economic geography|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-631-23554-X|page=127|year=2004}}</ref>

In particular, [[monetarism]], a theoretical alternative to Keynesianism that is more compatible with ''laissez-faire'', gained increasing prominence in the capitalist world, especially under the leadership of [[Ronald Reagan]] in the US and [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the UK in the 1980s. Public and political interest began shifting away from the so-called [[collectivist]] concerns of Keynes's managed capitalism to a focus on individual choice, called "remarketized capitalism." <ref name="Fulcher, James 2004">Fulcher, James. Capitalism. 1st ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref>  In the eyes of many economic and political commentators, the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] brought further evidence of the superiority of market capitalism over planned economy.

===Welfare economics===
Modern [[welfare economics]] has produced a number of detailed defenses of the mixed capitalist economy based on public ownership of infrastructure and defense of positive human rights such as housing or education. [[Amartya Sen]] in particular, in ''[[Development as Freedom]]'', his Nobel Prize winning work, argued that the optimal economic system is a democratic [[mixed economy]] with a [[welfare state]].<ref>Amartya Sen, ''Development as Freedom''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 1999.</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2013}}.

===Globalization===
{{Main|Globalization}}
Although [[international trade]] has been associated with the development of capitalism for over five hundred years, some thinkers argue that a number of trends associated with [[globalization]] have acted to increase the mobility of people and capital since the last quarter of the 20th century, combining to circumscribe the room to maneuver of states in choosing non-capitalist models of development. Today, these trends have bolstered the argument that capitalism should now be viewed as a truly [[World-systems theory|world system]].<ref name="Burnham" /> However, other thinkers argue that globalization, even in its quantitative degree, is no greater now than during earlier periods of capitalist trade.<ref>{{cite book |title=After the New Economy |last=Henwood |first=Doug |publisher=New Press |date=1 October 2003 |isbn=1-56584-770-9}}</ref>

==Perspectives==

===Classical political economy===
{{Main|Classical economics|Classical liberalism}}

[[File:Smith.gif|thumb|right|[[Adam Smith]]]]
The [[classical economics|classical school of economic thought]] emerged in Britain in the late 18th century. The classical political economists [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], and [[John Stuart Mill]] published analyses of the production, distribution and exchange of goods in a [[market]] that have since formed the basis of study for most contemporary economists.

In France, 'Physiocrats' like [[François Quesnay]] promoted [[free trade]] based on a conception that wealth originated from land. Quesnay's ''Tableau Économique'' (1759), described the economy analytically and laid the foundation of the Physiocrats' economic theory, followed by [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]] who opposed tariffs and [[customs duties]] and advocated [[free trade]]. [[Richard Cantillon]] defined long-run equilibrium as the balance of flows of income, and argued that the [[supply and demand]] mechanism around land influenced short-term prices.

Smith's attack on [[mercantilism]] and his reasoning for "the system of natural liberty" in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) are usually taken as the beginning of classical political economy. Smith devised a set of concepts that remain strongly associated with capitalism today. His theories regarding the "[[invisible hand]]" are commonly interpreted to mean individual pursuit of self-interest unintentionally producing collective good for society. It was necessary for Smith to be so forceful in his argument in favor of free markets because he had to overcome the popular mercantilist sentiment of the time period.<ref>Degen, Robert. ''The Triumph of Capitalism''. 1st ed. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2008.</ref>

He criticized monopolies, tariffs, duties, and other state enforced restrictions of his time and believed that the market is the most fair and efficient arbitrator of resources. This view was shared by [[David Ricardo]], second most important of the classical political economists and one of the most influential economists of modern times.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hunt, E.K.|title=History of Economic Thought: A Critical Perspective|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2002|page=92}}</ref>

In ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' (1817), he developed the law of [[comparative advantage]], which explains why it is profitable for two parties to trade, even if one of the trading partners is more efficient in every type of economic production. This principle supports the economic case for [[free trade]]. Ricardo was a supporter of [[Say's Law]] and held the view that full employment is the normal equilibrium for a competitive economy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1991|page=91}}</ref> He also argued that [[inflation]] is closely related to changes in quantity of money and [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and was a proponent of the law of [[diminishing returns]], which states that each additional unit of input yields less and less additional output.<ref name="Skousen2001">{{cite book |author=Skousen, Mark|title=The Making of Modern Economics: The Lives and Ideas of the Great Thinkers|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2001|pages=98–102, 134}}</ref>

The values of classical political economy are strongly associated with the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] doctrine of minimal government intervention in the economy, though it does not necessarily oppose the state's provision of a few basic [[public goods]].<ref name="aaron2003">Eric Aaron, ''What's Right?'' (Dural, Australia: Rosenberg Publishing, 2003), 75.</ref> Classical liberal thought has generally assumed a clear division between the economy and other realms of social activity, such as the state.<ref>{{cite book |title=Capitalism: Dictionary of the Social Sciences|author=Calhoun, Craig|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002}}</ref>

While economic liberalism favors markets unfettered by the government, it maintains that the state has a legitimate role in providing [[public good]]s.<ref name = "econlib"/> For instance, Adam Smith argued that the state has a role in providing roads, canals, schools and bridges that cannot be efficiently implemented by private entities. However, he preferred that these goods should be paid proportionally to their consumption (e.g. putting a [[Toll road|toll]]). In addition, he advocated [[Free trade area|retaliatory tariffs]] to bring about free trade, and [[copyright]]s and [[patent]]s to encourage innovation.<ref name=econlib>{{cite web |title=Adam Smith|publisher=econlib.org|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Smith.html}}</ref>

===Marxist political economy===
{{Main|Marxian economics}}
[[Karl Marx]] considered capitalism to be a historically specific [[mode of production]] (the way in which the productive property is owned and controlled, combined with the corresponding [[social relations of production|social relations]] between individuals based on their connection with the process of production) in which capitalism has become the dominant mode of production.<ref name="Burnham"/>

The capitalist stage of development or "[[bourgeois]] society," for Marx, represented the most advanced form of social organization to date, but he also thought that the working classes would come to power in a worldwide [[socialism|socialist]] or [[communism|communist]] transformation of human society as the end of the series of first aristocratic, then capitalist, and finally working class rule was reached.<ref>''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''</ref><ref>"To Marx, the problem of reconstituting society did not arise from some prescription, motivated by his personal predilections; it followed, as an iron-clad historical necessity – on the one hand, from the productive forces grown to powerful maturity; on the other, from the impossibility further to organize these forces according to the will of the [[law of value]]." – [[Leon Trotsky]], "Marxism in our Time", 1939 (Inevitability of Socialism), [http://wsws.org/articles/2008/nov2008/time-n01.shtml WSWS.org]</ref>
[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Karl Marx]]]]
Following [[Adam Smith]], Marx distinguished the [[use value]] of commodities from their [[exchange value]] in the market. Capital, according to Marx, is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases. For Marx, the use of [[labor power]] had itself become a commodity under capitalism; the exchange value of labor power, as reflected in the wage, is less than the value it produces for the capitalist.

This difference in values, he argues, constitutes [[surplus value]], which the capitalists extract and accumulate. In his book ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'', Marx argues that the [[capitalist mode of production]] is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers—all prior class societies had extracted [[surplus labor]], but capitalism was new in doing so via the sale-value of produced commodities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch47.htm|title=Capital. v. 3. Chapter 47: Genesis of capitalist ground rent|author=Karl Marx |accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=Marxists }}</ref> He argues that a core requirement of a capitalist society is that a large portion of the population must not possess sources of self-sustenance that would allow them to be independent, and must instead be compelled, to survive, to sell their labor for a living wage.<ref>Karl Marx. Chapter Twenty-Five: The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation. ''[[Das Kapital]]''.</ref><ref>Dobb, Maurice 1947  ''Studies in the Development of Capitalism.''  New York: International Publishers Co., Inc.</ref><ref>David Harvey 1989 ''The Condition of Postmodernity''</ref>

In conjunction with his criticism of capitalism was Marx's belief that the working class, due to its relationship to the means of production and numerical superiority under capitalism, would be the driving force behind the socialist revolution.<ref>Wheen, Francis ''Books That Shook the World: Marx's Das Kapital''1st ed. London: Atlantic Books, 2006</ref> This argument is intertwined with Marx's version of the [[labor theory of value]] arguing that labor is the source of all value, and thus of profit.

[[Vladimir Lenin]], in ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'' (1916), further developed Marxist theory and argued that capitalism necessarily led to [[monopoly capitalism]] and the export of capital—which he also called "imperialism"—to find new markets and resources, representing the last and highest stage of capitalism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/index.htm|title=Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|publisher=Marxists|accessdate=26 February 2008|year=1916}}</ref> Some 20th-century [[Marxian economics|Marxian economists]] consider capitalism to be a social formation where capitalist class processes dominate, but are not exclusive.<ref>See, for example, the works of Stephen Resnick and Richard Wolff.</ref>

Capitalist class processes, to these thinkers, are simply those in which [[surplus labor]] takes the form of [[surplus value]], usable as capital; other tendencies for utilization of labor nonetheless exist simultaneously in existing societies where capitalist processes are predominant. However, other late Marxian thinkers argue that a social formation as a whole may be classed as capitalist if capitalism is the mode by which a surplus is ''extracted'', even if this surplus is not ''produced'' by capitalist activity, as when an absolute majority of the population is engaged in non-capitalist economic activity.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ste. Croix, G. E. M. de|title=The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World|year=1982|pages=52–3}}</ref>

In ''Limits to Capital'' (1982), [[David Harvey]] outlines an overdetermined, "spatially restless" capitalism coupled with the spatiality of crisis formation and resolution. Harvey used Marx's theory of crisis to aid his argument that capitalism must have its "fixes" but that we cannot predetermine what fixes will be implemented, nor in what form they will be. His work on contractions of capital accumulation and international movements of capitalist modes of production and money flows has been influential.<ref name="Lawson, Victoria 2007">Lawson, Victoria.

===Weberian political sociology===
[[File:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|[[Max Weber]]]]
In [[social science]], the understanding of the defining characteristics of capitalism has been strongly influenced by the German sociologist, [[Max Weber]]. Weber considered [[market]] [[trade|exchange]], a voluntary supply of labor and a planned division of labor within the enterprises as defining features of capitalism. Capitalist enterprises, in contrast to their counterparts in prior modes of economic activity, were directed toward the rationalization of production, maximizing [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] and [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]] – a tendency embedded in a sociological process of enveloping [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] that formed modern legal bureaucracies in both [[state (polity)|public]] and [[corporation|private]] spheres.<ref name="ReferenceA">Bendix, Reinhard: ''Max Weber: An Intellectual Portrait''. Love & Brydone; London, 1959</ref> According to Weber, workers in pre-capitalist economies understood work in terms of a personal relationship between [[Master craftsman|master]] and [[journeyman]] in a [[guild]], or between [[lord]] and [[peasant]] in a [[Manorialism|manor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.humanities.mq.edu.au/Ockham/y64l10.html|title=Max Weber: On Capitalism |accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=Macquarie University|author=Kilcullen, John|year=1996}}</ref>

For these developments of capitalism to emerge, Weber argued, it was necessary the development of a "capitalist spirit"; that is, ideas and habits that favor a rational pursuit of economic gain. These ideas, in order to propagate a certain manner of life and come to dominate others, "had to originate somewhere&nbsp;... as a way of life common to whole groups of men".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In his book ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1904–1905), Weber sought to trace how a particular form of religious spirit, infused into traditional modes of economic activity, was a condition of possibility of modern western capitalism. For Weber, the 'spirit of capitalism' was, in general, that of ascetic Protestantism; this ideology was able to motivate extreme rationalization of daily life, a propensity to accumulate capital by a religious ethic to advance economically through hard and diligent work, and thus also the propensity to reinvest capital. This was sufficient, then, to create "self-mediating capital" as conceived by Marx.

This is pictured in the Protestant understanding of ''beruf'' <ref>Max Weber; Peter R. Baehr; Gordon C. Wells (2002). ''The Protestant ethic and the "spirit" of capitalism and other writings''. Penguin.</ref> – whose meaning encompass at the same time profession, vocation, and calling – as exemplified in Proverbs 22:29, "Seest thou a man diligent in his calling? He shall stand before kings". In the ''Protestant Ethic'', Weber describes the developments of this idea of calling from its religious roots, through the understanding of someone's economic success as a sign of his salvation, until the conception that moneymaking is, within the modern economic order, the result and the expression of diligence in one's calling.

Finally, as the social mores critical for its development became no longer necessary for its maintenance, modern western capitalism came to represent the order "now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which today determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force. Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt" (p.&nbsp;123).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economyandsociety.com/events/Ethic&SpiritCapsm_Conf_Agenda2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Conference Agenda|publisher=Economy and Society|accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref>  This is further seen in his criticism of "specialists without spirit, [[Hedonism|hedonists]] without a heart" that were developing, in his opinion, with the fading of the original [[Puritan]] "spirit" associated with capitalism.

===Institutional economics===
{{Main|Institutional economics}}

[[File:Veblen3a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thorstein Veblen]]]]

Institutional economics, once the main school of economic thought in the United States, holds that capitalism cannot be separated from the political and social system within which it is embedded. It emphasizes the legal foundations of capitalism (see [[John R. Commons]]) and the evolutionary, habituated, and volitional processes by which institutions are erected and then changed.

One key figure in institutional economics was [[Thorstein Veblen]] who in his book, [[The Theory of the Leisure Class]] (1899), analyzed the motivations of wealthy people in capitalism who [[Conspicuous consumption|conspicuously consumed]] their riches as a way of demonstrating success. The concept of [[conspicuous consumption]] was in direct contradiction to the neoclassical view that capitalism was efficient.

In [[The Theory of Business Enterprise]] (1904) Veblen distinguished the motivations of industrial production for people to use things from business motivations that used, or misused, industrial infrastructure for profit, arguing that the former often is hindered because businesses pursue the latter. Output and technological advance are restricted by business practices and the creation of monopolies. Businesses protect their existing capital investments and employ excessive credit, leading to depressions and increasing military expenditure and war through business control of political power.

===German Historical School and Austrian School===
{{Main|Historical school of economics|Austrian School}}
From the perspective of the [[Historical school of economics|German Historical School]], capitalism is primarily identified in terms of the organization of production for [[market]]s. Although this perspective shares similar theoretical roots with that of Weber, its emphasis on markets and money lends it different focus.<ref name="Burnham"/> For followers of the German Historical School, the key shift from traditional modes of economic activity to capitalism involved the shift from medieval restrictions on credit and money to the modern [[monetary system|monetary economy]] combined with an emphasis on the profit motive.

[[File:Ludwig von Mises.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ludwig von Mises]]]]

In the late 19th century, the German Historical School of economics diverged, with the emerging [[Austrian School]] of economics, led at the time by [[Carl Menger]]. Later generations of followers of the Austrian School continued to be influential in Western economic thought in the early part of the 20th century.

Austrian-born economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]], sometimes associated with the School,<ref>David Simpson, (1983) "Joseph Schumpeter and the Austrian School of Economics", ''Journal of Economic Studies'', Vol. 10 Iss: 4, pp. 18–28</ref> emphasized the "[[creative destruction]]" of capitalism—the fact that market economies undergo constant change. Schumpeter argued that at any moment in time there are rising industries and declining industries. Schumpeter, and many contemporary economists influenced by his work, argue that resources should flow from the declining to the expanding industries for an economy to grow, but they recognized that sometimes resources are slow to withdraw from the declining industries because of various forms of institutional resistance to change.

The Austrian economists [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were among the leading defenders of [[market economy]] against 20th century proponents of socialist [[planned economies]]. Mises and Hayek argued that only market capitalism could manage a complex, modern economy.

Since a modern economy produces such a large array of distinct goods and services, and consists of such a large array of consumers and enterprises, argued Mises and Hayek, the information problems facing any other form of economic organization other than market capitalism would exceed its capacity to handle information. Thinkers within [[Supply-side economics]] built on the work of the Austrian School, and particularly emphasize [[Say's Law]]: "supply creates its own demand." Capitalism, to this school, is defined by lack of state restraint on the decisions of producers.

===Keynesian economics===
{{Main|Keynesian economics}}

[[File:John Maynard Keynes.jpg|thumb|[[John Maynard Keynes]]]]

In his 1937 ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', the British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] argued that capitalism suffered a basic problem in its ability to recover from periods of slowdowns in investment. Keynes argued that a capitalist economy could remain in an indefinite [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] despite high [[unemployment]].

Essentially rejecting [[Say's law]], he argued that some people may have a [[liquidity preference]] that would see them rather hold money than buy new goods or services, which therefore raised the prospect that the [[Great Depression]] would not end without what he termed in the ''General Theory'' "a somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment."

Keynesian economics challenged the notion that ''laissez-faire'' capitalist economics could operate well on their own, without state intervention used to promote [[aggregate demand]], fighting high unemployment and [[Deflation (economics)|deflation]] of the sort seen during the 1930s. He and his followers recommended "[[Deficit spending|pump-priming]]" the economy to avoid [[recession]]: cutting taxes, increasing government borrowing, and spending during an economic down-turn. This was to be accompanied by trying to control wages nationally partly through the use of [[inflation]] to cut real wages and to deter people from holding money.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/mattick-paul/1969/marx-keynes/ch01.htm |title=Marx and Keynes: the limits of the mixed economy |author=Paul Mattick |accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=Marxists }}</ref>

John Maynard Keynes tried to provide solutions to many of Marx's problems without completely abandoning the classical understanding of capitalism. His work attempted to show that regulation can be effective, and that economic stabilizers can rein in the aggressive expansions and recessions that Marx disliked. These changes sought to create more stability in the business cycle, and reduce the abuses of laborers. Keynesian economists argue that Keynesian policies were one of the primary reasons capitalism was able to recover following the Great Depression.<ref>Erhardt III, Erwin. "History of Economic Development." University of Cincinnati. Lindner Center Auditorium, Cincinnati. 7 November 2008.</ref> The premises of Keynes's work have, however, since been challenged by neoclassical and [[supply-side economics]] and the Austrian School.

Another challenge to Keynesian thinking came from his colleague [[Piero Sraffa]], and subsequently from the [[Neo-Ricardianism|Neo-Ricardian school]] that followed Sraffa. In Sraffa's highly technical analysis, capitalism is defined by an entire system of social relations among both producers and consumers, but with a primary emphasis on the demands of production. According to Sraffa, the tendency of capital to seek its highest [[rate of profit]] causes a dynamic instability in social and economic relations.

===Neoclassical economics and the Chicago School===
{{Main|Neoclassical economics}}
Today, the majority of academic research on capitalism in the [[English-speaking world]] draws on [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic thought]]. It favors extensive market coordination and relatively neutral patterns of governmental market regulation aimed at maintaining property rights; deregulated [[labor market]]s; corporate governance dominated by financial owners of firms; and financial systems depending chiefly on [[capital market]]-based financing rather than state financing.

[[File:Portrait of Milton Friedman.jpg|thumb|left|[[Milton Friedman]]]]

[[Milton Friedman]] took many of the basic principles set forth by Adam Smith and the classical economists and gave them a new twist. One example of this is his article in the September 1970 issue of ''The New York Times'' Magazine, where he argues that the social responsibility of business is "to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits&nbsp;... (through) open and free competition without deception or fraud." This is similar to Smith's argument that self-interest in turn benefits the whole of society.<ref>Friedman, Milton. "The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits." ''The New York Times Magazine'' 13 September 1970.</ref> Work like this helped lay the foundations for the coming [[marketization]] (or [[privatization]]) of state enterprises and the [[supply-side economics]] of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].

The [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School of economics]] is best known for its free market advocacy and [[monetarist]] ideas. According to Friedman and other monetarists, market economies are inherently stable if left to themselves and depressions result only from government intervention.<ref>{{cite book |title=Macroeconomics and New Macroeconomics|author=Felderer, Bernhard}}</ref>

Friedman, for example, argued that the [[Great Depression]] was result of a contraction of the money supply, controlled by the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]], and not by the lack of investment as [[John Maynard Keynes]] had argued. [[Ben Bernanke]], current Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]], is among the economists today generally accepting Friedman's analysis of the causes of the Great Depression.<ref name="fed">{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/default.htm|title=Remarks by Governor Ben S.

Neoclassical economists, who by 1998 constituted a majority of academic economists,<ref>{{cite book |author=Yonary, Yuval P.|title=The Struggle Over the Soul of Economics|year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-03419-2|page=29}}</ref> subscribe to a subjective theory of value, according to which the value derived from consumption of a good, rather than being objective and static, varies widely from person to person and for the same person at different times. Adherence to a subjective theory of value compels Neoclassical thinkers to reject the [[labor theory of value]] [[theory of value,|,]] upheld by Adam Smith and other classical liberal thinkers, which was grounded upon a conception of objective value.

Neoclassical models typically adopt the assumptions of [[Marginalism]], <nowiki/>according to which economic value results from marginal utility and  [[marginal cost]] (the [[marginal concepts]]). Marginalist theory implies that capitalists earn profits not by exploiting workers, but by forgoing current consumption, taking risks, and organizing production.

==Neoclassical economic theory==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2010}}
Neoclassical economics explain capitalism as made up of individuals, enterprises, markets and government. According to their theories, individuals engage in a capitalist economy as [[consumer]]s, [[laborer]]s, and [[investor]]s. As laborers, individuals may decide which jobs to prepare for, and in which markets to look for work. As investors they decide how much of their income to save and how to invest their savings. These savings, which become investments, provide much of the money that businesses need to grow.

Business firms decide what to produce and where this production should occur. They also purchase inputs (materials, labor, and capital). Businesses try to influence consumer purchase decisions through marketing and advertisement, as well as the creation of new and improved products.
Driving the capitalist economy is the search for profits (revenues minus expenses). This is known as the [[profit motive]], and it helps ensure that companies produce the goods and services that consumers desire and are able to buy. To be profitable, firms must sell a quantity of their product at a certain price to yield a profit. A business may lose money if sales fall too low or if its costs become too high. The profit motive encourages firms to operate more efficiently. By using less materials, labor or capital, a firm can cut its production costs, which can lead to increased profits.

An economy grows when the total value of goods and services produced rises. This growth requires investment in infrastructure, capital and other resources necessary in production. In a capitalist system, businesses decide when and how much they want to invest.

Income in a capitalist economy depends primarily on what skills are in demand and what skills are being supplied. Skills that are in scarce supply are worth more in the market and can attract higher incomes. Competition among workers for jobs — and among employers for skilled workers — help determine wage rates. Firms need to pay high enough wages to attract the appropriate workers; when jobs are scarce, workers may accept lower wages than they would when jobs are plentiful. [[Trade union]] and governments influence wages in capitalist systems. Unions act to represent their members in negotiations with employers over such things as wage rates and acceptable working conditions.

===The market===
[[File:Supply-and-demand.svg|thumb|right|240px|The price (P) of a product is determined by a balance between production at each price (supply, S) and the desires of those with [[purchasing power]] at each price (demand, D). This results in a market equilibrium, with a given quantity (Q) sold of the product. A rise in demand would result in an increase in price and an increase in output.]]

Supply is the amount of a good or service produced by a firm and which is available for sale. Demand is the amount that people are willing to buy at a specific price. Prices tend to rise when demand exceeds supply, and fall when supply exceeds demand. In theory, the market is able to coordinate itself when a new equilibrium price and quantity is reached.

Competition arises when more than one producer is trying to sell the same or similar products to the same buyers. In capitalist theory, competition leads to innovation and more affordable prices. Without competition, a monopoly or [[cartel]] may develop. A monopoly occurs when a firm supplies the total output in the market; the firm can therefore limit output and raise prices because it has no fear of competition. A cartel is a group of firms that act together in a monopolistic manner to control output and raise prices.

===Role of government===
{{Further|Competition regulator|Consumer protection|Competition law}}
In a capitalist system, the government does not prohibit private property or prevent individuals from working where they please. The government does not prevent firms from determining what wages they will pay and what prices they will charge for their products. Many countries, however, have [[minimum wage]] laws and minimum safety standards.

Under some versions of capitalism, the government carries out a number of economic functions, such as issuing money, supervising public utilities and enforcing private contracts. Many countries have [[competition law]]s that prohibit monopolies and cartels from forming. Despite anti-monopoly laws, large corporations can form near-monopolies in some industries. Such firms can temporarily drop prices and accept losses to prevent competition from entering the market, and then raise them again once the threat of entry is reduced. In many countries, public utilities (e.g. electricity, heating fuel, communications) are able to operate as a monopoly under government regulation, due to high economies of scale.

Government agencies regulate the standards of service in many industries, such as airlines and broadcasting, as well as financing a wide range of programs. In addition, the government regulates the flow of capital and uses financial tools such as the interest rate to control factors such as inflation and unemployment.<ref>"Capitalism." World Book Encyclopedia. 1988. p. 194.</ref>

==Democracy, the state, and legal frameworks==
{{Main|History of capitalist theory}}

===Private property===
The relationship between the [[state (polity)|state]], its formal mechanisms, and capitalist societies has been debated in many fields of social and political theory, with active discussion since the 19th century. [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] is a contemporary economist who has argued that an important characteristic of capitalism is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system where ownership and transactions are clearly recorded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/03/desoto.htm |title=The mystery of capital|author=Hernando de Soto|accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref>

According to de Soto, this is the process by which physical assets are transformed into capital, which in turn may be used in many more ways and much more efficiently in the market economy. A number of Marxian economists have argued that the [[Enclosure Acts]] in England, and similar legislation elsewhere, were an integral part of capitalist [[primitive accumulation]] and that specific legal frameworks of private land ownership have been integral to the development of capitalism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch27.htm |title=Capital, v. 1. Part VIII: primitive accumulation|author=Karl Marx|accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=N. F. R. Crafts |title=Enclosure and labor supply revisited |journal=Explorations in economic history |issue=15 |month=April |year=1978 |pages=172–183 |doi=10.1016/0014-4983(78)90019-0 |volume=15}}</ref>

===Institutions===
[[New institutional economics]], a field pioneered by [[Douglass North]], stresses the need of a legal framework in order for capitalism to function optimally, and focuses on the relationship between the historical development of capitalism and the creation and maintenance of political and economic institutions.<ref>{{cite book |author=North, Douglass C.|title=Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990}}</ref> In new institutional economics and other fields focusing on public policy, economists seek to judge when and whether governmental intervention (such as [[tax]]es, [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], and [[Regulatory economics|government regulation]]) can result in potential gains in efficiency. According to [[Gregory Mankiw]], a [[New Keynesian economics|New Keynesian economist]], governmental intervention can improve on market outcomes under conditions of "[[market failure]]", or situations in which the market on its own does not allocate resources efficiently.<ref>{{cite book |title=Principles of Economics|publisher=Harvard University|year=1997|page=10|author=Mankiw, Gregory |isbn=0-03-024719-5}}</ref>

Market failure occurs when an [[externality]] is present and a market will either under-produce a product with a positive externalization or overproduce a product that generates a negative externalization. Air pollution, for instance, is a negative externalization that cannot be incorporated into markets as the world's air is not owned and then sold for use to polluters. So, too much pollution could be emitted and people not involved in the production pay the cost of the pollution instead of the firm that initially emitted the air pollution. Critics of market failure theory, like [[Ronald Coase]], [[Harold Demsetz]], and [[James M. Buchanan]] argue that government programs and policies also fall short of absolute perfection. Market failures are often small, and government failures are sometimes large. It is therefore the case that imperfect markets are often better than imperfect governmental alternatives. While all nations currently have some kind of market regulations, the desirable degree of regulation is disputed.

===Democracy===
The relationship between [[democracy]] and capitalism is a contentious area in theory and popular political movements. The extension of universal adult male [[suffrage]] in 19th century Britain occurred along with the development of industrial capitalism, and democracy became widespread at the same time as capitalism, leading many theorists to posit a causal relationship between them, or that each affects the other. However, in the 20th century, according to some authors, capitalism also accompanied a variety of political formations quite distinct from liberal democracies, including [[fascism|fascist]] regimes, absolute monarchies, and single-party states.<ref name="Burnham" />

While some thinkers argue that capitalist development more-or-less inevitably eventually leads to the emergence of democracy, others dispute this claim. Research on the [[democratic peace theory]] indicates that capitalist democracies rarely make war with one another<ref>For the influence of capitalism on peace, see Mousseau, M. (2009) "The Social Market Roots of Democratic Peace", ''International Security'' 33 (4)</ref> and have little internal violence. However, critics of the democratic peace theory note that democratic capitalist states may fight infrequently and or never with other democratic capitalist states because of political similarity or stability rather than because they are democratic or capitalist.

Some commentators argue that though economic growth under capitalism has led to democratization in the past, it may not do so in the future, as [[authoritarian]] regimes have been able to manage economic growth without making concessions to greater political freedom.<ref>{{cite web |author=Mesquita, Bruce Bueno de|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20050901faessay84507/bruce-bueno-de-mesquita-george-w-downs/development-and-democracy.html|title=Development and Democracy|date=2005-09|accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=Foreign Affairs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Single, Joseph T.|url=http://www10.nytimes.com/cfr/international/20040901facomment_v83n4_siegle-weinstein-halperin.html?_r=5&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin|title=Why Democracies Excel|date=2004-09|accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=[[New York Times]]}}</ref>
States that have highly capitalistic economic systems have thrived under authoritarian or oppressive political systems. Singapore, which maintains a highly open market economy and attracts lots of foreign investment, does not protect civil liberties such as freedom of speech and expression. The private (capitalist) sector in the People's Republic of China has grown exponentially and thrived since its inception, despite having an authoritarian government.  [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s rule in Chile led to economic growth by using authoritarian means to create a safe environment for investment and capitalism.

In response to criticism of the system, some proponents of capitalism have argued that its advantages are supported by empirical research. [[Indices of Economic Freedom]] show a correlation between nations with more economic freedom (as defined by the indices) and higher scores on variables such as income and life expectancy, including the poor, in these nations.

==Advocacy for capitalism== 
===Economic growth===
[[File:Gdp chart.png|thumb|World's [[GDP]] per capita shows exponential growth since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.<ref>{{cite book |title=The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective |author=Angus Maddison |publisher=[[OECD]] |location=Paris |year=2001 |isbn=92-64-18998-X}}</ref>]]
[[File:Prc1952-2005gdp.gif|thumb|Capitalism and the economy of the People's Republic of China]]

Many theorists and policymakers in predominantly capitalist nations have emphasized capitalism's ability to promote economic growth, as measured by [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), [[capacity utilization]] or [[standard of living]]. This argument was central, for example, to Adam Smith's advocacy of letting a free market control production and price, and allocate resources. Many theorists have noted that this increase in global GDP over time coincides with the emergence of the modern world capitalist system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/04-05/essay.cfm |title=The Industrial Revolution: Past and Future |author=Robert E. Lucas Jr. |work=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 2003 Annual Report |accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/TCEH/1998_Draft/World_GDP/Estimating_World_GDP.html |title=Estimating World GDP, One Million B.C. – Present |author=J. Bradford DeLong |accessdate=26 February 2008 }}</ref>

Between 1000 and 1820, the world economy grew sixfold, a faster rate than the population growth, so each individual enjoyed, on the average, a 50% increase in wealth. Between 1820 and 1998, world economy grew 50-fold, a much faster rate than the population growth, so each individual enjoyed, on the average, a 9-fold increase in wealth.<ref name=wolf44/> In most capitalist economic regions such as Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the economy grew 19-fold per person, even though these countries already had a higher starting level, and in Japan, which was poor in 1820, the increase per person was 31-fold.  In the [[third world]] there was an increase, but only 5-fold per person.<ref name=wolf44>[[Martin Wolf]], ''[[Why Globalization works]]'', p.&nbsp;43–45</ref>

Proponents argue that increasing GDP (per capita) is empirically shown to bring about improved standards of living, such as better availability of food, housing, clothing, and health care.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html |title=Industrial Revolution and the Standard of Living |first=Clark |last=Nardinelli |accessdate=26 February 2008 }}</ref> The decrease in the number of hours worked per week and the decreased participation of children and the elderly in the workforce have been attributed to capitalism.<ref>{{cite book |author=Barro, Robert J.|title=Macroeconomics|publisher=MIT Press|year=1997|isbn=0-262-02436-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mises.org/article.aspx?Id=1481|title=Morality and Economic Law: Toward a Reconciliation|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|accessdate=26 February 2008|author=Woods, Thomas E.|date=5 April 2004}}</ref>

Proponents also believe that a capitalist economy offers far more opportunities for individuals to raise their income through new professions or business ventures than do other economic forms. To their thinking, this potential is much greater than in either traditional [[feudal]] or [[tribal]] societies or in socialist societies.

===Political freedom===
In his book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', [[Freidrich Hayek]] asserts that the [[economic freedom]] of capitalism is a requisite of [[political freedom]]. He argues that the market mechanism is the only way of deciding what to produce and how to distribute the items without using coercion. [[Milton Friedman]], [[Andrew Brennan]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] also promoted this view. Friedman claimed that centralized economic operations are always accompanied by [[political repression]]. In his view, transactions in a market economy are voluntary, and that the wide diversity that voluntary activity permits is a fundamental threat to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish their power to coerce. Some of Friedman's views were shared by [[John Maynard Keynes]], who believed that capitalism is vital for freedom to survive and thrive.<ref>{{cite book |author=Friedrich Hayek|title=The Road to Serfdom|publisher=[[University Of Chicago Press]] |year=1944|isbn=0-226-32061-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Bellamy, Richard|title=The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-521-56354-2|page=60}}</ref>

However the dire predictions in ''The Road to Serfdom'' have not come to pass, even though some measure of government intervention in the economy is universal.  According to neoconservative thinker Adam Wolfson, "...most modern democracies have lived with more extensive welfare states and highly socialized economics than the United States, without somehow reaching a 'tipping point' whereupon they tumble into totalitarianism.  There is in fact no road to serfdom through the welfare state."<ref>Adam Wolfson, ''Cionservatives and Neoconservatives,'' ub Urwub /stekzerm ed,m ''The Neocon Reader'', p224.  Grove Press, 2004.</ref>

The novelist [[Ayn Rand]] attempted a positive moral defense of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism, most notably in her 1957 novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. She insisted that capitalism should be supported on moral grounds, not just on the basis of practical benefits.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jennifer |last=Burns |chapter=Godless Capitalism: Ayn Rand and the Conservative Movement |title=American Capitalism: Social Thought and Political Economy in the Twentieth Century |editor-first=Nelson (ed.) |editor-last=Lichtenstein |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8122-3923-2 |pages=282–283}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Douglas |last1=Den Uyl |last2=Rasmussen |first2=Douglas |chapter=Capitalism |title=[[The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand]] |editor1-last=Den Uyl |editor1-first=Douglas |editor2-last=Rasmussen |editor2-first=Douglas (eds.) |authorlink2=Douglas B.

===Self-organization===
Austrian School economists have argued that capitalism can organize itself into a complex system without an external guidance or central planning mechanism. Friedrich Hayek considered the phenomenon of [[self-organization]] as underpinning capitalism. Prices serve as a signal as to the urgent and unfilled wants of people, and the opportunity to earn profits if successful, or absorb losses if resources are used poorly or left idle, gives entrepreneurs [[incentive]] to use their [[Dispersed knowledge|knowledge]] and resources to satisfy those wants. Thus the activities of millions of people, each seeking his own interest, are coordinated.<ref name=walberg2003>

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of capitalism}}
[[File:Anti-capitalism color.jpg|right|thumb|An [[Industrial Workers of the World]] poster (1911)]]
Critics of capitalism associate it with [[social inequality]] and unfair [[distribution of wealth]] and power; a tendency toward market monopoly or [[oligopoly]] (and government by [[oligarchy]]); [[imperialism]], [[counter-revolutionary]] wars and various forms of economic and cultural [[exploitation]]; [[Economic materialism|materialism]]; repression of workers and [[trade union]]ists; [[social alienation]]; [[economic inequality]]; [[unemployment]]; and economic instability. Individual property rights have also been associated with the [[tragedy of the anticommons]].

Notable critics of capitalism have included: [[socialism|socialists]], [[anarchism|anarchists]], [[communism|communists]], [[Nazism|national socialists]], [[Social democracy|social democrats]], [[Technocracy|technocrats]], some types of [[conservatism|conservatives]], [[Luddite]]s, [[Narodnik]]s, [[Shakers]], and some types of [[nationalism|nationalists]].

[[Marxism|Marxists]] have advocated a revolutionary overthrow of capitalism that would lead to socialism, before eventually transforming into communism. Many socialists consider capitalism to be irrational, in that production and the direction of the economy are unplanned, creating many inconsistencies and internal contradictions.<ref>Brander, James A. ''Government policy toward business''. 4th ed. Mississauga, Ontario: John Wiley & Sons Canada, Ltd., 2006. Print.</ref> [[Labor history (discipline)|Labor historians]] and scholars such as [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] have argued that [[unfree labor]] — by [[Slavery|slaves]], [[indentured servant]]s, prisoners, and other coerced persons — is compatible with capitalist relations.<ref>That unfree labor is acceptable to capital was argued during the 1980s by [[Tom Brass]]. See ''Towards a Comparative Political Economy of Unfree Labor'' (Cass, 1999). {{cite journal |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/llt/52/linden.html |title=Labour History as the History of Multitudes|journal=Labour/Le Travail|volume=52|date=Fall 2003|pages=235–244 |author=Marcel van der Linden |accessdate=26 February 2008|doi=10.2307/25149390|jstor=25149390}}</ref>

Many aspects of capitalism have come under attack from the [[anti-globalization movement]], which is primarily opposed to [[corporate capitalism]]. [[environmentalism|Environmentalists]] have argued that capitalism requires continual economic growth, and that it will inevitably deplete the finite natural resources of the Earth.<ref>{{cite book |last = McMurty |first = John |title = The Cancer Stage of Capitalism |publisher = [[PLUTO PRESS]] |year = 1999 |isbn = 0-7453-1347-7}}</ref>

Many religions have criticized or opposed specific elements of capitalism. Traditional [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and Islam forbid [[Usury|lending money at interest]],<ref>''[[Baba Metzia]]'' 61b</ref><ref>Moehlman, 1934, p.&nbsp;6–7.</ref> although alternative methods of banking have been developed. Some Christians have criticized capitalism for its [[Economic materialism|materialist]] aspects<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P8C.HTM#-2FX|title=III. The Social Doctrine of the Church|publisher=The Vatican|accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref> and its inability to account for the wellbeing of all people. Many of Jesus's parables deal with clearly economic concerns: farming, shepherding, being in debt, doing hard labor, being excluded from banquets and the houses of the rich, and have implications for wealth and power distribution.<ref>{{cite news |last=[[Ross Gittins]]|title=What Jesus said about capitalism|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/what-jesus-said-about-capitalism-20120408-1wjmm.html|accessdate=28 April 2012|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=9 April 2012}}</ref><ref>Thomas Gubleton, archbishop of Detroit speaking in "Capitalism: A love story"{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}</ref>

In his 84-page [[apostolic exhortation]] ''[[Evangelii Gaudium]],'' [[Pope Francis]] described unfettered capitalism as "a new tyranny" and called upon world leaders to fight rising poverty and inequality.<ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/26/pope-francis-capitalism-tyranny Pope Francis calls unfettered capitalism 'tyranny' and urges rich to share wealth]. ''[[The Guardian]],'' 26 November 2013.</ref> In it he says:

Following the banking crisis of 2007, even those who strongly held the view that capitalism can organize itself were forced to reconsider. [[Alan Greenspan]] told the United States Congress on October 23, 2008, "The whole intellectual edifice collapsed. I made a mistake in presuming that the self-interests of organizations, specifically banks and others, were such that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders. ... I was shocked."<ref>New York Times, Oct. 23, 2007.</ref>
