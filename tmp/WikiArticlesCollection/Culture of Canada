Canada's [[Government of Canada|federal government]] has influenced Canadian culture with programs, laws and institutions. It has created crown corporations to promote Canadian culture through media, such as the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) and the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB), and promotes many events which it considers to promote Canadian traditions. It has also tried to [[Canadian cultural protectionism|protect Canadian culture]] by setting legal minimums on [[Canadian content]] in many media using bodies like the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC).<ref>{{cite web |author=National Film Board of Canada |authorlink=National Film Board of Canada|url=http://www.nfb.ca/atonf/organisation.php?v=h&lg=en |title=Mandate of the National Film Board |year=2005|accessdate=March 15, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060421170854/http://www.nfb.ca/atonf/organisation.php?v=h&lg=en |archivedate = April 21, 2006}}</ref>

===Identity===
{{Main|Canadian identity}}
[[File:Stenciled identity.jpg|right|thumb|The [[maple leaf]] is the symbol most associated with [[Canadian identity]].]]

Canada's large geographic size, the presence of a significant number of indigenous peoples, the conquest of one European linguistic population by another and relatively open [[immigration policy]] have led to an extremely [[ethnic groups in Canada|diverse society]]. As a result the issue of Canadian identity remains under scrutiny, perhaps more than the identity of the people of any other modern nation.<ref>MacGregor, p.39</ref> Journalist and professor [[Andrew Cohen (journalist)|Andrew Cohen]] wrote in 2007:
{{Quote|The Canadian Identity, as it has come to be known, is as elusive as the [[Bigfoot|Sasquatch]] and [[Ogopogo]].

The question of Canadian identity was traditionally dominated by three fundamental themes: first, the often conflicted relations between English Canadians and French Canadians stemming from the French Canadian imperative for cultural and linguistic survival; secondly, the generally close ties between English Canadians and the [[British Empire]], resulting in a gradual political process towards complete independence from the imperial power; and finally, the close proximity of English-speaking Canadians to the military, economic and cultural powerhouse of the United States.<ref name="Marger2011">{{cite book|author=Martin N.

In general, Canadian nationalists are highly concerned about the protection of Canadian sovereignty and loyalty to the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian State]], placing them in the [[Liberal nationalism|civic nationalist]] category.

===Literature===
[[File:Davies.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Canadian writer [[Robertson Davies]], author of [[The Deptford Trilogy]] which included the famous book, ''[[Fifth Business]]''.]]
{{Main|Canadian literature}}
[[Canadian literature]] is often divided into French- and English-language literature, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively.<ref name="Keith2006">{{cite book|author=W. J. Keith|title=Canadian literature in English|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rGawhTGpGK0C&pg=PA19|year= 2006|publisher=The Porcupine's Quill|isbn=978-0-88984-283-0|page=19}}</ref> Canada’s early literature, whether written in English or French, often reflects the Canadian perspective on nature, frontier life, and Canada’s position in the world, for example the poetry of [[Bliss Carman]] or the memoirs of [[Susanna Moodie]] and [[Catherine Parr Traill]]. These themes, and Canada's literary history, inform the writing of successive generations of Canadian authors, from [[Leonard Cohen]] to [[Margaret Atwood]].

By the mid-20th century, Canadian writers were exploring national themes for Canadian readers. Authors were trying to find a distinctly Canadian voice, rather than merely emulating British or American writers. Canadian identity is closely tied to its literature. The question of national identity recurs as a theme in much of Canada's literature, from [[Hugh MacLennan]]'s ''[[Two Solitudes (novel)|Two Solitudes]]'' (1945) to [[Alistair MacLeod]]'s ''[[No Great Mischief]]'' (1999). Canadian literature is often categorised by [[List of regions of Canada|region or province]]; by the socio-cultural origins of the author (for example, [[Acadians]], Aboriginal peoples, LGBT, and [[Irish Canadian]]s); and by literary period, such as "Canadian postmoderns" or "Canadian Poets Between the Wars."

[[Sports in Canada]] consists of a variety of games. Although there are many contests that Canadians value, the most common are [[Ice hockey]], [[Lacrosse]], [[Canadian football]], basketball, soccer, [[curling]], baseball and [[ringette]].  All but curling and soccer are considered domestic sports as they were either invented by Canadians or trace their roots to Canada.<ref name="MorrowWamsley2013">{{cite book|author1=Don Morrow|author2=Kevin B.

[[Canadian cuisine]] varies widely depending on the regions of the nation. The former Canadian prime minister [[Joe Clark]] has been paraphrased to have noted: "Canada has a cuisine of cuisines.

The three earliest cuisines of Canada have [[First Nations]], English, and French roots, with the traditional cuisine of [[English Canada]] closely related to [[British cuisine|British]] and [[Cuisine of the United States|American cuisine]], while the traditional cuisine of [[French Canada]] has evolved from [[French cuisine]] and the winter provisions of [[Coureur des bois|fur traders]].<ref name="Civitello2011">{{cite book|author=Linda Civitello|title=Cuisine and Culture: A History of Food and People|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CwRE0HIIyWkC&pg=PA401|year= 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-40371-6|pages=401–402}}</ref> With subsequent waves of immigration in the 18th and 19th century from [[Central Europe|Central]], [[Southern Europe|Southern]], and Eastern Europe, and then from Asia, Africa and [[Caribbean]], the regional cuisines were subsequently augmented.<ref name="Civitello2011"/> The [[Jewish Canadian|Jewish immigrants]] to Canada during the late 1800s also play a significant role to foods in Canada.
