The '''economy of [[Cuba]]''' is a largely centrally [[planned economy]] dominated by state-run enterprises overseen by the Cuban government, though there remains significant foreign investment and private enterprise in Cuba. Most of the [[means of production]] are owned and run by the government, and most of the labor force is employed by the state, although in recent years, the formation of [[Worker Cooperative|cooperatives]] and self-employment has been encouraged by the Communist Party.

In the year 2000, public sector employment was 76% and private sector employment was 23% compared to the 1981 ratio of 91% to 8%.<ref>[http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/research_reports/art3670.html/pdfs/social_policy.pdf Social Policy at the Crossroads] Oxfam America Report</ref> Capital investment is restricted and requires approval by the government. The Cuban government sets most prices and rations goods to citizens. In 2009, Cuba ranked 51st out of 182 with an [[Human Development Index|HDI]] of 0.863; remarkably high considering its GDP per capita only places it 95th.<ref>[http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/country_fact_sheets/cty_fs_CUB.html] UNDP 2009</ref> Public services and transport in Cuba however are regarded to be second-rate compared with its more developed counterparts on the mainland.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21550421|accessdate=28 March 2012|title=Inequality: The deal’s off |work=[[The Economist]]|date=March 24, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
Prior to the [[Cuban Revolution]], Cuba had a one-crop economy whose domestic market was constricted. Its population was characterized by chronic unemployment and deep poverty.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} United States monopolies like [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]] and [[Speyer]] gained control over Cuba's national resources, from which they made huge profits.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} The banks and the country's entire financial system, all electric power production, and most industry was dominated by US capital.{{Dubious|date=August 2013}} US monopolies owned 25 percent of the best land in Cuba, and more than 80 percent of all farm lands were occupied by sugar and livestock-raising latifundia.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} 90 percent of the country's raw sugar and tobacco exports was sent to the USA. Before the Revolution, most Cuban children were not included in the school system. There was almost no machine-building industry in Cuba.<ref>{{Ru icon}} {{cite web | url=http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%9A%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B0%20(%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE)/ | title=Cuba (State) | publisher=Slovari.yandex.ru | accessdate=July 16, 2012}}</ref> During this period in the 1950s, Cuba was as rich per capita as Italy was, and richer than Japan{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.

87 percent of urban homes had electricity, but only 10 percent of rural homes did. Only 15 percent of rural homes had running water. Nearly half the rural population was illiterate, as was about 25 percent of the total population. Poverty and unemployment in the rural areas forced desperate residents to migrate to Havana, where there was high levels of crime and prostitution.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=3BDH9FK6grMC&pg=PA170&dq=Cuba+poverty+batista&ei=CcbrSq0iipCVBMypragM#v=onepage&q=Cuba%20poverty%20batista&f=false Bacardi and the long fight for Cuba: the biography of a cause By Tom Gjelten]</ref> More than 40 percent of the Cuban workforce in 1958 was either underemployed or unemployed. Schools for blacks and mulattoes were vastly inferior to those for whites. Afro-Cubans had the worst living conditions and held the lowest paid jobs.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=LjKoLe9jWKoC&pg=PA8&dq=Batista+cuba+unemployment+rate&lr=&ei=jcfrStDIIJqIlQSj66T9Cw#v=onepage&q=Batista%20cuba%20unemployment%20rate&f=false A contemporary Cuba reader: reinventing the Revolution By Philip Brenner]</ref>

===Cuban Revolution===
During the Revolutionary period, Cuba was one of the few developing countries to provide foreign aid. Foreign aid began with the construction of six hospitals in Peru in the early 1970s.<ref name="Monitor2">[http://multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1989/04/eckstein.html Cuba Today<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Foreign aid expanded later in the 1970s to the point where some 8000 Cubans worked in overseas assignments. Cubans built housing, roads, airports, schools, and other facilities in [[Angola]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Laos]], [[Guinea]], [[Tanzania]], and other countries. By the end of 1985, 35,000 Cuban workers had helped build projects in some 20 Asian, African and Latin American countries.<ref name="Monitor2"/>

For [[Nicaragua]] in 1982, Cuba pledged to provide over $130 million worth of agricultural and machinery equipment, as well as some 4000 technicians, doctors, and teachers.<ref name="Monitor2"/>

In 1986 Cuba defaulted on its $10.9 billion debt to the [[Paris Club]]. In 1987, Cuba stopped paying entirely on the $10.9 billion Paris Club debts.<ref>http://news.investors.com/123008-455491-communist-cuba-50-years-of-failure.htm?p=2 Communist Cuba: 50 Years Of Failure</ref> In 2002 Cuba defaulted on $750 million in Japanese debts.<ref>http://news.investors.com/123008-455491-communist-cuba-50-years-of-failure.htm?p=3 Communist Cuba: 50 Years Of Failure</ref>

Some have attributed Cuban economic growth{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} to Soviet subsidies. However, comparative economic data from 1989 showed that the amount of Soviet aid was in line with the amount of Western aid to many Latin American countries.<ref>"Soviet aid to Cuba in per capita terms or as a share of national income is in line with the amount of Western aid to many Latin American countries." http://multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1989/04/zimbalist.html</ref>

The prostitution of children with lax penalization and human trafficking for profit is reported in Cuba, as a source country for the global black market industry.
<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cu.html</ref>  Cuba has been ranked in the lowest global rating of Tier 3, which is defined for a government's failure to meet minimum standards to prevent trafficking and are not making significant efforts to do so.<ref>http://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2009/123132.htm</ref>

===Special Period===
{{Main|Special Period}}
The Cuban economy is still recovering from a decline in [[gross domestic product]] of at least 35% between 1989 and 1993 due to the loss of 80% of its trading partners{{Clarify|date=August 2009}} and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[subsidy|subsidies]].<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/cuba/economy.htm Cuba's Economy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This loss of subsidies coincided with a collapse in world sugar prices. Sugar had done well from 1985-1990, and crashed precipitously in 1990-1991, and did not recover for five years. Cuba had been insulated from world sugar prices by Soviet price guarantees.

This era was referred to as the "Special Period in Peacetime" later shortened to "[[Special Period]]". A ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'' paper claimed that "The famine in Cuba during the Special Period was caused by political and economic factors similar to the ones that caused a famine in [[North Korea]] in the mid-1990s, on the grounds that both countries were run by authoritarian regimes that denied ordinary people the food to which they were entitled when the public food distribution collapsed, and priority was given to the elite classes and the military."<ref name="cmaj">{{cite web|url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2474886|title=Health Consequences of Cuba's Special Period|work=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=July 29, 2008}}</ref> Other reports painted an equally dismal picture, describing Cubans having to resort to eating anything they could find, from [[Havana Zoo]] animals to [[domestic cat]]s.<ref name="parrotdiplomacy">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11792274|title=Parrot diplomacy|work=The Economist|date=July 24, 2008}}</ref> But although the collapse of centrally planned economies in the Soviet Union and other countries of the Eastern bloc meant that Cuba experienced severe economic difficulties, which led to a drop in calories per day from 3052 in 1989 to 2600 in 2006, mortality rates show a remarkably slight impact on public health thanks to the priority given by the government to maintaining a social safety net.<ref>[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/08/cubas_organic_r.php Cuba's Organic Revolution : TreeHugger<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The government has undertaken several reforms in recent years{{When|date=August 2009}} to stem excess [[liquidity]], increase labour incentives, and alleviate serious shortages of food, [[consumer good]]s, and services. To alleviate the economic crisis, the government introduced a few [[market economy|market]]-oriented reforms including opening to [[tourism]], allowing [[Foreign Direct Investment|foreign investment]], legalizing the [[U.S. dollar]], and authorizing self-employment for some 150 occupations. (This policy was later partially reversed, so that while the U.S. dollar is no longer accepted in businesses, it remains legal for Cubans to hold the currency.) These measures resulted in modest [[economic growth]]. The [[free market|liberalized]] [[agriculture|agricultural]] markets introduced in October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell above-quota production at [[free market]] prices, have broadened legal consumption alternatives and reduced [[black market]] prices.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}''
Another (less visible) cause of the economic decline was the decrease in the world demand and world price for sugar, gradually replaced by corn syrup, 30 % cheaper, after 1985.''

Government efforts to lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money supply caused the semi-official [[exchange rate]] for the [[Cuban peso]] to move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the dollar by year-end 1999. [[Living conditions]] in 1999 remained well below the 1989 level. New [[taxation|taxes]] introduced in 1996 have helped drive down the number of [[self-employment|self-employed]] workers from 208,000 in January 1996. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Havana announced in 1995 that GDP declined by 35% during 1989-93, the result of lost Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. One of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become dramatically uneconomic. Reflecting on the Special period Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] later admitted that many mistakes had been made, "The country had many economists and it is not my intention to criticize them, but I would like to ask why we hadn’t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible. The Soviet Union had collapsed, oil was costing $40 a barrel, sugar prices were at basement levels, so why did we not rationalize the industry?"<ref>[http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=270631&area=/insight/insight__international/ Castro's new soldiers - Mail & Guardian Online]</ref>

Due to the continued growth of tourism, growth began in 1999 with a 6.2% increase in GDP {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. Growth in recent years has picked up significantly, with a growth in GDP of 11.8% in 2005 according to official Cuban information {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. In 2007 the Cuban economy grew by 7.5%, below the expected 10%, but higher than the Latin American average rate of growth.

===Overview on the post-revolution economic performance===

Cuban-born US economist [[Carmelo Mesa-Lago]] has published an account on the ″Economic and Social Balance of
50 Years of Cuban Revolution″. According to Mesa-Lago, Cuba’s performance has been overwhelmingly negative with regard to the economic indicators. Cuba’s position fell within the region for 87% of those indicators and for the rest of the 13% it remained the same.<ref>Economic and Social Balance of
50 Years of Cuban Revolution by Carmelo Mesa-Lago. In: Cuba in Transition: Volume 19 p. 380. Available at http://www.ascecuba.org/publications/proceedings/volume19/pdfs/mesolago.pdf</ref> According to him Cuba
ranked third in the region in 1958 in terms of GDP per capita, surpassed only by [[Venezuela]] and [[Uruguay]]. It had descended to 9th, 11th or 12th place in the region by 2007.<ref>ibidem. p. 371.</ref> At the same time, Cuba's social indicators showed a more positive development.<ref>ibidem. p. 380.</ref>

Since Reforms were introduced, over 400K Cubans have signed up to be entrepreneurs. As of 2012, the government publishes a list of 181 official jobs no longer under their control, such as taxi driver, construction worker, and shopkeeper. Licenses may also be purchased for becoming a mule driver, palm tree trimmer, well-digger, button coverer and "dandy" - gentleman in traditional elegant white suit and hat. Where imports are double exports, and doctors earn £15/month, families may supplement incomes with extra jobs, and the resultant increased taxes may shore up the economy. In the last decade, half the country's sugar mills have closed down, and tourists now ride factory steam locomotives. Some 3M visitors bring nearly £2M/ yearly (2012). >150K farmers have signed up to lease land from the government for bonus crops. Before, home-owners were only allowed to swap; now buying and selling has created a real-estate boom. A new Havana fast-food burger pizza restaurant, La Pachanga, started in the owner's home, serves 1K meals on a Saturday at £3, the weekly government wage.<ref name=BBCSimonReeve2012>{{cite web|title=BBC Simon Reeve 2012 documentary|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVRlhgPF2U4|accessdate=23 September 2013}}</ref>

In 2007, Raúl Castro's administration hinted that the purchase of computers, DVD players and microwaves would become legal. However, monthly wages remain less than 20 U.S. dollars.<ref name="iht"/> Mobile phones, which have been restricted to Cubans working for foreign companies and government officials, have become legalized. The new program could put phones in the hands of hundreds of thousands of Cubans.<ref name="iht">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/28/news/Cuba-Cell-Phones.php|title=Cell phones, microwaves: New access to gizmos could deflect calls for deeper change in Cuba|date=March 28, 2008|work=International Herald Tribune}}</ref>

In 2010, [[Fidel Castro]], in agreement with Raúl Castro's reformist sentiment, admitted that the Cuban model based on the old Soviet model of centralized planning was no longer sustainable for the Cuban economy. While both leaders remain committed to [[dialectical materialism]], they are encouraging the creation of a co-operative variant of socialism where the state plays a less active role in the economy, and the formation of worker-owned co-operatives and self-employed enterprises is being encouraged.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/sep/10/fidel-castro-cuba-communist | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Stephen | last=Wilkinson | title=Cuba: from communist to co-operative? – Stephen Wilkinson | date=September 10, 2010}}</ref>

To remedy Cuba's economic structural distortions and inefficiencies, the Cuban model is being reformed as the expansion of the internal market and reactivation of access to global markets has been approved by the Sixth Congress on April 18, 2011 anticipated to be fully implemented by 2015.  This is considered an ''updating'' of the Cuban socialist model, although is commonly referred to as economic ''reforms.''  A comprehensive list compiled through an examination of articles from Carmelo Mesa-Lago, Jorge Dominguez, Omar Perez Villanueva, Vidal Alejandro, Philip Peters and the Economist outlining the main policy guidelines (Lineamientos) is as follows:<ref>{{cite book|last=Dominguez|first=Jorge|title=Cuban Economic and Social Development|year=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Perez Villanueva|first=Omar Evernly|coauthors=Pavel Vidal Alejandro|title=Cuban Perspectives on Cuban Socialism|journal=The Journal of the Research on Socialism and Democracy"|year=2010|volume=24|issue=1}}</ref>

On December 20, 2011 a new credit policy allowed Cuban banks to finance entrepreneurs and individuals wishing to make major purchases to do home improvements in addition to farmers.  "Cuban banks have long provided loans to farm cooperatives, they have offered credit to new recipients of farmland in usufruct since 2008, and in 2011 they began making loans to individuals for business and other purposes", (Peters 2012, 21).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Philip|first=Peters|title=A Viewers Guide to Cuba's Economic Reforms|journal=Lexington Institute|date=23|year=2012|month=May|page=21|url=http://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/cuba}}</ref>

Raul Castro signed law 313 in September 2013 in order to create a [[Special Economic Zone]] in the port city of [[Mariel]], the first in the country.

==Energy production==

By 2009, an "Energy Revolution" reduced blackouts, brownouts, switched kerosene and inefficient bulbs and appliances. The country has increased the number of solar- and wind-powered generators. Citizens were encouraged to swap old inefficient lamps with newer models to reduce consumption. A power tariff imposed economically punitive measurements on inefficient use of power.<ref>Laurie Guevara-Stone [http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/04/la-revolucion-energetica-cubas-energy-revolution "La Revolucion Energetica: Cuba's Energy Revolution"], Renewable Energy World International Magazine, 9 April 2009.</ref>

[[Rationing in Cuba]] refers to the system of food distribution known in Cuba as the ''Libreta de Abastecimiento'' ("Supplies booklet") with coupon booklets. Despite rumors, as of 2012, ration books at bodegas still supplement families with rice, oil, sugar, and matches, above government average wage £15 monthly. The government also sells licenses for entrepreneurs to increase tax revenue.<ref name=BBC2012SimonReeve>{{cite web|title=BBC 2012 Simon Reeve documentary|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVRlhgPF2U4|accessdate=23 September 2013}}</ref>

After the 1959 Cuban Revolution, citizens were not required to pay a personal [[income tax]] (their salaries being regarded as net of any taxes). However, from 1996, the State started to impose income taxes on Cubans earning hard currency, primarily the self-employed.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00EEDA1039F935A15752C1A963958260 |author=New York Times |month=November |year=1995 |title= Well-to-Do in Cuba to Pay an Income Tax |accessdate=2007-01-29 | work=The New York Times}}</ref>

The 2012 [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] ranks Cuba below 50, indicating undesirable corruption.<ref>http://www.transparency.org/cpi2012/results Corruption Perceptions Index 2012 View Country Results</ref>

==Agriculture==

==Industry==
[[Image:Oljepumpe cuba.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Pumpjack]]s in Cuba]]
In total, industrial production accounted for almost 37% of the Cuban GDP, or US$6.9 billion, and employs 24% of the population, or 2,671,440 people, in 1996. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} A rally in sugar prices since 2009, has stimulated new investment and development of sugar processing.

More recently Cuba's world-class biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is gaining in its importance to the economy. It has been claimed that soon it will become Cuba's main source of foreign exchange. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Among the products sold internationally are vaccines against various viral and bacterial pathogens, and promising anti-cancer vaccines are undergoing exhaustive clinical trials. Some Cuban scientists, like V. Verez-Bencomo, have been awarded international prizes for their contributions in biotechnology and Sugar Cane. Cuban vaccines are sold, among other countries, in Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and several Latin American countries. For example, the drug [[Heberprot-P]] has been developed as a cure for [[diabetic foot ulcer]] and has had success in many Third-World Markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhc.cu/ing/news/health/8587-ecuadorians-benefit-from-cuban-drug-heberprot-p.html |title=Ecuadorians benefit from Cuban drug Heberprot-p  |publisher=Radio Havana Cuba |date=2012-08-12 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}</ref>

===Tourism in Cuba===
{{Main|Tourism in Cuba}}
[[File:Varaderobeach.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A white sand beach in [[Varadero|Varadero, Cuba]]]]
In the mid-1990s tourism surpassed [[sugar]], long the mainstay of the Cuban economy, as the primary source of foreign exchange. Tourism figures prominently in the Cuban Government's plans for development, and a top official cast it as the "heart of the economy". Havana devotes significant resources to building new tourist facilities and renovating historic structures for use in the tourism sector. Cuban officials estimate roughly 1.6 million tourists visited Cuba in 1999 with about $1.9 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] in gross revenues. In 2000, 1,773,986 foreign visitors arrived in Cuba. Revenue from tourism reached US $1.7 billion.<ref>[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/Cuba-TOURISM-TRAVEL-AND-RECREATION.html Cuba - Tourism, travel, and recreation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By 2012, some 3M visitors bring nearly £2M/ yearly.<ref name=BBC2012SimonReeve/>

The rapid growth of tourism has had widespread social and economic repercussions in Cuba. This has led to speculation of the emergence of a two-tier economy<ref>[http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf Tourism in Cuba during the Special Period]</ref> and the fostering of a state of [[tourist segregation|tourist apartheid]] on the island. This situation was exacerbated by the influx of dollars into the Cuban economy during the 1990s, potentially creating a dual economy based on the dollar (the currency of tourists) on the one hand, and the peso on the other. Scarce imported goods - and even some of local manufacture, such as [[rum]] and [[coffee]]- could be had at dollars-only stores, but were hard to find or unavailable at peso prices. As a result, Cubans who earned only in the peso economy, outside the tourist sector, were at an economic disadvantage. Those with dollar incomes based upon the service industry began to live more comfortably. This widened the gulf between Cubans' material standards of living, in conflict with the Cuban Government's long term [[socialist]] policies.<ref>[http://traveloutward.com/articles/caribbean/6-03_cuba.shtml Lessons From Cuba] Travel Outward</ref>

===Retail===
Cuba has a very poorly developed retail sector. There are a few large shopping centers in Havana (Sept. 2012) but the prices are the same as in the USA. The commercial districts that existed before the revolution are largely shut down. Those that remain carry few and poorly made products that are priced in dollars and are too expensive for the average Cuban to purchase. The majority of the stores are small dollar stores, bodegas, agro-mercados (farmers' markets) and street stands.<ref>[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Americas/Cuba.html Cuba - Monetary unit:, Chief exports:, Chief imports:, Gross domestic product:, Balance of trade:<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Poverty==
Typical wages range from 400 non-convertible Cuban pesos a month, for a factory worker, to 700 per month for a doctor, or a range of around 17-30 U.S. dollars per month. However, the Human Development Index of Cuba still ranks much higher than the vast majority of Latin American nations.<ref name="comandate">{{cite news|date=February 21, 2008|work=The Economist|title=Cuba - The comandante's last move|url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=10727899}}</ref> After Cuba lost subsidies in 1991, malnutrition resulted in an outbreak of diseases and general hunger.<ref name="cordova">{{cite web|title=The situation of Cuban workers during the "Special Period in peacetime"|author=Efrén Córdova|url=http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/asce/cuba6/45Cordova.fm.pdf}}</ref> Despite this, the poverty level reported by the government is one of the lowest in the developing world, ranking 6th out of 108 countries, 4th in Latin America, and 48th among all countries.<ref>[[List of countries by Human Development Index#Complete list of countries]]</ref> Pensions are among the smallest in the Western hemisphere at $9.50. In 2009, Raúl Castro increased minimum pensions by 2 dollars, which he said was to recompense for those who have "dedicated a great part of their lives to working... and who remain firm in defense of socialism".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7370304.stm|title=Raul Castro raises state pension|publisher=BBC | date=April 27, 2008 | accessdate=January 3, 2010}}</ref>

==International trade==
The Netherlands receives the largest share of Cuban exports (24%), 70 to 80% of which go through Indiana Finance BV, a company owned by the [[Van 't Wout]] family, who have close personal ties with Fidel Castro.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Currently, this trend can be seen in other colonial Caribbean communities who have direct political ties with the global economy. (for example, British West Indies, United States Virgin Islands, French outer-territories, and so on).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Cubas primary import partner is Venezuela. The second largest trade partner is Canada, with a 22% share of the Cuban export market.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cuba/canada-cuba-trade.html FAQs on Canada-Cuba trade] CBC</ref>

==Foreign investment==
Since the Special Period, Cuba has actively courted foreign investment. All would be foreign investors are required to form joint ventures with the Cuban government. The sole exception to this rule are Venezuelans, who are allowed to hold 100% ownership in businesses due to an economic agreement between Cuba and Venezuela. Cuban officials said in early 1998 that there were a total of 332 [[joint venture]]s. Many of these are loans or contracts for management, supplies, or services normally not considered equity investment in Western economies. Investors are constrained by the U.S.-Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act which provides sanctions for those who "traffic" in property expropriated from U.S. citizens. As of March 1998, 15 executives of three foreign companies have been excluded from entry into the United States. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Over a dozen companies have pulled out of Cuba or altered their plans to invest there due to the threat of action under the Libertad Act.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===US Dollar===
In 1993 the Cuban Government made it legal for its people to possess and use the U.S. dollar. From then until 2004, the dollar became a major currency. To capture the hard currency flowing into the island through tourism and [[remittances]] - estimated at $500–800 million annually - the government set up state-run "dollar stores" throughout Cuba that sold 'luxury' food, household, and clothing items, compared with basic necessities, which were bought using the [[Cuban peso]]. As such, a gap in the standard of living developed between those with access to dollars and those without. Jobs that could earn dollar salaries or tips from foreign businesses and tourists became highly desirable. It was common to meet doctors, engineers, scientists, and other professionals working in restaurants or as taxicab drivers.

However, in response to stricter [[U.S. embargo against Cuba|economic sanctions by the US]], and because the authorities were pleased with Cuba's economic recovery, the Cuban government decided in October 2004 to remove the American dollar from circulation. In its place, the [[Cuban convertible peso]] is now used, which although not internationally traded, has a value pegged to that of the dollar. As a source of additional revenue, a 10% surcharge is levied for conversions from US dollars to the convertible peso; this surcharge does not apply to other currencies, so it acts as an encouragement for tourists to bring currencies like [[Euro]]s, [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] or [[Canadian dollar]]s into Cuba. Indeed, an increasing number of tourist zones now also accept Euros.

==Self-employment==
Over 400K Cubans have signed up to be entrepreneurs. As of 2012, the government publishes a list of 181 official jobs no longer under their control, such as taxi driver, construction worker, and shopkeeper. Licenses may also be purchased for becoming a mule driver, palm tree trimmer, well-digger, button coverer and "dandy" - gentleman in traditional elegant white suit and hat.<ref name=BBC2012SimonReeve/>

Owners of small private restaurants (''[[paladar]]es'') can seat no more than 12 people<ref>{{cite book

As of 2012, >150K farmers have signed up to lease land from the government for bonus crops. Before, home-owners were only allowed to swap; now buying and selling has created a real-estate boom. A new Havana fast-food burger pizza restaurant, La Pachanga, started in the owner's home, serves 1K meals on a Saturday at £3, the weekly government wage.<ref name=BBC2012SimonReeve/>

In cities, "[[urban agriculture]]" uses small parcels of land. Growing [[organopónicos]] (organic gardens) in the private sector has been attractive to city dwelling small producers who get to sell their products in the same place where they produce them, avoiding taxes and enjoying a measure of government help from the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) in the form of seed houses and advisers.

==Connection with Venezuela==
The relationship cultivated between Cuba and [[Venezuela]] in recent years has resulted in agreements in which Venezuela provides cheap oil in exchange for Cuban "missions" of doctors to bolster the Venezuelan health care system. Cuba, with the second-highest per capita number of physicians in the world (behind Italy), sends tens of thousands of doctors to other countries as aid, as well as to obtain favorable economic terms of trade.<ref>http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/03/05/3268483/how-will-the-venezuela-cuba-link.html
