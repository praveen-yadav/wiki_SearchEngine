'''Asteroids''' are [[minor planet]]s, especially those of the [[inner Solar System]]. The larger ones have also been called '''planetoids'''. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the [[Sun]] that did not show the disk of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet, but as minor planets in the [[outer Solar System]] were discovered, their [[volatiles|volatile]]-based surfaces were found to more closely resemble comets and so were often distinguished from traditional asteroids.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?asteroids| title=Asteroids | publisher=NASA – Jet Propulsion Laboratory | accessdate=13 September 2010}}</ref> Thus the term ''asteroid'' has come increasingly to refer specifically to the small bodies of the inner Solar System out to<!--includes Trojans--> the orbit of [[Jupiter]]. They are grouped with the outer bodies—[[Centaur (minor planet)|centaurs]], [[Neptune trojan]]s, and [[trans-Neptunian object]]s—as minor planets, which is the term preferred in astronomical circles.<ref>Asimov, Isaac, and Dole, Stephen H. ''Planets for Man'' (New York:  Random House, 1964), p.43.</ref> In this article the term "asteroid" refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System.

There are millions of asteroids, many thought to be the shattered remnants of [[planetesimal]]s, bodies within the young Sun's [[solar nebula]] that never grew large enough to become [[planet]]s.<ref>{{cite web | title=What Are Asteroids And Comets? | url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/#ast | work=Near Earth Object Program FAQ |publisher=[[NASA]] | accessdate=13 September 2010 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100909210213/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/| archivedate= 9 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The large majority of known asteroids orbit in the [[asteroid belt]] between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter or co-orbital with Jupiter (the [[Jupiter Trojan]]s). However, other orbital families exist with significant populations, including the [[near-Earth asteroids]]. Individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic [[Emission spectrum|spectra]], with the majority falling into three main groups: [[C-type asteroid|C-type]], [[S-type asteroid|S-type]], and [[M-type asteroid|M-type]]. These were named after and are generally identified with [[Carbon|carbon-rich]], [[Silicate|stony]], and [[metal]]lic compositions, respectively.

Only one asteroid, [[4 Vesta]], which has a relatively reflective surface, is normally visible to the naked eye, and this only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned. Rarely, small asteroids passing close to Earth may be visible to the naked eye for a short time.<ref>[http://www.space.com/spacewatch/050204_2004_mn4.html Closest Flyby of Large Asteroid to be Naked-Eye Visible], Space.com, 4 February 2005</ref> As of September 2013, the Minor Planet Center had data on more than one million objects, of which 625,106 had enough information to be given numbered designations.<ref>[http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/Desigs.html Provisional Designations], Minor Planet Center, 2013 Sept. 20</ref>

== Naming ==
{{Main|Minor planet#Naming}}
[[File:Asteroid20130318-full.jpg|thumb|right|[[2013 EC]], shown here in radar images, has a provisional designation]]
A newly discovered asteroid is given a [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] (such as {{mpl|2002 AT|4}}) consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code indicating the half-month of discovery and the sequence within that half-month. Once an asteroid's orbit has been confirmed, it is given a number, and later may also be given a name (e.g. [[433 Eros]]). The formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number (e.g. (433) Eros), but dropping the parentheses is quite common. Informally, it is common to drop the number altogether, or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text.

=== Symbols ===
{{main|Astronomical symbols}}
The first asteroids to be discovered were assigned iconic symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate the planets. By 1855 there were two dozen asteroid symbols, which often occurred in multiple variants.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Gould| first=B.

In 1851,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/astronomical-information-center/minor-planets| title=When did the asteroids become minor planets? | publisher=Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command | accessdate=6 November 2011}}</ref> after the fifteenth asteroid ([[15 Eunomia|Eunomia]]) had been discovered, [[Johann Franz Encke]] made a major change in the upcoming 1854 edition of the ''[[Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch]]'' (BAJ, ''Berlin Astronomical Yearbook''). He introduced a disk (circle), a traditional symbol for a star, as the generic symbol for an asteroid. The circle was then numbered in order of discovery to indicate a specific asteroid (although he assigned ① to the fifth, [[5 Astraea|Astraea]], while continuing to designate the first four only with their existing iconic symbols). The numbered-circle convention was quickly adopted by [[astronomer]]s, and the next asteroid to be discovered ([[16 Psyche]], in 1852) was the first to be designated in that way at the time of its discovery. However, Psyche was also given an iconic symbol, as were a few other asteroids discovered over the next few years (see chart above). [[20 Massalia]] was the first asteroid that was not assigned a symbol, and no additional iconic symbols were created after the 1855 discovery of [[37 Fides]].<ref>Except for Pluto and, in the astrological community, for a few outer bodies such as [[2060 Chiron]]</ref> That year Astraea's number was increased to ⑤, but the first four asteroids, Ceres to Vesta, were not listed by their numbers until the 1867 edition. The circle became a pair of parentheses, and the parentheses were sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades, leading to the modern convention.<ref name="hilton"/>

== Discovery ==
[[File:243 ida.jpg|thumb|right|[[243 Ida]] and its moon Dactyl. Dactyl is the first satellite of an asteroid to be discovered.]]
The first asteroid to be discovered, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], was found in 1801 by [[Giuseppe Piazzi]], and was originally considered to be a new planet.<ref group=note>Ceres is the largest asteroid and is now classified as a [[dwarf planet]]. All other asteroids are now classified as [[Small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]] along with comets, centaurs, and the smaller trans-Neptunian objects.</ref> This was followed by the discovery of other similar bodies, which, with the equipment of the time, appeared to be points of light, like stars, showing little or no planetary disc, though readily distinguishable from stars due to their apparent motions. This prompted the astronomer [[William Herschel|Sir William Herschel]] to propose the term "asteroid",<ref>{{Etymology of 'asteroid' Cunningham 2013}}</ref> coined in Greek as ἀστεροειδής ''asteroeidēs'' 'star-like, star-shaped', from Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀστήρ|ἀστήρ]]}} ''astēr'' 'star, planet'. In the early second half of the nineteenth century, the terms "asteroid" and "planet" (not always qualified as "minor") were still used interchangeably; for example, the [http://books.google.ca/books?id=NAMAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA316&dq=%22planets%22+asteroids ''Annual of Scientific Discovery for 1871''], page 316, reads "Professor J. Watson has been awarded by the Paris Academy of Sciences, the astronomical prize, Lalande foundation, for the discovery of eight new asteroids in one year. The planet Lydia (No. 110), discovered by M. Borelly at the Marseilles Observatory [...] M. Borelly had previously discovered two planets bearing the numbers 91 and 99 in the system of asteroids revolving between Mars and Jupiter".

=== Historical methods ===
Asteroid discovery methods have dramatically improved over the past two centuries.

In the last years of the 18th century, Baron [[Franz Xaver von Zach]] organized a group of 24 astronomers to search the sky for the missing planet predicted at about 2.8 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from the Sun by the [[Titius-Bode law]], partly because of the discovery, by Sir [[William Herschel]] in 1781, of the planet [[Uranus]] at the distance predicted by the law. This task required that hand-drawn sky charts be prepared for all stars in the [[zodiac]]al band down to an agreed-upon limit of faintness. On subsequent nights, the sky would be charted again and any moving object would, hopefully, be spotted. The expected motion of the missing planet was about 30 seconds of arc per hour, readily discernible by observers.

The first object, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], was not discovered by a member of the group, but rather by accident in 1801 by [[Giuseppe Piazzi]], director of the observatory of [[Palermo]] in [[Sicily]]. He discovered a new star-like object in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and followed the displacement of this object during several nights. His colleague, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], used these observations to find the exact distance from this unknown object to the Earth. Gauss' calculations placed the object between the planets [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. Piazzi named it after [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], the Roman goddess of agriculture.

Three other asteroids ([[2 Pallas]], [[3 Juno]], and [[4 Vesta]]) were discovered over the next few years, with Vesta found in 1807. After eight more years of fruitless searches, most astronomers assumed that there were no more and abandoned any further searches.

However, [[Karl Ludwig Hencke]] persisted, and began searching for more asteroids in 1830. Fifteen years later, he found [[5 Astraea]], the first new asteroid in 38 years. He also found [[6 Hebe]] less than two years later. After this, other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that (except the wartime year 1945). Notable asteroid hunters of this early era were [[John Russell Hind|J. R. Hind]], [[Annibale de Gasparis]], [[Karl Theodor Robert Luther|Robert Luther]], [[Hermann Mayer Salomon Goldschmidt|H. M. S. Goldschmidt]], [[Jean Chacornac]], [[James Ferguson (astronomer)|James Ferguson]], [[Norman Robert Pogson]], [[Ernst Wilhelm Leberecht Tempel|E. W. Tempel]], [[James Craig Watson|J. C. Watson]], [[Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters|C. H. F. Peters]], [[Alphonse Louis Nicolas Borrelly|A. Borrelly]], [[Johann Palisa|J. Palisa]], the [[Paul Henry and Prosper Henry|Henry brothers]] and [[Auguste Charlois]].

In 1891, [[Maximilian Franz Joseph Cornelius Wolf|Max Wolf]] pioneered the use of [[astrophotography]] to detect asteroids, which appeared as short streaks on long-exposure photographic plates. This dramatically increased the rate of detection compared with earlier visual methods: Wolf alone discovered 248 asteroids, beginning with [[323 Brucia]], whereas only slightly more than 300 had been discovered up to that point. It was known that there were many more, but most astronomers did not bother with them{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, calling them "vermin of the skies", a phrase variously attributed to [[Eduard Suess]]<ref>{{cite journal | last=Hale | first=George E. | authorlink = George Ellery Hale | title= Address at the semi-centennial of the Dearborn Observatory: Some Reflections on the Progress of Astrophysics | journal=Popular Astronomy | year=1916 | volume=24 | pages=550–558, at p 555 | bibcode= 1916PA.....24..550H}}</ref>  and [[Edmund Weiss]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Seares |first=Frederick H. | title= Address of the Retiring President of the Society in Awarding the Bruce Medal to Professor Max Wolf | journal=Publ.

=== Manual methods of the 1900s and modern reporting ===
Until 1998, asteroids were discovered by a four-step process. First, a region of the sky was [[Astrophotography|photographed]] by a wide-field [[telescope]], or [[Astrograph]]. Pairs of photographs were taken, typically one hour apart. Multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days. Second, the two films or [[photographic plate|plates]] of the same region were viewed under a [[stereoscope]]. Any body in orbit around the Sun would move slightly between the pair of films. Under the stereoscope, the image of the body would seem to float slightly above the background of stars. Third, once a moving body was identified, its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope. The location would be measured relative to known star locations.<ref>{{cite web | last=Chapman | first=Mary G. | date=May 17, 1992 | url=http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/About/People/CarolynShoemaker | title=Carolyn Shoemaker, Planetary Astronomer and Most Successful 'Comet Hunter' To Date | publisher=USGS | accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref>

These first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery: the observer has only found an apparition, which gets a [[provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]], made up of the year of discovery, a letter representing the half-month of discovery, and finally a letter and a number indicating the discovery's sequential number (example: {{mp|1998 FJ|74}}).

The last step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations to the [[Minor Planet Center]], where computer programs determine whether an apparition ties together earlier apparitions into a single orbit. If so, the object receives a catalogue number and the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer, and granted the honor of naming the object subject to the approval of the [[International Astronomical Union]].

=== Computerized methods ===
[[File:Asteroid 2004 FH.gif|framed|right|
[[2004 FH]] is the center dot being followed by the sequence; the object that flashes by during the clip is an [[satellite|artificial satellite]].]]
There is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross [[Earth]]'s, and that could, given enough time, collide with Earth (see [[Earth-crosser asteroid]]s). The three most important groups of [[near-Earth asteroid]]s are the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollos]], [[Amor asteroid|Amors]], and [[Aten asteroid|Atens]]. Various [[asteroid deflection strategies]] have been proposed, as early as the 1960s<!--- ''Project Icarus'' --->.

The [[near-Earth object|near-Earth]] asteroid [[433 Eros]] had been discovered as long ago as 1898, and the 1930s brought a flurry of similar objects. In order of discovery, these were: [[1221 Amor]], [[1862 Apollo]], [[2101 Adonis]], and finally [[69230 Hermes]], which approached within 0.005 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]] of the [[Earth]] in 1937. Astronomers began to realize the possibilities of Earth impact.

Two events in later decades increased the alarm: the increasing acceptance of [[Walter Alvarez]]' hypothesis that an [[impact event]] resulted in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction]], and the 1994 observation of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] crashing into [[Jupiter]]. The U.S. military also declassified the information that its military satellites, built to detect nuclear explosions, had detected hundreds of upper-atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to 10 metres across.

All these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient automated systems that consist of Charge-Coupled Device ([[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes. As of spring 2011, 89.4% to 96.5% of asteroids one kilometer or larger in diameter had been discovered.<ref>[http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/ NEO Discovery Statistics] from  Mainzer et al (2011)</ref> A list of teams using such automated systems includes:<ref>{{cite web

Traditionally, small bodies orbiting the Sun were classified as asteroids, [[comet]]s or [[meteoroid]]s, with anything smaller than ten metres across being called a meteoroid.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Beech, M. |authorlink=Martin Beech | year=1995 | month=September | title=On the Definition of the Term Meteoroid | journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=36 | issue=3 | pages=281–284 |bibcode=1995QJRAS..36..281B | last2=Steel | first2=D. |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995QJRAS..36..281B |deadurl=no |accessdate=27 September 2013}}</ref><ref>Czechowski L., Adv. Space Res., 38, 2006,2054-2059. DOI 10.1016/j.astr.2006.09.004</ref> The term "asteroid" is ill-defined. It never had a formal definition, with the broader term [[minor planet]] being preferred by the [[International Astronomical Union]] from 1853 on. In 2006, the term "[[small Solar System body]]" was introduced to cover both most minor planets and comets.<ref>The definition of "small Solar System bodies" says that they "include most of the Solar System asteroids, most trans-Neptunian objects, comets, and other small bodies". [http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0602/index.html ''The Final IAU Resolution on the definition of "planet" ready for voting''] (IAU)</ref> Other languages prefer "planetoid" (Greek for "planet-like"), and this term is occasionally used in English for larger minor planets such as the [[dwarf planet]]s. The word "[[planetesimal]]" has a similar meaning, but refers specifically to the small building blocks of the planets that existed when the Solar System was forming. The term "planetule" was coined by the  geologist [[William Daniel Conybeare]] to describe minor planets,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hyperdictionary.com/dict-e/p-44.html | title=English Dictionary&nbsp;– Browsing Page P-44 | publisher=HyperDictionary.com | accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref> but is not in common use. The three largest objects in the asteroid belt, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas]], and [[4 Vesta]], grew to the stage of [[protoplanet]]s. Ceres is a [[dwarf planet]], the only one in the inner Solar System.

When found, asteroids were seen as a class of objects distinct from comets, and there was no unified term for the two until "small Solar System body" was coined in 2006. The main difference between an asteroid and a comet is that a comet shows a coma due to [[Outgassing|sublimation]] of near surface ices by solar radiation. A few objects have ended up being dual-listed because they were first classified as minor planets but later showed evidence of cometary activity. Conversely, some (perhaps all) comets are eventually depleted of their surface [[volatiles|volatile ices]] and become asteroids. A further distinction is that comets typically have more eccentric orbits than most asteroids; most "asteroids" with notably eccentric orbits are probably dormant or extinct comets.<ref>Weissman, Paul R., William F. Bottke, Jr., and Harold F. Levinson. "Evolution of Comets into Asteroids." ''Southwest Research Institute, Planetary Science Directorate.'' 2002. Web [http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hal/PDF/asteroids3.pdf Retrieved 3 Aug. 2010]</ref>

For almost two centuries, from the discovery of [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] in 1801 until the discovery of the first [[centaur (minor planet)|centaur]], [[2060 Chiron]], in 1977, all known asteroids spent most of their time at or within the orbit of Jupiter, though a few such as [[944 Hidalgo]] ventured far beyond Jupiter for part of their orbit. When astronomers started finding more small bodies that permanently resided further out than Jupiter, now called [[centaur (minor planet)|centaurs]], they numbered them among the traditional asteroids, though there was debate over whether they should be considered as asteroids or as a new type of object. Then, when the first [[trans-Neptunian object]], [[1992 QB1]], was discovered in 1992, and especially when large numbers of similar objects started turning up, new terms were invented to sidestep the issue: [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper-belt object]], [[trans-Neptunian object]], [[scattered-disc object]], and so on. These inhabit the cold outer reaches of the Solar System where ices remain solid and comet-like bodies are not expected to exhibit much cometary activity; if centaurs or trans-Neptunian objects were to venture close to the Sun, their volatile ices would sublimate, and traditional approaches would classify them as comets and not asteroids.

The innermost of these are the [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper-belt objects]], called "objects" partly to avoid the need to classify them as asteroids or comets.<ref name=KBOasteroids>[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=601 "Are Kuiper Belt Objects asteroids?"], "Ask an astronomer", Cornell University</ref> They are believed to be predominantly comet-like in composition, though some may be more akin to asteroids.<ref>[http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect19/Sect19_22.html "Asteroids and Comets"], NASA website</ref> Furthermore, most do not have the highly eccentric orbits associated with comets, and the ones so far discovered are larger than traditional [[Comet nucleus|comet nuclei]]. (The much more distant [[Oort cloud]] is hypothesized to be the main reservoir of dormant comets.) Other recent observations, such as the analysis of the cometary dust collected by the [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] probe, are increasingly blurring the distinction between comets and asteroids,<ref>[http://www.sciam.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=ADD0878B-D6C3-3B70-7B5BC373545BB82D "Comet Dust Seems More Asteroidy"] ''Scientific American'', January 25, 2008</ref> suggesting "a continuum between asteroids and comets" rather than a sharp dividing line.<ref>[http://space.newscientist.com/channel/solar-system/comets-asteroids/dn13224-comet-samples-are-surprisingly-asteroidlike.html "Comet samples are surprisingly asteroid-like"], ''New Scientist'', 24 January 2008</ref>

The minor planets beyond Jupiter's orbit are sometimes also called "asteroids", especially in popular presentations.<ref>For instance, a joint [[NASA]]–[[JPL]] public-outreach website states:
{{quote|"We include Trojans (bodies captured in Jupiter's 4th and 5th Lagrange points), Centaurs (bodies in orbit between Jupiter and Neptune), and trans-Neptunian objects (orbiting beyond Neptune) in our definition of "asteroid" as used on this site, even though they may more correctly be called "minor planets" instead of asteroids."}} <http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?asteroids></ref>
However, it is becoming increasingly common for the term "asteroid" to be restricted to minor planets of the inner Solar System.<ref name=KBOasteroids/> Therefore, this article will restrict itself for the most part to the classical asteroids: objects of the [[asteroid belt]], [[Jupiter trojan]]s, and [[near-Earth object]]s.

When the IAU introduced the class [[Small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]] in 2006 to include most objects previously classified as minor planets and comets, they created the class of [[dwarf planet]]s for the largest minor planets—those that have enough mass to have become ellipsoidal under their own gravity. According to the IAU, "the term 'minor planet' may still be used, but generally the term 'Small Solar System Body' will be preferred."<ref>[http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0603/questions_answers/ Questions and Answers on Planets], IAU</ref> Currently only the largest object in the asteroid belt, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], at about {{convert|950|km|0|abbr=on}} across, has been placed in the dwarf planet category, although there are several large asteroids ([[4 Vesta|Vesta]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], and [[10 Hygiea|Hygiea]]) that may be classified as dwarf planets when their shapes are better known.<ref>[http://space.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn9761&feedId=online-news_rss20F53 "Three new planets may join solar system"], ''New Scientist'', 16 August 2006</ref>

== Formation ==
It is believed that [[planetesimal]]s in the asteroid belt evolved much like the rest of the [[solar nebula]] until Jupiter neared its current mass, at which point excitation from [[orbital resonance]]s with Jupiter ejected over 99% of planetesimals in the belt. Simulations and a discontinuity in spin rate and spectral properties suggest that asteroids larger than approximately {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=on}} in diameter accreted during that early era, whereas smaller bodies are fragments from collisions between asteroids during or after the Jovian disruption.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bottke | first1 = Durda | last2 = Durda | first2 = Jedicke | last3 = Nesvorny | first3 = Vokrouhlicky | last4 = Jedicke | first4 =  R| year = 2005 | title =  The fossilized size distribution of the main asteroid belt | url = http://astro.mff.cuni.cz/davok/papers/fossil05.pdf| journal = Icarus | volume = 175 | issue = | page = 111 |bibcode = 2005Icar..175..111B |doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2004.10.026 | last5 = Morbidelli | first5 = A | last6 = Vokrouhlicky | first6 = D | last7 = Levison | first7 = H }}</ref> Ceres and Vesta grew large enough to melt and [[Planetary differentiation|differentiate]], with heavy metallic elements sinking to the core, leaving rocky minerals in the crust.<ref name=ACM>{{cite book|title=Asteroids, Comets, and Meteors|author=Kerrod, Robin|year=2000|publisher=Lerner Publications Co.|isbn=0-585-31763-1}}</ref>

In the [[Nice model]], many [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper-belt objects]] are captured in the outer asteroid belt, at distances greater than 2.6 AU. Most were later ejected by Jupiter, but those that remained may be the [[D-type asteroid]]s, and possibly include Ceres.<ref>William B.

Various dynamical groups of asteroids have been discovered orbiting in the inner Solar System. Their orbits are perturbed by the gravity of other bodies in the Solar System and by the [[Yarkovsky effect]]. Significant populations include:

=== Asteroid belt ===
{{main|Asteroid belt}}

The majority of known asteroids orbit within the asteroid belt between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]], generally in relatively low-[[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] (i.e. not very elongated) orbits. This belt is now estimated to contain between 1.1 and 1.9 million asteroids larger than {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} in diameter,<ref>

</ref> and millions of smaller ones. These asteroids may be remnants of the [[protoplanetary disk]], and in this region the [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of [[planetesimal]]s into planets during the formative period of the Solar System was prevented by large gravitational perturbations by [[Jupiter]].

=== Trojans ===
{{main|Trojan (astronomy)|l1=Trojan asteroids}}

Trojan asteroids are a population that share an orbit with a larger planet or moon, but do not collide with it because they orbit in one of the two [[Lagrangian point]]s of stability, [[Trojan points|L4 and L5]], which lie 60° ahead of and behind the larger body.

The most significant population of Trojan asteroids are the [[Jupiter Trojan]]s. Although fewer Jupiter Trojans have been discovered as of 2010, it is thought that they are as numerous as the asteroids in the asteroid belt.

A couple of [[trojan (astronomy)|trojans]] have also been found orbiting with [[Mars]].<ref group=note>Neptune also has a few known trojans, and these are thought to actually be much more numerous than the Jovian trojans. However, they are often included in the [[trans-Neptunian object|trans-Neptunian]] population rather than counted with the asteroids.</ref>

=== Near-Earth asteroids ===
{{main|Near-Earth object#Near-Earth asteroids|l1=Near-Earth asteroids}}

Near-Earth asteroids, or NEAs, are asteroids that have orbits that pass close    to that of Earth.  Asteroids that actually cross the Earth's orbital path are known as ''Earth-crossers''. As of May 2010, 7,075 near-Earth asteroids are known and the number over one kilometre in diameter is estimated to be 500–1,000.

== Characteristics ==

=== Size distribution ===

Asteroids vary greatly in size, from almost {{val|1000|u=km}} for the largest down to rocks just tens of metres across.<ref group=note>Below {{val|10|u=m}}, these rocks are by convention considered to be [[meteoroid]]s.</ref> The three largest are very much like miniature planets: they are roughly spherical, have at least partly differentiated interiors,<ref name=Schmidt2007>{{cite journal |title=Hubble Space Telescope Observations of 2 Pallas |journal=American Astronomical Society, DPS meeting #39 |volume=39 |page=485 |year=2007 |bibcode=2007DPS....39.3519S |author1=Schmidt, B. |author2=Russell, C.

C. |displayauthors=8}}</ref> and are thought to be surviving [[protoplanet]]s. The vast majority, however, are much smaller and are irregularly shaped; they are thought to be either surviving [[planetesimal]]s or fragments of larger bodies.

The [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] is by far the largest asteroid, with a diameter of {{convert|975|km|-1|abbr=on}}. The next largest are [[2 Pallas]] and [[4 Vesta]], both with diameters of just over {{convert|500|km|abbr=on|-2}}. Vesta is the only main-belt asteroid that can, on occasion, be visible to the naked eye. On some rare occasions, a near-Earth asteroid may briefly become visible without technical aid; see [[99942 Apophis]].

The mass of all the objects of the [[asteroid belt]], lying between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]], is estimated to be about 2.8–3.2{{e|21}}&nbsp;kg, or about 4 percent of the mass of the Moon. Of this, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] comprises {{val|.95|e=21|u=kg}}, a third of the total.<ref>{{cite conference | first=E. V. |last=Pitjeva | authorlink=Elena V.

The number of asteroids then increases rapidly as their individual masses decrease.

The number of asteroids decreases markedly with size. Although this generally follows a [[power law]], there are 'bumps' at {{val|5|u=km}} and {{val|100|u=km}}, where more asteroids than expected from a [[logarithmic distribution]] are found.<ref>[http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/ivezic/Astr598/lecture4.pdf Davis 2002, "Asteroids III", cited by Željko Ivezić]</ref>

===Rotation===
Measurements of the rotation rates of large asteroids in the asteroid belt show that there is an upper limit. No asteroid with a diameter larger than 100 meters has a rotation period smaller than 2.2 hours. For asteroids rotating faster than approximately this rate, the inertia at the surface is greater than the gravitational force, so any loose surface material would be flung out. However, a solid object should be able to rotate much more rapidly. This suggests that most asteroids with a diameter over 100 meters are [[rubble pile]]s formed through accumulation of debris after collisions between asteroids.<ref>{{cite web

=== Composition ===
[[File:Vesta Cratered terrain with hills and ridges.jpg|thumb|right|Cratered terrain on 4 Vesta]]
The physical composition of asteroids is varied and in most cases poorly understood. Ceres appears to be composed of a rocky core covered by an icy mantle, where Vesta is thought to have a [[nickel-iron]] core, [[olivine]] mantle, and basaltic crust.<ref>[http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1995/20/image/ HubbleSite – NewsCenter – Asteroid or Mini-Planet? Hubble Maps the Ancient Surface of Vesta (04/19/1995) – Release Images<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[10 Hygiea]], however, which appears to have a uniformly primitive composition of [[carbonaceous chondrite]], is thought to be the largest undifferentiated asteroid. Most of the smaller asteroids are thought to be piles of rubble held together loosely by gravity, though the largest are probably solid. Some asteroids have [[Asteroid moon|moons]] or are co-orbiting [[binary asteroid|binaries]]: Rubble piles, moons, binaries, and scattered [[asteroid families]] are believed to be the results of collisions that disrupted a parent asteroid.

Composition is calculated from three primary sources: [[albedo]], surface spectrum, and density. The last can only be determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have. So far, every asteroid with moons has turned out to be a rubble pile, a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume. The investigated asteroids are as large as 280&nbsp;km in diameter, and include [[121 Hermione]] (268×186×183&nbsp;km), and [[87 Sylvia]] (384×262×232&nbsp;km). Only half a dozen asteroids are [[List of notable asteroids#Largest by diameter|larger than 87 Sylvia]], though none of them have moons; however, some smaller asteroids are thought to be more massive, suggesting they may not have been disrupted, and indeed [[511 Davida]], the same size as Sylvia to within measurement error, is estimated to be two and a half times as massive, though this is highly uncertain. The fact that such large asteroids as Sylvia can be rubble piles, presumably due to disruptive impacts, has important consequences for the formation of the Solar system: Computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging, but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge. This means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly.<ref>Marchis, Descamps, et al. ''Icarus'', Feb. 2011</ref>

On October 7, 2009, the presence of [[ice|water ice]] was confirmed on the surface of [[24 Themis]] using [[NASA]]’s [[Infrared Telescope Facility]]. The surface of the asteroid appears completely covered in ice. As this [[ice]] layer is [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimated]], it may be getting replenished by a reservoir of ice under the surface. Organic compounds were also detected on the surface.<ref>{{cite news

===Surface features===
Most asteroids outside the big four (Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, and Hygiea) are likely to be broadly similar in appearance, if irregular in shape. 50-km (31-mi) [[253 Mathilde]] (shown at right) is a rubble pile saturated with craters with diameters the size of the asteroid's radius, and Earth-based observations of 300-km (186-mi) [[511 Davida]], one of the largest asteroids after the big four, reveal a similarly angular profile, suggesting it is also saturated with radius-size craters.<ref>A.R. Conrad ''et al.'' 2007. "[http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/people/conrad/research/pub/d511.pdf Direct measurement of the size, shape, and pole of 511 Davida with Keck AO in a single night]", ''Icarus,'' {{doi|10.1016/j.icarus.2007.05.004}}</ref> Medium-sized asteroids such as Mathilde and [[243 Ida]] that have been observed up close also reveal a deep [[regolith]] covering the surface. Of the big four, Pallas and Hygiea are practically unknown. Vesta has compression fractures encircling a radius-size crater at its south pole but is otherwise a [[spheroid]]. Ceres seems quite different in the glimpses Hubble has provided, with surface features that are unlikely to be due to simple craters and impact basins, but details will not be known until ''Dawn'' arrives in 2015.

===Color===
Asteroids become darker and redder with age due to [[space weathering]].<ref>{{cite web |title=University of Hawaii Astronomer and Colleagues Find Evidence That Asteroids Change Color as They Age |work=University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy |date=19 May 2005 |url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/press-releases/Jedicke_asteroids5-17-04.html |accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref> However evidence suggests most of the color change occurs rapidly, in the first hundred thousands years, limiting the usefulness of spectral measurement for determining the age of asteroids.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sun damage conceals asteroids' true ages |author=Rachel Courtland |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=30 April 2009 |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17062-sun-damage-conceals-asteroids-true-ages.html |accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref>

== Classification ==
Asteroids are commonly classified according to two criteria: the characteristics of their orbits, and features of their reflectance [[visible spectrum|spectrum]].

=== Orbital classification ===
{{Main|Asteroid group|Asteroid family}}

Many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Apart from the broadest divisions, it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered. Groups are relatively loose dynamical associations, whereas families are tighter and result from the catastrophic break-up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past.<ref>{{cite journal
 | last=Zappalà | first=V.
 | title=Asteroid families: Search of a 12,487-asteroid sample using two different clustering techniques
 | journal=Icarus | year=1995 | volume=116
 | issue=2 | pages=291–314
 | bibcode=1995Icar..116..291Z
 | doi=10.1006/icar.1995.1127 }}</ref> Families have only been recognized within the [[asteroid belt]]. They were first recognized by [[Kiyotsugu Hirayama]] in 1918 and are often called [[Hirayama families]] in his honor.

About 30–35% of the bodies in the asteroid belt belong to dynamical families each thought to have a common origin in a past collision between asteroids.  A family has also been associated with the plutoid [[dwarf planet]] {{dp|Haumea}}.

==== Quasi-satellites and horseshoe objects ====
Some asteroids have unusual [[horseshoe orbit]]s that are co-orbital with the [[Earth]] or some other planet. Examples are [[3753 Cruithne]] and {{mpl|2002 AA|29}}. The first instance of this type of orbital arrangement was discovered between [[Saturn]]'s moons [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]] and [[Janus (moon)|Janus]].

Sometimes these horseshoe objects temporarily become [[quasi-satellite]]s for a few decades or a few hundred years, before returning to their earlier status. Both Earth and [[Venus]] are known to have quasi-satellites.

Such objects, if associated with Earth or Venus or even hypothetically [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], are a special class of [[Aten asteroid]]s.  However, such objects could be associated with outer planets as well.

=== Spectral classification ===
[[File:433eros.jpg|thumb|right|This picture of [[433 Eros]] shows the view looking from one end of the asteroid across the gouge on its underside and toward the opposite end. Features as small as {{convert|35|m|0|abbr=on}} across can be seen.]]
{{Main|Asteroid spectral types}}

In 1975, an asteroid [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] system based on [[color]], [[albedo]], and [[spectral line|spectral shape]] was developed by [[Clark R. Chapman]], [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]], and [[Ben Zellner]].<ref>{{cite journal | first=C. R. | last=Chapman | title=Surface properties of asteroids: A synthesis of polarimetry, radiometry, and spectrophotometry | journal=Icarus | volume=25 | issue=1 | pages=104–130 | bibcode=1975Icar...25..104C | year=1975 | doi=10.1016/0019-1035(75)90191-8 | last2=Morrison | first2=David | last3=Zellner | first3=Ben}}</ref> These properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroid's surface material. The original classification system had three categories: [[C-type asteroid|C-types]] for dark carbonaceous objects (75% of known asteroids), [[S-type asteroid|S-types]] for stony (silicaceous) objects (17% of known asteroids) and U for those that did not fit into either C or S. This classification has since been expanded to include many other asteroid types. The number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied.

The two most widely used taxonomies now used are the [[Tholen classification]] and [[Asteroid spectral types#SMASS classification|SMASS classification]]. The former was proposed in 1984 by [[David J. Tholen]], and was based on data collected from an eight-color asteroid survey performed in the 1980s. This resulted in 14 asteroid categories.<ref>{{cite conference | last=Tholen | first=D. J. | title=Asteroid taxonomic classifications | booktitle=Asteroids II; Proceedings of the Conference | pages=1139–1150 | publisher=University of Arizona Press | date=March 8–11, 1988 | location=Tucson, AZ | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989aste.conf.1139T | accessdate=14 April 2008}}</ref> In 2002, the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey resulted in a modified version of the Tholen taxonomy with 24 different types. Both systems have three broad categories of C, S, and X asteroids, where X consists of mostly metallic asteroids, such as the [[M-type asteroid|M-type]]. There are also several smaller classes.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Bus | first=S. J. | title=Phase II of the Small Main-belt Asteroid Spectroscopy Survey: A feature-based taxonomy | journal=Icarus | year=2002 | volume=158 | issue=1 | page=146 | doi=10.1006/icar.2002.6856 | bibcode=2002Icar..158..146B}}</ref>

Note that the proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type; some types are easier to detect than others, biasing the totals.

==== Problems ====
Originally, spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroid's composition.<ref>{{cite book | first=Harry Y. | last=McSween Jr. | year=1999 | title=Meteorites and their Parent Planets | edition=2nd | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-521-58751-4 }}</ref> However, the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good, and a variety of classifications are in use. This has led to significant confusion. Although asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials, there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of similar materials.

At present, the spectral classification based on several coarse resolution spectroscopic surveys in the 1990s is still the standard. Scientists cannot agree on a better taxonomic system,{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} largely due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed measurements consistently for a large sample of asteroids (e.g. finer resolution spectra, or non-spectral data such as densities would be very useful).

Until the age of [[Spaceflight|space travel]], objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes and their shapes and terrain remained a mystery. The best modern ground-based telescopes and the Earth-orbiting [[Hubble Space Telescope]] can resolve a small amount of detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids, but even these mostly remain little more than fuzzy blobs. Limited information about the shapes and compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their [[light curve]]s (their variation in brightness as they rotate) and their spectral properties, and asteroid sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occulations (when an asteroid passes directly in front of a star). [[Radar]] imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters, especially for near-Earth asteroids. In terms of [[delta-v]] and propellant requirements, NEOs are more easily accessible than the Moon.<ref>[http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/project/neo/pdf/NEO_feasibility.pdf A Piloted Orion Flight to a Near-Earth Object: A Feasibility Study]</ref>

The first close-up photographs of asteroid-like objects were taken in 1971 when the [[Mariner 9]] probe imaged [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], the two small moons of [[Mars]], which are probably captured asteroids. These images revealed the irregular, potato-like shapes of most asteroids, as did later images from the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes of the small moons of the [[gas giant]]s.

The first true asteroid to be photographed in close-up was [[951 Gaspra]] in 1991, followed in 1993 by [[243 Ida]] and its moon [[Dactyl (asteroid)|Dactyl]], all of which were imaged by the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo probe]] en route to [[Jupiter]].

The first dedicated asteroid probe was [[NEAR Shoemaker]], which photographed [[253 Mathilde]] in 1997, before entering into orbit around [[433 Eros]], finally landing on its surface in 2001.

Other asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft en route to other destinations include [[9969 Braille]] (by [[Deep Space 1]] in 1999), and [[5535 Annefrank]] (by [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] in 2002).

In September 2005, the Japanese [[Hayabusa (spacecraft)|Hayabusa]] probe started studying [[25143 Itokawa]] in detail and was plagued with difficulties, but [[Sample return mission|returned samples]] of its surface to earth on June 13, 2010.

The European [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta probe]] (launched in 2004) flew by [[2867 Šteins]] in 2008 and [[21 Lutetia]], the second-largest asteroid visited to date, in 2010.

In September 2007, [[NASA]] launched the [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn Mission]], which orbited the [[protoplanet]] [[4 Vesta]] from July 2011 to September 2012, and is planned to orbit [[1 Ceres]] in 2015. 4 Vesta is the largest asteroid visited to date.

On 13 December 2012, China's lunar orbiter [[Chang'e 2]] flew within 2 miles (3&nbsp;km) of the asteroid [[4179 Toutatis]] on an extended mission.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) plans to launch around 2015 the improved [[Hayabusa 2]] space probe and to return asteroid samples by 2020. Current target for the mission is the [[C-type asteroid]] {{mpl|(162173) 1999 JU|3}}.

In May 2011, NASA announced the [[OSIRIS-REx]] sample return mission to asteroid [[1999 RQ36]], and is expected to launch in 2016.

On February 15, 2013, [[Chelyabinsk meteor|an asteroid]] measuring approximately 18 metres (59&nbsp;ft) with a mass of about 9,100 tonnes (10,000 short tons) exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia causing 1,500 injuries and damaging 7,000 buildings. Small samples of the rocky [[Chelyabinsk meteorite]] were quickly recovered and analyzed with a larger fragment found several months later.

In spring 2013, NASA announced the planning stages of a mission to capture a near-Earth asteroid and move it into lunar orbit where it could possibly be visited by astronauts and later impacted into the Moon.<ref>[http://www.space.com/22993-nasa-slam-captured-asteroid-moon.html NASA May Slam Captured Asteroid Into Moon (Eventually)], space.com, Mike Wall, September 30, 2013</ref>

It has been suggested that asteroids might be used as a source of materials that may be rare or exhausted on earth ([[asteroid mining]]), or materials for constructing [[space habitats]] (see [[Colonization of the asteroids]]). Materials that are heavy and expensive to launch from earth may someday be mined from asteroids and used for [[space manufacturing]] and construction.

== Fiction ==
{{Main|Asteroids in fiction}}

Asteroids and the asteroid belt are a staple of science fiction stories. Asteroids play several potential roles in science fiction: as places human beings might colonize, resources for extracting minerals, hazards encountered by spaceships traveling between two other points, and as a threat to life on Earth by potential impact.
