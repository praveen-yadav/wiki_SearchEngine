An associated pair of centrioles, surrounded by an amorphous mass of dense material, called the [[pericentriolar material]], or PCM, makes up a compound structure called a [[centrosome]].<ref name=edde/>

Most centrioles are made up of nine sets of [[microtubule]] triplets, arranged in a cylinder.
Deviations from this structure include [[crabs]] and ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' embryos, with nine doublets, and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' [[sperm cells]] and early embryos, with nine singlets.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=15075224|year=2004|last1=Delattre|first1=M|last2=Gönczy|first2=P|title=The arithmetic of centrosome biogenesis|volume=117|issue=Pt 9|pages=1619–30|doi=10.1242/jcs.01128|journal=Journal of Cell Science}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=15665853|year=2005|last1=Leidel|first1=S|last2=Delattre|first2=M|last3=Cerutti|first3=L|last4=Baumer|first4=K|last5=Gönczy|first5=P|title=SAS-6 defines a protein family required for centrosome duplication in C.

==Ciliogenesis==
In organisms with [[flagella]] and [[cilia]], the position of these organelles is determined by the mother centriole, which becomes the [[basal body]].  An inability of cells to use centrioles to make functional cilia and flagella has been linked to a number of genetic and developmental diseases. In particular, the inability of centrioles to properly migrate prior to ciliary assembly has recently been linked to  [[Meckel-Gruber syndrome]].<ref name="meckel">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1242/dmm.006262|pmc=3008963|pmid=    21045211|year=2011|author=Cui, Cheng ; Chatterjee, Bishwanath ; Francis, Deanne ; Yu, Qing ; SanAgustin, Jovenal T. ; Francis, Richard ; Tansey, Terry ; Henry, Charisse ; Wang, Baolin ; Lemley, Bethan ; Pazour, Gregory J. ; Lo, Cecilia W.|title=Disruption of Mks1 localization to the mother centriole causes cilia defects and developmental malformations in Meckel-Gruber syndrome|volume=4|issue=1|pages=43–56|journal=Dis Model Mech|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3008963/}}</ref>

==Centriole duplication==
Cells in [[G0 phase|G<sub>0</sub>]] and [[G1 phase|G<sub>1</sub>]] usually contain two  complete centrioles. The older of the two centrioles in a pair is termed the ''mother centriole'', whereas the younger is termed the ''daughter centriole''. During the [[Cell cycle|cell division cycle]], a new centriole grows from the side of each of the existing "mother" centrioles. After centriole duplication, the two pairs of centrioles remain attached to each other in an [[orthogonal]] configuration until [[mitosis]], when the mother and daughter centrioles separate in a manner dependent upon the [[enzyme]] [[separase]].<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=16862117|year=2006|last1=Tsou|first1=MF|last2=Stearns|first2=T|title=Mechanism limiting centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle|volume=442|issue=7105|pages=947–51|doi=10.1038/nature04985|journal=Nature|bibcode = 2006Natur.442..947T }}</ref>

The two centrioles in the centrosome are connected to each other by unidentified proteins. The mother centriole has  radiating appendages at the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] end of its long axis and is attached to the daughter centriole at the other [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] end. Each daughter cell formed after cell division will inherit one of these pairs (one older and one newer centriole). Duplication of centrioles starts at the time of the [[G1/S transition|G<sub>1</sub>/S transition]] and ends before the onset of [[mitosis]].<ref name="Salisbury" />

==Origin==
The last common ancestor of all [[eukaryote]]s was a [[cilia]]ted cell with centrioles. Some lineages of eukaryotes, such as [[land plants]], do not have centrioles except in their motile male gametes. Centrioles are completely absent from all cells of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] and [[angiosperm|flowering plants]], which do not have ciliate or flagellate gametes.<ref>Marshall, W.F. (2009) Centriole Evolution. Current Opinion in Cell Biology 21(1), 14–19. doi:  10.1016/j.ceb.2009.01.008</ref>
It is unclear if the last common ancestor had one<ref name="Bornens07">{{cite doi|10.1007/978-0-387-74021-8_10}}</ref> or two cilia.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1093/gbe/evp011}}</ref> Important genes required for centriole growth, like [[centrins]], are only found in eukaryotes and not in [[bacteria]] or [[archaeans]].<ref name="Bornens07"/>
