In June 2009, the US National Public Radio (NPR), relying on information obtained from the CIA World Factbook, put the number of Israeli Jews living in settlements in the West Bank and Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem at 250,000. However, a better estimate, based on [[United States Department of State|State Department]] and Israeli sources put the figure at about 500,000. NPR then issued a correction. Chuck Holmes, foreign editor for NPR Digital, said, “I’m surprised and displeased, and it makes me wonder what other information is out-of-date or incorrect in the CIA World Factbook.”<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2010/06/01/127349281/cia-gets-the-numbers-wrong

Various demographic information is full of usually minor errors, inaccuracies, and out-of-date information, which are often repeated elsewhere due to the Factbook's widespread use as a reference. For example, [[Albania]] is described in the CIA Factbook as 70% Muslim, 20% Eastern Orthodox, and 10% Roman Catholic, which was based on a survey conducted in 1939, before World War II; numerous surveys conducted since the fall of the Communist regime since 1990 have given quite different figures. Another example is [[Singapore]], which the Factbook states has a [[total fertility rate]] of 0.78 children per woman, despite figures in Statistics Singapore which state that the rate has been about 1.2-1.3 children per woman for at least the past several years, and it is unclear when, or even whether, it ever dropped as low as 0.78.<ref>[http://www.singstat.gov.sg/statistics/latest_data.html#14]</ref> This extremely low and inaccurate value then gets cited in news articles which state that Singapore has the world's lowest fertility, or at least use the figure for its shock value.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sapere |first=Aude |url=http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/what-happens-when-half-the-world-stops-making-babies/573/ |title=What Happens When Half The World Stops Making Babies |publisher=The Global Mail |date=2013-03-12 |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>

Before 1998, the United Kingdom profile contained a sentence that asserted the UK had gained independence on 1 January 1801.<ref>{{cite web | author =  Directorate of Intelligence | title = The World Factbook - United Kingdom (mirror) |year= 1996 | url =  http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact96/258.htm | accessdate = September 23, 2006  }}</ref> This description in reference to the [[Act of Union 1801]] which expanded the United Kingdom of Great Britain to include Ireland, has since been greatly expanded,<ref name="uk">{{cite web | author =  Directorate of Intelligence | title = The World Factbook - United Kingdom |date= 2006-09-19 | url =  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uk.html | accessdate = 2006-09-23 }}</ref> although the primary date of UK Independence is now given as 1927. This has been argued by some as misleading, and refers to the date the entity adopted its current name under the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act]], of that year. Indeed it can be argued the country has no one year in which independence was achieved, since there is an arguable legitimate succession of states, systems and entities from the [[Norman Conquest]], 1066.
