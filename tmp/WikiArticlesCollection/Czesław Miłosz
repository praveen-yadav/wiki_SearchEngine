==Life in Europe==
[[Image:Andrzej Milosz and Czeslaw Milosz.jpg|thumb|right|Czesław Miłosz ''(right)'' with brother Andrzej Miłosz at [[PEN Club]] World Congress, Warsaw, May 1999]]
Czesław Miłosz was born on June 30, 1911 in the village of Szetejnie ({{lang-lt|[[Šeteniai]]}}), [[Kovno Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Kėdainiai district municipality|Kėdainiai district]], [[Kaunas County]], [[Lithuania]]) on the border between two Lithuanian historical regions, [[Samogitia]] and [[Aukštaitija]], in central Lithuania. As the son of Aleksander Miłosz (d.1959), a civil engineer, and Weronika, ''née'' Kunat (d.1945), descendant of the Siručiai noble family,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Miłosz was fluent in Polish, Lithuanian, Russian, English, and French.<ref>{{cite news|title= Czeslaw Milosz, Poet and Nobelist Who Wrote of Modern Cruelties, Dies at 93| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E5DC123FF936A2575BC0A9629C8B63| accessdate=March 17, 2008 | work=The New York Times | first=Raymond H. | last=Anderson | date=August 15, 2004}}</ref> His brother, [[Andrzej Miłosz]] (1917–2002), a Polish journalist, translator of literature and of film subtitles into Polish, was a documentary-film producer who created Polish documentaries about his brother.

Miłosz was raised [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] in rural Lithuania and emphasized his identity with the multi-ethnic [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], a stance that led to ongoing controversies. He refused to categorically identify himself as either a Pole or a Lithuanian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/czeslawmilosz.htm
|publisher= [[University of California]]|title=In Memoriam| quote=Miłosz would always place emphasis upon his identity as one of the last citizens of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, a place of competing and overlapping identities. This stance—not Polish enough for some, not Lithuanian to others—would give rise to controversies that have not ceased with his death in either country.|accessdate=2008-03-17}}</ref> He said of himself: "I am a Lithuanian to whom it was not given to be a Lithuanian.",<ref name=uc>{{lt icon}} {{cite web| title=Išėjus Česlovui Milošui, Lietuva neteko dalelės savęs| work=Mokslo Lietuva (Scientific Lithuania)| language=lt| url=http://www.lms.lt/ML/200415/20041501.htm| accessdate=October 16, 2007}}</ref> and "My family in the sixteenth century already spoke Polish, just as many families in Finland spoke Swedish and in Ireland English, so I am a Polish not a Lithuanian poet. But the landscapes and perhaps the spirits of Lithuania have never abandoned me".<ref>''Lost and found: the discovery of Lithuania in American fiction'' Aušra Paulauskienė  Rodopi 2007 page 24</ref> Miłosz memorialised his Lithuanian childhood in a 1955 novel, ''The Issa Valley'', and in the 1959 memoir ''Native Realm''.<ref>{{cite news|title=CZESLAW MILOSZ 1911-2004|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/08/15/MNGA988H5M1.DTL|accessdate=March 20, 2008 | first=Rona | last=Marech}}</ref> He employed a Lithuanian-language tutor late in life to improve the skills acquired in his childhood.

In his youth, Miłosz came to adopt, as he put it, a "scientific, atheistic position mostly", although he was later to return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Haven, Cynthia L., "'A Sacred Vision': An Interview with Czesław Miłosz", in Haven, Cynthia L. (ed.), ''Czesław Miłosz: Conversations''. University Press of Mississippi, 2006, p. 145.</ref> After graduation from [[Sigismund Augustus]] ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' in [[Vilnius]], he studied law at [[Vilnius University|Stefan Batory University]] and in 1931 he travelled to Paris, where he was influenced by his distant cousin [[Oscar Milosz]], a French poet of Lithuanian descent and a [[Swedenborgian]]. In 1931, he formed the poetic group Żagary together with the young poets Jerzy Zagórski, Teodor Bujnicki, Aleksander Rymkiewicz, Jerzy Putrament and Józef Maśliński.<ref>''Between Anxiety and Hope: The Poetry and Writing of Czeslaw Milosz'' by Edward Możejko. University of Alberta Press, 1988. pp 2f.</ref> Miłosz's first volume of poetry was published in 1934. After receiving his law degree that year, he again spent a year in Paris on a fellowship. Upon returning, he worked as a commentator at Radio Wilno, but was dismissed, an action described as stemming from either his leftist views or for views overly sympathetic to Lithuania.<ref name=uc/><ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[The Economist]]|url=http://www.economist.com/node/3104407|date=2004-08-14|title=Czeslaw Milosz, a Polish émigré poet, died on August 14th, aged 93|accessdate=2011-04-06|quote=In pre-war Poland Mr Milosz felt stifled by the prevailing Catholic-nationalist ethos; he was sacked from a Polish radio station for being too pro-Lithuanian.}}</ref> Miłosz wrote all his poetry, fiction and essays in Polish and translated the Old Testament ''[[Psalms]]'' into Polish. 

Miłosz spent World War II in [[Warsaw]], under Nazi Germany's "[[General Government]]". Here he attended [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground lectures]] by Polish philosopher and historian of philosophy and [[aesthetics]], [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]]. He did not participate in the [[Warsaw Uprising]], which has been attributed to his residence outside Warsaw proper.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} According to Irena Grudzińska-Gross, he saw the uprising as a "doomed military effort" and lacked "patriotic elation".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aseees.org/newsnet/2012-08.pdf|title=The Year of Czesław Miłosz|date=August 2012|publisher=[[Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies]]}}</ref>

After World War II, Miłosz served as cultural attaché of the newly formed [[People's Republic of Poland]] in [[Paris]] and Washington D.C. For this he was criticized in some emigre circles. Conversely, he was attacked and censored in Poland when, in 1951, he defected and obtained political asylum in France. In 1953 he received the Prix Littéraire Européen (European Literary Prize).

==Life in the United States==
[[File:Czeslaw Milosz 1998 by Kubik.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Czesław Miłosz 1998]] 
In 1960 Miłosz emigrated to the United States, and in 1970 he became a U.S. citizen. In 1961 he began a professorship in Polish literature in the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. In 1978 he received the [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]]. He retired that same year, but continued teaching at Berkeley. Milosz' personal attitude about living in Berkeley is sensitively portrayed in his poem, "A Magic Mountain," contained in a collection of translated poems entitled, ''Bells in Winter'', published by Ecco Press (1985). Having grown up in the cold climates of Eastern Europe, Milosz was especially struck by the lack of seasonal weather in Berkeley and by some of the brilliant refugees from around the world who became his friends at the university.

In 1980 Miłosz received the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. Since his works had been banned in Poland by the communist government, this was the first time that many Poles became aware of him.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} When the [[Iron Curtain]] fell, Miłosz was able to return to Poland, at first to visit, and later to live part-time in [[Kraków]]. He divided his time between his home in Berkeley and an apartment in Kraków. In 1989, he received the U.S. [[National Medal of Arts]] and an honorary doctorate from [[Harvard University]].

Miłosz's 1953 book, ''[[The Captive Mind]]'', is a study about how [[intellectuals]] behave under a repressive regime. Miłosz observed that those who became [[dissident]]s were not necessarily those with the strongest minds, but rather those with the weakest stomachs; the mind can rationalize anything, he said, but the stomach can take only so much. Throughout the [[Cold War]], the book often was cited by U.S. conservative commentators such as [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], and has been a staple in political science courses on [[totalitarianism]].

In an 1994 interview, Miłosz spoke of the difficulty of writing religious poetry in a largely post-religious world. He reported a recent conversation with his compatriot [[Pope John Paul II]]; the latter, commenting upon some of Miłosz's work, in particular ''Six Lectures in Verse'', said to him: "You make one step forward, one step back." The poet answered: "Holy Father, how in the twentieth century can one write religious poetry differently?" The Pope smiled.<ref>[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1721/the-art-of-poetry-no-70-czeslaw-milosz "Czesław Miłosz Interviewed by Robert Faggen"], ''The Paris Review'' No. 133 (Winter 1994).</ref> A few years later, in 2000, Miłosz dedicated a rather straightforward ode to John Paul II, on the occasion of the pope's eightieth birthday.<ref>Andreas Dorschel, 'Es ist eine Lust zu beichten', ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' nr. 192 (20 August 2004), p. 14.</ref>

==Death and legacy==
Czesław Miłosz died on 14 August 2004 at his Kraków home, aged 93. He was buried in [[Kraków]]'s [[Skałka|Skałka Roman Catholic Church]], becoming one of the last to be commemorated there.<ref>[http://www.miloszinstitute.com/funeralphotos.html Photos from Milosz's funeral in Krakow]</ref> Protesters threatened to disrupt the proceedings on the grounds that he was anti-Polish, anti-Catholic, and had signed a petition supporting gay and lesbian freedom of speech and assembly.<ref name=protest>{{cite web|url=http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/webexclusives/2004/september/040907.html|title=The Poet Who Remembered - Poland (mostly) honors Czeslaw Milosz upon his death|author=Agnieszka Tennant|publisher=booksandculture.com}}</ref> Pope [[John Paul II]], along with Milosz's confessor, issued public messages to the effect that Milosz had been receiving the sacraments, which quelled the protest.<ref name="Grudzińska-Gross2009">{{cite book|author=Irena Grudzińska-Gross|title=Czeslaw Milosz and Joseph Brodsky|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tCLo63-ypkkC&pg=PA289|accessdate=18 September 2013|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-14937-1|page=289}}</ref> His first wife, Janina (née Dłuska), whom he had married in 1944, had died in 1986. They had two sons, Anthony (b. 1947) and John Peter (b. 1951). His second wife, Carol Thigpen, an American-born historian, died in 2002.

Miłosz is honoured at Israel's [[Yad Vashem]] memorial to the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], as one of the "[[Righteous among the Nations]]". A poem by Miłosz appears on a [[Gdańsk]] [[Monument to the Fallen Shipyard Workers of 1970|memorial to protesting shipyard workers]] who had been killed by government security forces in 1970. His books and poems have been translated by many hands, including Jane Zielonko, [[Peter Dale Scott]], [[Robert Pinsky]], and [[Robert Hass]].

In November 2011, Yale University hosted a conference on Miłosz's relationship with America.<ref>[http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/milosz/ conference on Miłosz and America]</ref> The [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]], which holds the Czesław Miłosz Papers,<ref>[http://hdl.handle.net/10079/bibid/4254889 Czesław Miłosz Papers]</ref> also hosted an exhibition celebrating Miłosz's life and work, entitled ''Exile as Destiny: Czeslaw Milosz and America''. 2011 was deemed "The Milosz Year," which culminated in a large conference in Kraków (May 9–15, 2011).
