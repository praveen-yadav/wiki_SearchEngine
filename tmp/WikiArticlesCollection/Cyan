The [[web colors|web color]] cyan is synonymous with [[aqua (color)|aqua]].  In most languages, 'cyan' is not a basic [[color term]] and it [[phenomenology|phenomenologically]] appears as a greenish vibrant [[hue]] of blue to most English speakers. Reasons for why cyan is not linguistically acknowledged as a basic color term can be found in the frequent lack of [[distinction of blue and green in various languages|distinction between blue and green]] in many languages. Some varieties in the cyan color range are [[teal (color)|teal]], [[turquoise (color)|turquoise]], [[electric blue (color)|electric blue]], [[aquamarine (color)|aquamarine]], and other colors described as [[blue-green]].

In the [[CMYK color model]], used in color printing, cyan is one of the [[primary colors]], along with [[magenta]], [[yellow]], and [[black]], which can be overlaid to produce all different colors. In the [[additive color]] system, or [[RGB color model]], used to create all the colors on a computer or television display, cyan is made by mixing equal amounts of [[green]] and [[blue]] [[light]]. Since it is the [[complementary color|complement]] of [[red]], it can also be made by the removal of red from white light. Mixing red light and cyan light at the right intensity on a black screen will make [[white]]. Cyan light has a wavelength of between 490 and 520 nanometers, between the wavelengths of blue and green.<ref>[http://physics.about.com/od/lightoptics/a/vislightspec.htm About.com - Physics] About.Com - Physics (Retrieved 6-18-2013)</ref>

==Cyan on the web and in printing==

===The web colors cyan and aqua===

The [[web color]] cyan shown at right is a secondary color in the [[RGB color model]], which uses combinations of red, green and blue light to create all the colors on computer and television displays.  In [[X11 colors]], this color is called both cyan and [[aqua (color)|aqua]].  In the HTML color list, this same color is called [[aqua (color)|aqua]].

The [[web colors]] are more vivid than the cyan used in the [[CMYK]] color system, and the web colors cannot be accurately reproduced on a printed page. To reproduce the web color cyan in inks, it is necessary to add some white ink to the printer's cyan below, so when it is reproduced in printing, it is not a primary subtractive color. It is called ''aqua'' (a name in use since 1598) because it is a color commonly associated with [[water]], such as the appearance of the water at a tropical beach.<ref>Maerz and Paul ''The Dictionary of Color'' 1930 (see under Aqua in Index, page 189)</ref>

Cyan is also one of the common inks used in [[four-color printing]], along with [[magenta]], [[yellow]], and [[black]]; this set of colors is referred to as CMYK as in spectrum(s).

While both the additive secondary and the subtractive primary are called ''cyan'', they can be substantially different from one another. Cyan printing ink can be more saturated or less saturated than the RGB secondary cyan, depending on what [[RGB color space]] and ink are considered.

Process cyan is not an RGB color, and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are used for printer's ink, so there can be variations in the printed color that is pure cyan ink. A typical formulation of ''process cyan'' is shown in the color box at right.

==In science and nature==

===The color of water===
*Pure water is nearly colorless. However, it does [[water absorption|absorb]] slightly more red light than blue, giving large volumes of water a bluish tint; increased scattering of blue light due to fine particles in the water shifts the blue color toward green, for a typically cyan net color.<ref>{{cite book|title = Clouds in a Glass of Beer: Simple Experiments in Atmospheric Physics|author = Craig F.

===Cyan and cyanide===
*[[Cyanide]] derives its name from [[Prussian blue]], a blue pigment containing the cyanide ion.

===Bacteria===
*[[Cyanobacteria]] (sometimes called blue-green algae) are an important link in the [[food chain]].

===Astronomy===
*The [[planet]] [[Uranus]] is colored cyan because of the abundance of [[methane]] in its [[atmosphere]].

===Energy===
*[[Natural gas]] (methane), used by many for [[home cooking]] on [[gas stove]]s, has a cyan colored [[flame]] when burned with a mixture of air.

===Photography and film===

*[[Cyanotype]], or [[blueprint]], a [[monochrome]] [[List of photographic processes|photographic printing process]] that predates the use of the word ''cyan'' as a color, yields a deep ''cyan-blue'' colored print based on the Prussian blue pigment.<ref>{{cite book|title = Cyanotype: the history, science and art of photographic printing in Prussian blue|author = Mike Ware|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=C-7I69gFIbMC&pg=PA21&ots=alsMw9t0Kr&dq=cyanotype+prussian-blue+color&sig=s12O6C39teka_vg41EDxbflKMI4#PPA40,M1|publisher = NMSI Trading Ltd|year = 1999|isbn = 1-900747-07-3}}</ref>

*[[Cinecolor]], a bi-pack color process, the photographer would load a standard camera with two films, one orthochromatic, dyed red, and a panchromatic strip behind it. Color light would expose the cyan record on the ortho stock, which also acted as a filter, exposing only red light to the panchromatic film stock.

===Medicine===
*[[Cyanosis]] is an abnormal blueness of the skin, usually a sign of poor oxygen intake. i.e. the patient is "cyanotic".
*Cyan is associated with the [[throat chakra]] in vedic medicine.

=== Why surgeons wear cyan gowns ===
*In the 19th century, surgeons wore white gowns, but in the 20th century surgeons began to wear cyan or green surgical gowns, for several reasons. First, in the brightly-lit operating room, green reflected less light than white and caused less strain on the eyes of the medical team.  Second, cyan is the [[complementary color]] of red, so red blood on a cyan gown looks black or gray, and not red, and is not as vivid. Also, since red and green are complementary colors, shifting your sight to green after staring at red for long periods of time does not cause green after-images, as shifting from red to white will do. Lastly, since green is considered one of the most restful and soothing colors, it causes less anxiety to patients.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/AZRareDisease/posts/574569069231930] Facebook page of Central Arizona Rare Disease Support</ref>

==In human culture==

===Architecture===
*Cyan colored [[tile]]s are often used to pave [[swimming pool]]s to make the water within them seem more intensely colored, and therefore more inviting.

===Music===
*[[Cyan (band)|Cyan]] was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[progressive rock]] band from the 1980s and 1990s.
