{{Cannon}}

A '''cannon''' is any piece of [[artillery]] that uses [[gunpowder]] or other usually explosive-based propellants to launch a projectile. Cannon vary in [[calibre]], range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire, and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield. The word ''cannon'' is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as ''tube'', ''cane'', or ''reed''. In the modern era, the term ''cannon'' has fallen into decline, replaced by "guns" or "artillery" if not a more specific term such as "mortar" or "howitzer", except for in the field of [[aerial warfare]], where it is usually shorthand for [[autocannon]].

[[Technology of the Song Dynasty#Gunpowder warfare|First invented in China]], cannon were among the earliest forms of gunpowder artillery, and over time replaced [[siege engine]]s—among other forms of ageing weaponry—on the battlefield. In the Middle East, the first use of the [[hand cannon]] is argued to be during the 1260 [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] between the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] and [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]. The [[Cannon in the Middle Ages#Spread to Europe|first cannon in Europe]] were probably used in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] in the 11th and 12th centuries, and [[English cannon]] were first deployed in the [[Hundred Years' War]], at the [[Battle of Crécy]], in 1346.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} On the [[Africa|African continent]], the cannon was first used by the [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Imam]] [[Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi]] of the [[Adal Sultanate]] in his [[Ethiopian-Adal War|conquest]] of the steppes of Ugaden in 1529.<ref name="Local History in Ethiopia">[http://www.nai.uu.se/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/A/ORTAST05.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"]{{Failed verification|date=January 2012}} (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 28 January 2008)</ref> It was during this period, the [[Middle Ages]], that cannon became standardized, and more effective in both the anti-infantry and siege roles. After the Middle Ages most large cannon were abandoned in favour of greater numbers of lighter, more manoeuvrable pieces. In addition, new technologies and tactics were developed, making most defences obsolete; this led to the construction of [[star fort]]s, specifically designed to withstand artillery bombardment though these too (along with the [[Martello Tower]]) would find themselves rendered obsolete when explosive and [[armour]] piercing rounds made even these types of fortifications vulnerable.

Cannon also transformed [[naval warfare]] in the [[early modern period]], as European navies took advantage of their firepower. As [[rifling]] became commonplace, the accuracy and destructive power of cannon was significantly increased, and they became deadlier than ever, both to infantry who belatedly had to adopt different tactics, and to ships, which had to be armoured. In [[World War I]], the majority of combat fatalities were caused by artillery; they were also used widely in [[World War II]]. Most modern cannon are similar to those used in the Second World War, although the importance of the larger calibre weapons has declined with the development of [[missile]]s.

''Cannon'' is derived from the [[Old Italian]] word ''cannone'', meaning "large tube", which came from [[Latin]] ''canna'', in turn originating from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κάννα (''kanna''), "reed",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dka%2Fnna1 κάννα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> and then generalized to mean any hollow tube-like object; cognate with [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] term ''qanu'' and  [[Hebrew]] ''qāneh'', meaning "tube" or "reed".<ref name="Definition and etymology of cannon">{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Cannon|title=Definition and etymology of "cannon"|publisher=[[Webster's Dictionary]]|accessdate=26 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cane|title=Etymology of "Cane"|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=26 May 2008}}</ref><ref name="Definition and etymology of cane">{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cane|title=Definition and etymology of "cane"|publisher=[[Webster's Dictionary]]|accessdate=26 May 2008}}</ref> The word has been used to refer to a [[Gun#Terminology|gun]] since 1326 in Italy, and 1418 in England.

==Cannon materials, parts, and terms==
[[Image:Cannon-diagram.jpg|thumb|Side elevation of a typical 19th-century cannon. Negative spaces such as the "bore" are labelled in white text outlined in black; all other text in black only.]]
Cannon in general have the form of a truncated cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an [[explosive charge]] and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its [[recoil]] and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.  

Field artillery cannon in Europe and the Americas were initially made most often of [[bronze]], though later forms were constructed of [[cast iron]] and eventually [[steel]].<ref name=kingsbury>{{Cite book |title=An elementary treatise on artillery and infantry |last=Kingsbury |first=Charles P. |authorlink= |last2= |first2= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |edition= |volume= |year=1849 |origyear= |page= |pages= |publisher=GP Putnam |place=New York |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z9xVAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22cannon%22%20bronze%20iron&pg=PA59#v=onepage&q=windage&f=false |accessdate= |isbn= |oclc=761213440 }}</ref>{{rp|61}} Bronze has several characteristics that made it preferable as a construction material: although it is relatively expensive, does not always alloy well, and can result in a final product that is "spongy about the bore",<ref name=kingsbury/>{{rp|61}} bronze is more flexible than iron and therefore less prone to bursting when exposed to high pressure; cast iron cannon are less expensive and more durable generally than bronze and withstand being fired more times without deteriorating. However, cast iron cannon have a tendency to burst without having shown any previous weakness or wear, and this makes them more dangerous to operate.

The older and more-stable forms of cannon were [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] as opposed to [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]]— in order to be used they had to have their ordnance packed down the bore through the muzzle rather than inserted through the breech.

The following terms refer to the components or aspects of a classical western cannon (c. 1850) as illustrated here.<ref name=kingsbury/>{{rp|66}}   In what follows, the words ''near'', ''close'', and ''behind'' will refer to those parts towards the thick, closed end of the piece, and ''far'', ''front'', ''in front of'', and ''before'' to the thinner, open end.

===Negative spaces===
* '''Bore''': The hollow cylinder bored down the centre of the cannon, including the ''base of the bore'' or ''bottom of the bore'', the nearest end of the bore into which the [[Artillery|ordnance]] ([[wadding]], [[Round shot|shot]], etc.) gets packed. The diameter of the bore represents the cannon's [[calibre]].
* '''Chamber''': The cylindrical, conical, or spherical recess at the nearest end of the bottom of the bore into which the [[gunpowder]] is packed.
* '''Vent''': A thin tube on the near end of the cannon connecting the explosive charge inside with an ignition source outside and often filled with a length of [[fuse (explosives)|fuse]]; always located near the ''breech''. Sometimes called the ''fuse hole'' or the ''touch hole''. On the top of the vent on the outside of the cannon is a flat circular space called the ''vent field'' where the charge is lit. If the cannon is bronze, it will often have a ''vent piece'' made of copper screwed into the length of the vent.

===Solid spaces===
The main body of a cannon consists of three basic extensions— the foremost and the longest is called the ''chase'', the middle portion is the ''reinforce'', and the closest and briefest portion is the ''[[cascabel (artillery)|cascabel]]'' or ''cascable''.
* '''The chase:''' Simply the entire conical part of the cannon in front of the ''reinforce''. It is the longest portion of the cannon, and includes the following elements:
** The ''neck'': the narrowest part of the chase, always located near the foremost end of the piece.
** The ''[[Muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]'': the portion of the chase forward of the ''neck''. It includes the following:
*** The ''swell of the muzzle'' refers to the slight swell in the diameter of the piece at the very end of the chase. It is often chamfered on the inside to make loading the cannon easier. In some guns, this element is replaced with a wide ring and is called a ''muzzle band''.
*** The ''face'' is the flat vertical plane at the foremost edge of the muzzle (and of the entire piece).
*** The ''muzzle mouldings'' are the tiered rings which connect the face with the rest of the muzzle, the first of which is called the ''lip'' and the second the ''fillet''
*** The ''muzzle [[astragal]] and fillets'' are a series of three narrow rings running around the outside of the chase just behind the neck. Sometimes also collectively called the ''chase ring''.
** The ''chase astragal and fillets'': these are a second series of such rings located at the near end of the chase.
** The ''chase girdle'': this is the brief length of the chase between the chase astragal and fillets and the ''reinforce''.
* '''The reinforce:'''  This portion of the piece is frequently divided into a ''first reinforce'' and a ''second reinforce'', but in any case is marked as separate from the chase by the presence of a narrow circular ''reinforce ring'' or ''band'' at its foremost end. The span of the reinforce also includes the following:
** The ''[[trunnions]]'' are located at the foremost end of the reinforce just behind the reinforce ring. They consist of two cylinders perpendicular to the bore and below it which are used to mount the cannon on its carriage. 
** The ''rimbases'' are short broad rings located at the union of the trunnions and the cannon which provide support to the carriage attachment.
** The ''reinforce band'' is only present if the cannon has two reinforces, and it divides the first reinforce from the second.
** The ''breech'' refers to the mass of solid metal behind the bottom of the bore extending to the ''base of the breech'' and including the ''base ring''; it also generally refers to the end of the cannon opposite the ''muzzle'', i.e., the location where the explosion of the gunpowder begins as opposed to the opening through which the pressurized gas escapes.
** The ''base ring'' forms a ring at the widest part of the entire cannon at the nearest end of the reinforce just before the ''cascable''.
* The '''cascable:''' This is that portion of the cannon behind the reinforce(s) and behind the ''base ring''. It includes the following:
** The ''knob'' which is the small spherical terminus of the piece;
** The ''neck'', a short, narrow piece of metal holding out the knob; and
** The ''fillet'', the tiered disk connecting the neck of the cascable to the ''base of the breech''.
** The ''base of the breech'' is the metal disk that forms the most forward part of the cascable and rests against the breech itself, right next to the ''base ring''.

To pack a muzzle-loading cannon, first gunpowder is poured down the bore. This is followed by a layer of wadding (often nothing more than paper), and then the cannonball itself. A certain amount of [[windage]] allows the ball to fit down the bore, though the greater the windage the less efficient the propulsion of the ball when the gunpowder is ignited. To fire the cannon, the fuse located in the vent is lit, quickly burning down to the gunpowder, which then explodes violently, propelling wadding and ball down the bore and out of the muzzle. A small portion of exploding gas also escapes through the vent, but this does not dramatically affect the total force exerted on the ball.

Any large, [[smoothbore]], [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] [[gun]]—used before the advent of [[breech-loading]], [[rifled]] guns—may be referred to as a cannon, though once standardized names were assigned to different sized cannon, the term specifically referred to a gun designed to fire a {{convert|42|lb|sing=on}} shot, as opposed to a [[demi-cannon]] - {{convert|32|lb}}, [[culverin]] - {{convert|18|lb}}, or [[demi-culverin]] - {{convert|9|lb}}.

The first metal cannon was the ''[[pot-de-fer]]''.

By the 16th century, cannon were made in a great variety of lengths and bore diameters, but the general rule was that the longer the barrel, the longer the range. Some cannon made during this time had barrels exceeding {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length, and could weigh up to {{convert|20000|lb|kg}}. Consequently, large amounts of gunpowder were needed, to allow them to fire stone balls several hundred yards.<ref>{{cite book|last=Krebs|first=Robert E.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2004|title=Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance|isbn=0-313-32433-6|page=270|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MTXdplfiz-cC&printsec=frontcover#PPA270,M1}}</ref> By mid-century, European monarchs began to classify cannon to reduce the confusion.

The end of the Middle Ages saw the construction of larger, more powerful cannon, as well their spread throughout the world. As they were not effective at breaching the newer fortifications resulting from the development of cannon, [[siege engine]]s—such as [[siege tower]]s and [[trebuchet]]s—became less widely used. However, wooden "battery-towers" took on a similar role as siege towers in the [[gunpowder]] age—such as that used at [[Siege of Kazan (1552)|siege of Kazan]] in 1552, which could hold ten large-calibre cannon, in addition to 50 lighter pieces.<ref name="Kazan">{{cite book|last=Nossov|first=Konstantin|pages=53–55|title=Russian Fortresses, 1480–1682|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|year=2006|isbn=1-84176-916-9}}</ref> Another notable effect of cannon on warfare during this period was the change in conventional fortifications.

These new defences became known as "[[star fort]]s", after their characteristic shape which attempted to force any advance toward it directly into the firing line of the guns.<ref name="Castles"/> A few of these featured [[Artillery battery|cannon batteries]], such as the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudors]]' [[Device Forts]], in England.<ref name="Castles"/> Star forts soon replaced castles in Europe, and, eventually, those in the Americas, as well.<ref name="SpanishMain">{{cite book|last=Chartrand|first=René|title=Spanish Main: 1492–1800|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|isbn=1-84603-005-6|year=2006|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cvcBWivXlekC&printsec=frontcover}}</ref>

By the end of the 15th century, several technological advancements made cannon more mobile. Wheeled gun carriages and [[trunnion]]s became common, and the invention of the [[Limbers and caissons (military)|limber]] further facilitated transportation.<ref name="Manucy, p. 5">Manucy, p. 5.</ref> As a result, [[field artillery]] became more viable, and began to see more widespread use, often alongside the larger cannon intended for sieges.<ref name="Manucy, p. 5"/><ref name="Sadler">{{cite book|title=Flodden 1513: Scotland's Greatest Defeat |last=Sadler |first=John |isbn=978-1-84176-959-2 |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |year=2006 |pages=22–23 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ZXX1SrxKTg0C&printsec=frontcover#PPA23,M1}}</ref> Better gunpowder, cast-iron projectiles (replacing stone), and the standardization of calibres meant that even relatively light cannon could be deadly.<ref name="Manucy, p. 5"/> In ''[[The Art of War (Machiavelli)|The Art of War]]'', [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] observed that "It is true that the [[arquebus]]es and the small artillery do much more harm than the heavy artillery."<ref name="The Art of War (Machiavelli)">{{cite book|first=Niccolò|last=Machiavelli|title=The Art of War|isbn=0-226-50046-2|page=74|year=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Ill.|authorlink3=Niccolò Machiavelli}}</ref> This was the case at [[Battle of Flodden Field|Flodden]], in 1513: the English [[field gun]]s outfired the Scottish siege artillery, firing two or three times as many rounds.<ref>Sadler, p. 60.</ref> Despite the increased maneuverability, however, cannon were still the slowest component of the army: a heavy [[English cannon]] required 23 horses to transport, while a [[culverin]] needed nine. Even with this many animals pulling, they still moved at a walking pace. Due to their relatively slow speed, and lack of organization, and undeveloped tactics, the combination of [[pike and shot]] still dominated the battlefields of Europe.<ref>Manucy, p. 6.</ref>

Innovations continued, notably the German invention of the [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]], a thick-walled, short-barrelled gun that blasted shot upward at a steep angle. Mortars were useful for sieges, as they could hit targets behind walls or other defences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9053839/mortar|title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online - Mortar|accessdate=13 March 2008}}</ref> This cannon found more use with the Dutch, who learned to shoot bombs filled with powder from them. Setting the bomb fuse was a problem. "Single firing" was first used to ignite the fuse, where the bomb was placed with the fuse down against the cannon's propellant. This often resulted in the fuse being blown into the bomb, causing it to blow up as it left the mortar. Because of this, "double firing" was tried where the gunner lit the fuse and then the [[touch hole]]. This, however, required considerable skill and timing, and was especially dangerous if the gun misfired, leaving a lighted bomb in the barrel. Not until 1650 was it accidentally discovered that double-lighting was superfluous as the heat of firing would light the fuse.<ref>Tunis, p. 90.</ref>

[[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] emphasized the use of light cannon and mobility in his army, and created new formations and tactics that revolutionized artillery. He discontinued using all 12&nbsp;pounder—or heavier—cannon as field artillery, preferring, instead, to use cannon that could be manned by only a few men. One obsolete type of gun, the "leatheren" was replaced by 4&nbsp;pounder and 9&nbsp;pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. These could be operated by three men, and pulled by only two horses. Adolphus's army was also the first to use a cartridge that contained both powder and shot which sped up reloading, increasing the rate of fire.<ref>Manucy, pp. 7–8.</ref> Finally, against infantry he pioneered the use of [[canister shot]] - essentially a tin can filled with musket balls.<ref>Tunis, p. 96.</ref> Until then there was no more than one cannon for every thousand infantrymen on the battlefield but Gustavus Adolphus increased the number of cannon sixfold. Each regiment was assigned two pieces, though he often arranged then into [[Artillery battery|batteries]] instead of distributing them piecemeal. He used these batteries to break his opponent's infantry line, while his cavalry would [[flanking|outflank]] their heavy guns.<ref>Manucy, p. 8.</ref>

At the [[Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)|Battle of Breitenfeld]], in 1631, Adolphus proved the effectiveness of the changes made to his army, by defeating [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]]. Although severely outnumbered, the Swedes were able to fire between three and five times as many volleys of artillery, and their infantry's [[line (formation)|linear]] formations helped ensure they didn't lose any ground. Battered by cannon fire, and low on morale, Tilly's men broke ranks and fled.<ref>{{cite book|first=Archer|last=Jones|title=The Art of War in the Western World|location=New York City|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|year=2001|isbn=0-252-06966-8|page=235|url=http://books.google.com/?id=z2FRzcz2W0oC&printsec=frontcover#PPA235,M1}}</ref>

[[Image:Fortbourtange.jpg|thumb|right||[[Bourtange (fort)|Fort Bourtange]], a [[star fort]], was built with angles and sloped walls specifically to defend against cannon.]]
Around this time also came the idea of aiming the cannon to hit a target. Gunners controlled the range of their cannon by measuring the angle of elevation, using a "gunner's [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]." Cannon did not have [[Sight (device)|sights]], therefore, even with measuring tools, aiming was still largely guesswork.<ref>Tunis, p. 97.</ref>

In the latter half of the 17th century, the French engineer [[Vauban]] introduced a more systematic and scientific approach to attacking gunpowder fortresses, in a time when many field commanders "were notorious dunces in siegecraft."<ref name="Griffith">{{cite book|last=Griffith|first=Paddy|title=The Vauban Fortifications of France|url=http://books.google.com/?id=eH1NtNGWQZ8C&printsec=frontcover|year=2006|page=5|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-84176-875-5}}</ref> Careful [[sapping]] forward, supported by [[enfilading]] [[ricochet fire]], was a key feature of this system, and it even allowed Vauban to calculate the length of time a siege would take.<ref name="Griffith"/> He was also a prolific builder of star forts, and did much to popularize the idea of "depth in defence" in the face of cannon.<ref>Griffith, p 29</ref> These principles were followed into the mid-19th century, when changes in armaments necessitated greater depth defence than Vauban had provided for. It was only in the years prior to [[World War I]] that new works began to break radically away from his designs.<ref>Griffith, pp. 56–57.</ref>

The practice of [[rifling]]—casting spiralling lines inside the cannon's barrel—was applied to artillery more frequently by 1855, as it gave cannon projectiles [[Gyroscope|gyroscopic]] stability, which improved their accuracy. One of the earliest rifled cannon was the [[breech loading|breech-loading]] [[Armstrong Gun]]—also invented by [[William George Armstrong]]—which boasted significantly improved range, accuracy, and power than earlier weapons. The projectile fired from the Armstrong gun could reportedly pierce through a ship's side, and explode inside the enemy vessel, causing increased damage, and casualties.<ref>{{cite journal|title=All the Year Round: A Weekly Journal|accessdate=26 May 2008|date=22 April 1859|last=Dickens|first=Charles|url=http://books.google.com/?id=o-4RAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage#PPA373,M1|pages=373|publisher=Charles Dickens|authorlink3=[[Charles Dickens]]}}</ref> The British military adopted the Armstrong gun, and was impressed; the [[Duke of Cambridge]] even declared that it "could do everything but speak."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6ybDCEqsWrUC&printsec=frontcover#PPA59,M1|page=59|title=Arms and the State: Sir William Armstrong and the Remaking of British Naval Power, 1854–1914|last=Bastable|first=Marshall J.|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0-7546-3404-3|accessdate=26 May 2008}}</ref> Despite being significantly more advanced than its predecessors, the Armstrong gun was rejected soon after its integration, in favour of the muzzle-loading pieces that had been in use before.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ruffell|first=W.

The superior cannon of the [[Western world]] brought them tremendous advantages in warfare. For example, in the [[Opium War]] in China, during the 19th century, British battleships bombarded the coastal areas and fortifications from afar, safe from the reach of the Chinese cannon. Similarly, the shortest war in recorded history, the [[Anglo-Zanzibar War]] of 1896, was brought to a swift conclusion by shelling from British battleships.<ref>{{cite book|last=Young|first=Mark C.|title=Guinness Book of World Records, 2002 edition|page=112|publisher=[[Bantam Books]]|isbn=0-553-58378-6|year=2002}}</ref> The cynical attitude toward recruited infantry in the face of ever more powerful field artillery is the source of the term ''[[cannon fodder]]'', first used by [[François-René de Chateaubriand]], in 1814;<ref>{{fr icon}} [[:wikisource:fr:De Buonaparte et des Bourbons|"De Buonaparte et des Bourbons"]] – full text in the French [[Wikisource]].</ref> however, the concept of regarding soldiers as nothing more than "food for powder" was mentioned by [[William Shakespeare]] as early as 1598, in [[Henry IV, Part 1]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Shakespeare|first=William|title=Henry IV, Part 1|year=1598}} Part 1, act 4, sc. 2, l. 65-7.</ref>

Cannon in the 20th and 21st centuries are usually divided into sub-categories and given separate names. Some of the most widely used types of modern cannon are [[howitzer]]s, [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]], [[gun]]s, and [[autocannon]], although a few [[supergun]]s—extremely large, custom-designed cannon—have also been constructed. [[Nuclear artillery]] was experimented with, but was abandoned as impractical.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nuclear artillery|url=http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/films/film.aspx?ID=1|accessdate=26 May 2008|publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]]}}</ref> Modern artillery is used in a variety of roles, depending on its type. According to [[NATO]], the general role of artillery is to provide fire support, which is defined as "the application of fire, coordinated with the manoeuvre of forces to destroy, neutralize, or suppress the enemy."<ref>{{cite book|title=AAP-6 NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions|year=2007|publisher=[[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]|accessdate=26 May 2008|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/stanag/aap006/aap-6-2007.pdf|format=PDF|page=113}}</ref>

When referring to cannon, the term ''gun'' is often used incorrectly. In military usage, a gun is a cannon with a high muzzle velocity and a [[indirect fire|flat trajectory]], useful for hitting the sides of targets such as walls,<ref name = "mutuur"/> as opposed to howitzers or mortars, which have lower muzzle velocities, and fire [[indirect fire|indirectly]], lobbing shells up and over obstacles to hit the target from above.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Howitzer|title=Definition of "Howitzer"|accessdate=26 May 2008|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Mortar|title=Definition of "Mortar"|accessdate=26 May 2008|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]]}}</ref>

By the early 20th century, [[infantry weapon]]s had become more powerful, forcing most artillery away from the front lines. Despite the change to [[indirect fire]], cannon proved highly effective during [[World War I]], directly or indirectly causing over 75% of casualties.<ref>Manucy, p. 20.</ref> The onset of [[trench warfare]] after the first few months of World War I greatly increased the demand for howitzers, as they were more suited at hitting targets in trenches. Furthermore, their shells carried more explosives than those of guns, and caused considerably less barrel wear. The German army had the advantage here as they began the war with many more howitzers than the French.<ref>{{cite book|first=Bruce I.|last=Gudmundsson|title=On Artillery|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=0-275-94047-0|year=1993|url=http://books.google.com/?id=O_-0w2WUDd0C&printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1|page=43}}</ref> World War I also saw the use of the [[Paris Gun]], the longest-ranged gun ever fired.

The [[World War II|Second World War]] sparked new developments in cannon technology. Among them were [[sabot|sabot rounds]], hollow-charge projectiles, and [[proximity fuse]]s, all of which increased the effectiveness of cannon against specific target.<ref>{{cite book|last=McCamley|first=Nicholas J.|title=Disasters Underground|publisher=Pen & Sword Military|year=2004|isbn=1-84415-022-4}}</ref> The proximity fuse emerged on the battlefields of Europe in late December 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq96-1.htm|title=Radio Proximity (VT) Fuzes|accessdate=26 May 2008|date=20 March 2000}}</ref> Used to great effect in [[anti-aircraft]] projectiles, proximity fuses were fielded in both the [[European Theater of Operations|European]] and [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific]] Theatres of Operations; they were particularly useful against [[V-1 flying bomb]]s and [[kamikaze]] planes. Although widely used in naval warfare, and in anti-air guns, both the British and Americans feared unexploded proximity fuses would be reverse engineered leading to them limiting its use in continental battles. During the [[Battle of the Bulge]], however, the fuses became known as the American artillery's "Christmas present" for the German army because of their effectiveness against German personnel in the open, when they frequently dispersed attacks.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|title=Variable Time Fuse Contributed to the Victory of United Nations|year=2007|accessdate=5 October 2007|url=http://scienceservice.si.edu/pages/102001.htm}}</ref> [[Anti-tank gun]]s were also tremendously improved during the war: in 1939, the British used primarily [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder|2&nbsp;pounder]] and [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|6&nbsp;pounder]] guns.

The tendency to create larger calibre cannon during the World Wars has reversed since. The [[United States Army]], for example, sought a lighter, more versatile howitzer, to replace their ageing pieces. As it could be towed, the [[M198 howitzer|M198]] was selected to be the successor to the World War II–era cannon used at the time, and entered service in 1979.<ref name="M198 Info">{{cite web|url=http://tech.military.com/equipment/view/146534/m198-155mm-towed-howitzer.html|title=M198 information|accessdate=26 May 2008|publisher=Military.com}}</ref> Still in use today, the M198 is, in turn, being slowly replaced by the [[M777 howitzer|M777]] Ultralightweight howitzer, which weighs nearly half as much and can be more easily moved.

====Autocannon====
{{main|Autocannon}}
[[File:USSVixenMaximMachineGun.1898.ws.jpg|thumb|right|A large bore Maxim on the [[USS Vixen (PY-4)|USS ''Vixen'']] c. 1898]]
Autocannon have an automatic firing mode, similar to that of a [[machine gun]]. They have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a higher rate of fire than artillery, often approaching, or, in the case of [[Gatling gun]]s, even surpassing the firing rate of a machine gun.<ref name="Autocannon Rate of Fire"/> While there is no minimum bore for autocannon, they are generally larger than machine guns, typically 20&nbsp;mm or greater since World War II and are usually capable of using explosive ammunition even if it isn't always used. Machine guns in contrast are usually too small to use explosive ammunition.<ref name="dictionary definition">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cannon |title=Cannon Definition |publisher=Merriam Webster |work=Merriam Webster Dictionary |accessdate=17 September 2011 }}</ref>

Most nations use rapid-fire cannon on light vehicles, replacing a more powerful, but heavier, [[tank gun]]. A typical autocannon is the [[25 mm caliber|25&nbsp;mm]] "[[M242 Bushmaster|Bushmaster]]" [[chain gun]], mounted on the [[LAV-25]] and [[M2 Bradley]] [[Infantry fighting vehicle|armored vehicles]].<ref name="Bushmaster"/> Cannon may be capable of a very high rate of fire, but ammunition is heavy and bulky, limiting the amount carried. For this reason, both the 25&nbsp;mm Bushmaster and the 30&nbsp;mm [[RARDEN]] are deliberately designed with relatively low rates of fire. The typical rate of fire for modern autocannon ranges from 90 to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels such as Gatling guns can have rates of fire of more than several thousand rounds per minute. The fastest of these is the [[Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-23|GSh-6-23]], which has a rate of fire of over 10,000&nbsp;rounds per minute.<ref name="Autocannon Rate of Fire">{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Anthony G.|page=241|title=Rapid Fire|publisher=Shrewsbury: Airlife Publishing Ltd.|year=2000|isbn=1-84037-435-7}}</ref>

Autocannon are often found in aircraft, where they replaced machine guns, and as shipboard anti-aircraft weapons, as they provide greater destructive power than machine guns.<ref name="Aircraft Cannon"/>

====Aircraft use====
[[File:Westland C.O.W. Gun Fighter.jpg|thumb|Westland C.O.W. Gun Fighter with 37mm C.O.W. gun mounted to fire upwards]]
The first documented installation of a cannon on an aircraft was on the Voisin Canon in 1911, displayed at the Paris Exposition that year.
By [[World War I]], all of the major powers were experimenting with aircraft mounted cannon; however their low rate of fire and great size and weight precluded any of them from being anything other than experimental. The most successful (or least unsuccessful) was the SPAD 12 Ca.1 with a single 37mm Puteaux mounted to fire between the cylinder banks and through the propeller boss of the aircraft's Hispano-Suiza 8C. The pilot (by necessity an ace) had to manually reload each round.<ref name="Early Aicraft Armament">{{cite book | last = Woodman | first = Harry | authorlink = Harry Woodman | title = Early Aircraft Armament - The Aircraft and the Gun up to 1918 | publisher = [[Arms and Armour Press]] | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-85368-990-3}}</ref>
[[File:Supermarine Spitfire Mk XVI.jpg|thumb|left|Supermarine Spitfire Mk XVI with 20mm cannon protruding from the leading edges of the wings.]]
The first autocannon were developed during World War 1 as anti-aircraft guns, and one of these - the [[Coventry Ordnance Works]] "[[COW 37 mm gun]]" was installed in an aircraft but the war ended before it could be given a field trial and never became standard equipment in a production aircraft. Later trials had it fixed at a steep angle upwards in both the [[Vickers Type 161]] and the [[Westland C.O.W. Gun Fighter]], an idea that would return later.[[Image:GAU-8 in A-10.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[GAU-8/A Avenger]] autocannon, mounted in an [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]]]]
[[File:GSh-23 on MiG-23.jpg|thumb|left|GSh-23 autocannon mounted on the undersides of a MiG-23]]
During this period autocannon became available and several fighters with the German Luftwaffe and Japanese Air Forces were fitted with 20mm cannon. They continued to be installed as an adjunct to machine guns rather than as a replacement as the rate of fire was still too low and the complete installation too heavy. There was a some debate in the RAF as to whether the greater number of possible rounds being fired from a machine gun, or a smaller number of explosive rounds from a cannon was preferable. Improvements during the war in regards to rate of fire allowed the cannon to displace the machine gun almost entirely.<ref name="Aircraft Cannon"/> Cannon was more effective against armour so they were increasingly used during the course of the [[Second World War]], and newer fighters usually carried two or four versus the 6 [[M2 Browning|.50 MG]] for US aircraft or 12 [[M1919 Browning machine gun|.303 MG]] on British Aircraft. The [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404]], [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm cannon]], [[MG FF cannon|MG FF]], and their numerous variants became among the most widely used autocannon in the war.

Cannon, as with machine guns, were fixed to fire forwards (mounted in the wings, in the nose or fuselage, or in a [[pannier]] under either) or mounted in [[turrets]] on heavier aircraft. Both the Germans and Japanese mounted cannon to fire upwards and forwards for use against heavy bombers, with the Germans calling it "[[Schräge Musik]]".

Preceding the [[Vietnam War]] the high speeds aircraft were attaining led to a move to remove the cannon due to the mistaken belief that they would be useless, but combat experience during the Vietnam War showed conclusively that despite advances in missiles, there was still a need for them. Nearly all modern [[fighter aircraft]] are armed with an autocannon and they are also commonly found on [[ground-attack aircraft]]. One of the most powerful examples is the 30mm [[GAU-8/A Avenger]] Gatling-type rotary cannon, mounted exclusively on the [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10 Warthog]]<ref name="Aircraft Cannon"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.442fw.afrc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123055695|title=GAU-8/A|publisher=442nd Fighter Wing|accessdate=26 May 2008}}</ref> The [[Lockheed AC-130]] gunship (a converted transport) can carry a 105mm howitzer as well as a variety of autocannon ranging up to 40mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.123exp-warfare.com/t/03804237449/|title=Information on the GAU-8/A|publisher=The Language of Weaponry|accessdate=26 May 2008}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Both are used in the [[close air support]] role.

==Operation==
{{main|Cannon operation}}
[[Image:Cannoniere 1652.jpg|thumb|left|The parts of a cannon described in John Roberts' ''The Compleat Cannoniere'', London, 1652]]
[[File:Canon firing mvi 3662.ogg|thumb|Firing of a field gun of the early 17th century with a [[linstock]]]]
In the 1770s, cannon operation worked as follows: each cannon would be manned by two gunners, six soldiers, and four officers of artillery. The right gunner was to prime the piece and load it with powder, and the left gunner would fetch the powder from the magazine and be ready to fire the cannon at the officer's command. On each side of the cannon, three soldiers stood, to ram and sponge the cannon, and hold the ladle. The second soldier on the left tasked with providing 50 bullets.<ref name="EB1771">{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=1771|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|location=Edinburgh|chapter=Gunnery}}</ref>

Before loading, the cannon would be cleaned with a wet sponge to extinguish any smouldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by [[wadding]] of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a [[plumb-bob|plummet]]. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.<ref name="EB1771"/>

[[Image:Artillery gun crew-illustration.jpeg|right|thumb|Cannon operation as described in the 1771 edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'']]
During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], a British gun team consisted of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore with a damp sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun with a bag of powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the bagged charge through the vent hole, and fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.<ref>{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Richard|title=Redcoat: the British Soldier in the age of Horse and Musket|year=2002|publisher=[[W. W. Norton & Company]]|isbn=0-393-05211-7|url=http://books.google.com/?id=p5XamBYUu0AC&printsec=frontcover}}</ref>

When a cannon had to be abandoned such as in a retreat or surrender, the touch hole of the cannon would be plugged flush with an iron spike, disabling the cannon (at least until metal boring tools could be used to remove the plug). This was called "spiking the cannon".

==Deceptive use==
{{main|Quaker Gun|Military deception}}
Historically, logs or poles have been used as decoys to mislead the enemy as to the strength of an emplacement. The "[[Quaker Gun|Quaker gun trick]]" was used by Colonel [[William Washington]]'s [[Continental army|Continentals]], during the [[American Revolutionary War]]; in 1780, approximately 100 Loyalists surrendered to them, rather than face bombardment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/revwar/revolution_day_by_day/1780_bottom.html|title=December of 1780|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=26 May 2008}}</ref> During the [[American Civil War]], Quaker guns were also used by the [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]], to compensate for their shortage of artillery. The decoy cannon were painted black at the "muzzle", and positioned behind fortifications to delay [[Union Army|Union]] attacks on those positions. On occasion, real gun carriages were used to complete the deception.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/terms.htm|title=Definitions of Civil War terms|publisher=www.civilwarhome.com/|accessdate=27 May 2008}}</ref>

==In popular culture==

===Music===
Cannon sounds have sometimes been used in classical pieces with a military theme. [[Giuseppe Sarti]] is believed to be the first composer to orchestrate real cannon in a musical work. His ''[[Te Deum]]'' celebrates the Russian victory at [[Siege of Ochakov (1789)|Ochakov]] (1789) with the firing of a real cannon and the use of fireworks, to heighten the martial effect of the music.

One of the best known examples of such a piece is another Russian work, [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[1812 Overture]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/works/tchaikovsky/1812.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070828153345/http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/works/tchaikov/1812.html |archivedate=28 August 2007 |title="1812" Overture in E Flat Major Op. 49 (1880) |last=Lampson |first=Dave |publisher=Classical Net |accessdate=26 May 2008}}</ref> The overture is properly performed using an artillery section together with the orchestra, resulting in noise levels requiring musicians to wear [[Earplug|ear protection]].<ref name=july4 /> The cannon fire simulates Russian artillery bombardments of the [[Battle of Borodino]], a critical battle in [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia]], whose defeat the piece celebrates.<ref name=july4 /> When the overture was first performed, the cannon were fired by an electric current triggered by the conductor.<ref>{{cite book|accessdate=26 May 2008|title=Tchaikovsky|last=Lee|first=Ernest Markham|year=1906|publisher=G. Bell & sons|location=[[Harvard University]]|url=http://books.google.com/?id=x60NAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage|page=21}}</ref> However, the overture was not recorded with real cannon fire until [[Mercury Records]] and [[conductor (music)|conductor]] [[Antal Doráti]]'s 1958 recording of the [[Minnesota Orchestra]].<ref>{{cite web |author= Flynn, Tony |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2007/Oct07/Dorati_flynn.htm |title=Antal Dorati - Recording Legend - October 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2008}}</ref> Cannon fire is also frequently used annually in presentations of the ''1812'' on the American  [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], a tradition started by [[Arthur Fiedler]] of the [[Boston Pops]] in 1974.<ref name=july4>{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Druckenbrod |title=How a rousing Russian tune took over our July 4th |url=http://www.postgazette.com/ae/20030704overtureae3.asp|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=4 August 2003 |accessdate=26 May 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/works/tchaikov/1812.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070828153345/http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/works/tchaikov/1812.html |archivedate=28 August 2007 |title=Classical Net - Tchaikovsky - 1812 Overture |accessdate=26 May 2008}}</ref>

The [[hard rock]] band [[AC/DC]] also used cannon in their song "[[For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)]]",<ref name=acdcsong>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t1014039|pure_url=yes}} |title=For Those About to Rock We Salute You |accessdate=26 May 2008 |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> and in live shows replica Napoleonic cannon and [[pyrotechnics]] were used to perform the piece.<ref name=acdcsong/>

=== Film and television ===
* In the 2000 film ''[[Chicken Run]]'', Rocky is a rooster who is fired into the air by a cannon as part of a circus act.
* In the 2003 television series ''[[Survivor: Pearl Islands]]'', the tribes transport their own cannon through a jungle course for their first challenge.

==Restoration==
Cannon recovered from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, [[Extractive metallurgy|electrolytic reduction treatment]] is required to forestall the process of corrosion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Welss|first=Carmen|title=Rescue Project "Endeavour Cannon"|publisher=[[Foundation for National Parks & Wildlife]]|url=http://fnpw.com.au/enews4/cannon.htm|accessdate=26 May 2008}}</ref> The cannon is then washed in [[Purified water#Deionization|deionized]] water to remove the [[electrolyte]], and is treated in [[tannic acid]], which prevents further [[rust]] and gives the metal a bluish-black colour.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Canadian Conservation Institute|url=http://www.preservation.gc.ca/gallery/cannon_e.asp|title=Preserving My Heritage - Before & After Gallery - Cannon|accessdate=26 May 2008| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050329181011/http://www.preservation.gc.ca/gallery/cannon_e.asp| archivedate = 29 March 2005}}</ref><ref name="union"/> After this process, cannon on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a [[wax]] sealant. A coat of [[polyurethane]] may also be painted over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays.<ref name="union">{{cite web|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/crl/Report6/union.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050101190851/http://nautarch.tamu.edu/crl/Report6/union.htm|archivedate=1 January 2005|title=Civil War Union Cannon Conservation, CRL Report 5|accessdate=26 May 2008}}</ref>
Recently archaeologists say six cannon recovered from a river in Panama that could have belonged to legendary pirate [[Henry Morgan]] are being studied and could eventually be displayed after going through a restoration process.<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/28/AR2011022807113.html Retrieval 2 March 2011</ref>
