The '''crankshaft''', sometimes abbreviated to ''[[crank (mechanism)|crank]]'', is the part of an [[engine]] that translates [[reciprocation|reciprocating]] [[linear]] [[piston]] motion into rotation. To convert the reciprocating motion into rotation, the crankshaft has "crank throws" or "[[crankpin]]s", additional bearing surfaces whose axis is offset from that of the crank, to which the "big ends" of the [[connecting rod]]s from each cylinder attach.

It is typically connected to a [[flywheel]] to reduce the pulsation characteristic of the [[four-stroke cycle]], and sometimes a torsional or vibrational damper at the opposite end, to reduce the [[torsional vibration]]s often caused along the length of the crankshaft by the cylinders farthest from the output end acting on the torsional elasticity of the metal.

The earliest evidence, anywhere in the world, for a crank and [[connecting rod]] in a machine appears in the late Roman [[Hierapolis sawmill]] from the 3rd century AD and two Roman stone [[sawmill]]s at [[Gerasa]], [[Roman Syria]], and [[Ephesus]], [[Asia Minor]] (both 6th century AD).<ref name="Ritti, Grewe, Kessener 2007, 161">{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|p=161}}: {{quote|Because of the findings at Ephesus and Gerasa the invention of the crank and connecting rod system has had to be redated from the 13th to the 6th c; now the Hierapolis relief takes it back another three centuries, which confirms that water-powered stone saw mills were in use when [[Ausonius]] wrote his Mosella.}}</ref> On the [[pediment]] of the Hierapolis mill, a [[waterwheel]] fed by a [[mill race]] is shown transmitting power through a [[gear train]] to two [[frame saw]]s, which cut rectangular blocks by way of some kind of connecting rods and, through mechanical necessity, cranks.

One of the drawings of the Anonymous of the Hussite Wars shows a boat with a pair of paddle-wheels at each end turned by men operating compound cranks (see above).

His wind-powered [[sawmill]] used a crankshaft to convert a windmill's circular motion into a back-and-forward motion powering the saw. Corneliszoon was granted a [[patent]] for his crankshaft in 1597.

From the 16th century onwards, evidence of cranks and connecting rods integrated into machine design becomes abundant in the technological treatises of the period: [[Agostino Ramelli]]'s ''The Diverse and Artifactitious Machines'' of 1588 alone depicts eighteen examples, a number that rises in the ''Theatrum Machinarum Novum'' by [[Georg Andreas Böckler]] to 45 different machines, one third of the total.<ref>{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=172}}</ref>

Large engines are usually [[engine configuration|multicylinder]] to reduce pulsations from individual firing [[stroke (engines)|strokes]], with more than one piston attached to a complex crankshaft. Many small engines, such as those found in [[moped]]s or garden machinery, are single cylinder and use only a single piston, simplifying crankshaft design. This engine can also be built with no riveted seam.

===Bearings===
The crankshaft has a linear [[Axis of rotation|axis]] about which it rotates, typically with several [[bearing journal]]s riding on replaceable [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] (the [[main bearing]]s) held in the engine block. As the crankshaft undergoes a great deal of sideways load from each cylinder in a multicylinder engine, it must be supported by several such bearings, not just one at each end. This was a factor in the rise of [[V8 engine]]s, with their shorter crankshafts, in preference to [[straight-8]] engines. The long crankshafts of the latter suffered from an unacceptable amount of flex when engine designers began using higher [[compression ratio]]s and higher rotational speeds. High performance engines often have more main bearings than their lower performance cousins for this reason.

===Piston stroke===
The distance the axis of the crank throws from the axis of the crankshaft determines the piston [[stroke (engines)|stroke]] measurement, and thus [[engine displacement]]. A common way to increase the low-speed torque of an engine is to increase the stroke, sometimes known as "shaft-stroking." This also increases the [[engine balance|reciprocating vibration]], however, limiting the high speed capability of the engine. In compensation, it improves the low speed operation of the engine, as the longer intake stroke through smaller valve(s) results in greater turbulence and mixing of the intake charge. Most modern high speed production engines are classified as "over square" or short-stroke, wherein the stroke is less than the diameter of the [[cylinder bore]].  As such, finding the proper balance between shaft-stroking speed and length leads to better results.

===Engine configuration===
The [[Engine configuration|configuration]] and number of pistons in relation to each other and the crank leads to [[straight engine|straight]], [[V engine|V]] or [[flat engine]]s. The same basic [[engine block]] can be used with different crankshafts, however, to alter the [[firing order]]; for instance, the 90° [[V6 engine]] configuration, in older days sometimes derived by using six cylinders of a [[V8 engine]] with what is basically a shortened version of the V8 crankshaft, produces an engine with an [[V6 engine#Odd and even firing|inherent pulsation in the power flow]] due to the "missing" two cylinders. The same engine, however, can be made to provide evenly spaced power pulses by using a crankshaft with an individual crank throw for each cylinder, spaced so that the pistons are actually phased 120° apart, as in the [[GM 3800 engine]]. While production V8 engines use four crank throws spaced 90° apart, high-performance V8 engines often use a "flat" crankshaft with throws spaced 180° apart. The difference can be heard as the flat-plane crankshafts result in the engine having a smoother, higher-pitched sound than cross-plane (for example, [[IndyCar Series|IRL IndyCar Series]] compared to [[Sprint Cup Series|NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]], or a [[Ferrari 355]] compared to a [[Chevrolet Corvette]]). See the main article on [[crossplane]] crankshafts.

===Engine balance===
For some engines it is necessary to provide [[counterweight]]s for the reciprocating mass of each piston and connecting rod to improve [[engine balance]]. These are typically cast as part of the crankshaft but, occasionally, are bolt-on pieces. While counter weights add a considerable amount of weight to the crankshaft, it provides a smoother running engine and allows higher RPM levels to be reached.

===Rotary engines===
Many early aircraft engines (and a few in other applications) had the crankshaft fixed to the [[airframe]] and instead the cylinders rotated, known as a [[rotary engine]] design. Rotary engines such as the [[Wankel engine]] are referred to as pistonless rotary engines.

In the [[Wankel engine]] the rotors drive the eccentric shaft, which could be considered the equivalent of the crankshaft in a piston engine.

==Construction==
[[Image:Marine Crankshafts 8b03602r.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Continental engine]] marine crankshafts, 1942]]

Crankshafts can be monolithic (made in a single piece) or assembled from several pieces. Monolithic crankshafts are most common, but some smaller and larger engines use assembled crankshafts.

===Forging and casting===
Crankshafts can be [[forging|forged]] from a steel bar usually through roll forging or [[casting (metalworking)|cast]] in ductile steel. Today more and more manufacturers tend to favor the use of forged crankshafts due to their lighter weight, more compact dimensions and better inherent dampening. With forged crankshafts, [[Vanadium#Applications|vanadium]] microalloyed steels are mostly used as these steels can be air cooled after reaching high strengths without additional heat treatment, with exception to the surface hardening of the bearing surfaces. The low alloy content also makes the material cheaper than high alloy steels. Carbon steels are also used, but these require additional heat treatment to reach the desired properties. Iron crankshafts are today mostly found in cheaper production engines (such as those found in the Ford Focus diesel engines) where the loads are lower. Some engines also use cast iron crankshafts for low output versions while the more expensive high output version use forged steel.

===Machining===
Crankshafts can also be [[Machining|machined]] out of a [[Billet (manufacturing)|billet]], often a bar of high quality vacuum remelted steel. Though the fiber flow (local inhomogeneities of the material's chemical composition generated during casting) doesn’t follow the shape of the crankshaft (which is undesirable), this is usually not a problem since higher quality steels, which normally are difficult to forge, can be used. These crankshafts tend to be very expensive due to the large amount of material that must be removed with lathes and milling machines, the high material cost, and the additional heat treatment required. However, since no expensive tooling is needed, this production method allows small production runs without high costs.

In an effort to reduce costs, used crankshafts may also be machined. A good core may often be easily reconditioned by a crankshaft grinding <ref>{{cite web|title=Crankshaft Grinding|url=http://crankshaftrepair.org/grinding/|publisher=Crankshaft Repair}}</ref> process. Severely damaged crankshafts may also be repaired with a welding operation, prior to grinding, that utilizes a submerged arc welding machine. To accommodate the smaller journal diameters a ground crankshaft has, and possibly an over-sized thrust dimension, oversize engine bearings are used to allow for precise clearances during operation.

===Fatigue strength===
The fatigue strength of crankshafts is usually increased by using a radius at the ends of each main and crankpin bearing. The radius itself reduces the stress in these critical areas, but since the radius in most cases are rolled, this also leaves some compressive residual stress in the surface, which prevents cracks from forming.

===Hardening===
Most production crankshafts use induction hardened bearing surfaces, since that method gives good results with low costs. It also allows the crankshaft to be reground without re-hardening. But high performance crankshafts, billet crankshafts in particular, tend to use [[nitridization]] instead. Nitridization is slower and thereby more costly, and in addition it puts certain demands on the alloying metals in the steel to be able to create stable nitrides. The advantage of nitridization is that it can be done at low temperatures, it produces a very hard surface, and the process leaves some compressive residual stress in the surface, which is good for fatigue properties. The low temperature during treatment is advantageous in that it doesn’t have any negative effects on the steel, such as [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]. With crankshafts that operate on roller bearings, the use of [[carburization]] tends to be favored due to the high [[Hertzian contact stress]]es in such an application. Like nitriding, carburization also leaves some compressive residual stresses in the surface.

===Counterweights===
Some expensive, high performance crankshafts also use heavy-metal counterweights to make the crankshaft more compact. The heavy-metal used is most often a tungsten alloy but depleted uranium has also been used. A cheaper option is to use lead, but compared with tungsten its density is much lower.

==Stress on crankshafts==
The shaft is subjected to various forces but generally needs to be analysed in two positions.
Firstly, failure may occur at the position of maximum bending; this may be at the centre of the crank or at either end. In such a condition the failure is due to bending and the pressure in the cylinder is maximal. Second, the crank may fail due to twisting, so the conrod needs to be checked for shear at the position of maximal twisting. The pressure at this position is the maximal pressure, but only a fraction of maximal pressure.''
