'''Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|w|ɔr|t|s|ən|ɛ|ɡ|ər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈaɐnɔlt ˈalɔʏs ˈʃvaɐtsənˌʔɛɡɐ|lang}}; born July 30, 1947) is an [[Austrian American]] actor, politician, businessman, investor, and former professional [[bodybuilder]]. Schwarzenegger served two terms as the [[List of Governors of California|38th Governor of California]] from 2003 until 2011.

Schwarzenegger began [[weight training]] at the age of 15. He won the [[World Amateur Bodybuilding Championships|Mr. Universe]] title at age 20 and went on to win the [[Mr. Olympia]] contest seven times. Schwarzenegger has remained a prominent presence in bodybuilding and has written many books and articles on the sport. Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] action film icon. He was nicknamed the "Austrian Oak" and the "[[Styria]]n Oak" in his bodybuilding days, "Arnie" during his acting career and more recently "The Governator" (a [[portmanteau]] of "Governor" and "[[Terminator (character)|The Terminator]]" – one of his best-known movie roles).<ref name="IMDb bio">{{cite web |title=Biography for Arnold Schwarzenegger |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216/bio |accessdate=April 18, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080308214615/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216/bio| archivedate= March 08 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

As a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he was first elected on October 7, 2003, in a special [[California recall election, 2003|recall election]] to replace then-Governor [[Gray Davis]]. Schwarzenegger was sworn in on November 17, 2003, to serve the remainder of Davis's term. Schwarzenegger was then re-elected on November 7, 2006, in [[California gubernatorial election, 2006|California's 2006 gubernatorial election]], to serve a full term as governor, defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Phil Angelides]], who was [[California State Treasurer]] at the time. Schwarzenegger was sworn in for his second term on January 5, 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/05/AR2007010501386.html |title=Schwarzenegger Sworn in for Second Term |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=April 23, 2008 |last=Kurtzman|first=Laura | work=The Washington Post | date=January 5, 2007}}</ref> In 2011, Schwarzenegger completed his second term as governor, and it was announced that he had separated from [[Maria Shriver]], his wife for the last 25 years, and a member of the influential [[Kennedy family]], as a niece of the late [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[US President]] [[John F.

Later, he and the film's producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder for the purpose of showing the extremes that some would go to for their sport and to make Schwarzenegger's image more cold and machine-like in order to fan controversy for the film.<ref>Interview in ''Pumping Iron&nbsp;– 25th Anniversary Edition'' DVD extras</ref> Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, has said he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother.<ref name="DT2">{{cite news |title=The girl who can't escape Arnie |date=October 6, 2003 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/10/02/bfarni02.xml&page=1 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=April 18, 2008 | first=Oliver | last=Poole| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080410221914/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/10/02/bfarni02.xml&page=1| archivedate= April 10, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father's funeral.<ref name="wl"/>

In an interview with ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what "would now be called child abuse" at the hands of his father: "My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'you can't do this,' I said, 'this is not going to be for much longer, because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.'"<ref name="nazi"/>

===Early adulthood===
Schwarzenegger served in the [[Austrian Armed Forces|Austrian Army]] in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males.<ref name="lifeline"/><ref name="mrever"/> During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest.<ref name="profilear"/> He went [[AWOL]] during basic training so he could take part in the competition and spent a week in military prison: "Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences." He won another bodybuilding contest in Graz, at Steirer Hof Hotel (where he had placed second). He was voted best built man of Europe, which made him famous. "The [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]] title was my ticket to America&nbsp;– the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich."<ref name="per"/> Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the [[NABBA Mr. Universe]] competition in London.<ref name="mrever"/> He would come in second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner [[Chester Yorton]].<ref name="mrever"/>

Charles "Wag" Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in [[Forest Gate]], London, England. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the [[East End of London]] helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4862637.ece |location=London |work=The Times | title=Wag Bennett bodybuilder who helped Arnold Schwarzenegger | date=October 2, 2008 | first=Lindsay | last=McIntosh}}</ref><ref>Staff, [http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/777625?view=synopsis Arnold Schwarzenegger: Made in Britain], [[British Film Institute]].

===Move to the U.S.===
[[File:Reagan+Schwarzenegger1984.jpg|thumb|upright|Schwarzenegger with President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984.]]

Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding, and his legacy is commemorated in the [[Arnold Classic]] annual bodybuilding competition. Schwarzenegger has remained a prominent face in the bodybuilding sport long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.

For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines ''[[Muscle & Fitness]]'' and ''[[Flex (magazine)|Flex]]''. Shortly after being elected Governor, he was appointed executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California.<ref name="megerian">Megerian, Chris.

His bodybulding victories included five Mr. Universe (4&nbsp;– [[NABBA]] [England], 1&nbsp;– [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] [USA]) wins, and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until [[Lee Haney]] won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.

Schwarzenegger continues to work out even today. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 [[Arnold Classic]] he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPEVHihgmHc&feature=related |title=Ask Arnold Training Seminar- Arnold Schwarzenegger Talks Bodybuilding Advice – Part 1 |work=Youtube |date=March 6, 2011 |accessdate=October 9, 2011}}</ref>

===Powerlifting/weightlifting===
During Arnold's early years in bodybuilding, he also competed in several [[Olympic weightlifting]] and [[powerlifting]] contests. Arnold won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965, as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968.<ref name="gmv.com.au"/>

In 1967, Schwarzenegger competed in and won the [[Munich]] stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254&nbsp;kg/560&nbsp;lbs.) is lifted between the legs while standing on two foot rests.

===Mr. Olympia===
[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger and Karyn Marshall.JPG|thumb|left|Schwarzenegger presented awards at the USA Weightlifting Hall of Fame in 2011 in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. In photo: 1987 world champion American [[Karyn Marshall]].]]
Schwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming [[Mr. Olympia]].<ref name="lifeline"/><ref name="mrever"/> His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion [[Sergio Oliva]]. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day.<ref name="mrever"/>

He continued his winning streak in the 1971–74 competitions.<ref name="mrever"/> In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time,<ref name="mrever"/> beating [[Franco Columbu]]. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.<ref name="mrever"/>

Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called ''[[Pumping Iron]].'' Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' with [[Jeff Bridges]]. [[Lou Ferrigno]] proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.

Schwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia.<ref name="lifeline"/> Schwarzenegger was training for his role in ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan]]'', and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret, in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide [[color commentary]] for network television, when he announced at the eleventh hour that while he was there: "Why not compete?" Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. After being declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition.

===Steroid use===
Schwarzenegger has admitted to using performance-enhancing [[anabolic steroid]]s while they were legal, writing in 1977 that "steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when [[Weight cutting|cutting up]]."<ref>{{cite web |title=Conan the Politician |publisher=ESPN |url=http://espn.go.com/columns/farrey_tom/1655597.html |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Farrey |first=Tom| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080329223151/http://espn.go.com/columns/farrey_tom/1655597.html| archivedate= March 29, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> He has called the drugs "tissue building."<ref name="Arnold Steroids">{{cite web |title=Arnold & Steroids: Truth Revealed |publisher=get2net |url=http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031008172601/http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm |archivedate=October 8, 2003 |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Theunissen |first=Steve}}</ref>

In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Dr. Willi Heepe, a German doctor who publicly predicted his early death on the basis of a link between his steroid use and his [[#Accidents and injuries|later heart problems]]. As the doctor had never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a US$10,000 libel judgment against him in a German court.<ref>{{cite web |title=Schwarzenegger Wins German Lawsuit |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-24150868.html |work=Encyclopedia.com |publisher=UPI |date=December 1, 1999 |accessdate=December 6, 2009 }}</ref> In 1999, Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with ''[[The Globe (tabloid)|The Globe]]'', a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health.<ref>{{cite news |title=Arnie settles $50m libel case |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/574902.stm |date=December 22, 1999 |accessdate=December 6, 2009}}</ref>

===Early roles===
Schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the role of Hercules in 1970's ''[[Hercules in New York]]''. Credited under the name "Arnold Strong," his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] after production.<ref name="profilear"/> His second film appearance was as a deaf mute hit-man for the mob in director [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' (1976), for which he was awarded a [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year - Actor|Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year]]. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career. "It was very difficult for me in the beginning&nbsp;– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance."<ref name="askarnold1"/>

Schwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the [[bodybuilding]] film ''[[Pumping Iron]]'' (1977),<ref name="katzfilm"/><ref name="profilear"/> elements of which were dramatized. In 1991, Schwarzenegger purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web |title=The Smoking Gun: Archive |publisher=TheSmokingGun |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/arnoldpump1.html |accessdate=May 11, 2007}}</ref> Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', but did not win the role because of his height. Later, [[Lou Ferrigno]] got the part of Dr. David Banner's alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Ann-Margret]] in the 1979 comedy ''[[The Villain (1979 film)|The Villain]]''. In 1980 he starred in a biographical film of the 1950s actress [[Jayne Mansfield]] as Mansfield's husband, [[Mickey Hargitay]].

===Action superstar===
Schwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the [[sword-and-sorcery]] epic ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' in 1982, which was a box-office hit.<ref name="katzfilm"/> This was followed by a sequel, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'', in 1984, although it was not as successful as its predecessor.<ref name="tessay">{{cite news |first=Clark |last=Collis |title=EMPIRE ESSAY: The Terminator |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |work=Empire magazine |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}</ref> In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video "[[Rio Carnival|Carnival in Rio]]". In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character, and what some would say was his acting career's signature role, in [[James Cameron]]'s science fiction [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] film ''[[The Terminator]]''.<ref name="katzfilm" /><ref name="profilear" /><ref name="fanleam">{{cite book |last=Leamer |first=Laurence |title=Fantastic: The life of Arnold Schwarzenegger |year=2005 |publisher=St Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-33338-6}}</ref> Following this, Schwarzenegger made ''[[Red Sonja (film)|Red Sonja]]'' in 1985.<ref name="tessay" />

During the 1980s, audiences had an appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and [[Sylvester Stallone]] becoming international stars.<ref name="profilear" /> Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his sense of humor, separating his roles from more serious action hero films. The alternative-universe comedy thriller ''[[Last Action Hero]]'' featured a poster of the movie ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', which, in the alternate universe, starred Stallone. He made a number of successful films, such as ''[[Commando (film)|Commando]]'' (1985), ''[[Raw Deal (1986 movie)|Raw Deal]]'' (1986), ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'' (1987), ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' (1987), and ''[[Red Heat]]'' (1988).

[[File:Chth arnold schwarzenegger.jpg|left|thumb|Footprints and handprints of Arnold Schwarzenegger in front of the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]]]]
''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'' (1988), a comedy with [[Danny DeVito]], also proved successful. ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10&nbsp;million and 15% of the film's gross. A science fiction script, the film was based on the [[Philip K. Dick]] short story "[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]". ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990) reunited him with director [[Ivan Reitman]], who directed him in ''Twins''. Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing, first with a 1990 episode of the TV series  ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', entitled "[[List of Tales from the Crypt episodes#Season 2 (1990)|The Switch]]", and then with the 1992 [[telemovie]] ''[[Christmas in Connecticut]]''. He has not directed since.

Schwarzenegger's commercial peak was his return as the title character in 1991's ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'', which was the highest-grossing film of 1991. In 1993, the [[National Association of Theatre Owners]] named him the "International Star of the Decade".<ref name="lifeline" /> His next film project, the 1993 self-aware [[action comedy]] [[parody|spoof]] ''Last Action Hero'', was released opposite ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', and did not do well at the box office. His next film, the comedy drama ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994), was a popular spy film, and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with James Cameron.

That same year, the comedy ''[[Junior (film)|Junior]]'' was released, the last of Schwarzenegger's three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring Danny DeVito. This film brought him his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor&nbsp;– Musical or Comedy]]. It was followed by the action thriller ''[[Eraser (film)|Eraser]]'' (1996), the Christmas comedy ''[[Jingle All The Way]]'' (1996), and the comic book-based ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' (1997), in which he played the villain [[Mr. Freeze]]. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of ''Batman & Robin'', his film career and box office prominence went into decline. He returned with the supernatural thriller ''[[End of Days (film)|End of Days]]'' (1999), later followed by the action films ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000) and ''[[Collateral Damage (film)|Collateral Damage]]'' (2002), both of which failed to do well at the box office. In 2003, he made his third appearance as the title character in ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'', which went on to earn over $150&nbsp;million domestically.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a 25-meter (82&nbsp;ft) tall ''Terminator'' statue in a park in central [[Graz]]. Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the [[Special Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Arnold wants 'Terminator' statue killed |publisher=Killoggs |url=http://www.killoggs.com/news/?news=609 |date=September 27, 2002 |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}</ref>

===Retirement===
His film appearances after becoming Governor of California included a three-second cameo appearance in ''[[The Rundown]]'', and the 2004 remake of ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 movie)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''. In 2005, he appeared as himself in the film ''[[The Kid & I]]''. He voiced [[Baron von Steuben]] in the ''[[Liberty's Kids]]'' episode "[[Valley Forge]]". He had been rumored to be appearing in ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' as the original T-800; he denied his involvement,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scifiwire.com/2009/03/arnold-confirms-but-downp.php |title=Arnold downplays a Terminator Salvation cameo |publisher=SCI FI Wire |accessdate=March 11, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090313234133/http://scifiwire.com/2009/03/arnold-confirms-but-downp.php| archivedate= March 13, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> but it was later revealed that he would appear briefly via his image being inserted into the movie from stock footage of the first ''Terminator'' movie.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://movies.tvguide.com/Movie-News/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Terminator-1005894.aspx|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger (Virtually) Back in Terminator Salvation|publisher=TVGuide.com|accessdate=May 8, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090520083012/http://movies.tvguide.com/Movie-News/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Terminator-1005894.aspx| archivedate= May 20, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelzchannel.com/person/176340/mcg|title=McG Talks Terminator Salvation|publisher=reelzchannel.com|accessdate=May 11, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090501190521/http://www.reelzchannel.com/person/176340/mcg| archivedate= May 01 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Schwarzenegger appeared in Sylvester Stallone's ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'', where he made a [[cameo appearance]].

In January 2011, just weeks after leaving office in California, Schwarzenegger announced that he was reading several new scripts for future films, one of them being the World War II action drama ''With Wings as Eagles'', written by [[Randall Wallace]], based on a true story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.krone.at/Welt/Schwarzenegger_Ich_lese_gerade_drei_Drehbuecher-Krone-Interview-Story-240860 |title=Schwarzenegger: "Ich lese gerade drei Drehbücher" – "Krone"-Interview – Welt |publisher=krone.at |date=January 16, 2011 |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thearnoldfans.com/news/1741.html |title=TheArnoldFans.com |publisher=TheArnoldFans.com |date=January 16, 2011 |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}</ref> On March 6, 2011, at the Arnold Seminar of the  [[Arnold Classic]], Schwarzenegger revealed that he was being considered for several films, including sequels to ''[[The Terminator]]'' and remakes of ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' and ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'', and that he was "packaging" a comic book character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thearnoldfans.com/news/1767.html |title=TheArnoldFans.com |publisher=TheArnoldFans.com |date=March 6, 2011 |accessdate=April 3, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110421231211/http://www.thearnoldfans.com/news/1767.html| archivedate= April 21, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The character was later revealed to be [[the Governator]], star of the comic book and animated series of the same name.

===Early politics===
Schwarzenegger has been a registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for many years. As an actor, his political views were always well known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars, who are generally considered to be a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-leaning community. At the [[2004 Republican National Convention]], Schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained why he was a Republican:<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/31/gop.schwarzenegger.transcript/ |date=August 31, 2004 |title=Schwarzenegger: No country more welcoming than the USA |publisher=CNN |accessdate=April 18, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080408110102/http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/31/gop.schwarzenegger.transcript/| archivedate= April 08 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

{{quote|I finally arrived here in 1968. What a special day it was. I remember I arrived here with empty pockets but full of dreams, full of determination, full of desire. The [[United States presidential election, 1968|presidential campaign]] was in full swing. I remember watching the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]-[[Hubert Humphrey|Humphrey]] presidential race on TV. A friend of mine who spoke German and English translated for me. I heard Humphrey saying things that sounded like socialism, which I had just left.

But then I heard Nixon speak. He was talking about free enterprise, getting the government off your back, lowering the taxes and strengthening the military. Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air. I said to my friend, I said, "What party is he?" My friend said, "He's a Republican." I said, "Then I am a Republican." And I have been a Republican ever since.}}

In 1985, Schwarzenegger appeared in ''[[Stop the Madness]]'', an anti-drug music video sponsored by the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]. He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 Presidential election]], accompanying then-Vice President [[George H.W. Bush]] at a campaign rally.<ref name = "Noonan">{{cite book | last = Noonan| first = Peggy| authorlink =Peggy Noonan | title = What I Saw at the Revolution: A Political Life in the Reagan Era| publisher=Random House| date = October 14, 2003| location = New York| page = 384 | isbn = 978-0-8129-6989-4}}</ref>

Schwarzenegger's first political appointment was as chairman of the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]], on which he served from 1990 to 1993.<ref name="lifeline"/> He was nominated by George H. W. Bush, who dubbed him "[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Republican". He later served as Chairman for the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor [[Pete Wilson]].

Between 1993 and 1994, Schwarzenegger was a [[Red Cross]] ambassador (a ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television/radio [[public service announcement]]s to donate blood.

In an interview with ''[[Talk (magazine)|Talk]]'' magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied, "I think about it many times. The possibility is there, because I feel it inside."<ref name="governtalk">{{cite news |title=Arnold cast as Governor? |date=October 4, 1999 |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/news.asp?id=90 |work=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=April 18, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080523203946/http%3A//www.schwarzenegger.com/news.asp%3Fid%3D90 |archivedate = May 23, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for [[governor of California]].<ref name="governtalk"/> Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, "I'm in show business&nbsp;– I am in the middle of my career.

===Governor of California===
Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the [[California recall election, 2003|2003 California recall]] election for Governor of California on the August 6, 2003 episode of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.<ref name="profilear"/> According to Schwarzenegger, he did not decide to run until the day of the announcement:

{{quote|The recall happens and people are asking me, ‘What are you going to do?’ I thought about it but decided I wasn’t going to do it. I told Maria I wasn’t running.

Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the "Governator" (referring to ''The Terminator'' movies, see above) and "The Running Man" (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election "Total Recall" (yet another movie starring Schwarzenegger). Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one debate on September 24, 2003.<ref name="FirstDebate">{{cite news |last=Grey|first=Barry|title=First debate in California recall election: Snapshot of a political system in crisis|date=November 6, 2003 |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/sep2003/cali-s06.shtml|work=wsws.org|accessdate=April 18, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080508191758/http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/sep2003/cali-s06.shtml| archivedate= May 08 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
[[File:Schwarzenegger Bush.jpg|thumb|200px|left|President [[George W. Bush]] meets with Schwarzenegger after his successful election to the California Governorship]]

On October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor [[Gray Davis]] being removed from office with 55.4% of the ''Yes'' vote in favor of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat [[Cruz Bustamante]], fellow Republican [[Tom McClintock]], and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received 31% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3&nbsp;million votes. Under the regulations of the [[California Constitution]], no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the second foreign-born governor of California after Irish-born Governor [[John G. Downey]] in 1862.

As soon as Schwarzenegger was elected governor, [[Willie Lewis Brown, Jr.|Willie Brown]] said he would start a drive to recall the governor. Schwarzenegger was equally entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up [[gridlock]]. Building on a catchphrase from the sketch "[[Hans and Franz]]" from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (which partly parodied his bodybuilding career), Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians "[[girlie men]]".<ref name="SFGirlieMen">{{cite news |title=Schwarzenegger deems opponents 'girlie-men' |date=July 18, 2004 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/07/18/MNGH57NKAF1.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=April 18, 2008 | first=Peter | last=Nicholas| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080504060359/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/07/18/MNGH57NKAF1.DTL| archivedate= May 04 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Schwarzenegger's early victories included repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses being given out to illegal immigrants, but later he began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a [[California special election, 2005|special election]] he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He would later comment that "no one could win if the opposition raised 160&nbsp;million dollars to defeat you".

Schwarzenegger then went against the advice of fellow Republican strategists and appointed a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his Chief of Staff. Schwarzenegger gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election.

Schwarzenegger ran for re-election against Democrat [[Phil Angelides]], the [[California State Treasurer]], in the [[California gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 elections]], held on November 7, 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for Angelides, a margin of well over one million votes.<ref>{{cite web |title=General Election&nbsp;– Governor |publisher=California Secretary of State |url=http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/gov/00.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219111658/http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/gov/00.htm |archivedate=February 19, 2007 |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}</ref> In recent years, many commentators have seen Schwarzenegger as moving away from the right and towards the center of the political spectrum. After hearing a speech by Schwarzenegger at the 2006 [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] breakfast, San Francisco mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] said that, "[H]e's becoming a Democrat [... H]e's running back, not even to the center. I would say center-left".

It was rumored that Schwarzenegger might run for the [[United States Senate]] in 2010, as his governorship would be term-limited by that time. This turned out to be false.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/22/AR2006122201476.html|title=Schwarzenegger Remakes Himself as Environmentalist |work=The Washington Post|accessdate=July 13, 2008|first=John |last=Pomfret | date=December 23, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2009/03/22/MNJH16KC5G.DTL| title = Predictions for Schwarzenegger's Next Big Role

Wendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and [[bodybuilding]] as building blocks to escape a depressing home.<ref name="governG2"/> Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, "I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential&nbsp;– I was always fascinated by people in control of other people."<ref name="governG2"/> Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, "I married into a political family.

Schwarzenegger's endorsement in the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|Republican primary]] of the [[2008 U.S. Presidential election]] was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates [[Rudy Giuliani]] and Senator [[John McCain]], Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani dropped out of the Presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in Florida, and endorsed McCain. Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library]] in California. The following day, he endorsed McCain, joking, "It's Rudy's fault!" (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind). Schwarzenegger's endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCain's campaign; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Baltimore Sun|url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/blog/2008/01/arnold_opens_flood_of_mccain_e.html|title=Arnold opens 'flood' of McCain endorsements|accessdate=May 7, 2008}}</ref>

A fifth woman claimed Schwarzenegger tried to take off her bathing suit in a hotel elevator, and the last said he pulled her onto his lap and asked her about a sex act.<ref name="grope1"/>

Schwarzenegger admitted that he has "behaved badly sometimes" and apologized, but also stated that "a lot of [what] you see in the stories is not true". This came after an interview in adult magazine ''[[Oui (magazine)|Oui]]'' from 1977 surfaced, in which Schwarzenegger discussed attending sexual orgies and using substances such as [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Schwarzenegger's Sex Talk |publisher=The Smoking Gun |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/schwarzeneggers-sex-talk |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref> Schwarzenegger is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning Mr. Olympia in the 1975 documentary film ''[[Pumping Iron]].''

===Citizenship===
In 2005, [[Peter Pilz]], from the [[Austrian Green Party]], demanded that parliament revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship due to his decision not to prevent the executions of [[Donald Beardslee]] and [[Stanley Williams]], causing damage of reputation to Austria, where the death penalty is abolished since 1968. This demand was based on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act that states: ''A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship, if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic''.<ref name="DamageAustria"/> Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]) had indeed done damage to Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger explained his actions by referring to the fact that his only duty as Governor of California was to prevent an error in the judicial system.

===Environmental record===
On September 27, 2006 Schwarzenegger signed a bill creating the nation's first cap on greenhouse gas emissions. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/27/AR2006092700174.html | accessdate =May 15, 2008 | work=The Washington Post | title=Schwarzenegger Signs Global Warming Bill | first=Samantha | last=Young | date=September 27, 2006}}</ref>

Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006 allowing California to work with the Northeast's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. They plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the amount of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan took effect in 2009.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Oct17/0,4670,GlobalWarmingSchwarzenegger,00.html | accessdate =May 15, 2008 | work=Fox News | title=Cal Joins Northeast Global Warming Fight | first=Karen | last=Matthews | date=October 17, 2006}}</ref> In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint.

===Presidential ambitions===

In October 2013, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Schwarzenegger was exploring a future run for [[President of the United States|President]]. The former California governor would face a [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] hurdle; [[Natural-born-citizen clause|Article II, Section I, Clause V]] nominally prevents individuals who are not natural-born citizens of the United States from assuming the office. He has reportedly been lobbying legislators about a possible [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|constitutional change]], or filing a legal challenge to the provision. [[Columbia University]] law professor [[Michael C. Dorf|Michael Dorf]] observed that Arnold's possible lawsuit could ultimately win him the right to run for the office, noting, "The law is very clear, but it’s not 100 percent clear that the courts would enforce that law rather than leave it to the political process."<ref>{{cite news|title=Arnold lobbies for White House run|author=Smith, E.|url=http://pagesix.com/2013/10/18/schwarzenegger-mounting-legal-challenge-to-run-for-president/|newspaper=New York Post|date=October 18, 2013|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}</ref>

==Business career==
Schwarzenegger has had a highly successful business career.<ref name="governG2"/><ref name="LAWarn"/> Following his move to the United States, Schwarzenegger became a "prolific goal setter" and would write his objectives at the start of the year on index cards, like starting a mail order business or buying a new car&nbsp;– and succeed in doing so.<ref name="DT2"/> By the age of 30, Schwarzenegger was a millionaire, well before his career in Hollywood. His financial independence came from his success as a budding entrepreneur with a series of successful business ventures and investments.

===Bricklaying business===
In 1968, Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder [[Franco Columbu]] started a bricklaying business.

Schwarzenegger met his next paramour, Sue Moray, a [[Beverly Hills]] hairdresser's assistant, on [[Venice Beach]] in July 1977.

On January 8, 2006, while Schwarzenegger was riding his [[Harley Davidson]] motorcycle in Los Angeles, with his son Patrick in the sidecar, another driver backed into the street he was riding on, causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed. While his son and the other driver were unharmed, the governor sustained a minor injury to his lip, requiring 15 stitches.

===Height===
Schwarzenegger's official height of 6'2" (1.88&nbsp;m) has been brought into question by several articles. In his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s, he was measured to be 6'1.5" (1.87&nbsp;m), a height confirmed by his fellow bodybuilders.<ref name="HeightArnold">{{cite web |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger Height, Schwarzenegger's |publisher=celebheights.com |url=http://www.celebheights.com/s/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-177.html |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Schwarzenegger Measured">{{cite web |title=Schwarzenegger Measured |publisher=ArnoldHeight |url=http://www.arnoldheight.com/article5.html |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref> However, in 1988 both the ''Daily Mail'' and ''Time Out'' magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter.<ref name="Andrews, N page 157">Andrews, N: "True Myths: The life and times of Arnold Schwarzenegger," page 157.

===Autobiography===
Schwarzenegger's autobiography, ''Total Recall,'' was released in October 2012. He devotes one chapter called "The Secret" to his extramarital affair. The majority of his book is about his successes in the three major chapters in his life: bodybuilder, actor, and Governor of California.<ref>[http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/national_world&id=8829291 Arnold Schwarzenegger talks scandal, new book with '60 Minutes']</ref>

He bought the first Hummer manufactured for civilian use in 1992, a model so large, {{convert|6300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and {{convert|7|ft|m}} wide, that it is classified as a large truck and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to it. During the gubernatorial recall campaign he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about US$21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the [[California_Hydrogen_Highway|California Hydrogen Highway Network]], and gained a [[U.S. Department of Energy]] grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thanks to Arnold, California to Pave the Hydrogen Highway |publisher=BMW World |url=http://www.usautoparts.net/bmw/hydrogen/schwarzenegger.htm |accessdate=April 18, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080316051803/http://www.usautoparts.net/bmw/hydrogen/schwarzenegger.htm| archivedate= March 16, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.<ref>{{cite web |title=HUMMER H2H Hydrogen Powered Experimental Vehicle |publisher=About.com |url=http://trucks.about.com/od/hybridcar/a/hummer_h2h.htm |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Wickell |first=Dale}}</ref>

==Honors==
Schwarzenegger's home town of [[Graz]] had its soccer stadium named ''The Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium'' in his honor. It is the home of both [[Grazer AK]] and [[Sturm Graz]]. After the [[Stanley Williams]] execution and street protests in Schwarzenegger's hometown, several local politicians began a campaign to remove his name from the stadium. In response, Schwarzenegger said
"to spare the responsible politicians of the city of Graz further concern, I withdraw from them as of this day the right to use my name in association with the Liebenau Stadium", and set a deadline of two days to remove his name. Graz officials removed Schwarzenegger's name from the stadium in December 2005.<ref>{{cite news |title=Graz removes Schwarzenegger name |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4560182.stm |date=December 26, 2005 |accessdate=April 18, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080408114320/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4560182.stm| archivedate= April 08 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It is now officially titled [[UPC-Arena]].

People in [[Thal, Austria]], celebrated Schwarzenegger's 60th birthday by throwing a party. Officials proclaimed "A Day for Arnold" on July 30, 2007.
