'''Creationism''' is the [[religious belief]] that [[life]], the [[Earth]], and the [[universe]] are the [[Creation myth|creation]] of a [[supernatural]] being.

==History==
{{Main|History of creationism}}
The history of creationism is part of the [[history of religion]]s, though the term itself is modern. The term "creationist" to describe a proponent of creationism was first used by Charles Darwin in 1856.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary}}</ref> In the 1920s the term became particularly associated with Christian fundamentalist movements that insisted on a literalist interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative and likewise opposed the idea of [[human evolution]]. These groups succeeded in getting teaching of evolution banned in United States [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], then from the mid-1960s the young Earth creationists promoted the teaching of "scientific creationism" using "[[Flood geology]]" in public school science classes as support for a purely literal reading of Genesis.<ref name=encarta>"[http://encarta.msn.com/text_761580511___0/Creationism.html Creationism]" Contributed By: Ronald L. Numbers, William Coleman: Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007.

Waters]]'' (1975) ruled that teaching creationism in public schools contravened the [[Establishment Clause]] of the First Amendment, the content was stripped of overt biblical references and renamed [[creation science]]. When the court case ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' (1987) ruled that creation science similarly contravened the constitution, all references to "creation" in a draft school textbook were changed to refer to [[intelligent design]], which was subsequently claimed to be a new scientific theory. The ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Kitzmiller v. Dover]]'' (2005) ruling concluded that intelligent design is not science and contravenes the constitutional restriction on teaching religion in public school science classes.<ref name="autogenerated2" />  In September 2012, [[Bill Nye]] ("[[Bill Nye The Science Guy|The Science Guy]]") warned that ''creationist views'' threaten [[science education]] and [[innovations]] in [[The United States]].<ref name="APNews-20120924">{{cite news |last=Luvan |first=Dylan |title=Bill Nye Warns: Creation Views Threaten U.S. Science|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bill-nye-warns-creation-views-threaten-us-science|date=September 24. 2012|publisher=[[AP News]] |accessdate=September 24, 2012 }}</ref><ref name="Youtube-20120823">{{cite web |last=Fowler |first=Jonathan |last2=Rodd |first2=Elizabeth|title=Bill Nye: Creationism Is Not Appropriate For Children |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHbYJfwFgOU |date=August 23, 2012 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=September 24, 2012}}</ref>([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHbYJfwFgOU video])

===Early and medieval times===

The first century Jewish writer [[Philo]] admired the literal narrative of passages concerning the [[Patriarch]]s, but in other passages viewed the literal interpretation as being for those unable to see an underlying deeper meaning. For example, he noted that [[Moses]] said the world was created in six days, but did not consider this as a length of time as "we must think of God as doing all things simultaneously" and the six days were mentioned because of a need for order and according with a [[perfect number]]. Genesis was about real events, but God through Moses described them in figurative or allegorical language.<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/index-2.html The Works of Philo Judaeus], translated from the Greek by [[Charles Duke Yonge]]:<br>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book2.html Philo: Allegorical Interpretation, I]</ref>

To a large extent, the early Christian [[Church Fathers]] read creation history as an allegory, and followed [[Philo]]'s ideas of time beginning with an instantaneous creation, with days not meant literally. Christian orthodoxy rejected the second century [[Gnostic]] belief that Genesis was purely allegorical, but without taking a purely literal view of the texts. Thus [[Origen]] believed that the physical world is ‘literally’ a creation of God, but did not take the chronology or the days as ‘literal’. Similarly, [[Saint Basil]] in the fourth century while literal in many ways, described creation as instantaneous and timeless, being immeasurable and indivisible.<ref name=rsf/>

[[Augustine of Hippo]] in ''The Literal Meaning of Genesis'' was insistent that Genesis describes the creation of physical objects, but also shows creation occurring simultaneously, with the days of creation being categories for didactic reasons, a logical framework which has nothing to do with time. For him, light was the illumination of angels rather than visible light, and spiritual light was just as literal as physical light. Augustine emphasized that the text was difficult to understand and should be reinterpreted as new knowledge became available. In particular, Christians should not make absurd dogmatic interpretations of scripture which contradict what people know from physical evidence.<ref name=AUGUSTINE>{{cite web|url= http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1988/PSCF3-88Young.html |title=The contemporary relevance of Augustine |author=Davis A. Young |year=1988 |work=Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith |publisher= |pages= |accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref>

In the 13th century [[Thomas Aquinas]], like Augustine, asserted the need to hold the truth of Scripture without wavering while cautioning "that since Holy Scripture can be explained in a multiplicity of senses, one should not adhere to a particular explanation, only in such measure as to be ready to abandon it if it be proved with certainty to be false; lest holy Scripture be exposed to the ridicule of unbelievers, and obstacles be placed to their believing."<ref name=rsf/>

===Impact of the Reformation===
From 1517 the [[Protestant Reformation]] brought a new emphasis on lay literacy, with [[Martin Luther]] advocating the idea that creation took six literal days about [[dating creation|6000 years ago]], and claiming that "Moses wrote that uneducated men might have clear accounts of creation".{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} [[John Calvin]] also rejected instantaneous creation, but criticised those who, contradicting the contemporary understanding of nature, asserted that there are "waters above the heavens".<ref name=rsf/>

Discoveries of new lands brought knowledge of a huge diversity of life, and a new belief developed that each of these biological species had been individually created by God. In 1605 [[Francis Bacon]] emphasized that the works of God in nature teach us how to interpret the word of God in the Bible, and his [[Baconian method]] introduced the empirical approach which became central to modern science.<ref name=moore>{{cite web| last = Moore | first = James | authorlink = James Moore (biographer) | title = Evolution and Wonder - Understanding Charles Darwin | work = Speaking of Faith (Radio Program) | publisher = American Public Media | url =http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/darwin/transcript.shtml | accessdate = 2007-06-27 }}</ref> [[Natural theology]] developed the study of nature with the expectation of finding evidence supporting Christianity, and numerous attempts were made to reconcile new knowledge with the biblical [[Deluge myth]] and story of [[Noah's Ark]].<ref name=floodgeol>[http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p82.htm History of the Collapse of "Flood Geology" and a Young Earth], adapted from ''The Biblical Flood: A Case Study of the Church's Response to Extrabiblical Evidence'' (Eerdmans, 1995) by Davis A. Young. Retrieved 2007-06-30.</ref>

In 1650 the [[Archbishop]] of [[Armagh]], [[James Ussher]], published the [[Ussher chronology]] based on Bible history giving a date for Creation of 4004 BC. This was generally accepted, but the development of modern [[geology]] in the 18th and 19th centuries found [[geological strata]] and [[fossilization|fossil]] sequences indicating an ancient Earth. [[Catastrophism]] was favoured in England as supporting the biblical flood, but this was found to be untenable<ref name=floodgeol/> and by 1850 all geologists and most Evangelical Christians had adopted various forms of [[old Earth creationism]], while continuing to firmly reject [[evolution]].<ref name=rsf/>{{failed verification|date=December 2010}}

===Modern science===
{{Main|History of evolutionary thought}}
{{See also|History of science}}
From around the start of the 19th century, ideas such as [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's]] concept of [[transmutation of species]] had gained a small number of supporters in Paris and [[Edinburgh]], mostly amongst anatomists.<ref name=rsf/> The anonymous publication of ''[[Vestiges of Creation]]'' in 1844 aroused wide public interest with support from [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], but was strongly criticised by the [[scientific community]], which  emphasized the need for solidly backed science. In 1859  [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' provided that evidence from an authoritative and respected source, and within a decade or so convinced scientists that [[evolution]] occurs. This acceptance was resisted by conservative evangelicals in the [[Church of England]], but their attention quickly turned to the much greater uproar about ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' by [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Anglican theologians]], which introduced into the controversy "[[the higher criticism]]" begun by [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] centuries earlier. This book re-examined the Bible and cast doubt on a literal interpretation.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Desmond | first = Adrian | last2 = Moore | first2 = James | author2-link = James Moore (biographer) | year = 1991 | title = Darwin | place = London | publisher =Michael Joseph, Penguin Group | isbn = 0-7181-3430-3}}</ref> By 1875 most American [[natural history|naturalists]] supported ideas of [[theistic evolution]], often involving [[special creation]] of human beings.<ref name=encarta/>

At this time those holding that [[species]] had been separately created were generally called "advocates of creation", but they were occasionally called "creationists" in private correspondence between Darwin and his friends.<ref name=num /> The term appears in letters Darwin wrote between 1856 and 1863,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-1919 |title=Letter 1919 — Darwin, C.

==Creationism internationally==
Creationism is widely accepted and taught throughout the Middle East. Although it has been prominent in the United States but not widely accepted in academia, it has been making a resurgence in other countries as well.<ref name=Discover>{{Cite journal|last=Pitock |first=Todd |year=2007 |month=June |title=Science and Islam |journal=Discover |volume= |issue= |pages=36–45}}</ref><ref name=TBO>{{cite news|author=[[Gregory Katz]] |title= Clash Over Creationism Is Evolving In Europe's Schools|url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/feb/16/na-clash-over-creationism-is-evolving-in-europes-s |agency=Associated Press |date= 2008-02-16|accessdate=2008-02-17}}/</ref><ref name="NCSE Edis">{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/rncse/19/6/cloning-creationism-turkey |title= Cloning Creationism in Turkey |accessdate=2008-02-17 |author=Taner Edis |work=RNCSE 19 (6): 30-35 |publisher=National Center for Science Education}}</ref>

===Europe===
In recent years the teaching of creationism has become a minor issue in a variety of countries including [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]] and [[Serbia]].<ref name=TBO/><ref name="NCSE Edis"/><ref>{{Cite news|title=Serbia reverses Darwin suspension |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3642460.stm|publisher=BBC |date=2004-09-09 |accessdate=2008-02-17 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|author= Roger Highfield |title=Creationists rewrite natural history |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/earth/2007/10/02/scihist102.xml |publisher=The Telegraph |date=2007-02-10 |accessdate=2008-02-17 | location=London |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071008075725/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/earth/2007/10/02/scihist102.xml |archivedate= 2007-10-08}}</ref>

Creation science has been heavily promoted in immigrant communities in Western Europe, primarily by [[Adnan Oktar]] (also known as Harun Yahya).<ref name="NCSE Edis"/> On 17 September 2007, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted [[Creation and evolution in public education#Council of Europe|The dangers of creationism in education]], a resolution on the attempt by American-inspired creationists to promote creationism in European schools. It concludes "The war on the theory of evolution and on its proponents most often originates in forms of religious extremism closely linked to extreme right-wing political movements... some advocates of creationism are out to replace democracy by theocracy... If we are not careful, the values that are the very essence of the Council of Europe will be under direct threat from creationist fundamentalists".<ref>[http://assembly.coe.int/main.asp?link=/documents/adoptedtext/ta07/eres1580.htm Resolution 1580 (2007) The dangers of creationism in education] [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], paras. 13, 18</ref>

====Germany====
In 1978, British Professor [[A.E. Wilder-Smith]], who came to Germany after World War II and lectured at Marburg and other cities, published a book arguing against evolution with a secular, well known publishing house, titled "The Natural Sciences Know Nothing of Evolution."<ref>A.E. Wilder-Smith, Die Naturwissenschaften kennen keine Evolution, 1978, Schwabe Verlag, Basel.</ref> At the end of the year Horst W. Beck became a creationist. Both an engineer and theologian, he was a leading figure in the already mentioned "Karl-Heim-Gesellschaft" and had previously published articles and books defending theistic evolution. Together with other members of the society, which they soon left, he followed the arguments of Willem Ouweneel, a Dutch biologist lecturing in Germany. Beck soon found other scientists who had changed their view or were "hidden" creationists. Under his leadership, the first creationist society was founded ("Wort und Wissen"—Word and Knowledge). Three book series were soon published, an independent creationist monthly journal started ("Factum"), and the first German article in the Creation Research Society Quarterly was published.<ref>Factum. "Schwengeler Verlag, Postfach 263, CH-9435 Heerbrugg."</ref>

In 2006, a documentary on the [[Arte]] television network, ''Von Göttern und Designern'' ("Genesis vs. Darwin") by filmmaker [[Frank Papenbroock]] demonstrated that creationism had already been taught in biology classes in at least two schools in [[Gießen, Hessen]], without this being noticed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/schulspiegel/0,1518,445487,00.html |title=Hessische Schulen: "Kultusministerin fällt auf Kreationisten herein" - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten - SchulSPIEGEL |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref> During this, the Education Minister of Hessen, Karin Wolff, said she believed creationism should be taught in biology class as a theory, like the theory of evolution: "I think it makes sense to bring up multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary problems for discussion".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2222454,00.html |title=German Scientists Concerned About Rise in Creationist Belief &#124; Germany &#124; Deutsche Welle &#124; 02.11.2006 |publisher=Dw-world.de |date= |accessdate=2010-10-29}}</ref> " Approximately 20% of people disbelieve evolutionary theory in [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,609712,00.html |title=Contesting Evolution: European Creationists Take On Darwin - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News - International |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2010-10-29}}</ref>

====Romania====
In [[Romania]], in 2002, the Ministry of Education approved the use of a biology book endorsing creationism, entitled ''Divine Mastery and Light in the Biosphere'', in public high schools. Following a protest of the Romanian Humanist Association the Romanian Ministry of Education replied that the book is not a "textbook" but merely an "accessory." The president of the Association labeled the reply as "disappointing" since, whether a textbook or an accessory, the book remains available for usage in schools. Reports indicate that at least one teacher, in [[Oradea]] did use the book.<ref>{{cite web |title=Carte creaţionistă pentru biologie, avizată de minister |publisher= Evz.ro |date= March 20, 2009 |url=http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/844190/Carte-creationista-pentru-biologie-avizata-de-minister/ |accessdate= }}</ref>

Evolution was omitted entirely from school textbooks in most of the United States until the 1960s. Since then, renewed efforts to introduce teaching [[Creation and evolution in public education|creationism in American public schools]] in the form of [[flood geology]], [[creation science]], and [[intelligent design]] have been consistently held to contravene the [[U.S. Constitution|constitutional]] [[separation of Church and State]] by a succession of legal judgments.<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm Creationism/ID, A Short Legal History] By Lenny Flank, Talk Reason</ref> The meaning of the term creationism was contested, but by the 1980s it had been co-opted by proponents of creation science and flood geology.<ref name=num/>

Most of the anti-evolutionists of the 1920s believed in forms of [[Old Earth creationism]], which accepts geological findings and other methods of dating the earth and believes that these findings do not contradict Genesis, but rejects evolution.  At that time only a minority held to [[Young Earth creationism]], proponents of which believe that the Earth is thousands rather than billions of years old, and typically believe that the days in chapter one of Genesis are 24 hours in length. In the 1960s this became the most prominent form of anti-evolution. From the 1860s forms of [[theistic evolution]] had developed; this term refers to beliefs in creation which are compatible with the scientific view of evolution and the age of the Earth, as held by mainstream Christian denominations. There are other religious people who support creationism, but in terms of allegorical interpretations of Genesis.

By the start of the 20th century, evolution was widely accepted and was beginning to be taught in U.S. [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]].

In 1981 the state of Arkansas passed a law, Act 590, mandating that "creation science" be given equal time in public schools with evolution, and defining creation science as positing the "creation of the universe, energy, and life from nothing," as well as explaining the earth’s geology by "the occurrence of a worldwide flood".<ref name=mclean/> This was ruled unconstitutional at ''[[McLean v.

The report found that Americans who are less educated are more likely to hold a creationist view while those with a college education are more likely to hold a view involving evolution. 47% of those with no more than a high school education believe in creationism while 22% of those with a post graduate education hold that view. The poll also found that church attendance dramatically increased adherence to a strict creationist view (22% for those who do not attend church, 60% for those who attend weekly).<ref name="gallup">{{cite news |title=Four in 10 Americans Believe in Strict Creationism |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/145286/Four-Americans-Believe-Strict-Creationism.aspx |last=Newport |first=Frank |publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] |date=December 17, 2010}}</ref> The higher percentage of Republicans who identified with a creationist view is described as evidence of the strong relationship between religion and politics in the United States.

Among US states, acceptance of evolution has a strong negative correlation with [[religiosity]] and a strong positive relationship with science degrees awarded, bachelor degree attainment, advanced degree attainment, average teacher salary, and GDP per capita. In other words, states in which more people say that religion is very important to their lives tend to show less acceptance of evolution. The better the education of individuals, their educational system, or the higher their income, the more they accept evolution, though the US as a country has a comparatively well educated population but lower acceptance of evolution than other countries.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heddy|first=B.C.|coauthors=Nadelson, L.S.|title=The variables related to public acceptance of evolution in the United States|journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach|year=2013|volume=6|issue=3|pages=1–14|url=http://www.evolution-outreach.com/content/6/1/3|accessdate=28 March 2013|doi=10.1186/1936-6434-6-3}}</ref>

Creationist movements exist among peoples with various religious perspectives such as [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].

</ref><ref>See also the article [[Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church]].
</ref> churches have made statements in favor of evolutionary theory, as have scholars such as the physicist [[John Polkinghorne]], who argues that evolution is one of the principles through which God created living beings. Earlier supporters of evolutionary theory include [[Frederick Temple]], Asa Gray and [[Charles Kingsley]] who were enthusiastic supporters of Darwin's theories upon their publication,<ref>see e.g. [[John Polkinghorne]]'s ''Science and Theology'' pp6-7</ref> and the French Jesuit priest and [[geology|geologist]] [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] saw evolution as confirmation of his Christian beliefs, despite condemnation from Church authorities for his more speculative theories. Another example is that of [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal theology]], not providing any creation models, but instead focusing on the [[symbol]]ism in beliefs of the time of authoring Genesis and the cultural environment.

Many Christians and Jews had been considering the idea of the creation history as an allegory (instead of historical) long before the development of Darwin's theory of evolution. For example, the first century Jewish neoplatonic philosopher [[Philo]] of Alexandria, whose works were taken up by early Church writers, wrote that it would be a mistake to think that creation happened in six days, or in any set amount of time.<ref name="www.earlychurch.org.uk">{{cite web  | last = Bradshaw | first = Rob | title = Philo of Alexandria (c.20 BC - c.

In the United States, Evangelical Christians have continued to believe in a literal Genesis. Members of Protestant (70%), Mormon (76%) and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (90%) denominations are the most likely to reject the evolutionary interpretation of the origins of life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report2religious-landscape-study-chapter-2.pdf |title=Pugh Forum findings Page 95 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}</ref> The historic Christian literal interpretation of creation requires the harmonization of the two creation stories, Genesis 1:1-2:3 and Genesis 2:4-25, for there to be a consistent interpretation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/2194 |title= Are There Two Creation Accounts in Genesis? |author=Wayne Jackson |accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/paulntobin/creationint.html |title=The Creation Myths: Internal Difficulties |accessdate=2007-05-23|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080715071138/http://www.geocities.com/paulntobin/creationint.html|archivedate=2008-07-15}}</ref> They sometimes seek to ensure that their belief is taught in [[science]] classes, mainly in American schools.

Christian Science, a system of thought and practice derived from the writings of [[Mary Baker Eddy]], interprets Genesis figuratively rather than literally. It holds that the material world is an illusion, and consequently not created by God: the only real creation is the spiritual realm, of which the material world is a distorted version. Christian Scientists regard the story of the creation in the Book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] as having symbolic rather than literal meaning. According to Christian Science,  both creationism and evolution are false from an absolute or "spiritual" point of view, as they both proceed from a (false) belief in the reality of a material universe. However, Christian Scientists do not oppose the teaching of evolution in schools, nor do they demand that alternative accounts be taught: they believe that both material science and literalist theology are concerned with the illusory, mortal and material, rather than the real, immortal and spiritual. In regards to material theories of creation, Mary Baker Eddy showed a preference for Darwin's Theory of Evolution over others.<ref name=S&Hp547>{{cite book| last =Eddy| first =Mary Baker| title =Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures| publisher =The Christian Science Board of Directors| date =1934 [1875]| location =United States of America| page =547}}</ref>

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Hindu views on evolution}}

According to Hindu creationism all [[species]] on earth including [[humans]] have "devolved" or come down from a highly state of pure [[consciousness]]{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}. Hindu creationists claim that species of [[plants]] and [[animals]] are material forms adopted by pure consciousness which live an endless cycle of births and rebirths.<ref>Science & Religion: A New Introduction, Alister E. McGrath, 2009, p. 140</ref> [[Ronald Numbers]] says that: "Hindu Creationists have insisted on the antiquity of humans, who they believe appeared fully formed as long, perhaps, as trillions of years ago."<ref>The creationists: from scientific creationism to intelligent design, Ronald L. Numbers, 2006, p. 420</ref> Hindu creationism is a form of [[old earth creationism]], according to Hindu creationists the [[universe]] may even be older than billions of years. These views are based on the [[Vedas]] which depict an extreme antiquity of the universe and history of the [[earth]].<ref>James C. Carper, Thomas C.

===Islam===
{{Main|Islamic views on evolution}}

Islamic creationism is the belief that the [[universe]] (including [[human race|humanity]]) was directly created by [[God in Islam|God]] as explained in the [[Qur'an]]. It usually views Genesis as a corrupted version of God's message. The creation myths in the Qur'an are vaguer and allow for a wider range of interpretations similar to those in other [[Abrahamic religions]]. Most Muslims accept the scientific positions on the age of the earth and the age of the universe.

Islam also has its own school of [[theistic evolution]]ism, which holds that mainstream scientific analysis of the origin of the universe is supported by the Qur'an. Some Muslims believe in evolutionary creation, especially among [[liberal movements within Islam]].

[[Khalid Anees]], president of the [[Islamic Society of Britain]], at a conference called 'Creationism: Science and Faith in Schools', made points including the following:<ref name=guardian0104>{{Cite news|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/conferences/story/0,,1117752,00.html|title=Creationism: Science and Faith in Schools|date=2004-01-07|work=Guardian|first=David |last=Papineau |accessdate=2008-07-18 | location=London}}</ref> There is no contradiction between what is revealed in the [[Qur'an]] and [[natural selection]] and [[survival of the fittest]]. "Without a Book of Genesis to account for ... Muslim creationists have little interest in proving that the age of the Earth is measured in the thousands rather than the billions of years, nor do they show much interest in the problem of the dinosaurs. And the idea that animals might evolve into other animals also tends to be less controversial, in part because there are passages of the Koran that seem to support it. But the issue of whether human beings are the product of evolution is just as fraught among Muslims."<ref>{{harvnb|Bennett|2009}}</ref> However, some Muslims, such as [[Adnan Oktar]], do not agree that one species can develop from another.<ref name="PrizeforFossil">{{Cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/creationist-offers-prize-for-fossil-proof-of-evolution-945289.html | title=Creationist offers prize for fossil proof of evolution | publisher=[[The Independent]] |date= 29 September 2008 | first= Toby| last= Green| accessdate =2007-05-17 | location=London}}</ref>

But there is also a growing movement of [[Islamic creationism]]. Similar to Christian creationism, there is concern regarding the perceived conflicts between the [[Qur'an]] and the main points of [[evolution]]ary theory. The main location for this has been in Turkey, where fewer than 25% of people believe in evolution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templeton-cambridge.org/fellows/showfellow.php?fellow=36 |title=Templeton-Cambridge.org |publisher=Templeton-Cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}</ref>

There are several verses in the Qur'an which some modern writers have interpreted as being compatible with the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]], [[Big Bang]] and [[Big Crunch]] theories:<ref>[[Harun Yahya]], [http://www.harunyahya.com/articles/70big_bang.html The Big Bang Echoes through the Map of the Galaxy]</ref><ref>[[Maurice Bucaille]] (1990), ''The Bible the Qur'an and Science'', "The Quran and Modern Science", ISBN 81-7101-132-2.</ref><ref>A. Abd-Allah, [http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/scislam.html The Qur'an, Knowledge, and Science], [[University of Southern California]].</ref>

<blockquote>"Do not the Unbelievers see that the skies (space) and the earth were joined together, then We (Allah) clove them asunder and We (Allah) created every living thing out of the water. Will they not then believe?"{{Quran-usc|21|30}}</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Then turned He to the sky (space) when it was smoke, and said unto it and unto the earth: Come both of you, willingly or loth. They said: We come, obedient."{{Quran-usc|41|11}}</blockquote>

<blockquote>"And it is We (Allah) Who have constructed the sky (space) with might, and it is We (Allah) Who are steadily expanding it."{{Quran-usc|51|47}}</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the day when We (Allah) will roll up the sky (space) like the rolling up of the scroll for writings, as We (Allah) originated the first creation, (so) We (Allah) shall reproduce it; a promise (binding on Us); surely We will bring it about."{{Quran-usc|21|104}}</blockquote>

The [[Ahmadiyya]] Movement is perhaps the only denomination in Islam that actively promotes [[evolution]]ary theory.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://textonly.itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html |title= Jesus and the Indian Messiah 13.Every Wind of Doctrine |website= Into The Light |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071009221553/http://textonly.itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html |archivedate= 2007-10-09}}</ref>
Ahmadis interpret scripture from the Qur'an to support the concept of [[macroevolution]] and give precedence to scientific theories. Furthermore, unlike more orthodox Muslims, Ahmadis believe that mankind has gradually evolved from different species. Ahmadis regard [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] as being the first Prophet of God{{spaced ndash}}as opposed to him being the first man on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090130070102/http://textonly.itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Replay.waybackmachine.org |date=2009-01-30 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref>
Rather than wholly adopting the theory of [[natural selection]], Ahmadis promote the idea of a "guided evolution", viewing each stage of the evolutionary process as having been selectively woven by God.<ref>http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/Guided_evolution_and_punctuated_equilibrium-20081104MN.pdf</ref> [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], Fourth [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] has stated in his magnum opus ''[[Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth]]'' that evolution did occur but only through [[God]] being the One who brings it about. It does not occur itself, according to the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]].

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish views on evolution}}

Reform Judaism does not take the [[Torah]] as a literal text, but rather as a symbolic or open-ended work. For Orthodox Jews who seek to reconcile discrepancies between science and the Bible, the notion that science and the Bible should even be reconciled through traditional scientific means is questioned. To these groups, science is as true as the Torah and if there seems to be a problem, our own [[epistemological]] limits are to blame for any apparent irreconcilable point. They point to various discrepancies between what is expected and what actually is to demonstrate that things are not always as they appear. They point out the fact that the even root word for "world" in the [[Hebrew language]] — עולם (Olam) — means hidden — נעלם (Neh-Eh-Lahm). Just as they believe God created man and trees and the light on its way from the stars in their adult state, so too can they believe that the world was created in its "adult" state, with the understanding that there are, and can be, no physical ways to verify it. This belief has been advanced by Rabbi Dr. Dovid Gottlieb, former philosophy professor at Johns Hopkins University. Also, relatively old Kabbalistic sources from well before the scientifically apparent age of the universe was first determined are in close concord with modern scientific estimates of the age of the universe, according to Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]], and based on Sefer Temunah, an early kabbalistic work attributed to the 1st century [[Tannaim|Tanna]] Nehunya ben ha-Kanah. Many kabbalists accepted the teachings of the Sefer Temunah, including the [[Nahmanides|Ramban]], his close student [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre|Yitzhak of Akko]], and the [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|RADBAZ]]. Other interesting parallels are derived, among other sources, from [[Nachmanides]], who expounds that there was a [[Neanderthal]]-like species with which [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] mated (he did this long before Neanderthals had even been discovered scientifically).<ref>Aviezer, Nathan.

===Baha'i===
Bahaullah, the Baha'i faith Founder, taught that the universe has "neither beginning nor ending", and that the component elements of the material world have always existed and will always exist.<ref>{{harvnb|Effendi|1912|p=[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/pup-79.html#gr8 220]}}</ref> In regards to evolution and the origin of human beings, [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] gave extensive comments on the subject when he addressed western audiences in the beginning of the 20th century. Transcripts of these comments can be found in ''[[Some Answered Questions]]'', ''[[Paris Talks]]'' and the ''[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/ Promulgation of Universal Peace]''.  `Abdu'l-Bahá described the human species as having evolved from a primitive form to modern man, but that the capacity to form human intelligence was always in existence.

==Types of creationism==

===Young-Earth creationism===
{{Main|Young Earth creationism}}
Young-Earth creationism fosters the belief that [[God]] created the Earth within the last ten thousand years, literally as described in the [[Genesis creation narrative]], within the approximate time-frame of biblical genealogies (detailed for example in the [[Ussher chronology]]). Most Young-Earth creationists believe that the [[Universe]] has a similar age as the Earth. A few assign a much older age to the [[Universe]] than to Earth. Some{{which|date=September 2012}} creationist thinkers attempt with [[Creationist cosmologies]] to give the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other Young-Earth time frames. Other Young-Earth creationists believe that the Earth and the universe were created with the appearance of age, so that the world appears to be much older than it is, and that this appearance is what gives the geological findings and other methods of dating the earth and the universe their much longer [[timeline]]s. However, this view has theological implications - an intentional appearance of age is form of [[false evidence]] and so a form of deception.

The Christian organizations [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) and the [[Creation Research Society]] (CRS) both promote Young-Earth creationism in the USA. Another organization with similar views, [[Answers in Genesis]] (AIG) Ministries - based in both the US and United Kingdom - has opened a [[Answers in Genesis#Creation Museum|Creation Museum]] to promote Young-Earth creationism. [[Creation Ministries International]] promotes Young-Earth views in Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Among Catholics, the [[List of Catholic creationist organisations|Kolbe Center]] for the Study of Creation promotes similar ideas.

====Creation science====
{{Main|Creation science}}
Creation science, or initially scientific creationism, emerged in the 1960s with proponents aiming to have young Earth creationist beliefs taught in school science classes as a counter to teaching of evolution. It is the attempt to present scientific evidence interpreted with Genesis axioms that supports the claims of creationism. Various claims of creation scientists include such ideas as [[creationist cosmologies]] which accommodate a universe on the order of thousands of years old, attacks on the science of [[radiometric dating]] through a technical argument about [[radiohalo]]s, explanations for the [[fossil record]] as a record of the destruction of the [[global flood]] recorded in [[Book of Genesis]] (see [[flood geology]]), and explanations for the present [[biodiversity|diversity]] as a result of pre-designed genetic variability and partially due to the rapid degradation of the perfect [[genome]]s God placed in "[[created kinds]]" or "Baramin" (see [[creation biology]]) due to [[mutations]].

===Old Earth creationism===
{{Main|Old Earth creationism}}
Old Earth creationism holds that the [[universe|physical universe]] was created by God, but that the creation event of Genesis is not to be taken strictly literally. This group generally believes that the [[age of the Universe]] and the age of the Earth are as described by [[astronomers]] and [[geologists]], but that details of [[evolution|modern evolutionary theory]] are questionable.

Old-Earth creationism itself comes in at least three types:

====Gap creationism====
{{Main|Gap creationism}}
Gap creationism, also called "Restitution creationism", holds that life was recently created on a pre-existing old Earth. This theory relies on a particular interpretation of {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:1-2}}. It is considered that the words [[Tohu wa-bohu|''formless'' and ''void'']] in fact denote waste and ruin, taking into account the original Hebrew and other places these words are used in the [[Old Testament]]. Genesis 1:1-2 is consequently translated:

: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." (Original act of creation.)
: "And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."

Thus, the six days of creation (verse 3 onwards) start sometime after the Earth was "without form and void." This allows an indefinite "gap" of time to be inserted after the original creation of the universe, but prior to the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation according to Genesis]], (when present biological species and humanity were created). Gap theorists can therefore agree with the scientific consensus regarding the age of the Earth and universe, while maintaining a literal interpretation of the biblical text.

Some{{which?|date=November 2013}} gap theorists expand the basic theory by proposing a "primordial creation" of biological life within the "gap" of time. This is thought to be "the world that then was" mentioned in [[2 Peter]] 3:3-7.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Holy Bible, King James Version | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=68&chapter=3&version=9 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 }}</ref> Discoveries of [[fossil]]s and archaeological ruins older than 10,000 years are generally ascribed to this "world that then was", which may also be associated with [[Lucifer]]'s rebellion. These views became popular with publications of Hebrew Lexicons such as the [[Strong's Concordance]], and Bible commentaries such as the ''[[Scofield Reference Bible]]'' and the [[E. W. Bullinger|Companion Bible]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

====Day-Age creationism====
{{Main|Day-Age creationism}}
Day-Age creationism states that the "six days" of [[Book of Genesis]] are not ordinary 24-hour days, but rather much longer periods (for instance, each "day" could be the equivalent of millions, or billions of years of human time). This theory often states that the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word "yôm", in the context of Genesis 1, can be properly interpreted as "age." Some{{which|date=September 2013}} adherents claim we are still living in the seventh age ("seventh day").

Strictly speaking, Day-Age creationism is not so much a creationist theory as a [[hermeneutic]] option which may be combined with theories such as progressive creationism.

====Progressive creationism====
{{Main|Progressive creationism}}
Progressive creationism holds that species have changed or evolved in a process continuously guided by God, with various ideas as to how the process operated—though it is generally taken that God directly intervened in the natural order at key moments in Earth/life's history. This view accepts most of modern physical science including the [[age of the earth]], but rejects much of modern [[evolutionary biology]] or looks to it for evidence that [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] alone is incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Organizations such as [[Reasons To Believe]], founded by [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], promote this theory.

Progressive creationism can be held in conjunction with [[hermeneutic]] approaches to the [[Genesis creation narrative]] such as the [[Day-age creationism|day-age theory]] or [[Framework view|framework]]/metaphoric/poetic views.

===Neo-Creationism===
{{Main|Neo-Creationism}}
Neo-Creationists intentionally distance themselves from other forms of creationism, preferring to be known as wholly separate from creationism as a philosophy.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Neo-Creationism aims to re-state creationism in terms more likely to be well received by the public, education-policy makers and the [[scientific community]]. It aims to re-frame the debate over the [[Creation myth|origins of life]] in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture, and to bring the debate before the public.

Neo-Creationism sees ostensibly [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] [[orthodox science]] as a dogmatically [[atheism|atheistic]] [[religion]]. Neo-Creationists argue that the [[scientific method]] excludes certain explanations of phenomena, particularly where they point towards supernatural elements. They argue that this effectively excludes any possible religious insight from contributing to a scientific understanding of the [[universe]]. Neo-Creationists also argue that science, as an "atheistic enterprise", lies at the root of many of contemporary society's ills including social unrest and family breakdown.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The [[Intelligent Design movement]] arguably represents the most recognized form of Neo-Creationism in the United States. Unlike their philosophical forebears, Neo-Creationists largely do not believe in many of the traditional cornerstones of creationism such as a [[Young Earth creationism|young Earth]], or in a dogmatically [[Biblical inerrancy|literal interpretation of the Bible]]. Common to all forms of Neo-Creationism is a rejection of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, usually made together with a tacit admission of [[supernaturalism]], and an open and often hostile opposition to what they term "[[Darwinism]]", meaning [[evolution]].

====Intelligent design====
{{Main|Intelligent design}}

Intelligent design (ID) is the claim that "certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as [[natural selection]]".<ref name=DIposition>{{cite web|url=http://www.discovery.org/csc/topQuestions.php#questionsAboutIntelligentDesign|title=Top Questions-1.What is the theory of intelligent design?|publisher=[[Discovery Institute]]|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> All of its leading proponents are associated with the [[Discovery Institute]],<ref>[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day6pm.html Kitzmiller v.

ID originated as a re-branding of [[creation science]] in an attempt to get round a series of court decisions ruling out the teaching of creationism in U.S. public schools, and the Discovery Institute has run [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|a series of campaigns]] to change school curricula.<ref name="autogenerated2"/> In Australia, where curricula are under the control of State governments rather than local school boards, there was a public outcry when the notion of ID being taught in science classes was raised by the Federal Education Minister [[Brendan Nelson]]; the minister quickly conceded that the correct forum for ID, if it were to be taught, is in religious or philosophy classes.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/intelligent-design-not-science-experts/2005/10/20/1129775902661.html ''Intelligent design not science: experts''], Deborah Smith Science Editor, [[Sydney Morning Herald]], October 21, 2005.</ref>

In the United States, teaching of Intelligent Design in public schools has been decisively ruled by a Federal District court to be in violation of the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. In [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], the court found that intelligent design is not science and "cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents.", and hence cannot be taught as an alternative to [[evolution]] in public school science classrooms under the jurisdiction of that court. This sets a [[persuasive precedent]], based on previous Supreme Court decisions in [[Edwards v. Aguillard]] and [[Epperson v. Arkansas]], and by the application of the [[Lemon v. Kurtzman|Lemon test]], that creates a legal hurdle to teaching Intelligent Design in public school districts in other Federal court jurisdictions.<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref name=kitz>[[s:Kitzmiller v.

===Theistic evolution (evolutionary creation) ===
{{Main|Theistic evolution}}

Theistic evolution, or evolutionary creation, asserts that "the personal God of the Bible created the universe and life through evolutionary processes."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Feist|first1=Richard|last2=Sweet|first2=William |title=Religion and the Challenges of Science |url=http://books.google.com/?id=qwaRUNj6S34C&pg=PA48&dq=theistic+evolution+evolutionary+creation#v=onepage&q=theistic%20evolution%20evolutionary%20creation&f=false|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|quote=Evolutionary Creation (or Theistic Evolution) asserts that the personal God of the Bible created the universe and life through evolutionary processes.|isbn=9780754687443}}</ref> According to the [[American Scientific Affiliation]]:

Through the 19th century the term ''creationism'' most commonly referred to [[Creationism (soul)|direct creation of individual souls]], in contrast to [[traducianism]]. Following the publication of ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation|Vestiges]]'' there was interest in ideas of Creation by divine law. In particular, the [[liberal Christianity|liberal theologian]] [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] argued that this illustrated the Creator's power better than the idea of miraculous creation, which he thought ridiculous.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=139}}</ref> When ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was published, the cleric [[Charles Kingsley]] wrote of evolution as "just as noble a conception of Deity".<ref name=Darwinanddesign>{{Cite book|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-design-article |title=Darwin and design: historical essay |year=2007 |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2534.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project - Letter 2534 — Kingsley, Charles to Darwin, C.

Eventually it was realised that supernatural intervention could not be a scientific explanation, and naturalistic mechanisms such as [[neo-Lamarckism]] were favoured as being more compatible with purpose than natural selection.<ref name=bowl202>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=202–208}}</ref>

Some theists took the general view that, instead of faith being in opposition to biological evolution, some or all classical religious teachings about [[Christian God]] and [[creation myth|creation]] are compatible with some or all of modern [[scientific theory]], including specifically [[evolution]]; it is also known as "evolutionary creation". In Evolution versus Creationism, [[Eugenie Scott]] and Niles Eldredge state that it is in fact a type of evolution.<ref>''Evolution Vs. Creationism'', [[Eugenie Scott]], Niles Eldredge, p62-63</ref>

It generally views evolution as a tool used by God, who is both the [[first cause]] and [[Immanence|immanent]] sustainer/upholder of the universe; it is therefore well accepted by people of strong [[theism|theistic]] (as opposed to [[deism|deistic]]) convictions. Theistic evolution can synthesize with the [[day-age creationism|day-age]] interpretation of the [[Genesis creation narrative]]; however most adherents consider that the first chapters of Genesis should not be interpreted as a "literal" description, but rather as a [[framework view|literary framework]] or [[allegory]].

From a theistic viewpoint, the underlying laws of nature were designed by God for a purpose, and are so self-sufficient that the complexity of the entire physical universe evolved from fundamental particles in processes such as [[stellar evolution]], life forms developed in biological evolution, and in the same way the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life by natural causes]] has resulted from these laws.<ref name="The Origin of Life">{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/originoflife.html#intro |title=The Origin of Life |author=Albrecht Moritz |date=October 31, 2006 |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref>

In one form or another, theistic evolution is the view of creation taught at the majority of mainline [[Protestantism|Protestant]] seminaries<ref>[http://ncse.com/evolution/education/science-religion-evolution Science, Religion, and Evolution] by [[Eugenie Scott]] (accessed at 2007-07-09).</ref> For Catholics, [[human evolution]] is not a matter of religious teaching, and must stand or fall on its own scientific merits. [[Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church]] are not in conflict. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] comments positively on the theory of evolution, which is neither precluded nor required by the sources of faith, stating that scientific studies "have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, the development of life-forms and the appearance of man."<ref>{{Cite news| last = Akin| first = Jimmy| title=Evolution and the Magisterium| newspaper =This Rock| date=January 2004| url =http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2004/0401bt.asp| accessdate =2007-08-15}}</ref> Roman Catholic schools teach evolution without controversy on the basis that scientific knowledge does not extend beyond the physical, and scientific truth and religious truth cannot be in conflict.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_21_41/ai_n13592804/print |title=National Catholic Reporter: Catholic schools steer clear of anti-evolution bias |accessdate=2007-08-15 |author=Jeff Severns Guntzel | work=National Catholic Reporter | year=2005}}</ref> Theistic evolution can be described as "creationism" in holding that divine intervention brought about the origin of life or that divine Laws govern formation of species, though many creationists (in the strict sense) would deny that the position is creationism at all.

[[George Coyne]], (Vatican's chief astronomer between 1978 and 2006):<blockquote>...in America, creationism has come to mean some fundamentalistic, literal, scientific interpretation of Genesis. Judaic-Christian faith is radically creationist, but in a totally different sense.

While supporting the [[naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]] inherent in modern science, the proponents of theistic evolution reject the implication taken by some [[atheism|atheists]] that this gives credence to [[Ontology|ontological]] [[materialism]].

===Obscure and largely discounted beliefs===
{{Main|Geocentrism|Flat Earth Society}}
The 17th century position of the Roman Catholic Church was that God recently created a spherical world, and placed it as an immobile location in the center of the universe.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The [[Sun]], [[planets]] and everything else in the universe revolve around it once per day. 
The members of the Flat Earth Society hold that a literal interpretation of the Bible demands that the Earth is a disk with the North Pole at the center and a wall of ice at the Antarctic rim.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} The famous pictures of a spherical Earth taken from space are claimed by members to be either hoaxes or illusions.

===Omphalos hypothesis===
{{Main|Omphalos hypothesis}}
The Omphalos hypothesis argues that in order for the world to be functional, God must have created a mature [[Earth]] with mountains and canyons, rock strata, trees with growth rings, and so on; therefore ''no'' evidence that we can see of the presumed age of the earth and [[age of the universe|universe]] can be taken as reliable.<ref>Gosse, Henry Philip, 1857.

Most vocal literalist creationists are from the United States, and strict creationist views are much less common in other developed countries. According to a study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', a survey of the United States, Turkey, Japan and Europe showed that public acceptance of evolution is most prevalent in Iceland, Denmark and Sweden at 80% of the population.<ref name="Science survey"/>

===Australia===
A 2009 Nielsen poll showed that almost a quarter of Australians believe "the biblical account of human origins" rather than the Darwinian account. Forty-two percent believe in a "wholly scientific" explanation for the origins of life, while 32 percent believe in an evolutionary process "guided by God".<ref>

===Europe===
In Europe, literalist creationism is more widely rejected, though regular opinion polls are not available. Most people accept that evolution is the most widely accepted scientific theory as taught in most schools. In countries with a [[Roman Catholic]] majority, [[Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church|papal acceptance of evolutionary creationism]] as worthy of study has essentially ended debate on the matter for many people.

In the United Kingdom, a 2006 poll on the "origin and development of life" asked participants to choose between three different perspectives on the origin of life: 22% chose creationism, 17% opted for intelligent design, 48% selected evolutionary theory, and the rest did not know.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4648598.stm "Britons unconvinced on evolution"], ''[[BBC News]]'', 26 January 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=262 "BBC Survey On The Origins Of Life"], [[Ipsos MORI]] for ''[[BBC Horizon]]'', 30 January 2006</ref> A subsequent 2010 [[YouGov]] poll on the correct

[[Poland]] saw a major controversy over creationism in 2006 when the deputy education minister, [[Mirosław Orzechowski]], denounced evolution as "one of many lies" taught in Polish schools. His superior, Minister of Education [[Roman Giertych]], has stated that the theory of evolution would continue to be taught in Polish schools, "as long as most scientists in our country say that it is the right theory." Giertych's father, [[Member of the European Parliament]] [[Maciej Giertych]], has opposed the teaching of evolution and has claimed that [[dinosaur]]s and humans co-existed.<ref>"[http://www.wbj.pl/?command=article&id=35336&type=wbj And finally...]", ''[[Warsaw Business Journal]]'', 18 December 2006</ref>

====Education controversies====
[[File:Truth fish.jpg|thumb|right|The Truth fish, one of the many creationist responses to the [[Parodies of the ichthys symbol|Darwin fish]].]]
{{Main|Creation–evolution controversy}}
In the United States, creationism has become centered in the [[politics|political]] [[creation-evolution controversy|controversy]] over [[creation and evolution in public education]], and whether teaching creationism in science classes conflicts with the [[separation of church and state]]. Currently, the controversy comes in the form of whether advocates of the [[Intelligent Design movement]] who wish to "[[Teach the Controversy]]" in science classes have conflated [[religion and science|science with religion]].<ref name="kitz"/>

[[People for the American Way]] polled 1500 North Americans about the teaching of evolution and creationism in November and December 1999. They found that most North Americans were not familiar with Creationism, and most North Americans had heard of evolution, but many did not fully understand the basics of the theory. The main findings were:
{{bar box
|title= Americans believe that:<ref name="pfaw"/>
|bars=
{{bar percent|Public schools should teach evolution only|silver|60|20%}}
{{bar percent|Only evolution should be taught in science classes, religious explanations can be discussed in another class|gray|51|17%}}
{{bar percent|Creationism can be discussed in science class as a 'belief,' not a scientific theory|silver|87|29%}}

{{bar percent|Teach both evolution and Creationism, but unsure how to do so|gray|12|4%}}
{{bar percent|No opinion|silver|3|1%}}
}}

In such political contexts, creationists argue that their particular religiously based origin belief is superior to those of other [[belief systems]], in particular those made through secular or scientific rationale. Political creationists are opposed by many individuals and organizations who have made detailed critiques and given testimony in various court cases that the [[objections to evolution|alternatives to scientific reasoning offered by creationists]] are opposed by the [[scientific consensus|consensus]] of the [[scientific community]].<ref name="aaas">{{cite web|url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf|title=Statement on the Teaching of Evolution|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|format=PDF|year=2006|accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref><ref>"99.9 percent of scientists accept evolution" [http://www.nih.gov/nihrecord/07_28_2006/story03.htm Finding the Evolution in Medicine] [[National Institutes of Health]]</ref>

==Criticism==

===Christian criticism===
Many Christians disagree with the teaching of creationism. Several religious organizations, among them the [[Catholic Church and evolution|Catholic Church]], hold that their faith does not conflict with the scientific consensus regarding evolution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/media/voices/religion |title=National Center for Science Education: Statements from Religious Organizations |publisher=Ncse.com |date=2003-10-14 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}</ref> The [[Clergy Letter Project]], which has collected more than 13,000 signatures, is an "endeavor designed to demonstrate that religion and science can be compatible".

In his 2002 article "Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem", George Murphy argues against the view that [[life on Earth]], in all its forms, is direct evidence of God's act of creation (Murphy quotes Phillip Johnson's claim that he is speaking "of a God who acted openly and left his fingerprints on all the evidence."). Murphy argues that this view of God is incompatible with the Christian understanding of God as "the one revealed in the cross and resurrection of [[Jesus]]." The basis of this theology is [[Isaiah]] 45:15, "Truly, thou art a God who hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Savior."

Murphy observes that the execution of a Jewish carpenter by Roman authorities is in and of itself an ordinary event and did not require Divine action. On the contrary, for the crucifixion to occur, God had to limit or "empty" Himself. It was for this reason that Paul wrote, in Philippians 2:5-8,
:Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross.

Murphy concludes that,<blockquote>Just as the son of God limited himself by taking human form and dying on the cross, God limits divine action in the world to be in accord with rational laws God has chosen. This enables us to understand the world on its own terms, but it also means that natural processes hide God from scientific observation.</blockquote>For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a [[Methodological naturalism|''methodological'' naturalism]], meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a [[Metaphysical naturalism|''metaphysical'' naturalism]], which proposes that nature is all that there is.<ref>Murphy, George L., 2002, "Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem," in ''Covalence: the Bulletin of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Alliance for Faith, Science, and Technology''</ref>

===Teaching of creationism===
Other Christians have expressed qualms about teaching creationism. In March 2006, then Archbishop of Canterbury [[Rowan Williams]], the leader of the world's Anglicans, stated his discomfort about teaching creationism, saying that creationism was "a kind of [[category mistake]], as if the Bible were a theory like other theories". He also said: "My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it." The views of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] - a major American-based branch of the [[Anglican Communion]] - on teaching creationism resemble those of Williams.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,,1735730,00.html publisher=The Guardian |title=Archbishop: Stop teaching creationism, Williams backs science over Bible (See transcript of Guardian interview for primary source) |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130301052433/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/mar/21/religion.topstories3 |archivedate= 2013-03-01}}</ref>

In April 2010 the [[American Academy of Religion]] issued ''Guidelines for Teaching About Religion in K‐12 Public Schools in the United States'' which included guidance that [[creation science]] or [[intelligent design]] should not be taught in science classes, as "Creation science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall outside of the realm of science that is defined as (and limited to) a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning." However, they, as well as other "worldviews that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life represent another important and relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in literature or social sciences courses. Such study, however, must include a diversity of worldviews representing a variety of religious and philosophical perspectives and must avoid privileging one view as more legitimate than others."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/news/2010/07/american-academy-religion-teaching-creationism-005712 |title=American Academy of Religion on teaching creationism |date=July 23, 2010 |publisher=National Center for Science Education |quote= |accessdate=2010-08-09}}</ref>

Moore and Cotner, from the biology program at the University of Minnesota, reflect on the relevance of teaching creationism in the article ''The Creationist Down the Hall: Does It Matter When Teachers Teach Creationism?'' They conclude that "despite decades of science education reform, numerous legal decisions declaring the teaching of creationism in public-school science classes to be unconstitutional, overwhelming evidence supporting evolution, and the many denunciations of creationism as nonscientific by professional scientific societies, creationism remains popular throughout the United States."<ref>{{cite journal | title = The Creationist Down the Hall: Does It Matter When Teachers Teach Creationism? | journal = BioScience | date = May 2009 | first = Randy | last = Moore | coauthors = Sehoya Cotner | volume = 59 | issue = 5 | pages = 429–435 | doi = 10.1525/bio.2009.59.5.10}}</ref>

===Scientific criticism===
{{Main|Creation&ndash;evolution controversy}}

Science is a system of knowledge based on observation, empirical evidence and testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena. By contrast, creationism is based on literal interpretations of the narratives of particular religious texts. Some creationist beliefs involve purported forces that lie outside of nature, such as supernatural intervention, and often do not allow predictions at all. Therefore, these can neither be confirmed nor disproved by scientists.<ref name=SEaC>{{Cite book|author=Committee on Revising Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Sciences and Institute of Medicine of the National Academies |authorlink=United States National Academies |editor= |others= |title=Science, Evolution, and Creationism |edition=free pdf download |publisher=[[National Academies Press]] |location=Washington, D.C. |year=2008 |origyear= |pages=10–12 |quote=In science, explanations must be based on naturally occurring phenomena. Natural causes are, in principle, reproducible and therefore can be checked independently by others. If explanations are based on purported forces that are outside of nature, scientists have no way of either confirming or disproving those explanations. |isbn=0-309-10586-2 |oclc= |doi= |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11876.html |accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> However, many creationist beliefs can be framed as testable predictions about phenomena such as the [[age of the Earth]], its [[geological history of Earth|geological history]] and the [[Abiogenesis|origins]], [[biogeography|distributions]] and [[phylogeny|relationships]] of living organisms found on it. [[Protoscience|Early science]] incorporated elements of these beliefs, but as science developed these beliefs were gradually [[Falsifiability|falsified]] and were replaced with understandings based on accumulated and reproducible evidence that often allows the accurate prediction of future results.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/index.html |title=An Index to Creationist Claims |work= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biologi.kva.se/Arkivet/FutuymaCh22final.pdf |title=Evolutionary Science, Creationism, and Society |format=PDF |work="Evolution" (2005)|last=Futuyma |first=Douglas J. |accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref> Some scientists, such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]],<ref name=RoA>Gould, S. J. (2002). ''[[Rocks of Ages|Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life]]''. New York: Ballantine Books.</ref> consider science and religion to be two compatible and complementary fields, with authorities in distinct areas of human experience, so-called [[non-overlapping magisteria]].<ref>{{Cite journal|first = Stephen Jay|last = Gould|year = 1997|url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html|title = Nonoverlapping Magisteria|journal = Natural History|volume = 106|pages = 16–22|issue = 3|ref = harv}}</ref> This view is also held by many theologians, who believe that [[primum movens|ultimate origins]] and [[meaning of life|meaning]] are addressed by religion, but favour verifiable scientific explanations of natural phenomena over those of creationist beliefs. Other scientists, such as [[Richard Dawkins]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The God Delusion |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Transworld Publishers |isbn=0-593-05548-9 |location= |page=5 }}</ref> reject the non-overlapping magisteria and argue that, in disproving literal interpretations of creationists, the scientific method also undermines religious texts as a source of truth. Irrespective of this diversity in viewpoints, since creationist beliefs are not supported by empirical evidence, the [[scientific consensus]] is that any attempt to teach creationism as science should be rejected.<ref>{{Cite news| title =Royal Society statement on evolution, creationism and intelligent design | publisher =The Royal Society | date =2006-04-11 | url =http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/news.asp?year=&id=4298 | accessdate =2007-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title = 10 Significant Court Decisions Regarding Evolution/Creationism | publisher =[[National Center for Science Education]] |last= Matsumura |first=Molleen |coauthors=Mead, Louise | date =2007-07-31 | url = http://ncse.com/taking-action/ten-major-court-cases-evolution-creationism | accessdate =2008-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| title = Ann Coulter: No Evidence for Evolution? | publisher = ScienceBlogs | journal = Pharyngula |last= Myers |first= PZ | date =2006-02-15 | url = http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/ann_coulter_no_evidence_for_ev.php | accessdate =2007-09-12 | ref = harv}}</ref>
