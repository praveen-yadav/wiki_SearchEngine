{{distinguish|mass noun}}

In [[linguistics]], a '''collective noun''' is the name of a number (or collection) of people or things taken together and spoken of as one whole. For example, in the phrase "a pride of lions", ''pride''  is a collective noun.

Most collective nouns encountered in everyday speech, such as "group", are mundane and are not specific to one kind of constituent object.  For example, the terms "group of people", "group of dogs", and "group of ideas" are all correct uses. Others, especially words belonging to the large subset of collective nouns known as ''terms of venery'' (words for groups of animals), are specific to one kind of constituent object.  For example, "pride" as a term of venery refers to lions, but not to [[dog]]s or [[cow]]s.

Collective nouns should not be confused with [[mass noun]]s, or with the [[Singulative number|collective grammatical number]].

== Derivational collectives ==

Derivation accounts for many collective words. Because derivation is a slower and less productive [[word formation]] process than the more overtly [[Syntax|syntactical]] morphological methods, there are fewer collectives formed  this way. As with all derived words, derivational collectives often differ [[Semantics|semantically]] from the original words, acquiring new [[connotation]]s and even new [[denotation]]s.

The English endings ''-age'' and ''-ade'' often signify a collective. Sometimes the relationship is easily recognizable: ''baggage, drainage, blockade.'' However, even though the etymology is plain to see, the derived words take on quite a special meaning.

[[German language|German]] uses the [[prefix]] ''Ge-'' to create collectives.  The root word often undergoes [[I-mutation|umlaut]] and [[suffix]]ation as well as receiving the ''Ge-'' prefix. Nearly all nouns created in this way are of [[neuter gender]]. Examples include:

* ''das Gebirge,'' "group of mountains, mountain range", from ''der Berg,'' "mountain"
* ''das Gepäck,'' "luggage, baggage" from ''der Pack,'' "pack, bundle, pile"
* ''das Geflügel,'' "poultry, fowl (birds)" from late [[Middle High German|MHG]] ''gevlügel(e),'' under the influence of ''der Flügel,'' "wing",  from MHG ''gevügel,'' from [[OHG]] ''gifugili'' = collective formation, from ''fogal,'' "bird"
* ''das Gefieder,'' "plumage" from ''die Feder,'' "feather"

In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] one example is the different words for [[mosquito]]s in the collective form and in the individual form:
# ''[[wikt:mygga|mygga]]'' (individual mosquito), plural: ''[[wikt:myggor|myggor]]''
# ''[[wikt:mygg|mygg]]'' (mosquitos as a collective)

==Metonymic merging of grammatical number==

{{main|Synesis|Plurale tantum}}

Two good examples of collective nouns are "team" and "government", which are both words referring to groups of (usually) people. Both "team" and "government" are [[count noun]]s. (Consider: "one team", "two teams", "most teams"; "one government", "two governments", "many governments"). However, confusion often stems from the fact that plural verb forms are often used in [[British English]] with the singular forms of these count nouns (for example: "The team have finished the project."). Conversely, in the English language as a whole, singular verb forms can often be used with nouns ending in "-s" that were once considered plural (for example: "Physics is my favorite academic subject"). This apparent "number mismatch" is actually a quite natural and logical feature of human language, and its mechanism is a subtle [[metonymy|metonymic]] shift in the thoughts underlying the words.

In British English, it is generally accepted that collective nouns can take either singular or plural verb forms depending on the context and the metonymic shift that it implies. For example, "the team is in the dressing room" (''formal agreement'') refers to ''the team'' as an ensemble, whilst "the team are fighting among themselves" (''notional agreement'') refers to ''the team'' as individuals. This is also British English practice with names of countries and cities in sports contexts; for example, "Germany have won the competition.", "Madrid have lost three consecutive matches.", etc. In [[American English]], collective nouns almost invariably take singular verb forms (formal agreement). In cases where a metonymic shift would be otherwise revealed nearby, the whole sentence may be recast to avoid the metonymy. (For example, "The team are fighting among themselves" may become "the team ''members'' are fighting among themselves" or simply "The team is fighting.") See [[American and British English differences#Formal and notional agreement|American and British English differences - Formal and notional agreement]].

A good example of such a metonymic shift in the singular-to-plural direction (which, generally speaking, only occurs in British English) is the following sentence: "The team have finished the project." In that sentence, the underlying thought is of the individual members of the team working together to finish the project. Their accomplishment is collective, and the emphasis is not on their individual identities, yet they are at the same time still discrete individuals; the word choice "team have" manages to convey both their collective and discrete identities simultaneously. A good example of such a metonymic shift in the plural-to-singular direction is the following sentence: "Mathematics is my favorite academic subject." The word "mathematics" may have originally been plural in concept, referring to mathematic endeavors, but metonymic shift—that is, the shift in concept from "the endeavors" to "the whole set of endeavors"—produced the usage of "mathematics" as a singular entity taking singular verb forms. (A true [[mass noun|mass-noun]] sense of "mathematics" followed naturally.)

Nominally singular pronouns can be collective nouns taking plural verbs, according to the same rules that apply to other collective nouns.  For example, it is correct [[British English]] or [[American English]] usage to say:  "None are so fallible as those who are sure they're right."  In this case, the plural verb is used because the context for "none" suggests more than one thing or person.<ref>Strunk & White, The Elements of Style (4th ed., 2000), p. 10.</ref>

==Terms of venery (words for groups of animals)==
{{further|List of collective nouns}}
The tradition of using "terms of venery" or "nouns of assembly"—collective nouns that are specific to certain kinds of animals—stems from an [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[Medieval hunting|hunting tradition]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]].
The fashion of a consciously developed hunting language came to England from [[medieval France|France]]. It is marked by an extensive proliferation of specialist vocabulary, applying different names to the same feature in different animals. 
These elements can be shown to have already been part of French and English hunting terminology by the beginning of the 14th century. In the course of the 14th century, it became a courtly fashion to extend the vocabulary, and by the 15th century, this tendency had reached exaggerated proportions.
The ''Venerie'' of Twiti (early 14th century) distinguished three types of droppings of animals, and three different terms for herds of animals. [[Gaston Phoebus]] (14th century) had five terms for droppings of animals, which were extended to seven in the ''Master of the Game'' (early 15th century).  The focus on collective terms for groups of animals emerges in the later 15th century.  Thus, a list of collective nouns in Egerton MS 1995, dated to c. 1452 under the heading of ''termis of venery &c.'' extends to 70 items,<ref>David Dalby, ''Lexicon of the Mediaeval German Hunt: A Lexicon of Middle High German Terms (1050-1500), Associated with the Chase, Hunting with Bows, Falconry, Trapping and Fowling'', Walter de Gruyter, 1965, ISBN 978-3-11-081860-4, p. xli.</ref>   and the list in the  ''[[Book of Saint Albans]]'' (1486) runs to 165 items, many of  which, even though introduced by ''the compaynys of beestys and fowlys'',  do not  relate  to venery but to human groups and professions and are clearly humorous. (''a Doctryne of doctoris, a Sentence of Juges, a Fightyng of beggers, an uncredibilite of Cocoldis, a Melody of harpers, a Gagle of women, a Disworship of Scottis'' etc.)<ref>1901 facsimile reprint,  E. Stock, London ([http://archive.org/stream/bokeofsaintalban00bernuoft#page/114/mode/2up pp. 115-117).]</ref>

Volume 26, Issue 3, pages 79–175, August 1909
</ref>

The ''Book of Saint Albans'' became very popular during the 16th century and was reprinted frequently. [[Gervase Markham]] edited and commented on the list in his ''The Gentleman's Academic'' in 1595.  The book's popularity had the effect of perpetuating many of these terms as part of the [[Standard English]] lexicon, even though they have long ceased to have any practical application.<ref name=Todd&Hancock>{{cite book | last = Todd | first = Loreto | coauthor = Hancock, Ian | year = 1986 | title = International English Usage | publisher = Psychology Press | pages = 133–134 | isbn = 0-415-05102-9 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=iccd5KAUnYQC&pg=PA133 | accessdate = 2011-04-04}}</ref> 
Even in their original context of medieval venery, the terms were of the nature of [[kenning]]s, intended as a mark of erudition of the gentlemen able to use them correctly rather than for practical communication.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The popularity of these terms in the early modern and modern period has resulted in the addition of numerous light-hearted, humorous or  "facetious"<ref>{{cite book | last = Harris | first = Theodore L. | coauthor = Hodges, Richard E. | year = 1995 | title = The Literacy Dictionary | publisher = International Reading Association | page = 271 | isbn = 0-87207-138-3 | accessdate = 2011-04-04}}</ref> collective nouns.
