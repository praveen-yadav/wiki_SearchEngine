'''Bodmin Moor''' ({{lang-kw|'''Goon Brenn'''}})<ref>[http://www.magakernow.org.uk/default.aspx?page=520 Place-names in the Standard Written Form (SWF)] : [http://www.magakernow.org.uk/idoc.ashx?docid=79ba408d-7c02-499e-8cd6-b18dd48de58d&version=-1 List of place-names agreed by the MAGA Signage Panel]. [[Cornish Language Partnership]].</ref> is a [[granite]] [[moorland]] in northeastern [[Cornwall]], England, United Kingdom. It is {{convert|208|km2|sqmi}} in size, and dates from the [[Carboniferous]] period of [[geology|geological]] history. 

Bodmin Moor is one of five [[granite]] [[plutons]] in Cornwall that make up part of the [[Cornubian batholith]]<ref>[http://petrology.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/3/571] Charoy, B. (1986) ''Genesis of the Cornubian Batholith (South West England): the example of the Carnmenellis Pluton'' in: ''Journal of Petrology''; 1986 Oxford: OUP</ref> (see also [[Geology of Cornwall]]).

The name 'Bodmin Moor' is relatively recent, being an [[Ordnance Survey]] invention of 1813. It was formerly known as '''Fowey Moor''' after the [[River Fowey]] which rises within it.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of the English Parish: the culture of religion from Augustine to Victoria | first= Norman John Greville |last= Pounds| publisher= Cambridge University Press | year= 2000 | isbn= 978-0-521-63351-2 | pages= 593}}; p. 72</ref>

==Geography==
Dramatic granite [[tor (rock formation)|tor]]s rise from the rolling moorland: the best known are [[Brown Willy]], the highest point in Cornwall at {{convert|417|m|ft|abbr=on}},<ref>[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/Cornwall/ GENUKI: Cornwall<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and [[Rough Tor]] at {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}}. To the south-east [[Kilmar Tor]] and [[Caradon Hill]] are the most prominent hills. Considerable areas of the moor are poorly drained and form marshes (in hot summers these can dry out). The rest of the moor is mostly rough pasture or overgrown with heather and other low vegetation.

The moor contains about 500 holdings with around 10,000 beef cows, 55,000 breeding ewes and 1,000 horses and ponies.<ref>[http://www.bodminmoor.co.uk/history.html The Bodmin Moor Pages ~ The History]</ref> Most of the moor is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI), ''Bodmin Moor, North'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Bodmin Moor, North|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002227.pdf|publisher=[[Natural England]]|accessdate=26 October 2011|year=1991}}</ref> and has been officially designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB), as part of [[Cornwall AONB]].<ref>http://www.cornwall-aonb.gov.uk/documents/12_bodmin_character.pdf</ref> Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park.  The moor has been identified by [[BirdLife International]] as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) because it supports about 260 breeding pairs of [[European Stonechat]]s as well as a wintering population of 10,000 [[Eurasian Golden Plover]]s.<ref name=bli>{{cite web |url= http://www.birdlife.org |title= Bodmin Moor |accessdate=2013-04-19 |work= Important Bird Areas factsheet |first= |last= |publisher= BirdLife International |year= 2013}}</ref> The moor has also be recognized as a separate [[natural region]] and designated as [[National Character Area]] 153 by [[Natural England]].<ref>[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/publications/nca/bodmin_moor.aspx ''153 Bodmin Moor''] at www.naturalengland.org.uk.

Bodmin Moor is the source of several of Cornwall's rivers: they are mentioned here anti-clockwise from the south. 

The [[River Fowey]] rises at a height of {{convert|290|m|ft|abbr=on}} and flows through [[Lostwithiel]] and into the [[Fowey]] estuary.<ref>[http://www.cornwallriversproject.org.uk/geography/fowey.htm Cornwall Rivers Project|Geography | Fowey and Lerryn<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  

The [[River Tiddy]] rises near Pensilva and flows southeast to its confluence with the [[River Lynher]] (the Lynher flows generally south-east until it joins the [[Hamoaze]] near Plymouth). The [[River Inny, Cornwall|River Inny]] rises near [[Davidstow]] and flows southeast to its confluence with the River Tamar. 

The [[River Camel]] rises on Hendraburnick Down and flows for approximately {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} before joining the sea at [[Padstow]].<ref>[http://www.cornwallriversproject.org.uk/geography/camel.htm Cornwall Rivers Project | Geography | Camel and Allen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The River Camel and its tributary the [[De Lank River]] are an important habitat for the otter and both have been proposed as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC)<ref>[http://www.bodminmoor.co.uk/rivers.html The Rivers of Bodmin Moor - The Bodmin Moor Pages<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The De Lank River rises near [[Roughtor]] and flows along an irregular course before joining the Camel south of Wenford. 

The River Warleggan rises near [[Temple, Cornwall|Temple]] and flows south to join the Fowey.

On the southern slopes of the moor lies [[Dozmary Pool]]. It is Cornwall's only natural inland lake and is glacial in origin. In the 20th century three reservoirs have been constructed on the moor; these are [[Colliford Lake]], [[Siblyback Lake]] and [[Crowdy Reservoir|Crowdy reservoir]]s which supply water for a large part of the county's population. Various species of waterfowl are resident around these waters.<ref>Bere, Rennie (1982) ''The Nature of Cornwall''. Buckingham: Barracuda Books, pp. 63-67</ref>

==History and antiquities==
=== Prehistoric times ===
[[Image:King arthurs hall.JPG|thumb|right|[[King Arthur's Hall]]]]
[[File:Kilmar Tor - geograph.org.uk - 7112.jpg|[[Kilmar Tor]]|thumb]]
10,000 years ago, in the [[Mesolithic]] period, [[hunter-gatherers]] wandered the moor when it was wooded and had a temperate climate. There are several documented cases of flint scatters being discovered by [[archaeology|archaeologists]], indicating that these hunter gatherers practised [[flint knapping]] in the region.<ref>Tilley, C. (1996) "The Power of Rocks: landscape and topography on Bodmin Moor", in: ''World Archaeology''; 28, p. 165</ref> 

During the [[Neolithic]] era, from about 4,500 to 2,300 BC, people began clearing trees and farming the land. It was also in this era that the production of various [[megaliths|megalithic]] monuments began, predominantly long [[cairn]]s (three of which have currently been identified, at Louden, Catshole and Bearah) and [[stone circles]] (sixteen of which have been identified). It was also likely that the naturally forming [[tor (rock formation)|tor]]s were also viewed in a similar manner to the manmade ceremonial sites.<ref name="Tilley, C 1996">Tilley, C. (1996) "The Power of Rocks: landscape and topography on Bodmin Moor", in: ''World Archaeology''; 28, pp. 151-176</ref>

In the following [[Bronze Age]], the creation of monuments increased dramatically, with the production of over 300 further cairns, and more stone circles and stone rows.<ref name="Tilley, C 1996"/> More than 200 [[Bronze Age]] settlements with [[Enclosure (archaeology)|enclosures]] and field patterns have been recorded.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2007_bod_t.html channel4.com - Time Team - Bodmin Moor, Cornwall - text only<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and many prehistoric stone [[tumulus|barrows]] and [[stone circle|circles]] lie scattered across the moor.  In a programme shown in 2007 [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Time Team]] ''investigated a 500 metre cairn and the site of a Bronze Age village on the slopes of [[Rough Tor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2007_bod_found.html|title=Bodmin Moor, Cornwall|date=8 April 2007|work=Channel 4: Time Team|accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref>

[[King Arthur's Hall]] thought to be a late [[Neolithic]] or early [[Bronze Age]] ceremonial site can be found to the east of [[St Breward]] on the moor.<ref>[http://www.whitedragon.org.uk/articles/secretcornwall.htm Secret Cornwall; Bodmin Moor and its environs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=== Medieval and modern times ===
[[File:Hawk's Tor.jpg|thumb|[[Hawk's Tor]], north of Temple]]
Where practicable areas of the moor were used for pasture by herdsmen from the parishes surrounding the moor. Granite boulders were also taken from the moor and used for stone posts and to a certain extent for building (such material is known as moorstone).<ref>Clifton-Taylor, A. "Building materials" in: Pevsner, N. (1970) ''Cornwall''. 2nd ed. Penguin Books, p. 29-34</ref> Granite quarrying only became reasonably productive when gunpowder became available.

The moor gave its name (Foweymore) to one of the medieval districts called [[Stannary|stannaries]] which administered tin mining: the boundaries of these were never defined precisely. Until the establishment of a turnpike road through the moor (the present [[A30 road|A30]]) in the 1770s the size of the moorland area made travel within Cornwall very difficult.

Its Cornish name, Goen Bren, is first recorded in the 12th century.<ref>Weatherhill, Craig (2009) ''A Concise Dictionary of Cornish Place-names''. Westport, co. Mayo: Evertype; p. 6</ref>

===Monuments and ruins===
Roughtor was the site of a medieval chapel of St Michael and is now designated as a memorial to the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division|43rd Wessex Division]] of the British Army. In 1844 on Bodmin Moor the body of 18 year old Charlotte Dymond was discovered. Local labourer Matthew Weeks was accused of the murder and at noon on 12 August 1844 he was led from [[Bodmin Gaol]] and hanged. The murder site now has a monument erected from public money and the grave is at  [[Davidstow]] churchyard.<ref>[http://www.parmaq.com/truecrime/CharlotteDymond.htm The Murder of Charlotte Dymond]</ref>

==Legends and traditions==
[[Dozmary Pool]] is identified by some people with the lake in which, according to [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legend, [[Bedivere|Sir Bedivere]] threw [[Excalibur]] to [[The Lady of the Lake]].<ref>''Cornish Archaeology''; No 34, 1995</ref> Another legend relating to the pool concerns [[Jan Tregeagle]].

The [[Beast of Bodmin]] has been reported many times but never identified with certainty.
