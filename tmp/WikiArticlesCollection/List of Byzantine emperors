This is a '''list of the Byzantine emperors''' from the foundation of Constantinople in 330 AD, which marks the conventional start of the East Roman or [[Byzantine Empire]], to its [[Fall of Constantinople|fall]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453 AD. Only the emperors who were recognized as legitimate rulers and exercised sovereign authority are included, to the exclusion of junior co-emperors (''symbasileis'') who never attained the status of sole or senior ruler, as well as of the [[List of Byzantine usurpers|various usurpers or rebels]] who claimed the imperial title.

Traditionally, the line of Byzantine emperors is held to begin with the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian emperor, who rebuilt the city of [[Byzantium]] as an imperial capital, Constantinople, and who was regarded by the later Byzantine emperors as the model ruler.  His predecessor [[Diocletian]] is sometimes considered the first "Byzantine" Emperor in a political sense, as he replaced the republican trappings of the [[Principate]] with the absolutist [[Dominate]], a more typically oriental and [[Hellenistic]] form of [[autocracy|autocratic]] monarchy that would characterize the Empire. It was under Constantine, however, that the major characteristics of the Byzantine state emerged: a Roman polity centered at Constantinople and culturally dominated by the [[Greek East]], with Christianity as the state religion.

All Byzantine emperors regarded themselves as "Roman Emperors,"<ref>{{cite web |last=Hooker |first=Richard |title=The Byzantine Empire. Middle Ages. World Cultures |date=4 June 2007 |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MA/BYZ.HTM }}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> the term "Byzantine" being coined by Western [[historiography]] in the 16th century, and in spite of the later [[Pope|Papal]] coronation of the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Charlemagne]] as the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]] (25 December 800 CE) after the coronation of [[Irene of Athens|Empress Irene]], whose claim, as a woman, was not recognized by [[Pope Leo III]].

The [[Style (manner of address)|title]] of all Emperors preceding [[Heraclius]] was officially "''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''," although other titles such as ''[[Dominus (title)|Dominus]]'' were also used.  Their names were preceded by ''[[Imperator]] [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' and followed by ''Augustus''.   Following Heraclius, the title commonly became the Greek ''[[Basileus]]'' (Gr. Βασιλεύς), which had formerly meant [[Monarch|sovereign]] but was then used in place of ''Augustus''.  Following the establishment of the rival [[Holy Roman Empire]] in Western Europe, the title "''[[Autokrator]]''" (Gr. Αυτοκράτωρ) was increasingly used.  In later centuries, the Emperor could be referred to by Western Christians as the "Emperor of the Greeks." Towards the end of the Empire, they referred to themselves as "[Emperor's name] in Christ, Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans."

In the medieval period, [[dynasty|dynasties]] were common, but the principle of [[hereditary succession]] was never formalized in the Empire,<ref>p. 183, Karayannopoulous, Yanis, "State Organization, Social Structure, Economy, and Commerce," ''History of Hunamity - Scientific and Cultural Development from the Seventh to the Sixteenth Centuries, Vol. IV,'' M. A. Al-Bakhit, L. Bazin, S. M. Cissoko and M. S. Asimov, Editors, UNESCO, Paris (2000)</ref> and hereditary succession was a custom rather than an inviolable principle.<ref>Nicol, Donald MacGillivray, ''Last Centuries of Byzantium, 1261-1453'', Cambridge University Press, Second Edition, 1993, p. 72: "Hereditary succession to the throne was a custom or a convenience in Byzantium, not an inviolable principle. Emperors, particularly in the later period, would take pains to nominate their sons as co-emperors, for the rule of a dynasty made for stability and continuity. But in theory, the road to the throne was a ''carriere ouverte aux talents'' [career open to talents]..."</ref>

Including the Palaiologan dynasty, claimed Byzantine Emperors in exile, there were a total of 99 Emperors of the thousand-year-old Roman Empire.

He was the first emperor to be crowned by the Patriarch of Constantinople. His reign was marked by the pacification of the Danube frontier and peace with Persia, which allowed him to intervene in the affairs of the [[Western Roman Empire|western empire]], supporting candidates for the throne and dispatching an [[Battle of Cape Bon (468)|expedition]] to recover [[Carthage]] from the [[Vandals]] in 468. Initially a puppet of Aspar, Leo began promoting the [[Isaurians]] as a counterweight to Aspar's Goths, marrying his daughter [[Ariadne (empress)|Ariadne]] to the Isaurian leader [[Tarasicodissa]] (Zeno).

He was named co-emperor by his son on 9 February 474, and became sole ruler upon the latter's death, but had to flee to his native country before [[Basiliscus]] in 475, regaining control of the capital in 476. Zeno concluded peace with the [[Vandals]], saw off challenges against him by [[Illus]] and [[Verina]], and secured peace in the [[Balkans]] by enticing the [[Ostrogoths]] under [[Theodoric the Great]] to migrate to Italy.
