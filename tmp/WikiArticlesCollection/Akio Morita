'''Akio Morita''' (盛田 昭夫 ''Morita Akio'', January 26, 1921 in [[Nagoya|Nagoya, Aichi]] &ndash; October 3, 1999 in Tokyo) was a Japanese businessman and co-founder of [[Sony]] along with [[Masaru Ibuka]].

==Early life==
Akio Morita was born in [[Nagoya|Nagoya, Aichi]], Japan. Morita's family was involved in [[sake]], [[miso]] and [[soy sauce]] production in the village of Kosugaya (currently a part of [[Tokoname, Aichi|Tokoname City]]) on the western coast of [[Chita Peninsula]] in [[Aichi Prefecture]] since 1665. He was the oldest of four siblings and his father Kyuzaemon trained him as a child to take over the family business. Akio, however, found his true calling in mathematics and physics, and in 1944 he graduated from [[Osaka University|Osaka Imperial University]] with a degree in physics. He was later commissioned as a Lieutenant in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], and served in [[World War II]]. During his service, Morita met his future business partner Masaru Ibuka in the Navy's Wartime Research Committee.

==Sony==
On May 7, 1946, Morita and Ibuka founded ''Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha'' (Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, the forerunner of Sony Corporation) with about 20 employees and initial capital of ¥190,000. Ibuka was 38 years old, Morita, 25. Morita's family invested in Sony during the early period and was the largest shareholder.

In 1949, the company developed magnetic recording tape and in 1950, sold the first [[tape recorder]] in Japan. In 1957, it produced a pocket-sized radio (the first to be fully [[transistor]]ized), and in 1958, Morita and Ibuka decided to rename their company Sony (derived from "sonus"--[[Latin]] for "sound"—and ''Sonny-boys'' the most common American expression).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Akio_Morita |title=Akio Morita |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> Morita was an advocate for all the products made by [[Sony]]. However, since the radio was slightly too big to fit in a shirt pocket, Morita made his employees wear shirts with slightly larger pockets to give the radio a "pocket sized" appearance. In 1960, it produced the first [[transistor]] television in the world. In 1973, Sony received an [[Emmy Award]] for its [[Trinitron]] television-set technology. In 1975, it released the first [[Betamax]] home video recorder, a year before [[VHS]] format came out. In 1979, the [[Walkman]] was introduced, making it the world's first portable music player. In 1984, Sony launched the [[Discman]] series which extended their Walkman brand to portable CD products.

In 1960, the Sony Corporation of America (SONAM, currently abbreviated as SCA) was established in the United States. In 1961, Sony Corporation was the first Japanese company to be listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], in the form of [[American depositary receipt]]s (ADRs), which are traded over-the-counter. Sony bought CBS Records Group<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-19/business/fi-22750_1_cbs-records</ref>  which consisted of [[Columbia Records]], [[Epic Records]] and other CBS labels in 1988 and Columbia Pictures Entertainment ([[Columbia Pictures]], [[TriStar Pictures]] and others) in 1989.

On November 25, 1994, Morita stepped down as Sony chairman after suffering a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] while playing tennis. He was succeeded by [[Norio Ohga]], who had joined the company in the 1950s after sending Morita a letter denouncing the poor quality of the company's tape recorders.

==Other affiliations==
Morita was vice chairman of the [[Japan Business Federation]] ([[Japan Federation of Economic Organizations]]), and was a member of the Japan-U.S. Economic Relations Group, also known as the "Wise Men's Group". He was also the third Japanese chairman of the [[Trilateral Commission]].

==Publications==
In 1966, Morita wrote a book called ''Gakureki Muyō Ron'' (学歴無用論, Never Mind School Records), where he stresses that school records are not important to success or one's business skills. In 1986, Morita wrote an autobiography titled ''[[Made in Japan (biography)|Made in Japan]]''. He co-authored the 1991 book ''[[The Japan That Can Say No]]'' with politician [[Shintaro Ishihara]], where they criticized American business practices and encouraged Japanese to take a more independent role in business and foreign affairs. The book was translated into English and caused controversy in the United States, and Morita later had his chapters removed from the English version and distanced himself from the book.<ref>City Mayors [http://www.citymayors.com/mayors/tokyo_mayor.html Shintaro Ishihara Governor of Tokyo 7 September 2012] Retrieved on September 22, 2012</ref>

==Awards==
Morita was awarded the [[Albert Medal (Royal Society of Arts)|Albert Medal]] by the United Kingdom's [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 1982, the first Japanese to receive the honor. Two years later, he received the prestigious [[Legion of Honour]], and in 1991, was awarded the First Class [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]] from the [[Akihito|Emperor of Japan]]. In 1993, he was awarded an honorary [[Order of the British Empire|British knighthood (KBE)]]. Morita received the International Distinguished Entrepreneur Award from the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1987. He was posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] in 1999.

==Death==
Morita suffered a stroke in 1993, during a game of tennis. On November 25, 1994, he stepped down as Sony chairman.
On October 3, 1999, Morita died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 78.
