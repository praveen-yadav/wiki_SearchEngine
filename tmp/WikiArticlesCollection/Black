}}'''Black''' is the [[color]] of [[coal]], [[ebony]], and of [[outer space]].  It is the darkest color, the result of the absence of or complete absorption of light. It is the opposite of [[white]] and often represents darkness in contrast with light.<ref>''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''. 5th Edition (2002): "Opposite to white: colourless from the absence or complete absorption of light. Also, so near this as to have no distinguishable colour, very dark." See also ''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'' (1964): "The darkest color". ''Le Petit Larousse Illustré'' (1997): "Se dit de la couleur la plus foncée, due à l'absence ou à l'absorption totale des rayons lumineux." ("said of the very darkest color, due to the absence or complete absorption of all rays of light.")</ref>

Black was one of the first colors used by artists in [[neolithic]] cave paintings. In the [[Roman Empire]], it became the color of mourning, and over the centuries it was frequently associated with death, evil, witches and magic. In the 14th century, it began to be worn by royalty, the clergy, judges and government officials in much of Europe. It became the color worn by English romantic poets, businessmen and statesmen in the 19th century, and a high fashion color in the 20th century.

In the Western World today, it is the color most commonly associated with mourning, the end, secrets, magic, power, violence, evil, and elegance.<ref>Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur - effets et symboliques'' (p.&nbsp;105–27).</ref>

==Etymology and language==
The word ''black'' comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''blæc'' ("black, dark", ''also'', "ink"), from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''blakkaz'' ("burned"), from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''bhleg-'' ("to burn, gleam, shine, flash"), from base *''bhel-'' ("to shine"), related to [[Old Saxon language|Old Saxon]] ''blak'' ("ink"), [[Old High German]] ''blach'' ("black"), [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''blakkr'' ("dark"), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''blaken'' ("to burn"), and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''bläck'' ("ink"). More distant cognates include [[Latin]] ''flagrare'' ("to blaze, glow, burn"), and [[Ancient Greek]] ''phlegein'' ("to burn, scorch").

The Ancient Greeks sometimes used the same word to name different colors, if they had the same intensity.  ''Kuanos''' could mean both dark blue and black.<ref name="Michel Pastoureau pg. 34">Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir - Histoire d'une couleur'', p. 34.</ref>

The Ancient Romans had two words for black:  ''ater'' was a flat, dull black, while ''niger'' was a brilliant, saturated black.  ''Ater'' has vanished from the vocabulary, but ''niger'' was the source of the country name ''Nigeria'' and the English word ''Negro''.

[[Old High German]] also had two words for black: ''swartz'' for dull black and ''blach'' for a luminous black.  These are parallelled in [[Middle English]] by the terms ''swart'' for dull black and ''blaek'' for luminous black. ''Swart'' still survives as the word s''warthy'', while ''blaek'' became the modern English ''black''.<ref name="Michel Pastoureau pg. 34"/>

==Black in history and art==

===The Ancient World===
Black was one of the first colors used in art.  The [[Lascaux Cave]] in France contains drawings of bulls and other animals drawn by [[paleolithic]] artists between 18,000 and 17,000 years ago. They began by using charcoal, and then made more vivid black pigments by burning bones or grinding a powder of [[manganese oxide]].<ref name="Michel Pastoureau pg. 34"/>

For the ancient Egyptians, black had very positive associations.  it was the color of the rich black soil flooded by the Nile. It was the color of [[Anubis]], the god of the underworld, who took the form of a black [[jackal]], and offered protection against evil to the dead.

For the ancient Greeks, black was also the color of the underworld, separated from the world of the living by the river [[Acheron]], whose water was black. Those who had committed the worst sins were sent to [[Tartarus]], the deepest and darkest level. In the center was the palace of [[Hades]], the king of the underworld, where he was seated upon a black [[ebony]] throne.

Black was one of the most important colors used by ancient Greek artists. In the 6th century BC, they began making [[black-figure pottery]] and later [[red figure pottery]], using a highly original technique. In black-figure pottery, the artist would paint figures with a glossy clay [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] on a red clay pot. When the pot was fired, the figures painted with the slip would turn black, against a red background. Later they reversed the process, painting the spaces between the figures with slip. This created magnificent red figures against a glossy black background.<ref>Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'' (p. 270).</ref>

In the social hierarchy of [[ancient Rome]], purple was the color reserved for the Emperor; red was the color worn by soldiers (red cloaks for the officers, red tunics for the soldiers); white the color worn by the priests, and black was worn by craftsmen and artisans. The black they wore was not deep and rich; the vegetable dyes used to make black were not solid or lasting, so the blacks often turned out faded gray or brown.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In [[Latin]], the word for black, ''ater'' and to darken, ''atere'',  were associated with cruelty, brutality and evil. They were the root of the English words "atrocious" and "atrocity".<ref>''Webster's New World Dctionary of the American Language'', New York: World Publishing Company (1964).</ref>

Black was also the Roman color of death and mourning. In the 2nd century BC Roman magistrates began to wear a dark toga, called a ''toga pulla'', to funeral ceremonies. Later, under the Empire, the family of the deceased also wore dark colors for a long period; then, after a banquet to mark the end of mourning, exchanged the black for a white toga. In Roman poetry, death was called the ''hora nigra'', the black hour.<ref name="Michel Pastoureau pg. 34"/>

The German and Scandinavian peoples worshipped their own goddess of the night, [[Nótt]], who crossed the sky in a chariot drawn by a black horse. They also feared [[Hel (being)|Hel]], the goddess of the kingdom of the dead, whose skin was black on one side and red on the other. They also held sacred the [[crow]]. They believed that [[Odin]], the king of the Nordic pantheon, had two black crows, Huginn and Muninn, who served as his agents, traveling the world for him, watching and listening.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir - Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;34–45.</ref>

===The Middle Ages===
In the early Middle Ages, black was commonly associated with darkness and evil. In Medieval paintings, the devil was usually depicted as having human form, but with wings and black skin or hair.<ref>Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 272.</ref>

In fashion, black did not have the prestige of red, the color of the nobility. It was worn by [[Benedictine]] monks as a sign of humility and penitence. In the 12th century a famous theological dispute broke out between the [[Cistercian]] monks, who wore white, and the Benedictines, who wore black. A Benedictine abbot, Pierre the Venerable, accused the Cistercians of excessive pride in wearing white instead of black. Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], the founder of the Cistercians responded that black was the color of the devil, hell, "of death and sin," while white represented "purity, innocence and all the virtues".<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir- Histoire d'une couleur'', p. 80.</ref>

Black symbolized both power and secrecy in the medieval world. The emblem of the Holy Roman Empire of Germany was a black eagle. The [[black knight]] in the poetry of the Middle Ages was an enigmatic figure, hiding his identity, usually wrapped in secrecy.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir - Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;86–90.</ref>

Obtaining a good quality black was an essential element of the most influential invention of the Middle Ages; the [[printing press]]. Traditional handwriting [[ink]], invented in China and India in ancient times, blurred during printing. A new kind of ink, printer's ink, was created in the 15th century out of [[soot]], [[turpentine]] and [[walnut oil]]. The new ink made it possible to spread ideas to a mass audience through printed books, and to popularize art through black and white engravings and prints.

===Black becomes the color of fashion===
In the early Middle Ages, princes, nobles and the wealthy usually wore bright colors, particularly scarlet cloaks from Italy. Black was rarely part of the wardrobe of a noble family. The one exception was the fur of the [[sable]]. This glossy black fur, from an animal of the [[marten]] family, was the finest and most expensive fur in Europe.  It was imported from Russia and Poland and used to trim the robes and gowns of royalty.

In the 14th century, the status of black began to change. First, high-quality black dyes began to arrive on the market, allowing garments of a deep, rich black. Magistrates and government officials began to wear black robes, as a sign of the importance and seriousness of their positions. A third reason was the passage of [[sumptuary laws]] in some parts of Europe which prohibited the wearing of costly clothes and certain colors by anyone except members of the nobility. The famous bright scarlet cloaks from [[Venice]] and the peacock blue fabrics from [[Florence]] were restricted to the nobility. The wealthy bankers and merchants of northern Italy responded by changing to black robes and gowns, made with the most expensive fabrics.<ref>Michel Pastoureau,  Noir- HIstoire d'une couleur, p.&nbsp;93–130.</ref>

The change to the more austere but elegant black was quickly picked up by the kings and nobility. It began in northern Italy, where the Duke of Milan and the Count of Savoy and the rulers of Mantua, Ferrara, Rimini and Urbino began to dress in black. It then spread to France, led by [[Louis I, Duke of Orleans]], younger brother of King [[Charles VI of France]]. It moved to England at the end of the reign of King [[Richard II]] (1377–1399), where all the court began to wear black. In 1419–20, black became the color of the powerful Duke of Burgundy, [[Philip the Good]]. It moved to Spain, where it became the color of The Spanish Hapsburgs, of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and of his son, [[Philip II of Spain]] (1527–1598). European rulers saw it as the color of power, dignity, humility and temperance. By the end of the 16th century, it was the color worn by almost all the monarchs of Europe and their courts.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir- Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;121–25.</ref>

===Protestants and Puritans===
While black was the color worn by the Catholic rules of Europe, it was also the emblematic color of the Protestant Reformation in Europe and the Puritans in England and America. [[Jean Calvin]], [[Melanchton]] and other Protestant theologians denounced the richly colored and decorated interiors of Roman Catholic churches. They saw the color red, worn by the Pope and his Cardinals, as the color of luxury, sin, and human folly.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir- Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;146–47.</ref> In some northern European cities, mobs attacked churches and cathedrals, smashed the stained glass windows and defaced the statues and decoration. In Protestant doctrine, clothing was required to be sober, simple and discreet. Bright colors were banished and replaced by blacks, browns and grays; women and children were recommended to wear white.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir- Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;152–53.</ref>

In the Protestant Netherlands, [[Rembrandt Van Rijn]] used this sober new palette of blacks and browns to create portraits whose faces emerged from the shadows expressing the deepest human emotions. The Catholic painters of the Counter-Reformation, like [[Rubens]], went in the opposite direction; they filled their paintings with bright and rich colors. The new [[Baroque]] churches of the [[Counter-Reformation]] were usually shining white inside and filled with statues, frescoes, marble, gold and colorful paintings, to appeal to the public. But European Catholics of all classes, like Protestants, eventually adopted a sober wardrobe that was mostly black, brown and gray.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir- Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;150–51</ref>

===Witches and black cats===
In the second part of the 17th century, Europe and America experienced an epidemic of fear of [[witchcraft]].  People widely believed that the devil appeared at midnight in a ceremony called a [[black mass]] or black sabbath, usually in the form of a black animal, often a goat, a dog, a wolf, a bear, a deer or a rooster, accompanied by their [[familiar spirits]], black cats, serpents and other black creatures. This was the origin of the widespread superstition about black cats and other black animals. In Medieval [[Flanders]], in a ceremony called ''Kattenstoet''. black cats were thrown from the belfry of the Cloth Hall of [[Ypres]] to ward off witchrcraft.<ref>Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', [p. 279).</ref>

Witch trials were common in both Europe and America during this period. During the notorious [[Salem witch trials]] in New England in 1692–93, one of those on trial was accused of being able turn into a "black thing with a blue cap,"  and others of having familiars in the form of a black dog, a black cat and a black bird.<ref>[http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/SALEM.HTM Examinations of Sarah Good, Rebecca Nurse, Tituba.

===The 18th and 19th centuries===
In the 18th century, during the European [[Age of Enlightenment]], black receded as a fashion color. Paris became the fashion capital, and pastels, blues, greens, yellow and white became the colors of the nobility and upper classes. But after the [[French Revolution]], black again became the dominant color.

Black was the color of the [[industrial revolution]], largely fueled by [[coal]], and later by oil. Thanks to coal smoke, the buildings of the large cities of Europe and America gradually turned black.  [[Charles Dickens]] and other writers described the dark streets and smoky skies of London, and they were vividly illustrated in the engravings of French artist [[Gustave Doré]].

A different kind of black was an important part of the [[romantic movement]] in literature. Black was the color of [[melancholy]], the dominant theme of romanticism. The novels of the period were filled with castles, ruins, dungeons, storms, and meetings at midnight. The leading poets of the movement were usually portrayed dressed in black, usually with a white shirt and open collar, and a scarf carelessly over their shoulder,  [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and Lord Byron helped create the enduring stereotpype of the romantic poet.

The invention of new, inexpensive synthetic black dyes and the industrialization of the textile industry meant that good-quality black clothes were available for the first time to the general population. In the 19th century gradually black became the most popular color of business dress of the upper and middle classes in England, the Continent, and America.

Black dominated literature and fashion in the 19th century, and played a large role in painting. [[James McNeil Whistler]] made the color the subject of his most famous painting, ''Arrangement in grey and black number one''  (1871), better known as ''[[Whistler's Mother]]''.

Some 19th-century French painters had a low opinion of black: "Reject black," [[Paul Gauguin]] said, "and that mix of black and white they call gray. Nothing is black, nothing is gray."<ref>Paul Gauguin, ''Oviri.  Écrits d'un sauvage''. Textes choisis (1892–1903). Editions D. Guerin, Paris, 1974, p. 123.</ref> But [[Édouard Manet]] used blacks for their strength and dramatic effect. Manet's portrait of painter [[Berthe Morisot]] was a study in black which perfectly captured her spirit of independence. The black gave the painting power and immediacy;  he even changed her eyes, which were green, to black to strengthen the effect.<ref>Steffano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 302.</ref> [[Henri Matisse]] quoted the French impressionist [[Pissarro]] telling him, "Manet is stronger than us all - he made light with black."<ref>Jack Flam, ''Matisse on Art'', p. 175.</ref>

[[Auguste Renoir]] used luminous blacks, especially in his portraits. When someone told him that black was not a color, Renoir replied: "What makes you think that? Black is the queen of colors. I always detested Prussian blue. I tried to replace black with a mixure of red and blue, I tried using cobalt blue or ultramarine, but I always came back to ivory black."<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur - effets et symboliques'', p. 107.</ref>

[[Vincent van Gogh]] used black lines to outline many of the objects in his paintings, such as the bed in the famous painting of his bedroom. making them stand apart. His painting of black crows over a cornfield, painted shortly before he died, was particularly agitated and haunting.

In the late 19th century, black also became the color of [[anarchism]]. (See political movements.)

===20th and 21st centuries===
In the 20th century, black was the color of Italian and German [[fascism]]. (See political movements.)

In art, black regained some of the territory that it had lost during the 19th century. The Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], a member of the [[Suprematist]] movement, created the [[Black Square]] in 1915, is widely considered the first purely abstract painting. He wrote, "The painted work is no longer simply the imitation of reality, but is this very reality&nbsp;... It is not a demonstration of ability, but the materialization of an idea."<ref>Cited in Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 306.</ref>

Black was also appreciated by [[Henri Matisse]]. "When I didn't know what color to put down, I put down black," he said in 1945. "Black is a force: I used black as ballast to simplify the construction&nbsp;... Since the impressionists it seems to have made continuous progress, taking a more and more important part in color orchestration, comparable to that of the double bass as a solo instrument."<ref>Jack Flam (1995), ''Matisse on Art'', p. 166.</ref>

In the 1950s, black came to be a symbol of individuality and intellectual and social rebellion, the color of those who didn't accept established norms and values. In Paris, it was worn by Left-Bank intellectuals and performers such as [[Juliette Greco]], and by some members of the [[Beat Movement]] in New York and San Francisco.<ref name="Eva Heller pg 120">Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la Couleur- effets et symboliques'' (p. 120).</ref> Black leather jackets were worn by motorcycle gangs such as the [[Hells Angels]] and street gangs on the fringes of society in the United States. Black as a color of rebellion was celebrated in such films as [[The Wild One]], with [[Marlon Brando]]. By the end of the 20th century, black was the emblematic color of the [[punk subculture]] [[punk fashion]], and the [[goth subculture]]. Goth fashion, which emerged in England in the 1980s, was inspired by [[Victorian era]] mourning dress.

In men's fashion, black gradually ceded its dominance to navy blue, particularly in business suits. Black evening dress and formal dress in general were worn less and less. In 1960, [[John F. Kennedy]] was the last American President to be inaugurated wearing formal dress; President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and all his successors were inaugurated wearing business suits.

Women's fashion was revolutionized and simplified in 1926 by the French designer [[Coco Chanel]], who published a drawing of a simple black dress in ''Vogue'' magazine. She famously said, "A woman needs just three things; a black dress, a black sweater, and, on her arm, a man she loves."<ref name="Eva Heller pg 120"/>  Other designers contributed to the trend of the [[little black dress]]. The Italian designer [[Gianni Versace]] said, "Black is the quintessence of simplicity and elegance," and French designer [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] said, "black is the liaison which connects art and fashion.<ref name="Eva Heller pg 120"/> One of the most famous black dresses of the century was designed by [[Hubert de Givenchy]] and was worn by [[Audrey Hepburn]] in the 1961 film ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''.

The American [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1950s was a struggle for the political equality of [[African Americans]]. It developed into the [[Black Power]] movement in the late 1960s and 1970s, and popularized the slogan "[[Black is Beautiful]]".

In the 1990s, the [[Black Standard]] became the banner of many of the groups within the Islamist jihad movement. (See political movements.)

==Science==

===Optics===

In the [[visible spectrum]], [[white]] reflects light and is a presence of all colors, but black absorbs light and is an absence of color.

Black can be defined as the visual impression experienced when no [[visible light]] reaches the eye. (This makes a contrast with whiteness, the impression of any combination of colors of light that equally stimulates all three types of color-sensitive visual receptors.)

[[Pigment]]s or [[dye]]s that absorb light rather than reflect it back to the eye "look black". A black pigment can, however, result from a ''combination'' of several pigments that collectively absorb all colors. If appropriate proportions of three primary pigments are mixed, the result reflects so little light as to be called "black".

This provides two superficially opposite but actually complementary descriptions of black. Black is the lack of all colors of light, or an exhaustive combination of multiple colors of pigment. See also [[primary colors]].

In [[physics]], a [[black body]] is a perfect absorber of light, but, by a thermodynamic rule, it is also the best emitter. Thus, the best radiative cooling, out of sunlight, is by using black paint, though it is important that it be black (a nearly perfect absorber) in the [[infrared]] as well.

In elementary science, far [[ultraviolet]] light is called "[[black light]]" because, while itself unseen, it causes many minerals and other substances to [[Phosphorescence|fluoresce]].

On January 16, 2008, researchers from [[Troy, New York]]'s [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] announced the creation of the darkest material on the planet. The material, which reflects only .045 percent of light, was created from [[carbon nanotube]]s stood on end. This is 1/30 of the light reflected by the current standard for blackness, and one third the light reflected by the previous record holder for darkest substance.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/16/2139711.htm 30 times darker], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7190107.stm Darkest ever material created]</ref>

A material is said to be black if most incoming light is [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] equally in the material. Light ([[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[visible spectrum]]) [[Interaction#Physics|interacts]] with the [[atom]]s and [[molecules]], which causes the energy of the light to be converted into other forms of energy, usually heat. This means that black surfaces can act as thermal collectors, absorbing light and generating heat(see [[Solar thermal collector]]).

Absorption of light is contrasted by [[Transmittance|transmission]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[Diffuse reflection|diffusion]], where the light is only redirected, causing objects to appear transparent, reflective or white respectively.

===Chemistry of black pigments, dyes, and inks===

====Pigments====
The earliest pigments used by Neolithic man were [[charcoal]], [[red ocher]] and [[yellow ocher]]. The black lines of cave art were drawn with the tips of burnt torches made of a wood with [[resin]].<ref name="Anne Varichon pg. 256">Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs - pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 256.</ref>

Different charcoal pigments were made by burning different woods and animal products, each of which produced a different tone. The charcoal would be ground and then mixed with animal fat to make the pigment.

*'''Vine black''' was produced in Roman times by burning the cut branches of grapevines. It could also be produced by burning the remains of the crushed grapes, which were collected and dried in an oven. According to the historian [[Vitruvius]], the deepness and richness of the black produced corresponded to the quality of the wine. The finest wines produced a black with a bluish tinge the color of [[indigo]].

The 15th-century painter Cennino Cennini described how this pigment was made during the Renaissnace in his famous handbook for artists: "...There is a black which is made from vine twigs; these twigs are to be burned; and when they are burned, throw water on them, and quench them; and then work them up like an other black. And is a color both black, and lean; and it is one of the perfect colors which we eomploy."<ref>Cennino Cennini, "The Craftsman's Handbook," p.22</ref>

Cennini also noted that "there is another black which is made from burnt almond shells or peach stones, and this is a perfect black, and fine."<ref>Cennino Cennini, ''The Craftsman's Handbook'', p. 22</ref> Similar fine blacks were  made by burning the pits of the [[peach]], [[cherry]] or [[apricot]]. The powdered charcoal was then mixed with [[gum arabic]] or the yellow of an egg to make a paint.

Different civilizations burned different plants to produce their charcoal pigments. The [[Inuit]] of Alaska used wood charcoal mixed with the blood of [[Pinnipeds|seals]] to paint masks and wooden objects. The Polynesians burned [[coconuts]] to produce their pigment.

*[[Lamp black]] was used as a pigment for painting and frescoes. as a dye for fabrics, and in some societies for making tattoos.  The 15th century Florentine painter Cennino Cennini described how it was made during the Renaissance:  "...Take a lamp full of linseed oil...and light this lamp. Then put it, so lighted, underneath a good clean baking dish, and have the little flame of the lamp come about to the bottom of the dish, two or three fingers away, and the smoke which comes out of the flame will strike the bottom of the dish, and condense in a mass.  Wait a while; take the baking dish, and with some implement sweep this color, that is, this soot, off on to a paper, or into some dish; and it doesn not have to be worked up or ground, for it is a very fine color. Refill the lamp with the oil in this way several times, and put it back under the dish, and make as much of it in this way as you need."<ref>Cennino Cennini, ''The Craftsman's Handbook'', p. 22-23</ref> This same pigment was used by Indian artists to paint the [[Ajanta Caves]], and as dye in ancient [[Japan]].<ref name="Anne Varichon pg. 256"/>

*[[Ivory black]], also known as [[bone char]], was originally produced by burning ivory and mixing the resulting charcoal powder with oil. The color is still made today, but ordinary animal bones are substituted for ivory.

*[[Mars Black (pigment)|Mars black]] is a black pigment made of synthetic [[iron oxides]]. It is commonly used in water-colors and oil painting. It takes its name from [[Mars]], the god of war and patron of iron.

====Dyes====

Good-quality black [[dyes]] were not known until the middle of the 14th century. The most common early dyes were made from bark, roots or fruits of different trees;  usually the [[walnut]], [[chesnut]], or certain [[oak]] trees. The blacks produced were often more gray, brown or bluish. The cloth had to be dyed several times to darken the color. One solution used by dyers was add to the dye some iron filings, rich in iron oxide, which gave a deeper black. Another was to first dye the fabric dark blue, and then to dye it black.

A much richer and deeper black dye was eventually found made from the [[Oak apple]] or '''gall-nut'''.  The gall-nut is a small round tumor which grows on oak and other varieties of trees. They range in size from 2–5&nbsp;cm, and are caused by chemicals injected by the [[larva]] of certain kinds of [[gall wasp]] in the family Cynipidae.<ref name=cranshaw>{{cite book|last=Cranshaw|first=Whitney|title=Garden Insects of North America|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0-691-09560-4}}</ref> The dye was very expensive;  a great quantity of gall-nuts were needed for a very small amount of dye.  The gall-nuts which made the best dye came from [[Poland]], eastern Europe, the near east and North Africa.  Beginning in about the 14th century, dye from gall-nuts was used for clothes of the kings and princes of Europe.<ref>Michel Pastoureau (2008), ''Noir - Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;112–13.</ref>

Another important source of natural black dyes from the 17th century onwards was the [[logwood tree]], or [[Haematoxylum campechianum]], which also produced reddish and bluish dyes. It is a species of [[Flowering plant|flowering]] [[tree]] in the [[legume]] family, [[Fabaceae]], that is native to southern [[Mexico]] and northern [[Central America]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?18172 |title=Haematoxylum campechianum |work=[[Germplasm Resources Information Network]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |accessdate=2009-01-27}}</ref> The modern nation of [[Belize]] grew from 17th century [[Kingdom of England|English]] logwood logging camps.

Since the mid-19th century, synthetic black dyes have largely replaced natural dyes. One of the important synthetic blacks is [[Nigrosin]], a mixture of synthetic black dyes (CI 50415, Solvent black 5) made by heating a mixture of [[nitrobenzene]], [[aniline]] and aniline hydrochloride in the presence of a [[copper]] or [[iron]] [[catalyst]]. Its main industrial uses are as a colorant for lacquers and varnishes and in marker-pen inks.<ref>Green F. J. (1990), ''The Sigma-Aldrich Handbook of Dyes, Stains and Indicators'', pp.&nbsp;513–15. Milwaukee:&nbsp;Aldrich. ISBN 0-941633-22-5</ref>

====Inks====

The first known inks were made by the Chinese, and date back to the 23rd century B.C. They used natural plant dyes and minerals such as [[graphite]] ground with water and applied with an [[ink brush]]. Early Chinese inks similar to the modern [[inkstick]] have been found dating to about 256 BC at the end of the [[Warring States period]]. They were produced from [[soot]], usually produced by burning pine wood, mixed with [[animal glue]]. To make ink from an inkstick, the stick is continuously ground against an [[inkstone]] with a small quantity of water to produce a dark liquid which is then applied with an [[ink brush]]. Artists and calligraphists could vary the thickness of the resulting ink by reducing or increasing the intensity and time of ink grinding. These inks produced the delicate shading and subtle or dramatic effects of [[Chinese brush painting]].<ref>{{citation|title=二、墨的發展史|first=玫芬|last=蔡|publisher=National Chang-Hua Hall of Social Education|url=http://www.chcsec.gov.tw/pcsec/research/four_treasure/books/ink/index_ink.htm|trans_title=Second, the ink history of the development}}</ref>

[[India ink]] (or '''Indian ink''' in [[British English]]) is a black [[ink]] once widely used for writing and printing and now more commonly used for [[drawing]], especially when inking [[comic book]]s and [[comic strip]]s. The technique of making it probably came from China. India ink has been in use in [[India]] since at least the 4th century BC, where it was called ''masi''. In India, the black color of the ink came from [[bone char]], [[tar]], [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] and other substances.<ref>"India ink." in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2008.</ref><ref name=gottsege>{{cite book

The Ancient Romans had a black writing ink they called ''[[Atramentum]] librarium''.<ref>William Smith (editor) [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]], 1870
[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/index.html (text).]</ref> Its name came from the Latin word ''atrare'', which meant to make something black. (This was the same root as the English word ''atrocious''.) It was usually made, like India ink, from [[soot]], although one variety, called ''atrementum elaphantinum'', was made by burning the ivory of elephants.<ref>Nicholas Eastaugh, Valentine Walsh, Tracey Chaplin, Ruth Siddall, ''Pigment Compendium: A Dictionary of Historical Pigments'', Butterworth-Heinemann, 2004.</ref>

Gall-nuts were also used for making fine black writing ink. [[Iron gall ink]] (also known as iron gall nut ink or oak gall ink) was a purple-black or brown-black [[ink]] made from [[iron]] salts and [[tannic acid]]s from gall nut. It was the standard writing and drawing [[ink]] in [[Europe]], from about the 12th century to the 19th century, and remained in use well into the 20th century.

===Astronomy===
* A [[black dwarf]] is a hypothetical [[stellar remnant]], created when a [[white dwarf]] becomes sufficiently cool to no longer emit significant [[heat]] or [[light]]. Since the time required for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current [[age of the universe]] (13.8 billion years), no black dwarfs are thought to exist yet in the universe.
* A [[black hole]] is a region of [[spacetime]] where gravity prevents anything, including [[light]], from escaping.<ref>{{harvnb|Wald|1984|pp=299–300}}</ref> The theory of [[general relativity]] predicts that a sufficiently compact [[mass]] will deform spacetime to form a black hole. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an [[event horizon]] that marks the point of no return. It is called "black" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect [[black body]] in [[thermodynamics]].<ref>{{cite book

Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, [[supermassive black hole]]s of millions of solar masses may form. There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most [[galaxy|galaxies]].

*[[Black body radiation]] refers to the radiation coming from a body at a given temperature where all incoming energy (light) is converted to heat.

* Black sky refers to the appearance of space as one emerges from the Earth's atmosphere.

===Why the night sky and space are black - Olbers' Paradox===
The fact that [[outer space]] is black is sometimes called [[Olbers' paradox]]. In theory, since the universe is full of stars, and is believed to be infinitely large, it would be expected that the light of an infinite number of stars would be enough to brilliantly light the whole universe all the time. However, the background color of outer space is black. This contradiction was first noted in 1823 by German astronomer [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers]], who posed the question of why the night sky was black.

The current accepted answer is that, while the universe is infinitely large, it is not infinitely old. It is thought to be about 15 billion years old, so we can only see objects as far away as the distance light can travel in 15 billion years. Light from stars farther away has not reached Earth, and cannot contribute to making the sky bright. Also, as the universe is expanding, many stars are moving away from the Earth. As they move, the wavelength of their light becomes longer, through the [[Doppler effect]], and shifts toward red, or even becomes invisible. As a result of these two phenomena, there is not enough starlight to make space anything but black.<ref>[http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question52.html The StarChild site of the NASA High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center]</ref>

The daytime sky on Earth is blue because the light from the Sun strikes molecules in the Earth's atmosphere and scatters in all directions. Blue light is scattered more than other colors, and reaches the eye in greater quantities, making the daytime sky look blue. This is known as [[Rayleigh scattering]].

The nighttime sky seen from Earth is black because the part of Earth experiencing night is facing away from the Sun, the light of the Sun is blocked by the Earth, and there is no other bright nighttime source of light in the vicinity. Thus, there is not enough light to undergo Rayleigh scattering and make the sky blue. On the Moon, on the other hand, because there is no atmosphere to scatter the light, the sky is black both day and night. This also holds true for any other location without an atmosphere.

==Political movements==
'''Anarchism''' is a political philosophy, most popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which holds that governments and capitalism are harmful and undesirable. The [[Anarchist symbolism|symbols of anarchism]] was usually either a black flag or a black letter A. More recently it is usually represented with a bisected red and black flag, to emphasise the movement's socialist roots in the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]]. Anarchism was most popular in Spain, France, Italy, Ukraine and Argentina. There were also small but influential movements in the United States and Russia. In the latter, the movement initially allied itself with the Bolsheviks.<ref name="blackflame">Michael Schmidt and [[Lucien van der Walt]], ''[[Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism (Counter-Power vol. 1)|Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism]]''. (Oakland and Edinburgh: [[AK Press]], 2009), pp. 33-54.</ref>

The '''Black Army''' was a collection of anarchist military units which fought in the [[Russian Civil War]],  sometimes on the side of the Bolshevik [[Red Army]], and sometimes for the opposing [[White Army]]. It was officially known as the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]], and it was under the command of the famous anarchist [[Nestor Makhno]].

'''Fascism'''. The [[Blackshirts]] ({{lang-it|camicie nere, 'CCNN}}) were [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] [[paramilitary]] groups in [[History of Italy as a monarchy and in the World Wars|Italy]] during the period immediately following [[World War I]] and until the end of [[World War II]]. The Blackshirts were officially known as the Voluntary Militia for National Security (''Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale'', or MVSN).

Inspired by the black uniforms of the [[Arditi]], Italy's elite storm troops of World War I, the Fascist Blackshirts were organized by [[Benito Mussolini]] as the military tool of his political movement.<ref name="Bosworth">Bosworth, R. J. B, ''Mussolini's Italy: Life Under the Fascist Dictatorship, 1915–1945'', Penguin Books, 2005, p. 117.</ref> They used violence and intimidation against Mussolini's opponents. The emblem of the Italian fascists was a black flag with [[fasces]], an axe in a bundle of sticks, an ancient Roman symbol of authority. Mussolini came to power in 1922 through his [[March on Rome]] with the blackshirts.

Black was also adopted by [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] in Germany. Red, white and black were the colors of the flag of the German Empire from 1870 to 1918. In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler explained that they were "revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past." Hitler also wrote that "the new flag&nbsp;... should prove effective as a large poster" because "in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement." The black [[swastika]] was meant to symbolize the [[Aryan]] race, which, according to the Nazis, "was always anti-Semitic and will always be anti-Semitic."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/pimpfhitler.htm |title=Nazi propaganda pamphlet "The Life of the Führer" |publisher=Calvin.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}</ref> Several designs by a number of different authors were considered, but the one adopted in the end was Hitler's personal design.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Mein Kampf]], volume 2, chapter VII |last=Hitler |first=Adolf |authorlink=Adolf Hitler |year=1926}}</ref> Black became the color of the uniform of the [[SS]], the ''Schutzstaffel'' or "defense corps", the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, and was worn by SS officers from 1932 until the end of World War II.

The Nazis used a [[black triangle (badge)|black triangle]] to symbolize anti-social elements. The symbol originates from [[Nazi concentration camp]]s, where every prisoner had to wear one of the [[Nazi concentration camp badges]] on their jacket, the color of which categorized them according to "their kind." Many Black Triangle prisoners were either mentally disabled or mentally ill. The homeless were also included, as were alcoholics, the [[Romani people]], the habitually "work-shy," prostitutes, draft dodgers and pacifists.<ref>[http://www.chgs.umn.edu/histories/documentary/hadamar/asocials.html The unsettled, "asocials", alcoholics and prostitutes]. Center for Holocaust & Genocide Studies. [[University of Minnesota]]. Retrieved September 14, 2012.</ref> More recently the black triangle has been adopted as a symbol in  [[lesbian culture]] and by disabled activists.

Black shirts were also worn by the [[British Union of Fascists]] before World War II, and members of fascist movements in the Netherlands and India.<ref>Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la Couleur - effets et symboliques'', p. 123.</ref>

'''Patriotic Resistance'''. The [[Lützow Free Corps]], composed of volunteer German students and academics fighting against [[Napoleon]] in 1813, could not afford to make special uniforms and therefore adopted black, as the only color that could be used to dye their civilian clothing without the original color showing.  In 1815 the students began to carry a red, black and gold flag, which they believed (incorrectly) had been the colors of the Holy Roman Empire (the imperial flag had actually been gold and black). In 1848, this banner became the flag of the [[German confederation]]. In 1866, [[Prussia]] unified Germany under its rule, and imposed the red, white and black of its own flag, which remained the colors of the German flag until the end of the Second World War. In 1949 the Federal Republic of Germany returned to the original flag and colors of the students and professors of 1815, which is the flag of Germany today.<ref>Eva Heller (2000) ''Psychologie de la Couleur - effets et symboliques'', pp.&nbsp;124–25.</ref>

'''Islamism'''. The [[Black Standard]] ({{lang|ar|راية السوداء ''rāyat al-sawdā' ''}}, also known as {{lang|ar| راية العقاب ''rāyat al-'uqāb''}} "[[:wikt:راية|banner]] of the [[:wikt:عقاب#Arabic|eagle]]" or simply as {{lang|ar|[[:wikt:الراية|الراية]] ''al-rāya''}} "the banner") is the historical flag flown by [[Muhammad]] in [[hadith|Islamic tradition]], an  [[eschatology|eschatological]] symbol in [[Shi'a Islam]] (heralding the advent of the [[Mahdi]]),<ref name="cookshia">{{cite book|title=Studies in Muslim Apocalyptic|author=David Cook |year=2002|publisher=Darwin Press|page=197}} from Majlisi.</ref> and a symbol used in [[Islamism]] and [[Jihadism]].

==Religion==
*In [[Christian]] theology, black was the color of the universe before [[God]] created light. In many religious cultures, from [[Mesoamerica]] to [[Oceania]] to [[India]] and [[Japan]], the world was created out of a primordial darkness.<ref>Stefano Zuppi, ''Color in Art'', pp.&nbsp;268–69.</ref> In the [[Bible]] the light of faith and Christianity is often contrasted with the darkness of ignorance and paganism.

In Christianity, the Devil is considered the "prince of darkness." The term was used in [[John Milton]]'s poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', published in 1667, referring to [[Satan]], who is viewed as the embodiment of evil. It is an English translation of the Latin phrase ''princeps tenebrarum'', which occurs in the ''[[Acts of Pilate]]'', written in the fourth century, in the 11th-century [[hymn]] ''Rhythmus de die mortis'' by [[Pietro Damiani]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uan.it/alim/letteratura.nsf/(testiID)/9941C91390B5688BC125709F002D7C68!opendocument |title=Petrus Damiani: Opera poetica Pag 89 |publisher=Uan.it |date=2005-10-19 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref> and in a sermon by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.binetti.ru/bernardus/86_1.shtml |title="Sermones in Cantica canticorum, I - XVII" - Bernardus Claraevallensis |publisher=Binetti.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref> from the 12th century. The phrase also occurs in ''[[King Lear]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] (c. 1606), Act III, Scene IV, l. 14:
'The prince of darkness is a gentleman."

Priests and pastors of the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Protestant]] churches commonly wear black, as do [[monks]] of the [[Benedictine Order]], who consider it the color of humility and penitence.

*In [[Islam]], black, along with green, plays an important symbolic role. It is the color of the [[Black Standard]], the banner that is said to have been carried by the soldiers of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]. It is also used as a symbol in [[Shi'a Islam]] (heralding the advent of the [[Mahdi]]), and the flag of followers of  [[Islamism]] and [[Jihadism]].

*In [[Hinduism]], the goddess [[Kali]], goddess of time and change, is portrayed with black or dark blue skin. wearing a necklace adorned with severed heads and hands. Her name means "The black one".<ref>Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art' (p. 275).</ref>

==Sports==
* The national [[rugby union]] team of New Zealand is called the ''[[All Blacks]]'', in reference to their black outfits, and the color is also shared by other New Zealand national teams such as the [[Black Caps]] (cricket) and the [[Kiwis]] (rugby league).
* [[Association football|Association football (soccer)]] [[Referee (association football)|referees]] traditionally wear all-black uniforms, however nowadays other uniform colors may also be worn.
* A large number of teams have uniforms designed with black colors—many feeling the color sometimes imparts a psychological advantage in its wearers. Among the more famous (or infamous) include [[Oakland Raiders]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] of the [[NFL]], the [[San Antonio Spurs]] and [[Miami Heat]] of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]] of the [[Serie A]] of the [[Italian football league system|Italian soccer leagues]].
* In [[auto racing]], a black flag signals a driver to go into the pits.
* In baseball, "the black" refers to the [[batter's eye]], a blacked out area around the center-field bleachers, painted black to give hitters a decent background for pitched balls.

==Associations and symbolism==

===Mourning===
In Europe and America, black is the color most commonly associated with mourning and bereavement.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur - effets et symboliques'', p. 109. In the survey cited, 80 percent of respondents said black was the color of mourning.</ref> It is the color traditionally worn at funerals and memorial services. In some traditional societies, for example in Greece and Italy, some widows wear black for the rest of their lives. In contrast, across much of Africa and parts of Asia, white is a color of mourning and is worn during funerals.

In Victorian England, the colors and fabrics of mourning were specified in an unofficial dress code:  "non-reflective black paramatta and crape for the first year of deepest mourning, followed by nine months of dullish black silk, heavily trimmed with crape, and then three months when crape was discarded.  Paramatta was a fabric of combined silk and wool or cotton; crape was a harsh black silk fabric with a crimped appearance produced by heat.  Widows were allowed to change into the colors of half-mourning, such as gray and lavender, black and white, for the final six months."<ref>Patricia Jalland, Death in the Victorian Family, p. 300.</ref>

A "black day" (or week or month) usually refers to tragic date. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] marked ''[[fasti]]'' days with white stones and ''nefasti'' days with black. The term is often used to remember massacres. Black months include the [[Black September in Jordan]], when large numbers of Palestinians were killed, and [[Black July]] in [[Sri Lanka]], the killing of members of the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] population by the [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] government.

In the financial world, the term often refers to a dramatic drop in the stock market. For example, the [[Wall Street Crash 1929]], the [[stock market crash]] on October 29, 1929, which is the start of the [[Great Depression]], is nicknamed Black Tuesday, and was preceded by Black Thursday, a downturn on October 24 the previous week.

===Darkness and evil===
In western popular culture, black has long been associated with [[evil]] and [[darkness]]. It is the traditional color of [[witchcraft]] and [[black magic]].

In the [[Book of Revelations]], the last book in the [[New Testament]] of the BIble, the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] are supposed to announce the [[Apocalypse]] before the [[Last Judgment]]. The horseman representing famine rides a black horse.

The [[vampire]] of literature and films, such as [[Count Dracula]] of the [[Bram Stoker]] novel,  dressed in black, and could only move at night. The [[Wicked Witch of the West]] in the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', became the archetype of witches for generations of children.  Whereas witches and sorcerers inspired real fear in the 17th century, in the 21st century children and adults dressed as witches for Halloween parties and parades.

===Power, authority, and solemnity===
Black is frequently used as a color of power, law and authority. In many countries judges and magistrates wear black robes. That custom began in Europe in the 13th and 14th centuries. Jurists, magistrates and certain other court officials in France began to wear long black robes during the reign of [[Philip IV of France]] (1285–1314), and in England from the time of [[Edward I]] (1271–1307). The custom spread to the cities of Italy at about the same time, between 1300 and 1320. The robes of judges resembled those worn by the clergy, and represented the law and authority of the King, while those of the clergy represented the law of God and authority of the church.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir - histoire d'une couleur'' (pp.&nbsp;114–15).</ref>

Until the 20th century most police uniforms were black, until they were largely replaced by a less menacing blue in France, the U.S. and other countries. In both the United States and Britain, police cars are frequently black and white. Such British police cars are called [[panda cars]] and an American police car is often simply called a [[Black and white (police vehicle)|Black and whites]]. The [[riot control]] units of the [[Basque Autonomous Police]] in Spain are known as ''[[beltzak]]'' ("blacks") after their uniform.

Black today is the most common color for limousines and the official cars of government officials.

Black evening dress is still worn at many solemn occasions or ceremonies, from graduations to formal balls.  Graduation gowns are copied from the gowns worn by university professors in the Middle Ages, which in turn were copied from the robes worn by judges and priests, who often taught at the early universities. The [[mortarboard]] hat worn by graduates is adapted from a square cap called a [[biretta]] worn by Medieval professors and clerics

===Functionality===
In the 19th and 20th centuries, many machines and devices, large and small, were painted black, to stress their functionality. These included telephones, sewing machines, steamships, railroad locomotives, and automobiles. The [[Ford Model T]], the first mass-produced car, was available only in black from 1914 to 1926. Of means of transportation, only airplanes were rarely ever painted black.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur - effets et symboliques'' (p. 226).</ref>

===Race and color===
{{further|Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|Classification of ethnicity in the United Kingdom|Demographics of Canada|Demographics of Australia|Race and ethnicity in Brazil}}

* The term "black" is often used in the West to describe people whose skin is darker. In the United States, it is particularly used to describe [[African Americans]]. The terms for African Americans have changed over the years, as shown by the categories in the [[United States Census]], taken every ten years.
*In the first U.S. Census, taken in 1790, just four categories were used: Free White males, Free White females, other free persons, and slaves.
*In the 1820 census the new category "colored" was added.
*In the 1850 census, slaves were listed by owner, and a B indicated black, while an M indicated "[[mulatto]]."
*In the 1890 census, the categories for race were white, black, mulatto, [[quadroon]] (a person one-quarter black); [[octoroon]] (a person one-eighth black), Chinese, Japanese, or American Indian.
*In the 1930 census, anyone with any black blood was supposed to be listed as "[[Negro]]."
*In the 1970 census, the category "Negro or black" was used for the first time.
*In the 2000 and 2012 census, the category "Black or African-American" was used, defined as "a person having their origin in any of the racial groups in Africa." In the 2012 Census 12.1 percent of Americans identified themselves as Black or African-American.<ref name=thru>{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/index_of_questions|title=Through the Decades | accessdate=2012-01-18 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}</ref>

Black is also commonly used as a racial description in the [[United Kingdom]], since ethnicity was first measured in the 2001 census.  The 2011 British census asked residents to describe themselves, and categories offered included Black, African, Caribbean, or Black British.  Other possible categories were African British, African Scottish, Caribbean British and Caribbean Scottish. Of the total UK population in 2001, 1.01 percent identified themselves as Black Caribbean, .8 percent as Black African, and .2 percent as Black (others).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/Classifications/ns_ethnic_classification.asp |title=The Classification of Ethnic Groups |publisher=National Statistics |date=2001-02-16 |accessdate=2007-04-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070406195623/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/Classifications/ns_ethnic_classification.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-06}}</ref>

In [[Canada]], census respondents can identify themselves as Black. In the 2006 census, 2.5 percent of the population identified themselves as black.<ref>[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/rt-td/eth-eng.cfm] 2006 Canadian census, ethnicity</ref>

In [[Australia]], the term black is not used in the census.  In the 2006 census, 2.3 percent of Australians identified themselves as [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] and/or [[Torres Strait]] Islanders.

In [[Brazil]], the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) asks people to identify themselves as ''branco'' (white), ''pardo'' (brown), ''preto'' (black), or ''amarelo'' (yellow). In 2008 6.84 percent of the population identified themselves as "preto".<ref>IBGE. 2008 PNAD.

===Black and white===
* Black and white have often been used to describe opposites; particularly light and darkness and good and evil. In [[Medieval literature]], the [[white knight]] usually represented virtue, the [[black knight]] something mysterious and sinister. In American [[westerns]], the hero often wore a white hat, the villain a black hat.

*In the original game of [[chess]] invented in [[Persia]] or [[India]], the colors of the two sides were varied; a 12th-century Iranian chess set in the [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]], has red and green pieces. But when the game was imported into Europe, the colors, corresponding to European culture, usually became black and white.

*Studies have shown that something printed in black letters on white has more authority with readers than any other color of printing.

*In philosophy and arguments, the issue is often described as [[black-and-white]], meaning that the issue at hand is [[dichotomy|dichotomized]] (having two clear, opposing sides with no middle ground).

===Black chambers and black ops===
Black is commonly associated with [[secrecy]].

*The [[Black Chamber]] was a term given to an office which secretly opened and read diplomatic mail and broke codes. Queen [[Elizabeth I]] had such an office, headed by her Secretary, Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], which successfully broke the Spanish codes and broke up several plots against the Queen. In France a ''cabinet noir'' was established inside the French post office by [[Louis XIII]] to open diplomatic mail. It was closed during the [[French Revolution]] but re-opened under [[Napoleon I]]. The [[Habsburg Empire]] and [[Dutch Republic]] had similar black chambers.

*The United States created a secret peacetime [[Black Chamber]], called the Cipher Bureau, in 1919. It was funded by the [[State Department]] and Army and disguised as a commercial company in New York. It successfully broke a number of diplomatic codes,including the code of the Japanese government. It was closed down in 1929 after the State Department withdrew funding, when the new Secretary of State, [[Henry Stimson]], stated that "Gentlemen do not read each other's mail." The Cipher Bureau was the ancestor of the U.S. [[National Security Agency]].<ref name=NSAtimeline>{{cite web|title=Pre-1952 Historical Timeline|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/center_crypt_history/pre_1952_timeline/index.shtml|work=National Security Agency|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref>

* A ''black project'' is a secret military project, such as [[Enigma machine|Enigma Decryption]] during the World II, or a secret counter-narcotics or police [[sting operation]].

*[[Black ops]] are covert operations carried out by a government, government agency or military.

===Elegance – black and fashion===
Black is the color most commonly associated with elegance in Europe and the United States, followed by silver, gold, and white.<ref name="ReferenceA">Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques'', 119.</ref>

Black first became a fashionable color for men in Europe in the 17th century, in the courts of Italy and Spain. (See history above). In the 19th century, it was the fashion for men both in business and for evening wear, in the form of a black coat whose tails came down the knees. In the evening it was the custom of the men to leave the women after dinner to go to a special smoking room to enjoy cigars or cigarettes. This meant that their tailcoats eventually smelled of tobacco. According to the legend, in 1865 [[Edward VII]], then the Prince of Wales, had his tailor make a special short [[smoking jacket]].  The smoking jacket then evolved into the dinner jacket. Again according to legend, the first Americans to wear the jacket were members of the Tuxedo Club in New York State. Thereafter the jacket became known as a [[tuxedo]] in the U.S. The term "smoking" is still used today in Russia and other countries.<ref>
Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'' (p. 308).</ref>
The tuxedo was always black until the 1930s, when the [[Duke of Windsor]] began to wear a tuxedo that was a very dark midnight blue. He did so because a black tuxedo looked greenish in artificial light, while a dark blue tuxedo looked blacker than black itself.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

For women's fashion, the defining moment was the invention of the simple black dress by [[Coco Chanel]] in 1926. (See history.) Thereafter, a long black gown was used for formal occasions, while the simple black dress could be used for everything else. The designer [[Karl Lagerfeld]], explaining why black was so popular, said:  "Black is the color that goes with everything. If you're wearing black, you're on sure ground."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Skirts have gone up and down and fashions have changed, but the black dress has not lost its position as the essential element of a woman's wardrobe. The fashion designer [[Christian Dior]] said, "elegance is a combination of distinction, naturalness, care and simplicity,"<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and black exemplified elegance.

The expression  "X is the new black" is a reference to the latest trend or fad that is considered a wardrobe basic for the duration of the trend, on the basis that black is always fashionable. The phrase has taken on a life of its own and has become a [[cliché]].

Many performers of both popular and [[European classical music]], including French singers [[Edith Piaf]] and [[Juliette Greco]], and violinist [[Joshua Bell]] have traditionally worn black on stage during performances. A black costume was usually chosen as part of their image or stage persona, or because it did not distract from the music, or sometimes for a political reason. Country-western singer [[Johnny Cash]] always wore black on stage. In 1971, Cash wrote the song "[[Man in Black (song)|Man in Black]]" to explain why he dressed in that color: "We're doing mighty fine I do suppose / In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes / But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back / Up front there ought to be a man in black."

===Black in Asian culture===
In China, the color black is associated with water, one of the five fundamental elements believed to compose all things;  and with winter, cold, and the direction north, usually symbolized by a black tortoise.  it is also associated with disorder, including the positive disorder which leads to change and new life. When the first Emperor of China [[Qin Shi Huang]] seized power from the [[Zhou Dynasty]], he changed the Imperial color from red to black, saying that black extinguished red.  Only when the [[Han Dynasty]] appeared in 206 A.D. was red restored as the imperial color.<ref>Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs- pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p.&nbsp;223–224.</ref>

The Chinese and Japanese character for black (''kuro'' in Japanese), can, depending upon the context, also mean dark or evil.

In Japan, black is associated with mystery, the night, the unknown, the supernatural, the invisible and death.  Combined with white, it can symbolize intuition.<ref>[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/j/japanese-art-and-design-colour/] Exhibit at the Victoria and Albert Museum on color in Japanese art and design,</ref>

In Japan in the 10th and 11th century, it was believed that wearing black could bring misfortune.  It was worn at court by those who wanted to set themselves apart from the established powers or who had renounced material possessions.<ref>Anne Varichon, p. 224.</ref>

In Japan black can also symbolize experience, as opposed to white, which symbolizes naiveté. The black belt in martial arts symbolizes experience, while a white belt is worn by novices.<ref>[http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/blacks.html] Webexhibits  ''Pigments through the ages''</ref>   Japanese men traditionally wear a black kimono with some white decoration on their wedding day.

In Indonesia black is associated with depth, the subterranean world, demons, disaster, and the left hand.  When black is combined with white, however, it symbolizes harmony and equilibrium.<ref>Anne Varichon, pg.&nbsp;224–225</ref>

==Idioms and expressions==
*In the [[United States]], "[[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]" (the day after [[Thanksgiving Day]], the fourth Thursday in November) is traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year. Many Americans are on holiday because of Thanksgiving, and many retailers open earlier and close later than normal, and offer special prices. The day's name originated in [[Philadelphia]] sometime before 1961, and originally was used to describe the heavy and disruptive downtown pedestrian and vehicle traffic which would occur on that day.<ref name="Zimmer">Ben Zimmer, [http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/3047/ The Origins of "Black Friday,"] ''Word Routes'' (November 25, 2011).</ref><ref name="linguistlist239">[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0804D&L=ADS-L&P=R5955&I=-3 Martin L. Apfelbaum, Philadelphia's "Black Friday,"] ''American Philatelist'', vol. 69, no. 4, p. 239 (January 1966).</ref> Later an alternative explanation began to be offered: that "Black Friday" indicates the point in the year that retailers begin to turn a profit, or are "in the black", because of the large volume of sales on that day.<ref name="Zimmer"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/11/black-friday|title=Black Friday|author=Kevin Drum|date=November 26, 2010}}</ref>
