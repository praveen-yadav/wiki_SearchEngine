The '''Central African Republic''' ('''CAR'''; [[Sango]]: ''Ködörösêse tî Bêafrîka''<span style="margin-left:1px">;</span> {{lang-fr|République centrafricaine}}&nbsp; {{IPA-fr|ʁepyblik sɑ̃tʁafʁikɛn|pron}}, or '''Centrafrique''' {{IPA-fr|sɑ̃tʀafʁik|}}) is a [[landlocked country]] in [[Central Africa]]. It borders [[Chad]] in the north, [[Sudan]] in the northeast, [[South Sudan]] in the east, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]] in the south and [[Cameroon]] in the west. The CAR covers a land area of about {{convert|620,000|km2|sqmi}} and has an estimated population of about 4.4 million as of 2008. The [[capital city|capital]] is [[Bangui]].

[[France]] called the colony it carved out in this region ''[[Oubangui-Chari]]'', as most of the territory was located in the Ubangi and Chari river basins. It became a semi-autonomous territory of the [[French Community]] in 1958 and then an independent nation on 13 August 1960, taking its present name. For over three decades after independence, the CAR was ruled by [[president]]s or an [[emperor of Central Africa|emperor]], who either were unelected or who took power by force. Local discontent with this system was eventually reinforced by international pressure, following the end of the [[Cold War]].

The first multi-party democratic elections in the CAR were held in 1993, with the aid of resources provided by the country's donors and help from the [[United Nations]]. The elections brought [[Ange-Félix Patassé]] to power, but he lost popular support during his presidency and was [[coup d'état|overthrown]] in 2003 by the French-backed [[François Bozizé|General François Bozizé]], who went on to win a [[Central African Republic elections, 2005|democratic election]] in May 2005.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LH&s_site=kentucky&p_multi=LH&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F9E0AF4EA4BFA3B&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM CELEBRATING, LOOTING FOLLOW COUP, U.N. CONDEMNS TAKEOVER IN CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC]. Lexington Herald-Leader, 18 March 2003</ref> Bozizé's inability to pay [[public sector]] workers led to [[strike action|strikes]] in 2007, which led him to appoint a new government on 22 January 2008, headed by [[Faustin-Archange Touadéra]]. In February 2010, Bozizé signed a presidential [[decree]] which set 25 April 2010 as the date for the next presidential election. This was postponed, but elections were held in January and March 2011, which were won by Bozizé and his party. Despite maintaining a veneer of stability, Bozizé's rule was plagued with heavy [[corruption]], underdevelopment, [[nepotism]] and [[authoritarianism]], which led to an open [[rebellion]] against his government. The rebellion was led by an alliance of armed opposition factions known as the [[Séléka CPSK-CPJP-UFDR|Séléka Coalition]] during the [[Central African Republic Bush War]] (2004–2007) and the [[Central African Republic conflict (2012–present)|2012–2013 Central African Republic conflict]]. This eventually led to his overthrow on 24 March 2013. As a result of the [[coup d'etat]] and resulting chaos, governance in the CAR has all but disappeared and [[Prime Minister of the Central African Republic|Prime Minister]] [[Nicolas Tiangaye]] has said the country is an "anarchy, a non-state."<ref name="NYTAugust13">[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/world/africa/violent-and-chaotic-central-african-republic-lurches-toward-a-crisis.html?ref=africa&_r=1&pagewanted=all& Violent and Chaotic, Central African Republic Lurches Toward a Crisis]. (August 7, 2013) Adam Nossiter. [[New York Times]].</ref>

Most of the CAR consists of Sudano-Guinean [[savanna]]s but it also includes a [[Sahel]]o-[[East Sudanian savanna|Sudanian]] zone in the north and an [[Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic|equatorial forest zone]] in the south. Two thirds of the country lies in the basins of the [[Ubangi River]], which flows south into the [[Congo River|Congo]], while the remaining third lies in the basin of the [[Chari River|Chari]], which flows north into [[Lake Chad]].

Despite its significant [[mineral]] and other resources, such as [[uranium]] reserves in [[Bakouma]], [[crude oil]] in [[Vakaga]], [[gold]], [[diamond]]s, [[lumber]] and [[hydropower]],<ref name=CIA/> as well as [[arable land]], the Central African Republic is one of the poorest countries in the world and is among the ten poorest countries in Africa.  The [[Human Development Index]] for the Central African Republic is 0.343, which puts the country at 179th out of those 187 countries with data.

== History ==
{{History of the Central African Republic}}
{{main|History of the Central African Republic}}
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}

=== Early history ===

Between about 1000 BC and 1000 AD, [[Ubangian]]-speaking peoples spread eastward from Cameroon to Sudan, settling in most of what is now known as the Central African Republic. During the same period, a much smaller number of [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking immigrants settled in south-western CAR and a number [[Central Sudanic]]-speaking people settled along the Oubangi. As a result of these early migrations, the majority of the CAR's present population speak Ubangian languages, or Bantu languages that belong to the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] family. A minority speak Central Sudanic languages of the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] family.

=== Exposure to the outside world ===

Before the 19th century, the people living in what is now the CAR lived beyond the expanding [[Islam]]ic frontier in the Sudanic zone of Africa and thus had relatively little contact with [[Abrahamic religions]] or northern economies. During the first decades of the 19th century, Muslim traders penetrated the region and cultivated relations with local leaders to facilitate trade and settlement in the region.

The arrival of Muslim traders in the early 19th century was relatively peaceful and depended upon the support of local peoples, but after about 1850, [[Arab slave trade]]rs with well-armed soldiers began to penetrate the region. The [[Bangi language|Bobangi people]] became major slave traders, they sold their captives to the Americas using the Ubangi river to reach the coast.<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/102152/Central-African-Republic/214025/The-arts-and-cultural-institutions Central African Republic]". Encyclopædia Britannica.</ref> From about 1860 to 1910, slave traders from Sudan, Chad, Cameroon, Dar al-Kuti in northern CAR and Nzakara and [[Azande|Zande]] states in south-eastern CAR permanently depopulated the eastern CAR.<ref>[http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Central-African-Republic.html Culture of Central African Republic – history, people, clothing, women, beliefs, food, family, social, dress].

=== French colonial period ===
{{main|Ubangi-Shari}}

The European penetration of Central African territory began in the late 19th century, during the so-called [[Scramble for Africa]].<ref>[http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Centr_Afr_Rep.shtml French Colonies – Central African Republic]. Discoverfrance.net. Retrieved on 6 April 2013.</ref> Count [[Savorgnan de Brazza]] established the [[French Congo]] and sent expeditions up the Ubangi River from [[Brazzaville]] in an effort to expand France's claims to territory in Central Africa. [[Belgium]], [[German Empire|Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] also competed to establish their claims to territory in the region.

In 1889, the French established a post on the Ubangi River at Bangui. In 1890–91, De Brazza sent expeditions up the [[Sangha River]], in what is now south-western CAR, up the center of the Ubangi basin toward [[Lake Chad]], and eastward along the Ubangi River toward the [[Nile]], with in the intention of expanding the borders of the French Congo to link up other the French territories in Africa. In 1894, the French Congo's borders with [[Leopold II of Belgium]]'s [[Congo Free State]] and [[German Cameroon]] were fixed by diplomatic agreements. In 1899, the French Congo's border with Sudan was fixed along the [[Congo-Nile divide]]. This situation left France without her much coveted outlet on the Nile.

Once European negotiators had agreed upon the borders of the French Congo, France had to decide how to pay for the costly occupation, administration and development of the territory it had acquired. The reported financial successes of Leopold II's concessionary companies in the Congo Free State convinced the French government to grant 17 private companies large concessions in the Ubangi-Shari region in 1899. In return for the right to exploit these lands by buying local products and selling European goods, the companies promised to pay rent to France and to promote the development of their concessions. The companies employed European and African agents, who frequently used brutal methods to force the Africans to work for them. At the same time, the French colonial administration began to force the local population to pay [[taxes]] and to provide the state with free labor. The companies and the French administration at times collaborated in forcing the Central Africans to work for them. Some French officials reported abuses committed by private company militias, and their own colonial colleagues and troops, but efforts to bring these criminals to justice almost always failed. When any news of atrocities committed against Central Africans reached France and caused an outcry, investigations were undertaken and some feeble attempts at reform were made, but the [[facts on the ground|situation on the ground]] in Ubangi-Shari remained essentially the same.

During the first decade of French colonial rule, from about 1900 to 1910, the rulers of the Ubangi-Shari region increased both their slave-raiding activities and the selling of local produce to Europe. They took advantage of their treaties with the French to procure more [[weapon]]s, which were used to capture more slaves: much of the eastern half of Ubangi-Shari was depopulated as a result of slave-trading by local rulers during the first decade of colonial rule.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[File:Oubangui-Chari.jpg|left|thumb|''Oubangui-Chari'' in 1910]]
During the 1910s, armed employees of private companies and the colonial state dealt brutally with any local resistance, but after the power of local African rulers was destroyed, slave raiding greatly diminished. In 1911, the Sangha and Lobaye basins were ceded to Germany, as part of an agreement which gave France a free hand in [[Morocco]]. Western Ubangi-Shari remained under German rule until World War I, after which France reconquered this territory using Central African troops.

[[File:De Gaulle Bangui 1940.jpg|thumb|[[Charles de Gaulle]] in Bangui, 1940]]
From 1920 to 1930, a network of roads was built, [[cash crop]]s were promoted and mobile health services were formed to combat [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]]. [[Protestant]] [[Mission (Christianity)|missions]] were established in different parts of the country. New forms of forced labor were also introduced, however, as the French conscripted large numbers of Ubangians to work on the [[Congo-Ocean Railway]], and many of these recruits died of exhaustion and illness. In 1925, the French writer [[André Gide]] published ''Voyage au Congo'', in which he described the alarming consequences of conscription for the Congo-Ocean railroad. He exposed the continuing atrocities committed against Central Africans in Western Ubangi-Shari by such employees as the Forestry Company of Sangha-Ubangi. In 1928 a major insurrection, the [[Kongo-Wara rebellion]] or 'war of the hoe handle', broke out in Western Ubangi-Shari, which continued for several years. The extent of this insurrection, which was perhaps the largest anti-colonial rebellion in Africa during the interwar years, was carefully hidden from the French public, because it provided evidence of strong opposition to French colonial rule and forced labor.

During the 1930s, [[cotton]], [[tea]], and [[coffee]] emerged as important cash crops in Ubangi-Shari and the mining of [[diamond]]s and [[gold]] began in earnest. Several cotton companies were granted purchasing [[Monopoly|monopolies]] over large areas of cotton production and were able to fix the prices paid to cultivators, which assured profits for their shareholders. In September 1940, during the [[Second World War]], [[Charles de Gaulle|pro-Gaullist]] French officers took control of Ubangi-Shari.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/102152/Central-African-Republic/40700/The-colonial-era Central African Republic: The colonial era – Britannica Online Encyclopedia]. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 6 April 2013.</ref>

=== Independence ===
On 1 December 1958 the colony of Ubangi-Shari became an autonomous territory within the [[French Community]] and took the name Central African Republic. The founding father and president of the ''Conseil de Gouvernement'', [[Barthélémy Boganda]], died in a mysterious plane accident in 1959, just eight days before the last elections of the colonial era.

On 13 August 1960, the Central African Republic gained its independence and two of Boganda's closest aides, [[Abel Goumba]] and [[David Dacko]], became involved in a power struggle. With the backing of the French, Dacko took power and soon had Goumba arrested. By 1962, President Dacko had established a one-party state.

[[File:Bokassa colored.png|thumb|[[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]].<ref name=Bokassa>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/03/jean-bedel-bokassa-posthumous-pardon 'Cannibal' dictator Bokassa given posthumous pardon]. ''The Guardian''. 3 December 2010</ref> ]]
==== Bokassa and the Central African Empire ====
On 31 December 1965, Dacko was overthrown in the [[Saint-Sylvestre coup d'état]] by Colonel [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], who suspended the constitution and dissolved the National Assembly. President Bokassa declared himself President For Life in 1972, and named himself Emperor Bokassa I of the [[Central African Empire]] (as the country was renamed) on 4 December 1976. A year later, Emperor Bokassa crowned himself in a lavish and expensive ceremony that was ridiculed by much of the world.<ref name=Bokassa/> In April 1979, young students protested against Bokassa's decree that all school attendees would need to buy uniforms from a company owned by one of his wives. The government violently suppressed the protests, killing 100 children and teenagers. Bokassa himself may have been personally involved in some of the killings.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7803421.stm 'Good old days' under Bokassa? ]". BBC News. 2 January 2009</ref> In 1979, France carried out a coup against Bokassa and "restored" Dacko to power (the name of the country was subsequently restored to Central African Republic). Dacko, in turn, was overthrown in a coup by General [[André Kolingba]] on 1 September 1981.

==== Central African Republic under Kolingba ====
Kolingba suspended the constitution and ruled with a military junta until 1985. He introduced a new constitution in 1986 which was adopted by a nationwide referendum. Membership in his new party, the [[Rassemblement Démocratique Centrafricain]] (RDC) was voluntary. In 1987, semi-competitive elections to parliament were held and municipal elections were held in 1988. Kolingba's two major political opponents, Abel Goumba and [[Ange-Félix Patassé]], boycotted these elections because their parties were not allowed to compete.

By 1990, inspired by the fall of the Berlin Wall, a pro-democracy movement became very active. In May 1990, a letter signed by 253 prominent citizens asked for the convocation of a National Conference but Kolingba refused this request and detained several opponents. Pressure from the United States, more reluctantly from France, and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called GIBAFOR (France, USA, Germany, Japan, EU, World Bank and UN) finally led Kolingba to agree, in principle, to hold free elections in October 1992, with help from the UN Office of Electoral Affairs. After using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power, President Kolingba came under intense pressure from GIBAFOR to establish a "Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la République" (Provisional National Political Council, CNPPR) and to set up a "Mixed Electoral Commission" which included representatives from all political parties.

When elections were finally held in 1993, again with the help of the international community, Ange-Félix Patassé led in the first round and Kolingba came in fourth behind Abel Goumba and David Dacko. In the second round, Patassé won 53% of the vote while Goumba won 45.6%. Most of Patassé's support came from Gbaya, Kare and Kaba voters in seven heavily populated prefectures in the northwest while Goumba's support came largely from ten less-populated prefectures in the south and east. Furthermore, Patassé's party, the ''Mouvement pour la Libération du Peuple Centrafricain'' (MLPC) or Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People gained a simple but not an absolute majority of seats in parliament, which meant Patassé needed coalition partners.

==== Patassé Government (1993–2003) ====
Patassé relieved former President Kolingba of his military rank of general in March 1994 and then charged several former ministers with various crimes. Patassé also removed many [[Yakoma people|Yakoma]] from important, lucrative posts in the government. Two hundred mostly Yakoma members of the presidential guard were also dismissed or reassigned to the army. Kolingba's RDC loudly proclaimed that Patassé's government was conducting a "witch hunt" against the Yakoma.

A new constitution was approved on 28 December 1994 and promulgated on 14 January 1995, but this constitution, like those before it, did not have much impact on the practice of politics. In 1996–1997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in its erratic behaviour, three mutinies against Patassé's government were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. On 25 January 1997, the [[Bangui Agreements]] were signed which provided for the deployment of an inter-African military mission, the ''Mission Interafricaine de Surveillance des Accords de Bangui'' (MISAB). Mali's former president, [[Amadou Toumani Touré|Amadou Touré]], served as chief mediator and brokered the entry of ex-mutineers into the government on 7 April 1997. The MISAB mission was later replaced by a U.N. peacekeeping force, the ''Mission des Nations Unies en RCA'' ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1159|MINURCA]]).

[[File:Rebel in northern Central African Republic 04.jpg|thumb|Rebel in northern Central African Republic]]
In 1998, parliamentary elections resulted in Kolingba's RDC winning 20 out of 109 seats, constituting a comeback. However, in 1999, notwithstanding widespread public anger in urban centers at his corrupt rule, Patassé won free elections to become president for a second term.

On 28 May 2001, rebels stormed strategic buildings in Bangui in an unsuccessful coup attempt. The army chief of staff, Abel Abrou, and General François N'Djadder Bedaya were shot, but Patassé regained the upper hand by bringing in at least 300 troops of the rebel leader [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] (from across the river in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) and by Libyan soldiers.

In the aftermath of this failed [[Coup d'état|coup]], militias loyal to Patassé sought revenge against rebels in many neighborhoods of the capital, Bangui, that resulted in the destruction of many homes as well as the torture and murder of many opponents. Eventually Patassé came to suspect that General [[François Bozizé]] was involved in another coup attempt against him and so Bozizé fled with loyal troops to Chad. In March 2003, Bozizé launched a surprise attack against Patassé, who was out of the country. Libyan troops and some 1,000 soldiers of Bemba's Congolese rebel organization failed to stop the rebels, who took control of the country and thus succeeded in overthrowing Patassé.

=== Central African Republic since 2003 ===
François Bozizé suspended the constitution and named a new cabinet which included most opposition parties. Abel Goumba, known as "Mr. Clean",{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} was named vice-president, which gave Bozizé's new government a positive image. Bozizé established a broad-based National Transition Council to draft a new constitution and announced that he would step down and run for office once the new constitution was approved. A national dialogue was held from 15 September to 27 October 2003, and Bozizé won a fair election that excluded Patassé, to be elected president on a second ballot, in May 2005.

In November 2006, the Bozizé government requested French military support to fend off rebels who had taken control of towns in the country's north.<ref name="bbc20061114">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6146748.stm |title=CAR hails French pledge on rebels |accessdate=26 December 2012 |date=14 November 2006 |work=BBC}}</ref>
Though the initially public details of the agreement pertained to logistics and intelligence, the French assistance eventually included strikes by Mirage jets against rebel positions.<ref name="bbc20061130">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6196652.stm |title=French planes attack CAR rebels |accessdate=26 December 2012 |date=30 November 2006 |work=BBC}}</ref>

In November 2012, a coalition of rebel groups took over towns in the north and center of the country.  These groups eventually reached a peace deal with the Bozizé's government in January 2013 involving a power sharing government.<ref name="CIA World Factbook"/>  This peace deal was later broken when the rebels who had joined the power sharing government left their posts and rebel groups stormed the capital.  Bozizé fled the country and [[Michel Djotodia]] took over the presidency. In September 2013, Djotodia officially disbanded Seleka but many rebels refused to disarm and veered further out of government control.<ref name = GuardianNov13>Smith, David (22 November 2013) [http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/22/central-african-republic-verge-of-genocide Unspeakable horrors in a country on the verge of genocide] The Guardian, Retrieved 23 November 2013</ref>

The Central African Republic is a landlocked nation within the interior of the African continent. It is bordered by Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo. The country lies between latitudes [[2nd parallel north|2°]] and [[11th parallel north|11°N]], and longitudes [[14th meridian east|14°]] and [[28th meridian east|28°E]].

Much of the country consists of flat, or rolling plateau [[savanna]], typically about {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} above [[sea level]], of which most of the northern half lies within the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s [[East Sudanian savanna]] [[ecoregion]]. As well as the Fertit Hills in the northeast of the CAR, there are scattered hills in the southwest. To the northwest is the Yade Massif, a [[granite]] plateau with an altitude of {{convert|1,143|ft|m|0}}.

At {{convert|622,941|km2|sqmi|0}}, the Central African Republic is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|world's 45th-largest country]]. It is comparable in size to [[Ukraine]], and is somewhat smaller than the US state of [[Texas]].

Much of the southern border is formed by [[Tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Congo River]], with the [[Mbomou River]] in the east merging with the [[Uele River]] to form the [[Ubangi River]]. In the west, the [[Sangha River]] flows through part of the country. The eastern border lies along the edge of the [[Nile River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]].

It has been estimated that up to 8% of the country is covered by forest, with the densest parts in the south. The forest is highly diverse in nature and includes commercially important species of [[Ayous]], [[Sapele|Sapelli]] and [[Sipo (timber)|Sipo]].<ref>[http://www.forestsmonitor.org/en/reports/540539 Sold Down the River (English) March 2001], [[Forests Monitor]]</ref> The deforestation rate is 0.4% per annum, and lumber poaching is commonplace.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080705033010/http://carpe.umd.edu/resources/Documents/THE_FORESTS_OF_THE_CONGO_BASIN_State_of_the_Forest_2006.pdf/view The Forests of the Congo Basin: State of the Forest 2006]. CARPE  13 July 2007</ref>

In the November 2008 issue of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', the Central African Republic was named the country least affected by [[light pollution]].

{{main|Prefectures of the Central African Republic|Sub-prefectures of the Central African Republic}}
{{Prefectures of the Central African Republic Image Map}}

The Central African Republic is divided into 14 administrative [[prefecture]]s (''préfectures''), along with two economic prefectures (''préfectures economiques'') and one autonomous [[Commune (subnational entity)|commune]]. The prefectures are further divided into 71 sub-prefectures (''sous-préfectures'').

The [[prefectures of the Central African Republic|prefectures]] are [[Bamingui-Bangoran]], [[Basse-Kotto]], [[Haute-Kotto]], [[Haut-Mbomou]], [[Kémo]], [[Lobaye]], [[Mambéré-Kadéï]], [[Mbomou]], [[Nana-Mambéré]], [[Ombella-M'Poko]], [[Ouaka]], [[Ouham]], [[Ouham-Pendé]] and [[Vakaga]].

The two economic prefectures are [[Nana-Grébizi]] and [[Sangha-Mbaéré]], while the commune is the capital city [[Bangui]].

=== Climate ===
{{main|Climate of the Central African Republic}}

The climate of the Central African Republic is generally [[Tropics|tropical]], with a [[wet season]] that lasts from June to September in the north of the country, and from May to October in the south. During the wet season there are rainstorms on an almost daily basis and there is often early morning [[fog]]. Maximum annual precipitation is {{convert|71|in|mm}} in the upper Ubangi region.<ref>''Central African Republic: Country Study Guide volume 1'', p. 24.</ref>

Despite the veneer of stability during that era, Bozizé's rule was plagued with heavy corruption, underdevelopment, nepotism, and authoritarianism, leading to an open rebellion against the Bozizé government by an alliance of armed opposition factions known as the Séléka Coalition during the Central African Republic Bush War and the 2012–2013 Central African Republic conflict that eventually led to his overthrow on 24 March 2013.

== Human rights ==
{{main|Human rights in the Central African Republic}}

The 2009 Human Rights Report by the [[United States Department of State]] noted that, in general, the CAR's human rights record remained poor. Concerns were expressed over numerous government abuses.<ref name="2009 Human Rights Report">[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/af/135944.htm 2009 Human Rights Report: Central African Republic].

From 1972 to 1990, and in 2002 and 2003, the CAR was rated 'Not Free' by [[Freedom House]].

According to the [[United States State Department|U.S. State Department]], major human rights abuses occur in the country. These include: [[Extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial executions]] by security forces; the [[torture]], beating and [[rape]] of suspects and prisoners; impunity, particularly among the armed forces; harsh and life-threatening conditions in [[prison]]s and detention centers; arbitrary [[arrest]] and [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]], prolonged [[Remand (detention)|pretrial detention]] and denial of a [[Right to a fair trial|fair trial]]; restrictions on freedom of movement; official [[corruption]]; and restrictions on [[Labor rights|workers' rights]].

The Central African Armed Forces were established in 1960. In 2009, the Central African Republic began seeking investments from [[Central African Republic–China relations|China]].

=== Foreign aid ===

The Central African Republic is heavily dependent upon [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] foreign [[aid]] and the presence of numerous [[NGO]]s which provide services which the government fails to provide. As one [[UNDP]] official put it, the CAR is a country "sous serum", or a country metaphorically hooked up to [[Intravenous therapy|an IV]]. (Mehler 2005:150). The very presence of numerous foreign personnel and organizations in the country, including peacekeepers and even refugee camps, provides an important source of revenue for many Central Africans.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph. A full citation is needed for Mehler 2005:150}}

Much of the country is self-sufficient in food crops. [[Livestock]] development is hindered by the presence of the [[tsetse fly]].

In 2006, due to ongoing violence, over 50,000 people in the country's northwest were at risk of starvation.<ref>[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=58581 CAR: Food shortages increase as fighting intensifies in the northwest].  irinnews.org, 29 March 2006</ref> This was only averted thanks to [[United Nations]] support.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}

{{main|Economy of the Central African Republic}}

[[List of banks in the Central African Republic|Banks in the Central African Republic]] dispense the [[Central African CFA franc|CFA franc]], which is accepted in a number of different countries. Agriculture is dominated by the cultivation and sale of food crops such as [[cassava]], [[peanut]]s, [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[sesame]], and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]. The annual real GDP [[Economic growth|growth rate]] is just above 3%. The importance of food crops over exported [[cash crops]] is indicated by the fact that the total production of cassava, the staple food of most Central Africans, ranges between 200,000 and 300,000 [[tonnes]] a year, while the production of [[cotton]], the principal exported cash crop, ranges from 25,000 to 45,000 tonnes a year. Food crops are not exported in large quantities, but they still constitute the principal cash crops of the country, because Central Africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of surplus food crops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or coffee.{{citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph}}

[[File:Tree map export 2009 Central African Republic.jpeg|thumb|left|Graphical depiction of Central African Republic's product exports in 28 color-coded categories]]
The Republic's primary import partner is [[South Korea]] (45.8%). Other imports come from [[Netherlands]] (8.8%), France (7.2%) and [[Cameroon]] (5.1%).

The [[per capita income]] of the Republic is often listed as being around $300 a year, said to be [[List of countries by GNI (PPP) per capita|one of the lowest in the world]], but this figure is based mostly on reported sales of exports and largely ignores such unregistered sale of foods, locally produced [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[diamond]]s, [[ivory]], [[bushmeat]] and [[traditional medicine]]. For most Central Africans, the [[informal economy]] of the CAR is more important than the formal economy.{{citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph}} Among the [[Mining industry of the Central African Republic|mining industry]], diamonds constitute the country's most important export, accounting for 40–55% of export revenues, but it is estimated that between 30% and 50% of those produced each year leave the country clandestinely. Export trade is hindered by poor economic development and the country's location away from the coast.{{citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph}}

The wilderness regions of this country represent potential [[ecotourist]] destinations. In the southwest, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park is located in a rain forest area. The country is noted for its population of [[forest elephant]]s and [[western lowland gorilla]]s. To the north, the [[Manovo-Gounda St Floris National Park]] is well-populated with wildlife, including [[leopard]]s, [[lion]]s, and [[Rhinoceros|rhinos]]. The [[Bamingui-Bangoran National Park]] is located in the north-east of CAR.
