{{Manner of articulation}}

'''Approximants''' are [[phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]] that involve the [[manner of articulation|articulators]] approaching each other but not narrowly enough<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1975|p=277}}</ref> nor with enough articulatory precision<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez-Celdrán|2004|p=201}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}</ref> to create turbulent airflow. Therefore, approximants fall between [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], which do produce a turbulent airstream, and [[vowel]]s, which produce no turbulence.<ref name="Martínez-Celdrán 2004 201">{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez-Celdrán|2004|p=201}}</ref> This class of sounds includes [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] approximants like {{IPA|[l]}} (as in ''less''), non-lateral approximants like {{IPA|[ɹ]}} (as in ''rest''), and [[semivowels]] like {{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} (as in ''yes'' and ''west'', respectively).<ref name="Martínez-Celdrán 2004 201"/>

Before [[Peter Ladefoged]] coined the term "approximant" in the 1960s<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez-Celdrán|2004|p=201}}, pointing to {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1964|p=25}}</ref> the term "frictionless continuant" referred to non-lateral approximants.

==Semivowels==
{{main|Semivowel}}
Some approximants resemble vowels in acoustic and articulatory properties and the terms ''[[semivowel]]'' and ''glide'' are often used for these non-syllabic vowel-like segments. The correlation between semivowels and vowels is strong enough that cross-language differences between semivowels correspond with the differences between their related vowels.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=323}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Maddieson|Emmorey|1985}}</ref>

Vowels and their corresponding semivowels alternate in many languages depending on the phonological environment, or for grammatical reasons, as is the case with [[Indo-European ablaut]]. Similarly, languages often avoid configurations where a semivowel precedes its corresponding vowel.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|p=680}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Kawasaki|1982}}</ref> A number of phoneticians distinguish between semivowels and approximants by their location in a syllable. Although he uses the terms interchangeably, {{Harvcoltxt|Montreuil|2004|p=104}} remarks that, for example, the final glides of English ''par'' and ''buy'' differ from French ''par'' ('through') and ''baille'' ('tub') in that, in the latter pair, the approximants appear in the [[syllable coda]], whereas, in the former, they appear in the [[syllable nucleus]]. This means that opaque (if not minimal) contrasts can occur in languages like [[Italian language|Italian]] (with the i-like sound of ''piede'' 'foot', appearing in the nucleus: {{IPA|[ˈpi̯eˑde]}}, and that of ''piano'' 'slow', appearing in the syllable onset: {{IPA|[ˈpjaˑno]}})<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Montreuil|2004|p=104}}</ref> and Spanish (with a near minimal pair being ''abyecto'' {{IPA|[aβˈjekto]}} 'abject' and ''abierto'' {{IPA|[aˈβi̯erto]}} 'opened').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Saporta|1956|p=288}}</ref>

:{{note|Retroflex|*}} Because of the articulatory complexities of the American English rhotic, there is some variation in its phonetic description. A transcription with the IPA character for an [[alveolar approximant]] ({{IPA|[ɹ]}}) is common, though the sound is more [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]]. Actual retroflexion may occur as well and both occur as variations of the same sound.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hallé|Best|Levitt|1999|p=283}} citing {{Harvcoltxt|Delattre|Freeman|1968}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Zawadzki|Kuehn|1980}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Boyce|Espy-Wilson|1997}}</ref> However, {{Harvcoltxt|Catford|1988|p=161f}} makes a distinction between the vowels of American English (which he calls "rhotacized") and vowels with "retroflexion" such as those that appear in [[Badaga language|Badaga]]; {{Harvcoltxt|Trask|1996|p=310}}, on the other hand, labels both as [[r-colored vowel|r-colored]] and notes that both have a lowered third [[formant]].<ref>Both cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Hamann|2003|pp=25–26}}</ref>

In articulation and often diachronically, [[palatal consonant|palatal]] approximants correspond to [[front vowel]]s, [[velar consonant|velar]] approximants to [[back vowel]]s, and labialized approximants to [[rounded vowel]]s. In American English, the [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]] approximant corresponds to the rhotic vowel. This can create alternations (as shown in the above table).

In addition to alternations, glides can be inserted to the left or the right of their corresponding vowels when occurring next to a hiatus.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|p=672}}</ref> For example, in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], medial {{IPA|/i/}} triggers the formation of an inserted {{IPA|[j]}} that acts as a syllable onset so that when the affix {{IPA|/-ist/}} is added to футбол ('football') to make футболіст 'football player', it's pronounced {{IPA|[futˈbo̞list]}} but маоїст ('[[Maoist]]'), with the same affix, is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈmao̞'''j'''ist]}} with a glide.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|pp=675–676}}</ref> [[Dutch language|Dutch]] has a similar process that extends to mid vowels:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|pp=677–678}}</ref>
* ''bioscoop'' → {{IPA|[bi'''j'''ɔskoːp]}} ('cinema')
* ''zee'' + ''en'' → {{IPA|[zeː'''j'''ə(n)]}} ('seas')
* ''fluor'' → {{IPA|[fly'''ɥ'''ɔr]}} ('fluor')
* ''reu'' + ''en'' → {{IPA|[rø'''ɥ'''ə(n)]}} ('male dogs')
* ''Rwanda'' → {{IPA|[ru'''ʋ'''andɐ]}} ('[[Rwanda]]')<ref name="Dutch">There is dialectal and allophonic variation in the realization of {{IPA|/ʋ/}}. For speakers who realize it as {{IPA|[ʋ]}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|p=683}} postulates an additional rule that changes any occurrence of {{IPA|[w]}} from glide insertion into {{IPA|[ʋ]}}.</ref>
* ''Boaz'' → {{IPA|[bo'''ʋ'''as]}} ('[[Boaz]]')<ref name="Dutch"/>

Similarly, vowels can be inserted next to their corresponding glide in certain phonetic environments. [[Sievers' law]] describes this behaviour for [[Germanic languages|Germanic]].

Non-high semivowels also occur. In colloquial [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speech, a process of glide-formation occurs, wherein one of two adjacent vowels becomes non-syllabic; this process includes mid vowels so that {{IPA|[dʱo̯a]}} ('cause to wish') features a non-syllabic mid vowel.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=323–324}}</ref> Spanish features a similar process and even nonsyllabic {{IPA|/a/}} can occur so that ''ahorita'' ('right away') is pronounced {{IPA|[a̯o̞ˈɾita]}}.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez-Celdrán|Fernández-Planas|Carrera-Sabaté|2003|pp=256–257}}</ref> It is not often clear, however, whether such sequences involve a semivowel (a consonant) or a diphthong (a vowel), and in many cases that may not be a meaningful distinction.

Although many languages have [[central vowel]]s {{IPA|[ɨ, ʉ]}}, which lie between back/velar {{IPA|[ɯ, u]}} and front/palatal {{IPA|[i, y]}}, there are few cases of a corresponding approximant {{IPA|[ ȷ̈]}}. One is in the Korean diphthong {{IPA|[ ȷ̈i]}} or {{IPA|[ɨ̯i]}},<ref>[https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/iverson/www/kordiph.pdf Ahn & Iverson (2006)]</ref> though this is more frequently analyzed as velar (as in the table above), and [[Mapudungun]] may be another: It has three high vowel sounds, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/ɨ/}} and three corresponding consonants, {{IPA|/j/}}, and {{IPA|/w/}}, and a third one is often described as a voiced unrounded velar fricative; some texts note a correspondence between this approximant and {{IPA|/ɨ/}} that is parallel to {{IPA|/j/}}–{{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}–{{IPA|/u/}}. An example is ''liq'' {{IPA|/ˈliɣ/}} ({{IPA|[ˈliɨ̯]}}?) ('white').<ref>Listen to a [http://www.logosdictionary.org/sound/mp/5119539_n.wav recording]</ref>

==Approximants versus fricatives==
In addition to less turbulence, approximants also differ from fricatives in the precision required to produce them.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Boersma|1997|p=12}}</ref> 
When emphasized, approximants may be slightly fricated (that is, the airstream may become slightly turbulent), which is reminiscent of fricatives. For example, the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''ayuda'' ('help') features a palatal approximant that is pronounced as a fricative in emphatic speech.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez-Celdrán|2004|p=204}}</ref> However, such frication is generally slight and intermittent, unlike the strong turbulence of fricative consonants. 

Because voicelessness has comparatively reduced resistance to air flow from the lungs, the increased air flow creates more turbulence, making acoustic distinctions between voiceless approximants (which are extremely rare cross-linguistically<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Blevins|2006|p=13}}</ref>) and voiceless fricatives difficult.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ohala|1995|p=8}}</ref> This is why, for example, the voiceless labialized velar approximant {{IPA|[w̥]}} (also transcribed with the special letter {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ʍ}}}}) has traditionally been labeled a fricative, and no language is known to contrast it with a voiceless labialized velar fricative {{IPA|[xʷ]}}.<ref name="Ladefoged 1996 326">{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=326}}</ref> Similarly, [[Standard Tibetan]] has a voiceless [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] approximant, {{IPA|[l̥]}}, and [[Welsh phonology|Welsh]] has a voiceless lateral fricative {{IPA|[ɬ]}}, but the distinction is not always clear from descriptions of these languages.  Again, no language is known to contrast the two.<ref name="Ladefoged 1996 326"/>  [[Iaai language|Iaai]] is reported to have an unusually large number of voiceless approximants, with {{IPA|/l̥ ɥ̊ w̥/}}.

For places of articulation further back in the mouth, languages do not contrast voiced fricatives and approximants. Therefore the IPA allows the symbols for the voiced fricatives to double for the approximants, with or without a lowering [[diacritic]]. 

Occasionally, the glottal "fricatives" are called approximants, since {{IPA|[h]}} typically has no more frication than voiceless approximants, but they are often [[phonation]]s of the glottis without any accompanying manner or place of articulation.

==Central approximants==

*[[bilabial approximant]] {{IPA|[β̞]}} (usually transcribed {{angle bracket|{{IPA|β}}}})
*[[labiodental approximant]] {{IPA|[ʋ]}}
*[[dental approximant]] {{IPA|[ð̞]}} (usually transcribed {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ð}}}})
*[[alveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹ]}}
*[[retroflex approximant]] {{IPA|[ɻ&thinsp;]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[ɚ]}})
*[[palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[j]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[i]}})
*[[velar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɰ]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[ɯ]}})
*[[uvular approximant]] {{IPA|[ʁ̞]}} (usually transcribed {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ʁ}}}})
*[[pharyngeal approximant]] {{IPA|[ʕ̞]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[ɑ]}}; usually transcribed {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ʕ}}}})
*[[epiglottal approximant]] {{IPA|[ʢ̞]}} (usually transcribed {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ʢ}}}})

==Lateral approximants==
In lateral approximants, the center of tongue makes solid contact with the roof of the mouth. However, the defining location is the side of the tongue, which only approaches the teeth. 

*[[alveolar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[l]}}
*[[retroflex lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[ɭ]}}
*[[palatal lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[ʎ]}}
*[[velar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[ʟ]}}
*[[velarized alveolar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[ɫ] or [lˠ]}}

==Coarticulated approximants with dedicated IPA symbols==

*[[labialized velar approximant]] {{IPA|[w]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[u]}})
*[[labial-palatal approximant|labialized palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[ɥ] or [jʷ]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[y]}})

==Voiceless approximants==
Voiceless approximants are rarely distinguished from voiceless fricatives. Some of them are:

*[[voiceless alveolar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[l̥]}}
*[[voiceless palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[j̊]}}
*[[voiceless labialized palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[ɥ̊]}} or {{IPA|[j̊ʷ]}}
*[[voiceless labio-velar approximant|voiceless labialized velar approximant]] {{IPA|[ʍ]}} or {{IPA|[w̥]}}
*[[voiceless glottal approximant]] {{IPA|[h]}}
*[[voiceless nasal glottal approximant]] {{IPA|[h̃]}}
