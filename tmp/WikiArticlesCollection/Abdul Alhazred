'''Abdul Alhazred''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] created by [[United States|American]] horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. He is the so-called "Mad [[Arab]]" credited with authoring the fictional book ''Kitab al-Azif'' (the ''[[Necronomicon]]''), and as such is an integral part of [[Cthulhu Mythos]] lore.

==Name==
{{original research|section|date=February 2013}}{{weasel|section|date=February 2013}}
The name ''Abdul Alhazred'' is a pseudonym that Lovecraft created in his youth, which he took on after reading ''[[1001 Arabian Nights]]'' at the age of about five. The name was invented either by Lovecraft, or by Albert Baker, the Phillips' family lawyer.<ref>Harms, p. 7, ''The Encyclopedia Cthulhiana''.</ref> ''[[Abdul]]'' is a common Arabic name component (but never a name by itself; additionally the ending -ul and the beginning Al- are redundant), but ''Alhazred'' may allude to ''Hazard'', a reference to the book's destructive and dangerous nature, or to Lovecraft's ancestors by that name.<ref>L. Sprague de Camp, ''Lovecraft, a Biography''. Ballantine, 1976.</ref><ref>[http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=REG&db=glencoe&id=I6863 Rootsweb page on Lovecraft's family tree, showing his Hazard ancestry.]</ref> It might also have been a play on "all-has-read", since Lovecraft was an avid reader in youth.<ref>Pearsall, "Alhazred, Abdul", ''The Lovecraft Lexicon'', p. 55.</ref>

Another possibility, raised in an essay by the Swedish fantasy writer and editor Rickard Berghorn, is that the name ''Alhazred'' was influenced by references to two historical authors whose names were Latinized as ''Alhazen'': Alhazen ben Josef, who translated [[Ptolemy]] into [[Arabic language|Arabic]]; and [[Alhazen|Abu 'Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham]], who wrote about optics, mathematics and physics. Ibn al-Haytham is said to have pretended to be mad to escape the wrath of a ruler.<ref>[http://www.alephbok.se/alhazen_alhazred.html Rickard Berghorn "Alhazen och Alhazred"] {{sv icon}}</ref>

''Abdul Alhazred'' is not a real [[Arabic name]], and seems to contain the Arabic definite article morpheme ''al-'' twice in a row (anomalous in terms of [[Arabic grammar]]). The more proper Arabic form might be ''Abd-al-Hazred'' or ''Abdul Hazred''. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translations, his name has appeared as ''Abdullah {{Unicode|Al[[Heth|ḥ]]a [[ẓ]]red}}'' (عبدالله الحظرد): Arabic ''{{transl|ar|ḥaẓra}}''حظر = "he fenced in", "he prohibited". Hazred could come from the Arabic word "Hazrat" meaning Great Lord with a twist that makes it sound like "red" and "hazard" both indicative of danger. It is also thought by some to be a corruption of sorts on the phrase "All has read," to imply he has read lots, and has immense amounts of knowledge. However Abdul is a common Arabic prefix meaning "Servant" and "Al" is Arabic for "the", and if "hazra" means "he prohibited", "he fenced in" or "Great Lord", then the name would mean "Servant of the Prohibited", "Servant of the Fenced in", or "Servant of the Great Lord" which would make sense considering his role, even if it is not a proper Arabic name.

Similarly, an article{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} (written from an in-universe perspective) in the ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' [[tabletop role-playing game]] speculates that it may be a corruption of ''Abd Al-Azrad'', which it claims translates to ''The Worshipper of the Great Devourer''.

The phrase "mad Arab", sometimes with both words capitalized in Lovecraft's stories, is used so commonly before Alhazred's name that it almost constitutes a title. A reference to the "Mad Arab" in [[Cthulhu Mythos]] fiction is invariably a synonym for Abdul Alhazred. Later writers sometimes preface Alhazred with words such as "monk" (such as in the [[Chick Publications|Chick]] parody tract [http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=135 "Who will be Eaten First?"] by [[Howard Hallis]]) or "scholar" replacing Arab to avoid any racist overtones.

==Biography==

===H. P. Lovecraft===
{{wikisource|History of the Necronomicon}}
According to Lovecraft's "History of the Necronomicon" (written 1927, first published [[1938 in literature|1938]]), Alhazred was:

:a mad poet of [[Sanaá]], in [[Yemen]], who is said to have flourished during the period of the [[Umayyad|Ommiade]] [[caliph]]s, circa 700 A.D. He visited the ruins of [[Babylon]] and the subterranean secret of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and spent ten years alone in the great southern desert of [[Arabia]]&mdash;the [[Rub' al Khali|Roba El Khaliyeh]] or "Empty Space" of the ancients&mdash;and "[[Al-Dahna Desert|Dahna]]" or "Crimson" desert of the modern Arabs, which is held to be inhabited by protective evil spirits and monsters of death. Of this desert many strange and unbelievable marvels are told by those who pretend to have penetrated it. In his last years Alhazred dwelt in [[Damascus]].

In 730, while still living in Damascus, Alhazred supposedly wrote a book of ultimate evil in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], ''al-Azif'', which would later become known as the ''Necronomicon''. Those who have dealings with this book usually come to an unpleasant end, and Alhazred was no exception. Again according to Lovecraft's "History":

:Of his final death or disappearance (738 A.D.) many terrible and conflicting things are told. He is said by [[Ibn Khallikan|Ebn Khallikan]] (12th cent. biographer) to have been seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of fright-frozen witnesses. Of his madness many things are told. He claimed to have seen the fabulous [[Iram of the Pillars|Irem]], or City of Pillars, and to have found beneath the ruins of [[The Nameless City|a certain nameless desert town]] the shocking annals and secrets of a race older than mankind. He was only an indifferent [[Muslim|Moslem]], worshipping unknown entities whom he called [[Yog-Sothoth]] and [[Cthulhu]].

===August Derleth===

[[August Derleth]] later made alterations to the biography of Alhazred, such as redating his death to 731. Derleth also changed Alhazred's final fate, as described in his [[short story]] "[[The Trail of Cthulhu|The Keeper of the Key]]", first published in May [[1951 in literature|1951]]. In the story, [[The Trail of Cthulhu#Laban Shrewsbury|Professor Laban Shrewsbury]] (a recurring Derleth character) and his assistant at the time, [[The Trail of Cthulhu#Nayland Colum|Nayland Colum]], discover Alhazred's burial site.

While the two are heading a caravan from [[Salalah]], [[Oman]], they cross the border into [[Yemen]] and find the unexplored desert area that the ''Necronomicon'' calls "Roba el Ehaliyeh" or "Roba el Khaliyeh" — presumably a reference to the [[Empty Quarter]] or "Rub al Khali".

At the center of the area they discover the [[Nameless City]] (the setting of the Lovecraft story of the same name) and in Derleth's text the domain of the [[Great Old One]] [[Hastur]]. Shrewsbury, an old agent of Hastur and the devoted enemy of Hastur's half-brother, Cthulhu, crosses its gates in search of Alhazred's burial site.

He indeed finds Alhazred's [[burial chamber]] and learns of his fate. Alhazred had been kidnapped in [[Damascus]] and brought to the Nameless City, where he had earlier studied and learned some of the ''Necronomicon''{{'}}s lore. As punishment for betraying their secrets, Alhazred was tortured. Then they blinded him, severed his tongue and executed him.

Although the entrance to the chamber warns against disturbing him, Shrewsbury opens Alhazred's [[sarcophagus]] anyway, finding that only rags, bones, and dust remain of Alhazred. However, the sarcophagus also contains Alhazred's personal, incomplete copy of the ''Necronomicon'', written in the [[Arabic alphabet]]. Shrewsbury then uses [[necromancy]] to recall Alhazred's spirit and orders it to draw a map of the world as he knew it. After obtaining the map, which reveals the location of [[R'lyeh]] and other secret places, Shrewsbury finally lets Alhazred return to his eternal rest.

==In non-Mythos fiction==
{{example farm|section|date=February 2013}}
Like his creation the ''Necronomicon'', Alhazred is often referenced in works that are not generally considered part of the Cthulhu Mythos, either as a subtle nod to Lovecraft or to create a connection to his world.

In ''[[Diablo III]]'', a travelling scholar named "Abd al-Hazir" is the narrator for many of the game's features.  Given the similarities in the two characters' names, professions, written works and generally dark subject matter, it is likely{{weasel-inline|date=January 2013}} that Lovecraft's Alhazred provided the main inspiration for al-Hazir.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The [[Mercyful Fate]] albums ''[[Time (Mercyful Fate album)|Time]]'' and ''[[Into the Unknown (Mercyful Fate album)|Into the Unknown]]'' reference Alhazred.

The MMORPG ''Wizard101'' features a Krok called Alhazred who teaches Balance magic.

A statue of Alhazred makes a cameo appearance as the "Mad Scholar" in Graham McNeill's book ''A Thousand Sons''. This novel features sorcerers who become destroyed by forbidden knowledge and takes place in the ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' setting, itself utilizing Lovecraftian themes.

Abdul Alhazred acts as [[vizier]] to King Calaphim and Queen Allaria in the Land of the Green Isles in ''[[King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow]]''.

In the game ''[[999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors]]'', the library contains a book called ''Kitab as-Azif''. The character Snake says it was written by Abdul Alhazred and was said to be one of the books used in the creation of the ''[[Necronomicon]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

A book by Al-Hazred is mentioned in ''[[The Atrocity Archives]]'' by [[Charles Stross]].

In the Novel ''Metrom ''by Andrew Knaut, Abdul Alhazred was in an elite Esis protection team known as Vel Team L-Viathan. He was banished after contacting Esis on Gabrielle DuMont's whereabouts and lived in the Waste alone. When meeting his old team he caused his best friend and partner Zan Farkafk to go insane.

In the novel, ''A Night in the Lonesome October'' by [[Roger Zelazny]], a character carries an icon painted by Alhazred known as the Alhazred Icon.
