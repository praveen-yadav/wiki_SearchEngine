'''''Aloe''''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|oʊ}}, also ''Aloë'', is a [[genus]] containing over 500 [[species]] of [[flowering plant|flowering]] [[succulent plant|succulent]] [[plant]]s.<ref name="TPL">The Plant List (2010). Version 1. Published on the Internet; http://www.theplantlist.org/ (accessed July 2013)</ref>  The most widely known species is ''[[Aloe vera]]'', or "true aloe", so called because, though probably extinct in the wild, it is cultivated as the standard source of so-called "aloe vera" for assorted pharmaceutical purposes.<ref name=NIH>{{cite web |url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/aloevera |title=Aloe Vera: Science and Safety |publisher=NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine |date=April 2012 |accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref> Other species, such as ''[[Aloe ferox]]'', also are cultivated or harvested from the wild for similar applications. 

The genus is [[native plant|native]] to Africa; species are found in southern Africa, the mountains of tropical Africa, various islands off the coast of Africa including Sardinia, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula.

The [[APG III system]] (2009) places the genus in the family [[Xanthorrhoeaceae]], subfamily [[Asphodeloideae]].<ref name="Stevens 2001 onwards">{{Cite web |last=Stevens |first=P.F. |year=2001 onwards |title=Angiosperm Phylogeny Website: Asparagales: Asphodeloideae |url=http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/orders/asparagalesweb.htm#Asphodelaceae }}</ref> In the past, it has also been assigned to families [[Aloaceae]] and [[Liliaceae]] or lily family. The plant ''[[Agave americana]]'', which is sometimes called "American aloe", belongs to the [[Asparagaceae]], a different family.

The genus is native to tropical and southern Africa, Madagascar, and Jordan to the Arabian Peninsula.<ref name="WCSP_297004">{{Cite web |chapter=''Aloe''|title=World Checklist of Selected Plant Families |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] |url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=297004 |accessdate=2013-02-25}}</ref>

==Description==

Most ''Aloe'' species have a [[rosette (botany)|rosette]] of large, thick, fleshy [[Leaf|leaves]]. ''Aloe'' [[flower]]s are tubular, frequently yellow, orange, pink, or red, and are borne, densely clustered and pendant, at the apex of simple or branched, leafless stems. Many species of ''Aloe'' appear to be stemless, with the rosette growing directly at ground level; other varieties may have a branched or unbranched [[plant stem|stem]] from which the fleshy leaves spring. They vary in color from grey to bright-green and are sometimes striped or [[mottle]]d. Some aloes native to South Africa are tree-like (arborescent).<ref name=RoddStackhouse>{{cite book|last=Rodd|first=Tony|title=Trees: a Visual Guide|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520256507|page=131|coauthors=Stackhouse, Jennifer}}</ref>

==Systematics==

The [[APG III system]] (2009) places the genus in the family [[Xanthorrhoeaceae]], subfamily [[Asphodeloideae]].<ref name="Stevens 2001 onwards"/> In the past it has also been assigned to the families [[Liliaceae]] and Aloeaceae, as well as the family Asphodelaceae, before this was merged into the Xanthorrhoeaceae.

The [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of the genus has varied widely. Many genera, such as ''Lomatophyllum'',<ref name="WCSP_280369">{{Cite web |chapter=''Lomatophyllum''|title=World Checklist of Selected Plant Families |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] |url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=280369 |accessdate=2013-02-25}}</ref> have been brought into [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymy]]. Species at one time placed in ''Aloe'', such as ''[[Agave americana]]'', have been moved to other genera.<ref name="WCSP_297041">{{Cite web |chapter=''Aloe americana''|title=World Checklist of Selected Plant Families |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] |url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=297041 |accessdate=2013-02-25}}</ref>

==Uses==

{{Refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
Aloe species are frequently cultivated as ornamental plants both in gardens and in pots. Many aloe species are highly decorative and are valued by collectors of succulents.  ''Aloe vera'' is used both internally and externally on humans, and is claimed to have some medicinal effects, which have been supported by scientific and medical research.<ref name=NIH/> They can also be made into types of special soaps.

===Historical uses===

Historical use of various aloe species is well documented. Documentation of the clinical effectiveness is available, although relatively limited.<ref name=NIH/><ref>{{cite book|title=Aloes: the Genus ''Aloe'' |year=2004 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |isbn=978-0-415-30672-0 |editor=Tom Reynolds}}</ref>

Of the 500+ species, only a few were used traditionally as a [[herbal medicine]], ''Aloe vera'' again being the most commonly used species.  Also included are ''A. perryi'' and ''A. ferox''. The Ancient Greeks and Romans used ''Aloe vera'' to treat wounds. In the Middle Ages, the yellowish liquid found inside the leaves was favored as a [[purgative]].{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} Unprocessed aloe that contains [[aloin]] is generally used as a laxative, whereas processed juice does not usually contain significant aloin.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Some species, particularly ''Aloe vera'', are used in alternative medicine and first aid. Both the translucent inner pulp and the resinous yellow aloin from wounding the aloe plant are used externally to relieve skin discomforts. As an herbal medicine, ''Aloe vera'' juice is commonly used internally to relieve digestive discomfort.<ref name=altmed>{{cite web|url=http://altmedicine.about.com/od/therapiesfrometol/a/heartburn.htm |title=Heartburn Remedies |last=Wong |first=Cathy |date=September 15, 2012 |work=About.com}}</ref><ref name=IBS>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/546327|title=Aloe IBS study}}</ref>  

Relatively few studies about possible benefits of aloe gel taken internally have been conducted. Components of ''Aloe'' have shown the possibility of inhibiting tumor growth in animal studies, but these effects have not been demonstrated clinically in humans.<ref name="pmid17613130">{{cite journal |title=Final report on the safety assessment of ''Aloe andongensis'' extract, ''Aloe andongensis'' leaf juice, ''Aloe arborescens'' leaf extract, ''Aloe arborescens'' leaf juice, ''Aloe arborescens'' leaf protoplasts, ''Aloe barbadensis'' flower extract, ''Aloe barbadensis'' leaf, ''Aloe barbadensis'' leaf extract, ''Aloe barbadensis'' leaf juice, ''Aloe barbadensis'' leaf polysaccharides, ''Aloe barbadensis'' leaf water, ''Aloe ferox'' leaf extract, ''Aloe ferox'' leaf juice, and ''Aloe ferox'' leaf juice extract |journal=Int.

According to [[Cancer Research UK]], a potentially deadly product called T-UP is made of concentrated aloe, and promoted as a cancer cure. They say "there is currently no evidence that aloe products can help to prevent or treat cancer in humans".<ref>{{cite web

===Aloin in OTC laxative products===
On May 9, 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a final rule banning the use of aloin, the yellow sap of the aloe plant, for use as a laxative ingredient in [[over-the-counter drug]] products.<ref name="pmid12001972">{{cite journal |title=Status of certain additional over-the-counter drug category II and III active ingredients.

===Chemical properties ===
According to W. A. Shenstone, two classes of aloins are recognized: (1) nataloins, which yield [[picric acid|picric]] and [[oxalic acid]]s with [[nitric acid]], and do not give a red coloration with nitric acid; and (2) [[barbaloin]]s, which yield aloetic acid (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), chrysammic acid (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid, being reddened by the acid. This second group may be divided into a-barbaloins, obtained from Barbados ''Aloe'', and reddened in the cold, and b-barbaloins, obtained from Socotrine and Zanzibar ''Aloe'', reddened by ordinary nitric acid only when warmed or by fuming acid in the cold. Nataloin (2C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>13</sub>O<sub>7</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O) forms bright-yellow scales, barbaloin (C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>18</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) [[Prism (geometry)|prism]]atic crystals. ''Aloe'' species also contain a trace of volatile oil, to which their odour is due.{{citation needed|date=April 2007}}
