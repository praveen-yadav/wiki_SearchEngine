The '''Chechen Republic''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|tʃ|ɨ|n}}; {{lang-ru|Чече́нская Респу́блика}}, ''Chechenskaya Respublika''; {{lang-ce|Нохчийн Республика}}, ''Noxçiyn Respublika''), commonly referred to as '''Chechnya''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|tʃ|n|i|ə}}; {{lang-ru|Чечня́}}, ''Chechnya''; {{lang-ce|Нохчийчоь}}, ''Noxçiyçö''), also spelled ''Chechnia'' or ''Chechenia'', sometimes referred to as '''Ichkeria''' ({{lang-en|Land of Minerals|links=yes}}), is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] (a [[republics of Russia|republic]]) of [[Russia]]. It is located in the [[North Caucasus]], situated in the southernmost part of [[Eastern Europe]], and within 100 kilometers of the [[Caspian Sea]].<ref>[http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/europe/chechnya.htm Chechnya: The World Atlas] Retrieved on April 24, 2013</ref> The [[capital city|capital]] of the republic is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Grozny]]. As of the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]], the republic had a population of 1,268,989 people,<ref name="2010Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}</ref> predominantly of the [[Chechen people|Chechen]] ethnic group with a notable [[Russian people|Russian]] minority.

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Chechen-Ingush ASSR]] was split into two: the [[Republic of Ingushetia]] and the Chechen Republic. The latter proclaimed the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]], which sought independence. Following the [[First Chechen War]] with Russia, Chechnya gained ''de facto'' independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Russian federal control was restored during the [[Second Chechen War]]. Since then there has been a systematic reconstruction and rebuilding process, though [[Insurgency in the North Caucasus|sporadic fighting]] continues in the mountains and southern regions of the republic.

==History==
{{Main|History of Chechnya}}
===Origin of Chechnya's population===
According to [[Leonti Mroveli]], the 11th-century Georgian chronicler, the word Caucasian is derived from the [[Nakh peoples|Vainakh]] ancestor [[Caucas|Kavkas]].<ref>The work of Leonti Mroveli: "The history of the Georgian Kings"dealing with the history of Georgia and the [[Caucasus]] since ancient times to the 5th century AD, is included in medieval code of Georgian annals "Kartlis Tskhovreba".</ref>
"The Vainakhs are the ancient natives of the [[Caucasus]]. It is noteworthy, that according to the genealogical table drawn up by [[Leonti Mroveli]], the legendary forefather of the Vainakhs was "Kavkas", hence the name Kavkasians, one of the ethnicons met in the ancient Georgian written sources, signifying the ancestors of the [[Chechens]] and [[Ingush people|Ingush]]. As appears from the above, the Vainakhs, at least by name, are presented as the most "Caucasian" people of all the Caucasians (Caucasus - Kavkas - Kavkasians) in the Georgian historical tradition."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/1887/ |title=Caucasian Knot &#124; An Essay On the History of the Vainakh People.

{{Main|Caucasian War}}

In 1785, Russia and the western Christians of [[Kartl-Kakheti]] decided to rebel against the Ottomans and the Muslim Georgians [[Chveneburi]], Turkified Georgians the [[Meskhetians]], who were traditionally pro-Ottoman. The Christians signed the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]], according to which Kartl-Kakheti received protection from Russia. In order to secure communications with Kartli and other minority Christian regions of the Transcaucasia, the Russian Empire began brutal conquest in the Northern Caucasus mountains killing completely several [[Nakh]] tribes notably the [[Malkh]] and the [[Gargareans]] one of the most numerous Nakh tribes. That is why the popularity of Islam was gaining strength and viewed as the religion of liberation from despotic tsardom who viewed Nakh tribes as "bandits".<ref name="ling"/> The rebellion was leaded by  [[Mansur Ushurma]], a Chechen [[Naqshbandi]] ([[Sufi]]) sheikh—with wavering military support from other North Caucasian tribes. Mansur hoped to establish a [[Transcaucasus]] Islamic state under [[shari'a]] law, but was unable to fully achieve this because in the course of the war he was betrayed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]'s, handed to Russians, and executed in 1794.<ref>John Frederick Baddeley, ''The Russian Conquest of the Caucasus'', London, Curzon Press, 1999, p. 49.</ref>

However, the resistance of the [[Nakh]] tribes never ended and was a fertile ground for a new Muslim-[[Caucasian Avars|Avar]] commander [[Imam Shamil]], who fought against the Russians from 1834 until 1859. In 1859 Shamil was captured by Russians at aul Gunib but the commander left in charge by Shamil at Gunib, the one-armed one-legged, one-eyed Chechen [[Boysangur Benoiski]]<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO--iigYIes</ref> broke through the siege and continued to fight Russia in full scale warfare for another 2 years until he was captured and killed by Russians. Russian Tsar hoped that by sparing the life of Shamil the resistance in the North Caucasus stops. Unfortunately for Russia it didn't happen. Russia had to change the strategy. It began to use colonization tactic by destroying [[Nakh]] settlements and building Cossack defense lines in the lowlands and strawing the mountaineers. The strategy did not work either. Cossack suffered defeat after defeat and were constantly attacked by mountaineers' raids who were robbing them of food and weaponry.

The tsarists' regime uses a different approach at the end of 1860s they offered Chechens and Ingush to leave the Caucasus for the [[Ottoman Empire]] (see [[Muhajir (Caucasus)]]). It is estimated that about 80% of Chechens and Ingush left the Caucasus during the deportation. It weakened the resistance which went from open warfare to insurgent warfare. One of the notable Chechen resistance fighter at the end of 19th century was a Chechen [[abrek]] [[Zelimxan|Zelimkhan Gushmazukaev]] and his comrade-in-arms Ingush [[abrek]] [[Sulom-Beck Sagopshinski]]. Together they built up small units which constantly harassed Russian military convoys, government mints, and government post-service mainly in Ingushetia and Chechnya. Ingush aul Kek was completely burned when the Ingush refused to hand over Zelimkhan. Zelimkhan was killed in the beginning of the 20th century. The war between [[Nakh]] tribes and Russia continued into the times of [[Russian Revolution]] in their struggle against [[Anton Denikin]], and later against the [[Soviet Union|Reds]].

===Soviet rule===
[[File:Map of Mountain ASSR.png|thumb|left|The [[Mountain ASSR]] and the districts established after the [[Russian Civil War]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} (Chechnya is located on the far right)]]

Chechen rebellion would characteristically flare up whenever the Russian state faced a period of internal uncertainty. Rebellions occurred during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878|Russo-Turkish War]], the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the [[Russian Civil War]] (see [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]]), and [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Collectivization]]. Under Soviet rule, Chechnya was combined with [[Ingushetia]] to form the autonomous republic of [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Chechen-Ingushetia]] in the late 1930s.

Some Chechens again [[1940–1944 insurgency in Chechnya|rose up against Soviet rule]] during the 1940s, resulting in the [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportation]] of the entire [[Operation Lentil (Caucasus)|ethnic Chechen and Ingush populations]] to the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]] (later [[Kazakhstan]]) and [[Siberia]] in 1944 near the end of [[World War II]] where over 60% of Chechen and Ingush populations perished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3509933.stm |title=Remembering Stalin's deportations |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-02-23 |accessdate=2013-04-19}}</ref> The deportation was supposedly justified by the materials prepared by notorious [[NKVD]] officer [[Bogdan Kobulov]] accusing Chechens in a mass conspiracy preparing rebellion and providing assistance to the German forces.

The territory of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was divided between [[Stavropol Krai]] (where [[Grozny Okrug]] was formed), the [[Dagestan ASSR]], the [[North Ossetian ASSR]], and the [[Georgian SSR]].

The Chechens and Ingush were allowed to return to their land after 1956 during [[de-Stalinization]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]] when Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was restored but both boundaries and ethnic composition of the territory significantly changed.  There were many (predominantly Russian) migrants from other parts of the [[Soviet Union]], who often settled in the abandoned family homes of Chechens and Ingushes. The republic lost its [[Prigorodny District, Republic of North Ossetia–Alania|Prigorodny District]] transferred to North Ossetian ASSR but gain predominately Russian [[Naursky District]] and [[Shelkovskoy District]] that considered  the homeland for [[Terek Cossacks]].

The [[Russification]] policies towards Chechens continued after 1956, with [[Russian language]] proficiency required in many aspects of life and for advancement in the Soviet system.<ref name = "ling"/>

===Since 1990===
{{History of Chechnya}}
On November 26, 1990 the Supreme Council of Chechen-Ingush ASSR adopted the "Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Chechen-Ingush Republic". This declaration was part of the reorganization of the Soviet Union. This new treaty would have been signed August 22, 1991 which would have transformed 15 republic states into more than 80. [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|The August Coup]] (August 19–21, 1991) led to the abandonment of this reorganization.
With the impending dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, an independence movement, initially known as the ''Chechen National Congress'', was formed and led by ex-[[Soviet Air Force]] general and new Chechen President [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]] that rallied for the recognition of Chechnya as a separate nation. This movement was ultimately opposed by [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s [[Russia|Russian Federation]], which first argued that Chechnya had not been an independent entity within the Soviet Union—as the Baltic, Central Asian, and other Caucasian States had—but was part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] and hence did not have a right under the Soviet constitution to secede; second, that other [[republics of Russia]], such as [[Tatarstan]], would consider seceding from the Russian Federation if Chechnya were granted that right; and third, that Chechnya was a major hub in the oil infrastructure of the Federation and hence its secession would hurt the country's economy and energy access.

In the ensuing decade, the territory was locked in an ongoing struggle between various factions, usually fighting unconventionally and forgoing the position held by the several successive Russian governments through the current administration. Various demographic factors including religious ones have continued to keep the area in a near constant state of war.

====First Chechen War====
{{Main|First Chechen War}}

The First Chechen War took place over a two-year period that lasted from 1994 to 1996, when Russian forces attempted to regain control over Chechnya, which had declared independence in November 1991. Despite overwhelming numerical superiority in men, weaponry and [[air support]], the Russian forces were unable to establish effective permanent control over the mountainous area due to numerous successful [[Chechen people|Chechen]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] raids. For three months Russia lost more tanks (over 1997 tanks) in Grozny than during the [[Battle of Berlin]] in 1945.<ref>http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/1990s/1998/no-1129-september-1998/book-reviews-chechnya-small-victorious-war-capi</ref> 
The [[Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis]] in 1995 shocked the Russian public and led to international condemnation of the Chechen rebels. The widespread [[morale|demoralization]] of the Russian forces in the area and a successful offensive to re-take Grozny by Chechen resistance forces led by [[Aslan Maskhadov]] prompted [[Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] to declare a ceasefire in 1996 and sign a [[peace treaty]] a year later that saw a withdrawal of Russian forces.

====Inter-war period====
{{Main|Chechen Republic of Ichkeria}}

After the war, parliamentary and presidential elections took place in January 1997 in Chechnya and brought to power new President Aslan Maskhadov, chief of staff and [[Prime Minister of Chechnya|prime minister]] in the Chechen coalition government, for a five-year term. Maskhadov sought to maintain Chechen sovereignty while pressing [[Moscow]] to help rebuild the republic, whose formal economy and infrastructure were virtually destroyed.<ref>[http://www.freedomhouse.org/modules/mod_call_dsp_country-fiw.cfm?year=2003&country=2593 Chechnya, reference article by Freedom House publications. ]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> Russia continued to send money for the rehabilitation of the republic; it also provided pensions and funds for schools and hospitals.

In lieu of the devastated economic structure, kidnapping emerged as the principal source of income countrywide, procuring over $200 million during the three-year independence of the chaotic fledgling state,<ref>Tishkov, Valery.

President Maskhadov started a major campaign against hostage-takers, and on October 25, 1998, Shadid Bargishev, Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping official, was killed in a remote-controlled car bombing.  Bargishev's colleagues then insisted they would not be intimidated by the attack and would go ahead with their offensive. Political violence and religious extremism, blamed on "[[Wahhabism]]", was rife. In 1998, Grozny authorities declared a [[state of emergency]]. Tensions led to open clashes between the Chechen National Guard and Islamist militants, such as the July 1998 confrontation in Gudermes.

====Second Chechen War====
{{Main|Second Chechen War}}
The [[War of Dagestan]] began on 7 August 1999, during which the [[Islamic International Brigade]] (IIPB) began an unsuccessful incursion into the neighbouring Russian republic of [[Dagestan]] in favor of the [[Shura of Dagestan]] which sought independence from Russia.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9908/19/russia.dagestan.02/ Moscow again plans wider war in Dagestan] [[CNN]] Retrieved on April 23, 2013</ref> In September, a series of [[Russian apartment bombings|apartment bombs]] that killed around 300 people in several Russian cities, including Moscow, were blamed on the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechen]] separatists.

The Russian forces used brutal force, killing 60 Chechen civilians during a mop-up operation in Aldy, Chechnya on February 5, 2000. After the re-capture of [[Grozny]] in February 2000, the Ichkerian regime fell apart.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/chechnya2.htm Second Chechnya War - 1999-2006] Retrieved on April 23, 2013</ref>

At the end of the Soviet era, ethnic Russians (including Cossacks) comprised about 23% of the population (269,000 in 1989).

According to some Russian sources, from 1991 to 1994 tens of thousands of people of non-Chechen ethnicity (mostly Russians, Ukrainians and Armenians) left the [[republic]] amidst reports of violence and discrimination against the non-Chechen population, as well as widespread lawlessness and ethnic cleansing under the government of [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]], which is called by their source "ethnic cleansing".<ref>{{cite web|author=O.P.

However, regarding this exodus, there is an alternative view. According to the Russian economists Boris Lvin and Andrei Iliaronov,

<blockquote>
The Chechen authorities are regularly accused of crimes against the population, especially the Russian-speaking people. However, before the current war the emigration of the Russian-speaking population from Chechnya was no more intense than that from Kalmykia, Tuva and Sakha-Yakutia. In Grozny itself there remained a 200,000 strong Russian-speaking population which did not hasten to leave it.<ref>Written by economists Boris Lvin and [[Andrei Illarionov]]. ''Moscow News''. Feb 24- March 2, 1995</ref><ref>Note: This source is written in 1995; it should be noted that in the modern day, however, the Russian population is far less than 200000</ref>

The languages used in the Republic are [[Chechen language|Chechen]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Chechen belongs to the Vaynakh or [[North-central Caucasian languages|North-central Caucasian]] language family, which also includes [[Ingush language|Ingush]] and [[Batsb language|Batsb]]. Some scholars place it in a wider [[Iberian-Caucasian languages|Iberian-Caucasian super-family]].

Chechnya has one of the youngest populations in the generally aging Russian Federation; in the early 1990s, it was among the few regions experiencing natural population growth.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Chechnya}}

Since 1990, the Chechen Republic has had many legal, military, and civil conflicts involving separatist movements and pro-Russian authorities. Today, Chechnya is a relatively stable [[federal republic]], although there is still some separatist movement activity. Its regional constitution entered into effect on April 2, 2003 after an all-Chechen referendum was held on March 23, 2003. Some Chechens were controlled by regional [[teip]]s, or clans, despite the existence of pro- and anti-Russian political structures.

===Regional government===
[[File:Chechnya and Caucasus.png|thumb|right|Chechnya and Caucasus map]]

The former separatist religious leader (mufti) [[Akhmad Kadyrov]], looked upon as a traitor by many separatists, was elected president with 83% of the vote in an internationally monitored election on October 5, 2003. Incidents of [[ballot stuffing]] and voter intimidation by Russian soldiers and the exclusion of separatist parties from the polls were subsequently reported by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) monitors. On May 9, 2004, Kadyrov was assassinated in Grozny football stadium by a [[land mine|landmine]] explosion that was planted beneath a VIP stage and detonated during a parade, and [[Sergey Abramov]] was appointed to the position of acting prime minister after the incident. However, since 2005 [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] (son of Akhmad Kadyrov) has been caretaker prime minister, and in 2007 was appointed a new president. Many allege he is the wealthiest and most powerful man in the republic, with control over a large private militia referred to as the ''[[Kadyrovtsy]]''. The militia, which began as his father's security force, has been accused of killings and kidnappings by human rights organizations such as [[Human Rights Watch]].

In 2009, the American organization [[Freedom House]] included Chechnya in the "Worst of the Worst" list of most repressive societies in the world, together with [[Burma]], [[North Korea]], [[People's Republic of China|China]]'s [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] and others.<ref>[http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/WoW09/WOW%202009.pdf Worst of the Worst: The World's Most Repressive Societies] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]]), ''[[Freedom House]]'', March 2009</ref>

===Separatist government===
In addition to the Russian regional government, there was a separatist Ichkeria government that was not recognized by any state (although members have been given political asylum in European and Arab countries, as well as the United States).

Ichkeria is/was a member of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]]. Former president of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] deposed in a military coup of 1991 and a participant of the [[Georgian Civil War]], recognised the independence of Chechen Republic of Ichkeria in 1993.<ref name="test">[http://pirweli.com.ge/eng/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3399&Itemid=45 in 1993, ex –President of Georgia Zviad Gamsakhurdia recognized Chechnya ` s independence..],</ref>  Diplomatic relations with Ichkeria were also established by the partially recognized [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]] under the [[Taliban]] government on January 16, 2000. This recognition ceased with the fall of the Taliban in 2001.<ref>[http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/5597-11.cfm Are Chechens in Afghanistan?] --By Nabi Abdullaev, Dec 14, 2001 Moscow Times</ref> However, despite Taliban recognition, there were no friendly relations between the Taliban and Ichkeria- Maskhadov rejected their recognition, stating that the Taliban were illegitimate.<ref name="Kullberg">Kullberg, Anssi.

The president of this government was Aslan Maskhadov, the Foreign Minister was [[Ilyas Akhmadov]], who was the spokesman for Maskhadov. Aslan Maskhadov had been elected in an internationally monitored election in 1997 for 4 years, which took place after signing a peace agreement with Russia. In 2001 he issued a decree prolonging his office for one additional year; he was unable to participate in the 2003 presidential election, since separatist parties were barred by the Russian government, and Maskhadov faced accusations of terrorist offences in Russia. Maskhadov left Grozny and moved to the separatist-controlled areas of the south at the onset of the [[Second Chechen War]]. Maskhadov was unable to influence a number of warlords who retain effective control over Chechen territory, and his power was diminished as a result. Russian forces killed Maskhadov on March 8, 2005, and the assassination of Maskhadov was widely criticized since it left no legitimate Chechen separatist leader with whom to conduct peace talks. [[Akhmed Zakayev]], Deputy Prime Minister and a Foreign Minister under Maskhadov, was appointed shortly after the 1997 election and is currently living under asylum in [[England]]. He and others chose [[Abdul Khalim Saidullayev]], a relatively unknown Islamic judge who was previously the host of an Islamic program on Chechen television, to replace Maskhadov following his death. On June 17, 2006, it was reported that Russian special forces killed Abdul Khalim Saidullayev in a raid in a Chechen town Argun. The successor of Saidullayev became [[Doku Umarov]]. On October 31, 2007 Umarov abolished the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] and its presidency and in its place proclaimed the [[Caucasian Emirate]] with himself as its [[Emir]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itstime.it/Commenti/CaucEmiri.pdf |title=What is Hidden Behind the Idea of the Caucasian Emirate? |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-19}}</ref> This change of status has been rejected by many Chechen politicians and military leaders who continue to support the existence of the republic.

==Human rights==

In 2006 [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that pro-Moscow Chechen forces under the command, in effect, of chapter of republic [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], as well as federal police personnel, used torture to get information about separatist forces. "If you are detained in Chechnya, you face a real and immediate risk of torture. And there is little chance that your torturer will be held accountable", said Holly Cartner, Director Europe and Central Asia division of HRW.<ref>[[Human Rights Watch]]:[http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/11/12/chechnya-research-shows-widespread-and-systematic-use-torture Chechnya: Research Shows Widespread and Systematic Use of Torture]</ref>

Human rights groups criticized the conduct of the 2005 parliamentary elections as unfairly influenced by the central Russian government and military.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5028949 Chechnya Holds Parliamentary Vote], Morning Edition, NPR, November 28, 2005.</ref>

The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre reports that after hundreds of thousands fled their homes following inter-ethnic and [[Separatism|separatist]] conflicts in Chechnya in 1994 and 1999, more than 150,000 people still remain displaced in Russia today.<ref>[http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpCountrySummaries)/441ED4F5458A7C1DC125733600369629?OpenDocument&count=10000 Government efforts help only some IDPs rebuild their lives], IDMC, August 13, 2007</ref>

On September&nbsp;1, 1997, Criminal Code reportedly being implemented in the Chechen Republic-Ichkeriya, Article 148 punishes "anal sexual intercourse between a man and a woman or a man and a man". For first- and second-time offenders, the punishment is caning. A third conviction leads to the death penalty, which can be carried out in a number of ways including stoning or beheading.<ref>[[Amnesty International]]:[http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR040091997?open&of=ENG-AZE  Amnesty International working against laws punishing sexual relations between men], 1 September 1997.</ref>

On February 1, 2009, the ''[[New York Times]]'' released extensive evidence to support allegations of consistent torture and executions under the Kadyrov government. The accusations were sparked by the assassination in Austria of a former Chechen rebel who had gained access to Kadyrov's inner circle, 27-year-old Umar Israilov.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chivers|first=C.&nbsp;J.|title=Slain Exile Detailed Cruelty of the Ruler of Chechnya|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/world/europe/01torture.html?_r=0&pagewanted=all|newspaper=New York Times|date=31 January 2009}}</ref>

On July 1, 2009, [[Amnesty International]] released a detailed report covering the human rights violations committed by the [[Russian Federation]] against Chechen citizens. Among the most prominent features was that those abused had no method of redress against assaults, ranging from kidnapping to torture, while those responsible were never held accountable. This led to the conclusion that Chechnya was being ruled without law, being run into further devastating destabilization.<ref>[[Amnesty International]]:[http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR46/012/2009/en/66cda198-85c0-452c-a2c5-98cac593a990/eur460122009en.pdfl Russian Federation Rule Without Law: Human Rights violations in the North Caucasus], July 1, 2009.</ref>

On March 10, 2011, [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that since Chechenization, the government has pushed for enforced Islamic dress code and other traditions which violently repress women.<ref>[[Human Rights Watch]]:[http://www.hrw.org/print/reports/2011/03/10/you-dress-according-their-rules “You Dress According to Their Rules” Enforcement of an Islamic Dress Code for Women in Chechnya], March 10, 2011</ref> The president [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] is quoted as saying "I have the right to criticize my wife. She doesn’t. With us [in Chechen society], a wife is a [[housewife]]. A woman should know her place. A woman should give her love to us [men]... She would be [man’s] property. And the man is the owner. Here, if a woman does not behave properly, her husband, father, and brother are responsible. According to our tradition, if a woman fools around, her family members kill her... That’s how it happens, a brother kills his sister or a husband kills his wife... As a president, I cannot allow for them to kill. So, let women not wear shorts...".<ref>Interview with Ramzan Kadyrov, Komsomolskaya Pravda, September 24, 2008, http://www.kp.ru/daily/24169/380743/ (accessed December 7, 2010)</ref> He has also openly defended honour killings on several occasions.<ref>[http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?story_id=28409&action_id=2 Chechen President Kadyrov Defends Honor Killings] [[St. Petersburg Times]] March&nbsp;3, 2009</ref> All this is occurring despite being illegal under Russian law and international laws.

==Economy==
During the war, the Chechen economy fell apart. [[Gross domestic product]], if reliably calculable, would be only a fraction of the prewar level. Problems with the Chechen economy had an effect on the federal Russian economy—a number of financial crimes during the 1990s were committed using Chechen financial organizations. Chechnya has the highest ratio within Russian Federation of financial operations made in [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] to operations in [[Russian ruble]]s. There are many [[counterfeit]] U.S. dollars printed there. In 1994, the separatists planned to introduce a new currency, but that did not happen due to Russian troops re-taking Chechnya in the [[Second Chechen War]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  As an effect of the war, approximately 80% of the economic potential of Chechnya was destroyed. Much of the money spent by the Russian federal government to rebuild Chechnya has been wasted.  According to the Russian government, over $2 billion was spent on the reconstruction of the Chechen economy since 2000. However, according to the Russian central economic control agency (''Schyotnaya Palata''), not more than $350 million was spent as intended.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} The economic situation in Chechnya has improved considerably since 2000. According to the ''New York Times'', major efforts to rebuild Grozny have been made, and improvements in the political situation have led some officials to consider setting up a tourism industry, though there are claims that construction workers are being irregularly paid and that poor people have been displaced.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/world/europe/30grozny.html | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | title=Chechnya's Capital Rises From the Ashes, Atop Hidden Horrors | first=Andrew E. | last=Kramer | date=April 30, 2008 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}</ref>  See the main article [[Grozny#Today|Grozny]].

===Tourism===
After the war, and until about 2007 tourism in the country was in decline, but today there is some work for its resuscitation. At present, people from North Ossetia, Ingushetia and Dagestan, often visit Chechnya for trade reasons, and rare groups from central Russia appear in the republic for the purposes of [[extreme tourism]].
