'''Delicate Arch''' is a {{convert|65|ft|adj=on}} tall freestanding [[natural arch]] located in [[Arches National Park]] near [[Moab, Utah]], [[United States]].<ref>[http://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/parks/arch/arch_gre_rpt_view.pdf Arches National Park, Geologic Resource Evaluation Report] p9 National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior</ref> It is the most widely-recognized [[landmark]] in Arches National Park and is depicted on [[Vehicle registration plates of Utah|Utah license plates]] and on a [[postage stamp]] commemorating Utah's [[centennial]] anniversary of [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|statehood]] in 1996. The [[2002 Winter Olympics torch relay|Olympic torch relay]] for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] passed through the arch.<ref name=SI>{{cite web|title=Olympic torch makes way into Utah for first time|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2002/news/2002/02/04/torch_utah_ap/|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=4 February 2002}}</ref>

==History==
Because of its distinctive shape, the arch was known as "the Chaps" and "the Schoolmarm's Bloomers" by local cowboys.<ref>{{cite book|last=Green|first=Stewart M.|title=Best Easy Day Hikes Moab|year=2011|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=0762767839|page=84|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3Dfw39LEixkC&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=delicate+arch+%22the+chaps%22&source=bl&ots=XQxLDjz_Zo&sig=hBC3Bfy7617HeyBvPhHzs1LoQbM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DPOCUsS5LZHdsASdj4DwAw&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=delicate%20arch%20%22the%20chaps%22&f=false}}</ref>  It was given its current name by Frank Beckwith, leader of the Arches National Monument Scientific Expedition, who explored the area in the winter of 1933&ndash;1934. (The story that the names of Delicate Arch and [[Landscape Arch]] were inadvertently exchanged due to a signage mixup by the [[National Park Service]] is false.<ref name="Hoffman">John F. Hoffman, ''Arches National Park''</ref>)

This arch played no part in the original designation of the area as a [[U.S. National Monument]] in 1929, and was not included within the original boundaries; it was added when the monument was enlarged in 1938.

In the 1950s, the National Park Service investigated the possibility of applying a clear [[plastic]] coating to the arch to protect it from further [[erosion]] and eventual destruction. The idea was ultimately abandoned as impractical and contrary to NPS principles.<ref name="Hoffman"/>

==Geology==
Delicate Arch is formed of [[Entrada Sandstone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://3dparks.wr.usgs.gov/arches/html/3d001.html|title=USGS - Delicate Arch|accessdate=3 March 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080212142607/http://3dparks.wr.usgs.gov/arches/html/3d001.html|archivedate=12 February 2008}}</ref> The original sandstone fin was gradually worn away by weathering and erosion, leaving the arch. Other arches in the park were formed the same way but due to placement and less dramatic shape are not as famous.

==Wildlife==
During the summer, [[White-throated Swift]]s (''Aeronautes saxatalis'') nest in the top of the arch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viamagazine.com/weekenders/rock_art07.asp|title=Arches National Park|accessdate=3 March 2008}}</ref>

==Controversy==
Nature photographer Michael Fatali started a fire under the arch in September 2000 to demonstrate nighttime photography techniques to a group of amateur photographers. The fire discolored portions of the sandstone near the arch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://photo.net/nature-photography-forum/001oMT|title=Fatali Pleads Guilty to All Charges|author=Bert Nelson|accessdate=27 July 2008}}</ref> Fatali was placed on probation and fined $10,900 in restitution to the [[National Park Service]] for the cost of cleanup efforts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E7DB153DF931A35751C0A9649C8B63|title=National Briefing: Rockies: Utah: Sentence For Burning Arch|accessdate=27 July 2008|work=The New York Times|date=2 February 2002}}</ref>

In May 2006, climber [[Dean Potter]] made the first recorded [[free solo]] &ndash; no ropes or protection &ndash; ascent of this formation. Climbing Delicate Arch was not explicitly forbidden under the rules in force at the time. It was understood, however, that the named-arch formations should not be climbed. The Park Service has since closed the loophole by disallowing climbs on any named arch within the park year-round. [[Slacklining]] and the placement of new fixed anchors on new climbs is also prohibited. Controversy erupted when photographs taken after Potter's climb appeared to show damage caused by a climbing technique called [[top roping]]. Potter has stated on several occasions that he never top-roped the Arch and no photos exist of Potter using a top rope setup on the Arch. It is possible that a previous climber had top-roped the Arch leaving the rope scars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://outside.away.com/outside/features/200606/dean-potter-delicate-arch-climb-1.html|title=How Delicate Was Dean?|author=Neville, Tim|accessdate=25 April 2007}}</ref>
