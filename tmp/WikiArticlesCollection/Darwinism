'''Darwinism''' originally included the broad concepts of [[transmutation of species]] or of [[evolution]] which gained general scientific acceptance when [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', including concepts which predated Darwin's theories, but subsequently referred to specific concepts of [[natural selection]], the [[Weismann barrier]] or in [[genetics]] the [[central dogma of molecular biology]].<ref name=antidarwinian>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/anti-darwin.html |title=How to be Anti-Darwinian |author=John Wilkins |year= 1998 |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |accessdate=19 June 2008}}</ref> Though it usually refers strictly to biological evolution, the term has been misused by [[creationism|creationists]] to refer to the [[abiogenesis|origin of life]] and has even been applied to concepts of [[Physical cosmology|cosmic evolution]] which have no connection to Darwin's work. It is therefore considered the belief and acceptance of Darwin's, and his predecessors, work in place of other theories including divine design and extraterrestrial origins.<ref name=EOflunks>{{cite web |url=http://www.expelledexposed.com/index.php/contest/on-what-evolution-explains |title=Expelled Exposed: Why Expelled Flunks » …on what evolution explains |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |accessdate=22 December 2008}}</ref><ref name=GalacticDarwinism>{{cite web |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=2169&theme=Printer |title=Galactic Darwinism :: Astrobiology Magazine - earth science - evolution distribution Origin of life universe - life beyond :: Astrobiology is study of earth science evolution distribution Origin of life in universe terrestrial |author=based on a European Southern Observatory release |authorlink=European Southern Observatory |date=9 December 2006 |accessdate=22 December 2008}}</ref>

The meaning of "Darwinism" has changed over time, and varies depending on its context.<ref name=whatis>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/darwinism.html |title=What is Darwinism? |author=Joel Hanes |date= |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |accessdate=19 June 2008}}</ref> In the United States, the term "Darwinism" is often used by [[creationism|creationists]] as a [[pejorative]] term in reference to beliefs such as [[Metaphysical naturalism|atheistic naturalism]], but in the United Kingdom the term has no negative connotations, being freely used as a shorthand for the body of theory dealing with evolution, and in particular, evolution by natural selection.<ref name="Scott Branch 09">{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott|coauthors=[[Glenn Branch|Branch, Glenn]]|date=16 January 2009|title=Don’t Call it "Darwinism" |journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach|publisher=Springer|location=New York|volume=2|issue=1|issn=1936-6434|doi=10.1007/s12052-008-0111-2|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n47h34357743w4p0/?p=e3b030036a4d442a8ce393291fe0688f&pi=9|accessdate=17 November 2009|pages=90|ref=harv}}</ref>

The term was coined by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in April 1860,<ref name=westminster>{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&itemID=A32&pageseq=29 |title=ART.

Many of the proponents of Darwinism at that time, including Huxley, had reservations about the significance of [[natural selection]], and Darwin himself gave credence to what was later called [[Lamarckism]]. The strict [[neo-Darwinism]] of [[August Weismann]] gained few supporters in the late 19th century. During this period, which has been called "[[the eclipse of Darwinism]]", scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary mechanisms which eventually proved untenable. The development of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] from the 1930s to the 1950s, incorporating natural selection with [[population genetics]] and [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] [[genetics]], revived Darwinism in an updated form.<ref name=b222>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=179, 222–225, 338–3399, 347}}</ref>

While the term has remained in use amongst scientific authors when referring to modern evolutionary theory, it has increasingly been argued that it is an inappropriate term for modern evolutionary theory.<ref name="Scott Branch 09" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/lets-get-rid-of-darwinism/ |title=Let’s Get Rid of Darwinism |author=Olivia Judson |date=15 July 2008<!--, 6:48 pm -->|work=New York Times }}</ref>  For example, Darwin was unfamiliar with the work of [[Gregor Mendel]],<ref>{{cite journal | last = Sclater | first = Andrew | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The extent of Charles Darwin’s knowledge of Mendel | journal=Journal of Biosciences | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–193 | publisher=Springer India / Indian Academy of Sciences | location = Bangalore, India | date = June 2006 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/w112307246x77t37/ | doi = 10.1007/BF02703910 | accessdate = 3 January 2009 | pmid = 16809850 | ref = harv }}</ref> and as a result had only a vague and inaccurate understanding of [[heredity]]. He naturally had no inkling of yet more recent developments and, like Mendel himself,  knew nothing of [[genetic drift]] for example.<ref name=GeneticDrift>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/genetic-drift.html |title=Random Genetic Drift |author=Laurence Moran |year=1993 |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |accessdate=27 June 2008}}</ref>

==Conceptions of Darwinism==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
[[Image:Editorial cartoon depicting Charles Darwin as an ape (1871).jpg|thumb|As "Darwinism" became widely accepted in the 1870s, caricatures of [[Charles Darwin]] with an ape or [[monkey]] body symbolised [[evolution]].<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=376–379}}</ref>]]

While the term ''Darwinism'' had been used previously to refer to the work of [[Erasmus Darwin]] in the late 18th century, the term as understood today was introduced when [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was reviewed by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in the April 1860 issue of the ''[[Westminster Review]]''.<ref name="urlThe Huxley File § 4 Darwins Bulldog">{{cite web |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/guide4.html |title=The Huxley File § 4 Darwin's Bulldog |work=|accessdate=29 June 2008}}</ref> Having hailed the book as, "a veritable [[Joseph Whitworth#Whitworth rifle|Whitworth gun]] in the armoury of liberalism" promoting [[naturalism (philosophy)|scientific naturalism]] over [[theology]], and praising the usefulness of Darwin's ideas while expressing professional reservations about Darwin's [[gradualism]] and doubting if it could be proved that [[natural selection]] could form new species,<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=105–106}}</ref> Huxley compared Darwin's achievement to that of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] in explaining planetary motion:
{{quotation|What if the orbit of Darwinism should be a little too circular? What if species should offer residual phenomena, here and there, not explicable by natural selection? Twenty years hence naturalists may be in a position to say whether this is, or is not, the case; but in either event they will owe the author of "The Origin of Species" an immense debt of gratitude...... And viewed as a whole, we do not believe that, since the publication of Von Baer's "Researches on Development," thirty years ago, any work has appeared calculated to exert so large an influence, not only on the future of Biology, but in extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated.<ref name=westminster/> }}

Another important evolutionary theorist of the same period was [[Peter Kropotkin]] who, in his book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', advocated a conception of Darwinism counter to that of Huxley. His conception was centred around what he saw as the widespread use of co-operation as a survival mechanism in human societies and animals. He used [[Biology|biological]] and [[Sociology|sociological]] arguments in an attempt to show that the main factor in facilitating evolution is cooperation between individuals in free-associated societies and groups. This was in order to counteract the conception of fierce [[Competition (biology)|competition]] as the core of evolution, which provided a [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalisation]] for the dominant political, economic and social theories of the time; and the prevalent interpretations of Darwinism, such as those by Huxley, who is targeted as an opponent by Kropotkin. Kropotkin's conception of Darwinism could be summed up by the following quote:

{{quotation|In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense{{spaced ndash}}not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.|Peter Kropotkin|Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1902), Conclusion.}}

==19th-century usage==
"Darwinism" soon came to stand for an entire range of evolutionary (and often revolutionary) philosophies about both biology and society. One of the more prominent approaches, summed in the 1864 phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]" by the philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]], later became emblematic of Darwinism even though Spencer's own understanding of evolution (as expressed in 1857) was more similar to that of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] than to that of Darwin, and predated the [[publication of Darwin's theory]] in 1859. What is now called "[[Social Darwinism]]" was, in its day, synonymous with "Darwinism" — the application of Darwinian principles of "struggle" to society, usually in support of anti-[[philanthropy|philanthropic]] political agenda. Another interpretation, one notably favoured by Darwin's half-cousin [[Francis Galton]], was that "Darwinism" implied that because natural selection was apparently no longer working on "civilized" people, it was possible for "inferior" strains of people (who would normally be filtered out of the gene pool) to overwhelm the "superior" strains, and voluntary corrective measures would be desirable — the foundation of [[eugenics]].

In Darwin's day there was no rigid definition of the term "Darwinism," and it was used by opponents and proponents of Darwin's biological theory alike to mean whatever they wanted it to in a larger context. The ideas had international influence, and [[Ernst Haeckel]] developed what was known as {{anchor|Darwinismus}}'''''Darwinismus''''' in Germany, although, like Spencer's "evolution", Haeckel's "Darwinism" had only a rough resemblance to the theory of Charles Darwin, and was not centred on natural selection at all.  In 1886 [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] went on a lecture tour across the United States, starting in New York and going via Boston, Washington, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska to California, lecturing on what he called "Darwinism" without any problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/darwin/transcript.shtml|title=Evolution and Wonder - Understanding Charles Darwin - Speaking of Faith from American Public Media|accessdate=27 July 2007}}</ref>

==Other uses==
The term ''Darwinism'' is often used in the United States by promoters of [[creationism]], notably by leading members of the [[intelligent design movement]], as an epithet to attack [[evolution]] as though it were an ideology (an "ism") of [[philosophical naturalism]], or [[atheism]].<ref name=genie>{{Cite book | last = Scott | first =Eugenie C. | author-link =Eugenie Scott | year = 2008 | contribution =Creation Science Lite: "Intelligent Design" as the New Anti-Evolutionism | contribution-url =http://biology.ucf.edu/~clp/Courses/seminar/papers/07-Scott-scientists_confront-cs_lite.pdf | editor-last = Godfrey | editor-first =Laurie R. | editor2-last = Petto | editor2-first =Andrew J. | title =Scientists Confront Creationism: Intelligent Design and Beyond | publication-place =New York | publisher=W.

Johnson]] makes this accusation of atheism with reference to [[Charles Hodge#Darwinism|Charles Hodge]]'s book ''What Is Darwinism?''.<ref>{{cite web | last = Johnson | first = Phillip E.| title = What is Darwinism? | url= http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/wid.htm | accessdate = 4 January 2007 }}</ref> However, unlike Johnson, Hodge confined the term to exclude those like [[Asa Gray]] who combined Christian faith with support for Darwin's [[natural selection]] theory, before answering the question posed in the book's title by concluding: "It is Atheism."<ref>{{cite web | last = Matthew | first = Ropp | title = Charles Hodge and His Objection to Darwinism | url=http://www.theropps.com/papers/Winter1997/CharlesHodge.htm | accessdate = 4 January 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Hodge | first = Charles | title = What is Darwinism? | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19192/19192-8.txt | accessdate = 4 January 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Hodge | first = Charles | year = 1874 | title = What is Darwinism? | publisher=Scribner, Armstrong, and Company | oclc = 11489956 }}</ref> Creationists use the term ''Darwinism'', often pejoratively, to imply that the theory has been held as true only by Darwin and a core group of his followers, whom they cast as [[dogma]]tic and inflexible in their [[belief]].<ref name=morrissullivan>{{cite web | url = http://www.impactpress.com/articles/spring05/sullivanspring05.html | title = From the Beagle to the School Board: God Goes Back to School | last = Sullivan | first = M | publisher=[[Impact Press]] | year = 2005 | accessdate = 18 September 2008 }}</ref> In the 2008 movie ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'' which promotes intelligent design, [[Ben Stein]] refers to scientists as Darwinists. Reviewing the film for ''[[Scientific American]]'', [[John Rennie (editor)|John Rennie]] says "The term is a curious throwback, because in modern biology almost no one relies solely on Darwin's original ideas... Yet the choice of terminology isn't random: Ben Stein wants you to stop thinking of evolution as an actual science supported by verifiable facts and logical arguments and to start thinking of it as a dogmatic, atheistic ideology akin to Marxism." <ref>[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=ben-steins-expelled-review-john-rennie&print=true Ben Stein's Expelled: No Integrity Displayed], ''[[Scientific American]]''.</ref>

However, ''Darwinism'' is also used neutrally within the scientific community to distinguish [[Modern evolutionary synthesis|modern evolutionary theories]], sometimes called "[[Neo-Darwinism]]", from those first proposed by Darwin.  ''Darwinism'' also is used neutrally by historians to differentiate his theory from other evolutionary theories current around the same period. For example, ''Darwinism'' may be used to refer to Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection, in comparison to more recent mechanisms such as [[genetic drift]] and [[gene flow]]. It may also refer specifically to the role of Charles Darwin as opposed to others in the [[history of evolutionary thought]] — particularly contrasting Darwin's results with those of earlier theories such as [[Lamarckism]] or later ones such as the [[modern synthesis]].

In political discussions in the United States, the term is mostly used by its enemies.  "It's a rhetorical device to make evolution seem like a kind of faith, like 'Maoism,'" says Harvard biologist [[E.O. Wilson]]. He adds, "Scientists don't call it 'Darwinism'."<ref>''Newsweek'' Nov 28, 2005</ref>  In the United Kingdom the term often retains its positive sense as a reference to natural selection, and for example [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote in his collection of essays ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'', published in 2003,  that as a scientist he is a Darwinist.<ref>Sheahen, Laura. [http://www.beliefnet.com/story/136/story_13688_1.html Religion: For Dummies]. BeliefNet.com, interview about 2003 book.</ref>

In his 1995 book ''[[Darwinian Fairytales]]'', Australian philosopher [[David Stove]]<ref>Stove, David (1995). ''Darwinian Fairytales: Selfish Gees, Errors of Heredity and Other Fables of Evolution. Avebury, ISBN 1-85972-306-3</ref> used the term "Darwinism" in a different sense than the above examples. Describing himself as non-religious and as accepting the concept of [[natural selection]] as a well-established fact, Stove nonetheless attacked what he described as flawed concepts proposed by some "Ultra-Darwinists". Stove alleged that by using weak or false ''[[ad hoc]]'' reasoning, these Ultra-Darwinists used evolutionary concepts to offer explanations that were not valid (e.g., Stove suggested that [[sociobiology|sociobiological]] explanation of [[altruism]] as an evolutionary feature was presented in such a way that the argument was effectively immune to any criticism.) Philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] wrote a rejoinder to Stove,<ref>Blackburn, Simon. "[http://www.jodkowski.pl/we/SBlackburn.html I Rather Think I am a Darwinian]" ''Philosophy'', Vol. 71, 1996, pp. 605 - 616</ref> though a subsequent essay by Stove's protegee [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]]'s<ref>Franklin, James. "[http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/stovesantidarwinism.pdf Stove's Anti-Darwinism]" ''Philosophy'', Vol. 72, No. 279 (Jan., 1997), pp. 133-136</ref> suggested that Blackburn's response actually "confirms Stove's central thesis that Darwinism can 'explain' anything."
