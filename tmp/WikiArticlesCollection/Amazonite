'''Amazonite''' (sometimes called "Amazon stone") is a green variety of [[microcline]]  [[feldspar]].<ref>[http://www.mindat.org/min-184.html Amazonite, Mindat.org]</ref><ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/18797/amazonstone</ref><ref>http://webmineral.com/data/Microcline.shtml</ref>

The name is taken from  that of the [[Amazon River]], from which certain green stones were formerly obtained, but it is doubtful whether green [[feldspar]] occurs in the Amazon area.

Amazonite is a mineral of limited occurrence. Formerly it was obtained almost exclusively from the area of [[Miass]] in the [[Ilmen mountains]], 50 miles southwest of [[Chelyabinsk]], [[Russia]], where it occurs in granitic rocks. More recently, high-quality crystals have been obtained from [[Pikes Peak|Pike's Peak]], [[Colorado]], where it is found associated with smoky [[quartz]], [[orthoclase]], and [[albite]] in a coarse [[granite]] or [[pegmatite]]. Crystals of amazonite can also be found in Crystal Park, El Paso County, [[Colorado]]. Other localities in the [[United States]] which yield amazonite include the  Morefield Mine in [[Amelia, Virginia]].<ref>[http://www.dmme.virginia.gov/DMR3/dmrpdfs/vamin/VAMIN_VOL38_NO02.pdf D. Allen Penick, Jr. and Palmer C. Sweet, ''Mineral Collecting Sites in Virginia,'' Virginia Minerals, May 1992, V. 38, No. 2, p. 10 - 11]</ref> It is also found in [[pegmatite]] in [[Madagascar]] and in [[Brazil]].

Because of its bright [[green]] color when polished, amazonite is sometimes cut and used as a [[gemstone]], although it is easily fractured.

For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Naturally, many people assumed the color was due to copper because [[copper]] compounds often have blue and green colors. More recent studies suggest that the blue-green color results from small quantities of [[lead]] and water in the feldspar.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hoffmeister and Rossman | title=A spectroscopic study of irradiation coloring of amazonite; structurally hydrous, Pb-bearing feldspar | journal=American Mineralogist | year=1985 | volume=70 | pages=794â€“804}}</ref>
