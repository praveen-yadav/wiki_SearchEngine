A '''cabal''' is a group of people united in some close design together, usually to promote their private views or interests in a [[Church body|church]], [[state (polity)|state]], or other community, often by [[Wiktionary:intrigue|intrigue]].  Cabals are sometimes [[secret societies]] composed of a few designing persons, and at other times are manifestations of [[emergence|emergent behavior]] in [[society]] or [[governance]] on the part of a community of persons who have well established public affiliation or kinship. The term can also be used to refer to the designs of such persons or to the practical consequences of their emergent behavior, and also holds a general meaning of intrigue and [[Conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]]. The use of this term usually carries strong connotations of shadowy corners, back rooms and insidious influence. The term is frequently used in conspiracy theories; some [[Masonic conspiracy theories]] describe [[Freemasonry]] as an [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] secret cabal.

==Origins of the word==
The term ''cabal'' derives from [[Kabbalah|Cabala]] (a word that has numerous spelling variations), the [[Jewish mysticism|Jewish mystical]] interpretation of the Hebrew scripture. In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] it means "reception" or "tradition", denoting the ''sod'' (secret) level of [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|Jewish exegesis]]. In European culture ([[Christian Cabala]], [[Hermetic Qabalah]]) it became associated with [[occult]] doctrine or a [[secret]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Association with Charles II==
{{main|Cabal Ministry}}
The term took on its present meaning from a group of ministers of King [[Charles II of England]] ([[Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford of Chudleigh|Sir Thomas Clifford]], [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]], the [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Ashley]], and [[John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale|Lord Lauderdale]]), whose initial letters coincidentally spelled CABAL, and who were the signatories of the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]] that allied [[England]] to [[France]] in a prospective war against the [[Netherlands]].<ref>Durant, Will and Ariel.  ''The Age of Louis XIV.'' (page 277) New York: Simon And Schuster, 1963.</ref>  However, the [[Cabal Ministry]] they formed can hardly be seen as such; the Scot Lauderdale was not much involved in [[English governance]] at all, while the Catholic ministers of the Cabal (Clifford and Arlington) were never much in sympathy with the Protestants (Buckingham and Ashley).  Nor did Buckingham and Ashley get on very well with each other.  Thus the "[[Cabal Ministry]]" never really unified in its members' aims and sympathies, and fell apart by 1672; Lord Ashley, who became Earl of Shaftesbury, later became one of Charles II's fiercest opponents. The theory that the word originated as an [[acronym]] from the names of the group of ministers is a [[folk etymology]], although the coincidence was noted at the time and could possibly have popularized its use.  The group, who came to prominence after the fall of Charles' first [[Chief Ministers of England#Charles_II|Chief Minister]], [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]], in 1667, was rather called the Cabal because of its secretiveness and lack of responsibility to the "Country party" then run out of power.

During the early years of the [[Usenet]] internet messaging system, the term "[[backbone cabal]]" was used as a semi-ironic description of the efforts of people to maintain some order over the structure of the community, and led to a popular phrase in the network, "There Is No Cabal" (abbreviated to "TINC").
