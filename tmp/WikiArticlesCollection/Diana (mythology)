{{Ancient Roman religion}}
In [[Roman mythology]], '''Diana''' (lt. "heavenly" or "divine") was the goddess of the [[hunting|hunt]], the [[moon]] and [[birthing]], being associated with wild animals and woodland, and having the power to talk to and control animals. She was equated with the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] [[Artemis]],<ref name=Lar>''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.</ref> though she had an independent origin in Italy. Diana was worshipped in [[ancient Roman religion]] and is revered in [[Roman polytheistic reconstructionism|Roman Neopaganism]] and [[Stregheria]]. [[Dianic Wicca]], a largely feminist form of the practice, is named for her. Diana was known to be the virgin goddess of childbirth and women. She was one of the three maiden goddesses, Diana, [[Minerva (mythology)|Minerva]] and [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], who swore never to marry.

[[Oak]] groves were especially sacred to her. According to mythology, Diana was born with her twin brother [[Apollo]] on the island of [[Delos]], daughter of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Leto|Latona]]. Diana made up a triad with two other Roman deities: [[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]] the water nymph, her servant and assistant midwife; and [[Virbius]], the woodland god.

==Etymology==
Diana (pronounced with long 'ī' and 'ā') is an adjectival form developed from an ancient *divios, corresponding to later 'divus', 'dius', as in [[Dius Fidius]], [[Dea Dia]] and in the neuter form ''dium'' meaning the sky.<ref>G.Dumézil ''La religion Romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974, part 3, chap. 1.</ref>
It is rooted in Indoeuropean *d(e)y(e)w, meaning bright sky or daylight, from which also derived the name of [[Vedic]] god [[Dyaus]] and the Latin [[deus]], (god), ''dies'', (day, daylight), and " diurnal", (daytime).

On the [[Linear B|Tablets of Pylos]] a theonym διϝια is supposed as referring to a deity precursor of Artemis. Modern scholars mostly accept the identification.<ref>H. F. Pairault below cites three. Contrary G. Rousseau.</ref>{{qn|date=April 2013}}

The ancient Latin writers [[Varro]] and [[Cicero]] considered the etymology of Dīāna as allied to that of ''dies'' and connected to the shine of the Moon.

==Mythology==
The persona of Diana is complex and contains a number of archaic features. According to [[Georges Dumézil]]<ref>G. Dumezil ''La religion Romaine archaique'' Paris 1974, part 3, chap.1.</ref> it falls into a particular subset of celestial gods, referred to in histories of religion as ''frame gods''. Such gods, while keeping the original features of celestial divinities, i.e. transcendent heavenly power and abstention from direct rule in worldly matters, did not share the fate of other celestial gods in Indoeuropean religions - that of becoming ''dei otiosi'' or gods without practical purpose,<ref>Mircea Eliade  ''Traite' d'histoire des religions'' Paris, 1954.</ref> since they did retain a particular sort of influence over the world and mankind.

The celestial character of Diana is reflected in her connection with light, inaccessibility, virginity, and her preference for dwelling on high mountains and in sacred woods.
Diana therefore reflects the heavenly world (''diuum'' means sky or open air) in its sovereignty, supremacy, impassibility, and indifference towards such secular matters as the fates of mortals and states. At the same time, however, she is seen as active in ensuring the succession of kings and in the preservation of humankind through the protection of childbirth.

These functions are apparent in the traditional institutions and cults related to the goddess. 
1) The institution of the [[rex Nemorensis]], Diana's ''sacerdos'' (priest) in the Arician wood, who held the position till someone else challenged and killed him in a duel, after breaking a branch from a certain tree of the wood. This ever open succession reveals the character and mission of the goddess as a guarantor of kingly status through successive generations.<ref name="OvidFasti">Ovid ''Fasti'' III, 262-271.</ref> Her function as bestower of authority to rule is also attested in the story related by Livy in which a Sabine man who sacrifices a [[:wikt:heifer|heifer]] to Diana wins for his country the seat of the Roman empire.<ref>Titus Livius ''Ab urbe condita'' 1:31-1:60.</ref>
2) Diana was also worshipped by women who wanted to be pregnant or who, once pregnant, prayed for an easy delivery. This form of worship is attested in archeological finds of votive statuettes in her sanctuary in the [[nemus Aricinum]] as well as in ancient sources, e.g. Ovid.<ref name="OvidFasti" />

According to Dumezil the forerunner of all ''frame gods'' is an Indian epic hero who was the image ([[avatar]]) of the Vedic god Dyaus. Having renounced the world, in his roles of father and king, he attained the status of an immortal being while retaining the duty of ensuring that his dynasty is preserved and that there is always a new king for each generation. 
The Scandinavian god [[Heimdallr]] performs an analogous function: he is born first and will die last. He too gives origin to kingship and the first king, bestowing on him regal prerogatives.
Diana, although a female deity, has exactly the same functions, preserving mankind through childbirth and royal succession.

F. H. Pairault in her essay on Diana qualifies Dumézil's theory as "''impossible to verify''".

Dumezil's interpretation appears deliberately to ignore that of [[James G. Frazer]], who links Diana with the male god [[Janus]] as a divine couple. This looks odd as Dumézil's definition of the concept of ''frame god'' would fit well the figure of  Janus.<ref>J. Frazer ''The golden bough'' 1922, chaps. 1, 12, 16.</ref> Frazer identifies the two with the supreme heavenly couple Jupiter-Juno and additionally ties in these figures to the overarching Indoeuropean religious complex. This regality is also linked to the cult of trees, particularly [[Querquetulanae|oaks]]. 
In this interpretative schema, the institution of the Rex Nemorensis and related ritual should be seen as related to the theme of the dying god and the [[King of the May|kings of May]].<ref>J.G. Frazer ''Dying gods'',  1912;  Geza Roheim ''Animism, magic and the divine king''  Routledge, London, 1972, part 3, (in particular chapter "The king of May").</ref>

==Physical description==
[[File:Bronze satuette Diana CdM Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Gallo-Roman religion|Gallo-Roman]] bronze statuette of Diana (latter 1st century)]]
As a goddess of hunting, Diana often wears a short tunic and hunting boots. She is often portrayed holding a bow, and carrying a quiver on her shoulder, accompanied by a deer or hunting dogs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Artemis|url=http://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html|accessdate=2012-11-11}}</ref> Like Venus, she was portrayed as beautiful and youthful. The crescent moon, sometimes worn as a diadem, is a major attribute of the goddess.

==Worship==
Diana was initially just the hunting goddess,{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} associated with wild animals and woodlands. She also later became a [[moon goddess]], supplanting [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] goddess [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} She also became the goddess of childbirth and ruled over the countryside. Catullus wrote a poem to Diana in which she has more than one alias: Latonia, Lucina, Iuno, Trivia, Luna.<ref>http://www.scribd.com/doc/35900939/Latin-Oration</ref>

In Rome the cult of Diana should have been almost as old as the city itself as Varro mentions her in the list of deities to whom king [[Titus Tatius]] vowed a shrine. It is noteworthy that the list includes Luna and Diana Lucina as separate entities.
Another testimony to the high antiquity of her cult is to be found in the ''lex regia'' of king [[Tullus Hostilius]] that condemns those guilty of incest to the ''sacratio'' to the goddess.

Diana was worshipped at a festival on August 13,<ref>The date coincides with the founding dates celebrated at Aricium. Arthur E. Gordon, "On the Origin of Diana", ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' '''63''' (1932, pp. 177-192) p 178.</ref> when King [[Servius Tullius]], himself born a slave, dedicated [[Temple of Diana (Rome)|her temple]] on the [[Aventine Hill]] in the mid-6th century BC. Being placed on the Aventine, and thus outside the ''[[pomerium]]'', meant that Diana's cult essentially remained a ''foreign'' one, like that of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]; she was never officially ''transferred'' to Rome as [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] was after the sack of [[Veii]].  It seems that her cult originated in [[Ariccia|Aricia]],<ref>Her cult at Aricia was first attested in Latin literature by [[Cato the Elder]], in a surviving quote by the late grammarian [[Priscian]]. Supposed Greek origins for the Aricia cult are strictly a literary ''[[topos]]''. (Gordon 1932:178 note, and p. 181).</ref> where her priest, the [[Rex Nemorensis]] remained. There the simple open-air fane was held in common by the Latin tribes,<ref>''commune Latinorum Dianae templum'' in [[Varro]], ''Lingua Latina'' V.43; the cult there was of ''antiqua religione'' in [[Pliny's Natural History]], xliv. 91, 242 and [[Ovid's Fasti]] III 327-331.</ref> which Rome aspired to weld into a league and direct. Diana of the wood was soon thoroughly Hellenized,<ref>The ''[[Potnia Theron]]'' aspect of Hellenic Artemis is represented in [[Capua]] and [[Segni|Signia]], Greek cities of [[Magna Graecia]], in the 5th century BC.</ref> "a process which culminated with the appearance of Diana beside Apollo in the first ''[[lectisternium]]'' at Rome".<ref>Gordon 1932:179.</ref> Diana was regarded with great reverence and was a patroness of lower-class citizens, called plebeians,<ref>covenofthegoddess. "Goddess Diana." Coven of the Goddess. [http://www.covenofthegoddess.com/goddessdiana.htm] (accessed November 27, 2012).</ref> and [[slavery|slaves]]; slaves could receive asylum in her temples. This fact is of difficult interpretation. [[Georg Wissowa]] proposed the explanation that it might be because the first slaves of the Romans must have been Latins of the neighbouring tribes.<ref>as quoted by Dumézil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974,part 3, chap. 1.</ref> However in Ephesus too there was the same custom of the asylum (ασυλιον).

According to Françoise Hélène Pairault's study,<ref>"Diana Nemorensis, déesse latine, déesse hellénisée" in ''Mélanges d' archéologie et d'histoire'' '''81''' 1969 p. 425-471.</ref> historical and archaeological evidence point to the fact that both Diana of the Aventine and Diana Nemorensis were the product of the direct or indirect influence of the cult of Artemis spread by the Phoceans among  the Greek towns of Campania [[Cumae|Cuma]] and [[Capua]], which in turn passed it over to the Etruscans and the Latins by the 6th and 5th centuries BC.

The origin of the ritual of the rex Nemorensis should have to be traced to the legend of [[Orestes]] and [[Iphigenia]] more than that of Hippolitos. The formation of the Latin League led by Laevius (or Baebius) Egerius<ref>The historicity of this character is questioned by Dumézil as the name ''Egerius'' looks suspect to him.</ref> happened under the influence of an alliance with the tyrant of Cuma Aristodemos<ref>Livy II 14, 5-9; Dionysius Halicarnasseus V 36, 1-4.</ref> and is probably connected to the political events at end of the 6th century narrated by Livy and Dionysius, such as the siege of [[Ariccia|Aricia]] by [[Porsenna]]'s son Arruns. It is remarkable that the composition of this league does not reflect that of the Latin people who took part in the [[Latiar]] or [[Feriae Latinae]] given by Pliny and it  has not as its leader the ''rex Nemorensis'' but a ''dictator Latinus''.<ref>Pliny ''Naturalis Historia'' III 5 68-70.</ref> It should thence be considered a political formation and not a traditional society founded on links of blood.

It looks as if the confrontation happened between two groups of Etruscans who fought for supremacy, those from [[Tarquinia]], [[Vulci]] and [[Caere]] (allied with the Greeks of Capua) and those of [[Clusium]]. This is reflected in the legend of the coming of Orestes to Nemi and of the inhumation of his bones in the Roman  Forum near the temple of Saturn.<ref>Servius ''ad Aeneidem'' II 116; VI 136; [[Hyginus]] ''Fabulae'' 261.</ref> The cult introduced by Orestes at Nemi is apparently that of the [[Artemis Tauropolos]]. The literary amplification<ref>Ovid ''Metamorphoses'' XIV 331-2 ''Scythicae regnum nemorale Dianae''; Lucanus ''Pharsalia'' III 86 "qua sublime nemus Scythicae qua regna Dianae". Silius Italicus ''Punica''  IV 367;  VIII 362; Valerius Flaccus ''Argonauticae''  II 305.</ref> reveals a confused religious background: different Artemis were conflated under the epithet.<ref>Jean Bayet "Les origines de l'Arcadisme romain"  p.135; M. P. Nilson ''Griechische Religionsgeschichte'' Munich 1955 p. 485 ff.</ref> As far as Nemi's Diana is concerned there are two different versions, by [[Strabo]] <ref>Strabo V 249: αφιδρύματα της ταυροπόλου.</ref> and [[Servius Honoratus]]. Strabo's version looks to be the most authoritative as he had access to first hand primary sources on the sanctuaries of Artemis, i.e. the priest of Artemis Artemidoros of Ephesus. The meaning of  ''Tauropolos'' denotes an Asiatic goddess with lunar attributes, lady of the herds.<ref>Suidas s.v. :η Άρτεμις εν Ταύροις της Σκυθίας τιμωμένη; η από μέρους, των ποιμνίων επστάσις. η ότι  η αυτη τη σελήνη εστι καί εποχειται ταύροις.

Diana fig.. 2357.</ref> The only possible ''interpretatio graeca'' of high antiquity concerning  ''Diana Nemorensis'' could have been the one based upon this ancient aspect of  deity of light,  master of wildlife.

This religious complex is in turn supported by the triple statue of Artemis-Hecate. A coin minted by P. Accoleius Lariscolus in 43 BC has been acknowledged as representing  the archaic statue of  Diana Nemorensis.<ref>A. Alföldi"Diana Nemorensis" in  ''American journal of Archaeology''  '''64''' 1960 p. 137-144.</ref> It represents Artemis with the bow at one extremity, Luna-Selene with flowers at the other and a central deity not immediately identifiable, all united by a horizontal bar.

The iconographical analysis allows the dating of this image to the 6th century at which time there are Etruscan models. Two heads found in the sanctuary<ref>Excavation of 1791 by cardinal Despuig  not mentioned in the report: cf. P. Riis who cites E. Lucidi ''Memorie storiche dell'antichissimo municipio ora terra dell'Ariccia e delle sue colonie Genzano e Nemi'' Rome 1796 p. 97 ff. finds at ''Valle Giardino''.</ref> and the Roman theatre at Nemi,<ref>NSA 1931 p. 259-261 platesVI a-b.</ref> which have a hollow on their back,  lend support to this interpretation of an archaic Diana Trivia, in whom three different elements are associated.  The presence of a Hellenised Diana at Nemi should be related to the presence of the cult in Campania, as Diana ''Tifatina'' was appelled ''Trivia'' in an imperial age inscription which mentions a ''flamen Virbialis'' dedicated by ''eques'' C. Octavius Verus.<ref>CIL X 3795.</ref> Cuma too had a cult of a chthonic Hecate and certainly had strict contacts with Latium.<ref>Dionysius Hal. VII 6, 4: the people of Aricia help Aristdemos in bringing home the Etruscan booty.</ref> The theological complex present in Diana looks very elaborated and certainly Hellenic, while an analogous Latin concept of Diana Trivia seems uncertain, as Latin sources reflect a Hellenised character of the goddess.<ref>Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' IV 511; Ennius apud Varro ''De Lingua Latina'' VII 16; Catullus 34, 15.</ref>

Though some Roman patrons ordered marble replicas of the specifically Anatolian  "Diana" of Ephesus, where the [[Temple of Artemis]] stood, Diana was usually depicted for educated Romans in her Greek guise. If she is accompanied by a deer, as in the ''[[Diana of Versailles]]'' (''illustration, above right'') this is because Diana was the patroness of hunting. The deer may also offer a covert reference to the myth of [[Actaeon|Acteon]] (or Actaeon), who saw her bathing naked.  Diana transformed Acteon into a stag and set his own hunting dogs to kill him.

Worship of Diana is mentioned in the [[Holy Bible|Bible]]. In [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Ephesian]] metal smiths who felt threatened by Saint Paul’s preaching of Christianity, jealously rioted in her defense, shouting “''Great is Diana of the Ephesians!''” (Acts 19:28, [[New English Bible]]). After the city secretary (γραμματεύς) quieted the crowd, he said, “''Men of Ephesus, what person is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the keeper (guardian) of the temple of the great Diana and of her image that fell from heaven ?''" (Acts 19:36)

==Sanctuaries==
{{See also|Diana Nemorensis}}
Diana was an ancient goddess common to all Latin tribes. Therefore many sanctuaries were dedicated to her in the lands inhabited by Latins. The first one is supposed to have been near [[Alba Longa]] before the town was destroyed by the Romans.

The [[Ariccia|Aricia]]n wood sanctuary near the [[lake of Nemi]] was Latin confederal as testified by the dedicatory epigraph quoted by Cato.<ref>Cato  ''Origins'' fr. 62:  "Lucum Dianum In nemore Aricino Egerius Baebius (some scholars prefer to read Laevius) Tusculanus dedicavit dictator Latinus. Hi populi communiter: Tusculanus, Aricinus, Laurens, Coranus, Tiburtis, Pometius, Ardeatis, Rutulus."</ref>

She had a shrine in Rome on the Aventine hill, according to tradition dedicated by king [[Servius Tullius]]. Its location is remarkable as the Aventine is situated outside the [[pomerium]], i.e. original territory of the city, in order to comply with the tradition that Diana was a goddess common to all Latins and not exclusively of the Romans.

Other sanctuaries we know about are listed  below:
*Colle di Corne near [[Tusculum]].<ref>Pliny the Elder ''Naturalis Historia XVI, 242.</ref> where she is referred to with the archaic Latin name of ''deva Cornisca'' and where existed a [[collegium]] of worshippers.<ref>CIL, 975; CIL XIV,2633.</ref>
*At Évora, Portugal.<ref>Hifler, Joyce. "The Goddess Diana . " Witches Of The Craft. [http://witchesofthecraft.com/2012/01/12/the-goddess-diana/] (accessed November 27, 2012).</ref> 
*Mount Algidus, also near Tusculum.<ref>Horace, ''Carmina'' I 21, 5-6; ''Carmen Saeculare''.</ref>
*At [[Lavinium]].<ref>CIL XIV,2112.</ref>
*At [[Tibur]] (Tivoli), where she is referred to as ''Diana Opifera Nemorensis''.<ref>CIL, 3537.</ref>
*A sacred wood mentioned by Livy<ref>Livy ''Ab urbe condita'' XXVII 4.</ref> ''ad compitum Anagninum'' (near [[Anagni]]).
*On Mount [[Tifata]], near [[Capua]] in Campania.<ref>Roy Merle Peterson ''The cults of Campania'' Rome, Papers and Monographs of the American Academy in Rome, 1919, pp. 322-328.</ref>
*In [[Ephesus]], where she was worshipped as Diana of Ephesus and the temple [[Artemision]] used to be one of world's seven wonders.

===In religion===
Diana's cult has been related in [[Early Modern Europe]] to the cult of [[Nicevenn]] (aka Dame Habond, Perchta, Herodiana, etc.). She was related to myths of a female [[Wild Hunt]].

====Wicca====
Today there is a [[Dianic Wicca|branch of Wicca]] named for her, which is characterized by an exclusive focus on the feminine aspect of the Divine.<ref name="FalconDianic">Falcon River (2004) [http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=uswi&c=trads&id=8451 ''The Dianic Wiccan Tradition''].

====Stregheria====
In Italy the old religion of [[Stregheria]] embraced the goddess Diana as Queen of the Witches; witches being the wise women healers of the time. Diana was said to have created the world of her own being having in herself the seeds of all creation yet to come. It was said that out of herself she divided the darkness and the light, keeping for herself the darkness of creation and creating her brother Apollo, the light. Diana was believed to have loved and ruled with her brother Apollo, the god of the Sun.<ref>Charles G. Leland, ''Aradia: The Gospel of Witches'', Theophania Publishing, US, 2010</ref>

===In language===
Both the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] word for "[[fairy]]" ''Zânǎ''<ref name="DEX">''[http://dexonline.ro/definitie/Z%E1%A%A4%N%C4%82 Zânǎ]'' in [[Dicţionarul explicativ al limbii române|DEX]] '98 and [[NODEX]]''</ref> and the [[Leonese language|Leonese]] word for "water nymph" ''[[xana]]'', seem to come from the name of Diana.

===In the arts===
[[File:Paul-Jacques-Aimé Baudry - Diana Reposing - Walters 3712.jpg|thumb|''Diana Reposing'' by [[Paul-Jacques-Aimé Baudry]]. The nude goddess, identified by the [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] in her hair and the bow and [[quiver]] at her side, reclines on a blue drapery.]]
Since the [[Renaissance]] the myth of Diana has often been represented in the visual and dramatic arts, including the opera ''[[L'arbore di Diana]]''.  In the 16th century, Diana's image figured prominently at the châteaus of [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], [[Château de Chenonceau|Chenonceau]], & at [[Château d'Anet|Anet]], in deference to [[Diane de Poitiers]], mistress of [[Henry II of France|Henri of France]]. At [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] she was incorporated into the Olympian iconography with which [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Apollo-like "Sun King" liked to surround himself. Diana is also a character in the 1876 [[Léo Delibes]] ballet ''[[Sylvia (ballet)|Sylvia]]''. The plot deals with Sylvia, one of Diana's nymphs and sworn to chastity, and Diana's assault on Sylvia's affections for the shepherd Amyntas.

====In literature====
*In "[[The Knight's Tale]]" in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', Emily prays to Diana to be spared from marriage to either Palamon or Arcite.
*In "Ode" by [[John Keats]], he writes 'Browsed by none but Dian's fawns' (line 12)
*In the sonnet "To Science" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], science is said to have "dragged Diana from her car".
*Diana Soren, the main character in [[Carlos Fuentes]]' novel ''Diana o la cazadora soltera'' (''Diana, or The Lone Huntress''), is described as having the same personality as the goddess.
*In "Castaway" by [[Augusta Webster]], women who claim they are virtuous despite never having been tempted are referred to as "Dianas." (Line 128)
*In Jonathan Swift's poem: "The Progress of Beauty", as goddess of the moon, Diana is used in comparison to the 17th/early 18th century everyday woman Swift satirically writes about. Starts: 'When first Diana leaves her bed...'
;In Shakespeare
*In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' Diana appears to Pericles in a vision, telling him to go to her temple and tell his story to her followers.
*Diana is referenced in ''[[As You Like It]]'' to describe how Rosalind feels about marriage.
*Diana is referred to in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' when Orsino compares Viola (in the guise of Cesario) to Diana. "Diana's lip is not more smooth and rubious"
*Speaking of his wife, Desdemona, [[Othello]] the [[Moors|Moor]] says, "Her name that was as fresh/As Dian[a]'s visage, is now begrim'd and black/As mine own face." 
*There is a reference to Diana in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' where Hero is said to seem like 'Dian in her orb', in terms of her chastity.
*In ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' Diana appears as a figure in the play and Helena makes multiple allusions to her, such  as, "Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly..." and "...wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian/was both herself and love..." The Steward also says, "...; Dian no queen of virgins,/ that would suffer her poor knight surprised, without/ rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward." It can be assumed that 'Dian' is simply a shortening of 'Diana' since later in the play when Parolles' letter to Diana is read aloud it reads 'Dian'.<ref name="Yale University Press">{{cite book|last=Cross|first=Wilbur L.|title=The Yale Shakespeare: the complete works|year=1993|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=United States of America|isbn=1-56619-104-1|pages=365–399}}</ref> 
*The goddess is also referenced indirectly in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. The character Hippolyta states "And then the moon, like to a silver bow new bent in Heaven". She refers to Diana, goddess of the moon, who is often depicted with a silver hunting bow. In the same play the character Hermia is told by the Duke Theseus that she must either wed the character Demetrius "Or on Diana's alter to protest for aye austerity and single life". He refers to her becoming a nun, with the goddesse Diana having connotations of chastity.
*In ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' Portia states "I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father's will". (I.ii)
*In ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', Romeo describes Rosaline, saying that "She hath Dian's wit".

====In painting and sculpture====
Diana has been one of the most popular themes in art. Painters like [[Titian]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[François Boucher]], [[Nicholas Poussin]] made use of her myth as a major theme. Most depictions of Diana in art featured the stories of Diana and  [[Actaeon]], or [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]],or depicted her resting after hunting. Some famous work of arts with a Diana theme are :
*[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|Diana and Actaeon]], [[Diana and Callisto]], and [[Death of Actaeon]] by Titian.
*''Diana and Callisto'', ''Diana Resting After Bath'', and ''Diana Getting Out of Bath'' by François Boucher.
*''Diana Bathing With Her Nymphs'' by [[Rembrandt]].
*''Diana and Endymion'' by Poussin.
*''Diana and Callisto'', ''Diana and Her Nymph Departing From Hunt'', ''Diana and Her Nymphs Surprised By A Faun'' by Rubens.
*''Diana and Endymion'' by [[Johann Michael Rottmayr]].
*The famous fountain at [[Palace of Caserta]], Italy, created by Paolo Persico, Brunelli, Pietro Solari, depicting Diana being surprised by Acteon.
*A sculpture by [[Christophe-Gabriel Allegrain]] can be seen at the Musée du Louvre.
*''[[Diana (Saint-Gaudens)|"Diana of the Tower"]]'' a copper statue by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] was created as the weather vane for the second [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] in 1893.  It now is on display at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]

*In Parma at the convent of San Paolo, Antonio Allegri da Correggio painted the chamber of the Abbess Giovanna Piacenza's apartment. He was commissioned in 1519 to paint the ceiling and mantel of the fireplace. On the mantel he painted an image of Diana riding in a chariot possibly pulled by a stag.

[[Beaux Arts architecture]] and garden design (late 19th and early 20th centuries) used classic references in a modernized form. Two of the most popular of the period were of [[Pomona]] (goddess of orchards) as a metaphor for Agriculture, and Diana, representing Commerce, which is a perpetual hunt for advantage and profits.

====In film====
*In [[Jean Cocteau]]'s 1946 film ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|La Belle et la Bête]]'' it is Diana's power which has transformed and imprisoned the beast.
*Diana/[[Artemis]] appears at the end of the 'Pastoral Symphony' segment of ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]''.
*In his 1968 film ''[[La Mariée était en noir]]'' [[François Truffaut]] plays on this mythological symbol. Julie Kohler, played by Jeanne Moreau, poses as Diana/[[Artemis]] for the artist Fergus. This choice seems fitting for Julie, a character beset by revenge, of which Fergus becomes the fourth victim. She poses with a bow and arrow, while wearing white.

===Other===
*In the funeral oration of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] in 1997, her brother drew an analogy between the ancient goddess of hunting and his sister - 'the most hunted person of the modern age'.
