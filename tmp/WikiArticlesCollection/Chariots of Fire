'''''Chariots of Fire''''' is a 1981 [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] [[List of historical drama films|historical drama film]]. It tells the fact-based story of two athletes in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]]: [[Eric Liddell]], a devout [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Christian]] who runs for the glory of God, and [[Harold Abrahams]], an [[England|English]] [[Jew]] who runs to overcome prejudice.

The film was conceived and produced by [[David Puttnam]], written by [[Colin Welland]], and directed by [[Hugh Hudson]]. It was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]] and won four, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]. It is ranked 19th in the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of [[BFI Top 100 British films|Top 100 British films]]. The film is also notable for its memorable [[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|instrumental theme tune]] by [[Vangelis]], who won  the Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].

The film's title was inspired by the line, "Bring me my chariot of fire," from the [[William Blake]] poem adapted into the popular British hymn [[And did those feet in ancient time|"Jerusalem"]];  the hymn is heard at the end of the film.<ref>Dans, Peter E.

==Plot==
In 1919, [[Harold Abrahams]] ([[Ben Cross]]) enters the [[University of Cambridge]], where he experiences [[anti-Semitism]] from the staff, but enjoys participating in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] club. He becomes the first person to ever complete the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Trinity Great Court Run]] – running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12. Abrahams achieves an undefeated string of victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with a leading Gilbert and Sullivan soprano, Sybil ([[Alice Krige]]).

[[Eric Liddell]] ([[Ian Charleson]]), born in China of Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie ([[Cheryl Campbell]]) disapproves of Liddell's plans to pursue competitive running. But Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary.

When they first race against each other, Liddell beats Abrahams. Abrahams takes it poorly, but [[Sam Mussabini]] ([[Ian Holm]]), a professional trainer whom he had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters ([[John Gielgud]] and [[Lindsay Anderson]]). They allege it is not gentlemanly for an amateur to "play the tradesman" by employing a professional coach. Abrahams realises this is a cover for their anti-Semitism and class-based sense of superiority, and dismisses their concern.<!--This is pretty well backed up by Gielgud's character's comments concerning "a Semite", "a different god" etc-->

When Eric Liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, his sister Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. Eric tells her that though he intends to eventually return to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when running, and that not to run would be to dishonour God, saying, "I believe that God made me for a purpose. But He also made me fast, and when I run, I feel His pleasure."

The two athletes, after years of training and racing, are accepted to represent [[Great Britain]] in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]] in [[Paris]]. Also accepted are Abrahams' Cambridge friends, Lord Andrew Lindsay ([[Nigel Havers]]), [[Aubrey Montague]] ([[Nicholas Farrell]]), and [[Henry Stallard]] ([[Daniel Gerroll]]). While boarding the boat to Paris for the Olympics, Liddell learns the news that the heat for his 100 metre race will be on a Sunday. He refuses to run the race – despite strong pressure from the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] and the British Olympic committee – because his Christian convictions prevent him from running on the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].

Hope appears in the form of Liddell's teammate Lord Andrew Lindsay. Having already won a silver medal in the [[400 metres hurdles]], Lindsay proposes to yield his place in the [[400 metres|400 metre race]] on the following Thursday to Liddell, who gratefully agrees. His religious convictions in the face of national athletic pride make headlines around the world.

Liddell delivers a sermon at the Paris [[Church of Scotland]] that Sunday, and quotes from [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Isaiah#Chapter 40|Isaiah 40]], ending with:

:But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.

Abrahams is badly beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200 metre race. He knows his last chance for a medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race, and wins. His coach Sam Mussabini is overcome that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams can get on with his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected for the sake of running. Before Liddell's race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now far longer 400 metre race. But one of the American runners, [[Jackson Scholz]], hands Liddell a note of support for his convictions. Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal.

The British team returns home triumphant. As the film ends, onscreen text explains that Abrahams married Sybil, and became the elder statesman of British athletics. Eric Liddell went on to missionary work in China. All of Scotland mourned his death in 1945 in Japanese-occupied China.
Eric Liddell was laid to rest, in Weifang, Shandong, along the side of the Yu He River 200 metres from Shengli East Street in China, the country he loved so much.

== Historical accuracy ==

=== Characters ===
The film depicts Abrahams as attending [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]] with three other Olympic athletes: [[Henry Stallard]], [[Aubrey Montague]], and Lord Andrew Lindsay. Abrahams and Stallard were in fact students there and competed in the 1924 Olympics. Montague also competed in the Olympics  as depicted, but he attended Oxford, not Cambridge.<ref name=aubrey>[http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mo/evelyn-montague-1.html Aubrey Montague biography] at SportsReference.com</ref> Aubrey Montague sent daily letters to his mother about his time at Oxford and the Olympics; these letters were the basis of Montague's narration in the film.

The character of Lindsay was based partially on [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], a significant figure in the history of British athletics. Although Burghley did attend Cambridge, he was not a contemporary of Harold Abrahams, as Abrahams was an undergraduate from 1919 to 1923 and Burghley was at Cambridge from 1923 to 1927. One scene in the film depicts the Burghley-based "Lindsay" as practising hurdles on his estate with full champagne glasses placed on each hurdle – this was something the wealthy Burghley did, although he used matchboxes instead of champagne glasses.<ref name=rw /> The fictional character of Lindsay was created when [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]], who was Britain's third athletics gold medallist in the 1924 Olympics, was not willing to be involved with the film.<ref>Chapman, pp. 275, 295.</ref>

[[File:Cross and Havers.jpg||thumb|right|230px|[[Harold Abrahams|Abrahams]] (left) and the [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Burghley]]-based Lindsay (right) attempt the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Great Court Run]].]]
Another scene in the film recreates the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Great Court Run]], in which the runners attempt to run around the perimeter of the [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in the time it takes the clock to strike 12 at midday. The film shows Abrahams performing the feat for the first time in history. In fact, Abrahams never attempted this race, and at the time of filming the only person on record known to have succeeded was [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], in 1927. In ''Chariots of Fire'', Lindsay, who is based on Lord Burghley, runs the Great Court Run with Abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line just a moment too late. Since the film's release, the Great Court Run has also been successfully run by Trinity undergraduate Sam Dobin, in October 2007.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-490027/Modern-day-hero-runs-away-Chariots-Fire-challenge.html "Modern-day hero runs away with Chariots of Fire challenge."] ''[[Daily Mail]]'' 27 October 2007.</ref>

In the film, Eric Liddell is tripped up by a Frenchman in the 400 metre event of a Scotland–France international athletic meeting. He recovers, makes up a 20 metre deficit, and wins. This was based on fact; the actual race was the 440 yards at a Triangular Contest meet between Scotland, England, and Ireland at [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in England in July 1923. His achievement was remarkable as he had already won the 100- and 220-yard events that day.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Russell W.|title=God's Joyful Runner|publisher=Bridge Publishing, Inc|year=1987|page=54|isbn=0-88270-624-1}}</ref> Also unmentioned with regard to Liddell is that it was he who introduced Abrahams to [[Sam Mussabini]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0019/ |title=A Sporting Nation: Eric Liddell |publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> This is alluded to: In the film Abrahams first encounters Mussabini while he is watching Liddell race. The film, however, suggests that Abrahams himself sought Mussabini's assistance.

Abrahams' fiancée is misidentified as [[Sybil Gordon]], a soprano at the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].  In fact, in 1936, Abrahams married [[Sybil Evers]], who sang at the D'Oyly Carte, but they did not meet until 1934.<ref name=ryan188>Ryan (2012), p. 188.</ref>  Also, in the film, Sybil is depicted as singing the role of Yum-Yum in ''[[The Mikado]]'', but neither Sybil Gordon nor Sybil Evers ever sang that role with D'Oyly Carte,<ref>Stone, David.

Liddell's sister was several years younger than she was portrayed in the film. Her disapproval of Liddell's track career was creative licence; she actually fully supported his sporting work. Jenny Liddell Somerville cooperated fully with the making of the film and has a brief cameo in the Paris [[Church of Scotland]] during Liddell's sermon.<ref>Ramsey, Russell W.

At the memorial service for Harold Abrahams, which opens the film, Lord Lindsay mentions that he and [[Aubrey Montague]] are the only members of the 1924 Olympic team still alive. However, Montague died in 1948, 30 years before Abrahams' death.

===1924 Olympics===
{{See also|Great Britain at the 1924 Summer Olympics}}

The film takes some liberties with the events at the 1924 Olympics, including the events surrounding Liddell's refusal to race on a Sunday. In the film, he doesn't learn that the 100 metre heat is to be held on the Christian Sabbath until he is boarding the boat to Paris. In fact, the schedule was made public several months in advance. Liddell did however face immense pressure to run on that Sunday and to compete in the 100 metres, getting called before a grilling by the British Olympic Committee, the Prince of Wales, and other [[grandee]]s;<ref name=hudson/> and his refusal to run made headlines around the world.<ref>Murray, Feg. [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/361517352.html?dids=361517352:361517352&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Jun+24%2C+1924&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=DID+YOU+KNOW+THAT--&pqatl=google "DID YOU KNOW THAT ..."]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. 24 June 1924. Full headline reads, "Did You Know That Famous Scotch Sprinter Will Not Run In The Olympic 100 Metres Because The Trials Are Run On Sunday".</ref> The decision to change races was, even so, made well before embarking to Paris, and Liddell spent the intervening months training for the 400 metres, an event in which he had previously excelled. It is true, nonetheless, that Liddell's success in the Olympic 400m was largely unexpected.

The film depicts Lindsay, having already won a medal in the 400 metre hurdles, giving up his place in the 400 metre race for Liddell. In fact [[David Burghley|Burghley]], on whom Lindsay is loosely based, was eliminated in the heats of the 110 hurdles (he would go on to win a gold medal in the 400 hurdles at the 1928 Olympics), and was not entered for the 400 metres.

The film reverses the order of Abrahams' 100m and 200m races at the Olympics. In reality, after winning the 100 metres race, Abrahams ran the [[200 metres]] but finished last, [[Jackson Scholz]] taking the gold medal. In the film, before his triumph in the 100m, Abrahams is shown losing the 200m and being scolded by Mussabini. And during the following scene in which Abrahams speaks with his friend Montague while receiving a massage from Mussabini, there is a French newspaper clipping showing Scholz and [[Charlie Paddock]] with a headline which states that the 200 metres was a triumph for the United States. In the same conversation, Abrahams laments getting "beaten out of sight" in the 200. The film thus has Abrahams overcoming the disappointment of losing the 200 by going on to win the 100, a reversal of the real order.

Eric Liddell actually also ran in the 200m race, and finished third, behind Paddock and Scholz. This was the only time in reality that Liddell and Abrahams competed in the same race. Their meeting in the 1923 [[Amateur Athletic Association|AAA]] Championship in the film was fictitious, though Liddell's record win in that race did spur Abrahams to train even harder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/recollections/content/arthurmarshall.htm |title=Recollections by Sir Arthur Marshall |publisher=Content.ericliddell.org |date= |accessdate=28 April 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Abrahams also won a silver medal as an opening runner for the [[4 x 100 metres relay]] team, not shown in the film. [[Aubrey Montague]] placed sixth in the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]], as depicted.<ref  name=aubrey />

====Personal inaccuracies at the Olympics====
In the film, the 100m bronze medallist is a character called "Tom Watson"; the real medallist was [[Arthur Porritt, Baron Porritt|Arthur Porritt]] of [[New Zealand]], who refused permission for his name to be used in the film, allegedly out of modesty. His wish was accepted by the film's producers, even though his permission was not necessary.<ref>{{cite web|author=Arthur Espie Porritt  1900–1994 |url=http://www.library.otago.ac.nz/exhibitions/rhodes_scholars/arthur_espie_porritt.html |title=Reference to Porritt's modesty |publisher=Library.otago.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=28 April 2009}}</ref> However, the brief back-story given for Watson, who is called up to the New Zealand team from the [[University of Oxford]], substantially matches Porritt's history. With the exception of Porritt, all the runners in the 100m final are identified correctly when they line up for inspection by the Prince of Wales.

Jackson Scholz is depicted as handing Liddell an inspirational Bible-quotation message  before the 400 metres final: "It says in the good Book, 'He that honors me, I will honor.' Good luck."<ref>The quoted passage is [[Books of Samuel|First Samuel]] [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Samuel#2:30|2:30]].</ref>  In reality, the note was from members of the British team, and was handed to Liddell before the race by his attending masseur at the team's Paris hotel.<ref name=reid>Reid, Alasdair. "Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell". ''[[The Times]]''. 1 August 2000.</ref> For dramatic purposes, screenwriter Welland asked Scholz if he could be depicted handing the note, and Scholz readily agreed, saying "Yes, great, as long as it makes me look good."<ref name=hudson /><ref>{{cite journal | title = Britain's 1924 Olympic Champs Live Again in 'Chariots of Fire'—and Run Away with the Oscars | work = [[People (magazine)|People]] | date =10 May 1982 | volume = 17 | issue = 18 | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20082112,00.html | accessdate =22 August 2009}}</ref>

== Production ==

=== Script and direction ===
[[File:Charleson as Liddell.jpg|thumb|[[Ian Charleson]], who studied the Bible intensively for his role, wrote Eric Liddell's inspirational speech to the post-race workingmen's crowd.]]
Producer [[David Puttnam]] was looking for a story in the mould of ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]'' (1966), regarding someone who follows his conscience, and felt sports provided clear situations in this sense.<ref>Goodell, Gregory. [http://books.google.com/books?id=T1kc5_QjiF4C&pg=PR17&lpg=PR17&dq=%22david+puttnam%22+%22chariots+of+fire%22+%22man+for+all+seasons%22&source=bl&ots=LvE2kYmoFg&sig=gmauWSjGfpFMK2WqFSkEdz5GmrM&hl=en&ei=zdEPS7jiM8KInQfgrOT0DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=22&ved=0CEMQ6AEwFQ#v=onepage&q=%22david%20puttnam%22%20%22chariots%20of%20fire%22%20%22man%20for%20all%20seasons%22&f=false ''Independent Feature Film Production: A Complete Guide from Concept Through Distribution.''] New York: St. Martin's Press, 1982. p. xvii.</ref> He discovered Eric Liddell's story by accident in 1977, when he happened upon a reference book on the Olympics while housebound from the flu in a rented house in Los Angeles.<ref>Nichols, Peter M. [http://books.google.com/books?id=FIydEd00DbcC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=%22david+puttnam%22+%22chariots+of+fire%22+olympics+book+rented+house&source=bl&ots=SwOUBnTU_L&sig=iY-8ny3tRtAkR14raOQLrQIZDSA&hl=en&ei=TtYPS46PBNXMngenuajTAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22david%20puttnam%22%20%22chariots%20of%20fire%22%20olympics%20book%20rented%20house&f=false ''The New York Times Essential Library, Children's Movies: A Critic's Guide to the Best Films Available on Video and DVD''.] New York: Times Books, 2003. p. 59.</ref><ref name=reunion>Hugh Hudson in ''Chariots of Fire – The Reunion'' (2005 video; featurette on 2005 ''Chariots of Fire'' DVD)</ref>

Screenwriter [[Colin Welland]], commissioned by Puttnam, did an enormous amount of research for his [[Academy Award]]-winning script. Among other things, he took out advertisements in London newspapers seeking memories of the 1924 Olympics, went to the National Film Archives for pictures and footage of the 1924 Olympics, and interviewed everyone involved who was still alive. Welland just missed Abrahams, who died 14 January 1978, but he did attend Abrahams' February 1978 memorial service, which inspired the present-day framing device of the film.<ref name=rw /> [[Aubrey Montague]]'s son saw Welland's newspaper ad and sent him copies of the letters his father had sent home – which gave Welland something to use as a narrative bridge in the film. Except for changes in the greetings of the letters from "Darling Mummy" to "Dear Mum" and the change from Oxford to Cambridge, all of the readings from Montague's letters are from the originals.<ref name=hudson />

Welland's original script also featured, in addition to Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams, a third protagonist, 1924 Olympic gold medallist [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]], who was presented as a privileged aristocratic athlete. However, Lowe refused to have anything to do with the film, and his character was written out and replaced by the fictional character of Lord Andrew Lindsay.<ref>Chapman, pp. 274–295.</ref>

[[Ian Charleson]] himself wrote Eric Liddell's speech to the post-race workingmen's crowd at the Scotland v. Ireland races. Charleson, who had studied the Bible intensively in preparation for the role, told director Hugh Hudson that he didn't feel the portentous and sanctimonious scripted speech was either authentic or inspiring. Hudson and Welland allowed him to write words he personally found inspirational instead.<ref>Ian McKellen, Hugh Hudson, Alan Bates, et al. [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0094702500 ''For Ian Charleson: A Tribute'']. London: Constable and Company, 1990. pp. 37–39. ISBN 0-09-470250-0</ref>

The film was slightly altered for the U.S. audience. A brief scene depicting a pre-Olympics [[cricket]] game between Abrahams, Liddell, Montague, and the rest of the British track team appears shortly after the beginning of the original film. For the American audience, this brief scene was deleted. In the U.S., to avoid the initial child's G rating, which might have hindered box office sales, a different scene was used – one depicting Abrahams and Montague arriving at a Cambridge railway station and encountering two [[World War I]] veterans who use an [[shit|obscenity]] – in order to be given a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG rating]].<ref>Puttnam interviewed in BBC Radio obituary of [[Jack Valenti]].</ref>

Puttnam chose [[Hugh Hudson]], a multiple award-winning advertising and documentary filmmaker who had never helmed a feature film, to direct ''Chariots of Fire''. Hudson and Puttnam had known each other since the 1960s, when Puttnam was an advertising executive and Hudson was making films for ad agencies. In 1977, Hudson had also been [[second-unit]] director on the Puttnam-produced film ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]''.<ref name=round>Round, Simon.

===Casting===
Director [[Hugh Hudson]] was determined to cast young, unknown actors in all the major roles of the film, and to back them up by using veterans like [[John Gielgud]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], and [[Ian Holm]] as their supporting cast. Hudson and producer [[David Puttnam]] did months of fruitless searching for the perfect actor to play Eric Liddell. They then saw Scottish stage actor [[Ian Charleson]] performing the role of Pierre in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s production of ''[[Piaf (play)|Piaf]]'', and knew immediately they had found their man. Unbeknownst to them, Charleson had heard about the film from his father, and desperately wanted to play the part, feeling it would "fit like a kid glove".<ref>Ian McKellen, Hugh Hudson, Alan Bates, et al. ''For Ian Charleson: A Tribute''. London: Constable and Company, 1990. pp. xix, 9, 76.</ref>

[[Ben Cross]], who plays Harold Abrahams, was discovered while playing Billy Flynn in ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. In addition to having a natural pugnaciousness, he had the desired ability to sing and play the piano.<ref name=hudson /><ref>[http://www.bencross.net/biography.html Ben Cross – Bio on Official site]</ref> Cross was thrilled to be cast, and said he was moved to tears by the film's script.<ref name=wings>''Wings on Their Heels: The Making of'' Chariots of Fire. (2005 video; featurette on 2005 DVD).</ref>

[[20th Century Fox]], which put up half of the production budget in exchange for distribution rights outside of North America,<ref>Chapman, pp. 273–274.</ref> insisted on having a couple of notable American names in the cast.<ref name=reunion />  Thus the small parts of the two American champion runners, Jackson Scholz and Charlie Paddock, were cast with recent headliners: [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]] had recently starred in ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'' (also produced by Puttnam), and [[Dennis Christopher]] had recently starred, as a young bicycle racer, in the popular indie film ''[[Breaking Away]]''.<ref name=wings />

All of the actors portraying runners underwent a gruelling three-month training intensive, with renowned running coach Tom McNab. This training and isolation of the actors also created a strong bond and sense of camaraderie among them.<ref name=wings />

===Filming locations===

The beach scenes associated with the theme tune were filmed at West Sands, [[St. Andrews]]. A plaque commemorating the filming can be found there today.

All of the Cambridge scenes were actually filmed at Hugh Hudson's alma mater [[Eton College]], because Cambridge refused filming rights, fearing depictions of anti-Semitism. The Cambridge administration greatly regretted the decision after the film's enormous success.<ref name=hudson />

=== Music ===
{{Main|Chariots of Fire (album)}}
[[File:Charleson on beach.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ian Charleson]] (foreground) and [[Ben Cross]] (left) running in the "[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]" music scene which bookends the film.]]
Although the film is a period piece, set in the 1920s, the [[Academy Award]]-winning original soundtrack composed by [[Vangelis]] uses a modern 1980s electronic sound, with a strong use of [[synthesizers|synthesizer]] and piano among other instruments. This was a bold and significant departure from earlier period films, which employed sweeping orchestral instrumentals. The [[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|title theme of the film]] has become iconic, and has been used in subsequent films and television shows during slow-motion segments.

Vangelis, a Greek-born electronic composer who moved to Paris in the late 1960s, had been living in London since 1974.<ref name="dt">[http://vangeliscollector.com/telegraph112182.htm ''Daily Telegraph'' newspaper, 21 November 1982]</ref> Director Hugh Hudson had collaborated with him on documentaries and commercials, and was also particularly impressed with his 1979 albums ''[[Opera Sauvage]]'' and ''[[China (album)|China]]''.<ref>MacNab, Geoffrey. [http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/everyone-was-a-winner-when-british-talent-met-the-olympic-spirit-7640574.html "Everyone Was a Winner when British Talent Met the Olympic Spirit"]. ''[[The Independent]]''. 13 April 2012.</ref> David Puttnam also greatly admired Vangelis's body of work, having originally selected his compositions for his previous film ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]''.<ref>Hubbert, Julie. [http://books.google.com/books?id=gmc28iYGdMcC&pg=PA426&lpg=PA426&dq=puttnam+vangelis&source=bl&ots=uqcm-_PfON&sig=6frPR9-CwF_fxMfSjiVdlFwvKSI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MkCJT9HJOqqciALJ2bDaCw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=puttnam%20vangelis&f=false ''Celluloid Symphonies: Texts and Contexts in Film Music History'']. University of California Press, 2011. p. 426.</ref> Hudson made the choice for Vangelis and for a modern score: "I knew we needed a piece which was anachronistic to the period to give it a feel of modernity. It was a risky idea but we went with it rather than have a period symphonic score."<ref name=round /> The soundtrack had a personal significance to Vangelis: After composing the iconic theme tune he told Puttnam, "My father is a runner, and this is an anthem to him."<ref name=rw>McLaughlin, John. [http://www.runnersworld.com/article/printer/1,7124,s6-243-297--14187-0,00.html "In Chariots They Ran"]. ''[[Runner's World]]''. February 2012.</ref><ref name="dt" />

Hudson originally wanted Vangelis's 1977 tune "L'Enfant",<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kRS4pkrBqE "L'Enfant", from ''Opera Sauvage'']</ref> from his ''Opera Sauvage'' album, to be the title theme of the film, and the beach running sequence was actually filmed with "L'Enfant" playing on loudspeakers for the runners to pace to. Vangelis finally convinced Hudson he could create a new and better piece for the film's main theme – and when he played the now-iconic "Chariots of Fire" theme for Hudson, it was agreed the new tune was unquestionably better.<ref>Vangelis in ''Chariots of Fire – The Reunion'' (2005 video; featurette on 2005 ''Chariots of Fire'' DVD)</ref> The "L'Enfant" melody still made it into the film: When the athletes reach Paris and enter the stadium, a brass band marches through the field, and first plays a modified, acoustic performance of the piece.<ref>[http://www.elsew.com/data/trivia.htm Trivia about Vangelis]</ref> Vangelis's electronic "L'Enfant" track eventually was used prominently in the 1982 film ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]''.

Some pieces of Vangelis's music in the film did not end up on the film's soundtrack album. One of them is the background music to the race Eric Liddell runs in the Scottish highlands. This piece is a version of "Hymn", the original version of which appears on Vangelis's 1979 album, ''[[Opéra sauvage]]''. Various versions are also included on Vangelis's compilation albums ''[[Themes (Vangelis album)|Themes]]'', ''[[Portraits (So Long Ago, So Clear)|Portraits]]'', and ''[[Odyssey: The Definitive Collection]]'', though none of these include the version used in the film.

Five lively [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] tunes also appear in the soundtrack, and serve as jaunty period music which nicely counterpoints Vangelis's modern electronic score. These are: "He is an Englishman" from ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', "Three Little Maids from School Are We" from ''[[The Mikado]]'', "With Catlike Tread" from ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', "The Soldiers of Our Queen" from ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', and "There Lived a King" from ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.

The film also incorporates a major traditional work: "[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]", sung by a British choir at the 1978 funeral of Harold Abrahams. The words, written by William Blake in 1804-8, were set to music by Parry in 1916 as a celebration of England.   This hymn has been described as "England's unofficial national anthem",<ref>Sanderson, Blair. [http://www.answers.com/topic/sir-charles-hubert-hastings-parry ''Hubert Parry''.] [[AllMusic]] Guide, reprinted in Answers.com.</ref> concludes the film and inspired its title.<ref>Manchel, Frank.

''Chariots of Fire'' became a recurring theme in promotions for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London. The film's theme tune was featured at the opening of the 2012 London New Years fireworks celebrating the Olympics,<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1yLRK2M8YQ London Fireworks 2012 - New Year Live - BBC One]</ref> and the film's iconic beach-running scene and theme tune were used in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'''s "Let's Make It Great, Britain" Olympic ads.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3b-o63wd_M "Let's Make It Great, Britain"]</ref> The runners who first tested the new [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] were spurred on by the ''Chariots of Fire'' theme tune,<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17546859 "London 2012: Olympic Park Runners Finish Race"].

===Stage adaptation===

The play, ''[[Chariots of Fire (play)|Chariots of Fire]]'', which was adapted by playwright [[Mike Bartlett (playwright)|Mike Bartlett]] and included the iconic Vangelis score, ran from 9 May to 16 June 2012 at London's [[Hampstead Theatre]], and transferred to the [[Gielgud Theatre]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] on 23 June, where it ran until 5 January 2013.<ref>Rees, Jasper.
