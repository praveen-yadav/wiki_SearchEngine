{{about|county administrative centres in Ireland and the UK|those in the United States|county seat}}

A '''county town''' is a county's [[administrative centre]] in the United Kingdom or Ireland.  County towns are usually the location of administrative or judicial functions, or established over time as the ''de facto'' main town of a county.  The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of "their" administrative county. For example, [[Nottingham]] is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of [[Nottinghamshire]]. Many county towns are in fact [[city status in the United Kingdom|cities]], but all are referred to as county towns irrespective of whether city status is held or not.

# Between 1536 and 1974, Monmouthshire was included by successive English and later, British, governments within England for some administrative and legal purposes.  Always regarded culturally and ecclesiastically as part of Wales, particularly by the Welsh, since 1974 when new local government legislation was introduced it has unequivocally been within that country. The county is named after Monmouth, but the Sheriff's county court was held alternately in Monmouth and Newport.

Notes: 

'*' indicates that the county was created after the reforms of the late 20th century

'~' indicates that the county was created in the early 19th century

'^' indicates that the county no longer has an administration purpose

== County towns post the late 19th century reforms==
With the creation of elected [[county council]]s in 1889 the location of administrative headquarters in some cases moved away from the traditional county town. Furthermore, in 1965 and 1974 there were major boundary changes in [[England and Wales]] and [[administrative county|administrative counties]] were replaced with new [[metropolitan county|metropolitan]] and [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan counties]].  The boundaries underwent further alterations between 1995 and 1998 to create [[Unitary Authority|unitary authorities]] and some of the ancient counties and county towns were restored.  (Note: not all headquarters are or were called County Halls or Shire Halls e.g.: Cumbria County Council's HQ is called ''The Courts'').  Before 1974 many of the county halls were located in towns and cities that had the status of a [[county borough]] i.e.: a borough outside of the county council's jurisdiction.

# Due to its better transport links and more central location, some administrative functions were moved to [[Llangefni]].
# [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]] was often still referred to as 'the county town' due to the name link. However, assizes were held at [[Lampeter]] while Aberystwyth housed the administration of the county council. Aberystwyth was therefore the de facto county town.
# Due to its better transport links and more central location, some administrative functions were moved to [[Llandrindod Wells]].
