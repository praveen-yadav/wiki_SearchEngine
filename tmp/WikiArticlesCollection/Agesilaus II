'''Agesilaus II''', or '''Agesilaos II''' ({{lang-grc|'''Ἀγησίλαος'''}}) (444–360 BC) was a [[Eurypontid]] king of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] city-state of [[Sparta]], ruling from approximately 400 BC to 360 BC, during most of which time he was, in [[Plutarch]]'s words, "as good as thought commander and king of all Greece," and was for the whole of it greatly identified with his country's deeds and fortunes.<ref name="DGRBM">{{Citation  | last = Clough  | first = Arthur Hugh  | author-link = Arthur Hugh Clough  | contribution = Agesilaus II  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 69–70  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0078.html }}</ref> Small in stature and lame from birth, Agesilaus became ruler somewhat unexpectedly in his mid-forties. His early reign saw successful military incursions into various states in what is now [[Turkey]], although several diplomatic decisions resulted in Sparta becoming increasingly isolated prior to his death at the age of 84 in [[Cyrenaica]] (part of modern Libya).

==History==

===Early life===
Agesilaus was the son of [[Archidamus II]] and his second wife, Eupoleia,<ref name="OCD">{{Citation  | last = Cartledge  | first = Paul Anthony  | author-link =   | contribution = Agesilaus II  | editor-last = Hornblower  | editor-first = Simon  | title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]  | volume =   | pages =   | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | place = Oxford  | year = 1996  | contribution-url = }}</ref> brother to [[Cynisca]] (the first woman in ancient history to achieve an [[ancient Olympic Games|Olympic victory]]), and younger half-brother of [[Agis II]].<ref name="livius">[http://www.livius.org/ag-ai/agesilaus/agesilaus.htm Agesilaus] from [http://www.livius.org Livius.Org]</ref>

The is little surviving detail on the youth of Agesilaus. Lame from birth, he was not expected to succeed to the throne after his brother king [[Agis II]], especially because the latter had a son ([[Leotychidas, son of Agis|Leotychidas]]). Therefore, Agesilaus was trained in the traditional curriculum of Sparta, the ''[[agoge]].'' However, Leotychidas was ultimately set aside as illegitimate (contemporary rumors representing him as the son of [[Alcibiades]]) and Agesilaus became king around 401 BC, at the age of about forty. In addition to questions of his nephew's paternity, Agesilaus' succession was largely due to the intervention of his Spartan general, [[Lysander]], who hoped to find in him a willing tool for the furtherance of his political designs.<ref name="livius"/> [[Lysander]] and the young Agesilaus came to maintain an intimate relation (see [[Pederasty in Ancient Greece]]), as was common of the period. Their unique relationship would serve an important role during Agesilaus' later campaigns in Asia Minor.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[Xenophon]], ''Hell.'' iii. 3, to the end, ''Agesilaus''</ref>

===Early reign===
[[File:DionysiusMapAgesilaus.png|thumb|right|Agesilaus expels the Illyrians from Epirus]]
Agesilaus is first recorded as king during the suppression of the [[conspiracy of Cinadon]], shortly after 398 BC.<ref name="DGRBM"/>  Then, in 396 BC, Agesilaus crossed into Asia with a force of 2,000 [[neodamodes]] (freed [[helots]]) and 6,000 allies (including 30 Spartiates) to liberate [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] cities from [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] dominion.  On the eve of sailing from [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] he attempted to offer a sacrifice, as [[Agamemnon]] had done before the [[Troy|Trojan]] expedition, but the [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] intervened to prevent it, an insult for which he never forgave them.  On his arrival at [[Ephesus]] a three months' truce was concluded with [[Tissaphernes]], the [[satrap]] of [[Lydia]] and [[Caria]], but negotiations conducted during that time proved fruitless, and on its termination Agesilaus raided [[Phrygia]], where he easily won immense booty from the satrap [[Pharnabazus (5th century BC)|Pharnabazus]]; Tissaphernes could offer no assistance, as he had concentrated his troops in Caria. In these campaigns Agesilaus also benefited from the aid of the [[Ten Thousand]] (a mercenary army), who marched through miles of Persian territory to reach the Black Sea. After spending the winter organizing a [[cavalry]] force (''[[hippeis]]''), he made a successful incursion into [[Lydia]] in the spring of 395 BC.  [[Tithraustes]] was sent to replace Tissaphernes, who paid with his life for his continued failure.  An armistice was concluded between Tithraustes and Agesilaus, who left the southern [[satrap]]y and again invaded [[Phrygia]], which he ravaged until the following spring.  He then came to an agreement with Pharnabazus and once more turned southward.<ref name="DGRBM"/>

During these campaigns, [[Lysander]] attempted to manipulate Agesilaus into ceding his authority. Agesilaus, the former passive lover of Lysander, would have nothing of this, and reminded Lysander (who was only a Spartan general) who was king. He had Lysander sent away to assist the naval campaigns in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. This dominating move by Agesilaus earned the respect of his men-at-arms and of Lysander himself, who remained emotionally close with Agesilaus.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In 394 BC, while encamped on the [[plain of Thebe]], he was planning a campaign in the interior, or even an attack on [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] himself, when he was recalled to [[Greece]] owing to the war between [[Sparta]] and the combined forces of [[Athens]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], [[Argos]] and several minor states.  A rapid march through [[Thrace]] and [[Macedon]]ia brought him to [[Thessaly]], where he repulsed the Thessalian cavalry who tried to impede him.  Reinforced by [[Phocis|Phocian]] and [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenian]] troops and a Spartan army, he met the confederate forces at [[Coronea]] in [[Boeotia]] and in a [[Battle of Coronea (394 BC)|hotly contested battle]] was technically victorious. However, the Spartan baggage train was ransacked and Agesilaus himself was injured during the fighting, resulting in a subsequent retreat by way of [[Delphi]] to the [[Peloponnese]]. Shortly before this battle the Spartan [[navy]], of which he had received the supreme command, was totally defeated off [[Knidos|Cnidus]] by a powerful Persian fleet under [[Conon]] and [[Pharnabazus (5th century BC)|Pharnabazus]].<ref name="livius"/>

During these conflicts in mainland Greece, [[Lysander]] perished while attacking the walls of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]. [[Pausanias II of Sparta|Pausanias]], the second king of Sparta (see [[Spartan Constitution]] for more information on Sparta's dual monarchy), was supposed to provide Lysander with reinforcements as they marched into [[Boeotia]], yet failed to arrive in time to assist Lysander, likely because Pausanias disliked him for his brash and arrogant attitude towards the Spartan royalty and government. Pausanias failed to fight for the bodies of the dead, and because he retrieved the bodies under truce (a sign of defeat), he was disgraced and banished from Sparta.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In 393 BC, Agesilaus engaged in a ravaging invasion of [[Argolis]].  In 392 BC he took a prominent part in the [[Corinthian War]], making several successful expeditions into Corinthian territory and capturing [[Lechaeum]] and [[Piraeus]].  The loss, however, of a battalion (mora), destroyed by [[Iphicrates]], neutralized these successes, and Agesilaus returned to Sparta.  In 389 BC he conducted a campaign in [[Acarnania]], but two years later the [[Peace of Antalcidas]], warmly supported by Agesilaus, put an end to hostilities.  In this interval, Agesilaus declined command over Sparta's aggression on [[Mantineia]], and justified [[Phoebidas]]' seizure of the Theban [[Cadmea]] so long as the outcome provided glory to Sparta.<ref name="DGRBM"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Decline===
When war broke out afresh with Thebes Agesilaus  twice invaded [[Boeotia]] (in 378 BC and 377 BC), although he spent the next five years largely out of action due to an unspecified but apparently grave illness.  In the congress of 371 BC an altercation is recorded between him and the Theban general [[Epaminondas]], and due to his influence Thebes was peremptorily excluded from the peace, and orders given for [[Cleombrotus I|Cleombrotus]] to march against [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] in 371 BC.  Cleombrotus was defeated at [[Leuctra]] and the Spartan supremacy overthrown.<ref name="livius"/>

In 370 BC Agesilaus was engaged in an embassy to [[Mantineia]], and reassured the Spartans with an invasion of [[Arcadia]].  He preserved an un-walled Sparta against the revolts and conspiracies of [[helot]]s, [[perioeci]] and even other Spartans; and against external enemies, with four different armies led by [[Epaminondas]] penetrating [[Laconia]] that same year. Again, in 362 BC, Epaminondas almost succeeded in seizing the city bwith a rapid and unexpected march.  The [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]], in which Agesilaus took no part, was followed by a general peace: Sparta, however, stood aloof, hoping even yet to recover her supremacy.  According to [[Xenophon]],<ref>[[Xenophon]], ''Agesilaus'', ii. 26, 27</ref> Agesilaus, in order to gain money for prosecuting the war, supported the [[satrap]] [[Ariobarzanes II of Cius|Ariobarzanes II]] in his revolt against [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] in 364 BC ([[Revolt of the Satraps]]), and in 361 BC he went to [[Egypt]] at the head of a [[mercenary]] force to aid the king [[Nectanebo I]] and his regent [[Teos of Egypt|Teos]] against Persia.  He soon transferred his services to Teos's cousin and rival [[Nectanebo II]], who, in return for his help, gave him a sum of over 200 talents.  On his way home Agesilaus died in [[Cyrenaica]], around the age of 84, after a reign of some 41 years.  His body was embalmed in wax, and buried at Sparta.<ref name="DGRBM"/>

===Legacy===
Agesilaus was of small stature and unimpressive appearance, and was lame from birth. These facts were used as an argument against his succession, an [[oracle]] having warned Sparta against a "lame reign."  Most ancient writers considered him a highly successful leader in [[guerrilla warfare]], alert and quick, yet cautious—a man, moreover, whose personal bravery was rarely questioned in his own time.  Of his courage, temperance, and hardiness, many instances are cited: and to these were added the less Spartan qualities of kindliness and tenderness as a father and a friend.  As examples: there is the story of his riding across a stick (horse made of stick) with his children and upon being discovered by a friend desiring that he not mention till he himself were the father of children; and because of the affection of his son [[Archidamus III|Archidamus]]' for [[Cleonymus, son of Sphodrias|Cleonymus]], he saved [[Sphodrias]], Cleonymus' father, from execution for his incursion into the [[Piraeus]], and dishonorable retreat, in 378 BC.<ref name="DGRBM"/>  Modern writers tend to be slightly more critical of Agesilaus' reputation and achievements, reckoning him an excellent soldier, but one who had a poor understanding of sea power and [[siegecraft]].<ref name="OCD"/>

As a statesman he won himself both enthusiastic adherents and bitter enemies.  Agesilaus was most successful in the opening and closing periods of his reign: commencing but then surrendering a glorious career in Asia; and in extreme age, maintaining his prostrate country.  Other writers acknowledge his extremely high popularity at home, but suggest his occasionally rigid and arguably irrational political loyalties and convictions contributed greatly to Spartan decline, notably his unremitting hatred of Thebes, which led to Sparta's humiliation at the [[Battle of Leuctra]] and thus the end of Spartan hegemony.<ref name="OCD"/>

Other historical accounts paint Agesilaus as a prototype for the ideal leader. His awareness, thoughtfulness, and wisdom were all traits to be emulated diplomatically, while his bravery and shrewdness in battle epitomized the heroic Greek commander. These historians point towards the unstable oligarchies established by Lysander in the former Athenian Empire and the failures of Spartan leaders (such as Pausanias and Kleombrotos) for the eventually suppression of Spartan power. The ancient historian [[Xenophon]] was a huge admirer and served under Agesilaus during the campaigns into [[Asia Minor]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

[[Plutarch]] includes among his 78 essays and speeches comprising the [[Apophthegmata Laconica|apophthegmata]] Agesilaus' letter to the [[ephor]]s on his recall:
{{quote|We have reduced most of Asia, driven back the barbarians, made arms abundant in Ionia. But since you bid me, according to the decree, come home, I shall follow my letter, may perhaps be even before it. For my command is not mine, but my country's and her allies'.  And a commander then commands truly according to right when he sees his own commander in the laws and ephors, or others holding office in the state.}}

And when asked whether he wanted a memorial erected in his honor:
{{quote|If I have done any noble action, that is a sufficient memorial; if I have done nothing noble, all the statues in the world will not preserve my memory.<ref>In [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Εἰ γάρ τι καλὸν ἔργον πεποίηκα, τοῦτό μου μνημεῖον ἔσται; εἰ δὲ μή, οὐδ' οἱ πάντες ἀνδριάντες}}</ref>}}

He lived in the most frugal style alike at home and in the field, and though his campaigns were undertaken largely to secure booty, he was content to enrich the state and his friends and to return as poor as he had set forth.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], xiv. xv</ref><ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' iii. 97 10</ref><ref>[[Plutarch]] and [[Cornelius Nepos]], ''in vita''</ref><ref>[[Plutarch]], ''[[Apophthegmata Laconica]]''</ref>

He was succeeded by his son [[Archidamus III]].

==Selected quotes==
When someone was praising an orator for his ability to magnify small points, he said, "In my opinion it's not a good cobbler who fits large shoes on small feet."

Another time he watched a mouse being pulled from its hole by a small boy. When the mouse turned around, bit the hand of its captor and escaped, he pointed this out to those present and said, "When the tiniest creature defends itself like this against aggressors, what ought men to do, do you reckon?"

Certainly when somebody asked what gain the laws of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]] had brought Sparta, he answered, "Contempt for pleasures."

Asked once how far Sparta's boundaries stretched, he brandished his spear and said, "As far as this can reach."

On noticing a house in Asia roofed with square beams, he asked the owner whether timber grew square in that area. When told no, it grew round, he said, "What then? If it were square, would you make it round?"

As he was dying on the voyage back from Egypt, he gave instructions to those close to him that they should not be responsible for making any image of his person, be it modeled or painted or copied, "For if I have accomplished any glorious feat, that will be my memorial. But if I have not, not even all the statues in the world—the products of vulgar, worthless men—would make any difference."<ref name="plutarch">[[Plutarch]]: "Sayings of Spartans," Penguin Classics, 2005 Revised Edition</ref>

Invited to hear an actor who could perfectly imitate the nightingale, Agesilaus declined, saying he had heard the nightingale itself.
