'''Crystallography''' is the science that examines the arrangement of [[atom]]s in [[solid]]s. The word "crystallography" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''crystallon'' = cold drop / frozen drop, with its meaning extending to all solids with some degree of transparency, and ''grapho'' = write. A more comprehensive  definition is: "Crystallography is the science of condensed matter with emphasis on the atomic or molecular structure and its relation to physical and chemical properties[http://www.oldenbourg-link.com/doi/abs/10.1524/zkri.217.7.357.23723?journalCode=zkri .]"
 
Before the development of X-ray diffraction crystallography (see below), the study of crystals was based on their geometry. This involves measuring the angles of crystal faces relative to theoretical reference axes (crystallographic axes), and establishing the [[symmetry]] of the crystal in question. The former is carried out using a [[goniometer]]. The position in 3D space of each crystal face is plotted on a stereographic net, e.g. [[Wulff net]] or [[Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection|Lambert net]]. In fact, the [[pole figure|pole]] to each face is plotted on the net. Each point is labelled with its [[Miller index]]. The final plot allows the symmetry of the crystal to be established. 

Crystallographic methods now depend on the analysis of the [[diffraction]] patterns of a sample targeted by a beam of some type.   Although [[X-ray]]s are most commonly used, the beam is not always [[electromagnetic radiation]]. For some purposes [[electron]]s or [[neutron]]s are used.  This is facilitated by the wave properties of the particles. Crystallographers often explicitly state the type of illumination used when referring to a method, as with the terms ''[[X-ray diffraction]], [[neutron diffraction]]'' and ''[[electron diffraction]].'' 

These three types of radiation interact with the specimen in different ways. [[X-ray]]s interact with the spatial distribution of the [[valence electrons]], while [[electron]]s are [[charged particle]]s and therefore feel the total charge distribution of both the [[atomic nuclei]] and the surrounding electrons. [[Neutron]]s are scattered by the atomic nuclei through the [[strong nuclear force]]s, but in addition, the [[magnetic moment]] of neutrons is non-zero. They are therefore also scattered by [[magnetic field]]s. When neutrons are scattered from hydrogen-containing materials, they produce diffraction patterns with high noise levels. However, the material can sometimes be treated to substitute [[deuterium]] for [[hydrogen]]. Because of these different forms of interaction, the three types of radiation are suitable for different crystallographic studies.

==Theory==
{{Condensed matter physics}}

Generally,  an image of a small object is made using a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] to focus the illuminating radiation, as is done with the rays of the [[optical spectrum|visible spectrum]] in light [[microscope|microscopy]]. However, the wavelength of visible light (about 4000 to 7000 [[ångström]]) is three [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] longer than the length of typical [[chemical bond|atomic bonds]] and [[atom]]s themselves (about 1 to 2 Å). Therefore, obtaining information about the spatial arrangement of atoms requires the use of radiation with shorter wavelengths, such as X-ray or neutron beams. Employing shorter wavelengths implied abandoning microscopy and true imaging, however, because there exists no material from which a lens capable of focusing this type of radiation can be created.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} (That said, scientists have had some success focusing X-rays with microscopic [[Fresnel zone plate]]s made from gold, and by critical-angle reflection inside long tapered capillaries.)<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Synchrotron Radiation
|volume=14|year=2007|pages=326–330|doi=10.1107/S0909049507025174|title=Two-step hard X-ray focusing combining Fresnel zone plate and single-bounce ellipsoidal capillary|author=A. Snigirev ''et al.''|pmid=17587657|issue=Pt 4}}</ref> Diffracted X-ray or neutrons beams cannot be focused to produce images, so the sample structure must be reconstructed from the diffraction pattern. Sharp features in the diffraction pattern arise from periodic, repeating structure in the sample, which are often very strong due to coherent reflection of many photons from many regularly spaced instances of similar structure, while non-periodic components of the structure result in diffuse (and usually weak) diffraction features. Said more simply, areas with a higher density and repetition of atom order tend to reflect more light toward one point in space when compared to those areas with fewer atoms and less repetition.

Because of their highly ordered and repetitive structure, crystals give diffraction patterns of sharp [[Bragg reflection]] spots, and are ideal for analyzing the structure of solids.

{{Main|Miller index}}

*Coordinates in ''square [[bracket]]s'' such as '''<nowiki>[100]</nowiki>''' denote a direction vector (in real space).

*Coordinates in ''angle brackets'' or ''chevrons'' such as '''&lt;100&gt;''' denote a ''family'' of directions which are related by symmetry operations. In the cubic crystal system for example, '''<100>''' would mean <nowiki>[100], [010], [001]</nowiki> or the negative of any of those directions.

*Miller indices in ''parentheses'' such as '''(100)''' denote a plane of the crystal structure, and regular repetitions of that plane with a particular spacing. In the cubic system, the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the (hkl) plane is the direction [hkl], but in lower-symmetry cases, the normal to (hkl) is not parallel to [hkl].

*Indices in ''curly brackets'' or ''braces'' such as '''<nowiki>{100}</nowiki>''' denote a family of planes and their normals which are equivalent in cubic materials due to symmetry operations, much the way angle brackets denote a family of directions. In non-cubic materials, <hkl> is not necessarily perpendicular to {hkl}.

==Technique==

Some materials studied using crystallography, [[protein]]s for example, do not occur naturally as crystals. Typically, such molecules are placed in solution and allowed to crystallize over days, weeks, or months through vapor [[diffusion]]. A drop of solution containing the molecule, buffer, and precipitants is sealed in a container with a reservoir containing a [[hygroscopic]] solution. Water in the drop diffuses to the reservoir, slowly increasing the concentration and allowing a crystal to form. If the concentration were to rise more quickly, the molecule would simply [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] out of solution, resulting in disorderly granules rather than an orderly and hence usable crystal.

Once a crystal is obtained, data can be collected using a beam of radiation. Although many universities that engage in crystallographic research have their own X-ray producing equipment, [[Synchrotron light|synchrotron]]s are often used as X-ray sources, because of the purer and more complete patterns such sources can generate. Synchrotron sources also have a much higher intensity of X-ray beams, so data collection takes a fraction of the time normally necessary at weaker sources. Complementary neutron crystallography techniques are used to enhance hydrogen atoms positions. Such techniques are available in [[Neutron facilities]]. 

Producing an image from a diffraction pattern requires sophisticated [[mathematics]] and often an iterative process of '''modelling and refinement.''' In this process, the mathematically predicted diffraction patterns of an hypothesized or "model" structure are compared to the actual pattern generated by the crystalline sample. Ideally, researchers make several initial guesses, which through refinement all converge on the same answer. Models are refined until their predicted patterns match to as great a degree as can be achieved without radical revision of the model. This is a painstaking process, made much easier today by computers. 

The mathematical methods for the analysis of diffraction data only apply to ''patterns,'' which in turn result only when waves diffract from orderly arrays. Hence crystallography applies for the most part only to crystals, or to molecules which can be coaxed to crystallize for the sake of measurement. In spite of this, a certain amount of molecular information can be deduced from the patterns that are generated by fibers and [[powder diffraction|powders]], which while not as perfect as a solid crystal, may exhibit a degree of order. This level of order can be sufficient to deduce the structure of simple molecules, or to determine the coarse features of more complicated molecules. For example, the double-helical structure of [[DNA]] was deduced from an X-ray diffraction pattern that had been generated by a fibrous sample.

==Crystallography in materials engineering==
Crystallography is a tool that is often employed by materials scientists. In single crystals, the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is often easy to see macroscopically, because the natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure. In addition, physical properties are often controlled by crystalline defects. The understanding of crystal structures is an important prerequisite for understanding [[crystallographic defect]]s. Mostly, materials do not occur in a single crystalline, but poly-crystalline form, such that the [[powder diffraction]] method plays a most important role in structural determination.

A number of other physical properties are linked to crystallography.  For example, the minerals in [[clay]] form small, flat, platelike structures. Clay can be easily deformed because the platelike particles can slip along each other in the plane of the plates, yet remain strongly connected in the direction perpendicular to the plates. Such mechanisms can be studied by crystallographic [[Texture (crystalline)|texture]] measurements.

In another example, [[iron]] transforms from a [[body-centered cubic]] (bcc) structure to a [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc) structure called [[austenite]] when it is heated. The fcc structure is a close-packed structure, and the bcc structure is not, which explains why the volume of the iron decreases when this transformation occurs. 

Crystallography is useful in phase identification. When performing any process on a material, it may be desired to find out what compounds and what phases are present in the material. Each phase has a characteristic arrangement of atoms. Techniques like X-ray or neutron diffraction can be used to identify which patterns are present in the material, and thus which compounds are present.

Crystallography covers the enumeration of the symmetry patterns which can be formed by atoms in a crystal and for this reason has a relation to group theory and geometry. See [[symmetry group]].

==Biology==
[[X-ray crystallography]] is the primary method for determining the molecular conformations of biological [[macromolecule]]s, particularly [[protein]] and [[nucleic acid]]s such as [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. In fact, the double-helical structure of DNA was deduced from crystallographic data. The first crystal structure of a macromolecule was solved in 1958.<ref>Kendrew, J.C. et al. (1958)</ref> A three-dimensional model of the myoglobin molecule obtained by X-ray analysis.<ref>(''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' 181, 662–666). [http://www.nature.com/physics/looking-back/kendrew/kendrew.pdf]</ref> The [[Protein Data Bank]] (PDB) is a freely accessible repository for the structures of [[protein]]s and other biological macromolecules. Computer programs like [[RasMol]] or [[Pymol]] can be used to visualize biological molecular structures.
[[Neutron crystallography]] is often used to help refine structures obtained by X-ray methods or to solve a specific bond; the methods are often viewed as complementary, as X-rays are sensitive to electron positions and scatter most strongly off heavy atoms, while neutrons are sensitive to nucleus positions and scatter strongly off many light isotopes, including hydrogen and deuterium.
[[Electron crystallography]] has been used to determine some protein structures, most notably [[membrane protein]]s and [[viral capsid]]s.
