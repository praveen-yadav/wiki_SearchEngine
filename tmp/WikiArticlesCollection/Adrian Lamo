===Security compromise===
In December 2001, Lamo was praised by [[Worldcom]] for helping to fortify their corporate security.<ref>{{cite web|last=Poulsen|first=Kevin|title=FBI reportedly hunting Adrian Lamo|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/09/05/fbi_reportedly_hunting_adrian_lamo/|publisher=The Register}}</ref> In February 2002 he broke into the internal computer network of ''The New York Times'', adding his name to the internal database of expert sources, and using the paper's [[LexisNexis]] account to conduct research on high-profile subjects. The ''New York Times'' filed a complaint, and a warrant for Lamo's arrest was issued in August 2003 following a 15-month investigation by federal prosecutors in New York. At 10:15 AM on September 9, after spending a few days in hiding, he surrendered to the [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshals]] in [[Sacramento, California]]. He re-surrendered to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in New York City on September 11, and pled guilty to one felony count of [[computer crime]]s against [[Microsoft]], [[LexisNexis]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 8, 2004.<ref>{{cite web|first=Noah|last=Shachtman |url=http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/news/2004/01/61831 |title="Adrian Lamo Cuts Deal With Feds" |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Kevin Poulsen |url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/7771 |title="Lamo Pleads Guilty to Times Hack" |publisher=Securityfocus.com |date=2004-01-08 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref> 

Later in 2004, Lamo was sentenced to six months detention at his parents' home plus two years probation, and was ordered to pay roughly $65,000 in restitution. He was convicted of compromising security at ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[Microsoft]],<ref>

When challenged for a response to allegations that he was glamorizing crime for the sake of publicity, his response was "Anything I could say about my person or my actions would only cheapen what they have to say for themselves".

===DNA controversy===
On May 9, 2006, while 18 months into a two-year probation sentence, Lamo refused to give the [[United States government]] a blood sample, one that they had demanded in order to record his [[DNA]] in their [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]] system.<ref>

</ref> According to his attorney, Lamo has a religious objection to giving blood, but is willing to give his DNA in another form. On June 15, 2007, lawyers for Lamo filed a motion citing the [[Book of Genesis]] as one basis for Lamo's religious opposition to the giving of blood.

On June 21, 2007, it was reported that Lamo's legal counsel had reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] granting Lamo's original request. According to [[Kevin Poulsen]]'s blog, "the Justice Department formally settled the case, filing a joint stipulation along with Lamo's federal public defender dropping the demand for blood, and accepting cheek swabs instead." Reached for comment, Lamo reportedly affirmed to Poulsen his intention to "comply vigorously" with the order.<ref>

In February 2009, a partial list of the anonymous donors to the WikiLeaks not-for-profit website was leaked and published on the WikiLeaks website.

Lamo has characterized his decision to work with the government as morally ambiguous but objectively necessary, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' "There were no right choices that day, only less wrong ones. It was cold, it was needful, and it was no one's to make except mine," adding to The Guardian's Ed Pilkington "There were hundreds of thousands of documents – let's drop the number to 250,000 to be conservative – and doing nothing meant gambling that each and every one would do no harm if no warning was given."<ref>{{cite web

</ref> Greenwald places the incident in the context of what he calls "the Obama administration's unprecedented war on whistle-blowers".<ref name=gg /> Greenwald's critique of ''Wired Magazine'' has drawn a response from that magazine which suggests that Greenwald is writing disingenuously:  "At his most reasonable, Greenwald impugns our motives, attacks the character of our staff and carefully selects his facts and sources to misrepresent the truth and generate outrage in his readership."<ref name=wiredgg>{{cite web|last=Hansen |first=Evan |url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/greenwald/ |title=Putting the Record Straight on the Lamo–Manning Chat Logs &#124; Threat Level |publisher=Wired.com |date=2010-12-31 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref> In an article about the Manning case, Greenwald mentions ''Wired'' reporter [[Kevin Poulsen]]'s 1994 felony conviction for computer hacking, suggesting that "over the years, Poulsen has served more or less as Lamo's personal media voice."<ref name=gg /> Greenwald is skeptical of an earlier story written by Poulsen about Lamo's institutionalization on psychiatric grounds, writing:  "Lamo claimed he was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, a somewhat fashionable autism diagnosis which many stars in the computer world have also claimed."<ref name=gg /> In his response, Poulsen accused Greenwald of "name-calling, bizarre conspiracy theories and ad hominem attacks".<ref name=wiredgg /> 

Greenwald called for ''Wired'' to release more of the chat logs in its possession that pertain to a conversation between Manning and Lamo:  "there are clearly relevant parts of those chats which ''Wired'' continues to conceal".<ref name=gg /> ''Wired''{{'}}s editor-in-chief reiterated that "the logs include sensitive personal information with no bearing on WikiLeaks, and it would serve no purpose to publish them at this time."<ref name=wiredgg /> In an article entitled "The Worsening Journalistic Disgrace at Wired", Greenwald claimed that ''Wired'' was "actively conceal[ing] from the public, for months on end, the key evidence in a political story that has generated headlines around the world."<ref>{{cite web|last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/12/27/wired |title=The worsening journalistic disgrace at Wired – Glenn Greenwald |publisher=Salon.com |date=2010-12-27 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref>

====Criticism of Anonymous====
Lamo has been critical of media coverage of the hacker collective [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], claiming that media outlets have over-hyped and mythologised the group. He also said that Anonymous is not the 'invulnerable' group it is claimed to be, and can see "no rational point in what they're doing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/344388/20120523/adrian-lamo-snitch-anonymous-bradley-manning-wikileaks.htm|title=EXCLUSIVE: Hacker Adrian Lamo Who Betrayed Wikileaks' Manning Turns Fire on Anonymous|author=Gianluca Mezzofiore|date=2012-05-23|publisher=International Business Times}}</ref>

==Film and television==
On 22 August 2002, Lamo was removed from a segment of [[NBC Nightly News]] when, after being asked to demonstrate his skills for the camera, he gained access to NBC's internal network.<ref>

''[[Hackers Wanted]]'', a documentary film focusing on Lamo's life as a hacker, was produced by [[Trigger Street Productions]], and narrated by [[Kevin Spacey]].<ref name=film>{{cite web|last=Poulsen |first=Kevin |url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/05/hackers-wante/ |title=Lost Hacking Documentary Surfaces on Pirate Bay &#124; Threat Level |publisher=Wired.com |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref> Focusing on the 2003 hacking scene, the film features interviews with [[Kevin Rose]] and [[Steve Wozniak]].<ref name=film /> The film has not been conventionally released. In May 2009, a video purporting to be a trailer for ''Hackers Wanted'' was allegedly leaked to or by Internet film site Eye Crave.<ref>
