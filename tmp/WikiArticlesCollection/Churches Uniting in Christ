'''Churches Uniting in Christ''' (CUIC) is an ecumenical organization that brings together ten [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline]] [[United States|American]] [[religious denomination|denominations]] (including both predominantly [[White people|white]] and predominantly [[African American|black]] churches), and was inaugurated on January 20, 2002 in [[Memphis|Memphis, Tennessee]] on the balcony of the [[National Civil Rights Museum|Lorraine Motel]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Baird | first = Woody | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Churches Unite to Fight Racism | newspaper = Lakeland Ledger | pages = D5 | date = 26 January 2002  | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&dat=20020126&id=NsxOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ov0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4833,2076988 | archiveurl = | archivedate = | accessdate = 14 August 2012}}</ref> It is the successor organization to the '''[[Consultation on Church Union]]'''.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
CUIC is the successor organization to the '''[[Consultation on Church Union]]''' (COCU), which had been founded in 1962. The original task of COCU was to negotiate a consensus<ref>While the term "merger" is widely used to describe the set of COCU proposals, it was rejected in general because of its relation to corporate culture. {{Citation| last1 = Moede | first1 = Gerald | title = The COCU Consensus| publisher = The Consultation on Church Union| place = Baltimore, MD| volume = | edition = | year = 1985 | page=vii}}</ref> between its nine (originally four) member communions (it also included three "advisory participant" churches).<ref>{{Citation| last1 = | first1 =| title = Churches in Covenant Communion| publisher = The Consultation on Church Union| place = Princeton, NJ| volume = | edition = | year = 1989}}</ref> However, it never succeeded in this goal, despite making progress on several ecumenical fronts.<ref>{{Citation| last1 = Moede | first1 = Gerald | title = The COCU Consensus| publisher = The Consultation on Church Union| place = Baltimore, MD| volume = | edition = | year = 1985 | page=1}}</ref> At COCU's 18th plenary meeting in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] (January 1999), CUIC was proposed as a new relationship among the nine member communions.<ref>{{Citation| last1 = | first1 =| title = Signs of Hope - Promise of Change| publisher = Forward Movement Publications| place = Cincinnati, OH| volume = | edition = | year = 2002}}</ref> Each member communion voted to join CUIC over the next few years.

=== Inauguration ===
Heads of communion from each member of COCU (as well as the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|ELCA]], a partner in mission and dialogue) inaugurated the group on the day before [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]] in 2002 at the motel where he was killed.<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = ELCA Presiding Bishop Joins CUIC Leaders in MLK Statement | work = | pages = | publisher = ELCA NEWS SERVICE | date = 10 January 2007 | url = http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Communication-Services/News/Releases.aspx?a=3506| format = | doi = | accessdate = 15 August 2012}}</ref> This particular location highlighted the group's focus on [[racism]] as a major dividing factor between and among churches.

=== Task Forces ===
The Coordinating Council of CUIC created three task forces: Ministry, Racial Justice, and Local and Regional Ecumenism. Each task force represented an important part of early CUIC work.<ref>{{cite web | last = Solheim | first = Hames | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Churches Uniting in Christ 'finding momentum' | work = | pages = | publisher =  | date = November 18, 2003| url = http://archive.wfn.org/2003/11/msg00170.html | doi = | accessdate = 20 September 2012}}</ref>  Local ecumenical liturgies were encouraged, and excitement initially built around "pilot programs" in Denver, Los Angeles, and Memphis. The Racial Justice task force created gatherings and discussions on racial justice. The Ministry task force received much of the attention from church structures, however. The group had been given a mandate to complete work on reconciliation by 2007, and in 2003 began working on a document entitled "Mutual Recognition and Mutual Reconciliation of Ministries."<ref>{{cite journal | last = | first = | title = Recommendation to the churches for a new relationship, Churches Uniting in Christ | journal = Mid-Stream| volume = 39 | issue = 1-2 | pages = xiii | publisher =  | location = | date = January 2000 | url = | issn = 0544-0653 | accessdate = 22 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Lampman | first = Jane | title = In largest unity movement ever, churches blur denominational lines | journal = Christian Science Monitor| volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher =  | location = | date = 3 January 2002 | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0103/p12s2-lire.html | issn = | accessdate = 9 September 2012}}</ref>

=== Mutual Recognition and Mutual Reconciliation of Ministries (MRMRM) ===
One of the most difficult issues concerning recognition and reconciliation of ministries was that of the historic episcopate. This was one of the issues that defeated proposals for union by COCU as well. The group approached this problem through dialogue, soliciting information from each member communion on the particularities of their theology and ecclesiology in order to come to a mutually acceptable conclusion.

CUIC released the seventh and final draft of the MRMRM document in June 2005.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Rosner| first = Patrice| title = A Deepening Dialogue | journal = Call to Unity| issue = 7 | pages = 1–2 | publisher =  | location = | date = December 2006 | url = | issn = | accessdate = 8 September 2012}}</ref>  Much work was done in 2006 on this document, which focused on "Episkope," the oversight of ministry. The work culminated in a consultation on episkope in St. Louis in October 2006 involving the heads of communion of the members of CUIC. At this consultation, the MRMRM document was met with resistance, and concern was raised in particular that CUIC was focusing too narrowly on reconciliation of ministries and "not taking seriously our commitment to working on those issues of systemic racism that remain at the heart of our continuing and separated life as churches here in the United States."<ref>{{cite web | last = Welsh | first = Robert | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = CUIC and the Dance of Ecumenism | work = | pages = | publisher =  | date = November 2006 | url = http://www.disciples.org/ccu/fromthepresident/past/2006November.html | doi = | accessdate = 15 August 2012}}</ref>

=== Moravian Church (Northern Province) ===
The nine churches which inaugurated CUIC in 2002 were joined by the [[Moravian Church in North America|Moravian Church, Northern Province]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Welsh | first = Robert | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = CUIC and the Dance of Ecumenism | work = | pages = | publisher =  | date = November 2006 | url = http://www.disciples.org/ccu/fromthepresident/past/2006November.html | doi = | accessdate = 15 August 2012}}</ref> The Moravians had been partners in mission and dialogue since 2002, but joined as a member communion after the October 2006 consultation on Episkope.

=== Suspension of Activities ===
In 2007, the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]] and the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] withdrew from CUIC.<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Ecumenical Group Limps as Two Churches Cut Ties | work = | pages = | publisher = The Christian Century | date = 1 July 2008 | url = http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2008-07/ecumenical-group-limps-two-churches-cut-ties | format = | doi = | accessdate = 12 August 2012}}</ref> Neither body sent representatives to the CUIC plenary on January 11–14, 2008, though the AME Council of Bishops never voted to suspend membership officially.<ref>{{cite web | last = Webb| first = Suzanne| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Letter from the President of CUIC | work = | pages = | publisher = United Methodist News Service | year = 2008 | url = http://eif-pcusa.org/EcumenicalRelations/documents/cuicstatusltr.pdf | format = | doi = | accessdate = 28 August 2012}}</ref> They felt the other churches were not doing enough to counter the history of racial injustice between black and white churches. In response to this, the remaining churches in CUIC decided in 2008 to suspend their work while they seek reconciliation with these churches.<ref>{{cite web | last = Bloom | first = Linda | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Churches Uniting in Christ Seeks Reconciliation | work = | pages = | publisher = United Methodist News Service | date = 18 January 2008 | url = http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&b=6245761&ct=4960311 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 15 August 2012}}</ref> This work began with a group of representatives who revisited the 1999 document "Call to Christian Commitment and Action to Combat Racism," which is available on the current CUIC website.<ref>http://www.churchesunitinginchrist.org/what-you-can-do/combating-racism/20-call-to-combat-racism-cocu</ref> This also meant eliminating the position of Director as well as the suspension of the work of the CUIC task forces.<ref>{{cite web | last = Webb| first = Suzanne| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Letter from the President of CUIC | work = | pages = | publisher = United Methodist News Service | year = 2008 | url = http://eif-pcusa.org/EcumenicalRelations/documents/cuicstatusltr.pdf | format = | doi = | accessdate = 28 August 2012}}</ref> As of 2012, CUIC no longer has physical offices, opting instead for a [[virtual office]] and storing the archives of both CUIC and COCU at Princeton Seminary's Henry Luce III Library.<ref>http://www.ptsem.edu/library/collections/special/archives/</ref>

=== Reconciliation Efforts ===
The [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] resumed its participation by the February 2010 plenary meeting, where CUIC moved to refocus on its eight marks of commitment and a shared concern for racial justice as a major dividing factor facing ecumenism. Although the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]] has not rejoined the group, efforts have continued to bring this communion back into membership. The Rev. Staccato Powell, an AMEZ pastor, preached at the 2011 CUIC plenary in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida as a part of these reconciliation efforts.<ref>{{cite web | last = Bowman Woods | first = Rebecca | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Churches Uniting in Christ takes a major step forward | work = | pages = | publisher = | date = 28 January 2011 | url = http://churchesunitinginchrist.org/images/files/2011January-CUICWrapupPlenary.pdf | format = | doi = | accessdate = 28 August 2012}}</ref> Combating racism has again become a priority of CUIC. Concerns over the historic episcopate have been sidelined since 2008, though they may re-emerge. The group's focus on mutual reconciliation of ministries has been revisited in the light of racism and the impact that racism may have on exchanging ministers between denominations. Therefore, the coordinating council of CUIC created a consultation on race and ministry while also choosing to partner with the Samuel Dewitt Proctor Conference, a social justice organization involved in African American faith communities.<ref>{{cite web | last = Becker | first = Alex | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = CUIC Connects with the Samuel DeWitt Proctor Conference | work = | pages = | publisher = | date = | url = http://churchesunitinginchrist.org/news/51-cuic-connects-with-the-samuel-dewitt-proctor-conference | format = | doi = | accessdate = 12 August 2012}}</ref>

==Purpose==
The purpose of CUIC has always been unity (as reflected in their current slogan, "reconciling the baptized, seeking unity with justice"). This reflects one of the core scripture passages in the ecumenical movement, Jesus' prayer in John 17:21, "[[That they all may be one]]". CUIC has approached this goal of unity in various ways throughout its history.

===Racism===
Racism has been a primary focus of CUIC since 2002 (and, indeed, a primary focus of COCU alongside other forms of exclusion and prejudice, such as [[sexism]] and [[ableism]]).<ref>{{cite journal | last = Moede | first = Gerald | title = COCU 101 | journal = Mid-Stream | volume =  | issue =  | pages = 76 | publisher =  | location = | date = Jan 2000 | url = | issn =  | accessdate = 22 August 2012}}</ref> According to Dan Krutz, former president of CUIC, "Overcoming racism has been a focal point of CUIC since its beginning... Racism may be the biggest sin that divides churches."<ref>{{cite web | last = Hagan | first = Janine | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = An Interview with the Rev. C Dana "Dan" Krutz" | work = | pages = | publisher = | date = January 2007 | url = http://www.lainterchurch.org/contact/ecumininet-article_on_fr_dan-flash.swf | format = | doi = | accessdate = 28 August 2012}}</ref> Even before the absence of the AME and AMEZ churches at the January 2011 plenary, some in CUIC had noticed the lack of commitment to racial reconciliation.<ref>{{cite web | last = Welsh | first = Robert | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = CUIC and the Dance of Ecumenism | work = | pages = | publisher =  | date = November 2006 | url = http://www.disciples.org/ccu/fromthepresident/past/2006November.html | doi = | accessdate = 8 September 2012}}</ref> Since 2008, however, racism has become an even more pressing concern.<ref>{{cite web | last = Bowman Woods | first = Rebecca | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Churches Uniting in Christ members recommit to ecumenical tasks | work = | pages = | publisher = | date = 21 January 2011 | url = http://www.ucc.org/news/churches-uniting-in-christ.html | doi = | accessdate = 12 August 2012}}</ref> This has led CUIC to address issues of racism in the public sphere, including the killing of [[Trayvon Martin]]<ref>{{cite web | last = Banks | first = Adelle | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = After Trayvon Martin Case, Churches Say ‘Stereotypes Cost Lives’ | work = | pages = | publisher = The Washington Post | date = 30 March 2012 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/after-trayvon-martin-case-churches-say-stereotypes-cost-lives/2012/03/30/gIQAEVTWlS_story.html | doi = | accessdate = 12 August 2012}}</ref> and the recovery from the [[2010 Haiti Earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Georgia Thompson | first = Karen | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Committee on Ecumenical and Interfaith Relations 28th General Synod Report | work = | pages = | publisher = | date = April 2011 | url = http://www.ucc.org/synod/pdfs/REPORT-From-the-Committee-on-Ecumenical-and-Interfaith-Relations.pdf | format = | doi = | accessdate = 12 August 2012}}</ref>

===Marks of Commitment===
According to their website, one of the reasons for transitioning from COCU to CUIC is so that member churches "stop 'consulting' and start living their unity in Christ more fully."<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Marks of Churches Uniting In Christ Participation | work = | pages = | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.churchesunitinginchrist.org/what-you-can-do/resources/19-marks-of-churches-uniting-in-christ-participation | format = | doi = | accessdate = 12 August 2012}}</ref> This means that each member communion in CUIC agrees to abide by the eight Marks of Commitment, which are summarized as follows:<ref>http://www.churchesunitinginchrist.org/</ref>
*Receive each other as Christ's church
*Mutually recognize baptisms & members
*Affirm apostolic creeds
*Celebrate Eucharist together
*Engage in mission & anti-racism
