{{infobox cadmium}}

'''Cadmium''' is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Cd''' and [[atomic number]] 48. This soft, bluish-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in [[group 12 element|group 12]], [[zinc]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Like zinc, it prefers [[oxidation state]] +2 in most of its compounds and like mercury it shows a low melting point compared to [[transition metal]]s. Cadmium and its [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]] are not always considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in the Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by [[Friedrich Stromeyer|Stromeyer]] and [[Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann|Hermann]], both in Germany, as an impurity in [[zinc carbonate]].

Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and therefore is a byproduct of zinc production. It was used for a long time as a [[pigment]] and for corrosion resistant plating on [[steel]] while cadmium compounds were used to stabilize [[plastic]]. The use of cadmium is generally decreasing due to its [[toxicity]] (it is specifically listed in the European [[ROHS|Restriction of Hazardous Substances]] <ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book

Although cadmium has no known biological function in higher organisms, a cadmium-dependent [[carbonic anhydrase]] has been found in marine [[diatom]]s.

{{Main|Isotopes of cadmium}}
Naturally occurring cadmium is composed of 8 [[isotope]]s. Two of them are [[radionuclide|naturally radioactive]], and three are expected to [[radioactive decay|decay]] but have not been experimentally confirmed to do so. The two natural radioactive isotopes are <sup>113</sup>Cd ([[beta decay]], half-life is 7.7 × 10<sup>15</sup> years) and <sup>116</sup>Cd (two-neutrino [[double beta decay]], half-life is 2.9 × 10<sup>19</sup> years). The other three are <sup>106</sup>Cd, <sup>108</sup>Cd (both [[double electron capture]]), and <sup>114</sup>Cd (double beta decay); only lower limits on their half-life times have been set. At least three isotopes&nbsp;– <sup>110</sup>Cd, <sup>111</sup>Cd, and <sup>112</sup>Cd&nbsp;– are stable. Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally, the most long-lived are <sup>109</sup>Cd with a half-life of 462.6 days, and <sup>115</sup>Cd with a half-life of 53.46 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 2.5 hours, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 5 minutes. Cadmium has 8 known [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being <sup>113m</sup>Cd (t<sub>½</sub> = 14.1 years), <sup>115m</sup>Cd (t<sub>½</sub> = 44.6 days), and <sup>117m</sup>Cd (t<sub>½</sub> = 3.36 hours).<ref name="NUBASE">

The known isotopes of cadmium range in [[atomic mass]] from 94.950 [[atomic mass unit|u]] (<sup>95</sup>Cd) to 131.946 u (<sup>132</sup>Cd). For isotopes lighter than 112 u, the primary [[decay mode]] is [[electron capture]] and the dominant [[decay product]] is element 47 ([[silver]]). Heavier isotopes decay mostly through [[beta emission]] producing element 49 ([[indium]]).<ref name="NUBASE"/>

One isotope of cadmium, <sup>113</sup>Cd, absorbs neutrons with very high probability if they have an energy below the ''cadmium cut-off'' and transmits them otherwise. The cadmium cut-off is about 0.5 eV. Neutrons with energy below the cut-off are deemed slow neutrons, distinguishing them from intermediate and fast neutrons.<ref>

Cadmium ([[Latin]] ''cadmia'', [[Greek language|Greek]] ''καδμεία'' meaning "[[calamine]]", a cadmium-bearing mixture of minerals, which was named after the Greek mythological character, Κάδμος [[Cadmus]], the founder of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]]) was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] simultaneously in 1817 by [[Friedrich Stromeyer]]<ref>

The metal was named after the Latin word for calamine, since the metal was found in this zinc compound. Stromeyer noted that some impure samples of calamine changed color when heated but pure calamine did not. He was persistent in studying these results and eventually isolated cadmium metal by [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] and reduction of the [[cadmium sulfide|sulfide]]. The possibility to use cadmium yellow as pigment was recognized in the 1840s but the lack of cadmium limited this application.<ref>

In paint pigments, cadmium forms various [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]], with CdS being the most common. This sulfide is used as a [[Cadmium pigments|yellow pigment]]. [[Cadmium selenide]] can be used as red pigment, commonly called ''cadmium red''. To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium yellows, oranges, and reds are the most brilliant and long-lasting colors to use. In fact, during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders, or blended into [[watercolor]]s, [[gouache]]s, [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]], and other paint and pigment formulations. Since these pigments are potentially toxic, it is recommended to use a [[barrier cream]] on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin when working with them<ref name="colors">{{cite book|chapter = Cadmium Pigments|url = http://books.google.com/?id=_OrB0ew_HgAC&pg=PA121|pages = 121–123|isbn = 978-3-527-30363-2|publisher = Wiley-VCH|year = 2005|title =Industrial inorganic pigments|first1 = Gunter|last1 = Buxbaum|first2 = Gerhard|last2 = Pfaff}}</ref> even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is usually reported to be less than 1%.<ref name = "ATSDR"/>

In [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], cadmium was used as heat, light, and weathering stabilizers.<ref name="HgCdPb"/><ref>{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=YUkJNI9QYsUC&pg=PA149|page = 149|first = Thomas C.|last = Jennings|isbn = 978-1-56990-379-7| publisher = Hanser Verlag|year = 2005|title = PVC handbook|chapter = Cadmium Environmental Concerns}}</ref> Currently, cadmium stabilizers have been completely replaced with barium-zinc, calcium-zinc and organo-tin stabilizers. Cadmium is used in many kinds of [[solder]] and bearing alloys, due to a low [[coefficient of friction]] and fatigue resistance.<ref name="HgCdPb"/> It is also found in some of the lowest-melting [[alloy]]s, such as [[Wood's metal]].<ref>{{cite book|first1= George Stuart|last1= Brady|first2= George S.|last2= Brady|first3= Henry R.|last3= Clauser|first4 = John A.|last4 = Vaccari|isbn = 978-0-07-136076-0|url = http://books.google.com/?id=vIhvSQLhhMEC&pg=PA425|title = Materials handbook: an encyclopedia for managers, technical professionals, purchasing and production managers, technicians, and supervisors|publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional|year = 2002| page = 425}}</ref>

===Laboratory uses===
[[File:HeCd laser.jpg|thumb|Violet light from a [[helium]] cadmium metal vapor [[laser]]. The highly [[monochromatic]] color arises from the 441.563 nm transition [[spectral line|line]] of cadmium.]]
Helium–cadmium lasers are a common source of blue-ultraviolet laser light. They operate at either 325 or 422&nbsp;nm and are used in [[fluorescence microscope]]s and various laboratory experiments.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.olympusfluoview.com/java/hecdlasers/index.html|title = Helium-Cadmium Lasers| publisher = Olympus|accessdate =May 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=JxASQpi0LXoC&pg=PA488| chapter = Helium-cadmium Laser|title = Lasers:Principles, Types and Applications|isbn = 978-81-224-1492-9|author1 = Nambiar, K.R|date = January 1, 2006}}</ref> Cadmium selenide [[quantum dot]]s emit bright [[luminescence]] under UV excitation (He-Cd laser, for example). The color of this luminescence can be green, yellow or red depending on the particle size.

Cadmium is a component of some compound [[semiconductor]]s, such as cadmium sulfide, cadmium selenide, and [[cadmium telluride]], which can be used for light detection or [[solar cell]]s. [[HgCdTe]] is sensitive to [[infrared]]<ref name="HgCdPb"/> light and therefore may be utilized as an infrared detector or switch for example in remote control devices.

In molecular biology, cadmium is used to block voltage-dependent calcium channels from fluxing calcium ions, as well as in [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] research to stimulate [[proteasome]]-dependent degradation of [[Hypoxia-inducible factors|Hif-1α]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal = European Journal of Biochemistry|volume = 267|issue = 13|pages = 4198–4204|year = 2000|doi = 10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01453.x|title = Cadmium blocks hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1-mediated response to hypoxia by stimulating the proteasome-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha|first = Chun Y.

The most dangerous form of occupational exposure to cadmium is inhalation of fine dust and fumes, or ingestion of highly soluble cadmium compounds.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Inhalation of cadmium-containing fumes can result initially in [[metal fume fever]] but may progress to chemical [[pneumonitis]], [[pulmonary edema]], and death.<ref>{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=vgHXTId8rnYC&dq|title = Principles and Methods of Toxicology|first = Andrew Wallace|last = Hayes|publisher = CRC Press|place = Philadelphia|year = 2007|pages = 858–861|isbn=978-0-8493-3778-9}}</ref>

Cadmium is also an environmental hazard. Human exposures to environmental cadmium are primarily the result of fossil fuel combustion, phosphate fertilizers, natural sources, iron and steel production, cement production and related activities, nonferrous metals production, and municipal solid waste incineration.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Bread, root crops, and vegetables also contribute to the cadmium in modern populations.<ref name="news.yahoo.com">http://news.yahoo.com/heavy-metal-foods-cosmetics-spur-breast-cancer-spread-200608223.html</ref> There have been a few instances of general population toxicity as the result of long-term exposure to cadmium in contaminated food and water, and research is ongoing regarding the estrogen mimicry that may induce breast cancer.<ref name="news.yahoo.com"/> In the decades leading up to [[World War II]], mining operations contaminated the [[Jinzū River]] in Japan with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals. As a consequence, cadmium accumulated in the rice crops growing along the riverbanks downstream of the mines. Some members of the local agricultural communities consuming the contaminated rice developed [[itai-itai]] disease and renal abnormalities, including [[proteinuria]] and [[glucosuria]].<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/n0773057mw738u05/|title = Environmental cadmium exposure, adverse effects, and preventative measures in Japan|first = Koji|last = Nogawa|journal = Biometals|year = 2004|volume = 17|issue = 5|pages =581–587|doi = 10.1023/B:BIOM.0000045742.81440.9c|pmid = 15688869|last2 = Kobayashi|first2 = E|last3 = Okubo|first3 = Y|last4 = Suwazono|first4 = Y}}</ref>

The victims of this poisoning were almost exclusively post-menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores. Similar general population cadmium exposures in other parts of the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, while cadmium is a major factor in the itai-itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Cadmium is one of six substances banned by the European Union's [[ROHS|Restriction on Hazardous Substances]] (RoHS) directive, which bans certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law.<ref>{{cite web |title=European Commission Decision of 12 October 2006 amending, for the purposes of adapting to technical progress, the Annex to Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards exemptions for applications of lead and cadmium (notified under document number C(2006) 4790) |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:283:0048:0049:EN:PDF}}</ref>

Although some studies linked exposure to cadmium with lung and prostate cancer, there is still a substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium. More recent studies suggest that arsenic rather than cadmium may lead to the increased lung cancer mortality rates. Furthermore, most data regarding the carcinogenicity of cadmium rely on research confounded by the presence of other carcinogenic substances.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Tobacco smoking is the most important single source of cadmium exposure in the general population. It has been estimated that about 10% of the cadmium content of a cigarette is inhaled through smoking. The absorption of cadmium from the lungs is much more effective than that from the gut, and as much as 50% of the cadmium inhaled via cigarette smoke may be absorbed.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1146/annurev.pu.04.050183.002055|journal = Annual Review of Public Health|volume = 4|pmid = 6860444|pages = 367–367|year = 1983|title = Cadmium|first = L.|last = Friberg}}</ref>

On average, smokers have 4–5 times higher blood cadmium concentrations and 2–3 times higher kidney cadmium concentrations than non-smokers. Despite the high cadmium content in cigarette smoke, there seems to be little exposure to cadmium from [[passive smoking]]. No significant effect on blood cadmium concentrations has been detected in children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke.<ref>{{cite journal|journal = Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment and Health|volume = 24|pages = 11–51|year = 1998|title = Health effects of cadmium exposure—a review of the literature and a risk estimate|first = L.|last = Jarup}}</ref>

Cadmium exposure is a risk factor associated with early atherosclerosis and hypertension, which can both lead to cardiovascular disease.<ref>[http://www.medinewsdirect.com/?p=704 Cadmium Exposure can Induce Early Atherosclerotic Changes], Medinews Direct, 7 September 2009</ref>

Due to the adverse effects on the environment and human health, the supply and use of cadmium is restricted in Europe under the [[REACH Regulation]].<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/index.htm EUR-Lex]. Eur-lex.europa.eu (April 18, 2011). Retrieved on June 5, 2011.</ref>
