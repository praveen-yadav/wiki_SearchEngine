'''Amanda Hesser''' (born 1971) is an American food writer, editor, cookbook author and entrepreneur. Most notably, she was the food editor of ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', the editor of ''[[T Living]]'', a quarterly publication of ''[[The New York Times]]'', author of The Essential New York Times Cookbook which was a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' bestseller, and co-founder and CEO of [[Food52]].

After finishing her first book, in 1997, Hesser was hired as a food reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]'' where she wrote more than 750 stories. While at the ''Times'' Hesser wrote about the influence of [[Costco]] on the wine industry, uncovered the politics behind the New York City Greenmarket and was among the first to write about [[Ferran Adria]] of [[El Bulli]] in a major American publication.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hesser|first=Amanda|title=In Spain, A Chef To Rival Dali|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/15/dining/in-spain-a-chef-to-rival-dali.html#|accessdate=November 22, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 15, 1999}}</ref> 

Hesser was involved in two cases of conflict of interest while working at the ''Times''. In 2004, she awarded the restaurant Spice Market a three-star rating without disclosing that the year before, the restaurant’s owner, Jean-Georges Vongericthen, had provided a complimentary jacket blurb for her book ''Cooking for Mr. Latte''. In 2007, Hesser published a favorable review of ''Vegetable Harvest'' by Patricia Wells, without noting that in 1999, Wells had provided a jacket blurb for Hesser’s book ''The Cook and the Gardener''. In both cases, the ''Times'' subsequently pointed out the conflicts of interest with editors’ notes.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/books/review/Hesser-t.html?pagewanted=print&_r=0</ref><ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/31/nyregion/editors-note-editors-note-014850.html</ref>

While Hesser left the ''[[The New York Times|Times]]'' in March 2008 to focus on the development of [[Food52]] she continued to write the "Recipe Redux" feature for the ''Times'' magazine until February 27, 2011.<ref>{{citation | title = Amanda Hesser Blows Her Own Internet Bubble | date = 3 April 2008 | publisher = [[New York Magazine]] | url = http://nymag.com/daily/food/2008/04/amanda_hesser_out_at_the_times.html}}</ref><ref>{{citation | title = Amanda Hesser Sets Us Straight About Her Plans for the Future | date = 7 April 2008 | url = http://nymag.com/daily/food/2008/04/amanda_hesser_sets_us_straight.html | publisher = [[New York Magazine]]}}</ref>

As co-founder and CEO of [[Food52]] she has raised two rounds of investment from parties including [[Lerer Ventures]] and [[Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments]]. [[Food52]] has won numerous notable awards including the [[James Beard Foundation Award|James Beard Award]] for Publication of the Year (2012)<ref>{{citation | title = James Beard Foundation 2012 Award Winners | url = http://www.jamesbeard.org/awards/search/food52}}</ref> and the [[International Association of Culinary Professionals|IACP Award]] for Best Website (2013).
