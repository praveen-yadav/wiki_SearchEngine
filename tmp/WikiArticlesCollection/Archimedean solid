[[File:Small rhombicosidodecahedron.png|thumb|The [[rhombicosidodecahedron]], one of the Archimedean solids]]
In [[geometry]] an '''Archimedean solid''' is  a highly symmetric, semi-regular [[Convex polyhedron|convex]] [[polyhedron]] composed of two or more types of [[regular polygon]]s meeting in identical [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]]. They are distinct from the [[Platonic solid]]s, which are composed of only one type of polygon meeting in identical vertices, and from the [[Johnson solid]]s, whose regular polygonal faces do not meet in identical vertices.

"Identical vertices" are usually taken to mean that for any two vertices, there must be an [[isometry]] of the entire solid that takes one vertex to the other. Sometimes it is instead only required that the faces that meet at one vertex are related isometrically to the faces that meet at the other. This difference in definitions controls whether the [[Elongated square gyrobicupola]] is considered an Archimedean solid or a [[Johnson solid]].

[[Prism (geometry)|Prisms]] and [[antiprism]]s, whose [[symmetry group]]s are the [[dihedral group]]s, are generally not considered to be Archimedean solids, despite meeting the above definition. With this restriction, there are only finitely many Archimedean solids. They can all be made via [[Wythoff construction]]s from the [[Platonic solids]] with [[Tetrahedral symmetry|tetrahedral]], [[Octahedral symmetry|octahedral]] and [[icosahedral symmetry]].

==Origin of name==
The Archimedean solids take their name from [[Archimedes]], who discussed them in a now-lost work. During the [[Renaissance]], [[artist]]s and [[mathematician]]s valued ''pure forms'' and rediscovered all of these forms. This search was completed around 1620 by [[Johannes Kepler]],<ref>Field J., Rediscovering the Archimedean Polyhedra: Piero della Francesca, Luca Pacioli, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, Daniele Barbaro, and Johannes Kepler,	''Archive for History of Exact Sciences'', '''50''', 1997, 227</ref> who defined [[prism (geometry)|prisms]], [[antiprisms]], and the non-convex solids known as the [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]].

==Classification==
There are 13 Archimedean solids (15 if the [[mirror image]]s of two [[chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorphs]], see below, are counted separately).

Here the ''vertex configuration'' refers to the type of regular polygons that meet at any given vertex. For example, a [[vertex configuration]] of (4,6,8) means that a [[Square (geometry)|square]], [[hexagon]], and [[octagon]] meet at a vertex (with the order taken to be clockwise around the vertex).

Some definitions of [[semiregular polyhedron]] include one more figure, the [[elongated square gyrobicupola]] or "pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron".<ref>{{harvtxt|Malkevitch|1988}}, p.&nbsp;85</ref>

== Properties ==

The number of vertices is 720° divided by the vertex [[Defect (geometry)|angle defect]].

The cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron are [[edge-uniform]] and are called [[quasiregular polyhedron|quasi-regular]].

The [[dual polyhedron|duals]] of the Archimedean solids are called the [[Catalan solid]]s.  Together with the [[bipyramid]]s and [[trapezohedron|trapezohedra]], these are the [[face-uniform]] solids with regular vertices.

=== Chirality ===

The snub cube and snub dodecahedron are known as ''[[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]]'', as they come in a left-handed (Latin: levomorph or laevomorph) form and right-handed (Latin: dextromorph) form. When something comes in multiple forms which are each other's three-dimensional [[mirror image]], these forms may be called enantiomorphs.  (This nomenclature is also used for the forms of certain [[chemical compound]]s).
