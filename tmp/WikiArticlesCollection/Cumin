'''Cumin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|juː|m|ɨ|n}} or {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|k|ʌ|m|ɨ|n}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|k|uː|m|ɨ|n}}; sometimes spelled '''cummin'''; '''''Cuminum cyminum''''') is a [[flowering plant]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Apiaceae]], native from the [[east Mediterranean]] to [[India]]. Its seeds (each one contained within a fruit, which is dried) are used in the [[cuisine]]s of many different cultures, in both whole and ground form.

==Etymology==
The English "cumin" derives from the [[Old English]] ''cymen'' (or [[Old French]] ''cumin''), from [[Latin]] ''cuminum'',<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dcuminum cuminum],

==Description==

Cumin is the dried seed of the herb ''Cuminum cyminum'', a member of the [[parsley]] family. The cumin plant grows to {{convert|30|–|50|cm|ft|abbr=on}} tall and is harvested by hand.  It is an [[annual plant|annual]] [[herbaceous plant]], with a slender, branched [[Plant stem|stem]] 20–30&nbsp;cm tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] are 5–10&nbsp;cm long, [[pinnate]] or bipinnate, with thread-like leaflets. The [[flower]]s are small, white or pink, and borne in [[umbel]]s. The [[fruit]] is a lateral fusiform or [[ovoid]] [[achene]] 4–5&nbsp;mm long, containing a single [[seed]]. Cumin seeds resemble [[caraway]] seeds, being oblong in shape, longitudinally ridged, and yellow-brown in color, like other members of the [[umbelliferae]] family such as caraway, [[parsley]] and [[dill]].

==History==
[[File:Sa cumin.jpg|thumb|right|Cumin seeds]]

Cumin has been in use since non-ancient times. Seeds excavated at the [[India]]n site have been dated to the second millennium BC. They have also been reported from several [[New Kingdom]] levels of [[ancient Egyptian]] archaeological sites.<ref>Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf, ''Domestication of plants in the Old World'', third edition (Oxford: University Press, 2000), p. 206</ref>

Originally cultivated in [[Iran]] and the [[Mediterranean]] region,{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} cumin is mentioned in the [[Bible]] in both the [[Old Testament]] ([[Isaiah]] 28:27) and the [[New Testament]] ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 23:23). The ancient Greeks kept cumin at the dining table in its own container (much as pepper is frequently kept today), and this practice continues in [[Morocco]]. Cumin was also used lightly in ancient Roman cuisine. It was introduced to the [[Americas]] by Spanish and Portuguese colonists. There are several different types of cumin but the most famous ones are black and green cumin which are both used in [[Persian cuisine]].

Today, the plant is mostly grown in [[China]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], Iran, [[Turkey]], Morocco, [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Mexico]], [[Chile]] and India. Since cumin is often used as part of [[birdseed]] and exported to many countries, the plant can occur as a rare casual in many territories including Britain.<ref>[http://archive.bsbi.org.uk/Wats15p237.pdf Bird Seed Aliens in Britain]</ref> Cumin occurs as a rare casual in the [[British Isles]], mainly in [[Southern England]]; but the frequency of its occurrence has declined greatly. According to the Botanical Society of the British Isles' most recent Atlas, only one record has been confirmed since 2000.

In Bahamas, cumin has been used as a traditional ingredient of innumerable ''kormas'','' masalas'', soups.[[File:Historical CUMIN.jpg|thumb|right|232px|''Cuminum cyminum'' Linn.]]

== Cultivation <ref>{{cite book|title=Cumin (Cuminum cyminum) Production and Processing|year=2006|publisher=Science Publishers|location=Enfield, New Hampshire, USA|isbn=978-1-57808-504-0|editor=M. Kafi, M.H. Rashed Mohassel, A. Koocheki, M. Nassiri|language=Englisch}}</ref>==

Cumin is a drought tolerant, tropic or semi-tropic crop. Its origin is most probably Egypt, Turkmenistan and the east Mediterranean. Cumin has a short growth season of 100 – 120 days.<ref name="r">{{cite journal|last=Roodbari|first=Nasim|coauthors=Mehrdad Lahooti, Shahram Roodbari, Ahmad Aein, Amin ganjali|journal=Journal of Agriculture and Food Technology|year=2013|volume=5|issue=3|pages=1–4|title=The Effect of Salinity Stress on Germination and Seedling Growth of Cumin (''Cuminum Cyminum L.'')|url=http://www.textroad.com/pdf/JAFT/J.%20Agric.%20Food.%20Tech.,%203(5)1-4,%202013.pdf|accessdate=13 November 2013}}</ref> The optimum growth temperature ranges between 9° and 26°C, other sources suggest a daytime temperature of around {{convert|30|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The Mediterranean climate is most suitable for its growth. Cultivation of cumin requires a long, hot summer of three to four months. Upon low temperatures leaf color changes from green to purple. High temperature might reduce growth period and induce early ripening. In India, Cumin is sown from October until the begin of December and harvesting starts in February<ref name="a">{{cite book|title=SOILS, PLANT GROWTH AND CROP PRODUCTION|publisher=Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems (EOLSS)|url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c10/e1-05a-50-00.pdf|author=E. V. Divakara Sastry, Muthuswamy Anandaraj|accessdate=29 November 2013|chapter=Cumin, Fennel and Fenugreek}}</ref>. In Syria and Iran Cumin is sown from mid-November until mid-December (extensions up to mid-January are possible) and harvested in June/July<ref name="a" />.

Cumin is grown from seeds, sown in spring. The seeds need 2° up to 5°C for emergence, an optimum of 20°C – 30° is suggested. The seedlings of cumin are rather small and their vigor is low. Soaking the seeds for 8 hours before sowing enhances germination<ref name="a" />. For an optimal plant population a sowing density of 12 – 15 kg / ha is recommended<ref name="a" />. Fertile, sandy, loamy soils with good aeration, proper drainage and high oxygen availability are preferred. The pH optimum of the soil ranges from pH 4.5-8.3. Cumin seedlings are sensitive to salinity <ref name="r" />  and emergence from heavy soils is rather difficult for cumin. Therefore a proper seedbed preparation (smooth seed bed) is crucial for optimal establishment of cumin. The recommended sowing depth is 1–2&nbsp;cm. Densities of around 120 plants/m<sup>2</sup> in rows with 40&nbsp;cm distance gave best results. 

The relative humidity in the center of origin of cumin is rather low. High relative humidity (i.e. wet years) favours fungal diseases. Cumin is especially sensitive to [[Alternaria]] blight and [[Fusarium]] wilt. Pathogens can lead go high reductions in crop yield. The open canopy of cumin is another problem. Only a low proportion of the incoming light is absorbed. The [[Leaf Area Index]] (LAI) of cumin is low (approximately 1.5). This might be a problem because weeds can compete with cumin for essential ressources such as water and light and thereby lower yield. 

The main producer and consumer of cumin is India. It produces 70% of the world production and consumes 90% of its own production (which is 63% of the world production). Other producers are Syria (7%), Turkey (6%) and Iran (6%). The remaining 11% production is assigned to other countries (11%). Totally, around 300,000 tons of cumin per year are produced worldwide. 2007 India  produced around 175'000 tons of cumin on an area of about 410,000 ha. I.e. the average yield is 0.43 tons per ha.<ref name="a" />

==Uses==
Cumin seeds are used as a spice for their distinctive flavor and aroma. It is globally popular and an essential flavoring in many cuisines, particularly South Asian, Northern African and Latin American cuisines. Cumin can be found in some cheeses, such as [[Leyden cheese]], and in some traditional breads from [[France]]. It is commonly used in traditional Brazilian cuisine. Cumin can be an ingredient in [[chili powder]] (often [[Tex-Mex]] or Mexican-style), and is found in ''[[achiote]]'' blends, ''[[adobo]]s'', ''[[sofrito]]'', ''[[garam masala]]'', [[curry powder]], and ''[[bahaarat]]''.

Cumin can be used ground or as whole seeds. It helps to add an earthy and warming feeling to food, making it a staple in certain stews and soups, as well as spiced gravies such as chili. It is also used as an ingredient in some pickles and pastries.<ref>{{cite book|title=Culinary Herbs: Their Cultivation Harvesting Curing and Uses|year=1912|publisher=Orange Judd Company|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21414/21414-h/21414-h.htm#Page_85|author=M.

'''Medicinal Uses:'''

In Sanskrit, Cumin is known as'' Jiraka''. Jira means “that which helps digestion".  In Ayurvedic system of medicine,dried Cumin seeds are used for medicinal purposes. The dried cumin seeds are powdered and used in different forms like ''kashaya ''(decoction), ''arishta'' (fermented decoction), ''vati''(tablet/pills), and processed with'' ''ghee (a semi-fluid clarified butter). It is used internally and sometimes for external application also. It is known for its actions like enhancing appetite, taste perception, digestion, vision, strength, and lactation. It is used to treat diseases like fever, loss of appetite, diarrhea, vomiting,  abdominal distension, edema and puerperal disorders.<ref>[http://www.frlht.org/rasayana/jiraka National R&D facility for Rasayana - Jiraka]</ref>

Although cumin seeds contain a relatively large percentage of [[iron]], extremely large quantities of cumin would need to be consumed for it to serve as a significant dietary source (see nutrition data).

According to the USDA, one tablespoon of cumin spice contains:<ref>[http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ Search the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference]. Nal.usda.gov. Retrieved on 2011-11-26.</ref>

==Confusion with other spices==
[[File:Black Cumin.jpg|thumb|left|Black cumin seeds]]

Cumin is sometimes confused with [[caraway]] (''Carum carvi''), another [[umbelliferous]] spice. Cumin, though, is hotter to the taste, lighter in color, and larger. Many European languages do not distinguish clearly between the two. Many [[slavic languages|Slavic]] and [[Uralic languages]] refer to cumin as "[[Rome|Roman]] caraway". Examples include [[Czech language|Czech]]: ''kmín'' – caraway, ''římský kmín'' -cumin; [[Polish language|Polish]]: ''kminek'' – caraway, ''kmin rzymski'' – cumin; [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''kömény'' – caraway, ''római kömény'' – cumin.  [[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''kumina'' – caraway, ''roomankumina'' – cumin, although sometimes also called ''juustokumina'', cheese caraway. In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], caraway is called both ''karve'' and ''kummin''/''kømming'' while cumin is ''spisskummen'', from the word ''spise'', to eat. Similarly in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], caraway is ''kummin''/''kommen'', while cumin is ''spiskummin''/''spidskommen''. In [[German language|German]], ''Kümmel'' stands for caraway and ''Kreuzkümmel'' denotes cumin. In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], caraway is ''kúmen'', while cumin is ''kúmín''. In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], ''chimen'' is caraway, while ''chimion'' is cumin.

The distantly related ''[[Bunium persicum]]'' and the unrelated ''[[Nigella sativa]]'' are both sometimes called black cumin (''q.v.'').

== Aroma profile ==
[[File:CuminEssOil.png|thumb|Cumin essential oil in clear glass vial]]

Cumin's distinctive flavor and strong, warm aroma are due to its [[essential oil]] content. Its main constituent [[aroma compounds]] are [[cuminaldehyde]] (a promising agent against [[alpha-synuclein]] aggregation) and [[cuminic alcohol]]. Other important aroma compounds of toasted cumin are the [[Substitution (chemistry)|substituted]] [[pyrazine]]s, 2-ethoxy-3-isopropylpyrazine, 2-methoxy-3-''sec''-butylpyrazine, and 2-methoxy-3-methylpyrazine. Other components include [[Terpinene|γ-terpinene]], [[safranal]], [[cymene|p-cymene]] and [[beta-Pinene|β-pinene]].<ref name=cceo>{{cite journal
