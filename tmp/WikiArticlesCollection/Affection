'''Affection''' or '''fondness''' is a "[[disposition]] or rare state of mind or body"<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=affection affection - Definitions from Dictionary.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> that is often associated with a feeling or type of [[love]]. It has given rise to a number of branches of [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] concerning emotion, disease, influence, and state of being.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotions-17th18th/LD7Hutcheson.html 17th and 18th Century Theories of Emotions > Francis Hutcheson on the Emotions (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> "Affection" is popularly used to denote a feeling or type of [[love]], amounting to more than goodwill or [[friendship]]. Writers on [[ethics]] generally use the word to refer to distinct states of feeling, both lasting and spasmodic. Some contrast it with ''[[passion (emotion)|passion]]'' as being free from the distinctively sensual element.

== Restricted definition ==
More specifically, the word has been restricted to [[emotion]]al states, the object of which is a living thing such as a human or animal.  Affection is compared with passion, from the Greek "[[pathos]]". As such it appears in the writings of [[France|French]] philosopher [[René Descartes]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]] philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]], and most of the writings of early British ethicists.  However, on various grounds (e.g., that it does not involve anxiety or excitement and that it is comparatively inert and compatible with the entire absence of the sensuous element), it is generally and usefully distinguished from passion.  In this narrower sense the word has played a great part in ethical systems, which have spoken of the social or parental ''affections'' as in some sense a part of moral obligation.  For a consideration of these and similar problems, which depend ultimately on the degree in which the affections are regarded as voluntary, see [[Henry Sidgwick|H. Sidgwick]], ''Methods of Ethics'' pp.&nbsp;345–349.

==Affectionate behavior==
{{Further|Public display of affection}}
Numerous behaviors are used by people to express affection. Some theories<ref>according to [[Communication]] professor Kory Floyd of [[Arizona State University]]</ref> suggest that affectionate behavior evolved from parental nurturing behavior due to its associations with hormonal rewards such as the release of oxytocin, the bonding hormone from positive social interactions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Poquérusse|first=Jessie|title=The Neuroscience of Sharing|url=https://www.uniiverse.com/neuroscience|accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref>
Research also verifies that expressions of affection, although commonly evaluated positively, can be considered negative if they pose implied threats to one's well being. Furthermore, affectionate behavior in positively [[Valence (psychology)|valence]]d relationships may be associated with numerous health benefits. Other, more loving type gestures of affectionate behavior include obvious signs of liking a person. Affection can also shape infants' brains.<ref>Infant Observation: International Journal of Infant Observation and Its Applications</ref><br />

George Homans (1950) proposed that positive sentiment increases the propensity of people to interact and that familiarity gained through affection increases positive sentiment among them.<ref>http://www.techsociety.com/articles/JMF_Lawtonetal.pdf</ref>
 
Affection can be displayed in different manners in different cultural societies.
