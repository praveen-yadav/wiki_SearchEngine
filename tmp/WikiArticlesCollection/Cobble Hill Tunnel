The '''Cobble Hill Tunnel''' (popularly the '''Atlantic Avenue Tunnel''') of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] is an abandoned railroad tunnel beneath [[Atlantic Avenue (New York City)|Atlantic Avenue]] in downtown [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]]. When open, it ran for about {{convert|2517|ft|m}} between Columbia Street and Boerum Place.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} It is the oldest [[railway tunnel]] beneath a city street in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psfk.com/2009/03/notes-from-the-underground-the-secret-tunnels-of-brooklyn.html|title=Notes from the Underground: The Secret Tunnels of Brooklyn|last=Hilger|first=James|date=March 23, 2009|publisher=psfk.com|accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref><ref>[http://citynoise.org/article/8748 Citynoise: Oldest Subway Tunnel in the World] Retrieved 2009-04-08.</ref>{{disputed-inline|date=September 2013}}<!--see comments on http://forgotten-ny.com/2012/12/park-avenue-tunnel/ - a short piece of the Park Avenue Tunnel may be older-->

Some also claim it to be the oldest [[rapid transit|subway]] tunnel in the world, as it was built by the [[cut and cover]] method under a city street, specifically for the purposes of improved public safety, attaining [[grade separation]] and enhanced railway operations.<ref name="BHRA" /><ref>The 1869–73 [[Beach Pneumatic Transit]] is usually cited as the first attempt at constructing an underground rapid transit system in New York City. In 1904, the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]] (now the [[New York City Subway]]) opened the city's [[Original IRT subway|first underground subway line]].</ref>

== History ==
Construction began in May 1844. The tunnel opened for use on December 3, 1844, but was not completely finished until late Spring 1845. It was built mainly to satisfy public demand for creation of a [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right of way]] for the [[Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad]] (later Long Island Rail Road) on its way to the [[South Ferry, Brooklyn|South Ferry]] at the foot of Atlantic Street (later Atlantic Avenue), where passengers could catch ferries to [[Manhattan]].<ref name="BHRA">{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynrail.net/images/aa_tunnel/new_research/oct_09/events_leading_to_tunnel_creation.pdf|title=Events That Led To The Creation Of The Atlantic Avenue Tunnel|publisher=Brooklyn Historic Railway Association|accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref> The construction of the tunnel also lowered the LIRR's grade through [[Cobble Hill, Brooklyn|Cobble Hill]].

In exchange for building the tunnel, the [[City of Brooklyn]] granted the B&J permission to operate its steam locomotives on Atlantic Street west of Fifth Avenue (then Parmentier's Garden/Gowanus Lane), all the way to Brooklyn's South Ferry (the present location of Brooklyn's Pier 7). Prior to the tunnel being built, the LIRR's western terminus was Atlantic Street at Clinton Street. Train cars were hauled by teams of horses along Atlantic Street from Clinton Street to Parmentier's Garden, where steam locomotives were attached. While the tunnel was being built, the railroad operated to a temporary terminal at Pacific Street and Henry Street.

The Cobble Hill Tunnel was part of the first rail link between [[New York City]] and [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The railroad connected [[Lower Manhattan]] via the South Ferry to [[Greenport, Suffolk County, New York|Greenport]] on the [[North Fork]] of [[Long Island]], where a ferry connected to [[Stonington, Connecticut]] to a rail link that continued to Boston. This avoided some difficult construction of bridges over the rivers of southern [[Connecticut]]. In 1848, the [[New York and New Haven Railroad]] Line was completed through Connecticut, providing a direct, faster rail connection from New York City to Boston. The Cobble Hill Tunnel and the Long Island Railroad remained the primary means of access to most of central Long Island from Manhattan and New York City.

As built, the tunnel was {{convert|21|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|17|ft|m}} high and {{convert|2517|ft|m}} long.

Insofar as it carried railroad trains under a city street, some have claimed it be the world's first [[rapid transit|subway]] tunnel, though, unlike a modern rapid transit subway, it had no stations. The ends of the tunnel were sealed in the fall of 1861. The similar [[Murray Hill Tunnel]] on the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] was built as an open cut around 1836, and roofed over around the 1850s, and is in use for automobile traffic.

== Controversy during closure ==
In 1861, the [[New York State Legislature]] voted to ban railroad locomotives from within the limits of the [[City of Brooklyn]]. A tax assessment was ordered on all property owners along Atlantic Street (today Atlantic Avenue), to defray the costs of the closure. It was undisclosed at the time that [[New York State]] Governor [[John A. King]] was a major [[shareholder]] in the Brooklyn and [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]] Railroad (later the [[Long Island Rail Road]]) and therefore had a conflict of interest and stood to benefit by the compensation payments to the railroad from the tax assessment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

[[Walt Whitman]] wrote of the tunnel:<ref name=CB>{{cite web | title=Crossing Brooklyn LIRR Tunnel | work=Forgotten NY | url=http://www.forgotten-ny.com/SUBWAYS/tunnel/tunnel.html | accessdate=February 9, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>
:The old tunnel, that used to lie there under ground, a passage of [[Acheron]]-like solemnity and darkness, now all closed and filled up, and soon to be utterly forgotten, with all its reminiscences; however, there will, for a few years yet be many dear ones, to not a few Brooklynites, New Yorkers, and promiscuous crowds besides. For it was here you started to go down the island, in summer. For years, it was confidently counted on that this spot, and the railroad of which it was the terminus, were going to prove the permanent seat of business and wealth that belong to such enterprises. But its glory, after enduring in great splendor for a season, has now vanished—at least its Long Island Railroad glory has. The tunnel: dark as the grave, cold, damp, and silent. How beautiful look earth and heaven again, as we emerge from the gloom! It might not be unprofitable, now and then, to send us mortals—the dissatisfied ones, at least, and that's a large proportion—into some tunnel of several days' journey. We'd perhaps grumble less, afterward, at God's handiwork.

In March 1916, the [[FBI|Bureau of Investigation]] suspected German [[terrorist]]s were making bombs in the tunnel, and broke through the roof of the tunnel with jackhammers. They found nothing, installed an electric light, and resealed it. In the 1920s it was rumored used for both mushroom growing and bootleg whiskey stills even though there was no access into the main portion of the tunnel. It became an object of local folklore and legend. In 1936, the [[New York City Police Department]] unsuccessfully attempted to enter the tunnel, in order to look for the body of a hoodlum supposedly buried there. In 1941 it was rumored to have been inspected by the federal [[Works Progress Administration]] to determine its structural strength, but there is no evidence of this. A few years later, it was once again rumored to have been opened, this time by the FBI, in an unsuccessful search for spies; however, there is no evidence of this. During the late 1950s it was sought by two rail historians, George Horn and Martin Schachne, but they did not gain access to the tunnel itself.

== Rediscovery ==
Having fallen from public notice, the tunnel was rediscovered in 1981 by then 18-year-old Robert "Bob" Diamond, who entered from a manhole he located at Atlantic Avenue and Court Street, crawled a distance of {{convert|70|ft|m}} underground through a filled-in section of tunnel less than two feet high, and located the bulkhead wall that sealed off the main portion of the tunnel. With the assistance of a Brooklyn Union Gas Co. (now [[KeySpan|National Grid]]) engineering crew, he then broke through the massive concrete bulkhead wall, which is several feet thick. Diamond thereby opened access to the main portion of the tunnel, and began to popularize the tunnel as an antiquity. He led tours of its interior<ref name=CB /> through December 17, 2010.<ref>[http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local-beat/Brooklyn-Underground-Tunnel-Tours-Are-Now-Six-Feet-Under-112103379.html NBC.com]</ref> The tunnel has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] since 1989.

The [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] series ''Cities of the Underworld'' ran a segment ("New York's Secret Societies") on the tunnel in Fall 2008. The TV show ''[[Treasure Hunters (TV series)|Treasure Hunters]]'' used it in an episode.
