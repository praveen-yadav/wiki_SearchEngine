'''Dioscoreales''' is a [[botanical name]] for an order of [[flowering plants]].  Of necessity it contains the family [[Dioscoreaceae]] which includes the [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] that is used as an important food source in many regions around the globe.

==Taxonomy==
In [[APG II system]], of 2003, this order was placed in the clade [[monocots]] and comprised the families [[Burmanniaceae]], [[Dioscoreaceae]] and [[Nartheciaceae]].

Under the [[APG system]] of 1998, the order was placed in the clade monocots and comprised the families Burmanniaceae, Dioscoreaceae, [[Taccaceae]], [[Thismiaceae]] and [[Trichopodaceae]]

In APG II, the family Thismiaceae has been included in family Burmanniaceae and the families Taccaceae and Trichopodaceae have been included in family Dioscoreaceae. Therefore the change is not as large as might appear, and the only plants to have moved across the borders of the order are those belonging to family Nartheciaceae.

The [[Cronquist system]], of 1981, did not recognise such an order, but placed most such plants in order [[Liliales]] in subclass [[Liliidae]] in class [[Liliopsida]] (monocotyledons) of division [[Magnoliophyta]] (angiosperms).

Under the [[Dahlgren system]], Dioscoreales was placed in the superorder [[Lilianae]] in subclass [[Liliidae]] (monocotyledons) of class [[Magnoliopsida]] (angiosperms) and comprised the families Dioscoreaceae, [[Petermanniaceae]], [[Ripogonaceae]], [[Smilacaceae]], [[Stemonaceae]], Taccaceae, Trichopodaceae and [[Trilliaceae]].

==Ecology and Evolution==

The three families included in order Dioscoreales also represent three different ecological groups of plants. [[Dioscoreaceae]] contains mainly vines (''[[Dioscorea]]'') and other crawling species (''[[Epipetrum]]''). [[Nartheciaceae]] on the other hand is a family composed of herbeceous plants with a rather lily-like appearance (''[[Aletris]]'') while [[Burmanniaceae]] is entirely [[myco-heterotrophic]] group.

The data for the evolution of the order is collected from molecular analyses<ref>http://bio.kuleuven.be/sys/site/Publicaties/2010/Vincent%20Merckx/Monocots%202010%20Merckx.pdf</ref> since there are no such fossils found. It is estimated that Dioscoreales and its sister clade [[Pandanales]] split up around 121 millions of years ago during Early Cretaceous when the [[stem group]] was formed. Then it took 3 to 6 millions of years for the [[crown group]] to differentiate in Mid [[Cretaceous]].

==Description and Distribution==
Species from this order are distributed across all of the continents except [[Antarctica]]. They are mainly tropical representatives but however there are members of [[Dioscoreaceae]] and [[Nartheciaceae]] families found in cooler regions of [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. Order Dioscoreales contains plants that are able to form an underground organ for reservation of [[nutrition]]s as many other [[monocot]]s. An exception is the family [[Burmanniaceae]] which is entirely myco-heterotrophic and contains species that lack [[photosynthetic]] abilities.
All of the species except the genera placed in [[Nartheciaceae]] express simultaneous [[microsporogenesis]].<ref>http://science.naturalis.nl/media/308529/int%20j%20pl%20sci%20schols%20et%20al%202005%20part%201.pdf</ref> Plants in [[Nartheciaceae]] show successive [[microsporogenesis]] which is one of the traits indicating that the family is sister to all the other members included in the order.
