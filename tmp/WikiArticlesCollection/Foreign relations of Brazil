{{Politics of Brazil}}
The [[Ministry of External Relations (Brazil)|Ministry of External Relations]] is responsible for managing the '''foreign relations of Brazil.''' [[Brazil]] is a significant [[political]] and [[economic]] power in [[Latin America]] and a key player on the world stage.<ref>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/south-america/brazil?profile=intRelations&pg=4 Country Profile: Brazil] UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Retrieved on 2009-01-05.</ref> Brazil's [[foreign policy]] reflects its role as a [[regional power]] and a potential [[world power]] and is designed to help protect the country's [[national interests]], [[national security]], [[ideology|ideological goals]], and [[prosperity|economic prosperity]].

Between [[World War II]] and 1990, both [[democratic]] and [[Military dictatorship|military]] governments sought to expand Brazil's influence in the world by pursuing a state-led [[industrial policy]] and an independent [[foreign policy]]. Brazilian foreign policy has recently aimed to strengthen ties with other [[South America]]n countries, engage in multilateral diplomacy through the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization of American States]], and act at times as a countervailing force to [[United States|U.S.]] political and economic influence in Latin America.

==Overview==
Brazil's international relations are based on article 4 of the [[Constitution of Brazil|Federal Constitution]], which establishes [[Non-interventionism|non-intervention]], [[self-determination]], [[Internationalism (politics)|international cooperation]] and the [[Peacebuilding|peaceful settlement of conflicts]] as the guiding principles of Brazil's relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations.<ref>[http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleI.html Article 4 of the Federal Constitution of Brazil] V-Brazil. Retrieved on 2011-09-20.</ref> According to the Constitution, the [[President of Brazil|President]] has ultimate authority over foreign policy, while [[National Congress of Brazil|Congress]] is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and [[Treaty|international treaties]], as well as legislation relating to Brazilian foreign policy.<ref>[http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleIV.html Article 84 of the Federal Constitution of Brazil] V-Brazil. Retrieved on 2011-09-20.</ref>

The [[Ministry of External Relations (Brazil)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], also known as Itamaraty, is the government department responsible for advising the President and conducting Brazil's foreign relations with other countries and international bodies. Itamaraty's scope includes political, commercial, economic, financial, cultural and consular relations, areas in which it performs the classical tasks of diplomacy: represent, inform and negotiate. Foreign policy priorities are established by the President.

[[File:1st BRIC summit leaders.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[BRIC]] (Brazil, Russia, India and China) leaders during the [[2009 BRIC summit|1st BRIC summit]] in 2009.]]
Brazil's foreign policy is a by-product of the country's unique position as a [[regional power]] in [[Latin America]], a leader among [[developing countries]], and an emerging [[world power]].<ref>[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/news/docs/RL33456.pdf U.S. Congressional Report on Brazil] [[United States Congress]]. Retrieved on 2009-06-23.</ref> Brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of [[multilateralism]], peaceful dispute settlement, and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries.<ref>Georges D. Landau, "The Decision-making Process in Foreign Policy: The Case of Brazil," Center for Strategic and International Studies: Washington DC: March 2003</ref> Brazil engages in multilateral [[diplomacy]] through the Organization of American States and the United Nations, and has increased ties with developing countries in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]. Brazil is currently commanding a multinational U.N. stabilization force in Haiti, the [[MINUSTAH]]. Instead of pursuing unilateral prerogatives, Brazilian foreign policy has tended to emphasize regional integration, first through the [[Mercosur|Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosul)]] and now the [[Union of South American Nations]]. Brazil is also committed to cooperation with other Portuguese-speaking nations<ref>http://www.brasilemb.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=144&Itemid=133</ref> through joint-collaborations with the rest of the Portuguese-speaking world, in several domains which include military cooperation, financial aid, and cultural exchange. This is done in the framework of [[CPLP]],<ref>http://www.cplp.org/Default.aspx</ref> for instance. Lula da Silva's recent visit to [[Africa]] included State visits to three Portuguese-speaking African nations ([[Angola]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], and [[Mozambique]]).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3234519.stm | work=BBC News | title=Brazil's president visits Angola | date=2003-11-03 | accessdate=2010-04-02}}</ref> Finally, Brazil is also strongly committed in the development and restoration of peace in [[East Timor]], where it has a very powerful influence.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pepe|first=Leandro Leone|title=O envolvimento do Brasil na questão timorense|journal=Revue Lusotopie XIII|year=2005|url=http://docserver.ingentaconnect.com/deliver/connect/brill/12570273/v13n2/s2.pdf?expires=1347340272&id=70397587&titleid=75000163&accname=Guest+User&checksum=92066919CF39D1CE272B3FC32CDDA017|accessdate=11 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Brazil sends observers to East Timor elections|url=http://www.brazil.org.uk/press/pressreleases_files/20070622.html|publisher=Embassy of Brazil in London|accessdate=11 September 2012|month=June|year=2007}}</ref>

Brazil's political, business, and military ventures are complemented by the country's [[trade policy]]. In Brazil, the [[Ministry of Foreign Relations of Brazil|Ministry of Foreign Relations]] continues to dominate trade policy, causing the country's commercial interests to be (at times) subsumed by a larger foreign policy goal, namely, enhancing Brazil's influence in Latin America and the world.<ref>CRS Report RL33258, Brazilian Trade Policy and the United States, by J.F. Hornbeck</ref> For example, while concluding meaningful trade agreements with [[developed countries]] (such as the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]]) would probably be beneficial to Brazil's long-term economic self-interest, the Brazilian government has instead prioritized its leadership role within Mercosul and expanded trade ties with countries in Africa, Asia and the [[Middle East]].

Brazil's [[soft power]] diplomacy involves institutional strategies such as the formation of diplomatic coalitions to constrain the [[Power (politics)|power]] of the established [[great power]]s.<ref name="RBPI">[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-73292010000100008&script=sci_arttext Brazil in the BRIC initiative: soft balancing in the shifting world order?] Revista Brasileira de Política Internacional.

The BRICS states have been amongst the most powerful drivers of incremental change in world diplomacy and they benefit most from the connected global power shifts.<ref name="RBPI" />

===Lula da Silva administration===
The Brazilian foreign policy under the [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]] administration had been focused on the following directives: to contribute toward the search for greater equilibrium and attenuate [[unilateralism]]; to strengthen [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] and [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] relations in order to increase the country's weight in political and economic negotiations on an international level; to deepen relations so as to benefit from greater economical, financial, technological and cultural interchange; to avoid agreements that could jeopardize development in the long term.<ref name="UNESP">[http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/8/0/4/5/pages180452/p180452-1.php Lula da Silva’s Foreign Policy: The Autonomy through Diversification Strategy] Vigevani, Tullo; Cepaluni, Gabriel. Retrieved on 2009-07-11.</ref>

These directives implied precise emphasis on: the search for political coordination with [[Newly industrialized country|emerging]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]], namely [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Russia]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]]; creation of the [[Union of South American Nations]] and its derivative bodies, such as the South American Security Council; strengthening of [[Mercosul]]; projection at the [[Doha Development Round|Doha Round]] and [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]; maintenance of relations with [[developed country|developed countries]], including the [[United States of America|United States]]; undertaking and narrowing of relations with [[Africa]]n countries; campaign for the [[reform of the United Nations Security Council]] and for a permanent seat for Brazil; and defense of social objectives allowing for a greater equilibrium between the States and populations.<ref name="UNESP"/>

After democratization, a strong integration and partnership began between the two countries. In 1985 they signed the basis for the [[MERCOSUL]], a Regional Trade Agreement. In the field of science, the two regional giants had been rivals since the 1950s when both governments launched parallel nuclear and space programs, however, several agreements were signed since then such as the creation of the [[Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials]] (ABACC) to verify both countries' pledges to use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes. National spaces agencies [[CONAE]] and the [[Brazilian Space Agency|AEB]] had also began working together since the 1990s. Brazil's decision to prevent a Royal Navy ship docking in Rio de Janeiro was seen as backing Argentina over the Falklands dispute.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/8251700/Britains-isolation-on-Falklands-grows-with-anti-colonial-Brazil-snub.html Britain's isolation on Falklands grows with 'anti-colonial' Brazil snub]</ref>

Also on the military side there has been greater rapprochement. In accordance with the friendship policy, both armies dissolved or moved major units previously located at their common border (for example, [[Argentine Army|Argentine]]'s 7th Jungle and 3rd Motorized Infantry Brigades).
