{{about|dialects of spoken and written languages|other uses|Dialect (disambiguation)}}

{{refimprove|date=August 2012}}
The term '''dialect''' (from the [[ancient Greek]] word διάλεκτος ''diálektos'', "discourse", from [[:wikt:διά|διά]] ''diá'', "through" + [[:wikt:λέγω|λέγω]] ''legō'', "I speak") is used in two distinct ways. One usage—the more common among [[linguist]]s—refers to a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of a [[language]] that is a characteristic of a particular group of the language's speakers.<ref>[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063104?query_type=word&queryword=dialect&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&result_place=1&search_id=tFGd-Bh8USU-18775&hilite=50063104 Oxford English dictionary.]</ref> The term is applied most often to regional speech patterns, but a dialect may also be defined by other factors, such as social class.<ref>[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/dialect Merriam-Webster Online dictionary.]</ref> A dialect that is associated with a particular [[social class]] can be termed a [[sociolect]], a dialect that is associated with a particular [[ethnic group]] can be termed as [[ethnolect]], and a regional dialect may be termed a regiolect or topolect. According to this definition, any variety of a language constitutes "a dialect", including any [[standard language|standard varieties]].

The other usage refers to a language that is socially subordinated to a regional or national standard language, often historically [[cognate]] to the standard, but not derived ''from'' it.<ref>Maiden, Martin & Mair Parry. 1997. ''The Dialects of Italy''. London: Routledge, p. 2.</ref> In this sense, the standard language is not itself considered a dialect.

A framework was developed in 1967 by [[Heinz Kloss]], [[Ausbausprache, Abstandsprache and Dachsprache|Ausbau-, Abstand- and Dach-sprache]], to describe speech communities, that while unified politically and/or culturally, include multiple dialects which though closely related genetically may be divergent to the point of inter-dialect unintelligibility.

A dialect is distinguished by its vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation ([[phonology]], including [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]). Where a distinction can be made only in terms of pronunciation (including prosody, or just prosody itself), the term ''[[Accent (dialect)|accent]]'' is appropriate, not ''dialect.''
Other speech varieties include: [[standard language]]s, which are standardized for public performance (for example, a written standard); [[jargon]]s, which are characterized by differences in [[lexicon]] ([[vocabulary]]); [[slang]]; [[patois]]; [[pidgin]]s or [[argot]]s.

The particular speech patterns used by an individual are termed an [[idiolect]].

== Standard and non-standard dialect ==
A '''standard dialect''' (also known as a '''standardized dialect''' or "[[standard language]]") is a dialect that is supported by institutions. Such institutional support may include government recognition or designation; presentation as being the "correct" form of a language in schools; published grammars, dictionaries, and textbooks that set forth a correct spoken and written form; and an extensive formal literature that employs that dialect (prose, poetry, non-fiction, etc.). There may be multiple standard dialects associated with a single language. For example, Standard [[American English]], Standard [[Canadian English]], Standard [[Indian English]], Standard [[Australian English]], and Standard [[Philippine English]] may all be said to be standard dialects of the [[English language]].

A [[nonstandard dialect]], like a standard dialect, has a complete vocabulary, grammar, and syntax, but is usually not the beneficiary of institutional support. Examples of a nonstandard English dialect are [[Southern American English]], [[Western Australian English]] and [[Scouse]]. The [[Dialect Test]] was designed by [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] to compare different English dialects with each other.

== Dialect or language ==
There is no universally accepted criterion for distinguishing a ''language'' from a ''dialect''. A number of rough measures exist, sometimes leading to contradictory results. Some linguists<ref name=finegan>{{cite book |title=Language: Its Structure and Use|edition=5th |last=Finegan |first=Edward |year=2007 |publisher= Thomson Wadsworth|location=Boston, MA, USA|isbn=978-1-4130-3055-6 |page=348}}</ref> do not differentiate between languages and dialects, using the neutral term "(language) '''variety'''" to refer to a particular group's way of speaking without taking a position on whether it constitutes a "language" or a "dialect". The distinction is therefore subjective and depends on the user's frame of reference. 

The most common, and most purely linguistic, criterion is that of '''[[mutual intelligibility]]''': two varieties are said to be dialects of the same language if being a speaker of one variety confers sufficient knowledge to understand and be understood by a speaker of the other; otherwise, they are said to be different languages. However, this definition becomes problematic in the case of [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]], in which it may be the case that Dialect B is mutually intelligible with both Dialect A and Dialect C but Dialects A and C are not mutually intelligible with each other. In this case the criterion of mutual intelligibility makes it impossible to decide whether A and C are dialects of the same language or not. Cases may also arise in which a speaker of Dialect X can understand a speaker of Dialect Y, but not vice versa; the mutual intelligibility criterion founders here as well.

Another occasionally-used criterion for discriminating dialects from languages is that of linguistic authority, a more [[sociolinguistic]] notion. According to this definition, two varieties are considered dialects of the same language if (under at least some circumstances) they would defer to the same authority regarding some questions about their language. For instance, to learn the name of a new invention, or an obscure foreign species of plant, speakers of [[Bavarian German]] and [[East Franconian German]] might each consult a German dictionary or ask a German-speaking expert in the subject. Although [[Yiddish]] is in some cases mutually intelligible with some dialects of German, a Yiddish speaker would not necessarily consider a German authority a reliable source on what word to use in such a case; for this reason Yiddish is not considered a dialect of German.

Note also that the terms are not always treated as mutually exclusive;{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} there is not necessarily anything contradictory in the statement that "the ''language'' of the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] is a dialect of [[German (language)|German]]."

By the definition most commonly used by linguists, any linguistic variety can be considered a "dialect" of ''some'' language—"everybody speaks a dialect". According to that interpretation, the criteria above merely serve to distinguish whether two varieties are dialects of the ''same'' language or dialects of ''different'' languages. 

=== Political factors ===

In many societies, however, a particular dialect, often the sociolect of the [[elite]] class, comes to be identified as the "standard" or "proper" version of a language by those seeking to make a social distinction, and is contrasted with other varieties. As a result of this, in some contexts the term "dialect" refers specifically to varieties with low [[social status]]. In this secondary sense of "dialect", language varieties are often called ''dialects'' rather than ''languages'':
* if they have no standard or [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] form,
* if they are rarely or never used in writing (outside reported speech),
* if the speakers of the given language do not have a [[State (polity)|state]] of their own,
* if they lack [[prestige dialect|prestige]] with respect to some other, often standardised, variety.

The status of "language" is not solely determined by linguistic criteria, but it is also the result of a historical and political development. [[Romansh language|Romansh]] came to be a written language, and therefore it is recognized as a language, even though it is very close to the Lombardic alpine dialects. An opposite example is the case of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], whose variations such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] are often called dialects and not languages, despite their mutual unintelligibility.

Modern [[Nationalism]], as developed especially since the [[French Revolution]], has made the distinction between "language" and "dialect" an issue of great political importance. A group speaking a separate "language" is often seen as having a greater claim to being a separate "people", and thus to be more deserving of its own independent state, while a group speaking a "dialect" tends to be seen not as "a people" in its own right, but as a sub-group, part of a bigger people, which must content itself with regional autonomy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The distinction between language and dialect is thus inevitably made at least as much on a political basis as on a linguistic one, and can lead to great political controversy, or even armed conflict.

The [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] linguist [[Max Weinreich]] published the expression, ''A shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot'' ({{rtl-lang|yi|"אַ שפּראַך איז אַ דיאַלעקט מיט אַן אַרמײ און פֿלאָט"}} &nbsp; "[[A language is a dialect with an army and navy]]") in ''YIVO Bleter'' 25.1, 1945, p.&nbsp;13. The significance of the political factors in any attempt at answering the question "what is a language?" is great enough to cast doubt on whether any strictly linguistic definition, without a socio-cultural approach, is possible. This is illustrated by the frequency with which the army-navy aphorism is cited.

=== Germany ===

In 18th and 19th century Germany, several thousand local languages of the continental west Germanic dialect continuum were reclassified as dialects of modern [[New High German]] although the vast majority of them were (and still are) mutually incomprehensible, despite the fact that they all existed long before New High German,<ref>''see also: [[Ausbausprache, Abstandsprache and Dachsprache#Change of roles during history]]</ref> which had at least in part been shaped as a compromise or [[Ausgleichssprache|mediative language]] between these local languages.

To support the intended process of [[nation building]] even further, a vague myth of some common Germanic original language developed, and [[German dialectology]] began to name dialect groups after presumed and real groups of historic tribes having existed from BC to about 600 AD, from which they were assumed to have descended.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Linguistic, historic and archeological evidence for such connections is scarce, meanwhile several such ideas were proven false, yet they lead to several pertaining misnomers in German dialectology. Today, all diverse [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] local languages under the Standard German umbrella are collectively referred to as "German dialects", (including [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] and Low Saxon ones, that are closer to [[language|Dutch]]){{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} the vast majority of German speakers still believe, they were variations of "original" or even Standard German{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.

In the 19th Century, the [[Tsar]]ist Government of [[Russia]] claimed that [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] was merely a dialect of [[Russian language|Russian]] and not a language in its own right. Since Soviet times, when Ukrainians were recognised as a separate nationality deserving of its own Soviet Republic, such linguistic-political claims had disappeared from circulation.

=== The Balkans ===

The classification of speech varieties as dialects or languages and their relationship to other varieties of speech can thus be controversial and the verdicts inconsistent. English and [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] illustrate the point. English and Serbo-Croatian each have two major variants ([[British English|British]] and American English, and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]], respectively), along with numerous other varieties. For political reasons, analyzing these varieties as "languages" or "dialects" yields inconsistent results: British and American English, spoken by close political and military allies, are almost universally regarded as dialects of a single language, whereas the standard languages of [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]], which differ from each other to a similar extent as the dialects of English, are being treated by some linguists from the region as distinct languages, largely because the two countries oscillate from being brotherly to being bitter enemies. (The Serbo-Croatian language article deals with this topic much more fully.)

Similar examples abound. [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], although mutually intelligible with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], certain dialects of Serbian and to a lesser extent the rest of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] [[dialect continuum]] is considered by Bulgarian linguists to be a Bulgarian dialect, in contrast with the contemporary international view, and the view in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] which regards it as a language in its own right. Nevertheless, before the establishment of a literary standard of Macedonian in 1944, in most sources in and out of Bulgaria before the Second World War, the southern Slavonic dialect continuum covering the area of today's Republic of Macedonia were referred to as Bulgarian dialects.

===Lebanon===
In [[Lebanon]], a part of the Christian population considers [[Lebanese language|"Lebanese"]] to be in some sense a distinct language from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and not merely a dialect. During the civil war Christians often used Lebanese Arabic officially, and sporadically used the [[Latin-derived alphabet|roman alphabet]] to write Lebanese, thus further distinguishing it from Arabic. All Lebanese laws are written in the standard literary form of Arabic, though parliamentary debate may be conducted in Lebanese Arabic.

===North Africa===
In Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, the spoken [[Darija|North African languages]] are sometimes considered more different from other Arabic dialects. Officially, North African and West Asian countries prefer to give preference to the [[Literary Arabic]] and conduct much of their political, cultural and religious life in it (adherence to [[Islam]]), and refrain from declaring each country's specific variety to be a separate language, because Literary Arabic is the [[liturgical language]] of Islam and the language of the Islamic sacred book, the [[Qur'an]].

=== USA ===

Such moves may even appear at a local, rather than a federal level. The US state of [[Illinois]] declared "American" to be the state's [[official language]] in 1923,<ref>[http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Jwcrawford/american.htm ''"American" as the Official Language of the United States.'']</ref> although linguists and politicians throughout much of the rest of the country considered "American" simply to be an adjective referring to the United States of America. [[American English]] is a ''set'' of dialects of the English language, used mostly in the United States.

=== Moldova ===

There have been cases of a variety of speech being deliberately reclassified to serve political purposes. One example is [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]]. In 1996, the Moldovan parliament, citing fears of "Romanian expansionism," rejected a proposal from [[President of Moldova|President]] [[Mircea Snegur]] to change the name of the language to Romanian, and in 2003 a [[Moldovan–Romanian dictionary]] was published, purporting to show that the two countries speak different languages. Linguists of the [[Romanian Academy]] reacted by declaring that all the Moldovan words were also Romanian words; while in Moldova, the head of the [[Academy of Sciences of Moldova]], Ion Bărbuţă, described the dictionary as a politically motivated "absurdity".

=== China ===
{{Main|Varieties of Chinese}}

[[Spoken Chinese|The spoken languages]] of the [[Han Chinese]] are usually{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} referred to as dialects of one Chinese language despite their vast differences.

== Historical linguistics ==
Many [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]] view any speech form as a dialect of the older medium of communication from which it developed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} This point of view sees the modern [[Romance languages]] as dialects of [[Latin]], modern [[Greek language|Greek]] as a dialect of Ancient Greek, [[Tok Pisin]] as a dialect of English, and [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] as dialects of [[Old Norse]]. This paradigm is not entirely problem-free. It sees genetic relationships as paramount: the "dialects" of a "language" (which itself may be a "dialect" of a yet older tongue) may or may not be mutually intelligible. Moreover, a parent language may spawn several "dialects" which themselves subdivide any number of times, with some "branches" of the tree changing more rapidly than others.

This can give rise to the situation in which two dialects (defined according to this paradigm) with a somewhat distant genetic relationship are mutually more readily comprehensible than more closely related dialects. In one opinion, this pattern is clearly present among the modern Romance tongues, with [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] having a high degree of mutual comprehensibility, which neither language shares with [[French language|French]], despite some claiming that both languages are ''genetically'' closer to French than to each other:{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In fact, French-Italian and French-Spanish relative mutual incomprehensibility is due to French having undergone more rapid and more pervasive phonological change than have Spanish and Italian, not to real or imagined distance in genetic relationship. In fact, Italian and French share many more root words in common that do not even appear in Spanish.

For example, the Italian and French words for various foods, some family relationships, and body parts are very similar to each other, yet most of those words are completely different in Spanish. Italian "avere" and "essere" as auxiliaries for forming compound tenses are used similarly to French "avoir" and "être", Spanish only retains "haber" and has done away with "ser" in forming compound tenses, which are no longer used in either Spanish or Portuguese. However, when it comes to phonological structures, Italian and Spanish have undergone less change than French, with the result that some native speakers of Italian and Spanish may attain a degree of mutual comprehension that permits extensive communication.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Interlingua ===

{{Main|Interlingua}}

One language, [[Interlingua]], was [[Interlingua and eligibility of international words|developed]] so that the languages of Western civilization would act as its dialects.<ref name = "coljld">[[Alice Vanderbilt Morris|Morris, Alice Vanderbilt]], [http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm#manyrepresented General report]. New York: International Auxiliary Language Association, 1945.</ref> Drawing from such concepts as the [[international scientific vocabulary]] and [[Standard Average European]], linguists{{who|date=July 2013}} developed a theory that the modern Western languages were actually dialects of a hidden or latent language.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Researchers at the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] extracted words and affixes that they considered to be part of Interlingua's vocabulary.<ref name = "jawmqc">[[Alexander Gode|Gode, Alexander]], [[Interlingua-English Dictionary]]. New York: Storm Publishers, 1951.</ref> In theory, speakers of the Western languages would understand written or spoken Interlingua immediately, without prior study, since their own languages were its dialects.<ref name = "coljld"/> This has often turned out to be true, especially, but not solely, for speakers of the Romance languages and educated speakers of English. Interlingua has also been found to assist in the learning of other languages. In one study, Swedish high school students learning Interlingua were able to translate passages from Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian that students of those languages found too difficult to understand.<ref>Gopsill, F. P., ''International languages: A matter for Interlingua''. Sheffield: British Interlingua Society, 1990.</ref> It should be noted, however, that the vocabulary of Interlingua extends beyond the Western language families.<ref name = "jawmqc"/>
