'''Antares''' (α Scorpii, α Sco, [[Bayer designation|Alpha]] Scorpii) is a [[red supergiant]] [[star]] in the [[Milky Way]] [[Galaxy]] and [[list of brightest stars|the sixteenth brightest star]] in the nighttime sky. It is sometimes listed as 15th brightest, if the two brighter components of the [[Capella (star)|Capella]] quadruple star system are counted as one star.  Along with [[Aldebaran]], [[Regulus]], and [[Fomalhaut]], Antares comprises the group known as the '[[Royal stars]] of Persia'. It is one of the four brightest stars near the [[ecliptic]]. It is the brightest star in the constellation [[Scorpius]], and is often referred to as "the heart of the scorpion". Antares is a [[slow irregular variable]] star with an average [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] of +1.09.<ref name="simbad" />
Antares is the brightest, most massive, and most evolved stellar member of the nearest [[stellar association|OB association]] (the [[Scorpius-Centaurus Association]]). Antares is a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the [[Scorpius-Centaurus Association]], which contains thousands of stars with mean age 11 million years at a distance of approximately 145 parsecs (470 light years).<ref name="Pecaut"/>

Antares is a [[supergiant star]] with a [[stellar classification]] of M1.5Iab-b.<ref name="simbad" /> It has a radius of approximately [[List of largest known stars|883 times that of the Sun]];<ref name=aaa474_1_229/> if it were placed in the center of our solar system, its outer surface would lie between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Based upon [[parallax]] measurements, Antares is approximately {{Convert|550|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} from the Earth.<ref name=aaa474_2_653/> Its visual [[luminosity]] is about 10,000 times that of the [[Sun]], but because the star radiates a considerable part of its energy in the [[infrared]] part of the [[spectrum]], the [[Bolometer|bolometric]] luminosity equals roughly 65,000 times that of the Sun. The mass of the star has been calculated to be in the range of 15 to 18 [[solar mass]]es.<ref name="kaler">{{Cite web|last=Kaler|first=James|title=Antares|url= http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/antares.html|accessdate=13 August 2008}}</ref> A recent analysis<ref name="Pecaut">{{Cite journal|author=Mark J.

Antares is visible in the sky all night around May 31 of each year, when the star is at [[opposition (astronomy and astrology)|opposition]] to the [[Sun]]. At this time, Antares rises at dusk and sets at dawn. For approximately two to three weeks on either side of November 30, Antares is not visible in the night sky, because it is near [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] with the Sun;<ref name="LASCO">{{cite web

===Companion star===
[[File:Antares System.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Illustration of Antares and its companion star, Antares B]]

Antares has a secondary, or companion star, Antares B, that changed from an angular separation (from its primary, Antares A) of 3.3 [[Arcminute#Astronomy|arcseconds]] in 1854 to 2.86 arcseconds in 1990. The last is equal to a projected separation of about 529&nbsp;[[Astronomical Unit]]s (AU) at the estimated distance of Antares, giving a minimum value for the separation of the pair. Spectroscopic examination of the energy states in the outflow of matter from the companion star suggests that it is about 224&nbsp;AU beyond the primary,<ref name=aaa474_1_229/> giving a combined separation of about 574&nbsp;AU.<ref name=separation/> The stellar classification of this star is B2.5,<ref name="kaler" /> with numerous spectral lines suggesting it has been polluted by matter ejected by Antares A.<ref name=aaa474_1_229/> At magnitude 5.5, it is only 1/370th as bright visually as Antares A, although it shines with 170 times the Sun's luminosity.<ref name="kaler" />

The companion star is normally difficult to see in small telescopes due to glare from Antares A, but can sometimes be seen in apertures over {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Brightest Stars: Discovering the Universe Through the Sky's Most Brilliant Stars |last=Schaaf|first=Fred |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-70410-2 |page=218 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=LvnNFyPAQyUC&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218 }}</ref> The companion is often described as green, but this is probably either a contrast effect<ref name="kaler" /> or the result of the mixing of light from the two stars when they are seen together through a telescope and are too close to be completely resolved. Antares B can sometimes be observed with a small [[telescope]] for a few seconds during lunar [[occultation]]s while Antares A is hidden by the [[Moon]]. It was discovered by [[Johann Tobias Bürg]] during one such occultation on April 13, 1819,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Burnham's Celestial Handbook |last=Burnham |first=Robert, Jr. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1978 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |isbn= |page=1666 |url= }}</ref> but until its existence was confirmed in 1846 it was thought by some to be merely the light of Antares viewed through the Moon's atmosphere (which at the time was theorized to exist).<ref name="Johnson1879">S.J. Johnson, "Occultation of Antares." ''The Observatory,'' Vol. 3, pp. 84-86 (1879)</ref>  When observed by itself during such an occultation, the companion appears a profound blue or bluish-green color.<ref name="Johnson1879" /> 

The orbit of the companion star is poorly known, with an estimated [[orbital period|period]] of 1,200<ref name=mason>{{cite doi|10.1086/323921}}</ref> - 2,562 years.<ref name=reimers>{{cite doi|10.1051/0004-6361:200809983}}</ref>

===Position on the ecliptic===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Antares-sun.gif|thumb|left|200px|Antares near the Sun, event which occurs on December 2 every year. Image from SOHO.]] -->
Antares is one of the 4 first magnitude stars that lies within 5° of the ecliptic (like [[Spica]], [[Regulus]] and [[Aldebaran]]) and therefore can be [[Occultation|occulted]] by the Moon and, though rarely, by Venus. The last occultation of Antares by Venus took place on September 17, 525BC; the next one will take place on November 17, 2400. Other planets did not occult Antares in the last millennium nor will they do so in the next millennium, as they pass as a result of their actual node position and inclination always northward of Antares. On 31 July 2009, Antares was occulted by the Moon. The event was visible in much of southern Asia and the Middle East.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Occultation of Antares on 31 July 09 |url=http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/bstar/0731antares.htm |date= |work= |publisher=The International Occultation Timing Association |accessdate=2 August 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-08-02/pune/28181352_1_occultation-moon-sky-watchers | work=The Times Of India | title=Sky watchers report occultation of Antares by moon | date=2 August 2009}}</ref> Every year around December 2 the Sun passes 5° north of Antares.<ref name="LASCO"/>

==Traditional names==
Antares, the proper name of this star, derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|Άντάρης}}, meaning "anti-[[Ares]]" ("anti-Mars"), due to the similarity of its [[red]]dish hue to the appearance of the planet [[Mars]].<ref>Gettings, Fred ♦ [http://www.amazon.com/Arkana-Dictionary-Astrology-Fred-Gettings/dp/0140192875 The Arkana Dictionary of Astrology] Penguin Books, 1985, p. 24 ♦ ''"Antares: Sometimes called Antar, in confusion with a literary hero (see Allen), the modern name is said to be derived from its red colour, in that it was rival even of the planet Mars—the Greek, ''anti-Ares''."''</ref> The comparison of Antares with Mars may have originated with early [[Babylonian astronomy|Mesopotamian astronomers]].<ref name="allen" /> However, some scholars have speculated that the star may have been named after [[Antarah ibn Shaddad|Antar]], or Antarah ibn Shaddad, the Arab warrior-hero celebrated in the Golden [[Mu'allaqat]].<ref name="allen" />
* In ancient [[Mesopotamia]], Antares may have been known by the following names: Urbat, Bilu-sha-ziri ("the Lord of the Seed"), Kak-shisa ("the Creator of Prosperity"), Dar Lugal ("The King"), Masu Sar ("the Hero and the King"), and Kakkab Bir ("the Vermilion Star").<ref name="allen" />
* In [[Persia]], Antares was known as ''Satevis'', one of the four "[[royal stars]]".<ref>Allen, R. H. (1963): According to [[Charles François Dupuis]], a French astronomical writer</ref>
* In [[India]], it with [[Sigma Scorpii|σ]] and [[Tau Scorpii|τ Sco]] were [[Jyeshtha (nakshatra)|Jyeshthā]], one  of  the ''[[nakshatra]]'' ([[Hindu]] [[lunar mansion]]s).<ref name="allen">{{Cite book

* The Wotjobaluk [[Koori]] people of Victoria, Australia, knew Antares as ''Djuit'', son of ''Marpean-kurrk'' ([[Arcturus]]); the stars on each side represented his wives. The Kulin Kooris saw Antares (''Balayang'') as the brother of ''Bunjil'' ([[Altair]]).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mudrooroo|title=Aboriginal mythology : an A-Z spanning the history of aboriginal mythology from the earliest legends to the present day|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|year=1994|page=5|isbn=1-85538-306-3}}</ref>
