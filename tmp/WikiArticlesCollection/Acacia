'''''Acacia''''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|eɪ|ʃ|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|eɪ|s|i|ə}}), also known as a '''thorntree''', '''[[whistling thorn]]''' or '''wattle''', is a genus of shrubs and trees belonging to the [[subfamily]] [[Mimosoideae]] of the family [[Fabaceae]], described by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1773 based on the African species ''Acacia nilotica''. Many non-Australian species tend to be [[Thorns, spines and prickles|thorny]], whereas the majority of [[Australia]]n acacias are not. All species are [[Legume|pod]]-bearing, with sap and leaves often bearing large amounts of [[tannin]]s and [[condensed tannin]]s that historically found use as pharmaceuticals and preservatives.

The generic name derives from {{lang|el|ἀκακία}} ({{transl|el|''akakia''}}), the name given by early Greek botanist-physician [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] (middle to late first century) to the medicinal tree ''[[Acacia nilotica|A.&nbsp;nilotica]]'' in his book ''[[Materia medica|Materia Medica]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Acacia-nilotica.htm |title=''Acacia nilotica'' (acacia) |work=Plants & Fungi |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |accessdate=2010-01-28| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100112043913/http://www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Acacia-nilotica.htm| archivedate= 12 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> This name derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for its characteristic thorns, {{lang|el|ἀκίς}} ({{transl|el|''akis''}}; "thorn").<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=esMPU5DHEGgC |first=Umberto |last=Quattrocchi |title=CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names |volume=1 A-C |year=2000 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8493-2675-2 |page=6}}</ref> The species name ''nilotica'' was given by Linnaeus from this tree's best-known range along the [[Nile]] river.

The genus ''Acacia'' previously contained roughly 1300 [[species]], about 960 of them native to Australia, with the remainder spread around the tropical to warm-[[temperate]] regions of both hemispheres, including [[Europe]], Africa, southern [[Asia]], and the [[Americas]]. However, in 2005 the genus was divided into five separate genera under the tribe "[[Acacieae]]." The genus ''Acacia'' was retained for the majority of the Australian species and a few in tropical Asia, [[Madagascar]] and [[Pacific Islands]]. Most of the species outside Australia, and a small number of Australian species, were reclassified into ''[[Vachellia]]'' and ''[[Senegalia]]''. The two final genera, ''[[Acaciella]]'' and ''[[Mariosousa]]'', each contain about a dozen species from the Americas.

This article often describes Acacias in the older, broader sense.

==Classification==
{{see also|List of Acacia species}}
There are over 1,300 species of ''Acacia''. The traditional circumscription is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]]. This discovery has led to the breaking up of ''Acacia'' into five genera, along with the much debated re-typification of the genus with an Australian species instead of the original African type species, an exception to traditional rules of priority that required ratification by the International Botanical Congress.<ref name=Smith>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iapt/tax/2011/00000060/00000005/art00033|author=Gideon F.

Queensland botanist Les Pedley had proposed the subgenus ''Phyllodineae'' be renamed ''[[Racosperma]]'' and published the binomial names.
[[File:Robinia Priverno.JPG|thumb|upright|left|''[[Robinia pseudoacacia]]'' in [[Priverno]], Italy]]
In common parlance, the term "acacia" is occasionally applied to species of the genus ''[[Robinia]]'', which also belongs in the [[pea]] family. ''[[Robinia pseudoacacia]]'', an American species locally known as black locust, is sometimes called "false acacia" in [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and throughout Europe.

==Geography of Australian Acacias==
Acacias in Australia probably evolved their fire resistance about 20 million years ago when fossilised charcoal deposits show a large increase, indicating that fire was a factor even then.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} With no major mountain ranges or rivers to prevent their spread, the wattles began to spread all over the continent as it dried and fires became more common.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} They began to form dry, open forests with species of the genera ''[[Casuarina]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' and ''[[Callitris]]'' (cypress-pines).

The southernmost species in the genus are ''[[Acacia dealbata]]'' (silver wattle), ''[[Acacia longifolia]]'' (coast wattle or Sydney golden wattle), ''[[Acacia mearnsii]]'' (black wattle), and ''[[Acacia melanoxylon]]'' (blackwood), reaching 43°30' S in [[Tasmania]], Australia, while ''[[Acacia caven]]'' (''espinillo negro'') reaches nearly as far south in northeastern [[Chubut Province]] of [[Argentina]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Australian species are usually called wattles, while African and American species tend to be known as acacias.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

''[[Acacia albida]]'', ''[[Acacia tortilis|A.&nbsp;tortilis]]'' and ''[[Acacia iraqensis|A.&nbsp;iraqensis]]'' can be found growing wild in the [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]] desert and the [[Jordan River|Jordan]] valley. It{{clarify|date=November 2011}} is found in the savanna vegetation of the tropical continental climate. It grows wild in Montserrat West Indies; there it is locally referred to as ''cusha''.

==Description==
[[File:Acacia facsiculifera seedling.jpg|thumb|''Acacia facsiculifera'' seedling in the transitional stage between pinnate leaves and phyllodes]]
The leaves of acacias are compound [[pinnate]] in general. In some species, however, more especially in the Australian and [[Pacific islands]] species, the leaflets are suppressed, and the leaf-stalks ([[Petiole (botany)|petioles]]) become vertically flattened, and serve the purpose of leaves. These are known as [[phyllode]]s. The vertical orientation of the phyllodes protects them from intense sunlight, as with their edges towards the sky and earth they do not intercept light so fully as horizontally placed leaves. A few species (such as ''[[Acacia glaucoptera]]'') lack leaves or phyllodes altogether, but possess instead [[wikt:cladode|cladodes]], modified leaf-like [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] stems functioning as leaves.

The small flowers have five very small petals, almost hidden by the long [[stamens]], and are arranged in dense globular or cylindrical clusters; they are yellow or cream-colored in most species, whitish in some, even purple (''Acacia purpureapetala'') or red (''[[Acacia leprosa]]'' 'Scarlet Blaze'). ''Acacia'' flowers can be distinguished from those of a large related genus, ''[[Albizia]]'', by their stamens which are not joined at the base. Also, unlike individual ''[[Mimosa]]'' flowers, those of ''Acacia'' have more than 10 stamens.<ref>{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurcharan|title=Plant Systematics: An Integrated Approach|publisher=Science Publishers|year=2004|page=445|isbn=978-1-57808-351-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=In_Lv8iMt24C}}</ref>

The plants often bear spines, especially those species growing in arid regions. These sometimes represent branches which have become short, hard and pungent, or sometimes leaf-[[stipule]]s. ''[[Acacia armata]]'' is the kangaroo-thorn of Australia and ''[[Acacia erioloba]]'' is the camelthorn of Africa.

Acacia seeds can be difficult to germinate. Research has found that immersing the seeds in various temperatures (usually around 80&nbsp;°C) and manual seed coat chipping can improve yields to approximately 80 percent.<ref>{{cite journal |author=J Clemens, PG Jones, NH Gilbert|date=|year=1977|month=|title=Effect of seed treatments on germination in Acacia|journal=Australian Journal of Botany |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=269–267 |pmid=|doi=10.1071/BT9770269|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/65/paper/BT9770269.htm}}</ref>

==Symbiosis==
[[File:Acacia collinsii3.jpg|thumb|''[[Acacia collinsii]]'' stipules]]
[[File:Acacia drepanolobium MHNT.BOT.2011.3.97.jpg|thumb|Stipules of ''Acacia drepanolobium'' from the [[MHNT]] natural history museum]]
In the [[Central American]] ''[[Acacia sphaerocephala]]'', ''[[Acacia cornigera]]'', and ''[[Acacia collinsii]]'' (collectively known as the ''bullthorn acacias''), the large thorn-like stipules are hollow and afford shelter for several species of [[Pseudomyrmex]] ants, which feed on a secretion of sap on the leaf-stalk and small, [[lipid]]-rich food-bodies at the tips of the leaflets called [[Beltian body|Beltian bodies]]. In return, the [[ant]]s add protection to the plant against [[herbivore]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martin Heil, Sabine Greiner, Harald Meimberg, Ralf Krüger, Jean-Louis Noyer, Günther Heubl, K. Eduard Linsenmair & Wilhelm Boland |year=2004 |title=Evolutionary change from induced to constitutive expression of an indirect plant resistance |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=430 |issue=6996 |pages=205–208 |pmid=15241414 |doi=10.1038/nature02703 |bibcode=2004Natur.430..205H}}</ref> Some species of ants will also fight off competing plants around the acacia, cutting off the offending plant's leaves with their jaws and ultimately killing it. Other associated ant species appear to do nothing to benefit their hosts.

Similar mutualisms with ants occur on ''Acacia'' trees in Africa, such as the [[whistling thorn]] acacia. The acacias provide shelter for ants in the hollow stipules and nectar in extrafloral nectaries for their symbiotic ants such as ''Crematogaster mimosae''. In turn, the ants protect the plant by attacking large mammalian herbivores and stem-boring beetles that damage the plant. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Pests==
In Australia, ''Acacia'' species are sometimes used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of [[Hepialidae|hepialid]] [[moth]]s of the [[genus]] ''[[Aenetus]]'' including ''A.&nbsp;ligniveren''. These burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down. Other [[Lepidoptera]] larvae which have been recorded feeding on ''Acacia'' include [[brown-tail]], ''[[Endoclita|Endoclita malabaricus]]'' and [[Turnip Moth|turnip moth]]. The leaf-mining larvae of some [[Bucculatricidae|bucculatricid]] moths also feed on ''Acacia'': ''Bucculatrix agilis'' feeds exclusively on ''[[Acacia horrida]]'' and ''Bucculatrix flexuosa'' feeds exclusively on ''[[Acacia nilotica]]''.

Acacias contain a number of [[organic compound]]s that defend them from pests and grazing animals.<ref name="chem">{{cite web |url=http://uvalde.tamu.edu/pdf/chemtdaf.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110515034950/http://uvalde.tamu.edu/pdf/chemtdaf.pdf |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |title=Chemistry of Acacia's from South Texas |author=T.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;A.

==Uses==
===Food uses===
[[File:Hauxya Botana.jpg|thumb|Acacia seed pods,{{clarify|reason=what species?|date=November 2011}} also known as Guajes, served as part of a [[botana]] in [[Oaxaca]], Mexico]]
[[Image:Acacia dealbata seeds.jpg|thumb|''[[Acacia dealbata]]'' seeds]]

[[Acacia seed]]s are often used for food and a variety of other products.

In [[Burma]], [[Laos]], and [[Thailand]], the feathery shoots of ''Acacia pennata'' (common name ''cha-om'', ชะอม and ''su pout ywet'' in Burmese) are used in soups, curries, omelettes, and stir-fries.

In [[Mexico]], the seeds are known as ''guajes''. Guajes are the flat, green pods of an acacia tree. The pods are sometimes light green or deep red in color—both taste the same. Guaje seeds are about the size of a small lima bean and are eaten raw with guacamole, sometimes cooked and made into a sauce. They can also be made into fritters. The ground seeds are used to impart a slightly garlicy flavor to a [[mole]] called guaxmole. The dried seeds may be toasted and salted and eaten as a snack referred to as ''cacalas''.

The predominantly herbivorous spider ''[[Bagheera kiplingi]]'', which is found in Central America and Mexico, feeds on nubs at the tips of the acacia leaves, known as Beltian bodies, which contain high concentrations of protein. These nubs are produced by the acacia as part of a symbiotic relationship with certain species of ant, which also eat them.<ref>Meehan, Christopher J.; Olson, Eric J.; Curry, Robert L. (21 August 2008): [http://eco.confex.com/eco/2008/techprogram/P12401.HTM Exploitation of the ''Pseudomyrmex''–''Acacia'' mutualism by a predominantly vegetarian jumping spider (''Bagheera kiplingi'')]. The 93rd ESA Annual Meeting.</ref>

Acacia is listed as an ingredient in many soft drinks<ref name=test>{{cite web|url=https://www.wegmans.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10052&catalogId=1&productId=480288 |title=Powerade Ion4 Sports Drink, B Vitamin Enhanced, Strawberry Lemonade |publisher=Wegmans |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref> and lollies.

===Gum===
Various species of acacia yield gum. True [[gum arabic]] is the product of ''[[Acacia senegal]]'', abundant in dry tropical West Africa from [[Senegal]] to northern [[Nigeria]].

''[[Acacia arabica]]'' is the gum-Arabic tree of [[India]], but yields a gum inferior to the true gum-Arabic.

===Uses in folk medicine===
Acacia species have possible uses in [[folk medicine]]. A 19th-century Ethiopian medical text describes a potion made from an Ethiopian species of Acacia (known as ''grar'') mixed with the root of the ''tacha'', then boiled, as a cure for [[rabies]].<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''An Introduction to the Medical History of Ethiopia'' (Trenton: Red Sea Press, 1990), p. 97</ref>

An [[astringent]] medicine high in [[tannin]]s, called [[catechu]] or cutch, is procured from several species, but more especially from ''[[Acacia catechu]]'', by boiling down the wood and evaporating the solution so as to get an extract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henriettesherbal.com/eclectic/usdisp/uncaria-gamb.html |title=An OCR'd version of the US Dispensatory by Remington and Wood, 1918 |publisher=Henriettesherbal.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/V8879E/v8879e05.htm |title=Cutch and catechu plant origin from the Food and Agriculture (FAO) department of the United Nations. Document repository accessed November 5, 2011}}</ref> The catechu extract from ''Acacia catechu'' figures in the history of chemistry in giving its name to the [[catechin]], [[catechol]] and [[catecholamine]] chemical families ultimately derived from it.

===Ornamental uses===
A few species are widely grown as ornamentals in gardens; the most popular perhaps is ''Acacia dealbata'' (silver wattle), with its attractive glaucous to silvery leaves and bright yellow flowers; it is erroneously known as "mimosa" in some areas where it is cultivated, through confusion with the related genus ''Mimosa''.

Another ornamental acacia is ''[[Acacia xanthophloea]]'' (fever tree).
Southern European florists use ''Acacia baileyana'', ''Acacia dealbata'', ''Acacia pycnantha'' and ''Acacia retinodes'' as cut flowers and the common name there for them is mimosa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewattle.com/schools/uses.php |title=World Wide Wattle |publisher=World Wide Wattle |date=2009-09-07 |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>

Ornamental species of acacia are also used by homeowners and [[landscape architect]]s for home security. The sharp thorns of some species deter unauthorized persons from entering private properties, and may prevent break-ins if planted under windows and near drainpipes. The aesthetic characteristics of acacia plants, in conjunction with their home security qualities, makes them a considerable alternative to artificial fences and walls.

===Paints===
The ancient Egyptians used Acacia in paints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.ca/dp/product-description/0609803670 |title=Excerpt from A Consumer's Dictionary of Cosmetic Ingredients: Fifth Edition (Paperback) Amazon.com |publisher=Amazon.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>

===Perfume===
[[File:Acaciafarnesiana1web.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Acacia farnesiana]]'']]
''[[Acacia farnesiana]]'' is used in the [[perfume]] industry due to its strong fragrance. The use of Acacia as a fragrance dates back centuries.

===Symbolism and ritual===
[[File:Philae Temple Egypt Goddess Isis As Angel Mural Artwork 2004-10-11.jpg|thumb|upright|Egyptian goddess [[Isis]]]]

The Acacia is used as a symbol in [[Freemasonry]], to represent purity and endurance of the soul, and as funerary symbolism signifying resurrection and immortality. The tree gains its importance from the description of the burial of [[Hiram Abiff]], who provided some of the builders for King Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem.<ref>[http://www.bradford.ac.uk/webofhiram/?section=lectures_craft&page=3Lec.html#sectiontwo Web of Hiram (Bradford University)] Craft Lectures, Third Degree, Second Section</ref>

[[Egyptian mythology]] has associated the acacia tree with characteristics of the [[tree of life]], such as in the [[Myth of Osiris and Isis]].

Several parts (mainly bark, root and resin) of Acacia are used to make [[incense]] for rituals. Acacia is used in incense mainly in India, Nepal, and China including in its Tibet region. Smoke from Acacia bark is thought to keep [[demon]]s and [[ghost]]s away and to put the gods in a good mood. Roots and resin from Acacia are combined with [[rhododendron]], [[acorus]], [[cytisus]], [[salvia]] and some other components of incense. Both people and elephants like an alcoholic beverage made from acacia fruit.<ref name="fachforum">[http://web.archive.org/web/20080626102405/http://www.naturheilpraxis.de/exclusiv/nh-online/2005/nhp05/a_nh-ff02.html Naturheilpraxis Fachforum (German)] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref>
According to Easton's Bible Dictionary, the Acacia tree may be the “burning bush” ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 3:2) which [[Moses]] encountered in the desert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eastonsbibledictionary.com/b/bush.htm |title=Easton's Bible Dictionary: Bush |publisher=Eastonsbibledictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref> Also, when God gave Moses the instructions for building the [[Tabernacle]], he said to "make an ark " and "a table of acacia wood" (Exodus 25:10 & 23, [[Revised Standard Version]]). Also, in the Christian tradition, it is thought that Christ's crown of thorns was woven from acacia.<ref>Dictionary of Symbols.Chevalier and Gheerbrant. Penguin Reference.1996.</ref>

In [[Russia]], [[Italy]], and other countries it is customary to present women with yellow mimosas (among other flowers) on [[International Women's Day]] (March 8). These "mimosas" are actually from ''Acacia dealbata'' (silver wattle).

===Tannin===
The bark of various Australian species, known as wattles, is very rich in [[tannin]] and forms an important article of export; important species include ''[[Acacia pycnantha]]'' (golden wattle), ''[[Acacia decurrens]]'' (tan wattle), ''Acacia dealbata'' (silver wattle) and ''Acacia mearnsii'' (black wattle).

Black Wattle is grown in plantations in [[South Africa]] and [[South America]]. Most Australian acacia species introduced to South Africa have become an enormous problem, due to their naturally aggressive propagation{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}. The pods of ''Acacia nilotica'' (under the name of neb-neb), and of other African species are also rich in tannin and used by [[tanning|tanners]].

===Wood===
[[File:Starr 030405-0092 Acacia koa.jpg|thumb|''[[Acacia koa]]'' wood]]
Some ''Acacia'' species are valuable as timber, such as ''Acacia melanoxylon'' (blackwood) from [[Australia]], which attains a great size; its wood is used for furniture, and takes a high polish; and ''Acacia omalophylla'' (myall wood, also Australian), which yields a fragrant timber used for ornaments. ''[[Acacia seyal]]'' is thought to be the [[shittah-tree]] of the [[Bible]], which supplied shittim-wood. According to the Book of Exodus, this was used in the construction of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. ''[[Acacia koa]]'' from the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and ''[[Acacia heterophylla]]'' from [[Réunion]] are both excellent timber trees. Depending on abundance and regional culture, some Acacia species (e.g. Acacia fumosa), are traditionally used locally as firewoods.<ref>{{cite web|author=Maugh, T.H. II |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-tree25-2009apr25,0,402549.story |title=New species of tree identified in Ethiopia |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2009-04-24 |accessdate=2008-04-24}}</ref> It's also used to make homes for different animals.

[[File:Acacia-heterophylla-wood-xup.jpg|thumb|''Acacia heterophylla'' wood]]

===Pulpwood===
In [[Indonesia]] (mainly in [[Sumatra]]) and in [[Malaysia]] (mainly in [[Sabah]]) plantations of ''[[Acacia mangium]]'' are being established to supply [[pulpwood]] to the paper industry.

Acacia gives high opacity and below average bulk [[paper]]. This is suitable in [[Woodfree uncoated paper|lightweight offset papers]] used for bibles and dictionaries. It is also used in paper tissue where it improves softness.

===Land reclamation===
Acacia can be planted for erosion control, especially after mining or construction damage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barr, D. A., and Atkinson, W. J.|date=|year=1970 |month=|title=Stabilization of coastal sands after mining|journal=J. Soil Conserv. Serv. N.S.W. |volume=26 |issue= |pages=89–105. |pmid=|doi=|url=}}</ref>

==Ecological invasion==
For the same reasons it is favored as an erosion-control plant, with its easy spreading and resilience, some varieties of acacia are potentially an invasive species. One of the most globally significant invasive Acacias is black wattle ''Acacia mearnsii'', which is taking over grasslands and abandoned agricultural areas worldwide, especially in moderate coastal and island regions where mild climate promotes its spread. Australian/New Zealand Weed Risk Assessment gives it a "high risk, score of 15" rating and it is considered one of the world's 100 most invasive species.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hear.org/pier/species/acacia_mearnsii.htm |title=Acacia mearnsii (PIER species info) |publisher=Hear.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>
Extensive ecological studies should be performed before further introduction of acacia varieties as this fast-growing Genus, once introduced, spreads fast and is extremely difficult to eradicate.

==Phytochemistry==

===Alkaloids===
As mentioned previously, Acacias contain a number of [[organic compound]]s that defend them from pests and grazing animals.<ref name="chem"/> Many of these compounds are [[psychoactive]] in humans.
The [[alkaloids]] found in Acacias include [[dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT), [[5-MeO-DMT|5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine]] (5-MeO-DMT) and [[N-methyltryptamine]] (NMT). The plant leaves, stems and/or roots are sometimes made into a brew together with some [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOI]]-containing plant and consumed orally for healing, ceremonial or religious uses.

===Cyanogenic glycosides===
Nineteen different species of Acacia in the Americas contain [[glycoside|cyanogenic glycosides]], which, if exposed to an [[enzyme]] which specifically splits glycosides, can release [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN) in the acacia "leaves."<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0038-4909%2819871209%2932%3A4%3C499%3ACGIAOM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z&size=LARGE&origin=JSTOR-enlargePage Cyanogenic Glycosides in Ant-Acacias of Mexico and Central America David S. Seigler, John E. Ebinger The Southwestern Naturalist, Vol. 32, No. 4 (December 9, 1987), pp. 499–503 ] {{doi|10.2307/3671484}}</ref> This sometimes results in the poisoning death of [[livestock]].

If fresh plant material spontaneously produces 200 ppm or more HCN, then it is potentially toxic. This corresponds to about 7.5 μmol HCN per gram of fresh plant material. It turns out that, if acacia "leaves" lack the specific glycoside-splitting enzyme, then they may be less toxic than otherwise, even those containing significant quantities of cyanic glycosides.<ref name="chemotaxonomie">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YpnboQBbw7EC&pg=PA336&lpg=PA336&dq=acacia+tryptamine |title=Chemotaxonomie der Pflanzen By Robert Hegnauer |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 1996-01-01|accessdate=2013-03-06|isbn=9783764351656}}</ref>

Some Acacia species containing cyanogens:

* ''Acacia cunninghamii''
* ''Acacia obtusifolia''
* ''Acacia sieberiana''
* ''Acacia sieberiana'' var. ''woodii''<ref name="juliflora">[http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/ad317e/AD317E05.htm FAO Kamal M. Ibrahim, The current state of knowledge on Prosopis juliflora...] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref>

==Famous acacia==
Perhaps the most famous acacia is the [[Arbre du Ténéré]] in [[Niger]]. The reason for the tree's fame is that it used to be the most isolated tree in the world, approximately {{convert|400|km|0|abbr=on}} from any other tree. The tree was knocked down by a truck driver in 1973.
