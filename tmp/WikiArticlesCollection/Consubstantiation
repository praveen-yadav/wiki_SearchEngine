'''Consubstantiation''' is a theological doctrine that (like [[Transubstantiation]]) attempts to describe the nature of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Eucharist]] in concrete [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] terms. It holds that during the [[sacrament]], the fundamental "[[Substance theory|substance]]" of the body and blood of [[Christ]] are present ''alongside'' the substance of the bread and wine, which remain present. The doctrine of consubstantiation is often held in contrast to the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]]. The adjective ''[[consubstantial]]'' however describes a different theological concept.

The doctrine of consubstantiation is erroneously identified as the eucharistic doctrine of [[Martin Luther]],<ref>F.L. Cross, ed., ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', second edition, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1974), 340 ''sub loco''.</ref> who defined his doctrine as the [[sacramental union]].<ref>''Weimar Ausgabe'' 26, 442; ''Luther's Works'' 37, 299-300.</ref> While some Lutherans believe in consubstantiation, others reject the concept because it substitutes what they believe to be the biblical doctrine with a philosophical construct and implies, in their view, a natural, local inclusion of the body and blood of Christ in the consecrated bread and wine of the eucharist.<ref>J.T. Mueller, <cite>''Christian Dogmatics: A Handbook of Doctrinal Theology''</cite>, (St. Louis: CPH, 1934), 519; cf. also Erwin L. Lueker, <cite>''Christian Cyclopedia''</cite>, (St. Louis: CPH, 1975), under the entry "consubstantiation."</ref>

Literary critic [[Kenneth Burke]]'s dramatism takes this concept and utilizes it in secular rhetorical theory to look at the [[dialectic]] of unity and difference within the context of [[logology]].<ref>http://bradley.bradley.edu/~ell/burke.html</ref>

==History and culture==
In [[England]] in the late 14th century, there was a political and religious movement known as [[Lollardy]]. Among much broader goals, the Lollards affirmed a form of consubstantiationâ€”that the Eucharist remained physically bread and wine, while becoming spiritually the body and blood of Christ. Lollardy survived up until the time of the [[English Reformation]].
