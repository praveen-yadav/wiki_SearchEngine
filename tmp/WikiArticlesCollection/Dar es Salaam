The City of '''Dar es Salaam''' ({{lang-ar|دار السلام}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Dār as-Salām&#x202f;}}'', literally "The abode of peace"), formerly '''Mzizima''', is [[Tanzania]]'s largest and richest city, serving as a regionally important economic centre. The city is located within the [[Dar es Salaam Region]], an administrative province within Tanzania, and consists of three local government areas or administrative districts: northern [[Kinondoni]], central [[Ilala]], and southern [[Temeke]]. The [[Dar es Salaam Region]] had a population of 5,364,541 as of the official 2012 census.<ref name="2012 census">[http://www.nbs.go.tz/sensa/PDF/Census%20General%20Report%20-%2029%20March%202013_Combined_Final%20for%20Printing.pdf Population Distribution by Administrative Units, United Republic of Tanzania, 2013]</ref>{{rp|page: 2}} Though Dar es Salaam lost its official status as capital city to [[Dodoma]] in 1974 (a move not completed until 1996), it remains the locus of the permanent central government bureaucracy, continuing to serve as the capital of the surrounding eponymous region.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Dar es Salaam history}}
[[File:TZ DarEsSalaam StJoseph church.JPG|thumb|200px|Saint Joseph's Metropolitan Cathedral constructed in 1897-1902|left]]

In the 19th century, Mzizima ([[Swahili language|Kiswahili]] for "healthy town") was a coastal fishing village on the periphery of [[Indian Ocean trade]] routes.<ref name=UNHSP>{{Cite book  | last = United Nations Human Settlements Programme | authorlink = United Nations Human Settlements Programme | title = The State of African Cities 2008 | publisher = UN-HABITAT | year = 2009 | pages =130 | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UR0fckrquD8C&pg=PA130 | isbn =92-1-132015-1}}</ref><ref name=Brennan>{{Cite book | last = Brennan | first = James R.  | last2 = Burton | first2 = Andrew | chapter = The Emerging Metropolis: A history of Dar es Salaam, circa 1862–2000 | title = Dar es Salaam: histories from an emerging African metropolis | publisher = African Books Collective | year = 2007 | pages = 13 | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-54DSfk0ZMgC&pg=PA13 | isbn = 9987-449-70-0}}</ref> In 1865 or 1866, Sultan [[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar]] began building a new city very close to Mzizima<ref name=Brennan/> and named it Dar es Salaam. The name is commonly translated as "harbor/haven of peace" or "abode/home of peace", based on the Persian/Arabic ''bandar'' ("harbor") or the Arabic ''dar'' ("house"), and the Arabic ''es salaam'' ("of peace").<ref name=Brennan/> Dar es Salaam fell into decline after Majid's death in 1870, but was revived in 1887 when the [[German East Africa Company]] established a station there. The town's growth was facilitated by its role as the administrative and commercial centre of [[German East Africa]] and industrial expansion resulting from the construction of the Central Railway Line in the early 1900s.

German East Africa was captured by the British during [[World War I]] and from then on was referred to as [[Tanganyika]]. Dar es Salaam was retained as the territory's administrative and commercial centre. Under British [[indirect rule]], separate European (e.g., [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oyster Bay]]) and African (e.g., [[Kariakoo]] and [[Ilala]]) areas developed at a distance from the city centre. The town's population also included a large number of south Asians. After World War II, Dar es Salaam experienced a period of rapid growth.

[[File:Dar es salaam at dawn.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Dar es Salaam, from a bird's-eye view.]]

Political developments, including the formation and growth of the [[Tanganyika African National Union]], led to Tanganyika attaining independence from colonial rule in December 1961. Dar es Salaam continued to serve as its capital, even when in 1964 Tanganyika and [[Zanzibar]] merged to form Tanzania. In 1973, however, provisions were made to relocate the capital to [[Dodoma]], a more centrally located city in Tanzania's interior. The relocation process has not yet been completed, and Dar es Salaam remains Tanzania's primary city.

==Geography==

Dar es Salaam is located at 6°48'&nbsp;South, 39°17'&nbsp;East (−6.8000, 39.2833).<ref>[http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html NGA: Country Files], NGA.mil</ref> The city is situated on a natural harbour on the eastern coast of Africa, with sandy beaches in some areas.

Administratively, the Dar es Salaam region is divided into three districts: [[Ilala]], [[Kinondoni]], and [[Temeke]].

Dar es Salaam is the largest city in Tanzania. With a population increase of 5.6 percent per year from 2002 to 2012, the city has become the third fastest growing in Africa (ninth fastest in the world), after [[Bamako]] and [[Lagos]], respectively. The metro population is expected to reach 5.12 million by 2020.<ref>[http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/urban_growth1.html City Mayors: World's fastest growing urban areas (1)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Economy and infrastructure==
[[File:Bank of Tanzania golden hour.jpg|thumb|[[Bank of Tanzania]]|left]]

Dar es Salaam is Tanzania's most important city for both business and government. The city contains high concentrations of trade and other services and manufacturing compared to other parts of Tanzania, which has about 80 percent of its population in rural areas. Downtown Dar es Salaam includes many small businesses, many of which are run by traders and proprietors whose families originated from the Middle East and Indian sub-continent&nbsp;— areas of the world with which the settlements of the Tanzanian coast have had long-standing trading relations.

[[File:The bird's view of the harbour in Dar es Salaam.jpg|250px|thumb|right]]

Dar es Salaam has a problem with slums. According to a United Nations estimate, 70 percent of the city's population lives in informal settlements.<ref name="Megacity">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18655647 "Dar es Salaam: Africa's next megacity?", ''BBC News'', reported by Joe Boyle, 30 July 2012]</ref> The poorer residents crowd into downtown areas or large slums, many without running water or basic services.<ref name="Megacity"/> The more wealthy live in beachside mansions in the city's northern districts.<ref name="Megacity"/>

Located on a natural harbour on the [[Indian Ocean]], it is the hub of the [[Tanzanian transportation system]] as all of the country's main railways and several of its highways originate in or near the city.

Dar es Salaam has had, in the past few years,{{when|date=June 2013}} a major construction boom. The [[Benjamin William Mkapa Pension Tower]] with more than 21 stories is the tallest building in the city and the country.<ref>[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bu?id=100151 List of tallest buildings in Dar es Salaam]</ref> Dar es Salaam has major infrastructural problems, including an outdated transport system and occasional power rationing.

==Climate==
Because it is located close to the [[equator]] and the warm Indian Ocean, the city experiences generally tropical climatic conditions, typified by hot and humid weather throughout much of the year. Dar es Salaam has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]], with two different rainy seasons. Annual rainfall is approximately {{convert|1100|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and in a normal year there are two distinct rainy seasons: "the long rains", which fall during April and May, and "the short rains", which fall during October and November.

==Transportation==
The [[Julius Nyerere International Airport]] is the principal airport serving the country, named after the country's first [[List of Presidents of Tanzania|President]].

The [[TAZARA Railway]] connects Dar es Salaam to the neighbouring country of Zambia. The [[Central Line (Tanzania)|Central Line]] (Railway) runs west from Dar es Salaam to [[Kigoma]] on [[Lake Tanganyika]] via [[Dodoma]].
{{Wide image|Dar es Salaam Panorama edit2.jpg|3000px|View of Dar es Salaam showing the city center, Posta, and the slums}}

[[Dala dala]]s are used by the majority of the population of Dar es Salaam as a cheap, though often overcrowded, means of public transportation.  These minibuses are operated by both a driver and a conductor.  The conductor collects the fare and signals the driver to leave.  These minibuses tend to be overcrowded with passengers sometimes hanging outside the door.

==Culture==
{{Travel guide|section|date=November 2011}}
{{See also|Culture of Tanzania}}
Dar es Salaam has heavy traffic during the daytime, but after sunset the area is relatively quiet as much of the city's nightlife is located in more residential districts away from the city's mainly commercial centre.

The sprawling suburbs furthest from the city centre are generally populated by Tanzanians of African descent, with the exception of [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oyster Bay]], where there is a large population of foreign expatriates. The edges of Dar es Salaam are spreading rapidly, severely taxing the transportation network (which aside from ferries, lacks any kind of mass transit facilities)<ref>{{cite web | title=A Taxi Ride to the Client Office in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania | url=http://drshem.com/2011/05/30/a-taxi-ride-to-the-client-office-in-dar-es-salaam-tanzania/ | work=A Taxi Ride to the Client Office in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania | accessdate=2011-06-11}}</ref> and raising the prospect of future urban overcrowding.

===Food===
[[File:Ugali with beef and sauce.JPG|right|thumb|[[Ugali]] with beef and sauce]]

{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}

Due in part to the growth of the expatriate community and the increasing importance of tourism, the number of international restaurants has risen very rapidly over recent years. The city now offers a rich and internationalized diversity of cuisine, ranging from traditional [[Tanzanian Barbecue]] style options such as ''Nyama Choma'' (Roasted [[meat]] - served with [[rice]] or [[ugali]]) and ''Mishkaki'' ([[Shish kebab]] - usually barbecued and served with [[salt]], [[Chili pepper|hot peppers]], [[chapati]], [[French fries|fries]], and [[rice]] on the side), and the long-established traditional [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] and [[Zanzibari cuisine]], to options from all corners of the globe including [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]], [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], and [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese food]]. People who prefer neither fast food nor traditional restaurants buy their food from street vendors, who usually sell food at low prices. [[Samosa]]s are common street food items within the city.

===Music===
[[File:The African tranditional dance in Dar es Salaam..jpg|thumb|left|250px|The African tranditional dance in Dar es Salaam.]]

There is also a lively music scene in Dar es Salaam which is divided between several styles. The longest standing segment is live dance music ([[muziki wa dansi]]) bands such as [[DDC Mlimani Park Orchestra]]. [[Taarab]] which was traditionally strong in [[Zanzibar]] has also found a niche but remains small compared both to dance music and "[[Tanzanian hip hop|Bongo Flava]]", a broad category that represents the Tanzanian take on Hip Hop and R&B, which has quickly become the most popular locally produced music. Traditional music, which locally is used to refer to tribal music is still performed but typically only on family oriented occasions such as weddings.

This [[rap music|rap]] scene has been present and growing for the past ten years{{when|date=June 2013}} as city life has drawn much of the youth in surrounding areas have made the trek into a more urban lifestyle in search of a new better beginning.<ref>[http://www.africanhiphop.com/update/halisi.htm Africanhiphop.com presents: Hali Halisi - the Real Situation]</ref>

In the 1970s, the Ministry of National Youth Culture aimed to create a national culture, which stressed the importance of music.  Dar es Salaam became the new music center in Tanzania, with the local radio exposing new bands and dominating the music and cultural scene. With this ujamaa, or family, mentality governing culture and music a unified people’s culture was created. Dar es Salaam became a center of city crime, gangs, and violence, which lead to the rise of hip hop music.<ref name=Lemelle/> Throughout the years, the radio in Dar es Salaam has played a major role in the dissemination of music because many people don’t have televisions and cassettes are used over CDs.

===Tourism===
[[File:Villagemuseum.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Tanzanian hut in the Village Museum]]
Dar es Salaam has two of the five museums comprising the [[National Museum of Tanzania]] consortium, namely the National Museum proper and the Village Museum.  The National Museum is dedicated to the history of Tanzania; most notably, it exhibits some of the bones of ''[[Paranthropus boisei]]'' that were among the findings of [[Louis Leakey]] at [[Olduvai]].  The Village Museum, located in the outskirts of the city on the road to [[Bagamoyo]], showcases traditional [[hut (dwelling)|hut]]s from 16 different Tanzanian ethnic groups.  There are also examples of traditional cultivations, and traditional music and dance shows are held daily.

Close to the National Museum are also the [[botanical garden]]s, with some specimens of tropical plants and trees.

There are beaches on the [[Msasani]] peninsula north of Dar es Salaam and in [[Kigamboni]] to the south where residents and tourists alike frequently visit. Trips to the nearby islands of the  [[Dar es Salaam Marine Reserve]] are a popular daytrip from the city and a favourite spot for snorkeling, swimming and sunbathing.  In addition to that, [[Bongoyo Island]] can be reached by boat from the Msasani Slipway.

==Art==
[[File:Nyumba ya sanaa dar es salaam.jpg|thumb|right|The main gate of Nyumba ya Sanaa, with decorations by Tanzanian sculptor George Lilanga]]
Dar es Salaam (and specifically the area of Oyster Bay) is home to the popular [[Tingatinga (painting)|Tingatinga]] painting style.  The [[Nyumba ya sanaa]] ("House of Art") is a well-known cultural centre, workshop and shop dedicated to Tanzanian art, showcasing and promoting Tanzanian craftmanship.  Prominent Tanzania sculptor [[George Lilanga]] has contributed to the centre some of his works, including decorations of the building's main entrance.

==Sport==
The [[National Stadium (Tanzania)|National Stadium]] hosts Dar es Salaam's [[Young Africans Football Club]], Simba Sports Club, other Tanzanian football clubs, and many other international matches.


===Newspapers===
Dar has a considerable number of newspapers available, particularly from sellers prowling through stationary traffic at road intersections. English-language ones, with online presences, include ''The Citizen'' and ''The Guardian''.

===Internet access===
Installation of a [[SEACOM (African cable system)|trans-Indian Ocean backbone cable]] in 2009 has, in theory, made Internet access much more readily available in Dar in particular and in East Africa in general. However, roll-out to end-users is slow, partly because of spotty telephone line coverage, partly due to the substantial prices and long contracts demanded for purchase of bandwidth for small ISPs. Mobile-telephone access to the Internet via [[3G]] and [[3.75G]] is still relatively expensive.

[[Internet cafes]] are fairly well distributed in the city centre.

The expressed aim of the [[SEACOM (African cable system)|SEACOM cable]] is to enable East Africa to develop economically through increased online trading.

==Globalization==
[[Globalization]] has affected many of the cultural expressions in Dar es Salaam, in particular, hip hop music and culture.  The hip hop scene in Dar es Salaam articulates a blending of local cultural struggles and the indigenization of global influences.<ref name=Lemelle/> Hip hop music and culture arrived in [[Tanzania]], taking its cues from various African American styling.

Dar es Salaam, a city projected to have over 5 million inhabitants within the next decade, continues to be the one city in Tanzania to which villagers flock for better opportunities. Westerners and Asians are also settling in Dar es Salaam, and the surge of foreigners has put pressure on Dar es Salaam officials to implement laws better accommodating the growing diverse population of Dar es Salaam and its suburbs.

==Safety==
{{Refimprove|date=February 2012}}

[[Safety]] has become a noticeable feature in Dar es Salaam and many other [[Tanzanian]] cities. Dar es Salaam is one of the safest large cities in [[East Africa]]. Homicides are rare, even in the poor areas of Dar es Salaam. Chain snatching is relatively common in the [[Kariakoo]] area. Although pickpockets frequent the [[City Centre]] and [[dala-dala]]s and prey especially on foreigners, there are rarely reports of violent crimes.

==Education==
[[File:Nkrumah.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Nkrumah Hall at the [[University of Dar es Salaam]]]]
Dar es Salaam is also the educational centre of [[Tanzania]]. The city is home to many Educational Institutions.

===Universities===
* The [[University of Dar es Salaam]] is the oldest and 2nd largest public university in Tanzania after University of Dodoma. It is located in the western part of the city, occupying {{convert|1,625|acre|km2}} on the observation hill, {{convert|13|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city centre.

==Suburbs==
Dar es Salaam is divided into three districts: Ilala, Kinondoni, and Temeke. All three are governed as municipal councils, and so all of the city's suburbs or wards are affiliated with them.

===Kinondoni===
Kinondoni is the most populated amongst the districts, with half of the city's population residing within it. It is also home to many of the high-income suburbs. These include:

* '''Masaki, [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oysterbay]] and [[Ada Estate]]''' are the posh suburbs located along the central beach. During the Colonial Era, they were the major European suburbs of the city. Now, similarly, many diplomats and expatriates reside in these areas.  Oysterbay Beach, also known as Coco Beach, is the only white sandy beach in Kinondoni and is the most famous in the area. Many newly built luxury apartments line the waterfront, accommodating the rapid growth of foreigners, mostly Europeans and Asians.

* '''Mikocheni and Regent Estate''' are also suburbs within the district. According to the 2012 census, the Mikocheni ward had a population of 32,947.<ref name="2012 census"/>{{rp|page: 75}} Mikocheni is the home of some major political figures, including the first president of Tanzania, [[Julius K. Nyerere]].

* '''[[Msasani]]''' is a peninsula to the northeast of the city center. It is home to many of the expatriates from the United Kingdom and other western countries that live in Dar es Salaam. Msasani contains a mixture of traditional shops and western-oriented resorts and stores.

* '''Mbezi Beach''' is the beachfront suburb located along the northern Dar es Salaam Beach. It is noted for its beautiful beaches with several tourist hotels, and also as the place of residence of many people of high social status and some politicians.

* '''Sinza, Kijitonyama, Magomeni, [[Kinondoni]] and [[Mwenge, Dar es Salaam|Mwenge]]''' are more ethnically mixed than the areas mentioned above. These were perhaps the earliest African suburbs to be occupied. The wards also have the most prosperous business climate outside of the central business district, with many shops, bars, restaurants and inexpensive hotels located here.

* '''Kimara and Mbezi Louis''' are hilly, mostly middle and upper class, suburbs far from the city. Due to the distance from the city center, it is quieter, with cooler weather.

* '''Manzese, Tandale, Mwananyamala-Kisiwani and Kigogo''' are considered low-income neighborhoods characterized by poor settlement planning, low quality housing and social services.

===Ilala===
[[File:Askari monument dar es salaam.jpg|thumb|right|The Askari Monument marks the exact center of Dar es Salaam, in the Ilala district]]
Ilala is the administrative district of the city where almost all government offices and ministries are housed. The Central Business District (locally called "Posta") is also located in this district. Furthermore, it is the transportation hub of the city, as the Julius Nyerere International Airport, Central Railway Station and Tazara Railway Station are all within the district boundaries. The residential areas are mainly middle to high-income, and some of these are:

* '''Upanga & Kisutu''' have the highest concentration of Asian communities within Dar es Salaam, with many residents of Indian and Arabian descent. These areas are also famous for the many colonial houses and mansions built in Indian, Arabic and European styles.

* '''[[Kariakoo]]''' is the shopping district of the city, perhaps the busiest and largest in East Africa. Many shops, bazaars and merchants dot the streets, selling a variety of products, from foodstuffs to hardware materials. The Kariakoo Market, which is the largest, contains the only underground section of the city. It is the major supply point of the food consumed by all the residents of Dar es Salaam.

* '''Tabata, Segerea and Ukonga''' located a bit far from the city center, these suburbs are growing to become among the busiest in terms of business and entertainment. This has caused serious traffic congestion, which is said to be the worst in all of Dar es Salaam.

* '''Ilala''' this is also among the middle income suburbs, very near to the city center, marked by the [[Askari Monument]] and contains some rival gang groups in the city and suburb areas.Most of the gang activities include drugs trafficking,money laundry,extortion and racketeering.
Most famous gang groups are recognised by the color of the scarf(bandanna).These are the black gang,red gang and blues gang fighting for control and to maintain their territories and interests.

===Temeke===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kivukoni ferries.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kivukovi ferries]] -->

Temeke is the industrial district of the city, where the main manufacturing centers (with both heavy and light industries) are located. The Dar es Salaam Port, which is the largest in the country, is also found here. Temeke is believed to have the largest concentration of low-income residents due to industry. Also, many port officials, military and police officers live here.

*'''Kurasini''' located right on the Dar es Salaam Harbour, is the home of the Dar es Salaam Port, The Police College, Mgulani Police Barracks and the Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair Grounds. Thus, the main residents are police officers and port officials.

*'''Chang'ombe''', this suburb is one of the only higher income areas in Temeke. It has maintained this status due to occupation by African high colonial officers and some industry owners from the colonial era. Chang'ombe is also the home of the Dar es Salaam University College of Education, The National Stadium and Uhuru Stadium.

*'''Temeke, Mtoni and Tandika''' are middle to low-income suburbs.

* '''Mbagala and Kijichi''' also are middle to low-income suburbs where Mbagala is the Largest suburb in the whole district, and is also considered a slum.

* '''Kigamboni (South Beach)''' is a beach front suburb on a peninsula with very beautiful, sandy beaches. It is home to a mixed population of lower and higher incomes. There is demand from higher-income people to live in Kigamboni due to its low population density and proximity to the sea, but this demand is constrained by the area being mainly accessible by ferry involving long waiting times for those wishing to cross in a private vehicle, although crossing the ferry on foot or bicycle is quite quick.  There are several popular beach resorts in Kigamboni.
