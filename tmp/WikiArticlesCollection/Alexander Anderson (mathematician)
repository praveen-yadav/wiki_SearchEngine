'''Alexander Anderson''' (c. 1592, [[Aberdeen]] &ndash; c. 1620, [[Paris]]) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[mathematician]].  He was the son of David Anderson of Finshaugh.  His sister was Janet Anderson, the mother of the celebrated [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]].  In his youth he went to the [[Mainland Europe|continent]] and taught mathematics in Paris, where he published or edited, between the years 1612 and 1619, various [[geometric]] and [[algebra]]ic tracts.

He was selected by the executors of [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]] to revise and edit Viete's manuscript works. The works of Anderson amount to six thin quarto volumes, and as the last of them was published in 1619, it is probable that the author died soon after that year, but the precise date is unknown.
