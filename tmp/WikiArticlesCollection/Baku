'''Baku''' ({{lang-az|Bakı}}, {{IPA-tr|bɑˈcɯ|IPA}}) is the capital and largest city of [[Azerbaijan]], as well as the largest city on the [[Caspian Sea]] and of the [[Caucasus]] region. Baku is located 28 meters below [[sea level]], which makes it the lowest lying national capital in the world. Baku is also the largest city in the world located below sea level. It is located on the southern shore of the [[Absheron Peninsula]], which projects into the [[Caspian Sea]]. The city consists of two principal parts: the downtown area and the old [[Old City (Baku)|Inner City]] (21.5 [[hectare|ha]]). At the beginning of 2009, Baku's [[urban population]] was estimated at just over two million people.<ref name="pop">{{cite web

Baku is divided into [[Baku#Governance|eleven administrative districts]] (raions) and 48 townships. Among these are the townships on islands in the [[Bay of Baku|Baku Bay]] and the town of [[Oil Rocks]] built on stilts in the [[Caspian Sea]], {{convert|60|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away from Baku. The Inner City of Baku along with the [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs|Shirvanshah's Palace]] and [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]] were inscribed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 2000.

The city is the scientific, cultural and industrial center of Azerbaijan.

==Etymology==

The name Baku is widely believed to be derived from the old [[Persian language|Persian]] names of the city باد-کوبه ''Bād-kube'', meaning "Wind-pounded city", in which ''bād'' means "wind" and ''kube'' is rooted in the verb کوبیدن ''kubidan'', "to pound", thus referring to a place where wind is strong and pounding.<ref name="Web.archive.org">{{cite web|url=http://iranchamber.com/podium/culture/020920_politicizing_linguistics.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071013212555/http://iranchamber.com/podium/culture/020920_politicizing_linguistics.php |archivedate=13 October 2007 |title=Culture & Religion on Podium: Politicizing Linguistics |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=25 July 2009}}</ref> Indeed, the city is renowned for its fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds. This is also reflected in the city's nickname as the "[[City of Winds]]". A less probable [[folk etymology]] explains the name as deriving from ''Baghkuy'', meaning "God's town". ''Baga'' (now ''بغ'' ''bagh'') and ''kuy'') are the [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] words for "god" and "town" respectively; the name ''Baghkuy'' may be compared with ''[[Baghdad|Baghdād]]'' ("God-given") in which ''dād'' is the Old Persian word for "give". [[Arabic language|Arabic]] sources refer to the city as ''Baku'', ''Bakukh'', ''Bakuya'', and ''Bakuye'', all of which seem to come from a Persian name.

Various different politically motivated hypotheses have been also proposed to explain the etymology of the word ''Baku'' to suit a given political agenda . According to L.G.Lopatinski<ref>Ган К.Ф. Oпыть объяснения кавказских географических названий. Тифлис, 1909</ref> and Ali Huseynzade,<ref name="autogenerated1">.[http://window2baku.com/eng/9002toponimbaku.htm The Name “Baku”]</ref> for example, ''Baku'' is derived from [[Turkic language|Turkic]] word for "hill". Caucasian history specialist [[Kerope Patkanov]] also explains the name as "hill" but in the [[Lak language]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The Turkish ''Islamic Encyclopedia'' presents the origin of the word ''Baku'' as being derived from the words ''Bey-Kyoy'', which mean "the main city" in Turkic. Another theory suggests that the name Baku is derived from the ancient [[Caucasian Albania]]n city which was called Baguan.

The first written evidence for Baku dates to the 1st century AD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-AzerbaijanBaku.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080102011734/http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-AzerbaijanBaku.htm|archivedate=2 January 2008 |title=Azerbaijan – Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace...|accessdate=14 October 2007}}</ref>

The city became important after an earthquake destroyed [[Şamaxı|Shamakhy]] in the 12th century, when the ruling [[Shirvanshah]], [[Akhsitan I ibn Minuchihr III|Akhsitan I]], chose Baku as the new capital. In 1501, [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] [[Ismail I|Shah Ismail I]] laid siege to Baku. At this time the city was enclosed within the lines of strong walls, which were washed by the sea on one side and protected by a wide trench on land. In 1540 Baku was again captured by the Safavid troops. In 1578 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] captured Baku and held to till 1603, when it was again put under Persian control.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=ottoman+empire+captured+baku&source=bl&ots=8s-Ic6Pf7p&sig=nOe15LuG88LoalmhJBRjKX2xtGo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ekyWUsvNHsbMkQez8YH4AQ&ved=0CF4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=ottoman%20empire%20captured%20baku&f=false</ref> In 1604 the Baku fortress was destroyed by Safavid Shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]].

On 26 June 1723, after a long siege and cannon fire, Baku surrendered to the Russians. According to [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]'s decree the soldiers of two regiments (2,382 people) were left in the Baku garrison under the command of Prince Baryatyanski, the commandant of the city. In 1795, Baku was invaded by [[Mohammad Khan Qajar|Agha Muhammad Khan]] Qajar to defend against [[tsar]]ist Russia's ambitions to subjugate the South Caucasus. In the spring of 1796, by [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]]'s order, General Zubov's troops began a major campaign in Transcaucasia. Baku surrendered after the first demand of Zubov, who had sent 6,000 troops to capture the city. On 13 June 1796 the Russian flotilla entered Baku Bay and a garrison of Russian troops was placed in the city. General [[Pavel Tsitsianov]] was appointed Baku's commandant. Later, however, Czar [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] ordered him to cease the campaign and withdraw Russian forces. In March 1797 the tsarist troops left Baku, but a new tsar, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], began to show a special interest in capturing Baku. In 1803, Tsitsianov reached an agreement with the Baku khan to a compromise, but the agreement was soon annulled. On 8 February 1806, upon the surrendering of Baku, [[Baku Khanate|Huseyngulu khan]] of Baku stabbed and killed Tsitsianov at the gates of the city.

In 1813, Russia signed the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] with Persia, which provided for the cession of Baku and most of the [[Caucasus]] from [[Iran]] and their annexation by Russia.

[[File:102 329 nobel oilwells.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nobel Brothers]]' oil wells in [[Balaxanı|Balakhani]], a suburb of Baku, in the late 19th century]]
Professor A. V. Williams Jackson of Columbia University wrote in his work ''From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam'' (1911):

''Baku is a city founded upon oil, for to its inexhaustible founts of naphtha it owes its very existence, its maintenance, its prosperity.... At present Baku produces one-fifth of the oil that is used in the world, and the immense output in crude petroleum from this single city far surpasses that in any other district where oil is found. Verily, the words of the Scriptures find illustration here: 'the rock poured me out rivers of oil.'''

''Oil is in the air one breathes, in one's nostrils, in one's eyes, in the water of the morning bath (though not in the drinking water, for that is brought in bottles from distant mineral springs), in one's starched linen – everywhere. This is the impression one carries away from Baku, and it is certainly true in the environs.''<ref>Abraham Valentine Williams Jackson. {{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/fromconstantino00jackgoog#page/n10/mode/2up|title=From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam|publisher=The Macmillan Company, 1911, p. 25|accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Oldbaku (2).jpg|thumb||Baku in 1960's]]

The first [[oil well]] was mechanically drilled in the [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque|Bibi-Heybat]] suburb of Baku in 1846, though a number of hand-dug wells predate it. Large-scale oil exploration started in 1872, when Russian imperial authorities auctioned the parcels of oil-rich land around Baku to private investors. Within a short period of time Swiss, British, French, Belgian, German, Swedish and American investors appeared in Baku. Among them were the firms of the [[Robert Nobel|Nobel brothers]] together with the family [[Schuch|von Börtzell-Szuch]] (Carl Knut Börtzell, who also owned the [[Livadia Palace]]) and the [[Rothschild family]]. An industrial oil belt, better known as Black City, was established near Baku. By the beginning of the 20th century almost half of world production was being extracted in Baku.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.window2baku.com/eng/9001history_3.htm |title=Window2Baku.com |publisher=Window2Baku.com |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref>

In 1917, after the [[October Revolution|October revolution]] and amidst the turmoil of World War I and the breakup of the [[Russian Empire]], Baku came under the control of the [[26 Baku Commissars|Baku Commune]], which was led by veteran Bolshevik [[Stepan Shahumyan|Stepan Shaumyan]]. Seeking to capitalize on the existing inter-ethnic conflicts, by spring 1918, Bolsheviks inspired and condoned civil warfare in and around Baku. During the infamous [[March Days]], Bolsheviks and [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaks]] seeking to establish control over the Baku streets, were faced with armed Muslim groups. Muslims suffered a crushing defeat by the united forces of the Baku Soviet and were massacred by Dashnak teams. On 28 May 1918, the Azerbaijani faction of the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Sejm]] proclaimed the independent [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] (ADR) in [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]]. Shortly after, Azerbaijani forces, with support of the [[Ottoman Army of Islam]] led by [[Nuri Killigil|Nuru Pasha]], started their advance into Baku, eventually capturing the city from the loose coalition of [[Bolshevik]]s, [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Esers]], [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaks]], [[Menshevik]]s and British forces under the command of General [[Lionel Dunsterville]] on 15 September 1918. Baku became the capital of the ADR. On 28 April 1920, the [[11th Army (Soviet Union)|11th Red Army]] invaded Baku and reinstalled the Bolsheviks, making Baku the capital of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]].

During [[Case Blue|the continuing Nazi German invasion of the southwestern Soviet Union]], capturing the [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan#World War II|oil fields of Baku]] would have been one of the ultimate goals of [[Operation Edelweiss]], carried out between May and November 1942.  The German Army's closest approach to Baku was no closer than some {{convert|530|km|0|abbr=off}} northwest of Baku in November 1942, falling far short of the city's capture before being driven back during the Soviet [[Operation Little Saturn]] in mid-December 1942.

With the initiatives for saving the city in the 21st century, Baku embarked on a process of restructuring on a scale unseen in its history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Money from oil changes the face of Azerbaijan|url=http://news.az/articles/society/41029|publisher=news.az|accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> Thousands of buildings from Soviet period were demolished to make way for a green belt on its shores; parks and gardens were built on the land reclaimed by filling up the beaches of the [[Baku Bay]]. Improvements were made in the general cleaning, maintenance, and garbage collection, and these services are now at Western European standards. The city is growing dynamically and developing at full speed on an east-west axis along the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]].

==Geography==
[[File:Baku, Azerbaijan, satellite image, LandSat-5, 2010-09-06.jpg|thumb|Greater Baku satellite image, [[Landsat 5]], 6 September 2010]]
Baku is situated on the western coast of [[Caspian Sea]]. In the vicinity of the city there are a number of [[mud volcano]]es (Keyraki, Bogkh-bogkha, [[Lokbatan]] and others) and [[salt lake]]s ([[Lake Boyukshor|Boyukshor]], Khodasan and so on).

===Climate===
Baku has a [[subtropical]] [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''BSk'') with warm and dry summers, cool and occasionally wet winters, and strong winds all year long. However, unlike many other cities with this climate, Baku does not see extremely hot summers. This is largely because of its northerly [[latitude]] and the fact that it is located on a peninsula on the shore of the Caspian Sea.
Baku and the [[Absheron Peninsula]] on which it is situated, is the most arid part of Azerbaijan ([[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] here is around or less than {{convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} a year). The majority of the light annual precipitation occurs in seasons other than summer, but none of these months are particularly wet.
During Soviet times, Baku with its long hours of sunshine and dry healthy climate, was a vacation destination where citizens could enjoy beaches or relax in now-dilapidated [[destination spa|spa]] complexes overlooking the Caspian Sea. The city's past as a Soviet industrial center has left it as one of the most polluted cities in the world.<ref name="ForbesPollution">{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2008/02/26/pollution-baku-oil-biz-logistics-cx_tl_0226dirtycities.html |title=The World's Dirtiest Cities |work=Forbes |author=Tiffany M.

At the same time Baku is noted as a very windy city throughout the year, hence the city's nickname the "[[City of Winds]]", and gale-force winds, the cold northern wind ''[[khazri]]'' and the warm southern wind ''[[gilavar]]'' are typical here in all seasons. Indeed, the city is renowned for its fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds.<ref name="Web.archive.org"/>
The speed of the ''khazri'' sometimes reaches 144 kph (89&nbsp;mph), which can cause damage to crops, trees and roof tiles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.global-ict.mincom.gov.az/aboutazerb.php |title=Global ICT Conference : 25–28, November, 2004 : Baku, Azerbaijan |publisher=Global-ict.mincom.gov.az |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref>

The daily mean temperature in July and August averages {{convert|26.4|°C|°F}}, and there is very little rainfall during that season. During summer the ''khazri'' sweeps through, bringing desired coolness. Winter is cool and occasionally wet, with the daily mean temperature in January and February averaging {{convert|4.3|°C|°F}}. During winter the ''khazri'' sweeps through; driven by [[air mass|masses of polar air]]; temperatures on the coast frequently drop below freezing and make it feel bitterly cold. Winter [[Winter storm|snow storms]] are occasional, [[snow]] usually remains only for a few days after each snowfall.

The average annual temperature in Baku and that of the Earth differ by less than {{convert|0.1|C-change|2|abbr=on}} : it is {{convert|14.2|°C|°F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.window2baku.com/eng/9000capital.htm |title=Window to Baku |publisher=Window2baku.com |accessdate=17 April 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100510014037/http://www.window2baku.com/eng/9000capital.htm| archivedate= 10 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Until 1988 Baku had very large Russian, Armenian, and Jewish populations which contributed to [[cultural diversity]] and added in various ways (music, literature, architecture and progressive outlook) to Baku's history. With the onset of the [[Karabakh War]] and the [[Pogrom of Armenians in Baku|pogrom against Armenians]] starting in January 1990, the city's large Armenian population was expelled.<ref>Azerbaijan: The status of Armenians, Russians, Jews and other minorities, report, 1993, INS Resource Informacion Center, p.10</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-44300/Azerbaijan#481451.hook |title=Azerbaijan – The Soviet and post-Soviet periods |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref>
Under Communism, the Soviets took over the majority of Jewish property in Baku and Kuba. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, [[President of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani President]] [[Heydar Aliyev]] returned several synagogues and a Jewish college, nationalized by the Soviets, to the Jewish community. He encouraged the restoration of these buildings and Is well liked by the Jews of Azerbaijan. Renovation has begun on seven of the original 11 synagogues, including the Gilah synagogue, built in 1896, and the large Kruei Synagogue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Azerbaijan.html |title=JewishVirtualLibrary.org |publisher=JewishVirtualLibrary.org |date=10 July 2006 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref>

===Ethnic groups===
Today the vast majority of the population of Baku are ethnic [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] (more than 90%). The intensive growth of the population started in the middle of the 19th century when Baku was a small town with a population of about 7,000 people. The population increased again from about 13,000 in the 1860s to 112,000 in 1897 and 215,000 in 1913, making Baku the largest city in the Caucasus region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-946.html |title=Country-data.com |publisher=Country-data.com |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref>

Baku has been a cosmopolitan city at certain times during its history, meaning ethnic Azerbaijanis did not constitute the majority of population.<ref>Audrey Altstadt, Conflict, Cleavage, and Change in Central Asia and the Caucasus, [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997, p. 112, table 4.1, Ethnic composition of Baku, 1897, 1903,1913</ref> In 2003 Baku additionally had 153,400 [[internally displaced person]]s and 93,400 refugees.<ref>{{ru icon}}{{cite web|url=http://www.baku-online.com/ru/baku.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070701132551/http://www.baku-online.com/ru/baku.htm|archivedate=1 July 2007|title=Баку|accessdate=15 July 2007}}</ref>

===Religion===
[[File:Bibi Heybat Mosque Baku 1.jpg|thumb|right|The 13th century [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque]]. The mosque was built over the tomb of a descendant of the Prophet [[Muhammad]].<ref name="Bibi">{{cite web|last=Sharifov|first=Azad|title=Legend of the Bibi-Heybat Mosque|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/63_folder/63_articles/63_bibiheybat.html|publisher=Azerbaijan International Magazine|accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref>]]

The urban landscape of Baku is shaped by many communities. The religion with the largest community of followers is Islam. The majority of the Muslims are [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]], and the Republic of Azerbaijan has the second highest Shia population percentage in the world after [[Iran]].<ref>Juan Eduardo Campo,''Encyclopedia of Islam'', p.625</ref> [[Zoroastrianism]] had a long history in Azerbaijan, evident in sites such as the [[Fire Temple of Baku]]<ref>Meena Iyer, ''Faith & philosophy of Zoroastrianism'' (2009), p.323</ref> or ceremonies like [[Nowruz]], along with [[Manichaeism|Manichean]]. The city's notable mosques include [[Juma Mosque (Baku)|Juma Mosque]], [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque]], [[Muhammad Mosque (Baku)|Muhammad Mosque]] and [[Taza Pir Mosque]].

There are some other faiths practiced among the different ethnic groups within the country. By article 48 of its [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]], Azerbaijan is a [[secular state]] and ensures religious freedom. Religious minorities include [[Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox Christians]], [[Levant|Catholic Levantines]], [[Azerbaijani Jews|Ashkenazi]] Jews and [[Sufi]] Muslims.

==Economy==
[[File:Logo oilfund.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The [[State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan|State Oil Fund]] manages the financial assets generated by oil exploration and development in [[Azerbaijan]].<ref name="swfinstitute.org">{{cite web

Baku's largest industry is petroleum, and its petroleum exports make it a large contributor to Azerbaijan's [[balance of payments]]. The existence of petroleum has been known since the 8th century. In the 10th century, the Arabian traveler, Marudee, reported that both white and black oil were being extracted naturally from Baku.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/22_folder/22_articles/22_historyofoil.html |title=The History of Oil in Azerbaijan by Natig Aliyev |publisher=Azer.com |accessdate=22 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090424163308/http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/22_folder/22_articles/22_historyofoil.html| archivedate= 24 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> By the 15th century, oil for lamps was obtained from hand-dug surface wells.
Commercial exploitation began in 1872, and by the beginning of the 20th century the [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|Baku oil fields]] were the largest in the world. Towards the end of the 20th century much of the onshore petroleum had been exhausted, and drilling had extended into the sea offshore. By the end of the 19th century [[skilled worker]]s and specialists flocked to Baku. By 1900 the city had more than 3,000 oil wells, of which 2,000 were producing oil at industrial levels. Baku ranked as one of the largest centres for the production of [[Petroleum industry|oil industry]] equipment before World War II. The World War II [[Battle of Stalingrad]] was fought to determine who would have control of the Baku oil fields. Fifty years before the battle, Baku produced half of the world's oil supply.<ref>{{cite news|last=Aghazade|first=Emil|title=Азербайджан: сто лет надежд|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/business/newsid_4649000/4649873.stm|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=12 May 2011|date=4 July 2005}}</ref>

Currently the oil economy of Baku is undergoing a resurgence, with the development of the massive [[Azeri–Chirag–Guneshli|Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli]] field (Shallow water Gunashli by [[State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic|SOCAR]], deeper areas by a consortium led by [[BP]]), development of the [[Shah Deniz gas field]], the expansion of the [[Sangachal Terminal]] and the construction of the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline|BTC Pipeline]].

The [[Baku Stock Exchange]] is Azerbaijan's largest [[stock exchange]], and largest in the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] region by [[market capitalization]]. A relatively large number of transnational companies are headquartered in Baku. One of the more prominent institutions headquartered in Baku is the [[International Bank of Azerbaijan]], which is run by [[Jahangir Hajiyev|Dr. Jahangir Hajiyev]] and employs over 1,000 people. International banks with branches in Baku include [[HSBC]], [[Société Générale]] and [[Credit Suisse]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Abdullayev|first=Rovshan|title=Which foreign banks has Azerbaijan capital been trusted in? |url=http://www.nhmt-az.org/ts_general/eng/news/n-6.htm|accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref>

===Tourism and shopping===
Baku is one of the most important tourist destinations in the Caucasus, with hotels in the city earning 7 million euros in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://azerbaijan24.com/component/content/article/1-latest-news/224-hotels-in-baku.html |title=Hotels in Baku earned 6,8 million euros last year |publisher=Azerbaijan24.com |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref> Many sizable world [[hotel chain]]s have a presence in the city. Baku has many popular tourist and entertainment spots, such as the downtown [[Fountains Square, Baku|Fountains Square]], the One and Thousand Nights Beach, [[Shikhov Beach]] and [[Oil Rocks]]. Baku's vicinities feature [[Yanar Dag]], an ever-blazing spot of natural gas. On 2 September 2010, with the inauguration of [[National Flag Square]], Baku became home to the world's tallest [[flagpole]], according to the [[Guinness Book of Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Azerbaijani flag flies on world's tallest flagpole |url=http://news.az/articles/22041 |publisher=news.az |accessdate=2 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100904092905/http://www.news.az/articles/22041| archivedate= 4 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=İşte dünyanın en yüksek bayrak direği |url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25128411/ |language=Turkish |publisher=ntvmsnbc.com |accessdate=2 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100904080023/http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25128411/| archivedate= 4 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture in Baku|Inner City (Baku)|Palace of the Shirvanshahs|Maiden Tower (Baku)}}

Baku has wildly varying architecture, ranging from the [[Old City (Baku)|Old City]] core to modern buildings and the spacious layout of the Baku port. Many of the city's most impressive buildings were built during the early 20th Century, when architectural elements of the European styles were combined in [[eclecticism|eclectic]] style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/24_folder/24_articles/24_architecture.html |title=Baku's Architecture:A Fusion of East and West |publisher=Azer.com |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref> Baku thus has an original and unique appearance, earning it a reputation as the 'Paris of the East'.<ref>[http://www.window2baku.com/006development.htm Архитектурное развитие города] {{ru icon}}</ref>

Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the early 2000s. With economic development, old buildings such as Atlant House were razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells have appeared around the city, the most prominent examples being the [[Azerbaijan Tower]], [[Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center]], [[Flame Towers]], [[Baku Crystal Hall]], [[Baku White City]] and [[SOCAR Tower]]. These projects also caught the attention of international media as notable programs such as [[Discovery Channel]]'s [[Extreme Engineering]] did pieces focusing in on changes to the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center And Flame Towers|url=http://science.discovery.com/tv/build-bigger/projects/azerbaijan/heydar-aliyev-cultural-center.html|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref>

The Old City of Baku, also known as the Walled City of Baku, refers to the ancient Baku settlement. Most of the walls and towers, strengthened after the Russian conquest in 1806, survived. This section is picturesque, with its maze of narrow alleys and ancient buildings: the cobbled streets past the [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs]], two [[Caravanserai|caravansaries]], the baths and the [[Juma Mosque (Baku)|Juma Mosque]] (which used to house the [[Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum|Azerbaijan National Carpet and Arts Museum]] but is now a mosque again). The old town core also has dozens of small mosques, often without any particular sign to distinguish them as such.

In 2003, UNESCO placed the Inner City on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]], citing damage from a [[2000 Baku earthquake|November 2000 earthquake]], poor conservation as well as "dubious" restoration efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/958 |title=Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |accessdate=22 May 2009}}</ref>

===Parks and gardens===
[[File:Park in Nərimanov raion, Baku, 2010.jpg|thumb|Park in Baku]]

Baku has large sections of greenery either preserved by the National Government or designated as green zones. The city, however, continues to lack a green belt development as economic activity pours into the capital, resulting in massive housing projects along the suburbs.<ref>[http://www.all-pages.com/city_info/3/45/426/4667.html Экология и охрана окружающей среды в Азербайджане] {{ru icon}}</ref>

[[Baku Boulevard]] is a pedestrian promenade that runs parallel to Baku's seafront. The boulevard contains an amusement park, [[yacht club]], [[musical fountain]], statues and monuments. The park is popular with dog-walkers and joggers, and is convenient for tourists. It is adjacent to the newly built [[International Mugam Center of Azerbaijan|International Center of Mugham]] and the musical fountain.

Other prominent parks and gardens include Heydar Aliyev Park, Samad Vurgun Park, Narimanov Park, [[Alley of Honor]] and the [[Fountains Square, Baku|Fountains Square]]. The [[Martyrs' Lane]], formerly the Kirov Park, is dedicated to the memory of those who lost their lives during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] and also to the 137 people killed on [[Black January]].

===Nightlife===
Baku boasts a vibrant nightlife. Many clubs that are open until dawn can be found throughout the city. Clubs with an eastern flavor provide special treats from the [[cuisine of Azerbaijan]] along with local music. Western-style clubs target younger, more energetic crowds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelandmarkhotel.az/site/?sec=mdata&mid=49&lang=2 |title=About Baku and Azerbaijan |publisher=Thelandmarkhotel.az |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref> Most of the [[public house]]s and bars are located near [[Fountains Square, Baku|Fountains Square]] and are usually open until the early hours of the morning.

Baku is home to restaurants catering to every cuisine and occasion. Restaurants range from luxurious and expensive to ordinary and affordable.<ref>{{cite web|author=M |url=http://t-i.ifrance.com/az-food.html |title=Food and Restaurants in Azerbaijan and Baku |publisher=T-i.ifrance.com |accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref>

===Music and media===
[[File:Pht-Vugar Ibadov eurovision (31).jpg|thumbnail|[[Baku Crystal Hall]] during [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]]]]

The music scene in Baku can be traced back to ancient times and villages of Baku, generally revered as the fountainhead of [[meykhana]] and [[mugham]] in the Azerbaijan.<ref>[http://www.baki-xeber.com/new/2009/06/22/get=29330 "Meyxana", ya "bədihə" sözü aləmi bir-birinə qatıb] {{az icon}}</ref><ref>[http://e-library.musigi-dunya.az/sonoteka/son_garabah_text_az3.html QARABAĞ MUĞAM MƏKTƏBİ ] {{az icon}}</ref>

==Transport==
[[File:Bakutaxi.jpg|thumb|Baku [[black cab]], introduced in 2011]]
Throughout history the transport system of Baku used the now-defunct [[horsecar]]s, trams and [[narrow gauge railways]]. As of 2011, 1000 [[Hackney carriage|black cabs]] are ordered by Baku Taxi Company, and as part of a programme originally announced by the Transport Ministry of Azerbaijan, there is a plan to introduce London cabs into Baku.<ref>{{cite news|last=Meidment|first=Neil|title=Manganese Bronze seals biggest London taxi order|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/03/us-manganese-bronze-idUSTRE7225WO20110303|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=4 March 2011|date=3 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Jaglom|first=Ben|title=Manganese takes black cab to Azerbaijan|url=http://www.growthcompany.co.uk/news/1607588/manganese-takes-black-cab-to-azerbaijan.thtml|accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref> The move was part of £16 million agreement between [[Manganese Bronze]] and Baku Taxi Company.<ref>{{cite web|title=1,000 London taxis for Azerbaijan|url=http://business.scotsman.com/business/1000-London-taxis-for-Azerbaijan.6728118.jp|accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=British firm wins £16m Azerbaijan order for its Chinese built taxis|url=http://www.worksmanagement.co.uk/article/31946/British-firm-wins-16m-Azerbaijan-order-for-its-Chinese-built-taxis.aspx|accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref>

The Baku Port was founded in 1902 and since then has been the largest Caspian Sea port. It has six facilities: the main cargo terminal, the container terminal, the ferry terminal, the oil terminal, the passenger terminal and the port fleet terminal. The port's throughput capacity reaches 15 million [[ton]]s of liquid bulk and up to 10 million tons of dry cargoes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bakuseaport.az/eng.html|title=Baku Sea Port|publisher=Bakuseaport.az|accessdate=7 March 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080416011348/http://www.bakuseaport.az/eng.html| archivedate= 16 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
Beginning in 2010, the [[Baku International Sea Trade Port]] is being reconstructed. The construction will take place in three stages and will be completed by 2016. The estimated costs are 400 Million US$.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m-hesse.com/Aserbaidschan_Reisebericht.html|title=Azerbaijan, Baku|publisher=m-hesse.com|accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref> From April to November the Baku Port is accessible to ships loading cargoes for direct voyages from Western European and Mediterranean ports.

The State Road M-1 and the [[European route E60]] are the two main motorway connections between Europe and Azerbaijan. The motorway network around Baku is well developed and is constantly being extended.

The [[Heydar Aliyev International Airport]] is the only commercial airport serving Baku. The new [[Baku Cargo Terminal]] was officially opened in March 2005. It was constructed to be a major cargo hub in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries and is actually now one of the biggest and most technically advanced in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/baku/ |title=Heydar Aliyev International Airport (BAK/UBBB), Baku, Azerbaijan |publisher=Airport-technology.com |accessdate=17 April 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100312085043/http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/baku/| archivedate= 12 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> There are also several smaller [[military airbase]]s near Baku, such as [[Baku Kala Air Base]], intended for private aircraft, [[helicopter]]s and charters.<ref>[http://az.apa.az/print.php?id=146672 Fevralın 14-ü Azərbaycan Hərbi Hava Qüvvələrinin (HHQ) yaranma günüdür] {{az icon}}</ref>

==Public services==

===Education===
{{See also|List of universities in Baku}}

Baku hosts many universities, junior colleges and vocational schools. [[Baku State University]], the first established university in Azerbaijan was opened in 1919 by the government of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. In the early years of the Soviet era, Baku already had [[Azerbaijan State Oil Academy]], [[Azerbaijan Medical University]] and [[Azerbaijan State Economic University]]. In the post-WWII period, a few more universities were established such as [[Azerbaijan Technical University]], [[Azerbaijan University of Languages]] and the [[Azerbaijan Architecture and Construction University]]. After 1991 when Azerbaijan gained independence from the Soviet Union, the fall of communism led to the development of a number of private institutions, including [[Qafqaz University]] and [[Khazar University]] which are currently considered the most prestigious academic institutions. Apart from the private universities, the government established the [[Academy of Public Administration (Azerbaijan)|Academy of Public Administration]], the [[Azerbaijan Diplomatic Academy]] and various military academies. The largest universities according to the student population are Baku State University and Azerbaijan State Economic University. In addition, there are the [[Baku Music Academy]] and the Azerbaijan National Conservatoire in Baku established in early 1920s. Publicly run kindergartens and elementary schools (years 1 through 11) are operated by local wards or municipal offices.

The [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]], the main state research organization in Azerbaijan is locating in Baku as well. Moreover, Baku has numerous libraries, many of which contain vast collections of historic documents from the Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and Soviet periods, as well as from other civilisations of the past. The most important libraries in terms of historic document collections include the [[Nizami Museum of Azerbaijan Literature]], the [[National Library of Azerbaijan]], the Mirza Alakbar Central Library, the Samad Vurgun Library and the Baku Presidential Library.

===Health care===
The city has many public and private hospitals, clinics and laboratories within its bounds and numerous medical research centers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan: Energy-Rich, Healthcare-Poor|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav073008af.shtml|publisher=Eurasianet.org|accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> Many of these facilities have [[high tech]]nology equipment, which has contributed to the recent upsurge in "[[medical tourism]]" to Baku, particularly from post-Soviet countries such as [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Moldova]], whose governments send lower-income patients to the city for inexpensive high-tech medical treatments and operations.
