After the second terminal of International Airport Sofia was built the total number of passengers rose and reached 3 230 696 in 2008, and in April 2011 Airport Sofia serviced 282 694 passengers, 13% more than the same period of 2009, when the record was 250 000 passengers.<ref>[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=128293 Sofia Airport Serviced Record Number of Passengers April 2011], Sofia News Agency, May 16, 2011</ref> In 2011 passenger traffic at Bulgaria's three major airports - Sofia, Varna and Bourgas - grew up to near 10% on the year to 3.89 million in the first half of 2011, due to rise of customers using international routes and launch of new destinations.<ref>[http://sofiaecho.com/2011/08/18/1140858_passenger-traffic-at-bulgarias-major-airports-grows-10per-cent-yy-in-h1-2011 Passenger traffic at Bulgaria's major airports grows 10% Y/Y in H1 2011], The Sofia Echo, August 18, 2011</ref>

In the past aviation compared with road and railroad transport used to be a minor mode of freight movement, and only 860,000 passengers used Bulgarian airlines in 2001.<ref name=cp15/> In 2008 Bulgaria had 204 airports, 127 of which had paved runways.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bu.html CIA World Factbook Bulgaria]</ref> Two airports, [[Sofia Airport]] and [[Burgas Airport]], had a runway longer than 3,000 meters, and there were four heliports.<ref name=cp15/> The second- and third-largest airports, [[Varna Airport]] and [[Burgas Airport]], serve mainly charter flights and have regular domestic links with the capital.<ref name=cp15/> In the early 2000s, Sofia Airport received substantial renovation, with aid from a [[Kuwait]]i-led consortium, in anticipation of increased air connections with Europe.<ref name=cp15/> A three-phase expansion was scheduled for completion in 2010.<ref name=cp15/> The communist-era state airline, [[Balkan Airlines]], was replaced by [[Bulgaria Air]], for which a private owner was to be selected from among bidders by the end of 2006.<ref name=cp15/>{{Update after|2010|11|13}} In 2005 Bulgaria Air transported 517,000 passengers to international destinations, including all major European cities<ref name=cp15>Bulgaria country profile, p. 15.</ref>

Bulgaria's rail system has not expanded since the 1980s, but there are upgrading projects underway.<ref name=cp14>Bulgaria country profile, p. 14.</ref> After the completion of the Plovdiv - Dimitrovgrad [[high-speed rail|high-speed line]] on 1 July 2012 the top operating speed was raised to 200&nbsp;km/h and the national top speed record of 197&nbsp;km/h set between Iskar and Elin Pelin with a leased [[Siemens]] Taurus electric locomotive is soon expected to be broken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dariknews.bg/view_article.php?article_id=925916 |title=The trains from Plovdiv to Dimitrovgrad now with 160 km/h |publisher=Dariknews.bg|language=Bulgarian |accessdate=3 July 2012}}</ref> There are also plans for upgrading for high speed operation and doubling (where needed) of the [[Plovdiv]] - [[Burgas]] railway. By the end of 2013, a total of 461&nbsp;km of [[high-speed rail|high-speed lines]] are expected to be built.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/bulgaria-to-turkey-wiring-underway.html |title=Bulgaria to Turkey wiring underway |publisher=Railway Gazette International|accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://paper.standartnews.com/bg/article.php?d=2011-08-05&article=377091 |title=Божков строи жп "Марица" |newspaper=Standart |language=Bulgarian |accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snews.bg/bg/statiya/vlakat-plovdiv-burgas-shte-leti-s-200-km-ch:10592 |title=Влакът Пловдив-Бургас ще лети с 200 км/ч |publisher=Snews.bg|language=Bulgarian |accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref>

In the mid-2000s, railways remained a major mode of freight transportation, but with increasing problems with the maintenance of the infrastructure and lowering speeds, highways carried a progressively larger share of freight.<ref name=cp14/> The national passenger and freight operator is called [[Bulgarian State Railways]], but there are also a number of private operators including Bulgarian Railway Company and [[DB Schenker]] Rail Bulgaria.

=== Sofia Metro ===
{{Main|Sofia Metro}}
In 1998 the first six kilometers of an often-interrupted 52-kilometer standard gauge subway project ([[Sofia Metro]]) opened in Sofia.<ref name=cp14/> Additional stations were built later, and in 2012 a second line has been added.  Total length reached 31&nbsp;km with 27 stations.

== Roads ==

{{double image|right|Bulgarian motorway network en.svg|230|SAM_8605.JPG|210|Road map|Trakia motorway at [[Nova Zagora]]}}
Building new highways is one of the top goals of the 2009 elected government of [[Boyko Borisov]], therefore new roads and highways are regularly opened for use.

In the early 2000s, Bulgaria had some 37,300 kilometers of roads, all but 3,000 of which were paved but nearly half of which (18,000 kilometers) fell into the lowest international rating for paved roads. 324 kilometers of high-speed highways were in service in 2005. As of Sept 2012, 571 kilometers are in service. Roads have overtaken the railroads as the chief mode of freight transportation. 

Long-term plans call for upgrading higher-quality roads and integrating the road system into the European grid. The focus is on improving road connectors with Turkey and Greece and domestic connections linking Sofia, Plovdiv, and Burgas. Bulgaria has delayed building some key highway connections since the 1990s, but European Union membership is a strong incentive for completion. The National Strategy for Integrated Infrastructure Development calls for construction of 720 kilometers of new highways by 2015. A 114-kilometer link between eastern Bulgaria and the Turkish border is scheduled for completion in 2013. As of 2004, two international highways passed through Bulgaria, and a major highway ran from Sofia to the Black Sea coast. Proposed international corridors would pass from north to south, from Vidin to the border with Greece and from Ruse to the border with Greece, and west to east, from Serbia through Sofia to Burgas, Varna, and Edirne (Turkey). A new bridge link with Romania is scheduled for completion in 2012, relieving road and railroad congestion in that direction.<ref name=cp14/>

== Timetables ==
Civil transportation is well developed in Bulgaria. There are several big [[Coach (scheduled transport)|coach]] companies, which control the market for intercity travel, and hundreds of small ones (one bus = one company), which operate between the smaller towns. The main problem with so many companies is how to find their timetables. Recently the project "bgrazpisanie" (BG timetable in English) succeeded to collect all Bulgarian civil transportation timetables on its website www.BGrazpisanie.com [http://bgrazpisanie.com]

== Waterways ==
*470&nbsp;km (2006); major river is [[Danube]] and also includes [[Maritsa]] and [[Iskar (river)|Iskar]].

== Pipelines ==
In 2005 Bulgaria had 2,425 kilometers of natural gas pipelines, 339 kilometers of oil pipelines, and 156 kilometers of pipelines for refined products.<ref name=cp14/> The pipeline system was scheduled for substantial changes and additions, however.<ref name=cp14/> The 279-kilometer Burgas-Alexandroupolis Pipeline, still under negotiation among Bulgaria, Greece, and Russia in 2006, would provide a bypass of the overloaded Bosporus Strait.<ref name=cp14/> The line would enable Russian oil arriving at the Bulgarian oil port of Burgas to reach Greece’s Mediterranean port at Alexandroupolis.<ref name=cp14/> A 900-kilometer U.S.- financed alternate route, known as the AMBO pipeline, would bring oil from Burgas across Bulgaria and Macedonia to the Albanian port of Vlore on the Adriatic Sea, bypassing both the Bosporus and Greece.<ref name=cp14/> As of October 2006, approval of both pipelines was expected.<ref name=cp14/>{{Update after|2010|11|13}} With international investment, Bulgaria began constructing a new domestic gas transportation network beginning in 2005.<ref name=cp14/> The Russian Gazprom company planned a gas pipeline from Dimitrovgrad in eastern Bulgaria across Serbia, reaching the Adriatic Sea in Croatia.<ref name=cp14/> Some 400 kilometers of the planned [[Nabucco Pipeline]], bringing gas from Azerbaijan and Iran to Central Europe, were to cross Bulgaria sometime before 2011.<ref name=cp14/>

== Ports and harbours ==

=== River ports ===
[[Rousse]], [[Vidin]], [[Lom, Bulgaria|Lom]], [[Silistra]], [[Tutrakan]], [[Svishtov]], [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]] and [[Oryahovo]] are river ports on the [[Danube]] river.

== Urban Transport ==
{{see also|Sofia Public Transport}}
While most urban and suburban transport in Bulgaria is composed of [[bus]]es (using an increasing number of [[compressed natural gas|CNG]] vehicles), around a dozen cities also have [[trolley bus]] networks. The capital Sofia also has a [[tram]] and an [[Sofia Metro|underground]] network.
