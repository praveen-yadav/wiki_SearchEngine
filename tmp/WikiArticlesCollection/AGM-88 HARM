The '''AGM-88 High-speed [[Anti-radiation missile|Anti-Radiation Missile]]''' ('''HARM''') is a tactical, [[air-to-surface missile]] designed to home in on electronic transmissions coming from surface-to-air [[radar]] systems. It was originally developed by [[Texas Instruments]] as a replacement for the [[AGM-45 Shrike]] and [[AGM-78 Standard ARM]] system. Production was later taken over by [[Raytheon Corporation]] when it purchased the defense production business of Texas Instruments.

==Description==
The AGM-88 can detect, attack and destroy a radar antenna or transmitter with minimal aircrew input. The proportional guidance system that homes in on enemy radar emissions has a fixed antenna and seeker head in the missile's nose. A smokeless, solid-propellant, [[dual-thrust|booster-sustainer]] [[rocket motor]] propels the missile at speeds over [[Mach number|Mach]] 2. HARM, a Navy-led program, was initially integrated onto the [[A-6 Intruder|A-6E]], [[A-7 Corsair II|A-7]] and [[F/A-18]] and later onto the [[EA-6B]]. RDT&E for use on the F-14 was begun, but not completed. The Air Force introduced HARM on the [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4G]] [[Wild Weasel]] and later on specialized [[F-16]]s equipped with the [[HARM Targeting System]] (HTS).

==History==
{{expand section|Development history is missing and later history is thin on details|date=September 2012}}

===Deployment===
The HARM missile was approved for full production in March 1983, and then deployed in late 1985 with [[Attack Squadron 72 (U.S. Navy)|VA-72]] and [[Attack Squadron 46 (United States Navy)|VA-46]] aboard the aircraft carrier [[USS America (CV-66)|USS ''America'']]. It was soon used in combat—in March 1986 against a [[Libyan Army (1951–2011)|Libyan]] [[S-200 Angara/Vega/Dubna|SA-5]] site in the [[Gulf of Sidra]], and then [[Bombing of Libya (1986)|Operation Eldorado Canyon]] in April. HARM was used extensively by the [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Air Force]] for Operation Desert Storm during the [[Gulf War]] of 1991.

During the Gulf War, the HARM was involved in a friendly fire incident when the pilot of an [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4G]] Wild Weasel escorting a [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bomber mistook the latter's tail gun radar for an Iraqi [[antiaircraft artillery|AAA]] site. (This was after the tail gunner of the B-52 had targeted the F-4G, mistaking it for an Iraqi [[MiG]].)  The F-4 pilot launched the missile and then saw that the target was the B-52, which was hit.  It survived with shrapnel damage to the tail and no casualties. The B-52 was subsequently renamed ''In HARM's Way''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lake|first=Jon|title=B-52 Stratofortress Units in Operation Desert Storm|year=2004|publisher=Osprey|location=Oxford|isbn=1-84176-751-4|pages=47–48|edition=1}}</ref>

This technique would also be employed in Serbia during air operations in 1999.

In 2013 President Obama offered the AGM-88 to Israel for the first time.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2013/07/01/Israel-seeks-50B-in-US-loans-to-buy-arms/UPI-49641372706630/ "Israel seeks $5B in U.S. loans to buy arms."]</ref>

===AGM-88E AARGM===

The newest upgrade is a joint venture by the Italian Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense: the ''AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile'' (''AARGM''), produced by [[Alliant Techsystems]].

In November 2005, the Italian Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense signed a Memorandum of Agreement on the joint development of the AGM-88E AARGM missile. Italy was providing $20 million of developmental funding as well as several millions worth material, equipment and related services. The Italian Air Force was expected to procure up to 250 missiles for its Tornado ECR aircraft. Thus flight test program was set to integrate the AARGM onto Tornado ECR's weapon system.

The AARGM features the latest software, enhanced capabilities intended to counter radar shutdown and passive radar using an additional active millimeter wave seeker. It was released in November 2010.

The Navy demonstrated the AARGM's capability during Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) in spring 2012 with 12 live firing of the missiles.  Aircrew and maintenance training with live missiles were completed in June.  The Navy authorized Full-Rate Production (FRP) of the AARGM in August 2012, with 72 missiles for the Navy and nine for the [[Italian Air Force]] to be delivered in 2013.  A U.S. Marine Corps [[F/A-18 Hornet]] squadron will be the first forward-deployed unit with the AGM-88E.<ref>[http://www.strategicdefenceintelligence.com/article/0K5agW2Wpdg/2012/08/30/us_navy_authorises_frp_of_aargm_missile/ Navy Approves Full Rate Production for New Anti-Radiation Missile] - Strategicdefenseintelligence.com, August 30, 2012</ref>

It will be initially integrated onto the FA-18C/D, FA-18E/F, EA-18G, and Tornado ECR aircraft and later on the [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/21/idUS152956+21-Jan-2009+PRN20090121 |title=ATK Awarded $55 Million Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile Low Rate Initial Production... |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2011-07-13}}</ref>

In September 2013, ATK delivered the 100th AARGM to the U.S. Navy.  The AGM-88E program is on schedule and on budget, with Full Operational Capability (FOC) planned for September 2014.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atk-delivers-100th-advanced-anti-radiation-guided-missile-aargm-to-us-navy-224053301.html ATK Delivers 100th Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM) to U.S. Navy] - PRNewswire.com, 17 September 2013</ref>
