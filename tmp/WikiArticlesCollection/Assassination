An assassination may be prompted by religious, [[ideology|ideological]], political, or military motives; it is an act that may be done for [[contract killing|financial gain]], to [[revenge|avenge]] a grievance, from a desire to acquire [[celebrity|fame]] or [[infamy|notoriety]], or because of a military or security services command to carry out the murder.

==Etymology==
{{Main|Hashshashin}}
[[Image:Asabah2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The word "assassin" was derived from [[Hasan-i Sabbah]] and his [[Assassins|Assassin's Order]] of Nizari Ismailism.]]
The word ''assassin'' is often believed to derive from the word ''[[Hashshashin]]'' (Arabic: حشّاشين, ħashshāshīyīn, also Hashishin, Hashashiyyin, or Assassins),<ref>American Speech'' – McCarthy, Kevin M. Volume 48, pp. 77–83</ref>  and shares its etymological roots with ''[[hashish]]'' ({{IPAc-en|h|æ|ˈ|ʃ|iː|ʃ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|ʃ|iː|ʃ}}; from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|حشيش}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḥashīsh}}'').<ref name="The Assassins: a radical sect in Islam">''The Assassins: a radical sect in Islam'' – Bernard Lewis, pp. 11–12</ref> It referred to a group of [[Nizari]] [[Shia]] [[Arabs]] who worked against various [[Persian people|Persian]] targets.

Founded by an [[Arab]]ian [[Hassan-i Sabbah]], the Assassins were active in the fortress of [[Alamut]] in Iran from the 8th to the 14th centuries, and also controlled the castle of [[Masyaf]] in Syria. The group killed members of the [[Persian people|Persian]], [[Abbasid]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]], and [[Christian]] [[Crusades|Crusader]] élite for political and religious reasons.<ref>Secret Societies Handbook, Michael Bradley, Altair Cassell Illustrated, 2005. ISBN 978-1-84403-416-1</ref>

Although it is commonly believed that Assassins were under the influence of [[hashish]] during their killings or during their indoctrination, there is debate as to whether these claims have merit, with many Eastern writers and an increasing number of Western academics coming to believe that drug-taking was not the key feature behind the name.<ref name="C:AH">{{cite book| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=O7AoY6ljSygC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cannabis:+A+History#v=onepage&q=hashishiyya&f=false | author= Martin Booth | title= Cannabis: A History |year= 2004 | publisher= Macmillan| isbn = 9780312424947}}</ref> The earliest known literary use of the word ''assassination'' is in ''[[Macbeth]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] (1605).<ref>"Assassination."

The word for "[[murder]]" in many [[romance language]]s is derived from this same root word (see [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''asesinato'', [[French (language)|French]] ''assassinat'').

==Use in history==
{{Main|History of assassination}}

===Ancient to medieval times===
[[File:Jacques Clément.jpg|thumb|left|Assassination of King [[Henry III of France]]]]
Assassination is one of the oldest tools of [[power politics]].  It dates back at least as far as recorded history.

The [[Old Testament]] story of [[Book of Judith|Judith]] illustrates how a woman frees the Israelites by tricking and assassinating [[Holofernes]], a warlord of the rival [[Assyria]]ns, with whom the Israelites were at war. King [[Jehoash of Judah|Joash]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] was recorded as being assassinated by his own servants;<ref>2 Kings 12:19-21</ref> [[Joab]] assassinated [[Absalom]], [[King David]]'s son;<ref>2 Samuel 3:26-28 RSV</ref> and King [[Sennacherib]] of Assyria was assassinated by his own sons.<ref>2 Chronicles 32:21</ref>

[[Chanakya]] (c. 350–283 BC) wrote about assassinations in detail in his political treatise ''[[Arthashastra]]''. His student [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of the [[Maurya Empire]], later made use of assassinations against some of his enemies, including two of [[Alexander the Great]]'s generals, [[Nicanor (satrap)|Nicanor]] and [[Philip (son of Machatas)|Philip.]]<ref>{{cite journal | first = Roger | last = Boesche | year = 2003 | month = January | title = Kautilya's ''Arthaśāstra'' on War and Diplomacy in Ancient India | journal = The Journal of Military History | volume = 67 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–37 | doi = 10.1353/jmh.2003.0006 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/journal_of_military_history/v067/67.1boesche.pdf}}</ref> Other famous victims are [[Philip II of Macedon]] (336&nbsp;BC), the father of Alexander the Great, and Roman consul [[Julius Caesar]] (44&nbsp;BC).<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=kloWAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=famous+assassinations#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Famous assassinations of history ... |publisher= |date=March 3, 2008 |accessdate=October 27, 2010|author1=Johnson|first1=Francis}}</ref> [[Emperors of Rome]] often met their end in this way, as did many of the Muslim [[Shia Imam]]s hundreds of years later. The practice was also well known in ancient China, as in [[Jing Ke]]'s failed assassination of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] king [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]] in 227&nbsp;BC.

[[File:Gerson Assassination of Przemysł II.jpg|thumb|Assassination of King [[Przemysł II]] of Poland]]

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[regicide]] was rare in Western Europe, but it was a recurring theme in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].  Blinding and strangling in the bathtub were the most commonly used procedures. With the [[Renaissance]], [[tyrannicide]]—or assassination for personal or political reasons—became more common again in Western Europe. High medieval sources mention the assassination of King [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] (1089), dying at the hands of his own people, who objected to a proposition by the Pope to go on a campaign to aid the [[Byzantine]]s against the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] Turks. This account is, however, contentious among historians, it being most commonly asserted that he died of natural causes. The myth of the "Curse of King Zvonimir" is based on the legend of his assassination.<ref>[http://www.ffzg.hr/pov/pov2/files/3zavod/radovi38/nemet38.pdf FFZG.hr]</ref> In 1192, [[Conrad of Montferrat]], the ''[[de facto]]'' [[King of Jerusalem]], was killed by an [[Assassins|assassin]].

The reigns of King [[Przemysł II]] of Poland (1296), [[William the Silent]] of the Netherlands (1584), and the French kings [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (1589) and [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (1610) were all ended by assassins.

===Modern history===
In the modern world, the killing of important people began to become more than a tool in power struggles between rulers themselves and was also used for political symbolism, such as in the [[propaganda of the deed]]. In [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] alone, two emperors,  [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] and [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], were assassinated within 80 years.

During the 1930s and 1940s [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[NKVD]] carried out numerous assassinations outside of the Soviet Union, such as the killings of [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] leader [[Yevhen Konovalets]], [[Ignace Poretsky]], [[Fourth International]] secretary Rudolf Klement, [[Leon Trotsky]], and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification ([[POUM]]) leadership in [[Catalonia]].<ref>Michael Ellman.

[[Liaquat Ali Khan]], the first [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], was assassinated by [[Saad Akbar]], a lone assassin, in 1951. Conspiracy theorists believe his conflict with certain members of the Pakistani military (Rawalpindi conspiracy) or suppression of Communists and antagonism towards the [[Soviet Union]], were potential reasons for his assassination.

His assassination was carried out by renegade soldiers who were apparently revenging the killing of General [[Tagme Na Waie]], the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Guinea Bissau, who had been killed in a bomb explosion the day before.

==Further motivations==

===As military doctrine===
{{See also|Manhunt (military)}}

Assassination for military purposes has long been espoused – [[Sun Tzu]], writing around 500&nbsp;BC, argued in favor of using assassination in his book ''[[The Art of War]]''. Nearly 2000 years later, in his book ''[[The Prince]]'', [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] also argued assassination could be useful.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} An army and even a nation might be based upon and around a [[cult of personality|particularly strong, canny, or charismatic leader]], whose loss could paralyze the ability of both to make war.

[[File:Hokusai-sketches---hokusai-manga-vol6-crop.jpg|thumb|160px|The functions of the [[ninja]] included espionage and assassination.]]
There is also the risk that the target could be replaced by an even more competent leader, or that such a killing (or a failed attempt) will "[[martyr]]" a leader and lead to greater support of his or her cause (by showing the moral ruthlessness of the assassins). Faced with particularly brilliant leaders, this possibility has in various instances been risked, such as in the attempts to kill the Athenian [[Alcibiades]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. A number of additional examples from [[World War II]] show how assassination was used as a military tool at both tactical and strategic levels:
* The American interception of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Isoroku Yamamoto's]] plane during World War II, after his travel route had been decrypted.
* The American perception that [[Otto Skorzeny|Skorzeny's]] [[commando]]s were planning to assassinate [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] during the [[Battle of the Bulge]] played havoc with Eisenhower's personal plans for some time, though it did not affect the battle itself. In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'',{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Skorzeny denied that he had ever intended to assassinate Eisenhower during [[Operation Greif]], and said that he could prove it.<ref name="Skor">''Commando Extraordinary'' – Foley, Charles; Legion for the Survival of Freedom, 1992, page 155</ref>
* [[Operation Gaff]] was a planned British commando raid to capture or kill the German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] (also known as "The Desert Fox").<ref name="Skor"/>

Use of assassination has continued in more recent conflicts:
* During the [[Vietnam War]], partly in response to [[Viet Cong]] assassinations of government leaders, the U.S. engaged in the [[Phoenix Program]] to assassinate Viet Cong leaders and sympathizers, and killed between 6,000 and 41,000 persons, with official 'targets' of 1,800 per month.

===As tool of insurgents===
Insurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. Assassinations provide several functions for such groups, namely the removal of specific enemies and as propaganda tools to focus the attention of media and politics on their cause.

The [[Irish Republican Army]] guerrillas of 1919–21 killed many [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]] Police Intelligence officers during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] set up a special unit – [[The Squad (IRA unit)|the Squad]] – for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad's activities peaked with the killing of 14 British agents in [[Dublin]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1920.

This tactic was used again by the [[Provisional IRA]] during [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland (1969–1998). Killing of [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] officers and assassination of RUC politicians was one of a number of methods used in the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997]]. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] by bombing the Conservative Party Conference in a [[Brighton]] hotel. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitaries]] retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating [[Irish nationalist]] politicians.

[[Basque people|Basque]] terrorists [[ETA]] in Spain have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], 1st Duke of Carrero-Blanco Grandee of Spain, in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them.

The [[Red Brigades]] in Italy carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the [[Red Army Faction]] in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.

In the [[Vietnam War]], Communist insurgents routinely assassinated government officials and individual civilians deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Diem]] regime to collapse before the U.S. intervention.<ref>''Viet Cong'' – Pike, Douglas, The MIT Press; New Ed edition, Wednesday December 16, 1970</ref>

==Psychology==
A major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that most prospective assassins spend copious amounts of time planning and preparing for their attempts. Assassinations are thus rarely a case of 'impulsive' action.<ref name="SS"/>

However, about 25% of the actual attackers were found to be [[delusion]]al, a figure that rose to 60% with 'near-lethal approachers' (people apprehended before reaching their target). This shows that while mental instability plays a role in many modern-age assassinations, the more delusional attackers are less likely to succeed in their attempt. The report also found that around two-thirds of attackers had previously been arrested (not necessarily for related offenses), that 44% had a history of serious depression, and that 39% had a history of substance abuse.<ref name="SS"/>

==Techniques==

===Ancient methods===
[[File:Amanita phalloides 1.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Death cap]] mushrooms]]
It seems likely that the first assassinations would have been direct and simple: [[stabbing]], [[strangle|strangling]] or [[bludgeon (weapon)|bludgeoning]].  The key technique was likely [[Infiltration tactics|infiltration]], with the actual assassination by stabbing, [[smothering]] or [[strangulation]]. [[Poison]]s also started to be used in many forms.

[[Death cap]] mushrooms and similar plants became a traditional choice of assassins especially if they could not be perceived as poisonous by taste, and the symptoms of the poisoning did not show until after some time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In ancient Rome, paid mobs were sometimes used to beat political enemies to death.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Modern methods===

With the advent of effective [[ranged weaponry]], and later [[firearm]]s, the position of an assassination target was more precarious. [[Bodyguard]]s were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to directly engage or even subvert the guard to kill the leader in question. Moreover, the engagement of targets at greater distance dramatically increased the chances of an assassin's survival.  The first heads of government to be assassinated with a firearm were the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Regent Moray of Scotland]] in 1570, and [[William the Silent]], the Prince of Orange of the Netherlands in 1584.  [[Gunpowder]] and other explosives also allowed the use of bombs or even greater concentrations of explosives for deeds requiring a larger touch.

Explosives, especially the [[car bomb]], become far more common in modern history, with [[grenade]]s and remote-triggered [[land mine]]s also used, especially in the Middle East and Balkans (the initial attempt on [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]'s life was with a grenade). With heavy weapons, the [[rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG) has become a useful tool given the popularity of armored cars (discussed below), while Israeli forces have pioneered the use of aircraft-mounted missiles,<ref>''[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/17/mideast.violence/index.html Hamas leader killed in Israeli airstrike]'' – [[CNN]], Saturday April 17, 2004</ref> as well as the innovative use of explosive devices.

[[File:Oswaldrifle.jpg|thumb|Rifle of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the assassin of President [[John F. Kennedy]]]]
[[File:Booth deringer.jpg|thumb|[[Derringer]] of [[John Wilkes Booth]], the assassin of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]
A [[sniper]] with a precision rifle is often used in fictional assassinations. However, certain difficulties attend long-range shooting, including finding a hidden shooting position with a clear line-of-sight, detailed advance knowledge of the intended victim's travel plans, the ability to identify the target at long range, and the ability to score a first-round lethal hit at long range, usually measured in hundreds of meters.

Despite their comparative disadvantages, [[handgun]]s are more easily concealable, and consequentially much more commonly used than rifles. Of 74 principal incidents evaluated in a major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century, 51% were undertaken by a handgun, 30% with a rifle or shotgun, 15% used knives, and 8% explosives (usage of multiple weapons/methods was reported in 16% of all cases).<ref name="SS"/>

In the case of state-sponsored assassination, poisoning can be more easily denied. [[Georgi Markov]], a [[Bulgaria]]n dissident was assassinated by [[ricin]] poisoning. A tiny pellet containing the poison was injected into his leg through a specially designed [[Bulgarian umbrella|umbrella]]. Widespread allegations involving the Bulgarian government and [[KGB]] have not led to any legal results. However, it was learned that after fall of the USSR, the KGB had developed an umbrella that could inject ricin pellets into a victim, and two former KGB agents who defected said the agency assisted in the murder.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/story/2007/01/070117_markov.shtml The case of the poisoned umbrella].

==Targeted killing==
{{Main|Targeted killing}}
[[File:MQ-1 Predator unmanned aircraft.jpg|thumb|[[MQ-1 Predator|Predator]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]; sometimes used in targeted killings]]
Targeted killing is the intentional killing–by a government or its agents–of a civilian or "[[unlawful combatant]]" targeted by the government, who is not in the government's custody.  The target is a person taking part in an armed conflict or terrorism, whether by bearing arms or otherwise, who has thereby lost the immunity from being targeted that he would otherwise have under the [[Third Geneva Convention]].<ref name="google1"/> Note that this is a different term and concept from that of "targeted violence" as used by specialists who study violence.

On the other hand, [[Georgetown University Law Center|Georgetown Law]] Professor [[Gary D. Solis|Gary Solis]], in his 2010 book entitled ''The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War'',<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6FKf0ocxEPAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Law+of+Armed+Conflict:+International+Humanitarian+Law+in+War#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The law of armed conflict ... – Gary D. Solis |publisher=Google Books |date=February 15, 2010 |accessdate=December 27, 2011|isbn=9781139487115}}</ref>  writes: "Assassinations and targeted killings are very different acts".<ref name="google1"/>  The use of the term assassination is opposed, as it denotes murder, whereas the terrorists are targeted in self-defense, and thus it is viewed as a killing, but not a crime.<ref name="HOV">''[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/03/26/EDGK65QPC41.DTL Targeted killing is a necessary option]'', Sofaer, Abraham D., [[Hoover Institution]], March 26, 2004</ref>  Judge [[Abraham D. Sofaer|Abraham Sofaer]], former federal judge for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]], wrote on the subject:

<blockquote>When people call a targeted killing an "assassination," they are attempting to preclude debate on the merits of the action. Assassination is widely defined as murder, and is for that reason prohibited in the United States.... U.S. officials may not kill people merely because their policies are seen as detrimental to our interests.... But killings in self-defense are no more "assassinations" in international affairs than they are murders when undertaken by our police forces against domestic killers. Targeted killings in self-defense have been authoritatively determined by the federal government to fall outside the assassination prohibition.<ref name="sfgate2004"/></blockquote>

Author and former U.S. Army Captain Matthew J. Morgan has argued that "there is a major difference between assassination and targeted killing.... targeted killing [is] not synonymous with assassination.  Assassination ... constitutes an illegal killing."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=QP1Bq7HVQtwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Impact+of+9/11+and+the+New+Legal+Landscape:+The+Day+That+Changed+Everything#v=onepage&q=major%20difference%20between%20assassination%20and%20targeted%20killing&f=false|author=Matthew J.

David|Steve David]],  Professor of International Relations at [[Johns Hopkins University]], writes:  "There are strong reasons to believe that the Israeli policy of targeted killing is not the same as assassination". [[Syracuse University College of Law|Syracuse Law]] Professor William Banks and [[George Washington University Law School|GW Law]] Professor Peter Raven-Hansen write:  "Targeted killing of terrorists is ... not unlawful and would not constitute assassination", Rory Miller writes:  "Targeted killing ... is not 'assassination'". Associate Professor Eric Patterson and Teresa Casale write: "Perhaps most important is the legal distinction between targeted killing and assassination".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/cwrint36&div=20&id=&page=|author=[[Amos Guiora]] |title=Targeted Killing as Active Self-Defense |publisher=36 Case W.

On the other hand, the American Civil Liberties Union also states on its website, "A program of targeted killing far from any battlefield, without charge or trial, violates the constitutional guarantee of due process. It also violates international law, under which lethal force may be used outside armed conflict zones only as a last resort to prevent imminent threats, when non-lethal means are not available. Targeting people who are suspected of terrorism for execution, far from any war zone, turns the whole world into a battlefield."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aclu.org/national-security/frequently-asked-questions-about-targeting-killing |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Targeting Killing &#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date=2010-08-30 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref>
Yael Stein, the research director of B'Tselem, The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, also states in her article "By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to 'Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing'":<ref>url=http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/resources/journal/17_1/debate/860.html</ref>
<blockquote>The argument that this policy affords the public a sense of revenge and retribution could serve to justify acts both illegal and immoral. Clearly, lawbreakers ought to be punished. Yet, no matter how horrific their deeds, as the targeting of Israeli civilians indeed is, they should be punished according to the law. David's arguments could, in principle, justify the abolition of formal legal systems altogether.</blockquote>

==Counter-measures==

===Early forms===
[[File:Sattar Bodyguard.JPG|thumb|left|upright=.5|This bodyguard was killed by an [[improvised explosive device|IED]] during [[Abdul Sattar Abu Risha#Death|Sheik Abdul Sattar Abu Risha's assassination]] in 2007]]
One of the earliest forms of defense against assassins was employing  [[bodyguard]]s. Bodyguards act as a shield for the potential target, keeping lookout for potential attackers (sometimes in advance, for example on a parade route), and putting themselves in harm's way—both by simple presence, showing that physical force is available to protect the target,<ref name="SS">''[http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf Assassination in the United States: An Operational Study]'' – Fein, Robert A. & Vossekuil, Brian, ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'', Volume 44, Number 2, March 1999</ref><ref>[http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html Lincoln] – Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964</ref> and by shielding the target during any attack. To neutralize an attacker, bodyguards are typically armed as much as legal and practical concerns permit.

This bodyguard function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, leading assassins to attempt stealthy means, such as [[poison]] (which risk was answered by having [[food taster|another person taste the leader's food]] first).

Another notable measure is the use of a [[political decoy|body double]], a person who looks like the leader and who pretends to be the leader to draw attention away from the intended target.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Notable examples of bodyguards include the Roman [[Praetorian Guard]] or the Ottoman [[Janissary|Janissaries]]—though, in both cases, the protectors sometimes became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the [[head of state]] a virtual hostage or killing the very leaders they were supposed to protect. The fidelity of individual bodyguards is an important question as well, especially for leaders who oversee states with strong ethnic or religious divisions. Failure to realize such divided loyalties led to the assassination of [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], assassinated by two [[Sikh]] bodyguards in 1984.

===Modern strategies===
[[File:Reagan assassination attempt 4 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Assassination attempt on President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]
With the advent of gunpowder, ranged assassination (via bombs or firearms) became possible. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a small army trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down.

As the 20th century dawned, the prevalence and capability of assassins grew quickly, as did measures to protect against them. For the first time, [[Armored car (VIP)|armored cars or limousines]] were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions virtually invulnerable to [[small arms]] fire, smaller bombs and [[Land mine|mines]].<ref>''[http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php How to choose the appropriate bulletproof cars]'' (from Alpha-armouring.com website, includes examples of protection levels available)</ref> [[Bulletproof vest]]s also began to be used, which were of limited utility, restricting movement and leaving the head unprotected  – so they tended to be worn only during high-profile public events, if at all.

Access to famous persons, too, became more and more restricted;<ref name="Report">[http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html The Need For Protection Further Demonstrated] – Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964</ref> potential visitors would be forced through numerous different checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as communication became better and information technology more prevalent, it has become all but impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work or in private life to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially given the common use of [[metal detector|metal]] and [[Bomb disposal|bomb detectors]].

Most modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during transport, both because of weaker security and security lapses, such as with U.S. President  [[John F. Kennedy]] and former [[Pakistan]]i Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]], or as part of [[Coup d'état|coups d'état]] where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with [[Patrice Lumumba]]. 

[[File:Popemobil Mai 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] in a modified [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]] [[Popemobile]] in [[São Paulo]], Brazil]]
The methods used for protection by famous people have sometimes evoked negative reactions by the public, with some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear [[bulletproof glass]], such as the [[Popemobile]] of  [[Pope John Paul II|Pope John Paul II – ]]<nowiki/>built following an attempt at his life. Politicians often resent this need for separation, sometimes sending their bodyguards away from them for personal or publicity reasons; U.S. President [[William McKinley]] did this at the public reception where he was assassinated.<ref name="Report"/>

Other potential targets go into seclusion, and are rarely heard from or seen in public, such as writer [[Salman Rushdie]]. A related form of protection is the use of [[political decoy|body doubles]]  a person built similar to the person he is expected to impersonate. These persons are then [[makeup|made up]], and in some cases [[plastic surgery|altered]] to look like the target, with the body double then taking the place of the person in high risk situations.  According to Joe R. Reeder, Under Secretary of the Army from 1993 to 1997, [[Fidel Castro]] has used body doubles.<ref name="FOX">{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html |title=It's Bin Laden ... or Is It? |publisher= [[Fox News]] |date=December 20, 2001 |first=Catherine |last=Donaldson-Evans}}</ref>
