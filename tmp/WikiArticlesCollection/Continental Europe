'''Continental Europe''', also referred to as '''mainland Europe''' or simply '''the Continent''' (particularly by the British, Azoreans, Madeirans, Balearic and Canary Spaniards, Icelanders and other European island nations, and peninsular Scandinavians), is the [[continent]] of [[Europe]], explicitly excluding European [[island]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Europe|title=Merriam Webster dictionary definition}}</ref> 

The most common definition of continental Europe excludes the Greek Islands, [[Malta]], [[Sicily]], [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Iceland]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and the [[United Kingdom]] and its dependencies. Most definitions extend the boundaries of the continent to its [[Boundaries between continents|standard]] boundaries: the [[Ural Mountains]], the [[Ural River]], the [[Caspian Sea]], and the [[Caucasus Mountains]].{{citation needed|date = April 2012}}

==Use in the United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], ''the Continent'' is widely and generally used to refer to the mainland of Europe. In addition, the word ''Europe'' itself is also regularly used to mean Europe excluding the islands of Britain, Iceland, and Ireland (although the term is sometimes used to refer to the [[European Union]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-14525705 |title=Britain pushes hard choices for Europe's hard core |publisher=BBC News |first=Douglas |last=Fraser |date=August 15, 2011}}</ref>). 

Occasionally the term ''mainland Europe'' is used. An [[apocryphal]] [[United Kingdom|British]] newspaper headline supposedly once read, "Fog in [[English Channel|Channel]]; Continent Cut Off".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/19/oakley.blog.dayten/index.html |title=Europe no star as election issue |publisher=CNN |first=Robin |last=Oakley |date=April 19, 2005 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> It has also been claimed that this was a regular weather forecast in Britain in the 1930s.<ref>[http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1907149066 Fog in Channel?

Derivatively, the adjective ''continental'' refers to the social practices or fashion of continental Europe as opposed to those of Britain. Examples include  [[Continental breakfast|breakfast]], topless sunbathing and, historically, long-range driving (before Britain had [[motorways]]).{{citation needed|date = April 2012}} Continental Europe, when compared to Britain, has numerous defined differences both cultural and tangible.  The use of Civil rather than Common Law, different electrical plugs, different time zones for the most part, a different currency, driving on the right, and using the metric system exclusively are a small selection.

==Scandinavia==

Especially in [[Germanic studies]], ''continental'' refers to the European continent excluding the [[Scandinavian peninsula]], Britain, Ireland, and Iceland. The reason for this is that although the Scandinavian peninsula is attached to continental Europe by [[Karelia]] and the like, it is usually reached by sea, not by land (which would require travelling north as far as [[Tornio]] at the [[66th parallel north]]). ''Kontinenten'' (''the Continent'') is a vernacular Swedish expression that refers to the area excluding [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], and [[Finland]] but including  [[Denmark]] (even the [[Danish archipelago]]) and the rest of continental Europe. In Norway, similarly, one speaks about ''Kontinentet'' as a separate entity, usually referring to [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], the [[Benelux]] countries, and such.

==Mediterranean and Atlantic islands==

''The Continent'' may sometimes refer to the continental part of [[Italy]] (excluding [[Sardinia]], [[Sicily]], etc.), the continental part of [[Spain]] (excluding the [[Balearic islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[Alboran]], etc.), the continental part of [[France]] (excluding [[Corsica]], etc.), the continental part of [[Portugal]] (excluding the [[Madeira Islands]] and [[Azores]]), or the continental part of Greece (excluding the [[Ionian Islands]], the [[Aegean Islands]], and [[Crete]]). The term is used from the perspective of the island residents of each country to describe the continental portion of their country or the continent (or [[mainland]]) as a whole.
