[[File:Dogtags.jpg|thumb|300px|A pair of blank dog tags on a [[ball chain]]]]
A '''dog tag''' is the informal name given to the identification tags worn by military personnel, because of their resemblance to [[Pet tag|actual dog tags]].  The tag is primarily used for the identification of dead and wounded and essential basic medical information, such as [[blood type]]<ref>''U.S. Soldiers "tagged" for blood transfusion'', Popular Science, February 1942, p71, Scanned by Google Books: http://books.google.com/books?id=pScDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA71-IA1</ref> and history of [[inoculation]]s, along with providing religious preference. Dog tags are usually fabricated from a corrosion-resistant metal although, they have been made from whatever was available.

It may contain two copies of the information and be designed to break easily into two pieces. Other nations use two identical tags. This allows half the tag to be collected from a solider's body for notification while the other half remains with the corpse when battle conditions do not allow the body to be immediately recovered.

==History==
[[Image:Dog tags.jpg|thumb|250px|Dog tags of a U.S. Army soldier who served in World War II]]
During the [[American Civil War]] of 1861–1865, some soldiers pinned paper notes<ref>{{cite book|last=McCormick|first=David|title=Inventing Military Dog Tags|year=2012|url=http://web.ebscohost.com.proxylib.csueastbay.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=2da62b36-cc95-4e80-a066-2affccade0af%40sessionmgr4&vid=12&hid=14}}</ref> with their name and home address to the backs of their coats. Other soldiers stencilled identification on their knapsacks or scratched it in the soft lead backing of the army belt buckle.

Manufacturers of identification badges recognized a market and began advertising in periodicals. Their pins were usually shaped to suggest a branch of service and engraved with the soldier's name and unit. Machine-stamped tags were also made of [[brass]] or [[lead]] with a hole and usually had (on one side) an eagle or shield and such phrases as "War for the Union" or "Liberty, Union, and Equality".  The other side had the soldier's name and unit and sometimes a list of [[battle]]s in which he had participated.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Franco-Prussian War===
The [[Prussia]]n Army issued identification tags for its troops at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870. They were nicknamed ''Hundemarken'' (the German equivalent of "dog tags") and compared to a similar identification system instituted for dogs in the Prussian capital city of Berlin at about the same time.<ref>Law, Clive M. Article in Military Artifact, [[Service Publications]]</ref>

===First World War===
The British Army and their Imperial forces in Canada, Australia and New Zealand issued identification discs from the beginning of the First World War.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} The discs were made of fibre, one in red and one in green, and suspended around the neck by butcher's twine. The same pattern was worn into the Second World War and the Korean War.

The U.S. Army first authorized identification tags in War Department General Order No. 204, dated December 20, 1906, which essentially prescribes the Kennedy identification tag:{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

<blockquote>"An aluminum identification tag, the size of a silver half dollar and of suitable thickness, stamped with the name, [[military rank|rank]], [[company (military unit)|company]], [[regiment]], or [[corps]] of the wearer, will be worn by each officer and enlisted man of the Army whenever the field kit is worn, the tag to be suspended from the neck, underneath the clothing, by a cord or thong passed through a small hole in the tab. It is prescribed as a part of the uniform and when not worn as directed herein will be habitually kept in the possession of the owner. The tag will be issued by the Quartermaster's Department gratuitously to enlisted men and at cost price to officers..."</blockquote>

The army changed regulations on July 6, 1916, so that all soldiers were issued two tags: one to stay with the body and the other to go to the person in charge of the burial for record-keeping purposes. In 1918, the army adopted and allotted the [[serial number]] system, and name and serial numbers were ordered stamped on the identification tags. (Serial number 1 was assigned to enlisted man Arthur B. Crane of Chicago in the course of his fifth enlistment period.)

===World War II===
[[Image:South African Navy WW2 dogtag.jpg|thumb|200px|One of the two identity discs issued by the South African Navy during WW2 with rank, surname, initials, force number and religious affiliation]]
There is a recurring myth about the notch situated in one end of the dog tags issued to United States Army personnel during World War II. It was rumored that the notch's purpose was that, if a soldier found one of his comrades on the battlefield, he could take one tag to the commanding officer and stick the other between the teeth of the soldier to ensure that the tag would remain with the body and be identified.  In reality, the notch was designed to hold the tag in place when being imprinted on the carbon-paper medical form by the Model 70 [[Addressograph]] (a pistol-type imprinting machine used by the Medical Department during World War II).<ref>[https://www.armydogtags.com/a_PurposeNotch.php], retrieved 22 December 2009</ref><ref>Barbara Mikkelson. [http://www.snopes.com/military/notch.asp "Notch for the Faint Hearted",] ''Snopes.com'', 2 August 2007, retrieved 12 September 2007</ref> It appears instructions that would confirm the notch's mythical use were issued at least unofficially by the [[Graves Registration Service]] during the [[Vietnam War]] to Army troops headed overseas.<ref>Col. David G. Fitz-Enz (Ret.): ''Why A Soldier? A Signal Corpsman's Tour from Vietnam to the Moscow Hotline'', page 166. Ballantine, 2000. ISBN 0-8041-1938-4</ref>

Dog tags are traditionally part of the makeshift battlefield memorials soldiers created for their fallen comrades. The casualty's rifle with [[bayonet]] affixed is stood vertically atop the empty boots, with the helmet over the stock of the rifle. The dog tags hang from the rifle's handle or trigger guard.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

=== Fashion ===
[[Image:Personalizeddogtags.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Close-up of a teenager wearing custom-made dog tags]]
Dog tags have recently found their way into youth fashion by way of [[List of chics#Military chic .28also: Soldier chic.29|military chic]]. Originally worn as a part of a military uniform by youth wishing to present a tough or militaristic image, dog tags have since seeped out into wider fashion circles. They may be inscribed with a person's details, their beliefs or tastes, a favorite quote, or may bear the name or logo of a band or performer. Some people also prefer to have the information on their tags transferred to a smaller, sometimes golden or silver tag by a jeweler, as the original tag can be considered too large and bulky by some. Some tags (along with similar items such as [[MedicAlert]] bracelets) identify their wearers as having health problems that may ''a'') suddenly incapacitate their wearers and render them incapable of providing treatment guidance (as in the cases of heart problems, epilepsy, and diabetes) and/or ''b'') interact adversely with medical treatments, especially standard or "first-line" ones (as in the case of an allergy to common medications or a religious, moral, or other [[Do not resuscitate|objection to artificial resuscitation]]), if a first responder attempts to administer such treatment when the wearer is nonresponsive and thus unable to warn against doing so.

Since the late 1990s, custom dog tags have become fashionable amongst musicians (particularly rappers), and as a marketing giveaway item. Numerous companies <!-- do not list examples - not notable --> offer customers the opportunity to create their own personalized dog tags with their own photos, logos, and text. Even high-end jewelers <!-- do not list examples - not notable --> have featured gold and silver dog tags encrusted with diamonds and other jewels. For example, to market the release of [[Call of Duty: Black Ops II]], dog tags inscribed with the words "CALL OF DUTY BLACK OPS II",and the same for [[Battlefield 4]] were given when a person pre-ordered the game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Call of Duty: Black Ops II Pre-Order Bonuses Include Dog Tags, Wallpapers, and Posters|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/side-mission/14388/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii-pre-order-bonuses-include-dog-tags-wallpapers-and-posters|publisher=gametrailers.com|accessdate=2 July 2013|date=May 17, 2012}}</ref>

==Variations by country==

===Austria===
The Austrian "[[Bundesheer]]" utilized a single long, rectangular tag with oval ends, stamped with blood group & Rh factor at the end, with ID number underneath.  Two slots & a hole stamped beneath the number allow the tag to be broken in half, and the long bottom portion has both the ID number and a series of holes which allows the tag to be inserted into a [[dosimeter]].  This has been replaced with a more conventional, wider & rounded rectangle which can still be halved, but lacks the dosimeter reading holes.

===Australia===
The Australian Defence Force issues soldiers two tags of different shapes: Number 1 Tag (the octagonal shaped disc) and Number 2 Tag (the circular disc). The format is as follows:
*AS (denoting Australia, previously both AU and AUST have been used)
*PMKeyS/ Service Number
*Surname Initials
*Religious Preference [RC – Roman Catholic; ANG – Anglican]
*Blood Group
Example:
*AUST
*8549302
*SMITH DE
*RC

The information is printed exactly the same on both discs. In the event of a casualty, the circular tag is removed from the body and the octagonal tag is placed inside the dead soldier’s mouth, between the teeth and lips.

===Belgium===
Belgian Forces identity tags are, like the Canadian and Norwegian, designed to be broken in two in case of fatality; the lower half is returned to Belgian Defence tail, while the upper half remains on the body. The tags contain the following information:

===East Germany===
The Nationale Volksarmee used a tag nearly identical with that used by both the Wehrmacht and the West German Bundeswehr.  The oval aluminium tag was stamped "DDR" (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) above the personal ID number; this information was repeated on the bottom half, which was intended to be broken off in case of death.  Oddly, the tag was not worn, but required to be kept in a plastic sleeve in the back of the WDA identity booklet.

Both sides contain the same information: the soldier's personal identity code, blood group and the word HUNGARIA. Some may not have the blood group on them. These are only issued to soldiers who are serving outside of the country. If the soldier should die, one side is removed and kept for the army's official records, while the other side is left attached to the body.

If more information needed, another two oval wrist tags are provided.  The term ''wrist tags'' can be used to refer to the [[bracelet]]-like [[wristwatch]]. The additional tags only need to be worn on the wrist, with the main tags still on the neck. All personnel are allowed to attach a small religious [[pendant]] or [[locket]]; this makes a quick identifiable reference for their funeral services.

===Mexico===
The Ejército de Mexico uses a single long, rectangular metal tag with oval ends, embossed with Name, serial number, and blood type plus Rh factor.

===Netherlands===
[[Military of the Netherlands]] identity tags, like the Canadian and Norwegian ones, are designed to be broken in two in case of a fatality; the lower end is returned to Dutch Defence Headquarters, while the upper half remains on the body. There is a difference in the Army and Airforce service number and the Navy service number:

===Poland===
The first dog tags were issued in Poland following the order of the General Staff of December 12, 1920. The earliest design (dubbed ''kapala'' in Polish, more properly called "kapsel legitymacyjny" - meaning "identification cap") consisted of a tin-made 30×50&nbsp;mm rectangular frame and a rectangular cap fitting into the frame. Soldiers' details were filled in a small ID card placed inside the frame, as well as on the inside of the frame itself. The dog tag was similar to the tags used by the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] during [[World War I]]. In case the soldier died, the frame was left with his body, while the lid was returned to his unit together with a note on his death. The ID card was handed over to the chaplain or the rabbi.

In 1928, a new type of dog tag was proposed by [[generał brygady|gen. bryg.]] [[Stanisław Rouppert]], Poland's representative at the [[International Red Cross]]. It was slightly modified and adopted in 1931 under the name of Nieśmiertelnik wz. 1931 (literally, Immortalizer mark 1931). The new design consisted of an oval piece of metal (ideally steel, but in most cases aluminium alloy was used), roughly 40 by 50 milimetres. There were two notches on both sides of the tag, as well as two rectangular holes in the middle to allow for easier breaking of the tag in two halves. The halves contained the same set of data and were identical, except the upper half had two holes for a string or twine to go through. The data stamped on the dog tag included:

* Obverse
** Name
** Surname
** Optionally: abbreviation of soldiers' religion (KAT for Roman Catholics, GR-KAT for Greek Catholics, PRAW for Orthodox, MOJ for Jewish, AUG for Lutherans, ANG for Anglicans and MAH for Muslims)
* Reverse
** Soldiers' ID card number and first letter of the [[powiat]] the soldier came from
** Name of the Recruitment Commission (usually name of the town or city the soldier was attached to)
** Year of birth

Sometimes the rank of the soldier was added to the reverse, and most members of the medical corps had a tiny cross stamped near the string holes, regardless of their religion.

===Rhodesia===

The former Republic of Rhodesia used two WW2 British-style compressed asbestos fiber tags, a No. 1 octagonal (green) tag and a No. 2 circular (red) tag, stamped with identical information.  The red tag was supposedly fireproof and the green tag rotproof.  The following information was stamped on the tags: Number, Name, Initials, & Religion; Blood Type was stamped on reverse.  The air force & BSAP often stamped their service on the reverse side above the blood group.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Many soldiers state they were issued blank tags and told to punch the information in themselves. {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Russia===
[[File:Dog-tag-modern-russia.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Russian dog tag]]
[[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Russian Armed Forces]] uses metal oval tags. Russian dog tags contains the title «ВС РОССИИ» and the alphanumeric individual numbers.

===Singapore===
The [[Singapore Armed Forces]]-issued dog tags are inscribed (not embossed) with up to four items:
* [[NRIC number]]
* Blood type
* Religion
* Drug allergies (if any; inscribed on the reverse)

The dog tags consist of two metal pieces, one oval with two holes and one round with one hole. A synthetic lanyard is threaded through both holes in the oval piece and tied around the wearer's neck. The round piece is tied to the main loop on a shorter loop.

===South Africa===
The former South African Defense Force used two long, rectangular aluminium tags with oval ends, stamped with serial number, name and initials, religion, and blood type.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===South Korea===
The [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean Army]] issues two long, rectangular tags with oval ends, stamped (in Korean lettering) with "Yuk-Gun" ([[English language|English]]: Army) above a personal number, with the name below that and the blood group at the bottom.

===South Vietnam===
The [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnamese Army]] used two American-style dog tags. Some tags added religion, e.g., Công Giáo for Catholic. They were stamped or inscribed with: 
*Name
*SQ (Số Quân, i.e., Service number) a 2-digit year number, followed by a military serial number
*LM (loại máu, i.e., Blood Group, no rH factor)

===Spain===
Issues a single metal oval, worn vertically, stamped "ESPAÑA" above and below the 3-slot horizontal break line. It is stamped in 4 lines with:
*1st line – Religion
*2nd line – left side = blood group, right side = any medical allergies (SI or NO)
*3rd line – military service (ET, EA ...)
*4th (longest) line = DNI military number. {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Sweden===
[[Image:Swedogtag.jpg|thumb|Swedish civilian dog tag (1970s)]]
Swedish dog tags are designed to be able to break apart. The information on them was prior to 2010:
* [[Personal identity number (Sweden)|Personal identity number]] (twice, once in the upper part and once below)
* Full name
* Residence at birth
* Blood type (only on some)

Swedish dog tags issued to troops after 2010 are, for personal security reasons, only marked with personal identity number.

During the Cold War dog tags were issued to everyone, often soon after birth, since the threat of total war also meant the risk of severe civilian casualties. However in the late 90s the Swedish government decided that the dog tags were not needed anymore.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Switzerland===
[[Swiss Armed Forces]] ID tag is an oval shaped non reflective plaque, containing the following information:
* Social insurance number
* Surname
* First name
* Date of birth in DD.MM.YY format
* [[Cantons of Switzerland|Canton]] of origin
* Blood type
On the back side the letters CH standing for (Confoederatio Helvetica) are engraved next to a Swiss cross.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Second World War British dog tag reverse side (RAF).jpg|thumb|World War II fibre disc type of dog tag]]
The [[British Armed Forces]] currently utilize two circular non reflecting stainless steel tags engraved with the "Big 6":
# Blood group
# Service Number
# Last name (Surname)
# Initials
# "M" for Male, "F" for Female  	
# RAF (if in the [[Royal Air force]]. The RAF is the only service to mark tags on line 6)

The disks are suspended from one long chain (24 inches long) and one short chain (4.5 inches long)

During World War One and Two, service personnel were issued pressed fibre identity disks, one green octagonal shaped disc, and a red round disc (some army units issued a second red round disk to be attached to the service respirator). The identity disks were hand stamped with the surname, initials, service number and religion of the holder and if in the Royal Air Force, the initials RAF. The disks were worn around the neck on a 38" length of cotton cord, this was often replaced by the wearer with a leather bootlace. One tag was suspended below the main tag.

From 1960 these were replaced with stainless steel ID tags on a green nylon cord, two circular and one oval. The oval was withdrawn around 1990.

===United States of America===
[[File:US Dog Tag with Surname, First name, Social Security number, Blood type, Religion.jpg|thumb|250px|An American dog tag showing the recipient's last name, first name, Social Security number, blood type, and religion.]]
In the 1990s, the U.S. Army stopped using the term ''dog tags'', replacing it with the designation ''ID tags''.

A persistent rumor is that debossed (imprinted with stamped in letters) dog tags were issued from World War II till the end of the Vietnam War and that currently the U.S. Armed Forces is issuing embossed (imprinted with raised letters) dog tags. In actuality, the U.S. Armed Forces issues dog tags with both types of imprinting, depending on the machine used at a given facility. The military issued 95% of their identification tags up until recently (within the past 10 years) with debossed text.<ref>http://www.dogtagsrus.com/embossed-debossed.htm</ref>

The [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]] typically carry two identical oval dog tags containing:

During World War II, an American dog tag could indicate only one of three religions through the inclusion of one letter: "P" for Protestant, "C" for Catholic, or "H" for Jewish (from the word, "Hebrew"),<ref name="tags">[http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq70-1.htm www.history.navy.mil], retrieved May 30, 2011.</ref> or (according to at least one source) "NO" to indicate no religious preference.<ref name="no">[http://www.blitzkriegbaby.de/anc/anc3e.htm www.blitzkriegbaby.de], retrieved May 30, 2011.</ref> Army regulations (606-5) soon included X and Y in addition to P,C, and H: the X indicating any religion not included in the first three, and the Y indicating either no religion or a choice not to list religion.<ref>Non-commissioned officers guide, 4th edition, pg. 212.</ref>
By the time of the [[Vietnam War]], some IDs spelled out the broad religious choices such as PROTESTANT and CATHOLIC, rather than using initials, and also began to show individual denominations such as "METHODIST" or "BAPTIST."<ref name="religions">[http://www.mooremilitaria.com/dog_tags.htm www.mooremilitaria.com], retrieved May 30, 2011.</ref> Tags did vary by service, however, such as the use of "CATH," not "CATHOLIC" on some Navy tags. For those with no religious affiliation and those who chose not to list an affiliation, either the space for religion was left blank or the words "NO PREFERENCE" or "NO RELIGIOUS PREF" were included.<ref name="religions"/>

Although American dog tags include the recipient's religion as a way of ensuring that religious needs will be met, some personnel have them reissued without religious affiliation listed—or keep two sets, one with the designation and one without—out of fear that identification as a member of a particular religion could increase the danger to their welfare or their lives if they fell into enemy hands. Some Jewish personnel avoided flying over German lines during WWII with ID tags that indicated their religion, and some Jewish personnel avoid the religious designation today out of concern that they could be captured by extremists who are [[anti-Semitic]].<ref name="no"/><ref>[http://www.jewishjournal.com/los_angeles/article/in_harms_way_20030321 www.jewishjournal.com], retrieved May 30, 2011.</ref> Additionally, when American troops were first sent to [[Saudi Arabia]] during the [[Gulf War]] there were allegations that some U.S. military authorities were pressuring Jewish military personnel to avoid listing their religions on their ID tags.<ref>[http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1992_4_USCivicPolitical.pdf www.ajcarchives], pages 178–179, retrieved May 30, 2011.</ref>
