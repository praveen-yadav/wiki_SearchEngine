The '''Ababda''' or '''Ababde''' &ndash; the '''Gebadei''' of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], and possibly the '''[[Troglodytae|Troglodytes]]''' of other classical writers &ndash; are [[nomad]]s living in the area between the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]], in the vicinity of [[Aswan]] in [[Egypt]].  They are a subgroup of the [[Beja people]] who are bilingual in [[Beja language|Beja]] and [[Arabic]].

==Overview==
[[File:Ababdeh.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Geographical distribution.]]
The Ababda extend from the [[Nile]] at [[Aswan]] to the [[Red Sea]], and reach northward to the [[Qena]]-Quseir road, thus occupying the southern border of [[Egypt]] east of the Nile. They call themselves "sons of the Jinns." With some of the clans of the [[Bisharin]] and possibly the [[Hadendoa]], they represent the [[Blemmyes]] of classic geographers, and their location today is almost identical with that assigned them in [[ancient Rome|Roman]] times.

They were constantly at war with the Romans, who eventually conquered them. In the Middle Ages, they were known as Beja, and convoyed pilgrims from the Nile valley to [[â€˜Aydhab|Aidhab]], the port of embarkation for [[Jeddah]]. From time immemorial, they have acted as guides to caravans through the [[Nubia]]n desert and up the Nile valley as far as Sennar. They intermarried with the [[Nubians]], and settled in small colonies at [[Shendi]] and elsewhere up to [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali's]] conquest of the region in the early 19th century. They are still great trade carriers, and visit very distant districts.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
