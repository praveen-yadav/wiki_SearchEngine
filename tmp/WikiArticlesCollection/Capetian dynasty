The '''Capetian dynasty''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|p|iː|ʃ|ⁱ|ən}}, also known as the '''[[House of France]]''', is among the largest and oldest European [[royal house]]s, consisting of the descendants of King [[Hugh Capet of France]] in the male line. In contemporary times, both King [[Juan Carlos]] of Spain and Grand Duke [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Henri]] of [[Luxembourg]] are members of this family, both through the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon branch]] of the dynasty.

==Name origins and usage==
The name of the dynasty derives from its founder, [[Hugh Capet of France|Hugh]], who was known as "Hugh Capet". The meaning of "Capet" (a nickname rather than a surname of the modern sort) is unknown. While folk etymology identifies it with "cape", other suggestions suggest it to be connected to the Latin word ''caput'' ("head"), and thus explain it as meaning "chief" or "head".{{citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Historians came to apply the name "Capetian" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice. The name "Capet" has also been used as a surname for French royals, particularly but not exclusively those of the [[House of Capet]]. One notable use was during the French Revolution, when the dethroned [[King Louis XVI]] (a member of the [[House of Bourbon]] and a direct male-line descendant of Hugh Capet) and [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Queen Marie Antoinette]] (a member of the [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]]) were referred to as "Louis and Antoinette Capet" (the queen being addressed as "the Widow Capet" after the execution of her husband).

==The Robertians and before==

{{Capetian Cadets}}
{{main|Robertians}}
The dynastic surname now used to describe Hugh Capet's family prior to his election as King of France is "Robertians" or "Robertines." The name is derived from the family's first certain ancestor, [[Robert the Strong]] (b. 820), the count of Paris. Robert was probably son of [[Robert III of Worms]] (b. 800) and grandson of [[Robert of Hesbaye]] (b. 770). The Robertians probably originated in the county [[Hesbaye]], around [[Tongeren]] in modern-day Belgium.

The sons of Robert the Strong were [[Odo of France|Odo]] and [[Robert I of France|Robert]], who both ruled as king of [[Western Francia]]. The family became [[Count of Paris|Counts of Paris]] under Odo and Dukes of the [[Franks]] under Robert, possessing large parts of [[Neustria]].

The Carolingian dynasty ceased to rule France upon the death of [[Louis V of France|Louis V]]. After the death of Louis V, the son of Hugh the Great, [[Hugh Capet]], was elected by the nobility as king of France. Hugh was crowned at [[Noyon]] on 3 July 987 with the full support from [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]. With Hugh's coronation, a new era began for France, and his descendants came to be named the ''Capetians,'' with the Capetian dynasty ruling France for more than 800 years (987–1848, with some interruptions<ref>Specific periods of reign are 888–898, 922–923, 987–1792, 1814–1815, and 1815–1848 – the more-than-800-year uninterrupted period 987–1792 forming the bulk.</ref>).

==Capetians through history==
Over the succeeding centuries, Capetians spread throughout Europe, ruling every form of provincial unit from [[monarchy|kingdoms]] to [[Manorialism|manor]]s.

===Salic Law===
[[Salic Law]], reestablished during the [[Hundred Years' War]] from an ancient [[Salian Franks|Frankish]] tradition, caused the French monarchy to permit only male ([[Agnatic succession|agnatic]]) descendants of Hugh to succeed to the throne of France.  

Without Salic Law, upon the death of [[John I of France|John I]], the crown would have passed to his half-sister, [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan]] (later Joan II of Navarre). However, Joan's paternity was suspect due to her mother's adultery; the French magnates adopted Salic Law to avoid the succession of a possible bastard.

In 1328, King [[Charles IV of France]] died without male heirs, as his brothers did before him. [[Philip VI of France|Philip of Valois]], the late king's first cousin acted as regent, pending the birth of the king's posthumous child, which proved to be a girl. [[Isabella of France]], sister of Charles IV, claimed the throne for her son, [[Edward III of England]]. The English king did not find support among the French lords, who made Philip of Valois their king. From then on the French succession not only excluded females, but also rejected claims based on the female line of descent.

Thus the French crown passed from the [[House of Capet]] after the death of [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] to [[Philip VI of France]] of the [[House of Valois]], a [[cadet branch]] of the Capetian dynasty, 
*then to Louis II, Duke of Orléans, of the Orléans branch of the Valois, who became [[Louis XII of France]],
*then to Francis, Duke of Valois, Count of Angoulème, who became [[Francis I of France]], and his descendants, of the Orléans-Angoulème, 
*then to Henry III of Navarre, who became [[Henry IV of France]], of the [[House of Bourbon]], a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty.

This did not affect monarchies not under that law such as Portugal, Spain, [[Navarre]], and various smaller duchies and counties. Therefore, many royal families appear and disappear in the French succession or become cadet branches upon marriage. A complete list of the senior-most line of Capetians is available [[#Senior Capets|below]].

===Capetian Cadet Branches===
The Capetian Dynasty has been broken many times into (sometimes rival) cadet branches. A cadet branch is a line of descent from another line than the senior-most.

==Senior Capets==
Throughout most of history, the '''Senior Capet''' and the [[King of France]] were synonymous terms. Only in the time before [[Hugh Capet]] took the crown for himself and after the reign of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] is the term necessary to identify which. However, since primogeniture and the [[Salic Law]] provided for the succession of the French throne for most of French history, here is a list of all the predecessors of the French monarchy, all the French kings from Hugh until Charles, and all the [[Legitimist]] pretenders thereafter. All dates are for seniority, not reign. It is important to note that historians class the predecessors of Hugh Capet as ''Robertians'', not ''Capetians''.

==The Capetian dynasty today==
Many years have passed since the Capetian monarchs ruled a large part of Europe; however, they still remain as kings, as well as other titles. Currently two Capetian monarchs still rule in Spain and Luxembourg. In addition, seven [[pretender]]s represent exiled dynastic monarchies in Brazil, France, Spain, Portugal, Parma and Two Sicilies. The current legitimate, senior family member is [[Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou|Louis-Alphonse de Bourbon]], known by his supporters as [[Duke of Anjou]], who also holds the [[Legitimist]] (''[[Blancs d'Espagne]]'') claim to the French throne. Overall, dozens of branches of the Capetian dynasty still exist throughout Europe.

Except for the [[House of Braganza]] (founded by an [[Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza|illegitimate son]] of King [[John I of Portugal]], who was himself illegitimate), all current major Capetian branches are of the Bourbon cadet branch. Within the House of Bourbon, many of these lines are themselves well-defined cadet lines of the House.

===Current Capetian rulers===
* [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]], [[King of Spain]] (since 1975)
* [[Henri of Luxembourg|Henri]], [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]] (since 2000)

===Current Capetian pretenders===
* [[Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou]], [[Legitimist]] (''[[Blancs d'Espagne]]'') pretender to France since 1989.
* [[Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria]], Calabrian pretender to the [[Two Sicilies]] since 1964.
* [[Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro]], Castroist pretender to the [[Two Sicilies]] since 2008.
* [[Carlos, Duke of Parma]], pretender to Parma since 2010.
* [[Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma]], [[Carlist]] pretender to Spain since 1979.
* [[Henri d'Orléans, Count of Paris|Prince Henry, Count of Paris]], [[Legitimist]] (''Blancs d'Eu'') and [[Orléanist]] pretender to France since 1999.
* [[Prince Pedro Carlos of Orléans-Braganza]], Petrópolis pretender to Brazil since 2007.
* [[Prince Luiz of Orléans-Braganza]], Vassouras pretender to Brazil since 1981.
* [[Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza]], pretender to Portugal since 1976.
