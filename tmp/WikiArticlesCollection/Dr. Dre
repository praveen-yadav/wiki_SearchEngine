'''Andre Romelle Young''' (born February 18, 1965), known by his [[stage name]] '''Dr. Dre''', is an American record producer, [[rapper]] and entrepreneur. He is the founder and current CEO of [[Aftermath Entertainment]] and [[Beats Electronics]]. Dre was previously the co-owner and artist of [[Death Row Records]]. He has produced albums for and overseen the careers of many rappers, including [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Eminem]], [[Xzibit]], [[50 Cent]], [[Game (rapper)|The Game]] and more recently [[Kendrick Lamar]]. He is credited as a key figure in the popularization of [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] [[G-funk]], a style of rap music characterized as synthesizer-based with slow, heavy beats. In 2011, Dr. Dre was ranked as the third richest figure in the American hip hop scene by [[Forbes magazine|Forbes]] with a net worth of $250 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=3. Andre "Dr. Dre" Young ($250 million)|url=http://www.forbes.com/pictures/eeel45edgm/3-andre-dr-dre-young-250-million-2/#gallerycontent|publisher=Forbes Magazine|accessdate=May 4, 2012}}</ref> 

Dre began his career as a member of the [[World Class Wreckin' Cru]] and later found fame with the influential [[gangsta rap]] group [[N.W.A]] with [[Eazy-E]], [[Ice Cube]], [[MC Ren]], and [[DJ Yella]], which popularized the use of explicit lyrics in rap to detail the violence of street life. His 1992 solo debut ''[[The Chronic]]'', released under Death Row Records, led him to become one of the best-selling American performing artists of 1993 and to win a [[Grammy Award]] for the single "[[Let Me Ride]]". That same year he produced Death Row labelmate [[Snoop Dogg]]'s quadruple platinum debut ''[[Doggystyle]]''. 

In 1996, he left Death Row to establish his own label, Aftermath Entertainment. He produced a compilation album titled ''[[Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath]]'' in 1996, and released a solo album titled ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]'' in 1999, for which he won the Grammy producer's award. During the 2000s, he focused on production for other artists, while occasionally contributing vocals to songs. Dr. Dre signed [[Eminem]] and [[50 Cent]] to his record label in 1998 and 2003 respectively, while contributing production on their albums. Dr.&nbsp;Dre has also had acting roles in movies such as ''[[Set It Off]]'', ''[[The Wash (film)|The Wash]]'' and ''[[Training Day]]''. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Dre at 56 on their list of "100 Greatest Artists of All-Time".

== Early life ==
André Romelle Young was born in [[Compton, California]] on February 18, 1965. He was the first child of Theodore and Verna Young. André's middle name, Romelle, is derived from his father's amateur [[R&B]] singing group, The Romells. Married in 1964, André's parents separated in 1968 and divorced in 1972.<ref>{{harvnb|Ro|2007|pp=7–8}}</ref> Verna later married Curtis Crayon. They had three  children together, two sons named Jerome and Tyree (both deceased)<ref>{{harvnb|Ro|2007|p=7}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Kenyatta|2000|p=25}}</ref> and daughter Shameka.<ref>{{harvnb|Ro|2007|pp=6–8}}</ref> 

In 1976, Young began attending Vanguard Junior High School in Compton, but due to [[gang]] violence, he transferred to the safer suburban Roosevelt Junior High School.<ref>{{harvnb|Ro|2007|p=9}}</ref> Verna later married Warren Griffin, whom she met at her new job in Long Beach,<ref>{{harvnb|Ro|2007|p=10}}</ref> which added three stepsisters and one stepbrother to the family. His stepbrother Warren Griffin III, would eventually become rapper [[Warren G]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyatta|2000|p=14}}</ref> Young attended [[Centennial High School (Compton, California)|Centennial High School]] in Compton during his freshman year in 1979, but transferred to [[John C. Fremont High School|Fremont High School]] due to poor grades. Young attempted to enroll in an apprenticeship program at [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop Aviation Company]], but poor grades at school made him ineligible. Thereafter, he focused on his social life and entertainment for the remainder of his high school years.<ref>{{harvnb|Ro|2007|p=2}}</ref> Young fathered a son, Curtis, born December 15, 1981, with Lisa Johnson. Curtis Young was brought up by his mother and first met his father 20 years later, when Curtis became rapper Hood Surgeon.<ref>{{harvnb|Ro|2007|p=11}}</ref>

== Music career ==

=== 1984–85: World Class Wreckin' Cru ===
Inspired by the [[Grandmaster Flash]] song "[[The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel]]", he often attended a club called The Eve After Dark to watch many DJs and rappers performing live. He subsequently became a DJ in the club, initially under the name "Dr. J", based on the nickname of [[Julius Erving]], his favorite basketball player. At the club, he met aspiring rapper Antoine Carraby, later to become member [[DJ Yella]] of [[N.W.A]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kenyatta|2000|p=15}}</ref> Soon afterwards he adopted the moniker Dr.&nbsp;Dre, a mix of previous alias Dr. J and his first name, referring to himself as the "Master of Mixology".<ref>{{harvnb|Ro|2007|p=14}}</ref> He later joined the musical group [[World Class Wreckin' Cru]] under the independent [[Kru-Cut Records]] in 1984. The group would become stars of the electro-hop scene that dominated early 1980s [[West Coast hip hop]], and their first hit "Surgery" would prominently feature Dr.&nbsp;Dre on the turntables and sell 50,000&nbsp;copies within the Compton area.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyatta|2000|pp=14–17}}</ref>
Dr.&nbsp;Dre and DJ Yella also performed mixes for local radio station [[KDAY]], boosting ratings for its afternoon rush-hour show ''The Traffic Jam''.<ref>{{harvnb|Ro|2007|p=17}}</ref> Dr. Dre's earliest recordings were released in 1994 on a compilation titled ''[[Concrete Roots]]''. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the website ''Allmusic'' described the compiled music, released "several years before Dre developed a distinctive style", as "surprisingly generic and unengaging" and "for dedicated fans only".<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title="Concrete Roots" > Overview|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r204338|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=June 26, 2008}}</ref>

His frequent absences from school jeopardized his position as a diver on his school's swim team. After high school, he attended Chester Adult School in Compton following his mother's demands for him to get a job or continue his education. After brief attendance at a radio broadcasting school, he relocated to the residence of his father and residence of his grandparents before returning to his mother's house.<ref>{{harvnb|Ro|2007|pp=18–19}}</ref> He later dropped out of Chester to focus on performing at the Eve's After Dark nightclub.

=== 1986–91: N.W.A and Ruthless Records ===
{{listen|pos=left|filename=N.W.A - Fuck Tha Police.ogg|title="Fuck Tha Police"|description=from ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]''|format=[[Ogg]]}}

In 1986, Dr. Dre met rapper [[Ice Cube]], who collaborated with Dr. Dre to record songs for [[Ruthless Records]], a rap record label run by local rapper [[Eazy-E]]. [[N.W.A]] and fellow West Coast rapper [[Ice-T]] are widely credited as seminal artists of the gangsta rap genre, a profanity-heavy subgenre of hip hop, replete with gritty depictions of urban crime and gang lifestyle. Not feeling constricted to racially charged political issues pioneered by rap artists such as [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] or [[Boogie Down Productions]], N.W.A favored themes and uncompromising lyrics, offering stark descriptions of violent, inner-city streets. Propelled by the hit "[[Fuck tha Police]]", the group's first full album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' became a major success, despite an almost complete absence of radio airplay or major concert tours. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] sent Ruthless Records a warning letter in response to the song's content.<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Dr. Dre – Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dr-dre-mn0000805274/biography|publisher=Allmusic|year=2000|accessdate=September 22, 2007}}</ref>

After Ice Cube left N.W.A in 1989 over financial disputes, Dr. Dre produced and performed for much of the group's second album ''[[Efil4zaggin]]''. He also produced tracks for a number of other rap acts on Ruthless Records, including [[Above the Law (group)|Above the Law]], and [[The D.O.C.]] for his 1989 album ''[[No One Can Do It Better]]''.<ref name="doc formula">{{cite web|title=Q&A w/The D.O.C.: From Ruthless to Death Row|url=http://www.thaformula.com/doc_ruthless_to_death_row_thaformula_music.html|work=ThaFormula.com|year=2004|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100409061930/http://www.thaformula.com/doc_ruthless_to_death_row_thaformula_music.html|archivedate=April 9, 2010}}</ref> In 1991, at a music industry party in Hollywood, he assaulted television host [[Dee Barnes]] of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television program ''Pump it Up'', feeling dissatisfied with a news report of hers regarding the feud between the remaining N.W.A members and Ice Cube. Thus, Dr. Dre was fined $2,500 and given two years' probation and 240 hours of community service, as well as a spot on an anti-violence [[public service announcement]] on television.<ref>{{cite news|last=Noel|first=Peter|title=Revenge of the Mad Rappers|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9848,noel,1748,1.html|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=November 24, 1998|accessdate=February 14, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyatta|2000|p=27}}</ref>

===1992–96: ''The Chronic'' and Death Row Records===
{{listen|pos=left|filename=Dr. Dre - Nuthin' But a "G" Thang.ogg|title="Nuthin' But a "G" Thang"|description=from ''The Chronic''|format=[[Ogg]]}}

After a dispute with Eazy-E, Dre left the group at the peak of its popularity in 1991 under the advice of friend, and N.W.A lyricist, [[The D.O.C.]] and his bodyguard at the time, [[Suge Knight]]. Knight, a notorious strongman and intimidator, was able to have Eazy-E release Young from his contract and, using Dr.&nbsp;Dre as his flagship artist, founded [[Death Row Records]]. In 1992 Young released his first single, the [[Deep Cover (song)|title track]] to the film ''[[Deep Cover]]'', a collaboration with rapper [[Snoop Dogg]], whom he met through Warren G.<ref name="Allmusic"/> Dr.&nbsp;Dre's debut solo album was ''[[The Chronic]]'', released under Death Row Records. Young ushered in a new style of rap, both in terms of musical style and lyrical content.<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey|first= Steve|title="The Chronic" – Overview|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r70573|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=September 22, 2007}}</ref>

On the strength of singles such as "[[Nuthin' but a "G" Thang|Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang]]", "[[Let Me Ride]]", and "[[Fuck wit Dre Day (and Everybody's Celebratin')]]" (known as "Dre Day" for radio and television play), all of which featured Snoop Dogg as guest vocalist, ''The Chronic'' became a cultural phenomenon, its [[G-funk]] sound dominating much of hip hop music for the early 1990s.<ref name="Allmusic"/> In 1993 the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) certified the album triple platinum,<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web | url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Dr.+Dre%22 | title=Gold & Platinum Dr. Dre | publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] | accessdate=April 4, 2013}}</ref> and Dr.&nbsp;Dre also won the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance]] for his performance on "[[Let Me Ride]]".<ref name="grammy">{{cite web|title=Dr. Dre – Grammy Awards|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p26119|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=February 17, 2008}}</ref> For that year, ''Billboard'' magazine also ranked Dr.&nbsp;Dre as the eighth best-selling musical artist, ''The Chronic'' as the sixth best-selling album, and "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang" as the 11th best-selling single.<ref name="pop life">{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|title=The Pop Life|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/12/movies/the-pop-life-849405.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=January 14, 1994|accessdate=March 3, 2008}}</ref>

Besides working on his own material, Dr.&nbsp;Dre produced Snoop Dogg's debut album ''[[Doggystyle]]'', which became the first debut album for an artist to debut at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album charts.<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title="Doggystyle" – Overview|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r185654|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=February 15, 2008}}</ref> In 1994 Dr.&nbsp;Dre produced some songs on the soundtracks to the films ''[[Above the Rim]]'' and ''[[Murder Was the Case]]''. He collaborated with fellow N.W.A member Ice Cube for the song "[[Natural Born Killaz]]" in 1995.<ref name="Allmusic"/> For the film ''[[Friday (1995 film)|Friday]]'', Dre recorded "[[Keep Their Heads Ringin']]", which reached number ten on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and number 1 on the Hot Rap Singles (now Hot Rap Tracks) charts.<ref name="dr-dre-sin">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p26119|pure_url=yes}}|title=Dr. Dre – Awards|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=January 1, 2009}}</ref>

In 1995, Death Row Records signed rapper [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]], and began to position him as their major star: he collaborated with Dr. Dre on the commercially successful single "[[California Love]]", which became both artists' first song to top the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name="Allmusic"/><ref>{{cite journal | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ogkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA118#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Bone Broken: 2Pac Takes Over At No. 1 | journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] | year=1996 | month=July | volume=108 | issue=28 | page=118 | issn=0006-2510 | accessdate=April 11, 2013}}</ref> However, in early 1996 Young left the label amidst a contract dispute and growing concerns that label boss [[Suge Knight]] was corrupt, financially dishonest and out of control. Later that year, he formed his own label, Aftermath Entertainment, under the distribution label for Death Row Records, [[Interscope Records]].<ref name="Allmusic"/> Subsequently, Death Row Records suffered poor sales by 1997, especially following the death of 2Pac and the [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] charges brought against Knight.<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Suge Knight – Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p279843|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|year=2003|accessdate=February 17, 2008}}</ref>

Dr. Dre also appeared on the single "[[No Diggity]]" by [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] group [[Blackstreet]] in 1996: it too was a sales success, topping the Hot 100 for four consecutive weeks, and later won the award for Best R&B Vocal by a Duo or Group at the [[1997 Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/blackstreet-mn0000049774 | title=Blackstreet - Biography | publisher=Allmusic | accessdate=April 11, 2013 | author=Huey, Steve}}</ref> After hearing it for the first time, several of Dr. Dre's former Death Row colleagues, including 2Pac, recorded and attempted to release a song titled "[[Toss It Up]]", containing numerous insults aimed at Dr. Dre and using a deliberately similar instrumental to "No Diggity", but were forced to replace the production after Blackstreet issued the label with a [[cease and desist]] order stopping them from distributing the song.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.11343/title.danny-boy-tells-all-about-death-row-years-part-two | title=Danny Boy Tells All About Death Row Years, Part Two | publisher=Cheri Media Group | work=HipHopDX | date=May 27, 2010 | accessdate=April 11, 2013 | author=Arnold, Paul W.}}</ref>

=== 1996–98: Move to Aftermath Entertainment ===
The ''[[Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath]]'' album, released on November 26, 1996, featured songs by Dr.&nbsp;Dre himself, as well as by newly signed [[Aftermath Entertainment]] artists, and a solo track "[[Been There, Done That]]", intended as a symbolic farewell to [[gangsta rap]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title="Dr. Dre Presents...The Aftermath" – Overview|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r243986|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=February 17, 2008}}</ref> Despite being classified platinum by the RIAA,<ref name="RIAA"/> the album was not very popular among music fans.<ref name="Allmusic"/> In October 1996, Dre performed "Been There, Done That" on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Dana Carvey/Dr. Dre|url=http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/episodes/Show_963.shtml|series=[[Saturday Night Live]]|number=22-4|airdate=1996-10-26|network=[[NBC]]}}</ref> In 1997, Dr. Dre produced several tracks on [[The Firm (hip hop group)|The Firm]]'s ''[[The Album (The Firm album)|The Album]]''; it was met with largely negative reviews from critics.

The turning point for Aftermath came in 1998, when Jimmy Iovine, the head of Aftermath's parent label Interscope, suggested that Dr. Dre sign [[Eminem]], a rapper from [[Detroit]].

On June 25, 2010, The [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] honored Dr. Dre with its Founders Award for inspiring other musicians.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Gail|title= Dr. Dre To Be Honored By ASCAP|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957947/dr-dre-to-be-honored-by-ascap|work=Billboard|accessdate=June 5, 2010|date=June 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Founders Award Dr. Dre|url=http://www.ascap.com/eventsawards/awards/rsawards/2010/FoundersAward.aspx|publisher=American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref>

In an August 2010 interview, Dr. Dre stated that an [[instrumental]] album titled ''The Planets'' is in its first stages of production; each song being named after a [[planet]] in the [[Solar System]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Barrow|first=Jerry|title=Dr. Dre Talks The Detox Wait,"Under Pressure" Frustration And Instrumental Album|url=http://www.vibe.com/posts/dr-dre-talks-detox-waitunder-pressure-frustration-and-instrumental-album|work=Vibe|date=August 3, 2010|accessdate=August 5, 2010}}</ref> On September 3, Dr. Dre showed support to longtime protégé [[Eminem]], and appeared on his and [[Jay-Z]]'s [[The Home & Home Tour|Home & Home Tour]], performing hit songs such as "Still D.R.E.," "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang," and "Crack a Bottle," alongside [[Eminem]] and another protégé, 50 Cent. Sporting an "R.I.P. Proof" shirt, Dre was honored by Eminem telling Detroit's Comerica Park to do the same. They did so, by chanting "DEEE-TOX," to which he replied, "I'm coming!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapfix.mtv.com/2010/09/02/eminem-jay-z-concert-detroit/?xrs=share_twitter |title=Eminem And Jay-Z: We’re Live From Detroit! |publisher=Rapfix.mtv.com |accessdate=September 20, 2010}}</ref>

On November 14, 2011, Dre announced that he will be taking a break from music once he has finished producing for artists [[Slim the Mobster]] and [[Kendrick Lamar]]. In this break he will work on bringing his Beats By Dre to a standard as high as Apple and will also spend time with his family.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harling |first=Danielle |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.17603/title.dr-dre-says-after-27-years-of-working-on-music-hes-taking-a-break |title=Dr. Dre Says After 27 Years Of Working On Music He's Taking A Break &#124; Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2011-11-14 |accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref>

== Musical influences and style ==
Dr.&nbsp;Dre has said that his primary instrument in the studio is the [[Music Production Center|Akai MPC3000]], a drum machine and sampler, and that he often uses as many as four or five to produce a single recording. He cites 1970s [[funk]] musicians such as [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], [[Isaac Hayes]] and [[Curtis Mayfield]] as his primary musical influences. Unlike most rap producers, he tries to avoid samples as much as possible, preferring to have studio musicians re-play pieces of music he wants to use, because it allows him more flexibility to change the pieces in rhythm and tempo.<ref name="scratch 2004">{{cite web|title=Dr. Dre Interview|url=http://www.dr-dre.com/info/interview_scratch_dr_dre.php|work=[[Scratch (magazine)|Scratch]]|month=May | year=2004|accessdate=December 6, 2006}}</ref> In 2001 he told ''Time'' magazine, "I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me, but I'd rather use musicians to re-create the sound or elaborate on it. I can control it better."<ref name="in the doctor's house">{{Cite news|last=Tyrangiel|first=Josh|authorlink=Josh Tyrangiel|title=In the Doctor's House|url=http://www.time.com/time/musicgoesglobal/na/mdre.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100831152555/http://www.time.com/time/musicgoesglobal/na/mdre.html|archivedate=2010-08-31|periodical=TIME|volume=158|issue=14|date=September 15, 2001|accessdate=January 12, 2007|ref=harv|postscript=}}</ref> Other equipment he uses include the [[E-mu SP-1200]] drum machine and other keyboards from such manufacturers as Korg, Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Moog, and Roland.<ref>{{harvnb|Ro|2007|p=234}}</ref>

After founding Aftermath Entertainment in 1996, Dr.&nbsp;Dre took on producer [[Mel-Man]] as a co-producer, and his music took on a more synthesizer-based sound, using fewer vocal samples (as he had used on "Lil' Ghetto Boy" and "Let Me Ride" on ''The Chronic'', for example). Mel-Man has not shared co-production credits with Dr.&nbsp;Dre since approximately 2002, but fellow Aftermath producer Focus has credited Mel-Man as a key architect of the signature Aftermath sound.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Focus|url=http://www.aftermathmusic.com/_interviews/focus_may_2004.html|publisher=[[Aftermath Music]]|date=March 14, 2004|accessdate=December 8, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070210083642/http://www.aftermathmusic.com/_interviews/focus_may_2004.html |archivedate = February 10, 2007}}</ref>

In 1999, Dr.&nbsp;Dre started working with [[Mike Elizondo]], a bassist, guitarist, and keyboardist who has also produced, written and played on records for female singers such as [[Ann Danielewski|Poe]], [[Fiona Apple]] and [[Alanis Morissette]],<ref>{{cite web|title= Mike Elizondo – Credits|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p240514|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=March 2, 2008}}</ref> In the past few years Elizondo has since worked for many of Dr.&nbsp;Dre's productions.<ref name="shock">{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|title=Dr. Dre Hoping To 'Shock' On Next Album|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/61651/dr-dre-hoping-to-shock-on-next-album|work=Billboard|date=August 25, 2005|accessdate=March 2, 2008}}</ref><ref name="songwriter universe">{{cite web|last=Kawashima|first=Dale|title=Superhot Mike Elizondo Co-Writes/Produces "Just Lose It" for Eminem, "In Da Club" for 50 Cent|url=http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/elizondo.htm|work=Songwriter Universe|year=2005|accessdate=December 6, 2006}}</ref> Dr.&nbsp;Dre also told ''[[Scratch (magazine)|Scratch]]'' magazine in a 2004 interview that he has been studying piano and music theory formally, and that a major goal is to accumulate enough musical theory to score movies. In the same interview he stated that he has collaborated with famed 1960s songwriter [[Burt Bacharach]] by sending him hip hop beats to play over, and hopes to have an in-person collaboration with him in the future.<ref name="scratch 2004"/>

=== Work ethic ===
Dr.&nbsp;Dre has stated that he is a perfectionist and is known to pressure the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances.<ref name="scratch 2004"/> In 2006, Snoop Dogg told the website Dubcnn.com that Dr.&nbsp;Dre had made new artist [[Bishop Lamont]] re-record a single bar of vocals 107&nbsp;times.<ref>{{cite web|title=Snoop Dogg Interview, Part 1|url=http://www.dubcnn.com/interviews/snoopdogg06/part1/|publisher=West Coast News Network|month=July | year=2006|accessdate=October 8, 2006}}</ref> Dr.&nbsp;Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his similar work ethic.<ref name="scratch 2004"/> He gives a lot of input into the delivery of the vocals and will stop an [[MC]] during a take if it isn't to his liking.<ref>Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 285-286.</ref> However, he does give [[MC]]s he works with room to write lyrics without too much instruction unless it is a specifically conceptual record, as noted by [[Bishop Lamont]] in the book ''[[How to Rap]]''.<ref>Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 234-235.</ref>

A consequence of his perfectionism is that some artists that initially sign deals with Dr.&nbsp;Dre's Aftermath label never release albums. In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack to the movie ''The Wash'', featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr.&nbsp;Dre. Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include [[King Tee]], ''2001'' vocalist Hittman, [[Joell Ortiz]], [[Raekwon]] and [[Rakim]].<ref name="source 2003">{{Cite news|title=Before & Aftermath|newspaper=[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]|pages=100–102|issue=168|date=September 2003|url=http://www.hiphopgame.com/index2.php3?page=dresource|ref=harv|postscript=}}</ref>

=== Collaborators and co-producers ===
Over the years, word of other collaborators who have contributed to Dr.&nbsp;Dre's work has surfaced. During his tenure at Death Row Records, it was alleged that Dr.&nbsp;Dre's stepbrother Warren G and [[Tha Dogg Pound]] member [[Daz Dillinger|Daz]] made many uncredited contributions to songs on his solo album ''The Chronic'' and Snoop Doggy Dogg's album ''[[Doggystyle]]'' (Daz received production credits on Snoop's similar-sounding, albeit less successful album ''Tha Doggfather'' after Young left Death Row Records).<ref name=DPG-Eulogy>Tha Dogg Pound. (2005). ''[[DPG Eulogy]]'' [DVD]. Innovative Distribution Network. Retrieved April 27, 2008.</ref>

It is known that [[Scott Storch]], who has since gone on to become a successful producer in his own right, contributed to Dr.&nbsp;Dre's second album ''2001''; Storch is credited as a songwriter on several songs and played keyboards on several tracks. In 2006 he told ''Rolling Stone'':
<blockquote>"At the time, I saw Dr.&nbsp;Dre desperately needed something," Storch says. "He needed a fuel injection, and Dr.&nbsp;Dre utilized me as the nitrous oxide. He threw me into the mix, and I sort of tapped on a new flavor with my whole piano sound and the strings and orchestration. So I'd be on the keyboards, and Mike [Elizondo] was on the bass guitar, and Dr.&nbsp;Dre was on the drum machine".<ref>{{cite web|title=Scott Storch's Outrageous Fortune|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10699242/scott_storchs_outrageous_fortune/print|work=Rolling Stone|date=June 29, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080419055040/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10699242/scott_storchs_outrageous_fortune/print|archivedate=April 19, 2008}}</ref></blockquote>

Current collaborator [[Mike Elizondo]], when speaking about his work with Young, describes their recording process as a collaborative effort involving several musicians. In 2004 he claimed to ''Songwriter Universe'' magazine that he had written the foundations of the hit Eminem song "[[The Real Slim Shady]]", stating, "I initially played a bass line on the song, and Dr.&nbsp;Dre, Tommy Coster Jr. and I built the track from there. [[Eminem]] then heard the track, and he wrote the rap to it."<ref name="songwriter universe"/> This account is essentially confirmed by Eminem in his book ''Angry Blonde'', stating that the tune for the song was composed by a studio bassist and keyboardist while Dr.&nbsp;Dre was out of the studio but Young later programmed the song's beat after returning.<ref>{{cite book|last=Eminem|authorlink=Eminem|title=Angry Blonde|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dmIJ1crh9DwC|year=2000|place=New York City|publisher=[[Regan Books]]|isbn=0-06-620922-6 |page=107}}</ref>

A group of disgruntled former associates of Dr.&nbsp;Dre complained that they had not received their full due for work on the label in the September 2003 issue of ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]''. A producer named Neff-U claimed to have produced the songs "Say What You Say" and "My Dad's Gone Crazy" on ''[[The Eminem Show]]'', the songs "If I Can't" and "Back Down" on 50 Cent's ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (album)|Get Rich or Die Tryin']]'', and the beat featured on Dr.&nbsp;Dre's commercial for [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors beer]].<ref name="source 2003"/>

Although Young studies piano and musical theory, he serves as more of a [[conductor (music)|conductor]] than a musician himself, as Josh Tyrangiel of ''TIME'' magazine has noted:

<blockquote>Every Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine in a room full of trusted musicians. (They carry beepers. When he wants to work, they work.) He'll program a beat, then ask the musicians to play along; when Dre hears something he likes, he isolates the player and tells him how to refine the sound. "My greatest talent," Dre says, "is knowing exactly what I want to hear."<ref name="in the doctor's house"/></blockquote> 

Although Snoop Dogg retains working relationships with Warren G and Daz, who are alleged to be uncredited contributors on the hit albums ''The Chronic'' and ''Doggystyle'', he states that Dr.&nbsp;Dre is capable of making beats without the help of collaborators, and that he is responsible for the success of his numerous albums.<ref>{{cite web|title=Snoop Dogg Interview Part 4|url=http://www.dubcnn.com/interviews/snoopdogg06/part4/|publisher=West Coast News Network|month=July | year=2006|accessdate=October 8, 2006}}</ref> Dr.&nbsp;Dre's prominent studio collaborators, including [[Scott Storch]], Elizondo, [[Mark Batson]] and [[Dawaun Parker]], have shared co-writing, instrumental, and more recently co-production credits on the songs where he is credited as the producer.

=== Ghostwriters ===
It is acknowledged that most of Dr.&nbsp;Dre's raps are written for him by others, though he retains ultimate control over his lyrics and the themes of his songs.<ref name="Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC">Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 229.</ref> As Aftermath producer Mahogany told ''Scratch'': "It's like a class room in [the booth]. He'll have three writers in there. They'll bring in something, he'll recite it, then he'll say. 'Change this line, change this word,' like he's grading papers."<ref name="scratch 2006">{{Cite news|last=Barrow|first=Jerry L.|last2=Basch|first2=Josephine|last3=Blanco|first3=Alvin|last4=Golianopolous|first4=Thomas|title=The Legend of Detox|periodical=[[Scratch (magazine)|Scratch]]|date=September/October 2006|ref=harv|postscript=}}</ref>
As seen in the credits for tracks Young has appeared on, there are often multiple people who contribute to his songs (although often in hip hop many people are officially credited as a writer for a song, even the producer). 

In the book ''[[How to Rap]]'', [[RBX]] explains that writing ''[[The Chronic]]'' was a "team effort"<ref name="Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC"/> and details how he [[ghostwriter|ghostwrote]] "[[Let Me Ride]]" for Dre.<ref name="Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC"/> In regard to ghostwriting lyrics he says, "Dre doesn't profess to be no super-duper rap dude – Dre is a super-duper producer".<ref name="Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC"/> As a member of N.W.A, The D.O.C. wrote lyrics for him while he stuck with producing.<ref name="doc formula"/> New York City rapper [[Jay-Z]] ghostwrote lyrics for the single "Still D.R.E." from Dr.&nbsp;Dre's album ''2001''.<ref name="changes 2001">{{cite news|last=Gill|first=John|title=Dr. Dre Changes Album Title...

== Personal life ==

=== Relationships and family ===
Dr. Dre's eldest son is named Curtis Young. When Curtis Young was born, Greene was 16, and Dr. Dre was 17. Curtis Young is an aspiring rapper who goes by the rap moniker "Hood Surgeon".<ref>{{harvnb|Ro|2007|p=19}}</ref> In 1988, Dr. Dre had his second son, Andre Young Jr., with Jenita Porter. Porter sued Dr. Dre in 1990 in Orange County Superior Court seeking $5,000 of child support per month.<ref name="Andre Jr"/> From 1990 to 1996, Dr. Dre dated singer [[Michel'le]], who frequently contributed vocals to Death Row Records albums.

=== Income ===
In 2001, Dr.&nbsp;Dre earned a total of about US$52&nbsp;million from selling part of his share of Aftermath Entertainment to [[Interscope Records]] and his production of such hit songs that year as "[[Family Affair (Mary J. Blige song)|Family Affair]]" by [[Mary J. Blige]]. ''Rolling Stone'' magazine thus named him the second highest-paid artist of the year.<ref name="wealth 2001"/> Dr.&nbsp;Dre was ranked 44th in 2004 from earnings of $11.4&nbsp;million, primarily from production royalties from such projects as albums from [[G-Unit]] and [[D12]] and the single "[[Rich Girl (Gwen Stefani song)|Rich Girl]]" by singer [[Gwen Stefani]] and rapper [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]].<ref name="wealth 2004">{{cite web|last=LaFranco|first=Robert|title=Money Makers|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6959138/money_makers/print|date=February 10, 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080402071008/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6959138/money_makers/print|archivedate=April 2, 2008}}</ref> Forbes estimated his net worth at US$270 million in 2012.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/special-report/2012/forbesfive.html The Forbes Five: Hip-Hop's Wealthiest Artists].
