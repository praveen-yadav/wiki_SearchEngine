'''Amy Lee Grant''' (born November 25, 1960) is an American [[singer-songwriter]], musician, author, [[media personality]] and actress, best known for performing [[contemporary Christian music|Christian music]]. She has been referred to as "The Queen of Christian Pop".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Story?id=131919 |title=Interview With Amy Grant and Vince Gill|publisher=ABC News|date=October 3, 2002 |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Brounstein |first=Laura |url=http://www.lhj.com/style/covers/in-perfect-harmony-vince-gill-amy-grant/ |title=In Perfect Harmony: Vince Gill & Amy Grant |work=Ladies' Home Journal|month=November|year=2006|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}</ref> As of 2009, Grant remains the best-selling contemporary Christian music singer ever,{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} having sold over 30 million units worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann |first=William |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/amy-grant-mn0000024944 |title=Amy Grant - Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=March 7, 2013}}</ref>

Grant made her debut as a teenager, and gained fame in [[Christian music]] during the 1980s with such hits as "Father's Eyes", "[[El Shaddai (song)|El Shaddai]]", and "[[Angels (Amy Grant song)|Angels]]". In 1986, she scored her first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] No.&nbsp;1 song in a duet with [[Peter Cetera]], "[[The Next Time I Fall]]". During the 1980s and 1990s, she became one of the first CCM artists to [[Crossover (music)|cross over]] into mainstream pop on the heels of her successful albums ''[[Unguarded]]'' and ''[[Heart in Motion]]'', the latter of which included the No.&nbsp;1 single "[[Baby Baby (Amy Grant song)|Baby Baby]]".

Grant has won six [[Grammy Award]]s, 25 [[Gospel Music Association]] [[Dove Award]]s, and had the first Christian album ever to go [[Platinum album|Platinum]].<ref name="cnn">{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0312/06/lkl.00.html|title=Interview With Amy Grant, Vince Gill|accessdate=August 29, 2008|publisher=CNN|year=2003|author=CNN}}</ref> ''Heart in Motion'' is her highest-selling album, with over five million copies sold in the United States alone. She was honored with a star on [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2005 for her contributions to the entertainment industry.

==Early career==
In 1976, Grant wrote her first song ("Mountain Man"), performed in public for the first time at [[Harpeth Hall School]], the all-girls school she attended, recorded a demo tape for her parents with church youth-leader [[Brown Bannister]], then later when Bannister was dubbing a copy of the tape, [[Chris Christian]], the owner of the recording studio, heard the demo and called [[Word Records]]. He played it over the phone, and she was offered a recording contract, five weeks before her 16th birthday. In 1977, she recorded her first album titled ''[[Amy Grant (album)|Amy Grant]]'', produced by Brown Bannister (who would also produce her next 11 albums). It was released in the Spring of 1978, one month before her high school graduation. That fall she performed her first ticketed concert—in Fort Worth, Texas—after beginning her first year at [[Furman University]]. In May 1979, while at the album release party for her second album, ''[[My Father's Eyes (album)|My Father's Eyes]]'', Grant met [[Gary Chapman (musician)|Gary Chapman]], writer of the title track (and future husband). Grant & Chapman toured together the summer of 1979. In the fall of 1980, she transferred to [[Vanderbilt University]], where she was a member of the sorority [[Kappa Alpha Theta]].<ref name="Mosaic"/> Grant then made a few more albums before dropping out of college to pursue a career in music—''[[Never Alone]]'', followed by a pair of live albums in 1981 (''[[In Concert (Amy Grant album)|In Concert]]'' and ''[[In Concert Volume Two (Amy Grant album)|In Concert Volume Two]]''), both backed by an augmented edition of the [[DeGarmo and Key|DeGarmo & Key]] band. It was during these early shows that Grant also established one of her concert trademarks: performing barefoot. To date, Grant continues to take off her shoes midway through performances, as she has said "it is just more comfortable."<ref>''Preston and Steve'' radio show excerpt; May 2008</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://feet.thefuntimesguide.com/2008/05/celebrity_barefoot_in_public.php |title=feet.thefuntimesguide.com |publisher=feet.thefuntimesguide.com |date= |accessdate=March 7, 2013}}</ref>

1982 saw the release of her breakthrough album ''[[Age to Age]]''. The album contains the signature track, "[[El Shaddai (song)|El Shaddai]]" (written by [[Michael Card]]) and the Grant-Chapman penned song, "In a Little While". "El Shaddai" was later awarded one of the "[[Songs of the Century]]" by the [[RIAA]] in 2001. Grant received her first [[Grammy Award]] for Best Contemporary Gospel Performance, as well as two [[GMA Dove Awards]] for Gospel Artist of the Year and Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year. ''Age to Age'' became the first Christian album by a solo artist to be certified gold (1983) and the first Christian album to be certified platinum (1985).<ref name="cnn"/>

In the mid-1980s, Grant began touring and recording with young up-and-coming songwriter [[Michael W. Smith]]. Grant and Smith continue to have a strong friendship and creative relationship, often writing songs for or contributing vocals to each other's albums. During the 1980s, Grant was also a backup singer for [[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)|Bill Gaither]].<ref name="billgaither">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprofile.com/article/5501.html|title=Bill  Gaither: The Gospel of Giving|accessdate=April 25, 2009|publisher=American Profile|author=Beverly Keel}}</ref>

Grant followed up this album with the first of her Christmas albums—albums that later would be the basis for her holiday shows. In 1984, she released another pop-oriented Christian hit, ''[[Straight Ahead (Amy Grant album)|Straight Ahead]]'', earning Grant her first appearance at the [[Grammy Awards]] show in 1985. The head of [[NBC]] took notice of Grant's performance and called her manager to book her for her own Christmas special.<ref name="Mosaic"/>

==Widening audience==
Hardly had Grant established herself as the "Queen of Christian Pop" when she changed directions to widen her fan base (and hence her musical message). Her goal was to become the first Christian singer-songwriter who was also successful as a contemporary pop singer.<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite web|url=http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/articles/ung/85jun6rollingstone.pdf|title=Grant Wants To Put God On Pop Charts|accessdate=August 30, 2011|publisher=Rolling Stone|year=1985|author=Michael Goldberg}}</ref> ''[[Unguarded]]'' (1985) surprised some fans for its very mainstream sound (and Grant's leopard-print jacket, in four poses for four different covers). "[[ Find a Way (Amy Grant song)|Find a Way]]", from ''Unguarded'', became the first non-Christmas Christian song to hit [[The Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Top 40]] list, also reaching No. 7 on the [[Adult Contemporary]] chart. She also scored No.&nbsp;18 on ''Billboard'' AC in 1986 with "[[Stay for Awhile]]".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Grant scored her first ''Billboard'' No. 1 song in 1986 with "[[The Next Time I Fall]]", a duet with former [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] singer/bassist [[Peter Cetera]]. That year, she also recorded a duet with singer [[Randy Stonehill]] for his ''[[Love Beyond Reason]]'' album, titled "I Could Never Say Goodbye", and recorded ''The Animals' Christmas'' with [[Art Garfunkel]].

''[[Lead Me On (Amy Grant album)|Lead Me On]]'' (1988) contained many songs that were about Christianity and love relationships, but some interpreted it as not being an obviously "Christian" record. Years later, ''Lead Me On'' would be chosen as the greatest Contemporary Christian album of all time by ''[[CCM Magazine]]''. The mainstream song "Saved by Love" was a minor hit, receiving airplay on radio stations featuring the newly emerging Adult Contemporary format. The album's title song received some pop radio airplay and [[Crossover (music)|crossed over]] to No. 96 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and "1974 (We Were Young)" and "Saved By Love" also charted as Adult Contemporary songs. In 1989, she appeared in a [[Target Corporation|Target]] ad campaign, performing songs off the album.<ref name="target">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_n19_v28/ai_8089589|title=Rabbit stars in Target holiday promo – Target Stores Inc., Velveteen Rabbit|accessdate=August 29, 2008|publisher=Gale Group|year=1989|author=Gale Group}}</ref>

==In the mainstream==
[[File:Amy Grant in 1998.jpg|thumb |Grant during her ''Behind the Eyes'' tour in 1998]]
When ''[[Heart in Motion]]'' was released in 1991, many fans were surprised that the album was so clearly one of contemporary pop music. Grant's desire to widen her audience was frowned upon by the confines of the popular definitions of ministry at the time.<ref name="fans">{{cite web|url=http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/articles/him/5.html#t|title=Christian Fans Ask Too Much Of Amy Grant|accessdate=August 29, 2008|work=The Arizona Republic|year=1991|author=Kim Sue Lia Perkes}}</ref> The track "[[Baby Baby (Amy Grant song)|Baby Baby]]" (written for Grant's newborn daughter, Millie, whose "six-week-old face was my inspiration,") became a pop hit (hitting No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100), and Grant was established as a name in the mainstream music world. "Baby Baby" received Grammy nominations for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Record and Song of the Year (although it failed to win in any of those categories). Four other hits from the album made the Pop top 20: "[[Every Heartbeat]]" (No. 2), "[[That's What Love Is For]]" (No. 7), "[[Good for Me (song)|Good for Me]]" (No. 8), and "[[I Will Remember You (Amy Grant song)|I Will Remember You]]" (No. 20). On the Adult Contemporary chart, all five songs were top 10 hits, with two of the five ("Baby Baby" and "That's What Love Is For") reaching No. 1. Many Christian fans remained loyal, putting the album atop ''Billboard'' Contemporary Christian Chart for 32 weeks. ''Heart in Motion'' is Grant's best-selling album, having sold over five million copies according to the RIAA.<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=2&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=Heart%20In%20Motion&artist=Grant&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25|title=Amy Grant – RIAA|accessdate=August 29, 2008|publisher=RIAA|year=2008|author=RIAA}}</ref> Grant followed the album with her second Christmas album, ''[[Home For Christmas (Amy Grant album)|Home For Christmas]]'' in 1992, which included the song "[[Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song)]]", written by [[Chris Eaton (UK musician)|Chris Eaton]] and Grant, and would later be covered by many artists, including [[Donna Summer]], [[Jessica Simpson]] (who acknowledged Grant as one of her favorite artists), [[Vince Gill]], [[Sara Groves]], [[Point of Grace]], and Broadway star [[Barbara Cook]].

''[[House of Love (Amy Grant album)|House of Love]]'' in 1994 continued in the same vein, boasting catchy pop songs mingled with spiritual lyrics. The album was a multi-platinum success and produced the pop hit "[[Lucky One (song)|Lucky One]]" (No. 18 pop and No. 2 AC; No. 1 on [[Radio & Records]]) as well as the title track (a duet with country music star and future husband [[Vince Gill]]) (No. 37 pop) and a cover of Joni Mitchell's frequently covered "[[Big Yellow Taxi]]" (No. 67 pop) (in which she changed the line "And they charged the people ''a dollar and a half'' just to see em" to "And then they charged the people ''25 bucks'' just to see em").

After she covered the [[10cc]] song "The Things We Do For Love" for the ''[[Mr. Wrong (film)|Mr. Wrong]]'' soundtrack, ''[[Behind the Eyes (Amy Grant album)|Behind the Eyes]]'' was released in September 1997. The album struck a much darker note, leaning more towards downtempo, acoustic soft-rock songs, with more mature (yet still optimistic) lyrics. She called it her "razor blades and [[Prozac]]" album.<ref name="pitt">{{cite web|url=http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/2001/50.html|title=Amy Grant's career comes full circle |accessdate=August 29, 2008|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |year=2002|author=Rosa Colucci}}</ref> Although "Takes A Little Time" was a moderate hit single, the album failed to sell like the previous two albums, which had both gone multi-platinum. ''Behind The Eyes'' was eventually certified Gold by the [[RIAA]]. The video for "Takes A Little Time" was a new direction for Grant; with a blue light filter, acoustic guitar, the streets and characters of New York City, and a plot, Grant was re-cast as an adult light rocker. She followed up "Behind The Eyes" with ''[[A Christmas To Remember]]'', her third Christmas album, in 1999. The album was certified Gold in 2000.

In 2001, Grant sang "[[God Bless America]]" in front of a sellout crowd at the Owen County Fair Grounds in [[Spencer, Indiana]]. She dedicated her performance to the victims of [[9/11]], and officially started the Demolition Derby. Following the 9/11 attacks, Grant's "[[I Will Remember You (Amy Grant song)|I Will Remember You]]" saw a resurgence in popularity as many radio DJs mixed a special tribute version of the song. That same year, Grant won $125,000 for charity on the "Rock Star Edition" of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]''<ref name="ew">{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,98722,00.html|title=Million Dollar Babies |accessdate=August 29, 2008|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Liane Bonin|date=February 9, 2001| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081007163747/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,98722,00.html| archivedate= October 7, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Return to gospel==
Grant returned to her [[gospel music]] roots with the 2002 release of ''[[Legacy... Hymns and Faith]]''. The album featured a Vince Gill-influenced mix of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and gospel and marked Grant's 25th anniversary in the music industry. Grant followed this up with the pop release ''[[Simple Things (Amy Grant album)|Simple Things]]'' in 2003. The album did not have the success of her previous pop or gospel efforts. However, soon after ''Simple Things'', Grant and [[Interscope]]/A&M parted ways. The same year, Grant was inducted into the [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]] by the [[Gospel Music Association]], an industry trade organization of which she is a longstanding member, in her first year of eligibility. Grant released a sequel to her [[hymns]] collection in 2005 titled ''[[Rock of Ages...Hymns and Faith|Rock of Ages... Hymns & Faith]]''.

==Looking ahead==
Grant joined the reality television phenomenon by hosting ''[[Three Wishes (TV series)|Three Wishes]]'', a show in which she and a team of helpers make wishes come true for small-town residents.<ref name="tw">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/three_wishes/series_about.jhtml|title=Three Wishes|accessdate=August 29, 2008|publisher=[[Country Music Television]], Inc.|year=2008|author=CMT}}</ref> The show debuted on [[NBC]] in the fall of 2005 but was canceled at the end of its first season because of high production costs. After ''Three Wishes'' was canceled, Grant won her 6th Grammy Award for ''Rock of Ages... Hymns & Faith''. In a February 2006 webchat, Grant stated she believes her "best music is still ahead".

In April 2006, a live CD/DVD titled ''[[Time Again...Amy Grant Live]]'' was recorded in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], at [[Bass Performance Hall]]. (Grant's first paid public performance was at the Will Rogers Auditorium in Fort Worth.) The concert was released on September 26, 2006. In addition to receiving a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], media appearances included write-ups in ''[[CCM Magazine]]'', and a performance on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''.

In a February 2007 web chat on her web site, Grant discussed a book she was working on titled ''[[Mosaic: Pieces of My Life So Far]]'', saying, "It's not an autobiography, but more a collection of memories, song lyrics, poetry and a few pictures." The book was released on October 16, 2007. In November, it debuted at No. 35 on the [[New York Times Best Seller list]].<ref name="book1">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/books/bestseller/1104besthardnonfiction.html?_r=3&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin|title=Hardcover Nonfiction|accessdate=December 6, 2007|work=The New York Times|author=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 4, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071031075915/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/books/bestseller/1104besthardnonfiction.html?_r=3&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin| archivedate= October 31, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In the same web chat, Grant noted that she is "anxious to get back in the studio after the book is finished, and reinvent myself as an almost-50 performing woman".

2007 was Grant's 30th year in music. She left Word/Warner, and contracted with EMI CMG who re-released her regular studio albums as remastered versions on August 14, 2007. Marking the start of Grant's new contract is a career-spanning [[Greatest Hits (Amy Grant album)|greatest hits]] album, with all the songs digitally remastered. The album was released as both a single-disc CD edition, and a 2-Disc CD/DVD Special Edition, the DVD featuring music videos and interviews.<ref name="EMI">{{cite web|url=http://www.emicmg.com/press/printPress.aspx?id=529387|title=EMI Music Signs Worldwide Catalog Partnership with Amy Grant|accessdate=September 10, 2007|publisher=EMI Christian Music Group|year=2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071014202127/http://emicmg.com/press/printPress.aspx?id=529387| archivedate= October 14, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In February 2008, Grant joined the writing team from [[Compassionart]] as a guest vocalist at the Abbey Road studios, London, to record a song called "Highly Favoured", which was included on the album ''[[CompassionArt (album)|CompassionArt]]''.

[[File:Amy Grant October 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Grant performing in October 2008]]
On June 24, 2008, Grant re-released her 1988 album, ''Lead Me On'', in honor of its 20th anniversary. The two-disc release includes the original album and a second disc with new acoustic recordings, live performances from 1989, and interviews with Amy. Grant recreated the ''Lead Me On'' tour in the fall of 2008.

On June 27, 2008, Grant surprised everyone at the [[Creation Festival|Creation Northeast Festival]] by being the special guest. She performed "Lead Me On" and a few other songs backed with the [[Hawk Nelson]] band. At the end of the concert, Grant returned to the stage and sang "Thy Word". She appeared on the 2008 album ''[[Anne Murray Duets: Friends & Legends]]'' singing "Could I Have This Dance".

In May 2009 for Mother's Day, Grant released an EP on iTunes containing two new songs, "She Colors My Day," and "Unafraid", as well as the older songs "Baby Baby" and "Oh How The Years Go By".

In 2010, Grant released ''[[Somewhere Down the Road (Amy Grant album)|Somewhere Down the Road]]'', featuring the hit single "[[Better Than a Hallelujah]]", which peaked at No. 8 on ''Billboard'' Top Christian Songs chart. When asked about the new album during an interview with CBN.com, Grant says, "... my hope is just for those songs to provide companionship, remind myself and whoever else is listening what's important. I feel like songs have the ability to connect us to ourselves and to each other, and to our faith, to the love of Jesus, in a way that conversation doesn't do. Songs kind of slip in and move you before you realize it."<ref>[http://www.cbn.com/cbnmusic/interviews/amy-grant-somewhere-down-the-road-goodwyn.aspx Amy Grant: "Somewhere Down the Road"]. CBN.</ref>

In September 2012, Grant took part in a campaign called "30 Songs / 30 Days" to support ''[[Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide]]'', a multi-platform media project inspired by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn's book.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.halftheskymovement.org/blog/entry/30-songs-30-days-for-half-the-sky1 |title=30 Songs / 30 Days for Half the Sky |date=August 30, 2012 |accessdate=September 2, 2012 |publisher=Half the Sky Movement}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Born in [[Augusta, Georgia]], Grant is the youngest of four sisters. Her family settled in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1967.<ref name="Mosaic">{{cite book|last=Amy|first=Grant|title=Mosaic: Pieces of My Life So Far|year=2007|publisher=Flying Dolphin Press|isbn=0-385-52289-4|pages=198–203}}</ref> 

Grant attended [[Furman University]] in 1979 and 1980. There she performed one of her earliest paid, professional concerts, opening for [[Gene Cotton]] at McCalister Auditorium on the Furman campus. She left Furman and returned to Nashville to be closer to the recording studios and her then boyfriend, [[Gary Chapman (musician)|Gary Chapman]].{{Cn|date=November 2013}}

Grant married fellow Christian musician Gary Chapman on June 19, 1982.

In the December 1999 ''Baptist Standard'', Grant explained why she left Chapman and married Gill:

<blockquote>I didn't get a divorce because I had a great marriage and then along came Vince Gill. Gary and I had a rocky road from day one. I think what was so hard—and this is (what) one of our counselors said—sometimes an innocent party can come into a situation, and they're like a big spotlight.

==Public views and perception==
Among praise for her contributions to the Contemporary Christian genre, Grant has also generated controversy within the Christian community, from "complaints that she was too worldly and too sexy" to a "barrage of condemnation" following her divorce and remarriage.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E2D81F30F932A25756C0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 |title=Religion Journal; A Chastened Singer Returns to Christian Basics |accessdate=January 12, 2009 |last=Rabey |first=Steve |date=May 11, 2002 |work=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times }}</ref>

In an interview early in her career, Grant stated, "I have a healthy sense of right and wrong, but sometimes, for example, using foul, exclamation-point words among friends can be good for a laugh."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/articles/ung/8.html |title=Amy Grant: "I'm Not a Prude." |accessdate=July 5, 2012 |last=Jahr |first=Cliff |year=1985 |month=December |work=Amy Grant Article Archive |publisher=Ladies' Home Journal }}</ref> The article which was based on that interview was constructed in such a manner so as to make it appear as though Grant condoned premarital sex. Later Grant reflected on how the article misrepresented her views, stating: "We probably talked for two hours about sexual purity, but when the interview finally came out he worded it in such a way that it sounded like I condoned premarital sex. So I picked up that article and thought,'You've made me say something I've never said, and you've totally disregarded two hours of Bible put in one flippant comment that I made about a moan.'"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.todayschristianmusic.com/artists/amy-grant/features/amy-s-own-words/ |title=Amy's Own Words |accessdate=July 12, 2012 |last=Styll |first=John |work=todayschristianmusic.com |publisher=Today's Christian Music}}</ref>
