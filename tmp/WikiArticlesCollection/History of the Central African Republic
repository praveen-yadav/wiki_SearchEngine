{{History of the Central African Republic}}
The known '''history of the Central African Republic''' dates back to the 7th century AD.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Early history==
The territory of modern [[Central African Republic]] is known to have been settled from at least the 7th century {{citation needed|date=December 2012}} on by overlapping empires, including the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu]], [[Ouaddai Kingdom|Ouaddai]], [[Baguirmi Kingdom|Baguirmi]], and Dafour groups based on the [[Lake Chad]] region and along the [[Upper Nile, Sudan|Upper Nile]]. Later, various [[sultanate]]s claimed present-day CAR, using the entire [[Oubangui]] region as a source of [[Slavery|slave]], from which [[Arab slave trade|slaves were traded north]] across the [[Sahara Desert]]. Population [[Migration (human)|migration]] in the 18th and 19th centuries brought new migrants into the area, including the [[Zande people|Zande]], [[Banda (CAR)|Banda]], and [[Gbaya people|Baya-Mandjia]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Colonial to Decolonization ==

===French colony 1894-1940===
In 1875 the [[Sudan]]ese sultan [[Rabih az-Zubayr]] governed Upper-Oubangui, which included present-day CAR. Europeans, primarily the French, German, and [[Belgium|Belgians]], arrived in the area in 1885. The French consolidated their legal claim to the area through an 1887 convention with [[Congo Free State]], which granted France possession of the right bank of the [[Oubangui River]]. Two years later, the French established an outpost at [[Bangui]], and in 1894, [[Oubangui-Chari]] became a French territory. However, the French did not consolidate their control over the area until 1903, after having defeated the forces of Rabih in the [[battle of Kousséri]], and established colonial administration throughout the territory. In 1906, the Oubangui-Chari territory was united with the [[Chad]] colony; in 1910, it became one of the four territories of the [[Federation of French Equatorial Africa]] (AEF), along with Chad, [[Republic of the Congo|Middle Congo]], and [[Gabon]]. The next thirty years were marked by mostly small scale revolts against French rule and the development of a [[plantation]]-style economy. The largest of these revolts was the [[Kongo-Wara rebellion]], when over 350,000 natives rebelled against the colonial administration.

=== Decolonization 1940-1960===
In August 1940, the territory responded, with the rest of the AEF, to the call from General [[Charles de Gaulle]] to fight for [[Free France]]. After World War II, the [[French Constitution]] of 1946 inaugurated the first of a series of reforms that led eventually to complete independence for all French territories in western and equatorial Africa. In 1946, all AEF inhabitants were granted French citizenship and allowed to establish local assemblies. The assembly in CAR was led by [[Barthélemy Boganda]], a Catholic priest who also was known for his forthright statements in the French Assembly on the need for African [[abolitionism|emancipation]]. In 1956 French legislation eliminated certain voting inequalities and provided for the creation of some organs of self-government in each territory.

The French constitutional referendum of September 1958 dissolved the AEF, and on 1 December of the same year the Assembly declared the birth of the autonomous Central African Republic with Boganda as head of government. Boganda ruled until his death in a plane crash on 29 March 1959. His cousin, [[David Dacko]], replaced him as head of Government. On 12 July 1960 France agreed to the Central African Republic becoming fully independent.<ref>http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00D1FFA3D581A7A93C1A8178CD85F448685F9</ref> On 13 August 1960 the Central African Republic became an independent country and [[David Dacko]] became its first President.

==Post-colonialism ==

===Bokassa coup===
On 1 January 1966, following a swift and almost bloodless coup, Colonel [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]] assumed power as president of the Republic. Bokassa abolished the constitution of 1959, dissolved the National Assembly, and issued a decree that placed all legislative and executive powers in the hands of the president. On 4 December 1976, the republic became a monarchy—the [[Central African Empire]]—with the promulgation of the imperial constitution and the proclamation of the president as Emperor Bokassa I. His regime was characterized by numerous human rights atrocities.

===Dacko counter-coup===
On 20 September 1979, Dacko, with French support, led a bloodless coup that overthrew Bokassa while he was out of the country. The republic was restored, and Bokassa, who took refuge in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and France, was sentenced to death in absentia for various crimes, including [[cannibalism]]. Moreover, an African judicial commission reported that he had "almost certainly" taken part in the massacre of some 100 children for refusing to wear the compulsory school uniforms. In January 1981, six of his supporters, including two sons-in-law, were executed.

Bokassa made an unexpected return in October 1986 and was retried. On 12 June 1987, he was convicted of having ordered the murders of at least 20 prisoners and the arrest of the schoolchildren who were murdered. He was sentenced to death, but this was commuted to a life term in February 1988. He was released from prison on 1 September 1993, as a result of an amnesty. He died of a heart attack in [[Bangui]] on 3 November 1996 at age 75.

===Kolingba coup===
Dacko's efforts to promote economic and political reforms proved ineffectual, and on 20 September 1981, he in turn was overthrown in a bloodless coup by General [[André Kolingba]]. For four years, Kolingba led the country as head of the Military Committee for National Recovery (CRMN).

In 1985 the CRMN was dissolved, and Kolingba named a new cabinet with increased civilian participation, signaling the start of a return to civilian rule. The process of democratization quickened in 1986 with the creation of a new political party, the Rassemblement Démocratique Centrafricain (RDC), and the drafting of a new constitution that subsequently was ratified in a national referendum. General Kolingba was sworn in as constitutional President on 29 November 1986. The constitution established a National Assembly made up of 52 elected deputies, elected in July 1987.

===Multiparty elections===
Due to mounting political pressure, in 1991 President Kolingba announced the creation of National Commission to rewrite the constitution to provide for a [[multi-party]] system. Internal and international pressure led to multi-party presidential elections being held in 1992. Much of the resources for these first democratic elections since independence came from locally represented donors and agencies called the "Groupe informel des bailleurs de fonds et representants residents" (GIBAFOR). Help was also received from the UN Office of Electoral Assistance. Pressure came from the US and France. The elections were held, but the government provoked logistical problems and other irregularities so they could nullify the results as a means to prolong their stay in office.

Internal and international pressure in particular from France continued and in rescheduled elections held in October 1993, again with the help of the international community [[Ange-Félix Patassé]] won a second-round victory. This election also saw the first female African presidential candidate run, [[Jeanne-Marie Ruth-Rolland]].

Salary arrears, labor unrest, and unequal treatment of military officers from different ethnic groups had also been among the causes of the three mutinies against the Patassé government in 1996 and 1997. The French succeeded in helping it to quell the disturbances, and an African peacekeeping force (MISAB) occupied Bangui until 1998 when they were relieved by a United Nations peacekeeping mission ([[MINURCA]]). Economic difficulties caused by the looting and destruction during the 1996 and 1997 mutinies, energy crises, and government mismanagement continued to trouble Patassé's government through 2000. Despite several army mutinies and increasing civic concern both at his erratic style and arbitrary, corrupt method of governing he was re-elected for another 6-year term in September 1999.

In March 2000 the last of the MINURCA forces departed Bangui.

===Bozizé coup and rule===
On 15 March 2003 rebels who controlled part of the country moved into Bangui and installed their commander, General [[François Bozizé]], as president, while President Patassé was out of the country. Bozizé has since been elected President in an election considered by observers to be fair and free.

Patassé has been found guilty of major crimes in Bangui and CAR has brought a case to the International Criminal Court against him and Jean Pierre Bemba from the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo accusing them both of multiple crimes in suppressing one of the mutinies against Patasse. Civil tranquillity has yet to be established and parts of the country remain out of government control. The UN continues to maintain a peace building mission in Bangui.

Despite these shortcomings, and his promise to step down at the end of the transition, Bozizé contested the 13 March 2005 presidential elections in which all of the leading opposition candidates were allowed to run except for Patassé. Bozizé won on the second run-off round on 8 May 2005, defeating [[Martin Ziguélé]], who ran on the ticket of the MLPC, the former ruling party. The National Elections Commission declared Bozizé the winner with 64.6 percent of the vote to 35.4 percent for Ziguélé. The election was generally considered to be fair, although the absence of Patassé cast a shadow over the legitimacy of the process.

After Bozizé seized power in 2003, the [[Central African Republic Bush War]] began with the rebellion by the [[Union of Democratic Forces for Unity]] (UFDR), led by [[Michel Djotodia]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Stephanie |last=Hancock |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/feature-bush-war-leaves-central-african-villages-deserted |title=Feature&nbsp;- Bush war leaves Central African villages deserted |publisher=[[ReliefWeb]] |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=30 August 2007 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref> This quickly escalated into major fighting during 2004.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4035239.stm |title=Raid on CAR town 'leaves 20 dead' |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=23 December 2004 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref> The UFDR rebel forces consisted of three allies, the ''Groupe d'action patriotique pour la liberation de Centrafrique'' (GAPLC), the [[Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace]] (CPJP), the [[People's Army for the Restoration of Democracy (CAR)|People's Army for the Restoration of Democracy]] (APRD), the [[Movement of Central African Liberators for Justice]] (MLCJ), and the ''Front démocratique Centrafricain'' (FDC).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200611020004.html |title=Central African Republic: Rebels Call for Dialogue After Capturing Key Town |publisher=[[AllAfrica.com]] |agency=[[IRIN]] |date=2 November 2006 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref>

On 8 May 2005, Bozizé gained yet a further victory when his coalition, Convergence [[Kwa Na Kwa]], won 42 parliamentary seats in the legislative run-off vote. The MLPC came in second with 11 seats while the RDC won only eight seats. The remaining seats were won by independents or by smaller parties. In June later that year, the [[African Union]] (AU) lifted sanctions against the country, which had been applied after the 2003 coup.

In early 2006, Bozizé's government appeared stable. However, Patassé, who was living in exile in [[Togo]], could not be ruled out as a leader of a future uprising. His supporters reportedly were joining or were prepared to join rebel movements in belief that their leader was still the rightful head of state of the country. Further, members of Kolingba's [[Yakoma]] tribe in the south posed a potential threat to Bozizé's government because of their widespread boycott of the second round of the legislative elections. Members of the Yakoma dominate the army.

On 13 April 2007, a peace agreement between the government and the UFDR was signed in Birao. The agreement provided for an amnesty for the UFDR, its recognition as a political party, and the integration of its fighters into the army.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200611130081.html |title=Central African Republic: Concern As Civilians Flee, Government Denies Rebel Capture of Third Town |publisher=[[AllAfrica.com]] |agency=[[IRIN]] |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-04-13-central-africa_N.htm |title=Central African Republic, rebels sign peace deal |work=[[USA Today]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=13 April 2007 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref> Further negotiations resulted in an agreement in 2008 for reconciliation, a unity government, and local elections in 2009 and parliamentary and presidential elections in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2009/01/20/2003434210 |title=CAR president dissolves government, vows unity |work=[[Taipei Times]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=20 January 2009 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref> The new unity government that resulted was formed in January 2009.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iDaBqt-PZaqJ6IPUfGowi9_x95Ag |title=Touadera names rebels in new Central African Republic govt |publisher=[[Google News]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=19 January 2009 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref>

===Séléka Coup===

In late 2012 a coalition of old rebel groups under new name of [[Séléka CPSK-CPJP-UFDR|Séléka]] [[Central African Republic conflict (2012–present)|renewed fighting]]. Two other, previously unknown groups, the Alliance for Revival and Rebuilding (A2R) and the Patriotic Convention for Saving the Country (CPSK) also joined the coalition, as well as the Chadian group [[Popular Front for Recovery|FPR]],.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Le FPR soutient l'UFDR dans son combat contre le Dictateur Bozizé|url=http://ambenatna.over-blog.com/article-le-fpr-soutient-l-ufdr-dans-combat-contre-le-dictateur-bozize-113660691.html|publisher=FPR |date=18 December 2012|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref> On 27 December 2012, CAR President Francois Bozizé requested international assistance to help with the rebellion, in particular from France and the United States. [[President of France|French President]] [[Francois Hollande]] rejected the plea, saying that the 250 French troops stationed at [[Bangui M'Poko International Airport]] are there "in no way to intervene in the internal affairs".<ref>[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/International/2012/Dec-28/200123-car-leader-appeals-for-help-to-halt-rebel-advance.ashx#axzz2GInl7HTD CAR leader appeals for help to halt rebel advance (The Daily Star Lebanon)]</ref>

On 11 January 2013, a ceasefire agreement was signed in [[Libreville]], [[Gabon]]. The rebels dropped their demand for President François Bozizé to resign, but he had to appoint a new [[Prime Minister of the Central African Republic|prime minister]] from the opposition party by 18 January 2013.<ref name="NYT1">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/world/africa/rebels-agree-to-cease-fire-in-central-african-republic.html?_r=0|title=Rebel Coalition in Central African Republic Agrees to a Short Cease-Fire|last=Sayare|first=Scott|date=11 January 2013|work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref> On 13 January, Bozizé signed a decree that removed [[List of heads of government of the Central African Republic and Central African Empire|Prime Minister]] [[Faustin-Archange Touadéra]] from power, as part of the agreement with the rebel coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/prime-minister-booted-from-job-in-central-african-republic-part-of-peace-deal-with-rebels/2013/01/13/bcebaf14-5dcf-11e2-8acb-ab5cb77e95c8_print.html|title=Prime minister booted from job in Central African Republic, part of peace deal with rebels|date=13 January 2013|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=15 January 2013}}</ref> On 17 January, [[Nicolas Tiangaye]] was appointed  Prime Minister.<ref name=Fort>Patrick Fort, [http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i29CmpNUhK93R12SF_Oyz_6o5uug?docId=CNG.376beea6edfc8b0d9c41b73f138d6700.4f1 "Tiangaye named Central African PM, says 'hard work' begins"], Agence France-Presse, 17 January 2013.</ref>
