'''Alan Curtis Kay''' (born May 17, 1940) is an [[United States|American]] [[computer scientist]]. He has been elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[National Academy of Engineering]], and the [[Royal Society of Arts]].<ref>Alan Kay (1997):[http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/9697spr/node10.html The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet], Walt Disney Imagineering, transcript of a speech.</ref> He is best known for his pioneering work on [[object-oriented programming]] and [[Window (computing)|windowing]] [[graphical user interface]] design, and for coining the phrase, "The best way to predict the future is to invent it."

He is the president of the [[Viewpoints Research Institute]], and an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. He is also on the advisory board of [[TTI/Vanguard]]. Until mid-2005, he was a Senior Fellow at [[HP Labs]], a Visiting Professor at [[Kyoto University]], and an Adjunct Professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://svextra.com/blogs/gmsv/2005/07/hp_converting_s.html |title=HP converting storied garage into recycling center |author=Paczkowski, John |date=21 July 2005 |work=Good Morning Silicon Valley |publisher=Media News Group}}</ref> After 10 years at Xerox PARC, Kay became [[Atari]]'s chief scientist for three years.

Kay is also a former professional [[jazz guitarist]], composer, and theatrical designer, and an amateur classical [[pipe organ]]ist.

== Early life and work ==
Alan Kay showed remarkable ability at an early age, learning to read fluently at three years old. In an interview on education in America with the Davis Group Ltd. Alan Kay said, "I had the fortune or misfortune to learn how to read fluently starting at the age of three. So I had read maybe 150 books by the time I hit 1st grade. And I already knew that the teachers were lying to me."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vimeo.com/20673320 |title=Interview with Alan Kay on education |work=The Generational Divide |publisher=The Davis Group |accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref>

Originally from [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], Kay attended the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], earning a [[Bachelor's degree]] in Mathematics and Molecular Biology. Before and during this time, he worked as a professional [[jazz]] guitarist.

In 1966, he began graduate school at the [[University of Utah]] [[University of Utah College of Engineering|College of Engineering]], earning a Master's degree and a Ph.D. degree. There, he worked with [[Ivan Sutherland]], who had done pioneering graphics programs including [[Sketchpad]]. This greatly inspired Kay's evolving views on objects and programming. As he grew busier with [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|ARPA]] research, he quit his career as a professional musician.

In 1968, he met [[Seymour Papert]] and learned of the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] [[computer programming|programming]] [[programming language|language]], a [[Programming language dialect|dialect]] of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] optimized for [[education]]al use. This led him to learn of the work of [[Jean Piaget]], [[Jerome Bruner]], [[Lev Vygotsky]], and of [[Constructionism (learning theory)|constructionist learning]]. These further influenced his views.

<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Alan-Kay.jpg|thumb|left|Alan Kay in the 1990s.]] -->
In 1970, Kay joined [[Xerox]] Corporation's [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] Research Center, [[PARC (company)|PARC]]. In the 1970s he was one of the key members there to develop prototypes of networked workstations using the programming language [[Smalltalk]]. These inventions were later commercialized by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] in their [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] and [[Macintosh]] computers.

Kay is one of the fathers of the idea of [[object-oriented programming]], which he named, along with some colleagues at PARC and predecessors at the [[Norwegian Computing Center]]. He conceived the [[Dynabook]] concept which defined the conceptual basics for [[laptop]] and [[tablet computer|tablet]] computers and [[E-book]]s, and is the architect of the modern overlapping windowing [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Bergin, Jr. |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Gibson, Jr. |first2=Richard G. |place=New York, NY |year=1996 |publisher=ACM Press, Addison-Wesley |title=History of Programming Languages II |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=234286}}</ref>  Because the Dynabook was conceived as an educational platform, Kay is considered to be one of the first researchers into [[mobile learning]], and indeed, many features of the Dynabook concept have been adopted in the design of the [[One Laptop Per Child]] educational platform, with which Kay is actively involved.

The field of computing is awaiting new revolution to happen, according to Kay, in which educational communities, parents, and children will not see in it a set of tools invented by [[Douglas Engelbart]], but a medium in [[Marshall McLuhan]] sense. He wrote that the destiny of personal computing is not going to be:
<blockquote>(...)a 'vehicle', as in [[Douglas Engelbart|Engelbart]]'s metaphor opposed to the IBM 'railroads', but something much more profound: a (...) medium. With a 'vehicle' one could wait until high school and give 'drivers ed', but if it was a medium, it had to extend into the world of childhood.<ref>[http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/EarlyHistoryST.html The Early History of Smalltalk]</ref></blockquote>

== Recent work and recognition ==
Starting in 1984, Kay was an Apple Fellow at [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] until the closing of the ATG ([[Advanced Technology Group]]), one of the company's R&D divisions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.i-programmer.info/history/8-people/438-alan-kay.html?start=1 |title=Alan Kay |date=13 November 2009 |work=I Programmer}}</ref> He then joined [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] as a [[Disney Fellow]] and remained there until Disney ended its Disney Fellow program. After Disney, in 2001 he founded [[Viewpoints Research Institute]], a non-profit organization dedicated to children, learning, and advanced software development.

Later, Kay worked with a team at [[Applied Minds]], then became a Senior Fellow at [[Hewlett-Packard]] until HP disbanded the Advanced Software Research Team on July 20, 2005. He is currently head of Viewpoints Institute.

Kay taught a Fall 2011 class, "Powerful Ideas: Useful Tools to Understand the World", at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) along with full-time ITP faculty member Nancy Hechinger. The goal of the class was to devise new forms of teaching/learning based on fundamental, powerful conceptsâ€”rather than on traditional rote learning.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kay| first=Alan| title=Powerful Ideas:Useful Tools to Understand the World |url=https://itp.nyu.edu/registration/CourseInfo.php?course_id=489 |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>

=== Squeak, Etoys, and Croquet ===
In December 1995, when he was still at Apple, Kay collaborated with many others to start the [[open source]] [[Squeak]] version of [[Smalltalk]], and he continues to work on it. As part of this effort, in November 1996, his team began research on what became the [[Etoys (programming language)|Etoys]] system. More recently he started, along with [[David A. Smith (computer scientist)|David A. Smith]], [[David P. Reed]], [[Andreas Raab]], Rick McGeer, [[Julian Lombardi]], and [[Mark McCahill]], the [[Croquet Project]], which is an open source networked 2D and 3D environment for collaborative work.

=== Tweak ===
In 2001, it became clear that the Etoy architecture in Squeak had reached its limits in what the Morphic interface infrastructure could do. [[Andreas Raab]] was a researcher working in Kay's group, then at Hewlett-Packard. He proposed defining a "script process" and providing a default scheduling mechanism that avoids several more general problems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tweakproject.org/ABOUT/FAQ/OriginalTweakMemo/ |title=Events, Scripts & Multiple Processes |author=[[Andreas Raab]] |date=6 July 2001 |accessdate=2009-06-07}}</ref> The result was a new user interface, proposed to replace the Squeak Morphic user interface in the future. [[Tweak programming environment|Tweak]] added mechanisms of islands, asynchronous messaging, players and costumes, language extensions, projects, and tile scripting.<ref>[http://tweakproject.org/TECHNOLOGY/Whitepapers/ Tweak: Whitepapers]</ref> Its underlying object system is [[Class (computer science)|class-based]], but to users (during programming) it acts like it is [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based]]. Tweak objects are created and run in Tweak project windows.

=== Children's Machine ===
In November 2005, at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]], the MIT research laboratories unveiled a new laptop computer, for educational use around the world. It has many names: the $100 Laptop, the [[One Laptop per Child]] program, the Children's Machine, and the [[XO-1 (laptop)|XO-1]]. The program was begun and is sustained by Kay's friend, [[Nicholas Negroponte]], and is based on Kay's [[Dynabook]] ideal. Kay is a prominent co-developer of the computer, focusing on its educational software using Squeak and Etoys.

=== Reinventing programming ===
Kay has lectured extensively on the idea that the computer revolution is very new, and all of the good ideas have not been universally implemented.  Lectures at OOPSLA 1997 conference and his ACM Turing award talk, entitled "The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet" were informed by his experiences with [[Sketchpad]], [[Simula]], [[Smalltalk]], and the bloated code of commercial software.
 
On August 31, 2006, Kay's proposal to the United States [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) was granted, thus funding [[Viewpoints Research Institute]] for several years. The proposal title was: Steps Toward the Reinvention of Programming: A compact and Practical Model of Personal Computing as a Self-exploratorium.<ref>[http://www.vpri.org/html/work/NSFproposal.pdf Proposal to NSF â€“ Granted on August 31st 2006 - Steps Toward The Reinvention of Programming - A Compact And Practical Model of Personal Computing As A Self-Exploratorium] - Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, Yoshiki Ohshima, Ian Piumarta, [[Andreas Raab]]</ref> A sense of what Kay is trying to do comes from this quote, from the abstract of a seminar on this given at Intel Research Labs, Berkeley: "The conglomeration of commercial and most open source software consumes in the neighborhood of several hundreds of millions of lines of code these days. We wonder: how small could be an understandable practical "Model T" design that covers this functionality? 1M lines of code? 200K LOC? 100K LOC? 20K LOC?"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kay| first=Alan| title=How Simply and Understandably Could The "Personal Computing Experience" Be Programmed? |url=http://www.intel-research.net/berkeley/viewseminarabstract.asp?index=605 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070625105727/http://www.intel-research.net/berkeley/viewseminarabstract.asp?index=605 |archivedate=2007-06-25 |date=2006-11-27 |accessdate=2009-06-07}}</ref>
