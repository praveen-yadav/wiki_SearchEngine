'''James Charles Evers''' (born  September 11, 1922), the older brother of slain civil rights activist [[Medgar Evers]], is a leading [[civil rights]] spokesman within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} in his native [[Mississippi]]. In 1969, he became the first African American since the [[Reconstruction era in the United States|Reconstruction era]] to have been elected as [[mayor]] in a Mississippi city, [[Fayette, Mississippi|Fayette]] in [[Jefferson County, Mississippi|Jefferson County]]. Thereafter, he ran for [[Governor of Mississippi|governor]] in 1971 and the [[List of United States Senators from Mississippi|United States Senate]] in 1978, both times as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] candidate.

Born in [[Decatur, Mississippi|Decatur]] in [[Newton County, Mississippi|Newton County]] in east central Mississippi, Evers was reared by devoutly [[Christian]] parents. 

During [[World War II]], Charles and Medgar Evers both served in the [[United States Army]]. Charles fell in love with a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] woman overseas. He could not marry her and go to his native Mississippi because of her "white" skin color. Mississippi had enshrined [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] rules in its constitution, which prohibited interracial marriages.

==Career==
In Mississippi about 1951, Charles and Medgar Evers grew interested in African freedom movements. They were interested in [[Jomo Kenyatta]] and the rise of the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] tribal resistance to colonialism in [[Kenya]], known as the "[[Mau-Mau]]" Rebellion as it moved to open violence.  Along with his brother, Charles became active in the [[Regional Council of Negro Leadership]] (RCNL), a civil rights organization that also promoted self-help and business ownership. He drew inspiration from Dr. [[T. R. M. Howard]], the president of the RCNL, who was one of the wealthiest blacks in the state.  Between 1952 and 1955, Evers often spoke at the RCNL's annual conferences in [[Mound Bayou, Mississippi|Mound Bayou]] on such issues as voting rights.

Around 1956, Evers's entrepreneurial gifts and his civil rights activism landed him in trouble in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi|Philadelphia]], Mississippi. He left town and moved to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]].  There, he vowed to support the movement back home, and fell into a life of hustling, running numbers for [[organized crime]], and managing [[prostitute]]s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Evers Isn't Proud of Past History|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rpUyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HucFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5995,5745001&dq=evers+prostitutes&hl=en|accessdate=25 November 2012|newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World|date=14 Apr 1971}}</ref>  

In 1963, [[Byron De La Beckwith]] shot Medgar Evers as he arrived home from work. Evers died in an ambulance on the way to the hospital.  Charles Evers was shocked and deeply upset by news of his brother's death.  Over the opposition of more establishment figures in the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) like [[Roy Wilkins]], Charles took over Medgar's post as head of the [[NAACP]] in Mississippi. 

In 1969, Charles Evers was elected [[mayor]] of [[Fayette, Mississippi]], the first [[African-American]] mayor in his state since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].  By then, Fayette had a majority of black residents, but African Americans had been effectively disfranchised in Mississippi from 1890 until passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].  Fayette had no industry, which meant it had almost no residents who had grown up outside the area. Its white community was known to be hostile towards blacks.  

Evers' election as mayor had enormous symbolic significance statewide and national resonance. The NAACP named Evers the 1969 Man of the Year. [[John Updike]] mentioned Evers in his popular novel ''[[Rabbit Redux]]''. Evers popularized the slogan, "Hands that picked cotton can now pick the mayor."

Evers served many terms as mayor of Fayette.  Admired by some, he alienated others with his inflexible stands on various issues. Evers did not like to share or delegate power.  The political rival who finally defeated Evers in a mayoral election, Kenneth Middleton, used the slogan: "We've seen what Fayette can do for one man.  Now let's see what one man can do for Fayette."

In 1971 Evers ran but was defeated in the gubernatorial [[general election]] by Democrat [[Bill Waller|William "Bill" Waller]], 601,222 (77 percent) to 172,762 (22.1 percent); Waller had been the original prosecutor of Byron De La Beckwith. In 1978, Evers ran for the Senate seat vacated by [[James O. Eastland]].  He finished in third place behind his opponents, Democrat [[Maurice Dantin]] and Republican [[Thad Cochran]], but he received 24 percent of the voteâ€”more than likely siphoning off African-American votes that would have otherwise gone to Dantin.  Cochran won the election with only 45 percent of the vote and still holds the seat today.

Evers attracted controversy for his support of judicial nominee [[Charles W. Pickering]], a fellow Republican, who was nominated by President Bush for a seat on the US Court of Appeals.  Evers criticized the NAACP and other organizations for opposing Pickering despite what he claimed was a record of supporting the civil rights movement in Mississippi.

Evers has befriended a range of people from [[sharecropper]]s to presidents. He was an informal advisor to politicians as diverse as [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[George Wallace|George C. Wallace]], [[Ronald W. Reagan]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. On the other hand, Evers has severely criticized black leaders who, he believes, are charlatans or have not "paid the price".  Charles Evers has been highly critical of such black community leaders as [[Roy Wilkins]], [[Stokely Carmichael]], [[H. Rap Brown]] and [[Louis Farrakhan]].

Evers' autobiography is titled ''Have No Fear''. He also self-published an autobiography with Grace Halsell in 1971 titled "Evers" published by World Publishing.
