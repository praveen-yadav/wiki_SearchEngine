'''Brewing''' is the production of [[beer]] through [[steeping]] a [[starch]] source (commonly [[cereal grains]]) in water and then [[#Fermenting|fermenting]] with yeast.  It is done in a [[brewery]] by a brewer, and the [[brewing industry]] is part of most western economies. Brewing has taken place since around the 6th millennium BC, and archaeological evidence suggests that this technique was used in most emerging civilizations including [[ancient Egypt]]<ref name=Arnold/> and [[Mesopotamia]].<ref>Hartman, L. F. and Oppenheim, A.

The basic ingredients of beer are water; a starch source, such as [[malted barley]], which is able to be fermented (converted into alcohol); a [[brewer's yeast]] to induce fermentation; and a flavouring, such as [[hops]].<ref name="alabev.com"/> A secondary starch source (an [[adjunct (beer)|adjunct]]) may be used, such as maize (corn), rice or sugar.<ref name="beer-brewing.com"/> Less widely used starch sources include [[millet]], [[sorghum]] and [[cassava]] root in Africa, potato in Brazil, and [[agave]] in Mexico, among others.<ref name="BeerHunter.com"/>  The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the [[grain bill]].

There are several steps in the brewing process, which include [[malting]], [[Mill (grinding)|milling]], [[#Mashing|mashing]], [[#Lautering|lautering]], [[#Boiling|boiling]], [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]], [[#Conditioning|conditioning]], [[#Filtering|filtering]], and [[#Packaging|packaging]]. There are three main fermentation methods, [[#Warm fermenting|warm]], [[#Cool fermenting|cool]] and [[#Spontaneous fermentation|wild or spontaneous]]. Fermentation may take place in open or closed vessels. There may be a secondary fermentation that can take place in the brewery, in the [[cask ale|cask]], or in the [[#Bottle conditioning|bottle]].

Brewing specifically includes the process of steeping, such as in making tea, [[sake]], and [[soy sauce]]. Technically, wine, [[cider]] and [[mead]] are not brewed but rather [[vinified]], as there is no steeping process involving solids.

Research indicates that brewing has taken place since around the 6th millennium BC, and archaeological evidence suggests that this technique was used in most emerging civilizations including [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. Descriptions of various beer recipes can be found in [[cuneiform]] (the oldest known writing) from ancient [[Mesopotamia]].<ref name=Arnold>{{Cite book|author=John P.

;Water
Beer is composed mostly of water. Regions have water with different mineral components; as a result, different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer, thus giving them a regional character.<ref name="geot"/> For example, [[Dublin]] has [[hard water]] well suited to making [[stout]], such as [[Guinness]]; while [[Plzeň|Pilsen]] has soft water well suited to making [[pale lager]], such as [[Pilsner Urquell]].<ref name="geot">{{Cite news|url=http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/aug04/resources.html|title=Geology and Beer|work=Geotimes|date=2004-08|accessdate=5 November 2007}}</ref> The waters of [[Burton upon Trent brewing|Burton]] in England contain [[gypsum]], which benefits making [[pale ale]] to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as [[Burtonisation]].<ref>[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000098.html] Michael Jackson, BeerHunter, 19 October 1991, ''Brewing a good glass of water''.

;Starch source
{{Main|Malt|Mash ingredients}}
The starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin [[germination]], and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that will allow conversion from starches in the grain into fermentable sugars during the mash process.<ref>[[s:en:1911 EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica/Brewing/Chemistry|Wikisource]] 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Brewing/Chemistry. Retrieved 29 September 2008</ref> Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.<ref>[http://www.farm-direct.co.uk/farming/stockcrop/barley/malt.html Farm-direct] Oz, ''Barley Malt'', 6 February 2002. Retrieved 29 September 2008</ref>

Nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch. This is because of its fibrous husk, which is important not only in the sparging stage of brewing (in which water is washed over the [[Mashing|mashed]] barley grains to form the [[Wort (brewing)|wort]]) but also as a rich source of [[amylase]], a [[digestion|digestive]] [[enzyme]] that facilitates conversion of starch into sugars. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and [[rye]], and, less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. In recent years, a few brewers have produced [[gluten-free beer]] made with sorghum with no barley malt for people that cannot digest [[gluten]]-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.<ref>{{cite web| author=Carolyn Smagalski| year = 2006

Hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer: they contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt; they provide floral, citrus, and herbal aromas and flavours; they have an [[antibiotic]] effect that favours the activity of [[brewer's yeast]] over less desirable microorganisms; and they aid in "head retention", the length of time that a foamy [[Head (beer)|head]] will last.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8h4Ze5s6sFUC&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Laboratory Manual of Food Microbiology |page=177 |author=Neelima Garg, K.

;Yeast
{{Main|Brewer's yeast|Saccharomyces cerevisiae|Saccharomyces uvarum}}
Yeast is the [[microorganism]] that is responsible for fermentation in beer. Yeast [[metabolism|metabolises]] the sugars extracted from grains, which produces [[Ethanol|alcohol]] and [[carbon dioxide]], and thereby turns [[wort]] into beer. In addition to fermenting the beer, yeast influences the character and flavour.<ref>Ostergaard, S., Olsson, L., Nielsen, J., [http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/64/1/34 Metabolic Engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae], Microbiol.

;Clarifying agent
{{Main|Finings}}
Some brewers add one or more [[clarifying agent]]s to beer, which typically [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] (collect as a solid) out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product. This process makes the beer appear [[Bright beer|bright]] and clean, rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as [[wheat beer]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000717.html |title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter&nbsp;– A pint of cloudy, please |publisher=Beerhunter.com |accessdate=28 September 2008}}</ref>

==Brewing process==
{{Brewing}}

There are several steps in the brewing process, which may include malting, mashing, lautering, [[#Boiling|boiling]], [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]], [[#Conditioning|conditioning]], [[#Filtering|filtering]], and [[#Packaging|packaging]].<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8TjCNuwCjUC&pg=PT383#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Handbook of Food Science, Technology, And Engineering |page=383 |author=Yiu H.

[[Malting]] is the process where barley grain is made ready for brewing.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ga4MYyZq-RMC&pg=PA563#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Oxford Companion to Beer |page=563 |author=John Hall, Wolfgang David Lindell |publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 7 October 2011|accessdate=18 April 2012 |isbn= 9780195367133}}</ref> Malting is broken down into three steps in order to help to release the starches in the barley.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=u3qc7aqWt9oC&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Science of Drinking: How Alcohol Affects Your Body and Mind |page=6 |author=Amitava Dasgupta |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|date= 16 April 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2012 |isbn= 9781442204119}}</ref> First, during steeping, the grain is added to a vat with water and allowed to soak for approximately 40 hours.<ref name=malting>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ga4MYyZq-RMC&pg=PA564#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Oxford Companion to Beer |page=564 |author=John Hall, Wolfgang David Lindell |publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 7 October 2011|accessdate=18 April 2012 |isbn= 9780195367133}}</ref> During [[germination]], the grain is spread out on the floor of the germination room for around 5 days.<ref name=malting/> The final part of malting is kilning. Here, the  malt goes through a very high temperature drying in a kiln. The temperature change is gradual so as not to disturb or damage the [[enzyme]]s in the grain. When kilning is complete, the grains are now termed [[malt]], and they will be milled or crushed to break apart the kernels and expose the cotyledon, which contains the majority of the carbohydrates and sugars; this makes it easier to extract the sugars during mashing.<ref name=ref-4>{{cite web|url=http://www.merchantduvin.com/pages/2_ale_university/aleu_brew_process.html |title=Ale University – Brewing Process |publisher=Merchant du Vin, |year=2009 |accessdate=12 November 2009}}</ref>

[[Mashing]] converts the starches released during the malting stage into sugars that can be fermented. The milled grain is mixed with hot water in a large vessel known as a [[mash tun]]. In this vessel, the grain and water are mixed together to create a cereal mash. During the mash, naturally occurring enzymes present in the malt convert the starches (long chain carbohydrates) in the grain into smaller molecules or simple sugars (mono-, di-, and tri-saccharides).  This "conversion" is called [[saccharification]]. The result of the mashing process is a sugar rich liquid or [[Wort (brewing)|"wort"]], which is then strained through the bottom of the mash tun in a process known as [[lautering]]. Prior to lautering, the mash temperature may be raised to about 75 °C - 78 °C (167–172 °F) (known as a mashout) to deactivate enzymes. Additional water may be sprinkled on the grains to extract additional sugars (a process known as [[Sparging (beer)|sparging]]).<ref name=ref-21>{{Cite book|author=Ted Goldammer |title=The Brewer's Handbook: The Complete Book To Brewing Beer |publisher=Apex |edition=2nd |isbn=0-9675212-3-8 |date=1 October 2008 |accessdate=15 November 2009}}</ref>

The wort is moved into a large tank known as a "copper" or [[kettle]] where it is boiled with [[hops]] and sometimes other ingredients such as herbs or sugars. This stage is where many chemical and technical reactions take place, and where important decisions about the flavour, colour, and aroma of the beer are made.<ref name=ref-1/> The boiling process serves to terminate enzymatic processes, [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] proteins, [[isomerization|isomerize]] hop [[resin]]s, and concentrate and [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] the wort. Hops add flavour, [[odor|aroma]] and [[Bitter (taste)|bitterness]] to the beer. At the end of the boil, the hopped wort settles to clarify in a vessel called a "whirlpool", where the more solid particles in the wort are separated out.<ref name=ref-2>{{Cite book|author=I.

After the whirlpool, the wort then begins the process of cooling. This is when the wort is transferred rapidly from the whirlpool or brew kettle to a [[heat exchanger]] to be cooled. The heat exchanger consists of tubing inside a tub of cold water. It is very important to quickly cool the wort to a level where yeast can be added safely as yeast is unable to grow in high temperatures.<ref name=ref-4/><ref name=ref-1>{{cite web|url= http://www.fosters.com.au/enjoy/beer/history_of_beer.htm |title= History of Beer |publisher=Foster's Group Home |accessdate=22 November 2009}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> After the wort goes through the heat exchanger, the cooled wort goes into a fermentation tank.

==Mashing==
{{Main|Mashing}}
[[File:Mashtun-full.jpg|left|thumb|A mash tun full of grain steeping in heated "liquor" (water)]]

Mashing is the process of combining a mix of milled grain (typically [[malt]]ed [[barley]] with [[Adjuncts|supplementary grains]] such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sorghum]], [[rye]] or wheat), known as the "[[grain bill]]", and water, known as "liquor", and heating this mixture in a vessel called a "mash tun". Mashing is a form of steeping,<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yjLqQPU_DzYC&pg=PT197#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Illustrated Guide to Brewing Beer|author= Matthew Schaefer |page=197|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|date= 15 Feb 2012 |accessdate=13 November 2012 |isbn= 9781616084639}}</ref> and defines the act of brewing, such as with making tea, [[sake]], and [[soy sauce]].<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mb0SZIYCXREC&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Alcohol in Popular Culture: An Encyclopedia |author= Rachel Black |page=41|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date= 14 Oct 2010 |accessdate=13 November 2012 |isbn= 9780313380488}}</ref> Technically, wine, [[cider]] and [[mead]] are not brewed but rather [[vinified]], as there is no steeping process involving solids.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TlYFAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-PA120#v=onepage&q&f=false |journal=The Saturday Magazine|page=120|author=The Saturday Magazine|title=The Useful Arts No. X | date=September 1835|accessdate=13 November 2012}}</ref> Mashing allows the [[enzyme]]s in the malt to break down the [[starch]] in the grain into sugars, typically [[maltose]] to create a malty liquid called [[wort]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Foods and Nutrition Encyclopedia  |author=Audrey Ensminger|page= 188|publisher= [[CRC Press]]|year= 1994| isbn=0-8493-8980-1}}</ref> There are two main methods – [[infusion]] mashing, in which the grains are heated in one vessel; and [[decoction]] mashing, in which a proportion of the grains are boiled and then returned to the mash, raising the temperature.<ref>{{cite book|author= Dan Rabin|title=The Dictionary of Beer and Brewing|publisher= [[Taylor & Francis]]|page=180|year= 1998| isbn= 1-57958-078-5}}</ref> Mashing involves pauses at certain temperatures (notably 45 °C, 62 °C and 73 °C), and takes place in a "mash tun" – an insulated brewing vessel with a [[false bottom]].<ref name=autogenerated1>"Abdijbieren.

Mashing usually takes 1 to 2 hours, and during this time the various temperature rests activate different enzymes depending upon the type of malt being used, its modification level, and the intention of the brewer. The activity of these enzymes convert the starches of the grains to [[dextrin]]s and then to fermentable sugars such as [[maltose]]. A mash rest from {{convert|49|-|55|C|F}} activates various [[protease]]s, which break down proteins that might otherwise cause the beer to be hazy. This rest is generally used only with undermodified (i.e. undermalted) malts which are decreasingly popular in Germany and the Czech Republic, or non-malted grains such as [[maize|corn]] and rice, which are widely used in North American beers. A mash rest at {{convert|60|°C|°F|abbr=on}} activates β-[[glucanase]], which breaks down gummy β-glucans in the mash, making the sugars flow out more freely later in the process. In the modern mashing process, commercial fungal based β-glucanase may be added as a supplement. Finally, a mash rest temperature of {{convert|65|-|71|C|F}} is used to convert the starches in the malt to sugar, which is then usable by the yeast later in the brewing process. Doing the latter rest at the lower end of the range favours [[β-amylase]] enzymes, producing more low-order sugars like [[maltotriose]], [[maltose]], and [[glucose]] which are more fermentable by the [[yeast]]. This in turn creates a beer lower in body and higher in [[ethanol|alcohol]]. A rest closer to the higher end of the range favours [[α-amylase]] enzymes, creating more higher-order sugars and [[dextrin]]s which are less fermentable by the yeast, so a fuller-bodied beer with less alcohol is the result. Duration and [[pH]] variances also affect the sugar composition of the resulting wort.<ref>Kunze, Wolfgang (2004) "Technology Brewing and Malting" [[VLB Berlin]], ISBN 3-921690-49-8 pp. 214–218</ref>

===Lautering===
{{Main|Lautering}}
Lautering is the separation of the [[Wort (brewing)|wort]] (the liquid containing the sugar extracted during mashing) from the grains.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hui|Smith|2004}}</ref> This is done either in a mash tun outfitted with a false bottom, in a lauter tun, or in a mash filter. Most separation processes have two stages: first wort run-off, during which the extract is separated in an undiluted state from the spent grains, and [[Sparging (beer)|sparging]], in which extract which remains with the grains is rinsed off with hot water. The lauter tun is a tank with holes in the bottom small enough to hold back the large bits of grist and hulls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beer-brewing.com/beer-brewing/wort_separation/lauter_tun.htm |title=Lauter Tun Use in Brewing Beer |publisher=beer-brewing.com |accessdate=31 March 2010 }}</ref> The bed of grist that settles on it is the actual filter. Some lauter tuns have provision for rotating [[mash rake|rakes]] or knives to cut into the bed of grist to maintain good flow. The knives can be turned so they push the grain, a feature used to drive the spent grain out of the vessel.<ref>Goldhammer, T. (2008) The Brewer's Handbook, 2nd edition, Apex, ISBN 978-0-9675212-3-7 pp 181 ff.</ref> The mash filter is a plate-and-frame filter. The empty frames contain the mash, including the spent grains, and have a capacity of around one hectoliter. The plates contain a support structure for the filter cloth. The plates, frames, and filter cloths are arranged in a carrier frame like so: frame, cloth, plate, cloth, with plates at each end of the structure. Newer mash filters have bladders that can press the liquid out of the grains between spargings. The grain does not act like a filtration medium in a mash filter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beer-brewing.com/beer-brewing/wort_separation/mash_filters.htm |title=Mash Filter Use in Brewing Beer |publisher=beer-brewing.com |accessdate=31 March 2010 }}</ref>

==Boiling==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2012}}

After mashing, the beer [[wort]] is boiled with [[hops]] (and other flavourings if used) in a large tank known as a "copper" or brew kettle - though historically the mash vessel was used and is still in some small breweries.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7eYLjJp0y7UC&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Beer in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance|page=5|author= Richard W.

Lewis, Charles W. Bamforth |publisher=Springer|date= 4 Oct 2006 |accessdate=15 November 2012 |isbn= 9780387330105}}</ref>

At the end of the boil, the hopped wort settles to clarify in a vessel called a "whirlpool", where the more solid particles in the wort are separated out.<ref name=ref-2/>

===Brew kettles or coppers===
[[File:Coors Brew Kettles.jpg|thumb|Brew kettles at [[Coors Brewing Company]]]]

Copper is the traditional material for the boiling vessel, because copper transfers heat quickly and evenly, and because the bubbles produced during boiling, and which would act as an insulator against the heat, do not cling to the surface of copper, so the wort is heated in a consistent manner.<ref name=Brew272>{{cite book|url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cr9Pv0gefCQC&pg=PA272&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Brewing |page=272|author=Michael Lewis, Tom W. Young|publisher=Springer|date= 2002}}</ref>

The simplest boil kettles are direct-fired, with a burner underneath. These can produce a vigorous and favourable boil, but are also apt to scorch the wort where the flame touches the kettle, causing caramelisation and making clean up difficult. Most breweries use a steam-fired kettle, which uses steam jackets in the kettle to boil the wort.<ref name=Bamforth/> The steam is delivered under pressure by an external boiler. State-of-the-art breweries today use many interesting boiling methods, all of which achieve a more intense boiling and a more complete realisation of the goals of boiling.

Breweries usually have a boiling unit either inside or outside of the kettle, usually a tall, thin cylinder with vertical tubes, called a calandria, through which wort is pumped.<ref name=Cal>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gYVLHMmplRcC&pg=PA201#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Oxford Companion to Beer|page=201|author=Tim Hampson|publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 9 Sep 2011}}</ref>

===Whirlpooling===
At the end of the boil, the wort is set into a whirlpool. The so-called [[tea leaf paradox]] forces the denser solids (coagulated proteins, vegetable matter from hops) into a cone in the center of the whirlpool tank.

In most large breweries, there is a separate tank for whirl pooling. These tanks have a large diameter to encourage settling, and is flat bottomed or with a slope of 1 or 2° towards the outlet, a tangential inlet near the bottom of the whirlpool, and an outlet on the bottom near the outer edge of the whirlpool. A whirlpool should have no internal protrusions that might slow down the rotation of the liquid. The bottom of the whirlpool is often slightly sloped towards the outlet. Newer whirlpools often have "[[Denk ring]]s" suspended in the middle of the whirlpool. These rings are aligned horizontally and have about 75% of the diameter of the whirlpool. The Denk rings prevent the formation of secondary eddies in the whirlpool, encouraging the formation of a cohesive trub cone in the middle of the whirlpool. Smaller breweries often use the brew kettle as a whirlpool. The trub being the solids that the brewer wants to remove from the wort.

===Hopback===
A hopback is a sealed chamber that is inserted in between the brewing kettle and counter-flow [[wort (brewing)|wort]] chiller.  [[Hops]] are added to the chamber, the hot wort from the kettle is run through it, and then immediately cooled in the wort chiller before entering the fermentation chamber.  It facilitates maximum retention of volatile hop aroma compounds that would normally be driven off when the hops contact the hot wort.  Because it is a sealed chamber, the volatile hop compounds are trapped in the hot wort, and then the wort is immediately cooled, which keeps the volatile compounds in solution.

In the United Kingdom, it is common practice to use a hopback to clear the green wort (green wort is wort to which yeast has not yet been added). This device has the same effect as, but operates in a completely different manner than, a whirlpool. The two devices are often confused but are in function, quite different. While a whirlpool functions through the use of centrifugal forces, a hopback uses a layer of fresh hop flowers in a confined space to act as a filter bed to remove trub (pronounced tr-oo-b, tr-uh-b in the UK). Furthermore, while a whirlpool is useful only for the removal of pelleted hops (as flowers do not tend to separate as easily), in general hopbacks are used only for the removal of whole flower hops (as the particles left by pellets tend to make it through the hopback).<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ciA6-YMTI-UC&pg=PA516&lpg=PA516#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Malting and Brewing Science: Hopped Wort and Beer |pages=516–517 |author=J.S. Hough, D.E. Briggs, R. Stevens, Tom W. Young |work=books.google.co.uk |publisher=Springer|date= 31 August 1982 |accessdate=31 July 2012 |isbn= 9780834216846}}</ref>

===Wort cooling===
After the whirlpool, the wort must be brought down to fermentation temperatures (20–26°Celsius)<ref name="autogenerated1" /> before yeast is added. In modern breweries this is achieved through a plate [[heat exchanger]]. A plate heat exchanger has many ridged plates, which form two separate paths. The wort is pumped into the heat exchanger, and goes through every other gap between the plates. The cooling medium, usually water, goes through the other gaps. The ridges in the plates ensure turbulent flow. A good heat exchanger can drop 95 °C wort to 20 °C while warming the cooling medium from about 10 °C to 80 °C. The last few plates often use a cooling medium which can be cooled to below the [[freezing point]], which allows a finer control over the wort-out temperature, and also enables cooling to around 10 °C. After cooling, oxygen is often dissolved into the wort to revitalize the yeast and aid its reproduction.

While boiling, it is useful to recover some of the energy used to boil the wort. On its way out of the brewery, the steam created during the boil is passed over a coil through which unheated water flows. By adjusting the rate of flow, the output temperature of the water can be controlled. This is also often done using a plate heat exchanger. The water is then stored for later use in the next mash, in equipment cleaning, or wherever necessary.<ref name=Kunze>Kunze, Wolfgang (2004) "Technology Brewing and Malting" VLB Berlin, ISBN 3-921690-49-8, p.302</ref>

Another common method of energy recovery takes place during the wort cooling. When cold water is used to cool the wort in a heat exchanger, the water is significantly warmed. In an efficient brewery, cold water is passed through the heat exchanger at a rate set to maximize the water's temperature upon exiting. This now-hot water is then stored in a hot water tank.<ref name="Kunze"/>

==Fermenting {{anchor|Brewing#Fermenting}}==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
[[File:Samadams2.jpg|thumb|left|Modern fermentation tanks]]
[[Fermentation (food)|Fermentation]] in brewing is the conversion of [[carbohydrate]]s to alcohols and carbon dioxide or organic acids using [[yeast]]s, bacteria, or a combination thereof, under [[fermentation (biochemistry)|anaerobic]] conditions. A more restricted definition of fermentation is the chemical conversion of sugars into [[ethanol]].  The science of fermentation is known as [[wikt:zymurgy|zymurgy]].

After the wort is cooled and [[aerated]] – usually with [[Asepsis|sterile]] air – yeast is added to it, and it begins to ferment. It is during this stage that sugars won from the [[malt]] are metabolized into [[ethanol|alcohol]] and [[carbon dioxide]], and the product can be called beer for the first time. Fermentation happens in tanks which come in all sorts of forms, from enormous cylindro-conical vessels, through open stone vessels, to wooden vats.

Most breweries today use cylindro-conical vessels, or CCVs, which have a conical bottom and a cylindrical top. The cone's [[aperture]] is typically around 60°, an angle that will allow the yeast to flow towards the cone's apex, but is not so steep as to take up too much vertical space. CCVs can handle both fermenting and conditioning in the same tank. At the end of fermentation, the yeast and other solids which have fallen to the cone's apex can be simply flushed out of a port at the apex.

Open fermentation vessels are also used, often for show in brewpubs, and in Europe in wheat beer fermentation. These vessels have no tops, which makes harvesting top-fermenting yeasts very easy. The open tops of the vessels make the risk of infection greater, but with proper cleaning procedures and careful protocol about who enters fermentation chambers, the risk can be well controlled.

Fermentation tanks are typically made of stainless steel. If they are simple cylindrical tanks with beveled ends, they are arranged vertically, as opposed to conditioning tanks which are usually laid out horizontally. Only a very few breweries still use wooden vats for fermentation as wood is difficult to keep clean and infection-free and must be repitched more or less yearly.

===Fermentation methods===
{{See also|Beer style}}
[[File:2009-03-21 Beer brewing bubbles.jpg|thumb|Beer fermenting]]
There are three main fermentation methods, [[#Warm fermentation|warm]], [[#Cool fermentation|cool]] and [[#Spontaneous fermentation|wild or spontaneous]]. Fermentation may take place in open or closed vessels. There may be a secondary fermentation which can take place in the brewery, in the [[cask ale|cask]] or in the [[#Bottle conditioning|bottle]].

Brewing yeasts may be classed as "top-cropping" (or "top-fermenting") and "bottom-cropping" (or "bottom-fermenting").<ref>{{Harvnb|Priest|Stewart|2006|p=84}}</ref> This distinction was introduced by the [[Danes|Dane]] [[Emil Christian Hansen]]. Top-cropping yeasts are so called because they form a foam at the top of the [[wort]] during fermentation. They can produce higher [[ethanol|alcohol]] concentrations and in higher temperatures, typically {{convert|16|to|24|C|F}}, produce fruitier, sweeter beers. An example of a top-cropping yeast is ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L3SU4ahY-m4C&pg=PA166 |title=Brewing yeast and fermentation|author=Chris Boulton, David Quain|page=166 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons, 2001|accessdate=26 March 2011 |isbn=9780470999400 |date=2008-04-15 }}</ref> Bottom-cropping yeasts are typically used to produce cool fermented, [[lager]]-type beers, though they can also ferment at higher temperatures if kept under 34C.<ref name=Esslinger>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SrlVoXTm2rMC&pg=PA122 |title=Handbook of Brewing |author=Hans Michael Esslinger|page=123|publisher=Wiley-VCH, 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2011 |isbn=9783527623495 |date=2009-04-22 }}</ref> These yeasts ferment more sugars, creating a dryer beer, and grow well at low temperatures.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SHh-4M_QxEsC&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=World's Best Beers: One Thousand Craft Brews from Cask to Glass |page=17  |author=Ben McFarland|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|date= 6 October 2009  |accessdate=16 July 2012 |isbn= 9781402766947}}</ref> An example of bottom-cropping yeast is ''[[Saccharomyces pastorianus]]'', formerly known as ''Saccharomyces carlsbergensis''.

For both types, yeast is fully distributed through the beer while it is fermenting, and both equally [[yeast flocculation|flocculate]] (clump together and precipitate to the bottom of the vessel) when fermentation is finished. By no means do all top-cropping yeasts demonstrate this behaviour, but it features strongly in many English yeasts that may also exhibit chain forming (the failure of budded cells to break from the mother cell), which is in the technical sense different from true flocculation. The most common top-cropping brewer's yeast, ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', is the same species as the common baking yeast. However, baking and brewing yeasts typically belong to different strains, cultivated to favour different characteristics: Baking yeast strains are more aggressive, in order to carbonate [[dough]] in the shortest amount of time; brewing yeast strains act slower, but tend to produce fewer off-flavours and tolerate higher alcohol concentrations (with some strains, up to 22%).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

To ensure purity of strain, a "clean" sample of brewing yeast is sometimes stored, either dried or refrigerated in a laboratory.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=8rR-6Prg3TcC&pg=PA140&dq=storing+pure+yeast+strains+freezer&hl=en&ei=cE4LTa6BFsrChAeBxdXLCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Yeast physiology and biotechnology''], page 140, Graeme M.

Typically, it is grown up in about three or four stages using sterile brewing wort and [[oxygen]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

====Warm fermentation====
In general, yeasts such as ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' are fermented at warm temperatures between {{convert|15| and |20|C|F}}, occasionally as high as {{convert|24|°C|°F|abbr=on}},<ref name=FBP>{{Harvnb|Lea|Piggott|2003|pp=43–44}}</ref> while the yeast used by [[Dupont Brewery|Brasserie Dupont]] for [[saison]] ferments even higher at {{Convert|29|C|F|0}} to {{Convert|35|C|F|0}}.<ref>''Farmhouse Ales: Culture and Craftsmanship in the European Tradition'', pages 168–173, Phil Markowski, Brewers Publications (2004), ISBN 0-937381-84-5</ref> They generally form a foam on the surface of the fermenting beer, as during the fermentation process its [[hydrophobic]] surface causes the flocs to adhere to CO<sub>2</sub> and rise; because of this, they are often referred to as "top-cropping" or "top-fermenting"<ref>{{Harvnb|Lea|Piggott|2003|p=42}}</ref> – though this distinction is less clear in modern brewing with the use of cylindro-conical tanks.<ref name="Bamforth 2005 66">{{cite book|author=Charles W. Bamforth|title= Food, Fermentation and Micro-organisms| page= 66|publisher= [[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year= 2005| isbn= 0-632-05987-7}}</ref> Generally, warm-fermented beers are ready to drink within three weeks after the beginning of fermentation, although some brewers will condition them for several months.

====Cool fermentation====
{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
{{Main|Lager}}
Lager is beer that has been cool fermented at around {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, compared to typical warm fermentation temperatures of {{convert|18|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. It is then stored for 30 days or longer close to the [[freezing]] point, and during this storage [[sulphur]] components developed during fermentation dissipate.

Though it is the cool fermentation that defines lager, the main technical difference with lager yeast is its ability to process [[raffinose]] (a [[trisaccharide]] composed of the sugars [[galactose]], [[fructose]], and [[glucose]]), which means that all sugars are fermented, resulting in a well [[Attenuation (brewing)|attenuated]] beer; warm-fermenting yeast only [[:wikt:cleave#Etymology 1|cleave]]s and ferments the fructose portion of raffinose, leaving [[melibiose]], which it cannot further cleave into two [[monosaccharide]]s due to its lack of melibiase, so ale remains sweeter with a lower conversion of sugar into alcohol.<ref name=Esslinger/><ref name="Bamforth 2005 66"/> Raffinose is a minor dry component of Carlsberg barley, but once malted is practically nonexistent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stevens|Briggs|Boulton|Brookes|2004|p=123}} See Table 4.16</ref>

While the nature of yeast was not fully understood until [[Emil Hansen]] of the [[Carlsberg brewery]] in Denmark isolated a single yeast cell in the late 1800s, brewers in [[Bavaria]] had for centuries been selecting cold-fermenting lager yeasts by storing ("lagern") their beers in cold alpine caves. The process of natural selection meant that the wild yeasts that were most cold tolerant would be the ones that would remain actively fermenting in the beer that was stored in the caves. Some of these Bavarian yeasts were brought back to the Carlsberg brewery around the time that Hansen did his famous work.

Today, lagers represent the vast majority of beers produced.  Examples include [[Budweiser Budvar]], [[Birra Moretti]], [[Stella Artois]], [[Red Stripe]], and [[Singha]].  Some lager-style beers market themselves as [[Pilsner]], which originated in [[Plzeň|Pilsen]], Czech Republic ''(Plzeň in [[Czech language|Czech]])''.  However, Pilsners are brewed with 100% barley malt and aggressive hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

Lager yeast normally ferments at a temperature of approximately 5 °C (40 °Fahrenheit).  Lager yeast can be fermented at a higher temperature normally used for top-fermenting yeast, and this application is often used in a beer style known as ''California Common'' or colloquially as "[[steam beer]]". ''[[Saccharomyces pastorianus]]'' is used in the brewing of [[lager]].

====Spontaneous fermentation====
{{redirect|Wild yeast|the role of wild yeast in winemaking|Yeast in winemaking}}

[[Lambic]] beers are historically brewed in [[Brussels]] and the nearby [[Pajottenland]] region of Belgium.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oWQdjnVo2B0C&pg=PA536#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Oxford Companion to Beer |author=Bill Taylor|page=536|publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 9 Sep 2011|accessdate=14 June 2013 |isbn= 9780199912100}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sGz6wEwkBOwC&pg=PA56-IA7&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Brewmaster's Table |author=Garrett Oliver |page=62|publisher=HarperCollins|date= 19 Oct 2010 |accessdate=14 June 2013 |isbn= 9780062042835}}</ref> They are fermented in oak barrels after being inoculated with wild yeast and bacteria while cooling in a Koelschip. Wild yeast and bacteria ferment the [[wort]] in the oak barrels. The beers fermented from yeast and bacteria in the Brussels area are called [[Lambic]] beers. These bacteria add a sour flavour to the beer. Of the many styles of beer very few use bacteria, most are fermented with yeast alone and bacterial contamination is avoided.

However, with the advent of yeast banks and the [[National Collection of Yeast Cultures]], brewing these beers – albeit not through spontaneous fermentation – is possible anywhere. Specific bacteria cultures are also available to reproduce certain styles.

''[[Brettanomyces]]'' is a genus of yeast important in brewing [[lambic]], a beer produced not by the deliberate addition of brewer's yeasts, but by spontaneous fermentation with wild yeasts and bacteria.<ref name=Verachtert1995>{{Cite journal|author=Verachtert H, Iserentant D.|year=1995 |title=Properties of Belgian acid  beers and their microflora. 1. The production of gueuze and related refreshing acid beers |journal=Cerevesia |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=37–42}}</ref>

Taking inspiration from Belgium-style brews, American [[microbreweries]] produce beer with microorganisms other than Saccharomyces, usually Brettanomyces. These fall in the broad category of [[American wild ale]].

==Conditioning==
After an initial or primary fermentation, beer is conditioned, matured or aged,<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TIYbNdrIsPEC&pg=PA86#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Handbook of Brewing  |page=86 |author=F.

The beer is usually transferred into a second container, so that it is no longer exposed to the dead yeast and other debris (also known as "trub") that have settled to the bottom of the primary fermenter. This prevents the formation of unwanted flavours and harmful compounds such as [[acetylaldehyde]]s.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TIYbNdrIsPEC&pg=PA308#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Handbook of Brewing  |page=308 |author=F.

;Kräusening
Kräusening is a conditioning method in which fermenting [[wort]] is added to the finished beer.<ref name=krause>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ga4MYyZq-RMC&pg=PA521#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Oxford Companion to Beer |author=Keith Thomas|publisher=Oxford University Press |date= 7 October 2011 |accessdate=16 July 2012 |isbn= 9780195367133}}</ref> The active yeast will restart fermentation in the finished beer, and so introduce fresh carbon dioxide; the conditioning tank will be then sealed so that the carbon dioxide is dissolved into the beer producing a lively "condition" or level of carbonation.<ref name=krause/> The kräusening method may also be used to condition bottled beer.<ref name=krause/>

;Lagering
[[Lager]]s are stored at near freezing temperatures for 1–6 months while still on the yeast.<ref>Briggs, D.E.; Boulton, C.A.; Brookes, P. A.; and Stevens, R. ''Brewing'', 2004, CRC. ISBN 0-8493-2547-1 p. 5.</ref> The process of storing, or conditioning, or maturing, or aging a beer at a low temperate for a long period is called "lagering", and while it is associated with lagers, the process may also be done with ales, with the same results - that of cleaning up various chemicals, acids and compounds.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ga4MYyZq-RMC&pg=PA533#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Oxford Companion to Beer|chapter=Lagering|author=Horst Dornbusch |pages=533–534|publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 9 Sep 2011|accessdate=8 April 2013 |isbn= 9780195367133}}</ref>

;Secondary fermentation{{anchor|Brewing#Secondary fermentation}}
During secondary fermentation, most of the remaining yeast will settle to the bottom of the second fermenter, yielding a less hazy product.<ref>{{Harvnb|Priest|Stewart|2006|p=532}}</ref>

;Bottle fermentation{{anchor|Bottle conditioning}}
Some beers undergo a fermentation in the bottle, giving natural carbonation.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uWXcajHd3W0C&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Encyclopaedia of Brewing |page=79|author=Christopher M. Boulton|publisher=Wiley|date= 20 May 2013 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> This may be a second or third fermentation. They are bottled with a viable yeast population in suspension. If there is no residual fermentable sugar left, sugar and/or [[wort (brewing)|wort]] may be added in a process known as priming. The resulting fermentation generates [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] that is trapped in the bottle, remaining in solution and providing natural carbonation. Bottle-conditioned beers may be either filled unfiltered direct from the fermentation or conditioning tank, or filtered and then reseeded with yeast.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uWXcajHd3W0C&pg=PA80#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Encyclopaedia of Brewing |page=80|author=Christopher M.

;Cask conditioning
{{Main|Cask ale}}
Cask ale or cask-conditioned beer is the term for [[filtration|unfiltered]] and [[pasteurization|unpasteurised]] beer that is conditioned (including secondary fermentation) and served from a cask without additional nitrogen or [[carbon dioxide]] [[pressure]].<ref name=CAMRA>{{cite web |url= http://www.camra.org.uk/aboutale |title=About Real Ale  |work=camra.org.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=16 July 2012}}</ref>

==Filtering==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
[[File:DE and yeast crop.jpg|right|thumb|A mixture of [[diatomaceous earth]] and [[yeast]] after filtering.]]
{{Main|Filtered beer}}
Filtering the beer stabilizes the flavour, and gives beer its polished shine and brilliance. Not all beer is filtered. When tax determination is required by local laws, it is typically done at this stage in a calibrated tank.

Filters come in many types. Many use sheets or candles.  Others use a fine powder such as [[diatomaceous earth]], also called kieselguhr. The powder is added to the beer and recirculated past screens to form a filtration bed.

Filters range from rough filters that remove much of the yeast and any solids (e.g., hops, grain particles) left in the beer, to filters tight enough to strain colour and body from the beer. Filtration ratings are divided into rough, fine, and sterile. Rough filtration leaves some cloudiness in the beer, but it is noticeably clearer than unfiltered beer. Fine filtration removes almost all cloudiness. Sterile filtration removes almost all microorganisms.

;Sheet (pad) filters
These filters use sheets that allow only particles smaller than a given size to pass through. The sheets are placed into a filtering frame, sterilized (with boiling water, for example) and then used to filter the beer. The sheets can be flushed if the filter becomes blocked.  The sheets are usually disposable and are replaced between filtration sessions. Often the sheets contain powdered filtration media to aid in filtration.

Pre-made filters have two sides. One with loose holes, and the other with tight holes. Flow goes from the side with loose holes to the side with the tight holes, with the intent that large particles get stuck in the large holes while leaving enough room around the particles and filter medium for smaller particles to go through and get stuck in tighter holes.

Sheets are sold in nominal ratings, and typically 90% of particles larger than the nominal rating are caught by the sheet.
;Kieselguhr filters
	 	
Filters that use a powder medium are considerably more complicated to operate, but can filter much more beer before regeneration. Common media include [[diatomaceous earth]] and [[perlite]].

==Packaging==
{{See also|Beer bottle|Beverage can|Widget (beer)|Draught beer|Cask ale}}
Packaging is putting the beer into the containers in which it will leave the brewery. Typically, this means putting the beer into bottles, aluminium cans and [[keg]]s/casks, but it may include putting the beer into bulk tanks for high-volume customers.

==Brewing methods==
{{Main|Brewing methods}}
There are several additional brewing methods, such as barrel aging, double dropping, and Yorkshire Square.

==By-products==
Brewing by-products are "spent grain" and the sediment (or "[[Sediment#Dregs|dregs]]") from the filtration process which may be dried and resold as "brewers dried yeast" for poultry feed,<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9WZ9LJLoCZIC&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Nutrition and Feeding of Organic Poultry |author=Robert Blair |page=79|publisher=CABI|year= 2008  |accessdate=8 April 2013}}</ref> or made into yeast extract.
