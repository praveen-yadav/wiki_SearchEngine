'''''Alarums and Excursions''''' ('''''A&E''''') is an [[amateur press association]] started in June 1975 by [[Lee Gold]] (at the request of [[Bruce Pelz]], who felt that discussion of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' was taking up too much space in Apa-L, the APA of the [[Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society]]).<ref>[http://www.arielarchives.com/Brett/magazines/alarumsandexcursions.html Bretts RPG Magazine and Zine Index], entry on Alarums & Excursions, retrieved September 2007</ref> It was the first publication to focus solely on [[role-playing game]]s. 

Each issue is a collection of contributions from different authors, often featuring game design discussions, rules variants, write-ups of game sessions, reviews, and comments on others contributions. It was a four-time winner of the [[Charles Roberts Award|Charles Roberts]]/[[Origins Award]], winning "Best Amateur Adventure Gaming Magazine" in 1984,<ref>[http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1984 The Charles Roberts Awards 1984], retrieved September 2007</ref> "Best Amateur Game Magazine" in 1999,<ref>[http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1999 Origins Awards 1999], retrieved September 2007</ref> and "Best Amateur Game Periodical" in 2000<ref name = "hbdhyg">[http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2000 Origins Awards 2000], retrieved September 2007</ref> and 2001.<ref name = "hbdhyg"/>

Although game reports and social reactions are common parts of many ''A&E'' contributions, it has also, over the years, become a testing ground for new ideas on the development of the RPG as a genre and an art form. The idea that role-playing games ''are'' an art form took strong root in this zine, and left a lasting impression on many of the RPG professionals who contributed.

The January, 2009 collation of ''Alarums and Excursions'' was #400.
