'''Cognitive behavioral therapy''' ('''CBT''') is a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] approach that addresses dysfunctional emotions, maladaptive behaviors and cognitive processes and contents through a number of goal-oriented, explicit systematic procedures. The name refers to  [[behaviour therapy|behavior therapy]], [[cognitive therapy]], and to therapy based upon a combination of basic [[behaviorism|behavioral]] and [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] principles and research. Most therapists working with patients dealing with [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] use a blend of cognitive and behavioral therapy. This technique acknowledges that there may be behaviors that cannot be controlled through rational thought. CBT is "problem focused" (undertaken for specific problems) and "action oriented" (therapist tries to assist the client in selecting specific strategies to help address those problems).<ref>Schacter, D. L., Gilbert, D. T., & Wegner, D. M. (2010). Psychology. (2nd ed., p. 600). New York: Worth Pub.</ref>

CBT is thought to be effective for the treatment of a variety of conditions, including [[mood disorder|mood]], [[anxiety disorder|anxiety]], [[personality disorder|personality]], [[eating disorder|eating]], [[substance use disorder|substance abuse]], [[tic disorder|tic]], and [[psychosis|psychotic]] disorders. Many CBT treatment programs for specific disorders have been evaluated for [[efficacy]]; the health-care trend of [[evidence-based treatment]], where specific treatments for symptom-based diagnoses are recommended, has favored CBT over other approaches such as [[psychodynamic]] treatments.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Lambert MJ, Bergin AE, Garfield SL  |editor= Lambert MJ |title= Bergin and Garfield's Handbook of Psychotherapy and Behavior Change |edition=5th |year=2004 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=New York  |isbn=0-471-37755-4|pages=3–15 |chapter=Introduction and Historical Overview}}</ref>

CBT was primarily developed through an integration of [[behavior therapy]] (the term "behavior modification" appears to have been first used by [[Edward Thorndike]]) with [[cognitive psychology]] research, first by Donald Meichenbaum and several other authors with the label of [[cognitive behavior modification]] in the late 1970s. This tradition thereafter merged with earlier work of a few clinicians, labeled as [[Cognitive Therapy]] (CT), developed by [[Aaron Beck]], and [[Rational Emotive Therapy]] (RET) developed by [[Albert Ellis]].  While rooted in rather different theories, these two traditions have been characterised by a constant reference to experimental research to test  hypotheses, both at clinical and basic level. Common features of CBT procedures are the focus on the "here and now", a directive or guidance role of the therapist, a structuring of the psychotherapy sessions and path, and on alleviating both symptoms and patients' vulnerability.<ref name="Rachman_1997" />

==Description==
Mainstream cognitive [[behavioral therapy]] assumes that changing [[maladaptive]] thinking leads to change in [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[behavior]],<ref name=HassettAL/> but recent variants emphasize changes in one's relationship to maladaptive thinking rather than changes in thinking itself.<ref name=HayesSC>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104449 |title=Open, Aware, and Active: Contextual Approaches as an Emerging Trend in the Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies |year=2011 |last1=Hayes |first1=Steven C. |last2=Villatte |first2=Matthieu |last3=Levin |first3=Michael |last4=Hildebrandt |first4=Mikaela |journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology |volume=7 |pages=141–68 |pmid=21219193}}</ref> Therapists or computer-based programs use CBT techniques to help individuals challenge their patterns and beliefs and replace "errors in thinking such as overgeneralizing, magnifying negatives, minimizing positives and catastrophizing" with "more realistic and effective thoughts, thus decreasing emotional distress and self-defeating behavior" <ref name=HassettAL/> or to take a more open, mindful, and aware posture toward them so as to diminish their impact.<ref name=HayesSC/> Mainstream CBT helps individuals replace "maladaptive… coping skills, cognitions, emotions and behaviors with more adaptive ones",<ref name=GatchelRJ/> by challenging an individual's way of thinking and the way that he/she reacts to certain habits or behaviors,<ref>{{cite book |author= Kozier B |title= Fundamentals of nursing: concepts, process and practice |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=_0_pRyy9McQC |year= 2008 |publisher= Pearson Education |isbn=978-0-13-197653-5 |page= 187}}</ref> but there is still controversy about the degree to which these traditional cognitive elements account for the effects seen with CBT over and above the earlier behavioral elements such as exposure and skills training.<ref name=LongmoreRJ>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2006.08.001 |title=Do we need to challenge thoughts in cognitive behavior therapy? |year=2007 |last1=Longmore |first1=Richard J. |last2=Worrell |first2=Michael |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=173–87 |pmid=17157970}}</ref>  

Modern forms of CBT include a number of diverse but related techniques such as [[exposure therapy]], stress inoculation training, [[cognitive processing therapy]], [[cognitive therapy]], [[relaxation training]], [[dialectical behavior therapy]], and [[acceptance and commitment therapy]].<ref>E. B. Foa, ''Effective Treatments for PTSD: Practice Guidelines from the [[International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies]],'' Guilford, New York, NY, USA, 2nd edition, 2009.{{pn|date=April 2013}}</ref>

CBT has six phases:<ref name=GatchelRJ/>
#Assessment or [[psychological assessment]];
#Reconceptualization;
#Skills acquisition;
#Skills consolidation and application training;
#[[Generalization]] and maintenance;
#Post-treatment assessment follow-up.

The reconceptualization phase makes up much of the "cognitive" portion of CBT.<ref name=GatchelRJ/>  A summary of modern CBT approaches is given by Hofmann.<ref>{{cite book |author= Hofmann SG |title= An Introduction to Modern CBT.

There are different protocols for delivering cognitive behavioral therapy, with important similarities among them.<ref name=HofmannSG>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2010.04.006 |title=The Empirical Status of the "New Wave" of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy |year=2010 |last1=Hofmann |first1=Stefan G. |last2=Sawyer |first2=Alice T. |last3=Fang |first3=Angela |journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=701–10 |pmid=20599141 |pmc=2898899}}</ref> Use of the term ''CBT'' may refer to different interventions, including "self-instructions (e.g. distraction, imagery, motivational self-talk), relaxation and/or biofeedback, development of adaptive coping strategies (e.g. minimizing negative or self-defeating thoughts), changing maladaptive beliefs about pain, and goal setting".<ref name=GatchelRJ/> Treatment is sometimes manualized, with brief, direct, and time-limited treatments for individual psychological disorders that are specific technique-driven. CBT is used in both individual and group settings, and the techniques are often adapted for [[self-help]] applications. Some clinicians and researchers are cognitively oriented (e.g. [[cognitive restructuring]]), while others are more behaviorally oriented (e.g. ''in vivo'' [[exposure therapy]]). Interventions such as imaginal exposure therapy combine both approaches.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Foa |first1=Edna B. |last2=Rothbaum |first2=Barbara O. |last3=Furr |first3=Jami M. |title=Augmenting exposure therapy with other CBT procedures |journal=Psychiatric Annals |volume=33 |issue=1 |month=Jan |year=2003 |pages=47–53 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2003-04194-004}}</ref>

J. |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=621–32 |pmid=18363421 |pmc=2409267}}</ref>

A basic concept in some CBT treatments used in anxiety disorders is ''in vivo'' [[exposure therapy|exposure]], a term describing a technique where the patient is gradually exposed to the actual, feared [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. The treatment is based on the theory that the fear response has been [[classical conditioning|classically conditioned]], and that avoidance of it [[negative reinforcement|negatively reinforces]] and maintains the fear. This "two-factor" model is often credited to [[Orval Hobart Mowrer|O. Hobart Mowrer]].<ref>{{Cite book |publisher = Wiley |location=New York |author = Mowrer OH |title = Learning theory and behavior |year = 1960 |isbn = 0-88275-127-1}}{{Page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref> Through exposure to the stimulus, this harmful conditioning can be "unlearned" (referred to as [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] and [[habituation]]).

===Schizophrenia, psychosis and mood disorders===
Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown as an effective treatment for clinical depression.<ref name=DriessenE/> The [[American Psychiatric Association]] Practice Guidelines (April 2000) indicated that, among psychotherapeutic approaches, cognitive behavioral therapy and [[interpersonal psychotherapy]] had the best-documented efficacy for treatment of [[major depressive disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890423363.50051 |chapter=Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Bipolar Disorder Second Edition |title=APA Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders: Comprehensive Guidelines and Guideline Watches |year=2006 |isbn=0-89042-336-9 |volume=1}}{{pn|date=April 2013}}</ref> One [[etiology|etiological]] theory of depression is [[Aaron T. Beck]]'s cognitive theory of depression. His theory states that depressed people think the way they do because their thinking is biased towards negative interpretations. According to this theory, depressed people acquire a negative [[schema (psychology)|schema]] of the world in childhood and adolescence as an effect of stressful life events, and the negative schema is activated later in life when the person encounters similar situations.<ref name=Neale247>{{Cite book|author=Neale JM, Davison GC |title= Abnormal psychology |edition= 8th |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |location= New York |year=2001 |page= 247 |isbn=0-471-31811-6 }}</ref>

Beck also described a negative [[Beck's cognitive triad|cognitive triad]], made up of the negative schemata and cognitive biases of the person, theorizing that depressed individuals make negative evaluations of themselves, the world, and the future. Depressed people, according to this theory, have views such as, "I never do a good job", "It is impossible to have a good day", and "things will never get better." A negative schema helps give rise to the cognitive bias, and the cognitive bias helps fuel the negative schema. This is the negative triad. Beck further proposed that depressed people often have the following cognitive biases: [[arbitrary inference]], [[selective abstraction]], over-generalization, magnification, and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]]. These cognitive biases are quick to make negative, generalized, and personal inferences of the self, thus fueling the negative schema.<ref name=Neale247/>

In long-term [[psychosis|psychoses]], CBT is used to complement medication and is adapted to meet individual needs. Interventions particularly related to these conditions include exploring reality testing, changing delusions and hallucinations, examining factors which precipitate relapse, and managing relapses.<ref name=GutierrezM/><!-- cites previous two sentences --> Several meta-analyses have shown CBT to be effective in [[schizophrenia]],<ref name=RathodS/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm114 |title=Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Schizophrenia: Effect Sizes, Clinical Models, and Methodological Rigor |year=2007 |last1=Wykes |first1=T. |last2=Steel |first2=C. |last3=Everitt |first3=B. |last4=Tarrier |first4=N. |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=523–37 |pmid=17962231 |pmc=2632426}}</ref> and the [[American Psychiatric Association]] includes CBT in its schizophrenia guideline as an evidence-based treatment.

A 2010 meta-analysis found that no trial employing both [[Blind experiment|blinding]] and psychological [[Placebo-controlled study|placebo]] has shown CBT to be effective in either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and that the effect size of CBT was small in major depressive disorder. They also found a lack of evidence to conclude that CBT was effective in preventing relapses in bipolar disorder.<ref name=LynchD>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S003329170900590X |title=Cognitive behavioural therapy for major psychiatric disorder: Does it really work?

According to Cox, [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012), cognitive behavioral therapy can also be used to reduce prejudice towards others. This other-directed prejudice can cause depression in the "others," or in the self when a person becomes part of a group he or she previously had prejudice towards (i.e. deprejudice).<ref name="Cox et al. (2012)">{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1745691612455204 |title=Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective |year=2012 |last1=Cox |first1=W. T. L. |last2=Abramson |first2=L.

===Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with older adults===
CBT is used to help people of all ages, but the therapy should be adjusted based on the age of the patient with whom the therapist is dealing.  Older individuals in particular have certain characteristics that need to be acknowledged and the therapy altered to account for these differences thanks to age.<ref name=Bienenfeld>{{cite journal |last=Bienenfeld |first=David |year=2009 |title=Cognitive therapy with older adults |url=http://www.healio.com/psychiatry/journals/psycann/%7B32eb9933-7d29-4539-8e63-0da2e9a2d58e%7D/cognitive-therapy-with-older-adults |journal=Psychiatric Annals |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=828–32 |doi=10.3928/00485713-20090821-02}}</ref>  Some of the challenges to CBT because of age include the following:

;The Cohort Effect: The times that each generation lives through partially shape its thought processes as well as values, so a 70-year-old may react to the therapy very differently from a 30-year-old, because of the different culture in which they were brought up.  A tie-in to this effect is that each generation has to interact with one another, and the differing values clashing with one another may make the therapy more difficult.<ref name=Bienenfeld/>

;Established Role:  By the time one reaches old age, the person has a definitive idea of her or his role in life and is invested in that role.  This social role can dominate who the person thinks he or she is and may make it difficult to adapt to the changes required in CBT.<ref name=Bienenfeld/>

;Mentality toward Aging:  If the older individual sees aging itself as a negative this can exacerbate whatever malady the therapy is trying to help (depression and anxiety for example).<ref name=Bienenfeld/> Negative stereotypes and prejudice against the elderly cause depression as the stereotypes become self-relevant.<ref name="Cox et al. (2012)" />

;Processing Speed Decreases:  As we age, we take longer to learn new information, and as a result may take more time to learn and retain the cognitive therapy.  Therefore, therapists should slow down the pacing of the therapy and use any tools both written and verbal that will improve the retention of the cognitive behavioral therapy.<ref name=Bienenfeld/>

==Methods of access==

===Therapist===
A typical CBT programme would consist of face-to-face sessions between patient and therapist, made up of 6-18 sessions of around an hour each with a gap of a 1–3 weeks between sessions. This initial programme might be followed by some booster sessions, for instance after one month and three months.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cognitive behavioural therapy for the management of common mental health problems |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/media/878/F7/CBTCommissioningGuide.pdf |publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] |month=April |year=2008}}{{pn|date=April 2013}}</ref> CBT has also been found to be effective if patient and therapist type in real time to each other over computer links.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61257-5 |title=Therapist-delivered internet psychotherapy for depression in primary care: A randomised controlled trial |year=2009 |last1=Kessler |first1=David |last2=Lewis |first2=Glyn |last3=Kaur |first3=Surinder |last4=Wiles |first4=Nicola |last5=King |first5=Michael |last6=Weich |first6=Scott |last7=Sharp |first7=Debbie J |last8=Araya |first8=Ricardo |last9=Hollinghurst |first9=Sandra |journal=The Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9690 |pages=628–34 |pmid=19700005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.109.073080 |title=Cost-effectiveness of therapist-delivered online cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression: Randomised controlled trial |year=2010 |last1=Hollinghurst |first1=S. |last2=Peters |first2=T.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is most closely allied with the [[scientist–practitioner model]] in which clinical practice and research is informed by a scientific perspective, clear [[operationalization]] of the problem, and an emphasis on [[measurement]], including measuring changes in cognition and behavior and in the attainment of goals. These are often met through "homework" assignments in which the patient and the therapist work together to craft an assignment to complete before the next session.<ref name="Martin"/> The completion of these assignments&nbsp;– which can be as simple as a person suffering from depression attending some kind of social event&nbsp;– indicates a dedication to treatment compliance and a desire to change.<ref name="Martin"/> The therapists can then logically gauge the next step of treatment based on how thoroughly the patient completes the assignment.<ref name="Martin"/> Effective cognitive behavioral therapy is dependent on a [[Therapeutic relationship|therapeutic alliance]] between the healthcare practitioner and the person seeking assistance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Unlike many other forms of psychotherapy, the patient is very involved in CBT.<ref name="Martin"/> For example, an anxious patient may be asked to talk to a stranger as a homework assignment, but if that is too difficult, he or she can work out an easier assignment first.<ref name="Martin"/> The therapist needs to be flexible and willing to listen to the patient rather than acting as an authority figure.<ref name="Martin"/>

===Computerized CBT===
Computerized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CCBT) has been described by [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|NICE]] as a ''"generic term for delivering CBT via an interactive computer interface delivered by a personal computer, internet, or interactive voice response system"'',<ref name=NiceTA97>{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA97 |title=Depression and anxiety&nbsp;– computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref> instead of face-to-face with a human therapist. CCBT has potential to improve access to evidence-based therapies, and to overcome the prohibitive costs and lack of availability sometimes associated with retaining a human therapist.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Marks |first1=Isaac M. |last2=Mataix-Cols |first2=David |last3=Kenwright |first3=Mark |last4=Cameron |first4=Rachel |last5=Hirsch |first5=Steven |last6=Gega |first6=Lina |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |pmid=12835245 |doi=10.1192/bjp.02-463 |doi_brokendate=April 26, 2013 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12835245 |year=2003 |title=Pragmatic evaluation of computer-aided self-help for anxiety and depression |volume=183 |pages=57–65}}</ref>

CCBT completion rates and treatment efficacy have been found in some studies to be higher when use of CCBT is prescribed and supported, than when use is in a self-help form without medical professional involvement.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11920-010-0152-4 |title=Computer-Assisted Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy |year=2010 |last1=Spurgeon |first1=Joyce A. |last2=Wright |first2=Jesse H. |journal=Current Psychiatry Reports |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=547–52 |pmid=20872100}}</ref>

In February 2006 NICE recommended that CCBT be made available for use within the [[National Health Service|NHS]] across England and Wales for patients presenting with mild-to-moderate depression, rather than immediately opting for antidepressant medication,<ref name=NiceTA97/> and CCBT is made available by some health systems.<ref>http://www.devonpartnership.nhs.uk/uploads/tx_mocarticles/CCBT_Leaflet.pdf{{full|date=April 2013}}</ref> The 2009 NICE guideline recognized that there are likely to be a number of computerized CBT products that are useful to patients, but removed endorsement of any specific product.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG91/NICEGuidance/pdf/English |title=CG91 Depression with a chronic physical health problem |date=28 October 2009 |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence}}{{pn|date=April 2013}}</ref>

A relatively new avenue of research is the combination of artificial intelligence and CCBT. It has been proposed to use modern technology to create CCBT that simulates face-to-face therapy. This might be achieved in cognitive behaviour therapy for a specific disorders using the comprehensive domain knowledge of CBT.<ref name=helgadottir2009a>{{cite journal |doi=10.1375/bech.26.4.245 |title=Online CBT I: Bridging the Gap Between Eliza and Modern Online CBT Treatment Packages |year=2009 |last1=Helgadóttir |first1=Fjóla Dögg |last2=Menzies |first2=Ross G |last3=Onslow |first3=Mark |last4=Packman |first4=Ann |last5=O'Brian |first5=Sue |journal=Behaviour Change |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=245–53}}</ref> One area where this has been attempted, is the specific domain area of social anxiety in those who stutter.<ref name=helgadottir2009b>{{cite journal |doi=10.1375/bech.26.4.254 |title=Online CBT II: A Phase I Trial of a Standalone, Online CBT Treatment Program for Social Anxiety in Stuttering |year=2009 |last1=Helgadóttir |first1=Fjóla Dögg |last2=Menzies |first2=Ross G |last3=Onslow |first3=Mark |last4=Packman |first4=Ann |last5=O'Brian |first5=Sue |journal=Behaviour Change |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=254–70}}</ref>

==Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy==
Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (BCBT) is a form of [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]] (CBT) which has been developed for situations in which there are time constraints on the therapy sessions.<ref name=RuddDM>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/08995605.2012.736325 |title=Brief cognitive behavioral therapy (BCBT) for suicidality in military populations |year=2012 |last1=Rudd |first1=M.

Criticism of CBT sometimes focuses on implementations (such as the UK [[Improving Access to Psychological Therapies|IAPT]]) which may result initially in low quality therapy being offered by poorly trained practitioners.<ref>{{cite press release |title=UKCP response to Andy Burnham's speech on mental health |publisher=UK Council for Psychotherapy |date=1 February 2012 |url=http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/article1488.html |accessdate=April 26, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/anxiety-files/201111/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-proven-effectiveness |first=Robert L. |last=Leahy |date=November 23, 2011 |title=Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: Proven Effectiveness |work=Psychology Today}}</ref> However evidence supports the effectiveness of CBT for anxiety and depression.<ref name=pmid20948835/>

Mounting evidence suggests that the addition of hypnotherapy as an adjunct to CBT improves treatment efficacy for a variety of clinical issues.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.63.2.214 |title=Hypnosis as an adjunct to cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy: A meta-analysis |year=1995 |last1=Kirsch |first1=Irving |last2=Montgomery |first2=Guy |last3=Sapirstein |first3=Guy |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=214–20 |pmid=7751482}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00207140601177897 |title=Cognitive Hypnotherapy for Depression:An Empirical Investigation |year=2007 |last1=Alladin |first1=Assen |last2=Alibhai |first2=Alisha |journal=International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=147–66 |pmid=17365072}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00029157.2011.654284 |title=Cognitive Hypnotherapy for Pain Management |year=2012 |last1=Elkins |first1=Gary |last2=Johnson |first2=Aimee |last3=Fisher |first3=William |journal=American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=294–310 |pmid=22655332}}</ref>

==Criticisms==
A number of methodological issues have been raised with the clinical studies on the effectiveness of CBT. 

A major criticism has been that clinical studies of CBT efficacy (or any psychotherapy) are not double-blind (i.e., neither subjects nor therapists in psychotherapy studies are blind to the type of treatment). They may be single-blinded, the rater may not know the treatment the patient received, but neither the patients nor the therapists are blinded to the type of therapy given (two out of three of the persons involved in the trial, i.e., all of the persons involved in the treatment, are unblinded). The patient is an active participant in correcting negative distorted thoughts, thus quite aware of the treatment group they are in.<ref>Berger, D. Psychiatric Times, July 30, 2013. http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-escape-binds-tight-methodology/page/0/1?cid=fb#sthash.ti9rtA48.dpuf</ref>

The importance of double-blinding was shown in a meta-analysis that examined the effectiveness of CBT when placebo control and blindedness were factored in.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lynch D, Laws KR, McKenna PJ | year = 2010 | title = Cognitive behavioral therapy for major psychiatric disorder: does it really work? A meta-analytical review of well-controlled trials | url = | journal = Psychol Med | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 9–24 }}</ref>  Pooled data from published trials of CBT in schizophrenia, MDD, and bipolar disorder that used controls for non-specific effects of intervention were analyzed. This study concluded that CBT is no better than non-specific control interventions in the treatment of schizophrenia and does not reduce relapse rates, treatment effects are small in treatment studies of MDD, and it is not an effective treatment strategy for prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder. For MDD, the authors note that the pooled effect size was very low. Nevertheless, the methodological processes used to select the studies in the previously mentioned meta-analysis and the worth of its findings have been called into question.<ref>Lincoln, T. M. (2009). "Letter to the Editor: A comment on Lynch et al. (2009)". ''Psychological Medicine'' 40 (5): 877–880. doi:10.1017/S0033291709991838. PMID 19917145</ref><ref>Kingdon, D. (2009). "Over-simplification and exclusion of non-conforming studies can demonstrate absence of effect: A lynching party?". Psychological Medicine 40 (1): 25–27. doi:10.1017/S0033291709990201.

The element of hope and expectation on the part of the patients to get better in non-blinded trials will bias the results in favor of CBT. The informed consent procedure required to enter a psychotherapy trial biases the subjects who enter to those that are favorably inclined to the psychotherapy. Taken together, trials using psychotherapy do not meet the qualifications of high quality evidence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sathyanarayana R, Andrade C | year = 2013 | title = Screening for disease, psychologic testing, and psychotherapy: Looking behind the mirror | url = | journal = Indian J Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 103–105 }}</ref>

==History==

===Behavior therapy roots===
Precursors of certain fundamental aspects of CBT have been identified in various ancient philosophical traditions, particularly [[Stoicism]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&pg=PR19&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy| author=Donald Robertson|page=xix |year=2010| publisher=Karnac| location=London| isbn=978-1-85575-756-1}}</ref> For example, [[Aaron T.

It was during the period 1950 to 1970 that behavioral therapy became widely utilized by researchers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa, who were inspired by the [[behaviorism|behaviorist]] learning theory of [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[John B. Watson]], and [[Clark L.

Much of this work was concentrated on severe chronic psychiatric disorders, such as psychotic behavior<ref>{{Cite book|author=Ayllon T, Azrin N |title=The token economy |year=1968 |publisher=Wiley}}{{Page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref> and [[autism]].<ref name="Rachman_1997" /><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=13763751 |year=1961 |last1=Lovaas |first1=OI |title=Interaction between verbal and nonverbal behavior |volume=32 |pages=329–36 |journal=Child Development}}</ref>

===Other roots===
Although the early behavioral approaches were successful in many of the neurotic disorders, they had little success in treating [[major depressive disorder|depression]].<ref name="Rachman_1997" /> <!-- Mention early attempts by Ferster and Lewinsohn? --> Behaviorism was also losing in popularity due to the so-called "[[cognitive revolution]]".<!-- Kanter et al. 2007 may serve as reference --> The therapeutic approaches of [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] and [[Aaron T. Beck]] gained popularity among behavior therapists, despite the earlier behaviorist rejection of "[[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]]" concepts like thoughts and cognitions.  Both of these systems included behavioral elements and interventions and primarily concentrated on problems in the present. Albert Ellis' system, originated in the early 1950s, was first called [[rational therapy]], and can (arguably) be called one of the first forms of cognitive behavioral therapy. It was partly founded as a reaction against popular psychotherapeutic theories at the time (mainly [[psychoanalysis]]).<ref>{{Cite book |author= Ellis A |authorlink=Albert Ellis (psychologist) |title= A New Guide to Rational Living |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |year=1975 |isbn=0-13-370650-8 }}{{pn|date=April 2013}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2012}} Beck describes his therapeutic approach as originating in a realization he made while conducting [[Free association (psychology)|free association]] with patients in the context of classical psychoanalysis. He noted that patients had not been reporting certain thoughts at the fringe of consciousness – thoughts which often preceded intense emotional reactions. This realization led Beck to begin viewing emotional reactions as resulting from ''cognitions'', rather than understanding emotion within the abstract psychoanalytic framework.<ref>Beck, Aaron T., ''Prisoners of Hate: The Cognitive Basis of Anger, Hostility, and Violence'', Harper Collins, 1999, Introduction.{{pn|date=April 2013}}</ref> He named these cognitions "automatic thoughts" because he believed that people were not necessarily aware that the cognitions existed, but that they could identify these types of thoughts when questioned closely.<ref name="Martin">{{Unreliable medical source|date=April 2012}} {{cite web |author=Martin, Ben| title=In-Depth: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy| url= http://psychcentral.com/lib/2007/in-depth-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/all/1/|publisher=PsychCentral |accessdate= March 15, 2012}}</ref> Beck believed that pushing his clients to identify these automatic thoughts was integral to overcoming a particular difficulty.<ref name="Martin"/>

In initial studies, cognitive therapy was often contrasted with behavioral treatments to see which was most effective. During the 1980s and 1990s, cognitive and behavioral techniques were merged into cognitive behavioral therapy. Pivotal to this merging was the successful development of treatments for [[panic disorder]] by [[David M. Clark]] in the UK and [[David H. Barlow]] in the US.<ref name="Rachman_1997" />

==Society and culture==
