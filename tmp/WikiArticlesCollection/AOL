AOL is best known for its [[online]] [[software suite]], also called ''AOL'', that allowed customers to access the world's largest "[[Walled garden (technology)|walled garden]]" [[online community]] and eventually reach out to the Internet as a whole. At its peak, AOL's membership was over 30 million members worldwide,<ref name="lessbemore">{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jul2006/tc20060731_168094.htm |title=Will Less Be More for AOL? |first=Catherine |last=Holahan |work=BusinessWeek  |date=July 31, 2006 |accessdate=August 1, 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060903070936/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jul2006/tc20060731_168094.htm?| archivedate= 3 September 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> most of whom accessed the AOL service through the AOL software suite.

In 2000, AOL and [[Time Warner]] merged under the name AOL Time Warner. The merger was not fruitful and on May 28, 2009, Time Warner announced that it would [[Corporate spin-off|spin off]] AOL into a separate public company.

Since then, AOL has begun to substantially change its business model reinventing itself as a brand company under the guidance of CEO Tim Armstrong, creating and acquiring a range of content properties.

In April 2012, AOL took several steps to expand its ability to generate revenue through online video advertising.

AOL began as a short-lived venture called '''Control Video Corporation''' (or '''CVC'''), founded by [[Bill von Meister]]. Its sole product was an online service called [[GameLine]] for the [[Atari 2600]] [[video game console]] after von Meister's idea of buying music on demand was rejected by [[Warner Bros.]].<ref name="Klein2003">{{cite book |last=Klein |first=Alec |title=Stealing Time: Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Collapse of AOL Time Warner |year=2003 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-7432-5984-X }}</ref> Subscribers bought a [[modem]] from the company for {{nowrap|49.95 USD}} and paid a one-time {{nowrap|15 USD}} setup fee. GameLine permitted subscribers to temporarily download games and keep track of high scores, at a cost of {{nowrap|1 USD}} per game. The telephone disconnected and the downloaded game would remain in GameLine's Master Module and playable until the user turned off the console or downloaded another game.

The original technical team was composed of Marc Seriff, Tom Ralston, Ken Huntsman, Janet Hunter, Dave Brown, Steve Trus, Ray Heinrich, Mike Ficco, Craig Dykstra, and Doug Coward.

In January 1983, [[Steve Case]] was hired as a marketing consultant for Control Video on the recommendation of his brother, investment banker Dan Case. In May 1983, [[Jim Kimsey]] became a manufacturing consultant for Control Video, which was near bankruptcy. Kimsey was brought in by his West Point friend [[Frank Caufield]], an investor in the company.<ref name="Klein2003" /> In early 1985, Von Meister quietly left the company.

On May 24, 1985, Quantum Computer Services, an online services company, was founded by Jim Kimsey from the remnants of Control Video with Kimsey as [[Chief Executive Officer]] and [[Marc Seriff]] as [[Chief Technology Officer]]. Out of 100 employees from Control Video, only 10 were retained for the new company,<ref name="Klein2003" /> one of which was Steve Case, who got promoted to vice-president of marketing. In 1987, Case was promoted again to executive vice-president. Kimsey soon began to groom Case to ascend to the rank of CEO, which he did when Kimsey retired in 1991.

Kimsey changed the company's strategy and in 1985, launched a dedicated online service for [[Commodore 64]] and [[Commodore 128|128]] computers, originally called [[Quantum Link]] ("Q-Link" for short). The Quantum Link software was based on software licensed from [[PlayNET|PlayNet, Inc]], (founded in 1983 by Howard Goldberg and Dave Panzl). In May 1988, Quantum and Apple launched [[AppleLink]] Personal Edition for [[Apple II family|Apple II]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers. In August 1988, Quantum launched PC Link, a service for IBM-compatible [[personal computer|PCs]] developed in a joint venture with the [[Tandy Corporation]]. After the company parted ways with Apple in October 1989, Quantum changed the service's name to America Online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1989.htm |title=History of Computing Industrial Era (1985–1990) |work=The History of Computing Project |accessdate=September 24, 2005 |date=March 20, 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051103111647/http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1989.htm| archivedate= 3 November 2005 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah22.html |title=Apple II history chapter 22 |date=December 31, 2002 |accessdate=September 24, 2005 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050828233812/http://apple2history.org/history/ah22.html| archivedate= 28 August 2005 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

[[Steve Case]] positioned AOL as the online service for people unfamiliar with computers, in particular contrast to [[CompuServe]], which had long served the technical community. The PlayNet system that AOL licensed was the first online service to require use of [[proprietary software]], rather than a standard terminal program; it also offered a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) instead of command lines, and was well ahead of the competition in emphasizing communication among members as a feature.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

From the beginning, AOL included [[online games]] in its mix of products; many classic and casual games were included in the original PlayNet software system. In the early years of AOL the company introduced many innovative online interactive titles and games, including:
* Graphical chat environments [[Habitat (video game)|Habitat]] (1986–1988) and [[Club Caribe]] (1988) from [[LucasArts]].
* The first online interactive fiction series [[QuantumLink Serial]] by [[Tracy Reed (writer)|Tracy Reed]] (1988).
* [[Quantum Space]], the first fully automated [[Play-by-mail game|Play by email]] game (1989–1991).

===1990s: a new internet age===
In February 1991, AOL for [[DOS]] was launched using a [[GeoWorks]] interface followed a year later by AOL for Windows. This coincided with growth in pay-based online services, like [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], [[CompuServe]], and [[GEnie]]. 1991 also saw the introduction of an original [[Dungeons & Dragons]] title called ''[[Neverwinter Nights (AOL game)|Neverwinter Nights]]'' from [[Stormfront Studios]]; it was the first Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game to depict the adventure with graphics instead of text.

During the early 1990s, the average subscription lasted for about 25 months and accounted for $350 in total revenue.<ref name="quora20101224">{{cite web | url=http://www.quora.com/AOL-History/How-much-did-it-cost-AOL-to-distribute-all-those-CDs-back-in-the-1990s | title=AOL History: How much did it cost AOL to distribute all those CDs back in the 1990's? | publisher=Quora | date=2010-12-24 | accessdate=July 13, 2012}}</ref> AOL discontinued Q-Link and PC Link in the fall of 1994.  In September 1993, AOL added [[USENET]] access to its features.<ref>[http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/S/September-that-never-ended.html Catb.org]. Catb.org. Retrieved on July 8, 2011.</ref> This is commonly referred to as the "[[Eternal September]]".  AOL quickly surpassed [[GEnie]], and by the mid-1990s, it passed [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]] (which for several years allowed AOL advertising) and [[CompuServe]].

Particularly notable was the [[Chat Room]] concept from PlayNet, as opposed to the previous paradigm of [[Citizens' band radio|CB]]-style channels. Chat Rooms allowed a large group of people with similar interests to convene and hold conversations in real time, including:
* Private rooms – created by any user. Hold up to 23 people.
* Conference rooms – created with permission of AOL. Hold up to 48 people and often moderated.
* Auditoriums – created with permission of AOL. Consisted of a stage and an unlimited number of rows. What happened on the stage was viewable by everybody in the auditorium but what happened within individual rows, of up to 27 people, was viewable only by the people within those rows.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Between 1990–94,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} AOL launched services with the [[National Education Association]], the [[American Federation of Teachers]], ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[Library of Congress]], Pearson, Scholastic, ASCD, NSBA, NCTE, Discovery Networks, Turner Education Services (CNN Newsroom), National Public Radio, The Princeton Review, Stanley Kaplan, Barron's, Highlights for Kids, the US Department of Education, and many other education providers. AOL's offered the first real-time homework help service (the Teacher Pager—1990; prior to this, AOL provided homework help bulletin boards), the first service by children, for children (Kids Only Online, 1991), the first online service for parents (the Parents Information Network, 1991), the first online courses (1988), the first omnibus service for teachers (the Teachers' Information Network, 1990), the first online exhibit (Library of Congress, 1991), the first parental controls, and many other online education firsts.

The first chat room-based text role-playing game, [[Black Bayou]]. was introduced by AOL in 1996.

AOL charged its users an hourly fee until October 1996, when the company changed to a flat monthly rate of $19.95. During this time, AOL connections would be flooded with users trying to get on, and many canceled their accounts due to constant [[busy signal]]s. A commercial featuring Steve Case telling people AOL was working day and night to fix the problem was made. Within three years, AOL's userbase grew to 10 million people. In 1995 AOL was headquartered at 8619 Westwood Center Drive in the [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner CDP]] in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], Virginia,<ref>"[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-832840.html Encyclopedia.com]" ''[[The Washington Post]]''.

AOL was quickly running out of room in October 1996 for its network at the Fairfax County campus. In 1996,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} AOL moved to 22000 AOL Way in [[Dulles, Virginia|Dulles]], unincorporated [[Loudoun County, Virginia]].<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080208121604/http://corp.aol.com/about-aol/company-overview Company Overview]."

In a five-year landmark agreement with the most popular operating system, AOL was bundled with Windows software.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

On March 31, 1997, the short-lived [[eWorld]] was purchased by AOL.

AOL announced on November 24, 1998 that it would acquire [[Netscape]]. The deal closed on March 17, 1999.

===2000s: transition and rebranding===
[[File:Aol subscribers Q201-Q407.png|thumb|right|Decline in U.S. subscribers 2Q 2001 – 2Q 2009.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}]]
In January 2000, AOL and [[Time Warner]] announced plans to merge, forming AOL Time Warner, Inc. The terms of the deal called for AOL shareholders to own 55% of the new, combined company. The deal closed on January 11, 2001. The new company was led by executives from AOL, SBI, and Time Warner. Gerald Levin, who had served as CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company.

== Criticism ==
{{main|Criticism of AOL}}
In its earlier incarnation as a “walled garden” community and service provider, AOL received criticism for its community policies, terms of service, and customer service. Prior to 2006, AOL was known for its direct mailing of CD-ROMs and 3½" floppy disks containing its software. The disks were distributed in large numbers; at one point, half of the CDs manufactured worldwide had AOL logos on them.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/27/aol-discs-90s/ | title=Comment How Much Did It Cost AOL To Send Us Those CDs In The 90s?

== In popular culture ==
America Online is mentioned in [[You've Got Mail]]. The ''You've Got Mail'' voice was also heard in the AOL Demo video.

In episode 120 ("Tiki Lounge") of [[Malcolm in the Middle]], Malcolm complains that the booster club auction items are all embarrassingly worthless. One of the items in the auction was an AOL startup disc. This was probably a reference to the high volume of startup discs given out by the company (see also Urban Dictionary [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=AOL%20Disc AOL Disc], [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=AOL%20Frisbee AOL Frisbee], and related terms).

In the American comedy TV show [[Crank Yankers]], one of the show's puppet characters Special Ed (voiced by [[Jim Florentine]]) tries to get customer support from a computer repair company, repeatedly saying the AOL catchphrase "I've got mail, YAY!" throughout his prank phone call.  The routine has become somewhat of an internet sensation, contributing to the popularity of the Special Ed character.
