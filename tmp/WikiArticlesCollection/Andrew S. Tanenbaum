''Operating Systems: Design and Implementation'' and MINIX<ref>[http://www.minix3.org/ The MINIX 3 Operating System]</ref> were [[Linus Torvalds]]' inspiration for the [[Linux]] kernel. In his autobiography ''[[Just for Fun]]'', Torvalds describes it as "the book that launched me to new heights".

His books have been translated into many languages including Arabic, Basque, Bulgarian, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Macedonian, Mexican Spanish, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish.<ref>[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/home/faq.html Andrew S. Tanenbaum's FAQ]</ref> They have appeared in over 120 editions and are used at universities around the world.<ref>[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications Andrew S. Tanenbaum - Publications]</ref>

===Doctoral students===
Tanenbaum has had a number of [[Ph.D.]] students who themselves have gone on to become widely known computer science researchers.
These include:
* [[Henri Bal]], a professor at the [[Vrije Universiteit]] in [[Amsterdam]];
* [[Frans Kaashoek]], a professor at [[MIT]];
* Sape Mullender, a researcher at [[Bell Labs]];
* Robbert van Renesse, a professor at [[Cornell University]];
* Leendert van Doorn, a fellow at the [[AMD]] Corporation;
* [[Werner Vogels]],<ref name="vogelsphd"/> the Chief Technology Officer at [[Amazon.com]].

===Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging===
In the early 1990s, the Dutch government began setting up a number of thematically oriented research schools that spanned multiple universities. These schools were intended to bring professors and Ph.D. students from different Dutch (and later, foreign) universities together to help them cooperate and enhance their research.

Tanenbaum was one of the cofounders and first Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging (ASCI). This school initially consisted of nearly 200 faculty members and Ph.D. students from the [[Vrije Universiteit]], [[University of Amsterdam]], [[Delft University of Technology]], and [[Leiden University]] working in the areas of advanced computer systems, especially parallel computing, and image analysis and processing.

Tanenbaum remained Dean for 12 years, until 2005, when he was awarded an Academy Professorship by the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]], at which time he became a full-time research professor. ASCI has since grown to include researchers from nearly a dozen universities in The Netherlands, Belgium, and France. ASCI offers Ph.D. level courses, has an annual conference, and runs various workshops every year.

==Projects==

===Amsterdam Compiler Kit===
The [[Amsterdam Compiler Kit]] is a toolkit for producing portable compilers. It was started sometime before 1981,<ref>[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications/ Andrew S. Tanenbaum - Publications, Colloquia section]</ref> and Andrew Tanenbaum was the architect from the start until version 5.5.

===MINIX===
In 1987, Tanenbaum wrote a clone of [[UNIX]], called [[MINIX]] (MIni-uNIX), for the [[IBM PC]]. It was targeted at students and others who wanted to learn how an operating system worked. Consequently, he wrote a book<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0131429388 Amazon.com: Operating Systems Design and Implementation (3rd Edition) (Prentice Hall Software Series): Andrew S Tanenbaum, Albert S Woodhull: Books]</ref> that listed the source code in an appendix and described it in detail in the text. The source code itself was available on a set of floppy disks. Within three months, a [[USENET]] newsgroup, comp.os.minix,<ref>news:comp.os.minix</ref> had sprung up with over 40,000 subscribers discussing and improving the system. One of these subscribers was a Finnish student named [[Linus Torvalds]] who began adding new features to MINIX and tailoring it to his own needs. On October 5, 1991, Torvalds announced his own ([[POSIX]] like) kernel, called [[Linux]], which originally used the MINIX file system, but it is not based on MINIX code.<ref>[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/ Some notes on the "Who wrote Linux" Kerfuffle] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5sfayBi29|date =2010-09-11}}</ref>

Although MINIX and Linux have diverged, MINIX continues to be developed, now as a production system as well as an educational one.<ref>[http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2006-04/openpdfs/herder.pdf USENIX April 06]</ref> The focus is on building a highly modular, reliable, and secure, operating system. The system is based on a [[microkernel]], with only 5000 lines of code<ref>[http://www.few.vu.nl/~ast/ Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Professor at the Vrije Universiteit]</ref> running in kernel mode. The rest of the operating system runs as a number of independent processes in user mode, including processes for the file system, process manager, and each device driver. The system continuously monitors each of these processes, and when a failure is detected is often capable of automatically replacing the failed process without a reboot, without disturbing running programs, and without the user even noticing. [[MINIX 3]], as the current version is called, is available under the [[BSD license]] for free.

===Research projects===
Tanenbaum has also been involved in numerous other research projects in the areas of operating systems, distributed systems, and ubiquitous computing, often as supervisor of Ph.D. students or a [[postdoctoral researcher]]. These projects include:
* [[Amoeba distributed operating system|Amoeba]]<ref>{{cite doi|10.1145/96267.96281}}</ref>
* Globe<ref>{{cite doi|10.1109/4434.749137}}</ref>
* Mansion{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
* Orca<ref name="orca">{{cite doi|10.1109/32.126768}}</ref>
* Paramecium<ref>{{cite doi|10.1109/HOTOS.1995.513460}}</ref>
* [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] Guardian<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/s10796-009-9210-z}}</ref>
* [[Turtle F2F]]

===Electoral-vote.com===
In 2004, Tanenbaum created [[Electoral-vote.com]], a web site analyzing [[opinion polls]] for the [[2004 U.S. Presidential Election]], using them to project the outcome in the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]]. He stated that he created the site as an American who "knows first hand what the world thinks of America and it is not a pretty picture at the moment. I want people to think of America as the land of freedom and democracy, not the land of arrogance and blind revenge. I want to be proud of America again."<ref name="EVFAQ">[http://web.archive.org/web/20041102014915/www.electoral-vote.com/info/votemaster-faq.html The Votemaster FAQ]</ref> The site provided a color-coded map, updated each day with projections for each state's electoral votes. Through most of the campaign period Tanenbaum kept his identity secret, referring to himself as "the Votemaster" and acknowledging only that he personally preferred [[John Kerry]]. A [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] who supports the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]], he revealed his identity on November 1, 2004, the day prior to the election, also stating his reasons and qualifications for running the website.<ref name="EVFAQ" /> 

Through the site he also covered the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], correctly predicting the winner of all 33 Senate races that year.

For the 2008 elections, he got every state right except for Indiana, which he said McCain would win by 2% (Obama won by 1%) and Missouri, which he said was too close to call (McCain won by 0.1%). He correctly predicted all the winners in the Senate except for Minnesota, where he predicted a 1% win by [[Norm Coleman]] over [[Al Franken]]. After 7 months of legal battling and recounts, Franken won by 312 votes (0.01%).

In 2010, he correctly projected 35 out of 37 Senate races in the Midterm elections on the website. The exceptions were [[Colorado]] and [[Nevada]].

==Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate==
The [[Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate]] was a famous friendly debate between Tanenbaum and Linus Torvalds regarding kernel design on [[Usenet]] in 1992.
