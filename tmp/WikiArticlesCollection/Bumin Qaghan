According to ''[[History of Northern Dynasties]]'' and ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', in 545 Tumen's tribe started to rise and frequently invaded the western frontier of Wei.

And in the same year he put down a revolt of the [[Tiele people|Tiele tribes]] against their overlords the [[Rouran Khaganate]].<ref name="Zizhi159"/> He took advantage of this success and requested a Rouran princess in marriage. But the qaghan of Rouran [[Yujiulü Anagui|Anagui]] refused this request and sent to Bumin a mission and message: ''You are my blacksmith slave. How dare you utter these words?''.

Anagui's "blacksmith" ([[wikt:鍛|鍛]][[wikt:奴|奴]] / 锻奴, Pinyin: duàn nú, Wade-Giles: tuan-nu) insult was recorded in Chinese chronicles and historians accepted that the Kök Türks were indeed blacksmith servants for the Rouran elite,<ref name="Ma Zhangshou" /><ref name="Fengxiang" /><ref name="Gao Yang" /><ref name="Burhan Oğuz" /> and that "blacksmith slavery" may indicate a kind of vassalage system prevailed in Rouran society.<ref>Larry W.

In 551, Bumin requested a Western Wei princess in marriage. Yuwen Tai permitted it and sent [[Princess Changle]] of Western Wei to Bumin.<ref name="Northern99"/><ref name="Zhou50"/><ref name="Zizhi164"/>　In the same year when [[Emperor Wen of Western Wei|Emperor Wen]] of Western Wei died Bumin sent mission and gave two hundred horses.<ref name="Northern99"/><ref name="Zhou50"/>

The beginning of formal diplomatic relations with China propped up Bumin's authority among the Turks. He eventually united the local Turkic tribes and threw off the yoke of the [[Rouran]] domination.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 552 Bumin's army defeated Anagui's forces at the north of [[Six Frontier Towns|Huaihuang]] and then Anagui committed suicide.<ref name="Zhou50"/> With their defeat Bumin proclaimed himself "Illig Qaghan" and made his wife qaghatun.<ref name="Zhou50"/> According to the [[Khöshöö Tsaidam Monuments|Bilge Qaghan's memorial complex]] and the [[Khöshöö Tsaidam Monuments|Kul Tigin's memorial conplex]], Bumin and [[Istemi]] ruled people by Turkic laws and they developed them.<ref name="Kultegin"/><ref name="Bilge">[http://irq.kaznpu.kz/?lang=e&mod=1&tid=1&oid=16&m=1 Bilge kagan’s Memorial Complex, TÜRIK BITIG]</ref>

Bumin died within several months after proclaiming himself Illig Qaghan. He was succeeded by his younger brother [[Istemi]] in the western part and by his son [[Issik Qaghan]] in the eastern part. In less than one century, his khaganate expanded to comprise most of [[Central Asia]].
