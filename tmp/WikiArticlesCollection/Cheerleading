'''Cheerleading''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɪ|ə|ɹ|l|i|d|ɪ|ŋ}} is an intense [[physical activity]] based upon organized routines, usually ranging anywhere from one to three minutes, which contains many components of [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]], [[dance]], [[List of cheerleading jumps|jumps]], [[cheering|cheers]] and [[List of cheerleading stunts|stunting]] in order to direct spectators of events to cheer for sports teams at games or to participate in cheerleading competitions. The athlete involved in cheerleading is called a '''cheerleader'''. Cheerleading originated in the United States, and remains predominantly American, with an estimated 1.5 million participants in all-star cheerleading. The presentation of cheerleading as a sport to a global audience was led by the 1997 start of broadcasts of cheerleading competition by [[ESPN]] International and the worldwide release of the 2000 film ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]''. Due in part to this recent exposure, there are now an estimated 100,000 participants scattered around the rest of the world in countries including Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Finland, France, Germany, Japan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fjca.jp/ |title=Foundation of Japan Cheerleading Association (FJCA) |publisher=Fjca.jp |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref> the Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.<ref name="nw20007">{{cite journal|last=Campo-Flores| first=Arian |title=A World of Cheer! |journal=[[Newsweek]] |date=2007-05-14 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/34924 |accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref>

It was not until 1898 that University of Minnesota student Johnny Campbell directed a crowd in cheering "Rah, Rah, Rah! Ski-u-mah, Hoo-Rah! Hoo-Rah! Varsity! Varsity! Varsity, Minn-e-So-Tah!", making Campbell the very first cheerleader and November 2, 1898 the official birth date of organized cheerleading.

Women joined cheerleading prior to 1907 and began to dominate it during World War II, when few men were involved in organized sports. Gymnastics, tumbling and [[megaphone]]s were incorporated into popular cheers, and are still used.<ref name="history1"/>

Statistics show that around 97% of all modern cheerleading participants overall are female. At the collegiate level, cheerleading is co-ed with about 50% of participants being male.<ref name="popwarner">{{cite web | last=Balthaser | first=Joel D. | title=Cheerleading – Oh How far it has come! | publisher=[[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] | date=2005-01-06 | url=http://www.popwarner.com/articles/phenomenon.asp | accessdate=2007-01-11}}</ref>

In 1948, Lawrence "Herkie" Herkimer, of Dallas, Texas, a former cheerleader at [[Southern Methodist University]], formed the National Cheerleaders Association (NCA) in order to hold clinics for cheerleading. In 1949, The National Cheerleaders Association held its first clinic in Huntsville, Texas, with 52 girls in attendance.<ref name="popwarner"/> Herkimer contributed many firsts to the cheer: the founding of the Cheerleader & Danz Team [[cheerleading uniform]] supply company, inventing the [[herkie]] (where one leg is bent towards the ground and the other is out to the side as high as it will stretch in the toe-touch position),<ref name="cheerleading.about">{{cite web | title=Cheerleading Jump Herkie | url=http://cheerleading.about.com/cs/jumps/g/herkie.htm | accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> and creating the "Spirit Stick".<ref name="ACFeb2003"/> By the 1960s, college cheerleaders began hosting workshops across the nation, teaching fundamental cheer skills to high-school-age girls. In 1965, Fred Gastoff invented the vinyl [[pom-pon]], which was introduced into competitions by the International Cheerleading Foundation (now the World Cheerleading Association or WCA). Organized cheerleading competitions began to pop up with the first ranking of the "Top Ten College Cheerleading Squads" and "Cheerleader All America" awards given out by the International Cheerleading Foundation in 1967.  In 1978, America was introduced to competitive cheerleading by the first broadcast of [[Collegiate Cheerleading Championships]] on [[CBS]].<ref name="ICFHandbook"/><ref name="ACFeb2003"/>

[[File:Early women cheerleaders at UW Madison (2246608893).jpg|thumb|right|340px|Cheerleaders at the [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]] in 1948]]
In the 1960s [[National Football League]] (NFL) teams began to organize their own professional cheerleading teams.  The [[Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders]] soon gained the spotlight with their revealing outfits and sophisticated dance moves, which debuted in the 1972–1973 season, but were first seen widely in [[Super Bowl X]] (1976). This caused the image of cheerleaders to permanently change, with many other NFL teams emulating them.

The 1980s saw the beginning of modern cheerleading with more difficult stunt sequences and gymnastics incorporated into routines. All-star teams started to pop up, and with them the creation of the United States All-Star Federation (USASF). ESPN first broadcast the National High School Cheerleading Competition nationwide in 1983. Cheerleading organizations such as the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Advisors (AACCA), founded in 1987, started applying universal safety standards to decrease the number of injuries and prevent dangerous stunts, pyramids and tumbling passes from being included in the cheerleading routines.<ref name="AACCA">{{cite web | title=About the AACCA | url=http://www.aacca.org/about.asp | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061206110741/http://www.aacca.org/about.asp | archivedate=2006-12-06 | accessdate=2007-01-11}}</ref> In 2003, the National Council for Spirit Safety and Education (NCSSE) was formed to offer safety training for youth, school, all star and college coaches. The NCAA requires college cheer coaches to successfully complete a nationally recognized safety-training program. The NCSSE or AACCA certification programs are both recognized by the NCAA.

Even with its athletic and competitive development, cheerleading at the school level has retained its ties to the spirit leading traditions started back in the 1890s. Cheerleaders are quite often seen as ambassadors for their schools, and leaders among the student body. At the college level, cheerleaders are often invited to help at university fundraisers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Cheerleading is very closely associated with [[American football]] and [[basketball]]. Sports such as [[association football]] (soccer), [[ice hockey]], [[volleyball]], [[baseball]] and [[wrestling]] will sometimes sponsor cheerleading squads. The ICC Twenty20 Cricket World Cup in South Africa in 2007 was the first international cricket event to have cheerleaders. The [[Florida Marlins]] were the first [[Major League Baseball]] team to have a cheerleading team. Debuting in 2003, the "Marlin Mermaids" gained national exposure and have influenced other MLB teams to develop their own cheer/dance squads.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==Types of teams in the United States today==

[[File:University of Memphis Coed Cheerleaders.jpg|thumb|University of Memphis Cheerleaders performing a Co-ed double Cupie]]

===School-sponsored===
Most American middle schools, high schools, and colleges have organized cheerleading squads made up solely of students. Several colleges that compete at cheerleading competitions offer cheerleading scholarships. School-sponsored cheerleading promotes school spirit and motivate the players and fans as well as enjoyment for the participants. A cheerleading team may compete outside of sporting events (local, regional, and national competitions), and cheer for sporting events and encourage audience participation. Cheerleading is quickly becoming year-round, starting with tryouts during the spring of the preceding school year, organized camp as a team, practices, attendance at various events and ending with National competition season, typically from winter through spring.

School cheerleaders also compete with recreational-style routines at many competitions year-round. They practice hardly for them and come up with a no greater than 2 minute 30 second routine to show off at the competitions. Like other school-level athletes they compete to win their league title and move on to bigger competitions eventually reaching nationals the ultimate title for a school squad.  The advantages to a school squad versus an all-star squad is cheering at various games. For some squads the level of competition on the weekends can equal that of an all-star squad.

The tryout process sometimes takes place over many days. The cheerleading coach usually will arrange for a cheerleading clinic, during which basic materials are taught or reviewed before the final day of tryouts. The clinic gives returning cheerleaders and new cheerleaders an equal chance of becoming familiar with the material. Skills that coaches look for include jumps, tumbling, motions, and dance ability. Tryouts often take place during the spring, so that the coach has the team chosen in time to attend summer camp as a team.

====Middle school====
[[Middle school]] cheerleading evolved shortly after high school squads started. In middle school, the squads serve mostly the same functions as high school squads and usually follow the same rules and regulations. Depending on how advanced the squad is, they usually do similar stunts to high school cheer squads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcpss.net/athletics/middle_school/cheerleading.pdf |title=WCPSS.net |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref>  The cheerleaders cheer for basketball teams, football teams, and other sports teams in their school. They also perform at pep rallies and compete against other schools from local competitions all the way to nationals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmscheer.com/ |title=Martin Middle School Cheerleading Squad (4 Time National Champions) |publisher=Mmscheer.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref>  Cheerleading in middle school sometimes can be a two-season activity: fall and winter. However, many middle school cheer squads will go all year round like high school squads. Middle school cheerleaders use the same cheerleading movements as their older counterparts, yet they perform less extreme stunts, ranging from simple elevators, knee stands, extensions to harder stunts such as the heel stretch and scorpion.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[File:Mercer Island High School Cheerleaders.jpg|left|thumb|275px|High school cheerleaders]]

====High school====
In high school, there are usually two squads per school: [[varsity team|varsity]] and a [[junior varsity team|junior varsity]]. Some schools also include a freshman level of cheering in order to develop skills as the athletes continue to mature. High school cheerleading contains aspects of school spirit as well as competition. These squads have become a part of a year-round cycle, starting with tryouts in the spring, to year-round practice, to cheering on teams in the [[autumn]] and [[winter]], and to cheerleading competitions. Most squads practice at least three days a week for about two hours each practice during the summer. Many teams also attend separate tumbling sessions outside of practice. During the school year, cheerleading is usually practiced five- to six-days-a-week. During competition season it often becomes seven days with practice twice a day sometimes. The school spirit aspect of cheerleading involves cheering, supporting, and "pumping up" the crowd at football games, basketball games, and even at wrestling meets. With this they also make posters, perform at pep rallies, and bring school spirit to the other students. In May 2009, the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] released the results of their first true high school participation study. They estimated that the number of high school cheerleaders from public high schools is around 394,700.<ref>[http://www.nfhs.org/web/2009/05/survey_indicates_nearly_400000.aspx NFHS.org]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref>

There is year-round practice, cheer camps, and competitions throughout the winter. There are different cheerleading organizations that put on these competitions, some of the major ones include state competitions and regional competitions. Many high schools will often host cheerleading competitions, bringing in IHSA judges. The regional competitions are the qualifiers for the national competitions, such as the [http://www.uca.varsity.com/ UCA (Universal Cheerleaders Association)] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]] every year.<ref>Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA) 2008. 7 December 2008. [http://uca.varsity.com Varsity.com]</ref> The competition aspect of cheerleading can be very enduring; styles and rules changing every year make it important and difficult to find the newest and hottest routines.<ref>AACCA American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators. 2008. 7 December 2008. [http://www.aacca.org/ AACCA.org]</ref> Most teams have a professional choreographer choreograph their routine in order to ensure they are not breaking any rules and they will be up to par with the other teams. For a list of rules visit [http://www.aacca.org/ AACCA (American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators)]. All high school coaches are required to attend an IHSA rules meeting at the beginning of the season. This ensures their knowledge of rules changes and their compliance with these rules. Routines usually last around 2 minutes and 30 seconds and always require cheer, dance, jumps, tumbling, and stunting portions.

Not all high school cheerleading squads compete in competitions. Cheerleaders dress in matching uniforms, to look like a team while they are performing.<ref>"2008 Sun Prairie Coed ESPN Performance." YouTube. 2008. 7 December 2008. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y4jFwmIwhY Youtube.com]</ref>

===Youth league/athletic association===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
Certain organizations that sponsor youth league [[American football|football]] or [[basketball]] sponsor cheerleading squads as well.  [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] and PPAL [pasco police athletic league] organizations are an example of this.  The [[YMCA]] (Young Men's Christian Association) is also a popular sponsor for youth cheerleading leagues, as well as numerous other sports leagues.  Many local communities are creating organizations to go along with their Youth Football leagues and Youth Basketball leagues.

===All-star===
During the early 1980s, cheerleading squads not associated with a schools or sports leagues, whose main objective was competition, began to emerge. The first organization to call themselves all stars and go to competitions were the Q94 Rockers from [[Richmond, Virginia]], founded in 1982.<ref name="ACFeb2007">{{Cite journal | last = Smith | first = Jennifer Renèe | title = The All-Star Chronicles | journal = American Cheerleader | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 40–42 | month=  February|year=2007 }}</ref>  All-star teams competing prior to 1987 were placed into the same divisions as teams that represented schools and sports leagues. In 1986, the National Cheerleaders Association (NCA) addressed this situation by creating a separate division for teams lacking a sponsoring school or athletic association, calling it the All-Star Division and debuting it at their 1987 competitions.  As the popularity of this type of team grew, more and more of them were formed, attending competitions sponsored by many different organizations and companies, each using its own set of rules, regulations and divisions. This situation became a concern to gym owners because the inconsistencies caused coaches to keep their routines in a constant state of flux, detracting from time that could be better utilized for developing skills and providing personal attention to their athletes. More importantly, because the various companies were constantly vying for a competitive edge, safety standards had become more and more lax. In some cases, unqualified coaches and inexperienced squads were attempting dangerous stunts as a result of these expanded sets of rules.<ref name="varsity2004">{{cite web | title = The Cheerleading Worlds Administered by the USASF | publisher = Varsity Brands, Inc. | url = http://www.varsity.com/index.asp?article=1514 | accessdate = 2007-09-20 }}</ref>

The USASF was formed in 2003 by the competition companies to act as the national governing body for all star cheerleading and to create a standard set of rules and judging standards to be followed by all competitions sanctioned by the Federation, ultimately leading to the Cheerleading Worlds. The USASF hosted the first Cheerleading Worlds on April 24, 2004.<ref name="varsity2004"/> In 2009, the first All-Level Worlds was held. It included teams from all levels, with each winner continuing to the online championships, where teams from across the nation competed to win the Worlds Title. At the same time, cheerleading coaches from all over the country organized themselves for the same rule making purpose, calling themselves the National All Star Cheerleading Coaches Congress (NACCC). In 2005, the NACCC was absorbed by the USASF to become their rule making body.<ref name="ACFeb2007"/> In late 2006, the [[United States All Star Federation|USASF]] facilitated the creation of the International All-Star Federation (IASF).

{{As of|2012}} all-star cheerleading as sanctioned by the USASF involves a squad of 6–36 females and/or males. The squad prepares year-round for many different competition appearances, but they only actually perform for up to 2½ minutes during their team's routines. The numbers of competitions a team participates in varies from team to team, but generally, most teams tend to participate in eight-twelve competitions a year. These competitions include locals, which are normally taken place in school gymnasiums or local venues, nationals, hosted in big venues all around the U.S. with national champions, and the Cheerleading Worlds, taken place at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. During a competition routine, a squad performs carefully choreographed stunting, tumbling, jumping and dancing to their own custom music. Teams create their routines to an eight-count system and apply that to the music so that the team members execute the elements with precise timing and synchronization.

[[File:ROOSTERS CHEERGIRLS .jpg|187px|thumb|right|Cheergirls from Australia's [[National Rugby League]]]]

There are many different organizations that host their own state and national competitions. Some major companies include: Universal Spirit, AmeriCheer, Cheersport, Planet Spirit, Eastern Cheer and Dance Association, and the JAM Brands. This means that many gyms within the same area could be state and national champions for the same year and never have competed against each other. Currently, there is no system in place that awards only one state or national title.

Judges at the competition watch closely for illegal moves from the group or any individual member. Here, an illegal move is something that is not allowed in that division due to difficulty and/or safety restrictions. They look out for deductions, or things that go wrong, such as a dropped stunt. They also look for touch downs in tumbling for deductions. More generally, judges look at the difficulty and execution of jumps, stunts and tumbling, synchronization, creativity, the sharpness of the motions, showmanship, and overall routine execution.

All-star cheerleaders are placed into divisions, which are grouped based upon age, size of the team, gender of participants, and ability level. The age levels vary from under 4 year of age to 18 years and over. The divisions used by the [[United States All Star Federation|USASF/IASF]] are currently Tiny, Mini, Youth, Junior, Junior International, Junior Coed, Senior, Senior Coed, Special Needs, and Open International. It originally began with "all girl" teams and later co-ed teams began to gain popularity. That being said, the all girl squad remains the most prevalent.<ref name="USASF_Ages_07-08">{{cite web | title = USASF All-Star Cheer Divisions for 2007–2008 | url = https://secure.usasf.net/Documents/Rules/07-08/Age%20Grid%2007-08%20--%20Rev%203-23-07.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =  2007-06-29}}</ref>

If a team places high enough at selected [[United States All Star Federation|USASF/IASF]] sanctioned national competitions, they could be included in the [[United States All Star Federation|Cheerleading Worlds]] and compete against teams from all over the world, as well as receive money for placing.<ref name="nw20007"/> Each team receives a bid from another cheerleading company and goes in the name of that company. One must get a bid from a company in order to compete at the Cheerleading Worlds. For example, a team could get a bid from Cheersport, and they compete as a team representing that company. Cheerleading companies give out three types of bids to go to Cheerleading Worlds, Full Paid Bid, Parital Bid, or an Un-paid bid. The Cheerleading Worlds are only for teams that are level 5 and up.

===Professional===
Professional cheerleaders and dancers cheer for sports such as [[football]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[wrestling]], or [[hockey]].  There are only a small handful of professional cheerleading leagues around the world; some professional leagues include the [[National Basketball Association Cheerleading|NBA Cheerleading League]], the [[National Football League Cheerleading|NFL Cheerleading League]], the [[Canadian Football League Cheerleading|CFL Cheerleading League]], the [[MLS Cheerleading|MLS Cheerleading League]], the [[MLB Cheerleading|MLB Cheerleading League]], and the [[NHL Ice Dancers]].  Although professional cheerleading leagues exist in multiple countries, there are no [[Olympics|Olympic Teams]].

In addition to cheering at games and competing, professional cheerleaders also, as teams, can often do a lot of [[philanthropy]] and [[charity work]], [[model (person)|modeling]], [[motivational speaking]], [[reality television|television performances]], and [[advertising]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nflcheerleader.blogspot.com/2008/10/who-you-gonna-call-ghostbusters.html |title=Blogspot.com |publisher=Nflcheerleader.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?#doc_editlinks|date=May 2010}}

==Title IX sports status==

The risks of cheerleading were highlighted when Kristi Yamaoka, a cheerleader for Southern Illinois University, suffered a fractured vertebra when she hit her head after falling from a [[human pyramid]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.athleticmanagement.com/2007/02/13/cheer_bans_continue/index.php|title=Cheer Bans continue|work=Athletic Management|issue=August/September 2006|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>  She also suffered from a concussion, and a bruised lung.<ref name=CWT/>  The fall occurred when Yamaoka lost her balance during a basketball game between [[Southern Illinois University]] and [[Bradley University]] at the [[Savvis Center]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] on March 5, 2006.<ref name=CWT>{{cite web

The accident caused the Missouri Valley Conference to ban its member schools from allowing cheerleaders to be "launched or tossed and from taking part in formations higher than two levels" for one week during a women's basketball conference tournament, and also resulted in a recommendation by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] that conferences and tournaments do not allow pyramids two and one half levels high or higher, and a stunt known as basket tosses, during the rest of the men's and women's basketball season.<ref name="aacca.org">{{cite web

In the early 2000s, cheerleading was considered one of the most dangerous school activities.  The main source of injuries comes from [[List of cheerleading stunts|stunting]], also known as pyramids.  These stunts are performed at games and pep rallies, as well as competitions.  Sometimes competition routines are focused solely around the use of difficult and risky stunts.  These stunts usually include a flyer (the person on top), along with one or two bases (the people on the bottom) and, one or two spotters in the front and back on the bottom.  The most common cheerleading related injuries are: sprained ankles, sprained wrists, back injuries, head injuries (sometimes concussions), broken arms, elbow injuries, knee injuries, broken noses, and broken collarbones.<ref>{{cite web

The revamped and provocative Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders of the 1970s—and the many imitators that followed—firmly established the cheerleader as an American icon of wholesome sex appeal.  In response, a new subgenre of exploitation films suddenly sprang up with titles such as ''[[The Cheerleaders]]'' (1972), ''[[The Swinging Cheerleaders]]'' (1974), ''Revenge of the Cheerleaders'' (1975), ''The Pom Pom Girls'' (1976), ''[[Satan's Cheerleaders]]'' (1977), and ''Cheerleaders's Wild Weekend'' (1979).  In addition to R-rated sex comedies and horror films, cheerleaders became a staple of the adult film industry, starting with ''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]'' (1978) and its four sequels.

On television, the made-for-TV movie ''The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders'' (which aired January 14, 1979) starring [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] was a highly-rated success, spawning the 1980 sequel ''The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders II''.

The Dallas squad was in high demand during the late '70s with frequent appearances on network specials, awards shows, variety programs, commercials, the game show ''[[Family Feud]]'' and sitcoms such as ''[[The Love Boat]]''.  The sci-fi sitcom ''[[Mork & Mindy]]'' also based a 1979 episode around the [[Denver Broncos]] cheerleaders with Mork ([[Robin Williams]]) trying out for the squad.

Cheerleading's increasing popularity in recent decades has made it a prominent feature in high-school themed movies and television shows. The 2000 film ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]'', about a [[San Diego]] high school cheerleading squad called "The Toros", starred real-life former cheerleader [[Kirsten Dunst]].  ''Bring It On'' was a surprise hit and earned nearly $70 million domestically.  It spawned five direct-to-video [[sequels]]: ''[[Bring It On Again]]'' in 2003, ''[[Bring It On: All or Nothing]]'' in 2006, ''[[Bring It On: In It to Win It]]'' in 2007, and [[Bring It On: Fight to the Finish]].  ''Bring It On'' was followed in 2001 by another teen cheerleading comedy, ''[[Sugar & Spice]]''. In 1993, ''[[The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom]]'' was a [[TV movie]] which told the true story of [[Wanda Holloway]], the Texas mother whose obsession with her daughter's cheerleading career made headline news.

In 2006, [[Hayden Panettiere]], star of ''Bring It On: All or Nothing'', took another cheerleading role as [[Claire Bennet]], the cheerleader with an accelerated [[healing factor]] on [[NBC]]'s hit [[sci-fi]] [[TV series]] ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'', launching cheerleading back into the limelight of pop culture.  Claire was the main focus of the show's first story arc, featuring the popular catchphrase, "Save the cheerleader, save the world".  Her prominent, protagonist role in ''Heroes'' was supported by a strong fan-base and provided a positive image for high school cheerleading.

In 2009, Panettiere starred again as a cheerleader, this time as Beth Cooper in the film adaptation of the [[novel]] ''[[I Love You, Beth Cooper]]''.

In 2006, the reality show ''[[Cheerleader Nation]]'' was featured on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] television channel. ''Cheerleader Nation'' is a 60 minute television series based on the [[Paul Laurence Dunbar High School (Lexington, Kentucky)|Paul Laurence Dunbar High School]] cheerleading team's ups and downs on the way to nationals, of which they are the three time champions. The show also believes that cheerleading is tough. The show takes place in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].

The 2007 series ''[[Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team]]'' shows the process of getting on the pro squad of the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders. Everything from initial tryouts to workout routines and the difficulties involved is shown. The series was extended a year to show the process of getting the 2008 Cheerleaders ready.

In 2009, Universal Pictures signed music video and film director [[Billie Woodruff]] (''[[Barbershop (film)|Barbershop]]'', ''[[Honey (2003 film)|Honey]]'') to direct the fifth film in the ''Bring It On'' series titled ''[[Bring It On: Fight to the Finish]]''. The film stars [[Christina Milian]] (who previously played cheerleaders in ''[[Love Don't Cost a Thing (film)|Love Don't Cost a Thing]]'' and ''[[Man of the House (2005 crime comedy film)|Man of the House]]'') and Rachelle Brook Smith, and was released directly to DVD and Blu-ray on September 1, 2009.

The series ''[[Glee (TV Series)|Glee]]'', which began in 2009, features [[Dianna Agron]] as [[Quinn Fabray]], the captain of her high school cheerleading squad, the Cheerios. Quinn becomes pregnant, leading to her expulsion from the squad, but two of the other Cheerios, [[Santana Lopez]] and [[Brittany Pierce]] also feature heavily in the show. In "[[The Power of Madonna]]" [[Kurt Hummel]] joins the Cheerios along with [[Mercedes Jones]].

[[The CW Television Network]] created the short-lived ''[[Hellcats]]'' series (2010–11). This drama was about the ups and downs of being a college cheerleader. It starred [[Alyson Michalka]] as Marty (a former gymnast forced to become a cheerleader after her academic scholarship is canceled) and [[Ashley Tisdale]] from ''[[High School Musical]]''.

;Video games
Nintendo has released a pair of video games in Japan for the [[Nintendo DS]], ''[[Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan]]'' and its sequel ''[[Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2|Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii]]'' that star teams of male cheer squads, or [[Ouendan]] that practice a form of cheerleading. Each of the games' most difficult modes replaces the male characters with female cheer squads that dress in western cheerleading uniforms. The games task the cheer squads with assisting people in desperate need of help by cheering them on and giving them the motivation to succeed. There are also a ''All Star Cheerleader'' and ''[[We Cheer]]'' for the Wii in which one does routines at competitions with the Wiimote & Nunchuck. All Star Cheerleader is also available for Nintendo DS.

{{split section|Cheerleading in Canada|Talk:Cheerleading#Split|date=April 2013}}
<br />
Cheerleading in Canada is rising in popularity among the youth in co-curricular programs. Cheerleading has grown from the sidelines to a competitive activity throughout the world and in particular Canada. Cheerleading has a few streams in Canadian sports culture. It is available at the middle-school, high-school, collegiate and best known for all-star. There are multiple regional, provincial and national championship opportunities for all athletes participating in cheerleading. Canada does not have a provincial teams, just a national program referred to as CCU or Team Canada. Their first year as a National team was in 2009 when they represented Canada at the International Cheer Union World Cheerleading Championships [[International Cheer Union (ICU)]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CCU "About"|url=http://www.teamcanadacheer.com/index.php?componentName=AwardSection&scid=73773|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref>

=== Canada as a competition ===

There is no official governing body for Canadian Cheerleading. The rules and guidelines for cheerleading used in Canada are the ones set out by the [[U.S. All Star Federation|USASF]].<ref>{{cite web|title=USASF|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._All_Star_Federation|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref> However, there are many organizations in Canada that put on competitions and have separate and individual rules and scoresheets for each competition. Cheer Evolution is the largest cheerleading and dance organization for Canada. They hold many competitions as well as provide a competition for bids to Worlds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Cheer Evolution|url=http://www.linkedin.com/company/canadian-cheer-evolution|publisher=LinkedIn|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref> There are other organizations such as the Ontario Cheerleading Federation (Ontario), Power Cheerleading Association (Ontario), Kicks Athletics (Quebec) and the International Cheer Alliance (Vancouver). There are over forty recognized competitive gym clubs with numerous teams that compete at competitions across Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=Find A Club Near You|url=(http://canadiancheer.com/find-a-club-near-you/)|publisher=Cheer Evolution|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref>

=== Canada at the World Championships of Cheerleading (USASF/ICU) ===

There are two world championship competitions that Canada participates in. There is the ICU World Championships where the National Teams compete against each other and then there are the Club team World Championships. These club teams are referred to as "All-star" teams who compete at the USASF World Championships of Cheerleading. This is where teams must have earned a bid from their own country to attend. National team members who compete at the ICU Worlds can also compete with their "All-Star Club" teams.<ref>{{cite news|title=Canada looks for fourth straight gold medal|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/canada-looks-for-fourth-straight-cheerleading-gold-medal-1.798435|accessdate=2 April 2013|date=19 April 2012}}</ref> Although athletes can compete in both [[International Cheer Union (ICU)]] and USASF, crossovers between teams at each individual competition are not permitted. Teams compete against the other teams from their countries on the first day of competition and the top three teams from each country in each division continue to Finals. At the end of finals, the top team scoring the highest for their country earns the "Nations Cup". Canada has multiple teams across their country that compete in the USASF Cheerleading Worlds Championship.<ref>{{cite web|title=United States All Star Federation|url=http://www.usasf.net/|publisher=USASF|accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref>

The [[International Cheer Union (ICU)]] is built of 103 countries that compete against each other in four divisions; Coed Premier, All-girl Premier, Coed Elite and All-girl Elite. Canada has a national team ran by the Canadian Cheer Union (CCU). Their Coed Elite Level 5 Team and their All-girl Elite Level 5 team are 4-time world champions. They are found from all over the country. In 2013, they have added two more teams to their roster. A new division that will compete head-to-head with the United States: in both the All-girl and Coed Premier Level 6 divisions. Members tryout and are selected on the basis of their skills and potential to succeed. Athletes are selected from all over. Canada's national program has grown to be one of the most successful programs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Cheer Union|url=http://www.teamcanadacheer.com/|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref>
