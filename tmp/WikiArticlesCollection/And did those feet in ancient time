"'''And did those feet in ancient time'''" is a short poem by [[William Blake]] from the preface to his epic ''[[Milton a Poem]]'', one of a collection of writings known as the [[Blake's prophetic books|Prophetic Books]]. The date of 1804 on the title page is probably when the plates were begun, but the poem was printed c. 1808.<ref name=cocel>Cox, Michael, editor, ''The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature'', "1808", p 289, Oxford University Press, 2004, ISBN 0-19-860634-6</ref> Today it is best known as the [[anthem]] "'''Jerusalem'''", with music written by Sir [[Hubert Parry]] in 1916.

The poem was inspired by the apocryphal story that a young Jesus, accompanied by his uncle [[Joseph of Arimathea]], a tin merchant, travelled to what is now England and visited [[Glastonbury]] during the [[unknown years of Jesus]].<ref name="Icons1">Icons – a portrait of England. Icon: Jerusalem (hymn) [http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/jerusalem/features/and-did-those-feet Feature: And did those feet?] Accessed 7 August 2008</ref> The legend is linked to an idea in the [[Book of Revelation]] (3:12 and 21:2) describing a [[Second Coming]], wherein Jesus establishes a [[new Jerusalem]]. The Christian Church in general, and the [[Church of England|English Church]] in particular, has long used Jerusalem as a metaphor for [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]], a place of universal love and peace.<ref>The hymn 'Jerusalem the Golden with milk and honey blessed... I know not oh I know not what joys await me there....' uses Jerusalem for the same metaphor.</ref>

In the most common interpretation of the poem, Blake implies that a visit by Jesus would briefly create heaven in England, in contrast to the "dark Satanic Mills" of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Blake's poem asks four questions rather than asserting the historical truth of Christ's visit. Thus the poem merely implies that there may, or may not, have been a divine visit, when there was briefly heaven in England.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theoneshow/onepassions/2008/10/whats-your-anthem.html |title= '&#39;The One Show'&#39; |publisher=BBC  |date=17 October 2008 |accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/bring-no-spears-to-jerusalem-1347934.html John Walsh ''[[The Independent]]'' 18 May 1996]</ref>

'''Blake's poem'''<!-- rendered literatim per [[WP:QUOTE]]. -->
<poem>
And did those feet in ancient time.
Walk upon Englands <!-- Blake did not write "England's" --> mountains green:
And was the holy Lamb of God,
On Englands <!-- Blake did not write "England's" --> pleasant pastures seen!

And did the Countenance Divine,
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here,
Among these dark Satanic Mills?

Bring me my Bow of burning gold;
Bring me my Arrows of desire:
Bring me my Spear: O clouds unfold!
Bring me my Chariot of fire!

I will not cease from Mental Fight,
Nor shall my Sword sleep in my hand:
Till we have built Jerusalem,
In Englands <!-- Blake did not write "England's" -->green & pleasant Land<!-- This is the original text, see on the poem reproduced here -->

==="Dark Satanic Mills"===
[[File:Albion Flour Mills Bankside.jpg|thumb|Albion Flour Mills.]]
The phrase "dark Satanic Mills", which entered the English language from this poem, is often interpreted as referring to the early [[Industrial Revolution]] and its destruction of nature and human relationships.<ref>Lienhard, John H. 1999 [http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1413.htm Poets in the Industrial Revolution.] [[The Engines of Our Ingenuity]] No. 1413: (Revised transcription)</ref>

This view has been linked to the fate of the Albion Flour Mills, which was the first major factory in London. Designed by [[John Rennie the Elder|John Rennie]] and [[Samuel Wyatt]], it was built on land purchased by Wyatt in [[Southwark]]. This rotary steam-powered flour mill by [[Matthew Boulton]] and [[James Watt (inventor)|James Watt]] used grinding gears by Rennie<ref>[http://www.southbanklondon.com/walkthisway/BuildingDetails.php?building=87 Walk This Way] from southbanklondon.com. Retrieved 7 January 2011</ref> to produce 6000 [[bushel]]s of flour a week.

The factory could have driven independent traditional millers out of business, but it was destroyed in 1791 by fire, perhaps deliberately. London's independent millers celebrated with placards reading, "Success to the mills of [[Albion|ALBION]] but no Albion Mills."<ref name="ICONS1">ICONS – a portrait of England. Icon: Jerusalem (hymn) [http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/jerusalem/features/and-did-those-feet Feature: And did those feet?] Accessed 7 August 2008</ref> Opponents referred to the factory as [[satan]]ic, and accused its owners of adulterating flour and using cheap imports at the expense of British producers. A contemporary illustration of the fire shows a [[devil]] squatting on the building.<ref>Brian Maidment, ''Reading Popular Prints, 1790–1870'', Manchester University Press, 2001, p.40</ref> The mills were a short distance from Blake's home.

Blake's phrase resonates with a wider theme in his works, what he envisioned as a physically and spiritually [[Political repression|repressive]] ideology based on a quantifiable reality. Blake saw the [[cotton mill]]s and [[collieries]] of the period as a mechanism for the enslavement of millions, but the concepts underpinning the works had a wider application:<ref name="PortKaz">[[Alfred Kazin]]: ''Introduction to a volume of Blake.'' 1946</ref><ref name="HallGen">{{cite web| url= http://www.21learn.org/archive/articles/hall_genius.php|title=In Defense of Genius | last=Hall| first=Ernest| date=8 February 1996|work=Annual Lecture to the Arts Council of England|publisher=21st Century Learning Initiative|accessdate=19 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

This church preached a doctrine of conformity to the social order, in contrast to Blake. In 2007 the new Bishop of [[Durham]], [[N. T. Wright]], explicitly recognised this element of English subculture when he acknowledged this alternative view that the "dark satanic mills" refer to the "great churches".<ref name=DurhBish>[[N. T. Wright]], Bishop of Durham (23 June 2007) "[http://www.ntwrightpage.com/sermons/Durham_Wisdom.htm Where Shall Wisdom be Found?]" Homily at the 175th anniversary of the founding of the [[University of Durham]]. ntwrightpage.com</ref> [[Stonehenge]] and other megaliths are featured in ''Milton'', suggesting they may relate to the oppressive power of priestcraft in general; as [[Peter Porter (poet)|Peter Porter]] observed, many scholars argue that the "mills" "are churches and not the factories of the Industrial Revolution everyone else takes them for".<ref>Peter Porter, ''The English Poets: from Chaucer to Edward Thomas'', Secker and Warburg, 1974, p.198., quoted in Shivashankar Mishra, ''The Rise of William Blake'', Mittal Publications, 1995, p.184.</ref>
<!--[[File:Satanic mills.jpg|thumb|300px|The first reference to Satan's "mills", next to images of megaliths]]--> 
An alternative theory is that Blake is referring to a mystical concept within his own mythology related to the ancient history of England. Satan's "mills" are referred to repeatedly in the main poem, and are first described in words which suggest neither industrialism nor ancient megaliths, but rather something more abstract: "the starry Mills of Satan/ Are built beneath the earth and waters of the Mundane Shell...To Mortals thy Mills seem everything, and the Harrow of [[El Shaddai|Shaddai]] / A scheme of human conduct invisible and incomprehensible".<ref>Blake, William, ''Milton: A Poem'', plate 4.</ref>

==="Chariot of fire"===
The line from the poem "Bring me my Chariot of fire!" draws on the story of [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#2:11|2 Kings 2:11]], where the [[Old Testament]] prophet [[Elijah (prophet)|Elijah]] is taken directly to heaven: "And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven."  The phrase has become a byword for divine energy, and inspired the title of the 1981 film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''.  The plural phrase "chariots of fire" refers to 2 Kings 6:16–18.

==="Green and pleasant Land"===
Blake lived in London for most of his life, but wrote much of ''Milton'' while living in the village of [[Felpham]] in Sussex. Amanda Gilroy argues that the poem is informed by Blake's "evident pleasure" in the Felpham countryside.<ref>{{cite book| first=Amanda | last=Gilroy | title=Green and Pleasant Land: English Culture and the Romantic Countryside | publisher=Peeters Publishers | year=2004 | page=66}}</ref>

The phrase "green and pleasant land" has become a [[collocation]] for identifiably English landscape or society. It appears as a headline, title or sub-title in numerous articles and books. Sometimes it refers, whether with appreciation, nostalgia or critical analysis, to idyllic or enigmatic aspects of the English countryside.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/eric-ravilious-green-and-pleasant-land-2025022.html "Eric Ravilious: Green and Pleasant Land," by Tom Lubbock, ''The Independent,'' 13 July 2010.] Retrieved 7 January 2011</ref>  In other contexts it can suggest the perceived habits and aspirations of rural middle-class life.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/mar/06/britishidentity.features11 "This green and pleasant land," by Tim Adams, ''The Observer,'' 10 April 2005.] Retrieved 7 January 2011</ref>  Sometimes it is used ironically,<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/mar/06/britishidentity.features11 "Green and pleasant land?" by Jeremy Paxman, ''The Guardian,'' 6 March 2007.] Retrieved 7 January 2011</ref> e.g. in the [[Dire Straits]] song ''[[Iron Hand (song)|Iron Hand]]''.

===Revolution===
Several of Blake's poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: "As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)". He retained an active interest in social and political events for all his life, but was often forced to resort to cloaking social idealism and political statements in Protestant mystical [[allegory]]. Even though the poem was written during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Blake was an outspoken supporter of the [[French Revolution]], and [[Napoleon]] claimed to be continuing this revolution.<ref>[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRblake.htm William Blake] Spartacus Educational (schoolnet.co) – Accessed 7 August 2008</ref> The poem expressed his desire for radical change without overt sedition. (In 1803 Blake was charged at [[Chichester]] with high treason for having "uttered seditious and treasonable expressions", but was acquitted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/wblake.htm |title=William Blake (1757–1827)| accessdate=7 August 2008 |publisher=Kirjasto.sci.fi | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080914072308/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/wblake.htm| archivedate= 14 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>) The poem is followed in the preface by a quotation from ''[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]]'' ch. 11, v. 29: "Would to God that all the Lord's people were prophets." [[Christopher Rowland (theologian)|Christopher Rowland]], a Professor of Theology at Oxford University, has argued that this includes

<blockquote>...&nbsp;everyone in the task of speaking out about what they saw. Prophecy for Blake, however, was not a prediction of the end of the world, but telling the truth as best a person can about what he or she sees, fortified by insight and an "honest persuasion" that with personal struggle, things could be improved. A human being observes, is indignant and speaks out: it's a basic political maxim which is necessary for any age. Blake wanted to stir people from their intellectual slumbers, and the daily grind of their toil, to see that they were captivated in the grip of a culture which kept them thinking in ways which served the interests of the powerful.<ref name="Rowland">Rowland, C. 2007 [http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/arts_culture/literature/william_blake_visionary William Blake: a visionary for our time] openDemocracy.net</ref></blockquote>

The words of the poem "stress the importance of people taking responsibility for change and building a better society 'in Englands green and pleasant land.'"<ref name="Rowland"/>

The poem, which was little known during the century which followed its writing,<ref>{{cite book|url = http://www.google.com/books?id=yZvTLDOgc1EC&pg=PA236#v=onepage&q&f=false|page = 236|title = Jerusalem, Jerusalem: How the Ancient City Ignited Our Modern World|first = James|last = Carroll|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-547-19561-2|authorlink = James Carroll (novelist)}}</ref> was included in the patriotic anthology of verse ''The Spirit of Man,'' edited by the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]], [[Robert Bridges]], and published in 1916, at a time when morale had begun to decline because of the high number of casualties in World War I and the perception that there was no end in sight.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Spirit of Man: An Anthology in English & French from the Philosophers & Poets|date = January 1916|url = http://www.archive.org/stream/spiritofmanantho00bridiala#page/n5/mode/2up|chapterurl = http://www.archive.org/stream/spiritofmanantho00bridiala#page/n335/mode/2up|page = 335|publisher = Longmans, Green & Co.|accessdate =10 September 2012|editor-first = Robert|editor-last = Bridges|editor-link = Robert Bridges|chapter = Index|edition = First}}</ref>

Under these circumstances, Bridges, finding the poem an appropriate hymn text to "brace the spirit of the nation [to] accept with cheerfulnes all the sacrifices necessary,"<ref>{{cite book|url = http://www.google.com/books?id=yZvTLDOgc1EC&pg=PA235#v=onepage&q&f=false|page = 235|title = Jerusalem, Jerusalem: How the Ancient City Ignited Our Modern World|first = James|last = Carroll|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-547-19561-2|authorlink = James Carroll (novelist)}}</ref> asked Sir Hubert Parry to put it to music for a [[Fight for Right]] campaign meeting in London's [[Queen's Hall]]. (The aims of this organisation were "to brace the spirit of the nation, that the people of Great Britain, knowing that they are fighting for the best interests of humanity, may refuse any temptation, however insidious, to conclude a premature peace, and may accept with cheerfulness all the sacrifices necessary to bring the war to a satisfactory conclusion".)<ref name="Wilt">Christopher Wiltshire (Former archivist, British Federation of Festivals for Music, Speech and Dance), [http://www.guardian.co.uk/letters/story/0,3604,408355,00.html Guardian newspaper 8 December 2000 Letters: Tune into Jerusalem's fighting history] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 8 December 2000.</ref> Bridges asked Parry to supply "suitable, simple music to Blake's stanzas – music that an audience could take up and join in", and added that, if Parry could not do it himself, he might delegate the task to [[George Butterworth]].<ref>C.

The poem's idealistic [[Theme (literature)|theme]] or [[subtext]] accounts for its popularity across the philosophical spectrum. It was used as a campaign slogan by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]]; [[Clement Attlee]] said they would build "a new Jerusalem".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/tr_show01.html |title=Link to PBS script quoting Attlee in 1945 – Accessed 2008-08-07 |publisher=Pbs.org |date=24 October 1929 |accessdate=29 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110516015358/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/tr_show01.html| archivedate= 16 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It has been sung at conferences of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], at the [[Glee Club (British politics)|Glee Club]] of the British [[Liberal Assembly]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and by the [[Liberal Democrats]].

=== Parry's setting of "Jerusalem" ===
In adapting Blake's poem as a [[unison]] song, Parry deployed a two-[[stanza]] format, each taking up eight lines of Blake's original poem. He also provided a four-bar musical introduction to each verse and a [[coda (music)|coda]], echoing melodic [[motif (music)|motif]]s of the song. (The song is always performed with these 'extra' passages.) And the word "those" was substituted for "these" (before "dark satanic mills".)

The piece was to be conducted by Parry's former student [[Walford Davies]], but Parry was initially reluctant to set the words, as he had doubts about the ultra-patriotism of Fight for Right, but not wanting to disappoint either Robert Bridges or Davies he agreed, writing it on 10 March 1916, and handing the manuscript to Davies with the comment, "Here's a tune for you, old chap. Do what you like with it."<ref>Benoliel, Bernard, Parry Before Jerusalem, Ashgate, Aldershot, 1997</ref> Davies later recalled,

:"We looked at [the manuscript] together in his room at the [[Royal College of Music]], and I recall vividly his unwonted happiness over it&nbsp;... He ceased to speak, and put his finger on the note D in the second stanza where the words 'O clouds unfold' break his rhythm. I do not think any word passed about it. yet he made it perfectly clear that this was the one note and one moment of the song which he treasured&nbsp;..."<ref name="dibble">Dibble, Jeremy, C. Hubert H. Parry: His life and music, Oxford University Press, 1992</ref>

Davies arranged for the vocal score to be published by [[Curwen Press|Curwen]] in time for the concert at the [[Queen's Hall]] on 28 March and began rehearsing it.<ref name="Wilt"/> It was a success and was taken up generally.

But Parry began to have misgivings again about Fight for Right and eventually wrote to Sir [[Francis Younghusband]] withdrawing his support entirely in May 1917. There was even concern that the composer might withdraw the song, but the situation was saved by [[Millicent Garrett Fawcett]] of the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS). The song had been taken up by the Suffragettes in 1917 and Millicent Fawcett asked Parry if it might be used at a Suffrage Demonstration Concert on 13 March 1918. Parry was delighted and orchestrated the piece for the concert (it had originally been for voices and organ). After the concert, Millicent Fawcett asked the composer if it might become the Women Voters' Hymn. Parry wrote back,

:"I wish indeed it might become the Women Voters' Hymn, as you suggest. People seem to enjoy singing it. And having the vote ought to diffuse a good deal of joy. So they should combine happily."<ref name="dibble"/>

Accordingly, he assigned the copyright to the NUWSS. When that organisation was wound up in 1928, Parry's executors re-assigned the copyright to the [[Women's Institutes]], where it remained until it entered the public domain in 1968.<ref name="dibble"/>

The song was first called "And Did Those Feet in Ancient Time" and the early published scores have this title. The change to 'Jerusalem' seems to have been made about the time of the 1918 Suffrage Demonstration Concert, perhaps when the orchestral score was published (Parry's manuscript of the orchestral score has the old title crossed out and 'Jerusalem' inserted in a different hand).<ref>The manuscripts of the song with organ and with orchestra, and of Elgar's orchestration, are in the library of the Royal College of Music, London</ref>  However, Parry always referred to it by its first title. He had originally intended the first verse to be sung by a solo female voice (this is marked in the score), but this is rare in contemporary performances. Sir [[Edward Elgar]] re-scored the work for very large orchestra in 1922 for use at the [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Festival]].<ref name="ICONS2">ICONS – a portrait of England. Icon: Jerusalem (hymn) [http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/jerusalem/biography/sir-hubert-parry Sir Hubert Parry], Jerusalem and Elgar's orchestration.</ref> Elgar admired the song and would no doubt be disheartened to realise that his orchestration has overshadowed Parry's own, primarily because it is the version usually used now for the [[Last Night of the Proms]] (though, Sir [[Malcolm Sargent]], who introduced it to that event in the 1950s always used Parry's version).

Upon hearing the orchestral version for the first time, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] said that he preferred "Jerusalem" over "[[God Save the King]]", the National Anthem, and "Jerusalem" is considered to be England's most popular patriotic song; ''[[The New York Times]]'' said it was "Fast becoming an [[Proposed English National Anthems|alternative national anthem]],"<ref name="nytimes.com">{{Cite news| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/theater/20time.html?ref=arts | work=The New York Times | title=Time, and the Green and Pleasant Land | first=Ben | last=Brantley | date=20 July 2009 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref> and there have even been calls to give it official status.<ref>[http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=31408&SESSION=875 Parliamentary Early Day Motion 2791], UK Parliament, 18 October 2006</ref> England has no official anthem and so uses the British National Anthem "[[God Save the Queen]]", also an unofficial anthem, for some national occasions, such as before English international football matches. However, some sports, including [[rugby league]] use "Jerusalem" as the English anthem. "Jerusalem" is the [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]]'s official hymn,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anthem4england.co.uk/category/correspondence/ |title= Correspondence |publisher=Anthem 4 England | location = UK |date= 8 May 2007 |accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref> although "God Save the Queen" was the anthem sung before England's games in [[2010 ICC World Twenty20]] and [[2010–11 Ashes series]]. Questions in [[British Parliament|Parliament]] have not clarified the situation, as answers from the relevant minister say that since there is no official national anthem, each sport must make its own decision.

As Parliament has not clarified the situation, Team England, the English Commonwealth team held a public poll in 2010 to decide which anthem should be played at medal ceremonies to celebrate an English win at the Commonwealth Games. "Jerusalem" was selected by 52% of voters over "[[Land of Hope and Glory]]" (used since 1930) and "God Save the Queen".<ref>{{cite web|author=Sir Andrew Foster |url=http://www.weareengland.org/news.asp?itemid=327&itemTitle=England+announce+victory+anthem+for+Delhi+chosen+by+the+public%21&section=115&sectionTitle=News |title=England announce victory anthem for Delhi chosen by the public! – Commonwealth Games England |publisher=Weare England |date=30 May 2010 | accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref>

===Use as a hymn===
Although the music was composed as a unison song, "Jerusalem" has been adopted by many churches and is frequently sung as an office or recessional hymn in English cathedrals, churches and chapels on [[St George's Day]]. It is also sung in some churches on Jerusalem Sunday, a day set aside to celebrate the holy city, in [[Anglican Communion|Anglican churches]] throughout the world and even in some [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal churches]] in the United States.

However, some clergy in the Church of England, according to the [[BBC TV]] programme ''Jerusalem: An Anthem for England'', have said that the song is not technically a [[hymn]] as it is not a prayer to God (which they claim hymns always are, though many counter-examples may be found in any hymnal). Consequently, it is not sung in some churches in England.<ref>{{Cite news

Despite this, it was sung as a hymn during the [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royal-wedding/8479507/Royal-wedding-Prince-William-and-Kate-Middleton-choose-popular-hymns.html "Royal Wedding: Prince William and Kate Middleton choose popular hymns"], The Telegraph, 29 April 2011; Accessed 29 April 2011.</ref>

Parry's tune is so well liked that the song is sung not only in many schools, especially [[Public school (UK)|Public school]]s, in Great Britain (it was used as the title music for the [[BBC]]'s 1979 series 'Public School' at [[Radley College]]), and is also the hymn for several private schools in Australia, New Zealand, New England and Canada. "Jerusalem" was chosen as the opening hymn for the London Olympics 2012, although "[[God Save the Queen]]" was the anthem sung during the raising of the flag in salute to the Queen. Some attempts have also been made to increase its use elsewhere with other words. The [[Church of Scotland]] debated altering the words of the hymn to read "[[Albion]]" instead of England to make it more locally relevant.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} A widely published alternative hymn text for the tune is [[Carl P. Daw Jr.|Carl P. Daw]]'s ''O day of peace that dimly shines'' of 1982.

===Emerson, Lake & Palmer version===
In 1973, for their [[Brain Salad Surgery]] album, British progressive rock band [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]] recorded a version of the song entitled "Jerusalem". The track features the debut of the prototype Moog Apollo, the first-ever [[polyphonic synthesizer|polyphonic music synthesizer]]. The subject matter of this song indicates a nod to ELP's unabashed Englishness and simultaneously lent an air of timeless tradition and ceremony to the music. But "Jerusalem" was banned in England on the radio when it was issued as a single. The BBC would not accept it as a serious piece of music. Drummer [[Carl Palmer]] later expressed disappointment over this decision. "We wanted to put it out as a single", he said. "We figured it was worthy of a single. In England, they have this format where four or five people have to [approve it] before it gets played on the airwaves; it's a very old-fashioned way of doing it, but that's the way it was being done at the time. I think there was some apprehension [as] to whether or not we should be playing a hymn and bastardizing it, as they said, or whatever was being called at the time. ... We thought we'd done it spot-on, and I thought that was very sad because I've got a jukebox at home, and that's a piece of music that I've got on the jukebox, so I actually thought the recording and just the general performances from all of us were absolutely wonderful. I couldn't believe the small-mindedness of the English...committee to vote these things onto the radio or off the radio. They...obviously didn't even listen to this. It got banned and there was sort of quite a big thing about it, these people just would not play it. They said no, it was a hymn, and we had taken it the wrong way."{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The single failed to chart and was not released in the United States.

The popularity of Parry's setting has resulted in many hundreds of recordings being made, too numerous to list, of both traditional choral performances and new interpretations by popular music artists. Consequently only its most notable performances are listed below.

*It is sung every year by an audience of thousands at the end of the [[Last Night of the Proms]] in the [[Royal Albert Hall]] and simultaneously in the ''Proms in the Park'' venues throughout the country.

*Along with [[The Red Flag]], it is sung each year at the closing of the annual [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] conference.

*The song was used by the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (indeed it was their property until 1928, when they were wound up after women won the right to vote – see above in relation to Millicent Garret Fawcett).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=8553 |title=Link to SongFacts – Accessed 2008-08-07 |publisher=Songfacts.com |accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref> During the 1920s, many [[Women's Institutes]] (WI) started closing meetings by singing it, and this caught on nationally. Although it has never actually been adopted as the WI's official anthem, in practice it holds that position, and is an enduring element of the public image of the WI.<ref>The "Jam and ''Jerusalem''" caricature of the WI is still current enough that they have a [[FAQ]] about it on their site at [http://www.thewi.org.uk/standard.aspx?id=12466]</ref>

* The extended version of dance group the [[KLF]]'s hit single [[It's Grim Up North]] incorporates Parry's setting of the poem. 

*It is traditionally sung before [[rugby league]]'s [[Challenge Cup]] Final, along with "[[Abide with Me]]", and before the [[Super League Grand Final]], where it is introduced as "the rugby league anthem". Before 2008, it was the anthem used by the [[England national rugby league team|national side]], as "God Save the Queen" was used by [[Great Britain national rugby league team|the Great Britain team]]: since the Lions were superseded by England, "GSTQ" has replaced "Jerusalem".

*A version appears on [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]]'s album ''[[Brain Salad Surgery]]'', with a live rendition included on their ''[[Welcome Back My Friends to the Show That Never Ends... Ladies and Gentlemen]]'' album.

*[[The Waterboys]] have incorporated verses into live performances of ''Savage Earth Heart''.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG7Do74zUWI#t=7m21s The Waterboys using verses from Jerusalem]</ref>

*Since 2004, it has been the anthem of the [[England cricket team|England]] [[cricket]] team, being played before each day of their home test matches, and is regularly sung by [[rugby union]] crowds.

*A recording by the [[Grimethorpe Colliery Band]] was performed in medal ceremonies when an [[England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games|English competitor at the 2010 Commonwealth Games]] was awarded gold.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.weareengland.org/page.asp?section=210&sectionTitle=Nation+has+chosen+anthem+for+England%27s+medallists|title=Nation has chosen anthem for England's medallists: And did those feet in Ancient times walk upon England’s mountains green.....|publisher=[[Commonwealth Games England]]| quote=Now we can reveal that the anthem has been recorded for us by The Grimethorpe Colliery Band...The new official anthem of the England Team will be played for English athletes on the podium in Delhi when a Gold medal is won.|date=May/June 2010|accessdate=13 October 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101009122005/http://www.weareengland.org/page.asp?section=210&sectionTitle=Nation+has+chosen+anthem+for+England's+medallists| archivedate= 9 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{Citation| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/athletics/the-paralympian-taking-on-ablebodied-athletes-2095333.html|title=The Paralympian taking on able-bodied athletes|work=The Independent |location=London  |date=2 October 2010|accessdate=13 October 2010  | first=Simon | last=Turnbull| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101005014340/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/athletics/the-paralympian-taking-on-ablebodied-athletes-2095333.html| archivedate= 5 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

*At a concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 4 July 2009, Jeff Beck performed a version featuring his touring band at the time ([[Vinnie Colaiuta]], [[Tal Wilkenfeld]] and [[Jason Rebello]]) and a guest appearance by David Gilmour.

*While performing at Glastonbury in June 2011, U2's Bono incorporated one of the verses into their songs Where The Streets Have No Name and Bad. Whilst being interviewed after the gig, he said it was a tribute to Glastonbury's historical significance.

*It was used in the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] held in [[London]] and inspired several of the opening show segments directed by [[Danny Boyle]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Navigating the 'Isles of Wonder': A guide to the Olympic opening ceremony|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/27/sport/decoding-olympic-opening-ceremony/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref> It was included in the ceremony's [[soundtrack album]], ''[[Isles of Wonder: Music for the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games|Isles of Wonder]]''.

"Bring me my chariot of fire" inspired the title of the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''.<ref name="welland">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082158/trivia IMDb trivia – Origin of title] – Accessed 11 August 2008</ref> A church congregation sings "Jerusalem" at the close of the film and a performance appears on the ''[[Chariots of Fire (album)|Chariots of Fire soundtrack]]'' performed by the [[Ambrosian Singers]] overlaid partly by a composition by [[Vangelis]]. One unexpected touch is that "Jerusalem" is sung in four-part harmony, as if it were truly a hymn. This is not authentic: Parry's composition was a unison song (that is, all voices sing the tune – perhaps one of the things that make it so "singable" by massed crowds) and he never provided any harmonisation other than the accompaniment for organ (or orchestra). Neither does it appear in any standard hymn book in a guise other than Parry's own, so it may have been harmonised specially for the film. The film's working title was "Running" until [[Colin Welland]] saw a television programme, ''[[Songs of Praise]]'', featuring the hymn and decided to change the title.<ref name="welland" />

The hymn has featured in many other films and television programmes including ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', ''[[How to Get Ahead in Advertising]]'',''[[The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner]]'', ''[[Calendar Girls]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Goodnight Mister Tom (1998 film)|Goodnight Mr. Tom]]'', ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'', ''[[Women in Love]]'' (1969 film), ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'', ''[[Circle (Eddie Izzard)]]'' (2000 Eddie Izzard stand-up tour), ''[[Shameless (UK TV series)|Shameless]]'', and ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''. An extract was heard in the 2013 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode ''[[The Crimson Horror]]'' although that story was set in 1893 i.e. prior to Parry's arrangement. A punk version is heard in [[Derek Jarman]]'s 1977 film ''[[Jubilee (film)|Jubilee]]''. In the theatre it appears in ''[[Jerusalem (play)|Jerusalem]]'',<ref name="nytimes.com" /> ''[[Calendar Girls]]'' and in ''[[Time and the Conways]]''.<ref name="nytimes.com" /> Punk band [[Bad religion|Bad Religion]] have borrowed the opening line of Blake's poem in their song "God Song", from the 1990 album ''[[Against the Grain (Bad Religion album)|Against the Grain]]''.  In  2005 [[BBC Four]] produced ''Jerusalem – An Anthem For England'' highlighting the various usages of the song/poem and a convincing and sentimental case was made for its adoption as the [[national anthem of England]]. Varied contributions come from [[Howard Goodall]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Gary Bushell]], [[Lord Hattersley]], [[Ann Widdecombe]] and [[David Mellor]], [[Militarism|war proponents]], [[pacifism|war opponents]], [[suffragettes]], [[trade unionists]], [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public schoolboys]], the [[Tories]], [[New Labour]], [[Football Supporters' Federation|football supporters]], the [[British National Party]], the [[Women%27s_Institute#.22Jerusalem.22|Women's Institute]], [[London Gay Men's Chorus|a gay choir]], [[London Community Gospel Choir|a gospel choir]], [[Fat Les]] and [[Naturists#United_Kingdom|naturists]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1071222/ | title=Jerusalem: An Anthem for England (TV 2005) | publisher=[[IMDb]] | accessdate=27 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/sep/09/broadcasting.tvandradio | title=Get me to the clink on time |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=9 September 2005 | accessdate=28 September 2011 | author=Sam Wollaston}}</ref>In ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'', Jez, played by [[Robert Webb]] makes a track called 'This is Outrageous' which uses the first and a version of the second line in a verse.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySqtuxadnn4</ref>

Blake's lyrics have also been set to music by other composers without reference to Parry's melody. [[Tim Blake]] (synthesiser player of [[Gong (band)|Gong]]) produced a solo album in 1978 called ''[[Blake's New Jerusalem]]'', including a 20 minute track with lyrics from Blake's poem. The words, with some variations, are used in the track "Jerusalem" on [[Bruce Dickinson]]'s album ''[[The Chemical Wedding (Bruce Dickinson album)|The Chemical Wedding]]'', which also includes lines from book two of ''Milton''. [[Finn Coren]] also created a different musical setting for the poem on his album ''[[The Blake Project: Spring]]''.
