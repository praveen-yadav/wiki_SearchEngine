'''Bayonne''' ({{IPA-fr|bajɔn}}; [[Gascon dialect|Gascon]] ''Baiona'' {{IPA-oc|baˈjunɔ|}}; {{lang-eu|Baiona}} {{IPA-eu|baiona|}}; {{lang-es|Bayona}}) is a city and [[Communes of France|commune]] in southwestern France at the confluence of the [[Nive]] and [[Adour]] rivers, in the [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]] [[Departments of France|department]], of which it is a [[Subprefectures in France|sub-prefecture]]. It belongs to both [[Cultural region|vernacular cultural regions]] of [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] and [[Gascony]].

Together with nearby [[Anglet]], [[Biarritz]], [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]], and several smaller communes, Bayonne forms an urban area with 178,965 inhabitants at the 1999 census, 40,078 of whom lived in the city of Bayonne proper (44,300 as of 2004 estimates).

The communes of Bayonne, Biarritz, and Anglet have joined into an [[Communes of France#Intercommunality|intercommunal]] entity called the ''Agglomération Côte Basque-Adour'' (formerly ''Communauté d'agglomération de Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz (BAB)'' prior to 2010).<ref>[http://www.pyrenees-atlantiques.territorial.gouv.fr/actes3/files/fichieracte6898.pdf Prefectural order of 28/12/2010, extending the boundaries, modifying the bylaws, and changing the designation of CABAB]</ref>

==History==
In the 3rd century AD, the area was the site of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ''[[castrum]]'' called ''Lapurdum'', which was a military site, but not a port. In 840 the [[Vikings]] appeared before Lapurdum; in 842, Viking chieftain [[Björn Ironside]] and his troops launched a large-scale inland offensive and settled outside the city on the river bank.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Lapurdum was an ''[[oppidum]]'' and they needed a port. Bayonne (from Basque ''ibai'', "river") became a key place on the route between the Adour and [[Ebro]] rivers, which served as a kind of link between the Atlantic Ocean and the [[Mediterranean Sea]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} This commercial route was the main goal of Danish invaders in France. By this route, they could easily reach Muslim-controlled [[Tortosa]], which was the main marketplace in Europe dealing with slaves.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

By the 13th century, the city was an important port, with a [[Gascony|Gascon]] and [[Basque people|Basque]] population. As part of [[Aquitaine]], it was ruled by England between 1151 to 1452 and was a key commercial center at the southern end of the English kingdom.

Its importance waned somewhat when the French king, [[Charles VII of France|Charles&nbsp;VII]], took the city at the end of the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the Adour changed course shortly afterwards, leaving Bayonne without its access to the sea. The French, however, realised Bayonne's strategic site near the Spanish border and in 1578 dug a canal to again redirect the river through the city.

Bayonne endured numerous [[siege]]s from [[Plantagenet]] times until the end of the [[First French Empire]] in 1814. In the 17th century, [[Vauban]] built large fortifications and the [[Citadel]]le in and around the city. These proved crucial in 1813 and 1814, when [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]'s army besieged the city in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], only taking it when they used a bridge of ships across the Adour to position artillery around the city.

Bayonne's location close to the border, but also within the Basque Country straddling both France and Spain, gave it an often privileged position in commerce. Basque sailors travelled the world, bringing back products such as [[cinnamon]] and riches from piracy and the whaling and cod trades. An armaments industry developed, giving the world the "[[bayonet]]". Jewish refugees from the [[Spanish Inquisition]] from 1560 brought new trades, most notably chocolate-making, which is still important in Bayonne. Spanish Basques also sought refuge in Bayonne in the 20th century during [[Francisco Franco]]'s repression, with Petit Bayonne still a centre of [[Basque nationalism]].
[[File:Bayonne.JPG|right|thumb|Petit Bayonne, a view across the [[Nive]] River]]
By the mid-19th century, Bayonne had declined somewhat with the centralisation of power to Paris and to the new ''[[Départements of France|département]]'' capital, non-Basque [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], after the 1789 [[French Revolution]], and with Wellington's bombardment. However, rail links with Paris from 1854 and the growing importance of nearby Biarritz as a tourist centre brought industrialisation and development. Bayonne is now part of 'BAB' (Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz), a metropolitan area of almost 200,000 people.

==Main sights==
The Nive divides Bayonne into [[Grand Bayonne]] and [[Petit Bayonne]], with five bridges between the two, both quarters still backed by Vauban's walls. The houses lining the Nive are examples of Basque architecture, with half-timbering and shutters in the national colours of red and green. The much wider Adour is to the north. The Pont Saint-Esprit connects Petit Bayonne with the Quartier Saint-Esprit across the [[Adour]], where the massive Citadelle and the railway station are located. Grand Bayonne is the commercial and civic hub, with small pedestrianised streets packed with shops, plus the cathedral and [[City and town halls|Hôtel de Ville]].

The [[Bayonne Cathedral|Cathédrale Sainte-Marie]] is an imposing, elegant [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building, rising over the houses, glimpsed along the narrow streets. It was constructed in the 12th and 13th centuries. The south tower was completed in the 16th century but the cathedral was only completed in the 19th century with the north tower. The cathedral is noted for its charming [[cloister]]s. There are other details and sculptures of note, although much was destroyed in the [[French Revolution|Revolution]].

Nearby is the Château Vieux, some of which dates back to the 12th century, where the governors of the city were based, including the English [[Edward, the Black Prince|Black Prince]].

The Musée Basque is the finest ethnographic museum of the entire Basque Country. It opened in 1922 but has been closed for a decade recently for refurbishment. It now has special exhibitions on Basque agriculture, seafaring and ''[[Basque pelota|pelota]]'', handicrafts and Basque history and way of life.

The [[Musée Bonnat]] began with a large collection bequeathed by the local-born painter [[Léon Bonnat]]. The museum is one of the best galleries in south west France and has paintings by [[Edgar Degas]], [[El Greco]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], and [[Francisco Goya]], among others.

At the back of Petit Bayonne is the Château Neuf, among the ramparts. Now an exhibition space, it was started by the newly arrived French in 1460 to control the city. The walls nearby have been opened to visitors. They are important for plant life now and Bayonne's [[Jardin botanique de Bayonne|botanic gardens]] adjoin the walls on both sides of the Nive.

The area across the Adour is largely residential and industrial, with much demolished to make way for the railway. The Saint-Esprit church was part of a bigger complex built by [[Louis XI of France|Louis&nbsp;XI]] to care for [[Way of St James|pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela]]. It is home to a wooden ''Flight into Egypt'' sculpture.

Overlooking the quarter is Vauban's 1680 Citadelle. The soldiers of Wellington's army who died besieging the citadelle in 1813 are buried in the nearby English Cemetery, visited by [[Queen Victoria]] and other British dignitaries when staying in [[Biarritz]].

The distillery of the famous local liqueur [[Izarra (liqueur)|Izarra]] is located on the northern bank of the Adour and is open to visitors.

==Culture and sport==
Bayonne has the longest tradition of [[bull-fighting]] in France and there is a ring beyond the walls of Grand Bayonne. The season runs between July and September.
Bull-fighting is part of the five-day [[Fêtes de Bayonne]] which starts on the first Wednesday of August and attracts people from across the Basque Country and beyond. Parades, music, dance, fireworks, food, and drink all feature in the celebrations. Soon after the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] festival of 15 August heralds a few more days of bull-fights.

There are also important festivals of Jazz (July), [[Bayonne ham]] ([[Holy Week]]), theatre and ''pelota'' (the Basque sport).

[[Aviron Bayonnais]] is the city's [[rugby union]] club, founded in 1904 and French champions three times, in 1913, 1934, and 1943. The local [[association football|football]] team is [[Aviron Bayonnais FC]].

[[Basque language|Basque]] is the main language spoken in this city, together with French.

==Economy and products==
Bayonne is known for its fine chocolates, produced in the town for 500 years, and Bayonne ham, a cured ham seasoned with peppers from nearby [[Espelette]]. [[Izarra (liqueur)|Izarra]], the liqueur made in bright green or yellow colours, is distilled locally. It is said by some that Bayonne is the birthplace of [[mayonnaise]], supposedly a corruption of ''Bayonnaise'', the French adjective describing the city's people and produce. Now bayonnaise can refer to a particular mayonnaise flavoured with the Espelette chillis.

Bayonne is now the centre of certain craft industries that were once widespread, including the manufacture of ''[[makila]]s'', traditional Basque walking-sticks. The Fabrique Alza just outside the city is known for its ''palas'', bats used in ''[[Basque pelota|pelota]]'', the traditional Basque sport.

As of 1935, its chief industries were shipbuilding, [[tanning]] and pottery.
In the late 20th century, the processing of by-products from the [[Lacq]] natural gas field near Pau became important, although Bayonne has had higher-than-average unemployment. [[Metallurgy]] also provides local jobs.

==Transport==
The [[Gare de Bayonne]] is on the high-speed [[TGV]] line between Paris and [[Hendaye]] for connections with Spain. In practice, the line slows considerably beyond [[Bordeaux]] although there are plans to improve the service. There are regional rail services along the Basque coast, to Pau and through the [[Landes (department)|Landes]] to [[Dax, Landes|Dax]] and Bordeaux. There is a line along the Nive valley through Labourd and [[Lower Navarre]] to [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port]], used principally by tourists and hikers.

There are extensive bus connections with Biarritz, Anglet and surrounding villages. The city is near the intersection between the [[A63 autoroute]] between Bordeaux and the Spanish border and the [[A64 autoroute|A64]] from Bayonne to [[Toulouse]].

Bayonne's airport is [[Aéroport de Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne]] {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the city towards [[Anglet]] and is shared with [[Biarritz]] and Anglet.

The city bus system is called [http://www.bus-stab.com/ STAB], ''Transports Urbains de l'agglomération de Bayonne''.

Bayonne harbour is a stop over for yachts and boats crossing the [[Gulf of Biscay]] on their way from the UK to the Iberian Peninsula, the Atlantic, or the Mediterranean.
