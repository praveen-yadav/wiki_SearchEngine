[[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s Opus 1 is a set of three [[piano trio]]s (written for [[piano]], [[violin]], and [[cello|violoncello]]), first performed in 1793 in the house of [[Karl Alois Johann-Nepomuk Vinzenz, FÃ¼rst Lichnowsky|Prince Lichnowsky]], to whom they are dedicated.<ref>[http://www.all-about-beethoven.com/trios.html Beethoven's Trios for string instruments, wind instruments and for mixed ones.] All About Beethoven. Retrieved 2011-12-10</ref> The trios were published in 1795.

Despite the Op. 1 designation these were not Beethoven's first published compositions; this 
distinction belongs to his [[Ludwig van Beethoven#Background and early life|''Dressler Variations'' for keyboard (WoO 63)]].
