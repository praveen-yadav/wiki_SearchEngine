{{For|the Christian martyr|Aedesius of Alexandria}}
'''Aedesius ''' ({{lang-grc|Αἰδέσιος}}, died 355) was a [[Neo-Platonism|Neoplatonist]] philosopher and mystic born of a noble [[Cappadocia]]n family.

==Career==
Aedesius was born into a wealthy [[Cappadocia]]n<ref>Cappadocia: A region in central Turkey, largely in Nevşehir Province.</ref> family, but he moved to [[Syria]] where he was apprenticed to [[Iamblichos]]. He quickly became his best pupil and the two became friends. Aedesius' own philosophical doctrine, however, was somewhere between [[Platonism]] and [[eclecticism]]. After his teacher's death, he distanced himself from philosophy, probably because he feared the hostile attitude of the Christian emperor [[Constantine the Great]] towards the practice of philosophy. His students nevertheless succeeded to convince him to devote himself again to philosophy. He moved to [[Pergamon]], where he became a teacher. None of his writings have survived, but there is an extant biography by [[Eunapius]], a Greek sophist and historian of the 4th century who wrote a collection of biographies entitled ''Lives of the Sophists'''''.'''

He migrated to [[Syria]], attracted by the lectures of [[Iamblichus (philosopher)|Iamblichus]], of whom he became a follower. According to [[Eunapius]], he differed from Iamblichus on certain points connected with [[theurgy]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].  After the death of his master the school of Syria was dispersed, and Aedesius seems to have modified his doctrines out of fear of [[Constantine II of the Roman Empire|Constantine]], and took refuge in [[divination]].<ref>{{Citation

An oracle in [[hexameter]] verse represented a pastoral life as his only retreat, but his disciples, perhaps calming his fears by a metaphorical interpretation, compelled him to resume his instructions.  

He settled at [[Pergamum]], where he numbered among his pupils [[Eusebius of Myndus]], [[Maximus of Ephesus]], and the emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]]. After the accession of the latter to the imperial purple he invited Aedesius to continue his instructions, but the declining strength of the sage being unequal to the task, two of his most learned disciples, [[Chrysanthius]] and the aforementioned Eusebius, were by his own desire appointed to supply his place.<ref>Eunapius, ''Vita Aedesius''</ref>

== School of philosophy at Pergamon ==
Aedesius founded a school of philosophy at Pergamon, which emphasized [[theurgy]] and the revival of [[polytheism]]. The later emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] was one of his many students. After he became emperor, he invited Aedesius to further educate him. By this time Aedesius was however too old and too weak and he personally appointed two of his most talented followers, Chrysantes and Eusebius, to take his place. Another of his followers was Maximus of Ephesus.
