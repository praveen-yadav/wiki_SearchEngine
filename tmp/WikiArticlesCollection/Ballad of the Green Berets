'''"The Ballad of the Green Berets"''' is a patriotic song in the [[ballad (music)|ballad]] style about the [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Berets]], an elite [[Special Operations Forces|special force]] in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. It is one of the very few songs of the 1960s to cast the military in a positive light, yet in 1966 it became a major hit, reaching No. 1 for five weeks on the [[Hot 100]] and four weeks on [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]. It was also a crossover smash, reaching No. 1 on ''Billboard's'' Easy Listening chart and No. 2 on ''Billboard's'' Country survey.

The song was written by [[Robin Moore]] and [[Staff Sergeant|Staff Sgt.]] [[Barry Sadler]], while the latter was recuperating from a leg wound suffered as a medic in the [[Vietnam War]]. Moore also wrote a [[non-fiction]] book, ''[[The Green Berets (book)|The Green Berets]]'', about the force. Lyrics include:

{{quote|
''"Back at home a young wife waits<br>
''Her Green Beret has met his fate<br>
''He has died for those oppressed<br>
''Leaving her this last request<br>

''Put silver wings on my son's chest<br>
''Make him one of America's best<br>
''He'll be a man they'll test one day<br>
''Have him win the Green Beret"}}

The lyrics were written in honor of Green Beret James Gabriel, Jr., the first [[native Hawaiian]] who died in Vietnam, who was executed by the Viet Cong while on a training mission on April 8, 1962.<ref>{{cite web| last=Mizutani | first=Ron | title=First Native Hawaiian Killed in Vietnam Conflict Honored | date=May 18, 2010 | work=KHON2.com | publisher=[[KHON-TV]] | url=http://www.khon2.com/content/news/developingstories/story/First-Native-Hawaiian-Killed-in-Vietnam-Conflict/iSrtWYe-DEmrkW4dYH_m2Q.cspx | accessdate=March 12, 2011}}</ref>  One verse was written in honor of Gabriel, but it never made it into the final version.<ref>''I'm a Lucky One'' by Staff Sgt. Barry Sadler (Macmillan 1967, pp.&nbsp;80–81)</ref>

Sadler debuted the song on television on January 30, 1966 on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.

==Popularity==
The song was the No. 1 hit in the U.S. for the five weeks encompassing March 1966 and the No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100's end of the year chart for 1966, despite the competing "[[California Dreaming]]", sharply dividing the popular music market, and the No. 21 song of the 1960s, even though [[United States Army Special Forces in popular culture|the Vietnam War later became unpopular]].  The rivalry between "Green Berets" and "California Dreaming" was so fierce that the two records tied for the No. 1 record of 1966, according to ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]''.  "Green Berets" has sold over nine million singles and albums and was the top single of a year in which the [[British Invasion]], led by [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]], continued to dominate the U.S. charts.  For comparison, according to ''Billboard'', The Beatles' top hit in 1966 was "We Can Work It Out" (No. 16), while the Stones' top hit in 1966 was "[[Paint It, Black]]" (No. 21). 

"Green Berets" is currently used as one of the four primary [[marching band|marching tunes]] of the [[Fightin' Texas Aggie Band]].

==In film==
The song is heard in a choral rendition by [[Ken Darby]] in the 1968 [[John Wayne]] film, ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'', based on Moore's book. The score of the movie was never released as an album until ''[[Film Score Monthly]]'' released it in 2005.  A film [[tie-in]] featuring artwork from the film and a [[cover version]] by [[Ennio Morricone]] was released in Europe, though the other tracks on the album were soundtracks from ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' and ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]''.

The song appears in the films ''[[More American Graffiti]]'' and ''[[Canadian Bacon]]''. It can be heard in the gun show scene from the 2002 film ''[[Showtime (film)|Showtime]]'', and in the film ''[[Jesus' Son]]'', in a scene that features a hitch-hiking [[Jack Black]].

A vinyl copy of "The Ballad of the Green Berets" makes a brief appearance in "[[The Simpsons]]" episode "[[Homer's Phobia]]", from the show's eighth season.  Guest star and filmmaker [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] is seen, near the five minute mark, flipping through Homer and Marge's record collection; Sadler's hit is amongst them.

Also, briefly sung by Bill Murray in "Caddyshack" during his nighttime attempt to kill the gopher.

==Covers and derivatives==
Many American [[cover version]]s of the song appeared recorded by artists ranging from [[Kate Smith]] and [[Duane Eddy]] to unknown artists singing on various [[drugstore records]].

The punk band The F.U's performed a cover of the song, featured on the album This Is Boston, Not L.A.

Many cover versions are in different languages rewritten to reference local units; these include:
*A German version ('''Hundert Mann und ein Befehl'''), sung by [[Freddy Quinn]] and later again by [[Heidi Brühl]] had considerable success in [[Germany]]. The German version is a song '''against''' the war. It rejects any sacrifice, not only for the son, but for the father as well. [[Freddy Quinn]] sings the song from the point of view of the reluctant but forced soldier{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, Heidi Bruhl from the point of view of the crying girlfriend of the soldier.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Freddy Quinn's version was later cover by [[Welle: Erdball]] and also by [[Cryptic Wintermoon]].

*The Royal Netherlands Army's [[Korps Commandotroepen]] (KCT) use the original lyrics. The only difference is that in the chorus, instead of singing "''These are men, America's best''", they sing "''These are men, The Netherlands' best''". Also in the final chorus, referring to the son of a deceased Green Beret, they sing "''Make him one of The Netherlands' best''". This version of the original ballad is sung to recruits who have successfully completed the harsh Basic Commando Training (ECO), and who receive their Green Beret.

*[[Rhodesian]] singer-songwriter [[John Edmond]] recorded the "Ballad of the Green Berets" with reference to the soldiers of the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] (RLI), commando-style [[fireforce]] units of Rhodesian Security Forces who wore [[berets]] of [[green]] [[color]]. A "Ballad of the Red Beret" was sung by the Rhodesian Ministry of Internal Affairs at their battlecamp in [[Chikurubi]]. In [[South Africa]], the "Ballad of the Green Berets" was recorded as the "Ballad of the Maroon Berets". The [[Maroon beret]] is a symbol of the [[South African Special Forces Brigade]] and the [[South African 44 Parachute Regiment]]. Also this song was re-recorded by South African opera singer Leonore Veenemans as "My Land Suid-Afrika".

* The Swedish version "Balladen om den blå baskern" is a salute to the Swedish soldiers serving in the United Nations' peace-keeping forces (the Blue Berets). It was sung by [[Anita Lindblom]].

*The Croatian [[Special Operations Battalion (Croatia)|Bojna za specijalna djelovanja]] (BSD) use the lyrics, but instead of "''These are men, America's best''" they sing "''These are men, Croatia's best''" and in the final chorus, referring to the son of a killed Green Beret, they also sing "''Make him one of Croatia's best''". It is unclear when exactly is the song first sung by new recruits, but it is assumed to be sometime after completing training.

*The Italian version is called '''La Ballata del Soldato''', sung by [[Quartetto Cetra]].
* In the [[Swiss Armed Forces]], the Infantry Officer's School uses a [[Languages of Switzerland|quadrlingual]] version (named The [[Infantry]] Ballad) of the song as their anthem, in salute to the bonds created by the very harsh training undertaken by the cadets as well as to the sense of duty (and their motto, [[Exemplo Ducemus]]) they vow to respect. It is sung everyday onwards to the morning [[role call]], before the [[National anthem of Switzerland|National Anthem]].

==Parodies==
*In 1968, '''The Beach Bums''', an ad hoc group featuring a young [[Bob Seger]], recorded "The Ballad of the Yellow Beret". The song was a send-up of "The Ballad of the Green Berets", chronicling the adventures of a [[draft dodger]].  The record was withdrawn after a [[cease and desist]] letter from Sadler.
*[[The Residents]] parodied the song on their ''[[Third Reich & Roll]]'' album.
*Another parody was used on the episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' [[William Shatner]] hosted in 1986, called "Ollie North, The Mute Marine." Shatner participated in the sketch, outfitted in a USMC Class A uniform, which was a satire of [[Oliver North]] and his refusal at that point to speak up about his participation in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]], and in which he had no lines.
*The song is used to humorous effect in [[Michael Moore]]'s film ''[[Canadian Bacon (film)|Canadian Bacon]]'' as ill-informed Americans prepare for an invasion by [[Canada]].
* In the movie ''[[Wag the Dog]]'', the fictitious unit 303 Special Forces has a song created titled "The Men of the 303" that is played to a deliberately similar but original tune written by Huey Lewis for the film.
* In the film ''[[Caddyshack]],'' Carl Spackler, played by [[Bill Murray]], mumbles the song under his breath while he is connecting the wires to the plunger as he prepares for his final battle with his [[gopher (animal)|gopher]] nemesis.
* Comedian Paul Shanklin parodied the song with "Ballad of the Black Beret", referring to the Clinton sex scandal, on his 1999 album ''[[Simply Reprehensible]]''.
* Though its usage here is not a parody, in an episode of ''[[Cheers]],'' Cliff aborts his plans to emigrate to Canada with his love interest when Sam, Woody, and Frasier appeal to his patriotic side by singing this song.
