'''Chaosium''' is one of the longer lived publishers of [[role-playing game]]s still in existence. Founded by [[Greg Stafford]], its first game was actually a wargame, ''[[White Bear and Red Moon]]'', which later mutated into ''[[Dragon Pass]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Nomad Gods]]''.  ''White Bear and Red Moon'' is notable for containing the first published material about [[Glorantha]], later used as the primary setting for the role-playing games ''[[RuneQuest]]'', ''[[Hero Wars]]'' and ''[[HeroQuest (role-playing game)|HeroQuest]]''. Chaosium is the publisher of [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]], based on the stories of [[H.P. Lovecraft]].

== Background ==

The rules of ''RuneQuest'', Chaosium's first role-playing game, were distilled down into a generic, genre-neutral format known as ''[[Basic Role-Playing]]'' (''BRP'').  These generic rules formed the basis of many of Chaosium's later RPGs, such as ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', ''[[Stormbringer (role-playing game)|Stormbringer]]'', ''[[Nephilim (RPG)|Nephilim]]'', and ''[[RingworldRPG|Ringworld]]''.

Chaosium and [[Greg Stafford]] are also responsible for ''[[Pendragon RPG|Pendragon]]'', an Arthurian RPG now published by [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf, Inc.'s]] ArtHaus imprint after a spell with [[Green Knight Publishing]]. Other games of note include ''[[Mythos (role-playing game)|Mythos]]'', ''[[Elfquest]]'', ''[[Worlds of Wonder (game)|Worlds of Wonder]]'', ''[[Superworld]]'', ''[[Hawkmoon]]'', ''[[Stormbringer]]'', and the frequently forgotten ''[[Prince Valiant: The Story-Telling Game]]''.

Several notable RPG authors have written material for Chaosium, including [[Steve Perrin]], [[Sandy Petersen]], [[Lynn Willis]], [[Keith Herber]], [[David Conyers]], [[Ken St. Andre]], and [[Arduin]] creator [[David A. Hargrave]].

== Magazines ==

Three [[magazine]]s, until recently all of them defunct, had been published by Chaosium to promote its products:

* ''[[Wyrm's Footnotes]]'' ran for fourteen issues from 1976 to 1995. Initially it was a supporting material publication for ''White Bear and Red Moon'' but for its 11th issue, in 1981, it had become the official ''RuneQuest'' magazine.<ref>[http://www.erzo.org/shannon/gaming/indices/glorantha-index.shtml#wyrms ''Wyrm's Footnotes'' review, by Shannon Appelcline]</ref>The magazine was revived in 2012 by [[Moon Design Publications]], continuing the issue numbering at 15, despite the 17 year hiatus.
* ''[[Different Worlds]]''. Forty-seven bimonthly issues from ''Different Worlds'' were published. Chaosium, from 1979 to 1985, published the thirty-eight first ones and [[Sleuth Publications]], from 1985 to 1987, the nine last ones. In spite of being an old Chaosium's and Stafford's collaborator, [[Tadashi Ehara]] was the editor of the magazine during the periods concerned by both publishing houses.<ref>[http://index.rpg.net/display-search.phtml?key=magazine&value=Different+Worlds&type=pictures Main ''Different Worlds'' issues, every one of them listed and linked to its own description page]</ref>
* ''[[Starry Wisdom]]'', a [[H.P. Lovecraft|Lovecraft]] themed magazine, three issues of which Chaosium published in 1997.<ref>[http://www.chaosium.com/chaosium/starry-wisdom/index.shtml ''Starry Wisdom'' description page in Chaosium's official website]</ref>

== Distribution ==

Some Chaosium products have been translated into [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], and were available in [[France]] from [[Jeux Descartes]], in [[Germany]] from [[Pegasus Press]], in [[Spain]] from [[Joc Internacional]] and [[La factor√≠a de ideas]] and in [[Italy]] from ''Stratelibri'' and ''Grifo Edizioni''.

In the mid-1980s, Chaosium entered into a complex arrangement with [[Avalon Hill]] to publish ''RuneQuest'' material while Chaosium maintained editorial control over Glorantha-based material for the game (which Avalon Hill would publish).  While this agreement reportedly kept the company in existence, it also left ''RuneQuest'' moribund, leading to products of questionable quality, long gaps with no products published at all, and, eventually, the death of the game altogether.

== Failed ventures/New directions ==

In response to [[collectible card game]]s' popularity after the emergence of [[Magic: The Gathering]], Chaosium released the now discontinued ''[[Mythos (card game)|Mythos]]'' CCG.

In the late 1990s, Chaosium effectively split up into various successor companies, each maintaining its focus on a few of the company's products. [[Green Knight Publishing]] formed to focus on ''Pendragon'', Chaosium "proper" retained ''Call of Cthulhu'', ''Stormbringer'', and ''Mythos'', while Greg Stafford (who left Chaosium in 1998) founded [[Issaries, Inc.]] to publish ''[[HeroQuest (role-playing game)|HeroQuest]]'' and focus on bringing new ''[[Glorantha]]'' related material into print. Also, [[Wizard's Attic]] (no longer in business) was formed in order to act as a [[fulfillment house]].

Chaosium continues to release roleplaying supplements for it's Call of Cthulhu and BRP product lines. In 2012, Cthulhu by Gaslight won two Ennie awards at GenCon Indian;, Gold for Best Supplement and Silver for Best Cover Art.<ref>http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/congratulations-to-the-2012-ennie-award-winners/</ref> Later that year Cthulhu by Gaslight also won the Diehard GameFAN award for Best Re-Make/Re-release. Mythic Iceland by Pedro Ziviani won the Diehard GameFan award for Best Campaign Setting.<ref>http://diehardgamefan.com/2013/01/11/diehard-gamefans-2012-tabletop-gaming-awards/</ref> Chaosium successfully funded a kickstarter for a re-release of the box-set campaign, Horror on the Orient Express.<ref>http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/448333182/horror-on-the-orient-express-a-chaosium-publicatio</ref> In 2013 Chaosium returned to Fantasy Roleplaying with its release of a new edition of Magic World.<ref>http://catalog.chaosium.com/product_info.php?products_id=6878</ref>
