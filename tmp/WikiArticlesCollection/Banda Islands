[[File:Banda Islands en.png|thumb|250px|Map of the Banda Islands]]

The '''Banda Islands''' ({{lang-id|Kepulauan Banda}}) are a [[volcanic group]] of ten small [[volcanic island]]s in the [[Banda Sea]], about {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Seram Island]] and about {{convert|2000|km|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Java (island)|Java]], and are part of the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[Maluku (Indonesian province)|Maluku]]. The main town and administrative centre is [[Bandanaira]], located on the island of the same name. They rise out of 4–6&nbsp;km deep ocean and have a total land area of approximately 180&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. They have a population of about 15,000.  Until the mid-19th century the Banda Islands were the world's only source of the spices [[nutmeg]] and [[mace (spice)|mace]], produced from the nutmeg tree. The islands are also popular destinations for [[scuba diving]] and [[snorkeling]].

== History ==

===Pre-European history===
Before the arrival of Europeans, Banda had an [[oligarchic]] form of government led by ''orang kaya'' ('rich men') and the Bandanese had an active and independent role in trade throughout the archipelago.<ref name="RICKLEFSp24">{{cite book| last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition  | publisher =MacMillan  | year =1991  | location =London  | page =24  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-333-57689-6 }}</ref> Banda was the world's only source of [[nutmeg]] and [[mace (spice)|mace]], spices used as flavourings, medicines, and preserving agents that were at the time highly valued in European markets. They were sold by [[Arab]] traders to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]s for exorbitant prices. The traders did not divulge the exact location of their source and no European was able to deduce their location.

The first written accounts of Banda are in ''Suma Oriental'', a book written by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[apothecary]] [[Tomé Pires]] who was based in [[Malacca]] from 1512 to 1515 but visited Banda several times. On his first visit, he interviewed the Portuguese and the far more knowledgeable Malay sailors in Malacca. He estimated the early sixteenth century population to be 2500-3000. He reported the Bandanese as being part of an Indonesia-wide trading network and the only native Malukan long-range traders taking cargo to Malacca, although shipments from Banda were also being made by [[Javanese people|Javanese]] traders.

In addition to the production of nutmeg and mace, Banda maintained significant entrepot trade; goods that moved through Banda included cloves from [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]] in the north, [[Birds of Paradise|bird of paradise]] feathers from the [[Aru Islands]] and western [[New Guinea]], ''massoi'' bark for traditional medicines, and slaves. In exchange, Banda predominantly received rice and cloth; namely light cotton ''[[batik]]'' from [[Java]], ''[[Calico (textile)|calicoes]]'' from [[India]] and ''[[ikat]]'' from the [[Lesser Sundas]].  In 1603, an average quality ''[[sarong]]''-sized cloth traded for eighteen kilograms of nutmeg.  Some of these textiles were then on-sold, ending up in [[Halmahera]] and [[New Guinea]].  Coarser ''ikat'' from the Lesser Sundas was traded for [[sago]] from the [[Kei Islands]], [[Aru Islands|Aru]] and [[Seram]].

===Portuguese===
In August 1511 on behalf of the king of [[Portugal]], [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Malacca]], which at the time was the hub of Asian trade. In November of that year, after having secured Malacca and learning of the Bandas' location, Albuquerque sent an expedition of three ships led by his good friend [[António de Abreu]] to find them. [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] pilots, either recruited or forcibly conscripted, guided them via [[Java]], the [[Lesser Sundas]] and [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] to Banda, arriving in early 1512.<ref>Hannard (1991), page 7; {{cite book  | last =Milton  | first =Giles  | authorlink =Giles Milton  | coauthors =  | title =Nathaniel's Nutmeg  | publisher =Sceptre  | year =1999  | location =London  | pages =5 and 7  | isbn = 978-0-340-69676-7 }}</ref> The first Europeans to reach the Bandas, the expedition remained in Banda for about one month, purchasing and filling their ships with Banda's nutmeg and mace, and with [[clove]]s in which Banda had a thriving [[entrepôt]] trade.<ref name="HANNARDp7">Hannard (1991), page 7</ref> D'Abreu sailed through [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] while his second in command [[Francisco Serrão]] went ahead towards the Maluku islands, was shipwrecked and ended up in [[Ternate]].<ref name="RICKLEFSp25"/> Distracted by hostilities elsewhere in the archipelago, such as Ambon and Ternate, the Portuguese did not return until 1529; a Portuguese trader Captain Garcia landed troops in the Bandas. Five of the Banda islands were within gunshot of each other and he realised that a fort on the main island Neira would give him full control of the group. The Bandanese were, however, hostile to such a plan, and their warlike antics were both costly and tiresome to Garcia whose men were attacked when they attempted to build a fort. From then on, the Portuguese were infrequent visitors to the islands preferring to buy their nutmeg from traders in Malacca.<ref>{{cite book  | last =Milton  | first =Giles  | authorlink =Giles Milton  | coauthors =  | title =Nathaniel's Nutmeg  | publisher =Sceptre  | year =1999  | location =London  | pages =5 and 7  | isbn = 978-0-340-69676-7 }}</ref>

Unlike other eastern Indonesian islands, such as [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], [[Solor]], [[Ternate]] and [[Morotai]], the Bandanese displayed no enthusiasm for Christianity or the Europeans who brought it in the sixteenth century, and no serious attempt was made to Christianise the Bandanese.<ref name="RICKLEFSp25">{{cite book  | last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition  | publisher =MacMillan  | year =1993  | location =London  | page =25  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-333-57689-6 }}</ref> Maintaining their independence, the Bandanese never allowed the Portuguese to build a fort or a permanent post in the islands. Ironically though, it was this lack of ports which brought the Dutch to trade at Banda instead of the clove islands of Ternate and Tidore.

===Coming of the Dutch===
{{main|Governorate of the Banda Islands}}
[[Image:[[Fort Nassau]] 1646.jpg|right|thumb|Fort Nassau in 1646]]
The Dutch followed the Portuguese to Banda but were to have a much more dominating and lasting presence. Dutch-Bandanese relations were mutually resentful from the outset, with Holland’s first merchants complaining of Bandanese reneging on agreed deliveries and price, and cheating on quantity and quality. For the Bandanese, on the other hand, although they welcomed another competitor purchaser for their spices, the items of trade offered by the Dutch&mdash;heavy woollens, and damasks, unwanted manufactured goods, for example&mdash;were usually unsuitable in comparison to traditional trade products. The [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Arab]] and [[India]]n, and Portuguese traders for example brought indispensable items along with steel knives, copper, medicines and prized [[China|Chinese]] [[porcelain]].

As much as the Dutch disliked dealing with the Bandanese, the trade was a highly profitable one with spices selling for 300 times the purchase price in Banda. This amply justified the expense and risk in shipping them to Europe. The allure of such profits saw an increasing number of Dutch expeditions; it was soon seen that in trade with the East Indies, competition from each would eat into all their profits. Thus the competitors united to form the ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC)'' (the ‘[[Dutch East Indies Company]]).<ref name = "uclwxl">Hannard (1991)</ref>

Until the early seventeenth century the Bandas were ruled by a group of leading citizens, the ''orang kaya'' (literally 'rich men'), each of these was a head of district. At the time nutmeg was one of the "fine spices" kept expensive in Europe by disciplined manipulation of the market, but a desirable commodity for Dutch traders in the ports of India as well; economic historian [[Fernand Braudel]] notes that India consumed twice as much as Europe.<ref>Braudel 1984, p. 219</ref> A number of Banda’s ''orang kaya'' were persuaded (or deceived) by the Dutch to sign a treaty granting the Dutch a monopoly on spice purchases. Even though the Bandanese had little understanding of the significance of the treaty known as 'The Eternal Compact', or that not all Bandanese leaders had signed, it would later be used to justify Dutch troops being brought in to defend their monopoly.

The Bandanese soon grew tired of the Dutch actions; the low prices, the useless trade items, and the enforcement of Dutch sole rights to the purchase of the coveted spices. The end of the line for the Bandanese came in 1609 when the Dutch constructed [[Fort Nassau]] on Bandaneira Island. The ''orang kaya'' called a meeting with the Dutch admiral and forty of his highest-ranking men and ambushed and killed them all.<ref name = "uclwxl"/>

[[Image:Fort Belgica 1824.jpg|thumb|right|Fort Belgica in 1824]]

===English-Dutch rivalry===
While Portuguese and Spanish activity in the region had weakened, the English had built fortified trading posts on tiny Ai and [[Run (island)|Run]] islands, ten to twenty kilometres from the main Banda Islands. With the British paying higher prices, they were significantly undermining Dutch aims for a monopoly. As Anglo-Dutch tensions increased in 1611 the Dutch built the larger and more strategic [[Fort Belgica]] above Fort Nassau.

In 1615, the Dutch invaded Ai with 900 men whereupon the English retreated to Run where they regrouped. That same night, the English launched a surprise counter-attack on Ai, retaking the island and killing 200 Dutchmen. A year later, a much stronger Dutch force attacked Ai. This time the defenders were able to hold off the attack with cannon fire, but after a month of siege they ran out of ammunition. The Dutch slaughtered the defenders, and afterwards strengthened the fort, renaming it 'Fort Revenge'.

===Massacre of the Bandanese===
Newly appointed VOC governor-general [[Jan Pieterszoon Coen]] set about enforcing Dutch monopoly over the Banda’s spice trade. In 1621 well-armed soldiers were landed on Bandaneira Island and within a few days they had also occupied neighbouring and larger Lontar. The ''orang kaya'' were forced at gunpoint to sign an unfeasibly arduous treaty, one that was in fact impossible to keep, thus providing Coen an excuse to use superior Dutch force against the Bandanese.<ref name = "uclwxl"/> The Dutch quickly noted a number of alleged violations of the new treaty, in response to which Coen launched a punitive massacre. Japanese mercenaries were hired to deal with the ''orang kaya'',<ref>{{cite news |title=The world's oldest clove tree  |author=Simon Worrall |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18551857 |newspaper=BBC News |date=23 June 2012 Last updated at 10:51 GMT |accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref> forty of whom were beheaded with their heads impaled and displayed on bamboo spears.

The population of the Banda Islands prior to Dutch conquest is generally estimated to have been around 13,000-15,000 people, some of whom were Malay and Javanese traders, as well as Chinese and Arabs. The actual numbers of Bandanese who were killed, forcibly expelled or fled the islands in 1621 remain uncertain. But readings of historical sources suggest around one thousand Bandanese likely survived in the islands, and were spread throughout the nutmeg groves as forced labourers.<ref>Hanna 1991, p.54; Loth 1995, p.18</ref> The Dutch subsequently re-settled the islands with imported slaves, convicts and indentured labourers (to work the nutmeg plantations), as well as immigrants from elsewhere in Indonesia. Most survivors fled as refugees to the islands of their trading partners, in particular [[Keffing]] and [[Guli Guli]] in the [[Seram|Seram Laut]] chain and [[Kei Islands|Kei Besar]].<ref name = "uclwxl"/> Shipments of surviving Bandanese were also sent to Batavia ([[Jakarta]]) to work as slaves in developing the city and its fortress. Some 530 of these individuals were later returned to the islands because of their much-needed expertise in nutmeg cultivation (something sorely lacking among newly arrived Dutch settlers).<ref>Hanna 1991, p.55; Loth 1995, p.24</ref>

Whereas up until this point the Dutch presence had been simply as traders, that was sometimes treaty-based, the Banda conquest marked the start of the first overt colonial rule in Indonesia albeit under the auspices of the VOC.

===VOC Monopoly===
[[Image:Banda Neira 1724.jpg|thumb|right|Banda Neira in 1724]]
Having drastically reduced the islands' native population, Coen divided the productive land of approximately half a million nutmeg trees into sixty-eight 1.2-hectare ''perken''. These land parcels were then handed to Dutch planters known as ''perkeniers'' of which 34 were on Lontar, 31 on Ai and 3 on Neira.  With few Bandanese left to work them, slaves from elsewhere  were brought in. Now enjoying control of the nutmeg production the VOC paid the ''perkeniers'' 1/122nd of the Dutch market price for nutmeg, however, the ''perkeniers'' still profited immensely building substantial villas with opulent imported European decorations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The outlying island of Run was harder for the VOC to control and they exterminated all nutmeg trees there. The production and export of nutmeg was a VOC monopoly for almost two hundred years. [[Fort Belgica]], one of many forts built by the [[Dutch East India Company]], is one of the largest remaining European forts in Indonesia.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===English-Dutch rivalry continues===
European control of the Bandas was contested up until 1667 when, under the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)]], the English traded the small island of [[Run (island)|Run]] for [[Manhattan]], giving the Dutch full control of the Banda archipelago.

In 1810, the Kingdom of Holland was a vassal of Napoleonic France and hence in conflict with Britain.  The French and British were each seeking to control lucrative Indian Ocean trade routes.  On 10 May 1810, a squadron consisting of the 36-gun frigate ''[[HMS Caroline]]'', formerly French frigate ''[[French frigate Piémontaise (1804)|HMS Piedmontaise]]'', 18-gun [[Cruizer class brig-sloop|sloop]] ''[[HMS Barracouta]]'', and the 12-gun transport ''[[HMS Mandarin (1810)|HMS Mandarin]]'' left [[Chennai|Madras]] with money, supplies and troops to support the garrison at [[Ambon Island|Amboyna]], recently captured from the Dutch.  The frigates and sloop carried a hundred officers and men of the [[102nd Regiment of Foot (Royal Madras Fusiliers)|Madras European Regiment]], while the ''Mandarin'' carried supplies.  The squadron was commanded by Captain [[Christopher Cole (Royal Navy officer)|Christopher Cole]], with Captain Charles Foote on the ''Piedmontaise'' and Captain Richard Kenah aboard the ''Barracouta''.  After departing from Madras, Cole informed Foote and Kenah of Cole's plan to capture the Bandas; Foote and Kenah agreed. In Singapore, Captain [[Richard Spencer (Royal Navy officer)|Spencer]] informed Cole that over 700 regular Dutch troops may be located in the Bandas.<ref name="Adkins">{{cite book |last1=Adkins |first1=Roy |last2=Adkins |first2=Lesley |title=The War for All the Oceans: From Nelson at the Nile to Napoleon at Waterloo |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3u9jdSlnGiMC&pg=PA345&lpg=PA345 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |year=2008 |publisher=Penguin |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-14-311392-8 |pages=344–355 |chapter= |quote= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Annual biography and obituary |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=h-UKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA114 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |volume=21 |year=1837 |publisher=Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown |location=London |pages=114–123 |chapter=Sir Christopher Cole, K.C.B. }}</ref>

The squadron took a circuitous route to avoid alerting the Dutch.  On 9 August 1810, the British appeared at [[Banda Neira]].  They quickly stormed the island and attacked [[Fort Belgica|Belgica Castle]] at sunrise.  The battle was over within hours, with the Dutch surrendering [[Fort Nassau]] - after some subterfuge - and within days the remainder of the Banda Islands. After the Dutch surrender, Captain Charles Foote (of the ''Piedmontaise'') was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the Banda Islands. This action was a prelude to Britain's [[Invasion of Java (1811)|invasion of Java]] in 1811.<ref name="Adkins" />

Before the Dutch retook control of the islands, the British removed many nutmeg trees and transplanted them to [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] and other British colonies.  The competition largely destroyed the value of the Banda Islands to the Dutch.<ref>{{cite news |title=Banda, the nutmeg treasure islands |first=Peter |last=Milne |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/16/banda-nutmeg-treasure-islands.html |newspaper=Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=16 Jan 2011 |pages=10–11 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |quote=But the economic importance of the Bandas was only fleeting. With the Napoleonic wars raging across Europe, the English returned to the Bandas in the early 19th century, temporarily taking over control from the Dutch. This gave the English an opportunity to uproot hundreds of valuable nutmeg seedlings and transport them to their own colonies in Ceylon and Singapore, breaking forever the Dutch monopoly and consigning the Bandas to economic decline and irrelevance.}}</ref>

===Recent history===
In the late 1990s, violence between Christians and Muslims and between indigenous locals and [[Transmigration program|transmigrants]] spilled over from [[Maluku sectarian conflict|intercommunal conflict]] in Ambon. The disturbance and resulting deaths damaged the previously prosperous [[tourism]] industry.<ref>Witton, Patrick (2003). Indonesia. Melbourne: Lonely Planet. ISBN 1-74059-154-2</ref>

== Geography ==
There are seven inhabited islands and several that are uninhabited.  The inhabited islands are:
[[Image:BandaVolcano.JPG|thumb|right|The active volcano [[Banda Api]] in the Banda Islands]]
[[File:Banda-0039.jpg|thumb|The main island, Banda Neira (centre) viewed from the peak of Gunung Api volcano. In the background is Lontar Island.]]
Main group:
*[[Banda Neira]], or Naira, the island with the administrative capital and a small airfield (as well as accommodation for visitors). Present on Banda Neira is Fort Belgica, one of the largest remaining Dutch forts that are still intact in Indonesia. 
*[[Banda Api]], an active volcano with a peak of about 650 m
*Banda Besar is the largest island (Indonesian ''besar'', big), {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} wide. It has three main settlements, Lonthoir, Selamon and Waer.

Some distance to the west:
*Pulau [[Ai (island)|Ai]] or Pulau Ay
*Pulau [[Run (island)|Run]], further west again. In the 17th century, this island was involved in an exchange between the British and the Dutch for the island of Manhattan in New York.

To the east:
*Pulau Pisang (Banana Island), also known as Syahrir.

To the southeast:
*Pulau Hatta, formerly Rosengain or Rozengain

Others, possibly small and/or uninhabited, are:
*Nailaka, a short distance northeast of Pulau [[Run (island)|Run]]
*Batu Kapal
*Manuk, an active volcano
*Pulau Keraka or Pulau Karaka (Crab Island)
*Manukang
*Hatta Reef

The islands are part of the [[Banda Sea Islands moist deciduous forests]] [[ecoregion]].

==Bandanese culture==
Most of the present-day inhabitants of the Banda Islands are descended from migrants and plantation labourers from various parts of Indonesia, as well as from indigenous Bandanese. They have inherited aspects of pre-colonial ritual practices in the Bandas that are highly valued and still performed, giving them a distinct and very local cultural identity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In addition, Bandanese speak a distinct [[Malay Dialect]] which has several features distinguishing it from [[Ambonese Malay]], the better-known and more widespread dialect that forms a lingua franca in central and southeast Maluku. Bandanese Malay is famous in the region for its unique, lilting accent, but it also has a number of locally identifying words in its lexicon, many of them borrowings or [[loanwords]] from [[Dutch language|Dutch]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:BandaVolcanoSeenFromFortBelgica.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Banda Api as seen from Fort Belgica on Banda Neira.]] -->
Examples :
* fork	: forok (Dutch vork)
* ant	: mir (Dutch mier)
* spoon	: lepe (Dutch lepel)
* difficult : lastek (Dutch lastig)
* floor : plur (Dutch vloer)
* porch: stup (Dutch stoep)

Banda Malay shares many [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] loanwords with Ambonese Malay not appearing in the national language, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. But it has comparatively fewer, and they differ in pronunciation.

Examples :
* turtle : tetaruga (Banda Malay); totoruga (Ambonese Malay) (from Portuguese tartaruga)
* throat : gargontong (Banda Malay); gargangtang (Ambonese Malay) (from Portuguese garganta)

Finally, and most noticeably, Banda Malay uses some distinct pronouns. The most immediately distinguishing is that of the second person singular familiar form of address: pané.

The descendants of some of the Bandanese who fled Dutch conquest in the seventeenth century live in the [[Kai Islands]] (Kepulauan Kei) to the east of the Banda group, where a version of the original [[Banda language (Indonesia)|Banda language]] is still spoken in the villages of Banda Eli and Banda Elat on Kai Besar Island. While long integrated into Kei Island society, residents of these settlements continue to value the historical origins of their ancestors.
