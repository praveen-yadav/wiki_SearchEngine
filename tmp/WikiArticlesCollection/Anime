The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917, and production of anime works in Japan has since continued to increase steadily. The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of [[Osamu Tezuka]] and spread internationally in the late twentieth century, developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, by television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the internet and is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences.

Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies. The production of anime differs from [[Disney]] animation by focusing less on the animation of movement and more on the realism of settings as well as the use of camera effects, including panning, zooming and angle shots. No single art style exists and character proportions and features can be quite varied, including characteristically large emotive or realistically sized eyes.

The anime industry consists of over 430 production studios including major names like [[Studio Ghibli]], [[Gainax]] and [[Toei Animation]]. Despite having a fraction of the domestic film market, anime achieves a majority of DVD sales and has been an international success after the rise of televised English [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]]s. This rise in international popularly has resulted in non-Japanese productions using the anime art style, but these works have been defined as [[anime-influenced animation]] by both fans and the industry.

By the 1930s animation was well established in Japan as an alternative format to the [[live-action]] industry. It suffered competition from foreign producers and many animators, such as [[Noburō Ōfuji]] and [[Yasuji Murata]], who still worked in cheaper [[cutout animation]] rather than [[cel animation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/pioneers-of-anime.shtml|title=Pioneers of Japanese Animation (Part 1)|last=Sharp|first=Jasper|date=September 23, 2004|publisher=Midnight Eye|accessdate=December 11, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100117151328/http://www.midnighteye.com/features/pioneers-of-anime.shtml| archivedate= January 17, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Other creators, such as [[Kenzō Masaoka]] and [[Mitsuyo Seo]], nonetheless made great strides in animation technique; they benefited from the patronage of the government, which employed animators to produce educational shorts and [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|propaganda]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Yamaguchi|first=Katsunori|coauthors=Yasushi Watanabe|title=Nihon animēshon eigashi|publisher=Yūbunsha|year=1977|pages=26–37}}</ref> The first [[talkie]] anime was ''[[Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka]]'', produced by Masaoka in 1933.<ref name="animeguide">{{cite book |title=Anime: A Guide to Japanese Animation (1958-1988) |last=Baricordi |first=Andrea |coauthors=de Giovanni, Massimiliano; Pietroni, Andrea; Rossi, Barbara; Tunesi, Sabrina |date = December 2000|publisher=[[Protoculture Inc.]] |location=[[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada |isbn=2-9805759-0-9 |page=12}}</ref><ref name="kodanasha1993">{{cite book |title=Japan: An Illustrated Encyclopedia |year=1993 |publisher=[[Kodansha]] |location=Tokyo, Japan |isbn=978-4-06-206489-7}}</ref> By 1940, numerous anime artists' organizations had risen, including the Shin Mangaha Shudan and Shin Nippon Mangaka.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animestatic.com/articles/what-is-anime/|title=What is Anime?|publisher=AnimeStatic|accessdate=November 22, 2012}}</ref> The first feature length animated film was ''[[Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors]]'' directed by Seo in 1945 with sponsorship by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].<ref>Official booklet, ''The Roots of Japanese Anime'', DVD, Zakka Films, 2009.

The 1970s saw a surge of growth in the popularity of ''[[manga]]'', Japanese [[comics|comic books]] and [[graphic novel]]s, many of which were later animated. The work of Osamu Tezuka drew particular attention: he has been called a "legend"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200605110157.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060520053910/http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200605110157.html |archivedate=May 20, 2006 |title=5 missing manga pieces by Osamu Tezuka found in U.S|accessdate=August 29, 2006 |last=Ohara |first=Atsushi |publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |date=May 11, 2006}}</ref> and the "god of manga".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abcb.com/ency/t/tezuka_osamu.htm |title=Dr. Osamu Tezuka |accessdate=August 29, 2006 |date=March 14, 2000 |work=The Anime Encyclopedia |publisher=The Anime Café| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060823180357/http://abcb.com/ency/t/tezuka_osamu.htm| archivedate= August 23, 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paulgravett.com/articles/006_tezuka/006_tezuka.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071231013227/http://www.paulgravett.com/articles/006_tezuka/006_tezuka.htm |archivedate=December 31, 2007 |title=Osamu Tezuka: The God of Manga |accessdate=August 29, 2006 |last=Gravett |first=Paul |year=2003}}</ref> His work – and that of other pioneers in the field – inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today. The giant [[robot]] genre (known as "[[mecha]]" outside Japan), for instance, took shape under Tezuka, developed into the [[Super Robot]] genre under [[Go Nagai]] and others, and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by [[Yoshiyuki Tomino]] who developed the [[Real Robot]] genre. Robot anime like the ''[[Gundam]]'' and ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' series became instant classics in the 1980s, and the robot genre of anime is still one of the most common in Japan and worldwide today. In the 1980s, anime became more accepted in the [[Mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]] in Japan (although less than [[manga]]), and experienced a boom in production. Following a few successful adaptations of anime in overseas markets in the 1980s, anime gained increased acceptance in those markets in the 1990s and even more at the turn of the 21st century.

== Genres ==
Anime are often classified by target demographic, including ''[[Children's anime and manga|kodomo]]'' (children's), ''[[shōjo]]'' (girls'), ''[[shounen]]'' (boys') and a diverse range of genres targeting an adult audience. Shoujo and shounen anime sometimes contain elements popular with children of both sexes in an attempt to gain crossover appeal. Adult anime may feature a slower pace or greater plot complexity that younger audiences typically find unappealing, as well as adult themes and situations.{{rp|44-48}} A subset of adult anime works feature pornographic elements and are labeled "R18" in Japan, but internationally these works are grouped together under the term ''[[hentai]]'' (Japanese for "pervert"). By contrast, a variety of anime sub-genres across demographic groups incorporate ''[[ecchi]]'', sexual themes or undertones without depictions of [[sexual intercourse]], as typified in the comedic or [[Harem (genre)|harem]] genres; due to its popularity among adolescent and adult anime enthusiasts, incorporation of ecchi elements in anime is considered a form of [[fan service]].<ref name="askjohn">Ask John: [http://www.animenation.net/blog/2005/05/20/ask-john-why-do-americans-hate-harem-anime/ Why Do Americans Hate Harem Anime?]. animenation.net.

Genres have emerged that explore homosexual romances. While originally pornographic in terminology, ''[[yaoi]]'' (male homosexuality) and ''[[yuri (genre)|yuri]]'' (female homosexuality) are broad terms used internationally to describe any focus on the themes or development of romantic homosexual relationships. Prior to 2000, homosexual characters were typically used for comedic effect, but some works portrayed these characters seriously or sympathetically.<ref name=ae />{{rp|50}}

== Attributes ==
[[File:Modernanime.jpg|thumb|300px|Anime artists employ many distinct visual styles]]

Anime is a diverse art form that is targeted and produced for the domestic Japanese audience and market. Anime differs greatly from other forms of animation by its diverse art styles, methods of animation, its production and its process. Visually, anime is a diverse art form that contains a wide variety of styles that share few similarities to one another.

=== Animation technique ===
Anime follows the typical production of [[animation]], including [[storyboard]]ing, [[voice acting]], [[Character creation|character design]], and [[cel animation|cel production]]. Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used [[computer animation]] to improve the efficiency of the production process. Artists like [[Noburō Ōfuji]] pioneered the earliest anime works, which were experimental and consisted of images drawn on blackboards, [[stop motion]] animation of paper cutouts, and [[silhouette animation]].<ref name="Jouvanceau2004"/><ref name="Cinémathèque2008">{{cite web |title=Tribute to Noburō Ōfuji |work=To the Source of Anime: Japanese Animation |publisher=Cinémathèque québécoise |year=2008 |url=http://www.cinematheque.qc.ca/animation_japonaise.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=July 21, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080819214736/http://www.cinematheque.qc.ca/animation_japonaise.pdf| archivedate= August 19, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium.

Japanese animation studios were pioneers of many [[limited animation]] techniques. animators in Japan, like everywhere else, study the techniques of Disney in school, but anime has a distinct set of conventions that Japanese animators must learn and apply. Unlike Disney animation, where the emphasis is on the movement, anime emphasizes the art quality as limited animation techniques could make up for the lack of time spent on movement. Such techniques were often used not only to meet deadlines but also as artistic devices.<ref name="ChicksOnAnimeSep2008">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/chicks-on-anime/2008-09-16|last1=Dong |first1=Bamboo |last2=Brienza |first2=Casey |last3=Pocock |first3=Sara |last4=Sevakis |first4=Robin |title=Chicks on Anime - Sep 16th 2008 |series=Chicks on Anime |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=September 16, 2008 |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}</ref> Anime scenes place emphasis on achieving three-dimensional views, and backgrounds are instrumental in creating the atmosphere of the work.<ref name="manga!"/> The backgrounds are not always invented and are occasionally based on real locations, as exemplified in ''[[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|Howl's Moving Castle]]'' and ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (anime)|The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]''.<ref name=dc >{{cite book | title=The Anime Art of Hayao Miyazaki | publisher=McFarland | year=2006 | author=Cavallaro, Dani | pages=157–171}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rinku.zaq.ne.jp/p_v/haruhi.html |title=Reference pictures to actual places |accessdate=January 25, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070126012418/http://www.rinku.zaq.ne.jp/p_v/haruhi.html| archivedate= January 26, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Oppliger stated that anime is one of the rare mediums where putting together an all-star cast usually comes out looking "tremendously impressive."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2012/10/01/ask-john-what-determines-a-shows-animation-quality/ |last=Oppliger |first=John |title=Ask John: What Determines a Show's Animation Quality? |publisher=[[AnimeNation]] |date=October 1, 2012 |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}</ref>

The cinematic effects of anime differentiates itself from the stage plays found in American animation. Anime is cinematically shot as if by camera, including panning, zooming, distance and angle shots to more complex dynamic shots that would be difficult to produce in reality.<ref name=ae />{{rp|58}}<ref name="production">{{cite web|url=http://www.huitula.com/productionIG2_page2.htm|title=Anime production process - feature film|year=2000|accessdate=August 27, 2007|work=PRODUCTION I.G| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070815101432/http://www.huitula.com/productionIG2_page2.htm| archivedate= August 15, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.understandinganime.com/cinematography.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080613154025/http://www.understandinganime.com/cinematography.php |archivedate=June 13, 2008 |title=Cinematography: Looping and Animetion Techniques |year=1999 |accessdate=August 29, 2007 |work=Understanding Anime}}</ref> In anime, the animation is produced before the voice acting, contrary to American animation which does the voice acting first; this can cause [[lip sync]] errors in the Japanese version.<ref name=ae />{{rp|59}}

=== Characters ===
Body proportions of human anime characters tend to accurately reflect the proportions of the human body in reality. The height of the head is considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion. Head heights can vary, but most anime characters are about seven to eight heads tall.<ref name="headheight">{{cite web |url=http://animeworld.com/howtodraw/bodies1.html |title=Body Proportion |accessdate=August 16, 2007 |work=Akemi's Anime World| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070805152410/http://animeworld.com/howtodraw/bodies1.html| archivedate= August 5, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Anime artists occasionally make deliberate modifications to body proportions to produce [[super deformed]] characters that feature a disproportionately small body compared to the head; many super deformed characters are two to four heads tall. Some anime works like ''[[Crayon Shin-chan]]'' completely disregard these proportions, such that they resemble Western cartoons.

A common anime character design convention is exaggerated eye size. The animation of characters with large eyes in anime can be traced back to Osamu Tezuka, who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters as [[Betty Boop]], who was drawn with disproportionately large eyes. Tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history, whose iconic art style and character designs allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes.<ref name=ae />{{rp|60}} The artist adds variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth. Generally, a mixture of a light shade, the tone color, and a dark shade is used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biorust.com/tutorials/detail/141/en/ |title=Basic Anime Eye Tutorial |accessdate=August 22, 2007 |work=Centi, Biorust.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070824072700/http://biorust.com/tutorials/detail/141/en/| archivedate= August 24, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyJ9yfYl_Fc |title=How to color anime eye |date=June 6, 2007 |accessdate=August 22, 2007 |author=Carlus |publisher=YouTube}}</ref> Cultural anthropologist [[Matt Thorn]] argues that Japanese animators and audiences do not perceive such stylized eyes as inherently more or less foreign.<ref name="manga characters look white">{{cite web |title=Do Manga Characters Look "White"? |url=http://www.matt-thorn.com/mangagaku/faceoftheother.html |accessdate=December 11, 2005 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110717060459/http://www.matt-thorn.com/mangagaku/faceoftheother.html <!--DASHBot--> |archivedate=July 17, 2011}}</ref> However, not all anime have large eyes. For example, the works of [[Hayao Miyazaki]] are known for having realistically proportioned eyes, as well as realistic hair colors on their characters.<ref name="companion">{{cite book |last=Poitras |first=Gilles |title=Anime Companion |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |year=1998 |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=1-880656-32-9}}</ref>

[[File:Manga emotions-EN.jpg|thumb|Anime and manga artists often draw from a defined set of facial expressions to depict particular emotions]]

Hair in anime is often unnaturally lively and colorful or uniquely styled. The movement of hair in anime is exaggerated and "hair action" is used to emphasize the action and emotions of characters for added visual effect.<ref name=ae />{{rp|62}} Poitras traces hairstyle color to cover illustrations on manga, where eye-catching artwork and colorful tones are attractive for children's manga.<ref name=ae />{{rp|61}} Despite being produced for a domestic market, anime features characters whose race or nationality is not always defined, and this is often a deliberate decision, such as in the ''[[Pokémon]]'' animated series.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tobin|first=Joseph Jay|year=2004|title=Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon|publisher=Duke University Press|page=88|isbn=0-8223-3287-6}}</ref>

Anime and manga artists often draw from a common canon of iconic facial expression illustrations to denote particular moods and thoughts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mangatutorials.com/tut/expressions.php |title=Manga Tutorials: Emotional Expressions |accessdate=August 22, 2008 |work=Rio| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080729175352/http://www.mangatutorials.com/tut/expressions.php| archivedate= July 29, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> These techniques are often different in form than their counterparts in Western animation, and they include a fixed [[manga iconography|iconography]] that is used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods.<ref name="bloody" /> These expression are often exaggerated and are typically comedic in nature.

The industry has been subject to both praise and condemnation for [[fansubs]], the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films.<ref name=ma />{{rp|206}} Fansubs, which were originally distributed on VHS bootlegged cassettes in the 1980s, have been freely available and disseminated online since the 1990s.<ref name=ma />{{rp|206}} Fansubbers tend to adhere to an unwritten code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an official translated or subtitled version becomes licensed, although fansubs typically continue to circulate through file sharing networks.<ref name=ma />{{rp|207}}

=== Awards ===
The anime industry has several annual awards which honor the year's best works.

== Influence on world culture ==
[[File:Akihabara picture.jpg|thumb|[[Akihabara]] district of Tokyo is the center of ''[[otaku]]'' subculture in Japan.]]

Anime has become commercially profitable in [[Western world|Western countries]], as demonstrated by early commercially successful Western adaptations of anime, such as ''[[Astro Boy]]''. Since the 19th century, many Westerners have expressed a [[Japanophile|particular interest towards Japan]] and anime has dramatically exposed more Westerners to the culture of Japan.

=== Fan response ===
[[Anime club]]s gave rise to [[anime convention]]s in the 1990s with the "anime boom," a period marked by increased popularity of anime.<ref name=ae />{{rp|73}} These conventions are dedicated to anime and manga and include elements like [[cosplay]] contests and industry talk panels.<ref name=ma />{{rp|211}} Japanese culture and words have entered English usage through the popularity of the medium, including ''[[otaku]]'', a derogatory Japanese term commonly used in English to denote a fan of anime and manga.<ref name=ma />{{rp|195}} Anime enthusiasts have produced [[fan fiction]] and [[fan art]], including computer wallpaper and anime music videos.<ref name=ma />{{rp|201-205}} Cosplay, a [[portmanteau]] for "costume play", is not unique to anime and has become popular in contests and masquerades at anime conventions.<ref name=ma />{{rp|214-215}}

==="Anime style"===
As a popular movement and unique art style, anime styling has been the subject of both satire and serious creative productions. ''[[South Park]]'''s "[[Chinpokomon]]" and "[[Good Times with Weapons]]" episodes, [[Adult Swim]]'s ''[[Perfect Hair Forever]]'', and [[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[Kappa Mikey]]'' are examples of satirical depictions of Japanese culture and anime.
