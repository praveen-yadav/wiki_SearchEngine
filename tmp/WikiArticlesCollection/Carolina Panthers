The '''Carolina Panthers''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. They play in the [[NFC South|southern division]] of the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC), one of the two conferences in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The team is worth approximately [[United States dollar|USD]] $1 billion, according to ''[[Forbes]]'',<ref name="Valuation" /> and is controlled by [[Jerry Richardson]] and his family; they have a 48% stake. The remainder of the team is held by a group of 14 [[Limited partnership|limited partners]]. The head coach is [[Ron Rivera]], while the president is [[Danny Morrison (sports executive)|Danny Morrison]].

The Panthers first competed in 1995 and fared well in their first two years, finishing {{Win-loss record|w=7|l=9}} in 1995 (an all-time best for an expansion NFL team's first season) and {{Win-loss record|w=12|l=4}} in 1996. They did not have another winning season until 2003, when the team won the [[NFC Championship Game]] and reached [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]], losing 32–29 to the [[New England Patriots]]. The Panthers have made the playoffs four times, reaching the NFC Championship Game in three of them. They have won three division titles, one of them in the [[NFC West]] and two of them in the NFC South. The team's most recent playoff appearance was in 2008, when the Panthers finished {{Win-loss record|w=12|l=4}} before losing to the [[Arizona Cardinals]] in the divisional round. The team failed to record another winning season until [[2013 NFL season|2013]] following a 2012 season that ended with a {{Win-loss record|w=7|l=9}} record.

At home games, the atmosphere has been described as comparable to that of other NFL teams, with some games playing host to a large number of fans of the opposing team; this has been attributed to several factors, such as the city's relatively recent entry into the NFL, the popularity of [[basketball]] in the Charlotte region, and the large number of Charlotte residents who are originally from other cities with NFL teams. The Panthers' uniforms consist of black, white, and blue jerseys paired with white and silver pants, a pattern which has only seen minor changes since the team's inception. The team maintains rivalries with the three other teams in the NFC South, in addition to having out-of-division rivalries with the Arizona Cardinals and [[Dallas Cowboys]].

On December 15, 1987, [[Jerry Richardson]] announced his bid for an NFL expansion franchise in [[the Carolinas]].<ref name="Chronology" /> A native of North Carolina, Richardson was a former NFL player who had co-founded the [[Hardee's]] chain of restaurants and served as president and CEO of [[Trans World Corporation|TW Services]]. Richardson drew his inspiration to pursue an NFL franchise from [[George Shinn]], who had made a successful bid for an expansion team in Charlotte, the [[New Orleans Pelicans|Charlotte Hornets]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). Richardson founded Richardson Sports, a partnership consisting of himself and his family; a number of businessmen from North and South Carolina were also recruited to be [[limited partnership|limited partners]] in the group.<ref name="The Franchise">{{cite journal |last=Hoffer |first=Richard |date=October 28, 1991 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1140299/index.htm |title=The Franchise |journal=[[Sports Illustrated]] |location=New York |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |pages=64–66, 70, 72–73 |volume=75 |issue=19 |issn=0038-822X |accessdate=April 28, 2013}}</ref> Richardson looked at four potential locations for a stadium, ultimately choosing [[Charlotte center city|uptown Charlotte]]. To highlight the demand for professional football in the Carolinas, Richardson Sports held a preseason game in the region in 1989, 1990, and 1991. The first two games were held in [[Carter-Finley Stadium]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], and [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]] in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], respectively, while the third and final game was held at [[Williams-Brice Stadium]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]]. The matchups were between existing NFL teams. In 1991, the group formally filed an application for the open expansion spot, and on October 23, 1993, the 28 NFL owners unanimously awarded Richardson Sports the 29th NFL franchise.<ref name="Chronology" />

The Panthers first competed in the [[1995 NFL season]]; they were one of two expansion teams to begin playing that year, with the other being the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]].<ref name="Carolina's Davis Has His Hands Full Again" /> The Panthers were put in the [[NFC West|NFC West division]] to increase the size of that division to five teams; the Panthers were pleased with their placement because there were two other southeastern teams in the division, the [[Atlanta Falcons]] and the [[New Orleans Saints]].<ref name="Nfl Owners Decide Against Realignment Complications Carolina Panthers "Slotted" To Nfc West.

==Logo and uniforms==
[[File:Carolina Panthers logo.svg|alt=A stylized version of a Panther head, mainly colored black but with blue featured along the sides of the logo.|thumb|right|The Carolina Panthers' original logo was used from [[1995 NFL season|1995]] to [[2011 NFL season|2011]].]]

In choosing the team name, the Richardsons did not run focus groups with potential fans. Their intention had always been the 'Panthers'; Jerry Richardson began driving a car with the license plate 'PNTHRS' near the end of 1989. By the time they had been announced as the 29th NFL team in October 1993, the Panthers' logo and helmet design had already been finalized, but the uniform design was still under creation. After discussion, the Panthers organization decided on jerseys colored white, black, and blue, and pants colored white and silver. The exact tone of blue, which they decided would be "process blue" (a shade lighter than [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]]'s and darker than [[North Carolina Tar Heels|North Carolina]]'s), was the most difficult color to choose. The team's uniform has remained largely the same since its creation, with only minor alterations such as changing the sock color of the team's black uniforms from blue to black and changing the team's shoes from white to black.<ref name="Fifteen years of the Panthers">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2008/10/25/279610/fifteen-years-of-the-panthers.html|title=Fifteen years of the Panthers|last=Chandler|first=Charles|date=October 26, 2008|work=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|accessdate=January 27, 2013}}</ref> Richardson, a self-described traditionalist, has said that no major uniform changes will be made in his lifetime;<ref name="Richardson tells Panther fan that helmets will change, uniforms won't">{{cite web|url=http://scottfowlerobs.blogspot.com/2012/02/richardson-tells-panther-fan-that.html|title=Richardson tells Panther fan that helmets will change, uniforms won't|last=Fowler|first=Scott|date=February 2, 2012|publisher=Scott Says.

The team's uniform did not change significantly after [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] became the NFL's jersey supplier in 2012, but the collar was altered to honor former Panthers player and coach [[Sam Mills]] by featuring the phrase "Keep Pounding". Nike had conceived the idea, and the team supported the concept as a way to expose newer fans to the legacy of Mills, who died of cancer in 2005. Mills had introduced the phrase, which has since become a team slogan, in a speech that he gave to the players and coaches prior to their 2003 playoff game against Dallas; in the speech, Mills compared his fight against cancer with the team's on-field battle, saying "When I found out I had cancer, there were two things I could do – quit or keep pounding. I'm a fighter. I kept pounding. You're fighters, too. Keep pounding!"<ref name="Carolina Panthers’ uniforms to honor Sam Mills legacy">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestate.com/2012/04/04/2220106/carolina-panthers-uniforms-to.html|title=Carolina Panthers' uniforms to honor Sam Mills legacy|last=Fowler|first=Scott|date=April 3, 2012|work=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]|accessdate=January 27, 2013}}</ref>

==Rivalries==
{{Main|Buccaneers–Panthers rivalry|Falcons–Panthers rivalry}}

The Panthers have developed a number of rivalries during their time in the NFL, including heated ones with the three fellow members of the NFC South (the Atlanta Falcons, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and New Orleans Saints).<ref name="Sorensen: Falcons vs. Panthers is no rivalry">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2008/09/28/218960/sorensen-falcons-vs-panthers-is.html|title=Sorensen: Falcons vs. Panthers is no rivalry|last=Sorenson|first=Tom|date=September 28, 2008|work=The Charlotte Observer|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Saints, Panthers rivalry deepening after New Orleans' 30-27 win ">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwltv.com/sports/black-and-gold/Saints-Panthers-rivalry-deepening-after-New-Orleans-30-27-win-131475403.html|title=Saints, Panthers rivalry deepening after New Orleans' 30–27 win |date=October 21, 2011|publisher=[[WWL-TV|WWLTV.com]]|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref> The team's fiercest rivals are the Falcons<ref name="Panthers score some points for Rivera">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/68147/panthers-score-some-points-for-rivera|title=Panthers score some points for Rivera|last=Yasinskas|first=Pat|date=December 9, 2012|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref> and Buccaneers.<ref name="Sorensen: Falcons vs. Panthers is no rivalry" /> The Falcons are a natural geographic rival for the Panthers, as Atlanta is only 230 miles (370 kilometers) south on [[I-85 Corridor|I-85]].<ref name="Sorensen: Falcons vs. Panthers is no rivalry" /> The Panthers' rivalry with Tampa Bay is perhaps the most heated rivalry in the NFC South.<ref name="NFC South's most intense rivalry: Panthers vs. Bucs" /> The rivalry originated in 2003 and started with verbal bouts between players on the two teams. It escalated further when the Panthers went to Tampa Bay and beat them in what ESPN.com writer Pat Yasinskas described as "one of the most physical contests in recent memory".
