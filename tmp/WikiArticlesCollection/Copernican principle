In [[physical cosmology]], the '''Copernican principle''', named after [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], states that the Earth is not in a central, specially favored position in the [[universe]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Bondi |first=Hermann| authorlink = Hermann Bondi | title = Cosmology | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1952 | pages = 13}}</ref> More recently, the principle has been generalized to the [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] concept that humans are not privileged observers of the universe.<ref>{{cite book | last = Peacock |first=John A. | title =  Cosmological Physics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | page = 66 | year = 1998 |isbn= 0-521-42270-1}}</ref> In this sense, it is equivalent to the [[mediocrity principle]], with important implications for the [[philosophy of science]].

Since the 1990s the term has been used (interchangeably with "the Copernicus method") for [[J. Richard Gott]]'s [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian-inference]]-based prediction of duration of ongoing events, a generalized version of the [[Doomsday argument]].

== Origin and implications ==
[[Michael Rowan-Robinson]] emphasizes the Copernican principle as the threshold test for modern thought, asserting that: "It is evident that in the post-Copernican era of human history, no well-informed and rational person can imagine that the Earth occupies a unique position in the universe."<ref name="RowanRobinson1996">{{cite book | last=Rowan-Robinson |first=Michael  |authorlink=Michael Rowan-Robinson | title = Cosmology| edition = 3rd | publisher = Oxford University Press | pages = 62–63  |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-19-851884-6}}</ref>

[[Hermann Bondi]] named the principle after Copernicus in the mid-20th century, although the principle itself dates back to the 16th-17th century [[paradigm shift]] away from the [[Ptolemaic system]], which placed [[Earth]] at the center of the [[universe]]. Copernicus proposed that the motion of the planets can be explained by reference to an assumption that the Sun and not the Earth is centrally located and stationary. He argued that the [[apparent retrograde motion]] of the planets is an illusion caused by Earth's movement around the [[Sun]], which the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]] placed at the centre of the universe. Copernicus himself was mainly motivated by technical dissatisfaction with the earlier system and not by support for any mediocrity principle.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kuhn |first= Thomas S. | authorlink = Thomas Kuhn | title = The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought | publisher = Harvard University Press |year=1957 | isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}</ref> In fact, although the Copernican heliocentric model is often described as "demoting" Earth from its central role it had in the Ptolemaic geocentric model, neither Copernicus nor other 15th- and 16th-century scientists and philosophers viewed it as such.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/scientificamerican0301-24a |journal= Scientific American |year=2001 |volume=284 |issue=3 |pages=24 |title= Copernican Counterrevolution |authorlink= George Musser |last=Musser |first=George  |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=in-brief-2001-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1511/2009.76.50 |journal= American Scientist |year=2009 |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=50–57 |title= The Bones of Copernicus |first= Dennis |last=Danielson }}</ref>  It wasn't until the late 20th Century that Carl Sagan could claim "Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people.".<ref>Sagan C, Cosmos (1980) p.193</ref>

In cosmology, if one assumes the Copernican principle and observes that the universe appears [[Isotropy|isotropic]] or the same in all directions from our vantage-point on Earth, then one can infer that the universe is generally [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] or the same everywhere (at any given time) and is also isotropic about any given point. These two conditions make up the [[cosmological principle]].<ref name="RowanRobinson1996" /> In practice, astronomers observe that the universe has [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] or non-uniform structures up to the scale of [[galactic supercluster]]s, [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|great void]]s. It becomes more and more homogeneous and isotropic when observed on larger and larger scales, with little detectable structure on scales of more than about 200 million [[parsec]]s. However, on scales comparable to the radius of the observable universe, we see systematic changes with distance from the Earth. For instance, galaxies contain more young stars and are less clustered, and [[quasars]] appear more numerous. While this might suggest that the Earth is at the center of the universe, the Copernican principle requires us to interpret it as evidence for the evolution of the universe with time: this distant light has taken most of the age of the universe to reach and shows us the universe when it was young. The most distant light of all, [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], is isotropic to at least one part in a thousand.

Modern mathematical cosmology is based on the assumption that the Cosmological principle is almost, but not exactly, true on the largest scales. The Copernican principle represents the irreducible philosophical assumption needed to justify this, when combined with the observations.

Bondi and [[Thomas Gold]] used the Copernican principle to argue for the [[perfect cosmological principle]] which maintains that the universe is also homogeneous in time, and is the basis for the [[steady-state cosmology]].<ref name="BondiGold1948">{{cite journal|last=Bondi|first=H.|coauthors=Gold, T.|title=The Steady-State Theory of the Expanding Universe|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|year=1948|volume=108|issue=3|pages=252–270|bibcode=1948MNRAS.108..252B}}</ref>  However, this strongly conflicts with the evidence for cosmological evolution mentioned earlier:  the universe has progressed from extremely different conditions at the [[Big Bang]], and will continue to progress toward extremely different conditions, particularly under the rising influence of [[dark energy]], apparently toward the [[Big Freeze]] or [[Big Rip]].

==Tests of the principle==
The Copernican principle has never been proven, and in the most general sense cannot be proven, but it is implicit in many modern theories of physics.  Cosmological models are often derived with reference to the [[Cosmological principle]], slightly more general than the Copernican principle, and many tests of these models can be considered tests of the Copernican principle.<ref name=clarkson>{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.011301}}</ref>

===Historical===
Before the term Copernican principle was even coined, the Earth was repeatedly shown not to have any special location in the universe. The [[Copernican Revolution]] dethroned the Earth to just one of many planets orbiting the sun. [[William Herschel]] found that the solar system is moving through space within our disk-shaped [[Milky Way]] galaxy. [[Edwin Hubble]] showed that our galaxy is just one of many galaxies in the universe. Examination of our galaxy's position and motion in the universe led to the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] and the whole of modern [[cosmology]].

===Michelson-Morley and Relativity===
{{Main|Michelson–Morley experiment|Theory of relativity}}
The Michelson-Morley experiments to measure the Earth's motion through the [[Luminiferous aether]] provided further indirect proof that the Earth had no special position, although early interpretations implying a complete lack of motion in the ether would have dis-proven the principle. The final interpretations of the result in terms of the [[Electromagnetic theory|electromagnetic]] nature of light, [[Lorentz invariance]], and ultimately the [[general relativity|general]] and [[special relativity|special]] theories of relativity, contained no contradictions of the Copernican principle although still no strong proof.

===Ecliptic alignment of cosmic microwave background anisotropy===
The [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|Cosmic Microwave Background]] (CMB) radiation signature presents a direct large-scale view of the universe that can be used to identify whether our position or movement has any particular significance.  There has been much publicity about analysis of results from the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck mission]] that show both expected and unexpected [[Cosmic microwave background radiation#CMBR dipole anisotropy|anisotropies]] in the CMB.<ref name=hanson>{{cite arXiv|eprint=1210.6008|version=v1|author1=Anthony Challinor|title=CMB anisotropy science: A review|class=astro-ph.CO|year=2012}}</ref>

[[Cosmic microwave background radiation#Low multipoles and other anomalies|Some anomalies]] in the background radiation have been reported which are aligned with the plane of the solar system, which contradicts the Copernican principle by suggesting that the solar system's alignment is special.<ref name=mariano>{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevD.87.043511}}</ref>  Land and Magueijo dubbed this alignment the "axis of evil" owing to the implications for current models of the cosmos,<ref name=LandMagueijo2005>{{Cite journal |last = Land | first = Kate | coauthors = João Magueijo | first2 = João | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.071301  | title = Examination of Evidence for a Preferred Axis in the Cosmic Radiation Anisotropy  | journal = Physical Review Letters  | volume = 95  | issue = 7  | year = 2005 |arxiv = astro-ph/0502237 |bibcode = 2005PhRvL..95g1301L }}</ref> although several later studies have shown systematic errors in the collection of that data and the way it is processed.<ref name="arXiv:0907.2731v3">{{cite arxiv |last=Liu |first=Hao |last2=Li |first2=Ti-Pei |year=2009 |title=Improved CMB Map from WMAP Data |class=astro-ph |eprint=0907.2731v3}}</ref><ref name="arXiv:1006.1270v1">{{cite arxiv |last=Sawangwit |first=Utane |last2=Shanks |first2=Tom |year=2010 |title=Lambda-CDM and the WMAP Power Spectrum Beam Profile Sensitivity |class=astro-ph |eprint=1006.1270v1}}</ref><ref name="arXiv:1009.2701v1">{{cite arxiv |last=Liu |first=Hao |coauthors=''et al.'' |year=2010 |title=Diagnosing Timing Error in WMAP Data |class=astro-ph |eprint=1009.2701v1}}</ref>  Various studies of the CMB anisotropy data either confirm the Copernican principle,<ref name=zhang>{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.041301}}</ref> model the alignments in a non-homogeneous universe still consistent with the principle,<ref name=buckley>{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevD.87.023524}}</ref> or attempt to explain them as local phenomena.<ref name=Hansen2012>{{cite doi|10.1088/1475-7516/2012/10/059}}</ref>  Some of these alternate explanations were discussed by Copi, ''et al.'', who looked at data from the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck satellite]] to resolve whether the preferred direction and alignments were spurious.<ref name=Copi2010>[http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.5602 Large-angle anomalies in the CMB]</ref><ref name=Copi2006>[http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0605135 The Uncorrelated Universe: Statistical Anisotropy and the Vanishing Angular Correlation Function in WMAP Years 1-3]</ref>

==Physics without the principle==
The standard model of cosmology, the [[Lambda-CDM model]], assumes the Copernican principle and the more general Cosmological principle and observations are largely consistent but there always [[Unsolved problems in physics#Astronomy and astrophysics|unsolved problems]].  Some cosmologists and theoretical physicists design models lacking the Cosmological or Copernican principles, to constrain the valid values of observational results, to address specific known issues, and to propose tests to distinguish between current models and other possible models.

A prominent example in this context is the observed [[accelerating universe]] and the [[cosmological constant]] issue.  An alternative proposal to [[dark energy]] is that the universe is much more inhomogeneous than currently assumed, and specifically that we are in an extremely large low-density void.<ref name=void>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16627.x}}</ref>  To match observations we would have to be very close to the centre of this void, immediately contradicting the Copernican principle.
