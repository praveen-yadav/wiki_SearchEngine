'''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''' (the '''LDS Church''' or, informally, the '''Mormon Church''') is a [[Christian primitivist]] church that considers itself to be a [[Restoration (Latter Day Saint)|restoration]] of the church founded by [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. The church is headquartered in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], and has established congregations (called ''[[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]]'' or ''branches'') and built [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] worldwide. According to the church, it has over 80,000 [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionaries]] worldwide<ref>{{citation |work= Deseret News |contribution-url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865587741/President-Thomas-S-Monson-Welcome-to-Conference.html |title= President Thomas S.

Adherents, sometimes referred to as ''Latter-day Saints'' or, more informally, ''[[Mormons]]'', view faith in Jesus Christ and his [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] as the central tenet of their religion.<ref>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith (1976), 121 ("The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.").

Book of Mormon; Mosiah 3:12</ref> though LDS doctrines regarding the [[God in Mormonism|nature of God]] and the [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|potential of mankind]] differ significantly from mainstream Christianity. The church has an [[biblical canon|open canon]] which includes four [[religious text|scriptural texts]]:<ref>{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}</ref> the Bible (both [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s), the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. Other than the Bible, the majority of the LDS canon constitutes revelation dictated by Joseph Smith and includes commentary and [[exegesis]] about the Bible, texts described as lost parts of the Bible, and other works believed to be written by ancient [[prophet]]s.

Under the doctrine of [[continuous revelation|continuing]] [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]], Latter-day Saints believe that Jesus Christ, under the direction of [[God the Father|Heavenly Father]], leads the church by revealing his will to its [[President of the Church|president]], whom adherents regard as a modern-day "[[prophet, seer, and revelator]]". The current president is [[Thomas S. Monson]]. Individual members believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives.<ref>"Perhaps the puzzle some feel can be explained by the reality that each of us has two different channels to God. We have a channel of governance through our prophet and other leaders. This channel, which has to do with doctrine, ordinances, and commandments, results in obedience. We also have a channel of personal testimony, which is direct to God. This has to do with His existence, our relationship to Him, and the truth of His restored gospel. This channel results in knowledge." Elder Dallin H. Oaks Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, April 2008 LDS General Conference, {{cite web |url=http://lds.org/conference/talk/display/0,5232,23-1-851-10,00.html |title=Testimony |author=Elder Dallin H.

==History==
{{Main|History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}

The history of the LDS Church is typically divided into three broad time periods: (1) the early history during the lifetime of [[Joseph Smith]], which is in common with all Latter Day Saint movement churches; (2) a pioneer era under the leadership of [[Brigham Young]] and his 19th-century successors; and (3) a modern era beginning around the turn of the 20th century as [[Utah]] achieved statehood.

===Beginnings===
[[Image:Joseph Smith first vision stained glass.jpg|upright|thumb|Church members believe that [[Joseph Smith]] was called to be a modern-day prophet through, among other events, a [[First Vision|visitation]] from [[God the Father]] and [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].]]

The LDS Church traces its current dispensation beginnings to [[Joseph Smith]] on April 6, 1830 in Western New York.<ref>Scholars and eye-witnesses disagree whether the church was organized in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester, New York]] at the Smith log home, or in [[Fayette, New York|Fayette]] at the home of [[Peter Whitmer]]. {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=109}}; {{Harvtxt|Marquardt|2005|pp=223–23}} (arguing that organization in Manchester is most consistent with eye-witness statements).

===Pioneer era===
[[Image:BrighamYoung1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brigham Young]] led the LDS Church from 1844 until his death in 1877.]]
For two years after Smith's death, conflicts escalated between Mormons and other Illinois residents. To prevent war,<ref>In 2004, the State of Illinois recognized the expulsion of the Latter-day Saints as the "largest forced migration in American history" and stated in the adopted resolution that, "WHEREAS, The biases and prejudices of a less enlightened age in the history of the State of Illinois caused unmeasurable hardship and trauma for the community of Latter-day Saints by the distrust, violence, and inhospitable actions of a dark time in our past; therefore, be it resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-third General Assembly of the State of Illinois, that we acknowledge the disparity of those past actions and suspicions, regretting the expulsion of the community of Latter-day Saints, a people of faith and hard work."

[[Brigham Young]] took Smith's advice and led his followers, known in modern times as the [[Mormon pioneers]], to [[Nebraska]] and then in 1847 to what became the [[Utah Territory]].<ref name="emigration-religious-freedom">[http://www.nps.gov/mopi/historyculture/index.htm "Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail: History & Culture"], U.S. National Park Service.

Young incorporated the LDS Church as a legal entity, and initially governed both the church and the state as a [[theocracy|theocratic]] leader. He also publicized the sacred practice of [[plural marriage]],<ref>The Mormon doctrine of plural wives was officially announced by one of the [[Quorum of the Twelve|Twelve Apostles]] [[Orson Pratt]] and [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Smith]]'s successor [[Brigham Young]] in a special conference of the elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints assembled in the [[Mormon Tabernacle]] on August 28, 1852, and reprinted in an extra edition of the ''[[Deseret News]]'' Only a small percentage of church leaders participated in plural marriage believing it was a part of a restitution of ancient Priesthood blessings and a commandment of god to raise up a righteous generation.

At Young's death in 1877, he was followed by other [[President of the Church|church presidents]], who resisted efforts by the [[United States Congress]] to outlaw Mormon polygamous marriages. In 1878, the United States Supreme Court, in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'', decreed that "religious duty" to engage in plural marriage was not a valid defense to prosecutions for violating state laws against polygamy. Conflict between Mormons and the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] escalated to the point that in 1890, Congress disincorporated the LDS Church and seized all its assets. Soon thereafter, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]] that officially suspended the practice.<ref>{{lds|Official Declaration —|od|1}}</ref> Although this Manifesto did not yet dissolve existing plural marriages, so that families would not be split apart or damaged, no new polygamous marriages would be performed. Relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a US state in 1896. Relations further improved after 1904, when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] again [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before the [[United States Congress]] and issued a "[[Second Manifesto]]" calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease, as they were already against church doctrine since Woodruff issued the Manifesto. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy and today seeks to actively distance itself from "[[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]" groups still practicing polygamy.<ref>In 1998 [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] stated, "If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose. Not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law, they are in violation of the law of this Church." Gordon B. Hinckley, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1998/11/what-are-people-asking-about-us "What Are People Asking About Us?"] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', November 1998, p. 70</ref>

A number of official changes have taken place to the organization during the modern era. One significant change was the ordination of men of black African descent (regardless of actual skin color) to the priesthood in 1978, which reversed a policy originally instituted by Brigham Young in 1852.<ref name = "Mauss-70">[http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3 Bush & Mauss 1984: 70]</ref> There are also periodic changes in the structure and organization of the church, mainly to accommodate the organization's growth and increasing international presence. For example, since the early 1900s, the church has instituted a [[Priesthood Correlation Program]] to centralize church operations and bring them under a hierarchy of priesthood leaders. During the [[Great Depression]], the church also began operating a church welfare system, and it has conducted numerous humanitarian efforts in cooperation with other religious organizations including [[Catholic Relief Services]] and [[Islamic Relief]], as well as secular organizations such as the [[American Red Cross]].

==Teachings and practices==

===Authorized texts===
[[Image:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|upright=.6|thumb|The written canon of the LDS Church is referred to as its ''[[Standard Works]]''.]]
{{See also|Standard Works|Revelation (Latter Day Saints)}}
The theology of the LDS Church consists of a combination of biblical doctrines with modern revelations and other commentary by LDS leaders, particularly Joseph Smith, Jr. The most authoritative sources of theology are the faith's canon of four religious texts, called the ''[[Standard Works]]''. Included in the ''Standard Works'' are the Bible, the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. Among these books, the church holds in equal esteem as the other Standard Works the Book of Mormon, said by the church to be "Another Testament of Jesus Christ" that Joseph Smith translated from buried [[golden plates]]. The LDS Church believes that the [[Angel Moroni]] told Smith about these golden plates and guided him to find them buried in the [[Hill Cumorah]]. The church believes that this Angel Moroni is the same angel spoken of in the Bible in Revelation 14:6. The church characterizes the Book of Mormon as "the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of [their] religion".<ref>''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'', '''4''':461.</ref>

The Bible, also part of the church's canon, is believed to be "the word of God as far as it is translated correctly".<ref>See {{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}} ("We believe the ''Bible'' to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.")</ref> Most often, the church uses the [[Authorized King James Version]].<ref>see [http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bible The Bible] published on the official church site lds.org</ref> Sometimes, however, parts of the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]] are considered authoritative. Some excerpts of Joseph Smith's translation have been included in the Pearl of Great Price, which also includes further translations by Smith and church historical items. Other historical items and revelations are found in the Doctrine and Covenants.

Another source of authoritative doctrine is the pronouncements of the current Apostles and members of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]]. The church teaches that the First Presidency (the prophet and his counselors) and the Quorum of Twelve Apostles are prophets<ref name="oct12_conference">{{Cite conference  | title = The Sustaining of Church Officers: Presented by President Henry B. Eyring  | publisher = The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  | date = October 7, 2012| location = Salt Lake City, UT  | url = http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/the-sustaining-of-church-officers  | accessdate =January 23, 2013}} See paragraph 7; "It is proposed that we sustain the counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators." See also [http://www.lds.org/search?query=sustaining+of+church+officers Search "The Sustaining of Church Officers"] for past sustaining</ref> and that their teachings are generally given under inspiration from God through the [[Holy Spirit]]. Members of the church acknowledge (sustain) them regularly as [[prophet, seer, and revelator|prophets, seers, and revelators]]—this is done publicly twice a year at the church's worldwide [[general conference (LDS Church)|general conference]].<ref name="oct12_conference"/>

===Distinctive doctrines and practices===
{{Main|Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
[[Image:Phil and Marlene.jpg|thumb|upright|A couple after their [[Celestial marriage|marriage]] in the [[Manti Utah Temple]]]]
Several doctrines and practices of the LDS Church are unique within Christianity. For example, the [[Mormon cosmology]] and [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]] include the doctrines of a [[pre-mortal life]], [[Degrees of Glory|three degrees of heaven]], and [[Exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exaltation]]. According to these doctrines every human spirit is a literal child of [[God the Father|Heavenly Father]], and each has the potential to continue to learn, grow, and progress in the eternities, eventually achieving eternal life (which Latter-day Saints view as distinct from [[immortality]]), which is to become one with God in the same way that [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] is one with the Father, thus allowing the children of God to become divine beings or "gods" themselves.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=74}}</ref> Achieving this same status is also referred to as becoming a "joint-heir with Christ."<ref>[http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/EoM,3735 "Godhood," Encyclopedia of Mormonism, p. 554,] "Those who achieve this state of perfection will become joint-heirs with Christ."</ref> The process by which this is done is called ''exaltation'', a doctrine which includes the reunification of the mortal family after the [[resurrection]] and the ability to have spirit children in the afterlife and inherit a portion of God's kingdom.<!--FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{citation | author=LDS Church | title=Gospel Principles | publisher=LDS Church | publication-place=[[Salt Lake City, Utah]] | year=1997 | url = http://www.lds.org/gospellibrary/materials/gospel/Start%20Here_01.pdf }} (listing among the "blessings given to exalted people" that "they will become gods,… and will be able to have spirit children…."); {{citation | last=Carter | first=K.

 }} (p. 553: "all resurrected and perfected mortals become gods"; p. 554: "Latter-day Saints believe that those who become gods will have the opportunity to…add[] further offspring to the eternal family").</ref> To obtain this state of godhood, the church teaches that one must have faith in Jesus Christ, [[repentance|repent]] of his or her sins, strive to keep the commandments faithfully, and participate in a sequence of ceremonial [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenants]] called ''[[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]]'', which include [[baptism (LDS Church)|baptism]], [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost]], the [[Endowment (Mormonism)|Endowment]], and [[celestial marriage]].<!-- FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{citation | last=Pope | first=Margaret McConkie | contribution=Exaltation | title=Encyclopedia of Mormonism | year=1992 | editor-last=Ludlow | editor-first=Daniel H. | publisher=Macmillan | publication-place=New York | isbn=0-02-904040-X | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/EoM,3667 | page=479

This latter ordinance, known as a [[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealing]] ceremony, reflects a singular LDS view with respect to families. According to LDS Church theology, men and women may be "sealed" to one another so that their marital bond continues into the eternities.<ref>A man may be sealed to more than one wife if his previous wives are either dead or legally divorced from him; a living woman, however, may only be sealed to one husband. See {{Citation | author=LDS Church | title=[[Church Handbook of Instructions]] | year=2006 | place=Salt Lake City, Utah | publisher=LDS Church | page=85 }}. Thus, there is a common view within the LDS Church that though prohibited by the LDS Church in mortality, [[plural marriage]] will exist in the afterlife. See, e.g., {{Citation | last=Penrose | first=Charles W. | author-link=Charles W. Penrose | title=Mormon Doctrine Plain and Simple, or Leaves from the Tree of Life | page=66 | year=1897 | publication-place=Salt Lake City, UT }} ("In the case of a man marrying a wife in the everlasting covenant who dies while he continues in the flesh and marries another by the same divine law, each wife will come forth in her order and enter with him into his glory."); {{Citation | editor1-last=McConkie | editor1-first=Bruce R. | editor1-link=Bruce R.

 | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/EoM,5557 | page=218 }}.</ref> The most significant LDS ordinances may be performed via proxy in behalf of those who have died, such as [[baptism for the dead]]. The church teaches that all will have the opportunity to hear and accept or reject the gospel of Jesus Christ and the blessings that come to those who faithfully adhere to it, in this life or the next. Ordinances such as baptisms for the dead, sealings, and [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowments]] are performed in [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] that are built and dedicated specifically for these purposes.

The LDS faithful observe a health code called the "[[Word of Wisdom]]," in which they abstain from the consumption of alcoholic beverages, coffee, tea, and tobacco.<ref name = wordofwisdom/> The Word of Wisdom also encourages the use of wholesome herbs and fruits within season, moderate consumption of meat, and consumption of grains,<ref name = wordofwisdom>[[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89 89].</ref> as well as regular [[physical exercise]].{{cn|date=October 2013}}

Latter-day Saints follow a moral code, called the "[[law of chastity]]," which prohibits [[adultery]], all homosexual behavior, and any sexual relations outside of marriage.

LDS faithful donate a ten percent [[tithe]] on their annual income, which is used to carry out the operations of the church, including construction of temples, meetinghouses and other buildings, as well as other church uses. Faithful members also set aside the [[Fast Sunday|first Sunday of each month]] to [[fasting|abstain from food and drink]] for at least two consecutive meals, and donate at least the cost of the two skipped meals as a [[fast offering]], which the church uses to assist the poor and needy and expand its worldwide [[LDS Humanitarian Services|humanitarian efforts]]. Members are further instructed to set aside one night a week, typically Monday, for a "[[Family Home Evening]]," where they gather together as a family to study gospel principles and participate in wholesome activities.

====Missionary service====
[[Image:MISSIONNAIRES MORMONS.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Missionary (LDS Church)|Missionaries]] typically commit to 18–24 months of full-time service.]]
{{main|Missionary (LDS Church)}}
The LDS Church expects all male members to serve a [[Missionary (LDS Church)|two-year mission]] unless physical, mental, or emotional health issues prevent their service.<ref>{{cite web|last=Monson|first=Thomas S.|title=Welcome to Conference|url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/welcome-to-conference?lang=eng&media=video|authorlink=Thomas S.

Prospective missionaries must be at least 18 years old and no older than 25, not yet married, have completed secondary school, and meet certain criteria for physical fitness and spiritual worthiness. Prior to October 2012 the minimum age for full-time missionary service was generally 19 for men and 21 for women.<ref>{{Citation|author=Joseph Walker|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765609643/LDS-Church-lowers-age-requirement-for-missionary-service.html|title=LDS Church lowers age requirement for missionary service|work=Deseret News|date=October 6, 2012}}.</ref> Missionary service is not compulsory, nor is it required for young men to retain their church membership. Unmarried women 19 years and older may also serve as missionaries, generally for a term of 18 months.  However, the LDS Church emphasizes that women are not under the same expectation to serve as male members are, and may serve solely as a personal decision. There is no maximum age for missionary service for women.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=22472472 |title= LDS Church members respond to new mission age rules |first= David Self |last= Newlin |first2= Jennifer |last= Stagg |date= October 8, 2012 |publisher= [[KSL-TV|KSL]] |accessdate= 2013-03-07 }}</ref> Retired couples are encouraged to serve missions, and may serve for either 6-, 12-, 18-, or 23-month terms.<ref>"Missionary Policy Changes Give More Seniors Opportunity to Serve", LDS Church News Release, June 2, 2011.</ref>  These senior missionaries may serve in non-proselyting capacities such as [[humanitarian aid]] workers or [[family history]] specialists.

===Comparisons with mainstream Christianity===
{{See also|Mormonism and Christianity}}
The LDS Church shares various teachings with other branches of Christianity. These include a belief in the Bible (excluding parts the LDS believed to be translated incorrectly),<ref>Adherents believe in the Bible "as far as it is translated correctly" See {{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}.</ref> the divinity of Jesus, and his [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] and [[resurrection of Jesus Christ|resurrection]]. LDS theology also includes belief in the doctrine of salvation through Jesus alone, [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationism]]<ref>{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|6}}.</ref> (via a [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration of Christ's church revealed through Joseph Smith, Jr.]]), [[millennialism]], [[continuationism]], [[penal substitution]],<ref>Book of Mormon, Alma 34:8–16.</ref> and a form of [[apostolic succession]]. The practices of [[baptism#Submersion|baptism by immersion]] and the [[Eucharist]] (referred to as ''the [[Sacrament (LDS Church)|Sacrament]]'') are also held in common. However, the [[Catholic Church]] considers doctrinal differences between the two groups to be so great that it will not accept a prior LDS baptism as evidence of Christian initiation, as it will baptism by other Christian groups, such as the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Protestant]] churches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/theology/mormbap1.htm|title=The Question of the Validity of Baptism Conferred in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|author=Fr.

Nevertheless, the LDS Church differs from the many other churches within contemporary Christianity, and many people do not accept the church as part of Christianity.<ref>For example, a 2007 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 31% of Americans surveyed do not consider Mormons to be Christian.

Officially, major Christian denominations view the LDS Church as standing apart from [[creed]]al Christianity,<ref>See, for example, {{Citation|url=http://www.pcusa.org/interfaith/study/lds.htm|title=Presbyterians and Latter-day Saints|accessdate=January 30, 2007}} ([[Presbyterian Church USA]], stating that "Mormonism is a new and emerging religious tradition distinct from the historic apostolic tradition of the Christian Church"); {{Citation|url=http://www.elca.org/dcm/worship/faq/baptism/rebaptize.html|title=Should Lutherans Rebaptize Former Mormons Who Are Joining the Congregation?|accessdate=August 15, 2006}} ([[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], stating that LDS Church doctrine regarding the [[Trinity]] is "substantially different from that of orthodox, creedal Christianity"; {{Citation|url=http://www.gc2000.org/pets/cal/TEXT/c0806.asp|title=General Conference 2000 806-NonDis|accessdate=August 15, 2006}} ([[United Methodist Church]], stating that the LDS Church, "by self-definition, does not fit within the bounds of the historic, apostolic tradition of Christian faith").</ref> a point the LDS Church itself does not dispute.<ref>According to [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], Jesus told him that the Christian creeds "were an abomination in his sight; that those professors [of religion] were all corrupt".  ''Pearl of Great Price'', [[Joseph Smith—History]] 1:19.</ref>

From the perspective of Christians who agree with creeds, the most significant area of departure is the rejection by the LDS Church of certain parts of ecumenical creeds such as the Nicene Creed, which defines the predominant view of the Christian God as a [[Trinity]] of three separate persons in "[[Homoousian|one essence]]". LDS Church theology includes the belief in a "[[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]]" composed of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as three separate Persons who share a unity of purpose or will; however, they are viewed as three distinct Beings making one Godhead. Other significant differences relate to the church's acceptance of additional scripture, doctrine, and practices beyond what is found in the Catholic, Protestant, or [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] versions of the Bible.

===Comparison with other Latter Day Saint movement faiths===
{{See also|List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement}}
The LDS Church shares a common heritage with a number of smaller faith groups that are collectively called the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].  The largest of these smaller groups is the [[Community of Christ]] (previously known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), based in [[Independence, Missouri]], followed by the [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)|Church of Jesus Christ]], based in [[Monongahela, Pennsylvania]]. In common with the LDS Church, these faiths believe in Joseph Smith as a prophet and founder of their religion. They also accept the Book of Mormon, and most, but not all, accept at least some version of the ''Doctrine and Covenants''.  However, they tend to disagree to varying degrees with the LDS Church on matters of doctrine and church leadership.

The main branches of the Latter Day Saint movement resulted from the crisis of succession upon the death of Joseph Smith, Jr.  Other branches may be considered later off-shoots of the LDS Church branch, mainly as a result of disagreements about plural marriage. In the LDS Church, the practice of plural marriage was abandoned around the turn of the 20th century when the church's president stated that God revealed that plural marriage was no longer necessary, but it has continued among the fundamentalist groups, who believe the practice is a requirement for exaltation. The LDS Church, by contrast, teaches that a single celestial marriage is sufficient for exaltation. Fundamentalists also believe in a number of other doctrines taught and practiced by Brigham Young in the 19th century, which the LDS Church has either abandoned, repudiated, or put in abeyance; e.g., the church has long excommunicated any members caught practicing polygamy.

In 1887, the LDS Church was legally dissolved in the United States by the [[Edmunds–Tucker Act]] because of the church's practice (now abandoned) of polygamy. The Edmunds-Tucker Act was repealed in 1978. The church has continued to operate under what remains its formal name, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Accepted informal names include the LDS Church, the Latter-day Saints, and the Mormons. The term ''Mormon Church'' is in common use,<ref>The [[Associated Press]] continues to says that "Mormon Church" is a proper second reference in its ''Style Guide'' for journalists. {{cite web |url=http://www.westminster-mo.edu/academics/resources/library/resources/Pages/GuidetoAPStyle.aspx |title=? }}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref> but the church began discouraging its use in the late 20th century, though takes no issue with the term ''Mormon'' itself.

The church has organized several tax-exempt corporations to assist with the transfer of money and capital. These include the Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, organized in 1916 under the laws of the state of Utah to acquire, hold, and dispose of [[real property]]. In 1923, the church incorporated the Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah to receive and manage money and church donations. In 1997, the church incorporated [[Intellectual Reserve|Intellectual Reserve, Inc.]] to hold all the church's [[copyright]]s, trademarks, and other intellectual property. The church also holds several non-tax-exempt corporations, such as [[Bonneville International Corporation|Bonneville International]] and the [[Deseret Morning News|Deseret News]].

===Geographic distribution and membership===

Church congregations are organized geographically. Members are generally expected to attend the congregation with their assigned geographical area; however, some geographical areas also provide separate congregations for young single adults (between the ages of 19 and 30), single adults aged 31 to 45,<ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook 2: Administering the Church|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|url=https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/single-members?lang=eng}}</ref>  or for speakers of alternate languages.  For Sunday services, the church is grouped into either larger (~200 to ~400 people) congregations known as [[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]], or smaller congregations known as branches. Although the building may sometimes be referred to as a chapel, the room used as a chapel for religious services is actually only one component of the standard [[meetinghouse]], of which the church maintains [http://www.mormon.org/virtualchapel/virtualchapel.html a virtual tour of a typical example] and also an [http://maps.lds.org online meetinghouse locator] which can be used to find the locations and meeting times of its congregations all over the world. Regional church organizations larger than single congregations include [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]], [[Mission (LDS Church)|missions]], [[District (LDS Church)|districts]], [[Area (LDS Church)|areas]], and regions.

On August 30, 2010, Church leaders announced that they were making significant progress on "regularized operations for the Church in China."<ref name=china>[http://newsroom.lds.org/article/church-in-talks-to-regularize-activities-in-china Church in Talks to "Regularize" Activities in China].

===Priesthood hierarchy===
{{Main|Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood (LDS Church)}}
[[Image:Thomas S Monson.jpg|right|thumb|[[Thomas S. Monson]], [[President of the Church|President]] of the LDS Church since 2008.]]

The LDS Church is organized in a hierarchical priesthood structure administered by men. Latter-day Saints believe that Jesus leads the church through revelation and has chosen a single man, called "the Prophet" or [[President of the Church]], as his spokesman on the earth. The current president is [[Thomas S. Monson]]. While there have been exceptions in the past, he and two counselors are normally ordained [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostles]] and form the [[First Presidency]], the presiding body of the church; twelve other apostles form the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]].<ref name="Haight, David B. 1986">[[David B. Haight|Haight, David B.]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1986/05/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord "A Prophet Chosen of the Lord"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', May 1986, p. 7.</ref> When a president dies, his successor is invariably the most senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve (the one who has been an apostle the longest), who then reconstitutes a new First Presidency.<ref name="Haight, David B. 1986"/>  These men, and the other male members of the church-wide leadership (including the first two [[Seventy (LDS Church)|Quorums of Seventy]] and the [[Presiding Bishopric]]) are called [[general authority|general authorities]]. They exercise both [[ecclesiastical]] and administrative leadership over the church and direct the efforts of regional leaders down to the local level. General authorities and [[mission president]]s work full-time and typically receive stipends from church funds or investments.<ref>Ludlow, Daniel H., Latter-day Prophets Speak: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Church Presidents, 1948/1993, Ch. 32</ref>

At the local level, the church leadership are drawn from the laity and work on a part-time volunteer basis without stipend.<ref>For a time, the church had a paid local clergy; however, that practice was discontinued in the early 1900s. See [[D. Michael Quinn]] (1997), ''Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power'', Salt Lake City: Signature Books, ch. 6.</ref><!--

--> Like all members, they are asked to donate a tithe of 10 percent of their income to the church. An exception to that rule is for LDS missionaries who work at the local level and are paid basic living expenses from a fund that receives contributions from their families or home congregations; however, prospective missionaries are encouraged to contribute the cost of their missions to this fund themselves when possible. Members volunteer general custodial work for local church facilities.

[[Image:LDS Conference Center interior panoramic.jpg|center|thumb|700px|Interior of the [[LDS Conference Center|Conference Center]] where the church holds its [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conferences]] twice a year.]]

All worthy males are generally considered for the [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] and are ordained to the priesthood as early as age 12. Ordination occurs by a ceremony where [[laying on of hands|hands are laid]] on the head of the one ordained. The priesthood is divided into an [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic Priesthood]] for young men 12 and up and a [[Melchizedek Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek Priesthood]] for men 18 and up.

===Programs and auxiliary organizations===
{{See also|Auxiliary organization (LDS Church)}}

Under the leadership of the priesthood hierarchy are five auxiliary organizations that fill various roles in the church: [[Relief Society]] (a women's organization),<ref>The [[Relief Society]] was founded in 1842 in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], and with the motto "Charity Never Faileth", the organization today includes more than 5 million women in more than 165 countries. {{Citation|url=http://lds.org/newsroom/showpackage/0,15367,3899-1--43-2-125,00.html|publisher=newsroom.lds.org|title=From Pioneer Group to Worldwide Society}}. Every Latter-day Saint woman age 18 or older is a member of the Relief Society.</ref> the [[Young Men organization|Young Men]] and [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women]] organizations (for adolescents ages 12 to 18), [[Primary (LDS Church)|Primary]] (an organization for children up to age 12), and [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] (which provides a variety of Sunday classes for adolescents and adults). Women serve as presidents and counselors in the presidencies of the Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary, while men serve as presidents and counselors of the Young Men and Sunday School.<ref>{{cite web|title=How the Church Is Organized|url=http://www.lds.org/church/organization/how-the-church-is-organized?lang=eng|work=lds.org|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=May 21, 2012}}</ref>  The church also operates several programs and organizations in the fields of proselytizing, education, and church welfare such as [[LDS Humanitarian Services]].  Many of these auxiliaries and programs are coordinated by the [[Priesthood Correlation Program]], which is designed to provide a systematic approach to maintain worldwide consistency, orthodoxy, and control of the church's ordinances, doctrines, organizations, meetings, materials, and other programs and activities.

[[Image:BYUclarillon.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Brigham Young University Centennial Carillon Tower|carillon tower]] at [[Brigham Young University]], one of several educational institutions sponsored by the church]]

The church operates a [[Church Educational System]] which includes [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) (and its associated [[Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center|Jerusalem Center]]), [[Brigham Young University–Idaho|BYU–Idaho]] (formerly Ricks College), [[Brigham Young University–Hawaii|BYU–Hawaii]], and [[LDS Business College]]. The church also operates [[Institute of Religion|Institutes of Religion]] and an [[LDS Student Association]] near the campuses of many colleges and universities.  For high-school aged youth, the church operates a four-year [[LDS Seminary|Seminary program]], which provides religious classes for students to supplement their secular education.  The church also sponsors a low-interest educational loan program known as the [[Perpetual Education Fund]], which provides educational opportunities to students from [[developing nations]].
[[File:LDS genealogy library slc utah.jpg|thumb|right|The church's [[Family History Library]] is the world's largest library dedicated to [[genealogy|genealogical research]]]]
The church's welfare system, initiated during the [[Great Depression]], provides aid to the poor. It is financed by [[fast offering]]s: monthly donations beyond the normal 10 percent tithe, which represents the cost of foregoing two meals on monthly [[Fast Sunday]]s. Money from the program is used to operate [[Bishop's storehouse]]s, which package and store food at low cost.  Distribution of funds and food is administered by local [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]] (congregational pastors).  The church also distributes money through its [[LDS Philanthropies]] division to disaster victims worldwide.

Other church programs and departments include [[LDS Family Services]], which provides assistance with [[adoption]], [[relationship counseling|marital and family counseling]], [[psychotherapy]], and [[intervention (counseling)|addiction counseling]]; the LDS Church History Department, which collects church history and records; and the Family History Department, which administers the church's large [[family history]] efforts, including the world's largest [[Family History Library|family history library]] and organization ([[FamilySearch]]).<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.intl-research.com/overview.htm |title=AAG International Research |author=AAG International Research |publisher=AAG |accessdate=October 31, 2009 }}</ref> The church is also a major sponsor of [[Scouting]] programs for boys, particularly in the United States, where it provides more [[Boy Scout|members]] of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] than any other church.<ref>{{Citation|title=Boy Scouts of America Membership Report&nbsp;– 2007 |date=January 7, 2008 |url=http://www.praypub.org/pdf_docs/BSA_Membership_Report_2007.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=P.R.A.Y. |accessdate=May 22, 2008}}</ref>

===Finances===

The church receives significant funds from [[tithe]]s (ten percent of a member's income) and [[fast offering]]s (money given to the church to assist individuals in need).  According to the church, tithing and fast offering moneys collected are devoted to ecclesiastical purposes and not used in for-profit ventures.

The church has also invested in for-profit business and real estate ventures such as [[Bonneville International]], [[Deseret Book Company]], and cattle ranches in Utah, Florida, Nebraska, Canada and other locations.<ref>Winter, Caroline (July 18, 2012). [http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-07-10/how-the-mormons-make-money "How the Mormons Make Money"]. ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''</ref> However, these ranches are split between the church's welfare work ([[Bishop's storehouse]] and [[Welfare Square]]) for which funds are used from tithing and are not for profit.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
Due to the differences in lifestyle promoted by church doctrine and history, a distinct culture has grown up around members of the church. It is primarily concentrated in the [[Intermountain West]], but as membership of the church spreads around the world, many of its more distinctive practices follow, such as adhering to the Word of Wisdom, a health law or code, similar to Leviticus chapter 11 in the Bible, prohibiting the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, coffee and tea, and illegal drugs.<ref name = wordofwisdom/> As a result of the Word of Wisdom, the culture in areas of the world with a high concentration of LDS tends to  be reflected.<ref>Salt Lake Tribune Editorial, [http://www.sltrib.com/ci_4903619 ''Liquor stores: Banning phone listings, stores won't stop abuse''].</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/living-well-usn/2008/12/15/americas-10-fittest-citiesand-10-least-fit-too.html |title=America's 10 Fittest Cities—and 10 Least Fit, Too |author= Megan Johnson |date=December 15, 2008 |accessdate=October 14, 2010}}</ref>

Meetings and outreach programs are held regularly and have become part of Latter-day Saint culture.

===Media and arts===
The culture has created substantial business opportunities for independent LDS media. Such communities include [[LDS cinema|cinema]], [[LDS fiction|fiction]], websites, and graphical art like photography and paintings. The church owns a chain of bookstores called [[Deseret Book]], which provide a channel through which publications are sold. Titles including ''[[The Work and the Glory]]'' and ''[[The Other Side of Heaven]]'' have found acceptance both within and outside the church; [[BYU TV]], the church-sponsored television station, also airs on several networks. The church also produces [[List of pageants of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|six pageants]] annually depicting various events of the primitive and modern-day church. Its [[Mesa Arizona Easter Pageant|Easter pageant ''Jesus the Christ'']] has been identified as the "largest annual outdoor Easter pageant in the world."<ref name="EVT">{{Citation | url = http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/86475 | title = Mesa Mormon temple prepares for Easter pageant |work=[[East Valley Tribune]] |date=March 24, 2007 |first=Lawn |last=Griffiths | accessdate =November 30, 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

===Home and family===
In 1995, the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and [[Quorum of the Twelve (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve]] issued "[[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]]", which stresses the importance of the family. The proclamation states that "[[Marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|marriage]] between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children." The document further says that "gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose," that the father and mother have differing but equal roles in raising children, and that successful marriages and families, founded upon the teachings of Jesus Christ, can last eternally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?sourceId=1aba862384d20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&vgnextoid=e1fa5f74db46c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0 |title=The Family: A Proclamation to the World |publisher=LDS Church |year=1995}}</ref>  This document is widely cited by LDS members as a statement of principle.<ref>Together forever: Gospel perspectives for marriage and family By Douglas E.

The adult women (members of the church's [[Relief Society]]) generally meet quarterly for additional instruction and service. The meetings may consist of a service project, conferences, or of various classes being offered.

After interviewing and polling thousands of youth across America, evangelical statistician Christian Smith writes, "... in general comparisons among major U.S. religious traditions using a variety of sociological measures of religious vitality and salience... it is Mormon teenagers who are sociologically faring the best."<ref>''Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers'', Authors: Christian Smith, Melinda Lundquist Denton, page 261 (Oxford University Press 2005)</ref>

In addition to these regularly scheduled meetings, additional meetings are frequently held at the meetinghouse. Auxiliary officers may conduct leadership meetings or host training sessions and classes. The ward or branch community may schedule social activities at the meetinghouse, including dances, dinners, holiday parties and musical presentations. The church's [[Young Men (organization)|Young Men]] and [[Young Women]] organizations (formerly known as the [[Mutual Improvement Association]] (MIA), or simply "Mutual") meet at the meetinghouse once a week, where the youth participate in activities and work on [[Duty to God Award|Duty to God]], [[Boy Scouts of America|Scouting]], or [[Personal Progress]]. Other popular activities are basketball, family history conferences, youth and singles conferences, dances, and various personal improvement classes. Church members may also reserve meetinghouses at no cost for weddings, receptions, and funerals.

===Political involvement===
The position of the LDS Church is that it will take no partisan role in politics, stating that it will not "endorse, promote or oppose political parties, candidates or platforms; allow its church buildings, membership lists or other resources to be used for partisan political purposes; attempt to direct its members as to which candidate or party they should give their votes to ... or attempt to direct or dictate to a government leader."<ref name="PN">{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-reemphasizes-political-neutrality|title=Church Reemphasizes Political Neutrality|date=December 6, 2007|publisher=LDS Newsroom|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}</ref> While the church takes an apolitical approach to the candidates themselves, it encourages its members to play a role as responsible citizens in their communities, including becoming informed about issues and voting in elections, and it actively works to counter anti-Mormonism that may come up during political campaigns. A 2012 [[Pew Center]] on Religion and Public Life survey indicates that 74% of U.S. members lean towards the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref name="ABC News">{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/pew-survey-most-mormons-feel-they-are-misunderstood-not-viewed-as-mainstream/|title=Majority of Mormons Lean Republican; Half Cite Discrimination Against Their Faith|date=January 12, 2012|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref> Some liberal members say they feel that they have to defend their worthiness due to political differences.<ref name="USA Today">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/10/30/mormon-liberals-minority/1669155/|title=Liberal Mormons: A Minority Within a Minority|date=October 30, 2012|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref>  Referring to the 2012 U.S Republican Presidential Primary [[Michael Otterson]], the LDS Church's managing director for public affairs stated, "We now have two Latter-day Saints running, and the potential for misunderstanding or missteps is therefore twice what it was before."<ref name=wsj20110803>{{cite news|last=Weisman|first=Jonathan|title=Mormons Duck Political Duel|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=August 3, 2011|pages=A1, A6|url=http://professional.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904772304576470442390289196.html?mod=WSJ_WSJ_US_News_5&mg=reno-wsj}}</ref> However, the official church stance on staying out of politics does not include what church leaders deem to be moral issues, such as opposing same-sex marriage in [[California Proposition 8#Religious organizations|California Prop 8]], supporting a gay rights bill in Salt Lake City which bans discrimination against homosexual persons in housing and employment,<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/us/12utah.html |title= Mormon Support of Gay Rights Statute Draws Praise |newspaper= The New York Times |date= 11 November 2009 |first= Kirk |last= Johnson }}</ref><ref>{{citation |url= http://newsroom.lds.org/article/statement-given-to-salt-lake-city-council-on-nondiscrimination-ordinances |title= Statement Given to Salt Lake City Council on Nondiscrimination Ordinances |date= 1 January 2009 |work= Newsroom |publisher= LDS Church }}</ref> opposing gambling, and supporting the [[Utah Compact]].

In United States politics, there were 15 members of the church serving in the [[112th United States Congress]], including the [[United States Senate|Senate]] Majority Leader, [[Harry Reid]],<ref name = "LDSList">Sarah Jane Weaver, [http://www.ldschurchnews.com/articles/60334/15-Mormons-serving-in-US-Congress.html "15 Mormons serving in U.S. Congress"]  ''[[Church News]]'', January 8, 2011.</ref> as well as one member serving as a [[Governor (United States)|state governor]] ([[Gary Herbert]], [[Governor of Utah|Utah]]).<ref name = "LDSList" /> Church member [[Mitt Romney]] was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s nominee in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|U.S. 2012 presidential election]] and was defeated by incumbent US President [[Barack Obama]].

==Humanitarian services==

{{See also|LDS Philanthropies|LDS Humanitarian Services}}
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is widely known for its worldwide [[humanitarianism|humanitarian services]]. The church's extensive welfare system, [[LDS Philanthropies]], is a branch of the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishopric]]. Initiated during the [[Great Depression]], it provides aid for the poor, financed by donations from church members. It is responsible for philanthropic donations to the LDS Church and other affiliated charities, such as the [[Church History Library]], [[Brigham Young University]] and the [[Church Educational System]], the [[Perpetual Education Fund]], the [[Polynesian Cultural Center]], the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]], and efforts dedicated to providing funds for [[missionary (LDS Church)|LDS missionaries]] and [[temple (LDS Church)|temple]] construction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ldsphilanthropies.org/ |title=LDS Philanthropies: Helping Change and Save Lives |publisher=[[LDS Philanthropies]]}}</ref> Money from the program is also used to operate [[bishop's storehouse]]s, which package and store food for the poor at low cost. Distribution of funds and food is administered by local [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]]. These local storehouses distribute commodities to the needy as requested by local bishops on a "Bishop's Order for Commodities" form (referred to as a bishop's order). Bishop's storehouses also provide service opportunities for those receiving assistance and for those desiring to serve missions or to volunteer in the church's welfare program. The day-to-day operations of the storehouses are run by elder missionaries as store managers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://apps.lds.org/welfareoperations/overview.jsf?operation=bishops.storehouses |title=Overview of Bishops’ Storehouses |publisher=LDS Church}}</ref>

The church also distributes money through its [[LDS Humanitarian Services|Humanitarian Services]] division to natural disaster victims worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.lds.org/article/annual-report-highlights-church-emergency-relief |title=Annual Report Highlights Church Emergency Relief |date=March 9, 2011 |publisher=LDS Newsroom}}</ref> The church's Humanitarian Center, established in 1991, prepares emergency relief supplies for worldwide shipment to disaster victims, works to establish a global sense of self-reliance, and offers service opportunities to both church members and non-members. The emergency relief supplies that the church donates typically include clothing, personal care kits, and medical supplies. According to the LDS Humanitarian Center website, it ships about 12 million pounds of shoes and clothing, 1 million hygiene kits, and 1 million pounds of medical supplies per year, to relieve suffering in more than 100 countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/service/humanitarian/center?lang=eng |title=Humanitarian Center |publisher=LDS Church}}</ref> When a disaster strikes, the church works with local government officials and other organizations to determine the immediate needs, and sends the necessary supplies and food to the affected area within hours. Missionaries are then sent to help alleviate other long-term damages by assisting injured persons and reconstructing damaged buildings. The church works in these efforts without regard to the nationality or religion of the recipients, and 100 percent of the financial contributions donated to the church by members and non-members are used for humanitarian purposes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.lds.org/topic/humanitarian-services |title=Humanitarian Services |publisher=LDS Newsroom}}</ref>

The church has been involved in providing relief aid for victims of several disasters in recent years, including [[Hurricane Katrina]],<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]|title=Church Providing Relief to Hurricane Katrina Victims|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/news-releases-stories/church-providing-relief-to-hurricane-katrina-victims|date=September 1, 2005|accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Latter-day Saints to Mobilize Another 4,000 Volunteers in Chainsaw Brigade’s Second Wave|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/news-releases-stories/latter-day-saints-to-mobilize-another-4-000-volunteers-in-chainsaw-brigade-s-second-wave|date=September 16, 2005|accessdate=January 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mormon Helping Hands Make a Difference|publisher=[[Meridian Magazine]]|url=http://www.meridianmagazine.com/articles/051020helpinghands.html|year=2005|accessdate=January 18, 2010}}</ref> the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/haiti-relief/relief/landing.htm |title=Haiti Efforts: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti |publisher=LDS Church |date=February 12, 2010}}</ref> the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/church/news/christchurch-members-faith-remains-unshaken-as-recovery-continues?lang=eng |title=Christchurch Members’ Faith Remains Unshaken as Recovery Continues |date=April 7, 2011 |publisher=LDS.org |accessdate=June 12, 2011}}</ref> and the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.lds.org/article/church-update-on-response-to-japan-earthquake-and-tsunami |title=Church Update on Response to Japan Earthquake and Tsunami |publisher=LDS Newsroom |date=March 14, 2011 |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}</ref> In 2005 the church partnered with [[Catholic Relief Services]] to provide aid for struggling families and individuals in Niger,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/600155028/LDS-Catholic-aid-for-Niger.html |title=LDS-Catholic aid for Niger |publisher=[[Deseret News]] |date=March 11, 2005 |author=Carrie A.

==Controversy and criticism==
{{See also|Criticism of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The LDS Church has been subject to criticism and sometimes [[Anti-Mormonism|discrimination]] since its early years in New York and [[Pennsylvania]]. In the late&nbsp;1820s, criticism centered around the claim by Joseph Smith to have been led to a set of golden plates from which the Book of Mormon was reputedly translated.

In the 1830s, the greatest criticism was for Smith's handling of a [[Kirtland Safety Society|banking failure]] in Kirtland, Ohio, and the LDS Church's political and military power in Missouri, culminating in the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]]. In the 1840s, criticism of the church centered on the church's [[theodemocracy|theocratic]] aspirations in Nauvoo, Illinois. Criticism of the practice of plural marriage and other doctrines taught by Smith appeared in the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]]'', which led to a series of events culminating in [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith's murder]] in 1844.
[[Image:Prop8templeProtest.jpg|thumb|left|Protesters in front of the [[Newport Beach California Temple]] voicing their opposition to the church's support of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Prop 8]]]]

As the church began openly practicing [[plural marriage]] under Brigham Young during the second half of the 19th century, the church became the target of nation-wide criticism for that practice (which was banned by the church in 1890), as well as for the church's theocratic aspirations in the Utah Territory. Beginning in 1857, the church also came under [[Mountain Meadows massacre and the media|significant media criticism]] after the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] in southern Utah.

Academic critics have questioned the legitimacy of Smith as a prophet as well as the [[Criticism of the Book of Mormon|historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Abraham]]. Criticism has expanded to include claims of historical revisionism, homophobia, racism, and sexist policies. Notable 20th-century critics include [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] and [[Fawn Brodie]]. [[Evangelical Christians]] continue to argue that Smith was either fraudulent or [[delusion]]al. [[Mormon apologetics]] organizations, such as the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] (FAIR) and the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), have been founded to counter these criticisms. Most of the apologetic work focuses on providing and discussing evidence supporting the claims of Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon, and much of it features criticism of the perceived lack of honesty when it comes to the scholarship of non-Mormon critics. Scholars and authors such as [[Hugh Nibley]], [[Daniel C. Peterson]], [[Jeff Lindsay (engineer)|Jeff Lindsay]], [[Orson Scott Card]], and [[James E. Talmage]] are well-known apologists both within and without the church.

In recent years, the Internet has provided a new forum for proponents and critics of religions, including the LDS Church.<ref>
