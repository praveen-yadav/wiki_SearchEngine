==Career==

===Early years===
[[File:Bruce Campbell .jpg|thumb|right|Campbell signing a VHS copy of ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' at a fan meet-and-greet]]
Bruce Campbell began acting as a teenager and soon began making short [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] movies with friends. After meeting [[Sam Raimi]] in [[Wylie E. Groves High School]], the two became very good friends and started making movies together. Campbell would go on to attend [[Western Michigan University]] while he continued to work on his acting career. Campbell and Raimi collaborated on a 30-minute Super 8 version of the first ''Evil Dead'' film, titled ''Within the Woods'', which was initially used to attract investors.

===Major film roles===
A few years later, Campbell and Raimi got together with family and friends and began work on ''[[The Evil Dead]]''. Campbell starred and worked behind the camera, receiving a "co-executive producer" credit. Raimi wrote, directed and edited, while fellow Michigander [[Robert Tapert|Rob Tapert]] was producer. Following an endorsement by horror writer [[Stephen King]], the film slowly began to receive distribution. Four years following its original release, it became the number one movie in the UK. It then received distribution in the U.S., spawning two [[sequel]]s: ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' and ''[[Army of Darkness]]''. Campbell's role as [[Ash Williams|Ashley J. "Ash" Williams]] has since become iconic. The first two films in the series are considered horror classics and are credited with spawning the "horror comedy" genre.

He was also drawn in the Marvel Zombie comics as his character, [[Ash Williams]]. He is featured in five comics, all in the series ''Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness''. In the comics he fights alongside the Marvel heroes against the heroes and people who have turned into zombies (deadites) while in search of the [[Necronomicon]] (Book of the Dead).

He has appeared in many of Raimi's films outside of the ''Evil Dead'' series, notably cameo roles in the ''[[Spider-Man]]'' [[Spider-Man in film|film series]]. Bruce Campbell also joined the cast in Raimi's ''[[Darkman]]'' and ''[[The Quick and the Dead (1995 film)|The Quick and the Dead]]'', though having no actual screen time in the latter film's theatrical cut.

Campbell often takes on quirky roles, such as [[Elvis Presley]] in the film ''[[Bubba Ho-tep]]'', and appears in B-Movies and starred in ''[[My Name Is Bruce]]''. Along with ''Bubba Ho-tep'', he also played a supporting role in ''[[Sky High (2005 film)|Sky High]]'',  He also was featured in the [[Jim Carrey]] drama ''[[The Majestic (film)|The Majestic]]''. Campbell also had a key supporting role in the [[Coen Brothers]] film ''[[The Hudsucker Proxy]]''. Campbell was also the star of the ''[[Maniac Cop]]'' B-movie series.

Other roles in mainstream films for Campbell included the [[Michael Crichton]] adaptation ''[[Congo (film)|Congo]]'', the film version of ''[[McHale's Navy (film)|McHale's Navy]]'', and ''[[Escape From L.A.]]'', the sequel to [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Escape From New York]]''.

Campbell had a starring voice role in the hit [[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|2009 animated adaptation]] of the children's book ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]'', and ''[[Cars 2]]''.

In January 2010, he stated in an interview that his new film project is called ''Bruce vs. Frankenstein''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35405/bruce-campbell-vs-frankenstein-gimme-some-stitches-baby |title=Bruce Campbell Vs. Frankenstein! Gimme Some Stitches, Baby! }}</ref> The film is directed and produced by his friend Mike Richardson.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/43676 |title=Listen up, screwheads! Bruce Campbell has a message for ya'! }}</ref>

Campbell produced the [[Evil Dead (2013 film)|remake]] of ''The Evil Dead'', along with Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert. Campbell made an appearance that may allude to his signature character, Ash and will reprise his role in Army of Darkness 2.<ref>[http://comicbook.com/blog/2013/10/18/bruce-campbell-confirms-he-will-do-army-of-darkness-sequel/ Bruce Campbell Confirms He Will Do Army Of Darkness Sequel]</ref>

He starred in the television series ''[[Jack of All Trades (TV series)|Jack of All Trades]]'', set on a fictional island, occupied by the French in 1801. Campbell was also credited as co-executive producer, among others. The show was directed by [[Eric Gruendemann]], and was produced by various people, including [[Sam Raimi]].

When working under cover, he frequently goes by the alias Chuck Finley. During Comic-Con 2010, it was revealed that Campbell would be the star of a ''Burn Notice'' made-for-television [[prequel]] focusing on Sam's Navy SEAL career, titled ''[[Burn Notice: The Fall of Sam Axe]]''. The movie was first aired on April 17, 2011.<ref>[http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2010/07/burn-notice.html The Chicago Tribune]</ref>

===Writing===
[[File:If Chins Could Kill Cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Bruce Campbell, ''If Chins Could Kill'']]
In addition to acting and occasionally directing, Campbell has become a writer, starting with an autobiography, ''If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor'', published on August 24, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/If_Chins_Could_Kill.html?id=g8zheCbYg1oC|title=Google Books|work=Books.google.com}}</ref> The autobiography was a successful [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/07/08/bsp/besthardnonfiction.html | work=The New York Times |title=The New York Times}}</ref> The paperback version of the book adds a chapter about the reaction of fans at book signings.
<blockquote>Whenever I do mainstream stuff, I think they're pseudo-interested, but they're still interested in seeing weirdo, offbeat stuff. And that's what I'm attracted to.</blockquote>
''If Chins Could Kill'' follows Campbell's career to date as an actor in low-budget films and television, providing his insight into "Blue-Collar Hollywood".

Campbell's next book, ''[[Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way]]'' was published on May 26, 2005. The book's plot involves Bruce (depicted in a comical way) as the main character struggling to make it into the world of [[A-list]] movies. He later recorded an [[radio drama|audio play]] adaptation of ''Make Love'' with fellow Michigan actors, including longtime collaborator [[Ted Raimi]]. This radio drama was released through the independent label Rykodisc and spans 6 discs with a 6-hour running time.

In addition to his novels, Campbell also wrote a column for ''[[X Ray Magazine]]'' in 2001, an issue of the popular comic series ''[[The Hire]]'', and comic book adaptations of his ''Man with the Screaming Brain''. Most recently he wrote the introduction to [[Josh Becker]]'s ''The Complete Guide to Low-Budget Feature Filmmaking''.

Campbell maintained a blog on his official website, where he posted mainly about politics and the film industry.<ref>[http://www.bruce-campbell.com/blog.asp Bruce Campbell blog]</ref> The blog has since been discontinued.
