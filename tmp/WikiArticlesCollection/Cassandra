In [[Greek mythology]], '''Cassandra''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Κασσάνδρα}}, also {{lang|grc|Κασάνδρα}})<ref>[[Hjalmar Frisk]] (1970) notes "unexplained etymology", citing "various hypotheses" found in Schulze ''Kleine Schriften'' (1966), 698, Hoffmann ''Glotta'' 28, 52, Sturtevant ''Class. Phil.'' 21, 248f., J. Davreux ''La légende de la prophétesse Cassandre'' (Paris 1942) 90ff., Carnoy ''Les ét. class.'' 22, 344.</ref> was the daughter of King [[Priam]] and Queen [[Hecuba]] of [[Troy]].  She had the power of [[prophecy]] and the curse of never being believed. A common version of her story is that [[Apollo]] gave her the power of prophecy to seduce her, and then cursed her when he failed. In an alternate version, she fell asleep in a temple, and snakes licked her ears so that she was able to hear the future (this is a recurring theme in Greek mythology, though sometimes it brings an ability to understand the language of animals rather than an ability to know the future).<ref>Compare [[Melampus]]; Athena cleaned the ears of [[Tiresias]]</ref> When Cassandra refused Apollo's attempted [[seduction]], he placed a curse on her so that her predictions and those of all her descendants would not be believed. She is a figure of both [[Epic Cycle|epic tradition]] and of [[Greek tragedy|tragedy]].

== History ==
[[File:Woodcut illustration of Cassandra's prophecy of the fall of Troy (at left) and her death (at right) - Penn Provenance Project.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut illustration of Cassandra's prophecy of the fall of Troy (at left) and her death (at right), from an incunable German translation by [[Heinrich Steinhowel|Heinrich Steinhöwel]] of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[De mulieribus claris]], printed by [[Johann Zainer]] at Ulm ca. 1474.]]

Historically, Cassandra was the daughter of King [[Priam]] (Priamos) and Queen [[Hecuba]] (Hekabe) and the fraternal twin sister of [[Helenus]].  

According to legend, Cassandra was a beautiful girl with red hair kept in curls, blue eyes, and fair skin. She is portrayed as intelligent, charming, desirable, elegant, friendly, and gentle - however, towards the end  of her life, she was regarded as mentally unstable. Cassandra was described as the "second most beautiful woman in the world." Her beauty was even compared to that of [[Aphrodite]] and [[Helen of Troy]].

In [[Greek Mythology|Mythic tradition]], Cassandra's ability to hear the future, combined with Apollo's curse that she not be believed, created a source of endless pain and frustration to her.  In some versions of the myth, this is symbolized by the god spitting into her mouth; in other Greek versions, this act was sufficient to remove the gift so recently given by Apollo, but Cassandra's case varies.  From [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[The Oresteia|Agamemnon]]'', it appears that she has made a promise to Apollo to become his consort, but broke it, thus incurring his wrath: though she has retained the power of foresight, no one will believe her predictions.

While Cassandra foresaw the destruction of Troy (she warned the Trojans about the [[Trojan Horse]], the death of [[Agamemnon]], and her own demise), she was unable to do anything to forestall these tragedies since no one believed her. [[Coroebus]] and [[Othronus]] came to the aid of Troy out of love for Cassandra.  Cassandra was also the first to see the body of her brother [[Hector]] being brought back to the city.

At the fall of Troy, she sought shelter in the temple of [[Athena]], where she was violently abducted and [[rape]]d by [[Ajax the Lesser]].  Cassandra was then taken as a [[concubine]] by King [[Agamemnon]] of [[Mycenae]]. Unbeknownst to Agamemnon, while he was away at war, his wife, [[Clytemnestra]], had begun an affair with [[Aegisthus]]. <!--Upon Agamemnon and Cassandra's arrival in Mycenae, Clytemnestra asked her husband to walk across a [[purple]] (some versions say red) tapestry, a sign of [[hubris]].  He initially refused, fearing the wrath of the gods, but gave in, ignoring Cassandra's warnings. By walking on the tapestries, he was committing sacrilege.-->  Clytemnestra and Aegisthus then murdered both Agamemnon and Cassandra. Some sources mention that Cassandra and Agamemnon had twin boys, Teledamus and Pelops, both of whom were killed by Aegisthus.
<!--CAN WE GET A REFERENCE?[[Telephos]], the son of Heracles, loved Cassandra{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} but she scorned him and instead helped him seduce her sister [[Laodice]].-->

==''Agamemnon'' by Aeschylus==

In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia|Agamemnon]]'', the king, treading the scarlet cloth laid down for him, walks offstage to his sure death at line 972. After the chorus's ode of foreboding, time is suspended in Cassandra's "[[mad scene]]".<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Seth L. |last=Schein |title=The Cassandra Scene in Aeschylus' 'Agamemnon' |journal=Greece & Rome |series=Second Series |volume=29 |issue=1 |year=1982 |pages=11–16 |doi=10.1017/S0017383500028278 }}</ref> She has been onstage, silent and ignored.

"She evokes the same awe, horror and pity as do [[schizophrenics]]", an observer<ref>Schein 1982:12</ref> has noted, "who often combine deep, true insight with utter helplessness, and who retreat into madness." Eduard Fraenkel remarked<ref>Fraenkel, ''Kleine Beiträge zur klassische Philologie'' , vol. I (Rome) 1964, 344-48, 375-87, noted in Schein 1982:11 note 6</ref> on the powerful contrasts between declaimed and sung dialogue in this scene. The frightened and respectful chorus are unable to comprehend her. She goes to her inevitable offstage murder by [[Clytemnestra]] with full knowledge of what is to befall her.<ref>Analyses of the Cassandra scene are in [[Bernard Knox]] ''Word and Action: Eassays on the Ancient theatre'' (Baltimore and London: Penguin) 1979:42-55; and more briefly, in Anne Lebeck, ''The Oresteia: A study in language and structure'' (Washington) 1971:52-58.</ref>

== Modern adaptations ==
A modern psychological perspective on Cassandra is presented by [[Eric Shanower]] in ''[[Age of Bronze (comics)|Age of Bronze: Sacrifice]]''. In this version, Cassandra, as a child, is assaulted by a priest of [[Apollo]].

In the DC comic ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'', Delirium, one of The Endless, has some form of prophetic knowledge but due to her chaotic nature, her prophecies almost never make sense until it is too late and no other character recognizes them.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

A similar situation occurred in [[Lindsay Clarke]]'s novel ''The Return from Troy'' (presented as a reawakened memory), where a priest of Apollo forced himself upon Cassandra and was stopped only when she spat in his mouth. When the priest used his benevolent reputation to convince Priam that he was innocent of her wild claims, Cassandra subsequently went insane.

The story of Cassandra is also retold by German author [[Christa Wolf]] in ''[[Cassandra (novel)|Kassandra]]''. She retells the story from the point of view of Cassandra at the moment of her death and uses the tale as an allegory for both the unheard voice of the woman writer and the oppression and strict censorship in [[East Germany]].

Cassandra is the main protagonist of the eponymous play by the Ukrainian author [[Lesya Ukrainka]].

The author [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] wrote a fantasy novel called ''[[The Firebrand]]'', which presents a story from Cassandra's point of view.
Marcus Sedgwick's novel ''The Foreshadowing'' features a [[protagonist]] named Alexandra who has the gift of foresight, though she sees mainly others' pain and death.{{citation needed|date= February 2012}}

In [[David Gemmell]]'s Troy trilogy, Cassandra is credited with opening the mind of exiled Egyptian prince Gershom (Moses) to his own gift of prophecy. Cassandra got her gift after suffering from 'brain-fever' as a young child, and dies in the [[Minoan eruption|volcanic eruption of Thera]].

In the section ''Cassandra'' of ''Suggestions for Thought to Searchers after Religious Truth'', [[Florence Nightingale]] protests the over-feminization of women into near helplessness, such as what Nightingale saw in her mother's and older sister's lethargic lifestyle despite their education. The work also reflects her fear of her ideas being ineffective, as were Cassandra's.

In [[Hector Berlioz]]’s opera ''[[Les Troyens]]'' (1863), based on Virgil's ''[[The Aeneid]]'', Cassandra commits suicide with other Trojan women as Troy falls, rather than being raped by Ajax. She dies with the word “Italy” on her lips, presaging (in prophetess mode) her cousin [[Aeneas]]’s eventual founding of Rome.
This is a role written for a dramatic [[mezzosoprano]], whose most important interpreters in the last years were singers like [[Petra Lang]], [[Jessye Norman]] and [[Anna Caterina Antonacci]].

In the 2001-2011 television series ''[[Smallville]]'', the Season 1 episode "Hourglass" features a character named "Cassandra Carver" (played by [[Jackie Burroughs]]), an elderly woman who can see the future.

In the 1997-2003 television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', the seventh season episode "[[Help (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Help]]" features a character named "Cassie Newton" (played by [[Azura Skye]]), a teenage girl who can see the future, such as her own death, her best friend's history test results, the protagonist [[Buffy Summers]]' future battle with [[First Evil|The First]] in "[[Chosen (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Chosen]]," etc.{{citation needed|date = February 2012}}

In ''[[The Secret Series]]'' by [[Pseudonymous Bosch]], the narrator gives each character a fake name to hide their identity (for the characters' protection). The name he gives the main protagonist is "Cassandra", or "Cass" for short, naming her after Cassandra of the myth, as Cass is always predicting dangerous events.

An episode of [[BBC]] science fiction sit-com ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' called '[[Cassandra (Red Dwarf)|Cassandra]]' depicts the ship's crew dealing with a computer called 'Cassandra' who can predict the future with "an accuracy rating of 100%."

Cassandra appears as a main character in Disney's ''[[Hercules (1998 TV series)|Hercules]]'' voiced by [[Sandra Bernhard]]. She appears as a friend of Hercules and [[Icarus]]. Like in mythology, she could foresee the future and was generally unbelieved until the event happens. This has caused her to be pessimistic to humorous levels.

In J.K. Rowling's [[Harry Potter]] series, [[Hogwarts staff#Sybill Trelawney|the Divination professor]] is said to be the great-great-granddaughter of "the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney." (See: ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', chapter 15)

In Theresa Tomlinson's novel "The Moon Rider," Cassandra becomes a Moon Rider and is presented as Trojan princess promised to Apollo.

The musical group '[[ABBA]]' has a song named "Cassandra" including the lyrics "But none of us would listen to words of warning", and "Sorry Cassandra, I didn't believe you really had the power; I only saw it as dreams you would weave, until the final hour."

Norwegian gothic metal band, [[Theatre of Tragedy]] wrote a song titled "Cassandra" on their 1998 album, [[Aégis]]. Each song on the album dealt with a famous female figure in folklore or mythology.

The artist [[Emmy the Great]] has a song called "Cassandra" on her second album, "Virtue". The song refers to Cassandra's prophetic power and inability to change the future: "And daily, you saw it come, And you gave warning but couldn't run, And so you watched until it was broken, And knew that foresight delays no motion."

In the 1997 horror film, [[Scream 2]], the main character of [[Sidney Prescott]] plays the title role of Cassandra in her college's play about the myth. She is shown rehearsing a scene from after the fall of Troy.

In [[Sheri S. Tepper]]'s post-apocalyptic novel ''[[The Gate to Women's Country]]'', the women put on a performance of a play entitled "Iphigenia at Ilium", which tells the story of the Siege of Troy from the point of view of the women in the story, including Cassandra. Cassandra appears as a ghost in the play.

In the film ''[[12 Monkeys]]'', Cassandra is referenced by a protagonist who has difficulty believing a time-traveler from the future.

In the Dresden Files series, the protagonist meets a character afflicted with Cassandra's Tears, well known in-universe among the supernatural community. The victim is seized with visions of the future, which always come to pass but are never believed by others. The condition itself might be considered a Cassandra affliction, in addition to the visions - there is no physical or psychic evidence of it on a person, so others often do not believe that they have it.

In the 1995 film, ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'', one of the Greek Chorus is Cassandra.

== Modern usage ==

In more modern literature, Cassandra has often served as a model for [[tragedy]] and [[romance (heroic literature)|romance]], and has given rise to the archetypal character of someone whose prophetic insight is obscured by insanity, turning their revelations into riddles or disjointed statements that are not fully comprehended until after the fact.

In his 2011 novel ''The Diviner's Tale'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Morrow|first=Bradford|title=The Diviner's Tale|url=http://www.bradfordmorrow.com/divinerstale.html|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> [[Bradford Morrow]] names the protagonist Cassandra. She is a Diviner, also called a water-witch or dowser, who finds spots for wells and ponds in the back country, for farmers and developers. Cassandra foretells a murder that seems unlikely at first, and then impossible, but finally proves to be prophetic and leads to the discovery of a serial murderer.

A manga called "Uncassandra" by Hifumishi Gorou refers to Cassandra's prophetic ability and stars two people who have the ability to predict disasters, but who decide to sabotage their own prophecies and prevent the disasters they've seen from occurring.
