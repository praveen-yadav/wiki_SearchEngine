During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of CEO and [[software architect|chief software architect]], and remains the largest individual shareholder, with 6.4 percent of the [[common stock]].{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | Gates regularly documents his share ownership through public U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission [[form 4]] filings.<ref>{{Citation | title = MSFT | url = http://www.nasdaq.com/asp/holdings.asp?symbol=MSFT&selected=MSFT&FormType=form4 | publisher = NASDAQ | type = Holdings}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = MSFT | publisher = NASDAQ | type = Symbol | url = http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/msft}}</ref>}}  He has also authored and co-authored several books.

Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the [[personal computer revolution]].  Gates has been [[Criticism of Microsoft|criticized for his business tactics]], which have been considered anti-competitive, an opinion which has in some cases been upheld by the courts.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p=459}}{{Sfn |Lesinski|2006|p = 96}}  In the later stages of his career, Gates has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors, donating large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]], established in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/ | title = Gates foundation | archiveurl = http://archive.is/20120523/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/ | archivedate = May 23, 2012}}</ref>

Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000. He remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself. In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work, and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He gradually transferred his duties to [[Ray Ozzie]], chief software architect, and [[Craig Mundie]], chief research and strategy officer. Gates's last full-time day at Microsoft was June 27, 2008. He remains at Microsoft as chairman.

==Early life==
Gates was born in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], to [[William H. Gates, Sr.]] and [[Mary Maxwell Gates]].  His ancestry includes English, [[Germans|German]], and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wargs.com/other/gates.html |title=Ancestry of Bill Gates |publisher=Wargs |accessdate=June 9, 2010 |archiveurl = http://archive.is/20120916/http://www.wargs.com/other/gates.html | archivedate= September 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Scottish Americans | publisher= Alba West | url = http://www.albawest.com/scottish-americans.html | accessdate =April 29, 2009 |archiveurl= http://archive.is/20120718/http://www.albawest.com/scottish-americans.html | archivedate = July 18, 2012}}</ref> His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for [[First Interstate BancSystem]] and the [[United Way of America|United Way]].  Gates's maternal grandfather was JW Maxwell, a [[National bank#United States|national bank]] president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He was the fourth of his name in his family, but was known as William Gates III or "Trey" because his father had the "II" suffix.{{Sfn |Manes | 1994 |p= 15}}  Early on in his life, Gates's parents had a law career in mind for him.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p = 47}}  When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a [[Congregational Christian Churches|Congregational]] church.<ref name="Congregational 1">{{cite book|title=Bill Gates: Entrepreneur and Philanthropist | url = http://books.google.com/?id=ubYgIB0TgUYC&pg=PA12&dq=Bill+Gates+Congregationalist#v=onepage&q&f=false |quote = The Gates family regularly went to services at the University Congregational Church.| first =Jeanne M | last = Lesinski |publisher=Twenty First Century Books | accessdate =March 10, 2011|isbn= 978-1-58013-570-2|date = September 1, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Congregational 2">{{cite book|title=Bill Gates Speaks: Insight from the World's Greatest Entrepreneur|url = http://books.google.com/?id=LUwu-DTwa5cC&pg=PA3&dq=Congregationalist++bill+gates#v=onepage&q&f=false |quote = The Gates family attended the University Congregational Church, where the Reverend Dale Turner was pastor. | first = Janet | last = Lowe| publisher = Wiley | accessdate=March 10, 2011|isbn= 978-0-471-40169-8|date = January 5, 2001}}</ref><ref name = "Congregational 3">{{cite book| title = Something Happened: A Political and Cultural Overview of the Seventies | url =http://books.google.com/?id=tsl3EVBtdxcC&pg=PA228&dq=Congregationalist++bill+gates#v=onepage&q&f=false|quote=Bill Gates was a member of the baby boom, born in 1955 into an upper-middle-class family near Seattle."

At 13 he enrolled in the [[Lakeside School]], an exclusive preparatory school.{{Sfn | Manes| 1994| p = 24}}  When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's [[rummage sale]] to buy a [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a [[General Electric]] (GE) computer for the school's students.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p= 27}}  Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of [[tic-tac-toe]] that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, "There was just something neat about the machine."{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 12}}  After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] minicomputers. One of these systems was a [[PDP-10]] belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students—Gates, [[Paul Allen]], [[Ric Weiland]], and Kent Evans—for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the [[operating system]] to obtain free computer time.{{Sfn | Manes | 1994|p = 34}}<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2044825/paul-allen-spills-beans-gates-criminal-past | title = V3 | title = Paul Allen spills the beans on Gates’ criminal past | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]]}}</ref>

At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for computer time. Rather than use the system via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied [[source code]] for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in [[Fortran]], [[Lisp]], and [[machine language]]. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in [[Cobol]], providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with "a disproportionate number of interesting girls."<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.gatesfoundation.org/media-center/speeches/2005/09/bill-gates-lakeside-school | title = Remarks by Bill Gates, co-chair | accessdate = July 13, 2013 | work = Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation -  Press Room, Speeches}}</ref> He later stated that "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success."{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 12}}  At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called [[Traf-O-Data]], to make [[traffic counter]]s based on the [[Intel 8008]] processor.{{Sfn |Gates|1996| p= 14}}  In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the US House of Representatives.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.ushpaa.org/history.php | title = Congressional Page History | publisher = The United States House Page Association of America | quote = The Page Program has produced many politicians, Members of Congress, as well as other famous men and women.

Gates graduated from Lakeside School in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the [[SAT]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://theweekmagazine.com/article.aspx?id=803 | title=The new—and improved?—SAT | accessdate =May 23, 2006 | work =The Week Magazine|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060510205250/http://theweekmagazine.com/article.aspx?id=803 | archivedate = May 10, 2006| deadurl=yes}}</ref> and enrolled at [[Harvard College]] in the autumn of 1973.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 15}}  While at Harvard, he met [[Steve Ballmer]], who later succeeded Gates as CEO of Microsoft.

Gates did not have a definite study plan while a student at Harvard{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 19}} and spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at [[Honeywell]] during the summer of 1974.{{Sfn |Wallace| 1993| p = 59}}  The following year saw the release of the [[MITS Altair 8800]] based on the [[Intel 8080|Intel 8080 CPU]], and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.{{Sfn |Gates|1996| p= 18}}  Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nndb.com/people/435/000022369/ |title= Bill Gates | publisher = NNDb |accessdate= August 24, 2012 | archiveurl = http://archive.is/20120524/http://www.nndb.com/people/435/000022369/ |archivedate=May 24, 2012}}</ref> He had talked this decision over with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much Gates wanted to start a company.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 19}}

===BASIC===
[[File:Altair 8800 Computer.jpg|thumb|left|MITS Altair 8800 Computer with {{Convert |8|in|mm|adj=on}} floppy disk system]]
After reading the January 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' that demonstrated the [[Altair 8800]], Gates contacted [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems]] (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a [[BASIC]] interpreter for the platform.<ref name="keyevents">{{cite journal | title=Microsoft Visitor Center Student Information: Key Events in Microsoft History | url = http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc |publisher=Microsoft | format=.DOC |accessdate=February 18, 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080226224212/http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc | archivedate= February 26, 2008 | deadurl = no}}</ref> In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president [[Ed Roberts (computers)|Ed Roberts]] agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair [[emulator]] that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as [[Altair BASIC]]. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,<ref name="thocp1">{{cite web | title= Microsoft history|publisher= The History of Computing Project | url=http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm | accessdate= March 31, 2008 | archiveurl = http://archive.is/20120523/http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |archivedate=May 23, 2012}}</ref> and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership "Micro-Soft" and had their first office located in Albuquerque.<ref name=thocp1/> Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name "Microsoft" was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the [[New Mexico|State of New Mexico]].<ref name=thocp1/> Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.

Microsoft's BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]] in the MITS newsletter saying that MITS could not continue to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software without payment.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p=81}}  This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.<ref name="thocp1" /> The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]], Washington on January 1, 1979.<ref name="keyevents" />

During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business.  Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.<ref name="waterloo">{{cite speech|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/10-13Waterloo.aspx | last = Gates|first= William ‘Bill’ |title= Remarks | date= October 13, 2005| location= Waterloo, [[Ontario|ON]] | accessdate = March 31, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080406130809/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/10-13Waterloo.aspx | archivedate= April 6, 2008 | deadurl = no}}</ref>

===IBM partnership===
[[IBM]] approached Microsoft in July 1980 regarding its upcoming personal computer, the [[IBM PC]].{{r |bunnell1982febmar}}  The computer company first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter.  When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to [[Digital Research]] (DRI), makers of the widely used [[CP/M]] operating system.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html |title=Pioneers Die Broke|work=Forbes| last =Maiello | first = John Steele Gordon Michael |date=December 23, 2002|accessdate =March 31, 2008 |archiveurl = http://archive.is/20120916/http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html |archivedate = September 16, 2012}}</ref>  IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later Gates proposed using [[86-DOS]] (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that [[Tim Paterson]] of [[Seattle Computer Products]] (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as [[PC DOS]] in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 54}}

Gates did not offer to transfer the [[copyright]] on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 54}} They did, and the sales of [[MS-DOS]] made Microsoft a major player in the industry.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p=193}}  Despite IBM's name on the operating system the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer, with ''PC Magazine'' asking if Gates were "The Man Behind The Machine?"<ref name="bunnell1982febmar">{{cite news | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=w_OhaFDePS4C&lpg=RA2-PA18&pg=PA16#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Man Behind The Machine? | type = interview | work=PC Magazine | month = Feb–Mar | year = 1982 | accessdate = February 17, 2012 | last = Bunnell | first = David | page= 16}}</ref> He oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates President of Microsoft and the Chairman of the Board.<ref name="keyevents" />

===Windows===
Microsoft launched its first retail version of [[Microsoft Windows]] on November 20, 1985, and in August, the company struck a deal with [[IBM]] to develop a separate operating system called [[OS/2]]. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate. It ended in 1991, when Gates led Microsoft to develop a version of OS/2 independently from IBM.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://groklaw.net/pdf/iowa/www.iowaconsumercase.org/011607/0000/PX00738.pdf |title=Challenges and Strategy |format=PDF |work=Groklaw |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref>

===Management style===
[[File:Bill Gates - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Bill Gates in January 2008]]

From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He aggressively broadened the company's range of products, and wherever Microsoft achieved a dominant position he vigorously defended it. He gained a reputation for being distant to others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that "Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls."<ref name="freiberger19810831">{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA44&dq=%22radio%20shack%22%20%22model%20i%22&pg=PA49#v=onepage&q=%22radio%20shack%22%20%22model%20i%22&f=false | title=Bugs in Radio Shack TRS-80 Model III: How Bad Are They? | accessdate = February 28, 2011 | last =Freiberger | first = Paul | date=August 31, 1981 | publisher=InfoWorld | page = 49}}</ref> Another executive recalled that after he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times, when they met again a month later Gates "won or tied every game.

As an executive, Gates met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. Firsthand accounts of these meetings describe him as verbally combative, berating managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.<ref name = "rensin">{{cite journal | first=David|last= Rensin|title= The Bill Gates Interview|year= 1994|journal= Playboy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/churchillclub.mspx | title=Steve Ballmer Speech Transcript&nbsp;— Church Hill Club | first=Steve|last=Ballmer | date=October 9, 1997 |publisher = Microsoft | accessdate= March 31, 2008 | archiveurl= http://archive.is/20120916/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/churchillclub.mspx |archivedate= September 16, 2012}}</ref>

===Antitrust litigation===

[[File:Bill Gates - United States v. Microsoft.jpg|thumb|Gates giving his deposition at Microsoft on August 27, 1998]]

Many decisions that led to [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates's approval. In the 1998 ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'' case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner [[David Boies]] over the contextual meaning of words such as, "compete", "concerned", and "we".  The judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition.<ref name="GatesDepositionJudgeLaugh">{{cite news|accessdate=April 10, 2013 |url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/index.html|title=Gates deposition makes judge laugh in court| first=Elizabeth | last=Wasserman | publisher=CNN|date=November 17, 1998 }}</ref> ''BusinessWeek'' reported:

Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, "Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree."<ref name="truth">{{cite journal|last1=Heilemann |first1=John |last2=Chen |first2=Hy |last3=Wu |first3=J S |last4=Hyland |first4=B |last5=Lu |first5=X D |last6=Chen |first6=J J |title=The Truth, The Whole Truth, and Nothing But The Truth|date=November 1, 2000 |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.11/microsoft_pr.html | accessdate=March 31, 2008 |month=May |volume=46|issue=8|pmid = 18509686 | doi =10.1007/s11517-008-0355-6|pages=833–9 |archiveurl= http://archive.is/20120529/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.11/microsoft_pr.html |archivedate= May 29, 2012}}</ref> Despite Gates' denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed [[monopolization]] and [[tying (commerce)|tying]], and blocking competition, both in violation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].<ref name="truth" />

===Appearance in ads===

Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft in 2008. The first commercial, co-starring [[Jerry Seinfeld]], is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside.  The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in [[New Mexico]] in 1977 for a traffic violation.<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/gatesmug1.html |title = Mugshots | publisher = The Smoking Gun | accessdate = June 9, 2010 |archiveurl= http://archive.is/20120916/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/gatesmug1.html | archivedate = September 16, 2012}}</ref> As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a yes, he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a yes.

Gates began to appreciate the expectations others had of him when public opinion mounted suggesting that he could give more of his wealth to charity. Gates studied the work of [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]], and in 1994 sold some of his Microsoft stock to create the William H. Gates Foundation.
