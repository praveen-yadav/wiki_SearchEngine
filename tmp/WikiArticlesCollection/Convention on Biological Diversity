The '''Convention on Biological Diversity''' ('''CBD'''), known informally as the '''Biodiversity Convention''', is an international legally binding [[treaty]]. The Convention has three main goals:

#conservation of biological diversity (or [[biodiversity]]);
#sustainable use of its components; and
#fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources

In other words, its objective is to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. It is often seen as the key document regarding [[sustainable development]].

The Convention was opened for signature at the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992 and entered into force on 29 December 1993.

2010 was the [[International Year of Biodiversity]]. The Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity is the focal point for the International Year of Biodiversity.
At the 2010 10th Conference of Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity in October in [[Nagoya]], Japan, the Nagoya Protocol was adopted.<ref>http://www.cbd.int/cop10/</ref>
On 22 December 2010, the UN declared the period from 2011 to 2020 as the UN-Decade on Biodiversity. They, hence, followed a recommendation of the CBD signatories during COP10 at [[Nagoya]] in October 2010.

==About the convention==
The convention recognized for the first time in international law that the conservation of biological diversity is "a common concern of humankind" and is an integral part of the development process. The agreement covers all [[ecosystem]]s, species, and genetic resources. It links traditional conservation efforts to the economic goal of using biological resources sustainably. It sets principles for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources, notably those destined for commercial use. It also covers the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology through its [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]], addressing technology development and transfer, benefit-sharing and [[biosafety]] issues. Importantly, the Convention is legally binding; countries that join it ('Parties') are obliged to implement its provisions.

The convention reminds decision-makers that natural resources are not infinite and sets out a philosophy of [[sustainable use]]. While past [[conservation biology|conservation]] efforts were aimed at protecting particular species and habitats, the Convention recognizes that ecosystems, species and genes must be used for the benefit of humans. However, this should be done in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity.

The convention also offers decision-makers guidance based on the [[precautionary principle]] that where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat. The Convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve [[biodiversity|biological diversity]]. It argues, however, that conservation will bring us significant environmental, economic and social benefits in return.

The Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 would ban some forms of [[geoengineering]].<ref>http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827854.200-what-the-un-ban-on-geoengineering-really-means.html</ref>

==Issues under the convention==
Some of the many issues dealt with under the convention include:

* Measures and incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.
* Regulated access to genetic resources and [[traditional knowledge]], including Prior Informed Consent of the party providing resources.
* Sharing, in a fair and equitable way, the results of research and development and the benefits arising from the commercial and other utilization of [[Genetics|genetic]] resources with the Contracting Party providing such resources (governments and/or local communities that provided the traditional knowledge or biodiversity resources utilized).
* Access to and transfer of technology, including [[biotechnology]], to the governments and/or local communities that provided traditional knowledge and/or biodiversity resources.
* Technical and scientific cooperation.
* Coordination of a global directory of taxonomic expertise (Global Taxonomy Initiative).
* Impact assessment.
* Education and public awareness.
* Provision of financial resources.
* National reporting on efforts to implement treaty commitments.

==Cartagena Protocol==
{{main|Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety}}
The '''Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety''' of the Convention, also known as the Biosafety Protocol, was adopted in January 2000. The Biosafety Protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology.

The Biosafety Protocol makes clear that products from new technologies must be based on the [[precautionary principle]] and allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits. It will for example let countries ban imports of a [[genetically modified organism]] if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence the product is [[safe]] and requires exporters to label shipments containing [[genetically modified]] commodities such as corn or cotton.

The required number of 50 instruments of ratification/accession/approval/acceptance by countries was reached in May 2003. In accordance with the provisions of its Article 37, the Protocol entered into force on 11 September 2004.

== Global Strategy for Plant Conservation ==
{{main|Global strategy for plant conservation}}

In April 2002, the parties of the UN CBD adopted the recommendations of the Gran Canaria Declaration Calling for a Global Plant Conservation Strategy, and adopted a 16-point plan aiming to slow the rate of plant extinctions around the world by 2010.

==Parties==
192 countries and the [[European Union]] are parties to the convention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/|title=CBD List of Parties}}</ref> All UN member states—with the exception of the United States, Andorra, and [[South Sudan]]—have ratified the treaty. Non-UN member states that have ratified are the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]]. The [[Holy See]] and the [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited recognition]] are non-parties. The US has signed but not ratified the treaty,<ref>{{cite news|title=India Presses U.S. to Pass Biotic Treaty|last=Hazarika|first=Sanjoy|work=[[New York Times]]|date=23 April 1995|page=1.13}}</ref> and is unlikely to now that they have passed into law the [[Monsanto Protection Act]] of 2013.

==International bodies established by the convention==

'''Conference of the parties:'''
The convention's governing body is the [[Conference of the parties]] (COP), consisting of all governments (and regional economic integration organizations) that have ratified the treaty. This ultimate authority reviews progress under the Convention, identifies new priorities, and sets work plans for members. The COP can also make amendments to the Convention, create expert advisory bodies, review progress reports by member nations, and collaborate with other international organizations and agreements.

The Conference of the Parties uses expertise and support from several other bodies that are established by the Convention. In addition to committees or mechanisms established on an ad hoc basis, two main organs are:

'''Secretariat:'''
The CBD Secretariat. Based in [[Montreal]], it operates under the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. Its main functions are to organize meetings, draft documents, assist member governments in the implementation of the programme of work, coordinate with other international organizations, and collect and disseminate information.

'''Subsidiary body for Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA):'''
The Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA). The SBSTTA is a committee composed of experts from member governments competent in relevant fields. It plays a key role in making recommendations to the COP on scientific and technical issues. 13th Meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA-13) held from 18 to 22 February 2008 in the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] at Rome, Italy. SBSTTA-13 delegates met in the Committee of the Whole in the morning to finalize and adopt recommendations on the in-depth reviews of the work programmes on agricultural and forest biodiversity and SBSTTA's modus operandi for the consideration of new and emerging issues. The closing plenary convened in the afternoon to adopt recommendations on inland waters biodiversity, [[marine (ocean)|marine]] biodiversity, invasive alien [[species]] and biodiversity and [[climate change]]. The current chairperson of the SBSTTA is Dr. Senka Barudanovic.

==Country implementation==
===National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAP)===
"National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) are the principal instruments for implementing the Convention at the national level (Article 6). The Convention requires countries to prepare a national biodiversity strategy (or equivalent instrument) and to ensure that this strategy is mainstreamed into the planning and activities of all those sectors whose activities can have an impact (positive and negative) on biodiversity. To date [2012-02-01], 173 Parties have developed NBSAPs in line with Article 6."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/nbsap/|title= National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) }}</ref>

For example, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Tanzania have carried out elaborate responses to conserve individual species and specific habitats. The United States of America, a signatory who has not yet ratified the treaty,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/oct/27/harrison-ford-conservation-nagoya | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | first=Jonathan | last=Watts | title=Harrison Ford calls on US to ratify treaty on conservation | date=27 October 2010}}</ref> has produced one of the most thorough implementation programs through species Recovery Programs and other mechanisms long in place in the USA for species conservation.

Singapore has also established a detailed [http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/docs/nbc/NPark-booklet-final-4sep.pdf National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan]. The [http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=122&Itemid=124 National Biodiversity Centre] of Singapore represents Singapore in the Convention for Biological Diversity.

===National Reports===
In accordance with Article 26 of the Convention, Parties prepare national reports on the status of implementation of the Convention.

==Executive secretary to the convention==
The current executive secretary is [[Braulio Ferreira de Souza Dias]], who took up this post on 15 February 2012.<ref>http://www.cbd.int/doc/press/2012/pr-2012-02-15-Dias-en.pdf</ref>  Dr [[Ahmed Djoghlaf]] was the previous executive secretary.

==Nagoya Protocol==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}

The '''Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity'''<ref name="nagoya_text">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/ |title=Text of the Nagoya Protocol |work=cbd.int |publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity }}</ref> is a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity. It provides a transparent legal framework for the effective implementation of one of the three objectives of the CBD: the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. The Protocol was adopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, Aichi Province, Japan, and will enter into force 90 days after the fiftieth instrument of ratification. Its objective is the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, thereby contributing to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbd.int/abs/about/|title= Nagoya Protocol}}</ref>

===Relevance===
The Nagoya Protocol is intended to create greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources by:
*Establishing more predictable conditions for access to genetic resources.
*Helping to ensure benefit-sharing when genetic resources leave the contracting party providing the genetic resources

By helping to ensure benefit-sharing, the Nagoya Protocol creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use genetic resources, and therefore enhances the contribution of biodiversity to development and human well-being.

===Scope===
The Nagoya Protocol applies to genetic resources that are covered by the CBD, and to the benefits arising from their utilization. The Nagoya Protocol also covers traditional knowledge (TK) associated with genetic resources that are covered by the CBD and the benefits arising from its utilization

===Obligations===
The Nagoya Protocol sets out core obligations for its contracting Parties to take measures in relation to access to genetic resources, benefit-sharing and compliance.

====Access obligations====
Domestic-level access measures are to:
*Create legal certainty, clarity and transparency
*Provide fair and non-arbitrary rules and procedures
*Establish clear rules and procedures for prior informed consent and mutually agreed terms
*Provide for issuance of a permit or equivalent when access is granted
*Create conditions to promote and encourage research contributing to biodiversity conservation and sustainable use
*Pay due regard to cases of present or imminent emergencies that threaten human, animal or plant health
*Consider the importance of genetic resources for food and agriculture for food security

====Benefit-sharing obligations====
Domestic-level benefit-sharing measures are to provide for the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources with the contracting party providing genetic resources. Utilization includes research and development on the genetic or biochemical composition of genetic resources, as well as subsequent applications and commercialization. Sharing is subject to mutually agreed terms. Benefits may be monetary or non-monetary such as royalties and the sharing of research results.

====Compliance obligations====
Specific obligations to support compliance with the domestic legislation or regulatory requirements of the contracting party providing genetic resources, and contractual obligations reflected in mutually agreed terms, are a significant innovation of the Nagoya Protocol. Contracting Parties are to:
*Take measures providing that genetic resources utilized within their jurisdiction have been accessed in accordance with prior informed consent, and that mutually agreed terms have been established, as required by another contracting party
*Cooperate in cases of alleged violation of another contracting party’s requirements
*Encourage contractual provisions on dispute resolution in mutually agreed terms
*Ensure an opportunity is available to seek recourse under their legal systems when disputes arise from mutually agreed terms
*Take measures regarding access to justice
*Take measures to monitor the utilization of genetic resources after they leave a country including by designating effective checkpoints at any stage of the value-chain: research, development, innovation, pre-commercialization or commercialization

===Implementation===
The Nagoya Protocol’s success will require effective implementation at the domestic level. A range of tools and mechanisms provided by the Nagoya Protocol will assist contracting Parties including:
*Establishing national focal points (NFPs) and competent national authorities (CNAs) to serve as contact points for information, grant access or cooperate on issues of compliance
*An Access and Benefit-sharing Clearing-House to share information, such as domestic regulatory ABS requirements or information on NFPs and CNAs
*Capacity-building to support key aspects of implementation. 

Based on a country’s self-assessment of national needs and priorities, capacity-building may help to:
*Develop domestic ABS legislation to implement the Nagoya Protocol
*Negotiate MAT
*Develop in-country research capability and institutions
*Raise awareness
*Transfer technology
*Target financial support for capacity-building and development initiatives through the GEF

==2012 COP 11==
Leading up to the Conference of the Parties (COP 11) meeting on biodiversity in [[Hyderabad, India]] 2012, preparations for a [http://biodiversity.wwviews.org/  World Wide Views on Biodiversity] has begun, involving old and new partners and building on the experiences from the [[World Wide Views on Global Warming]].
