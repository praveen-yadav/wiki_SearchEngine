The '''Challenger Deep''' is the deepest known point in the [[Earth]]'s [[seabed]] [[hydrosphere]], with a depth of {{convert|10898|m|ft|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} to {{convert|10916|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} by direct measurement from submersibles, and slightly more by [[sonar]] [[bathymetry]] (see below). It is in the [[Pacific Ocean]], at the southern end of the [[Mariana Trench]] near the [[Mariana Islands]] group. The Challenger Deep is a relatively small slot-shaped depression in the bottom of a considerably larger crescent-shaped [[oceanic trench]], which itself is an unusually [[Hadal zone|deep feature]] in the ocean floor. Its bottom is about {{convert|7|mi|km|disp=flip|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|mi|km|disp=flip|abbr=on}} wide, with gently sloping sides.<ref>{{cite web|author=All Things Considered |url=http://www.npr.org/2012/03/09/148317355/film-director-to-travel-to-bottom-of-mariana-trench |title=Diving Back to the Bottom of the Mariana Trench |publisher=NPR |date=9 March 2012 |accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref> The closest land to the Challenger Deep is [[Fais Island]] (one of the outer islands of [[Yap]]), {{convert|287|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest, and [[Guam]], {{convert|304|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northeast.

The depression is named after the British [[Royal Navy]] survey ship [[HMS Challenger (1858)|HMS ''Challenger'']], whose [[Challenger expedition|expedition of 1872–1876]] made the first recordings of its depth. According to the August 2011 version of the [[General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans|GEBCO]] Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names, the location and depth of the Challenger Deep are {{Coord|11|22.4|N|142|35.5|E}} and {{convert|10920|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} ±{{convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names">{{Cite news|url=http://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/undersea_feature_names/#feature_links4|title=IHO-IOC GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names, August 2011 version|date=August 2011|publisher=GEBCO|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref>

*In 1951, about 75 years after its original discovery, the entire Mariana Trench was surveyed by a second [[Royal Navy]] vessel, captained by [[George Stephen Ritchie]] (later [[Rear admiral|Rear Admiral]] Ritchie); this vessel was also named [[HMS Challenger (1931)|HMS ''Challenger'']], after the original expedition ship. This survey recorded the deepest part of the trench using [[echo sounding]], a more precise and easier way to measure depth than the sounding equipment and drag lines used in the original expedition.  A depth of {{convert|5960|fathom|0}} was measured at {{Coord|11|19|N|142|15|E}}.

*The maximum surveyed depth of the Challenger Deep was reported in 1957 by the Soviet vessel ''Vityaz'' recording a spot {{convert|11034|m|ft}} ±{{convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep at {{Coord|11|20.9|N|142|11.5|E}}.<ref name="Bathymetric mapping of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep"/> It was dubbed the ''Mariana Hollow'' and is listed in many reference sources, including the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'',<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title = Mariana Trench | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | id = }}</ref> articles in ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]''<ref name="ngnews">[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0203_050203_deepest.html "Life Is Found Thriving at Ocean's Deepest Point"], National Geographic News, 3 February 2005</ref> and on maps.

*In 1998 a regional bathymetric survey of the Challenger Deep was conducted by the Deep Sea Research Vessel ''RV Kairei'', from the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, using a SeaBeam 2112 multibeam echosounder. The regional bathymetric map made from the data obtained in 1998 shows that the greatest depths in the eastern, central, and western depressions are {{convert|10922|m|0|abbr=on}}  ±{{convert|74|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|10898|m|0|abbr=on}}  ±{{convert|62|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|10908|m|0|abbr=on}}  ±{{convert|36|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, respectively, making the eastern depression the deepest of the three.<ref name="Bathymetric mapping of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep"/>

*In 1999 and 2002 the ''RV Kairei'' revisited the Challenger Deep. The cross track survey in the 1999 ''RV Kairei'' cruise shows that the greatest depths in the eastern, central, and western depressions are {{convert|10920|m|0|abbr=on}}  ±{{convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|10894|m|0|abbr=on}}  ±{{convert|14|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|10907|m|0|abbr=on}}  ±{{convert|13|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, respectively, which supports the results of the 1998 survey. The detailed grid survey in 2002 showed that the deepest site is located in the eastern part of the eastern depression around {{Coord|11|22.260|N|142|35.589|E}}, with a depth of {{convert|10920|m|0|abbr=on}}  ±{{convert|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, about {{convert|290|m|abbr=on}} southeast of the deepest site determined by the survey vessel ''Takuyo'' in 1984 and about {{convert|240|m|abbr=on}} east of the deepest place determined by the 1998 ''RV Kairei'' survey.<ref name="Bathymetric mapping of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep"/>

*On 7 October 2010 further sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep area was conducted by the US [[Center for Coastal & Ocean Mapping]]/Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC) aboard the ''[[USNS Sumner (T-AGS-61)]]''. The results were reported in December 2011 at the annual [[American Geophysical Union]] fall meeting. Using a Kongsberg Maritime EM 122 multibeam echo sounder system coupled to positioning equipment that can determine [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] up to {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} accuracy, from thousands of individual soundings around the deepest part the CCOM/JHC team determined that the Challenger Deep has a maximum depth of {{convert|10994|m|ft|abbr=on}} at {{Coord|11|.326344|N|142|.187248|E}}, with an estimated vertical uncertainty of ±{{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} at 2 [[standard deviation]]s (≈ 95.4%) confidence level.<ref name=BBC_CCOM />  A secondary deep with a depth of {{convert|10951|m|ft|abbr=on}} was located at approximately {{convert|23.75|nmi|km|1|abbr=on}} to the east at {{Coord|11|.369639|N|142|.588582|E}} in the Mariana Trench.<ref name="2011 cruise report"/><ref>[http://www.km.kongsberg.com/ks/web/nokbg0240.nsf/AllWeb/01FB0F22974EA50FC125715E002B2143?OpenDocument EM 122 Multibeam echosounder]</ref><ref>[http://www.km.kongsberg.com/ks/web/nokbg0397.nsf/AllWeb/E016DF00EBFC2964C12571B1003F9DDA/$file/306105aa_em122ds_lr.pdf?OpenElement EM 122 sonar multibeam bathymetry system brochure]</ref><ref>[http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/pi/MB-System/formatdoc/EM_Datagram_Formats_RevP.pdf?OpenElement Instruction manual EM Series (EM 120 & EM 122) Multibeam echo sounders]</ref>

The 2009 and 2010 maximal depths were not confirmed by the series of dives ''[[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]]'' made to the bottom during an expedition in May–June 2009. The direct descent measurements by the four expeditions which have reported from the bottom, have fixed depths in a narrow range from 10,916 m (''[[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]]'') to 10,911 m (''[[Kaikō]]''), to 10,902 m (''[[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]]'') to 10,898 m (''[[Deepsea Challenger]]'') Although an attempt was made to correlate locations, it could not be absolutely certain that Nereus (or the other descents) reached exactly the same points found to be maximally deep by the sonar/echo sounders of previous mapping expeditions, even though one of these echo soundings was made by ''Nereus'' mothership.

{{Main|Bathyscaphe Trieste}}
On 23 January 1960, the Swiss-designed [[bathyscaphe]] ''Trieste'', originally built in Italy and acquired by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], descended to the ocean floor in the trench manned by [[Jacques Piccard]] (who co-designed the submersible along with his father, [[Auguste Piccard]]) and USN Lieutenant [[Don Walsh]]. Their crew compartment was inside a spherical pressure vessel, which was a heavy-duty replacement (of the Italian original) built by [[Krupp]] Steel Works of [[Essen]], Germany. Their descent took almost five hours and the two men spent barely twenty minutes on the ocean floor before undertaking the three-hour-and-fifteen-minute ascent. Their early departure from the ocean floor was due to their concern over a crack in the outer window caused by the temperature differences during their descent.<ref name="National Geographics">http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/1960-dive/</ref> The measured depth at the bottom was measured with a [[manometer]] at {{convert|10916|m|0|abbr=on}} ±{{convert|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Bathymetric mapping of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep"/><ref name=usn1960>{{cite web

On their 1960 descent, the crew of the ''Trieste'' noted that the floor consisted of [[diatom]]aceous ooze and reported observing "some type of flatfish" lying on the seabed.<ref>[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1992/1/1992_1_28.shtml "To the bottom of the sea"], T. A. Heppenheimer, AmericanHeritage.com</ref> 

{{quote |"...&nbsp;And as we were settling this final fathom, I saw a wonderful thing. Lying on the bottom just beneath us was some type of flatfish, resembling a sole, about 1 foot long and 6 inches across. Even as I saw him, his two round eyes on top of his head spied us&nbsp;— a monster of steel&nbsp;— invading his silent realm. Eyes? Why should he have eyes? Merely to see phosphorescence? The floodlight that bathed him was the first real light ever to enter this hadal realm. Here, in an instant, was the answer that biologists had asked for the decades. Could life exist in the greatest depths of the ocean? It could! And not only that, here apparently, was a true, bony teleost fish, not a primitive ray or elasmobranch. Yes, a highly evolved vertebrate, in time's arrow very close to man himself. Slowly, extremely slowly, this flatfish swam away. Moving along the bottom, partly in the ooze and partly in the water, he disappeared into his night. Slowly too&nbsp;— perhaps everything is slow at the bottom of the sea&nbsp;— Walsh and I shook hands.<ref>Seven Miles Down: The Story of the Bathyscaph Trieste (1961) by J. Piccard and R. S. Dietz. pp. 172–174. Published by the Putnam, New York.</ref>}}

Many marine biologists are now skeptical of this supposed sighting, and it is suggested that the creature may instead have been a [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/18/james-cameron-dives-deep-avatar "James Cameron dives deep for Avatar"], ''Guardian'', 18 January 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.nature.com/news/james-cameron-heads-into-the-abyss-1.10246 "James Cameron heads into the abyss"], ''Nature'', 19 March 2012</ref> The video camera on board the ''Kaiko'' probe spotted a sea cucumber, a [[Polynoidae|scale worm]] and a [[shrimp]] at the bottom.<ref>[http://space.newscientist.com/article/mg15220548.100-mission-to-marianas--if-mount-everest-was-dropped-into-the-worlds-deepest-trench-it-woulddrown-kaiko-hit-bottom----and-came-back-to-tell-the-tale.html "Mission to Marianas"], ''New Scientist'', 2 November 1996</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983295-6,00.html "The last frontier"], ''Time'', 14 August 1995</ref> At the bottom of the Challenger deep, the ''Nereus'' probe spotted one [[polychaete]] worm (a multi-legged predator) about an inch long.<ref>[http://ns.gov.gu/geography.html Accessed 8 Oct 2009] Geography of the ocean floor near Guam with some notes on exploration of the Challenger Deep.</ref>

An analysis of the sediment samples collected by ''Kaiko'' found large numbers of simple organisms at {{convert|10900|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Todo |first=Yuko |coauthors=''et al.'' |year=2005 |title=Simple Foraminifera Flourish at the Ocean's Deepest Point |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=307 |issue=5710 |page=689 |doi=10.1126/science.1105407 |url= |quote= |pmid=15692042 }}</ref> While similar lifeforms have been known to exist in shallower ocean trenches (> 7,000 m) and on the [[abyssal plain]], the lifeforms discovered in the Challenger Deep possibly represent [[taxon|taxa]] distinct from those in shallower ecosystems.

Most of the organisms collected were simple, soft-shelled [[foraminifera]] (432 species according to National Geographic<ref>{{Cite news|first=John |last=Roach |title=Life Is Found Thriving at Ocean's Deepest Point |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0203_050203_deepest.html |work=National Geographic News |date=3 February 2005 }}</ref>), with four of the others representing species of the complex, multi-chambered genera ''[[Leptohalysis]]'' and ''[[Reophax]]''. Eighty-five percent of the specimens were organic, soft-shelled [[allogromiid]]s, which is unusual compared to samples of [[sediment-dwelling organisms]] from other deep-sea environments, where the percentage of [[Foraminifera#Organic-walled|organic-walled foraminifera]] ranges from 5% to 20%. As small organisms with hard, calcareous shells have trouble growing at extreme depths because of the high solubility of [[calcium carbonate]] in the pressurized water, scientists theorize that the preponderance of soft-shelled organisms in the Challenger Deep may have resulted from the typical [[biosphere]] present when the Challenger Deep was shallower than it is now. Over the course of six to nine million years, as the Challenger Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment died out or were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The species that survived the change in depth were the ancestors of the Challenger Deep's current denizens.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}
