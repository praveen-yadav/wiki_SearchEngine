'''Capricornus''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|p|r|ɨ|ˈ|k|ɔr|n|ə|s}} is one of the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]]; it is often called '''Capricorn''', especially when referring to the corresponding [[Capricorn (astrology)|astrological sign]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for "horned [[goat]]" or "goat [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]", and it is commonly represented in the form of a sea-goat: a mythical creature that is half goat, half [[fish]]. Its symbol is [[Image:Capricorn symbol 2.png|20px]] (Unicode ♑).

Capricornus is one of the 88 modern constellations, and was also one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]]. Under its modern boundaries it is bordered by [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], [[Microscopium]], [[Piscis Austrinus]] and [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. The constellation is located in an area of sky called the [[Sea (astronomy)|Sea]] or the Water, consisting of many water-related constellations such as Aquarius, Pisces and Eridanus. It is the second faintest constellation in the zodiac after [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]], and it is the smallest constellation in the zodiac.

===Deep-sky objects===
Several galaxies and star clusters are contained within Capricornus.  [[Messier 30]] is a globular cluster located 1 degree south of the galaxy group NGC 7103. The constellation also harbors the wide spiral galaxy NGC 6907. 

[[Messier 30|M30]] (NGC 7099) is a centrally-condensed globular cluster of magnitude 7.5. At a distance of 30,000 light-years, it has chains of stars extending to the north that are resolvable in small amateur telescopes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}

One [[galaxy group]] located in Capricornus is [[HCG 87]], a group of at least three galaxies located 400 million [[light-years]] from Earth ([[redshift]] 0.0296). It contains a large [[elliptical galaxy]], a face-on [[spiral galaxy]], and an edge-on spiral galaxy. The face-on spiral galaxy is experiencing abnormally high rates of [[star formation]], indicating that it is [[interacting galaxy|interacting]] with one or both members of the group. Furthermore, the large elliptical galaxy and the edge-on spiral galaxy, both of which have [[active galactic nucleus|active nuclei]], are connected by a stream of stars and dust, indicating that they too are interacting. Astronomers predict that the three galaxies may [[galaxy merger|merge]] millions of years in the future to form a giant elliptical galaxy.<ref name="objects">{{Harvnb|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}</ref>

===Stars===
Capricorn is a faint constellation, with only one star above magnitude 3; its alpha star has a magnitude of only 3.6.

The brightest star in Capricornus is [[Delta Capricorni|δ Capricorni]], also called Deneb Algedi, with a magnitude of 2.9, 39 light-years from Earth. Like several other stars such as [[Denebola]] and [[Deneb]], it is named for the Arabic word for "tail" (''deneb''); its traditional name means "the tail of the goat". Deneb Algedi is a [[Beta Lyrae variable]] star (a type of [[eclipsing binary]]). It ranges by about 0.2 magnitudes with a period of 24.5 hours.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}

The other bright stars in Capricornus range in magnitude from 3.1 to 5.1. [[Alpha Capricorni|α Capricorni]] is a multiple star also known as Algedi or Giedi. The primary (α<sup>2</sup> Cap), 109 light-years from Earth,  is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 3.6.; the secondary (α<sup>1</sup> Cap), 690 light-years from Earth, is a yellow-hued supergiant star of magnitude 4.3. The two stars are distinguishable by the naked eye, and both are themselves multiple stars. α<sup>1</sup> Capricorni is accompanied by a star of magnitude 9.2; α<sup>2</sup> Capricornus is accompanied by a star of magnitude 11.0; this faint star is itself a binary star with two components of magnitude 11. The traditional names of α Capricorni come from the Arabic word for "the kid", which references the constellation's mythology.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}

[[Beta Capricorni|β Capricorni]] is a [[double star]] also known as Dabih. It is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 3.1, 340 light-years from Earth. The secondary is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 6.1. The two stars are distinguishable in binoculars. [[Beta Capricorni|β Capricorni]]'s traditional name comes from the Arabic phrase for "the lucky stars of the slaughterer," a reference to ritual sacrifices performed by ancient Arabs at the [[heliacal rising]] of Capricornus.<ref>Mark R. Chartrand III (1983) Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers, p. 126 (ISBN 0-307-13667-1).</ref> Another star visible to the naked eye is [[Gamma Capricorni|γ Capricorni]], sometimes called Nashira ("bringing good tidings"); it is a white-hued giant star of magnitude 3.7, 139 light-years from Earth. [[Pi Capricorni|π Capricorni]] is a double star with a blue-white hued primary of magnitude 5.1 and a white-hued secondary of magnitude 8.3. It is 670 light-years from Earth and the components are distinguishable in a small telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}

==History and mythology==
Despite its faintness, Capricornus has one of the oldest mythological associations, having been consistently represented as a [[mythological hybrid|hybrid]] of a goat and a fish since the [[Middle Bronze Age]]. First attested in depictions on a cylinder-seal from around the 21st century BC,<ref>{{citation |title = Master's Thesis |first = Peeter |last = Espak |year = 2006 |page = 104 |url = http://dspace.utlib.ee/dspace/bitstream/10062/958/5/espakpeeter.pdf}}</ref> it was explicitly recorded in the [[Babylonian star catalogues]] as {{lang|sux-Latn|<sup>MUL</sup>SUḪUR.MAŠ}} "The Goat-Fish" before 1000 BC. The constellation was a symbol of the god [[Ea (god)|Ea]] and in the [[Early Bronze Age]] marked the [[winter solstice]].<ref>{{cite journal |first = John H. |last = Rogers, |url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JBAA..108....9R |title = Origins of the ancient contellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions |journal = Journal of the British Astronomical Association |volume = 108 |year = 1998 |pages = 9–28|bibcode = 1998JBAA..108....9R }}</ref>

Due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]] the December solstice no longer takes place while the sun is in the constellation Capricornus, as it did until 130 BCE, but the [[Capricorn (astrology)|astrological sign called Capricorn]] begins with the solstice. The solstice now takes place when the Sun is in [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. The sun's most southerly position, which is attained at the northern hemisphere's winter solstice, is now called the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], a term which also applies to the line on the Earth at which the sun is directly overhead at noon on that solstice. The Sun is now in Capricorn from late January through mid-February.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}

In Greek mythology, the constellation is sometimes identified as [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]], the goat that suckled the infant [[Zeus]] after his mother [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] saved him from being devoured by his father [[Cronus|Cronos]] (in [[Greek mythology]]). The goat's broken horn was transformed into the [[cornucopia]] or horn of plenty.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Capricornus is also sometimes identified as [[Pan (god)|Pan]], the god with a goat's head, who saved himself from the monster [[Typhon]] by giving himself a fish's tail and diving into a river.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}

The planet [[Neptune]] was discovered in Capricornus by German astronomer [[Johann Gottfried Galle|Johann Galle]], near Deneb Algedi (δ Capricorni) on September 23, 1846, which is appropriate as Capricornus can be seen best from Europe at 4:00am in September.

==Visualizations==
[[File:ZodiacalConstellationCapricornus.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Early nineteenth century rendition of Capricornus as a sea-goat.]]
Capricornus's brighter stars are found on a triangle whose vertices are [[Alpha Capricorni|α<sup>2</sup> Capricorni]] (Giedi), [[Delta Capricorni|δ Capricorni]] (Deneb Algiedi), and [[Omega Capricorni|ω Capricorni]]. Ptolemy's method of connecting the stars of Capricornus has been influential.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jebrown.us/SolarAlmanac/private/Articles/Constellations/Capricornus.html#Ptolemy |title=Capricornus |publisher=Jebrown.us |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> Capricornus is usually drawn as a goat with the tail of a fish.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}

[[Image:Capricornus constellation map visualization.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of H.A. Rey's alternative way to connect the stars of the Capricornus constellation.]]
[[H. A. Rey]] has suggested an alternative visualization, which graphically shows a [[goat]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Rey|1997}}</ref> The goat's head is formed by the triangle of stars [[Iota Capricorni|ι Cap]], [[Theta Capricorni|θ Cap]], and [[Zeta Capricorni|ζ Cap]]. The goat's horn sticks out with stars [[Gamma Capricorni|γ Cap]] and [[Delta Capricorni|δ Cap]]. Star δ Cap, at the tip of the horn, is of the third magnitude. The goat's tail consists of stars [[Beta Capricorni|β Cap]] and [[Alpha Capricorni|α<sup>2</sup> Cap]]: star β Cap being of the third magnitude. The goat's hind foot consists of stars [[Psi Capricorni|ψ Cap]] and [[Omega Capricorni|ω Cap]]. Both of these stars are of the fourth magnitude.

==Equivalents==
