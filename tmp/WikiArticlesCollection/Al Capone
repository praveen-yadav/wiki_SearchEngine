'''Alphonse Gabriel "Al" Capone''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|_|k|ə|ˈ|p|oʊ|n}}; January 17, 1899&nbsp;– January 25, 1947) was an [[United States|American]] [[gangster]] who led a [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition-era]] [[crime syndicate]]. The [[Chicago Outfit]], which subsequently also became known as the "Capones", was dedicated to [[smuggling]] and [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] [[alcoholic beverage|liquor]], and other illegal activities such as [[prostitution]], in [[Chicago]] from the early 1920s to 1931.

Born in the [[Brooklyn, New York|borough of Brooklyn]] in [[New York City]] to [[Italian people|Italian]] immigrants, Capone became involved with gang activity at a young age after being expelled from school at age 14.<ref name="Biography Channel">{{cite web |url= http://www.biography.com/notorious/crimefiles.do?catId=259452&action=view&profileId=262834|title= Notorious Crime Files: Al Capone|accessdate=2010-11-12 |publisher= Biography.com|work= [[The Biography Channel]]}}</ref>  In his early twenties, he moved to [[Chicago]] to take advantage of a new opportunity to make money smuggling illegal alcoholic beverages into the city during Prohibition.  He also engaged in various other criminal activities, including [[bribery]] of government figures and prostitution. 

Despite his illegitimate occupation, Capone became a highly visible public figure. He made donations to various charitable endeavors using the money he made from his activities, and was viewed by many to be a "modern-day [[Robin Hood]]".<ref name="Alcatrazhistory.com">{{cite web |url= http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/cap1.htm|last= |first= |title= Al Capone at Alcatraz |publisher=Ocean View Publishing |year= 1992}}</ref> Capone's public reputation was damaged in the wake of his supposed involvement in the 1929 [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre]], when seven rival gang members were executed.<ref name="five families book"/>  

Capone was convicted on federal charges of [[tax evasion]] in 1931 and sentenced to [[federal prison]]; he was released on parole in 1939.  His incarceration included a term at the then-new [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|Alcatraz]] federal prison. In the final years of Capone's life, he suffered mental and physical deterioration due to late-stage [[neurosyphilis]], which he had contracted in his youth. On January 25, 1947, he died from [[cardiac arrest]] after suffering a [[stroke]].

==Early life==
[[File:Al Capone mother.jpg|thumb|upright|Young Capone and his mother, Teresa]]
Alphonse Gabriel Capone was born in the borough of [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]] in New York on January 17, 1899.<ref name="CAPONE"/> His parents, Gabriele Capone (December 12, 1864 – November 14, 1920) and Teresina Raiola (December 28, 1867 – November 29, 1952), were immigrants from Italy. His father was a [[barber]] from [[Castellammare di Stabia]], a town about {{convert|16|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Naples]], and his mother was a [[sewing|seamstress]] and the daughter of Angelo Raiola from [[Angri]], a town in the [[Province of Salerno]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Capone|last=Kobler|first=John|year=1971|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn= 0-306-80499-9|page= 23}}</ref>

Gabriele and Teresa had nine children: Alphonse "Scarface Al" Capone, [[James Capone]] (who later changed his name to Richard Hart and became, ironically, a Prohibition agent in Homer, Nebraska), [[Ralph Capone|Raffaele Capone]] (also known as Ralph "Bottles" Capone, who took charge of his brother's beverage industry), [[Frank Capone|Salvatore "Frank" Capone]], John Capone, Albert Capone, Matthew Capone, Rose Capone, and Mafalda Capone (who married John J. Maritote). His two brothers, [[Ralph Capone]] and [[Frank Capone]] worked with him in his empire. Frank did so until his death on April 1, 1924 and Ralph ran the bottling companies (both legal and illegal) early on, and was also the front man for the [[Chicago Outfit]] for some time until he was imprisoned for tax evasion in 1932. The Capone family immigrated to the United States, first immigrating from Italy to Fiume, [[Austria–Hungary]] (now [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]) in 1893, traveling on a ship to the U.S. and finally settled at 95 Navy Street,<ref name="CAPONE">{{cite book |last=Schoenberg |first=Robert L. |title= Mr. Capone|year= 1992 |publisher=William Morrow and Company|location=[[New York City|New York]], New York|isbn=0-688-12838-6| pages=18–19|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U7VAcMdddNkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=al+capone&ei=DFt6SuewMZ-UygSR7MXCDA#v=onepage&q=born&f=false}}</ref> in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard|Navy Yard]] section of [[downtown Brooklyn]].  Gabriele Capone worked at a nearby barber shop at 29 Park Avenue.<ref name="CAPONE"/> When Al was 11, the Capone family moved to 38 Garfield Place<ref name="CAPONE"/> in [[Park Slope]], Brooklyn.

Capone showed promise as a student, but had trouble with the rules at his strict parochial [[Catholic school]]. He dropped out of school at the age of 14, after being expelled for hitting a female teacher in the face.<ref name="Biography Channel"/> He worked at odd jobs around Brooklyn, including a candy store and a [[bowling alley]].<ref>Kobler, 27.</ref> During this time, Capone was influenced by gangster [[Johnny Torrio]], whom he came to regard as a mentor.<ref>Kobler, 26.</ref>

==Career==
After his initial stint with small-time gangs that included the Junior Forty Thieves and the Bowery Boys, Capone joined the Brooklyn Rippers and then the powerful [[Five Points Gang]] based in Lower Manhattan. During this time, he was employed and mentored by fellow racketeer [[Frankie Yale]], a [[bartender]] in a [[Coney Island]] dance hall and saloon called the Harvard Inn. After he inadvertently insulted a woman while working the door at a Brooklyn night club, Capone was attacked by her brother, Frank Gallucio, and his face was slashed three times on the left side. These scars gave him the nickname "Scarface", a nickname he despised.<ref name="five families book">{{cite book

===Marriage and family===
On December 30, 1918, at age 19, Capone married [[Mae Capone|Mae Josephine Coughlin]], who was Irish Catholic and who, earlier that month, had given birth to their first son, Albert Francis ("Sonny") Capone. As Capone was under the age of 21, his parents had to consent to the marriage in writing.{{citation needed|date = October 2011}}

===Chicago career===
Capone departed New York for [[Chicago]] without his new wife and son, who joined him later. In 1923, he purchased a small house at 7244 South Prairie Avenue in the Park Manor neighborhood on the city's [[South Side, Chicago|south side]] for {{US$|5500}}.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hood |first=Joel |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/chi-talk-caponeapr02,0,5381253.story |title=Capone home on the market - Chicago Tribune Archives |publisher=Chicagotribune.com |date=2009-04-02 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref>

Capone was recruited for Chicago by [[Johnny Torrio]], his Five Points Gang mentor.  Torrio had gone there to resolve some family problems his cousin's husband was having with the [[Black Hand (extortion)|Black Hand]] and killed them. He saw many business opportunities in Chicago, especially [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] following the onset of [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. Chicago's location on Lake Michigan gave access to a vast inland territory, and it was well-served by railroads.  Torrio took over the crime empire of [[Jim Colosimo|James "Big Jim" Colosimo]] after he was murdered. Yale was a suspect, but legal proceedings against him were dropped due to a lack of evidence.<ref>{{cite web|first= Marilyn |last= Bardsley|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/capone/chicago_5.html|title=Chicago|accessdate=2008-04-03 |publisher= Crime Library|work= Al Capone}}</ref> Capone was suspected in the murders of Colosimo and two other men. He was seeking a safe haven and a better job to provide for his new family.<ref>Kobler, 37.</ref>

The 1924 town council elections in [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]] became known as one of the most crooked elections in the Chicago area's long history of rigged elections, with voters threatened by thugs at polling stations. Capone's mayoral candidate won by a huge margin and weeks later announced that he would run Capone out of town. Capone then met with his puppet-mayor and knocked him down the town hall steps.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

For Capone, the election victory was also marred by the death of his older brother Frank at the hands of the police. Capone cried at his brother's funeral and ordered the closure of all the [[speakeasy|speakeasies]] in Cicero for a day as a mark of respect.

Much of Capone's family settled in Cicero as well. In 1930, Capone's sister Mafalda married John J. Maritote at [[St. Mary of Częstochowa in Cicero|St. Mary of Częstochowa]], a massive [[Neogothic]] edifice towering over Cicero Avenue in the [[Polish Cathedral style]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Added by bob armour |url=http://timelines.com/1923/al-capone-moves-his-gangs-headquarters-to-cicero-illinois |title=Al Capone moves his gang's headquarters to Cicero, Illinois |publisher=Timelines.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref>

===Capone's power grows in Chicago===
The Torrio-Capone organization, as well as the Sicilian-American [[Genna crime family]], competed with the [[North Side Gang]] of [[Dean O'Banion]]. In May 1924, O'Banion discovered that their Sieben Brewery was going to be raided by federal agents and sold his share to Torrio. After the raid, both O'Banion and Torrio were arrested.<ref>{{cite book |title= Capone: The Man and the Era|last= Bergreen|first= Laurence|year= 1994|publisher= Simon and Schuster Paperbacks|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-684-82447-5|pages= 131–132}}</ref> Torrio's people murdered O'Banion in revenge on October 10, 1924, provoking a gang war.<ref>Bergreen, pp&nbsp;134–135</ref><ref>Bergreen, p 138</ref>

In 1925, Torrio was severely injured in an attack by the North Side Gang; he turned over his business to Capone and returned to Italy. During the Prohibition Era, Capone controlled large portions of the Chicago underworld, which provided [[Chicago Outfit|The Outfit]] with an estimated US$100 million per year in revenue.<ref>"Purchasing Power of Money in the United States from 1774 to 2008." Online calculator appears on the right side of website. http://www.measuringworth.com/ppowerus/index.php</ref> This wealth was generated through numerous illegal [[vice]] enterprises, such as [[gambling]] and [[prostitution]]; the highest revenue was generated by the sale of liquor.<ref name="five families book"/>

His transportation network moved smuggled liquor from the rum-runners of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], [[The Purple Gang]] in [[Detroit]], who brought liquor in from Canada, with help from Belle River native [[Blaise Diesbourg]], also known as "King Canada", and local production which came from [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] [[moonshine]] operations and illegal breweries. With the revenues gained by his bootlegging operation, Capone increased his grip on the political and law-enforcement establishments in Chicago. He made his headquarters at Chicago's [[Lexington Hotel]]; after the [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]], it was nicknamed "Capone's Castle".

The organized corruption included the bribing of Chicago Mayor [[William Hale Thompson|William "Big Bill" Hale Thompson]], and Capone's gang operated largely free from legal intrusion.  He operated [[casino]]s and speakeasies throughout the city. With his wealth, he indulged in custom suits, cigars, gourmet food and drink (his preferred liquor was [[Templeton Rye]] from [[Iowa]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavytable.com/templeton-rye-of-templeton-iowa/|title=Templeton Rye of Templeton, Iowa|last=Walker|first=Jason|date=2009-07-07|accessdate=2010-12-04|publisher=Heavy Table| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101125042146/http://heavytable.com/templeton-rye-of-templeton-iowa/| archivedate= 25 November 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>), jewelry, and female companionship. He garnered media attention, to which his favorite responses were "I am just a businessman, giving the people what they want", and "All I do is satisfy a public demand".<ref name="five families book"/> Capone had become a celebrity.

His rivals retaliated for the violence of Capone's enforcement of control. North Side gangsters [[Hymie Weiss]] and [[Bugs Moran]] wanted to bring him down. More than once, Capone's car was riddled with bullets. On September 20, 1926, the North Side gang shot into Capone's entourage as he was eating lunch in the Hawthorne Hotel restaurant. A motorcade of ten vehicles, using [[Thompson submachine gun]]s and shotguns riddled the outside of the Hotel and the restaurant on the first floor of the building. Capone's bodyguard, [[Frank Rio|Frankie Rio]], threw him to the ground at the first sound of gunfire. Several bystanders were hurt from flying glass and bullet fragments in the raid.  Capone paid for the medical care of a young boy and his mother who would have lost her eyesight otherwise. This event prompted Capone to call for a truce, but negotiations fell through. The attacks were believed to have been made at Moran's direction and left Capone shaken.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Capone placed armed bodyguards around the clock at his headquarters at the [[Lexington Hotel]], at 22nd Street (later renamed Cermak Road) and Michigan Avenue. For his trips away from Chicago, Capone was reputed to have had several other retreats and hideouts in places including [[Couderay, Wisconsin]].<ref name="CBS">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-5369641-504083.html |title=Al Capone's Couderay, Wisconsin Hideout Home for Sale; Asking Price $2.6M |publisher=CBS News |date=7 October 2009 |accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref>

Capone's Couderay hideout (a popular tourist attraction in later years) is a 407-acre property, complete with a 37-acre lake which reputedly was used to land planes filled with illegal liquor for shipment south to Chicago.<ref name="CBS"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-10-08/justice/wisconsin.capone.hideout.sold_1_capone-family-al-capone-reputed?_s=PM:CRIME |title=Reputed Capone hideout sold to Wisconsin bank |publisher=CNN |date=8 October 2009 |accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref> Former New York gang member Owney "The Killer" Madden retired to Hot Springs and invited his former colleagues to visit him there; this was also the place that [[Lucky Luciano]] was first arrested. As a further precaution, Capone and his entourage would often show up suddenly at one of Chicago's train depots and buy up an entire [[Pullman (car or coach)|Pullman]] [[Sleeping car|sleeper car]] on night trains to places such as Cleveland, Omaha, Kansas City, Little Rock or Hot Springs, where they would spend a week in luxury hotel suites under assumed names. In 1928, Capone bought a 14-room retreat on [[Palm Island (Miami Beach)|Palm Island, Florida]], close to [[Miami Beach]].<ref name="five families book"/>

===Saint Valentine's Day Massacre===
{{Main|Saint Valentine's Day Massacre}}
[[File:Valentine Day massacre.jpg|thumb|The St. Valentine's Day Massacre eliminated some of Capone's enemies, but outraged the general public]]

It is believed{{by whom|date=August 2012}} that Capone ordered the 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre in the [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]] neighborhood on Chicago's [[Neighborhoods of Chicago#North Side|North Side]].  Details of the killing of the seven victims<ref name="five families book"/> in a garage at 2122 North Clark Street (then the SMC Cartage Co.) and the extent of Capone's involvement are widely disputed. No one was ever brought to trial for the crime.  The massacre was thought to be the [[The Chicago Outfit|Outfit]]'s effort to strike back at [[Bugs Moran]]'s North Side gang.  They had been increasingly bold in hijacking the Outfit's booze trucks, assassinating two presidents of the Outfit-controlled ''[[Unione Siciliana]]'', and made three assassination attempts on [[Jack McGurn]], one of Capone's top enforcers. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

To monitor their targets' habits and movements, Capone's men rented an apartment across from the trucking warehouse that served as a Moran headquarters. On the morning of Thursday February 14, 1929, Capone's lookouts signaled gunmen disguised as police to start a "raid". The ''faux'' police lined the seven victims along a wall without a struggle then signaled for accomplices with machine guns. The seven victims were machine-gunned and shot-gunned.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  Photos of the massacre victims shocked the public and damaged Capone's reputation.  Federal law enforcement worked to investigate his activities.<ref name="five families book"/>

===Conviction and imprisonment===
{{Wikisource|Portal:IRS investigation of Al Capone|IRS investigation of Al Capone}}
[[File:Al-capone-cell.jpg|thumb|left|Al Capone's cell at the [[Eastern State Penitentiary]], Philadelphia, PA]]

In 1929, the [[Bureau of Prohibition]] agent [[Eliot Ness]] began an investigation of Capone and his business, attempting to get a conviction for Prohibition violations. [[Frank J. Wilson]] investigated Capone's income tax violations, which the government decided was more likely material for a conviction. In 1931 Capone was indicted for [[income tax evasion]] and various violations of the [[Volstead Act]] (Prohibition) at the [[Chicago Federal Building]] in the courtroom of Judge [[James Herbert Wilkerson]].<ref name="court">{{cite web| title= Visitors to the Court-Historic Trials| publisher=US District Court-Northern District of Illinois| date=| accessdate=2011-02-10| url=http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/CourtHouseVisitors.aspx}}</ref> His attorneys made a plea deal, but the presiding judge warned he might not follow the sentencing recommendation from the prosecution.  Capone withdrew his plea of guilty.

His attempt to bribe and intimidate the potential jurors was discovered by Ness's men, [[Untouchables (law enforcement)|The Untouchables]]. The ''[[venire]]'' (jury pool) was switched with one from another case, and Capone was stymied. Following a long trial, on October 17 the jury returned a mixed verdict, finding Capone guilty of five counts of tax evasion and failing to file tax returns<ref>{{cite web | url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/capone/caponeverdict.html | title= Selected Documents: Jury Verdict Form (October 17, 1931) | work=Al Capone Trial | first=Douglas O. | last=Linder | publisher=University of Missouri–Kansas City | accessdate=2011-10-16}}</ref><ref>Bergreen, p. 484</ref> (the Volstead Act violations were dropped).

In May 1932, Capone was sent to [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta|Atlanta U.S. Penitentiary]], but he was able to obtain special privileges. Later, for a short period of time, he was transferred to the [[Lincoln Heights Jail]]. He was transferred to [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|Alcatraz]] on August 11, 1934, which was newly established as a prison on an island off San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timelines.com/1934/8/11/first-prisoners-arrive-at-alcatraz-prison-likely-including-al-capone |title=First Prisoners Arrive at Alcatraz Prison (Likely Including Al Capone) |publisher=Timelines.com |date=1934-08-11 |accessdate=2011-01-27}}</ref> The warden kept tight security and cut off Capone's contact with colleagues. His isolation and the repeal of Prohibition in December 1933, which reduced a major source of revenue, diminished his power.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
[[File:Acaponeh.jpg|thumb|Al Capone at [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|Alcatraz]]]]

During his early months at Alcatraz, Capone made an enemy by showing his disregard for the prison social order when he cut in line while prisoners were waiting for a haircut. [[James C. Lucas|James Lucas]], a [[Texas]] bank robber serving 30 years, reportedly confronted the former syndicate leader and told him to get back at the end of the line. When Capone asked if he knew who he was, Lucas reportedly grabbed a pair of the barber's scissors and, holding them to Capone's neck, answered: "Yeah, I know who you are, greaseball. And if you don't get back to the end of that fucking<!--Original reads "fucking".

New York: Da Capo Press, 2005. ISBN 0-8160-5694-3</ref>

Capone was admitted into the prison hospital with a minor wound and released a few days later.<ref name="Alcatrazhistory.com"/> In addition, his health declined as the [[syphilis]] which he had contracted as a youth progressed. He spent the last year of his sentence in the prison hospital, confused and disoriented.<ref name="ch11">[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/capone/chapter_11.html Al Capone: Chicago's Most Infamous Mob Boss - The Crime library<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref> Capone completed his term in Alcatraz on January 6, 1939, and was transferred to the Federal Correctional Institution at [[Terminal Island]] in California, to serve the one-year [[contempt of court]] term he was originally sentenced to serve in Chicago's Cook County jail.<ref>''J.

==Later years and death==
Capone's control and interests within [[organized crime]] diminished rapidly after his imprisonment. Additionally, 20 years of high living had seriously ravaged his health.  He had lost weight, and his physical and mental health had deteriorated under the effects of [[neurosyphilis]].  In 1946, his physician and a Baltimore psychiatrist performed examinations and concluded that Capone, due to brain damage caused by the syphilis, then had the mental capability of a 12-year-old child.<ref name="Federal Bureau of Investigation">{{cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/al-capone|title=Famous Cases and Criminals - Al Capone|last=Federal Bureau of Investigation|first=|work= |publisher=www.fbi.gov|accessdate=2010-11-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101019213135/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/al-capone| archivedate= 19 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> He often raved about Communists, foreigners, and [[Bugs Moran]], who he was convinced was plotting to kill him from his Ohio prison cell.

Unable to resume his criminal career, Capone spent the last years of his life at his mansion in Florida.  On January 21, 1947, Capone had a [[stroke]]. He regained consciousness and started to improve but contracted [[pneumonia]]. [[File:Death certificate of Al Capone.jpg|right|thumb|Capone's [[death certificate]].]] He suffered a fatal [[cardiac arrest]] the next day.

==In popular culture==
One of the most notorious American gangsters of the 20th century, Capone has been the subject of numerous articles, books, and films. Capone's personality and character have been used in fiction as a model for crime lords and criminal [[Mastermind (Role Variant)|masterminds]] ever since his death. The stereotypical image of a mobster wearing a blue pinstriped suit and tilted [[fedora]] is based on photos of Capone. His accent, mannerisms, facial construction, physical stature, and  [[parody|parodies]] of his name have been used for numerous gangsters in comics, movies, music, and literature.
