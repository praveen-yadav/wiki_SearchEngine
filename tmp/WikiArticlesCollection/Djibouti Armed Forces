The '''Djibouti Armed Forces''' ('''DJAF''') ({{lang-so|''Ciidanka Jabuuti''}}) are the military forces of [[Djibouti]]. They consist of the '''Djibouti National Army''' and its sub-branches the [[Djibouti Air Force]] and [[Djiboutian Navy]]. As of 2013, the Djibouti Armed Forces consists of 8,000 ground troops, which are divided into several [[regiment]]s and [[battalion]]s garrisoned in various areas throughout the country.

==History==
{{main|Military history of Djibouti}}
Historically, Somali society accorded prestige to the warrior (''waranle'') and rewarded military prowess. Except for a man of religion (''wadaad''), and they were few in number, all Somali males were considered potential warriors.
Djibouti's many [[Sultan]]ates each maintained regular troops. In the early Middle Ages, the conquest of [[Shewa]] by the [[Ifat Sultanate]] ignited a rivalry for supremacy with the [[Solomonic Dynasty]].
[[File:Djibarmgen.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A Djibouti Armed Forces commander.]]
Many similar battles were fought between the succeeding [[Sultanate of Adal]] and the Solomonids, with both sides achieving victory and suffering defeat. During the protracted [[Ethiopian-Adal War]] (1529–1559), [[Imam]] [[Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi]] defeated several [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Ethiopian Emperors]] and embarked on a conquest referred to as the ''Futuh Al-Habash'' ("Conquest of Abyssinia"), which brought three-quarters of [[Christian]] Abyssinia under the power of the [[Muslim]] Adal Sultanate.<ref>Saheed A. Adejumobi, ''The History of Ethiopia'', (Greenwood Press: 2006), p.178</ref><ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica, inc, Encyclopedia Britannica, Volume 1, (Encyclopaedia Britannica: 2005), p.163</ref> Al-Ghazi's forces and their [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] allies came close to extinguishing the ancient Ethiopian kingdom, but the Abyssinians managed to secure the assistance of [[Cristóvão da Gama]]'s [[Portugal|Portuguese]] troops and maintain their domain's autonomy. However, both polities in the process exhausted their resources and manpower, which resulted in the contraction of both powers and changed regional dynamics for centuries to come.

The [[Ogaden War]] (13 July 1977 – 15 March 1978) was a conflict fought between the [[Ethiopia|Ethiopian government]] and [[Somalia|Somali government]]. The Djibouti government supported Somalia with [[military intelligence]]. In a notable illustration of the nature of Cold War alliances, the [[Soviet Union]] switched from supplying aid to Somalia to supporting Ethiopia, which had previously been backed by the [[United States]]. This in turn prompted the U.S. to later start supporting [[Somalia]]. The war ended when Somali forces retreated back across the border and a truce was declared.

The first war which involved the Djiboutian armed forces, was the [[Djiboutian Civil War]] between the Djiboutian government, supported by [[France]], and the [[Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy]] (''FRUD''). The war lasted from 1991 to 2001, although most of the hostilities ended when the moderate factions of FRUD signed a peace treaty with the government after suffering an extensive military setback when the government forces captured most of the rebel-held territory. A radical group continued to fight the government, but signed its own peace treaty in 2001. The war ended in a government victory, and FRUD became a political party.

Djibouti has fought in clashes against [[Eritrea]] over the [[Ras Doumeira]] peninsula, which both countries claim to be under their sovereignty. The first clash occurred in 1996 after a nearly two-months stand-off. In 1999, a political crisis occurred when both sides accused each other for supporting its enemies. In 2008, the countries clashed again when Djibouti refused to return Eritrean deserters and Eritrea responded by firing at the Djiboutian forces. In the following battles, some 44 Djiboutian troops and some estimated 100 Eritreans were killed.

In 2011, Djibouti troops also joined the [[African Union Mission to Somalia]].<ref name="Sdpaimtja">{{cite news|title=Somalia: Djibouti Peacekeepers Arrive in Mogadishu to Join Amisom|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201112211223.html|accessdate=22 March 2013|newspaper=Garowe Online|date=21 December 2011}}</ref>

As of 2013, the Djibouti Armed Forces (DJAF) are composed of three branches: the Djibouti National Army, which consists of the Coastal Navy, the Djiboutian Air Force (Force Aerienne Djiboutienne, FAD), and the National Gendarmerie (GN). The Army is by far the largest, followed by the Air Force and Navy. The Commander-in-Chief of the DJAF is the President of Djibouti and the Minister of Defence oversees the DJAF on a day-to-day basis.

It is responsible for the defence of mainland [[Djibouti]].

Its maneuver units are:

[[Djibouti]] has a small military than its neighbors. However, its security stops against foreign incursions. In reforming the [[Djiboutian Army]], most of the available attention and financial resources have been directed to the development of the Land Forces. Over the years, Djiboutian Army has benefited from material and financial support of various countries such as [[France]], [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Morocco]] and the [[United States]]. Currently, the amount allocated to defense represents the largest single entry in the country’s budget.

=== Djiboutian Navy ===
{{Main|Djiboutian Navy}}
[[File:Djiboutian Navy.jpg|thumb|right|Djiboutian Navy at naval base in [[Djibouti City]].]]
The Djiboutian Navy is the naval service branch of the Djibouti Armed Forces. It is responsible for securing Djibouti's territorial waters and 314 km seaboard. The force was launched two years after Djibouti gained its independence in 1977. Initially, it comprised the remnants of the Gendarmerie and was focused on port safety and traffic monitoring. This is an area known to have considerable fish stocks, sustaining an active fisheries industry. The acquisition of the several boats from the US in 2006 considerably increased the navy's ability to patrol over longer distances and to remain at sea for several days at a time. Cooperation with the US and Yemeni navies is also increasing in an effort to protect and maintain the safety and security of the Sea Lanes of Communication (SLOC).

=== Djiboutian Air Force ===
{{Main|Djibouti Air Force}}
The Djiboutian Air Force (DAF) (French: Force Aérienne du Djibouti (FAdD) is the Air Force of Djibouti. It was established as part of the Djibouti Armed Forces after the country obtained its independence on June 27, 1977. First aircraft included three Nord N.2501 Noratlas transport aircraft and an Allouette II helicopter presented by the French. In 1982, the Djibouti Air Force was augmented by two Aerospatiale AS.355F Ecureuil 2 helicopters and a Cessna U206G Stationair followed in 1985 by a Cessna 402C Utiliner. In 1985 the Allouette II was withdrawn from use and put on display at Ambouli Air Base as Djibouti's airport is called. Two years later the three N.2501 Noratlas were also put aside and given back to France later. New equipment came in 1991 by means of a Cessna 208 Caravan followed by all the Russian types in the early nineties. They included four Mi 2, six Mi 8 and two Mi 17 helicopters and a single Antonov An 28 light transport aircraft. Pilot training, if necessary, is conducted in France and continued on the type of flying at home although the need for new pilots isn't that big in the approximately 250 men of the Djibouti Air Force. The DAF has no units of its own and forms as a whole a part of the Army and its sole base is Ambouli.
