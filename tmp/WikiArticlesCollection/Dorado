'''Dorado''' {{IPAc-en|d|ɒ|ˈ|r|eɪ|d|oʊ}} is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky. It was named in the late 16th century and is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Its name refers to the [[coryphaenidae|dolphinfish]] (''Coryphaena hippurus''), which is known as ''dorado'' in Portuguese, although it has also been depicted as a [[swordfish]]. Dorado is notable for containing most of the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], the remainder being in the constellation [[Mensa (constellation)|Mensa]]. The [[ecliptic pole|South ecliptic pole]] also lies within this constellation.

Even though the name Dorado is not [[Latin]] but Portuguese, astronomers give it the Latin [[genitive]] form ''Doradus'' when naming its stars; they are treating it (like the adjacent constellation [[Argo Navis]]) as if it were a feminine proper name of Greek origin ending in -ō (like ''Io'' or ''Callisto'' or ''Argo''), names that have a genitive ending in ''-ūs''.

==History==
Dorado was one of twelve constellations named by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]],{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=140-141}} and it first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]].<!-- Preceding information not sourced to Staal 1988 --> Its first depiction in a celestial atlas was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603 where it was also named Dorado. Dorado has been represented historically as a [[dolphinfish]] and a [[swordfish]]; the latter depiction is inaccurate.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=244}} It has also been represented as a [[goldfish]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=140-141}} The constellation was also known in the 17th and 18th century as '''Xiphias''', the [[swordfish]], first attested in [[Johannes Kepler]]'s edition of [[Tycho Brahe]]'s star list in the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' of 1627. The name ''Dorado'' ultimately become dominant and was adopted by the [[IAU]].

===Stars ===
{{see also|List of stars in Dorado}}

[[Alpha Doradus]] is a blue-white star of magnitude 3.3, 176 light-years from Earth. It is the brightest star in Dorado. [[Beta Doradus]] is a notably bright [[Cepheid variable]] star. It is a yellow-tinged supergiant star that has a minimum magnitude of 4.1 and a maximum magnitude of 3.5. 1040 light-years from Earth, Beta Doradus has a period of 9 days and 20 hours.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=140-141}}

[[R Doradus]] is one of the many [[variable star]]s in Dorado. [[S Doradus|S Dor]], 9.721 [[hypergiant]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], is the prototype of [[S Doradus variable]] stars. The variable star [[R Doradus]] 5.73 has the largest {{as of|1997|alt=known}} apparent size of any star.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=r+doradus&NbIdent=1&Radius=2&Radius.unit=arcmin&submit=submit+id |title = R Doradus |accessdate = 28 July 2012 |publisher = SIMBAD}}</ref> [[Gamma Doradus]] is the prototype of the [[Gamma Doradus variable]] stars.

[[SN1987A|Supernova 1987A]] was the closest supernova to occur since the invention of the telescope. [[SNR 0509-67.5]] is the remnant of an unusually energetic Type 1a supernova from about 400 years ago. 

[[HE 0437-5439]] is a [[hypervelocity star]] escaping from the [[Milky Way]]/[[Magellanic Cloud]] system.

Dorado is also the location of the South [[Ecliptic pole]], which lies near the fish's head. The pole was called "Polus Doradinalis" by [[Willem Jansson Blaeu]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=244}}

===Deep-sky objects===
Because Dorado contains part of the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], it is rich in deep sky objects. The Large Magellanic Cloud, 1,000 light-years in diameter, is a [[satellite galaxy]] of the Milky Way, located at a distance of 179,000 light-years. It has been deformed by its gravitational interactions with the larger Milky Way. In 1987, it became host to [[SN 1987A]], the first supernova of 1987 and the closest since 1604.<ref name="objects">{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1=Wilkins |first1=Jamie |last2=Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |year = 2006 |accessdate = 29 April 2012 |edition = 1st |location=Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}</ref> This 25,000 light-year wide galaxy contains over 10,000 million stars.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=140-141}} All coordinates given are for Epoch [[J2000.0]].

The western portion is colored green from [[doubly-ionized oxygen]], the southern portion is red from [[hydrogen alpha]] emissions, and the center region is colored yellow from both oxygen and hydrogen emissions.

* '''[[NGC 2070]]''' is a nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud, also known as the Tarantula Nebula and named for its spiderlike shape. It is also designated 30 Doradus, as it is visible to the naked eye as a slightly out-of-focus star. Larger than any nebula in the Milky Way at 1000 light-years in diameter, it is also brighter, because it is illuminated by a cluster of stars, [[R136]]. The illuminating stars are [[supergiant]]s.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=140-141}}

It is approximately 35 light-years in diameter and is shaped by an incredibly hot star at its center, which has a [[stellar wind]] speed of 7 million kilometers per hour.
