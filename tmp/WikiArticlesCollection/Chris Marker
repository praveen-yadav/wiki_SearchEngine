'''Chris Marker''' ({{IPA-fr|maʁkɛʁ|lang}}; 29 July 1921 – 29 July 2012) was a French writer, photographer, documentary film director, [[multimedia]] artist and [[Essay#Film|film essayist]]. His best known films are ''[[La Jetée]]'' (1962), ''[[A Grin Without a Cat]]'' (1977), ''[[Sans Soleil]]'' (1983) and ''[[AK (film)|AK]]'' (1985), an essay film on the Japanese filmmaker [[Akira Kurosawa]]. Marker is often associated with the [[Left Bank Cinema]] movement that occurred in the late 1950s and included such other filmmakers as [[Alain Resnais]], [[Agnès Varda]], [[Henri Colpi]] and [[Armand Gatti]].

His friend and sometime collaborator Alain Resnais has called him "the prototype of the twenty-first-century man."<ref name="Wakeman">Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 2. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1988. 649–654.</ref> Film theorist Roy Armes has said of him: "Marker is unclassifiable because he is unique...The French Cinema has its dramatists and its poets, its technicians, and its autobiographers, but only has one true essayist: Chris Marker."<ref name="Wakeman" />

==Early life==

Marker was born '''Christian François Bouche-Villeneuve'''. Always elusive about his past and known to refuse interviews and not allow photographs to be taken of him, his place of birth is highly disputed.<ref name="Wakeman" /> Some sources and Marker himself claim that he was born in [[Ulan Bator]], Mongolia.<ref>Thomson, David, ''The New Biographical Dictionary of Film''{{spaced ndash}} Fourth Edition, Little, Brown (2003).</ref> Other sources say he was born in [[Belleville, Paris]], and others, in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]].<ref name="Wakeman" /> The 1949 edition of ''Le Cœur Net'' specifies his birthday as 22 July. Film critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] has stated: "Marker told me himself that Mongolia is correct. I have since concluded that Belleville is correct — but that does not spoil the spiritual truth of Ulan Bator."<ref>Thomson, David, The New Biographical Dictionary of Film{{spaced ndash}} Fifth Edition, Little, Brown (2010).</ref> When asked about his secretive nature, Marker has said "My films are enough for them [the audience]."<ref name="Wakeman" />

Marker was a philosophy student in France prior to World War II. During the German occupation of France he joined the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis (FTP)]], a part of the [[French Resistance]]. At some point during the war he left France and joined the [[United States Air Force]] as a paratrooper,<ref name="Wakeman" /> although some sources claim that this is a myth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chrismarker.org/2008/03/nyt-all-movie-guides-chris-marker-bio/ |title=NYT & All Movie Guide’s Chris Marker Bio – Notes from the Era of Imperfect Memory |publisher=Chrismarker.org |date=29 July 1921 |accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref> After the war he began a career as a journalist. He first wrote for the journal ''[[Esprit (magazine)|Esprit]]'', a neo-Catholic, Marxist magazine where he met fellow journalist [[André Bazin]]. At ''Esprit'', Marker wrote political commentaries, poems, short stories and (with Bazin) film reviews. He would later become an early contributor to Bazin's ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]''.<ref name="Wakeman" />

During this time period, Marker began to travel around the world as a journalist and photographer, a vocation he would continue the rest of his life. He was hired by the French publishing company [[Éditions du Seuil]] as editor of the series ''Petite Planète'' (''Small World''). This collection devoted one edition to each country and included information and photographs.<ref name="Wakeman" /> In 1949 Marker published his first novel, ''Le Coeur net'' (''The Forthright Spirit''), which was about aviation. In 1952 Marker published an illustration essay on French writer [[Jean Giraudoux]], ''Giraudoux Par Lui-Même''.<ref name="Wakeman" />

==Early career (1950–1961)==

During his early journalism career, Marker became increasingly interested in filmmaking and experimented with photography in the early 1950s. Around this time Marker met and befriended many members of what would be called the [[Left Bank Cinema|Left Bank Film Movement]], including [[Alain Resnais]], [[Agnès Varda]], [[Henri Colpi]], [[Armand Gatti]] and the novelists [[Marguerite Duras]] and [[Jean Cayrol]]. This group is often associated with the [[French New Wave]] directors who came to prominence during the same time period, and indeed both groups were often friends and journalistic co-workers. The term ''Left Bank'' was first coined by film critic [[Richard Roud]],<ref name=hfa>{{cite web|title=The Left Bank Revisited: Marker, Resnais, Varda|work=Harvard Film Archive|url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2000mayjun/leftbank.html|accessdate=16 August 2008}}</ref> who has described them as having "fondness for a kind of [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] life and an impatience with the conformity of the Right Bank, a high degree of involvement in literature and the [[plastic arts]], and a consequent interest in [[experimental film]]making", as well as an identification with the political [[left wing|left]].<ref name=hfa/> Many of Marker's earliest films were produced by [[Anatole Dauman]].

In 1952 Marker made his first film, ''[[Olympia 52]]'', a 16mm feature documentary about the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Helsinki Olympic Games]]. In 1953 Marker collaborated with Resnais on the documentary ''[[Statues Also Die]]''. The film examines traditional [[African art]] such as sculptures and masks, and its decline with coming of Western colonialism. The film won the 1954 [[Prix Jean Vigo]], but was banned by French censors for its criticism of French colonialism.<ref name="Wakeman" />

After working as assistant director on Resnais's ''[[Night and Fog (1955 film)|Night and Fog]]'' in 1955, Marker made ''Sunday in Peking'', a short documentary "[[Essay#Film|film essay]]" that would characterize Marker's unique film style for most of his career. The film was shot in two weeks by Marker while he was traveling through China with Armand Gatti in September 1955. In the film, Marker's commentary overlaps scenes from China, such as tombs which, contrary to Westernized understandings of Chinese legends, do not contain the remains of any [[Ming Dynasty]] emperors.<ref name="Wakeman" />

After working on the commentary for Resnais' film ''Le mystère de l'atelier quinze'' in 1957, Marker continued to form his own cinematic style with the feature documentary ''Letter from Siberia''. An essay on the gradual destruction of Siberia's culture and individuality, the film combines footage that Marker shot in [[Siberia]], old newsreel footage, cartoons, stills and, at one point, an illustration of [[Alfred E. Neuman]] from ''[[Mad Magazine]]'', all accompanied by Marker's signature commentary, which takes the form of a letter from the director to his audience. In one sequence, Marker repeats the same collection of shots three times with different commentary: the first one praising the Soviet Union, the second denouncing it, and the third taking an objective stance.<ref name="Wakeman" />

In 1959 Marker made the animated film ''Les Astronautes'' with [[Walerian Borowczyk]]. The film was a combination of traditional drawings with still photography. In 1960 Marker made ''Description d'un combat'', a documentary on the [[Israel|State of Israel]] which reminisces on the country's past and future.<ref name="Wakeman" /> The film won the Golden Bear for Best Documentary at the [[11th Berlin International Film Festival|1961 Berlin Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Preise & Auszeichnungen 1961|date=|work=berlinale.de|url=http://www.berlinale.de/de/archiv/jahresarchive/1961/03_preistr_ger_1961/03_Preistraeger_1961.html}}</ref>

In January 1961, Marker traveled to Cuba and shot the film ''¡Cuba Sí!''. The film promotes and defends [[Fidel Castro]] and includes two interviews with the Comandante. The film ends with an anti-American epilogue in which the United States is embarrassed by the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] fiasco, and was subsequently banned. The banned essay was included in Marker's first volume of collected film commentaries, ''Commentaires I'', published in 1961. The following year Marker published ''Coréennes'', a collection of photographs and essays on the conditions of [[Korea]].<ref name="Wakeman" />

==''La jetée'' and ''Le joli mai'' (1962–1966)==

[[File:La jetee.jpg|thumb|left|"The Man" in ''La jetée'', played by Davos Hanich.]]
Marker became known internationally for the short film ''[[La jetée]]'' (''The Pier'') in 1962. It tells of a [[post-apocalyptic science fiction|post-nuclear war]] experiment in [[time travel]] by using a series of filmed photographs developed as a [[photomontage]] of varying pace, with limited narration and sound effects. In the film, a survivor of a futuristic third World War is obsessed with a distant and disconnected memories of a pier at the [[Orly Airport]], the image of a mysterious woman, and a man's death. Scientists experimenting in time travel choose him for their studies, and the man travels back in time to contact the mysterious woman, and discovers that the man's death at the Orly Airport was his own. Except for one shot of the woman mentioned above sleeping and suddenly waking up, the film is composed entirely of photographs by Jean Chiabaud and stars Davos Hanich as the man, [[Hélène Chatelain]] as the woman and filmmaker [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]] as a man from the future.

''La Jetée'' was the inspiration for [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s 1987 debut live action feature ''[[The Red Spectacles]]'' (and later for parts of Oshii's 2001 film ''[[Avalon (2001 film)|Avalon]]'' as well) and also inspired [[Terry Gilliam]]'s ''[[12 Monkeys]]'' (1995). It also inspired many of director [[Mira Nair]]'s shots for the 2006 film ''[[The Namesake (film)|The Namesake]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

While making ''La Jetee'', Marker was simultaneously making the 150-minute documentary essay-film ''[[Le joli mai]]'', released in 1963. Beginning in the Spring of 1962, Marker and his camera operator Pierre Lhomme shot 55 hours of footage interviewing random people on the streets of Paris. The questions, asked by the unseen Marker, range from their personal lives, as well as social and political issues of relevance at that time. Like he had with montages of landscapes and indigenous art, Marker created a film essay that contrasts and juxtaposes a variety of lives with his signature commentary (spoken by Marker's friends, singer-actor [[Yves Montand]] in the French version and [[Simone Signoret]] in the English version). The film has been compared to the ''[[Cinéma vérité]]'' films of [[Jean Rouch]], and criticized by its practitioners at the time.<ref name="Wakeman" /> The term "Cinéma vérité" was itself anathema to Marker; he would never use it. It was shown in competition at the 1963 [[Venice Film Festival]], where it won the award for Best First Work. It also won the Golden Dove Award at the Leipzig DOK Festival.

After the documentary ''Le Mystère Koumiko'' in 1965, Marker made ''Si j'avais quatre dromadaires'', an essay-film that, like ''La jetée'', is a [[photomontage]] of over 800 photographs that Marker had taken over the past 10 years from 26 countries. The commentary takes on a slightly different dimension than his previous commentaries by using a fictitious photographer have a conversation with two friends to discuss the photos. The film's title is an allusion to a poem by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]. It was the last film in which Marker includes "travel footage" for many years.<ref name="Wakeman" />

==SLON and ISKRA (1967–1974)==

In 1967 Marker published his second volume of collected film essays, ''Commentaires II''. That same year, Marker organized the omnibus film ''[[Far from Vietnam|Loin du Vietnam]]'', a protest against the [[Vietnam War]] with segments contributed by Marker, [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Alain Resnais]], [[Agnès Varda]], [[Claude Lelouch]], [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]], Michele Ray and [[Joris Ivens]]. The film includes footage of the war, from both sides, as well as anti-war protests in New York and Paris and other anti-war activities.

From this initial collection of filmmakers with left-wing political agendas, Marker created the group S.L.O.N. (Société pour le lancement des oeuvres nouvelles, but also the Russian word for elephant).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chrismarker.org/wounded-time/ |title=Wounded Time – Notes from the Era of Imperfect Memory |publisher=Chrismarker.org |date= |accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref> SLON was a film collective whose objectives were to make films and to encourage industrial workers to create film collectives of their own. Its members included Valerie Mayoux, Jean-Claude Lerner, Alain Adair and John Tooker. Marker is usually credited as director or co-director of all of the films made by SLON.<ref name="Wakeman" />

After the events of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]], Marker felt a moral obligation to abandon his own personal film career and devote himself to SLON and its activities. SLON's first film was about a strike at a Rhodiacéta factory in France, ''[[À bientôt, j'espère]]'' (''Rhodiacéta'') in 1968.<ref name="Wakeman" /> Later that year SLON made ''La Sixième face du pentagone'', about an anti-war protest in Washington, D.C. and was a reaction to what SLON considered to be the unfair and censored reportage of such events on mainstream television. The film was shot by [[François Reichenbach]], who received co-director credit. ''La Bataille des dix millions'' was made in 1970 with Mayoux as co-director and [[Santiago Álvarez (filmmaker)|Santiago Álvarez]] as cameraman and is about the 1970 sugar crop in Cuba and its disastrous effects on the country. In 1971, SLON made ''Le Train en marche'', a new prologue to Soviet filmmaker Aleksandr Medvedkin's 1935 film ''Schastye'', which had recently been re-released in France.<ref name="Wakeman" />

In 1974, SLON became I.S.K.R.A. (''Images, Sons, Kinescope, Réalisations, Audiovisuelles'', but also the name of [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s political newspaper ''[[Iskra]]'').<ref name="Wakeman" />

==Return to personal work (1974–1986)==

In 1974 returned to his personal work and made a film outside of ISKRA. ''La Solitude du chanteur de fond'' is a one-hour documentary about Marker's friend [[Yves Montand]]'s benefit concert for Chilean refugees. The concert was Montand's first public performance in four years and the film includes film clips from his long career as a singer and actor.<ref name="Wakeman" />

Marker had been working on a film about [[Chile]] with ISKRA since 1973. Marker had collaborated with Belgian sociologist [[Armand Mattelart]] and ISKRA members Valérie Mayoux and Jacqueline Meppiel to shoot and collect the visual materials, which Marker then edited together and provided the commentary for. The resulting film was the two and a half-hour documentary ''La Spirale'', released in 1975. The film chronicles recent events in Chile, beginning with the [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|1970 election]] of socialist President [[Salvador Allende]] until his [[Death of Salvador Allende|murder]] and [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|the resulting coup]] in 1973.<ref name="Wakeman" />

Marker then began work on one of his most ambitious films, ''[[A Grin Without a Cat]]'', released in 1977. The film's title refers to the [[Cheshire Cat]] from ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''. The metaphor compares the promise of the global socialist movement before [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] (the grin) with its actual presence in the world after May 1968 (the cat). The film's original French title is ''Le fond de l'air est rouge'', which means "the air is essentially red", or "revolution is in the air", implying that the socialist movement existed only in the air.<ref name="Sterritt">{{Cite journal|last=Sterritt|first=David|authorlink=David Sterritt|year=2009|url=http://www.cineaste.com/articles/ema-grin-without-a-catem|title=A Grin Without a Cat|work=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]|publisher=Cineaste Publishers|volume=34|issue=4|accessdate=31 July 2011}}</ref>

The film was intended to be an all encompassing portrait of political movements since May 1968, a summation of the work which he had taken part in for ten years. The film is divided into two parts: the first half focuses on the hopes and idealism before May 1968, and the second half on the disillusion and disappointments since those events. Marker begins the film with the [[The Battleship Potemkin#The Odessa Steps sequence|Odessa Steps sequence]] from [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s film ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'', which Marker points out is a fictitious creation of Eisenstein which has still influenced the image of the historical event. Marker used very little commentary in this film, but the film's montage structure and preoccupation with memory make it a Marker film. Upon release, the film was criticized for not addressing many current issues of the New Left such as the woman's movement, sexual liberation and worker self-management.<ref name="Wakeman" /> The film was re-released in the US in 2002.<ref name="Sterritt" />

In the late 1970s, Marker traveled extensively throughout the world, included an extended period in Japan. From this trip, Marker first published the [[photo-essay]] ''Le Dépays'' in 1982, as well as using the experience for his next film ''[[Sans Soleil]]'', released in 1982.<ref name="Wakeman" />

''[[Sans Soleil]]'' stretches the limits of what could be called a documentary. It is an essay, a [[Film editing|montage]], mixing pieces of documentary with fiction and philosophical comments, creating an atmosphere of [[dream]] and science fiction. The main themes are Japan, Africa, [[memory]] and travel. A sequence in the middle of the film takes place in San Francisco, and heavily references [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''. Marker has said that ''Vertigo'' is the only film "capable of portraying impossible memory, insane memory."<ref name="Wakeman" /> The film's commentary are credited to the fictitious cameraman Sandor Krasna, and read in the form of letters by an unnamed woman. Though centered around Japan, the film was also shot in such other countries as [[Guinea Bissau]], Ireland and [[Iceland]].<ref name="Wakeman" /> ''Sans Soleil'' was shown at the [[1983 Berlin Film Festival]] where it won the OCIC Award. It was also awarded the Sutherland Trophy at the 1983 [[British Film Institute]] Awards.

In 1984, Marker was invited by producer [[Serge Silberman]] to document the making of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]''. From this Marker made ''[[A.K. (film)|A.K.]]'', released in 1985. The film focuses more on Kurosawa's remote but polite personality than on the making of the film.<ref>[http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/2_AK Chicago Reader: Dave Kehr's Review of AK]</ref> The film was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1985 Cannes Film Festival]],<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1107/year/1985.html |title=Festival de Cannes: A.K. |accessdate=28 June 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> before ''Ran'' itself had been released.

In 1985, Marker's long-time friend and neighbor [[Simone Signoret]] died of cancer. Marker then made the one-hour TV documentary ''Mémoires pour Simone'' as a tribute to her in 1986.<ref name="Wakeman" />

==Multimedia and later career (1987–2012)==

Beginning with ''Sans Soleil'', he developed a deep interest in [[Digital data|digital]] technology, which led to his film ''Level 5'' (1996) and ''Immemory'' (1998, 2008),<ref>{{cite web|title=Chris Marker|url=http://www.eai.org/artistBio.htm?id=317|publisher=[[Electronic Arts Intermix]]|accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> an interactive multimedia [[CD-ROM]], produced for the [[Centre Pompidou]] (French language version) and from [[Exact Change]] (English version). Marker created a 19-minute multimedia piece in 2005 for the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City titled ''Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men'' which was influenced by [[T. S. Eliot]]'s [[The Hollow Men|poem]].<ref name=MOMA1>{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/115 |title=Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men |last=Staff |date=April 2005 | publisher = [[Museum of Modern Art]] |accessdate= 7 July 2012 }}</ref>

Marker lived in Paris and very rarely granted interviews. One exception was a lengthy interview with ''[[Libération]]'' in 2003 in which he explained his approach to filmmaking.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rare Marker|date=5 March 2003
|newspaper=[[Libération]]|url=http://next.liberation.fr/cinema/0101466984-rare-marker|language=French}}</ref> When asked for a picture of himself, he usually offered a photograph of a cat instead. (Marker was represented in Agnes Varda's 2008 documentary "The Beaches of Agnes" by a cartoon drawing of a cat, speaking in a technologically altered voice.) Marker's own cat is named Guillaume-en-egypte. In 2009 Marker commissioned an [[commons:File:Guillaume En-Egypte.png|Avatar of Guillaume-en-Egypte]] to represent him in machinima works. The avatar was created by Exosius Woolley and first appeared in the short film / machinima, "Ouvroir the Movie by Chris Marker."

In the 2007 Criterion Collection release of ''La Jetée'' and ''Sans Soleil'', Marker included a short essay, "Working on a shoestring budget". He confessed to shooting all of ''Sans Soleil'' with a silent film camera and recording all the audio on a primitive audio cassette recorder. Marker also reminds the reader that only one short scene in ''La Jetée'' is of a moving image, as Marker could only borrow a movie camera for one afternoon while working on the film.

Marker died on 29 July 2012, 91 years, to the day, after he was born.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bergan|first=Ronald|title=Chris Marker obituary|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/9439368/Chris-Marker.html|newspaper=telegraph.co.uk|date=30 July 2012}}</ref>
