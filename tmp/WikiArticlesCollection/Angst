'''''Angst''''' means [[fear]] or [[anxiety]] (''[[anguish]]'' is its [[Romance languages|Latinate]] [[cognate|equivalent]], and ''anxious,'' ''anxiety'' are of similar origin). The word ''angst'' was introduced into English from [[Danish language|Danish]] ''angst'' (first known use: circa 1942)<ref>http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/angst</ref> via [[existentialist]] [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. It is used in English to describe an intense feeling of apprehension, anxiety, or inner turmoil.
In other [[Germanic languages]] (such as German, Dutch and Danish) the word angst is not a [[loanword]] as it is in English, but has been in existence long, and is used regularly to express fear.

In [[German language|German]], the technical terminology of psychology and philosophy distinguishes between ''Angst'' and ''Furcht'' in that  ''Furcht'' is a negative anticipation regarding a concrete threat, while ''Angst'' is a non-directional and unmotivated emotion. In common language, however, ''Angst'' is the normal word for "fear", while ''Furcht'' is an elevated synonym.<ref name="Duden">[http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Furcht "Furcht" and "Angst" in the DUDEN]</ref>

In other languages having the meaning of the Latin word ''pavor'', the derived words differ in meaning, e.g. as in the French ''anxiété'' and ''peur''. The word ''Angst'' has existed since the 8th century, from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European root]] ''*anghu-'', "restraint" from which [[Old High German]] ''angust'' developed.<ref name=Collins >http://www.thefreedictionary.com/angst</ref> It is pre-cognate with the Latin ''angustia'', "tensity, tightness" and ''angor'', "choking, clogging"; compare to the Greek "άγχος" (ankhos): stress.

== Existentialism ==
In [[Existentialism|Existentialist]] [[philosophy]] the term ''angst'' carries a specific conceptual meaning. The use of the term was first attributed to [[Denmark|Danish]] [[philosopher]] [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813&ndash;1855). In ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'' (also known as ''The Concept of Dread'', depending on the translation), Kierkegaard used the word ''Angest'' (in common Danish, ''angst'', meaning "dread" or "anxiety") to describe a profound and deep-seated condition in [[human being]]s. Where animals are guided solely by [[instinct]], said Kierkegaard, human beings enjoy a freedom of choice that we find both appealing and terrifying.<ref name=Collins /><ref>{{cite news|first=Gordon|last=Marino|title=The Danish Doctor of Dread|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/the-danish-doctor-of-dread/|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|date=March 17, 2012|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref> Kierkegaard's concept of angst reappeared in the works of existentialist [[philosopher]]s who followed, such as [[Friedrich Nietsche]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], each of whom developed the idea further in individual ways. While Kierkegaard's angst referred mainly to ambiguous feelings about moral freedom within a [[religion|religious personal belief system]], later existentialists discussed conflicts of personal principles, cultural norms, and [[existential despair]].

== Music ==
Existential angst makes its appearance in classical [[musical composition]] in the early twentieth century as a result of both philosophical developments and as a reflection of the war-torn times. Notable composers whose works are often linked with the concept include [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]] (operas ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' and ''[[Salome]])'', [[Claude-Achille Debussy]] (opera ''[[Pelleas et Melisande]]'', ballet ''[[Jeux]]'', other works), [[Jean Sibelius]] (especially the Fourth Symphony), [[Arnold Schoenberg]] ''([[A Survivor from Warsaw]]'', other works), [[Alban Berg]], [[Francis Poulenc]] (opera ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites]]''), [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] (opera ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', symphonies and chamber music), [[Béla Bartók]] (opera ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'', other works), and [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] (especially ''[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]'').
 
Angst began to be discussed in reference to popular music in the mid- to late 1950s amid widespread concerns over [[Cold War|international tensions]] and [[nuclear proliferation]]. [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s book ''[[Bomb Culture]]'' (1968) traced angst in popular culture to [[Hiroshima]]. Dread was expressed in works of [[folk rock]] such as [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[Masters of War]]'' (1963) and ''[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]''. The term often makes an appearance in reference to [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[punk rock]], [[grunge]], [[nu metal]], [[emo]], and works of [[alternative rock]] where expressions of [[melancholy]], [[existential despair]] or [[nihilism]] predominate.
