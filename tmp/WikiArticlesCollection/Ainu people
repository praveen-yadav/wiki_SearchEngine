The {{Nihongo|'''Ainu'''|アイヌ|lead=yes}}, also called '''Aynu''', '''Aino''' (アイノ), and in historical texts '''[[Ezo]]''' (蝦夷), are an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] people in [[Japan]] ([[Hokkaidō]]) and [[Russia]] ([[Sakhalin]] and the [[Kuril Islands]]).

Historically, they spoke [[Ainu language|Ainu]] and [[Ainu languages|related varieties]]. Most of those who identify themselves as Ainu still live in this same region, though the exact number of living Ainu is unknown. This is due to confusion over mixed heritages and to [[ethnic issues in Japan]] resulting in those with Ainu backgrounds hiding their identities. Intermarriage with Japanese has blurred the concept of a pure Ainu ethnic group.<ref>{{cite book| author = Colin Ronald Baker| coauthors = Sylvia Prys Jones| title = Encyclopedia/Bilingualism/Bili| url = http://books.google.com/?id=YgtSqB9oqDIC&pg=PA163| year = 1998| publisher = Multilingual Matters| isbn = 978-1-85359-362-8| page = 163 }}</ref> Official estimates of the population are of around 25,000, while the unofficial number is upward of 200,000 people.<ref name="Poisson, B 2002, p.5">Poisson, B. 2002, ''The Ainu of Japan'', Lerner Publications, Minneapolis, p.5.</ref>

During the Tokugawa period (1600–1868) the Ainu became increasingly involved in trade with Japanese who controlled the southern portion of the island that is now called Hokkaido. The [[Bakufu]] government granted the [[Matsumae clan]] exclusive rights to trade with the Ainu in the northern part of the island. Later the Matsumae began to lease out trading-rights to Japanese merchants, and contact between Japanese and Ainu became more extensive. Throughout this period Ainu became increasingly dependent on goods imported by Japanese, and suffered from epidemic diseases such as [[smallpox]].<ref name="Brett L. Walker 2001, Pages 49-56">

Although the increased contact brought by trade between the Japanese and the Ainu contributed to increased mutual understanding, sometimes it led to conflict, occasionally intensifying into violent Ainu revolts, of which the most important was [[Shakushain's Revolt]] (1669–1672), an Ainu rebellion against Japanese authority.

In 1868 there were about 15,000 Ainu in Hokkaido, 2000 in Sakhalin, and around 100 in the Kurile islands.<ref>

In a 2009 news story, ''Japan Today'' reported, "Many Ainu were forced to work, essentially as slaves, for [[Yamato people|Wajin]] (ethnic Japanese), resulting in the breakup of families and the introduction of [[smallpox]], [[measles]], cholera and [[tuberculosis]] into their community. In 1869, the new Meiji government renamed Ezo as Hokkaido and unilaterally incorporated it into Japan. It banned the Ainu language, took Ainu land away, and prohibited salmon fishing and deer hunting."<ref>" [http://www.japantoday.com/category/lifestyle/view/tokyo%E2%80%99s-thriving-ainu-community-keeps-traditional-culture-alive Tokyo’s thriving Ainu community keeps traditional culture alive]," ''[[Japan Today]]'', March 1, 2009.</ref> 

The beginning of the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868 proved a turning point for Ainu culture. The Japanese government introduced a variety of social, political and economic reforms in hope of modernising the country in the Western style. One innovation involved the annexation of Hokkaido. Sjöberg quotes Baba's (1980) account of the Japanese government's reasoning:<ref name="Brett L. Walker 2001, Pages 49-56"/>

<blockquote>
" … The development of Japan's large northern island had several objectives: First, it was seen as a means to defend Japan from a rapidly developing and expansionist Russia.  Second … it offered a solution to the unemployment for the former samurai class … Finally, development promised to yield the needed natural resources for a growing capitalist economy."<ref>Sjöberg, K 1993, The Return of the Ainu, Harwood Academic Publishers, Switzerland.</ref>
</blockquote>

In 1899 the Japanese government passed an act labeling the Ainu as "former aborigines", with the idea they would assimilate—this resulted in the Japanese government taking the land where the Ainu people lived and placing it from then on under Japanese control.<ref>
Loos, N. & Osani, T. 1993, ''Indigenous Minorities and Education'', Sanyusha Publishing Co., Ltd., Tokyo.
</ref> Also at this time, the Ainu were granted automatic Japanese citizenship, effectively denying them the status of an indigenous group.

[[File:AinuBearSacrificeCirca1870.jpg|thumb|250px|Ainu bear sacrifice. Japanese scroll painting, c. 1870.]]

The Ainu were becoming increasingly marginalized on their own land—over a period of only 36 years, the Ainu went from being a relatively isolated group of people to having their land, language, religion and customs assimilated into those of the Japanese.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news |first= Philippa |last= Fogarty|title=  Recognition at last for Japan's Ainu|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7437244.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date= June 6, 2008|accessdate=June 7, 2008 }}</ref>  In addition to this, the land the Ainu lived on was distributed to the Wajin who had decided to move to Hokkaido, who had been encouraged by the Japanese government of the Meiji era to take advantage of the island’s abundance of natural resources, and to create and maintain farms in the model of western industrial agriculture.   While at the time the process was openly referred to as colonization ("takushoku" 拓殖), the notion was later reframed by Japanese elites to the currently common usage "kaitaku"(開拓), which instead conveys a sense of opening up or reclamation of the Ainu lands.<ref>Siddle, R., ''Race, Resistance, and the Ainu of Japan'' (Routledge, 1996) p. 51.</ref>  As well as this, factories such as flour mills and beer breweries and mining practices resulted in the creation of infrastructure such as roads and railway lines, during a development period that lasted until 1904.<ref>Sjöberg, K. 1993, ''The Return of the Ainu'', Harwood Academic Publishers, Switzerland, p. 117.</ref>  During this time the Ainu were forced to learn Japanese, required to adopt Japanese names and ordered to cease religious practices such as animal sacrifice and the custom of tattooing.<ref>{{cite book|last= Levinson|first= David |title=Encyclopedia of modern Asia, Vol.&nbsp;1|publisher= Charles Scribner's Sons|page= 72|year= 2002|isbn= 978-0-684-80617-4}}</ref>

The 1899 act mentioned above was replaced in 1997—until then the government had stated there were no ethnic minority groups.<ref name="Sato, Takehiro 2007"/> It was not until June 6, 2008 that Japan formally recognised the Ainu as an indigenous group (see [[#Official recognition|Official Recognition]], below).<ref name="Sato, Takehiro 2007"/>

[[File:Oki Ainu Dub Band at tff.Rudolstadt 2007.jpg|thumb|left|The Oki Dub Ainu Band, led by the Ainu Japanese musician [[Oki (musician)|Oki]], in Germany in 2007.]]
Intermarriages between Japanese and Ainu were actively promoted by the Ainu to lessen the chances of discrimination against their offspring. As a result, many Ainu are indistinguishable from their Japanese neighbors, but some Ainu-Japanese are interested in traditional Ainu culture. For example, [[Oki (musician)|Oki]], born as a child of an Ainu father and a Japanese mother, became a musician who plays the traditional Ainu instrument ''[[tonkori]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmv.co.jp/news/article/605230042/|title=アイヌ⇔ダブ越境！異彩を放つOKIの新作|language=Japanese|publisher=HMV Japan|date=May 23, 2006|accessdate=March 26, 2011}}</ref> There are many small towns in the southeastern or [[Hidaka Subprefecture|Hidaka]] region where full-blooded Ainu may still be seen such as in [[Nibutani]] ([[Ainu language|Ainu]]: ''Niputay''). Many such children live in [[Sambutsu]] especially, on the eastern coast. In 1966 the number of "pure" Ainu was  about 300 (Honna, Tajima, and Minamoto, 2000).

Their most widely known [[ethnonym]] is derived from the word ''ainu'', which means "human" (particularly as opposed to ''kamui'', divine beings), basically neither ethnicity nor the name of a race, in the Hokkaidō dialects of the [[Ainu language]]; '''[[Emishi]]''' (Ebisu) and '''[[Ezo]]''' {{IPA|[endzo]}} (Yezo)  (both {{lang|ja|蝦夷}}) are Japanese terms, which are believed to derive from another word for "human", which otherwise survived in Sakhalin Ainu as ''enciw'' or ''enju''. Today, many Ainu dislike the term Ainu because it had once been used with derogatory nuance, and prefer to identify themselves as ''Utari'' (''comrade'' in the Ainu language). Official documents use both names.

===Official recognition===
[[File:Map of Ainu in Hokkaido.svg|thumb|350px|Map of Ainu in Hokkaido]]
On June 6, 2008, a bipartisan, non-binding resolution was approved by the [[Japanese Diet]] calling upon the government to recognize the Ainu people as [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous to Japan]], and urging an end to discrimination against the group. The resolution recognised the Ainu people as "an indigenous people with a distinct language, religion and culture", and rescinded the 1899 law.<ref name="bbc"/><ref name="japantimes2008">{{cite web|author=Ito, M|title=Diet officially declares Ainu indigenous|work=The Japan Times |date=June 7, 2008|accessdate=April 29, 2009|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080607a1.html}}</ref>
<!--
 Though the resolution is historically significant, Hideaki Uemura, professor at [[Keisen University]] in Tokyo and a specialist in indigenous peoples' rights, commented that the motion is "weak in the sense of recognizing historical facts" as the Ainu were "forced" to become Japanese in the first place.<ref name="japantimes2008" />

===Official recognition in Russia===
{{main|Ainu in Russia}}
As a result of the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)]], the Kuril Islands were handed over to Japan, along with its Ainu subjects. A total of 83 North Kuril Ainu arrived in [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] on September 18, 1877 after they decided to remain under Russian rule. They refused the offer by Russian officials to move to new reservations in the [[Commander Islands]]. Finally a deal was reached in 1881 and the Ainu decided to settle in the village of Yavin. In March 1881 the group left Petropavlovsk and started the journey towards Yavin by foot. Four months later, they arrived at their new homes. Another village, Golygino was founded later. Under Soviet rule, both the villages were forced to disband and residents were moved to the Russian dominated Zaporozhye rural settlement in [[Ust-Bolsheretsky District|Ust-Bolsheretsky Raion]].<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIErWxe16k Камчадальские айны добиваются признания - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> As a result of intermarriage, the three ethnic groups assimilated to form the [[Kamchadals|Kamchadal]] community. In 1953, K. Omelchenko, the minister for the protection of military and state secrets in USSR banned the press from publishing any more information on the Ainu living in the USSR. This order was revoked after two decades.<ref>[http://kamchatka-etno.ru/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=85&Itemid=95 Айны<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Ainu Hunters.jpg|thumb|upright|Ainu hunters, 19th century]]
The North Kuril Ainu of Zaporozhye are currently the largest Ainu subgroup in Russia. The Nakamura clan (South Kuril Ainu on their paternal side) are the smallest and numbers just 6 people residing in [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk]]. On Sakhalin island, there are a few dozen people who identify themselves as Sakhalin Ainu, but many more with partial Ainu ancestry do not acknowledge it. Most of the 888 Japanese people living in Russia (2010 Census) are of mixed Japanese-Ainu ancestry, although they do not acknowledge it (full Japanese ancestry gives them the right of visa-free entry to Japan<ref>[http://www.5-tv.ru/news/37800/ В России снова появились айны - самый загадочный народ Дальнего востока<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>). Similarly, no one identifies themselves as Amur Valley Ainu, although people with partial descent can be found in Khabarovsk. It is believed that there are no remaining living descendants of the Kamchatka Ainu.

In the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census of Russia]], close to 100 people tried to register themselves as ethnic Ainu in the village, but the governing council of Kamchatka Krai rejected their claim and enrolled them as ethnic Kamchadal.<ref>[http://www.kamchatka-etno.ru/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=85&Itemid=95 Айны<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://pk.russiaregionpress.ru/archives/4889 Петропавловск-Камчатский » Айны – древние и таинственные<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2011, the leader of the Ainu community in Kamchatka, Alexei Vladimirovich Nakamura requested that Vladimir Ilyukhin (Governor of Kamchatka) and Boris Nevzorov (Chairman of state Duma) include the Ainu in the central list of the [[Indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East]]. This request was also turned down.<ref>[http://severdv.ru/news/show/?id=52022&r=27&p=41 Айны просят включить их в Единый перечень коренных народов России.

Ethnic Ainu living in [[Sakhalin Oblast]] and [[Khabarovsk Krai]] are not organized politically. According to Alexei Nakamura, as of 2012, there are only 205 Ainu living in Russia (up from just 12 people who self-identified as Ainu in 2008) and they along with the Kurile Kamchadals ([[Itelmens|Itelmen]] of Kuril islands) are fighting for official recognition.<ref>[http://nazaccent.ru/interview/13/ Алексей Накамура - Интервью<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.segodnia.ru/content/105359 Айны – борцы с самураями | Сегодня.ру<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Since the Ainu are not recognized in the official list of the peoples living in Russia, they are counted as people without nationality or as ethnic Russian or Kamchadal.<ref>[http://www.rg.ru/2008/04/03/reg-dvostok/ainu.html Представители малочисленного народа айну хотят узаконить свой статус — Светлана Богданова — "Без национальности" — Российская газета — Айну входят лишь в перечень коренных мал...<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2004 the small Ainu community living in Kamchatka Krai wrote a letter to [[Vladimir Putin]], urging him to reconsider any move to award the [[Kuril Islands dispute|Southern Kuril Islands]] to Japan. They also urged him to recognize the Japanese genocide against the Ainu people, which Putin declined.<ref>[http://kamtime.ru/old/archive/08_12_2004/13.shtml Камчатское Время<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> According to the community, their tragedy is comparable in scale and intensity only with the genocide faced by the indigenous people of the Americas.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

As of 2012, both the Kurile Ainu and Kurile Kamchadal ethnic groups lack the fishing and hunting rights which the Russian government grants to the indigenous tribal communities of the far north.<ref>[http://www.indigenous.ru/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=894 Льыоравэтльан - Представители малочисленного народа айну на Камчатке хотят узаконить свой статус<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://english.ruvr.ru/radio_broadcast/2249159/49638669.html Radio: Programs: The Ainu: one of Russia’s indigenous peoples: Voice of Russia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Origins===
[[File:AinuManStilflied.JPG|thumb|Ainu man, circa 1880.]]

[[Mark J. Hudson]], Professor of Anthropology at [[Nishikyushu University]], [[Kanzaki, Saga]], Japan, said Japan was settled by a "Proto-Mongoloid" population in the [[Pleistocene]] who became the Jōmon and their features can be seen in the Ainu and [[Ryukyuans|Okinawan]] people.<ref name="Hudson">Hudson, Mark J.

Anthropologist [[Arnold Henry Savage Landor]] described the Ainu as having deep-set eyes and an eye shape typical of Europeans, with a large and prominent browridge, large ears, hairy and prone to [[baldness]], slightly flattened hook nose with large and broad nostrils, prominent cheek bones, large mouth and thick lips and a long region from nose to mouth and small chin region.<ref>Arnold Henry Savage Landor (1970). Alone with the hairy Ainu: or, 3.800 miles on a pack saddle in Yezo and a cruise to the Kurile islands</ref>

Omoto has also shown that the Ainu are Mongoloid, and not Caucasoid, on the basis of fingerprints and dental morphology.<ref>{{cite book| author = L.

Very few of them have wavy brownish hair. Their skins are generally reported to be light brown. But this is due to the fact that they labor on the sea and in briny winds all day. Old people who have long desisted from their outdoor work are often found to be as white as western men. The Ainu have broad faces, beetling eyebrows, and large sunken eyes, which are generally horizontal and of the so-called European type. Eyes of the Mongolian type are hardly found among them''.

==Geography==
[[File:Historical expanse of the Ainu.svg|250px|thumb|right|Historical expanse of Ainu]]
The Ainu were distributed in the northern and central islands of Japan, from Sakhalin island in the north to the Kuril islands and the island of Hokkaidō and Northern Honshū, although some investigators place their former range as throughout Honshū and as far north as the southern tip of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] in what is now [[Cape Lopatka]]. The island of Hokkaido was known to the Ainu as Ainu Moshir, and was formally annexed by the Japanese at the late date of 1868, partly as a means of preventing the intrusion of the Russians, and partly for imperialist reasons.

[[File:V.M. Doroshevich-Sakhalin. Part II. Group of Ainu People.png|thumb|left|A group of Sakhalin Ainu c.&nbsp;1903]]
According to the [[Russian Empire Census]] of 1897, 1,446 persons in the Russian Empire reported Ainu language as their mother tongue, 1,434 of them in Sakhalin Island.<ref>[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php?reg=o Russian Empire Census of 1897: Totals]
[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php?reg=113 Russian Empire Census of 1897: Sakhalin] {{ru icon}}</ref>

The southern half of Sakhalin was acquired by Japan as a result of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–05, but at the end of World War II in 1945, the Soviets [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria (1945)|declared war on Japan]] and took possession of the Kuril islands and southern Sakhalin. The Ainu population, as previously Japanese subjects, were "repatriated" to Japan.

During Tsarist times, the Ainu living in Russia were forbidden from identifying themselves as such, since Imperial Japanese officials claimed that all the regions inhabited by the Ainu in the past or present belonged to Japan. The terms "Kurile", "Kamchatka Kurile", etc., were used to identify the ethnic group. During Soviet times, people with Ainu surnames were sent to gulags and labor camps, as they were often mistaken for Japanese. As a result, large numbers of Ainu changed their surnames to Slavic ones. After World War II, most of the Ainu living in Sakhalin were deported to Japan. Of the 1,159 Ainu, only around 100 remained in Russia. Of those who remained, only the elderly were full-blooded Ainu. Others were either mixed race or married to ethnic Russians. The last of the Ainu households disappeared in the late 1960s, when Yamanaka Kitaro committed suicide after the death of his wife. The couple was childless.<ref>[http://www.agesmystery.ru/node/630 У последней черты – Айны о себе | Тайны веков<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> To eradicate Ainu identity, Soviet authorities removed the ethnic group from the list of nationalities which could be mentioned in a Soviet passport. Due to this, children born after 1945 were not able to identify themselves as Ainu. The last known deportation of Ainu to Japan occurred in 1982, when Keizo Nakamura, a full blooded Northern Kuril Ainu, was deported to Hokkaido after serving 15 years' hard labor in the province of [[Magadan Oblast|Magadan]]. His wife, Tamara Timofeevna Pikhteevoi, was of mixed Sakhalin Ainu and Gilyak ancestry. After the arrest of Keizo in 1967, Tamara and her son Alexei Nakamura were expelled from Kamchatka Krai and sent to the island of Sakhalin, to live in the city of [[Tomari, Russia|Tomari]]. 
[[File:Ainus.jpg|thumb|upright|Ainus on a [[Matsumae clan|Matsumae]] border customs, 18th century]]
Unlike the other Ainu clans currently living in Russia, there is considerable doubt whether the Nakamura clan of Kamchatka should be identified as Northern Kuril Ainu, Southern Kuril Ainu or as Kamchatka Ainu. This is due to the fact that the clan originally immigrated to Kamchatka from [[Kunashir]] in 1789. The Ainu of Kunashir are South Kuril Ainu. They settled down near [[Kurile Lake]], which was inhabited by the Kamchatka Ainu and North Kuril Ainu. In 1929 the Ainu of [[Kurile Lake]] fled to the island of [[Paramushir]] after an armed conflict with the Soviet authorities. At that time, Paramushir was under Japanese rule. During the [[Invasion of the Kuril Islands]], Akira Nakamura (b.&nbsp;1897) was captured by the Soviet army and his elder son Takeshi Nakamura (1925–45) was killed in the battle. Akira's only surviving son, Keizo (b.&nbsp;1927), was taken prisoner and joined the Soviet Army after his capture. After the war, Keizo went to [[Korsakov (town)|Korsakov]] to work in the local harbor. In 1963 he married Tamara Pikhtivoi, a member of the Sakhalin Ainu tribe. Their only child Alexei was born in 1964. The descendants of Tamara and Alexei are found in Kamchatka and Sakhalin. 

In 1979 the USSR removed the term "Ainu" from the list of ''living'' ethnic groups of Russia, an act by which the government proclaimed that the Ainu as an ethnic group were extinct in its territory. According to the 2002 Russian Federation census, no responders gave the ethnonym Ainu in boxes 7 or 9.2 in the K-1 form of the census,<ref>http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/English/4-2.xls</ref><ref>http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/English/4-3.xls</ref><ref>[http://www.perepis2002.ru/index.html?id=87 Всероссийская перепись населения 2002 года<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> though some still might exist. During the 2010 Census of Russia, the authorities rejected the claim from a group of mostly mixed race Ainu living in Kamchatka that they were not extinct.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The only Ainu speakers remaining (besides perhaps a few partial speakers) live solely in Japan. There, they are concentrated primarily on the southern and eastern coasts of the island of Hokkaidō.

Due to intermarriage with the Japanese and ongoing absorption into the predominant culture, there are no truly Ainu settlements existing in Japan today. The town of [[Nibutani]] ([[Ainu language|Ainu]]: ''Niputay'') in Hidaka area (Hokkaido prefecture) has a number of Ainu households and a visit to some of the Ainu owned craft shops close to the Ainu museums (there are two of them in Nibutani) is an opportunity to interact with the Ainu people. Many "authentic Ainu villages" advertised in Hokkaido such as [[Akan, Hokkaidō|Akan]] and [[Shiraoi, Hokkaidō|Shiraoi]] are tourist attractions and provide an opportunity to see and meet Ainu people.

==Language==
{{Main|Ainu languages}}
Today, it is estimated that fewer than 100 speakers of the language remain,<ref>Hohmann, S. 2008, "The Ainu's modern struggle" in ''World Watch'', Vol 21., No. 6, pp. 20–24.</ref> while other research places the number at fewer than 15 speakers. The language has been classified as “endangered”.<ref>[[Alexander Vovin|Vovin, A.]] 1993, ''A Reconstruction of Proto-Ainu'', Brill, p. 3</ref>  As a result of this the study of the Ainu language is limited and is based largely on historical research.

Although there have been attempts to show that the Ainu language and the Japanese language are related, modern scholars have rejected that the relationship goes beyond contact, such as the mutual borrowing of words between Japanese and Ainu. In fact, no attempt to show a relationship with Ainu to any other language has gained wide acceptance, and Ainu is currently considered to be a [[language isolate]].<ref name=shibatani />

Words used as prepositions in English (such as to, from, by, in, and at) are postpositional in Ainu; they come after the word that they modify. A single sentence in Ainu can be made up of many added or [[agglutinate]]d sounds or [[morphemes]] that represent nouns or ideas.

The Ainu language has had no system of writing, and has historically been transliterated by the Japanese [[kana]] or [[Russian alphabet|Russian Cyrillic]].  Today, it is typically written in either [[katakana]] or [[Latin alphabet]]. The unwieldy nature of the Japanese kana with its inability to accurately represent [[syllable coda|coda]] consonants has contributed to the degradation of the original Ainu. For example, some words, such as ''Kor'' (meaning "to hold"), are now pronounced with a terminal vowel sound, as in ''Koro''.

Many of the Ainu dialects, even from one end of Hokkaido to the other, were not mutually intelligible; however, the classic Ainu language of the [[Yukar]], or Ainu epic stories, was understood by all. Without a writing system, the Ainu were masters of narration, with the Yukar and other forms of narration such as the [[Uepeker tales|Uepeker]] (Uwepeker) tales, being committed to memory and related at gatherings, often lasting many hours or even days.<ref>Omniglot, 2009, "Ainu", retrieved August 2, 2009, http://www.omniglot.com/writing/ainu.htm</ref>

[[File:Woman playing traditional Ainu instrument.jpg|thumb|Woman playing a tonkori]]
[[File:Ainu ceremonial dress.jpg|thumb|Ainu ceremonial dress. [[British Museum]].]]
Traditional Ainu culture was quite different from [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]]. Never shaving after a certain age, the men had full [[beard]]s and [[moustache]]s. Men and women alike cut their hair level with the shoulders at the sides of the head, trimmed semicircularly behind. The women [[tattoo]]ed their mouths, and sometimes the [[forearm]]s. The mouth tattoos were started at a young age with a small spot on the upper lip, gradually increasing with size. The soot deposited on a pot hung over a fire of birch bark was used for color. Their traditional [[Clothing|dress]] was a robe spun from the inner bark of the [[elm]] tree, called attusi or attush. Various styles were made, and consisted generally of a simple short robe with straight sleeves, which was folded around the body, and tied with a band about the waist. The sleeves ended at the wrist or forearm and the length generally was to the calves. Women also wore an undergarment of Japanese cloth.

Modern craftswomen weave and embroider traditional garments that command very high prices. In winter the skins of animals were worn, with leggings of deerskin and in Sakhalin, boots were made from the skin of dogs or [[salmon]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Both sexes are fond of earrings, which are said to have been made of grapevine in former times, as also are bead necklaces called [[tamasay]], which the women prized highly.

Their traditional cuisine consists of the flesh of [[bear meat|bear]], fox, [[wolf]], [[badger]], [[ox]], or [[horse meat|horse]], as well as fish, [[fowl]], [[millet]], vegetables, herbs, and [[root]]s. They never ate raw fish or flesh; it was always boiled or roasted.

Their traditional habitations were reed-thatched huts, the largest {{convert|20|ft|0|abbr=on}} square, without partitions and having a fireplace in the center. There was no chimney, only a hole at the angle of the roof; there was one window on the eastern side and there were two doors. The house of the village head was used as a public meeting place when one was needed.

Instead of using furniture, they sat on the floor, which was covered with two layers of mats, one of rush, the other of a water plant with long sword shaped leaves ([[iris pseudacorus]], whose English names include "water-flag"); and for beds they spread planks, hanging mats around them on poles, and employing skins for coverlets. The men used [[chopstick]]s when eating; the women had wooden [[spoon]]s. [[Ainu cuisine]] is not commonly eaten outside Ainu communities; there are only a few Ainu-run restaurants in Japan, all located in Tokyo or Hokkaidō, serving primarily Japanese fare.

The functions of judgeship were not entrusted to chiefs; an indefinite number of a community's members sat in judgment upon its criminals. Capital punishment did not exist, nor did the community resort to imprisonment. [[Corporal punishment|Beating]] was considered a sufficient and final penalty. However, in the case of murder, the nose and ears of the culprit were cut off or the [[Hamstringing|tendons of his feet severed]].

==Hunting==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Local Customs of the Ainu.jpg|thumb|Bear hunting, 19th century]]
The Ainu hunted from late autumn to early summer. The reasons for this were, among others, that in late autumn, [[plant gathering]], salmon fishing and other activities of securing food came to an end, and hunters readily found game in fields and mountains in which plants had withered. A village possessed a hunting ground of its own or several villages used a joint hunting territory (iwor). Heavy penalties were imposed on any outsiders trespassing on such hunting grounds or joint hunting territory. The Ainu hunted bear, Ezo deer (a subspecies of [[sika deer]]), rabbit, fox, [[raccoon dog]], and other animals. Ezo deer were a particularly important food resource for the Ainu as were [[salmon]]. They also hunted [[sea eagles]] such as [[white-tailed sea eagles]], raven and other birds. The Ainu hunted eagles to obtain their tail feathers, which they used in trade with the Japanese. The Ainu hunted with [[arrow]]s and [[spear]]s with poison-coated points. They obtained the [[poison]], called ''[[surku]]'', from the roots and stalks of [[aconitum|aconites]]. The recipe for this poison was a household secret that differed from family to family. They enhanced the poison with mixtures of roots and stalks of dog's bane, boiled juice of Mekuragumo, Matsumomushi, tobacco, and other ingredients. They also used stingray stingers or skin covering stingers. They hunted in groups with dogs. Before the Ainu went hunting, for animals like bear in particular, they prayed to the [[Kamuy Fuchi|god of fire]] and the house guardian god to convey their wishes for a large catch, and safe hunting to the god of mountains.

The Ainu usually hunted bear during the time of the spring thaw. At that time bears were weak because they had not fed at all during long hibernation. Ainu hunters caught hibernating bears or bears that had just left hibernation dens. When they hunted bear in summer, they used a spring trap loaded with an arrow, called an ''amappo''. The Ainu usually used arrows to hunt deer. Also they often used traps, including spring traps loaded with arrows. Also, they drove deer into a river or sea and shot them with arrows. For a large catch, a whole village would drive a herd of deer off a cliff and club them to death.

[[File:Iomante2.JPG|thumb|Ainu traditional ceremony, circa 1930]]
The Ainu are traditionally [[animists]], believing that everything in nature has a ''[[kamuy]]'' (spirit or god) on the inside. The most important include [[Kamuy Fuchi]], goddess of the hearth, [[Kim-un Kamuy]], god of bears and mountains, and [[Repun Kamuy]], god of the sea, fishing, and marine animals.

The Ainu have no priests by profession; instead the village chief performs whatever religious ceremonies are necessary. Ceremonies are confined to making [[libation]]s of [[sake]], uttering [[prayers]], and offering [[willow]] sticks with wooden shavings attached to them. These sticks are called ''[[inaw]]'' (singular) and ''nusa'' (plural).

They are placed on an altar used to "send back" the spirits of killed animals. Ainu ceremonies for sending back bears are called ''[[Iomante]]''. The Ainu people give thanks to the gods before eating and pray to the deity of fire in time of [[Illness|sickness]]. They believe their spirits are [[Immortality|immortal]], and that their spirits will be rewarded hereafter by ascending to ''kamui mosir'' (Land of the Gods).

The Ainu believe the bear is very special because they think the bear is Kim-un Kamuy's way of delivering the gift of bear hide and meat to the humans.

Ainu assimilated into mainstream Japanese society have adopted [[Japanese Buddhism|Buddhism]] with [[Shinto]] influences, while some northern Ainu are members of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

==Ornaments==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Men wore a [[crown (headgear)|crown]] called "sapanpe" for important ceremonies. Sapanpe was made from wood fiber with bundles of partially shaved wood. This crown had wooden figures of animal gods and other ornaments on its center. Men carried an ''emush'' (sword) secured by an "emush at" strap to their shoulders.

Women wore ''matanpushi'', embroidered headbands, and ''ninkari'', earrings. ''Ninkari'' was a metal ring with a ball. Women wore it through a hole in the ear. ''Matanpushi'' and ''ninkari'' were originally worn by men. However, women wear them now. Furthermore, aprons called ''maidari'' now are a part of women's formal clothes. However, some old documents say that men wore ''maidari''. Women sometimes wore a bracelet called ''tekunkani''.

Women wore a necklace called ''rekutunpe'', a long, narrow strip of cloth with metal plaques. They wore a necklace that reached the breast called a ''[[tamasay]]'' or ''shitoki'', usually made from glass balls. Some glass balls came from trade with the Asian continent. The Ainu also obtained glass balls secretly made by the Matsumae Clan.

[[File:PSM V33 D517 Plan of an ainu house.jpg|thumb|Plan of an Ainu house]]
[[File:Ainu traditional house”cise”3.jpg|thumb|The family would gather around the fireplace]]
A village is called a ''kotan'' in the Ainu language. Kotan were located in river basins and seashores where food was readily available, particularly in the basins of rivers through which salmon went upstream. A village consisted basically of a paternal [[clan]]. The average number of families was four to seven, rarely reaching more than ten. In the early modern times, the Ainu people were forced to labor at the fishing grounds of the Japanese. Ainu kotan were also forced to move near fishing grounds so that the Japanese could secure a labor force. When the Japanese moved to other fishing grounds, Ainu kotan were also forced to accompany them. As a result, the traditional kotan disappeared and large villages of several dozen families were formed around the fishing grounds.

Kotan houses were made of [[cogon grasses]], [[bamboo grass]], [[bark]]s, etc. The length lay east to west or parallel to a river. A house was about seven meters by five with an entrance at the west end that also served as a storeroom. The house had three windows, including the "rorun-puyar," a window located on the side facing the entrance (at the east side), through which gods entered and left and ceremonial tools were taken in and out. The Ainu have regarded this window as sacred and have been told never to look in through it. A house had a fireplace near the entrance. The husband and wife sat on the fireplace's left side (called ''shiso'') . Children and guests sat facing them on the fireplace's right side (called ''harkiso''). The house had a platform for valuables called ''iyoykir'' behind the shiso. The Ainu placed ''shintoko'' (hokai) and ''ikayop'' (quivers) there.

Outbuildings included separate lavatories for men called ''ashinru'' and for women called ''menokoru'', a ''pu'' (storehouse) for food, a "heper set" (cage for young bear), and drying-racks for fish and wild plants. An altar (''nusasan'') faced the east side of the house (''rorunpuyar''). The Ainu held such ceremonies there as ''lyomante'', a ceremony to send the spirit of a bear to the gods.

==Life of Ainu==

The Ainu people had various types of marriage. A child was promised in marriage by arrangement between his or her parents and the parents of his or her betrothed or by a go-between. When the betrothed reached a marriageable age, they were told who their spouse was to be. There were also marriages based on mutual consent of both sexes. In some areas, when a daughter reached a marriageable age, her parents let her live in a small room called ''tunpu'' annexed to the southern wall of her house. The parents chose her spouse from men who visited her.

The age of marriage was 17 to 18 years of age for men and 15 to 16 years of age for women, who were [[tattoo]]ed. At these ages, both sexes were regarded as adults.

When a man proposed to a woman, he visited her house, ate half a full bowl of rice handed to him by her, and returned the rest to her. If the woman ate the rest, she accepted his proposal. If she did not and put it beside her, she rejected his proposal. When a man became engaged to a woman or they learned that their engagement had been arranged, they exchanged gifts with each other. He sent her a small engraved knife, a workbox, a spool, and other gifts. She sent him embroidered clothes, coverings for the back of the hand, Ieggings, and other handmade clothes. According to some books, many ''yomeiri'' marriages, in which a bride went to the house of a bridegroom with her belongings to become a member of his family, were conducted in the old days.

For a ''yomeiri'' marriage, a man and his father would bring betrothal gifts to the house of a woman, including a sword, a treasured sword, an ornamental quiver, a sword guard, and a woven basket (''hokai''). If the man and woman agreed to marry, the man and his father would bring her to their house or the man would stay at her house for a while and then bring her to his house. At the wedding ceremony, participants prayed to the god of fire. Bride and bridegroom respectively ate half of the rice served in a bowl, and other participants were entertained.

The worn-out fabric of old clothing was used for baby clothes because soft cloth was good for the skin of babies and worn-out material protected babies from gods of illness and demons due to these gods' abhorrence of dirty things. Before a baby was breast-fed, he/she was given a decoction of the endodermis of [[alder]] and the roots of butterburs to discharge impurities. Children were raised almost naked until about the ages of four to five. Even when they wore clothes, they did not wear belts and left the front of their clothes open. Subsequently they wore bark clothes without patterns, such as ''attush'', until coming of age.

Newborn babies were named ''ayay'' (a baby's crying), ''shipo'', ''poyshi'' (small excrement), ''shion'' (old excrement), etc. Children were called by these "temporary" names until the ages of two to three. They were not given permanent names when they were born. Their tentative names had a portion meaning "excrement" or "old things" to ward off the demon of ill-health. Some children were named based on their behavior or habits. Other children were named after impressive events or after parents' wishes for the future of the children. When children were named, they were never given the same names as others.

Men wore [[loincloth]]s and had their hair dressed properly for the first time at age 15–16. Women were also considered adults at the age of 15–16. They wore underclothes called ''mour'' and had their hair dressed properly and wound [[waistcloth]]s called ''raunkut'', ''ponkut'', etc. around their bodies. When women reached age 12–13, the lips, hands and arms were tattooed. When they reached age 15–16, their tattoos were completed. Thus were they qualified for marriage.

==American continent connection theory==
In the late 20th century, speculation arose that people of the group related to the [[Jōmon]] may have been one of the first to settle North America. This theory is based largely on skeletal and cultural evidence among tribes living in the western part of North America and certain parts {{clarify|date=September 2011}} of South America.

It is possible that North America had several peoples among its early settlers—these relatives of the Jōmon being one of them. The best known evidence that may support this theory is probably [[Kennewick Man]].<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/04/060425183740.htm Kennewick Man Skeletal Find May Revolutionalize Continent's History], ''Science Daily'', April 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/280/5361/191 ANTHROPOLOGY: Kennewick Man's Contemporaries], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.</ref>

[[Genetic map#Linkage mapping|Genetic mapping]] studies by [[Cavalli-Sforza]] have shown a sharp gradient in gene frequencies centered in the area around the [[Sea of Japan]], and particularly in the [[Japanese Archipelago]], that distinguishes these populations from others in the rest of eastern Asia and most of the American continent. This gradient appears as the third most important genetic movement (in other words, the third principal component of genetic variation) in Eurasia (after the "great expansion" from Africa, which has a [[Cline (biology)|cline]] centered in [[Arabia]] and adjacent parts of the Middle East, and a second cline that distinguishes the northern regions of Eurasia, and particularly [[Siberia]], from southerly parts of the continent), which would make it consistent with the early Jōmon period, or possibly even the pre-Jōmon period.<ref>Cavalli-Sforza. ''The History and Geography of Human Genes'' p.253, ISBN 0-691-08750-4: "The synthetic maps suggest a previously unsuspected center of expansion from the Sea of Japan but cannot indicate dates. This development could be tied to the Jōmon period, but one cannot entirely exclude the pre-Jōmon period and that it might be responsible for a migration to the Americas. A major source of food in those pre-agricultural times came from fishing, then as now, and this would have limited for ecological reasons the area of expansion to the coastline, perhaps that of the Sea of Japan, but also father along the Pacific Coast."</ref>

==Institutions==
[[File:Ainu promotion center, Sapporo.JPG|thumb|Ainu cultural promotion center and museum, in [[Sapporo]]  (Sapporo Pirka Kotan)]]

Most Hokkaido Ainu and some other Ainu are members of an umbrella group called the [[Hokkaido Utari Association]]. It was originally controlled by the government to speed Ainu assimilation and integration into the Japanese [[nation-state]]. It now is run exclusively by Ainu and operates mostly independently of the government.

Other key institutions include ''The Foundation for Research and Promotion of Ainu Culture (FRPAC)'', set up by the Japanese government after enactment of the Ainu Culture Law in 1997, the [http://www.cais.hokudai.ac.jp/english/ Hokkaido University Center for Ainu and Indigenous Studies] established in 2007, as well as museums and cultural centers. Ainu people living in Tokyo have also developed a vibrant political and cultural community.<ref>Links to these organizations needed, also Tokyo Ainu documentary, http://www.2kamuymintara.com/film/top.htm, and http://www.2kamuymintara.com/film/groups.htm has links to Tokyo area Ainu groups.</ref>

===Litigation===
On March 27, 1997, the Sapporo District Court decided a landmark case that, for the first time in Japanese history, recognized the right of the Ainu people to enjoy their distinct culture and traditions. The case arose because of a 1978 government plan to build two dams in the [[Saru River]] watershed in southern Hokkaido. The dams were part of a series of development projects under the Second National Development Plan that were intended to industrialize the north of Japan.<ref>Mark A. Levin, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635451 Essential Commodities and Racial Justice: Using Constitutional Protection of Japan’s Indigenous Ainu People to Inform Understandings of the United States and Japan], New York University Journal of International Law and Politics, Vol. 33, pp. 445–46, 2001</ref>  The planned location for one of the dams was across the valley floor close to [[Nibutani]] village,<ref>Levin, Mark (trans.), Kayano et al. v. Hokkaido Expropriation Committee: ‘The Nibutani Dam Decision’ (1999). International Legal Materials, Vol. 38, p. 394, 1999.

Levin, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635451 Essential Commodities] p. 447</ref>  In the early 1980s when the government commenced construction on the dam, two Ainu landowners refused to agree to the expropriation of their land. These landowners were Kaizawa Tadashi and [[Shigeru Kayano|Kayano Shigeru]]—well-known and important leaders in the Ainu community.<ref>[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635451 Idem.], p. 443</ref>  After Kaizawa and Kayano declined to sell their land, the Hokkaido Development Bureau applied for and was subsequently granted a Project Authorization, which required the men to vacate their land. When their appeal of the Authorization was denied, Kayano and Kaizawa's son Koichii (Kaizawa died in 1992), filed suit against the Hokkaido Development Bureau.

The final decision denied the relief sought by the plaintiffs for pragmatic reasons—the dam was already standing—but the decision was nonetheless heralded as a landmark victory for the Ainu people. In short, nearly all of the plaintiffs' claims were recognized. Moreover, the decision marked the first time Japanese case law acknowledged the Ainu as an indigenous people and contemplated the responsibility of the Japanese nation to the indigenous people within its borders.<ref>[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635447 Nibutani Dam Decision (Levin trans.)]; see also [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635451 Idem.], p. 442</ref>  The decision included broad fact-finding that underscored the long history of the oppression of the Ainu people by Japan's majority, referred to as Wajin in the case and discussions about the case.<ref>[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635447 Nibutani Dam Decision (Levin trans.)]; see also Mark A.

===Governmental advisory boards===
Much national policy in Japan has been developed out of the action of governmental advisory boards, known as {{Nihongo4||審議会|shingikai}} in Japanese.  One such committee operated in the late 1990s,<ref name="Citation to Siddle's book">Citation to Siddle's book</ref> and its work resulted in the 1997 Ainu Culture Law.<ref name="ainushinpou" />  This panel's circumstances were criticized for including not even a single Ainu person among its members.<ref name="Citation to Siddle's book"/>

More recently, a panel was established in 2006, which notably was the first time an Ainu person was included.  It completed its work in 2008 issuing a major report that included an extensive historical record and called for substantial government policy changes towards the Ainu.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Formation of Ainu political party===
The {{Nihongo4|[[Ainu Party]]|アイヌ民族党|Ainu minzoku tō}} was founded on January 21, 2012,<ref>[http://www.ainu-org.jp/english/index.html Ainu Party]</ref> after a group of Ainu activists in Hokkaido announced the formation of a political party for the Ainu on October 30, 2011. The Ainu Association of Hokkaido reported that Kayano Shiro, the son of the former Ainu leader Kayano Shigeru, will head the party. Their aim is to contribute to the realization of a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] and [[Polyethnicity|multiethnic]] society in Japan, along with rights for the Ainu.<ref>[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111031a5.html]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.asahi.com/national/update/1029/TKY201110290538.html]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

* [[Sakhalin]] Ainu – Pure-blooded individuals may be surviving in Hokkaido. From both Northern and Southern [[Sakhalin]], a total of 841 Ainu were relocated to Hokkaido in 1875 by Japan. Only a few in remote interior areas remained, as the island was turned over to Russia. Even when Japan was granted Southern Sakhalin in 1905, only a handful returned. The Japanese census of 1905 counted only 120 Sakhalin Ainu (down from 841 in 1875, 93 in Karafuto and 27 in Hokkaido). The Soviet census of 1926 counted 5 Ainu, while several of their multiracial children were recorded as ethnic Nivkh, Slav or Uilta.
** North Sakhalin – Only 5 pure-blooded individuals were recorded during the 1926 Soviet Census in Northern Sakhalin. Most of the Sakhalin Ainu (mainly from coastal areas) were relocated to Hokkaido in 1875 by Japan.

* Northern Kuril Ainu (no known living population in Japan, existence [[Ainu people#Official recognition in Russia|not recognized]] by Russian government in Kamchatka Krai) – Also known as Kurile in Russian records. Were under Russian rule until 1875. First came under Japanese rule after the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)]]. Major population was on the island of [[Shumshu]], with a few others on islands like [[Paramushir]]. Altogether they numbered 221 in 1860. They had Russian names, spoke Russian fluently and were [[Russian Orthodox]] in religion. As the islands were gifted to the Japanese, more than a hundred Ainu fled to Kamchatka along with their Russian employers (where they were assimilated into the [[Kamchadal]] population).<ref name="wurm"/><ref>{{cite book| author = Sharon Minichiello| title = Japan's Competing Modernities: Issues in Culture and Democracy, 1900-1930| url = http://books.google.com/?id=-I_pId0AuhIC&pg=PA163| year = 1998| publisher = University of Hawaii Press| isbn = 978-0-8248-2080-0| page = 163 }}</ref> Only about half remained under Japanese rule. In order to [[Russification|derussify]] the Kurile, the entire population of 97 individuals was relocated to [[Shikotan]] in 1884, given Japanese names, and the children were enrolled in Japanese schools. Unlike the other Ainu groups, the Kurile failed to adjust to their new surroundings and by 1933 only 10 individuals were alive (plus another 34 multiracial individuals). The last group of 20 individuals (including a few pure-bloods) were evacuated to Hokkaido in 1941, where they vanished as a separate ethnic group soon after.<ref name="howell2005"/>

* Southern Kuril Ainu (no known living population) – Numbered almost 2,000 people (mainly in [[Kunashir]], [[Iturup]] and [[Urup]]) during the 18th century. In 1884, their population had decreased to 500. Around 50 individuals (mostly multiracial) who remained in 1941 were evacuated to Hokkaido by the Japanese soon after World War II.<ref name="wurm"/> The last full-blooded Southern Kuril Ainu was Suyama Nisaku, who died in 1956.<ref name="uwspace.uwaterloo.ca">http://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/10012/2765/1/Scott%20Harrison_GSO_Thesis.pdf</ref> The last of the tribe (partial ancestry), Tanaka Kinu, died on Hokkaido in 1973.<ref name="uwspace.uwaterloo.ca"/>

* Kamchatka Ainu (no known living population) – Known as Kamchatka Kurile in Russian records. Ceased to exist as a separate ethnic group after their defeat in 1706 by the Russians.
