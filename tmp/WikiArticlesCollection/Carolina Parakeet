The '''Carolina Parakeet''' (''Conuropsis carolinensis''){{#tag:ref|''Conuropsis'', from "''Conurus''", an obsolete name of the genus ''[[Aratinga]]'' (''cf.'' [[conure]] and see also synonyms listed above), and "-opsis", "of similar appearance to". ''carolinensis'', "from Carolina".|group=Note}} was the only [[parrot]] species native to the [[eastern United States]]. It was found from southern [[New York]] and [[Wisconsin]] to [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and lived in old forests along rivers.<ref name=Griggs>{{cite book|title=American Bird Conservancy's Field Guide to All the Birds of North America|publisher=HarperPerennial|last=Griggs|first= Jack L.|location=New York|year=1997|isbn=0-06-273028-2}}</ref> It is the only species classified in the [[genus]] '''''Conuropsis'''''. It was called '''''puzzi la née''''' ("head of yellow") or '''''pot pot chee''''' by the [[Seminole]] and '''''kelinky''''' in [[Chickasaw language|Chickasaw]].<ref name="Snyder">{{cite book |author=Snyder, Noel F. & Russell, Keith |year=2002 |chapter=Carolina Parakeet (''Conuropsis carolinensis'') |editor=A.

==Biology==
The Carolina Parakeet's habitats were forests along rivers, with large hollow trees to use as roosting and nesting sites. It mostly ate the seeds of forest shrubs and other plants (such as [[thistle]]s) and also ate [[fruit]]s (often from orchards by the time of its decline).<ref name=Griggs/>

Carolina Parakeets were probably<!-- the word the source uses --> poisonous—[[John James Audubon]] noted that cats apparently died from eating them, and they are known to have eaten the toxic seeds of [[cocklebur]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Birkhead|first=Tim|year=2012|title=Bird Sense: What It's Like to Be a Bird|location=New York|publisher=Walker & Company|isbn=978-0-8027-7966-3 |page=123}}</ref>

According to a study of [[mitochondrial DNA]] recovered from museum specimens, their closest living relatives include the [[Sun Parakeet]], the [[Golden-capped Parakeet]], and the [[Nanday Parakeet]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kirchman | first1 = Jeremy J. | last2 = Schirtzinger | first2 = Erin E. | last3 = Wright | first3 = Timothy F. | year = 2012 | title = Phylogenetic Relationships of the Extinct Carolina Parakeet (''Conuropsis carolinensis'') Inferred from DNA Sequence Data | journal = The Auk | volume = 129 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–8 | url = http://biology-web.nmsu.edu/twright/publications/Kirchmanetal2012Auk_PROOFS.pdf  | accessdate = 2012-09-22 | doi = 10.1525/auk.2012.11259}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Extinct Carolina parakeet gives glimpse into evolution of American parrots | last = Bennu | first = Devorah | date = 2012-09-19 | publisher = The Guardian | url =  http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/sep/19/1?CMP=twt_gu | accessdate = 2012-09-22}}</ref>

==Extinction==
[[File:Conuropsis carolinensisAWP026AA2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''C. c. carolinensis'' by [[John James Audubon]]]] 
The last known wild specimen was killed in [[Okeechobee County, Florida]], in 1904, and the last captive bird died at the [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]] on February 21, 1918.  This was the male specimen, called "Incas", who died within a year of his mate, "Lady Jane".  Coincidentally, Incas died in the same aviary cage in which the last [[Passenger Pigeon]], "[[Martha (Passenger Pigeon)|Martha]]", had died nearly four years earlier.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.birdersworld.com/brd/default.aspx?c=a&id=432 |first=Christopher |last=Cokinos |title=The Carolina Parakeet: Glimpses of a Vanished Bird |month=June |year=2005 |journal=Birder's World}}</ref>  It was not until 1939, however, that it was determined that the Carolina Parakeet had become extinct. Some theorists at this time, though, believed a few may have been smuggled out of the country in mid 20th century and may have repopulated elsewhere, although the odds of this are extremely low.{{Citation needed|date = February 2013}}

At some date between 1937 and 1955, three parakeets resembling this species were sighted and filmed in the [[Okefenokee Swamp]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. However, the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] analyzed the film and concluded that they had probably filmed feral parakeets. Additional reports of the bird were made in Okeechobee County, Florida, until the late 1920s, but these are not supported by specimens. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The species may have appeared as a very rare [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] in places as far north as [[Southern Ontario]]. A few bones, including a [[pygostyle]] found at the [[Calvert Site]] in Southern Ontario, came from the Carolina Parakeet. The possibility remains open that this specimen was taken to Southern Ontario for ceremonial purposes.<ref>{{cite book |author=W. Earl Godfrey |year=1986 |title=The Birds of Canada |edition=revised |page=303 |publisher=[[National Museum of Natural History]] |isbn=0-660-10758-9}}</ref>

==Reasons for extinction==
[[File:Conuropsis carolinensis ludovicianus.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''C. c. ludovicianus'' by [[John James Audubon]]]] 
The Carolina Parakeet is believed to have died out because of a number of different threats. To make space for more agricultural land, large areas of forest were cut down, taking away its habitat. The bird's colorful feathers (green body, yellow head, and red around the bill) were in demand as decorations in ladies' hats. The birds were also kept as pets and could be bred easily in captivity. However, little was done by owners to increase the population of tamed birds.  Finally, they were killed in large numbers because farmers considered them a pest, although many farmers valued them for controlling invasive [[cocklebur]]s. It has also been hypothesized that the introduced [[honeybee]] helped contribute to its extinction by taking many of the bird's nesting sites.<ref name="EllisNTB">{{cite book |author=[[Richard Ellis (biologist)|Richard Ellis]] |title=No Turning Back: The Life and Death of Animal Species |publisher=[[Harper Perennial]] |year=2004 |location=New York |page=170 |isbn=0-06-055804-0}}</ref>

A factor that contributed to their extinction was the unfortunate flocking behavior that led them to return ''immediately'' to a location where some of the birds had just been killed. This led to even more being shot by hunters as they gathered about the wounded and dead members of the flock.

This combination of factors [[Local extinction|extirpated]] the species from most of its range until the early years of the 20th century. However, the last populations were not much hunted for food or feathers, nor did the farmers in rural [[Florida]] consider them a pest, as the benefit of the birds' love of cockleburs clearly outweighed the minor damage they did to the small-scale garden plots. The final extinction of the species is somewhat of a mystery, but the most likely cause seems to be that the birds succumbed to poultry disease, as suggested by the rapid disappearance of the last, small, but apparently healthy and reproducing flocks of these highly social birds. If this is true, the very fact that the Carolina Parakeet was finally tolerated to roam in the vicinity of human settlements proved its undoing.<ref name="Snyder"/> The fact remains, however, that persecution significantly reduced the bird's population over many decades.{{Citation needed|date = February 2013}}

The [[Louisiana]] subspecies of the Carolina Parakeet, ''C. c. ludovicianus'',{{#tag:ref|''ludovicianus'', "from Louisiana"|group=Note}} was slightly different in color than the parent species, being more bluish-green and generally of a somewhat subdued coloration, and went extinct in much the same way, but at a somewhat earlier date (early 1910s). The [[Appalachian Mountains]] separated these birds from the eastern ''C. c. carolinensis''.{{Citation needed|date = February 2013}}

About 720 skins and 16 skeletons are housed in museums around the world.<ref>{{cite book |author=Dieter Luther |year=1996 |title=Die ausgestorbenen Vögel der Welt |language=German |trans_title=The extinct birds of the world |edition=4th |publisher=[[Westarp-Wissenschaften]] |location=Heidelberg |isbn=3-89432-213-6}}</ref> In 1977, ecologist Daniel McKinley accepted 20 of the 49 supposed egg specimens as certainly and 7 as probably correctly assigned to this species.<ref name="McKinley">{{cite journal |author=Daniel McKinley |year=1977 |title=Eggs of the Carolina Parakeet: a preliminary review |journal=[[Bird-Banding]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=25–37 |url=http://sora.unm.edu/node/50594 |doi=10.2307/4512289}}</ref> Five eggs collected in Florida on April 30, 1927, were controversially attributed to this species ([[T. T. Wentworth, Jr. Florida State Museum|FSM]]<!-- check whether the same as Florida Museum of Natural History --> 87234 – 3 eggs – and 89434 – 2 eggs). These are not accepted as valid by McKinley based on their small size and early date of collection, but molecular analysis could possibly determine whether these are in fact eggs of Carolina Parakeets.<ref name="McKinley"/>

A fossil parrot, ''Conuropsis fratercula'',{{#tag:ref|''fratercula'', from [[Latin language|Latin]] for "little brother". This was a smaller bird, three-quarters the size of the Carolina Parakeet.|group=Note}}
was described based on a single [[humerus]] from the [[Miocene]] [[Sheep Creek Formation]] (possibly late [[Hemingfordian]], c.16 [[mya (unit)|mya]], possibly later) of [[Snake Creek, Nebraska]].<ref name="Wetmore">{{cite journal |author=[[Alexander Wetmore]] |year=1926 |title=Descriptions of additional fossil birds from the Miocene of Nebraska |journal=[[American Museum Novitates]] |volume=211 |pages=1–5 |url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/3188/1/N0211.pdf }}</ref>
However, it is not altogether certain that this species is correctly assigned to ''Conuropsis'',<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Storrs L. Olson]] |year=1985 |chapter=The fossil record of birds. Section VIII. K. Psittaciformes |editor=D. S. Farner, J. R. King & Kenneth C. Parkes |series=Avian Biology |volume=8 |pages=120–121 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0-12-249408-3}}</ref> but some authors{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} consider it a [[paleosubspecies]] of the Carolina Parakeet. This is almost certainly erroneous given the long distance in time, and probably based on a misunderstanding of the original description. Therein, ''C. fratercula'' is called a "new subspecies" but ''fratercula'' is consistently applied as a species-level name throughout the publication, and the fossil is correctly referenced thus in the discussion:
<blockquote>"The present ''species'' is of peculiar interest as it represents the first known parrotlike bird to be described as a fossil from North America."(Wetmore 1926;<ref name="Wetmore"/> italics added)</blockquote>

==Parakeets in the United States==

[[File:Conuropsis carolinensis.jpg|thumb|left|Rare photo of live specimen taken in 1906]] 
The extinction of the Carolina Parakeet represents the irrevocable loss of eastern North America's only truly indigenous parrot.  However, populations of a South American parrot species, ''Myiopsitta monachus'', the [[Monk Parakeet]], or Quaker Parrot, began to breed in the same region from the 1960s onwards.  Whether introduced accidentally or intentionally, the [[Monk Parakeet]] has as of 2009 established flocks in several states, including [[New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Connecticut]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Illinois]], [[Ohio]] ([[Cincinnati]] area), [[Kentucky]] (Northern/Greater Cincinnati area), [[Florida]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Texas]].

Smaller feral colonies of several other species of parrots and parakeets have since established themselves in various locations of the USA, including downtown [[Pasadena, California]]; [[The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill|San Francisco, California]]; and Chicago's [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood. Large flocks are well noted in the [[San Diego]] region, particularly in [[El Cajon, California|El Cajon]] and the [[Ocean Beach, San Diego, California|Ocean Beach]] area. The Peach-faced [[Lovebird]], a native to Africa, has established itself in parts of the [[Phoenix metropolitan area|Phoenix, Arizona, metro area]]. The [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Thick-billed Parrot]] also used to range into [[Arizona]] before its population declined in the 20th century; attempts to reintroduce them have, until now, not met with any lasting success.
