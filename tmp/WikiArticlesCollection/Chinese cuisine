{{Cuisine of China}}

'''Chinese cuisine''' includes styles originating from the diverse regions of China, plus styles of Chinese people in other parts of the world. The [[history of Chinese cuisine]] in China stretches back for thousands of years and has changed from period to period and in each region according to climate, imperial fashions, and local preferences. Over time, techniques and ingredients from the cuisines of other cultures were integrated into the cuisine of the Chinese peoples due both to imperial expansion and from the trade with nearby regions in pre-modern times as well as from Europe and the New World in the modern period.

Styles and tastes also varied by class, region, and ethnic background. This led to an unparalleled range of ingredients, techniques, dishes and eating styles in what could be called Chinese food, leading Chinese to pride themselves on eating a wide variety of foods while remaining true to the spirit and traditions of Chinese food culture.

The Eight Culinary Traditions of China{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} are [[Anhui cuisine|Anhui]], [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]], [[Fujian cuisine|Fujian]], [[Hunan cuisine|Hunan]], [[Jiangsu cuisine|Jiangsu]], [[Shandong cuisine|Shandong]], [[Szechuan cuisine|Szechuan]], and [[Zhejiang cuisine|Zhejiang]] cuisines.<ref name="beautyfujian">[http://beautyfujian.com/Fujian/Fujian_Cuisine.html "Fujian Cuisine.] [http://beautyfujian.com Beautyfujian.com].

Prominent styles of Chinese cuisine outside China include [[Singaporean cuisine#Common main dishes and snacks|Singaporean]], [[Malaysian cuisine#Malaysian Chinese food|Malaysian]], [[Chinese Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]], [[Indian Chinese cuisine|Indian]] and [[American Chinese cuisine|American]], but there is Chinese cuisine wherever Chinese people are found.<ref>David Y.

[[File:Tang dynasty pottery dumplings.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Pottery dumpling and delicacies from a Tang Dynasty tomb. Unearthed at Turpan, Xinjiang, 1972.]]
Chinese society greatly valued gastronomy and developed an extensive study of the subject based on its [[traditional Chinese medicine|traditional medical beliefs]]. The first act of many emperors was to appoint a head chef to his court, and competition between cooks could be fierce.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Chinese culture initially centered around the [[Central Plain (China)|North China Plain]]. The first domesticated crops seem to have been the [[foxtail millet|foxtail]] and [[broomcorn millet|broomcorn]] varieties of [[millet]], while [[rice]] was cultivated by the [[Baiyue|Yue people]] further south. By 2000 BC, [[wheat]] had arrived from western Asia. However, these grains were typically served as warm [[noodle]] soups instead of baked into bread as in Europe. Nobles hunted various wild game and consumed [[mutton]], [[pork]], and [[beef]] as these animals were domesticated. Grain was stored against famine and flood and meat was preserved with [[salt]], [[vinegar]], curing, and fermenting. The flavor of the meat was enhanced by cooking it in the fat of a different animal.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

By the time of [[Confucius]] in the [[Warring States Period|late Zhou]], gastronomy was becoming a high art. He was recorded discussing one such picky eater: "For him, the rice could never be white enough. When it was not cooked right, he would not eat. When it was out of season, he would not eat. When the meat was not cut properly, he would not eat. When the food was not prepared with the right sauce, he would not eat."{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Following the establishment of [[Shi Huangdi]]'s [[Qin dynasty|Chinese empire]], [[Han people|Han culture]] was expanded south into the lands of the rice-cultivating [[Yue people|Yue]]. By the time of the [[Han Dynasty]], the different climes and cuisines of China's peoples were linked by major [[canal]]s and begun developing greater complexity. The philosophy behind it was rooted in the ''[[I Ching]]'' and [[Chinese traditional medicine]]: food was judged for color, aroma, taste, and texture and a good meal was expected to balance the [[Chinese_herbology#Four_Natures|Four Natures]] ('[[yang|hot]]', warm, cool, and '[[yin|cold]]') and the [[Chinese_herbology#Five_Flavors|Five Tastes]] (pungent, sweet, sour, bitter, and salty). The predominance of [[chopsticks]] and [[spoon]]s as eating utensils also necessitated that most food be prepared in bite-sized pieces or (as with fish) be so tender that it could be easily picked apart. This need for variety and small portions subsequently developed into the varieties of [[dim sum]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

By the Later Han period (2nd century), writers{{who|date=August 2013}} frequently complained of lazy aristocrats who did nothing but sit around all day eating smoked meats and roasts.

The great migration of Chinese people south during the invasions preceding and during the [[Song dynasty]] increased the relative importance of [[northern and southern China|southern Chinese]] staples such as rice and [[congee]]. The [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties introduced [[Mongolian cuisine|Mongolian]] and [[Manchu cuisine|Manchurian]] cuisine, warm northern dishes which popularized [[hot pot]] cooking. They also introduced greater [[Muslim Chinese|Muslim communities]] into China, who practiced a porkless cuisine now preserved by [[Xinjiang cuisine|Uyghur street vendors and restaurants]] throughout the country.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

As part of the last leg of the [[Columbian Exchange]], Spanish and Portuguese traders began introducing American foods to China through the port cities of [[Guangdong|Canton]] and [[Macao]]. Mexican [[chili pepper]]s became essential ingredients in [[Sichuan cuisine]] and calorically-dense [[potato]]es and [[corn]] became staple foods across the northern plains.

During the Qing Dynasty, Chinese gastronomes such as [[Yuan Mei]] focused upon a primary goal of extracting the maximum flavor of each ingredient. However as noted in his culinary work the ''[[Suiyuan shidan]]'', the fashions of cuisine at the time were quite varied and in some cases were flamboyantly ostentatious. 

The [[People's Republic of China]], amid numerous false starts, has largely industrialized food production. A side effect of this process was the introduction of [[poultry farming in the United States|American poultry-rearing techniques]], which has greatly increased the relative consumption of eggs and chicken in various Chinese cuisines.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Regional cuisines==
[[File:Pho-style noodle soup.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Beef noodle soup]]]]

A number of different styles contribute to Chinese cuisine but perhaps the best known and most influential are [[Guangdong cuisine|Cantonese cuisine]], [[Shandong cuisine]], [[Jiangsu cuisine]] (specifically [[Huaiyang cuisine]]) and [[Szechuan cuisine]].<ref name="Yao"/><ref>[http://www.kas.ku.edu/archived-site/chinese_food/regional_cuisine.html "Regions of Chinese food-styles/flavors of cooking."] [http://www.kas.ku.edu/ University of Kansas], Kansas Asia Scholars.

Jiangsu cuisine favours cooking techniques such as [[braising]] and [[stew]]ing, while Sichuan cuisine employs [[baking]], just to name a few.<ref name=Yao /> Hairy [[crab]] is a highly sought after local delicacy in [[Shanghai]], as it can be found in lakes within the region. [[Peking Duck]] is another popular dish well known outside of China.<ref name=Yao />

Based on the raw materials and ingredients used, the method of preparation and [[culture|cultural]] differences, a variety of foods with different flavours and textures are prepared in different regions of the country. Many traditional regional cuisines rely on basic methods of [[Food preservation|preservation]] such as [[Drying (food)|drying]], [[Salting (food)|salting]], [[pickling]] and [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]].<ref name=Hsieh>J.

==Staple foods==

===Rice===
[[Rice]] is a major [[staple food]] for people from rice farming areas in southern China.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} [[Steamed rice]], usually white rice, is the most commonly eaten. Rice is also used to produce [[Beer in China|beers]], [[baijiu|wine]]s and vinegars.  Rice is one of the most popular foods in China and is used in many dishes. [[Glutinous rice]] ("sticky rice") is a variety of rice used in many specialty Chinese dishes.

===Noodles===
{{main|Chinese noodles}}
[[Chinese noodles]] come dry or fresh in a variety of sizes, shapes and textures and are often served in soups or fried as toppings. Some varieties, such as [[Shou Mian]] (寿面, literally noodles of longevity), are symbolic of long life and good health according to Chinese tradition.<ref name=Yao /> Noodles can be served hot or cold with different toppings, with broth, and occasionally dry (as is the case with mi-fun).  Noodles are commonly made with rice flour or wheat flour, but other flours such as soybean are also used.

===Soybeans===
[[Tofu]] is made of [[soybean]]s and is another popular product that supplies protein.<ref name=Hsieh>J. Li & Y. Hsieh. ''Traditional Chinese Food Technology and Cuisine''. Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 2004;13(2): 147–155.</ref> Other products such as [[soy milk]], [[soy paste]], [[soy oil]], and fermented [[soy sauce]] are also important in Chinese cooking.

===Wheat===
In wheat-farming areas in [[northern and southern China|Northern China]], people largely rely on [[flour]]-based food, such as [[Chinese noodle|noodles]], [[bread]]s, ''[[jiaozi]]'' (Chinese dumplings), and ''[[mantou]]'' (steamed buns).<ref name=Yao>Yao, Zhang.

In larger cities, a wide variety of [[Chinese bakery products]] is available, including baked, steamed, boiled, or deep-fried sweet or savory snacks. [[Bing (Chinese flatbread)|Bing]]s are baked wheat flour based confections, and include [[moon cake]], red bean paste pancake, and [[sun cake]]s. Chinese candies and sweets, called ''táng''<ref name="kaleidoscope"/> are usually made with cane sugar, malt sugar, honey, nuts and fruit. [[Kueh|Gao or Guo]] are rice based snacks that are typically steamed<ref name="kaleidoscope"/> and may be made from glutinous or normal rice.

[[Ice cream]] is commonly available throughout China.<ref name="kaleidoscope"/> Another cold dessert is called ''baobing'', which is [[shaved ice]] with sweet syrup.<ref name="kaleidoscope"/> Chinese jellies are known collectively in the language as ''ices''. Many jelly desserts are traditionally set with agar and are flavored with fruits, though [[gelatin]] based jellies are also common in contemporary desserts.

Chinese dessert soups typically consist of sweet and usually hot soups<ref name="kaleidoscope"/> and [[custard]]s.  Chinese desserts are frequently less sugary and milder in taste than western style desserts.  Some restaurants do not serve dessert at all.

===Chinese sausage===
There are different types of [[Chinese sausage]]s depending upon the region in which it is produced. Chinese sausage is darker and thinner than western sausages. The most common sausage is made of pork and pork fat. Flavor varies on the ingredients used, but it generally has a salty-sweet taste. Chinese sausage can be prepared in many different ways, including oven-roasted, stir-fried, and steamed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Parkinson|first=Rhonda|title=How To Cook Chinese Sausage|url=http://chinesefood.about.com/od/cookingfaqs/f/chinese-sausage.htm|accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref>

===Tofu products===
[[Stinky tofu]] is a type of fermented tofu that has a strong odor. Like [[blue cheese]] or [[durian]], it has a very distinct, potent smell, and is somewhat of an acquired taste. Its smell is as expected from the name; like spoiling tofu, and can be smelt from a block away when vendors are frying it or stewing it.  It is often paired with soy sauce or something salty and spicy.

[[Doufulu]] is another type of fermented tofu which has a red skin and salty taste.  This is more of a pickled type of tofu and is not as strongly scented as the stinky tofu.  Doufulu has the consistency of slightly soft blue cheese, and a taste similar to Japanese [[miso paste]], but less salty. Doufulu is frequently pickled together with soy beans and chili, and paired with [[Congee|rice congee]].

===Snacks===
[[Prawn cracker]]s are an often-consumed snack in Southeast China and Vietnam.

In contrast to their popularity in the US, [[fortune cookie]]s are almost completely absent from Chinese cuisine within China.

==Drinks==

===Tea===
[[File:Longjing tea 3.jpg|thumb|[[Longjing tea]], also known as Dragon Well tea, is a variety of roasted green tea from [[Hangzhou]], [[Zhejiang]] Province, China, where it is produced mostly by hand and has been renowned for its high quality, earning the [[China Famous Tea]] title.]]
{{Main|Chinese tea}}

As well as with dim sum, many Chinese drink their tea with snacks such as nuts, plums, dried fruit (in particular [[jujube]]), small sweets, melon seeds, and [[Myrica rubra|waxberry]].<ref name=Yao /> China was the earliest country to cultivate and drink tea which is enjoyed by people from all social classes.<ref name=Hong>Q.

Asiapac Books Pte Ltd. 2005.ISBN 9812293698.</ref> Tea processing began after the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han Dynasty|Han Dynasties]].<ref name=Hong />

Chinese tea is often classified into several different categories according to the species of plant from which it is sourced, the region in which it is grown, and the method of production used. Some of these types are [[green tea]], [[oolong tea]], black tea, scented tea, [[white tea]], and [[compressed tea]]. There are four major [[tea plantation]] regions: [[Jiangbei District, Ningbo|Jiangbei]], [[Jiangnan]], [[Huanan County|Huanan]] and the southwestern region.<ref name=Hong /> Well known types of green tea include [[Longjing tea|Longjing]], [[Huangshan]], [[Mao Feng]], [[Bilochun]], [[Putuofeng Cha]], and [[Liu'an Guapian]].<ref name=Chang>Zonglin Chang Xukui Li.

One of the most ubiquitous accessories in modern China, after a wallet or purse and an umbrella, is a double-walled insulated glass thermos with tea leaves in the top behind a strainer.

===Liquor===

''[[Huangjiu]]'' (<small>lit.</small> "yellow liquor") is not distilled and is a strong [[rice wine]] (10&ndash;15% ABV).<ref name=Yao /> Popular brands include [[Shaoxing Lao Jiu]], [[Shaoxing Hua Diao]], and [[Te Jia Fan]].<ref name=Yao />

===Herbal drinks===
{{Main|Chinese herb tea}}

Chinese herb tea, also known as ''medicinal herbal tea'', is a kind of tea-soup made from purely Chinese medicinal [[herb]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Milk===
Chinese in earlier dynasties evidently drank milk and ate dairy products, although not necessarily from cows, but perhaps ''[[koumiss]]'' (fermented mare's milk) or goat's milk. After the Tang dynasty there emerged a line dividing Asia into two groups, those who depend on milk products (India, Tibet, Central Asians) and those who reject those foods. Chinese depend on soy, as more efficient way of supporting density, and to differentiate themselves from border nomads.

Most Chinese until recently have avoided milk,  partly because pasturage for milk producers in a monsoon rice ecology is not economic, partly because milk products became negatively associated with horse riding, milk drinking nomadic tribes. There may even be a biological bias. A certain number of people in any ethnic group are lactose intolerant. In addition, human beings, like other mammals, after they are weaned, stop producing lactase enzymes (needed to digest milk) unless they drink milk. Lactose intolerance, then, is partly cultural, partly biological.<ref>Jack Goody, ''Cooking, Cuisine, and Class:  A Study in Comparative Sociology'' (Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press,  1982), p. 107; Chang, ed., ''Food in Chinese Culture: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives'', 7, 25, 105-06.</ref>

But this non-dairy tradition has undergone some change as a result of changing perceptions and global influences. For example, it has been suggested that, in the early 20th century Shanghai, “Western food, and in particular identifiably nourishing items like milk, became a symbol of a neo-traditional Chinese notion of family.”<ref>Mark Swislocki, ''Culinary Nostalgia: Regional Food Culture and the Urban Experience in Shanghai''  (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press,  2009), p. 25.</ref>

==Recent trends==
In [[list of Chinese dynasties|imperial China]], the consumption of meat and animal products was strikingly low by comparison with other cultures. Most meals consisted of a starch {{ndash}} rice in the [[northern and southern China|south]] and dumplings or noodles in the [[northern and southern China|north]] {{ndash}} and green vegetables, with peanuts and soy products providing additional [[protein]]. Fats and sugars were luxuries not available to most of the population on a regular basis.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The initial attempts of the [[People's Republic of China]] to modernize Mainland China's productive but labor-intensive agricultural practices led to a series of debacles: the worst, the [[Great Leap Forward]], produced such widespread famines from 1958 to 1961 that the [[1963 Chinese census]] remained a state secret whose very existence was not even acknowledged until the 1980s. Practices and technology were slowly modernized, however, and from the introduction of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reform]] by [[Deng Xiaoping]] in the late '70s, Chinese diets have steadily become richer over time and include more meats, fats, and sugar than before.<ref>Hsu Y.N., Vera & al. "Modern China: North", in ''Food in China'', pp. 302 & 311&ndash;313. Yale Univ. Press (New Haven), 1978.</ref> According to the [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], China's ''per capita'' food consumption has increased from less than 1700 kcal in 1960 to 2570 kcal per day in 1995.<ref>UN FAO.

==Chinese cuisine in other parts of the world==
Where there are historical immigrant Chinese populations, the style of food has evolved and been adapted to local tastes and ingredients, and modified by the local cuisine, to greater or lesser extents. This has resulted in a number of forms of [[fusion cuisine]], often very popular in the country in question, and some of these, such as [[ramen]] (Japanese Chinese) have become popular internationally. These include:
