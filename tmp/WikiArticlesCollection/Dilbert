'''''Dilbert''''' is an American [[comic strip]] written and drawn by [[Scott Adams]]. First published on April 16, 1989,<ref name="dilbert.com"/> ''Dilbert'' is known for its [[satire|satirical]] [[office humor]] about a [[White-collar worker|white-collar]], [[micromanagement|micromanage]]d office featuring the engineer [[Dilbert (character)|Dilbert]] as the [[title role|title character]]. The strip has spawned several books, an [[Dilbert (TV series)|animated television series]], a [[Dilbert's Desktop Games|video game]], and hundreds of Dilbert-themed [[merchandising|merchandise]] items. ''Dilbert Future'' and ''The Joy of Work'' are among the most read books in the series. Adams has received the [[National Cartoonist Society]] [[Reuben Award]] in 1997 and the Newspaper Comic Strip Award in the same year for his work on the strip. ''Dilbert'' appears online and in 2000 newspapers worldwide in 65 countries and 25 languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedfeatures.com/?title=Bio:Dilbert%20Dailies |title=Dilbert presentation at Kings Features Syndicate |publisher=Unitedfeatures.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}</ref>

==Themes==
The comic strip originally revolved around [[Dilbert (character)|Dilbert]] and his "pet" dog [[Dogbert]] in their home. Many plots revolved around Dilbert's engineer nature or his bizarre inventions. Also prominent were plots based on Dogbert's [[megalomania]]cal ambitions. Later, the location of most of the action moved to Dilbert's workplace, and the strip started to satirize technology, workplace, and company issues. The comic strip's popular success is attributable to its workplace setting and themes, which are familiar to a large and appreciative audience; Adams has said that switching the setting from Dilbert's home to his office was "when the strip really started to take off."<ref>{{Cite news|author=Adams, Scott|title=The Loser Decision|publisher=The Dilbert blog|date=2007-07-23|url=http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/the-loser-decis.html}}</ref>  The workplace location is [[Silicon Valley]].<ref>{{Comic book reference| Cartoonist = [[Scott Adams|Adams, Scott]]|Strip = Dilbert|Date = 2012-09-09|Syndicate = Universal UClick|url = http://www.dilbert.com/2012-09-09/}}</ref>

''Dilbert'' portrays corporate culture as a [[Franz Kafka|Kafkaesque]] world of [[bureaucracy]] for its own sake and office politics that stand in the way of productivity, where employees' skills and efforts are not rewarded, and [[busy work]] is praised. Much of the humor emerges as the audience sees the characters making obviously ridiculous decisions that are natural reactions to [[management|mismanagement]].

Themes explored include:
* Engineers' personal traits
** [[Idiosyncrasy]] of style
** Hopelessness in dating (and general lack of [[social skills]])
** Attraction to tools and technological products
* Business ethics
* [[Esotericism]]
* Incompetent and [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] management
** Scheduling and budgeting without reference to reality
** Failure to reward success or penalize laziness
** Penalizing employees for failures caused by bad management
** [[Micromanagement]]
** Failure to improve others' morale, lowering it instead
** Failure to communicate objectives
** Handling of projects doomed to failure or cancellation
** Sadistic [[human resources|HR]] policies with [[evil]] rationale
* [[Corporation|Corporate]] bureaucracy
* [[ISO standard|ISO]] audits
* [[Budget]]ing, [[accountant|accounting]], [[payroll]] and [[financial advisor]]s
* [[Stupidity]] of the general public
** Susceptibility to advertising
** Susceptibility to [[peer pressure]]
** Susceptibility to flattery
** Gullibility in the face of obvious [[scam]]s
* [[Least developed country|Fourth World]] countries and outsourcing (Elbonia)
** [[Dilapidation]]
** Bizarre cultural habits
** Lack of understanding of capitalism

===Elbonia===
The Republic of Elbonia is a [[fictional country]] to which Dilbert's company frequently [[outsourcing|outsources]] work. It is an impoverished and dysfunctional former [[communist state]] in Eastern Europe that has embraced capitalism,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1990-04-02/ |title=Dilbert.com |publisher=Dilbert.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}</ref> although North Elbonia remains totalitarian. The entire country is covered in waist-deep mud, and the inhabitants (aside from the occasional sentient pig) all have heavy beards and clothing similar to Orthodox Christian monks.

==Popular culture==
The popularity of the comic strip within the corporate sector has led to the Dilbert character being used in many business magazines and publications to including making several appearances on the cover of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune Magazine]]''. Similarly, several newspapers run the comic in their business section rather than in the regular comics section (similar to how ''[[Doonesbury]]'' is often featured in the editorial section due to its pointed commentary).

===Criticism and parody===
Media analyst [[Norman Solomon]] and cartoonist [[Tom Tomorrow]] claim<ref>{{cite web|url=http://free.freespeech.org/normansolomon/dilbert/book/  |title=The Trouble With Dilbert: The Book |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2009-09-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040218235653/http://free.freespeech.org/normansolomon/dilbert/book/ |archivedate = 2004-02-18}}</ref> that while Adams' caricatures of corporate culture seem to project empathy for white-collar workers, the satire ultimately plays into the hands of upper corporate management itself. Solomon describes the characters of ''Dilbert'', none of whom occupies a position higher than middle management, as dysfunctional time-wasters whose inefficiencies detract from corporate values like 'productivity' and 'growth', a very favorable outlook for managers. Though Dilbert and his office-mates often find themselves baffled or victimized by the whims of managerial behavior, they never seem to question it openly. Solomon cites the [[Xerox]] corporation's use of ''Dilbert'' strips and characters in internally distributed 'inspirational' pamphlets:

<blockquote>
"Xerox management had recognized what more gullible ''Dilbert'' readers did not: ''Dilbert'' is an offbeat sugary substance that helps the corporate medicine go down. The ''Dilbert'' phenomenon accepts—and perversely eggs on—many negative aspects of corporate existence as unchangeable facets of human nature...As Xerox managers grasped, ''Dilbert'' speaks to some very real work experiences while simultaneously eroding inclinations to fight for better working conditions."
</blockquote>

Adams responded in the February 2, 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1998-02-02/ |title=Dilbert comic strip for February 2, 1998 |publisher=Dilbert.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}</ref> strip and in his book ''The Joy of Work'', simply by restating Solomon's argument, apparently suggesting that it was absurd and required no rebuttal.

In 1997, [[Tom Vanderbilt]] wrote in a similar vein in ''[[The Baffler]]'' magazine:

<blockquote>
"Labor unions haven't adopted ''Dilbert'' characters as insignia. But corporations in droves have rushed to link themselves with ''Dilbert''. Why? ''Dilbert'' mirrors the mass media's crocodile tears for working people—and echoes the ambient noises from Wall Street."
</blockquote>

[[Bill Griffith]], in his daily strip ''[[Zippy the Pinhead]]'', used his strip as a forum to criticize Adams' artwork as simplistic.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Adams responded on May 18, 1998,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1998-05-18/ |title=Dilbert comic strip for May 18, 1998 |publisher=Dilbert.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}</ref> with a comic strip called ''Pippy the Ziphead'', "cramming as much artwork in as possible so no one will notice there's only one joke...[and] it's on the reader." Dilbert notes that the strip is "nothing but a clown with a small head who says random things" and Dogbert responds that he is "maintaining his artistic integrity by creating a comic that no one will enjoy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1998-05-19/ |title=Dilbert comic strip for 19 May 1998 from the official Dilbert comic strips archive |publisher=Dilbert.com |accessdate=2009-09-11}}</ref> In September of the same year, Griffith mocked Adams by mimicking his ''Pippy the Ziphead'' creation with a strip showing stiff, ''Dilbert''-like creations in an office setting and one of the characters saying, "I sense a joke was delivered."<ref>

In the late 1990s, an amateur cartoonist named Karl Hörnell began submitting a comic strip parodying both ''Dilbert''<ref name="dragon">{{cite web|url=http://www.javaonthebrain.com/artwork/dragonbert.html |title=Savage Dragonbert |publisher=Javaonthebrain.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}</ref> and the [[Image Comics]] series ''The [[Savage Dragon]]'' to ''Dragon'' creator [[Erik Larsen]]. This soon became a regular feature in the ''Savage Dragon'' comic book, titled ''The Savage Dragonbert and Hitler's Brainbert'' ("Hitler's Brainbert" being both a loose parody of Dogbert as well as the ''Savage Dragon'' villain identified as [[Adolf Hitler]]'s disembodied, superpowered brain). The strip began as a specific parody of the comic book itself, set loosely within the office structure of ''Dilbert'', with Hörnell doing an emulation of Adams' cartooning style.<ref name="dragon" />

In the ''Family Guy'' episode "[[Mr. Griffin Goes to Washington]]", Peter comments that the business world is funny. The scene then cuts away to a parody of ''Dilbert'', after which Peter remarks, "Well, sometimes the business world is funny."

''Dilbert'' has occasionally been criticized for alleged "insensitivity" and off-color jokes, as documented by Adams in ''[[The Joy of Work]]''. One of the most widely-attacked strips involved the Pointy-Haired Boss being saved in an airplane crash because [[nun]]s were on board ("You were saved by prayer?" "No, padding. They don't do a lot of aerobics at the nunnery."). The comic was published the same week as the death of [[Mother Teresa]], leading to a huge backlash. His depiction of Elbonia has also drawn criticism from a variety of corners.

In ''Dilbert'', Adams recounts having been attacked for the alleged political content of his work, although in the case of one such strip (where oil drilling kills a unicorn) he excuses himself by saying "I just thought the image was funny." In particular, a series of strips in which Dogbert worked as a talk radio host drew criticism from conservatives for his supposed attack on [[Rush Limbaugh]] (which Adams denied in ''Seven Years of Highly Defective People''). Earlier strips did engage in a degree of low-key political satire (for instance, a series of strips in 1992 where Dogbert runs for President), but since the early 1990s Adams has mostly focused the strip on corporate issues.

===Language===
<!-- Do not change title without fixing redirects to #Language -->
Terms invented by Adams in relation to the strip, and sometimes used by fans in describing their own office environments, include “''Induhvidual''.” This term is based on the [[American English]] slang expression “[[wikt:duh|duh]]!” The conscious misspelling of ''individual'' as ''induhvidual'' is a pejorative term for people who are not in the DNRC ([[Dogbert's New Ruling Class]]). Its coining is explained in ''Dilbert Newsletter'' #6. The strip has also popularized the usage of the terms “cow-orker” and [[Pointy-Haired Boss|PHB]].

===Management===
In 1997, Scott Adams masqueraded as a management consultant to [[Logitech]] executives (as Ray Mebert), with the cooperation of the company’s vice-chairman. He acted in much the way he portrays management consultants in the comic strip, with an arrogant manner and bizarre suggestions, such as comparing [[Strategic planning#Mission statements and vision statements|mission statement]]s to broccoli soup. He convinced the executives to replace their existing mission statement for their New Ventures Group, “to provide Logitech with profitable growth and related new business areas,” with “to scout profitable growth opportunities in relationships, both internally and externally, in emerging, mission-inclusive markets, and explore new paradigms and then filter and communicate and evangelize the findings.”<ref>[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19971116&slug=2572663 ''Dilbert Creator Fools Execs With Soap Story'', [[Associated Press]], from the webpage of the [[Seattle Times]], November 16, 1997.]</ref><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20000914093255/http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/humor/scott-adams-mgmt-consultant ''Dilbert Creator Fools Executives'', AP story, in full, preserved on [[MIT]] humor bulletin board, November 15, 1997.

To demonstrate what can be achieved with the most mundane objects if planned correctly and imaginatively, Adams has worked with companies to develop “dream” products for Dilbert and company. In 2001, he collaborated with design company [[IDEO]] to come up with the “perfect cubicle”, a fitting creation since many of the ''Dilbert'' strips make fun of the standard [[cubicle desk]] and the environment it creates. The result was both whimsical and practical.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Porter Anderson|title=Fred Dust: Designing for Dilbert|publisher=CNN Career|date=2001-08-28|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/CAREER/jobenvy/08/28/dilbert.fred.dust.focus/index.html|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|author=Porter Anderson|title=Scott Adams: Dilbert’s Ultimate Cubicle|publisher=CNN Career|date=2001-08-28|url=http://www.cnn.com/2001/CAREER/jobenvy/08/28/dilbert.scott.adams/index.html|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>

This project was followed in 2004 with designs for [http://web.archive.org/web/20041001095014/www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/duh/index.html Dilbert’s Ultimate House] (abbreviated as DUH). An energy-efficient building was the result, designed to prevent many of the little problems that seem to creep into a normal building. For instance, to save time spent buying and decorating a [[Christmas tree]] every year, the house has a large (yet unapparent) closet adjacent to the living room where the tree can be stored from year to year.

==Awards==
In addition to the National Cartoonists Society Reuben Awards won by Adams, the ''Dilbert'' strip has received a variety of other awards. Adams was named best international comic strip artist of 1995 in the [[Adamson Awards]] given by the Swedish Academy of Comic Art.

''Dilbert'' was named the best syndicated strip of 1997 in the [[Harvey Awards]] and won the [[Max & Moritz Prize]] as best international comic strip for 1998. In the [[Squiddy Awards]], ''Dilbert'' was named the best daily strip of 1996 and 1997, and the best comic strip of 1998 and 2000. The strip also won the Zombie Award as the best comics strip of 1996 and 1997, and the 1997 Good Taste Award as the best strip of 1996.

===Animated series===
{{Main|Dilbert (TV series)}}

''Dilbert'' was adapted into a [[UPN]] animated television series, which ran for two seasons from January 25, 1999, to July 25, 2000. The first season centered on the creation of a new product called the "Gruntmaster 6000," including the idea process and testing by one Bob Bastard. The second season had no connecting story arc; plots varied from Wally finding disciples ("[[The Shroud of Wally (Dilbert episode)|The Shroud of Wally]]") to Dilbert being accused of mass murder ("[[The Trial (Dilbert episode)|The Trial]]"). The second season two-episode finale included Dilbert getting pregnant with the child of a cow, a [[hillbilly]], [[Robot]] DNA, "several dozen engineers", an elderly billionaire, and an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]], eventually ending up in a custody battle with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] as the Judge. Featured voice actors included [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as [[Dilbert (character)|Dilbert]], [[Chris Elliott]] as [[Dogbert]], and [[Kathy Griffin]] as Alice.

===New animation===
On April 7, 2008, dilbert.com presented its first Dilbert animation. The new Dilbert animations are animated versions of original comic strips produced by [[RingTales]] and animated by [[Powerhouse Animation Studios, Inc.|Powerhouse Animation Studios]]. The animation videos run for around 30 seconds each and are added every weekday. On December 10, 2009 the RingTales produced animations were made available as a calendar application for mobile devices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dilbert Animated Calendar|url=http://www.metranome.net/calendars.php|date=2009-12-10|accessdate=2009-12-16}}</ref>

=="Drunken lemurs" case==
In October 2007, the Catfish Bend Casino in [[Burlington, Iowa]], notified its staff that the casino was closing and they were going to be [[layoff|laid off]]. An employee of seven years, David Steward then posted on an office bulletin board the October 26, 2007, ''Dilbert'' strip<ref>{{Cite news|author=Scott Adams|title=Dilbert|url=http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2007-10-26/|date=2007-10-26|accessdate=2008-04-24}}</ref> that compared management decisions to those of "drunken lemurs." The casino called this "very offensive"; they identified him from a surveillance tape, fired him, and tried to prevent him from receiving [[unemployment insurance]] benefits. However, in December 2007 an administrative law judge ruled that he would receive benefits, as his action was not intentional misbehavior. Scott Adams said it might be the first confirmed case of an employee being fired for posting a ''Dilbert'' cartoon.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Clark Kauffman|title=Bosses fire worker who put up 'Dilbert' comic|url=http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071219/NEWS/712190360/-1/politics|work=Des Moines Register|date=2007-12-19|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> On February 20, 2008, the first of a series of ''Dilbert'' strips showed Wally being caught posting a comic strip which "compares managers to drunken lemurs."<ref>{{Cite news|author=Scott Adams|title=Dilbert|url=http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2008-02-20/|date=2008-02-20|accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> Adams later said that fans should stick to posting ''[[Garfield]]'' strips, as no one gets fired for that.

==Dilbert.com's interactive cartoons==
