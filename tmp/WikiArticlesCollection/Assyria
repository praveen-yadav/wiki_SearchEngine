'''Assyria'''  was a major kingdom or empire of the [[Ancient Near East]], existing in various forms during a period of more than 15 centuries, between [[Middle Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]]. Centered on the Upper [[Tigris river]], in [[northern Mesopotamia]], the Assyrians came to rule powerful empires at several times. As substantial part of the greater Mesopotamian "[[cradle of civilization]]", Assyria was at the height of cultural achievements for its time.

Assyria is named for its original capital, the ancient city of [[Aššur]] (located in what is now the [[Saladin Province]] of [[Iraq]]),  originally one of a number of [[Akkadian]] city states in Mesopotamia. In the late 24th century BC, Assyrian kings were regional leaders only, and subject to [[Sargon of Akkad]], who united all the [[Akkadian]] [[Semites]] and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]-speaking peoples of Mesopotamia under the [[Akkadian Empire]], which lasted from c. 2334 BC to 2154 BC.

Following the fall of the [[Akkadian Empire]] c. 2154 BC,<ref>Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', 161-191.</ref> and the succeeding [[Sumer]]ian [[Third Dynasty of Ur]], there were a number of other competing Amorite states, such as Isin and Larsa, but Mesopotamia eventually coalesced into two distinct nations: Assyria in the north, and [[Babylonia]] in the south.

The history of Assyria proper is roughly divided into three periods, known as Old Assyrian, Middle Assyrian and Neo-Assyrian. These terms are in wide use in [[Assyrology]] and roughly correspond to the [[Middle Bronze Age]], [[Late Bronze Age]] and [[Early Iron Age]], respectively.

In the Old Assyrian period, Assyria  established colonies in Asia Minor and, under king [[Ilushuma]], it asserted itself over southern Mesopotamia. From the late 19th century BC, Assyria came into conflict with the newly created state of Babylonia, which eventually eclipsed the older Sumero-Akkadian states in the south. 

Assyria experienced fluctuating fortunes in the Middle Assyrian period. Assyria had a period of empire under [[Shamshi-Adad I]] and [[Ishme-Dagan]] in the 19th and 18th centuries BC. Following this, it found itself under Babylonian and [[Mitanni]]-[[Hurrian]] domination for short periods in the 18th and 15th centuries BC respectively, and another period of great power occurred with the rise of the Middle Assyrian Empire (from 1365 BC to 1056 BC), which included the reigns of great kings, such as [[Ashur-uballit I]], [[Arik-den-ili]], [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] and [[Tiglath-Pileser I]]. During this period, Assyria overthrew the [[Mitanni]] and eclipsed both the [[Hittite Empire]] and [[Egyptian Empire]] in the [[Near East]].

Beginning with the campaigns of [[Adad-nirari II]] from 911 BC,<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq">Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq{{page needed|date=October 2013}}</ref> it again became a great power over the next three centuries, overthrowing the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt]] and conquering [[Egypt]],<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq"/> [[Babylonia]], [[Elam]], [[Urartu]]/[[Armenians|Armenia]], [[Medes|Media]], [[Persia]], [[Mannaeans|Mannea]], [[Gutium]], [[Phoenicia]]/[[Canaan]], [[Aramea]] ([[Syria]]), [[Arabia]], [[Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Edom]], [[Moab]], [[Samarra]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Chaldea]], [[Nabatea]], [[Commagene]], [[Dilmun]] and the [[Hurrians]], [[Sutu]] and Neo-[[Hittites]], driving the [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] and [[Nubians]] from Egypt,<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq"/> defeating the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] and exacting tribute from [[Phrygia]], [[Majan (civilization)|Magan]] and [[Land of Punt|Punt]] among others.<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq"/> After its fall (between 612 BC and 605 BC), Assyria remained a province and [[Geo-political]] entity under the Babylonian, [[Medes|Median]], [[Achaemenid]], [[Seleucid]], [[Parthia]]n, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Sassanid]] empires until the [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] invasion and conquest of Mesopotamia in the mid-7th century, when it was finally dissolved, after which the remnants of the Assyrian people (by now Christians) gradually became a minority in their homeland.<ref name="Parpola, Simo 2004">Parpola, Simo (2004).

==Names==
Assyria was also sometimes known as [[Subartu]] prior to the rise of the [[city state]] of [[Assur|Ashur]] and, after its fall, from 605 BC through to the late 7th century AD variously as [[Athura]] and also referenced as Atouria<ref>{{cite book|last=Y Odisho|first=George|title=The sound system of modern Assyrian (Neo-Aramaic)|year=1998|publisher=Harrowitz|isbn=3-447-02744-4|page=8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ON7BEtQvejcC&lpg=PA8&dq=strabo%20atouria&pg=PA8#v=onepage&q=strabo%20atouria&f=false}}</ref> according to [[Strabo]], ''Syria'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]), ''Assyria'' ([[Latin]]) and [[Assuristan]]. The term ''Assyria'' can also refer to the geographic region or heartland where Assyria, its empires and the Assyrian people were and still are centred. The modern [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christian]] minority in northern Iraq, north east [[Syria]], south east [[Turkey]] and north west [[Iran]] are the descendants of the ancient Assyrians (see [[Assyrian continuity]]).<ref name="H.W.F. Saggs">Saggs notes that: "the destruction of the Assyrian empire did not wipe out its population. They were predominantly peasant farmers and, since Assyria contains some of the best wheat land in the Near East, their descendants would, as opportunity permitted, build new villages over the old cities and carry on with agricultural life, remembering traditions of the former cities. After seven or eight centuries and various vicissitudes, these people became Christians" (''[[The Might That Was Assyria]]'', p. 290, ).</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf |title=Parpola identity_article|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110717071922/http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf| archivedate= 17 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Pre-history of Assyria==
In prehistoric times, the region that was to become known as Assyria (and Subartu) was home to a [[Neanderthal]] culture such as has been found at the [[Shanidar Cave]]. The earliest [[Neolithic]] sites in Assyria were the [[Jarmo]] culture c. 7100 BC and [[Hassuna|Tell Hassuna]], the centre of the ''Hassuna culture'', c. 6000 BC.

During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Akkad]]ians throughout [[Mesopotamia]], which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].<ref name='Deutscher'>{{Cite book|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press US]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-953222-3|pages=20–21|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XFwUxmCdG94C}}</ref> The influence of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] (which was a [[language isolate]] and thus not related to any other language) on [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.<ref name='Deutscher'/> This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium BC as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.<ref name='Deutscher'/>
[[File:Letter Luenna Louvre AO4238.jpg|thumb|Letter sent by the high-priest Lu'enna to the king of [[Lagash]] (maybe [[Urukagina]]), informing him of his son's death in combat, c. 2400 BC, found in [[Girsu]].]]
[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] gradually replaced [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere after the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),<ref name="woods">Woods C. 2006 "Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian". In S.L. Sanders (ed) ''Margins of Writing, Origins of Culture'': 91-120 Chicago [http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/OIS2.pdf]</ref> but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.

The cities of [[Assur]] ([[Ashur]]) and [[Nineveh]], together with a number of other towns and cities, existed since at least before the middle of the 3rd millennium BC (c. 2600 BC), although they appear to have been [[Sumer]]ian ruled administrative centres at this time rather than independent states.

According to some [[Judaeo-Christian]] theological traditions, the city of [[Ashur]] (also spelled [[Assur]] or Aššur) was founded by [[Ashur (Bible)|Ashur]] the son of [[Shem]], who was deified by later generations as the city's patron god.

However, there is absolutely no historical basis whatsoever for this tradition in the far older and more detailed annals of the [[Mesopotamian]]s themselves; Assyrian tradition itself lists an early Assyrian king named [[Ushpia]] as having dedicated the first temple to the god [[Ashur]] in the city in the 21st century BC. It is highly likely that the city was named in honour of the Assyrian god of the same name.

===Classical dating===
[[George Syncellus]] in his ''Chronographia'' quotes a fragment from [[Julius Africanus]] which dates the founding of Assyria to 2284 BC.<ref>[[Cory's Ancient Fragments]], [[Isaac Preston Cory]], 1832, p. 74.</ref> The Roman historian [[Velleius Paterculus]] citing Aemilius Sura states that Assyria was founded 1995 years before [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] was defeated in 197 BC (at the [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]]) by the Romans.<ref>''Roman History'', Book 1, Chapter 6.</ref> The sum therefore 197 + 1995 = 2192 BC for the foundation of Assyria. [[Diodorus Siculus]] recorded another tradition from [[Ctesias]], that dates Assyria 1,306 years before 883 BC (the starting date of the reign of [[Ashurnasirpal II]]) and so the sum 883 + 1306 = 2189 BC.<ref>''The History of Antiquity'', Maximilian Duncker, 1877, p.&nbsp;26–30.</ref> The ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' of Eusebius provides yet another date for the founding of Assyria, with the accession of [[Ninus]], dating to 2057 BC, but the Armenian translation of the ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' puts this figure back slightly to 2116 BC. Another classical dating tradition found in the ''[[Excerpta Latina Barbari]]'' dates the foundation of Assyria, under [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]], to 2206 BC.

==Early Assyria 2600-2335 BC==
The city of Ashur, together with a number of other Assyrian cities, seem to have been established by 2600 BC, however it is likely that they were initially Sumerian dominated administrative centres. In ca. the late 26th century BC, [[Eannatum]] of [[Lagash]], then the dominant [[Sumer]] ruler in Mesopotamia, mentions "smiting [[Subartu]]" (Subartu being the Sumerian name for Assyria). Similarly, in ca. the early 25th century BC, [[Lugal-Anne-Mundu]] the king of the Sumerian state of [[Adab (city)|Adab]] lists Subartu as paying tribute to him.

Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is positively known. In the [[Assyrian King List]], the earliest king recorded was [[Tudiya]]. He was a contemporary of [[Ibrium]] of [[Ebla]], who appears to have lived in the late 25th century BC. Tudiya concluded a treaty with Ibrium for the use of a trading post in [[The Levant]] officially controlled by Ebla. Apart from this reference to trading activity, nothing further has yet been discovered about Tudiya. He was succeeded by [[Adamu]] and then a further thirteen rulers ([[Yangi]], [[Suhlamu]], [[Harharu]], [[Mandaru]], [[Imshu]], [[Harshu]], [[Didanu (Assyrian king)|Didanu]], [[Hanu (Assyrian king)|Hanu]], [[Zuabu]], [[Nuabu]], [[Abazu (Assyrian king)|Abazu]], [[Belu (Assyrian king)|Belu]] and [[Azarah]]). Nothing concrete is yet known about these kings, although there is some evidence of both trade and warfare with the [[Hurrian]] and [[Hattians|Hattian]] peoples of [[Anatolia]] and the [[Eblaites]] of the [[Levant]].

The earliest kings, such as [[Tudiya]], who are recorded as ''kings who lived in tents'' were likely to have been independent [[Akkadian]] semi nomadic pasturalist rulers.<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq"/> These kings, who dominated the region, at some point during this period became fully urbanised and founded the ''city state'' of [[Ashur]].<ref>Saggs, ''The Might'', 24.</ref>

==Akkadian Empire==

During the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2334–2154 BC) the Assyrians, like all the Akkadian Semites (and also the [[Sumerians]]), became subject to the dynasty of the city state of Akkad, centered in central Mesopotamia. The [[Akkadian Empire]] founded by [[Sargon the Great]], claimed to encompass the surrounding "four quarters". The region of Assyria, north of the seat of the empire in central Mesopotamia had also been known as [[Subartu]] by the Sumerians, and the name [[Azuhinum]] in Akkadian records also seems to refer to Assyria proper.

Assyrian rulers were subject to Sargon and his successors, and the city of [[Ashur]] became a regional administrative center of the Empire, implicated by the [[Nuzi#Archaeology|Nuzi tablets]].<ref name="Shendge1997">{{cite book|author=Malati J. Shendge|title=The language of the Harappans: from Akkadian to Sanskrit|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xb6CZMmwo00C&pg=PA46|accessdate=22 April 2011|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-325-0|page=46}}</ref>

During this period, the Akkadian-speaking Semites of Mesopotamia came to rule an empire encompassing not only Mesopotamia itself but large swathes of [[Asia Minor]], ancient [[Iran]], [[Elam]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Canaan]] and the [[Levant]] (modern [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]).

Assyria seems to have already been firmly involved in trade in [[Asia Minor]] by this time; the earliest known reference to Anatolia as "Land of the Hatti", was found on Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets from the early period of the Akkadian Empire (circa 2350 BC). On those tablets, Assyrian traders implored the help of their ruler, Sargon the Great.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} This appellation continued to exist throughout the Assyrian Empire for about 1,700 years.

However, towards the end of the reign of [[Sargon the Great]], the Assyrian faction rebelled against him; "the tribes of Assyria of the upper country—in their turn attacked, but they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled their habitations, and he smote them grievously".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The Akkadian Empire was destroyed by economic decline and internal civil war, followed by attacks from [[barbarian]] [[Gutian people]] in 2154 BC.

The rulers of Assyria during the period between 2154 BC and 2112 BC once again became fully independent, as the Gutians are only known to have administered southern Mesopotamia. However, the king list is the only information from Assyria for this period. Assyria became part of the Empire of the [[Sumer]]ian [[3rd dynasty of Ur]] founded in 2112 BC. One ruler named [[Zāriqum]] is listed as paying tribute to Ur.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Its rulers appear to have remained largely under Sumerian domination until the mid-21st century BC, although this is not certain, as the king list names Assyrian rulers for this period.

==Old Assyrian Kingdom==
The main rivals to early Assyrian kings during the 22nd, 21st and 20th centuries BC would have been the [[Hattians]] and [[Hurrians]] to the north in [[Asia Minor]], the [[Gutians]] to the east in the [[Zagros Mountains]] of north west [[Iran]], the [[Elamites]] to the south east in what is now south central [[Iran]], the [[Amorites]] to the west in what is today [[Syria]], and their fellow [[Sumero-Akkadian]] City-States of southern Mesopotamia such as [[Isin]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Ur]] and [[Larsa]].<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq"/>

Assyria had extensive contact with [[Hittite empire|Hattian]], [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Hurrian]] cities on the [[Anatolia]]n plateau in [[Asia Minor]]. The Assyrians who had long traded in the region, and possibly ruled small areas bordering Assyria, now established significant colonies in [[Cappadocia]], (''e.g.,'' at [[Kanesh]] (modern [[Kültepe]]) from 1945 BC to 1740 BC. These colonies, called ''[[karum]]'', the Akkadian word for 'port', were attached to [[Hittite empire|Hattian]] and [[Hurrian]] cities in [[Anatolia]], but physically separate, and had special tax status. They must have arisen from a long tradition of trade between Assyria and the Anatolian cities, but no archaeological or written records show this. The trade consisted of metal (perhaps lead or tin; the terminology here is not entirely clear) and textiles from Assyria, that were traded for precious metals in Anatolia.

Like many city-states in Mesopotamian history, Ashur was, to a great extent, an [[oligarchy]] rather than a monarchy. Authority was considered to lie with "the City", and the polity had three main centres of power&nbsp;— an assembly of elders, a hereditary ruler, and an [[eponym]]. The ruler presided over the assembly and carried out its decisions. He was not referred to with the usual [[Akkadians|Akkadian]] term for "king", ''šarrum''; that was instead reserved for the city's patron deity [[Assur (god)|Assur]], of whom the ruler was the high priest. The ruler himself was only designated as "the steward of Assur" (''iššiak Assur''), where the term for steward is a borrowing from [[Sumerians]] ''[[ENSI|ensi(k)]]''. The third centre of power was the eponym (''limmum''), who gave the year his name, similarly to the later [[archons of Athens|archons]] and [[Roman consul|consuls]] of [[Classical Antiquity]]. He was annually elected by [[Sortition|lot]] and was responsible for the economic administration of the city, which included the power to detain people and confiscate property. The institution of the eponym as well as the formula ''iššiak Assur'' lingered on as ceremonial vestiges of this early system throughout the history of the Assyrian monarchy.<ref>Larsen, Mogens Trolle (2000): "The old Assyrian city-state". In Hansen, Mogens Herman, ''A comparative study of thirty city-state cultures: an investigation / conducted by the Copenhagen Polis Centre'', p.&nbsp;77–89.</ref><!--Refers to entire paragraph on political structure-->

The first written inscriptions by 'urbanised' Assyrian kings appear in the mid-21st century BC, after they had shrugged off Sumerian domination. The land of Assyria as a whole then consisted of a number of city states and small [[Semitic]] [[Akkadian]] kingdoms, some of which were initially independent of Assyria. The foundation of the first true urbanised Assyrian monarchy was traditionally ascribed to king [[Ushpia]], a contemporary of [[Ishbi-Erra]] of [[Isin]] and [[Naplanum]] of [[Larsa]].<ref>According to the [[Assyrian King List]] and Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 187.</ref> c. 2030 BC. Assyria began to expand into [[Anatolia]] ([[Asia Minor]]) at this time, founding trading colonies in the south east of the region. He was succeeded by kings named [[Apiashal]], [[Sulili]], [[Kikkiya]] and [[Akiya]] (died 1976 BC) of whom little known apart from a record of [[Kikkiya]] conducting fortifications on the city walls, and building work on temples in Ashur.

===Dynasty of Puzur-Ashur I - 1975-1813 BC===
In approximately 1975 BC, [[Puzur-Ashur I]] (a contemporary of [[Shu-ilishu]] of [[Larsa]] and [[Samium]] of [[Isin]]) overthrew Kikkiya and founded a new dynasty which was to survive for over 160 years. He left inscriptions regarding the building of temples to gods such as  [[Ashur]], [[Adad]] and [[Ishtar]] in Assyria. The length of his reign is unknown.

[[Shalim-ahum]] (died 1946 BC) succeeded the throne at a currently unknown date. He left inscriptions in archaic ''Old Assyrian' regarding the construction of a temple dedicated to the god [[Ashur]], and the placement of [[Beer vats]] within it.

[[Ilushuma]] (1945–1906 BC) took the throne in 1945 BC, and appears to have been a powerful king, and the dominant ruler in the region. He made many raids into [[Mesopotamian Marshes|Southern Mesopotamia]] between 1945 BC and 1906 BC, invading the independent [[Sumero-Akkadian]] city states of the region, such as [[Isin]] and [[Larsa]], many of which were now under severe pressure from migrating [[Amorites]] and the [[Elamites]] to the east.

The [[Amorites]], were a [[Semitic]] people hailing from the north eastern [[Levant]], who came to dominate the Levant (modern [[Syria]]) and [[Canaan]], including overrunning [[Ebla]] and [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], and continued to do the same to southern Mesopotamia from the mid-20th century BC, deposing native [[Sumero-Akkadian]] dynasties and setting up their own kingdoms, before themselves becoming ''Akkadianised''.

Ilushu-ma's invasion of southern Mesopotamia appears to have been as much about freeing his fellow Akkadians from being over run by the Elamites and Amorites as asserting Assyrian domination over all of Mesopotamia. He describes his exploits in aiding his fellow Akkadian states by defeating the invading Amorites and Elamites in the south of Mesopotamia as follows; "The freedom<ref group=nb>Freedom = addurāru.</ref> of the [[Akkadians]] and their children I established. I purified their copper. I established their freedom from the border of the marshes and [[Ur]] and [[Nippur]], [[Awal]], and [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Der (Sumer)|Der]] of the goddess [[Ishtar]], as far as the City of ([[Ashur]])."<ref name=grayson>{{ cite book | title = Assyrian Royal Inscriptions, Volume 1 | author = A. K. Grayson | publisher = Otto Harrassowitz | year = 1972 | pages = 7–8 }}</ref>

Ilushuma also expanded northwards, founding colonies at the expense of the [[Hattians]] and [[Hurrians]] in [[Asia Minor]], and to the north west into the [[Levant]]. The conflict between Assyria and its fellow Akkadian speaking states of the south was to become a pattern throughout the history of ancient Mesopotamia, with the future rivalry between Assyria and [[Babylonia]].

[[Erishum I]] (1905–1877 BC) vigorously expanded Assyrian colonies in [[Asia Minor]] during his long reign, the major ones appearing to be at [[Kanesh]] ([[Kültepe]]), [[Ḫattuša]] ([[Boğazköy]]) and [[Amkuwa]] ([[Alisar Höyük]]), together with a further eighteen smaller colonies. He created some of the earliest examples of [[Written Law]], conducted extensive building work in the form of fortifying the walls of major Assyrian cities and the erection of temples dedicated to [[Ashur]] and [[Ishtar]]. It was during his reign that the [[limmum]] lists were introduced in Assyria. At some point he appears to have withdrawn Assyrian aid to southern Mesopotamia. It was during his reign in Assyria that the initially minor [[City State]] of [[Babylon]] was founded in 1894 BC by an [[Amorite]] ''Malka'' (prince) named [[Sumuabum]].

[[Ikunum]] (1877-1870 BC) built a major temple for the god [[Ninkigal]]. He further strengthened the fortifications of the city of Assur and maintained Assyria's colonies in Asia Minor.

[[Sargon I]] (1869-1830 BC) succeeded him in 1869 BC, and had an unusually long reign of 39 years. It is likely he was named after his illustrious fellow Mesopotamian predecessor [[Sargon of Akkad]]. He is known to have refortified the defences of major Assyrian cities, and maintained Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor during his reign. Apart from this, little has yet been unearthed about him.

[[Puzur-Ashur II]] (1829-1822 BC) came to the throne as an already older man due to his fathers long reign. Little is known about his rule, but it appears to have been uneventful.

[[Naram-Sin of Assyria|Naram-Suen]] (1821 - 1819 BC)  ascended to the throne in 1821 BC, and is possibly named after his predecessor [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]] of the [[Akkadian Empire]]. Assyria continued to be wealthy during his reign, and he defeated the future usurper king [[Shamshi-Adad I]] who attempted to take his throne.

[[Erishum II]] (1819 - 1813 BC) was to be the last king of the dynasty of Puzur-Ashur I, founded circa 1975 BC. After only five or six years in power he was overthrown by [[Shamshi-Adad I]], an [[Amorite]] usurper who claimed legitimacy by asserting descent from the 21st Century BC Assyrian king, [[Ushpia]].

===Assyrian Empire of Shamshi-Adad I, 1813 BC - 1751 BC===
The Amorites were successfully repelled by the Assyrian kings of the 20th and 19th centuries BC.
However, in 1813 BC the native Akkadian king of Assyria [[Erishum II]] (1819–1813 BC) was deposed, and the throne of Assyria was usurped by [[Shamshi-Adad I]] (1813 BC&nbsp;– 1791 BC) in the expansion of [[Semitic]] [[Amorite]] tribes from the [[Khabur River]] delta.

Although regarded as an Amorite by later Assyrian tradition, Shamshi-Adad is also credited with descent from the native Akkadian speaking ruler [[Ushpia]] in the [[Assyrian King List]]. He put his son [[Ishme-Dagan]] on the throne of a nearby Assyrian city, [[Ekallatum]], and maintained Assyria's [[Anatolia]]n colonies. Shamshi-Adad I then went on to conquer the kingdom of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] (in modern [[Syria]]) on the [[Euphrates]] putting another of his sons, [[Yasmah-Adad]] on the throne there. Shamshi-Adad's Assyria now encompassed the whole of northern Mesopotamia and included territory in central Mesopotamia, [[Asia Minor]] and northern [[Syria]]. He himself resided in a new capital city founded in the Khabur valley in northern Mesopotamia, called [[Shubat-Enlil]].

[[Ishme-Dagan]](1790 - 1751 BC) inherited Assyria, but Yasmah-Adad was overthrown by a new king called [[Zimrilim]] in Mari. The new king of Mari allied himself with the [[Amorite]] king [[Hammurabi]] of [[Babylon]], who had made the recently created, and originally minor state of [[Babylon]] into a major power.

Assyria now faced the rising power of Babylon in the south. Ishme-Dagan responded by making an alliance with the enemies of Babylon, and the power struggle continued without resolution for decades. Ishme-Dagan, like his father was a great warrior, and in addition to repelling Babylonian attacks, campaigned successfully against the [[Turukku]] and [[Lullubi]] of the [[Zagros Mountains]] (in modern [[Iran]]) who had attacked the Assyrian city of [[Ekallatum]], and against [[Dadusha]], king of [[Eshnunna]], and the state of [[Iamhad]] (modern [[Aleppo]]).

===Assyria under Babylonian domination, 1750 - 1732 BC===
Hammurabi, after first conquering [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], [[Larsa]], and [[Eshnunna]], quickly prevailed over [[Mut-Ashkur]], (1751 - 1740 BC)  who was Ishme-Dagan's successor, and subjected him to Babylon circa 1750 BC. With Hammurabi, the various ''karum'' colonies in Anatolia ceased trade activity&nbsp;— probably because the goods of Assyria were now being traded with the Babylonians. The Assyrian monarchy survived, however the three Amorite kings succeeding Ishme-Dagan; [[Mut-Ashkur]] (who was the son of Ishme-Dagan and married to a [[Hurrian]] queen), [[Rimush]] (1739 - 1733 BC) and [[Asinum]] (1732 BC) were vassals, dependent on the Babylonians during the reign of Hammurabi, and for a short time,  of his successor [[Samsu-iluna]].

===Assyrian Adaside dynasty 1732 - 1451 BC===
The short lived Babylonian Empire quickly began to unravel upon the death of Hammurabi, and Babylonia lost control over Assyria during the reign of Hammurabi's successor [[Samsu-iluna]] (1750 - 1712 BC). A period of civil war ensued after the deposition of the Amorite king of Assyria [[Asinum]], (a grandson of Shamshi-Adad I) in approximately 1732 BC by a powerful native Akkadian vice regent named [[Puzur-Sin]], who regarded Asinum as both a foreigner and a former lackey of Babylon. A native king named [[Ashur-dugul]] seized the throne in 1732 BC, probably with the help of Puzur-Sin. However he was unable to retain control for long, and was soon deposed by a rival claimant, [[Ashur-apla-idi]]. Internal instability ensued with four further kings ([[Nasir-Sin]], [[Sin-namir]], [[Ipqi-Ishtar]] and [[Adad-salulu]]) all reigning in quick succession over a period of approximately six years between 1732 and 1727 BC. Babylonia seems to have been too powerless to intervene or take advantage of this situation.

Finally, a king named [[Adasi]] (1726 - 1701 BC) came to the fore c. 1726 BC and managed to quell the civil unrest and stabilise the situation in Assyria. Adasi drove the [[Babylonians]] and [[Amorites]] from the Assyrian sphere of influence during his reign, and Babylonian power began to quickly wane in Mesopotamia as a whole, also losing the far south of Mesopotamia to the [[Sealand Dynasty]], although the Amorites would retain control over a much reduced and weak Babylonia itself until 1595 BC, when they were overthrown by the [[Kassites]], a people from the [[Zagros]] Mountains who spoke a [[language isolate]] and were neither Semites nor Indo-Europeans.
[[File:Dräkt, Assyrier, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|130px|Assyrian, 1400 BC]]

Adasi was succeeded by [[Bel-bani]] (1700–1691 BC) who is credited in Assyrian annals with inflicting further defeats on the Babylonians and Amorites, and further strengthening and stabilising the kingdom.

Little is currently known of many of the kings that followed such as; [[Libaya]] (1690–1674 BC), [[Sharma-Adad I]] (1673–1662 BC), [[Iptar-Sin]] (1661–1650 BC), [[Bazaya]] (1649–1622 BC) (a contemporary of [[Peshgaldaramesh]] of the [[Sealand Dynasty]]), [[Lullaya]] (1621–1618 BC) (who usurperped the throne from Bazaya),  [[Shu-Ninua]] (1615–1602 BC) and [[Sharma-Adad II]] (1601–1599 BC). However, Assyria seems to have been a relatively strong and stable nation, existing undisturbed by its neighbours such as the [[Hittite empire|Hatti]], [[Hittites]], [[Hurrians]], [[Amorites]], [[Babylonians]], [[Elamites]] or [[Mitanni]] for well over 200 years.

Assyria appears to have remained strong and secure; when Babylon was sacked by the [[Hittites]] and subsequently fell to the [[Kassites]] in 1595 BC, both powers were unable to make any inroads into Assyria, and there seems to have been no trouble between the first Kassite ruler of Babylon, [[Agum II]] and [[Erishum III]] (1598–1586 BC) of Assyria, and a mutually beneficial treaty was signed between the two rulers.

[[Shamshi-Adad II]] (1585–1580 BC), [[Ishme-Dagan II]] (1579 - 1562 BC) and [[Shamshi-Adad III]] (1562 - 1548 BC) seem also to have had peaceful tenures, although few records have thus far been discovered about their reigns. Similarly, [[Ashur-nirari I]] (1547–1522 BC) seems not to have been troubled by the newly founded [[Mitanni]] Empire in [[Asia Minor]], the [[Hittites|Hittite]] empire, or Babylon during his 25-year reign. He is known to have been an active king, improving the infrastructure, dedicating temples and conducting various building projects throughout the kingdom.

[[Puzur-Ashur III]] (1521–1498 BC) proved to be a strong and energetic ruler. He undertook much rebuilding work in [[Assur]], the city was refortified and the southern quarters incorporated into the main city defences. Temples to the moon god [[Sin]] ([[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]]) and the sun god [[Shamash]] were erected during his reign. He signed a treaty with [[Burnaburiash I|Burna-Buriash I]] the Kassite king of Babylon, defining the borders of the two nations in the late 16th century BC. He was succeeded by [[Enlil-nasir I]] (1497–1483 BC) who appears to have had a peaceful an uneventful reign, as does his successor  [[Nur-ili]] (1482–1471 BC).

The son of Nur-ili, [[Ashur-shaduni]] (1470 BC) was deposed by his uncle [[Ashur-rabi I]] (1470-1451 BC) in his first year of rule. Little is known about his nineteen-year reign, but it appears to have been largely uneventful.

===Assyria in Decline 1450-1393 BC===
The emergence of the [[Mitanni]] Empire in the 16th century BC did eventually lead to a period of sporadic [[Mitanni]]-[[Hurrian]] domination in the latter half of the 15th century. The [[Mitanni]] were an [[Indo-European]] people who conquered and formed the ruling class over the indigenous [[Hurrians]] of [[Asia Minor]]/[[Anatolia]]. The Hurrians were a Caucasoid people who spoke a [[language isolate]] and were neither Semites nor Indo-Europeans.

[[Ashur-nadin-ahhe I]] (1450-1431 BC) was courted by the [[Egyptians]], who were rivals of the Mitanni, and attempting to gain a foothold in the [[Near East]]. [[Amenhotep II]] sent him a tribute of gold to seal an alliance. It is likely that this alliance prompted [[Saushtatar]], the Mitanni emperor, to invade Assyria, and sack the city of [[Ashur]], after which Assyria became a sometime vassal state, with Ashur-nadin-ahhe I being forced to pay tribute to Saushtatar. He was deposed by his own brother [[Enlil-nasir II]] (1430-1425 BC) in 1430 BC, possibly with the aid of the Mitanni, who received tribute from the new king. [[Ashur-nirari II]] (1424-1418 BC) had an uneventful reign, and appears to have also paid tribute to the Mitanni Empire.<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq" />

The Assyrian monarchy survived, and the Mitanni influence appears to have been sporadic. They appear not to have been always willing or able to interfere in Assyrian internal and international affairs.

[[Ashur-bel-nisheshu]] (1417–1409 BC) seems to have been largely independent of Mitanni influence, as evidenced by his signing a mutually beneficial treaty with [[Karaindash]], the [[Kassite]] king of [[Babylonia]] in the late 15th century. He also undertook extensive rebuilding work in Ashur itself, and Assyria appears to have redeveloped a sophisticated financial system during his reign.

[[Ashur-rim-nisheshu]] (1408–1401 BC) also undertook building work, strengthening the city walls of the capital, however it is likely that he paid tribute to Mitanni.

[[Ashur-nadin-ahhe II]] (1400–1393 BC) also received a tribute of gold and diplomatic overtures from [[Egypt]], possibly in an attempt to gain Assyrian support against Egypt's Mitanni and [[Hittites|Hittite]] rivals in the region. However the Assyrian king appears not to have been in a strong enough position to challenge the Mitanni.

[[Eriba-Adad I]] (1392-1366 BC), a son of Ashur-bel-nisheshu, ascended the throne in 1392 BC and finally broke the ties to the Mitanni Empire.

There are dozens of Mesopotamian [[cuneiform]] texts from this period, with precise observations of solar and lunar eclipses, that have been used as 'anchors' in the various attempts to define the [[chronology of Babylonia and Assyria]] for the early 2nd millennium BC (i.e., the "high", "middle", and "low" chronologies.)

Scholars variously date the beginning of the "Middle Assyrian period" to either the fall of the Old Assyrian kingdom of [[Shamshi-Adad I]], or to the ascension of [[Ashur-uballit I]] to the throne of Assyria.

===Assyrian expansion and empire 1392–1056 BC===
{{See also|Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire}}
By the reign of [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1392 BC - 1366 BC) Mitanni influence over Assyria was on the wane. Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between [[Tushratta]] and his brother [[Artatama II]] and after this his son [[Shuttarna II]], who called himself king of the [[Hurri]] while seeking support from the Assyrians. A pro-Assyria faction appeared at the royal Mitanni court. Eriba-Adad I had thus finally broken Mitanni influence over Assyria, and in turn had now made Assyria an influence over Mitanni affairs.

[[Ashur-uballit I]] (1365 BC&nbsp;– 1330 BC) succeeded the throne of Assyria in 1365 BC, and proved to be a fierce, ambitious and powerful ruler. Assyrian pressure from the south-east and [[Hittites|Hittite]] pressure from the north-west, enabled Ashur-uballit I to break Mitanni power. He met and decisively defeated Shuttarna II the Mitanni king in battle, making Assyria once more an imperial power at the expense of not only the [[Mitanni]] themselves, but also [[Kassite]] [[Babylonia]], the [[Hurrians]] and the [[Hittites]]; and a time came when the Kassite king in Babylon was glad to marry [[Muballiṭat-Šērūa]], the daughter of Ashur-uballit, whose letters to [[Akhenaten]] of [[Egypt]] form part of the [[Amarna letters]].

This marriage led to disastrous results for Babylonia, as the Kassite faction at court murdered the half Assyrian Babylonian king and placed a pretender on the throne. Assur-uballit I promptly invaded Babylonia to avenge his son-in-law, entering Babylon, deposing the king and installing [[Kurigalzu II]] of the royal line king there.

Ashur-uballit I then attacked and defeated [[Shattiwaza|Mattiwaza]] the [[Mitanni]] king despite attempts by the [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[Suppiluliumas]], now fearful of growing Assyrian power, to help the Mitanni. The lands of the Mitanni and Hurrians were duly appropriated by Assyria, making it a large and powerful empire.

[[Enlil-nirari]] (1329–1308 BC) succeeded Ashur-uballit I. He described himself as a "Great-King" (''Sharru rabû'') in letters to the Hittite kings. He was immediately attacked by Kurigalzu II of Babylon who had been installed by his father, but succeeded in defeating him, repelling Babylonian attempts to invade Assyria, counterattacking and appropriating Babylonian territory in the process, thus further expanding Assyria.

The successor of Enlil-nirari, [[Arik-den-ili]] (c. 1307–1296 BC), consolidated Assyrian power, and successfully campaigned in the [[Zagros]] Mountains to the east, subjugating the [[Lullubi]] and [[Gutians]]. In the [[Levant]], he defeated [[Semitic]] tribes of the so-called [[Ahlamu]] group, who were possibly predecessors of the Arameans or an Aramean tribe.

He was followed by [[Adad-nirari I]] (1295–1275 BC) who made [[Kalhu]] (Biblical [[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]) his capital, and continued expansion to the northwest, mainly at the expense of the [[Hittites]] and [[Hurrians]], conquering Hittite territories such as [[Carchemish]] and beyond. Adad-nirari I made further gains to the south, annexing Babylonian territory and forcing the [[Kassite]] rulers of [[Babylon]] into accepting a new frontier agreement in Assyria's favour.
Adad-nirari's inscriptions are more detailed than any of his predecessors. He declares that the gods of Mesopotamia called him to war, a statement used by most subsequent Assyrian kings. He referred to himself again as ''Sharru Rabi'' (meaning "The Great King" in the [[Akkadian]] language) and conducted extensive building projects in Ashur and the provinces.

In 1274 BC [[Shalmaneser I]] (1274-1244 BC) ascended the throne. He proved to be a great warrior king. During his reign he conquered the powerful Hurrian kingdom of [[Urartu]] that had encompassed most of [[Anatolia|Eastern Anatolia]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains]], and the fierce [[Gutians]] of the [[Zagros Mountains]] in modern [[Iran]]. He then attacked the [[Mitanni]]-[[Hurrians]], defeating both King [[Shattuara]] and his [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Aramaeans|Aramean]] allies, finally completely destroying the Hurri-Mitanni kingdom in the process.

During the campaign against the Hittites, Shattuara cut off the Assyrian army from their supply of food and water, but the Assyrians broke free in a desperate battle, counterattacked, and conquered and annexed what remained of the Mitanni kingdom. Shalmaneser I installed an Assyrian prince, [[Ilu-ippada]] as ruler of Mitanni, with Assyrian governors such as [[Meli-sah]], installed to rule individual cities.

The Hittites tried unsuccessfully to save Mitanni. In alliance with [[Babylon]], they fought an economic war against Assyria for many years. Assyria was now a large and powerful empire, and a major threat to [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]] interests in the region, and was perhaps the reason that these two powers, fearful of Assyrian might, made peace with one another.<ref>Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 263.</ref> Like his father, Shalmaneser was a great builder and he further expanded the city of [[Kalhu]] (the biblical [[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]) at the juncture of the [[Tigris]] and [[Great Zab|Zab]] Rivers.

Shalmaneser's son and successor, [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (1244 BC -1207 BC), won a major victory against the [[Hittites]] and their king [[Tudhaliya IV]] at the [[Battle of Nihriya]] and took thousands of prisoners. He then conquered [[Babylonia]], taking [[Kashtiliash IV]] as a captive and ruled there himself as king for seven years, taking on the old title "King of Sumer and Akkad" first used by [[Sargon of Akkad]]. Tukulti-Ninurta I thus became the first native [[Akkadian]] speaking [[Mesopotamian]] to rule the state of Babylonia, its founders having been [[Amorites]], succeeded by [[Kassites]]. Tukulti-Ninurta petitioned the god [[Shamash]] before beginning his counter offensive.<ref name=edwards>{{cite book | title = Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 2, Part 2, History of the Middle East and the Aegean Region, c. 1380–1000 BC | chapter = Assyrian Military Power, 1300–1200 B.C. | author = J.

In the process he defeated the [[Elamites]], who had themselves coveted Babylon. He also wrote an epic poem documenting his wars against Babylon and Elam. After a Babylonian revolt, he raided and plundered the temples in Babylon, regarded as an act of sacrilege. As relations with the priesthood in [[Ashur]] began deteriorating, Tukulti-Ninurta built a new capital city; [[Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta]].<ref>George Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', 263-4.</ref>

A number of historians, including [[Julian Jaynes]], identify [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] and his deeds as the historical origin for the biblical character [[Nimrod]] in the Old Testament.

However, Tukulti-Ninurta's sons rebelled and besieged the ageing king in his capital. He was murdered and then succeeded by [[Ashur-nadin-apli]] (1206-1203 BC) who left the running of his empire to Assyrian regional governors such as [[Adad-bēl-gabbe]]. Another unstable period for Assyria followed, it was riven by periods of internal strife and the new king only made token and unsuccessful attempts to recapture Babylon, whose Kassite kings had taken advantage of the upheavals in Assyria and freed themselves from Assyrian rule. However, Assyria itself was not threatened by foreign powers during the reigns of [[Ashur-nirari III]] (1202-1197 BC), [[Enlil-kudurri-usur]] (1196-1193 BC) and [[Ninurta-apal-Ekur]] (1192–1180 BC), although Ninurta-apal-Ekur usurped the throne from Enlil-kudurri-usur.

[[Ashur-Dan I]] (1179–1133 BC) stabilised the internal unrest in Assyria during his unusually long reign, quelling instability. During the twilight years of the Kassite dynasty in Babylonia, he <ref <!--group=i-->>''Synchronistic History'', ii 9–12.</ref> records that he seized northern Babylonia, including the cities of [[Zaban]], [[Irriya]] and [[Ugar-sallu]] during the reigns of [[Marduk-apla-iddina I]] and [[Zababa-shuma-iddin]], plundering them and "taking their vast booty to Assyria." However, the conquest of northern Babylonia brought Assyria into direct conflict with [[Elam]] which had taken the remainder of Babylonia. The powerful Elamites, under king [[Shutruk-Nahhunte]], fresh from sacking Babylon, entered into a protracted war with Assyria, they briefly took the Assyrian city of [[Arrapkha]], which Ashur-Dan I then retook, eventually defeating the Elamites and forcing a treaty upon them in the process.<!--<ref name=kertai/>-->

Another very brief period of internal upheaval followed the death of Ashur-Dan I when his son and successor [[Ninurta-tukulti-Ashur]] (1133 BC) was deposed in his first year of rule by his own brother [[Mutakkil-Nusku]] and forced to flee to [[Babylonia]]. [[Mutakkil-Nusku]] himself died in the same year (1133 BC).

A third brother, [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] (1133–1116 BC) took the throne. This was to lead to a renewed period of Assyrian expansion and empire. As the [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]] empire collapsed from the onslaught of the [[Indo-European]] [[Phrygians]] (called [[Mushki]] in Assyrian annals), Babylon and Assyria began to vie for [[Aramaeans|Aramean]] regions (in modern [[Syria]]), formerly under firm [[Hittites|Hittite]] control. When their forces encountered one another in this region, the Assyrian king [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] met and defeated [[Nebuchadnezzar I]] of [[Babylon]] on a number of occasions. Assyria then invaded and annexed [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]] controlled lands in [[Asia Minor]], [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] (Syria) and [[Gutians]] and [[Kassite]] regions in the [[Zagros Mountains]] to the east, marking an upsurge in imperian expansion.

[[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (1115–1077 BC), vies with [[Shamshi-Adad I]] and [[Ashur-uballit I]] among historians as being regarded as the founder of the first Assyrian empire. The son of [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]], he ascended to the throne upon his father's death, and became one of the greatest of Assyrian conquerors during his 38-year reign.<ref name="Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968">The encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 26, Edited by Hugh Chrisholm, 1911, p. 968</ref>

His first campaign in 1112 BC was against the [[Phrygians]] who had attempted to occupy certain Assyrian districts in the Upper [[Euphrates]] region of Asia Minor; after driving out the Phrygians he then overran the [[Luwian]] kingdoms of [[Commagene]], [[Cilicia]] and [[Cappadocia]] in western [[Asia Minor]], and drove the Neo-[[Hittites]] from the Assyrian province of [[Subartu]], northeast of [[Malatia]].

In a subsequent campaign, the Assyrian forces penetrated [[Urartu]], into the mountains south of [[Lake Van]] and then turned westward to receive the submission of [[Malatia]]. In his fifth year, Tiglath-Pileser again attacked [[Commagene]], [[Cilicia]] and [[Cappadocia]], and placed a record of his victories engraved on copper plates in a fortress he built to secure his [[Cilicia]]n conquests.

The [[Aramaeans]] of northern Syria were the next targets of the Assyrian king, who made his way as far as the sources of the [[Tigris]].<ref name="Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968"/> The control of the high road to the [[Mediterranean]] was secured by the possession of the Hittite town of [[Pitru]]<ref>Bryce, Trevor. The Routledge Handbook of The People and Places of Ancient Western Asia: The Near East from the Early Bronze Age to the fall of the Persians Empire, p.563</ref> at the junction between the [[Euphrates]] and [[Sajur]]; thence he proceeded to conquer the [[Canaan]]ite/[[Phoenicia]]n cities of ([[Byblos]]), [[Sidon]], and finally [[Arvad]] where he embarked onto a ship to sail the [[Mediterranean]], on which he killed a ''nahiru'' or "sea-horse" (which [[A. Leo Oppenheim]] translates as a [[narwhal]]) in the sea.<ref name="Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968"/> He was passionately fond of hunting and was also a great builder. The general view is that the restoration of the temple of the gods [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] and [[Hadad]] at the Assyrian capital of [[Assur]] ([[Ashur]]) was one of his initiatives.<ref name="Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968"/>
He also invaded and defeated [[Babylon]] twice, assuming the old title "King of [[Sumer]] and [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]]", forcing tribute from Babylon, although he did not actually depose the actual king in Babylonia, where the old ''Kassite Dynasty'' had now succumbed to an [[Elamite]] one.

He was succeeded by [[Asharid-apal-Ekur]] who reigned for just two years.

[[Ashur-bel-kala]] (1073–1056 BC) appears to have initially kept the vast empire together, campaigning successfully against [[Urartu]] to the north and the [[Arameans]] to the west. He maintained friendly relations with [[Marduk-shapik-zeri]] of Babylon, however upon the death of that king, he invaded [[Babylonia]] and deposed the new ruler [[Kadašman-Buriaš]], appointing [[Adad-apla-iddina]] as his vassal in Babylon. He built some of the earliest examples of both [[Zoological Gardens]] and [[Botanical Gardens]] in [[Ashur]], collecting all manner of animals and plants from his empire, and receiving a collection of exotic animals as tributes from [[Egypt]].

He was also a great hunter, describing his exploits "at the city of [[Araziqu]] which is before the land of [[Hattusa|Hatti]] (central [[Asia Minor]]) and at the foot of [[Mount Lebanon]]." These locations show that well into his reign Assyria still controlled a vast empire.

Late in his reign, the Middle Assyrian Empire erupted into civil war, when a rebellion was orchestrated by [[Tukulti-Mer]], a pretender to the throne of Assyria. Ashur-bel-kala eventually crushed Tukulti-Mer and his allies, however the civil war in Assyria had allowed hordes of [[Aramean]]s to take advantage of the situation, and press in on Assyrian controlled territory from the west. Ashur-bel-kala counterattacked them, and conquered as far as [[Carchemish]] and the source of the [[Khabur river]], but by the end of his reign the areas of Syria and Phoenicia-Canaan to the west of these regions as far as the [[Mediterranean]], previously under firm Assyrian control, were eventually lost to the Assyrian Empire.

===Assyria in the Ancient Dark Ages, 1055-936 BC===
The period from 1200 BC to 900 BC was a [[Greek Dark Ages|dark age]] for the entire [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], [[Caucasus]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkan]] regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people.

Assyria and its empire were not unduly affected by these tumultuous events for some 150 years, perhaps the only ancient power that was not. However, upon the death of [[Ashur-bel-kala]] in 1056 BC, Assyria went into a ''comparative'' decline for the next 100 or so years. The empire shrank significantly, and by 1020 BC Assyria appears to have controlled only areas close to Assyria itself, essential to keeping trade routes open in eastern [[Syria]], south eastern [[Asia Minor]] central Mesopotamia and north western [[Iran]].

[[Semitic]] peoples such as the [[Arameans]], [[Chaldean people|Chaldeans]] and [[Suteans]] moved into areas to the west and south of Assyria, including overrunning much of [[Babylonia]] to the south, [[Indo-European]]/[[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] peoples such as the [[Medes]] and [[Persian people|Persians]] moved into the lands to the east of Assyria, displacing the native [[Gutians]] and pressuring [[Elam]] and [[Mannea]] (which were both ancient non Indo-European civilisations of Iran), and to the north the Indo-European [[Phrygians]] overran their fellow Indo European [[Hittites]], a new [[Hurrian]] state named [[Urartu]] arose in the [[Caucasus]], and [[Cimmerians]], [[Colchians]] and [[Scythians]] around [[The Black Sea]]. [[Egypt]] was divided and in disarray, and [[Semitic]] [[Israelites]] were battling with other closely related fellow Semitic [[Canaan]]ite peoples such as the [[Moabites]], [[Edomites]], [[Ammonites]] and [[Amalekites]], and also the Indo-European [[Peleset]] ([[Philistines]]) for the control of southern [[Canaan]].
[[File:Assyrian horsemen arabs.png|thumb|Assyrian horsemen pursue defeated Arabs.]]

Despite the apparent weakness of Assyria in comparison to its former might, at heart it in fact remained a solid, well defended nation whose warriors were the best in the world. Assyria, with its stable monarchy and secure borders was in a stronger position during this time than potential rivals such as [[Egypt]], [[Babylonia]], [[Elam]], [[Phrygia]], [[Urartu]], [[Persia]] and [[Median Empire|Media]]<ref>According to George Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', p.&nbsp;282–283.</ref> Kings such as [[Ashur-bel-kala]], [[Eriba-Adad II]], [[Ashur-rabi II]], [[Ashurnasirpal I]], [[Tiglath-Pileser II]] and [[Ashur-Dan II]] successfully defended Assyria's borders and upheld stability during this tumultuous time.

Assyrian kings during this period appear to have adopted a policy of maintaining and defending a compact, secure nation and satellite colonies immediately surrounding it, and interspersed this with sporadic punitive raids and invasions of neighbouring territories when the need arose.

[[Eriba-Adad II]] ruled for only two years, and in that time continued to campaign against the Arameans before he was deposed by his elderly uncle [[Shamshi-Adad IV]] (1053–1050 BC) who appears to have had an uneventful reign. [[Ashurnasirpal I]] (1049–1031 BC) succeeded him, and during his reign he continued to campaign endlessly against the Arameans to the west. Assyria was also afflicted by famine during this period. [[Shalmaneser II]] (1030–1019 BC) appears to have lost territory in the [[Levant]] to the [[Arameans]], who also appear to have also occupied [[Nairi]] in south east [[Asia Minor]], hitherto an Assyrian colony.

[[Ashur-nirari IV]] took the throne in 1018 BC, and captured the [[Babylonia]]n city of [[Atlila]] from [[Simbar-Shipak]] and continued Assyrian campaigns against the Arameans. He was eventually deposed by his uncle [[Ashur-rabi II]] in 1013 BC.

During the reign of [[Ashur-rabi II]] (1013–972 BC) [[Aramaean]] tribes took the cities of [[Pitru]] and [[Mutkinu]] (which had been taken and colonized by [[Tiglath Pileser I]].) This event showed how far Assyria could assert itself militarily when the need arose. The Assyrian king attacked the Arameans, forced his way to the far off [[Mediterranean]] and constructed a [[stele]] in the area of [[Mount Atalur]].<ref>{{cite book|first=The Calculated Frightfulness of Ashur Nasir Pal|first=A.T.|last= Olmstead|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=38|year=)1918|pages=209–263}}</ref>

[[Ashur-resh-ishi II]] (971-968 BC) in all likelihood a fairly elderly man due to the length of his father's reign, had a largely uneventful period of rule, concerning himself with defending Assyria's borders and conducting various rebuilding projects within Assyria.

[[Tiglath-Pileser II]] (967- 936 BC) succeeded him, and reigned for 28 years. He maintained the policies of his recent predecessors, but appears to have had an uneventful reign.

==Assyrian Recovery==
[[Ashur-Dan II]] (935–912 BC) oversaw a marked economic and organisational upturn in the fortunes of Assyria, laying the platform for it to once again forge an empire. He is recorded as having made successful punitive raids outside the borders of Assyria to clear [[Aramaeans|Aramean]] and other tribal peoples from the regions surrounding Assyria in all directions. He concentrated on rebuilding Assyria within its natural borders, from [[Tur Abdin]] to the foothills beyond [[Irbid|Arbela]], he built government offices in all provinces, and created a major economic boost by providing ploughs throughout the land, which yielded record grain production.

===Society in the Middle Assyrian period===
Assyria had difficulties with keeping the trade routes open. Unlike the situation in the Old Assyrian period, the Anatolian metal trade was effectively dominated by the [[Hittites]] and the [[Hurrians]]. These people now controlled the Mediterranean ports, while the [[Kassites]] controlled the river route south to the [[Persian Gulf]].

The Middle Assyrian kingdom was well organized, and in the firm control of the king, who also functioned as the High Priest of [[Anshar|Ashur]], the state god. He had certain obligations to fulfill in the cult, and had to provide resources for the temples. The priesthood became a major power in Assyrian society. Conflicts with the priesthood are thought to have been behind the murder of king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]].

The main Assyrian cities of the middle period were [[Assur|Ashur]], [[Kalhu]] ([[Nimrud]]) and [[Nineveh]], all situated in the [[Tigris]] River valley. At the end of the Bronze Age, Nineveh was much smaller than Babylon, but still one of the world's major cities (population c. 33,000). By the end of the Neo-Assyrian period, it had grown to a population of some 120,000, and was possibly the largest city in the world at that time.<ref>see [[historical urban community sizes]]. Estimates are those of Chandler (1987).</ref> All free male citizens were obliged to serve in the army for a time, a system which was called the ''ilku''-service. A legal code was produced during the 14th-13th century which, among other things, clearly shows that the social position of women in Assyria was lower than that of neighbouring societies. Men were permitted to divorce their wives with no compensation paid to the latter. If a woman committed adultery, she could be beaten or put to death. It's not certain if these laws were seriously enforced, but they appear to be a backlash against some older documents that granted things like equal compensation to both partners in divorce. The women of the king's harem and their servants were also subject to harsh punishments, such as beatings, mutilation, and death. Assyria, in general, had much harsher laws than most of the region. Executions were not uncommon, nor were whippings followed by forced labour. Some offenses allowed the accused a trial under torture/duress. One tablet that covers property rights has brutal penalties for violators. A creditor could force debtors to work for him, but not sell them.
[[File:Assyrian troops return.png|thumb|Assyrian troops return after victory.]]
The Middle Assyrian Period is marked by the long wars fought during this period that helped build Assyria into a warrior society. The king depended on both the citizen class and priests in his capital, and the landed nobility who supplied the horses needed by Assyria's military. Documents and letters illustrate the importance of the latter to Assyrian society. Assyria needed less artificial irrigation than Babylon, and horse-breeding was extensive. Portions of elaborate texts about the care and training of them have been found. Trade was carried out in all directions. The mountain country to the north and west of Assyria was a major source of metal ore, as well as lumber. Economic factors were a common ''casus belli''.

Assyrian architecture, like that of Babylonia, was influenced by [[Sumero-Akkadian]] styles (and to some degree Mitanni), but early on developed its own distinctive style. Palaces sported colourful wall decorations, and seal-cutting (an art learned from Mittani) developed apace. Schools for scribes taught both the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of [[Akkadian]], and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian]] literary works were often copied with an Assyrian flavour. The Assyrian dialect of Akkadian was used in legal, official, religious, and practical texts such as medicine or instructions on manufacturing items. During the 13th-10th centuries, picture tales appeared as a new art form: a continuous series of images carved on square stone steles. Somewhat reminiscent of a comic book, these show events such as warfare or hunting, placed in order from the upper left to the lower right corner of the stele with captions written underneath them. These and the excellent cut seals show that Assyrian art was beginning to surpass that of Babylon. Architecture saw the introduction of a new style of [[ziggurat]], with two towers and colorful enameled tiles.

==Neo-Assyrian Empire 911-627 BC==
[[File:Map of Assyria.png|thumb|300px|Map of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and its expansions.]]
{{main|Neo-Assyrian Empire|Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire}}
The Neo-Assyrian Empire is usually considered to have begun with the accession of [[Adad-nirari II]], in [[911 BC]], lasting until the fall of Nineveh at the hands of the [[Babylonians|Babylonians, Chaldeans]], [[Medes|Medes/Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] in 612 BC.<ref>[http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=ae_chart Chart of World Kingdoms, Nations and Empires&nbsp;— All Empires]</ref>

===Expansion, 911-627 BC===
When the ancient Dark Ages (1200 - 900 BC)  finally lifted, the world had changed dramatically.  Ancient kingdoms such as Assyria, Babylonia, Elam and Egypt still endured, the Hittites did also, in the form of smaller Neo-Hittite states, and a number of new states had arisen during this tumultuous time, such as; Persia, Media, Parthia, Mannea, Israel, Urartu, Phrygia, Lydia, Chaldea, the Aramean and Phoenician states of the Levant, Doric Greece, Putria (Libya), Colchia, Tabal, Nubia/Kush, and other nations and peoples; such as Judah, Scythia, Cimmeria, Samarra, Ethiopia, the Suteans, Nabateans, Armenians and Arabs were to emerge in the following centuries.

However, it was the ancient state of Assyria which would once more rise to prominence, and Assyria was to meet and defeat these new peoples, together with old foes, over the coming three centuries.<ref>Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq</ref>

Beginning with the campaigns of [[Adad-nirari II]] (911-892 BC), Assyria once more became a great power, growing to be the greatest empire the world had yet seen. The new king firmly subjugated the areas that were previously only under nominal Assyrian vassalage, conquering and deporting troublesome [[Aramaeans|Aramean]], [[Neo-Hittite]] and [[Hurrian]] populations in the north to far-off places. Adad-nirari II then twice attacked and defeated [[Shamash-mudammiq]] of [[Babylonia]], annexing a large area of land north of the [[Diyala River]] and the towns of [[Hīt]] and [[Zanqu]] in mid Mesopotamia. Later in his reign, he made further gains against King [[Nabu-shuma-ukin I]] of [[Babylonia]].

His successor, [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] (891-884 BC) consolidated Assyria's gains and expanded into the [[Zagros Mountains]] in modern [[Iran]], subjugating the newly arrived [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Medes]] as well as pushing into central [[Asia Minor]].
[[File:Assyrian Attack on a Town.jpg|thumb|Assyrian attack on a town with archers and a wheeled battering ram, 865–860 BC]]
[[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883–859 BC) was a fierce and ruthless ruler who advanced without opposition through [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] and [[Canaan]] (modern [[Syria]]) and [[Asia Minor]] as far as the [[Mediterranean]] and conquered and exacted tribute from [[Aramea]], [[Phrygia]] and [[Phoenicia]] among others. Ashurnasirpal II also repressed revolts among the [[Medes]] and [[Persia]]ns in the Zagros Mountains, and moved his capital to the city of [[Kalhu]] ([[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]). The palaces, temples and other buildings raised by him bear witness to a considerable development of wealth, science, architecture and art. He also built a number of new heavily fortified towns, such as [[Imgur-Enlil]] ([[Balawat]]), [[Tushhan]], [[Kar-Ashurnasirpal]] and [[Nibarti-Ashur]]. Ashurnasirpal II also had a keen interest in [[Botany]] and [[Zoology]]; collecting all manner of plants, seeds and animals to be displayed in Assyria.

[[Shalmaneser III]] (858–823 BC) attacked and reduced [[Babylonia]] to vassalage, and defeated [[Aramea]], [[Israel]], [[Urartu]], [[Phoenicia]], the [[Neo-Hittite]] states and the [[Arabs]], forcing all of these to pay tribute to Assyria. Shalmanesser III fought the [[Battle of Qarqar]] against an alliance of 12 nations (including [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], [[Hamath]], [[Phoenicia]], the [[Arabs]], [[Arameans]], and neo [[Hittites]] among others). His armies penetrated to [[The Caucasus]], [[Lake Van]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]]; the Hittites of Carchemish were compelled to pay tribute, and the kingdoms of [[Hamath]] and [[Aram Damascus]] were subdued. In 831 BC, he received the submission of the [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n kingdom of [[Tabal]]. He consolidated Assyrian control over the regions conquered by his predecessors and, by the end of his 27-year reign, Assyria was master of Mesopotamia, The Levant, western Iran, Israel, Jordan and much of Asia Minor. Due to old age, in the last 6 years of his reign he passed command of his armies to the "Turtanu" (General) [[Dayyan-Assur]].

However, his successor, [[Shamshi-Adad V]] (822-811 BC), inherited an empire beset by civil war in Assyria. The first years of his reign saw a serious struggle for the succession of the aged Shalmaneser. The revolt, which had broken out by 826 BC, was led by Shamshi-Adad's brother [[Assur-danin-pal]]. The rebellious brother, according to Shamshi-Adad's own inscriptions, succeeded in bringing to his side 27 important cities, including [[Nineveh]]. The rebellion lasted until 820 BC, preventing Assyria expanding its empire further until it was quelled. Later in his reign, Shamshi-Adad V successfully campaigned against both [[Babylonia]] and [[Elam]], and forced a treaty in Assyria's favour on the Babylonian king [[Marduk-zakir-shumi I]]. In [[814 BCE]], he won the battle of [[Dur-Papsukkal]] against the Babylonian king [[Murduk-balassu-iqbi]], and went on to subjugate the [[Arameans|Aramean]], [[Sutean]] and [[Chaldea]]n tribes newly settled in parts of [[Babylonia]].

He was succeeded by [[Adad-nirari III]] (810- 782 BC), who was merely a boy. The Empire was thus ruled by his mother, the famed queen [[Semiramis]] ([[Shammuramat]]), until 806 BC. [[Semiramis]] held the empire together, and appears to have campaigned successfully in subjugating the [[Persian Empire|Persians]] and [[Medes]] during her regency, leading to the later [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] myths and legends surrounding her.<ref>Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', p.&nbsp;301–2.</ref>

In 806 BC, [[Adad-nirari III]] took the reins of power from [[Semiramis]]. He invaded the [[Levant]] and subjugated the [[Arameans]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Philistines]], [[Israelites]], [[Neo-Hittites]], [[Moabites]] and [[Edomites]]. He entered [[Damascus]] and forced tribute upon its [[Aramaeans|Aramean]] king [[Ben-Hadad III]]. He next turned eastward to [[Iran]], and subjugated the [[Persia]]ns, [[Medes]] and the pre Iranian [[Manneans]], penetrating as far north east as the [[Caspian Sea]]. He then turned south, forcing [[Babylonia]] to pay tribute. His next targets were the [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldean]] and [[Sutu]] tribes, who had settled in the far south eastern corner of Mesopotamia, whom he conquered and reduced to vassalage. Then the [[Arabs]] in the deserts of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to the south of Mesopotamia were invaded, vanquished and forced to pay tribute also.
[[File:Human headed winged bull profile.jpg|right|thumb|A [[lamassu]] from the palace of Sargon II at [[Dur-Sharrukin]].]]
Adad-nirari III died prematurely in 782 BC, which led to a temporary period of stagnation within the empire. Assyria continued its military dominance, however [[Shalmaneser IV]] (782 - 773 BC) himself seems to have wielded little personal authority, and a victory over [[Argishti I]], king of [[Urartu]] at [[Til Barsip]] is accredited to an Assyrian General ('Turtanu') named [[Shamshi-ilu]], who does not even bother to mention his king. Shamshi-ilu also scored victories over the [[Arameans]] and [[Neo-Hittites]], and again, takes personal credit at the expense of his king.

[[Ashur-dan III]] ascended the throne in 772 BC. He proved to be a largely ineffectual ruler who was beset by internal rebellions in the cities of [[Ashur]], [[Arrapkha]] and [[Guzana]]; and his personal authority was checked by powerful generals, such as Shamshi-ilu. He failed to make any further gains in Babylonia and [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] (modern [[Syria]]). His reign was also marred by [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] and an ominous [[Solar Eclipse]] and, as with his predecessor, military victories were credited to Shamshi-ilu.

[[Ashur-nirari V]] became king in 754 BC, the early part of his reign seems to have been one of permanent internal revolution, and he apprears to have barely left his palace in [[Nineveh]]. However later in his reign he led a number of successful campaigns in [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Levant]]. He was deposed by [[Tiglath-pileser III]] in 745 BC bringing a resurgence to Assyrian expansion.

[[Tiglath-Pileser III]] (745-727 BC) initiated a renewed period of Assyrian expansion; [[Urartu]], [[Persia]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Mannea]], [[Babylonia]], [[Arabia]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samaria]], [[Palestine]], [[Nabatea]], [[Chaldea]], [[Cyprus]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]] and the [[Neo-Hittites]] were subjugated, Tiglath-Pileser III was declared king in [[Babylon]] and the Assyrian empire was now stretched from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] to [[Arabia]] and from the [[Caspian Sea]] to [[Cyprus]]. Tiglath-Pileser III had reorganised the Assyrian army into the first professional fighting force in history, and greatly improved the civil administration of his empire, setting the template for all future ancient empires<ref>George Roux - Ancient Iraq</ref>
Tiglath-Pileser III introduced [[Mesopotamian]] [[Eastern Aramaic]] as the ''Lingua Franca'' of Assyria and its vast empire, whose descendant dialects survive to this day.<ref>George Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 308.</ref>

[[Shalmaneser V]] (726-723 BC) consolidated Assyrian power during his short reign, and repressed [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] attempts to gain a foothold in the near east, defeating and driving out Pharaoh [[Piye]] from the region. He is mentioned in Biblical sources as having conquered the [[Samaritans]], and being responsible for deporting the [[Ten Lost Tribes of Israel]] to Assyria.

[[Sargon II]] (722-705 BC) maintained the empire, driving the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] from [[Iran]], where they had invaded and attacked the [[Persia]]ns and [[Medes]], who were vassals of Assyria. [[Mannea]], [[Cilicia]] [[Cappadocia]] and [[Commagene]] were conquered, [[Urartu]] was ravaged, and [[Babylon]], [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Israel]], [[Arabia]], [[Cyprus]], and the famed [[Midas]], (king of [[Phrygia]]) were forced to pay tribute. His ''stele'' has been found as far west as [[Larnaca]] in [[Cyprus]]. Sargon II conquered [[Gurgum]], [[Milid]], the [[Georgian people|Georgian]] state of [[Tabal]], and all of the [[Hittites|Hittite]] kingdoms of the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Egypt]] once again attempted to gain ground in the region by supporting Israel's rebellion against the empire but Sargon II crushed the uprising, and [[Piye]] was once more routed and driven back over the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. Sargon II was killed in 705 BC while on a punitive raid against the [[Cimmerians]], and was succeeded by [[Sennacherib]].
[[File:Loewenjagd -645-635 Niniveh.JPG|thumb|Relief showing a [[Lion hunting|lion hunt]], from the north palace of [[Nineveh]], 645-635 BC]]

[[Sennacherib]] (705-681 BC), a ruthless ruler, defeated the [[Greeks]] who were attempting to gain a foothold in [[Cilicia]], and then defeated and drove the [[Nubia]]n ruled [[Egyptians]] from the [[Near East]] where the Nubian Pharaoh [[Taharqa]] had fomented revolt against Assyria. [[Babylon]] revolted, and Sennacherib laid waste to the city, defeating its [[Elamite]] and [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldean]] allies in the process. He sacked [[Israel]], subjugated the [[Samaritans]] and laid siege to [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], forcing tribute upon it. He installed his own son [[Ashur-nadin-shumi]] as king in Babylonia. He maintained Assyrian domination over the Medes, Manneans and Persians to the east, Asia Minor and the southern Caucasus to the north and north west, and the Levant, Phonecia and Aram in the west. Sennacherib's palace and garden at Nineveh have been proposed as the archetype of the Hanging Garden of Babylon.<ref>Stephanie Dalley (2013)''The Mystery of the Hanging Garden of Babylon: an elusive world Wonder traced''OUP ISBN 978-0-19-966226-5</ref> Sennacherib was murdered by his own sons (according to the Bible the sons were named [[Adrammelech]], [[Abimelech]] and [[Sharezer]]) in a palace revolt, apparently in revenge for the destruction of Babylon, a city sacred to all Mesopotamians, including the Assyrians.

[[Esarhaddon]] (680-669 BC) expanded Assyria still further, campaigning deep into the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in the north, breaking [[Urartu]] completely in the process. Tiring of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian interference in the Assyrian Empire, Esarhaddon decided to conquer Egypt. He crossed the [[Sinai Desert]], and invaded and took [[Egypt]] with surprising ease and speed, driving its foreign [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] and [[Ethiopia]]n rulers out and destroying the [[Kushite Empire]] in the process. He expanded the empire as far south as [[Arabia]] and [[Dilmun]] (modern [[Bahrain]] or [[Qatar]]).

Esarhaddon also completely rebuilt [[Babylon]] during his reign, bringing peace to Mesopotamia as a whole. The [[Babylonians]], [[Egyptians]], [[Elamites]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Medes]], [[Manneans]], [[Arameans]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Israelites]], [[Phoenicia]]ns and [[Urartu|Urartians]] were vanquished and regarded as vassals and Assyria's empire was kept secure. He imposed a so-called ''Vassal Treaty'' upon his [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Median]] subjects, forcing them to submit in advance to his chosen successor, Ashurbanipal.<ref>Grayson, Kirk A. (Autumn, 1987). "Akkadian Treaties of Seventh Century BC". Journal of Cuneiform Studies 39 (2): p.130.: “… Esarhaddon imposes oaths to respect the right to succession of his two sons upon various peoples: the Medes in the Vassal Treaties and probably the people of Sippar in Text 3</ref>  Esarhaddon died whilst preparing to leave for Egypt to once more eject the [[Nubians]], who were attempting to encroach on the southern part of the country. This task was successfully completed by his successor, [[Ashurbanipal]].

Under [[Ashurbanipal]] (669-627 BC), Assyrian domination spanned from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in the north to [[Nubia]], [[Egypt]] and [[Arabia]] in the south, and from [[Cyprus]] and [[Antioch]] in the west to [[Persia]] in the east.

He was an unusually educated man for his time, being able to read and write in Akkadian, Aramaic and Sumerian, and having a proficient understanding of Astronomy and Mathematics, as well as military, civil and political aptitude. He built the famed [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] which contained a multitude of ancient texts from all over Mesopotamia, and was the first library in history to classify works in order of genre.
[[File:Susa-destruction.jpg|thumb|Ashurbanipal's brutal campaign against [[Susa]] in 647 BCE is recorded in this relief.]]
Ashurbanipal finally destroyed [[Elam]] once and for all, and smashed a rebellion led by his own brother [[Shamash-shum-ukin]], who was the Assyrian king of [[Babylon]], exacting savage revenge on the coalition of [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldeans]], [[Nabateans]], [[Arameans]], [[Sutu]], [[Arabs]] and [[Elamites]] who had supported him. An Assyrian governor named [[Kandalanu]] was installed to rule Babylonia on Ashurbanipal's behalf.

Ashurbanipal easily crushed the [[Nubia]]n/[[Kingdom of Kush|Cushite]] king [[Tantamani]], who had attempted to invade Assyrian-controlled Egypt. [[Tantamani]] was chased back into [[Nubia]] by a pursuing Assyrian army, and was never again to pose a threat. [[Egypt]], [[Persia]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Phrygia]], [[Elam]], [[Urartu]], [[Lydia]], [[Babylonia]], [[Chaldea]], [[Scythia]] and [[Cimmerians|Cimmeria]] were regarded as vassals of Ashurbanipal.

He built vast libraries and initiated a surge in the building of temples and palaces. After the crushing of the Babylonian revolt, Ashurbanipal appeared master of all he surveyed. To the east, [[Elam]] was devastated and prostrate before Assyria, the [[Manneans]] and the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Persia]]ns and Medes were vassals. To the south, [[Babylonia]] was occupied, the [[Chaldean people|Chaldeans]], [[Arabs]], [[Sutu]] and [[Nabateans]] subjugated, the [[Nubia]]n empire destroyed, and [[Egypt]] paid tribute. To the north, the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] had been vanquished and driven from Assyrian territory, [[Urartu]] ([[Armenia]]), [[Phrygia]], [[Corduene]] and the neo [[Hittites]] were in vassalage, and [[Lydia]] pleading for Assyrian protection. To the west, [[Aramea]] ([[Syria]]), the [[Phoenicians]], [[Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samarra]] and [[Cyprus]] were subjugated, and the [[Hellenised]] inhabitants of [[Caria]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cappadocia]] and [[Commagene]] paid tribute to Assyria.

Assyria conquered the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty Egypt]] (expelling its [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] dynasty) as well as [[Babylonia]], [[Chaldea]], [[Elam]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Persia]], [[Urartu]], [[Armenians|Armenia]],  [[Phoenicia]], [[Aramea]]/[[Syria]], [[Phrygia]], the [[Neo-Hittites|Neo-Hittite States]], the [[Hurrian|Hurrian lands]], [[Arabia]], [[Gutium]], [[Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samarra]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]], [[Corduene]], [[Cilicia]], [[Mannea]] and parts of [[Ancient Greece]] (such as [[Cyprus]]), and defeated and/or exacted tribute from [[Scythia]], [[Crimea|Cimmeria]], [[Lydia]], [[Nubia]], [[Ethiopia]] and others.

At its height, the Empire encompassed the whole of the modern nations of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[Palestine]] and [[Cyprus]], together with large swathes of [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Turkey]], [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]].

Assyria now appeared stronger than ever. However, the long struggle with Babylonia and Elam and their allies, and the constant campaigning over three centuries to control and expand its vast empire in all directions, left Assyria exhausted. It had been drained of wealth and manpower; the devastated provinces could yield nothing to supply the needs of the imperial exchequer, it was difficult to find sufficient troops to garrison the huge empire, and after the death of Ashurbanipal severe civil unrest broke out in Assyria itself, and the empire began to unravel.

===Downfall, 626-605 BC===
The Assyrian Empire was severely crippled following the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC — the nation and its empire descending into a prolonged and brutal series of civil wars involving three rival kings, [[Ashur-etil-ilani]], [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] and [[Sin-shar-ishkun]]. [[Egypt]] quietly detached itself from Assyria, though retained friendly relations.

[[Ashur-etil-ilani]] came to the throne in 626 BC, and was immediately beset by a series of internal civil wars. He was deposed in 623 BC, after four years of bitter fighting by [[Sin-shumu-lishir]], an Assyrian ''Turtanu'' (General) who also occupied and claimed the throne of [[Babylon]] in that year. In turn, Sin-shumu-lishir was deposed as ruler of Assyria and Babylonia after a year of warfare by [[Sin-shar-ishkun]] (622 - 612 BC) — who was then himself faced with constant violent rebellion in the Assyrian homeland.

This situation led to wholesale revolution in [[Babylonia]], and during his reign many Assyrian colonies to the west, east and north similarly took advantage and ceased to pay tribute to Assyria, most significantly the [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]] and [[Arameans]].

The Scythians and Cimmerians took advantage of the bitter fighting among the Assyrians to raid Assyrian colonies, with hordes of horse borne marauders ravaging parts of [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], where the vassal king of [[Urartu]] begged his Assyrian overlord for help in vain. They also raided the [[Levant]], [[Israel]] and [[Judea|Judah]] (where [[Ashkalon]] was sacked by the Scythians) and all the way into [[Egypt]]. The [[Iranic]] peoples (the [[Medes]], [[Persia|Persians]] and [[Parthians]]), aided by the previous Assyrian destruction of the hitherto dominant [[Elamites]] of [[Ancient Iran]], also took advantage of the upheavals in Assyria to coalesce into a powerful Median dominated force which destroyed the ''pre-Iranic'' Assyrian vassal kingdom of [[Mannea]] and absorbed the remnants of the also pre-Iranic [[Gutians]] and [[Kassites]] of the [[Zagros Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea]]. In [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] (modern [[Syria]]) and [[Phoenicia]], the various Aramean and Phoenician states quietly reasserted their independence, and in western Asia Minor and eastern [[Mediterranean sea (oceanography)|Mediterranean]], the [[Lydians]], [[Greeks]], [[Cilicians]] and [[Luwian]] states did the same. [[Armenians]] and [[Colchians]] ([[Georgians]]) also began to establish themselves in parts of the Caucasus.

By 620 BC, [[Nabopolassar]], a previously unknown ''Malka'' of the [[Chaldea]]n people from the far southeast of [[Mesopotamia]], had claimed the city of Babylon and much of Babylonia in the confusion. Sin-shar-ishkun amassed a large army to eject Nabopolassar from Babylon, however, yet another revolt broke out in Assyria proper, forcing the bulk of his army to turn back, where they promptly joined the rebels in [[Nineveh]]. Similarly, Nabopolassar was unable to make any inroads into Assyria despite its weakened state, being repelled at every attempt, and the next four years saw bitter fighting in the heart of Babylonia itself, as the Assyrians tried to wrest back control.<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq" />

However, Nabopolassar entered into an alliance with the Median king [[Cyaxares the Great]], who had taken advantage of the upheavals in Assyria to free the Iranian peoples from Assyrian vassalage and unite the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns and [[Parthians]], together with the remnants of the pre-Iranian [[Elamites]] and [[Manneans]], into a powerful Median-dominated force. The Babylonians and Medes, together with the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] to the north, attacked Assyria in 616 BC, sacking the city of [[Kalhu]]. After four years of bitter fighting, [[Nineveh]] itself was finally sacked in 612 BC, after a prolonged siege followed by house to house fighting. [[Sin-shar-ishkun]] was killed defending his capital.

Despite the loss of almost all of its major cities, and in the face of overwhelming odds, Assyrian resistance continued. [[Ashur-uballit II]] (612- 605? BC) took the throne and refused a request to bow in vassalage to Nabopolassar, Cyaxares and their allies. He managed to break out of Nineveh and successfully fight his way to the northern Assyrian city of [[Harran]], he took the city and founded it as a new capital which he managed to hold for five years. However, Harran too was eventually over run in 608 BC.

[[Egypt]], itself a former Assyrian colony whose current dynasty had been installed as puppet rulers by the Assyrians, then came to Assyria's aid, possibly in fear that without Assyrian protection they would be next to succumb.<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq" />

[[Ashur-uballit II]] and [[Necho II|Necho]] of Egypt made a failed attempt to recapture Harran in 608 BC. The next three years saw the remnants of the Assyrian army and their Egyptian allies vainly attempting to eject the invaders from Assyria. In 605 BC, the Babylonians and Medes defeated the Assyrians and Egyptians at [[Carchemish]], bringing an end to Assyria as an independent political entity, although it was to launch major rebellions against the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 546 BC and 520 BC, and remained a [[geo-political]] region and colonised province until the late 7th century AD.

The fate of Ashur-uballit II remains unknown, his [[Limmu Lists]] end after the fall of Harran, and it is possible he was either killed at this time, at the battle of Carshemish in 605 BC, or simply disappeared into obscurity.

==Assyria after the empire==
{{see also|Assyrian continuity}}

===Athura, Assuristan, Assyria province===
Most of Assyria was ruled by [[Babylon]] from 605 BC until 539 BC, the northern reaches being ruled first by the [[Medes]] and then from 549 BC by their successors, the [[Persian People|Persians]]. In a twist of fate, [[Nabonidus]] the last king of Babylon was himself an Assyrian from [[Harran]]; however, apart from plans to dedicate religious temples in that city, Nabonidus showed little interest in rebuilding Assyria. [[Nineveh]] and [[Kalhu]] remained in ruins, conversely a number of towns and cities such as [[Arrapkha]], [[Guzana]] and [[Harran]] remained intact, and [[Assur]] and [[Irbid|Arbela]] were not completely destroyed, as is attested by their later revival. However, Assyria spent much of this period in a degree of devastation following its fall.

After this, it was ruled by the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]] (as [[Athura]]) from 549 BC to 330 BC (see [[Achaemenid Assyria]]). Between 546 and 545 BC, Assyria rebelled against the new Persian Dynasty, which had usurped the previous Median dynasty. The rebellion was eventually quashed by [[Cyrus the Great]].

Assyria seems to have recovered dramatically, and flourished during this period. It became a major agricultural and administrative centre of the Achaemenid Empire, and its soldiers were a mainstay of the Persian Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html |title=Assyrians after Assyria|publisher=Nineveh.com |date=4 September 1999 |accessdate=19 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110714183623/http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html| archivedate= 14 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In fact, Assyria even became powerful enough to raise another full-scale revolt against the Persian empire in 520-519 BC.

The Persians had spent centuries under Assyrian domination, and Assyrian influence can be seen in Achaemenid art, infrastructure and administration. Early Persian rulers saw themselves as successors to [[Ashurbanipal]], and [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] was retained as the ''lingua franca'' of the empire for over two hundred years.<ref>Van de Mieroop, ''History'', p. 293.</ref> [[Nineveh]] was never rebuilt however, and 200 years after it was sacked [[Xenophon]] reported only small numbers of Assyrians living amongst its ruins.

In 330 BC, Assyria fell to [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] Emperor from [[Greece]]; it thereafter became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]] and was renamed [[Syria]], a [[Hurrian]], [[Luwian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] corruption of '''Assyria'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf |title=The Terms "Assyria" and "Syria" Again|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110613170304/http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf| archivedate= 13 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It is from this period that the later [[Name of Syria|''Syria'' Vs ''Assyria'' naming controversy arises]], the Seleucids applied the name not only to Assyria itself, but also to the lands to the west ([[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] modern [[Syria]]), which had been part of the Assyrian empire. When they lost control of Assyria, the name ''Syria'' survived and was applied only to the land of [[Aramea]] to the west that had once been part of the Assyrian empire. This was to lead to both the Assyrians from Mesopotamia and Arameans from the Levant being dubbed '''Syrians''' in [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] culture.

By 150 BC, Assyria was under the control of the [[Parthian Empire]] as [[Athura]]  (the [[Parthian language|Parthian]] word for Assyria)  where the Assyrian city of [[Assur]] seems to have gained a degree of autonomy, and temples to the native gods of Assyria were resurrected. A number of independent Neo- Assyrian states arose, namely [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]] and [[Hatra]].

In 116 AD, under [[Trajan]], it was taken over by Rome as the [[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Province of Assyria]]. The Assyrians began to convert to [[Christianity]] from [[Ashurism]] during the period between the early 1st and 3rd centuries AD. [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Parthians]] fought over Assyria and the rest of Mesopotamia until 226 AD, when it was taken over by the [[Sassanid]] (Persian) Empire.

It was known as [[Asuristan]] during this period, and became a main centre of the [[Church of the East]] (now the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]), with a flourishing [[Syriac]] ([[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]) Christian culture which exists there to this day. The city of [[Ashur]] again flourished, and appears to have gained a great deal of autonomy during this period. The noted Assyriologist [[Simo Parpola]] has speculated that Assyria may even have once again been independent for a while prior to being sacked by [[Shapur I]] in 256 AD. Temples were still being dedicated to the national god [[Ashur]] in his home city and in [[Harran]] during the 4th century, indicating an Assyrian identity was still strong.

After the [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] conquest in the 7th century, Assyria was dissolved as an entity. Under Arab rule, Mesopotamia as a whole underwent a gradual process of [[Arabisation]] and [[Islamification]], and the region saw a large influx of non indigenous [[Arab people|Arabs]], [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], and later [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] peoples. However, the indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] population of northern Mesopotamia (known as [[Ashuriyun]] by the Arabs) resisted this process, retaining their language, religion, culture and identity.

Assyrian people, still retaining the [[Aramaic language]] and [[Church of the East]] [[Christianity]], remained dominant in the north as late as the 11th and 12th centuries.<ref>According to George Roux and Simo Parpola</ref> The city of [[Assur]] was still occupied by Assyrians during the Islamic period until the 14th century when [[Tamurlane]] conducted a massacre of indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christians]]. After that, there are no traces of a settlement in the archaeological and numismatic record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assur.de/Themen/Stadtgeschichte_Engl/body_stadtgeschichte_engl.html |title=History of Ashur |publisher=Assur.de |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref> The massacres by [[Tamurlane]] massively reduced the Assyrian population throughout Mesopotamia.

Although predominantly Christian, a minority of Assyrians still held onto their ancient Mesopotamian religion until as late as the 10th century AD.<ref name="nineveh.com">http://www.nineveh.com/parpola_eng.pdf</ref>

The [[Hamidian Massacre]] of the 19th Century further greatly reduced numbers. An [[Assyrian war of independence]] was fought during [[World War I]], following on from the [[Assyrian Genocide]] suffered at the hands of the [[Ottomans]] and their [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] allies. For a time, the Assyrians fought successfully against overwhelming numbers; then their [[Russia]]n allies left the war and the Armenian line broke. The [[Assyrian Levies]] were founded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1928, with ancient Assyrian military rankings, such as [[Rab-shakeh]], [[Rab-talia]] and [[Tartan]], being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline, and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs and Kurds.<ref>Len Deighton - Blood, Sweat and Tears</ref> During [[World War II]], Eleven Assyrian companies saw action in [[Palestine]] and another four served in [[Cyprus]]. The Parachute Company was attached to the Royal Marine Commando and was involved in fighting in [[Albania]], [[Italy]] and [[Greece]]. Many persecutions have befallen the Assyrians since, such as the [[Simele Massacre]], the [[Anfal]] campaign and [[Baathist]], [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] and [[Islamist]] persecutions.

===Germany and West Africa theories===
{{off topic|date=October 2013}}
Thus far, the only people who have been attested with a high level of genetic, historical, linguistic and cultural research to be the descendants of the ancient Mesopotamians are the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christians]] of [[Iraq]] and its surrounding areas in north west [[Iran]], north east [[Syria]] and south eastern [[Turkey]]. Assyria continued to exist as a geopolitical entity until the Arab-Islamic conquest in the mid-7th century, and Assyrian identity, personal names and both spoken and written evolutions of [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] (which still contain many [[Akkadian]] loan words) have survived among the Assyrian people from ancient times to this day. (see [[Assyrian people]]).

However, there have been many wild claims of ancient mid eastern ancestry (including Assyrian) throughout Europe, Africa and even the Americas, none of which have been supported by mainstream opinion or strong evidence, let alone proof.

The most long standing and popularised theory has been the attempts to link Assyrian ancestry to the ancient Germans. The idea has also some backing in German legend, for example the ''[[Gesta Treverorum]]'' (a 12th-century German medieval chronicle) makes [[Trebeta]] son of [[Ninus]] the founder of [[Trier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medievalcoinage.com/gallery/germany-trier.htm |title=Image Gallery of the Coins of the city and Archbishopric of Trier |publisher=Medievalcoinage.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref> This legend of Trebeta as having founded Trier is also found in [[Godfrey of Viterbo]]'s ''Pantheon'' (1185) and several other German chronicles of the 12th or 13th century, including the works of [[Sigebert of Gembloux]].<ref>Hammer, William, ''The Concept of the New or Second Rome in the Middle Ages'', Speculum, Vol. 19, No. 1 (January 1944)</ref> The legend is also found cited in compendiums of historical sources from later periods, for example [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s ''Scriptures rerum Brunsvicensium'' (1710) and the ''Anthologia veterum latinorum epigrammatum et poematum'' (1835).<ref>Hammer, p. 58</ref>

As with the West Africa theory, this idea does not have the backing of serious historians, nor contemporary written records of the time in the [[Near East]]. There have been no studies or records that show such a link, and it must be pointed out that [[Ninus]] and [[Trebeta]] were fictional figures, and not historically attested. In addition, there are no traces of Akkadian or Mesopotamian Aramaic in any Germanic Language.

According to a single unsupported piece of recent research, refugees from the collapsed Assyrian Empire claim to have reached the region of Lake Chad and founded the kingdoms of [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]] and [[Kebbi Emirate|Kebbi]]. These alleged refugees claimed the ancestry of [[Sargon of Akkad]] (whose dynasty died out some 15 centuries before the fall of Assyria), they also contradictionally claimed ancestry from [[Nabopolassar]], a Babylonian king of [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldean]] extraction who played a major part in the destruction of the Assyrian Empire. From the Medieval Arabic king lists of both African states, allegedly copied from earlier lists in ancient Near Eastern languages, it appears that the state founders claimed to be deportees of the Assyrian empire who had fled from [[Syria]] and [[Samaria]] after the defeat of the Egyptian-Assyrian army at [[Carchemish]] in 605 BCE.<ref>Lange, Dierk: [http://dierklange.com/pdf/Kebbi-Assyrien_Anthropos%202009_359-382.pdf "An Assyrian successor state in West Africa: The ancestral kings of Kebbi as ancient Near Eastern rulers"], ''Anthropos'', 104, 2 (2009), pp.&nbsp;359–382; id., [http://dierklange.com/pdf/reviews/dierklange_allgemein/FOUNDING_9.5.2011.pdf ''The founding of Kanem by Assyrian Refugees ca. 600 BCE: Documentary, Linguistic, and Archaeological Evidence''], Boston 2011, pp.&nbsp;31–38.</ref>

A counterpoint to this argument would be that neither [[Samaria]] nor [[Syria]] (the places from where these refugees were claimed to have originated) were actually ever part of Assyria, but were colonies inhabited largely by [[Hebrews]], [[Nabateans]] and [[Arameans]] respectively. In addition, there is no evidence whatsoever in Assyrian, [[Babylonia]]n, [[Median]], [[Persia]]n, [[Greece|Greek]] or [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] records of the time mentioning deportations of Assyrians from their homelands<ref name="Parpola, Simo 2004"/><ref>From a lecture by [[J. A. Brinkman]]: "There is no reason to believe that there would be no racial or cultural continuity in Assyria, since there is no evidence that the population of Assyria was removed." Quoted in [http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v13n1/yildiz.pdf Efram Yildiz's "The Assyrians" Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, 13.1, pp. 22, ref 24]</ref>

Additionally, the claimants to this ancestry also claim descendancy from Sargon of Akkad (whose dynasty died out over 1,500 years before the Assyrian dynasty fell), and from [[Nabopolassar]], who was a [[Chaldea]]n, politically and militarily opposed to Assyria, and not in fact an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]].<ref>F Leo Oppenheim - Ancient Mesopotamia</ref>

==Assyrian religion==
The Assyrians, like the rest of the Mesopotamian peoples, followed the [[Sumero-Akkadian]] [[Mesopotamian Religion]], with the national god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] having pride of place at the head of the pantheon. This religion survived in Assyria from circa 3500 BC through to its gradual decline in the face of Christianity between the 1st and 10th centuries AD.<ref name="nineveh.com"/>

Other major gods within the pantheon were: [[Anu]], [[Baal]], [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]], [[Enlil]], [[Ishtar]] ([[Astarte]]), [[Shamash]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adad]]/[[Hadad]], [[Sin (mythology)|Sin (Nanna)]], [[Dagon|Dagan]], [[Ninurta]], [[Nisroch]], [[Nergal]], [[Tiamat]], [[Ninlil]], [[Mullissu]], [[Zababa]] and [[El (deity)|El]].

Native religion was still strongly followed until at least until the 4th century AD, and survived in pockets until at least the 10th century AD,<ref name="nineveh.com"/> although Assyrians had begun to adopt [[East Syrian Rite|Eastern Rite]] [[Christianity]] (as well as for a time [[Manicheanism]] and [[Gnosticism]]) which, like [[Syriac]] literature, had its birthplace in Assyria between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD. Assyrians today are exclusively [[Christian]], with most following the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Ancient Church of the East]] and [[Syriac Orthodox]] churches.

==Language==
During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Akkadian language|Akkad]]ians, which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].<ref name='Deutscher'>{{cite book|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press US]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-953222-3|pages=20–21|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XFwUxmCdG94C}}</ref> The influence of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] on [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.<ref name='Deutscher'/> This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium BC as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.<ref name='Deutscher'/>

[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),<ref name="woods"/> but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.

In ancient times, Assyrians spoke a dialect of the [[Akkadian language]], an eastern branch of the [[Semitic languages]]. The first inscriptions, called Old Assyrian (OA), were made in the Old Assyrian period.<ref>George Roux - Ancient Iraq page 188</ref> In the Neo-Assyrian period the [[Aramaic language]] became increasingly common,<ref>Georges Roux -Ancient Iraq - Page 308</ref> more so than [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]&nbsp;— this was thought to be largely due to the mass deportations undertaken by Assyrian kings,<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq p382">Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq p382</ref> in which large Aramaic-speaking populations, conquered by the Assyrians, were relocated to Assyria and interbred with the Assyrians. The ancient Assyrians also used the [[Sumerian language]] in their literature and liturgy,<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq p382"/> although to a more limited extent in the Middle- and Neo-Assyrian periods, when Akkadian became the main literary language.<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq p382"/>

The destruction of the Assyrian capitals of Nineveh and Assur by the Babylonians, Medes and their allies, ensured that much of the bilingual elite (but not all) were wiped out. By the 7th century BC, much of the Assyrian population used Akkadian influenced Eastern Aramaic and not Akkadian itself. The last Akkadian inscriptions in Mesopotamia date from the 1st century AD. However, Eastern Aramaic dialects, as well as Akkadian and Mesopotamian Aramaic personal and family names, still survive to this day among [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] in the regions of northern [[Iraq]], southeast [[Turkey]], northwest [[Iran]] and northeast [[Syria]] that constituted old Assyria.<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq p382"/>

After 90 years of effort, the [[University of Chicago]] has published an Assyrian Dictionary, whose form is more [[encyclopedia]] in style than [[dictionary]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110604/ap_on_re_us/us_postcard_the90_year_dictionary_project |title=Ancient world dictionary finished — after 90 years|agency= Associated Press |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=4 June 2011 |accessdate=19 June 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Transport of cedar Dur Sharrukin.jpg|thumb|Relief from Assyrian capital of [[Dur Sharrukin]], showing transport of Lebanese cedar (8th century BC)]]
Assyrian art preserved to the present day predominantly dates to the Neo-Assyrian period. Art depicting battle scenes, and occasionally the impaling of whole villages in gory detail, was intended to show the power of the emperor, and was generally made for propaganda purposes. These stone reliefs lined the walls in the royal palaces where foreigners were received by the king. Other stone reliefs depict the king with different deities and conducting religious ceremonies. Many stone reliefs were discovered in the royal palaces at [[Nimrud]] (Kalhu) and [[Khorsabad]] (Dur-Sharrukin). A rare discovery of metal plates belonging to wooden doors was made at [[Balawat]] ([[Imgur-Enlil]]).

Assyrian sculpture reached a high level of refinement in the Neo-Assyrian period. One prominent example is the winged bull ''Lamassu'', or [[shedu]] that guard the entrances to the king's court. These were apotropaic meaning they were intended to ward off evil. C. W. Ceram states in ''The March of Archaeology'' that ''lamassi'' were typically sculpted with five legs so that four legs were always visible, whether the image were viewed frontally or in profile.

Although works of precious gems and metals usually do not survive the ravages of time, some fine pieces of Assyrian jewelry were found in royal tombs at Nimrud.

There is ongoing discussion among academics over the nature of the [[Nimrud lens]], a piece of [[quartz]] unearthed by [[Austen Henry Layard]] in 1850, in the Nimrud palace complex in northern [[Iraq]]. A small minority believe that it is evidence for the existence of ancient Assyrian telescopes, which could explain the great accuracy of [[Assyrian astronomy]]. Other suggestions include its use as a magnifying glass for jewellers, or as a decorative furniture inlay. The Nimrud Lens is held in the British Museum.<ref name = "Muſeum">[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=369215&partid=1 Lens], British Museum.</ref>

The Assyrians were also innovative in military technology, with the use of heavy cavalry, sappers, siege engines etc.

==Legacy==
{{main|Achaemenid Assyria|Assyriology|Assyrianism}}
[[File:Layard Nineveh.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Austen Henry Layard]] in Nineveh, 1852]]
[[Achaemenid]] Assyria (539 BC – 330 BC) retained a separate identity ([[Athura]]), official correspondence being in [[Imperial Aramaic]], and there was even a determined revolt of the two Assyrian provinces of Mada and Athura in 520 BC. Under [[Seleucid]] rule (330 BC – approximately 150 BC), however, [[Aramaic]] gave way to [[Greek language|Greek]] as the official administrative language. Aramaic was marginalised as an official language, but remained spoken in both Assyria and Babylonia by the general populace. It also remained the spoken tongue of the indigenous Assyrian/Babylonian citizens of all Mesopotamia under Persian, Greek and Roman rule, and indeed well into the [[Arab]] period it was still the language of the majority, particularly in the north of Mesopotamia, surviving to this day among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christians.

Between 150 BC and 226 AD, Assyria changed hands between the [[Parthians]] Iranians and Romans ([[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Province of Assyria]]) until coming under the rule of [[Sassanid]] Persia in 226 AD – 651 AD, where it was known as [[Asuristan]].

A number of at least partly neo-Assyrian kingdoms existed in the area between in the late classical and early Christian period also; [[Adiabene]], [[Hatra]] and [[Osroene]].

[[Mesopotamia in Classical literature|Classical historiographers]] and Biblical writers had only retained a fragmented, very dim and often inaccurate picture of Assyria. It was remembered that there had been an Assyrian empire predating the Persian one, but all particulars were lost. Thus Jerome's ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' lists 36 kings of the Assyrians, beginning with [[Ninus]], son of [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]], down to [[Sardanapalus]], the last king of the Assyrians before the empire fell to [[Arbaces]] the Median. Almost none of these have been substantiated as historical, with the exception of the Neo-Assyrian and Babylonian rulers listed in [[Ptolemy's Canon]], beginning with [[Nabonassar]].

Mesopotamian empires such as the Akkadian Empire, Babylonian Empire, Middle Assyrian Empire, Neo Assyrian Empire and Neo Babylonian Empire asserted Mesopotamian dominance from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] to [[Arabia]] and [[Egypt]], and from [[Cyprus]] and the east [[Mediterranean]] to [[Persia]]. Thus the influence exerted by the Babylonian-Assyrian religion was particularly profound on other [[Semites]], including the [[Hebrews]], [[Chaldea|Chaldeans]], [[Canaanites]], [[Arameans]], [[Phoenicians]] and [[Arabs]], while their astral theology affected the ancient world in general, including the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Greeks]], [[Armenians]] and the later [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. The impetus to the purification of the old [[Semitic]] [[polytheistic religions]] to which the [[Hebrews]] for a long time clung in common with their fellows — the various branches of nomadic [[Arameans]] and [[Arabs]] — was largely furnished by the remarkable civilization unfolded in the Euphrates valley and in many of the traditions, myths and legends embodied in the Old Testament; traces of direct adaptation from and responses to Babylonia and Assyria may be discerned, while the indirect influences in the domain of the prophetical books, as also in the [[Psalms]] and in the so-called "wisdom literature", are even more noteworthy. Stories in the [[Tanakh]], [[Old Testament]] and [[Quran]] such as; the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] [[creation narrative]], [[Tower of Babel]], [[The Great Flood]] and the book of [[Esther]], as well as various biblical characters such as [[Noah]], [[Nimrod]], [[Lilith]] and [[Asnapper]] bear clear influence from Assyria and Babylonia.<ref>Julian Jaynes (2000). The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. Mariner Books. Retrieved 2013-06-16</ref><ref>Georges Contenau La Magie chez les Assyriens et les Babyloniens, Paris, 1947</ref><ref>Harris, Stephen L. (2002). Understanding the Bible. McGraw-Hill. pp. 50–51.ISBN 9780767429160</ref>

Even when we reach the [[New Testament]] period, we have not passed entirely beyond the sphere of Babylonian-Assyrian influences. In such a movement as early [[Christian]] [[gnosticism]], Assyrio-Babylonian elements — modified, to be sure, and transformed — are largely present, while the growth of an apocalyptic literature is ascribed with apparent justice by many scholars to the recrudescence of views, the ultimate source of which is to be found in the astral-theology of the Babylonian and Assyrian Priests.

The Assyrians began to form and adopt a distinct [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Rite]] [[Christianity]], with its accompanying [[Syriac literature]], between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, however native religion was still alive and well into the 4th century AD, and pockets survived into the 10th century AD and possibly as late as the 17th century in Mardin. However, the religion is now dead, and the indigenous Assyrian (aka Chaldo-Assyrian) people, though still retaining Eastern Aramaic dialects as a mother tongue, are now wholly Christian.

The [[modern discovery of Babylonia and Assyria]] begins with excavations in [[Nineveh]] in 1845, which revealed the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]]. Decipherment of [[cuneiform]] was a formidable task that took more than a decade; but, by 1857, the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] was convinced that reliable reading of cuneiform texts was possible. [[Assyriology]] has since pieced together the formerly largely forgotten history of Mesopotamia. In the wake of the archaeological and philological [[rediscovery of ancient Assyria]], [[Assyrian nationalism]] became increasingly popular among the surviving remnants of the [[Assyrian people]], and has come to strongly identify with ancient Assyria.
