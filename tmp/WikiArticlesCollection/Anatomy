'''Anatomy''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνατέμνω }} – ''anatemnō'', "I cut up, cut open" from ἀνά – ''ana'', "on, upon", and τέμνω – ''temnō'', "I cut") is the study of the [[body plan]] of animals. In some of its facets, anatomy is closely related to [[embryology]], [[comparative anatomy]] and [[Phylogenetics|comparative embryology]],<ref name="intro HGray">{{cite web | url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html| title= Introduction page, "Anatomy of the Human Body".

[[Human anatomy]] is important in medicine.

The discipline of anatomy is subdivided into gross (or [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]]) anatomy and [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] anatomy. [[Gross anatomy]] is the study of structures that can, when suitably presented or [[dissection|dissected]], be seen by unaided vision with the naked eye. [[Microscopic anatomy]] is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, including [[histology]] (the study of tissues) and [[Cell biology|cytology]] (the study of cells).

The [[history of anatomy]] is characterized by a continual development in understanding of the functions of the [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and structures of the [[human body]]. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from examination of animals through dissection of [[cadaver]]s (dead human bodies) to 20th century techniques including [[X-ray machine|X-ray]], [[Ultrasound imaging|ultrasound]], and [[MRI|magnetic resonance imaging]].

== Overview ==
Anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of living things including their systems, organs, and tissues. It includes the appearance and position of the various parts, the materials from which they are composed, their locations and their relationships with other parts. Anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry, which deal with the functions of those parts. For example, an anatomist is concerned with the shape, size, position, structure, blood supply and enervation of an organ such as the liver, while a physiologist is interested in the production of [[bile]] and the role of the liver in nutrition and regulating body functions.<ref name=Everyman>{{cite book |title=Everyman's Encyclopedia: Anatomy |last=Bozman |first=E. F. (ed.) |year=1967 |publisher=J. M. Dent & Sons |asin=B0066E44EC |page=272 }}</ref>

The discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a number of branches including gross or [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] anatomy and [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] anatomy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/microscopic+anatomy |title=Anatomy |year=2007 |work=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |accessdate=2013-07-08}}</ref> [[Gross anatomy]] is the study of structures that are large enough to be seen with the naked eye. It can be studied using both invasive and non-invasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems. Methods used include [[dissection]], in which the body is [[Surgery|surgically]] opened and its organs studied, and [[endoscopy]], in which a [[video camera]]-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures. [[Angiography]] is a proceeding in which blood vessels are visualized after being injected with an opaque dye, [[X-ray]]s and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] being used for this purpose.<ref name="intro HGray" /> [[Microscopic anatomy]] is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, including [[histology]] (the study of tissues), and [[embryology]] (the study of the human organism in its immature condition).<ref name="intro HGray" />

The term "anatomy" is commonly taken to refer to [[human anatomy]]. However, substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals. The structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in [[plant anatomy]].<ref name=Everyman/>

In 1600 BCE, the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]], an Ancient Egyptian [[Medical manual|medical text]], described the [[heart]], its vessels, [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[kidneys]], [[hypothalamus]], [[uterus]] and [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], and showed the [[blood vessel]]s diverging from the heart.

In the United States, medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the 18th century. Classes in anatomy needed a continual stream of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain. Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York were all renowned for [[body snatching]] activity as criminals raided graveyards at night, removing newly buried corpses from their coffins.<ref name=trafficdead><cite>{{cite book |author=Sappol, Michael |title=A traffic of dead bodies: anatomy and embodied social identity in nineteenth-century America |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=2002 |isbn=0-691-05925-X |url=http://books.google.com/books/princeton?id=-9cKRzEx6ywC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Traffic+of+Dead+Bodies}}</ref> A similar problem existed in Britain where demand for bodies became so great that grave-raiding and even [[anatomy murder]] were practised to obtain cadavers.<ref name="Rosner, Lisa. 2010">Rosner, Lisa. 2010.

The teaching of anatomy in Britain was transformed by Sir [[John Struthers (anatomist)|John Struthers]], [[Regius Professor of Anatomy (Aberdeen)|Regius Professor of Anatomy]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]] from 1863 to 1889. He was responsible for setting up the system of three years of "pre-clinical" academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. This system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003. As well as teaching, he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of [[comparative anatomy]], published over 70 research papers, and became famous for his public dissection of the [[Tay Whale]].<ref name=pmid1717373426>{{cite pmid|17373426}}</ref><ref name="pmid15712576">{{cite pmid|15712576}}</ref> From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools.<ref name="McLachlan, J. 2006. p.243-53">McLachlan, J. & Patten, D. 2006.

[[File:MRI brain sagittal section.jpg|thumb|right|Sagittal [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scan of the head]]
Before the era of modern medical procedures, the main means for studying the internal structure of the body were [[palpation]] and [[dissection]]. It was the advent of [[microscopy]] that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of [[achromatic lens]]es increased the [[Angular resolution|resolving power]] of the microscope and around 1839, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]] identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the [[microtome]] was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of cell. The fields of [[Cell biology|cytology]] and [[histology]] developed from here in the late 19th century.<ref name=BritMicro>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22980/anatomy/283/Microscopic-anatomy |title=Microscopic anatomy |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=14 October 2013}}</ref> The invention of the [[electron microscope]] brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the [[ultrastructure]] of cells and the [[organelle]]s and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of [[X-ray diffraction]] for studying the crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of [[molecular anatomy]].<ref name=BritMicro/>

Short wavelength electromagnetic radiation such as [[X-ray]]s can be passed through the body and are used in medical [[radiography]] to view interior structures which have different degrees of opaqueness. Nowadays, modern techniques such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]], [[X-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]], [[fluoroscopy]] and [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound imaging]] have enabled researchers and practitioners to examine organs, living or dead, in unprecedented detail. They are used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes and provide information on the internal structures and organs of the body to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/foxhumphys/student/olc/h-reading1.html | title=Anatomical Imaging | publisher=McGraw Hill Higher Education | year=1998 | accessdate=25 June 2013}}</ref>

== Animal tissues ==
The [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[Animalia]] contains multicellular organisms that are [[heterotroph]]ic and [[Motility|motile]] (although some have secondarily adopted a [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] lifestyle). Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and these animals are known as [[metazoa]]ns or [[eumetazoa]]ns. They have an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber, with one or two openings, the [[gamete]]s are produced in multicellular sex organs and the [[zygote]]s include a [[blastula]] stage in their [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. Metazoans do not include the sponges, phylum [[Porifera]], or the [[Placozoa]]ns which have undifferentiated cells.<ref name=Dorit549>{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=547–549 }}</ref>

Animal cells do not have a cell wall and do not contain [[chloroplast]]s. If a vacuole is present, it is smaller than that found in a plant cell. The body tissues are composed of a great variety of cells such as muscle, nerve and blood cells. Each typically has a cell membrane formed of [[phospholipid]]s, [[cytoplasm]] and a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. Animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types: [[connective tissue|connective]], [[epithelium|epithelial]], [[muscle tissue|muscle]] and [[nervous tissue|nervous]]. Even the simplest invertebrates contain at least two types and body structures and organs of higher animals are formed from multiple tissue types.<ref name=Ruppert60>{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |pages=59–60 }}</ref>

Connective tissues are fibrous tissues and are made up of cells scattered among non-living material which is called the [[extracellular matrix]]. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, blood, cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, one of the commonest of which is [[collagen]], and plays an important part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An [[exoskeleton]] is a thickened, rigid [[cuticle]] which is stiffened by mineralization, as in [[crustacean]]s or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An [[endoskeleton]] is internal and is present in all higher animals and many lower ones.<ref name="Ruppert60" />

[[File:Skinlayers.png|thumb|left|Layers of epithelial cells in the epidermis]]
Epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells with little intercellular space. They can be [[Squamous epithelial cell|squamous]] (flat), [[Simple cuboidal epithelium|cuboidal]] or [[Columnar epithelial cell|columnar]] and rest on a [[basal lamina]], a membrane composed of extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. The cells are bound closely to each other by [[cell adhesion molecule]]s. One or more layers of epithelial cells line the [[body cavities|cavities]] and surfaces of structures throughout the body including the external surface, the respiratory surface and the gut. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of [[glycoproteins]].<ref name="Ruppert60" /> In more advanced animals, many [[gland]]s are formed of epithelial cells.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/kabernd/BerndCV/Lab/EpithelialInfoWeb/Glandular%20Epithelium.html |title=Glandular epithelium |author=Bernt, Karen |year=2010 |work=Epithelial Cells |publisher=Davidson College |accessdate=25 June 2013}}</ref>

[[Myocyte|Muscle cells]] (myocytes) form the active contractile tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile [[Myofibril|filaments]] and is separated into three types; [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]], [[Skeletal striated muscle|skeletal muscle]] and obliquely striated muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractability over a wide range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Cross-striated muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in [[earthworm]]s that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions.<ref name=Ruppert103>{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |page=103 }}</ref> In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the inner linings of organs and [[cardiac muscle]] is found in the [[heart]], allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.

Nervous tissue is composed of many nerve cells known as [[neuron]]s which transmit information. In [[Symmetry_in_biology#Radial_symmetry|radially symmetrical]] animals such as [[sea anemone]]s and [[jellyfish]] the nerves form a nerve net but in [[Symmetry_in_biology#Bilateral_symmetry|bilaterally symmetrical]] animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialised receptor cells such as [[chemoreceptor]]s and [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] are found in groups and send messages along neurons to other parts of the organism. Neurons can be connected together in [[Ganglion|ganglia]].<ref name=Ruppert104>{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |page=104 }}</ref> In higher animals these form the sense organs and there is a [[central nervous system]] (brain and spinal cord) and a [[peripheral nervous system]]. The latter consists of [[Sensory neuron|sensory nerves]] that transmit information from sense organs and [[Motor neuron|motor nerves]] that stimulate muscles to contract.<ref name=Ruppert107>{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |pages=105–107 }}</ref>

Human anatomy, including gross [[human anatomy]] and histology, is primarily the scientific study of the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the adult human body. It differs from [[physiology]] in that anatomy is about the morphology of biological structures, while physiology is the way those structures actually work.<ref name="intro HGray" />

Generally, students of certain [[biology|biological sciences]], [[paramedic]]s, prosthetists and orthotists, [[physical therapy|physiotherapists]], [[occupational therapy|occupational therapists]], [[Nursing|nurses]], and [[medical school|medical students]] learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of [[dissection]] and inspection of [[cadaver]]s. The study of microscopic anatomy (or [[histology]]) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a [[microscope]].

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
All vertebrates are built along the basic chordate [[body plan]]: a stiff rod running through the length of the animal ([[vertebral column]] or [[notochord]]),<ref>{{cite web |last=Waggoner |first=Ben |title=Vertebrates: More on Morphology |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/vertmm.html |publisher=UCMP |accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref> with a hollow tube of nervous tissue, the [[spinal cord]] above it and the [[gastrointestinal tract]] below. Nervous tissue is derived from the [[ectoderm]], connective tissues are derived from [[mesoderm]], and gut is derived from the [[endoderm]]. At the posterior end is a [[tail]] which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the [[anus]] at the base of the tail.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Vertebrate Body |last=Romer |first=Alfred Sherwood |year=1985 |publisher=Holt Rinehart & Winston |isbn=978-0030584466 |page= }}</ref> The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, in which the notochord has been replaced by a segmented series of stiffer elements ([[vertebra]]e) separated by mobile joints ([[intervertebral disc]]s), which each contain a soft central core ([[nucleus pulposus]]), derived from the notochord of the embryo. However, a few vertebrates have secondarily lost this anatomy, retaining the notochord into adulthood. These include the [[sturgeon]] and the [[coelacanth]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Functional anatomy of the vertebrates: an evolutionary perspective|year=2001|publisher=Harcourt College Publishers|isbn=978-0-03-022369-3|author=Liem, Karel F.|coauthors=Warren Franklin Walker|page=277}}</ref> [[Gnathostomata|Jawed vertebrates]] are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor.

=== Fish anatomy ===
{{main|Fish anatomy}}
[[File:BLW Meyer's Butterfly Fish.jpg|thumb|right|Skeleton of a [[butterfly fish]] showing the [[vertebral column]] and fin rays]]
The body of a fish is divided into a head, trunk and tail, although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of [[cartilage]] (cartilaginous fish) or [[bone]] ([[bony fishes]]). The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating [[vertebra]]e which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine and there are no [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the [[fin]]s, are composed of bony spines and soft rays and, with the exception of the [[caudal fin]]s, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk.<ref name=Dorit818/> The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the [[gill]]s and on round the body in a single circulatory loop.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003758/Development/fish.htm |title=The fish heart |work=ThinkQuest |publisher=Oracle |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or [[middle ear]]. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the [[lateral line]] system on the flanks which responds to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.<ref name=Dorit818>{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=816–818 }}</ref>

Sharks and rays are [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] fish with numerous [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]] anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal [[Fish scale#Placoid scales|placoid scales]]. They have a [[cloaca]] into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a [[swim bladder]]. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, [[Egg yolk|yolky]] eggs. Some species are [[ovoviviparous]] and the young develop internally but others are [[oviparous]] and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.<ref name=Kotpal>{{cite book |title=Modern Text Book of Zoology: Vertebrates |last=Kotpal |first=R. L. |last2= |first2= |year=2010 |publisher=Rastogi Publications |isbn=9788171338917 |page=193 |url=http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=U7N1j-8LMsEC&pg=PA199&dq=%22origin+of+fins%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4vYeUeKWI9CgkgXUhIHYCQ&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22origin%20of%20fins%22&f=false }}</ref>

The bony fish lineage shows more [[Derived trait|derived]] anatomical traits, often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an [[operculum (fish)|operculum]], and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout. The dermis is covered with overlapping [[Fish scale|scales]]. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca. They mostly [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.<ref name=Kotpal/>

=== Amphibian anatomy ===
{{main|Amphibian anatomy}}
[[File:Ceratophrys cornuta skeleton front.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Frog skeleton|Skeleton of [[Surinam horned frog]]<br>(''Ceratophrys cornuta'')]]
[[Amphibian]]s are a [[Class (biology)|class]] of animals comprising frogs, [[salamander]]s and [[caecilian]]s. They are [[tetrapod]]s, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have [[articular processes]]. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little [[keratin]] and lacks scales, but contains many [[mucous gland]]s and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two [[atrium (heart)|atria]] and one [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. They have a [[urinary bladder]] and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as [[urea]]. Amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the [[Buccopharyngeal membrane|buccopharyngeal]] region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |last2=Cohen |first2=Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-03281-5 |pages=24–25 }}</ref> They supplement this with [[gas exchange]] through the skin which needs to be kept moist.<ref name=Dorit859>{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=843–859 }}</ref>

In frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs. The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble [[earthworm]]s and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |last2=Cohen |first2=Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-03281-5 |pages=26–35 }}</ref>

=== Reptile anatomy ===
{{main|Reptile anatomy}}
[[File:SnakeSkelLyd.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Skeleton of a snake, drawn by [[Richard Lydekker]], 1896]]

Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, [[tuatara]]s, [[lizard]]s, snakes and [[Crocodilia|crocodiles]]. They are [[tetrapod]]s, but the snakes and a few species of [[Legless lizard|lizards]] either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system is designed for internal fertilisation, with a [[Sex organ|copulatory organ]] present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by [[Amniote|amniotic membranes]] which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or [[Ovoviviparity|develop internally]] in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as [[uric acid]].<ref name=Dorit865>{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=861–865 }}</ref>

Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny [[carapace]] above and a [[plastron]] below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.<ref name=Dorit868>{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=865–868 }}</ref>

Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the [[Triassic]] Period. There is one living species, ''[[Sphenodon punctatus]]''. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than is the case in other reptiles and the lungs have a single chamber and lack [[Bronchus|bronchi]]. The tuatara has a well-developed [[parietal eye]] on its forehead.<ref name=Dorit868/>

Lizards have skulls with only one [[Skull#Fenestrae|fenestra]] on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.<ref name=Dorit868/>

Snakes are closely related to lizards, having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the [[Cretaceous]] Period, and they share many of the same features. The skeleton consists of a skull, a hyoid bone, spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of [[pelvic spur]]s. The bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole. Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent "spectacle" scales. They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull. Their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm-blooded prey.<ref name=Dorit870>{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |page=870 }}</ref>

Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinised scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.<ref name=Dorit874>{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |page=874 }}</ref>

=== Bird anatomy ===
{{main|Bird anatomy}}
[[File:AlcedoSkeleton.jpg|thumb|left|Skeleton of the [[Common Kingfisher]] (''Alcedo atthis'')]]
Birds are [[tetrapod]]s but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping, their front limbs are [[wing]]s covered with [[feather]]s and adapted for flight. Birds are [[endotherm]]ic, have a high [[metabolic rate]], a light [[Skeleton|skeletal system]] and powerful [[muscle]]s. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.<ref name=Dorit895>{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=881–895 }}</ref>

The feathers are outgrowths of the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single [[uropygial gland]] near the base of the tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird [[personal grooming|preens]]. There are scales on the legs and feet and claws on the tips of the toes.<ref name=Dorit895/>

=== Mammal anatomy ===
{{Main|Mammal anatomy}}
[[File:Great Dane and Chihuahua Skeletons.jpg|thumb|right|Skeletons of a [[Great Dane]] and a [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]]]]
Mammals are a diverse class of animals, mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of [[Tooth enamel|prismatic enamel]]. The teeth are shed once ([[Deciduous teeth|milk teeth]]) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, as is the case in [[cetacea]]ns. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a [[cochlea]] in the [[inner ear]]. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete [[sweat gland|sweat]]. Some of these glands are specialised as [[mammary gland]]s, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with [[lung]]s and have a muscular [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.<ref name=Dorit914>{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=909–914 }}</ref>

Mammals are [[amniote]]s, and most are [[Vivipary|viviparous]], giving birth to live young. The exception to this are the egg-laying [[monotreme]]s, the [[platypus]] and the [[echidna]]s of Australia. Most other mammals have a [[placenta]] through which the developing [[foetus]] obtains nourishment, but in [[marsupial]]s, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's [[Pouch (marsupial)|pouch]] where it latches on to a [[nipple]] and completes its development.<ref name=Dorit914/>

== Invertebrate anatomy ==
Invertebrates constitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular [[eukaryote]]s to such complex creatures as the octopus, lobster and dragonfly. By definition, none of them has a backbone. The cells of single-cell [[protozoa]]ns have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialised into the equivalent of tissues and organs. Locomotion is often provided by [[Cilium|cilia]] or [[Flagellum|flagella]] or may proceed via the advance of [[pseudopodia]], food may be gathered by [[phagocytosis]], energy needs may be supplied by [[photosynthesis]] and the cell may be supported by an [[endoskeleton]] or an [[exoskeleton]]. Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.<ref>{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |pages=23–24 }}</ref>

[[Metazoa]]ns are multicellular organism, different groups of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an [[extracellular matrix]] which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the [[mesoderm]] is present in [[echinoderm]]s, [[sponge]]s and some [[cephalopod]]s. [[Exoskeleton]]s are derived from the epidermis and is composed of [[chitin]] in [[arthropod]]s (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). [[Calcium carbonate]] constitutes the shells of [[Mollusca|molluscs]], [[brachiopod]]s and some tube-building [[Polychaete|polychaete worms]] and [[silica]] forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic [[diatom]]s and [[radiolaria]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/198292/exoskeleton |title=Exoskeleton |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2 July 2013}}</ref> Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the [[pinacoderm]] of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians ([[polyp]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, [[jellyfish]]) and the [[collagen]]ous cuticle of [[annelid]]s. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as [[Microvillus|microvilli]], cilia, bristles, [[Spine (zoology)|spines]] and [[tubercle]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289723/integument |title=Integument |author= Ebling, F.

=== Insect anatomy ===
{{main|Insect anatomy}}

Insects possess [[segmentation (biology)|segment]]ed bodies supported by a hard-jointed outer covering made mostly of chitin. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] and an [[abdomen]].<ref>{{cite web | title=O. Orkin Insect zoo | url=http://insectzoo.msstate.edu/Students/basic.structure.html | year=1997 | publisher=Mississippi State University | accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref> The head typically bears a pair of sensory [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]], a pair of [[compound eye]]s, one to three simple eyes ([[ocelli]]) and three sets of modified appendages that form the [[insect mouthparts|mouthparts]]. The thorax has three pairs of segmented [[arthropod leg|legs]], one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one or two pairs of [[insect wing|wings]]. The abdomen is composed of eleven segments, some of which may be fused and houses the [[digestion|digestive]], [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]], [[Excretion|excretory]] and reproductive systems.<ref name="Gullan and Cranston">{{cite book |last=Gullan |first=P.J. |last2=Cranston |first2=P.
