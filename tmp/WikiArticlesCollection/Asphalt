The primary use of asphalt/bitumen is in road construction, where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] particles to create [[asphalt concrete]]. Its other main uses are for [[bituminous waterproofing]] products, including production of [[roofing felt]] and for sealing flat roofs.

The terms ''asphalt'' and ''bitumen'' are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance. In [[American English]], asphalt (or asphalt cement) is the carefully refined residue from the [[distillation]] process of selected crude oils. Outside the United States, the product is often called bitumen. Geological terminology often prefers the term bitumen. Common usage often refers to various forms of asphalt/bitumen as "tar", such as at the [[La Brea Tar Pits]]. Another term, mostly archaic, refers to asphalt/bitumen as "pitch". The pitch used in this mixture is sometimes found in natural deposits but usually made by the distillation of crude oil.

Naturally occurring asphalt/bitumen is sometimes specified by the term "crude bitumen". Its viscosity is similar to that of cold [[molasses]]<ref>{{cite web

==Etymology==
The word ''asphalt'' is derived from the late Middle English, in turn from French ''asphalte'', based on [[Late Latin]] ''asphalton'', ''asphaltum'', which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἄσφαλτος (''ásphaltos'', ''ásphalton''), a word meaning "asphalt/bitumen/[[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Fsfaltos ἄσφαλτος],  Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> which perhaps derives from α- "without" and σφάλλω, (''sfallō''), "make fall".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfa%2Fllw σφάλλω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> Note that in French, the term ''asphalte'' is used for naturally occurring bitumen-soaked limestone deposits, and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the "asphaltic concrete" used to pave roads. It is a significant fact that the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application. Specifically [[Herodotus]] mentioned that bitumen was brought to Babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall.<ref>Herodotus, ''The Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+1.179.4&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 1.179.4], on Perseus</ref>  From the Greek, the word passed into late Latin, and thence into French (''asphalte'') and English ("asphaltum" and "asphalt").

The expression "bitumen" originated in the Sanskrit, where we find the words ''jatu'', meaning "pitch," and ''jatu-krit'', meaning "pitch creating", "pitch producing" (referring to coniferous or resinous trees). The Latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally ''gwitu-men'' (pertaining to pitch), and by others, ''pixtumens'' (exuding or bubbling pitch), which was subsequently shortened to ''bitumen'', thence passing via French into English. From the same root is derived the Anglo Saxon word ''cwidu'' (mastix), the German word ''Kitt'' (cement or mastic) and the old Norse word ''kvada''.<ref name="Abraham19381">Abraham, Herbert (1938), p.1</ref>

Neither of the terms asphalt or bitumen should be confused with [[tar]] or [[coal tars]].

=== Modern usage ===
In [[British English]], the word 'asphalt' is used to refer to a mixture of mineral aggregate and asphalt/bitumen (also called [[tarmac]] in common parlance). The earlier word 'asphaltum' is now archaic and not commonly used. In [[American English]], 'asphalt' is equivalent to the British 'bitumen'. However, 'asphalt' is also commonly used as a shortened form of '[[asphalt concrete]]' (therefore equivalent to the British 'asphalt' or 'tarmac'). In [[Australian English]], bitumen is often used as the generic term for road surfaces. In [[Canadian English]], the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy [[crude oil]],<ref name=oilsands>{{cite web

Bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi-solid form of petroleum. Bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen. The [[tar sands]] of [[Alberta, Canada]] are a similar material.

==Chemistry==
{{see also|Asphaltene}}
The substance is completely soluble in [[carbon disulfide]], and composed primarily of a mixture of highly condensed [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s; it is most commonly modelled as a [[colloid]], with [[asphaltene]]s as the dispersed phase and [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/maltene maltenes] as the continuous phase (though there is some disagreement amongst [[chemist]]s regarding its structure). One writer stated although a "considerable amount of work has been done on the composition of asphalt, it is exceedingly difficult to separate individual hydrocarbon in pure form",<ref name="Quddus">{{cite book|author=Muhammad Abdul Quddus|year=1992 | title=thesis submitted to Department of Applied Chemistry; University of Karachi |chapter=Catalytic Oxidation of Asphalt| publisher=Higher Education Commission Pakistan: Pakistan Research Repository| location=Pakistan |page=6, in ch.2 pdf |url=http://eprints.hec.gov.pk/1171/1/891.html.htm}}</ref> and "it is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of asphalt, because the number of molecules with different chemical structure is extremely large".<ref name="Quddus99">Muhammad Abdul Quddus (1992), p.99, in ch.5 pdf</ref>

Most natural bitumens contain [[sulfur]] and several heavy metals, such as [[nickel]], [[vanadium]], [[lead]], [[chromium]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[arsenic]], [[selenium]], and other toxic elements.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Bitumens can provide good preservation of plants and animal fossils.

Asphalt/bitumen can sometimes be confused with "[[coal tar|tar]]", which is a similar black, thermoplastic material produced by the [[destructive distillation]] of [[coal]]. During the early  and mid-20th century when [[town gas]] was produced, tar was a readily available product and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates. The addition of tar to [[macadam]] roads led to the word [[tarmac]], which is now used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials. However, since the 1970s, when [[natural gas]] succeeded town gas, asphalt/bitumen has completely overtaken the use of tar in these applications. Other examples of this confusion include the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] and the Canadian [[tar sands]]. Pitch is another term mistakenly used at times to refer to asphalt/bitumen, as in [[Pitch Lake]].

Asphalt/bitumen can be separated from the other components in crude oil (such as [[naphtha]], [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]) by the process of [[fractional distillation]], usually under [[vacuum]] conditions. A better separation can be achieved by further processing of the heavier fractions of the crude oil in a [[de-asphalting unit]], which uses either [[propane]] or [[butane]] in a [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] phase to dissolve the lighter molecules which are then separated. Further processing is possible by "blowing" the product: namely reacting it with [[oxygen]]. This makes the product harder and more viscous.

Asphalt/bitumen is typically stored and transported at temperatures around 150°C (300°F).  Sometimes [[diesel oil]] or [[kerosene]] are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture. This mixture is often called "bitumen feedstock", or BFS. Some [[dump truck]]s route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm.  The backs of tippers carrying asphalt/bitumen, as well as some handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release. Diesel oil is no longer used as a [[release agent]] due to environmental concerns.

==History==

===Geological origin===
[[File:Puy de Poix, gisement bitumeux.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Bituminous outcrop of the Puy de la Poix, [[Clermont-Ferrand]], [[France]]]]
Naturally occurring deposits of asphalt/bitumen are formed from the remains of ancient, microscopic [[algae]] ([[diatom]]s) and other once-living things.  These remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where the organisms lived. Under the [[heat]] (above 50°C) and [[pressure]] of burial deep in the earth, the remains were transformed into materials such as asphalt/bitumen, [[kerogen]], or [[petroleum]]. Deposits at the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] are an example.

Natural deposits of asphalt/bitumen include lakes such as the [[Pitch Lake]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Lake Bermudez]] in [[Venezuela]].  Natural seeps of asphalt/bitumen occur in the La Brea Tar Pits and in the [[Dead Sea]].

Asphalt/bitumen also occurs as impregnated sandstones known as bituminous rock and the similar "tar sands" such as in Athabasca, Canada and Utah, USA. The [[Athabasca oil sands|Athabasca tar sands]] are located in the [[McMurray Formation]], Alberta.  This Formation is of early [[Cretaceous]] age, and is composed of numerous lenses of oil-bearing sand with up to 20% oil.<ref name=bunger>J. Bunger, K. Thomas and S. Dorrence.  1979.  Compound types and properties of Utah and Athabasca tar sand bitumens.  Fuel 58(3), 183-195.</ref> Isotopic studies attribute the oil deposits to be about 110 Ma old.<ref>D. Selby and R. Creaser.  2005.  Direct radiometric dating of hydrocarbon deposits using rhenium-osmium isotopes.  Science 308, 1293-1295.</ref> Heavy oil or bitumen deposits also occur in the [[Uinta Basin]] in Utah, USA.  The Tar Sand Triangle deposit, for example, is roughly 6% bitumen.<ref name=bunger />

Asphalt/bitumen occurs in [[hydrothermal vein]]s.  An example of this is within the Uinta Basin of Utah, USA, where there is a swarm of laterally and vertically extensive veins composed of a solid hydrocarbon termed [[Gilsonite]].  These veins formed by the polymerisation and solidification of hydrocarbons that were mobilized from the deeper oil shales of the [[Green River Formation]] during burial and diagenesis.<ref>{{cite book |author=T. Boden and B. Tripp |title=Gilsonite Veins of the Uinta Basin, Utah |publisher=Utah Geological Survey, Special Study 141 |location=Utah, USA |year=2012}}</ref>

There are structural similarities between asphalt/bitumen and the organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites.<ref>Hayatsu et al., Meteoritics, Vol. 18, p.310</ref> However, detailed studies have shown these materials to be distinct.<ref>Kim & Yang, Journal of Astronomy and Space Sciences, vol. 15, no. 1, p.163-174</ref>

===Ancient times===
The use of asphalt/bitumen for waterproofing and as an adhesive dates at least to the fifth [[millennium]] B.C. in the early [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus community]] of [[Mehrgarh]], where it was used to line the baskets in which they gathered [[crop]]s.<ref>McIntosh, Jane. The Ancient Indus Valley. p. 57</ref>

In the ancient [[Middle East]], the [[Sumer]]ians used natural asphalt/bitumen deposits for [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] between bricks and stones, to cement parts of carvings, such as eyes, into place, for ship [[caulking]], and for waterproofing.<ref name="Abraham1938" /> The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] said hot asphalt/bitumen was used as mortar in the walls of [[Babylon]].<ref>Herodotus, Book I, 179</ref>

In some versions of the [[Book of Genesis]] in the [[Bible]], the name of the substance used to bind the bricks of the [[Tower of Babel]] is translated as bitumen (see Gen 11:3), while other translations use the word ''pitch''. A one-kilometre tunnel beneath the river [[Euphrates]] at [[Babylon]] in the time of Queen [[Semiramis]] (ca. 800 B.C.) was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with asphalt/bitumen as a waterproofing agent.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/asphaltsandallie031010mbp/asphaltsandallie031010mbp_djvu.txt|title=Asphalts And Allied Substances|year=1920|author=Abraham, Herbert|publisher=D.

Asphalt/bitumen was used by [[ancient Egypt]]ians to [[embalm]] mummies.<ref name="Abraham1938" /><ref>{{cite book |author=Pringle, Heather Anne |title=The Mummy Congress: Science, Obsession, and the Everlasting Dead |publisher=Barnes & Noble Books |location=New York, NY |year=2001 |pages= 196–197|isbn=0-7607-7151-0}}</ref> The [[Persian language|Persian]] word for asphalt is ''moom'', which is related to the English word [[mummy]]. The Egyptians' primary source of asphalt/bitumen was the [[Dead Sea]], which the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] knew as ''Palus Asphaltites'' (Asphalt Lake).

Approximately 40 AD, [[Dioscorides]] described the Dead Sea material as ''Judaicum bitumen'', and noted other places in the region where it could be found: 
<blockquote>"The Judaicum Bitumen is better than others; that is reckoned the best, which doth shine like purple, being of a strong scent & weightie, but the black and fowle is naught for it is adulterated with Pitch mixed with it. It growes in [[Phoenice]] also, and in [[Sidon]], & in [[Babylon]], & in [[Zakynthos|Zacynthum]]. It is found also moyst swimming upon wells in the country of the [[Agrigento|Agrigentines]] of [[Sicily|Sicilie]], which they use for lamps instead of oyle, and which they call falsely Sicilian oyle, for it is a kinde of moyst Bitumen."<ref>{{cite book|title=De Materia Medica|author=Pedanius Dioscorides|year=ca. 40 A.D.}} translated by Goodyer (1655) [http://www.therenaissanceman.org/images/DIOSCORIDES-Intro_Book_1.doc] ''or'' ''(Greek/Latin)'' compiled by Sprengel (1829) [http://books.google.com/books/download/Pedanii_Dioscoridis_____de_materia_medic.pdf?id=JwAUAAAAQAAJ&output=pdf] p. 100 (p. 145 in PDF)</ref></blockquote>

In the ancient [[Far East]], natural asphalt/bitumen was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher fractions, leaving a material of higher molecular weight which is thermoplastic and when layered on objects, became quite hard upon cooling. This was used to cover objects that needed waterproofing,<ref name="Abraham1938" /> such as [[scabbard]]s and other items. Statuettes of household [[deities]] were also cast with this type of material in [[Japan]], and probably also in [[China]].

In [[North America]], archaeological recovery has indicated asphalt/bitumen was sometimes used to adhere stone [[projectile point]]s to  wooden shafts.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18502 |title=C.Michael Hogan (2008) '&#39;Morro Creek'&#39;, ed. by A.

===Early use in Europe===
The [[Greek fire]], which composition was a military secret of the [[Byzantine navy]], contained, among other things, asphalt/bitumen as a component. 100 years after the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, [[Pierre Belon]] described in his work ''[[Observations (Pierre Belon)|Observations]]'' in 1553 that ''pissasphalto'' a mixture of [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and bitumen was used in [[Dubrovnik]] for tarring of ships from where it was exported to a market place in [[Venice]] where it could be bought by anyone.<ref>Africa and the Discovery of America, Volume 1, page 183, [[Leo Wiener]], BoD – Books on Demand, 1920 reprinted in 2012, ISBN 9783864034329</ref>
An 1838 edition of ''Mechanics Magazine'' cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by "a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel", and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways - "principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth", which at that time made the water unusable. "He expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces" in palaces, "the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a Parisian of that generation".<ref name="MechanicsMagazineSep1838176">{{cite book|first=|last=|year=1838| month= 7th-29 April September | title=The Mechanic's magazine, museum, register, journal and gazette| volume=29|chapter=Nothing New under the Sun (on French asphaltum use in 1621)| publisher=W.A.

Then, in the 1830s, there was a surge of interest, and asphalt became widely used "for pavements, flat roofs, and the lining of cisterns, and in England, some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes". Its rise in Europe was "a sudden phenomenon", after natural deposits were found "in France at Osbann ([[Bas-Rhin|BasRhin]]), the Parc (l'Ain) and the Puy-de-la-Poix ([[Puy-de-Dôme|Puy-de-Dome]])", although it could also be made artificially.<ref name="LewisMiles">{{cite book |author=Miles, Lewis |title=in Australian Building: A Cultural Investigation |volume=|chapter=Section 10.6: Damp Proofing|year=2000 | publisher= | location=|page=10.06.1| url=http://www.mileslewis.net/australian-building/pdf/climatic-design/climatic-design-damp-proofing.pdf|accessdate=2009-11-11}}.

===Photography and art===
Asphalt/bitumen was used in early photographic technology. In 1826 or 1827, it was used by [[France|French]] scientist [[Joseph Nicéphore Niépce]] to make the [[View from the Window at Le Gras|oldest surviving photograph from nature]]. The asphalt/bitumen was thinly coated onto a [[pewter]] plate which was then exposed in a [[camera]]. Exposure to light hardened the asphalt/bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making asphalt/bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a [[photoresist]] in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.<ref>[http://www.niepce.org/pagus/pagus-inv.html Niépce Museum history pages.] Retrieved 2012-10-27.</ref><ref>[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/wfp/ The First Photograph (Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin).] Retrieved 2012-10-27.</ref>

Asphalt/bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century.  Although widely used for a time, it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common dilutents, such as linseed oil, varnish  and turpentine.  Unless thoroughly diluted, asphalt/bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact.  The use of asphalt/bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colours to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of a good many paintings, those of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] being just one notable example.  Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of asphalt/bitumen is [[Théodore Géricault]]'s [[Raft of the Medusa]] (1818-1819), where his use of asphalt/bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle.

===Early use in the United Kingdom===
Among the earlier uses of asphalt/bitumen in the United Kingdom was for etching. William Salmon's ''Polygraphice'' (1673) provides a recipe for varnish used in etching, consisting of three ounces of virgin wax, two ounces of [[mastic (plant resin)|mastic]], and one ounce of asphaltum.<ref name="SalmonPolygraphice">{{cite book|first=William|last=Salmon|year=1673|publisher=R.

Indeed in 1838, there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity over asphalt/bitumen, which had uses beyond paving. For example, asphalt could also used for flooring, damp proofing in buildings, and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths, with these latter themselves proliferating in the 19th century.<ref name="Abraham1938"/><ref name="LewisMiles"/><ref name="Gerhard1908">{{cite book|first=W.M.

=== Early use in the United States ===
The first use of asphalt/bitumen in the New World was by indigenous peoples.  On the west coast, as early as the 13th century, the [[Tongva people|Tongva]], [[Luiseño people|Luiseño]] and [[Chumash people|Chumash]] peoples collected the naturally occurring asphalt/bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits.  All three used the substance as an adhesive.  It is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items. For example, it was used on [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles.  It was also used in decorations.  Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations.  It was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water.  Asphaltum was used also to seal the planks on ocean-going canoes.

Roads in the US have been paved with materials that include asphalt/bitumen since at least 1870, when a street in front of the Newark, NJ City Hall was paved. In many cases, these early pavings were made from naturally occurring "bituminous rock", such as at Ritchie Mines in Macfarlan in [[Ritchie County, West Virginia]] from 1852 to 1873. In 1876, asphalt-based paving was used to pave Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, in time for the celebration of the national centennial.<ref name="NAPA2005">{{cite book|first=Dan |last=McNichol|year=2005| month=| title=Paving the Way: Asphalt in America| edition=|editor= |chapter=| publisher=National Asphalt Pavement Association| location=Lanham, MD |pages= |url=http://store.hotmix.org/index.php?productID=144|isbn=0-914313-04-5}}</ref> Asphalt/bitumen was also used for flooring, paving and waterproofing of baths and swimming pools during the early 20th century, following similar trends in Europe.<ref name="Gerhard1908" />

==Modern use==

[[File:Road repaving.jpg|thumb|The road surface is removed and a new bitumen layer is added]]

=== Rolled asphalt concrete ===
{{main|Asphalt concrete}}
The largest use of asphalt/bitumen is for making [[asphalt concrete]] for road surfaces and accounts for approximately 85% of the asphalt consumed in the [[United States]]. Asphalt concrete pavement material is commonly composed of 5% asphalt/bitumen cement and 95% aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel). Due to its highly viscous nature, asphalt/bitumen cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing plant. There are about 4,000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the U.S., and a similar number in Europe.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Asphalt Paving Industry: A Global Perspective, 2nd Edition | publisher = National Asphalt Pavement Association and European Asphalt Pavement Association | date = February 2011 | year = 2011 | location = Lanham, Maryland, and Brussels | url = http://www.asphaltpavement.org/images/stories/GL_101_Edition_3.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2012-09-27 | isbn = 0-914313-06-1}}</ref>

Asphalt concrete road surface is the most widely recycled material in the U.S., both by gross tonnage and by percentage.  According to an industry survey conducted by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] and the National Asphalt Pavement Association and released in 2011, more than 99% of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements, roadbeds, shoulders and embankments.<ref>{{cite web|title=New FHWA Survey Finds Asphalt Recycling Reaches 99 Percent|url=http://www.asphaltpavement.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=25&Itemid=45|work=Asphalt Pavement Mix Production Survey: 2009-2010|publisher=National Asphalt Pavement Association|accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref>

[[Asphalt shingle|Roofing shingle]]s account for most of the remaining asphalt/bitumen consumption. Other uses include cattle sprays, fence-post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics.

Asphalt concrete paving is widely used in airports around the world. Due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly, it is widely used for runways dedicated to aircraft landing and taking off.

=== Mastic asphalt ===
[[Mastic asphalt]] is a type of asphalt which differs from dense graded asphalt ([[asphalt concrete]]) in that it has a higher asphalt/bitumen ([[binder (material)|binder]]) content, usually around 7–10% of the whole aggregate mix, as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete, which has only around 5% added asphalt/bitumen. This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground.  Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of {{convert|210|°C|°F}} and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about 20 millimeters (0.8&nbsp;in) thick.

=== Asphalt emulsion ===
A number of technologies allow asphalt/bitumen to be mixed at much lower temperatures. These involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form "cutbacks" with reduced melting point, or mixtures with water to turn the asphalt/bitumen into an [[emulsion]]. Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70% asphalt/bitumen and typically less than 1.5% chemical additives. There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, [[cationic]] and [[anionic]]. Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications. [[Chipseal]] involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag. Slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road. Cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements.

===Other uses===
Asphalt/bitumen is used to make [[Japan black]], a [[lacquer]] known especially for its use on iron and steel. Asphalt/bitumen also is used in paint and marker inks by some graffiti supply companies (primarily Molotow) to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint and/or ink, and to make the color much darker.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Asphalt/bitumen is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process.

==Petroleum production, alternatives and bioasphalt ==
{{Main|Peak oil|Global warming|Bioasphalt}}
Naturally occurring crude Asphalt/bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from "[[Oil sands]]", currently under development in Alberta, Canada. Canada has most of the world's supply of natural asphalt/bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres<ref name=oilsands/> (an area larger than England), giving it the second-largest proven [[oil reserves]] in the world. The [[Athabasca oil sands]] is the largest asphalt/bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to [[surface mining]], although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by ''[[in-situ#Petroleum|in situ]]'' methods. Because of [[oil price increases since 2003]], upgrading bitumen to synthetic [[crude oil]] has become highly profitable. As of 2006, Canadian crude asphalt/bitumen production averaged about {{convert|1.1|Moilbbl|m3}} per day and was projected to rise to {{convert|4.4|Moilbbl|m3}} per day by 2020.<ref name="CAPP"/> The total amount of crude asphalt/bitumen in Alberta which could be extracted is estimated to be about {{convert|310|Goilbbl|e9m3|sigfig=1}},<ref>{{cite web

  |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-05-30}}</ref> which at a rate of {{convert|4400000|oilbbl/d}} would last about 200 years.

Certain activist groups have become increasingly concerned about the global [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]] problem in recent years due to byproducts released into the atmosphere. Most of the emissions are derived primarily from burning [[fossil fuel]]s. This has led to the introduction of petroleum alternatives, such as [[bioasphalt]], that are more environmentally friendly and less toxic.

Asphalt/bitumen can now be made from nonpetroleum-based renewable resources such as sugar, [[molasses]] and rice, corn and potato [[starch]]es.  Asphalt/bitumen can also be made from waste material by [[fractional distillation]] of used motor [[oil]]s, which is sometimes disposed by burning or dumping into landfills.  Nonpetroleum-based asphalt/bitumen binders can be made light-colored. Lighter-colored roads absorb less heat from solar radiation, and have less surface heat than darker surfaces, reducing their contribution to the [[urban heat island]] effect.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/heatisland/ Heat Island Effect].
