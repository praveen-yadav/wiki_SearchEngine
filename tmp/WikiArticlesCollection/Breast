The '''breast''' is the upper [[ventral]] region of the [[torso]] of a [[primate]], in left and right sides, containing the [[mammary gland]] which in a [[female]] can secrete [[milk]] used to feed [[infant]]s.

Both [[men]] and [[women]] develop breasts from the same [[embryology|embryological]] tissues. However, at [[puberty]], female [[sex hormone]]s, mainly [[estrogen]], promote breast development which does not occur in men due to the higher amount of [[testosterone]]. As a result, women's breasts become far more prominent than those of men.

During [[pregnancy]], the breast is responsive to a complex interplay of [[hormone]]s that cause tissue development and enlargement in order to produce milk. Three such hormones are estrogen, [[progesterone]] and [[prolactin]], which cause [[glandular tissue]] in the breast and the uterus to change during the menstrual cycle.<ref name=SEER>{{cite web|title=SEER Training: Breast Anatomy|url=http://training.seer.cancer.gov/breast/anatomy/|publisher=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref>

Each breast contains 15–20 [[lobe (anatomy)|lobes]]. The [[subcutaneous adipose tissue]] covering the lobes gives the breast its size and shape. Each lobe is composed of many lobules, at the end of which are sacs where milk is produced in response to hormonal signals.<ref name="SEER"/>

== Etymology ==
The English word ''breast'' derives from the [[Old English]] word ''brēost'' (breast, bosom) from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''breustam'' (breast), from the Proto-Indo-European base '''bhreus–''' (to swell, to sprout).<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/PokornyMaster-X.html Indo-European Lexicon: Pokorny Master PIE Etyma].

=== Morphology ===
The human breast has two aspects: the functional aspect and the anatomic aspect.

====The functional breast====
The breast is an [[Apocrine|apocrine gland]] that produces [[Human breast milk|milk]] to feed an infant child; for which the [[nipple]] of the breast is centred in (surrounded by) an [[areola]] (nipple-areola complex, NAC), the skin color of which varies from pink to dark brown, and has many [[sebaceous gland]]s. The basic units of the breast are the [[terminal duct lobular unit]]s (TDLUs), which produce the fatty breast milk. They give the breast its offspring-feeding functions as a [[mammary gland]]. They are distributed throughout the body of the breast; approximately two-thirds of the lactiferous tissue is within 30&nbsp;mm of the base of the nipple. The [[lactiferous duct|terminal lactiferous ducts]] drain the milk from TDLUs into 4–18 lactiferous ducts, which drain to the nipple; the milk-glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in a [[Lactation|lactating]] woman, and 1:1 in a non-lactating woman. In addition to the milk glands, the breast also is composed of [[connective tissue]]s ([[collagen]], [[elastin]]), [[adipose tissue|white fat]], and the suspensory [[Cooper's ligaments]]. Sensation in the breast is provided by the [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nervous system innervation]], by means of the front (anterior) and side (lateral) cutaneous branches of the fourth-, the fifth-, and the sixth [[intercostal nerves]], while the T-4 nerve ([[Thoracic spinal nerve 4]]), which innervates the [[dermatomic area]], supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.<ref name="Tortora, Gerard J.">Introduction to the Human Body, Fifth Edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.: New York, 2001. '''560'''.</ref><ref name="Ramsay">{{cite journal |author=Ramsay DT, Kent JC, Hartmann RA, Hartmann PE |title=Anatomy of the Lactating Human Breast Redefined with Ultrasound Imaging |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=206 |issue=6 |pages=525–534 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15960763 |pmc=1571528 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7580.2005.00417.x |url=}}</ref>

====The anatomic breast====
In women, the breasts overlay the [[pectoralis major muscle]]s and usually extend from the level of the second rib to the level of the sixth rib in the front of the [[human rib cage]]; thus, the breasts cover much of the chest area and the chest walls. At the front of the chest, the breast tissue can extend from the [[clavicle]] (collarbone) to the middle of the [[sternum]] (breastbone). At the sides of the chest, the breast tissue can extend into the [[axilla]] (armpit), and can reach as far to the back as the [[latissimus dorsi muscle]], extending from the lower back to the [[humerus]] bone (the longest bone of the upper arm). As a [[mammary gland]], the breast is an inhomogeneous anatomic structure composed of layers of different types of [[Histology|tissue]], among which predominate two types, [[adipose tissue]] and [[Lactiferous duct|glandular tissue]], which effects the [[lactation]] functions of the breasts.

[[Morphology (biology)|Morphologically]], the breast is a cone with the base at the chest wall, and the apex at the nipple, the center of the NAC (nipple-areola complex). The superﬁcial tissue layer ([[superficial fascia]]) is separated from the skin by 0.5–2.5&nbsp;cm of subcutaneous fat (adipose tissue). The [[Cooper's ligaments|suspensory Cooper's ligaments]] are fibrous-tissue prolongations that radiate from the superficial fascia to the skin envelope. The adult breast contains 14–18 irregular lactiferous lobes that converge to the nipple, to ducts 2.0–4.5&nbsp;mm in diameter; the milk ducts ([[lactiferous duct]]s) are immediately surrounded with dense connective tissue that functions as a support framework. The [[gland]]ular tissue of the breast is biochemically supported with [[estrogen]]; thus, when a woman reaches [[menopause]] (cessation of menstruation) and her body estrogen levels decrease, the milk gland tissue then atrophies, withers, and disappears, resulting in a breast composed of adipose tissue, superﬁcial fascia, suspensory ligaments, and the skin envelope.

The dimensions and weight of the breast vary among women, ranging from approximately 500 to 1,000 grams (1.1 to 2.2 pounds) each; thus, a small-to-medium-sized breast weighs 500&nbsp;grams (1.1 pounds) or less; and a large breast weighs approximately 750 to 1,000 grams (1.7 to 2.2 pounds.)  The tissue composition ratios of the breast likewise vary among women; some breasts have greater proportions of glandular tissue than of [[adipose tissue|adipose]] or [[connective tissue|connective]] tissues, and vice versa; therefore the fat-to-connective-tissue ratio determines the density (firmness) of the breast. In the course of a woman's life, her breasts will change size, shape, and weight, because of the hormonal bodily changes occurred in [[thelarche]] (pubertal breast development), [[menstruation]] (fertility), [[pregnancy]] (reproduction), the [[Lactation|breast-feeding]] of an infant child, and the [[menopause|climacterium]] (the end of fertility).<ref>Pamplona DC, de Abreu Alvim C. Breast Reconstruction with Expanders and Implants: a Numerical Analysis. Artiﬁcial Organs 8 (2004), pp. 353–356.</ref><ref>Grassley JS. Breast Reduction Surgery: What every Woman Needs to Know. Lifelines 6 (2002), pp. 244–249.</ref>

=== Lymphatic drainage ===
Approximately 75% of the [[lymph]] from the breast travels to the [[Wiktionary:ipsilateral|ipsilateral]] (same-side) axillary [[lymph node]]s, whilst 25% of the lymph travels to the parasternal nodes (beside the sternum bone), to the other breast, and to the abdominal lymph nodes. The axillary lymph nodes include the pectoral (chest), subscapular (under the scapula), and humeral (humerus-bone area) lymph-node groups, which drain to the central [[axillary lymph nodes]] and to the apical axillary lymph nodes. The lymphatic drainage of the breasts is especially relevant to [[oncology]], because [[breast cancer]] is a cancer common to the mammary gland, and [[cancer]] cells can [[Metastasis|metastasize]] (break away) from a [[tumour]] and be dispersed to other parts of the woman's body by means of the lymphatic system.

=== Shape and support ===
[[File:Weibliche brust en.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The topography of the breasts indicate the glandular body, the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and the inframammary fold (IMF).]]
The [[Morphology (biology)|morphologic]] variations in the size, shape, volume, [[Histology|tissue]] density, pectoral locale, and spacing of the breasts determine their natural shape, appearance, and configuration upon the chest of a woman; yet such features do not indicate its mammary-gland composition (fat-to-milk-gland ratio), nor the potential for [[lactation|nursing]] an infant child.<ref name=jelovsek>{{cite web |url=http://www.wdxcyber.com/nbreast3.htm |title=Breast Asymmetry—When Does it Need Treatment? |first=Frederick R. |last=Jelovsek |accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref><ref name=goddard>{{cite web|last=Goddard|first=Kay|title=I May Have Been the Ultimo Bra Girl, but One of my Breasts was a B-cup and the other was a D |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1384595/Katie-Green-I-Ultimo-bra-girl-I-suffered-breast-asymmetry.html|publisher=The Daily Mail|date=10 May 2011|accessdate=18 May 2011}}</ref> The size and the shape of the breasts are influenced by normal-life [[hormone|hormonal]] changes ([[thelarche]], [[menstruation]], [[pregnancy]], [[menopause]]) and medical conditions (e.g. [[virginal breast hypertrophy]]).<ref name=wood>{{cite journal |author=Wood K, Cameron M, Fitzgerald K |title=Breast Size, Bra Fit and Thoracic Pain in Young Women: A Correlational Study |journal=Chiropractic & Osteopathy |volume=16 |issue= |page=1 |year=2008 |pmid=18339205 |pmc=2275741|doi=10.1186/1746-1340-16-1}}</ref> The shape of the breasts is naturally determined by the support of the suspensory [[Cooper's ligaments]], the underlying muscle and bone structures of the chest, and the skin envelope. The suspensory ligaments sustain the breast from the clavicle (collarbone) and the clavico-pectoral fascia (collarbone and chest), by traversing and encompassing the fat and milk-gland tissues, the breast is positioned, affixed to, and supported upon the chest wall, while its shape is established and maintained by the skin envelope.

The base of each breast is attached to the chest by the deep fascia over the [[pectoralis major muscle]]s. The space between the breast and the pectoralis major muscle is called [[retromammary space]] and gives mobility to the breast. Some breasts are mounted high upon the chest wall, are of rounded shape, and project almost horizontally from the chest, which features are common to girls and women in the early stages of [[Thelarche|thelarchic]] development, the sprouting of the breasts. In the high-breast configuration, the dome-shaped and the cone-shaped breast is affixed to the chest at the base, and the weight is evenly distributed over the base area. In the low-breast configuration, a proportion of the breast weight is supported by the chest, against which rests the lower surface of the breast, thus is formed the [[inframammary fold]] (IMF). Because the base is deeply affixed to the chest, the weight of the breast is distributed over a greater area, and so reduces the weight-bearing strain upon the chest, shoulder, and back muscles that bear the weight of the bust.

The chest ([[thoracic cavity]]) progressively slopes outwards from the thoracic inlet (atop the [[Human breastbone|breastbone]]) and above to the lowest ribs that support the breasts. The inframammary fold, where the lower portion of the breast meets the chest, is an anatomic feature created by the adherence of the breast skin and the underlying connective tissues of the chest; the IMF is the lower-most extent of the anatomic breast. In the course of thelarche, some girls develop breasts the lower skin-envelope of which touches the chest below the IMF, and some girls do not; both breast anatomies are statistically normal morphologic variations of the size and shape of women's breasts.<ref name="Boutros_S">{{cite journal |author=Boutros S, Kattash M, Wienfeld A, Yuksel E, Baer S, Shenaq S |title=The Intradermal Anatomy of the Inframammary Fold |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=1030–1033 |year=1998 |month=September |pmid=9734420 |doi= 10.1097/00006534-199809040-00017|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&volume=102&issue=4&spage=1030}}</ref>

====Size====
Breast size varies with race and ethnic origin. A study released in 2013 suggests the existence of a single genetic mutation responsible for multiple characteristics of [[East Asians]], including thicker hair, more sweat glands and smaller breasts on women.<ref name="gene">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/science/studying-recent-human-evolution-at-the-genetic-level.html?_r=0|title=East Asian Physical Traits Linked to 35,000-Year-Old Mutation}}</ref>

The basic [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] structure of the human breast – female and male – is determined during the [[prenatal development]] stage. For a girl in [[puberty]], during [[thelarche]] (the breast-development stage), the female [[sex hormone]]s (principally [[estrogen]]s) promote the sprouting, growth, and development of the breasts, in the course of which, as [[mammary gland]]s, they grow in size and volume, and usually rest on her chest; these development stages of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s (breasts, pubic hair, etc.) are illustrated in the five-stage [[Tanner stage|Tanner Scale]].<ref name="A.R.Greenbaum">{{cite journal |author=Greenbaum AR, Heslop T, Morris J, Dunn KW |title=An Investigation of the Suitability of Bra fit in Women Referred for Reduction Mammaplasty |journal=British Journal of Plastic Surgery |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=230–6 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12859918 |doi=10.1016/S0007-1226(03)00122-X |url=}}</ref> During thelarche, the developing breasts sometimes are of unequal size, and usually the left breast is slightly larger; said condition of asymmetry is transitory and statistically normal to female physical and sexual development.<ref name="asymmetry">{{cite journal

=== Asymmetry ===
Approximately two years after the onset of [[puberty]] (a girl's first [[menstrual cycle]]), the hormone [[estrogen]] stimulates the development and growth of the [[mammary gland|glandular]], [[Adipose tissue|fat]], and [[Cooper's ligaments|suspensory]] tissues that compose the breast. This continues for approximately four years{{clarify|date=May 2012}} until establishing the final shape of the breast (size, volume, density) when she is a woman of approximately 21 years of age.<ref name=goddard/>
About 90% of women's breasts are asymmetrical to some degree,<ref name=goddard/> either in size, volume, or relative position upon the chest.  Asymmetry can be manifested in the size of the breast, the position of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), the angle of the breast, and the position of the [[inframammary fold]], where the breast meets the chest.

For about 5%<ref name=goddard/> to 10%<ref name=losken/> women, their breasts are severely different, with the left breast being larger in 62% of cases.<ref name=losken>{{cite journal |author=Losken A, Fishman I, Denson DD, Moyer HR, Carlson GW |title=An objective evaluation of breast symmetry and shape differences using 3-dimensional images|journal=Annals  of Plastic Surgery |volume=55 |issue=6 |pages=571–5 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16327452|doi=10.1097/01.sap.0000185459.49434.5f}}</ref> This is due to the breast proximity to the heart and a greater number of arteries and veins, along with a protective layer of fat surrounding the heart located beneath it.<ref name=iven>{{cite web |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2145518/Lifes-balancing-act-youve-uneven-bosom.html#ixzz1v8svz89z |title=Life's a balancing act when you've an uneven bosom|first=Sarah |last=Ivens| date=16 May 2012 |accessdate=17 May 2012 |publisher=DailyMail.uk }}</ref> Up to 25% of women experience notable breast asymmetry of at least one cup size difference.<ref name="jelovsek"/><ref name=goddard/><ref name=gayne>{{cite web|url=http://www.menstrual-cycle.info/137-Breast-asymmetry.html |title=Breast Asymmetry | first=Gayane |last= Dolya | accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mgh.harvard.edu/children/adolescenthealth/articles/aa_breast_development.aspx | title=Breast Development |publisher= Massachusetts Hospital for Children | accessdate=2010-06-02| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/61Cnr19RG | archivedate = 25 August 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.embarrassingissues.co.uk/AsymmetricBreasts.html | title=Asymmetric Breasts | accessdate=29 April 2013| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/61Cnsk0jc | archivedate = 25 August 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref>

If a woman is uncomfortable with her breasts' asymmetry, she can minimize the difference with a corrective bra<ref name=iven/> or use gel bra inserts.<ref name=iven/>  Alternatively, she can seek a surgical solution. Options include a minimally invasive procedure known as [[fat transfer|platelet injection fat transfer]], which transfers fat cells from a woman's thighs to her smaller breast.<ref name="goddard"/> More invasive procedures include corrective [[mammoplasty]], such as [[mastopexy]], [[breast reduction plasty]], or [[breast augmentation]], depending on the nature of the asymmetry.<ref name=goddard/><ref name=losken>{{cite journal | author=Losken A, Fishman I, Denson DD, Moyer HR, Carlson GW | title=An Objective Evaluation of Breast Symmetry and Shape Differences using 3-dimensional Images | journal=Annals  of Plastic Surgery | volume=55 | issue=6 |pages=571–575 | year=2005 | month=December | pmid=16327452 |doi=10.1097/01.sap.0000185459.49434.5f}}</ref>  Most surgeons will only perform an augmentation procedure to treat asymmetry if the woman's breasts differ by at least one cup size.<ref name=goddard/>

=== Hormonal change ===
[[File:Stretch marks on female breast.jpg|thumb|upright|On the skin envelope of the breast, stretch marks may indicate the relative-size increments and decrements occurred during the life of the woman.]]
Because the breasts are principally composed of [[adipose tissue]], which surrounds the [[mammary gland|milk glands]], their sizes and volumes fluctuate according to the hormonal changes particular to [[thelarche]] (sprouting of breasts), [[menstruation]] (egg production), [[pregnancy]] (reproduction), [[lactation]] (feeding of offspring), and [[menopause]] (end of menstruation). For example, during the [[menstruation|menstrual cycle]], the breasts are enlarged by [[premenstrual water retention]]; during pregnancy the breasts become enlarged and denser (firmer) because of the [[prolactin]]-caused organ [[hypertrophy]], which begins the production of [[Human breast milk|breast milk]], increases the size of the nipples, and darkens the skin color of the nipple-areola complex; these changes continue during the [[lactation]] and the [[breastfeeding]] periods. Afterwards, the breasts generally revert to their pre-pregnancy size, shape, and volume, yet might present stretch marks and breast ptosis. At [[menopause]], the breasts can decrease in size when the levels of circulating [[estrogen]] decline, followed by the withering of the adipose tissue and the milk glands. Additional to such natural biochemical stimuli, the breasts can become enlarged consequent to an [[Adverse effect|adverse side effect]] of [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s; and the size of the breasts can also increase and decrease in response to the [[body weight]] fluctuations of the woman. Moreover, the physical changes occurred to the breasts often are recorded in the [[stretch marks]] of the skin envelope; they can serve as historical indicators of the increments and the decrements of the size and the volume of a woman's breasts throughout the course of her life.

=== Breast ptosis ===
{{Main|Ptosis (breasts)}}
[[File:Stades de affaissement.png|thumb| The seven stages of breast ptosis.]]
Ptosis is a normal consequence of aging<ref name=rodriguez/> where the breast tissue sags lower on the chest and the nipple points downward.<ref>{{cite web|last=Younai|first=S. Sean|title=Breast Sagging – Ptosis|url=http://www.beautifulself.com/breastlift_ptosis.htm|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref> The rate at which a woman develops ptosis depends on many factors including genetics, smoking, [[body mass index]],  [[gravidity|number of pregnancies]], the size of breasts before pregnancy, and age.<ref>{{cite web|last=Campolongo|first=Marianne|title=What Causes Sagging Breasts?|url=http://www.newimage.com/resource-center/sagging-breasts.html|accessdate=26 January 2012|date=5 December 2007}}</ref>

[[Plastic surgeons]] categorize ptosis by evaluating the position of the [[nipple]] relative to the [[inframammary crease]] (where the underside of the breast meets the chest wall). This is determined by measuring from the center of the nipple to the [[suprasternal notch|sternal notch]] (at the top of the breast bone) to gauge how far the nipple has fallen. The standard [[Anthropometry|anthropometric]] measurement for young women is {{convert|21|cm}}.  This measurement is used to assess both breast ptosis and breast symmetry. The surgeon will assess the breast's angle of projection. The apex of the breast, which includes the nipple, can have a flat angle of projection (180 degrees) or acute angle of projection (greater than 180 degrees). The apex rarely has an angle greater than 60 degrees. The angle of the breast apex is partly determined by the tautness of the suspensory [[Cooper's ligaments]]. For example, when a woman lies on her back, the angle of the breast apex becomes a flat, obtuse angle (less than 180 degrees) while the base-to-length ratio of the breast ranges from 0.5 to 1.0.<ref name=rodriguez>{{cite web|title=Breast Lift Procedure|url=http://www.cosmeticsurg.net/procedures/breast-lift/|publisher=Ricardo L.

== Functions and health ==

=== Lactation ===
{{Main|Breastfeeding}}
[[File:breastfeeding infant.jpg|thumb|upright|The functional breast nourishing an infant girl.]]
The primary function of the breasts – as  [[mammary gland]]s – is the feeding and the nourishing of an infant child with [[breast milk]] during the maternal [[lactation]] period. The round shape of the breast helps to limit the loss of maternal body heat, because milk production depends upon a higher-temperature environment for the proper, milk-production function of the mammary gland tissues, the [[lactiferous ducts]]. Regarding the shape of the breast, the study ''The Evolution of the Human Beast'' (2001) proposed that the rounded shape of a woman's breast evolved to prevent the sucking infant offspring from suffocating while feeding at the teat; that is, because of the human infant's small jaw, which did not project from the face to reach the [[nipple]], he or she might block the [[Nose|nostrils]] against the mother's breast if it were of a flatter form (cf. [[chimpanzee]]); theoretically, as the human jaw receded into the face, the woman's body compensated with round breasts.<ref name="Bentley">{{cite journal|last=Bentley|first=Gillian R.|year=2001|title=The Evolution of the Human Breast|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=32|issue=38|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1033|page=30}}</ref>

In a woman, the condition of lactation unrelated to pregnancy can occur as [[galactorrhea]] (spontaneous milk flow), and because of the [[adverse effect]]s of drugs (e.g. [[Antipsychotic|antipsychotic medications]]), of extreme physical stress, and of [[endocrine]] disorders. In a newborn infant, the capability of lactation is consequence of the mother's circulating hormones ([[prolactin]], [[oxytocin]], etc.) in his or her blood stream, which were introduced by the shared circulatory system of the [[placenta]]. In men, the mammary glands are also present in the body, but normally remain undeveloped because of the hormone [[testosterone]], however, when [[male lactation]] occurs, it is considered a pathological symptom of a disorder of the [[pituitary gland]].

=== Reproduction ===
In considering the human animal, [[Zoology|zoologists]] proposed that the human female is the only [[primate]] that possesses permanent, full-form breasts when not pregnant. Other mammalian females develop full breasts only when pregnant. The zoologist [[Desmond Morris]] proposed that the rounded shape of a woman's breasts evolved as frontal, [[secondary sex characteristic]] that is a sexual-attraction counterpart to the [[buttocks]], and so encouraged frontal copulation, the reason being that while other primates mate by means of the [[doggy-style|rear-entry]] position, the upright, bipedal human being was likelier to successfully [[copulate]] face to face in the [[missionary position]].

As an [[Ethology|ethologist]], Morris further proposed that breasts, a secondary sex characteristic located on the woman's chest, encouraged face-to-face sexual intercourse that led to the establishment of an emotional bond between man and woman; social progress from an essentially procreational function of human biology.<ref name="NakedApe">Morris (1967), pp. 64–68.</ref> Furthermore, the [[Fluctuating asymmetry|symmetry]] of the breasts, and the general symmetry of the human body, influence what men and women consider [[physical attractiveness]] in a mate with whom to reproduce. Bodily [[beauty]], [[evolutionary psychology]] proposes that a symmetrical body signals good genetic health to a potential mate and so is the product of a [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] stable line of people who physically developed without interference from disease. Therefore, because the breasts are especially sensitive to developmental interference (genetic and environmental), breast symmetry indicates a woman of good health and thus of good breeding stock, who shall successfully bear more (surviving) children than will a woman with asymmetrical breasts.<ref>{{cite doi|10.3390/sym2021081 }}</ref>

=== Mammary diseases ===
{{Main|Breast disease}}

The breast is susceptible to numerous benign and malignant conditions. The most frequent benign conditions are [[puerperal mastitis]], [[fibrocystic breast changes]] and [[mastalgia]]. [[Breast cancer]] is one of the leading causes of death among women.

== Cultural aspects ==

=== Anthropomorphic geography ===
{{Main|Breast-shaped hill}}
There are many mountains named after the breast because they resemble it in appearance and so are objects of religious and ancestral veneration as a [[fertility symbol]] and of well-being. In Asia, there was "Breast Mountain", which had a cave where the [[Buddhist monk]] [[Bodhidharma]] (Da Mo) spent much time in [[meditation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usashaolintemple.org/chanbuddhism-history/ |title=The Story of Bodhidharma |publisher=Usashaolintemple.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref> Other such breast mountains are [[Mount Elgon]] on the [[Uganda]]-[[Kenya]] border, [[Lochnagar|Beinn Chìochan]] and the [[Maiden Paps, Caithness|Maiden Paps]] in [[Scotland]], the "Bundok ng Susong Dalaga" (Maiden's breast mountains) in [[Talim Island]], Philippines, the twin hills known as the [[Paps of Anu]] (''Dá Chích Anann'' or the breasts of [[Anann|Anu]]), near [[Killarney]] in [[Ireland]], the 2,086&nbsp;m high ''Tetica de Bacares'' or "La Tetica" in the [[Sierra de Los Filabres]], [[Spain]], and [[Khao Nom Sao]] in [[Thailand]], [[Cerro Las Tetas]] in [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Aphrodite|Breasts of Aphrodite]] in Mykonos, among many others. In the United States, the [[Teton Range]] is named after the French word for "breast".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/grte/grte_geology/sec1.htm |title=Creation of the Teton Landscape: The Geologic Story of Grand Teton National Park (The Story Begins) |publisher=U.S. National Park Service |date=Last updated 19 January 2007 |accessdate=2011-09-23 }}</ref>

=== Art history ===
[[File:Snake Goddess Crete 1600BC.jpg|thumb|upright|A Cretan [[Snake Goddess]] from the  [[Minoan Civilization]], ca. 1600&nbsp;BC.]]
In European pre-historic societies, sculptures of female figures with pronounced or highly exaggerated breasts were common. A typical example is the so-called [[Venus of Willendorf]], one of many [[Paleolithic]] [[Venus figurines]] with ample hips and bosom. Artifacts such as bowls, rock carvings and sacred statues with breasts have been recorded from 15,000&nbsp;BC up to late antiquity all across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Many female deities representing love and fertility were associated with breasts and breast milk. Figures of the Phoenician goddess [[Astarte]] were represented as pillars studded with breasts. [[Isis]], an Egyptian goddess who represented, among many other things, ideal motherhood, was often portrayed as suckling [[pharaohs]], thereby confirming their divine status as rulers. Even certain male deities representing regeneration and fertility were occasionally depicted with breast-like appendices, such as the river god [[Hapy]] who was considered to be responsible for the annual overflowing of the [[Nile]]. Female breasts were also prominent in the [[Minoan civilization]] in the form of the famous [[Snake Goddess]] statuettes. In [[Ancient Greece]] there were several cults worshipping the "Kourotrophos", the suckling mother, represented by goddesses such as [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Hera]] and [[Artemis]]. The worship of deities symbolized by the female breast in Greece became less common during the first millennium. The popular adoration of female goddesses decreased significantly during the rise of the Greek city states, a legacy which was passed on to the later [[Roman Empire]].<ref>Yalom (1998) pp. 9–16; see Eva Keuls (1993), ''Reign of the Phallus: Sexual Politics in Ancient Athens'' for a detailed study of male-dominant rule in ancient Greece.</ref>

During the middle of the first millennium BC, Greek culture experienced a gradual change in the perception of female breasts. Women in art were covered in clothing from the neck down, including female goddesses like [[Athena]], the patron of Athens who represented heroic endeavor. There were exceptions: [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love, was more frequently portrayed fully nude, though in postures that were intended to portray shyness or modesty, a portrayal that has been compared to modern [[Pin-up|pin ups]] by historian [[Marilyn Yalom]].<ref>Yalom (1998), p. 18.</ref> Although nude men were depicted standing upright, most depictions of female nudity in Greek art occurred "usually with drapery near at hand and with a forward-bending, self-protecting posture".<ref>Hollander (1993), p. 6.</ref> A popular legend at the time was of the [[Amazons]], a tribe of fierce female warriors who socialized with men only for procreation and even removed one breast to become better warriors (the idea being that the right breast would interfere with the operation of a bow and arrow). The legend was a popular motif in art during Greek and Roman antiquity and served as an antithetical cautionary tale.

Many women regard their breasts, which are female [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, as important to their [[sexual attractiveness]], as a sign of [[femininity]] that is important to their [[Self-concept|sense of self]].{{citation needed|date= July 2012}} So, when a  woman considers her breasts deficient in some respect, she might choose to undergo a plastic surgery procedure to enhance them, either to have them [[Breast augmentation|augmented]] or to have them [[Breast reduction plasty|reduced]], or to have them [[reconstructive surgery|reconstructed]] if she suffered a deformative disease, such as [[breast cancer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sexarchive.info/ATLAS_EN/html/secondary_characteristics.html |title=Secondary sex characteristics |publisher=.hu-berlin.de |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref> After [[mastectomy]] (the removal of a diseased breast), the reconstruction of the breast or breasts is done with [[breast implants]] or autologous tissue transfer, using fat and tissues from the abdomen, which is performed with a [[TRAM flap]] or with a back (latissiumus muscle flap). [[Breast reduction plasty|Breast reduction]] surgery is a procedure that involves removing excess breast tissue, fat, and skin, and the repositioning of the nipple-areola complex.

Cosmetic improvement procedures include breast lift ([[mastopexy]]), [[breast augmentation]] with implants, and combination procedures; the two types of available [[breast implant]]s are models filled with [[silicone|silicone gel]], and models filled with [[Saline (medicine)|saline solution]]. These types of breast surgery can also repair [[inverted nipple]]s by releasing [[Lactiferous duct|milk duct]] tissues that have become tethered. Furthermore, in the case of the [[Obesity|obese]] woman, a breast lift (mastopexy) procedure, with or without a breast volume reduction, can be part of an upper-body lift and contouring for the woman who has undergone massive body weight loss.

Surgery of the breast presents the health risk of interfering with the ability to breast-feed an infant child, and might include consequences such as altered sensation in the nipple-areola complex, interference with [[mammography]] (breast x-rays images) when there are breast implants present in the breasts. Regarding breast-feeding capability after breast reduction surgery, studies reported that women who underwent breast reduction can retain the ability to nurse an infant child, when compared to women in a control group who underwent breast surgery using a modern pedicle surgical technique.<ref name="Neifert">{{cite journal | last=Neifert | first=M | coauthors=DeMarzo S, Seacat J, Young D, Leff M, Orleans M | title=The influence of breast surgery, breast appearance and pregnancy-induced changes on lactation sufficiency as measured by infant weight gain | journal=Birth | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=31–38 | year=1990 | pmid=2288566 | doi=10.1111/j.1523-536X.1990.tb00007.x }}</ref><ref name="LLLsurgery">{{cite web | title=FAQ on Previous Breast Surgery and Breastfeeding | publisher=La Leche League International | date=29 August 2006 | url=http://www.lalecheleague.org/faq/surgery.html | accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref><ref name="DianaWest">{{cite web | last=West | first=Diana | title=Breastfeeding After Breast Surgery | publisher=Australian Breastfeeding Association | url =https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bfinfo/breastfeeding-after-breast-surgery | accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref><ref name="Korchin">{{cite journal |author=Cruz-Korchin N, Korchin L |title=Breast-feeding after vertical mammaplasty with medial pedicle |journal=Plast.

Because breasts are mostly fatty tissue, their shape can within limits be molded by clothing, such as [[foundation garment]]s. [[brassiere|Bras]] are commonly worn by about 90% of Western women,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1stbras.com/Bra_Cup_Sizes.html|title=Bra Cup Sizes—getting fitted with the right size|publisher=1stbras.com|accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liv.com/right_bra.php|title=The Right Bra|publisher=Liv.com|accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/breast-supporting-act-a-century-of-the-bra-461656.html|title=Breast supporting act: a century of the bra|date=15 August 2007|publisher=The Independent UK|accessdate=11 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref> and are often worn for support.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2275741/?tool=pmcentrez Breast size, bra fit and thoracic pain in young women: a correlational study] Retrieved 5 January 2012</ref> The [[social norm]] in most [[Western culture]]s is to cover breasts in public, though the extent of coverage varies depending on the social context.

Many cultures associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts as [[modesty|immodest]] or [[decency|indecent]]. In some cultures, like the [[Himba people|Himba]] in northern [[Namibia]],  bare-breasted women are the social norm, while a woman's thigh is highly sexualised and not exposed in public. In a few [[Western world|Western countries]] female [[toplessness]] at a beach is acceptable, although it may not be acceptable in the town center. In some areas, exposing a woman's breasts applies only to the exposure of [[nipple]]s.

In the United States, women who [[History of breastfeeding#Breastfeeding in public|breast-feed]] in public can receive negative attention. There have been instances where women have been asked to leave public venues. In New York, the [[topfreedom]] equality movement helped to bring a case, ''People v. Santorelli'' (1992), to the New York State Court of Appeals. They  ruled that New York's indecent exposure laws did not apply to a bare-breasted woman. Other (gender equality) efforts succeeded in most of Canada in the 1990s. Bare-breasted women are legal and culturally acceptable at public beaches in Australia and much of Europe.

=== Sexual characteristic ===
{{See also|Mammary intercourse|Breast fetishism|Stimulation of nipples}}
In some cultures breasts play a role in [[human sexual activity]]. Breasts and especially the nipple are one of a woman's [[erogenous zone]]s. They are sensitive to the touch as they have many nerve endings; and it is common to press or [[massage]] them with hands or [[stimulation of nipples|orally]] before or during sexual activity. Some women can achieve an [[orgasm]] from such activities. Research has suggested that the sensations are genital orgasms caused by nipple stimulation, and may also be directly linked to "the genital area of the brain".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Levay|first=Simon|coauthors=Sharon McBride Valente|title=Human Sexuality, Second Edition|publisher = Sinauer Associates, Inc.|date=15 November 2005|isbn =978-0-87893-465-2}}</ref><ref name="Komisaruk">{{Cite journal|author=Komisaruk, B.
