{{nihongo|'''''Doraemon'''''|ドラえもん|Doraemon}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series created by [[Fujiko Fujio]], which later became an [[anime]] series and an Asian [[Media franchise|franchise]]. The series is about a [[Robot|robotic cat]] named Doraemon, who [[time travel|travels back in time]] from the 22nd century to aid a pre-teen boy called {{nihongo|Nobita Nobi|野比 のび太|Nobi Nobita}}.

The series first appeared in December 1969, when it was published simultaneously in six different magazines. A total of 1,344 stories were created in the original series, which are published by [[Shogakukan]] under the {{nihongo|Tentōmushi|てんとう虫}} manga brand, extending to forty-five volumes. The volumes are collected in the Takaoka Central Library in Toyama, Japan, where Fujiko Fujio was born. [[Turner Broadcasting System]] bought the rights to the Doraemon anime series in the mid-1980s for a [[United States|US]] English-language release,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jref.com/japan/travel/prefectures/kanagawa/doraemon_museum.shtml |title=Fujiko F. Fujio Museum |publisher=Japan Reference |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}</ref> but canceled it without explanation before broadcasting any episodes. In July 2013 it was announced that the manga would be released digitally in English via the [[Amazon Kindle]] [[e-book]] service.<ref>http://mangacomicsmanga.com/sdcc-2013-kids-manga-fave-doraemon-to-be-published-in-english/</ref>

Most of Doraemon episodes are comedies with lessons regarding values such as honesty, perseverance, courage, and respect. Various environmental issues are often visited, including [[Abandoned pets|homeless animals]], [[global warming]], [[endangered species]], [[deforestation]], and [[pollution]]. Miscellaneous educational topics such as [[dinosaur]]s, the [[flat Earth theory]], [[wormhole]] traveling, [[Gulliver's Travels]], and the [[history of Japan]] are often covered.

Awards for "Doraemon"  include the [[Japan Cartoonists Association Award]] for excellence in 1973, the first [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for [[Children's anime and manga|children's manga]] in 1982,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html | title=小学館漫画賞: 歴代受賞者 | publisher=Shogakukan | language=Japanese | accessdate=August 19, 2007}}</ref> and the first [[Osamu Tezuka Culture Award]] in 1997. In March 2008 [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japan's Foreign Ministry]] appointed Doraemon as the nation's first "anime ambassador."<ref>Yamaguchi, Mari.

March 15, 2008.</ref> The Foreign Ministry action confirms that Doraemon has come to be considered a Japanese cultural icon. In 2002 the anime character was acclaimed as an "Asian Hero" in a special feature survey conducted by ''[[Time Asia]]'' magazine.<ref>Iyer, Pico.

==Name==
The name "Doraemon" can be translated roughly to "stray." Unusually, the name {{Nihongo|"Doraemon"|ドラえもん}} is written in a mixture of two Japanese scripts: [[Katakana]] (ドラ) and [[Hiragana]] (えもん). "Dora" derives from "dora neko" (brazen or stray cat, どら猫), and is a corruption of ''nora'' (stray). "Emon" 衛門、右衛門 is a component of male given names like Goemon, though no longer as popular as in the past. "Dora" is not derived from ''dora'' 銅鑼, meaning gong, but due to the homophony, the series puns on this, with Doraemon loving [[dorayaki]].

==Plot==
{{main|List of Doraemon characters}}
[[File:Doraemon first appearance.jpg|thumb|300px|The first appearance of Doraemon, who came via the time machine.]]
[[File:多啦A夢臨別大雄的晚上.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[List of Doraemon characters|Nobita Nobi and Doraemon]].]]

Doraemon is sent back in time by a young boy named Sewashi Nobi to improve the circumstances of his great grandfather, [[Nobita Nobi|Nobita]], so that his descendants may enjoy a better future. In the original timeline, Nobita experienced nothing but misery and misfortune manifested in the form of poor grades and bullying throughout his life. This culminates in the burning down of a future business he sets up which leaves his family line beset with financial problems. In order to alter history and better the Nobi family's fortunes, Sewashi initially wanted to send a super-robot to protect Nobita, but with his meager allowance he could only afford an imperfectly-made factory-rejected toy: an anthropomorphic robot cat called Doraemon.

Doraemon has a pocket from which he produces gadgets, medicines, and tools from the future. The pocket is called yōjigen-pocket (literally "fourth-dimensional pocket"). Some of the gadgets (dōgu) are based on real Japanese household devices with fanciful twists, but most are completely [[science fiction]] (although some may be based on folklore or religious stories). Thousands of dōgu have been featured in ''Doraemon''." The number of gadgets has been approximated at 4,500. It is this constant variety which makes ''Doraemon'' popular both among children and among adults. In the series, the availability of dōgu sometimes depends on the money Doraemon has available, and he often says some dōgu are expensive in the future. The more famous ones include the "[[bamboo-copter]]" (which is very similar to the one that appears on the older series of [[Beany and Cecil]]), a small head accessory that allows flight; the "Anywhere Door," a door that opens up to any place the user wishes; and the "Time Machine." Some of the recurring dōgu also appear in [[Fujiko Fujio|Fujiko F. Fujio]]'s other works, including  ''21-emon'', ''[[Kaibutsu-kun]]'', ''[[Kiteretsu Daihyakka]]'', ''Mikio to Mikio,'' and ''[[Pāman]].''

Although he can hear perfectly well, Doraemon has no ears: his robotic ears were eaten by some robotic mice, giving him a series-long [[fear of mice|phobia]] of the creatures.

The only main female character is Shizuka Minamoto, who serves as a friendly and romantic interest for Nobita. Shizuka is intelligent and is Nobita's best and closest friend, and loves him second most (after her parents). Nobita's main enemies are Takeshi (nicknamed "Gian," from the English word [[wikt:giant|giant]]), a consummate bully; and Suneo, who is cunning and arrogant. There are many recurring supporting characters, including Dekisugi, the student who always gets the best grades in Nobita's class; Nobita's parents; Gian's mother; Gian's sister Jaico; Gian's school teacher; Gian's descendants (from the future); Mii chan (Doraemon's cat girlfriend); and Doraemon's sister Dorami.

The stories are formulaic, usually focusing on the everyday struggles of the fifth grader Nobita, the protagonist of the story. In a typical chapter, Nobita comes home crying about a problem he faces in school and/or in the local neighborhood. After hearing him out, Doraemon often advises him, but that's never enough for Nobita, who consistently looks for the "quick, easy" way out (which offers insight to the viewers as to why Nobita's life turned out the way it did). Finally, after Nobita's pleading and/or goading, Doraemon produces a futuristic gadget out of his pocket to help Nobita fix his problem, enact revenge, or flaunt to his friends, especially Shizuka.

Unfortunately, when he has the gadget, Nobita usually gets into deeper trouble than before, despite Doraemon's best intentions and warnings. Sometimes Nobita's friends (usually Suneo or Gian) steal Doraemon's gadgets and end up misusing them. By the end of the story, the characters who do wrong are usually punished.

===Manga===
In December 1969 the ''Doraemon'' manga appeared simultaneously in six different children's monthly magazines. The magazines were entitled by the year of children's studies, which included ''Yoiko'' (good children), ''Yōchien'' (nursery school), and ''Shogaku Ichinensei'' (first grade of primary school) to ''Shogaku Yonnensei'' (fourth grade of primary school). By 1973 the series began to appear in two more magazines: ''Shogaku Gonensei'' (fifth grade of primary school) and ''Shogaku Rokunensei'' (sixth grade of primary school). The stories featured in each of the magazines were different, meaning the author was originally creating more than six stories each month. In 1977 ''[[CoroCoro Comic]]'' was launched as a magazine of ''Doraemon.'' Original manga based on the ''Doraemon'' movies were also released in ''CoroCoro Comic.'' The stories that are preserved under the Tentōmushi brand are the stories found in these magazines.

Since the debut of ''Doraemon'' in 1969, the stories have been selectively collected into forty-five books published from 1974 to 1996, which had a circulation of over 80 million in 1992. In addition, Doraemon has appeared in a variety of manga series by Shōgakukan. In 2005 Shōgakukan published a series of five more manga volumes under the title ''Doraemon+'' (''[[Doraemon Plus]]''), which were not found in the forty-five Tentōmushi pipi volumes. Many other series have since been produced, some not from official supplies.

Doraemon was discontinued in two media because readers were advancing in grades and an ending was believed to be needed. These two are not reprinted.

* In the March 1971 issue of the magazine ''Shogaku 4-nensei'': Because visitors from the future were causing too much trouble, the government in the 22nd Century passed a bill to ban time-travelling altogether, meaning Doraemon would have to return to his time era. After explaining this to him, he leaves Nobita.

* In the March 1972 issue of the magazine ''Shogaku 4-nensei'': Sewashi realizes that Doraemon being in with Nobita would cause him to become overly dependent on Doraemon, so he arranges with Doraemon and has him fake a mechanical problem so that Nobita would let him go. Nobita believes him and promises to wait until Doraemon gets well, and Doraemon confesses about his sickness. Realizing that Nobita was thinking of the same thing and can handle his departure, Doraemon returns to the future.

The third ending was actually meant to be the official ending due to low TV ratings and the [[Fujiko Fujio]] duo being busy with other works, but Doraemon did not leave their minds and restarted in the next month's issue. In 1981, this episode was made into anime (called "Doraemon Comes Back") and in 1998 this was released as an anime movie.

* In the March 1973 issue of the magazine ''Shogaku 4-nensei," Nobita again returns home after losing a fight against Gian. Doraemon then explains that he has to return. Nobita tries to have Doraemon stay but after talking it over with his parents, he accepts Doraemon's departure. They take a last walk in the park. After they split up, Nobita encounters Gian and gets into a fight again. After a long duel with Nobita trying to win at all costs so that Doraemon can leave without worries, Gian gave up (which gave Nobita the win) because no matter what, Nobita refused to stay down. Doraemon finds Nobita unconcious and takes him home. Sitting beside the sleeping Nobita, Doraemon returns to the future. This story was reprinted in the last chapter of the manga Book 6.

When the [[Fujiko Fujio]] duo broke up in 1987, the very idea of an official ending to the series was never discussed. Since Fujiko F. died in 1996 before any decisions were reached, any "endings" of Doraemon are [[fan fiction]]. However, it is apparent from many episodes and movies where Nobita travels to the future that in the end he does marry Shizuka, leads a happy life, and separates with Doraemon, although Nobita and his friends fondly remember him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kukudm.com/Html/20051026184634-1.Html |title=All About Doraemon the robotic cat (Chinese) |publisher=Kukudm.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>

===Anime===

====Television series====
{{main|Doraemon (1973 anime)|Doraemon (1979 anime)|Doraemon (2005 anime)}}
After a brief and unpopular animated series in 1973 by [[Nippon Television]], ''Doraemon'' remained fairly exclusive in manga from until 1979 when a newly formed animation studio, [[Shin-Ei Animation]] (Now owned by [[TV Asahi]]) produced an anime series of ''Doraemon.'' This series became incredibly popular, and ended with 1,787 episodes on March 25, 2005.

Celebrating the anniversary of Doraemon, a new ''Doraemon'' series began airing on TV Asahi on April 15, 2005 with new [[seiyū|voice actors]] and staff, and updated character designs. Currently the old series is being broadcast in India on the Tv Channel Hungama TV and Disney 
Channel.

====Feature films====
{{See|List of Doraemon films}}
In 1980, [[Toho]] released the first of a series of annual feature length [[animated film]]s based on the lengthly special volumes published annually. Unlike the anime and manga (some based on the stories in select volumes), they are more action-adventure oriented and have more of a [[Shōnen manga|shōnen]] demographic, taking the familiar characters of ''Doraemon'' and placing them in a variety of exotic and perilous settings. Nobita and his friends have visited the age of the [[dinosaur]]s, the far reaches of the [[galaxy]], the heart of darkest Africa (where they encountered a race of sentient bipedal dogs), the depths of the ocean, and a world of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Some of the films are based on [[legend]]s such as [[Atlantis]], and on literary works including ''[[Journey to the West]]'' and ''[[Arabian Nights]].'' Some films also have serious themes, especially on environmental topics and the use of technology. Overall, the films have a somewhat darker tone in their stories, unlike the manga and anime.

The most recent ''Doraemon'' film, ''[[Doraemon: Nobita no Himitsu Dōgu Museum]]'', was released on March 9, 2013. With this film, Doraemon has surpassed [[Godzilla]] in terms of overall ticket sales for a film franchise as Toho's most lucrative movie property. The 33 year series (1980-2013) has sold a combined 100 million tickets vs. the 50 year Godzilla series (1954-2004), which sold a combined 99 million tickets.<ref name="Wall Street Journal Japan">{{cite news|last=Sekiguchi|first=Toko|title=Godzilla Loses Top Spot to Kittybot Doraemon|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2013/03/26/godzilla-loses-top-spot-to-kittybot-doraemon/|accessdate=March 26, 2013|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=March 26, 2013}}</ref>

===Video games===
{{details|List of Doraemon video games}}

There are a total of 63 Japanese-only video games ranging from platformer games to RPG games, which began with the Emerson's [[Arcadia 2001]] system. Doraemon can also be seen in [[Namco]]'s popular [[Taiko no Tatsujin]] rhythm game series like Taiko no Tatsujin (11 - [[Taiko no Tatsujin 14|14]] only), [[Metcha! Taiko no Tatsujin DS: Nanatsu no Shima no Daibouken]], [[Taiko no Tatsujin Wii]], [[Taiko no Tatsujin Plus]], and [[Taiko no Tatsujin DS: Dororon! Yokai Daikessen!!]]. The Chinese version of Microsoft's 3D Movie Maker contained a Doraemon-themed expansion pack.

===Part of Japanese society===
Doraemon is a term of common knowledge in Japan. Newspapers also regularly make references to Doraemon and his pocket as a something with the ability to satisfy all wishes. Other characters in the series are also referenced frequently on TV shows with similar looking casts. Some magazines have used the analogy that America is the Takeshi of the world and Japan is his sidekick Suneo.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Doraemon is a cultural phenomenon in Japan and can be seen in many places. For example, Doraemon is used as a promotional character by {{nihongo|Art Hikkoshi Center|アート引越センター|Āto hikkoshi sentā}}, by a moving company, and by Cocos, a restaurant chain.

Doraemon also appears in appeals for charity, the "Doraemon Fund". Doraemon toys and novelties are also often found in Japan, with literally thousands of items for sale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Doraemon, Nobita, and the other characters also appear in various educational manga. Doraemon is also mentioned in several anime and manga by other [[Mangaka|manga artists]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Doraemon is referenced in the current Blue Man Group show running in Tokyo. The Blue Men play a short snippet of the show's theme song, and one dons Doraemon's beanie.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

The Japanese-American guitar company, [[ESP Guitars]], makes a Doraemon shaped guitar. [[Mamotte! Lollipop]] referenced Doraemon in a chapter about a bath house. The music video for the single "From a Distance" off of the ''[[Bicycles & Tricycles]]'' album by ambient house act, [[The Orb]] revolves around Doraemon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Sumo wrestler [[Takamisugi]] was nicknamed "Doraemon" because of his strong resemblance to the character.

The video game series [[Dangan Ronpa]] features a character named Monobear, whose voice actor provides the voice of Doraemon series. As a result, there are several references to the character within the game. Most notably, in [[Super Dangan Ronpa 2]], the main antagonist has an alternate personality that changes from the game's art style to mimic Doraemon's.

In late 2011, Shogakukan and [[Toyota]] joined forces to create a series of live-action commercials as part of Toyota's ReBorn ad campaign. The commercials depict the characters nearly 20 years older. Hollywood actor [[Jean Reno]] plays Doraemon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-07-14/jean-reno-goes-to-olympics-as-doraemon-in-new-live-action-ad |title=Jean Reno Goes to Olympics as Doraemon in New Live-Action Ad - News |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2013-01-27 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}</ref>
