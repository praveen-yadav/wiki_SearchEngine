The '''aardwolf''' (''Proteles cristata'') is a small, [[insectivore|insectivorous]] [[mammal]], native to [[East Africa]] and [[Southern Africa]]. Its name means "earth wolf" in the [[Afrikaans]] / [[Dutch language]].<ref name=EB/> It is also called "maanhaar jackal",<ref name="OED">Oxford English Dictionary Online (2013)</ref> or ''civet hyena'', based on the secretions (civet) from their anal glands.<ref name=ingo/> The aardwolf is in the same family as the [[hyena]]s. Unlike its relatives in the order [[Carnivora]], the aardwolf does not hunt large [[animal]]s, or even eat meat on a regular basis; instead it eats [[insect]]s, mainly [[termite]]s - one aardwolf can eat about 200,000 termites during a single night by using its long, sticky [[tongue]] to capture them. The aardwolf lives in the scrublands of eastern and southern Africa - these are open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs. The aardwolf is [[nocturnal]], resting in [[burrow]]s during the day and emerging at night to seek food. Their diet consists mainly of termites, insect [[larva]]e, and the [[carrion]] of larger animals.<ref name="wff">International Masters Publishers (1998)</ref>

==Taxonomy==
The aardwolf is the only surviving species in the mammalian [[subfamily]] '''Protelinae'''. There is disagreement as to whether there are any subspecies or if the species is monotypic. Some sources say that there are two [[subspecies]]: ''Proteles cristatus cristatus'' of [[Southern Africa]] and ''Proteles cristatus septentrionalis'' of [[East Africa]].<ref>Koepfli, Klaus-Peter; Jenks, Susan, M.; Eizirik, Eduardo; Zahirpour, Tannaz; Van Valkenburgh, Blaire; Wayne, Robert K. (2006)</ref><ref name=ingo/> Whereas others say it is monotypic.<ref name=Woz>Wozencraft, W. Christopher (2005)</ref>

The aardwolf is usually classified with the [[Hyaenidae]], though it was formerly placed into the family '''Protelidae'''. 

==Etymology==
The genus name ''proteles'' comes from two words both of [[Greek language|Greek]] origin, ''protos'' and ''teleos'' which combined means "complete in front" based on the fact that they have 5 toes on their front feet and four on the rear.<ref name=ingo/> The species name, ''cristatus'' comes from [[Latin]] and means "provided with a comb", relating to their mane.<ref name=ingo/>

==Physical characteristics==
[[Image:Aardwolf02.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of head - taken at the [[Cincinnati Zoo]]. Note the ability to rotate the ears.]]
The aardwolf resembles a very thin [[striped hyena]], but with a more slender [[snout|muzzle]], black vertical stripes on a coat of yellowish fur, and a long, distinct [[:wikt:mane|mane]] down the midline of the neck and back. The mane is raised during confrontations in order to make the aardwolves appear larger. It is missing the throat spot that others in the family have.<ref name=ingo/> The aardwolf is about {{convert|55|to|80|cm|in}} long, excluding its bushy tail, which is about {{convert|20|-|30|cm|in}} long,<ref name=EB>Hoiberg, Dale H. (2010)</ref> and stands about {{convert|40|to|50|cm|in}} tall at the shoulders.<ref name="Colliers">Goodwin, George G. (1997)</ref> An adult aardwolf weighs approximately {{convert|7|-|10|kg|lb}}, sometimes reaching  {{convert|15|kg|lb}}.<ref name=ingo>Rieger, Ingo (1990)</ref> The front feet have five toes each, unlike the four-toed hyena.<ref name=EB/> The teeth and skull are similar to those of the hyena, though smaller,<ref name=Colliers/> and its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects.<ref name=EB/> Its ears are very similar to the [[Striped Hyena]].<ref name=ingo/>

As the aardwolf ages, it will normally lose some of its teeth, though this has little impact on their feeding habits due to the softness of the insects that they eat.<ref name="wff" /> The aardwolf has two anal glands that secrete a musky fluid for marking territory and for communicating with other aardwolves.

==Distribution and habitat==
Aardwolves live in open, dry plains and [[bushland]], avoiding mountainous areas. Due to their specific food requirements, they are only found in regions where termites of the family [[Hodotermitidae]] occur. Termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed [[grassland]]s and [[savannah]]s, including [[arable land|farmland]]. For most of the year, aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens, which are occupied for six weeks at a time.<ref name="wff" />

There are two distinct populations: one in Southern Africa, and another in East and Northeast Africa. The species does not occur in the intermediary [[miombo]] forests.

An adult pair, along with their most recent offspring, will occupy a territory of {{convert|1|-|2|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name=PKR/>

==Behavior==
[[Image:Aardwolf.jpg|thumb|left|Aardwolf at the [[San Antonio Zoo and Aquarium|San Antonio Zoo]]]]
Aardwolves are shy and [[nocturnal animal|nocturnal]], sleeping in underground burrows by day.<ref name=EB/> They usually use existing burrows of [[aardvark]]s, [[Old World porcupine|porcupine]]s or [[springhare]]s, despite being capable of creating their own. 

They have often been mistaken for solitary animals. In fact, they live as monogamous pairs with their young.<ref name="koel">Koehler, C. E.; Richardson, P. R. K. (1990)</ref> If their territory is infringed upon, they will chase the intruder up to {{convert|400|m|ft}}. If the intruder is caught a fight will occur, which is accompanied by hoarse barking and a type of roar.<ref name=PKR/> The majority of incursions occur during mating season, when they can occur 1-2 times per week.<ref name=PKR/> When food is scarce the stringent territorial system may be abandoned and as many as three pairs may occupy a "single territory."<ref name=PKR/>

The territory is marked by both sexes, as they both have developed anal glands from which they extrude a black substance that is smeared on rocks or grass stalks in {{convert|5|mm|in}} long streaks. <ref name=PKR/> They often mark near termite mounds within their territory every 20 minutes or so. If they are patrolling their territorial boundaries, the marking frequency increases drastically, to once every {{convert|50|m|ft}}. At this rate, an individual may mark 60 marks per hour.<ref name=PKR/>

An aardwolf pair may have up to ten dens, and numerous [[midden]]s, within their territory. When they deposit feces at their middens, they dig a small hole and then cover it with sand. Their dens may be abandoned [[aardvark]] or [[porcupine]] dens, or on occasion they are crevices in rocks. They will also dig their own dens, or enlarge dens started by springhares.<ref name=PKR/> They typically will only use one or two dens at a time, rotating through all of their dens every 6 months. During the summer, they may rest outside their den during the night, and sleep underground during the heat of the day.

Aardwolfs are not fast runners nor are they particularly adept at fighting off predators. Therefore, when threatened, the aardwolf will attempt to mislead its foe by doubling back on its tracks. If confronted it will raise its mane in an attempt to appear more menacing. It will also emit a foul-smelling liquid from its anal glands.<ref name=Colliers/>

===Feeding===
The aardwolf feeds primarily on termites and more specifically on [[Trinervitermes trinervoides]].<ref name=EB/><ref name=PKR>Richardson, Phillip K. R.; Bearder, Simon K. (1984)</ref> They locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites.<ref name=PKR/> An aardwolf may consume up to 200,000 [[termites]]per night using its sticky, long tongue.<ref name="wff" /> They do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony, thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food. They will often memorise the location of such nests and return to them. During certain seasonal events, such as the onset of the rainy season and the cold of mid-winter, the primary termites become scarce and so the need for other forms of sustenance becomes pronounced. During these times the aardwolf will seek out [[Hodotermes mossambicus]], a type of [[harvester termite]].<ref name=PKR/> They are also known to feed on other insects, larvae, eggs and occasionally small [[mammals]] and [[birds]], but these constitute a very small percentage of their total diet.<ref name=PKR/> Unlike other [[hyena]]s, aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals.The adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups,<ref name=Colliers/> however more recent research has shown that they are primarily solitary foragers,<ref name=koel/> necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey. Their primary source, ''Trinervitermes'', forages in small but dense patches of {{convert|25|-|100|cm|in}}.<ref name=PKR/>

===Breeding===
The [[breeding season]] varies depending on their location, but normally takes place during autumn or spring. During the breeding season, unpaired male aardwolves will search their own territory, as well as others, for a female to mate with. Dominant males will also mate opportunistically with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves. This can often result in conflict between rival males.<ref name=ingo/> [[Gestation]] lasts between 89 and 92 days,<ref name=ingo/> producing two to five [[List of animal names|cubs]] (most often two or three) during the rainy season (Nov-Dec),<ref name=Colliers/> when termites are more active.<ref name=EB/> They are born with their eyes open but initially are helpless,<ref name=PKR/> and weigh around {{convert|200|-|350|g|oz}}.<ref name=ingo/> The first six to eight weeks are spent in the [[Burrow|den]] with their parents. The male may spend up to six hours a night watching over the cubs while the mother is out looking for food.<ref name=PKR/> After three months, they begin supervised foraging and by four months are normally independent, though they will often share a den with their mother until the next breeding season. By the time the next set of cubs is ready to start foraging, the older cubs have moved on. They can achieve a [[life expectancy|lifespan]] of up to 24 years when in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]].<ref name=ingo/> Aardwolves generally achieve [[sexual maturity]] at one and a half to two years of age.<ref name=ingo/>

==Conservation==
The aardwolf has not seen decreasing numbers and they are relatively widespread throughout eastern Africa. They are not common throughout their range, as they maintain a density of no more than 1 per square kilometer, if the food is good. Because of these factors, the IUCN has rated the aardwolf as [[least concern]].<ref name="IUCN">{{IUCN | id =18372| taxon =Proteles cristata | assessors =Anderson, H & Mills, G.| assessment_year =2008 | version =3.1 | accessdate =04/06/2013 }}</ref> They are persecuted by man because of the mistaken belief that they prey on livestock. However, they are actually beneficial to the farmers because their food, the termites are detrimental to farming and they eat 200,000 per night.<ref name=PKR/> 

==Interaction with humans==
[[Agriculture]] may create a negative impact on their population due to use of poisons by farmers.<ref name="IUCN"/> They are often considered useful, non-dangerous animals by farmers. However, in some areas the aardwolf is hunted for its fur. Encounters with [[dog]]s are another threat.
