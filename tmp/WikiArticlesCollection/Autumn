'''Autumn''', sometimes known as '''fall''' in the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/fall?q=fall |title =Oxford Dictionary on the North American usage of Fall}}</ref> is one of the four [[temperate]] [[season]]s. Autumn marks the transition from [[summer]] into [[winter]], in September ([[Northern Hemisphere]]) or March ([[Southern Hemisphere]]) when the arrival of [[night]] becomes noticeably earlier. One of its main features is the shedding of leaves from some trees as they pave way for further growth.

The [[equinox]]es might be expected to be in the middle of their respective seasons, but temperature lag (caused by the thermal latency of the ground and sea) means that seasons appear later than dates calculated from a purely astronomical perspective.  The actual lag varies with region. Some cultures regard the autumnal equinox as "mid-autumn", others with a longer lag treat it as the start of autumn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/glossary.php?word=autumn |title=NOAA's National Weather Service - Glossary |publisher=Crh.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>  Meteorologists (and most of the [[temperate countries]] in the southern hemisphere)<ref>{{cite web|author=06:06 AM, Sat 7 August |url=http://www.tourism.net.nz/new-zealand/about-new-zealand/weather-and-climate.html |title=New Zealand Weather and Climate, New Zealand Weather, Temperatures and Climate in New Zealand |publisher=Tourism.net.nz |date= |accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref> use a definition based on months, with autumn being September, October and November in the northern hemisphere,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/autumn_forecasting.shtml |title=Weather Centre - Features - Understanding Weather - Autumn Forecasting |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-08-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100904052411/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/autumn_forecasting.shtml| archivedate= 4 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and March, April and May in the southern hemisphere.

In [[North America]], autumn is usually considered to start with the September equinox.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/22/first-day-of-fall-2010-au_n_734692.html |title=First Day Of Fall 2010: Autumn Equinox Photos |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 22 September 2010|accessdate=2010-09-22 |first=Craig |last=Kanalley| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100924195451/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/22/first-day-of-fall-2010-au_n_734692.html| archivedate= 24 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In traditional East Asian [[solar term]], autumn starts on or around 8 August and ends on about 7 November.

==Etymology==

The word ''autumn'' comes from the [[Old French]] word ''autompne'' (''automne'' in [[modern French]]), and was later normalised to the original [[Latin]] word ''autumnus''.<ref>''Etymology of 'autumn' '' - New [[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]], 1997 Edition</ref> There are rare examples of its use as early as the 12th century, but it became common by the 16th century.

Before the 16th century, ''[[harvest]]'' was the term usually used to refer to the season, as it is common in other [[West Germanic languages]] to this day (cf. Dutch ''herfst'', German ''Herbst'' and Scots ''hairst''). However, as more people gradually moved from working the land to living in towns (especially those who could read and write,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} the only people whose use of language we now know), the word ''harvest'' lost its reference to the time of year and came to refer only to the actual activity of reaping, and ''autumn'', as well as ''fall'', began to replace it as a reference to the season.<ref>{{OEtymD|harvest}}</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|autumn}}</ref>

The alternative word ''fall'' for the season traces its origins to old [[Germanic languages]]. The exact derivation is unclear, with the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''fiæll'' or ''feallan'' and the [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''fall'' all being possible candidates. However, these words all have the meaning "to fall from a height" and are clearly derived either from a common root or from each other. The term came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of [[Middle English]] expressions like "[[Abscission|fall of the leaf]]" and "fall of the year".<ref>{{OEtymD|fall}}</ref>

During the 17th century, [[British colonisation of the Americas|English emigration to the British colonies]] in North America was at its peak, and the new settlers took the English language with them. While the term ''fall'' gradually became obsolete in Britain, it became the more common term in North America.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Harvest association==
Association with the transition from warm to cold weather, and its related status as the season of the primary [[harvest]], has dominated its themes and popular images. In Western cultures, personifications of autumn are usually pretty, well-fed females adorned with fruits, vegetables and grains that ripen at this time. Many cultures feature autumnal [[harvest festival]]s, often the most important on their calendars. Still extant echoes of these celebrations are found in the autumn [[Thanksgiving]] holiday of the United States and Canada, and the Jewish [[Sukkot]] holiday with its roots as a full-moon harvest festival of "tabernacles" (living in outdoor huts around the time of harvest). {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} There are also the many North American Indian festivals tied to harvest of autumnally ripe foods gathered in the wild, the Chinese Mid-Autumn or [[Moon festival]], and many others. The predominant mood of these autumnal celebrations is a gladness for the fruits of the earth mixed with a certain melancholy linked to the imminent arrival of harsh weather.

This view is presented in English poet [[John Keats]]' poem ''[[To Autumn]]'', where he describes the season as a time of bounteous fecundity, a time of 'mellow fruitfulness'.

While most foods are harvested during the autumn, foods particularly associated with the season include [[pumpkin]]s (which are integral parts of both Thanksgiving and [[Halloween]]) and [[apple]]s, which are used to make the seasonal beverage [[apple cider]].

==Melancholy association==
[[File:New hampshire in autumn .jpg|thumb|Autumn in New Hampshire]]
Autumn in poetry has often been associated with [[melancholy]]. The possibilities of summer are gone, and the chill of winter is on the horizon. Skies turn grey, and many people turn inward, both physically and mentally.<ref>[http://www.symbolism.org/writing/books/sp/4/page2.html Cyclical Regenerative Time - (c) Autumn] (from 'Symbolism of Place', symbolism.org website)</ref> 

Similar examples may be found in Irish poet [[William Butler Yeats]]' poem ''[[The Wild Swans at Coole]]'' where the maturing season that the poet observes symbolically represents his own ageing self.  Like the natural world that he observes he too has reached his prime and now must look forward to the inevitability of old age and death. French poet [[Paul Verlaine]]'s "''[[Chanson d'automne]]''" ("Autumn Song") is likewise characterised by strong, painful feelings of sorrow. [[John Keats|Keats]]' ''[[To Autumn]]'', written in September 1819, echoes this sense of melancholic reflection, but also emphasises the lush abundance of the season.

==Other associations==
{{globalize/North America|date=August 2013}}
Autumn is associated with the [[Halloween]] season (influenced by [[Samhain]], a Celtic autumn festival),<ref name="ENC">[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572079/Halloween.html Halloween] (from the [[Microsoft Encarta]] encyclopaedia). [http://www.webcitation.org/5kwKs5kQp Archived] 2009-10-31.</ref> and with it a widespread marketing campaign that promotes it, in the US. The television, film, book, costume, home decoration, and confectionery industries use this time of year to promote products closely associated with such a holiday, with promotions going from early September to 31 October, since their themes rapidly lose strength once the holiday ends, and advertising starts concentrating on Christmas.

Television stations and networks, particularly in North America, traditionally begin their regular seasons in autumn, with new series and new episodes of existing series debuting mostly during late September or early October (series that debut outside the fall season are usually known as [[midseason replacement]]s). A sweeps period takes place in November to measure [[Nielsen Ratings]].

Autumn, particularly in most parts of the US, also has a strong association with the [[first day of school|start of a new school year]], particularly for children in primary and secondary education. "[[Back to school (marketing)|Back to School]]" advertising and preparations usually occurs in the weeks leading to the start of the fall season.

Since 1997, Autumn has been one of the top 100 names for girls in the US.<ref>[http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/ Popular Baby Names], Social Security Online.</ref>

In Indian mythology, autumn is considered to be the preferred season for the goddess of learning [[Saraswati]], who is also known by the name of "goddess of autumn" (Sharada).

==Tourism==

Although [[Autumn leaf color|colour change in leaves]] occurs wherever [[deciduous]] trees are found, coloured autumn [[foliage]] is noted in various regions of the world: most of [[North America]], [[Eastern Asia]] (including China, [[Korea]], and Japan), [[Europe]], parts of Australia and New Zealand's [[South Island]].

Eastern [[Canada]] and [[New England]] are famous for their autumnal foliage,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/news/details.asp?id=19990921001 |title=Nova Scotia Capitalizes on Fall Tourism &#124; News Releases &#124; Government of Nova Scotia |publisher=Gov.ns.ca |date=21 September 1999 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/the-complete-guide-to-leafpeeping-612904.html |title=The Complete Guide to Leaf-Peeping - News & Advice, Travel |publisher=The Independent |date=14 September 2002 |accessdate=2010-03-06 | location=London | first=Ben | last=Ross}}</ref> and this attracts major tourism (worth billions of U.S. dollars) for the regions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Shir Haberman |url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071009/NEWS/710090335 |title=Leaf peepers storm N.H., Maine |publisher=SeacoastOnline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=a3vkUrgIabaA&refer=us |title=Record New England Rains Make Foliage `a Dud,' Hurt Tourism |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=4 November 2005 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref>
