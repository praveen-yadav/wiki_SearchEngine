}}</ref> or simply the '''cat''' when there is no need to distinguish it from other [[Felidae|felids]] and [[Felinae|felines]]. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt [[vermin]] and household pests.

Cats are similar in [[Cat anatomy|anatomy]] to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. [[Cat senses]] fit a [[crepuscular]] and predatory [[ecological niche]]. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in [[frequency]] for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer [[color vision]] and a better [[Olfaction|sense of smell]] than humans.

Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species, and [[cat communication]] includes the use of a variety of [[Animal communication|vocalization]]s ([[meowing]], [[purr]]ing, [[Trill consonant|trilling]], hissing, [[growling]] and [[Guttural|grunting]]) as well as [[cat pheromone]]s and types of [[Cat body language|cat-specific body language]].<ref name="Moelk" />

Cats have a rapid breeding rate. Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and shown as [[Cat registry|registered]] pedigree pets, a hobby known as [[cat fancy]]. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by [[neutering]], and the [[Abandoned pets|abandonment of former household pets]], has resulted in large numbers of [[feral cat]]s worldwide, requiring [[animal population control|population control]].<ref name="Rochlitz">{{Cite book |last=Rochlitz |first=Irene |title=The Welfare of Cats |series="Animal Welfare" series |year=2007 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |pages=141–175 |isbn=1-4020-6143-9}}</ref>

The English word ''[[:wikt:cat#English|cat]]'' ([[Old English]] ''catt'') is in origin a loanword, introduced to many [[languages of Europe]] from Latin ''cattus''<ref>{{cite book|last=McKnight|first=George H.|title=English Words and Their Background|publisher=D.

"chat" (Paris: Errance, 2004), 82.</ref> the feminine of ''čaus'' "wildcat". The word was introduced, together with the domestic animal itself, to the [[Roman Republic]] by the 1st century BC.{{citation needed|date=September 2012|reason=There's no source for this anyway, but it sounds suspiciously late, so the eventual source needs to be unusually reliable to support such an unusual claim.}}
An alternative word with cognates in many languages is English ''[[:wikt:puss#English|puss]]'' (''pussycat''). Attested only from the 16th century, it may have been introduced from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''poes'' or from [[Low German]] ''puuskatte'', related to [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''kattepus'', or [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''pus'', ''pusekatt''. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian ''puižė'' and [[Irish language|Irish]] ''puisín''. The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have simply arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/155147#eid27609702|title=Puss|work=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref><ref name="Gramercy Unabridged">''Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language''.

A [[Pedigree (cat)|pedigreed cat]] is one whose ancestry is recorded by a [[Cat fancy|cat fancier]] organization. A [[purebred cat]] is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as [[show cat]]s.  Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry are referred to as [[Domestic short-haired cat|domestic short-haired]] or [[domestic long-haired cat]]s, by [[Coat (animal)|coat]] type, or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly [[British English|British]]), or (using terms borrowed from [[Dog breeds|dog breeding]]) mongrels or mutt-cats.

While the [[African wildcat]] is the ancestral subspecies from which domestic cats are descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed, there are several intermediate stages between domestic pet and pedigree cats on the one hand and those entirely wild animals on the other. The semi-feral cat is a mostly outdoor cat that is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and may be fed by several households. [[Feral cat]]s are associated with human habitation areas and may be fed by people or forage in rubbish, but are typically wary of human interaction.<ref name="Bradshaw1999" />

This also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain. Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a "pacing" [[gait]]; that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with [[camel]]s and [[giraffe]]s. As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait will change to be a "diagonal" gait, similar to that of most other mammals (and many other land animals, such as [[lizard]]s): the diagonally opposite hind and forelegs will move simultaneously.<ref name="Christensen 2004">{{Cite book

To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable [[vibrissa]]e (whiskers) over their body, especially their face. These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective [[blink reflex]]es to protect the eyes from damage.<ref name="Case" />{{rp|47}}

===Diseases===
Cats can suffer from a wide range of health problems, including infectious diseases, parasites, injuries and chronic disease. [[Feline vaccination|Vaccinations]] are available for many of these diseases, and domestic cats are regularly given treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms and fleas.

===Poisoning===
In addition to obvious dangers such as [[rodenticide]]s, [[insecticide]]s and [[herbicide]]s, cats may be poisoned by many chemicals that are usually considered safe by their human guardians.<ref name="vetinfo" /> This is because their livers are less effective at some forms of [[detoxification]] than those of many other animals, including humans and dogs.<ref name="MacDonald" /><ref name="Williams 1978">{{Cite journal

The compound is found in shampoos, dips, foggers, spot-ons, and sprays for small animal use but can be toxic to cats in very small doses.

Female cats are seasonally [[polyestrous]], which means they may have many periods of [[Estrus|heat]] over the course of a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days.<ref name="compendium" /> Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female will reject the male, but eventually the female will allow the male to mate. The female will utter a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her. This is because a male [[cat's penis]] has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing [[penile spines]], which are about one millimeter long;<ref name="Aronson 1967">{{Cite journal

This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

After mating, the female will wash her [[vulva]] thoroughly. If a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.<ref name="compendium" />

===Vocalizations===
{{Main|Cat communication}}
The cat is a very vocal animal. Known for its trademark [[purr]]ing, it also produces a wide variety of other sounds.

The mechanism by which cats purr is elusive. The cat has no unique anatomical feature that is clearly responsible for the sound.<ref name="CPEM">{{cite web|url= http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/catspurr.html|title=Why and How Do Cats Purr?|accessdate=10 April 2011|publisher=''Library of Congress''}}</ref> It was, until recent times, believed that only the cats of the ''[[Felis]]'' [[genus]] could purr. However, felids of the ''[[Panthera]]'' genus ([[tiger]], [[lion]], [[jaguar]] and [[leopard]]) also produce sounds similar to purring, but only when exhaling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panthera.org/|title=Panthera|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref>

Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark the feral as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespan is increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.<ref name="hsus-feral" />

Traditionally, historians tended to think that [[ancient Egypt]] was the site of cat domestication, owing to the clear depictions of house cats in Egyptian paintings about 3,600 years old.<ref name="Driscoll" /> However, in 2004, a Neolithic grave was excavated in [[Shillourokambos]], Cyprus, that contained the skeletons, laid close to one another, of both a human and a cat. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, pushing back the earliest known feline–human association significantly.<ref name="9500 years" /><ref name="Muir 2004">{{Cite news

This discovery, combined with genetic studies, suggest that cats were probably domesticated in the Middle East, in the [[Fertile Crescent]] around the time of the [[History of agriculture|development of agriculture]] and then they were brought to Cyprus and Egypt.<ref name="Driscoll">{{Cite journal|author=Driscoll CA, Menotti-Raymond M, Roca AL |title=The Near Eastern origin of cat domestication |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5837 |pages=519–23 |year=2007 |pmid=17600185 |doi=10.1126/science.1139518|bibcode = 2007Sci...317..519D }}</ref>

In ancient Egypt cats were [[animal worship|sacred animal]]s, with the goddess [[Bastet]] often depicted in cat form, sometimes taking on the warlike aspect of a lioness.<ref name="Mason">{{Cite book |last=Mason |first=I.

Several ancient religions believed that cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that they are all-knowing but are mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans. In Japan, the ''[[maneki neko]]'' is a cat that is a symbol of good fortune. Although there are no sacred species in Islam, [[cats and Islam|cats are revered by Muslims]]. Some writers have stated that [[Muhammad]] had a favorite cat, [[Muezza]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Geyer |first=Georgie Anne |title=When Cats Reigned Like Kings: On the Trail of the Sacred Cats |publisher=Andrews McMeel |location=Kansas City, Missouri |year=2004 |ISBN=0-7407-4697-9}}</ref> He is reported to have loved cats so much that "he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it".<ref name="Reeves">{{Cite book|author=Minou Reeves|title=Muhammad in Europe|publisher=New York University (NYU) Press|page=52|isbn=0-8147-7533-0|year=2000}}</ref>

[[Freyja]]—the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility in [[Norse mythology]]—is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats.

Many cultures have negative [[superstition]]s about cats. An example would be the belief that a [[black cat]] "crossing one's path" leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s used to augment a witch's powers and skills. The killing of cats in Medieval [[Ypres]], [[Belgium]] is commemorated in the innocuous present-day [[Kattenstoet]] (cat parade).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

According to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives. In many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece and some Spanish-speaking regions they are said to have seven lives,<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://elcomercio.pe/impresa/notas/vidas-gato/20100307/423959|date=7 March 2010|accessdate=19 March 2010|author=Nora Sugobono|language=Spanish|title=Las vidas del gato|publisher=El Comercio}}</ref> while in Turkish and Arabic traditions the number of lives is six.<ref>{{Cite news|work=The Guardian |location=UK |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/gallery/2010/mar/18/guide-to-pets-pet-myths?picture=360591960|accessdate=18 March 2010|author=Tim Dowling|title=Tall tails: Pet myths busted|date=19 March 2010}}</ref> The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations.<ref name="myth">{{cite web |url= http://www.best-cat-art.com/cat-myths.html |title=Cat Myths, Misinformation and Untruths |first=Rosina |last=Wachtmeister |work=Best-Cat-Art.com |year=2008 |publisher=self-published |accessdate=22 November 2008}}{{self-published source|date=December 2011}}</ref> Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive [[cat righting reflex|righting reflex]] to twist their bodies around.
