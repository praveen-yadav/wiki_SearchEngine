'''Constantin Brâncuși''' ({{IPA-ro|konstanˈtin brɨŋˈkuʃʲ|lang}}; February 19, 1876 &ndash; March 16, 1957) was a [[Romania]]n-born [[sculpture|sculptor]] who made his career in [[France]]. As a child he displayed an aptitude for carving wooden [[farm tool]]s. Formal studies took him first to [[Bucharest]], then to [[Munich]], then to the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]]. His [[abstract art|abstract style]] emphasizes clean [[geometry|geometrical lines]] that balance forms inherent in his materials with the [[symbolism (arts)|symbolic allusions]] of [[representational art]]. Famous Brâncuși works include the ''Sleeping Muse'' (1908), ''[[The Kiss (Brâncuși)|The Kiss]]'' (1908), ''Prometheus'' (1911), ''Mademoiselle Pogany'' (1913), ''The Newborn'' (1915), ''[[Bird in Space]]'' (1919) and ''[[The Endless Column|The Column of the Infinite (Coloana infinitului)]]'', popularly known as ''The Endless Column'' (1938). Considered a pioneer of [[modernism]], Brâncuși is called the patriarch of modern sculpture.

==Early years==
[[File:Constantin Brancusi, Portrait of Mlle Pogany, 1912, Philadelphia Museum of Modern Art, Philadelphia.jpg|thumb|left|Constantin Brâncuși, ''Portrait of Mademoiselle Pogany'' [1], 1912, White marble; limestone block, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], Philadelphia. Exhibited at the 1913 [[Armory Show]].]]
Brâncuși grew up in the village of [[Peștișani|Hobiţa]], [[Gorj County|Gorj]], near [[Târgu Jiu]], close to Romania's [[Carpathian Mountains]], an area known for its rich tradition of [[folk art|folk crafts]], particularly woodcarving. Geometric patterns of the region are seen in his later works.

His parents Nicolae and Maria Brâncuși were poor peasants who earned a meager living through back-breaking labor; from the age of seven, Constantin herded the family's flock of sheep. He showed talent for carving objects out of wood, and often ran away from home to escape the bullying of his father and older brothers.

At the age of nine, Brâncuși left the village to work in the nearest large town. At 11 he went into the service of a grocer in Slatina; and then he became a domestic in a public house in Craiova where he remained for several years. When he was 18, Brâncuși created a violin by hand with materials he found around his workplace. Impressed by Brâncuși's talent for carving, an industrialist entered him in the Craiova School of Arts and Crafts (''școala de arte și meserii''), where he pursued his love for woodworking, graduating with honors in 1898.<ref name=brainjuice>[http://www.brain-juice.com/cgi-bin/show_bio.cgi?p_id=108 "Constantin Brâncuși"] at brainjuice.com. (Accessed March 27, 2007.)</ref>

He then enrolled in the Bucharest School of Fine Arts, where he received academic training in sculpture. He worked hard, and quickly distinguished himself as talented. One of his earliest surviving works, under the guidance of his anatomy teacher, [[Dimitrie Gerota]], is a masterfully rendered [[écorché]] (statue of a man with skin removed to reveal the muscles underneath) which was exhibited at the [[Romanian Athenaeum]] in 1903.<ref name="Brezianu">{{cite doi|10.2307/774863}}</ref> Though just an anatomical study, it foreshadowed the sculptor's later efforts to reveal essence rather than merely copy outward appearance.

==Working in Paris==
[[File:Constantin Brancusi, 1907-08, The Kiss, Exhibited at the Armory Show and published in the Chicago Tribune, 25 March 1913..jpg|thumb|Constantin Brâncuși, 1907-08, ''[[The Kiss (Brâncuși)|The Kiss]]''. Exhibited in 1913 at the [[Armory Show]] and published in the Chicago Tribune, 25 March 1913]]
In 1903, Brâncuși traveled to [[Munich]], and from there to [[Paris]]. In Paris, he was welcomed by the community of artists and intellectuals brimming with new ideas.<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/euwf/hod_1996.403.7ab.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art website]</ref> He worked for two years in the workshop of [[Antonin Mercié]] of the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], and was invited to enter the workshop of [[Auguste Rodin]]. Even though he admired the eminent Rodin he left the Rodin studio after only two months, saying, "Nothing can grow under big trees."<ref name=brainjuice/>

After leaving Rodin's workshop, Brâncuși began developing the revolutionary style for which he is known. His first commissioned work, "The Prayer", was part of a gravestone memorial. It depicts a young woman crossing herself as she kneels, and marks the first step toward abstracted, non-literal representation, and shows his drive to depict "not the outer form but the idea, the essence of things." He also began doing more carving, rather than the method popular with his contemporaries, that of modeling in clay or plaster which would be cast in metal, and by 1908 he worked almost exclusively by carving.

In the following few years he made many versions of "Sleeping Muse" and "[[The Kiss (Brâncuși)|The Kiss]]", further simplifying forms to geometrical and sparse objects.

His works became popular in France, Romania and the United States. Collectors, notably [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], bought his pieces, and reviewers praised his works. In 1913 Brâncuși's work was displayed at both the [[Salon des Indépendants]] and the first exhibition in the U.S. of modern art, the [[Armory Show]].

[[File:Edward Steichen - Brancusi's studio, 1920.jpeg|thumb|right|Brâncuși's Paris studio, 1920, photograph by [[Edward Steichen]]]]
In 1920, he developed a notorious reputation with the entry of "Princess X" [http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51035.html] in the [[Salon des Indépendants|Salon]]. The phallic shape of the piece scandalized the Salon, and despite Brâncuși's explanation that it was an anonymous portrait, removed it from the exhibition. "Princess X" was revealed to be [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], direct descendant of the younger brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Brâncuși represented or caricatured her life as a large gleaming bronze [[phallus]]. This phallus symbolizes the model's obsession with the penis and her lifelong quest to achieve vaginal orgasm, with the help of [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref>[http://books.google.es/books?id=8ldqAAAAMAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=orgasm Princess Marie Bonaparte, ''De la Sexualité de la Femme'', Grove Press, 1962]</ref><ref>[http://www.archivesdefrance.culture.gouv.fr/action-culturelle/celebrations-nationales/recueil-2012/sciences-et-techniques/marie-bonaparte/ ''Marie Bonaparte'', Actions culturelle et pédagogique, Commémorations nationales, recueil 2012, Sciences et techniques, Archives de France]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/drivesaffectsbeh00loew Ryudolph Maurice Loewenstein, ed; Schur, Max, ed; Princess Marie Bonaparte, 1882-1962, ''Drives, affects, behavior'', New York,: International Universities Press]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/rroseisr00bles Jennifer Blessing; Judith Halberstam, 1961, ''Rrose is a rrose is a rrose : gender performance in photography'', 1961; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, N.Y.]</ref>

Around this time he began crafting the bases for his sculptures with much care and originality because he considered them important to the works themselves.

He began working on the group of sculptures that are known as "Bird in Space" — simple shapes representing a bird in flight. The works are based on his earlier "Măiastra" [http://www.guggenheim-venice.it/inglese/collections/artisti/dettagli/opere_dett.php?id_art=26&id_opera=47] series. In Romanian folklore the Măiastra is a beautiful golden bird who foretells the future and cures the blind. Over the following 20 years, Brâncuși would make 20-some versions of "Bird in Space" out of marble or bronze.
Photographer [[Edward Steichen]] purchased one of the "birds" in 1926 and shipped it to the [[United States]]. However, the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|customs]] officers did not accept the "bird" as a work of art and placed a duty upon its import as an industrial item. They charged the high tax placed upon raw metals instead of the no tax on art. A trial the next year overturned the assessment.<ref>[http://www.clubmoral.com/forcemental/16/page.php?sid=139 Force Metal ezine]</ref><ref>Tomkins, Calvin: ''Duchamp: A Biography'', pages 272, 275, 318. Henry Holt and Company, Inc, 1996.</ref> [[Athena Tacha]] Spear's book, ''Brâncuși's Birds,'' (CAA monographs XXI, NYU Press, New York, 1969), first sorted out the 36 versions and their development, from the early ''Măiastra'', to the ''Golden Bird'' of the late teens, to the ''Bird in Space'', which emerged in the early '20s and which Brâncuși perfected throughout his life.

In ''Arts Revolutionists of Today'' (1913), the caption for this photo reads: "At the left of the picture is a much-discussed portrait bust of Mlle. Pogany, a dancer, by Brâncuși. This freak sculpture resembles nothing so much as an egg and has excited much derision and laughter..."<ref>[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/viewer/walt-kuhn-scrapbook-press-clippings-documenting-armory-show-vol-2-14643/41124 Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, ''Walt Kuhn scrapbook of press clippings documenting the Armory Show'', vol. 2, 1913, Page 135]</ref>]]
His work became popular in the U.S., however, and he visited several times during his life. Worldwide fame in 1933 brought him the commission of building a meditation temple in India for Maharajah of Indore, but when Brâncuși went to India in 1937 to complete the plans and begin construction, the Mahrajah was away and lost interest in the project when he returned.

In 1938, he finished the [[World War I]] monument in [[Târgu-Jiu]] where he had spent much of his childhood. "Table of Silence", "The Gate of the Kiss", and "[[Endless Column]]" commemorate the courage and sacrifice of Romanian civilians who in 1916 fought off a German invasion. The restoration of this ensemble was spearheaded by the [[World Monuments Fund]] and was completed in 2004.

The [[Sculptural Ensemble of Constantin Brâncuși at Târgu Jiu|Târgu Jiu ensemble]] marks the apex of his artistic career. In his remaining 19 years he created less than 15 pieces, mostly reworking earlier themes, and while his fame grew he withdrew. In 1956 [[Life magazine|''Life'' magazine]] reported, "Wearing white pajamas and a yellow gnomelike cap, Brâncuși today hobbles about his studio tenderly caring for and communing with the silent host of fish birds, heads, and endless columns which he created."

Brâncuși was cared for in his later years by a Romanian refugee couple. He became a French citizen in 1952 in order to make the caregivers his heirs, and to bequeath his studio and its contents to the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]] in Paris

==Personal life==
[[File:Constantin Brancusi, 1909, Le Baiser (The Kiss), 89.5 x 30 x 20 cm, stone, Cimetière de Montparnasse, Paris. DSC08962.jpg|thumb|Constantin Brâncuși, 1909, ''Le Baiser (The Kiss)'', 89.5 x 30 x 20 cm, stone, [[Montparnasse Cemetery|Cimetière de Montparnasse]], Paris]]
Brâncuși always dressed in the simple ways the Romanian peasants did. His studio was reminiscent of the houses of the peasants from his native region: there was a big slab of rock as a table and a primitive fireplace, similar to those found in traditional houses in his native [[Oltenia]], while the rest of the furniture was made by him out of wood. Brâncuși would cook his own food, [[Romanian cuisine|traditional Romanian dishes]], with which he would treat his guests.<ref name="Sandqvist, p. 249">Sandqvist, p. 249</ref>

Brâncuși held a large spectrum of interests, from science to music. He was a good [[violin]]ist and he would sing old Romanian folk songs, often expressing by them his feelings of homesickness. Nevertheless, he never considered moving back to his native Romania, but he did visit it eight times.<ref name="Sandqvist, p. 249"/>

His circle of friends included artists and intellectuals in Paris such as [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Henri Pierre Roché]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Man Ray]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Henri Rousseau]], and [[Fernand Léger]]. He was an old friend of [[Romany Marie]],<ref name="Biography">Robert Shulman. ''[[Romany Marie]]: The Queen of [[Greenwich Village]]'' (pp. 85-86, 109).  [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]: Butler Books, 2006.  ISBN 1-884532-74-8.</ref> who was also [[Romania]]n, and referred [[Isamu Noguchi]] to her [[café]] in [[Greenwich Village]].<ref name="Haber">{{cite web |url= http://www.haberarts.com/fuller.htm |title= Before Buckyballs |author= [[John Haber]] |publisher= Review of [[Noguchi Museum]]'s ''Best of Friends'' exhibition (2006) }}</ref>
Although surrounded by the Parisian avant-garde, Brâncuși never lost the contact with Romania and had friends from the community of Romanian artists and intellectuals living in Paris, including [[Benjamin Fondane]], [[George Enescu]], [[Theodor Pallady]], [[Camil Ressu]], [[Nicolae Dărăscu]], [[Panait Istrati]], [[Traian Vuia]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Emil Cioran]] and [[Paul Celan]].<ref>Sandqvist, p. 249-250</ref>

Brâncuși held a particular interest in mythology, especially Romanian mythology, folk tales, and traditional art (which also had a strong influence on his works), but he became interested in African and Mediterranean art as well.<ref>Sandqvist, p. 250</ref>

A talented handyman, he built his own phonograph, and made most of his furniture, utensils, and doorways. His worldview valued "differentiating the essential from the ephemeral," with [[Plato]], [[Lao-Tzu]], and [[Milarepa]] as influences. He was a saint-like idealist and near ascetic, turning his workshop into a place where visitors noted the deep spiritual atmosphere. However, particularly through the 10s and 20s, he was known as a pleasure seeker and merrymaker in his [[bohemianism|bohemian]] circle. He enjoyed cigarettes, good wine, and the company of women. He had one child, John Moore, whom he never acknowledged.<ref name=brainjuice/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1686039 |title= Constantin Brancusi (1876-1957) |publisher= [[Christie's]] }}</ref>

==Death and legacy==
[[File:ROL 500 1991 reverse.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Constantin Brâncuși on the 500 [[Romanian leu|leu]] Romanian banknote (1991–1992 issue)]]
He died on March 16, 1957 at the age of 81 leaving 1200 photographs and 215 sculptures. He was buried in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]] in Paris. Also located in that cemetery are statues carved by Brâncuși for several fellow artists who died; the best-known of these is "Le Baiser" ("The Kiss").

His works are housed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] ([[New York City|New York]]), the [[National Museum of Art of Romania]] ([[Bucharest]]), and the [[National Gallery of Art]] ([[Washington, D.C.]]), as well as in other major museums around the world. The [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] currently has the largest collection of Brâncuși sculptures in the United States.

A reconstruction of Brâncuși's onetime studio in Paris is open to the public. It is close to the [[Pompidou Centre]], in the rue Rambuteau. After being refused by the Romanian Communist government, he bequeathed part of his collection to the [[France|French state]] on condition that his workshop be rebuilt as it was on the day he died.

Architect Klas Anshelm designed the [[Malmö Konsthall]], which opened in 1975 and is one of Europe’s largest exhibition halls for contemporary art, taking inspiration for the construction from Brâncuși's studio, after visiting the sculptor in Paris.<ref name="Malmö Konsthall">{{cite web

==Selected works==
Both ''[[Bird in Space]]'' and ''Sleeping Muse I'' are sculptures of animate objects; however, unlike ones from Ancient Greece or Rome, or those from the High Renaissance period, these works of art are more abstract in style.

''[[Bird in Space]]'' is a series from the 1920s. One of these, constructed in 1925 using wood, stone, and marble (Richler 178) stands around 72&nbsp;inches tall and consists of a narrow feather standing erect on a wooden base. Similar models, but made from materials such as bronze, were also produced by Brâncuși and placed in exhibitions.

''Sleeping Muse I'' has different versions as well; one, from 1909–10, is made of marble and measures 6 ¾ in. in height (Adams 549). This is a model of a head, without a body, with markings to show features such as hair, nose, lips, and closed eyes. In ''A History of Western Art'', Adams says that the sculpture has “an abstract, curvilinear quality and a smooth contour that create an impression of elegance” (549). The qualities which produce the effect can particularly be seen in the shape of the eyes and in the set of the mouth.
