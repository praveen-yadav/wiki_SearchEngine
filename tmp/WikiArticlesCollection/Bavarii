'''Bavarii''' (also Baiuwaren) is the original form of the name of the Bavarians, a people created towards the end of the migration that populated most of old [[Bavaria]], [[Austria]], and South Tyrol.

This name has been handed down as ''Baiwaren, Baioaren, Bioras'', [[latinised]] ''Bavarii, Baioarii''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hostkingdom.net/ |title=United Kingdom Online Casinos and Betting Guide - Index |publisher=Hostkingdom.net |date= |accessdate=2013-11-04}}</ref> or Bavarii, Bavarians, Bajuwaren, Bajuvarii, Bajuwaren and Baiern.<ref>{{cite web|author=ProZ.com Translation Services |url=http://www.proz.com/kudoz/german_to_english/history/1144195-bajuwaren_baiern.html |title=Bajuwaren/Baiern > Bajuvarii/Bavarii |publisher=Proz.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-04}}</ref> It is assumed that this is an [[endonym]]. The first part "baio" refers to the name of the [[Celt]]ic [[Boii]] tribe, which also resolved into the regional name [[Bohemia]] (Germanic latinised boio-hemum = home of the Boier tribe).

==History==
The name of the Bavarians is said to mean "men from Bohemia".{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The Bavarii defeated the central European Germanic [[Rugian]] tribe in 487 AD.<ref>{{cite web|author=&nbsp; |url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsEurope/GermanyBavarians.htm |title=Kingdoms of Germany - Bavaria (Bavarii) |publisher=Historyfiles.co.uk |date=1933-07-14 |accessdate=2013-11-04}}</ref>

In the [[Middle Age]]s the Bavarians were considered the descendants of the Celtic Boii tribe. Later, the [[Marcomanni]] were believed to be the "men of Bohemia", after whom the Bavarians were named. They have also been identified with an [[Germanic peoples|East Germanic tribes]] group, whose remains have mostly been found in the North of modern day Bavaria. In the Bavarian region the origins are very mixed. Over the last half of the 20th century, historical and archaeological research has increasingly supported the theory that the remnants of the Celtic Boii were absorbed into the [[Roman Empire]] and later intermingled with other Germanic peoples who chose to stay (or were stationed by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]) in the area. By the 6th century AD there is evidence of the foundation of a Bavarian [[stem duchy]] whose leadership was related to the ruling [[Franks|Frankish]] (and possibly [[Alemanni]]c/[[Swabia]]n) houses. However, there is no longer any real evidence that the rulers of Bavaria belonged to a people called the Bavarii. It is in fact likely that, after the region took on the name of its early inhabitants, later settlers were also known by the accepted geographical name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hostkingdom.net/ |title=United Kingdom Online Casinos and Betting Guide - Index |publisher=Hostkingdom.net |date= |accessdate=2013-11-04}}</ref>

==Location==
[[Bavaria]] is geographically the same region as the [[Bohemian Forest|BÃ¶hmer Wald]] (forested hill slopes). With the arrival of northern Gothic people, particularly the [[Scirii]] in the then Roman province of [[Pannonia]] by 493 a soundshift changed Boi to Bai (Bajuwari). The land remained under the name of Bohemia and part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] even when centuries later [[Czechs|Czech]] people moved to the area.
