'''Aldebaran''' {{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|d|ɛ|b|ər|ən}}<ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Aldebaran?q=aldebaran Oxford Dictionary: Aldebaran]</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aldebaran Merriam-Webster: Aldebaran]</ref> (α Tau, α Tauri, [[alpha (letter)|Alpha]] Tauri) is an orange giant [[star]] located about 68 [[light year]]s away in the [[zodiac]] [[constellation]] of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. With an average [[apparent magnitude]] of 0.87 it is the brightest star in the constellation and is [[list of brightest stars|one of the brightest stars]] in the nighttime sky. The name ''Aldebaran'' is [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ('''{{lang|ar|[[wikt:الدبران|الدبران]]}}''' ''{{transl|ar|al-dabarān}}'') and translates literally as "''the follower''", presumably because this bright star appears to follow the [[Pleiades]], or "Seven Sisters" [[open star cluster|star cluster]] in the night sky.<ref name=Kaler/>

In 1997 a [[Substellar object|substellar]] companion was reported but subsequent observations have not confirmed this claim.

== Physical properties ==
[[File:Aldebaran-Sun comparison-en.svg|thumb|left|200px|Size comparison between Aldebaran and the [[Sun]]]]

Aldebaran is classified as a type K5III star. It is an orange giant star that has moved off the [[main sequence]] line of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]]. It has exhausted the [[hydrogen]] fuel in its core and [[hydrogen fusion]] has ceased there. Although not yet hot enough for [[helium fusion|fusing helium]], the core temperature of the star has greatly increased due to gravitational pressure and the star has expanded to a diameter of 44.2 times the diameter of the [[Sun]],<ref name="aldiam"/><ref>Richichi & Roccatagliata (2005) derived an angular diameter of 20.58±0.03 milliarcsec, which given a distance of 65 light years yields a diameter of 61 million km.</ref> approximately 61 million kilometres (see [[10 gigametres]] for similar sizes). The [[Hipparcos]] satellite has measured it as 65.1 light years (20.0 [[Parsec|pc]]) away, and it shines with 425 times the Sun's luminosity.<ref name=Kaler/>

Aldebaran is a slightly [[variable star]], of the [[slow irregular variable]] type ''LB''. It varies by about 0.2 in apparent magnitude from 0.75 to 0.95.<ref name=var>{{cite web | title=Query= alf Tau | url=http://www.sai.msu.su/gcvs/cgi-bin/search.cgi?search=alf+Tau | publisher=[[Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg]] | work=[[General Catalogue of Variable Stars]] | accessdate=2009-12-16}}</ref> With a near-[[infrared]] [[J band]] [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] of -2.1,<ref name="SIMBAD" /> only [[Betelgeuse]] (-2.9), [[R Doradus]] (-2.6), and [[Arcturus]] (-2.2) are brighter.

== Visibility ==
Aldebaran is one of the easiest stars to find in the [[night sky]], partly due to its brightness and partly due to its spatial relation to one of the more noticeable [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] in the sky. If one follows the three stars of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]'s belt from left to right (in the Northern Hemisphere) or right to left (in the Southern), the first bright star found by continuing that line is Aldebaran.

Aldebaran has the appearance of being the brightest member of the more scattered [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] [[open star cluster]] that makes up the bull's-head-shaped asterism. However, Aldebaran is merely located by chance in the line of sight between the Earth and the Hyades; the star cluster is actually more than twice as far away, at about 150 light years.

[[File:Occultation.jpg|thumb|left|200px|In this predawn occultation, Aldebaran has just reappeared on the dark limb of the waning crescent Moon (July 1997 still frame captured from video).]]

Aldebaran is close enough to the [[ecliptic]] to be [[Occultation|occulted]] by the [[Moon]]. Such occultations occur when the Moon's [[ascending node]] is near the [[autumnal equinox]]. This event will next occur around 2015. A reasonably accurate estimate for the diameter of Aldebaran was obtained during the September 22, 1978 occultation.<ref>{{cite journal

==Double star==
Five faint stars appear close enough to Aldebaran in its visual field for astronomers to consider it a [[double star]] association. These stars were given alphabetic secondary star designations more or less in the order of their discovery, with the letter A reserved for the primary star. The better known characteristics of these [[double star|optical double stars]] are listed in the table below with the primary star, Aldebaran (Alpha Tauri A), shown for reference.<ref name=VizieR>{{cite web |title=VizieR Detailed Page CCDM===04359+1631

Some surveys have indicated that Alpha Tauri B may have about the same [[proper motion]] and [[parallax]] as Aldebaran and thus may be a [[binary star|physical binary]] system. However these measurements are difficult to make because the dim B component appears so close to the bright primary star. The resulting margin of error is too large to positively establish (or exclude) a physical relationship between the two stars. So far neither the B component, nor anything else, has been unambiguously shown to be physically associated with Aldebaran.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Statistical studies of visual double and multiple stars. II. A catalogue of nearby wide binary and multiple systems | journal=Revista Mexicana de Astronomia y Astrofisica | volume=28 | pages=43–89 | date=April 1994 | bibcode=1994RMxAA..28...43P | issue=1 | author=Poveda, A.; Herrera, M. A.; Allen, C.; Cordero, G.; Lavalley, C.}}</ref>

Alpha Tauri CD is a  [[binary star|binary system]] with the C and D component stars gravitationally bound to and co-orbiting each other. These co-orbiting stars have been shown to be located far beyond Aldebaran and are members of the Hyades star cluster. As with the rest of the stars in the cluster they do not physically interact with Aldebaran in any way.<ref name=CD />

== Claims of a planetary system ==
<!--[[File:Aldebaran_b_Planet.png|thumb|left|200px|Artistic rendering of Aldebaran b]]
What features is this image meant to represent? Does anyone know what an 11mj planet would even look like? The planet is not even confirmed.-->

In 1993, radial velocity measurements of Aldebaran, [[Arcturus]] and [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] showed that Aldebaran exhibited a long-period radial velocity oscillation, which could be interpreted as a ''substellar companion''. The measurements for Aldebaran implied a companion with a minimum mass 11.4 times that of [[Jupiter]] in a 643-day orbit at a separation of {{convert|2.0|AU|Gm|abbr=on}} in a mildly [[Eccentricity (orbit)|eccentric]] orbit. However, all three stars surveyed showed similar oscillations yielding similar companion masses, and the authors concluded that the variation was likely to be intrinsic to the star rather than due to the gravitational effect of a companion.<ref name=Kgiants>{{cite journal|bibcode=1993ApJ...413..339H

==Etymology==

From Arabic الدبران (al-dabarān), meaning "the follower" (of the Pleiades)

==Names in other languages==

In [[Persia]] it was known as Tascheter.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] called it ''{{lang|la|[[Parilia|Palilicium]]}}''.

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] it is known as {{lang|zh|[[:zh:畢宿五|畢宿五]]}} (''{{lang|zh-Latn|Bìxiùwŭ}}'', the Fifth Star of the Net).

In [[Hindu astronomy]] it is identified as the [[nakshatra|lunar mansion]] [[Rohini (nakshatra)|Rohini]] ("the red one") and as one of the twenty-seven daughters of [[Daksha]] and the wife of the god [[Chandra]].

==Myths==
This easily seen and striking star in its suggestive asterism is a popular subject for ancient and modern myths.

* Mexican culture: For the [[Seri people|Seris]] of northwestern Mexico, this star is providing light for the seven women giving birth ([[Pleiades]]). It has three names: ''{{lang|sei-Latn|Hant Caalajc Ipápjö}}'', ''{{lang|sei-Latn|Queeto}}'', and ''{{lang|sei-Latn|Azoj Yeen oo Caap}}'' ("star that goes ahead"). The lunar month corresponding to October is called ''{{lang|sei-Latn|Queeto yaao}}'' "Aldebaran's path".<ref>{{cite book |last=Moser |first=Mary B. |coauthors=Stephen A.

* Aboriginal culture: In the Clearance River of northeastern [[New South Wales]], this star is the Ancestor ''Karambal'', who stole another man's wife.  The woman's husband tracked him down and burned the tree in which he was hiding.  It is believed that he rose to the sky as smoke and became the star Aldebaran.<ref>p. 30, [http://books.google.com/books?id=BrQdF-uBCXgC ''Aboriginal People and Their Plants''], Philip A.
